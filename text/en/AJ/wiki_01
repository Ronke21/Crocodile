<text>The Turkic peoples are a collection of diverse ethnic groups of West, Central, East, and North Asia as well as parts of Europe, who speak Turkic languages.

According to historians and linguists, the Proto-Turkic language originated in Central-East Asia, potentially in the Altai-Sayan region, Mongolia or Tuva. Initially, Proto-Turkic speakers were potentially both hunter-gatherers and farmers; they later became nomadic pastoralists. Early and medieval Turkic groups exhibited a wide range of both East Asian and West-Eurasian physical appearances and genetic origins, in part through long-term contact with neighboring peoples such as Iranic, Mongolic, Tocharian, Uralic and Yeniseian peoples.

Many vastly differing ethnic groups have throughout history become part of the Turkic peoples through language shift, acculturation, conquest, intermixing, adoption, and religious conversion. Nevertheless, Turkic peoples share, to varying degrees, non-linguistic characteristics like cultural traits, ancestry from a common gene pool, and historical experiences. Some of the most notable modern Turkic ethnic groups include the Altai people, Azerbaijanis, Chuvash people, Gagauz people, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz people, Turkmens, Turkish people, Tuvans, Uyghurs, Uzbeks, and Yakuts.

== Etymology ==
The first known mention of the term &quot;Turk&quot; (Old Turkic: ê±Öê∞áê∞ºê∞∞ &quot;T√ºr√ºk&quot; or ê±Öê∞áê∞ºê∞∞:ê∞úê∞áê∞õ &quot;K√∂k T√ºr√ºk&quot;, , Pinyin: T≈´ju√© &lt; Middle Chinese *&quot;t…¶ut-kyat&quot; &lt; *&quot;dw…ôt-ku…ët&quot;, Old Tibetan: &quot;drugu&quot;) applied to only one Turkic group, namely, the G√∂kt√ºrks, who were also mentioned, as &quot;t√ºr√ºg&quot; ~ &quot;t√∂r√∂k&quot;, in the 6th-century Kh√ºis Tolgoi inscription, most likely not later than 587 AD. A letter by Ishbara Qaghan to Emperor Wen of Sui in 585 described him as &quot;the Great Turk Khan&quot;. The Bugut (584 CE) and Orkhon inscriptions (735 CE) use the terms &quot;T√ºrk√ºt&quot;, &quot;T√ºrk&quot; and &quot;T√ºr√ºk&quot;.

During the first century CE, Pomponius Mela refers to the &quot;Turcae&quot; in the forests north of the Sea of Azov, and Pliny the Elder lists the &quot;Tyrcae&quot; among the people of the same area. However, English archaeologist Ellis Minns contended that &quot;Tyrcae&quot; Œ§·ø¶œÅŒ∫Œ±Œπ is &quot;a false correction&quot; for &quot;Iyrcae&quot; ·ºπœçœÅŒ∫Œ±Œπ, a people who dwelt beyond the Thyssagetae, according to Herodotus (Histories, iv. 22), and were likely Ugric ancestors of Magyars. There are references to certain groups in antiquity whose names might have been foreign transcriptions of &quot;T√ºr(√º)k&quot;, such as &quot;Togarma&quot;, &quot;Turukha&quot;/&quot;Turu≈°ka&quot;, &quot;Turukku&quot; and so on; but the information gap is so substantial that any connection of these ancient people to the modern Turks is not possible.

The Chinese Book of Zhou (7th century) presents an etymology of the name &quot;Turk&quot; as derived from &#x27;helmet&#x27;, explaining that this name comes from the shape of a mountain where they worked in the Altai Mountains. Hungarian scholar Andr√°s R√≥na-Tas (1991) pointed to a Khotanese-Saka word, &quot;tturak√§&quot; &#x27;lid&#x27;, semantically stretchable to &#x27;helmet&#x27;, as a possible source for this folk etymology, yet Golden thinks this connection requires more data.

It is generally accepted that the name &quot;T√ºrk&quot; is ultimately derived from the Old-Turkic migration-term ê±Öê∞áê∞ºê∞∞ &quot;T√ºr√ºk&quot;/&quot;T√∂r√ºk&quot;, which means &#x27;created, born&#x27; or &#x27;strong&#x27;. Turkologist Peter B. Golden agrees that the term &quot;Turk&quot; has roots in Old Turkic, yet is not convinced by attempts to link &quot;Dili&quot;, &quot;Dingling&quot;, &quot;Chile&quot;, &quot;Tele&quot;, and &quot;Tiele&quot;, which possibly transcribed *&quot;tegrek&quot; (probably meaning &#x27;cart&#x27;), to &quot;Tujue&quot;, which transliterated to &quot;T√ºrk√ºt&quot;.

Scholars, including Toru Haneda, Onogawa Hidemi, and Geng Shimin believed that &quot;Di&quot;, &quot;Dili&quot;, &quot;Dingling&quot;, &quot;Chile&quot; and &quot;Tujue&quot; all came from the Turkic word &quot;T√ºrk&quot;, which means &#x27;powerful&#x27; and &#x27;strength&#x27;, and its plural form is &quot;T√ºrk√ºt&quot;. Even though Gerhard Doerfer supports the proposal that &quot;t√ºrk&quot; means &#x27;strong&#x27; in general, Gerard Clauson points out that &quot;the word &quot;t√ºrk&quot; is never used in the generalized sense of &#x27;strong&#x27;&quot; and that &quot;t√ºrk&quot; was originally a noun and meant &quot;&#x27;the culminating point of maturity&#x27; (of a fruit, human being, etc.), but more often used as an [adjective] meaning (of a fruit) &#x27;just fully ripe&#x27;; (of a human being) &#x27;in the prime of life, young, and vigorous&#x27;&quot;. Hakan Aydemir (2022) also contends that &quot;T√ºrk&quot; originally did not mean &quot;strong, powerful&quot; but &quot;gathered; united, allied, confederated&quot; and was derived from Pre-Proto-Turkic verb *&quot;t√ºr√º&quot; &quot;heap up, collect, gather, assemble&quot;.

The earliest Turkic-speaking peoples identifiable in Chinese sources are the Yenisei Kyrgyz and Xinli, located in South Siberia. Another example of an early Turkic population would be the Dingling.

In Late Antiquity itself, as well as in and the Middle Ages, the name &quot;Scythians&quot; was used in Greco-Roman and Byzantine literature for various groups of nomadic &quot;barbarians&quot; living on the Pontic-Caspian Steppe who were not related to the actual Scythians. Medieval European chroniclers subsumed various Turkic peoples of the Eurasian steppe as &quot;Scythians&quot;. Between 400 CE and the 16th century, Byzantine sources use the name Œ£Œ∫œçŒ∏Œ±Œπ (&quot;Skuthai&quot;) in reference to twelve different Turkic peoples.

In the modern Turkish language as used in the Republic of Turkey, a distinction is made between &quot;Turks&quot; and the &quot;Turkic peoples&quot; in loosely speaking: the term &quot;T√ºrk&quot; corresponds specifically to the &quot;Turkish-speaking&quot; people (in this context, &quot;Turkish-speaking&quot; is considered the same as &quot;Turkic-speaking&quot;), while the term &quot;T√ºrki&quot; refers generally to the people of modern &quot;Turkic Republics&quot; (&quot;T√ºrki Cumhuriyetler&quot; or &quot;T√ºrk Cumhuriyetleri&quot;). However, the proper usage of the term is based on the linguistic classification in order to avoid any political sense. In short, the term &quot;T√ºrki&quot; can be used for &quot;T√ºrk&quot; or vice versa.

Possible Proto-Turkic ancestry, at least partial, has been posited for Xiongnu, Huns and Pannonian Avars, as well as Tuoba and Rouran, who were of Proto-Mongolic Donghu ancestry. as well as Tatars, Rourans&#x27; supposed descendants.

== Language ==

=== Distribution ===

The Turkic languages constitute a language family of some 30 languages, spoken across a vast area from Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean, to Siberia and Manchuria and through to the Middle East. Some 170 million people have a Turkic language as their native language; an additional 20 million people speak a Turkic language as a second language. The Turkic language with the greatest number of speakers is Turkish proper, or Anatolian Turkish, the speakers of which account for about 40% of all Turkic speakers. More than one third of these are ethnic Turks of Turkey, dwelling predominantly in Turkey proper and formerly Ottoman-dominated areas of Southern and Eastern Europe and West Asia; as well as in Western Europe, Australia and the Americas as a result of immigration. The remainder of the Turkic people are concentrated in Central Asia, Russia, the Caucasus, China, and northern Iraq.

The Turkic language family was traditionally considered to be part of the proposed Altaic language family. Howeover since the 1950s, a majority of linguists have rejected the proposal, after supposed cognates were found not to be valid, hypothesized sound shifts were not found, and Turkic and Mongolic languages were found to be converging rather than diverging over the centuries. Opponents of the theory proposed that the similarities are due to mutual linguistic influences between the groups concerned.

=== Alphabet ===

The Turkic alphabets are sets of related alphabets with letters (formerly known as runes), used for writing mostly Turkic languages. Inscriptions in Turkic alphabets were found in Mongolia. Most of the preserved inscriptions were dated to between 8th and 10th centuries CE.

The earliest positively dated and read Turkic inscriptions date from the 8th century, and the alphabets were generally replaced by the Old Uyghur alphabet in the East and Central Asia, Arabic script in the Middle and Western Asia, Cyrillic in Eastern Europe and in the Balkans, and Latin alphabet in Central Europe. The latest recorded use of Turkic alphabet was recorded in Central Europe&#x27;s Hungary in 1699 CE.

The Turkic runiform scripts, unlike other typologically close scripts of the world, do not have a uniform palaeography as do, for example, the Gothic runiform scripts, noted for their exceptional uniformity of language and paleography. The Turkic alphabets are divided into four groups, the best known of which is the Orkhon version of the Enisei group. The Orkhon script is the alphabet used by the G√∂kt√ºrks from the 8th century to record the Old Turkic language. It was later used by the Uyghur Empire; a Yenisei variant is known from 9th-century Kyrgyz inscriptions, and it has likely cousins in the Talas Valley of Turkestan and the Old Hungarian script of the 10th century. Irk Bitig is the only known complete manuscript text written in the Old Turkic script.

== History ==


=== Origins ===
The origins of the Turkic peoples has been a topic of much discussion. Peter Benjamin Golden proposes two locations for the Proto-Turkic Urheimat: the southern Altai-Sayan region, and Southern Siberia, from Lake Baikal to eastern Mongolia. Other studies suggested an early presence of Turkic peoples in Mongolia, or Tuva.

A possible genealogical link of the Turkic languages to Mongolic and Tungusic languages, specifically a hypothetical homeland in Manchuria, such as proposed in the Transeurasian hypothesis, by Martine Robbeets, has received support but also criticism, with opponents attributing similarities to long-term contact. The proto-Turkic-speakers may be linked to Neolithic East Asian agricultural societies in Northeastern China, which is to be associated with the Xinglongwa culture and the succeeding Hongshan culture, based on varying degrees of specific East Asian genetic substratum among modern Turkic speakers. According to historians, &quot;the Proto-Turkic subsistence strategy included an agricultural component, a tradition that ultimately went back to the origin of millet agriculture in Northeast China&quot;. This view is however questioned by other geneticists, who found no evidence for a shared &quot;Neolithic Hongshan ancestry&quot;, but in contrary primary Ancient Northeast Asian (ANA) Neolithic ancestry from the Amur region, supporting an origin from Northeast Asia rather than Manchuria.

Around 2,200 BC, the (agricultural) ancestors of the Turkic peoples probably migrated westwards into Mongolia, where they adopted a pastoral lifestyle, in part borrowed from Iranian peoples. Given nomadic peoples such as Xiongnu, Rouran and Xianbei share underlying genetic ancestry &quot;that falls into or close to the northeast Asian gene pool&quot;, the proto-Turkic language likely originated in northeastern Asia.

Genetic data found that almost all modern Turkic peoples retained at least some shared ancestry associated with populations in &quot;South Siberia and Mongolia&quot; (SSM), supporting this region as the &quot;Inner Asian Homeland (IAH) of the pioneer carriers of Turkic languages&quot; which subsequently expanded into Central Asia. The main Turkic expansion took place during the 5th‚Äì16th centuries, partially overlapping with the Mongol Empire period. Based on single-path IBD tracts, the common Turkic ancestral population lived prior to these migration events, and likely stem from a similar source population as Mongolic peoples further East. Historical data suggests that the Mongol Empire period acted as secondary force of &quot;turkification&quot;, as the Mongol conquest &quot;did not involve massive re-settlements of Mongols over the conquered territories. Instead, the Mongol war machine was progressively augmented by various Turkic tribes as they expanded, and in this way Turkic peoples eventually reinforced their expansion over the Eurasian steppe and beyond.&quot;

A 2018 autosomal single-nucleotide polymorphism study suggested that the Eurasian Steppe slowly transitioned from Indo European and Iranian-speaking groups with largely western Eurasian ancestry to increasing East Asian ancestry with Turkic and Mongolian groups in the past 4000 years, including extensive Turkic migrations out of Mongolia and slow assimilation of local populations. A 2022 report suggested that Turkic and Mongolic populations in Central Asia formed via admixture events during the Iron Age between &quot;local Indo-Iranian and a South-Siberian or Mongolian group with a high East-Asian ancestry (around 60%)&quot;. Modern day Turkmens form an outlier among Central Asian Turkic-speakers with a lower frequency of the Baikal component (c. 22%) and a lack of the Han-like component, being closer to other Indo-Iranian groups. A subsequent study in 2022 also found that the spread of Turkic-speaking populations into Central Asia happened after the spread of Indo-European speakers into the area. Another 2022 study found that all Altaic‚Äêspeaking (Turkic, Tungusic, and Mongolic) populations &quot;were a mixture of dominant Siberian Neolithic ancestry and non-negligible YRB ancestry&quot;, suggesting their origins were somewhere in Northeast Asia, most likely the Amur river basin. Except Eastern and Southern Mongolic-speakers, all &quot;possessed a high proportion of West Eurasian-related ancestry, in accordance with the linguistically documented language borrowing in Turkic languages&quot;.

A 2023 study analyzed the DNA of Empress Ashina (568‚Äì578 AD), a Royal G√∂kt√ºrk, whose remains were recovered from a mausoleum in Xianyang, China. The authors determined that Empress Ashina belonged to the North-East Asian mtDNA haplogroup F1d, and that approximately 96-98% of her autosomal ancestry was of Ancient Northeast Asian origin, while roughly 2-4% was of West Eurasian origin, indicating ancient admixture. This study weakened the &quot;western Eurasian origin and multiple origin hypotheses&quot;. However, they also noted that &quot;Central Steppe and early Medieval T√ºrk exhibited a high but variable degree of West Eurasian ancestry, indicating there was a genetic substructure of the T√ºrkic empire.&quot; The early medieval T√ºrk samples were modelled as having 37.8% West Eurasian ancestry and 62.2% Ancient Northeast Asian ancestry and historic Central Steppe T√ºrk samples were also an admixture of West Eurasian and Ancient Northeast Asian ancestry, while historic Karakhanid, Kipchak and the Turkic Karluk samples had 50.6%-61.1% West Eurasian ancestry and 38.9%‚Äì49.4% Iron Age Yellow River farmer ancestry. A 2020 study also found &quot;high genetic heterogeneity and diversity during the T√ºrkic and Uyghur periods&quot; in the early medieval period in Eastern Eurasian Steppe.

=== Early historical attestation ===
The earliest separate Turkic peoples, such as the &quot;Gekun&quot; (È¨≤ÊòÜ) and &quot;Xinli&quot; (Ëñ™ÁäÅ), appeared on the peripheries of the late Xiongnu confederation about 200 BCE (contemporaneous with the Chinese Han dynasty) and later among the Turkic-speaking Tiele as &quot;Hegu&quot; (Á¥áÈ™®) and &quot;Xue&quot; (Ëñõ).

The Tiele (also known as Gaoche È´òËªä, lit. &quot;High Carts&quot;), may be related to the Xiongnu and the Dingling. According to the &quot;Book of Wei&quot;, the Tiele people were the remnants of the Chidi (Ëµ§ÁãÑ), the red Di people competing with the Jin in the Spring and Autumn period. Historically they were established after the 6th century BCE.

The Tiele were first mentioned in Chinese literature from the 6th to 8th centuries. Some scholars (Haneda, Onogawa, Geng, etc.) proposed that &quot;Tiele&quot;, &quot;Dili&quot;, &quot;Dingling&quot;, &quot;Chile&quot;, &quot;Tele&quot;, &amp; &quot;Tujue&quot; all transliterated underlying &quot;T√ºrk&quot;; however, Golden proposed that &quot;Dili&quot;, &quot;Dingling&quot;, &quot;Chile&quot;, &quot;Tele&quot;, and &quot;Tiele&quot; transliterated &quot;Tegrek&quot; while Tujue transliterated &quot;T√ºrk√ºt&quot;, plural of &quot;T√ºrk&quot;. The appellation &quot;T√ºr√ºk&quot; (Old Turkic: ê±Öê∞áê∞ºê∞∞) ~ &quot;T√ºrk&quot; (OT: ê±Öê∞áê∞ºê∞ö) (whence Middle Chinese Á™ÅÂé• *&quot;dw…ôt-ku…ët&quot; &gt; *&quot;t…¶ut-kyat&quot; &gt; standard Chinese: &quot;T≈´ju√©&quot;) was initially reserved exclusively for the G√∂kt√ºrks by Chinese, Tibetans, and even the Turkic-speaking Uyghurs. In contrast, medieval Muslim writers, including Turkic speakers like Ottoman historian Mustafa √Çl√Æ and explorer Evliya √áelebi as well as Timurid scientist Ulugh Beg, often viewed Inner Asian tribes, &quot;as forming a single entity regardless of their linguistic affiliation&quot; commonly used Turk as a generic name for Inner Asians (whether Turkic- or Mongolic-speaking). Only in modern era do modern historians use Turks to refer to all peoples speaking Turkic languages, differentiated from non-Turkic speakers.

According to some researchers (Duan, Xue, Tang, Lung, Onogawa, etc.) the later Ashina tribe descended from the Tiele confederation. The Tiele however were probably one of many early Turkic groups, ancestral to later Turkic populations. However, according to Lee &amp; Kuang (2017), Chinese histories do not describe the Ashina and the G√∂kt√ºrks as descending from the Dingling or the Tiele confederation.

==== Xiongnu (3rd c. BCE ‚Äì 1st c. CE) ====

It has even been suggested that the Xiongnu themselves, who were mentioned in Han dynasty records, were Proto-Turkic speakers. The Turks may ultimately have been of Xiongnu descent. Although little is known for certain about the Xiongnu language(s), it seems likely that at least a considerable part of Xiongnu tribes spoke a Turkic language. Some scholars believe they were probably a confederation of various ethnic and linguistic groups. According to a study by Alexander Savelyev and Choongwon Jeong, published in 2020 in the journal &quot;Evolutionary Human Sciences&quot; by Cambridge University Press, &quot;the predominant part of the Xiongnu population is likely to have spoken Turkic&quot;. However, genetic studies found a mixture of western and eastern Eurasian ancestries, suggesting a large genetic diversity within the Xiongnu. The Turkic-related component may be brought by eastern Eurasian genetic substratum.

Using the only extant possibly Xiongnu writings, the rock art of the Yinshan and Helan Mountains, some scholars argue that the older Xiongnu writings are precursors to the earliest known Turkic alphabet, the Orkhon script. Petroglyphs of this region dates from the 9th millennium BCE to the 19th century, and consists mainly of engraved signs (petroglyphs) and few painted images. Excavations done during 1924‚Äì1925 in Noin-Ula kurgans located in the Selenga River in the northern Mongolian hills north of Ulaanbaatar produced objects with over 20 carved characters, which were either identical or very similar to the runic letters of the Turkic Orkhon script discovered in the Orkhon Valley.

=== Steppe expansions ===
==== G√∂kt√ºrks ‚Äì Turkic Khaganate (5th‚Äì8th c.) ====

The earliest certain mentioning of the politonym &quot;Turk&quot; was in the Chinese Book of Zhou. In the 540s AD, this text mentions that the Turks came to China&#x27;s border seeking silk goods and a trade relationship. A Sogdian diplomat represented China in a series of embassies between the Western Wei dynasty and the Turks in the years 545 and 546.

According to the &quot;Book of Sui&quot; and the &quot;Tongdian&quot;, they were &quot;mixed barbarians&quot; (; &quot;z√°h√∫&quot;) who migrated from Pingliang (now in modern Gansu province, China) to the Rourans seeking inclusion in their confederacy and protection from the prevailing dynasty. Alternatively, according to the &quot;Book of Zhou&quot;, &quot;History of the Northern Dynasties&quot;, and &quot;New Book of Tang&quot;, the Ashina clan was a component of the Xiongnu confederation. G√∂kt√ºrks were also posited as having originated from an obscure Suo state (Á¥¢Âúã), north of the Xiongnu. The Ashina tribe were famed metalsmiths and were granted land south of the Altai Mountains (ÈáëÂ±± &quot;Jinshan&quot;), which looked like a helmet, from which they were said to have gotten their name Á™ÅÂé• (&quot;T≈´ju√©&quot;), the first recorded use of &quot;Turk&quot; as a political name. In the 6th-century, Ashina&#x27;s power had increased such that they conquered the Tiele on their Rouran overlords&#x27; behalf and even overthrew Rourans and established the First Turkic Khaganate.
The original Old Turkic name &quot;K√∂k T√ºrk&quot; derives from &quot;k√∂k&quot; ~ &quot;k√∂:k&quot;, &quot;sky, sky-coloured, blue, blue-grey&quot;. Unlike its Xiongnu predecessor, the G√∂kt√ºrk Khaganate had its temporary Khagans from the Ashina clan, who were &quot;subordinate&quot; to a sovereign authority controlled by a council of tribal chiefs. The Khaganate retained elements of its original animistic- shamanistic religion, that later evolved into Tengriism, although it received missionaries of Buddhist monks and practiced a syncretic religion. The G√∂kt√ºrks were the first Turkic people to write Old Turkic in a runic script, the Orkhon script. The Khaganate was also the first state known as &quot;Turk&quot;. It eventually collapsed due to a series of dynastic conflicts, but many states and peoples later used the name &quot;Turk&quot;.

The G√∂kt√ºrks (First Turkic Kaganate) quickly spread west to the Caspian Sea. Between 581 and 603 the Western Turkic Khaganate in Kazakhstan separated from the Eastern Turkic Khaganate in Mongolia and Manchuria during a civil war. The Han-Chinese successfully overthrew the Eastern Turks in 630 and created a military Protectorate until 682. After that time the Second Turkic Khaganate ruled large parts of the former G√∂kt√ºrk area. After several wars between Turks, Chinese and Tibetans, the weakened Second Turkic Khaganate was replaced by the Uyghur Khaganate in the year 744.

==== Bulgars, Golden Horde and the Siberian Khanate ====

The Bulgars established themselves in between the Caspian and Black Seas in the 5th and 6th centuries, followed by their conquerors, the Khazars who converted to Judaism in the 8th or 9th century. After them came the Pechenegs who created a large confederacy, which was subsequently taken over by the Cumans and the Kipchaks. One group of Bulgars settled in the Volga region and mixed with local Volga Finns to become the Volga Bulgars in what is today Tatarstan. These Bulgars were conquered by the Mongols following their westward sweep under Ogedei Khan in the 13th century. Other Bulgars settled in Southeastern Europe in the 7th and 8th centuries, and mixed with the Slavic population, adopting what eventually became the Slavic Bulgarian language. Everywhere, Turkic groups mixed with the local populations to varying degrees.
The Volga Bulgaria became an Islamic state in 922 and influenced the region as it controlled many trade routes. In the 13th century, Mongols invaded Europe and established the Golden Horde in Eastern Europe, western and northern Central Asia, and even western Siberia. The Cuman-Kipchak Confederation and Islamic Volga Bulgaria were absorbed by the Golden Horde in the 13th century; in the 14th century, Islam became the official religion under Uzbeg Khan where the general population (Turks) as well as the aristocracy (Mongols) came to speak the Kipchak language and were collectively known as &quot;Tatars&quot; by Russians and Westerners. This country was also known as the Kipchak Khanate and covered most of what is today Ukraine, as well as the entirety of modern-day southern and eastern Russia (the European section). The Golden Horde disintegrated into several khanates and hordes in the 15th and 16th century including the Crimean Khanate, Khanate of Kazan, and Kazakh Khanate (among others), which were one by one conquered and annexed by the Russian Empire in the 16th through 19th centuries.

In Siberia, the Siberian Khanate was established in the 1490s by fleeing Tatar aristocrats of the disintegrating Golden Horde who established Islam as the official religion in western Siberia over the partly Islamized native Siberian Tatars and indigenous Uralic peoples. It was the northernmost Islamic state in recorded history and it survived up until 1598 when it was conquered by Russia.

==== Uyghur Khaganate (8th‚Äì9th c.) ====

The Uyghur Khaganate had established itself by the year 744 AD. Through trade relations established with China, its capital city of Ordu Baliq in central Mongolia&#x27;s Orkhon Valley became a wealthy center of commerce, and a significant portion of the Uyghur population abandoned their nomadic lifestyle for a sedentary one. The Uyghur Khaganate produced extensive literature, and a relatively high number of its inhabitants were literate.

The official state religion of the early Uyghur Khaganate was Manichaeism, which was introduced through the conversion of B√∂g√º Qaghan by the Sogdians after the An Lushan rebellion. The Uyghur Khaganate was tolerant of religious diversity and practiced variety of religions including Buddhism, Christianity, shamanism and Manichaeism.

During the same time period, the Shatuo Turks emerged as power factor in Northern and Central China and were recognized by the Tang Empire as allied power.

In 808, 30,000 Shatuo under Zhuye Jinzhong defected from the Tibetans to Tang China and the Tibetans punished them by killing Zhuye Jinzhong as they were chasing them. The Uyghurs also fought against an alliance of Shatuo and Tibetans at Beshbalik.

The Shatuo Turks under Zhuye Chixin (Li Guochang) served the Tang dynasty in fighting against their fellow Turkic people in the Uyghur Khaganate. In 839, when the Uyghur khaganate (Huigu) general Jueluowu (ÊéòÁæÖÂãø) rose against the rule of then-reigning Zhangxin Khan, he elicited the help from Zhuye Chixin by giving Zhuye 300 horses, and together, they defeated Zhangxin Khan, who then committed suicide, precipitating the subsequent collapse of the Uyghur Khaganate. In the next few years, when Uyghur Khaganate remnants tried to raid Tang borders, the Shatuo participated extensively in counterattacking the Uyghur Khaganate with other tribes loyal to Tang. In 843, Zhuye Chixin, under the command of the Han Chinese officer Shi Xiong with Tuyuhun, Tangut and Han Chinese troops, participated in a raid against the Uyghur khaganate that led to the slaughter of Uyghur forces at Shahu mountain.

The Shatuo Turks had founded several short-lived sinicized dynasties in northern China during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period starting with Later Tang. The Shatuo chief Zhuye Chixin&#x27;s family was adopted by the Tang dynasty and given the title prince of Jin and the Tang dynasty imperial surname of Li, which is why the Shatuo of Later Tang claimed to be restoring the Tang dynasty and not founding a new one. The official language of these dynasties was Chinese and they used Chinese titles and names. Some Shaotuo Turk emperors (of the Later Jin, Later Han and Northern Han) also claimed patrilineal Han Chinese ancestry.

After the fall of the Tang dynasty in 907, the Shatuo Turks replaced them and created the Later Tang dynasty in 923. The Shatuo Turks ruled over a large part of northern China, including Beijing. They adopted Chinese names and united Turkic and Chinese traditions. Later Tang fell in 937 but the Shatuo rose to become a powerful faction of northern China. They created two other dynasties, including the Later Jin and Later Han and Northern Han (Later Han and Northern Han were ruled by the same family, with the latter being a rump state of the former). The Shatuo Liu Zhiyuan was a Buddhist and he worshipped the Mengshan Giant Buddha in 945. The Shatuo dynasties were replaced by the Han Chinese Song dynasty. The Shatuo became the Ongud Turks living in Inner Mongolia after the Song dynasty conquered the last Shatuo dynasty of Northern Han. The Ongud assimilated to the Mongols.

The Yenisei Kyrgyz allied with China to destroy the Uyghur Khaganate in the year 840 AD. From the Yenisei River, the Kyrgyz pushed south and eastward in to Xinjiang and the Orkhon Valley in central Mongolia, leaving much of the Uyghur civilization in ruins. Much of the Uyghur population relocated to the southwest of Mongolia, establishing the Ganzhou Uyghur Kingdom in Gansu where their descendants are the modern day Yugurs and Qocho Kingdom in Turpan, Xinjiang.

==== Kangar union (659‚Äì750) ====
The Kangar Union (&quot;Qanghar Odaghu&quot;) was a Turkic state in the former territory of the Western Turkic Khaganate (the entire present-day state of Kazakhstan, without Zhetysu). The capital of the Kangar union was located in the Ulytau mountains. Among the Pechenegs, the Kangar formed the elite of the Pecheneg tribes. After being defeated by the Kipchaks, Oghuz Turks, and the Khazars, they migrated west and defeated Magyars, and after forming an alliance with the Bulgars, they defeated the Byzantine Army. The Pecheneg state was established by the 11th century and at its peak carried a population of over 2.5 million, composed of many different ethnic groups.

The elite of the Kangar tribes are believed to have had an Iranian origin, and they likely spoke an Iranian language, while most of the Pecheneg population spoke a Turkic language, with a significant percentage speaking Hunno-Bulgar dialects.

The Yatuks, a tribe within the Kangar state who could not accompany the Kangars as they migrated West, remained in the old lands, where they are known as the Kangly people, who are now part of the Uzbek, Kazakh, and Karakalpak tribes.

==== Oghuz Yabgu State (766‚Äì1055) ====
The Oguz Yabgu State (&quot;Oguz il&quot;, meaning &quot;Oguz Land&quot;, &quot;Oguz Country&quot;)(750‚Äì1055) was a Turkic state, founded by Oghuz Turks in 766, located geographically in an area between the coasts of the Caspian and Aral Seas. Oguz tribes occupied a vast territory in Kazakhstan along the Irgiz, Yaik, Emba, and Uil rivers, the Aral Sea area, the Syr Darya valley, the foothills of the Karatau Mountains in Tien-Shan, and the Chui River valley (see map). The Oguz political association developed in the 9th and 10th centuries in the Syr Darya basin.

====Salar Oghuz migration====
The Salars are descended from Turkmen who migrated from Central Asia and settled in a Tibetan area of Qinghai under Ming Chinese rule. The Salar ethnicity formed and underwent ethnogenesis from a process of male Turkmen migrants from Central Asia marrying Amdo Tibetan women during the early Ming dynasty.

=== Iranian, Indian, Arabic, and Anatolian expansion ===
Turkic peoples and related groups migrated west from present-day Northeastern China, Mongolia, Siberia and the Turkestan-region towards the Iranian plateau, South Asia, and Anatolia (modern Turkey) in many waves. The date of the initial expansion remains unknown.

==== Persia ====
===== Ghaznavid dynasty (977‚Äì1186) =====

The Ghaznavid dynasty ( &quot;ƒ°aznaviyƒÅn&quot;) was a Persianate Muslim dynasty of Turkic &quot;mamluk&quot; origin, at their greatest extent ruling large parts of Iran, Afghanistan, much of Transoxiana and the northwest Indian subcontinent (part of Pakistan) from 977 to 1186. The dynasty was founded by Sabuktigin upon his succession to rule of the region of Ghazna after the death of his father-in-law, Alp Tigin, who was a breakaway ex-general of the Samanid Empire from Balkh, north of the Hindu Kush in Greater Khorasan.

Although the dynasty was of Central Asian Turkic origin, it was thoroughly Persianised in terms of language, culture, literature and habits and hence is regarded by some as a &quot;Persian dynasty&quot;.

===== Seljuk Empire (1037‚Äì1194) =====


The Seljuk Empire () or the Great Seljuq Empire was a high medieval Turko-Persian Sunni Muslim empire, originating from the Qiniq branch of Oghuz Turks. At its greatest extent, the Seljuk Empire controlled a vast area stretching from western Anatolia and the Levant to the Hindu Kush in the east, and from Central Asia to the Persian Gulf in the south.

The Seljuk empire was founded by Tughril Beg (1016‚Äì1063) and his brother Chaghri Beg (989‚Äì1060) in 1037. From their homelands near the Aral Sea, the Seljuks advanced first into Khorasan and then into mainland Persia, before eventually conquering eastern Anatolia. Here the Seljuks won the battle of Manzikert in 1071 and conquered most of Anatolia from the Byzantine Empire, which became one of the reasons for the First Crusade (1095‚Äì1099). From c. 1150‚Äì1250, the Seljuk empire declined, and was invaded by the Mongols around 1260. The Mongols divided Anatolia into emirates. Eventually one of these, the Ottoman, would conquer the rest.

===== Timurid Empire (1370‚Äì1507) =====

The Timurid Empire was a Turko-Mongol empire founded in the late 14th century through military conquests led by Timurlane. The establishment of a cosmopolitan empire was followed by the Timurid Renaissance, a period of local enrichment in mathematics, astronomy, architecture, as well as newfound economic growth. The cultural progress of the Timurid period ended as soon as the empire collapsed in the early 16th century, leaving many intellecuals and artists to turn elsewhere in search of employment.

===== Central Asian khanates (1501‚Äì1920) =====
The Bukhara Khanate was an Uzbek state that existed from 1501 to 1785. The khanate was ruled by three dynasties of the Shaybanids, Janids and the Uzbek dynasty of Mangits. In 1785, Shahmurad, formalized the family&#x27;s dynastic rule (Manghit dynasty), and the khanate became the Emirate of Bukhara (1785‚Äì1920). In 1710, the Kokand Khanate (1710‚Äì1876) separated from the Bukhara Khanate. In 1511‚Äì1920, Khwarazm (Khiva Khanate) was ruled by the Arabshahid dynasty and the Uzbek dynasty of Kungrats.

===== Afsharid dynasty (1736‚Äì1796) =====
The Afsharid dynasty was named after the Turkic Afshar tribe to which they belonged. The Afshars had migrated from Turkestan to Azerbaijan in the 13th century. The dynasty was founded in 1736 by the military commander Nader Shah who deposed the last member of the Safavid dynasty and proclaimed himself King of Iran. Nader belonged to the Qereqlu branch of the Afshars. During Nader&#x27;s reign, Iran reached its greatest extent since the Sassanid Empire.

===== Qajar dynasty (1789‚Äì1925) =====
The Qajar dynasty was created by the Turkic Qajar tribe, ruling over Iran from 1789 to 1925. The Qajar family took full control of Iran in 1794, deposing Lotf &#x27;Ali Khan, the last Shah of the Zand dynasty, and re-asserted Iranian sovereignty over large parts of the Caucasus. In 1796, Mohammad Khan Qajar seized Mashhad with ease, putting an end to the Afsharid dynasty, and Mohammad Khan was formally crowned as Shah after his punitive campaign against Iran&#x27;s Georgian subjects. In the Caucasus, the Qajar dynasty permanently lost many of Iran&#x27;s integral areas to the Russians over the course of the 19th century, comprising modern-day Georgia, Dagestan, Azerbaijan and Armenia. The dynasty was founded by Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar and continued until Ahmad Shah Qajar.

==== South Asia ====
The Delhi Sultanate is a term used to cover five short-lived, Delhi-based kingdoms, two of which were of Turkic origins: the Mamluk dynasty (1206‚Äì1290) and the Tughlaq dynasty (1320‚Äì1414). Southern India saw rise of the Qutb Shahi dynasty, one of the Deccan sultanates.
The Mughal Empire was a Turko-Mongol empire that, at its greatest territorial extent, ruled most of South Asia, including Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and parts of Uzbekistan from the early 16th to the early 18th centuries. The Mughal dynasty was founded by a Turko-Mongol prince named Babur (reigned 1526‚Äì1530), who was descended from Timur (Tamerlane) on his father&#x27;s side and from Chagatai, second son of the Mongol ruler Genghis Khan, on his mother&#x27;s side. A further distinction was the attempt of the Mughals to integrate Hindus and Muslims into a united Indian state.

==== Arab world ====
The Arab Muslim Umayyads and Abbasids fought against the pagan Turks in the T√ºrgesh Khaganate in the Muslim conquest of Transoxiana. Turkic soldiers in the army of the Abbasid caliphs emerged as the de facto rulers of most of the Muslim Middle East (apart from Syria and Egypt), particularly after the 10th century. Examples of regional de facto independent states include the short lived Tulunids and Ikhshidids in Egypt. The Oghuz and other tribes captured and dominated various countries under the leadership of the Seljuk dynasty and eventually captured the territories of the Abbasid dynasty and the Byzantine Empire.

==== Anatolia ‚Äì Ottomans ====

After many battles, the western Oghuz Turks established their own state and later constructed the Ottoman Empire. The main migration of the Oghuz Turks occurred in medieval times, when they spread across most of Asia and into Europe and the Middle East. They also took part in the military encounters of the Crusades. In 1090‚Äì91, the Turkic Pechenegs reached the walls of Constantinople, where Emperor Alexius I with the aid of the Kipchaks annihilated their army.

As the Seljuk Empire declined following the Mongol invasion, the Ottoman Empire emerged as the new important Turkic state, that came to dominate not only the Middle East, but even southeastern Europe, parts of southwestern Russia, and northern Africa.

==== Islamization ====
Turkic peoples like the Karluks (mainly 8th century), Uyghurs, Kyrgyz, Turkmens, and Kipchaks later came into contact with Muslims, and most of them gradually adopted Islam. Some groups of Turkic people practice other religions, including their original animistic-shamanistic religion, Christianity, Burkhanism, Judaism (Khazars, Krymchaks, Crimean Karaites), Buddhism, and a small number of Zoroastrians.

=== Modern history ===

The Ottoman Empire gradually grew weaker in the face of poor administration, repeated wars with Russia, Austria and Hungary, and the emergence of nationalist movements in the Balkans, and it finally gave way after World War I to the present-day Republic of Turkey.
Ethnic nationalism also developed in Ottoman Empire during the 19th century, taking the form of Pan-Turkism or Turanism.

The Turkic peoples of Central Asia were not organized in nation-states during most of the 20th century, after the collapse of the Russian Empire living either in the Soviet Union or (after a short-lived First East Turkestan Republic) in the Chinese Republic. For much of the 20th century, Turkey was the only independent Turkic country.

In 1991, after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, five Turkic states gained their independence. These were Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. Other Turkic regions such as Tatarstan, Tuva, and Yakutia remained in the Russian Federation. Chinese Turkestan remained part of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Immediately after the independence of the Turkic states, Turkey began seeking diplomatic relations with them. Over time political meetings between the Turkic countries increased and led to the establishment of T√úRKSOY in 1993 and the Turkic Council in 2009, which later was renamed Organization of Turkic States in 2021.

==Physiognomy==
According to historians Joo-Yup Lee and Shuntu Kuang, Chinese official histories do not depict Turkic peoples as belonging to a single uniform entity called &quot;Turks&quot;. However &quot;Chinese histories also depict the Turkic-speaking peoples as typically possessing East/Inner Asian physiognomy, as well as occasionally having West Eurasian physiognomy.&quot; According to &quot;fragmentary information on the Xiongnu language that can be found in the Chinese histories, the Xiongnu were Turkic&quot;, however historians have been unable to confirm whether or not they were Turkic. Sima Qian&#x27;s description of their legendary origins suggest their physiognomy was &quot;not too different from that of... Han (Êº¢) Chinese population&quot;, but a subset of Xiongnu known as the Jie people were described having &quot;deep-set eyes&quot;, &quot;high nose bridges&quot; and &quot;heavy facial hair&quot;. The Jie may have been Yeniseian, although others maintaining an Iranian affiliation, and regardless of whether or not the Xiongnu were Turkic, they were a hybrid people. According to the &quot;Old Book of Tang&quot;, Ashina Simo &quot;was not given a high military post by the Ashina rulers because of his Sogdian (&quot;huren&quot; ËÉ°‰∫∫) physiognomy.&quot; The Tang historian Yan Shigu described the Hu people of his day as &quot;blue-eyed and red bearded&quot; descendants of the Wusun, whereas &quot;no comparable depiction of the K√∂k T√ºrks or Tiele is found in the official Chinese histories.&quot;

Historian Peter Golden has reported that genetic testing of the proposed descendants of the Ashina tribe does seem to confirm a link to the Indo-Iranians, emphasizing that &quot;&quot;the Turks as a whole &#x27;were made up of heterogeneous and somatically dissimilar populations&quot;&#x27;&quot;. Historian Emel Esin and Professor Xue Zongzheng have argued that West Eurasian features were typical of the royal Ashina clan of the Eastern Turkic Khaganate and that their appearance shifted to an East Asian one due to intermarriage with foreign nobility. As a result, by the time of Kul Tigin (684 AD), members of the Ashina dynasty had East Asian features. A 2023 genetic study found that Empress Ashina (568‚Äì578 AD), a Royal G√∂kt√ºrk, had nearly entirely Ancient Northeast Asian origin, weakening the &quot;western Eurasian origin and multiple origin hypotheses&quot;. Lee and Kuang believe it is likely &quot;early and medieval Turkic peoples themselves did not form a homogeneous entity and that some of them, non-Turkic by origin, had become Turkicised at some point in history.&quot; They also suggest that many modern Turkic-speaking populations are not directly descended from early Turkic peoples. Lee and Kuang concluded that &quot;both medieval Chinese histories and modern DNA studies point to the fact that the early and medieval Turkic peoples were made up of heterogeneous and somatically dissimilar populations.&quot;

Like Chinese historians, Medieval Muslim writers generally depicted the Turks as having an East Asian appearance. Unlike Chinese historians, Medieval Muslim writers used the term &quot;Turk&quot; broadly to refer to not only Turkic-speaking peoples but also various non-Turkic speaking peoples, such as the Hephthalites, Rus, Magyars, and Tibetans. In the 13th century, Juzjani referred to the people of Tibet and the mountains between Tibet and Bengal as &quot;Turks&quot; and &quot;people with Turkish features.&quot; Medieval Arab and Persian descriptions of Turks state that they looked strange from their perspective and were extremely physically different from Arabs. Turks were described as &quot;broad faced people with small eyes&quot;, having light-colored, often reddish hair, and with pink skin, as being &quot;short, with small eyes, nostrils, and mouths&quot; (Sharaf al-Zaman al-Marwazi), as being &quot;full-faced with small eyes&quot; (Al-Tabari), as possessing &quot;a large head (&quot;sar-i buzurg&quot;), a broad face (&quot;r≈´y-i pahn&quot;), narrow eyes (&quot;chashmhƒÅ-i tang&quot;), and a flat nose (&quot;bƒ´nƒ´-i pakhch&quot;), and unpleasing lips and teeth (&quot;lab va dandƒÅn na nƒ´k≈´&quot;)&quot; (Keikavus). On Western Turkic coins &quot;the faces of the governor and governess are clearly Mongoloid (a roundish face, narrow eyes), and the portrait have definite old T√ºrk features (long hair, absence of headdress of the governor, a tricorn headdress of the governess)&quot;. In the Ghaznavids&#x27; residential palace of Lashkari Bazar, there survives a partially conserved portrait depicting a turbaned and haloed adolescent figure with full cheeks, slanted eyes, and a small, sinuous mouth. The Armenian historian Movses Kaghankatvatsi describes the Turks of the Western Turkic Khaganate as &quot;broad-faced, without eyelashes, and with long flowing hair like women&quot;.

Al-Masudi writes that the Oghuz Turks in Yengi-kent near the mouth of the Syr Darya &quot;are distinguished from other Turks by their valour, their slanted eyes, and the smallness of their stature.&quot; Later Muslim writers noted a change in the physiognomy of Oghuz Turks. According to Rashid al-Din Hamadani, &quot;because of the climate their features gradually changed into those of Tajiks. Since they were not Tajiks, the Tajik peoples called them &quot;turkmƒÅn&quot;, i.e. Turk-like (&quot;Turk-mƒÅnand&quot;).&quot; ·∏§ƒÅfi·∫ì Tanƒ´sh Mƒ´r Mu·∏•ammad BukhƒÅrƒ´ also related that the Oghuz&#x27; &#x27;Turkic face did not remain as it was&#x27; after their migration into Transoxiana and Iran. Khiva khan Abu al-Ghazi Bahadur wrote in his Chagatai language treatise &quot;Shajara-i TarƒÅkima&quot; (Genealogy of the Turkmens) that &quot;their chin started to become narrow, their eyes started to become large, their faces started to become small, and their noses started to become big&#x27; after five or six generations&quot;. Ottoman historian Mustafa √Çl√Æ commented in &quot;K√ºnh√º æl-a·∏´bƒÅr&quot; that Anatolian Turks and Ottoman elites are ethnically mixed: &quot;Most of the inhabitants of R√ªm are of confused ethnic origin. Among its notables there are few whose lineage does not go back to a convert to Islam.&quot;

Kevin Alan Brook states that like &quot;most nomadic Turks, the Western Turkic Khazars were racially and ethnically mixed.&quot; Istakhri described Khazars as having black hair while Ibn Sa&#x27;id al-Maghribi described them as having blue eyes, light skin, and reddish hair. Istakhri mentions that there were &quot;Black Khazars&quot; and &quot;White Khazars.&quot; Most scholars believe these were political designations: black being lower class while white being higher class. Constantin Zuckerman argues that these &quot;had physical and racial differences and explained that they stemmed from the merger of the Khazars with the Barsils.&quot; Old East Slavic sources called the Khazars the &quot;White Ugry&quot; and the Magyars the &quot;Black Ugry.&quot; Soviet excavated Khazar remains show Slavic-type, European-type, and a minority Mongoloid-type skulls.

The Yenisei Kyrgyz are mentioned in the &quot;New Book of Tang&quot; as having the same script and language as the Uyghurs but &quot;The people are all tall and
big and have red hair, white faces, and green eyes.&quot; The &quot;New Book of Tang&quot; also states that the neighboring Boma tribe resembled the Kyrgyz but their language was different, which may imply the Kyrgyz were originally a non-Turkic people, who were later Turkicized through inter-tribal marriages. According to Gardizi, the Kyrgyz were mixed with &quot;Saqlabs&quot; (Slavs), which explains the red hair and white skin among the Kyrgyz, while the &quot;New Book&quot; states that the Kyrgyz &quot;intermixed with the Dingling.&quot; The Kyrgyz &quot;regarded those with black eyes as descending from [Li] Ling,&quot; a Han dynasty general who defected to the Xiongnu.

In a Chinese legal statute from the early period of the Ming dynasty, the Kipchaks are described as having blond hair and blue eyes. It also states that they had a &quot;vile&quot; and &quot;peculiar&quot; appearance, and that some Chinese people would not want to marry them. Russian anthropologist Oshanin (1964: 24, 32) notes that &quot;the &#x27;Mongoloid&#x27; phenotype, characteristic of modern Kazakhs and Qirghiz, prevails among the skulls of the Qipchaq and Pecheneg nomads found in the kurgans in eastern Ukraine&quot;; Lee &amp; Kuang (2017) propose that Oshanin&#x27;s discovery is explainable by assuming that the historical Kipchaks&#x27; modern descendants are Kazakhs of the Lesser Horde, whose men possess a high frequency of haplogroup C2&#x27;s subclade C2b1b1 (59.7 to 78%). Lee and Kuang also suggest that the high frequency (63.9%) of the Y-DNA haplogroup R-M73 among Karakypshaks (a tribe within the Kipchaks) allows inference about the genetics of Karakypshaks&#x27; medieval ancestors, thus explaining why some medieval Kipchaks were described as possessing &quot;blue [or green] eyes and red hair.

Byzantine historians of the 11th-12th centuries provided description of Turkmens as very different from the Greeks. Bertrandon de la Broqui√®re, a French traveller to the Ottoman Empire, met with sultan Murad II in Adrianople, and described him in the following terms: &quot;In the first place, as I have seen him frequently, I shall say that he is a little, short, thick man, with the physiognomy of a Tartar. He has a broad and brown face, high cheek bones, a round beard, a great and crooked nose, with little eyes&quot;.

== International organizations ==

There are several international organizations created with the purpose of furthering cooperation between countries with Turkic-speaking populations, such as the Joint Administration of Turkic Arts and Culture (T√úRKSOY) and the Parliamentary Assembly of Turkic-speaking Countries (T√úRKPA) and the Turkic Council.

The TAKM ‚Äì Organization of the Eurasian Law Enforcement Agencies with Military Status, was established on 25 January 2013. It is an intergovernmental military law enforcement (gendarmerie) organization of currently three Turkic countries (Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan and Turkey) and Kazakhstan as observer.

=== T√úRKSOY ===
T√ºrksoy carries out activities to strengthen cultural ties between Turkic peoples. One of the main goals to transmit their common cultural heritage to future generations and promote it around the world.

Every year, one city in the Turkic world is selected as the &quot;Cultural Capital of the Turkic World&quot;. Within the framework of events to celebrate the Cultural Capital of the Turkic World, numerous cultural events are held, gathering artists, scholars and intellectuals, giving them the opportunity to exchange their experiences, as well as promoting the city in question internationally.

=== Organization of Turkic States ===
The Organization of Turkic States, founded on 3 November 2009, by the &quot;Nakhchivan Agreement&quot; confederation, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Turkey, aims to integrate these organizations into a tighter geopolitical framework.

The member countries are Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkey and Uzbekistan. The idea of setting up this cooperative council was first put forward by Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev back in 2006. Hungary has announced to be interested in joining the Organization of Turkic States. Since August 2018, Hungary has official observer status in the Organization of Turkic States. Turkmenistan also joined as an observer state to the organization at 8th summit. Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus was admitted to the organization as observer member at the 2022 Samarkand Summit.

== Demographics ==

The distribution of people of Turkic cultural background ranges from Siberia, across Central Asia, to Southern Europe. the largest groups of Turkic people live throughout Central Asia‚ÄîKazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Azerbaijan, in addition to Turkey and Iran. Additionally, Turkic people are found within Crimea, Altishahr region of western China, northern Iraq, Israel, Russia, Afghanistan, Cyprus, and the Balkans: Moldova, Bulgaria, Romania, Greece and former Yugoslavia.

A small number of Turkic people also live in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania. Small numbers inhabit eastern Poland and the south-eastern part of Finland. There are also considerable populations of Turkic people (originating mostly from Turkey) in Germany, United States, and Australia, largely because of migrations during the 20th century.

Sometimes ethnographers group Turkic people into six branches: the Oghuz Turks, Kipchak, Karluk, Siberian, Chuvash, and Sakha/Yakut branches. The Oghuz have been termed Western Turks, while the remaining five, in such a classificatory scheme, are called Eastern Turks.

The genetic distances between the different populations of Uzbeks scattered across Uzbekistan is no greater than the distance between many of them and the Karakalpaks. This suggests that Karakalpaks and Uzbeks have very similar origins. The Karakalpaks have a somewhat greater bias towards the eastern markers than the Uzbeks.

Historical population:

The following incomplete list of Turkic people shows the respective groups&#x27; core areas of settlement and their estimated sizes (in millions):
== Cuisine ==
Markets in the steppe region had a limited range of foodstuffs available‚Äîmostly grains, dried fruits, spices, and tea. Turks mostly herded sheep, goats and horses. Dairy was a staple of the nomadic diet and there are many Turkic words for various dairy products such as &quot;s√ºt&quot; (milk), &quot;yagh&quot; (butter), ayran, &quot;qaymaq&quot; (similar to clotted cream), qiÃÖmiÃÖz (fermented mare&#x27;s milk) and &quot;qurut&quot; (dried yoghurt). During the Middle Ages Kazakh, Kyrgyz and Tatars, who were historically part of the Turkic nomadic group known as the Golden Horde, continued to develop new variations of dairy products.

Nomadic Turks cooked their meals in a &quot;qazan&quot;, a pot similar to a cauldron; a wooden rack called a &quot;qasqan&quot; can be used to prepare certain steamed foods, like the traditional meat dumplings called &quot;manti&quot;. They also used a &quot;saj&quot;, a griddle that was traditionally placed on stones over a fire, and &quot;shish&quot;. In later times, the Persian tava was borrowed from the Persians for frying, but traditionally nomadic Turks did most of their cooking using the qazan, saj and shish. Meals were served in a bowl, called a &quot;chanaq&quot;, and eaten with a knife (&quot;b√Øchaq&quot;) and spoon (&quot;qashiÃÖq&quot;). Both bowl and spoon were historically made from wood. Other traditional utensils used in food preparation included a thin rolling pin called &quot;oqlaghu&quot;, a colander called &quot;s√ºzguÃÖ√ßh&quot;, and a grinding stone called &quot;tƒÅgirmƒÅn&quot;.

Medieval grain dishes included preparations of whole grains, soups, porridges, breads and pastries. Fried or toasted whole grains were called &quot;qaw√Ørmach&quot;, while &quot;k√∂ch√§&quot; was crushed grain that was cooked with dairy products. &quot;Salma&quot; were broad noodles that could be served with boiled or roasted meat; cut noodles were called &quot;tutmaj&quot; in the Middle Ages and are called &quot;kesme&quot; today.

There are many types of bread doughs in Turkic cuisine. &quot;Yupqa&quot; is the thinnest type of dough, &quot;bawiÃÖrsaq&quot; is a type of fried bread dough, and &quot;ch√§lp√§k&quot; is a deep fried flat bread. &quot;Qatlama&quot; is a fried bread that may be sprinkled with dried fruit or meat, rolled, and sliced like pinwheel sandwiches. &quot;Toqach&quot; and &quot;ch√∂r√§k&quot; are varieties of bread, and b√∂r√§k is a type of filled pie pastry.

Herd animals were usually slaughtered during the winter months and various types of sausages were prepared to preserve the meats, including a type of sausage called &quot;sujuk&quot;. Though prohibited by Islamic dietary restrictions, historically Turkic nomads also had a variety of blood sausage. One type of sausage, called &quot;qaziÃÖ&quot;, was made from horsemeat and another variety was filled with a mixture of ground meat, offal and rice. Chopped meat was called &quot;q√Øyma&quot; and spit-roasted meat was &quot;s√∂kl√ºnch&quot;‚Äîfrom the root &quot;s√∂k-&quot; meaning &quot;to tear off&quot;, the latter dish is known as kebab in modern times. &quot;Qawirma&quot; is a typical fried meat dish, and &quot;kullama&quot; is a soup of noodles and lamb.

== Religion ==
=== Early Turkic mythology and Tengrism ===

Early Turkic mythology was dominated by Shamanism, Animism and Tengrism. The Turkic animistic traditions were mostly focused on ancestor worship, polytheistic-animism and shamanism. Later this animistic tradition would form the more organized Tengrism. The chief deity was Tengri, a sky god, worshipped by the upper classes of early Turkic society until Manichaeism was introduced as the official religion of the Uyghur Empire in 763.

The wolf symbolizes honour and is also considered the mother of most Turkic peoples. Ashina is the wolf mother of Tumen Il-Qaƒüan, the first Khan of the G√∂kt√ºrks. The horse and predatory birds, such as the eagle or falcon, are also main figures of Turkic mythology.

=== Religious conversions ===

==== Buddhism ====
Buddhism played an important role in the history of Turkic peoples, with the first Turkic state adopting and supporting the spread of Buddhism being the Turkic Shahis and the G√∂kt√ºrks. The G√∂kt√ºrks syncretized Buddhism with their traditional religion Tengrism and also incorporated elements of the Iranian traditional religions, such as Zoroastrianism. Buddhism had its height among the Uyghurs in the Xinjiang region. Buddhism had also considerable impact and influence onto various other historical Turkic groups. In pre-Islamic times, Buddhism and Tengrism coexisted, with several Buddhist temples, monasteries, figures and steles, with images of Buddhist characters and sceneries, were constructed by various Turkic tribes. Throughout Kazakhstan, there exist various historical Buddhist sites, including an underground Buddhist cave monastery. After the Arab conquest of Central Asia, and the spread of Islam among locals, Buddhism (and Tengrism) started to lose ground, however a certain influence of the Buddhist teachings remained during the next centuries.

Tengri B√∂g√º Khan initially made the now extinct Manichaeism the state religion of the Uyghur Khaganate in 763 and it was also popular among the Karluks. It was gradually replaced by the Mahayana Buddhism. It existed in the Buddhist Uyghur Gaochang up to the 12th century.

Tibetan Buddhism, or Vajrayana was the main religion after Manichaeism. They worshipped T√§≈ãri T√§≈ãrisi Burxan, Quan≈°√Ø Im Pusar and Maitri Burxan. Turkic Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent and west Xinjiang attributed with a rapid and almost total disappearance of it and other religions in North India and Central Asia. The Sari Uygurs &quot;Yellow Yughurs&quot; of Western China, as well as the Tuvans of Russia are the only remaining Buddhist Turkic peoples.

==== Islam ====

Most Turkic people today are Sunni Muslims, although a significant number in Turkey are Alevis. Alevi Turks, who were once primarily dwelling in eastern Anatolia, are today concentrated in major urban centers in western Turkey with the increased urbanism. Turkic Sunni Muslims generally follow the Hanafi rite. Azeris are traditionally Shiite Muslims. Religious observance is less strict in the Republic of Azerbaijan compared to Iranian Azerbaijan.

 Islam first made contact with the Turkic peoples in 642, when Muslim armies crossed the Amu Darya after toppling the Sassanid Empire the year before. Some of the earliest rulers to convert to Islam were the Turkic princes of the city-states in the region of Sogdiana. Mass conversions did not take place until the Battle of Talas in 751, in which Turkic tribes sided with the Arabs against Chinese forces, which marked a significant milestone in the history of Islam in the region. From then onwards much of the Turkic heartland became Muslim. In the 19th century, Turkic Muslim progressives in the Russian Empire spearheaded a reformist movement called Jadidism, calling for a return to basic Islamic beliefs while simultaneously accepting modernist trends.

==== Christianity ====

The major Christian-Turkic peoples are the Chuvash of Chuvashia and the Gagauz (&quot;G√∂koƒüuz&quot;) of Moldova, the vast majority of Chuvash and the Gagauz are Eastern Orthodox Christians. The traditional religion of the Chuvash of Russia, while containing many ancient Turkic concepts, also shares some elements with Zoroastrianism, Khazar Judaism, and Islam.
The Chuvash converted to Eastern Orthodox Christianity for the most part in the second half of the 19th century. As a result, festivals and rites were made to coincide with Orthodox feasts, and Christian rites replaced their traditional counterparts. A minority of the Chuvash still profess their traditional faith. Between the 9th and 14th centuries, Church of the East was popular among Turks such as the Naimans. It even revived in Gaochang and expanded in Xinjiang in the Yuan dynasty period. It disappeared after its collapse.

Kryashens are a sub-group of the Volga Tatars, and the vast majority are Orthodox Christians. Naƒüayb√§k are an indigenous Turkic people in Russia, most Naƒüayb√§k are Christian and were largely converted during the 18th century. Many Volga Tatars were Christianized by Ivan the Terrible during the 16th century, and continued to Christianized under subsequent Russian rulers and Orthodox clergy up to the mid-eighteenth century.

==== Animism ====
Today there are several groups that support a revival of the ancient traditions. Especially after the collapse of the Soviet Union, many in Central Asia converted or openly practice animistic and shamanistic rituals. It is estimated that about 60% of Kyrgyz people practice a form of animistic rituals. In Kazakhstan there are about 54,000 followers of the ancient traditions.

==== Muslim Turks and non-Muslim Turks ====

The Uyghur Turks, who once belonged to a variety of religions, were gradually Islamized during a period spanning the 10th and 13th centuries. Some scholars have linked the phenomenon of recently Islamized Uyghur soldiers recruited by the Mongol Empire to the slow conversion of Uyghur populations to Islam.

The non-Muslim Turks&#x27; worship of Tengri and other gods was mocked and insulted by the Muslim Turk Mahmud al-Kashgari, who wrote a verse referring to them ‚Äì &quot;The Infidels ‚Äì May God destroy them!&quot;

The Basmil, YabƒÅ·∏≥u and Uyghur states were among the Turkic peoples who fought against the Kara-Khanids spread of Islam. The Islamic Kara-Khanids were made out of Tukhsi, Yaghma, √áiƒüil and Karluk.

Kashgari claimed that the Prophet assisted in a miraculous event where 700,000 YabƒÅqu infidels were defeated by 40,000 Muslims led by ArslƒÅn Tegƒ´n claiming that fires shot sparks from gates located on a green mountain towards the YabƒÅqu. The Yabaqu were a Turkic people.

Mahmud al-Kashgari insulted the Uyghur Buddhists as &quot;Uighur dogs&quot; and called them &quot;Tats&quot;, which referred to the &quot;Uighur infidels&quot; according to the Tuxsi and Taghma, while other Turks called Persians &quot;tat&quot;. While Kashgari displayed a different attitude towards the Turks diviners beliefs and &quot;national customs&quot;, he expressed towards Buddhism a hatred in his Diwan where he wrote the verse cycle on the war against Uighur Buddhists. Buddhist origin words like toyin (a cleric or priest) and BurxƒÅn or Furxan (meaning Buddha, acquiring the generic meaning of &quot;idol&quot; in the Turkic language of Kashgari) had negative connotations to Muslim Turks. 
== Old sports ==
=== Tepuk ===
Mahmud al-Kashgari in his &quot;Dƒ´wƒÅn LughƒÅt al-Turk&quot;, described a game called &quot;tepuk&quot; among Turks in Central Asia. In the game, people try to attack each other&#x27;s castle by kicking a ball made of sheep leather. (see also: Cuju)

=== Kyz kuu ===
Kyz kuu (chase the girl) has been played by Turkic people at festivals since time immemorial.

=== Jereed ===
Horses have been essential and even sacred animals for Turks living as nomadic tribes in the Central Asian steppes. Turks were born, grew up, lived, fought and died on horseback. Jereed became the most important sporting and ceremonial game of Turkish people.

=== Kokpar ===
The kokpar began with the nomadic Turkic peoples who have come from farther north and east spreading westward from China and Mongolia between the 10th and 15th centuries.

=== Jigit ===
&quot;jigit&quot; is used in the Caucasus and Central Asia to describe a skillful and brave equestrian, or a brave person in general.

<doc id="44743" wikidata="Q132805" url="?curid=44743" title="Thomas Hardy">
<text>Thomas Hardy (2 June 1840 ‚Äì 11 January 1928) was an English novelist and poet. A Victorian realist in the tradition of George Eliot, he was influenced both in his novels and in his poetry by Romanticism, including the poetry of William Wordsworth. He was highly critical of much in Victorian society, especially on the declining status of rural people in Britain such as those from his native South West England.

While Hardy wrote poetry throughout his life and regarded himself primarily as a poet, his first collection was not published until 1898. Initially, he gained fame as the author of novels such as &quot;Far from the Madding Crowd&quot; (1874), &quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge&quot; (1886), &quot;Tess of the d&#x27;Urbervilles&quot; (1891) and &quot;Jude the Obscure&quot; (1895). During his lifetime, Hardy&#x27;s poetry was acclaimed by younger poets (particularly the Georgians) who viewed him as a mentor. After his death his poems were lauded by Ezra Pound, W. H. Auden and Philip Larkin.

Many of his novels concern tragic characters struggling against their passions and social circumstances, and they are often set in the semi-fictional region of Wessex; initially based on the medieval Anglo-Saxon kingdom, Hardy&#x27;s Wessex eventually came to include the counties of Dorset, Wiltshire, Somerset, Devon, Hampshire and much of Berkshire, in south-west and south central England. Two of his novels, &quot;Tess of the d&#x27;Urbervilles&quot; and &quot;Far from the Madding Crowd&quot;, were listed in the top 50 on the BBC&#x27;s survey The Big Read.

==Life and career==
=== Early life ===

Thomas Hardy was born on 2 June 1840 in Higher Bockhampton (then Upper Bockhampton), a hamlet in the parish of Stinsford to the east of Dorchester in Dorset, England, where his father Thomas (1811‚Äì1892) worked as a stonemason and local builder. His parents had married at Melbury Osmond on 22 December 1839. His mother, Jemima (n√©e Hand; 1813‚Äì1904), was well read, and she educated Thomas until he went to his first school at Bockhampton at the age of eight. For several years he attended Mr. Last&#x27;s Academy for Young Gentlemen in Dorchester, where he learned Latin and demonstrated academic potential.

Because Hardy&#x27;s family lacked the means for a university education, his formal education ended at the age of sixteen, when he became apprenticed to James Hicks, a local architect. He worked on the design of the new church at nearby Athelhampton, situated just opposite Athelhampton House where he painted a watercolour of the Tudor gatehouse while visiting his father, who was repairing the masonry of the dovecote.

He moved to London in 1862 where he enrolled as a student at King&#x27;s College London. He won prizes from the Royal Institute of British Architects and the Architectural Association. He joined Arthur Blomfield&#x27;s practice as assistant architect in April 1862 and worked with Blomfield on Christ Church, East Sheen Richmond, London where the tower collapsed in 1863, and All Saints&#x27; parish church in Windsor, Berkshire, in 1862‚Äì64. A reredos, possibly designed by Hardy, was discovered behind panelling at All Saints&#x27; in August 2016. In the mid-1860s, Hardy was in charge of the excavation of part of the graveyard of St Pancras Old Church before its destruction when the Midland Railway was extended to a new terminus at St Pancras.

Hardy never felt at home in London, because he was acutely conscious of class divisions and his own feelings of social inferiority. During this time he became interested in social reform and the works of John Stuart Mill. He was introduced by his Dorset friend Horace Moule to the works of Charles Fourier and Auguste Comte. Mill&#x27;s essay &quot;On Liberty&quot; was one of Hardy&#x27;s cures for despair, and in 1924 he declared that &quot;my pages show harmony of view with&quot; Mill. He was also attracted to Matthew Arnold&#x27;s and Leslie Stephen&#x27;s ideal of the urbane liberal freethinker.

After five years, concerned about his health, he returned to Dorset, settling in Weymouth, and decided to dedicate himself to writing.

=== Personal ===

In 1870, while on an architectural mission to restore the parish church of St Juliot in Cornwall, Hardy met and fell in love with Emma Gifford, whom he married on 17 September 1874, at St Peter&#x27;s Church, Paddington, London. The couple rented St David&#x27;s Villa, Southborough (now Surbiton) for a year. In 1885 Thomas and his wife moved into Max Gate in Dorchester, a house designed by Hardy and built by his brother. Although they became estranged, Emma&#x27;s death in 1912 had a traumatic effect on him and Hardy made a trip to Cornwall after her death to revisit places linked with their courtship; his &quot;Poems 1912‚Äì13&quot; reflect upon her death. In 1914, Hardy married his secretary Florence Emily Dugdale, who was 39 years his junior. He remained preoccupied with his first wife&#x27;s death and tried to overcome his remorse by writing poetry.

In his later years, he kept a Wire Fox Terrier named Wessex, who was notoriously ill-tempered. Wessex&#x27;s grave stone can be found on the Max Gate grounds.

In 1910 Hardy was appointed a Member of the Order of Merit and was also for the first time nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature. He was nominated again for the prize 11 years later and by 1927 had received a total of 25 nominations. In 1923 he was one of the final candidates for the prize, but did not win.

=== Hardy and the theatre ===
Hardy&#x27;s interest in the theatre dated from the 1860s. He corresponded with various would-be adapters over the years, including Robert Louis Stevenson in 1886 and Jack Grein and Charles Jarvis in the same decade. Neither adaptation came to fruition, but Hardy showed he was potentially enthusiastic about such a project. One play that was performed, however, caused him a certain amount of pain. His experience of the controversy and lukewarm critical reception that had surrounded his and Comyns Carr&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Far from the Madding Crowd&quot; in 1882 left him wary of the damage that adaptations could do to his literary reputation. So, in 1908, he so readily and enthusiastically became involved with a local amateur group, at the time known as the Dorchester Dramatic and Debating Society, but that would become the Hardy Players. His reservations about adaptations of his novels meant he was initially at some pains to disguise his involvement in the play. However, the international success of the play, &quot;The Trumpet Major&quot;, led to a long and successful collaboration between Hardy and the Players over the remaining years of his life. Indeed, his play &quot;The Famous Tragedy of the Queen of Cornwall at Tintagel in Lyonnesse&quot; (1923) was written to be performed by the Hardy Players.

=== Later years ===
From the 1880s, Hardy became increasingly involved in campaigns to save ancient buildings from destruction, or destructive modernisation, and he became an early member of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings. His correspondence refers to his unsuccessful efforts to prevent major alterations to the parish church at Puddletown, close to his home at Max Gate. He became a frequent visitor at Athelhampton House, which he knew from his teenage years, and in his letters he encouraged the owner, Alfred Cart de Lafontaine, to conduct the restoration of that building in a sensitive way.

In 1914, Hardy was one of 53 leading British authors‚Äîincluding H. G. Wells, Rudyard Kipling and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle‚Äîwho signed their names to the &quot;Authors&#x27; Declaration&quot;, justifying Britain&#x27;s involvement in the First World War. This manifesto declared that the German invasion of Belgium had been a brutal crime, and that Britain &quot;could not without dishonour have refused to take part in the present war.&quot; Hardy was horrified by the destruction caused by the war, pondering that &quot;I do not think a world in which such fiendishness is possible to be worth the saving&quot; and &quot;better to let western &#x27;civilization&#x27; perish, and let the black and yellow races have a chance.&quot; He wrote to John Galsworthy that &quot;the exchange of international thought is the only possible salvation for the world.&quot;

Shortly after helping to excavate the Fordington mosaic, Hardy became ill with pleurisy in December 1927 and died at Max Gate just after 9¬†pm on 11¬†January 1928, having dictated his final poem to his wife on his deathbed; the cause of death was cited, on his death certificate, as &quot;cardiac syncope&quot;, with &quot;old age&quot; given as a contributory factor. His funeral was on 16 January at Westminster Abbey, and it proved a controversial occasion because Hardy had wished for his body to be interred at Stinsford in the same grave as his first wife, Emma. His family and friends concurred; however, his executor, Sir¬†Sydney Carlyle Cockerell, insisted that he be placed in the abbey&#x27;s famous Poets&#x27; Corner. A compromise was reached whereby his heart was buried at Stinsford with Emma, and his ashes in Poets&#x27; Corner. Hardy&#x27;s estate at death was valued at ¬£95,418 ().

Shortly after Hardy&#x27;s death, the executors of his estate burnt his letters and notebooks, but twelve notebooks survived, one of them containing notes and extracts of newspaper stories from the 1820s, and research into these has provided insight into how Hardy used them in his works. The opening chapter of &quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge&quot;, for example, written in 1886, was based on press reports of wife-selling. In the year of his death Mrs Hardy published &quot;The Early Life of Thomas Hardy, 1841‚Äì1891&quot;, compiled largely from contemporary notes, letters, diaries and biographical memoranda, as well as from oral information in conversations extending over many years.

Hardy&#x27;s work was admired by many younger writers, including D. H. Lawrence, John Cowper Powys and Virginia Woolf. In his autobiography &quot;Good-Bye to All That&quot; (1929), Robert Graves recalls meeting Hardy in Dorset in the early 1920s and how Hardy received him and his new wife warmly, and was encouraging about his work.

Hardy&#x27;s birthplace in Bockhampton and his house Max Gate, both in Dorchester, are owned by the National Trust.

==Novels==

Hardy&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Poor Man and the Lady&quot;, finished by 1867, failed to find a publisher. He then showed it to his mentor and friend, the Victorian poet and novelist George Meredith, who felt that &quot;The Poor Man and the Lady&quot; would be too politically controversial and might damage Hardy&#x27;s ability to publish in the future. So Hardy followed his advice and he did not try further to publish it. He subsequently destroyed the manuscript, but used some of the ideas in his later work. In his recollections in &quot;Life and Work&quot;, Hardy described the book as &quot;socialistic, not to say revolutionary; yet not argumentatively so.&quot;

After he abandoned his first novel, Hardy wrote two new ones that he hoped would have more commercial appeal, &quot;Desperate Remedies&quot; (1871) and &quot;Under the Greenwood Tree&quot; (1872), both of which were published anonymously; it was while working on the latter that he met Emma Gifford, who would become his wife. In 1873 &quot;A Pair of Blue Eyes&quot;, a novel drawing on Hardy&#x27;s courtship of Emma, was published under his own name. A plot device popularised by Charles Dickens, the term &quot;cliffhanger&quot; is considered to have originated with the serialised version of &quot;A Pair of Blue Eyes&quot; (published in &quot;Tinsley&#x27;s Magazine&quot; between September 1872 and July 1873) in which Henry Knight, one of the protagonists, is left literally hanging off a cliff. Elements of Hardy&#x27;s fiction reflect the influence of the commercially successful sensation fiction of the 1860s, particularly the legal complications in novels such as &quot;Desperate Remedies&quot; (1871), &quot;Far from the Madding Crowd&quot; (1874) and &quot;Two on a Tower&quot; (1882).

In &quot;Far from the Madding Crowd&quot;, Hardy first introduced the idea of calling the region in the west of England, where his novels are set, Wessex. Wessex had been the name of an early Saxon kingdom, in approximately the same part of England. &quot;Far from the Madding Crowd&quot; was successful enough for Hardy to give up architectural work and pursue a literary career. Over the next 25 years, Hardy produced 10 more novels.

Subsequently, Hardy moved from London to Yeovil, and then to Sturminster Newton, where he wrote &quot;The Hand of Ethelberta&quot; (1876) and &quot;The Return of the Native&quot; (1878). In 1880, Hardy published his only historical novel, &quot;The Trumpet-Major&quot;. The next year, in 1881, &quot;A Laodicean&quot; was published. A further move to Wimborne saw Hardy write &quot;Two on a Tower&quot;, published in 1882, a romance story set in the world of astronomy. Then in 1885, they moved for the last time, to Max Gate, a house outside Dorchester designed by Hardy and built by his brother. There he wrote &quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge&quot; (1886), &quot;The Woodlanders&quot; (1887) and &quot;Tess of the d&#x27;Urbervilles&quot; (1891), the last of which attracted criticism for its sympathetic portrayal of a &quot;fallen woman&quot;, and initially it was refused publication. Its subtitle, &quot;A Pure Woman: Faithfully Presented&quot;, was intended to raise the eyebrows of the Victorian middle classes.
&quot;Jude the Obscure&quot;, published in 1895, was the last novel written by Hardy. It was met with an even stronger negative response from the Victorian public because of its controversial treatment of sex, religion and marriage. Its apparent attack on the institution of marriage caused strain on Hardy&#x27;s already difficult marriage because Emma Hardy was concerned that &quot;Jude the Obscure&quot; would be read as autobiographical. Some booksellers sold the novel in brown paper bags, and Walsham How, the Bishop of Wakefield, is reputed to have burnt his copy. In his postscript of 1912, Hardy humorously referred to this incident as part of the career of the book: &quot;After these [hostile] verdicts from the press its next misfortune was to be burnt by a bishop ‚Äì probably in his despair at not being able to burn me&quot;. Despite this, Hardy had become a celebrity by the 1900s, but some argue that he gave up writing novels because of the criticism of both &quot;Tess of the d&#x27;Urbervilles&quot; and &quot;Jude the Obscure&quot;. However, in a March 1928 piece in the &quot;Bookman&quot; that posthumously printed interviews with Hardy, he is quoted as saying that, in addition to the negative publicity, he chose to stop writing novels because &quot;I never cared very much about writing novels&quot; and &quot;I had written quite enough novels.&quot; 

&quot;The Well-Beloved&quot;, first serialised in 1892 and written before &quot;Jude the Obscure&quot;, was the last of Hardy&#x27;s fourteen novels to be published, in 1897.

==Literary themes==

Considered a Victorian realist, Hardy examines the social constraints on the lives of those living in Victorian England, and criticises those beliefs, especially those relating to marriage, education and religion, that limited people&#x27;s lives and caused unhappiness. Such unhappiness, and the suffering it brings, is seen by poet Philip Larkin as central in Hardy&#x27;s works:

In &quot;Two on a Tower&quot;, for example, Hardy takes a stand against these rules of society with a story of love that crosses the boundaries of class. The reader is forced to reconsider the conventions set up by society for the relationships between men and women. Nineteenth-century society had conventions, which were enforced. In this novel Swithin St Cleeve&#x27;s idealism pits him against such contemporary social constraints.

Fate or chance is another important theme. Hardy&#x27;s characters often encounter crossroads on a journey, a junction that offers alternative physical destinations but which is also symbolic of a point of opportunity and transition, further suggesting that fate is at work. &quot;Far from the Madding Crowd&quot; is an example of a novel in which chance has a major role: &quot;Had Bathsheba not sent the valentine, had Fanny not missed her wedding, for example, the story would have taken an entirely different path.&quot; Indeed, Hardy&#x27;s main characters often seem to be held in fate&#x27;s overwhelming grip.

==Poetry==

In 1898, Hardy published his first volume of poetry, &quot;Wessex Poems&quot;, a collection of poems written over 30 years. While some suggest that Hardy gave up writing novels following the harsh criticism of &quot;Jude the Obscure&quot; in 1896, the poet C. H. Sisson calls this &quot;hypothesis&quot; &quot;superficial and absurd&quot;. In the twentieth century Hardy published only poetry.

Thomas Hardy published &quot;Poems of the Past and the Present&quot; in 1901, which contains &quot;The Darkling Thrush&quot; (originally titled &quot;The Century&#x27;s End&quot;), one of his best known poems about the turn of the century.

Thomas Hardy wrote in a great variety of poetic forms, including lyrics, ballads, satire, dramatic monologues and dialogue, as well as a three-volume epic closet drama &quot;The Dynasts&quot; (1904‚Äì08), and though in some ways a very traditional poet, because he was influenced by folksong and ballads, he &quot;was never conventional,&quot; and &quot;persistently experiment[ed] with different, often invented, stanza forms and metres,&quot; and made use of &quot;rough-hewn rhythms and colloquial diction&quot;.

In a re-evaluation of &quot;The Dynasts&quot; in 2006 Keith Wilson wrote, &quot;&quot;The Dynasts&quot;, this unusual work that allowed him [Hardy] to explore what he had noticed about human beings over the most ambitious canvas that he had ever attempted, should stand among his greatest achievements.&quot;

Hardy wrote a number of significant war poems that relate to both the Boer Wars and World War I, including &quot;Drummer Hodge&quot;, &quot;In Time of &#x27;The Breaking of Nations&#x27;&quot; and &quot;The Man He Killed&quot;; his work had a profound influence on other war poets such as Rupert Brooke and Siegfried Sassoon. Hardy in these poems often used the viewpoint of ordinary soldiers and their colloquial speech. A theme in the &quot;Wessex Poems&quot; is the long shadow that the Napoleonic Wars cast over the 19th century, as seen, for example, in &quot;The Sergeant&#x27;s Song&quot; and &quot;Leipzig&quot;. The Napoleonic War is the subject of &quot;The Dynasts&quot;.

Some of Hardy&#x27;s more famous poems are from &quot;Poems 1912‚Äì13&quot;, which later became part of &quot;Satires of Circumstance&quot; (1914), written following the death of his wife Emma in 1912. They had been estranged for 20 years, and these lyric poems express deeply felt &quot;regret and remorse&quot;. Poems like &quot;After a Journey&quot;, &quot;The Voice&quot; and others from this collection &quot;are by general consent regarded as the peak of his poetic achievement&quot;. In a 2007 biography on Hardy, Claire Tomalin argues that Hardy became a truly great English poet after the death of his first wife Emma, beginning with these elegies, which she describes as among &quot;the finest and strangest celebrations of the dead in English poetry.&quot;
Many of Hardy&#x27;s poems deal with themes of disappointment in love and life, and &quot;the perversity of fate&quot;, presenting these themes with &quot;a carefully controlled elegiac feeling&quot;. Irony is an important element in a number of Hardy&#x27;s poems, including &quot;The Man He Killed&quot; and &quot;Are You Digging on My Grave&quot;. A few of Hardy&#x27;s poems, such as &quot;The Blinded Bird&quot;, a melancholy polemic against the sport of , reflect his firm stance against animal cruelty, exhibited in his antivivisectionist views and his membership in the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

Although his poems were initially not as well received as his novels had been, Hardy is now recognised as one of the great poets of the 20th century, and his verse had a profound influence on later writers, including Robert Frost, W. H. Auden, Dylan Thomas and Philip Larkin. Larkin included 27 poems by Hardy compared with only nine by T. S. Eliot in his edition of &quot;The Oxford Book of Twentieth Century English Verse&quot; in 1973. There were fewer poems by W. B. Yeats. Poet-critic Donald Davie&#x27;s &quot;Thomas Hardy and English Poetry&quot; considers Hardy&#x27;s contribution to ongoing poetic tradition at length and in creative depth. Davie&#x27;s friend Thom Gunn also wrote on Hardy and acknowledged his stature and example.

==Religious beliefs==

Hardy&#x27;s family was Anglican, but not especially devout. He was baptised at the age of five weeks and attended church, where his father and uncle contributed to music. He did not attend the local Church of England school, instead being sent to Mr Last&#x27;s school, three miles away. As a young adult, he befriended Henry R. Bastow (a Plymouth Brethren man), who also worked as a pupil architect, and who was preparing for adult baptism in the Baptist Church. Hardy flirted with conversion, but decided against it. Bastow went to Australia and maintained a long correspondence with Hardy, but eventually Hardy tired of these exchanges and the correspondence ceased. This concluded Hardy&#x27;s links with the Baptists.

The irony and struggles of life, coupled with his naturally curious mind, led him to question the traditional Christian view of God: 
Scholars have debated Hardy&#x27;s religious leanings for years, often unable to reach a consensus. Once, when asked in correspondence by a clergyman, Dr. A. B. Grosart, about the question of reconciling the horrors of human and animal life with &quot;the absolute goodness and non-limitation of God&quot;, Hardy replied,

Hardy frequently conceived of, and wrote about, supernatural forces, particularly those that control the universe through indifference or caprice, a force he called The Immanent Will. He also showed in his writing some degree of fascination with ghosts and spirits. Even so, he retained a strong emotional attachment to the Christian liturgy and church rituals, particularly as manifested in rural communities, that had been such a formative influence in his early years, and Biblical references can be found woven throughout many of Hardy&#x27;s novels.
Hardy&#x27;s friends during his apprenticeship to John Hicks included Horace Moule (one of the eight sons of Henry Moule) and the poet William Barnes, both ministers of religion. Moule remained a close friend of Hardy&#x27;s for the rest of his life, and introduced him to new scientific findings that cast doubt on literal interpretations of the Bible, such as those of Gideon Mantell. Moule gave Hardy a copy of Mantell&#x27;s book &quot;The Wonders of Geology&quot; (1848) in 1858, and Adelene Buckland has suggested that there are &quot;compelling similarities&quot; between the &quot;cliffhanger&quot; section from &quot;A Pair of Blue Eyes&quot; and Mantell&#x27;s geological descriptions. It has also been suggested that the character of Henry Knight in &quot;A Pair of Blue Eyes&quot; was based on Horace Moule.

Throughout his life, Hardy sought a rationale for believing in an afterlife or a timeless existence, turning first to spiritualists, such as Henri Bergson, and then to Albert Einstein and J. M. E. McTaggart, considering their philosophy on time and space in relation to immortality.

==Locations in novels==
Sites associated with Hardy&#x27;s own life and which inspired the settings of his novels continue to attract literary tourists and casual visitors. For locations in Hardy&#x27;s novels see: Thomas Hardy&#x27;s Wessex, and the Thomas Hardy&#x27;s Wessex research site, which includes maps.

==Influence==
Hardy corresponded with and visited Lady Catherine Milnes Gaskell at Wenlock Abbey and many of Lady Catherine&#x27;s books are inspired by Hardy, who was very fond of her.

D. H. Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;Study of Thomas Hardy&quot; (1914, first published 1936) indicates the importance of Hardy for him, even though this work is a platform for Lawrence&#x27;s own developing philosophy rather than a more standard literary study. The influence of Hardy&#x27;s treatment of character, and Lawrence&#x27;s own response to the central metaphysic behind many of Hardy&#x27;s novels, helped significantly in the development of &quot;The Rainbow&quot; (1915) and &quot;Women in Love&quot; (1920).

&quot;Wood and Stone&quot; (1915), the first novel by John Cowper Powys, who was a contemporary of Lawrence, was &quot;Dedicated with devoted admiration to the greatest poet and novelist of our age Thomas Hardy&quot;. Powys&#x27;s later novel &quot;Maiden Castle&quot; (1936) is set in Dorchester, which was Hardy&#x27;s Casterbridge, and was intended by Powys to be a &quot;rival&quot; to Hardy&#x27;s &quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge&quot;. &quot;Maiden Castle&quot; is the last of Powys&#x27;s so-called Wessex novels, &quot;Wolf Solent&quot; (1929), &quot;A Glastonbury Romance&quot; (1932) and &quot;Weymouth Sands&quot; (1934), which are set in Somerset and Dorset.

Hardy was clearly the starting point for the character of the novelist Edward Driffield in W. Somerset Maugham&#x27;s novel &quot;Cakes and Ale&quot; (1930). Thomas Hardy&#x27;s works also feature prominently in the American playwright Christopher Durang&#x27;s &quot;The Marriage of Bette and Boo&quot; (1985), in which a graduate thesis analysing &quot;Tess of the d&#x27;Urbervilles&quot; is interspersed with analysis of Matt&#x27;s family&#x27;s neuroses.

===Musical settings===
A number of notable English composers, including Gerald Finzi, Benjamin Britten, Ralph Vaughan Williams and Gustav Holst set poems by Hardy to music. Others include Holst&#x27;s daughter Imogen Holst, John Ireland, Muriel Herbert, Ivor Gurney and Robin Milford. Orchestral tone poems which evoke the landscape of Hardy&#x27;s novels include Ireland&#x27;s &quot;Mai-Dun&quot; (1921) and Holst&#x27;s &quot;Egdon Heath: A Homage to Thomas Hardy&quot; (1927).

Hardy has been a significant influence on Nigel Blackwell, frontman of the post-punk British rock band Half Man Half Biscuit, who has often incorporated phrases (some obscure) by or about Hardy into his song lyrics.

<doc id="44745" wikidata="Q29422" url="?curid=44745" title="Boca Raton, Florida">
<text>Boca Raton ( ; ) is a city in Palm Beach County, Florida, United States. The population was 97,422 in the 2020 census and it ranked as the 23rd-largest city in Florida in 2022. Many people with a Boca Raton postal address live outside of municipal boundaries, such as in West Boca Raton. As a business center, the city also experiences significant daytime population increases. Boca Raton is north of Miami and is a principal city of the Miami metropolitan area, which had a population of 6,138,333 at the 2020 United States census.

It was first incorporated on August 2, 1924 as &quot;Bocaratone&quot;, and then incorporated as &quot;Boca Raton&quot; on May 26, 1925. While the area had been inhabited by the Glades culture, as well as Spanish and later British colonial empires prior to its annexation by the United States, the city&#x27;s present form was developed predominantly by Addison Mizner starting in the 1920s. Mizner contributed to many buildings in the area having Mediterranean Revival or Spanish Colonial Revival architecture. Boca Raton also became a key city in the development of the early computer industry. The city is the birthplace of IBM&#x27;s first personal computer and various other technologies created by the company.

Still centered around luxury beach culture, the city today is dotted by many malls and shopping centers, including the Town Center at Boca Raton. The ODP Corporation, which operates Office Depot and OfficeMax, is headquartered here. Boca Raton is also home to the main campus of Florida Atlantic University and the Evert Tennis Academy, owned by former professional tennis player Chris Evert. The city has a strict development code for the size and types of commercial buildings, building signs, and advertisements that may be erected within the city limit, which has led to major thoroughfares without billboards and large advertisements, as well as increased green spaces on roads.

==Name==

===Etymology===
&quot;Boca Rat√≥n&quot; translates to &quot;Mouse Mouth&quot; in English. Its name was originally labeled in the early European maps of the area as . , meaning &quot;mouth&quot;, was a common term to describe an inlet on maps by sailors (as in a river mouth). The meaning of the word &quot;ratones&quot; for the area is less certain. Some claim that the word appears in old Spanish maritime dictionaries referring to &quot;rugged rocks or stony ground on the bottom of some ports and coastal outlets, where the cables rub against&quot;. Thus, one possible translation of &quot;Boca Raton&quot; is &quot;Rugged Inlet&quot;. Others claim that referred to pirates who hid out in the area, and thus the name could translate to &quot;Pirates&#x27; Inlet&quot;.

===Pronunciation===
City residents pronounce &quot;Raton&quot; as . People not from the region often mispronounce this as instead.

===Early history===
The area where Boca Raton is now located was originally occupied by the Glades culture, a Native American tribe of hunter-gatherers who relocated seasonally and between shellfish sources, distinct from the Tequesta to the south and the Jaega to the north.

What Spanish voyagers called &quot;Boca de Ratones&quot; was originally to the south, in present-day Biscayne Bay in Miami-Dade County. The area of Boca Raton was labeled &quot;Rio Seco&quot;, meaning &quot;Dry River&quot;, during this time. By mistake during the 19th century, mapmakers moved this location to the north and began referring to the city&#x27;s lake, today known as Lake Boca Raton, as &quot;Boca Ratone Lagoon&quot; and later &quot;Boca Ratone Sounde&quot;. An inland stream near the lake was later renamed Spanish River, and eventually became part of the Intracoastal Waterway.

When Spain surrendered Florida to Britain in 1763, the remaining Tequestas, along with other Indians who had taken refuge in the Florida Keys, were evacuated to Cuba. In the 1770s, Bernard Romans reported seeing abandoned villages in the area, but no inhabitants.

The area remained largely uninhabited for long afterwards, during the early years of Florida&#x27;s incorporation in the United States. The first significant European settler to this area was Captain Thomas Moore Rickards in 1895, who resided in a house made of driftwood on the east side of the East Coast Canal, south of what is now the Palmetto Park Road bridge. He surveyed and sold land from the canal to beyond the railroad north of what is now Palmetto Park Road. Early settlement in the area increased shortly after Henry Flagler&#x27;s expansion of the Florida East Coast Railway, connecting West Palm Beach to Miami.

===Addison Mizner&#x27;s resort town===
Boca Raton as a city was the creation of architect Addison Mizner. Prior to him, Boca Raton was an unincorporated farming town with a population of 100 in 1920.

In 1925, Mizner announced his plan for &quot;the foremost resort city on the North American continent,&quot; &quot;a new exclusive social capital in America.&quot; After spending several years in Palm Beach, where, in his own words, he &quot;did more than any one man to make the city beautiful,&quot; and designed the Everglades Club among many other buildings, in Boca Raton his plan was to create from scratch &quot;a resort as splendid in its entirety as Palm Beach is in spots.&quot;

Activity in that area began at least a year, and probably more, before Mizner&#x27;s announcement. Land acquisition, tens of thousands of acres, was the largest part. But it is hard not to see Mizner&#x27;s hand in the incorporation of Boca Raton in 1924; the city immediately appointed him Town Planner. The Mizner Development Company was incorporated in 1925, and promptly issued $5 million of stock, which was fully subscribed in less than a week. $500,000 was reserved for the &quot;average Floridian&quot;; the remainder was purchased by, as Addison called them, &quot;noted personages&quot;, all with a Palm Beach connection: Lytle Hall, Harold Vanderbilt, J. Leonard Repogle, the Duchess of Sutherland, Rodman Wanamaker, Paris Singer, Irving Berlin, Madame Frances Alda, W. C. Robinson, H. H. Rodgers, D. H. Conkling, A. T. Herd, Porte, William Kissam Vanderbilt II, Elizabeth Arden, Jesse Livermore, Clarence H. Geist, and T. Coleman du Pont as chairman. Addison&#x27;s brother Wilson also appears on the list of investors, but he had little to invest.

Instead of the existing Palmetto Park Road, the main street in Mizner&#x27;s Boca was to be El Camino Real, 20 lanes wide, which Mizner fancifully translated as &quot;The Royal Highway&quot;, referring to Spain&#x27;s road network and to the road to Santa Fe and to the Spanish missions in California. (Spanish kings rarely or never travelled on these roads; &quot;The Government Road&quot; would be just as accurate.) It was originally to be circular, with a lagoon in the middle. Soon it became, in the plans, Boca Raton&#x27;s main east‚Äìwest street, to be wide and with a canal for pleasure boats in the center. (In the drawing of it on the cover of Mizner Development&#x27;s first brochure is a Venetian gondola.) His statement that it was inspired by Botafogo, a neighborhood and beach in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is another of his many inventions of foreign &quot;facts&quot;. Mizner, who never went to Brazil nor knew Brazilians, simply made it up because the name &quot;Botafogo&quot; (&quot;fire thrower&quot;) sounded impressive, as was the concept of imitating Rio de Janeiro. (The only street in Rio de Janeiro anything like the supposed picture, actually an artist&#x27;s conception, of &quot;Botafogo&quot; that Mizner included in his first catalogue, is the :pt:Canal do Mangue, which runs down the middle of two streets, but is nowhere near Botafogo, a more elegant name than Mangue &quot;mangrove&quot;.)

Only of the road was built (although the street has subsequently been extended to the west at normal scale). According to drawings, the centerpiece of the street was to be a canal for pleasure boats; it was never built. All streets were to be at least wide.

His first buildings in Boca Raton were his Administrative Buildings, on El Camino Real (in 2018 the Addison Restaurant), and a small hotel to house interested investors. Mizner designed Boca&#x27;s first town hall/police station/fire station/library, although the design actually built is much smaller and less expensive than what Mizner planned. Today (2018) it is the Boca Raton History Museum, which houses Boca&#x27;s Welcome Center and the Boca Raton Historical Society.

The hotel was his Ritz-Carlton Cloister Inn, built in 1926, later renamed the Boca Raton Resort &amp; Club, and is one of the only &quot;5 star&quot; hotels in Florida. The 1969 addition of its &quot;pink tower&quot; hotel building is visible from miles away as a towering monument on the Intracoastal Waterway.

Because of the end of the Florida land boom of the 1920s and the 1926 Miami hurricane, the Mizner Development Corporation went into bankruptcy in 1927. Little of Mizner&#x27;s Boca Raton was ever built: his Administration Buildings, the Cloister Inn, 1/2 mile of El Camino Real, the small Dunagan Apartments (demolished), a few houses near the Cloister Inn (demolished), the Spanish Village neighborhood, and a few small houses in what is now the Old Floresta Historic District neighborhood.

===World War II Army Air Force Base===
During World War II, some of the land used by the Japanese farmers of the Yamato Colony was confiscated and used as the site of the Boca Raton Army Air Force Base, a major training facility for B-29 bomber crews and the only facility in the U.S. training radar operators. Much of the Boca Raton Army Airfield was later donated to Palm Beach County and became the grounds of Florida Atlantic University. Many of FAU&#x27;s parking lots are former runways of the airbase. When viewed from above, the site&#x27;s layout for its previous use as an airfield is plainly evident. Boca Raton Airport&#x27;s runway was once part of the original airbase, and is still active to this day, although the runway has been rebuilt. Army School Building #3 (T-604) of the Army Air Forces Base has survived as the office building for the Cynthia Gardens apartment complex on Northwest 4th Avenue.

===Post-World War II history===
Boca Raton was the site of two now vanished amusement parks, Africa U.S.A. (1953‚Äì1961) and Ancient America (1953‚Äì1959). Africa U.S.A. was a wild animal park in which tourists rode a &quot;Jeep Safari Train&quot; through the park. There were no fences separating the animals from the tourists. It is now the Camino Gardens subdivision one mile west of the Boca Raton Hotel. A red wooden bridge and remnants from the Watusi Geyser and Zambezi Falls, a 30-foot waterfall, from Africa USA can still be seen at the entrance to Camino Gardens. Ancient America was built surrounding a real Native American burial mound. Today, the mound is still visible within the Boca Marina &amp; Yacht Club neighborhood on U.S. 1 near Yamato Road.

====IBM====

In the late 1960s, IBM announced their intentions to open a manufacturing plant in the area. In 1965, well before the extension of I-95 into Southern Florida, IBM, working in secret with the Arvida corporation, quietly purchased several hundred acres of real estate west of the CSX rail line and northwest of Florida Atlantic University. Originally situated in unincorporated Palm Beach County, the site was annexed into Boca Raton almost a year following its dedication in 1970.

Construction of IBM&#x27;s main complex began in 1967, designed by Marcel Breuer, and the manufacturing and office complex was dedicated in March 1970. The campus was designed with self-sufficiency in mind and sported its own electrical substation, water pumping station, and rail spur.

By 1984 IBM was Palm Beach County&#x27;s largest corporate employer, with 8,500 Boca Raton employees. Among other noteworthy IT accomplishments, such as the mass production of the System/360 and development of the Series/1 mainframe computers, IBM&#x27;s main complex was the birthplace of the IBM PC, which later evolved into the IBM Personal System/2, developed in nearby Delray Beach. Starting in 1987, IBM relocated its manufacturing for what became the IBM PC division to Research Triangle Park in Raleigh, North Carolina, and converted the manufacturing facilities into offices and laboratories, later producing products such as the OS/2 operating system and VoiceType Dictation, later known as ViaVoice voice-recognition software.

IBM maintained its facilities in the South Florida area until 1996, when the facility was closed and sold to Blue Lake Real Estate. The site was sold to T-REX Management Consortium, then to the Blackstone Group in 2005, who renamed it the Boca Corporate Center and Campus. The site was later renamed the Boca Raton Innovation Campus (BRiC). Crocker Partners, noted for its development of Mizner Park and Office Depot headquarters, purchased BRiC in April 2018.

What used to be IBM&#x27;s Building 051, an annex separated from the former main IBM campus by Spanish River Boulevard, was donated to the Palm Beach County School District and converted into Don Estridge High Tech Middle School. It is named after Don Estridge, whose team was responsible for developing the IBM PC. IBM returned in July 2001, opening the software development laboratory at Beacon Square off Congress Avenue.

It is noteworthy that still left standing inside the old IBM complex is the office and conference table where Bill Gates signed his historic deal to supply IBM with the Microsoft MS-DOS operating system for its personal computer line.

====Suburban expansion====
In 1991, the new downtown outdoor shopping and dining center, Mizner Park, was completed over the site of the old Boca Raton Mall. It has since become a cultural center for southern Palm Beach County. Featuring a landscaped central park between the two main roads (collectively called Plaza Real) with stores only on the outside of the roads, Mizner Park resembles a Mediterranean suburban &quot;town center&quot; with a more contemporary look. It features many restaurants and is home to the Boca Raton Museum of Art, which moved to the new facility in 2001. In 2002, a new amphitheater was built, replacing a smaller one and providing a large-capacity outdoor venue where concerts and other performances are held. The Mizner Park Cultural Center, an indoor performing arts/comedy show theater is located to the southwest of the amphitheater within the Mizner Park property.

The National Cartoon Museum was built on the southwest edge of Mizner Park in 1996. Open for six years, the museum relocated to its original home in New York City in 2002.

As development continued to focus to the west of the city in the 1980s and 1990s, the mall area known as Town Center at Boca Raton became the geographic center of what is referred to as West Boca Raton, though this mall was not annexed into the city until 2004.

Forbes ranked Boca&#x27;s Royal Palm Yacht and Country Club the third most exclusive gated community in the US in 2017. Many mansions and estates have been built and reflect the high real estate values. 18.1% of homes for sale are within the $655,000‚Äì$966,000 range, 8.5% in the $966,000‚Äì$1.288 million range, and 11.9% in the $1.288 million plus range. Since the mid-2010s, there has been a developing boom such as the building of the Mandarin Oriental&#x27;s Residences, remodeling of Downtown Boca Raton&#x27;s Mizner Park, and development around Florida Atlantic University and Lynn University.

On November 2, 2004, the voters of the Via Verde Association, Waterside, Deerhurst Association (Boca South), Marina Del Mar Association, Rio Del Mar Association (both originally Boca Del Mar communities), and Heatherwood of Boca Raton Condominium Association approved annexation into the Boca Raton city limits, increasing the city land area to . A new gated community called Royal Palm Polo was annexed to the City of Boca Raton, which is the only jurisdiction north of Clint Moore Road.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which of this is land and of it (6.63%) is water. Boca Raton is a &quot;principal city&quot; (as defined by the Census Bureau) of the Miami metropolitan area. Approximately 1 square mile is on the barrier island Deerfield Beach Island (DBI), also colloquially known as Deerfield Cay. Like other South Florida cities, Boca Raton has a water table that does not permit building basements, however plumbing and sewage is constructed underneath the homes and streets, in addition to electrical systems in some areas. There are several high points in the city, such as 4th Avenue which is aptly named &quot;High Street&quot;. The highest point in this area is the guard shack at Camino Gardens, which is above sea level. The Boca Raton Hotel&#x27;s Beach Club rests at above sea level.

Several small tunnels run under roads in Boca, but the roads are built up several feet at these locations, or are on dunes. Several of these tunnels are under State Road A1A at Spanish River Park, from the west side of the road where parking is available to beachgoers, to the east side of the road, which is where the beach is located. A1A is already higher than the surrounding land here due to sand dunes formed by erosion and other natural features.

===Neighborhoods===

Pearl City is a neighborhood in Boca Raton, immediately north of downtown and within city limits. The neighborhood was originally platted on May 30, 1915, for the blue-collar African Americans employed at the Boca Raton Resort and similar establishments, on area farms, in construction, and various other jobs.

===Alternative schooling===

Two alternatives to the Palm Beach County Public Schools in Boca Raton are the K‚Äì8 Alexander D. Henderson University School (ADHUS) and FAU High School (FAUHS). Both are on the Florida Atlantic University campus and are organized as a unique and separate school district; they are not part of the Palm Beach County School System. Henderson School is recognized as Florida Atlantic University School District #72, under the College of Education&#x27;s administrative oversight.

University schools in Florida are authorized to provide instruction for grades K‚Äì12 and university students, support university research efforts, and test educational reforms for Florida schools. Both ADHUS and FAUHS are public schools and thus do not charge tuition. And they are open to children who reside in Palm Beach County or Broward County. ADHUS admission is by lottery, while FAUHS admission is determined by academic ability. Student characteristics of gender, race, family income and student ability are used to match the student population profile to that of the state.

FAU High School is a dual-enrollment program that involves itself primarily in collegiate classes. Students in ninth grade take advanced classes at the ADHUS sister campus, while students in higher grades attend only collegiate classes on Florida Atlantic University&#x27;s campus, earning dual credit for both high school and college. A student who has successfully completed all four years at FAU High School will graduate having completed three years of university study on a college campus.

== Crime ==
The City of Boca Raton is one of the safest cities in Palm Beach County, with a crime rate 38% lower than the entire state of Florida.

Boca Raton has had connections to the Mafia. According to a number of US Federal indictments, as of June 2004, the Gambino family continues to operate in Boca Raton. The television show &quot;The Sopranos&quot; featured the city in its plot (&quot;Boca&quot; and &quot;...To Save Us All From Satan&#x27;s Power&quot;), and &quot;Mafia Wife&quot; author Lynda Milito resides in Boca Raton. Joey Merlino, the reputed head of the Philadelphia crime family, also resides in northern Boca Raton.

In 2007, several murders at the Town Center Mall gained national attention. In March, a 52-year-old woman was kidnapped and murdered. In December of the same year, a 47-year-old woman and her 7-year-old daughter were also kidnapped, and later found bound and shot in the head in the woman&#x27;s SUV in the mall parking lot. This case was featured on &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;. Though there is no forensic evidence to suggest the murders were committed by the same person, the similarities in the cases led police to believe they were related. To this day, the murders all remain unsolved.

The Pearl City neighborhood has been known as a drug trafficking hub in the past. In recent years, the city, like most of the county (especially neighboring Delray Beach) has experienced a steady rise in heroin and opioid overdoses.

As of the end of 2019, the crime rate in Boca Raton was down 26% over the preceding 13 years.

===Water===

Long before any settlers arrived, the original 1870 government survey of the area showed that just west of and parallel to the Atlantic Ocean&#x27;s coastal dune was the &quot;Boca Ratones Lagoon&quot;, which extended south for measured from just north of the present location of Atlantic Avenue in Delray Beach. Along the southern half of the lagoon were three wide areas each called a &quot;Lake&quot;, which are now named (north to south) Lake Rogers, Lake Wyman, and Lake Boca Raton. At the southeast end of the lagoon was a short protrusion toward the south which would become the Boca Raton Inlet after a sandbar at its mouth was removed.

The lagoon and lakes were part of a half-mile (0.8¬†km) wide swamp, west of which was scrub land a mile (1.6¬†km) wide (part of the Atlantic Coastal Ridge) where the Florida East Coast Railway (1896) and Dixie Highway (1923) were built. To the west of the scrub was a half mile or wider swamp within which flowed north to south the &quot;Prong of Hillsborough River&quot;, which is now the El Rio Canal. It now forms the eastern border of Florida Atlantic University and the Old Floresta neighborhood. The prong entered the &quot;Hillsborough River&quot; at the present eastern end of the straight portion of the Hillsboro Canal (dredged 1911‚Äì1914), which is the southern city limits. The river flowed southeast in several channels along the western edge of the present Deerfield Island County Park, formerly called Capone Island (named for Al Capone who owned it during the 1930s), which did not become an island until the Royal Palm Canal was dredged along its northern edge in 1961. Flowing south from the lagoon to the river along the eastern edge of the &#x27;island&#x27; was a &quot;Small boat Pass into Hillsboro&#x27; River&quot;, also called the Little Hillsboro. The river continued due south about just inland of the coastal dune until it emptied into the Atlantic Ocean at the &quot;Hillsborough Bar&quot;, now the Hillsboro Inlet.

The lagoon was dredged in 1894‚Äì1895 to form part of the Florida East Coast Canal with a minimum depth of and a minimum width of . After 1895, the lagoon and canal were sometimes called the Spanish River. Between 1930 and 1935 the canal was improved to by the federal government and renamed the Intracoastal Waterway. It was improved again between 1960 and 1965 to . All three versions were subject to shoaling which reduced their depths below the specified minimum. Forming part of the northern city limits is the C-15 canal, connecting the El Rio Canal to the Intracoastal Waterway.

Boca Raton pioneered an innovative means to recycle wastewater that involves selling the recycled water to golf courses, to use for irrigation. This system is called the IRIS system. Instead of pumping the nutrient laden wastewater out to sea, or under the ground into an aquifer, the IRIS system prevents nutrients from ending up in the ocean, reducing Boca Raton&#x27;s impact on the problem of toxic algae blooms.

<text>Melvin Jerome Blanc (born Blank ; May 30, 1908 ‚Äì July 10, 1989) was an American voice actor and radio personality whose career spanned over 60 years. During the Golden Age of Radio, he provided character voices and vocal sound effects for comedy radio programs, including those of Jack Benny, Abbott and Costello, Burns and Allen, The Great Gildersleeve, Judy Canova and his own short-lived sitcom. 

Blanc became known worldwide for his work in the Golden Age of American Animation as the voices of Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Tweety, Sylvester the Cat, Yosemite Sam, Foghorn Leghorn, the Tasmanian Devil, and numerous other characters from the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; theatrical cartoons. Blanc also voiced the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; characters Porky Pig and Elmer Fudd after replacing their original performers Joe Dougherty and Arthur Q. Bryan, respectively, although he occasionally voiced Elmer during Bryan&#x27;s lifetime as well. He later voiced characters for Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s television cartoons, including: Barney Rubble and Dino on &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, Mr. Spacely on &quot;The Jetsons&quot;, Secret Squirrel on &quot;The Atom Ant/Secret Squirrel Show&quot;, the title character of &quot;Speed Buggy&quot;, and Captain Caveman on &quot;Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels&quot; and &quot;The Flintstone Kids&quot;.

Referred to as &quot;The Man of a Thousand Voices&quot;, he is regarded as one of the most influential people in the voice acting industry, and as one of the greatest voice actors of all time.

==Early life==
Blanc was born on May 30, 1908, in San Francisco, California, to Eva (n√©e Katz), a Lithuanian Jewish immigrant, and Frederick Blank (born in New York to German Jewish parents), the younger of two children. He grew up in San Francisco&#x27;s Western Addition neighborhood, and later in Portland, Oregon, where he attended Lincoln High School. He had an early fondness for voices and dialect, which he began practicing at the age of 10. He claimed that he changed the spelling of his name when he was 16, from Blank to Blanc, because a teacher told him that he would amount to nothing and be like his name, a &quot;blank&quot;. He joined the Order of DeMolay as a young man, and was eventually inducted into its Hall of Fame. After graduating from high school in 1927, he divided his time between leading an orchestra, becoming the youngest conductor in the country at the age of 19; and performing &quot;shtick&quot; in vaudeville shows around Washington, Oregon and northern California.

==Career==
===Radio work===
Blanc began his radio career at the age of 19 in 1927, when he made his acting debut on the KGW program &quot;The Hoot Owls&quot;, where his ability to provide voices for multiple characters first attracted attention. He moved to Los Angeles in 1932, where he met Estelle Rosenbaum (1909‚Äì2003), whom he married a year later, before returning to Portland. He moved to KEX in 1933 to produce and co-host his &quot;Cobweb and Nuts&quot; show with his wife Estelle, which debuted on June 15. The program played Monday through Saturday from 11:00 pm to midnight, and by the time the show ended two years later, it appeared from 10:30 pm to 11:00 pm.With his wife&#x27;s encouragement, Blanc returned to Los Angeles and joined Warner Bros.‚Äìowned KFWB in Hollywood in 1935. He joined &quot;The Johnny Murray Show&quot;, but the following year switched to CBS Radio and &quot;The Joe Penner Show&quot;.
Blanc was a regular on the NBC Red Network show &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot; in various roles, including voicing Benny&#x27;s Maxwell automobile (in desperate need of a tune-up), violin teacher Professor LeBlanc, Polly the Parrot, Benny&#x27;s pet polar bear Carmichael and the train announcer. The first role came from a mishap when the recording of the automobile&#x27;s sounds failed to play on cue, prompting Blanc to take the microphone and improvise the sounds himself. The audience reacted so positively that Benny decided to dispense with the recording altogether and have Blanc continue in that role. One of Blanc&#x27;s characters from Benny&#x27;s radio (and later TV) programs was &quot;Sy, the Little Mexican&quot;, who spoke one word at a time. He continued to work with Benny on radio until the series ended in 1955 and followed the program into television from Benny&#x27;s 1950 debut episode through guest spots on NBC specials in the 1970s.

&quot;Radio Daily&quot; magazine wrote in 1942 that Blanc &quot;specialize[d] in over fifty-seven voices, dialects, and intricate sound effects&quot;, and by 1946, he was appearing on over fifteen programs in various supporting roles. His success on &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot; led to his own radio show on the CBS Radio Network, &quot;The Mel Blanc Show&quot;, which ran from September 3, 1946, to June 24, 1947. Blanc played himself as the hapless owner of a fix-it shop, as well as his young cousin Zookie. Blanc also appeared on such other national radio programs as &quot;The Abbott and Costello Show&quot;, the Happy Postman on &quot;Burns and Allen&quot;, and as August Moon on &quot;Point Sublime&quot;. During World War II, he appeared as Private Sad Sack on various radio shows, including &quot;G.I. Journal&quot;. Blanc recorded a song titled &quot;Big Bear Lake&quot;.

===Animation voice work during the golden age of Hollywood===

In December 1936, Mel Blanc joined Leon Schlesinger Productions, which was producing theatrical cartoon shorts for Warner Bros. After sound man Treg Brown was put in charge of cartoon voices, and Carl Stalling became music director, Brown introduced Blanc to animation directors Tex Avery, Bob Clampett, Friz Freleng, and Frank Tashlin, who loved his voices. The first cartoon Blanc worked on was &quot;Picador Porky&quot; (1937) as the voice of Porky&#x27;s drunken friends who dress up as a bull. He soon after received his first starring role when he replaced Joe Dougherty as Porky Pig&#x27;s voice in &quot;Porky&#x27;s Duck Hunt&quot;, which marked the debut of Daffy Duck, also voiced by Blanc.

Following this, Blanc became a very prominent vocal artist for Warner Bros., voicing a wide variety of the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; characters. Bugs Bunny, as whom Blanc made his debut in &quot;A Wild Hare&quot; (1940), was known for eating carrots frequently (especially while saying his catchphrase &quot;Eh, what&#x27;s up, doc?&quot;). To follow this sound with the animated voice, Blanc would bite into a carrot and then quickly spit into a spittoon. One often-repeated story is that Blanc was allergic to carrots, which Blanc denied.

In Disney&#x27;s &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, Blanc was hired to perform the voice of Gideon the Cat. However, it was eventually decided to have Gideon be a mute character (similar to Dopey from &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;), so all of Blanc&#x27;s recorded dialogue was deleted except for a solitary hiccup, which was heard three times in the finished film.

Blanc also originated the voice and laugh of Woody Woodpecker for the theatrical cartoons produced by Walter Lantz for Universal Pictures, but stopped voicing Woody after the character&#x27;s first three shorts when he was signed to an exclusive contract with Warner Bros. Despite this, his laugh was still used in the &quot;Woody Woodpecker&quot; cartoons until 1951, when Grace Stafford recorded a softer version, while his &quot;Guess who!?&quot; signature line was used in the opening titles until the end of the series and closure of Walter Lantz Productions in 1972.

During World War II, Blanc served as the voice of the hapless Private Snafu in a series of shorts produced by Warner Bros. as a way of training recruited soldiers through the medium of animation.

Throughout his career, Blanc, aware of his talents, protected the rights to his voice characterizations contractually and legally. He, and later his estate, never hesitated to take civil action when those rights were violated. Voice actors at the time rarely received screen credits, but Blanc was an exception; by 1944, his contract with Warner Bros. stipulated a credit reading &quot;Voice characterization(s) by Mel Blanc&quot;. According to his autobiography, Blanc asked for and received this screen credit from studio boss Leon Schlesinger after he was denied a salary raise. Initially, Blanc&#x27;s screen credit was limited only to cartoons in which he voiced Bugs Bunny. This changed in March 1945 when the contract was amended to also include a screen credit for cartoons featuring Porky Pig and/or Daffy Duck. This however, excluded any shorts with the two characters made before that amendment occurred, even if they released after the fact (&quot;Book Revue&quot; and &quot;Baby Bottleneck&quot; are both examples of this). By the end of 1946, Blanc began receiving a screen credit in any subsequent Warner Bros. cartoon for which he provided voices.

===Voice work for Hanna-Barbera and others===
In 1960, after the expiration of his exclusive contract with Warner Bros., Blanc continued working for them, but also began providing voices for the TV cartoons produced by Hanna-Barbera; his roles during this time included Barney Rubble of &quot;The Flintstones&quot; and Cosmo Spacely of &quot;The Jetsons&quot;. His other voice roles for Hanna-Barbera included Dino the Dinosaur, Secret Squirrel, Speed Buggy, and Captain Caveman, as well as voices for &quot;Wally Gator&quot; and &quot;The Perils of Penelope Pitstop&quot;.

Blanc also worked with former &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; director Chuck Jones, who by this time was directing shorts with his own company Sib Tower 12 (later MGM Animation/Visual Arts), doing vocal effects for the &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; series from 1963 to 1967. Blanc was the first voice of Toucan Sam in Froot Loops commercials.

Blanc reprised some of his Warner Bros. characters when the studio contracted him to make new theatrical cartoons in the mid- to late 1960s. For these, Blanc voiced Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales, the characters who received the most frequent use in these shorts (later, newly introduced characters such as Cool Cat and Merlin the Magic Mouse were voiced by Larry Storch). Blanc also continued to voice the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; for the bridging sequences of &quot;The Bugs Bunny Show&quot;, as well as in numerous animated advertisements and several compilation features, such as &quot;The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie&quot; (1979). He also voiced Granny on Peter Pan Records in &quot;4 More Adventures of Bugs Bunny&quot; (1974) and &quot;Holly-Daze&quot; (1974), in place of June Foray, and replaced the late Arthur Q. Bryan as Elmer Fudd&#x27;s voice during the post-golden age era.

===Car accident and aftermath===
On January 24, 1961, Blanc was driving alone when his sports car was involved in a head-on collision on Sunset Boulevard; his legs and his pelvis were fractured as a result. He was in a coma and completely non-responsive. About two weeks later, one of Blanc&#x27;s neurologists at the UCLA Medical Center tried a different approach than just trying to address the unconscious Blanc‚Äîaddress his characters instead. Blanc was asked, &quot;How are you feeling today, Bugs Bunny?&quot; After a slight pause, Blanc answered, in a weak voice, &quot;Eh¬†... just fine, Doc. How are you?&quot; The doctor then asked Tweety if he was there, too. &quot;I tawt I taw a puddy tat&quot;, was the reply. Blanc returned home on March 17. Four days later, Blanc filed a US$ 500,000 lawsuit against the City of Los Angeles. His accident, one of 26 in the preceding two years at the intersection known as Dead Man&#x27;s Curve, resulted in the city funding the restructuring of curves at the location.

Years later, Blanc revealed that during his recovery, his son Noel &quot;ghosted&quot; several Warner Bros. cartoons&#x27; voice tracks for him. Warner Bros. had also asked Stan Freberg to provide the voices for Bugs Bunny and Porky Pig, but Freberg declined, out of respect for Blanc. Jerry Hausner briefly filled in for Blanc as Bugs and Yosemite Sam for some commercials and spots for &quot;The Bugs Bunny Show&quot; and additional lines in &quot;Devil&#x27;s Feud Cake&quot;. At the time of the accident, Blanc was also serving as the voice of Barney Rubble in &quot;The Flintstones&quot;. His absence from the show was relatively brief; Daws Butler provided the voice of Barney for a few episodes, after which the show&#x27;s producers set up recording equipment in Blanc&#x27;s hospital room and later at his home to allow him to work from there. Some of the recordings were made while he was in full-body cast as he lay flat on his back with the other &quot;Flintstones&quot; co-stars gathered around him. He returned to &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot; to film the program&#x27;s 1961 Christmas show, moving around by crutches and a wheelchair.

===Later years===
On January 29, 1962, Mel and his son Noel formed Blanc Communications Corporation, a media company which produced over 5,000 commercials and public service announcements, which remains in operation. Mel and Noel appeared with many stars, including: Kirk Douglas, Lucille Ball, Vincent Price, Phyllis Diller, Liberace and The Who.

In the 1970s, Blanc gave a series of college lectures across the US and appeared in commercials for American Express. Mel&#x27;s production company, Blanc Communications Corporation, collaborated on a special with the Boston-based Shriners&#x27; Burns Institute called &quot;Ounce of Prevention&quot;, which became a 30-minute TV special. In 1972, Chuck McKibben started working as Blanc&#x27;s personal recording engineer/producer and studio manager. His daily responsibilities at Mel Blanc Audiomedia in Beverly Hills, California included recording Blanc&#x27;s voice for a variety of film, advertising and theme park projects.

Throughout the late 1970s and 1980s, Blanc performed his &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; characters for bridging sequences in various compilation films of Golden Age-era Warner Bros. cartoons, such as: &quot;The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie&quot;, &quot;The Looney Looney Looney Bugs Bunny Movie&quot;, &quot;Bugs Bunny&#x27;s 3rd Movie: 1001 Rabbit Tales&quot;, &quot;Daffy Duck&#x27;s Fantastic Island&quot; and &quot;Daffy Duck&#x27;s Quackbusters&quot;. His final performance of his &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; roles was in &quot;Bugs Bunny&#x27;s Wild World of Sports&quot; (1989). After spending most of two seasons voicing the diminutive robot Twiki in &quot;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&quot;, Blanc&#x27;s last major original character was Heathcliff, who he voiced from 1980 to 1988.

In the live-action film &quot;Strange Brew&quot; (1983), Blanc voiced the father of Bob and Doug McKenzie, at the request of comedian Rick Moranis. In the live-action/animated movie &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; (1988), Blanc reprised several of his roles from Warner Bros. cartoons (Bugs, Daffy, Porky, Tweety, and Sylvester), but left Yosemite Sam to Joe Alaskey (who later became one of Blanc&#x27;s regular replacements until his death in 2016). The film was one of the few Disney projects in which Blanc was involved. Blanc died just a year after the film&#x27;s release. His final recording session was for &quot;&quot; (1990).

==Personal life==
Blanc and his wife Estelle Rosenbaum were married on January 4, 1933, and remained married until his death in 1989. Their son, Noel Blanc, was also a voice actor.

Blanc was a Freemason as a member of Mid Day Lodge No. 188 in Portland, Oregon. He held membership at the lodge for 58 years. Blanc was also a Shriner.

==Death==
Blanc began smoking at least one pack of cigarettes per day at the age of nine and continued up through 1985, having quit smoking after being diagnosed with emphysema. He was later diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), after his family checked him into the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on May 19, 1989 when they noticed he had been coughing profusely while shooting a commercial. He was originally expected to recover, but doctors later discovered that he had advanced coronary artery disease after his health had worsened. He also fell from his bed and broke his femur during the stay.

Blanc died at the age of 81 from complications related to both illnesses on July 10, 1989 at 2:30¬†p.m., nearly two months after being admitted into the hospital. He is interred in Hollywood Forever Cemetery section 13, Pinewood section, plot #149 in Hollywood. His will specified that his gravestone read &quot;&quot;‚Äîthe phrase with which Blanc&#x27;s character, Porky Pig, concluded Warner Bros. cartoons from 1937 to 1946.

==Legacy==
Blanc is regarded as the most prolific voice actor in entertainment history. He was the first voice actor to receive on-screen credit.

Blanc&#x27;s death was considered a significant loss to the cartoon industry because of his skill, expressive range, and the sheer number of the continuing characters he portrayed, whose roles were subsequently assumed by several other voice talents. As film critic Leonard Maltin observed, &quot;It is astounding to realize that Tweety Bird and Yosemite Sam are the same man!&quot;

Blanc said that Sylvester the Cat was the easiest character for him to voice, because &quot;[he&#x27;s] just my normal speaking voice with a spray at the end&quot;; and that Yosemite Sam was the hardest, because of his loudness and raspyness.

A doctor who examined Blanc&#x27;s throat found that he possessed unusually thick, powerful vocal cords that gave him an exceptional range, and compared them to those of opera singer Enrico Caruso.

After his death, Blanc&#x27;s voice continued to be heard in newly released productions, such as recordings of Dino the Dinosaur in the live-action films &quot;The Flintstones&quot; (1994) and &quot;The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas&quot; (2000). Similarly, recordings of Blanc as Jack Benny&#x27;s Maxwell were featured in &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot; (2003). In 1994, the Blanc estate and Warner Bros. forged a new alliance: the Warner-Blanc Audio Library, which consisted of approximately 550 songs and voices of every character in Blanc&#x27;s repertoire, which he had begun setting down at his multi-track studio in 1958 amid fears of a future when he would be around no longer to record. 15 hours of new tapes of Mel&#x27;s material were discovered in 1996, with Noel Blanc expecting to find more soon. These new recordings of Blanc&#x27;s voices were also given to a variety of toys, watches, video games, and websites. More recently, archive recordings of Blanc have been featured in new computer-generated imagery-animated &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; theatrical shorts; &quot;I Tawt I Taw a Puddy Tat&quot; (shown with &quot;Happy Feet Two&quot;) and &quot;Daffy&#x27;s Rhapsody&quot; (shown with &quot;Journey 2: The Mysterious Island&quot;).

For his contributions to the radio industry, Blanc has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6385 Hollywood Boulevard. His character Bugs Bunny was also awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on December 10, 1985.

Blanc trained his son Noel in the field of voice characterization. Noel performed his father&#x27;s characters (particularly Porky Pig) on some programs, but did not become a full-time voice artist. Warner Bros. expressed reluctance to have a single voice actor succeed Blanc, and employed multiple new voice actors to fill the roles since the 1990s, including Noel Blanc, Jeff Bergman, Joe Alaskey, Greg Burson, Billy West and Eric Bauza.

<text>In Old Arizona is a 1928 American sound (All-Talking) pre-Code Western film directed by Raoul Walsh and Irving Cummings, nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture. The film, which was based on the character of the Cisco Kid in the 1907 story &quot;The Caballero&#x27;s Way&quot; by O. Henry, was a major innovation in Hollywood. It was the first major Western to use the new technology of sound and the first talkie to be filmed outdoors. It made extensive use of authentic locations, filming in Bryce Canyon National Park and Zion National Park in Utah, and the Mission San Juan Capistrano and the Mojave Desert in California. The film premiered in Los Angeles on December 25, 1928, and went into general release on January 20, 1929.

&quot;In Old Arizona&quot; contributed to creating the image of the singing cowboy, as its star, Warner Baxter, does some incidental singing. Baxter went on to win the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance. Other nominations included Best Director for Irving Cummings, Best Writing for Tom Barry, Best Cinematography for Arthur Edeson, and Best Picture. The film entered the public domain on January 1, 2024.

==Plot==

In Arizona, a bandit known as the Cisco Kid robs a stagecoach. Word of this deed reaches to Sergeant Micky Dunn, who is tasked by his superior to bring in the Cisco Kid dead or alive, with a $5,000 reward promised once he succeeds. They meet in a barber shop, though Dunn is unaware of the Cisco Kid&#x27;s true identity and passes him off as a friendly civilian. When he leaves, the local blacksmith tells him that was the Cisco Kid, much to Dunn&#x27;s chagrin.

The Cisco Kid is in a relationship with Tonia Maria, and visits her often. He loves her, but she has frequent affairs without his knowledge. Dunn and Maria meet each other and begin an affair. Dunn tells Maria that once he takes down the Cisco Kid, he will give the $5,000 reward to Maria, making her fall in love with him. They express their love for each other while the Cisco Kid secretly watches and listens nearby, learning of her betrayal.

She writes a secret letter to Dunn telling him to come that evening to take down the Cisco Kid before he makes his escape. However, the Cisco Kid finds this letter and replaces it with a fake letter &quot;from Maria&quot; which he has written himself. His letter says that he will be dressed up in Maria&#x27;s clothes in an effort to disguise himself from Dunn, while Maria is actually in the Cisco Kid&#x27;s clothes riding away. Dunn receives this fake letter, believing it to be from Maria. When the Cisco Kid leaves her house, Dunn shoots Maria, believing her to be the Cisco Kid in disguise. Now farther away, the Cisco Kid laments that &quot;[Maria&#x27;s] flirting days are over, and she can finally settle down&quot;. He then makes his escape.

==Cast==
* Warner Baxter as the Cisco Kid
* Edmund Lowe as Sergeant Mickey Dunn
* Dorothy Burgess as Tonia Maria

== Production ==

Raoul Walsh was set to direct the film and star as the Cisco Kid, but had to abandon the project when a jackrabbit jumped through the windshield of a vehicle he was driving; the resulting wreck cost Walsh an eye. He never acted again, but continued his successful career as a film director. 

==Music==
The film features a theme song entitled &quot;My Tonia&quot; which was composed by B. G. De Sylva, Lew Brown and Ray Henderson.

==Awards and nominations==
At the 2nd Academy Awards, the film was nominated for five awards‚ÄîOutstanding Picture; Best Director (Irving Cummings); Best Actor (Warner Baxter); Best Writing (Tom Barry)‚Äîtied for the most of the year with &quot;The Patriot&quot;; and Best Cinematography (Arthur Edeson). In a ceremony where no film won more than one award, only Warner Baxter&#x27;s Best Actor nomination was successful.

==Preservation==
The Academy Film Archive preserved &quot;In Old Arizona&quot; in 2004.

Under the Copyright Term Extension Act, this movie entered the public domain on January 1, 2024.

<doc id="44750" wikidata="Q1541894" url="?curid=44750" title="Driftwood">
<text>Driftwood is wood that has been washed onto a shore or beach of a sea, lake, or river by the action of winds, tides or waves. It is part of beach wrack.

In some waterfront areas, driftwood is a major nuisance. However, the driftwood provides shelter and food for birds, fish and other aquatic species as it floats in the ocean. Gribbles, shipworms and bacteria decompose the wood and gradually turn it into nutrients that are reintroduced to the food web. Sometimes, the partially decomposed wood washes ashore, where it also shelters birds, plants, and other species. Driftwood can become the foundation for sand dunes.

Most driftwood is the remains of trees, in whole or part, that have been washed into the ocean, due to flooding, high winds, or other natural occurrences, or as the result of logging. There is also a subset of driftwood known as drift lumber. Drift lumber includes the remains of man-made wooden objects, such as buildings and their contents washed into the sea during storms, wooden objects discarded into the water from shore, dropped dunnage or lost cargo from ships (jetsam), and the remains of shipwrecked wooden ships and boats (flotsam). Erosion and wave action may make it difficult or impossible to determine the origin of a particular piece of driftwood.

Driftwood can be used as part of decorative furniture or other art forms, and is a popular element in the scenery of fish tanks.

==History==
According to Norse mythology, the first humans, Ask and Embla, were formed out of two pieces of driftwood, an ash and an elm, by the god Odin and his brothers, Vili and V√©. The Vikings would cast wood into the sea before making landfall. The location of the wood would be an indication as to where to build their mead halls. The wood used would found the high-seat pillars of the new hall.

Driftwood carried by Arctic rivers was the main, or sometimes only, source of wood for some Inuit and other Arctic populations living north of the tree line until they came into regular contact with European traders. Traditional Inuit boats such as the kayak were fashioned from driftwood frames covered in skins. The Inuit classified driftwood into seven different types, each possessing its own unique material and visual properties. Driftwood could be used to make bows if it was straight grained and in reasonably good condition; these were reinforced with sinew cables. The Inuit even made arrows from driftwood; these were often short and fitted with bone or antler foreshafts. Dry scrapings produced by working this material were collected, stored and used for the starting of fires year-round by Inuit. Wood that is burned today in these regions mainly consists of the remains of condemned wooden structures. Driftwood is still used as kindling by some. Woods with resinous qualities, such as cedar, are preferred for their lengthier burning times. 

The &quot;Old Man of the Lake&quot; in Crater Lake, Oregon is a full-size tree that has been bobbing vertically in the lake for more than a century. Due to the cold water of the lake, the tree has been well preserved.

Alice Gray, the legendary &quot;Diana of the Dunes&quot;, who fought to preserve the Indiana Dunes, which contain quantities of driftwood, named her cottage &quot;Driftwood&quot; and made all her furniture from the material.

== Uses ==

=== Firewood ===
The EPA includes driftwood in its list of &quot;Items You Should Never Burn in Your [Wood-Burning] Appliance,&quot; because it will &quot;release toxic chemicals when burned&quot;.

The government of British Columbia also advises against burning driftwood, as dioxins may be released from the reaction of chloride ions with other materials in the smoke.

=== Sculptures ===
Driftwood sculptures are sculptures that are made of driftwood found on beaches or along riverbanks.
*At Kullaberg, Sweden, Lars Vilks created Nimis a driftwood artwork in the year 1980. This sculpture and two others led to the declaration of Ladonia as an independent nation.
*Sculptures were created on the Emeryville, California mudflat and marsh area of San Francisco Bay in the late 1960s.
*The Ashden Awards for Sustainable Energy (sometimes called the &quot;Green Oscars&quot;) are sculpted out of driftwood.
*Artist Deborah Butterfield is known for her sculptures of horses, initially rendered from driftwood before being cast in bronze.
*In January the annual Driftwood and Sand festival is held in Hokitika, New Zealand.

=== Forts ===
Driftwood is commonly used to make a temporary shelter on beaches.

== As a habitat ==
Large diameter &quot;Sequoia sempervirens&quot; logs spent enough time exposed to wave action to round their contours before being driven into the mouth of a narrow ravine by storm surf. Sequoia&#x27;s high tannin content is resistant to decay, so these logs retain structural strength for decades. Storm flows within Shorttail Gulch are insufficient to move the logs back to sea. This unique habitat at the mouths of small estuaries of the California coast is threatened by the diminished quantity of large redwood logs available in flood waters since the logging of native forests.

==Decline==
With the advent of industrial logging practices, the global quantity of driftwood has declined. Early accounts indicate that driftwood was once more plentiful. Early photographs of the pacific coast reveal greater amounts of driftwood on the beaches than is present today. Likewise, when traveling in Dixon Entrance in the late 1800s, George A. Dorsey recorded that many beaches were &quot;piled high with drift, often to a height of sixty feet or more.&quot; Melting polar ice may also contribute to the decline of Siberian driftwood in the Atlantic as the sea ice enabled driftwood to travel greater distances without becoming waterlogged.

<text>Grand Hotel is a 1932 American pre-Code drama film directed by Edmund Goulding and produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The screenplay by William A. Drake is based on the 1930 play by Drake, who had adapted it from the 1929 novel &quot;Menschen im Hotel&quot; by Vicki Baum. To date, it is the only film to have won the Academy Award for Best Picture without being nominated in any other category.

MGM remade the film as &quot;Week-End at the Waldorf&quot; in 1945. The German remake &quot;Menschen im Hotel&quot; was released in 1959, and it served as the basis for the 1989 Tony Award-winning stage musical &quot;Grand Hotel&quot;. In 1977, MGM announced a musical remake, to take place at Las Vegas&#x27; MGM Grand Hotel and directed by Norman Jewison, but the production was cancelled.

&quot;Grand Hotel&quot; has proven influential in the years since its release. The iconic line &quot;I want to be alone&quot;, famously delivered by Greta Garbo, placed number 30 in &quot;AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes&quot;. In 2007, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

Due to being a film published in 1932, it will enter the public domain on January 1, 2028.

==Plot==
Doctor Otternschlag, a disfigured veteran of World War I and a permanent resident of the Grand Hotel in Berlin, observes &quot;People coming, going. Nothing ever happens&quot; ‚Äî after which a great deal transpires.

Baron Felix von Gaigern, who squandered his fortune and supports himself as a card player and occasional jewel thief, befriends Otto Kringelein, a dying accountant who has decided to spend his remaining days in the lap of luxury. Kringelein&#x27;s former employer, industrialist General Director Preysing, is at the hotel to close an important deal, and he hires stenographer Flaemmchen to assist him. She aspires to be an actress and shows Preysing some magazine photos for which she posed.

Another guest is Russian ballerina Grusinskaya, whose career is on the wane. When the baron is in her room to steal her jewelry and she returns from the theatre, he hides in her room and overhears her contemplating suicide. He comes out of hiding and engages her in conversation. The two fall in love and spend the night together. The following morning, the baron returns Grusinskaya&#x27;s jewels, and she forgives his crime. She invites him to accompany her to Vienna, an offer he accepts.

The baron is desperate for money to pay his way out of the criminal group he has been working with. He and Kringelein start a card game, and Kringelein wins everything, then becomes intoxicated. When he drops his wallet, the baron stashes it in his pocket, intending to keep not only the winnings but the funds that will see Kringelein through the last weeks of his life. However, moved by the sight of Kringelein&#x27;s despair, the baron ‚Äì who desperately needs the money, but has become very fond of Kringelein ‚Äì pretends to have discovered the wallet and returns it to him.

As part of a desperate merger plan, Preysing must travel to England, and he asks Flaemmchen to accompany him. Later, when the two are in her room‚Äîwhich opens onto his‚ÄîPreysing sees the shadow of the baron rifling through his belongings. He confronts the baron, who hands his wallet back to him. The two struggle, and Preysing bludgeons the baron with the telephone, killing him. Flaemmchen sees what happened and runs to tell Kringelein, who confronts Preysing. He insists he acted in self-defense and asks Kringelein to lie, but Kringelein summons the police, and Preysing is arrested.

Grusinskaya departs for the train station, expecting to find the baron waiting for her there. Meanwhile, Kringelein offers to take care of Flaemmchen, who suggests they seek a cure for his illness. As they leave the hotel, Doctor Otternschlag again observes &quot;Grand Hotel. Always the same. People come. People go. Nothing ever happens.&quot;

==Production==

Producer Irving Thalberg purchased the rights to Vicki Baum&#x27;s novel &quot;Menschen im Hotel&quot; for $13,000 and then commissioned William A. Drake to adapt it for the stage.
It opened on Broadway at the National Theatre on November 13, 1930, and ran for 459 performances. Pleased with its success, Thalberg had Drake and B√©la Bal√°zs write the screenplay, and had a budget at $700,000.
There was some controversy about Greta Garbo, with her strong Swedish accent, playing a Russian.

The film was seen as an artistic achievement in its art direction and production design. The lobby scenes were extremely well done, portraying a 360¬∞ front desk. This set allowed audiences to watch the hotel action from all around the characters. It changed the way sets were made from that point onward.

It was the first film to feature brothers Lionel and John Barrymore together. Thalberg initially cast Marie Dessler for the role of Suzette, but replaced her with Rafaela Ottiano, the only cast member from the Broadway production.

===&quot;I want to be alone&quot;===
As Grusinskaya, Greta Garbo delivers the line &quot;I want to be alone&quot;, and, immediately following, she says &quot;I just want to be alone.&quot; Soon after, in conversation with Baron Felix von Geigern, she says &quot;And I want to be alone.&quot; Referring to its legendary use as a characterization of her reclusive personal life, Garbo later insisted &quot;I never said I want to be alone; I only said, &#x27;I want to be let alone.&#x27; There is all the difference.&quot;

==Reception==
===Box office===

&quot;Grand Hotel&quot; was a massive commercial success upon its release. According to MGM records, the film earned $1,235,000 in the U.S. and Canada and $1,359,000 in other markets, resulting in a profit of $947,000.

===Critical reception===

Alfred Rushford Greason of &quot;Variety&quot; comparing the film to the stage production, wrote &quot;[it] may not entirely please the theatregoers who were fascinated by its deft stage direction and restrained acting, but it will attract and hold the wider public to which it is now addressed&quot;. He added, &quot;The drama unfolds with a speed that never loses its grip, even for the extreme length of nearly two hours, and there is a captivating pattern of unexpected comedy that runs through it all, always fresh and always pat.&quot;

Mordaunt Hall of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the performances of Greta Garbo and John Barrymore, in a mostly positive review. &quot;The picture adheres faithfully to the original&quot;, he said, &quot;and while it undoubtedly lacks the life and depth and color of the play, by means of excellent characterizations it keeps the audience on the qui vive.&quot;

&quot;Film Daily&quot; called it an &quot;engrossing drama&quot; that &quot;never lags&quot;, and &quot;one of the classiest moving picture affairs you&#x27;ve seen in a long time&quot;.

John Mosher of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called it a &quot;tricky, clever film&quot;, praising Goulding as &quot;a director at last to give Garbo her due&quot; and for his &quot;ingenious&quot; camera work, &quot;relishing, I suspect, the advantages the screen offers in these respects over the stage, where the awkward constant shifting of scenes clogged the action of the play&quot;.

===Legacy===
The film holds an 88% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 50 reviews, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Perhaps less a true film than a series of star-studded vignettes, &quot;Grand Hotel&quot; still remains an entertaining look back at a bygone Hollywood era.&quot;

Writing in 2009, Blake Goble of &quot;The Michigan Daily&quot; called it &quot;the original &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Eleven&quot; for its star power&quot;, and compared it to &quot;Gosford Park&quot; &quot;for its dense structure and stories&quot;. He added &quot;[T]he pacing is quick, the acting is eloquent, and the stories are actually interesting. It&#x27;s pure theatricality. But &quot;Hotel&quot; lasted thanks to its simplicity, and the star power doesn&#x27;t hurt either. This is grand, old Hollywood captured on film.&quot;

In 2022, Leila Jordan of &quot;Paste&quot; magazine noted the film as highly influential: &quot;Recognizable names, intersecting stories and a cast that makes you go ‚Äúwait they‚Äôre in this too?‚Äù Grand Hotel didn‚Äôt invent the genre, but it was the first to assemble the pieces into a sensational hit.&quot;

==Aborted late 1970s musical remake==
In his memoir &quot;Adventures in the Screen Trade&quot;, screenwriter William Goldman recalls being contacted by director Norman Jewison about doing a remake of the film as a musical, to be set at the original MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas (now Bally&#x27;s). It would also be filmed at the hotel, named for the film and opened just four years earlier, where MGM had not yet allowed any filming of its luxurious interiors. Goldman was very enthusiastic, since even though movie musicals were not very popular with studios or audiences at the time, he believed &quot;Grand Hotel&quot; could be an exception, recalling the classic Hollywood movie musicals of the 1940s and 1950s, with the real interiors of the Grand, never before seen on screen, as their setting. Goldman also worried that he was being seen too much as a screenwriter of thrillers and wanted to show that he was not a genre writer.

MGM executives, initially cooperative, began to have second thoughts about the project once one of them remembered that Jewison had final cut in his contract, meaning the studio could not force him to make changes to the film before release. Goldman characterized their perception of the hotel as &quot;Pristine. Unsullied. The diamond in the Metro crown&quot;, and believed they feared the film would not depict the Grand this way, instead focusing on the less glamorous aspects of Las Vegas. Goldman wrote a draft of the script with far more detail than he normally added to make clear that this was not his or Jewison&#x27;s intention, but the studio was not sufficiently persuaded. As a compromise, they offered Jewison final cut on any material filmed outside the hotel, but not inside. Jewison was unwilling to accept that, and the project fell through.

Four years later, Jewison called Goldman again and said the hotel, now under separate management from the studio, was again interested. Staff at the hotel took Goldman on tours of the building as part of his research. While visiting the suites on the uppermost floors, never rented but instead comped to heavy gamblers and their entourages, he was told that director Hal Ashby had used one for a scene in the then-unreleased &quot;Lookin&#x27; to Get Out&quot;, apparently after Caesar&#x27;s Palace had refused him permission to use one of their suites.

Goldman and Jewison learned that in the scene Ashby filmed at the Grand, one of the main characters goes into the suite with a prostitute while his friend waits outside. This was at odds with the image of the Grand management had gone to great lengths to avoid projecting in 1977. After the 1981 MGM film &quot;...All the Marbles&quot;, set in the world of women&#x27;s professional wrestling, staged its climax at the MGM Grand in Reno, Nevada, Goldman felt the Grand had lost its mystique and so lost his enthusiasm for working on the film; the project was dropped.

==Home media==
Warner Home Video released the first Region 1 DVD on February 3, 2004. The film is in 4:3 frame format, with audio tracks in English and French, and subtitles in English, French, and Spanish. Bonus features include &quot;Checking Out: Grand Hotel&quot;, a documentary about the making of the film; a 1932 newsreel with highlights of the Hollywood premiere; &quot;Nothing Ever Happens&quot;, a 1933 Vitaphone short film spoofing &quot;Grand Hotel&quot;; and theatrical trailers.

The 2013 Warner Home Video Blu-ray release of &quot;Grand Hotel&quot; contains an audio commentary track by film historians Jeffrey Vance and Mark A. Vieira.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Akiko Yano was born Akiko Suzuki in Tokyo in 1955. She grew up in Aomori, Japan, and learned to play the piano when she was three. She dropped out of high school and moved to Tokyo at the age of fifteen to become a professional musician, quickly became involved in the jazz scene, and by seventeen was working as a studio recording artist for hire. She also performed with the band Tin Pan Alley.

===Solo career===
Yano&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Japanese Girl&quot;, was released on July 25, 1976, was a major hit in Japan, and gave Yano overnight success. The album was recorded in Los Angeles with Little Feat, and of the album&#x27;s ten tracks, she wrote nine of them. The album has been praised for its unique blend of different musical styles such as jazz, pop, blues, and traditional Japanese folk music, and &quot;still sounds fresh today&quot;, according to Paul Bowler of &quot;Record Collector&quot; magazine. The success led to her self-producing the second album, &quot;Iroha Ni Konpeitou&quot;, which was released in 1977. It was recorded primarily in Japan, and features Yano improvising on a variety of instruments, backed up by prominent musicians such as Rick Marotta and Haruomi Hosono. Around this time, Yano started collaborating with Yellow Magic Orchestra and joined them on two world tours. They also played as the backing band for her 1980 album &quot;Gohan Ga Dekitayo&quot;, which translates to &quot;Dinner&#x27;s Ready&quot;, and marked a shift in her musical style towards electro-pop. The album was also one of the earliest CDs ever released in 1982.

1981&#x27;s &quot;Tadaima&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;m Home&quot;) has become one of the most beloved of Yano&#x27;s discography, and also one of her personal favorites. The record company asked for an album that would be a commercial success, so Yano gave them what they wanted on side one, but took side two in a different avant-garde direction, composed around nine short stories that were written by children. The album once again featured the Yellow Magic Orchestra, as well as a cartoonish &quot;heta-uma&quot; cover designed by Teruhiko Yumura, but was only released in Japan. The album&#x27;s single &quot;Harusaki Kobeni&quot; was released before the album was recorded, and reached the top 40 chart after being used in cosmetics commercials.

Yano was introduced to British band, Japan, by Ryuichi Sakamoto of the Yellow Magic Orchestra, and in 1982 they met at the AIR Studios in London to record an album, &quot;Ai Ga Nakucha Ne&quot; (&quot;There Must Be Love&quot;). The record company, Japan Record, released the album as a set with a book of photography and at a lower price, as requested by Yano. After her 1984 album &quot;Oh Hisse, Oh Hisse&quot;, Yano took a one-year break from recording music to raise her children, and decided to refocus her career on jazz, which led to the 1989 album &quot;Welcome Back&quot; featuring Pat Metheny, Charlie Haden and Peter Erskine. She relocated to New York City in 1990.

===Other projects===
Yano&#x27;s credits extend beyond her album projects. She was showcased by Japanese animation film company Studio Ghibli, which is known for works such as &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; and &quot;Spirited Away&quot;. Yano composed the music for the film &quot;My Neighbors the Yamadas&quot; (as well as performing a minor role as Fujihara-sensei) and created and performed the sound effects using only her voice for two short films &quot;Yadosagashi&quot; and &quot;Mizugumo Monmon&quot; by animation director Hayao Miyazaki. Both films were shown at the Ghibli Museum in Mitaka, Tokyo. More recently in 2008, Yano performed as a voiceover actress on &quot;Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea&quot; as Ponyo&#x27;s sisters. In addition, Yano composed music for Toei&#x27;s animated feature, &quot;Atashin&#x27;chi&quot; and piano-based soundtrack for the film &quot;Tagatameni&quot;.

As an international artist, Yano has toured Europe extensively, performing at &quot;The Montreux Jazz Festival&quot;, &quot;Caf√© de la Danse&quot;, and &quot;Cit√© de la Musique&quot; in Paris. In 2002, she also performed a week of special concerts at &quot;Pizza Express&quot; in London. In the United States, Yano has performed in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Boston and New York City where she periodically plays concerts throughout the year at &quot;Joe&#x27;s Pub&quot; at the New York Public Theater. In July 2009, she performed at the North Sea Jazz Festival along with fellow pianist Hiromi Uehara.
In recent years she has appeared at the &quot;Blue Note in New York&quot; as a guest performer for Janis Siegel of The Manhattan Transfer, and as part of a trio with Anthony Jackson on bass and Cliff Almond on drums in concerts at the Blue Note Tokyo since 2003. In 2008, New York guitarist Marc Ribot joined Yano for sold-out shows at the &quot;Blue Note Tokyo&quot;.

Yano joined with Rei Harakami to create the duo Yanokami, and in 2007 they released their first studio album &quot;Yanokami&quot;. In 2009, Will Lee and Chris Parker joined her to form the Akiko Yano Trio.

<doc id="44755" wikidata="Q311822" url="?curid=44755" title="William of Tyre">
<text>William of Tyre (; 29 September 1186) was a medieval prelate and chronicler. As archbishop of Tyre, he is sometimes known as William II to distinguish him from his predecessor, William I, the Englishman, a former prior of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, who was Archbishop of Tyre from 1127 to 1135. He grew up in Jerusalem at the height of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, which had been established in 1099 after the First Crusade, and he spent twenty years studying the liberal arts and canon law in the universities of Europe.

Following William&#x27;s return to Jerusalem in 1165, King Amalric made him an ambassador to the Byzantine Empire. William became tutor to the king&#x27;s son, the future King Baldwin IV, whom William discovered to be a leper. After Amalric&#x27;s death, William became chancellor and archbishop of Tyre, two of the highest offices in the kingdom, and in 1179 William led the eastern delegation to the Third Council of the Lateran. As he was involved in the dynastic struggle that developed during Baldwin IV&#x27;s reign, his importance waned when a rival faction gained control of royal affairs. He was passed over for the prestigious Patriarchate of Jerusalem, and died in obscurity, probably in 1186.

William wrote an account of the Lateran Council and a history of the Islamic states from the time of Muhammad, neither of which survives. He is famous today as the author of a history of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. William composed his chronicle in excellent Latin for his time, with numerous quotations from classical literature. The chronicle is sometimes given the title &quot;Historia rerum in partibus transmarinis gestarum&quot; (&quot;History of Deeds Done Beyond the Sea&quot;) or &quot;Historia Ierosolimitana&quot; (&quot;History of Jerusalem&quot;), or the &quot;Historia&quot; for short. It was translated into French soon after his death, and thereafter into numerous other languages. Because it is the only source for the history of twelfth-century Jerusalem written by a native, historians have often assumed that William&#x27;s statements could be taken at face value. However, more recent historians have shown that William&#x27;s involvement in the kingdom&#x27;s political disputes resulted in detectable biases in his account. Despite this, he is considered the greatest chronicler of the crusades, and one of the best authors of the Middle Ages.

==Early life==

The Kingdom of Jerusalem was founded in 1099 at the end of the First Crusade. It was the third of four Christian territories to be established by the crusaders, following the County of Edessa and the Principality of Antioch, and followed by the County of Tripoli. Jerusalem&#x27;s first three rulers, Godfrey of Bouillon (1099‚Äì1100), his brother Baldwin I (1100‚Äì1118), and their cousin Baldwin II (1118‚Äì1131), expanded and secured the kingdom&#x27;s borders, which encompassed roughly the same territory as modern-day Israel, Palestine, and Lebanon. During the kingdom&#x27;s early decades, the population was swelled by pilgrims visiting the holiest sites of Christendom. Merchants from the Mediterranean city-states of Italy and France were eager to exploit the rich trade markets of the east.

William&#x27;s family probably originated in either France or Italy, since he was very familiar with both countries. His parents were likely merchants who had settled in the kingdom and were &quot;apparently well-to-do&quot;, although it is unknown whether they participated in the First Crusade or arrived later. William was born in Jerusalem around 1130. He had at least one brother, Ralph, who was one of the city&#x27;s burgesses, a non-noble leader of the merchant community. Nothing more is known about his family, except that his mother died before 1165.

As a child William was educated in Jerusalem, at the cathedral school in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. The &quot;scholaster&quot;, or school-master, John the Pisan, taught William to read and write, and first introduced him to Latin. From the &quot;Historia&quot; it is clear that he also knew French and possibly Italian, but there is not enough evidence to determine whether he learned Greek, Persian, and Arabic, as is sometimes claimed.

Around 1145 William went to Europe to continue his education in the schools of France and Italy, especially in those of Paris and Bologna, &quot;the two most important intellectual centers of twelfth-century Christendom.&quot; These schools were not yet the official universities that they would become in the 13th century, but by the end of the 11th century both had numerous schools for the arts and sciences. They were separate from the cathedral schools, and were established by independent professors who were masters of their field of study. Students from all over Europe gathered there to hear lectures from these masters. William studied liberal arts and theology in Paris and Orl√©ans for about ten years, with professors who had been students of Thierry of Chartres and Gilbert de la Porr√©e. He also spent time studying under Robert of Melun and Adam de Parvo Ponte, among others. In Orl√©ans, one of the pre-eminent centres of classical studies, he read ancient Roman literature (known simply as &quot;the Authors&quot;) with Hilary of Orl√©ans, and learned mathematics (&quot;especially Euclid&quot;) with William of Soissons. For six years, he studied theology with Peter Lombard and Maurice de Sully. Afterwards, he studied civil law and canon law in Bologna, with the &quot;Four Doctors&quot;, Hugo de Porta Ravennate, Bulgarus, Martinus Gosia, and Jacobus de Boragine. William&#x27;s list of professors &quot;gives us almost a who&#x27;s who of the grammarians, philosophers, theologians, and law teachers of the so-called Twelfth-Century Renaissance&quot;, and shows that he was as well-educated as any European cleric. His contemporary John of Salisbury had many of the same teachers.

==Religious and political life in Jerusalem==
The highest religious and political offices in Jerusalem were usually held by Europeans who had arrived on pilgrimage or crusade. William was one of the few natives with a European education, and he quickly rose through the ranks. After his return to the Holy Land in 1165, he became canon of the cathedral at Acre. In 1167 he was appointed archdeacon of the cathedral of Tyre by Frederick de la Roche, archbishop of Tyre, with the support of King Amalric.

Amalric had come to power in 1164 and had made it his goal to conquer Egypt. Egypt had been invaded by King Baldwin I fifty years earlier, and the weak Fatimid Caliphate was forced to pay yearly tribute to Jerusalem. Amalric turned towards Egypt because Muslim territory to the east of Jerusalem had fallen under the control of the powerful Zengid sultan Nur ad-Din. Nur ad-Din had taken control of Damascus in 1154, six years after the disastrous siege of Damascus by the Second Crusade in 1148. Jerusalem could now expand only to the southwest, towards Egypt, and in 1153 Ascalon, the last Fatimid outpost in Palestine, fell to the crusaders. Nur ad-Din, however, also wished to acquire Egypt, and sent his army to hinder Amalric&#x27;s plans. This was the situation in the east when William returned from Europe. In 1167 Amalric married Maria Comnena, grand-niece of Byzantine emperor Manuel I Comnenus, and in 1168 the king sent William to finalize a treaty for a joint Byzantine-crusader campaign against Egypt. The expedition, Amalric&#x27;s fourth, was the first with support from the Byzantine navy. Amalric, however, did not wait for the fleet to arrive. He managed to capture Damietta, but within a few years he was expelled from Egypt by one of Nur ad-Din&#x27;s generals, Saladin, who would later become Jerusalem&#x27;s greatest threat.

Meanwhile, William continued his advancement in the kingdom. In 1169 he visited Rome, possibly to answer accusations made against him by Archbishop Frederick, although if so, the charge is unknown. It is also possible that while Frederick was away on a diplomatic mission in Europe, a problem within the diocese forced William to seek the archbishop&#x27;s assistance.
 On his return from Rome in 1170 he may have been commissioned by Amalric to write a history of the kingdom. He also became the tutor of Amalric&#x27;s son and heir, Baldwin IV. When Baldwin was thirteen years old, he was playing with some children, who were trying to cause each other pain by scratching each other&#x27;s arms. &quot;The other boys gave evidence of pain by their outcries,&quot; wrote William, &quot;but Baldwin, although his comrades did not spare him, endured it altogether too patiently, as if he felt nothing¬† ... ¬†It is impossible to refrain from tears while speaking of this great misfortune.&quot; William inspected Baldwin&#x27;s arms and recognized the possible symptoms of leprosy, which was confirmed as Baldwin grew older.

Amalric died in 1174, and Baldwin IV succeeded him as king. Nur ad-Din also died in 1174, and his general Saladin spent the rest of the decade consolidating his hold on both Egypt and Nur ad-Din&#x27;s possessions in Syria, which allowed him to completely encircle Jerusalem. The subsequent events have often been interpreted as a struggle between two opposing factions, a &quot;court party&quot; and a &quot;noble party.&quot; The &quot;court party&quot; was led by Baldwin&#x27;s mother, Amalric&#x27;s first wife Agnes of Courtenay, and her immediate family, as well as recent arrivals from Europe who were inexperienced in the affairs of the kingdom and were in favour of war with Saladin. The &quot;noble party&quot; was led by Raymond III of Tripoli and the native nobility of the kingdom, who favoured peaceful co-existence with the Muslims. This is the interpretation offered by William himself in the &quot;Historia&quot;, and it was taken as fact by later historians. Peter W. Edbury, however, has more recently argued that William must be considered extremely partisan as he was naturally allied with Raymond, who was responsible for his later advancement in political and religious offices. The accounts of the 13th-century authors who continued the &quot;Historia&quot; in French must also be considered suspect, as they were allied to Raymond&#x27;s supporters in the Ibelin family. The general consensus among recent historians is that although there was a dynastic struggle, &quot;the division was not between native barons and newcomers from the West, but between the king&#x27;s maternal and paternal kin.&quot;

Miles of Plancy briefly held the regency for the underaged Baldwin IV. Miles was assassinated in October 1174, and Raymond III was soon appointed to replace him. Raymond named William chancellor of Jerusalem, as well as archdeacon of Nazareth, and on 6 June 1175, William was elected archbishop of Tyre to replace Frederick de la Roche, who had died in October 1174. William&#x27;s duties as chancellor probably did not take up too much of his time; the scribes and officials in the chancery drafted documents and it may not have even been necessary for him to be present to sign them. Instead he focused on his duties as archbishop. In 1177 he performed the funeral services for William of Montferrat, husband of Baldwin IV&#x27;s sister Sibylla, when the patriarch of Jerusalem, Amalric of Nesle, was too sick to attend.

In 1179, William was one of the delegates from Jerusalem and the other crusader states at the Third Lateran Council; among the others were Heraclius, archbishop of Caesarea, Joscius, bishop of Acre and William&#x27;s future successor in Tyre, the bishops of Sebastea, Bethlehem, Tripoli, and Jabala, and the abbot of Mount Sion. Patriarch Amalric and Patriarch of Antioch Aimery of Limoges were unable to attend, and William and the other bishops did not have sufficient weight to persuade Pope Alexander III of the need for a new crusade. William was, however, sent by Alexander as an ambassador to Emperor Manuel, and Manuel then sent him on a mission to the Principality of Antioch. William does not mention exactly what happened during these embassies, but he probably discussed the Byzantine alliance with Jerusalem, and Manuel&#x27;s protectorate over Antioch, where, due to pressure from Rome and Jerusalem, the emperor was forced to give up his attempts to restore a Greek patriarch. William was absent from Jerusalem for two years, returning home in 1180.

==Patriarchal election of 1180==
During William&#x27;s absence a crisis had developed in Jerusalem. King Baldwin had reached the age of majority in 1176 and Raymond III had been removed from the regency, but as a leper Baldwin could have no children and could not be expected to rule much longer. After the death of William of Montferrat in 1177, King Baldwin&#x27;s widowed sister Sibylla required a new husband. At Easter in 1180, the two factions were divided even further when Raymond and his cousin Bohemond III of Antioch attempted to force Sibylla to marry Baldwin of Ibelin. Raymond and Bohemond were King Baldwin&#x27;s nearest male relatives in the paternal line, and could have claimed the throne if the king died without an heir or a suitable replacement. Before Raymond and Bohemond arrived, however, Agnes and King Baldwin arranged for Sibylla to be married to a Poitevin newcomer, Guy of Lusignan, whose older brother Aimery of Lusignan was already an established figure at court.

The dispute affected William, since he had been appointed chancellor by Raymond and may have fallen out of favour after Raymond was removed from the regency. When Patriarch Amalric died on 6 October 1180, the two most obvious choices for his successor were William and Heraclius of Caesarea. They were fairly evenly matched in background and education, but politically they were allied with opposite parties, as Heraclius was one of Agnes of Courtenay&#x27;s supporters. It seems that the canons of the Holy Sepulchre were unable to decide, and asked the king for advice; due to Agnes&#x27; influence, Heraclius was elected. There were rumours that Agnes and Heraclius were lovers, but this information comes from the partisan 13th-century continuations of the &quot;Historia&quot;, and there is no other evidence to substantiate such a claim. William himself says almost nothing about the election and Heraclius&#x27; character or his subsequent patriarchate, probably reflecting his disappointment at the outcome.

==Death==

William remained archbishop of Tyre and chancellor of the kingdom, but the details of his life at this time are obscure. The 13th-century continuators claim that Heraclius excommunicated William in 1183, but it is unknown why Heraclius would have done this. They also claim that William went to Rome to appeal to the Pope, where Heraclius had him poisoned. According to Peter W. Edbury and John Rowe, the obscurity of William&#x27;s life during these years shows that he did not play a large political role, but concentrated on ecclesiastical affairs and the writing of his history. The story of his excommunication, and the unlikely detail that he was poisoned, were probably an invention of the Old French continuators. William remained in the kingdom and continued to write up until 1184, but by then Jerusalem was internally divided by political factions and externally surrounded by the forces of Saladin, and &quot;the only subjects that present themselves are the disasters of a sorrowing country and its manifold misfortunes, themes which can serve only to draw forth lamentations and tears.&quot;

His importance had dwindled with the victory of Agnes and her supporters, and with the accession of Baldwin V, infant son of Sibylla and William of Montferrat. Baldwin was a sickly child and he died the next year. In 1186 he was succeeded by his mother Sibylla and her second husband Guy of Lusignan, ruling jointly. William was probably in failing health by this point. Rudolf Hiestand discovered that the date of William&#x27;s death was 29 September, but the year was not recorded; whatever the year, there was a new chancellor in May 1185 and a new archbishop of Tyre by 21 October 1186. Hans E. Mayer concluded that William died in 1186, and this is the year generally accepted by scholars.

William&#x27;s foresight about the misfortunes of his country was proven correct less than a year later. Saladin defeated King Guy at the Battle of Hattin in 1187, and went on to capture Jerusalem and almost every other city of the kingdom, except the seat of William&#x27;s archdiocese, Tyre. News of the fall of Jerusalem shocked Europe and plans were made to send assistance. According to Roger of Wendover, William was present at Gisors in France in 1188 when Henry II of England and Philip II of France agreed to go on crusade: &quot;Thereupon the king of the English first took the sign of the cross at the hands of the Archbishop of Rheims and William of Tyre, the latter of whom had been entrusted by our lord the pope with the office of legate in the affairs of the crusade in the western part of Europe.&quot; Roger was however mistaken; he knew that an unnamed archbishop of Tyre was present and assumed it must have been the William whose chronicle he possessed, although the archbishop in question was actually William&#x27;s successor Joscius.

==Works==
===&quot;Historia&quot;===
====Latin chronicle====
William&#x27;s great work is a Latin chronicle, written between 1170 and 1184. It contains twenty-three books; the final book, which deals with the events of 1183 and the beginning of 1184, has only a prologue and one chapter, so it is either unfinished or the rest of the pages were lost before the whole chronicle began to be copied. The first book begins with the conquest of Syria by Umar in the seventh century, but otherwise the work deals with the advent of the First Crusade and the subsequent political history of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. It is arranged, but was not written, chronologically; the first sections to be written were probably the chapters about the invasion of Egypt in 1167, which are extremely detailed and were likely composed before the Fatimid dynasty was overthrown in 1171. Much of the &quot;Historia&quot; was finished before William left to attend the Lateran Council, but new additions and corrections were made after his return in 1180, perhaps because he now realized that European readers would also be interested in the history of the kingdom. In 1184 he wrote the Prologue and the beginning of the twenty-third book.

August C. Krey thought William&#x27;s Arabic sources may have come from the library of the Damascene diplomat Usama ibn Munqidh, whose library was looted by Baldwin III from a shipwreck in 1154. Alan V. Murray, however, has argued that, at least for the accounts of Persia and the Turks in his chronicle, William relied on Biblical and earlier medieval legends rather than actual history, and his knowledge &quot;may be less indicative of eastern ethnography than of western mythography.&quot; William had access to the chronicles of the First Crusade, including Fulcher of Chartres, Albert of Aix, Raymond of Aguilers, Baldric of Dol, and the &quot;Gesta Francorum&quot;, as well as other documents located in the kingdom&#x27;s archives. He used Walter the Chancellor and other now-lost works for the history of the Principality of Antioch. From the end of Fulcher&#x27;s chronicle in 1127, William is the only source of information from an author living in Jerusalem. For events that happened in William&#x27;s own lifetime, he interviewed older people who had witnessed the events about which he was writing, and drew on his own memory.

William&#x27;s classical education allowed him to compose Latin superior to that of many medieval writers. He used numerous ancient Roman and early Christian authors, either for quotations or as inspiration for the framework and organization of the &quot;Historia&quot;. His vocabulary is almost entirely classical, with only a few medieval constructions such as &quot;loricator&quot; (someone who makes armour, a calque of the Arabic &quot;zarra&quot;) and &quot;assellare&quot; (to empty one&#x27;s bowels). He was capable of clever word-play and advanced rhetorical devices, but he was prone to repetition of a number of words and phrases. His writing also shows phrasing and spelling which is unusual or unknown in purely classical Latin but not uncommon in medieval Latin, such as:
* confusion between reflexive and possessive pronouns;
* confusion over the use of the accusative and ablative cases, especially after the preposition &quot;in&quot;;
* collapsed diphthongs (i.e. the Latin diphthongs &quot;ae&quot; and &quot;oe&quot; are spelled simply &quot;e&quot;);
* the dative &quot;mihi&quot; (&quot;to me&quot;) is spelled &quot;michi&quot;;
* a single &quot;s&quot; is often doubled, for example in the adjectival place-name ending which he often spells &quot;-enssis&quot;; this spelling is also used to represent the Arabic &quot;sh&quot;, a sound which Latin lacks, for example in the name Shawar which he spells &quot;Ssauar&quot;.

====Literary themes and biases====

Despite his quotations from Christian authors and from the Bible, William did not place much emphasis on the intervention of God in human affairs, resulting in a somewhat &quot;secular&quot; history. Nevertheless, he included much information that is clearly legendary, especially when referring to the First Crusade, which even in his own day was already considered an age of great Christian heroes. Expanding on the accounts of Albert of Aix, Peter the Hermit is given prominence in the preaching of the First Crusade, to the point that it was he, not Pope Urban II, who originally conceived the crusade. Godfrey of Bouillon, the first ruler of crusader Jerusalem, was also depicted as the leader of the crusade from the beginning, and William attributed to him legendary strength and virtue. This reflected the almost mythological status that Godfrey and the other first crusaders held for the inhabitants of Jerusalem in the late twelfth century.

William gave a more nuanced picture of the kings of his own day. He claimed to have been commissioned to write by King Amalric himself, but William did not allow himself to praise the king excessively; for example, Amalric did not respect the rights of the church, and although he was a good military commander, he could not stop the increasing threat from the neighbouring Muslim states. On a personal level, William admired the king&#x27;s education and his interest in history and law, but also noted that Amalric had &quot;breasts like those of a woman hanging down to his waist&quot; and was shocked when the king questioned the resurrection of the dead.

About Amalric&#x27;s son Baldwin IV, however, &quot;there was no ambiguity&quot;. Baldwin was nothing but heroic in the face of his debilitating leprosy, and he led military campaigns against Saladin even while still underaged; William tends to gloss over campaigns where Baldwin was not actually in charge, preferring to direct his praise towards the afflicted king rather than subordinate commanders. William&#x27;s history can be seen as an &quot;apologia&quot;, a literary defense, for the kingdom, and more specifically for Baldwin&#x27;s rule. By the 1170s and 1180s, western Europeans were reluctant to support the kingdom, partly because it was far away and there were more pressing concerns in Europe, but also because leprosy was usually considered divine punishment.

William was famously biased against the Knights Templar, whom he believed to be arrogant and disrespectful of both secular and ecclesiastical hierarchies, as they were not required to pay tithes and were legally accountable only to the Pope. Although he was writing decades later, he is the earliest author to describe the actual foundation of the Templar order. He was generally favourable towards them when discussing their early days, but resented the power and influence they held in his own time. William accused them of hindering the siege of Ascalon in 1153; of poorly defending a cave-fortress in 1165, for which twelve Templars were hanged by King Amalric; of sabotaging the invasion of Egypt in 1168; and of murdering Assassin ambassadors in 1173.

Compared to other Latin authors of the twelfth century, William is surprisingly favourable to the Byzantine Empire. He had visited the Byzantine court as an official ambassador and probably knew more about Byzantine affairs than any other Latin chronicler. He shared the poor opinion of Alexius I Comnenus that had developed during the First Crusade, although he was also critical of some of the crusaders&#x27; dealings with Alexius. He was more impressed by Alexius&#x27; son John II Comnenus; he did not approve of John&#x27;s attempts to bring the crusader Principality of Antioch under Byzantine control, but John&#x27;s military expeditions against the Muslim states, the common enemy of both Greeks and Latins, were considered admirable. Emperor Manuel, whom William met during his visits to Constantinople, was portrayed more ambivalently, much like King Amalric. William admired him personally, but recognized that the Empire was powerless to help Jerusalem against the Muslim forces of Nur ad-Din and Saladin. William was especially disappointed in the failure of the joint campaign against Egypt in 1169. The end of the &quot;Historia&quot; coincides with the massacre of the Latins in Constantinople and the chaos that followed the coup of Andronicus I Comnenus, and in his description of those events, William was certainly not immune to the extreme anti-Greek rhetoric that was often found in Western European sources.

As a medieval Christian author William could hardly avoid hostility towards the kingdom&#x27;s Muslim neighbours, but as an educated man who lived among Muslims in the east, he was rarely polemical or completely dismissive of Islam. He did not think Muslims were pagans, but rather that they belonged to a heretical sect of Christianity and followed the teachings of a false prophet. He often praised the Muslim leaders of his own day, even if he lamented their power over the Christian kingdom; thus Muslim rulers such as Mu&#x27;in ad-Din Unur, Nur ad-Din, Shirkuh, and even Jerusalem&#x27;s ultimate conqueror Saladin are presented as honourable and pious men, characteristics that William did not bestow on many of his own Christian contemporaries.

====Circulation of the chronicle====
After William&#x27;s death the &quot;Historia&quot; was copied and circulated in the crusader states and was eventually brought to Europe. In the 13th century, James of Vitry had access to a copy while he was bishop of Acre, and it was used by Guy of Bazoches, Matthew Paris, and Roger of Wendover in their own chronicles. However, there are only ten known manuscripts that contain the Latin chronicle, all of which come from France and England, so William&#x27;s work may not have been very widely read in its original form. In England, however, the &quot;Historia&quot; was expanded in Latin, with additional information from the &quot;Itinerarium Regis Ricardi&quot;, and the chronicle of Roger Hoveden; this version was written around 1220.

It is unknown what title William himself gave his chronicle, although one group of manuscripts uses &quot;Historia rerum in partibus transmarinis gestarum&quot; and another uses &quot;Historia Ierosolimitana&quot;. The Latin text was printed for the first time in Basel in 1549 by Nicholas Brylinger; it was also published in the &quot;Gesta Dei per Francos&quot; by Jacques Bongars in 1611 and the &quot;Recueil des historiens des croisades&quot; (RHC) by Auguste-Arthur Beugnot and Auguste Le Pr√©vost in 1844, and Bongars&#x27; text was reprinted in the &quot;Patrologia Latina&quot; by Jacques Paul Migne in 1855. The now-standard Latin critical edition, based on six of the surviving manuscripts, was published as &quot;Willelmi Tyrensis Archiepiscopi Chronicon&quot; in the &quot;Corpus Christianorum&quot; in 1986, by R. B. C. Huygens, with notes by Hans E. Mayer and Gerhard R√∂sch. The RHC edition was translated into English by Emily A. Babcock and August C. Krey in 1943 as &quot;A History of Deeds Done Beyond the Sea,&quot; although the translation is sometimes incomplete or inexact.

====Old French translation====
A translation of the &quot;Historia&quot; into Old French, made around 1223, was particularly well-circulated and had many anonymous additions made to it in the 13th century. In contrast to the surviving Latin manuscripts, there are &quot;at least fifty-nine manuscripts or fragments of manuscripts&quot; containing the Old French translation. There are also independent French continuations attributed to Ernoul and Bernard le Tr√©sorier. The translation was sometimes called the &quot;Livre dou conqueste&quot;; it was known by this name throughout Europe as well as in the crusader Kingdom of Cyprus and in Cilician Armenia, and 14th-century Venetian geographer Marino Sanuto the Elder had a copy of it. The French was further translated into Spanish, as the &quot;Gran conquista de Ultramar&quot;, during the reign of Alfonso the Wise of Castile in the late 13th century. The French version was so widespread that the Renaissance author translated it back into Latin, unaware that a Latin original already existed. A Middle English translation of the French was made by William Caxton in the 15th century.

===Other works===
William reports that he wrote an account of the Third Council of the Lateran, which does not survive. He also wrote a history of the Holy Land from the time of Muhammad up to 1184, for which he used Eutychius of Alexandria as his main source. This work seems to have been known in Europe in the 13th century but it also does not survive.

==Modern assessment==
William&#x27;s neutrality as an historian was often taken for granted until the late twentieth century. August C. Krey, for example, believed that &quot;his impartiality¬† ... ¬†is scarcely less impressive than his critical skill.&quot; Despite this excellent reputation, D. W. T. C. Vessey has shown that William was certainly not an impartial observer, especially when dealing with the events of the 1170s and 1180s. Vessey believes that William&#x27;s claim to have been commissioned by Amalric is a typical ancient and medieval &quot;topos&quot;, or literary theme, in which a wise ruler, a lover of history and literature, wishes to preserve for posterity the grand deeds of his reign. William&#x27;s claims of impartiality are also a typical &quot;topos&quot; in ancient and medieval historical writing.

His depiction of Baldwin IV as a hero is an attempt &quot;to vindicate the politics of his own party and to blacken those of its opponents.&quot; As mentioned above, William was opposed to Baldwin&#x27;s mother Agnes of Courtenay, Patriarch Heraclius, and their supporters; his interpretation of events during Baldwin&#x27;s reign was previously taken as fact almost without question. In the mid twentieth century, Marshall W. Baldwin, Steven Runciman, and Hans Eberhard Mayer were influential in perpetuating this point of view, although the more recent re-evaluations of this period by Vessey, Peter Edbury and Bernard Hamilton have undone much of William&#x27;s influence.

An often-noted flaw in the &quot;Historia&quot; is William&#x27;s poor memory for dates. &quot;Chronology is sometimes confused, and dates are given wrongly&quot;, even for basic information such as the regnal dates of the kings of Jerusalem. For example, William gives the date of Amalric&#x27;s death as 11 July 1173, when it actually occurred in 1174.

Despite his biases and errors, William &quot;has always been considered one of the greatest medieval writers.&quot; Runciman wrote that &quot;he had a broad vision; he understood the significance of the great events of his time and the sequence of cause and effect in history.&quot; Christopher Tyerman calls him &quot;the historian&#x27;s historian&quot;, and &quot;the greatest crusade historian of all,&quot; and Bernard Hamilton says he &quot;is justly considered one of the finest historians of the Middle Ages&quot;. As the &quot;Dictionary of the Middle Ages&quot; says, &quot;William&#x27;s achievements in assembling and evaluating sources, and in writing in excellent and original Latin a critical and judicious (if chronologically faulty) narrative, make him an outstanding historian, superior by medieval, and not inferior by modern, standards of scholarship.&quot;

<text>National parks of Sweden are managed by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) () and owned by the state. The goal of the national park service is to create a system of protected areas that represent all the distinct natural regions of the country. In 1909, Sweden became the first country in Europe to establish such parks when nine were opened following the Riksdag passing of a law on national parks that year. This was followed by the establishment of seven parks between 1918 and 1962 and thirteen between 1982 and 2009, with the latest being √Ösnen National Park in 2018. there are 30 national parks in Sweden, comprising a total area of .

According to the EPA, Swedish national parks must represent unique landscape types and be effectively protected and used for research, recreation, and tourism without damaging nature. Mountain terrain dominates approximatively 90% of the parks&#x27; combined area. The reason for this is the extensive mountain areas taken up by the large northern parks‚ÄîSarek National Park and Padjelanta National Park each cover approximately . Many of the northern parks are part of the Laponian area, one of Sweden&#x27;s UNESCO World Heritage Sites due to its preserved natural landscape and habitat for the native reindeer-herding Sami people. The southernmost parks‚ÄîS√∂der√•sen National Park, Dalby S√∂derskog National Park and Stenshuvud National Park‚Äîare covered with broadleaf forest and together cover approximately . Fulufj√§llet National Park is part of PAN Parks, a network founded by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) to provide better long-term conservation and tourism management of European national parks.

==Future national parks==

In 2008, after investigations and interviews with the participating counties, the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency laid down a plan to establish 13 new national parks in the near future. According to the plan, seven of the parks will be established between 2009 and 2013, the first being Kosterhavet National Park which was inaugurated in September 2009. It is currently unknown when the six remaining parks will be established.

<text>The University of California, Irvine (UCI or UC Irvine) is a public land-grant research university in Irvine, California, United States. One of the ten campuses of the University of California system, UCI offers 87 undergraduate degrees and 129 graduate and professional degrees, and roughly 30,000 undergraduates and 7,000 graduate students were enrolled at UCI as of Fall 2024. The university is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities ‚Äì Very high research activity&quot; and had $534.9 million in research and development expenditures in 2022. UCI became a member of the Association of American Universities in 1996.

The university administers the UC Irvine Medical Center, a large teaching hospital in Orange, and its affiliated health sciences system; the University of California, Irvine, Arboretum; and a portion of the University of California Natural Reserve System. UC Irvine set up the first Earth System Science Department in the United States. The university was rated as one of the &quot;Public Ivies&quot; in 1985 and 2001 surveys comparing publicly funded universities the authors claimed provide an education comparable to the Ivy League.

The UC Irvine Anteaters currently compete in the NCAA Division I as members of the Big West Conference. During the early years of the school&#x27;s existence, the teams played at the NCAA Division II level. The Anteaters have won 28 national championships in nine different team sports, 64 Anteaters have won individual national championships, and 53 Anteaters have competed in the Olympics, winning a total of 33 Olympic medals.

As of December 2024, the school has had 5 Nobel Prize laureates, 7 Pulitzer Prize winners, 6 MacArthur &quot;Genius Grant&quot; recipients, 60 Guggenheim Fellows, and 1 Turing Award winner affiliated with the university as alumni, faculty or researchers. In addition, of the current faculty, 24 have been named to the National Academy of Sciences, 7 have been named to the National Academy of Medicine, 17 to the National Academy of Engineering, 38 to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and 20 to the National Academy of Inventors. 

==History==

=== Early years ===
The University of California, Irvine (with San Diego and Santa Cruz) was one of three new University of California campuses established in the 1960s under the California Master Plan for Higher Education. During the 1950s, the University of California saw the need for the new campuses to handle the expected increase in enrollment from the post-war baby boom. One of the new campuses was to be in the Los Angeles area; the location selected was Irvine Ranch, an area of agricultural land bisecting Orange County from north to south. This site was chosen to accommodate the county&#x27;s growing population, complement the growth of nearby UCLA and UC Riverside, and allow for the construction of a master planned community in the surrounding area.


On June 20, 1964, U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson dedicated UC Irvine before a crowd of 15,000 people, and on October 4, 1965, the campus began operations with 1,589 students, 241 staff members, 119 faculty, and 43 teaching assistants. However, many of UCI&#x27;s buildings were still under construction and landscaping was still in progress, with the campus only at 75% completion. By June 25, 1966, UCI held its first Commencement with fourteen students, which conferred ten Bachelor of Arts degrees, three Master of Arts degrees, and one Doctor of Philosophy degree.

===Development and recent history===
Unlike most other University of California campuses, UCI was not named for the city it was built in; at the time of the university&#x27;s founding (1965), the current city of Irvine (incorporated in 1971) did not exist. The name &quot;Irvine&quot; is a reference to James Irvine, a landowner who administered the Irvine Ranch. In 1960, The Irvine Company sold of the Irvine Ranch to the University of California for one dollar, since company policy prohibited the donation of property to a public entity. On campus, UC Irvine&#x27;s first Chancellor, Daniel G. Aldrich selected a wide variety of Mediterranean-climate flora and fauna, feeling that it served an &quot;aesthetic, environmental, and educational [purpose].&quot; To plan the remainder of the ranch, the university hired William Pereira and Associates. Pereira intended for the UC Irvine campus to complement the neighboring community, and it became clear that the original grant would not suffice. In 1964, the university purchased an additional in 1964 for housing and commercial developments.

Much of the land that was not purchased by UCI (which is now occupied by the cities of Irvine, Tustin, and Newport Beach) remains held by The Irvine Company, but the completion of the university rapidly drove the development of Orange County. The City of Irvine became incorporated and established in 1971 and 1975, respectively. UCI remains the second-largest employer in Orange County, with an annual economic impact of $5 billion.

Aldrich developed the campus&#x27;s first academic plan around a College of Letters and Science, a Graduate School of Administration, and a School of Engineering. The &quot;principal author&quot; of the plan was Ivan Hinderaker, who served under Aldrich as UCI&#x27;s vice-chancellor for academic affairs before departing to become the second chancellor of UC Riverside. The UCI College of Letters and Science was to be divided into five divisions which together would initially offer about a dozen majors: Biological Sciences, Fine Arts, Humanities, Physical Sciences, and Social Sciences. It was Hinderaker who came up with the idea &quot;to appoint deans with strong authority for each of the divisions and to give them as much freedom as possible in determining the internal organization of their divisions&quot;. In 1967, the UCI Academic Senate voted to redesignate the divisions as &quot;schools&quot;, with all their deans reporting directly to the vice chancellor for academic affairs. This is why schools became the dominant academic unit at UCI, in contrast to the relatively large colleges at the older UC campuses.

In 1967, the California College of Medicine (originally a school of osteopathy founded in 1896 and the oldest continuously operating medical college in the Southwest) became part of UC Irvine. In 1976, plans to establish an on-campus hospital were set aside, with the university instead purchasing the Orange County Medical Center (renamed the UC Irvine Medical Center) around 12 miles from UC Irvine, in the City of Orange.

In early July 2018, UC Irvine removed benefactor Francisco J. Ayala&#x27;s name from its biology school and central science library after an internal investigation by the university&#x27;s Office of Equal Opportunity and Diversity substantiated a number of sexual harassment claims. Chancellor Gillman also authorized the removal of the Ayala name from graduate fellowships, scholar programs, and endowed chairs. Ayala resigned July 1, 2018 and was ordered to abstain from future university activities, following the university&#x27;s consultative procedures that include a faculty review committee. The results from the investigation were compiled in a 97-page report, which included testimony from victims of Ayala.

== Campus ==

The layout of the core campus resembles a rough circle with its center being Aldrich Park (initially known as Campus Park), lined up by the Ring Mall and buildings surrounding the road. To further emphasize the layout, academic units are positioned relative to the center, wherein undergraduate schools are closer to the center than the graduate schools.

Aldrich Park is planted with over 11,120 trees (there are over 24,000 trees on the entire campus), including 33 species of eucalyptus. Two ceremonial trees were planted in 1990, one for Arbor Day and the second for former chancellor Daniel Aldrich who had died that year. On the first anniversary of the September 11th tragedies, the chancellor planted a bay laurel tree in remembrance of the heroes and victims of the events of September 11, 2001. The tree itself was a gift from the UCI Staff Assembly. Aldrich Park is the site for &quot;Wayzgoose&quot;, a medieval student festival held each year in conjunction with the &quot;Celebrate UCI&quot; open house. It also hosts many extracurricular activities.

Ring Mall is the main pedestrian road used by students and faculty to travel around the core campus. The road measures up to a perfect mile and completely encircles Aldrich Park. Most schools and libraries are lined up by this road with each of these schools having their own central plaza which also connects to the Aldrich Park.

Other areas of the university outside of the core campus such as the School of Arts are connected by four pedestrian bridges. Beyond the core campus and the bridges, the layout of the campus is more suburban.
=== Surroundings ===
Irvine, California consistently ranks as the safest city in the United States. UCI is close to the beaches, mountains, and attractions of Southern California. Disneyland is approximately 20 minutes away by car. While the university is located in Irvine, the campus is directly bounded by the city of Newport Beach and the community of Newport Coast. The western side of the campus borders the San Diego Creek and the San Joaquin Freshwater Marsh Reserve, through which Campus Drive connects UCI to the 405 freeway. The northern and eastern sides of UCI are adjacent to Irvine proper; the eastern side of the campus is delineated by Bonita Canyon Road, which turns into Culver Drive at its northern terminus. California State Route 73 marks UCI&#x27;s southern boundary and separates the campus from Newport Beach.

The &quot;North Campus&quot; houses the Facilities Management Department, the Faculty Research Facility, Central Receiving, Fleet Services, the Air Pollution Health Effects Laboratory, and numerous other functions. It is located next to the UCI Arboretum; both the North Campus and the arboretum are located about from the main campus.

William Pereira&#x27;s original street layout for the region surrounding the university had a wingnut-shaped loop road as the main thoroughfare, which twice crossed the campus. However, the Irvine Company&#x27;s development plans expanded before it could be completed, and portions of California, Carlson, Harvard and Turtle Rock roads today constitute segments of what would have been the Loop Road.

Despite the suburban environment, a variety of wildlife inhabits the university&#x27;s central park, open fields, and wetlands. The university is home to cougar, hawks, golden eagles, great blue herons, squirrels, opossums, peregrine falcons, rabbits, raccoons, owls, skunks, weasels, bats, and coyotes. The UCI Arboretum hosts a collection of plants from California and Mediterranean climates around the world. The rabbits in particular can be seen across campus in high numbers, especially during hours of low student traffic.

=== Architecture ===

The first buildings were designed by a team of architects led by William Pereira and including A. Quincy Jones and William Blurock. The initial landscaping, including Aldrich Park, was designed by an association of three firms, including that of the noted urban-landscaping innovator Robert Herrick Carter. Aldrich Park was designed under the direction of landscape architect Gene Uematsu, and was modeled after Frederick Law Olmsted&#x27;s designs for New York City&#x27;s Central Park. The campus opened in 1965 with the inner circle and park only half-completed. There were only nine buildings and a dirt road connecting the main campus to the housing units. Only three of the six &quot;spokes&quot; that radiate from the central park were built, with only two buildings each. Pereira was retained by the university to maintain a continuity of style among the buildings constructed in the inner ring around the park, the last of which was completed in 1974. These buildings were designed with the appearance of being displayed on &quot;pedestals&quot; (containing the first floor and basement levels) that elevated them above the rolling terrain, with distinctive white railings evoking the deck of an ocean liner. They additionally feature an elevated second pedestrian level above ground, originally intended as a &quot;skyway&quot; to connect all the buildings in each of the six &quot;spokes&quot;.
Construction on the campus all but ceased after the Administration building, Aldrich Hall, was completed in 1974, and then resumed in the late 1980s, beginning a massive building boom that still continues today. This second building boom continued the futuristic trend, but emphasized a much more colorful, postmodern approach that somewhat contradicted the earthy, organic designs of the early buildings. Architects such as Frank Gehry, Robert Venturi, Eric Owen Moss, James Stirling and Arthur Erickson were brought in to bring the campus more up to date. The recession in the early 1990s along with internal politics led to a change in direction, due to the reduced capital budget, and changing attitudes towards architectural innovation at the university. This, in turn, led to a &quot;contextualist&quot; approach beginning in the late 1990s combining stylistic elements of the first two phases in an attempt to provide an architectural &quot;middle ground&quot; between the two vastly different styles. Gehry&#x27;s building was recently removed from campus to make way for a new building, with a design that has been called a &quot;big beige box with bands of bricks&quot;. In 2009 the Humanities Gateway building, designed by Curtis W. Fentress, was opened. Its curvilinear design marked a return to the sculptural treatment of concrete begun by Pereira.

As of 2005, the campus has more than 200 buildings and encompasses most of the university&#x27;s . The campus is in the midst of a $1.1 billion construction campaign.

=== Libraries and study centers ===


In addition to holding a noted critical theory archive and Southeast Asian archive, the Libraries also contain extensive collections in Dance and Performing Arts, Regional History, and more. Additionally, Langson Library hosts an extensive East Asian collection with materials in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.

Nearly all departments and schools on campus complement the resources of the UC Irvine Libraries by maintaining their own reading rooms and scholarly meeting rooms. They contain small reference collections and are the choice for more intimate lectures, graduate seminars, and study sessions. There is also the large Gateway Study Center located across from Langson Library, one of the university&#x27;s original buildings and under the custody of UC Irvine Libraries. Having served formerly as a cafeteria and student center, it is now a dual-use computer lab and study area which is open nearly 24 hours.

The UCI Student Center offers a large number of study areas, auditoriums, and two food courts, and therefore is one of the most popular places to study on campus. UC Irvine also has a number of computer labs that serve as study centers. The School of Humanities maintains the Humanities Instructional Resource Center, a drop-in computer lab specializing in language and digital media. Additionally, UCI maintains five other drop-in labs, four instructional computer labs, and a number of reservation-only SmartClassrooms, some of which are open 24 hours. Other popular study areas include Aldrich Park, the Cross-Cultural Center, the Locus (a study room and computer lab used by the Campuswide Honors Program), and plazas located in every school.

=== Tunnels ===
A network of tunnels runs between many of the major buildings on campus and the Central Plant, with the major trunk passage located beneath Ring Mall. Smaller tunnels branch off from this main passage to reach individual buildings, carrying electrical and air-conditioning utilities from the Central Plant. These tunnels have been the subject of much campus lore, the most popular story being that the tunnels were constructed to facilitate the safe evacuation of faculty in the event of a student riot. The main tunnel actually contains an above-ground section, in the form of the interior of an unusually thick pedestrian bridge near the Engineering Tower, in an area where the Ring Mall crosses between two hills. The tunnels are only accessible to maintenance staff, although there are also publicly accessible tunnels which intersect the utility tunnels, such as the one that goes between the main Information &amp; Computer Science building and the Engineering Tower.

==Washington Center==

The University of California, Irvine, created the University of California, Washington Center (UCDC) program in 1982. It is a student program of the university, located on Scott Circle in Downtown Washington (
). The center serves as the headquarters of the University of California Office of Federal Governmental Relations and supports UC students interning in the District of Columbia. UC Washington Center is currently led by UC Santa Cruz economist Helen Shapiro.

== Governance ==
Like other University of California campuses, UC Irvine operates under a system of shared governance, or a partnership between the Chancellor and his administration and the faculty through the Academic Senate. The Chancellor is the chief campus officer and has authority over the campus budget. The Academic Senate has authority to determine the conditions for admission and supervise courses and curricula. The Chancellor is nominated by and is responsible to the Regents of the University of California and the UC President.

After the Chancellor, the second most senior official is the Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost, the university&#x27;s chief academic and operating officer. Every school on campus reports to the Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost through a Dean, and all other academic and administrative units report to his office through a Vice Chancellor or chief administrator. A partial list of these units includes Campus Recreation, Intercollegiate Athletics, Planning and Budget, Student Affairs, UC Irvine Libraries, UC Irvine Medical Center, and University Advancement.

== Academics ==
=== Academic units ===

UC Irvine&#x27;s academic units are referred to as schools. As of the 2023-2024 school year, there were fifteen schools and several interdisciplinary programs. The College of Health Sciences was established in 2004, but no longer exists as a separate academic unit. On November 16, 2006, the University of California Regents approved the establishment of the School of Law. The School of Education was established by the UC Regents in 2012. In 2016, the university announced that it had received a $40 million donation from Bill Gross&#x27; philanthropic foundation to turn its nursing science program into the Sue and Bill Gross School of Nursing. The UC Regents formally approved the establishment of the school in January 2017. In July 2020, the UC Regents approved the establishment of the School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences. In July of 2024, UCI received a gift of $50 million to support the transition of the former Program in Public health to the Joseph C Wen School of Population and Public Health, named for the donor and his family. Supplementary education programs offer accelerated or community education in the form of Summer Session and UC Irvine Extension.

The academic units consist of (with their founding in parentheses):
*Claire Trevor School of the Arts (1970)
*Charlie Dunlop School of Biological Sciences (1965)
*Paul Merage School of Business (1965)
*School of Education (1967)
*Henry Samueli School of Engineering (1965)
*School of Humanities (1965)
*Donald Bren School of Information &amp; Computer Sciences (2002)
*Interdisciplinary Studies (1992)
*School of Law (2007)
*School of Physical Sciences (1965)
*School of Social Ecology (1970)
*School of Social Sciences (1965)
*School of Medicine (1896)
*Sue &amp; Bill Gross School of Nursing (2007)
*School of Pharmacy &amp; Pharmaceutical Sciences (2020)
*Joseph C. Wen School of Population and Public Health (2024)

=== Health care ===

=== Admissions ===
UC Irvine is categorized by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; as &quot;most selective&quot; for college admissions in the United States. It was the third-most selective University of California campus for the freshman class entering in the fall of 2019, as measured by the ratio of admitted students to applicants (behind UC Berkeley and UCLA). UC Irvine received 119,210 applications for admission to the fall 2022 incoming freshman class and 25,213 were admitted, making UC Irvine&#x27;s acceptance rate 21% for fall 2022. The first-year median weighted GPA was 4.22 for fall 2022. The incoming 2018 freshmen were predominantly from Los Angeles County, followed by Orange County, the Bay Area counties, San Bernardino County, Riverside County, and San Diego County.

The most popular major for freshmen is a major in the School of Biological Sciences (22%), followed by Undecided/Undeclared (20.6%), Social Sciences (17.4%), Engineering (11.7%), Humanities (8.8%), Physical Sciences (6.1%), Arts (5%), Social Ecology (5%), Information and Computer Sciences (3%), and Health Sciences (0.2%). The average freshman&#x27;s incoming high school GPA was 3.95. The average SAT scores were 602 (Critical Reasoning), 640 (Mathematics), and 612 (Writing), while the ACT composite score was 26. SAT verbal scores for the middle 50% were 550 and 660, while SAT math scores ranged between 580 and 700.

The choice to offer admission is based on the University of California&#x27;s comprehensive review program, which considers a candidate&#x27;s personal situation, community involvement, extracurricular activities, and academic potential in addition to the traditional high school academic record, personal statement, and entrance examination scores. While residency is not a factor in admission, it is a factor in tuition expenses, with out-of-state residents fees much greater than California residents. Since the approval of Proposition 209 in November 1996, California state law has prohibited all public universities (including UC Irvine) from practicing affirmative action as part of their admissions processes.

== Discoveries and innovation ==

=== Machine Learning Repository ===
The University of California Irvine hosts the UCI Machine Learning Repository, a data resource which is very popular among machine learning researchers and data mining practitioners. It was created in 1987 and contains 622 datasets from several domains including biology, medicine, physics, engineering, social sciences, games, and others. The datasets contained in the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository have been used by thousands of students and researchers in the computer science community and facilitated the publication of approximately 26 thousand scientific articles.

== Student life ==

=== Fraternities and sororities ===
The first fraternities and sororities at UCI began in 1973 with three sororities and three fraternities.

=== Clubs and organizations ===
There are around 600 student clubs and organizations on campus. Campus activities throughout the year include cultural nights, arts performances, and live music at Anteater Plaza. Special events such as Summerlands, Wayzgoose, Shocktoberfest, Soulstice, and Earth Day are held yearly. ASUCI, the university&#x27;s undergraduate student government, traditionally organizes a world record attempt by the university at the beginning of each academic year. UCI has won Guinness World Records for the largest game of capture the flag six times, with the most recent one in September 2015. In addition, the university has broken the record for the largest game of dodgeball three years straight. They have also won records for largest water pistol fight and largest pillow fight.

On November 30, 2007, the Office of Civil Rights of the United States Department of Education issued a report finding insufficient evidence in support of allegations that Jewish students at UCI were harassed and subjected to a hostile environment based on their religious beliefs. The agency ultimately found that none of the incidents leading to the allegations qualified as &quot;sufficiently severe, pervasive or persistent as to interfere with or limit the ability of an individual to participate in from the services, activities or privileges&quot; provided by UCI, and that university officials had acted appropriately in response to each incident. In December 2007, UCI Administration was cleared of anti-semitism complaints by the US Department of Education&#x27;s Office for Civil Rights. Following a speech by Chancellor Drake at the national Hillel meeting in Washington, D.C. in March 2008, Anteaters for Israel, along with three other Jewish organizations, issued a press release defending Drake and claiming that anti-Semitic activity was &quot;exaggerated&quot;.

==== Irvine 11 controversy ====

In 2010, eleven students from the Muslim Student Union disrupted a speech by Israeli Ambassador Michael Oren. The students and the student&#x27;s union involved were first disciplined by UCI and then had criminal charges brought against them. They were convicted of misdemeanor charges and sentenced to three years probation, community service, and fines. This led to a debate on whether the students&#x27; protest was free speech and whether filing criminal charges against them was fair after UCI had already disciplined them. Critics argued that the students were victims of selective prosecution and that they were targeted because they were Muslims and supported the Palestinians.

=== Residential accommodations ===
UC Irvine has a number of residential options for students interested in living on campus. Part of UCI&#x27;s long-range development plan involves expanding on-campus housing to accommodate 50% of all UCI students.

==== Middle Earth ====

Middle Earth is a student housing complex that houses approximately 1,690 students in 24 residence halls, one dining facility (Brandywine), a student center, and several resource centers. Each hall houses about fifty to eighty students, although Quenya was built with sixty single suite rooms which mainly house graduate students. The names of the halls and other facilities were selected from J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s legendarium.

Middle Earth is located along Ring Road, toward the core of the university&#x27;s campus. The residence halls were built in three consecutive phases, beginning in 1974. The first phase was designed by William Pereira. The first phase included seven halls: Hobbiton, Isengard, Lorien, Mirkwood, Misty Mountain, Rivendell, and the Shire, along with a separate Head Resident&#x27;s manufactured home called &quot;Bag End&quot;. The second phase was built in 1989 with thirteen more halls: Balin, Harrowdale, Whispering Wood, Woodhall, Calmindon, Grey Havens, Aldor, Rohan, Gondolin, Snowbourn, Elrond, Shadowfax, and Quenya. The third phase was built in 2000 with four halls: Crickhollow, Evenstar, Oakenshield, and Valimar. The last phase was completed in the summer of 2019 and officially opened September 16, 2019; although reported in the media as being called the two towers of Middle Earth, its two buildings are actually named Telperion and Laurelin, after the Two Trees of Valinor. These towers house around 494 undergraduate students.

== Athletics ==
UC Irvine&#x27;s sports teams are known as the Anteaters and the student body is known as Antourage. They currently participate in the NCAA&#x27;s Division I, as members of the Big West Conference and the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation. In the early years of the school&#x27;s existence, the teams participated at the NCAA Division II level with great success as explained in the UC Irvine Anteaters page. UC Irvine fields nationally competitive teams in baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, track and field, volleyball and water polo. The university has won 28 national championships in nine different sports, and fielded 64 individual national champions, 53 Olympians and over 500 All-Americans.

The university&#x27;s most recent NCAA Division I national championship was won by the men&#x27;s volleyball team in 2013. UC Irvine men&#x27;s volleyball won four national championships in 2007, 2009, 2012 and 2013.

UC Irvine won three NCAA Division I men&#x27;s water polo titles, with championships in 1970, 1982 and 1989.

UC Irvine Anteaters baseball won back-to-back national championships at the NCAA College Division College World Series and the NCAA Division II College World Series in 1973 and 1974. Anteater baseball moved to the NCAA Division I level. The 2007 baseball team finished 3rd at the College World Series, and in 2009 the baseball team earned a No. 1 national ranking in NCAA Division I polls from Baseball America and Collegiate Baseball for the first time, as well as a national seed and the right to host an NCAA Regional. The 2014 baseball team returned to the College World Series and finished 5th.

UCI Anteater&#x27;s golf team won the NCAA Division II national team championship in 1975 with team member Jerry Wisz winning the individual title. At the NCAA national championships in 1973, 1974 and 1976, those teams finished second twice and fourth the other year. These teams included seven All-Americans.

In 2015, for the first time, the UC Irvine Anteaters men&#x27;s basketball team appeared in the Division I tournament. It was narrowly defeated in a first-round tournament game by Louisville. The Anteaters made their second NCAA appearance in 2019, beating fourth-seed Kansas State University for their first March Madness win ever.

=== Anteater as mascot ===
The anteater was chosen in 1965 when students were allowed to submit mascot candidates, which would be voted on in a campus election. Three undergraduates named Pat Glasgow, Bob Ernst, and Schuyler Hadley Basset III were credited with choosing the anteater and designing a cartoon representation, having been disappointed with other candidates such as a roadrunner, unicorn, seahawk and golden bison.

While often attributed to the Johnny Hart comic strip &quot;B.C.&quot;, the original anteater design was based on the &quot;Playboy&quot; bunny.

In August 2007, a small stuffed anteater accompanied astronaut Tracy Caldwell on Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot; mission STS-118.

Following the 2015 men&#x27;s basketball team&#x27;s inaugural appearance in the NCAA Division I tournament, &quot;Mashable&quot; named Peter the Anteater the winner of its &quot;Mascot Madness&quot; tournament. The mascot also appeared on an episode of &quot;Conan&quot;.

Since 2019, anonymous students distribute &quot;Petr [&quot;sic&quot;] stickers&quot;, a satiric misspelling of Peter. These stickers are designed with unique designs in limited quantities, and the distribution location is posted on Instagram spontaneously, encouraging students to run to collect them.

Thomas Keneally was a visiting professor at UCI in 1985 (when he taught the graduate fiction workshop) and again from 1991 to 1995 (when he was a visiting professor in the writing program). Keneally is most famous for his book &quot;Schindler&#x27;s Ark&quot; (1982) (later republished as &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;), which won the Booker Prize and is the basis of the film &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; that was directed by Steven Spielberg.

The Comparative Literature and Philosophy departments at Irvine have accommodated distinguished intellectuals of international acclaim, including Jacques Derrida, a philosopher and critic most commonly associated with postmodern and post-structuralist thought, who held a position at the University of California, Irvine Department of Comparative Literature from 1986 to his death in 2004; his colleague, Jean-Fran√ßois Lyotard, who taught at UCI from 1987 until 1994; Fellow at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, British philosopher Margaret Gilbert best known for her founding contributions to the analytic philosophy of social phenomena; and British philosopher and FRSE Duncan Pritchard.

The Philosophy Department is also home to several other renowned philosophers, such as Kate Ritchie, who is known for her work in philosophy of language; Sven Bernecker, known for his work in epistemology; Annalisa Coliva, known for her work in epistemology; and Casey Perin, who is known for his work in ancient philosophy.

In addition to the Department of Philosophy at UCI, its sister department, the Department of Logic and Philosophy of Science, which together are ranked as one of the top philosophy programs in the world, also accommodates philosophers such as Brian Skyrms, known for his contributions on game theory and social norms; Jeffrey A. Barrett, known for his contributions to philosophy of physics; and Kai Wehmeier, known for his contributions to Frege.

Ralph J. Cicerone, an earth system science professor and former chancellor of UCI, served as president of the National Academy of Sciences from 2005 to 2016.

Three UCI faculty members have been named National Medal of Science recipients. In January 2009, UCI Professor Reg Penner won the Faraday Medal for his research with nanowires.

<text>Goldbach&#x27;s conjecture is one of the oldest and best-known unsolved problems in number theory and all of mathematics. It states that every even natural number greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers.

The conjecture has been shown to hold for all integers less than but remains unproven despite considerable effort.

==History==

=== Origins ===
On 7 June 1742, the Prussian mathematician Christian Goldbach wrote a letter to Leonhard Euler (letter XLIII), in which he proposed the following conjecture:

Goldbach was following the now-abandoned convention of considering 1 to be a prime number, so that a sum of units would be a sum of primes.
He then proposed a second conjecture in the margin of his letter, which implies the first:
Euler replied in a letter dated 30 June 1742 and reminded Goldbach of an earlier conversation they had had (&quot;&quot;), in which Goldbach had remarked that the first of those two conjectures would follow from the statement

This is in fact equivalent to his second, marginal conjecture.
In the letter dated 30 June 1742, Euler stated:
===Similar conjecture by Descartes===
Ren√© Descartes wrote that &quot;Every even number can be expressed as the sum of at most three primes.&quot; The proposition is equivalent to Goldbach&#x27;s conjecture, and Paul Erd≈ës said that &quot;Descartes actually discovered this before Goldbach... but it is better that the conjecture was named for Goldbach because, mathematically speaking, Descartes was infinitely rich and Goldbach was very poor.&quot;

=== Partial results ===
The strong Goldbach conjecture is much more difficult than the weak Goldbach conjecture, which says that every odd integer greater than 5 is the sum of three primes. Using Vinogradov&#x27;s method, Nikolai Chudakov, Johannes van der Corput, and Theodor Estermann showed (1937‚Äì1938) that almost all even numbers can be written as the sum of two primes (in the sense that the fraction of even numbers up to some which can be so written tends towards 1 as increases). In 1930, Lev Schnirelmann proved that any natural number greater than 1 can be written as the sum of not more than prime numbers, where is an effectively computable constant; see Schnirelmann density. Schnirelmann&#x27;s constant is the lowest number with this property. Schnirelmann himself obtained . This result was subsequently enhanced by many authors, such as Olivier Ramar√©, who in 1995 showed that every even number is in fact the sum of at most 6 primes. The best known result currently stems from the proof of the weak Goldbach conjecture by Harald Helfgott, which directly implies that every even number is the sum of at most 4 primes.

In 1924, Hardy and Littlewood showed under the assumption of the generalized Riemann hypothesis that the number of even numbers up to violating the Goldbach conjecture is much less than for small .

In 1948, using sieve theory methods, Alfr√©d R√©nyi showed that every sufficiently large even number can be written as the sum of a prime and an almost prime with at most factors. Chen Jingrun showed in 1973 using sieve theory that every sufficiently large even number can be written as the sum of either two primes, or a prime and a semiprime (the product of two primes). See Chen&#x27;s theorem for further information.

In 1975, Hugh Lowell Montgomery and Bob Vaughan showed that &quot;most&quot; even numbers are expressible as the sum of two primes. More precisely, they showed that there exist positive constants and such that for all sufficiently large numbers , every even number less than is the sum of two primes, with at most exceptions. In particular, the set of even integers that are not the sum of two primes has density zero.

In 1951, Yuri Linnik proved the existence of a constant such that every sufficiently large even number is the sum of two primes and at most powers of 2. J√°nos Pintz and Imre Ruzsa found in 2020 that works. Assuming the generalized Riemann hypothesis, also works, as shown by Roger Heath-Brown and Jan-Christoph Schlage-Puchta in 2002.

A proof for the weak conjecture was submitted in 2013 by Harald Helfgott to &quot;Annals of Mathematics Studies&quot; series. Although the article was accepted, Helfgott decided to undertake the major modifications suggested by the referee. Despite several revisions, Helfgott&#x27;s proof has not yet appeared in a peer-reviewed publication. The weak conjecture is implied by the strong conjecture, as if is a sum of two primes, then is a sum of three primes. However, the converse implication and thus the strong Goldbach conjecture would remain unproven if Helfgott&#x27;s proof is correct.

=== Computational results ===
For small values of , the strong Goldbach conjecture (and hence the weak Goldbach conjecture) can be verified directly. For instance, in 1938, Nils Pipping laboriously verified the conjecture up to . With the advent of computers, many more values of have been checked; T. Oliveira e Silva ran a distributed computer search that has verified the conjecture for (and double-checked up to ) as of 2013. One record from this search is that is the smallest number that cannot be written as a sum of two primes where one is smaller than 9781.

=== In popular culture ===
&quot;Goldbach&#x27;s Conjecture&quot; () is the title of the biography of Chinese mathematician and number theorist Chen Jingrun, written by Xu Chi.

The conjecture is a central point in the plot of the 1992 novel &quot;Uncle Petros and Goldbach&#x27;s Conjecture&quot; by Greek author Apostolos Doxiadis, in the short story &quot;Sixty Million Trillion Combinations&quot; by Isaac Asimov and also in the 2008 mystery novel &quot;No One You Know&quot; by Michelle Richmond.

Goldbach&#x27;s conjecture is part of the plot of the 2007 Spanish film &quot;Fermat&#x27;s Room&quot;.

Goldbach&#x27;s conjecture is featured as the main topic of research of actress Ella Rumpf&#x27;s character Marguerite in the 2023 French-Swiss film &quot;Marguerite&#x27;s Theorem&quot;.

== Formal statement ==
Each of the three conjectures has a natural analog in terms of the modern definition of a prime, under which 1 is excluded. A modern version of the first conjecture is:

A modern version of the marginal conjecture is:

And a modern version of Goldbach&#x27;s older conjecture of which Euler reminded him is:

These modern versions might not be entirely equivalent to the corresponding original statements. For example, if there were an even integer larger than 4, for a prime, that could not be expressed as the sum of two primes in the modern sense, then it would be a counterexample to the modern version of the third conjecture (without being a counterexample to the original version). The modern version is thus probably stronger (but in order to confirm that, one would have to prove that the first version, freely applied to any positive even integer , could not possibly rule out the existence of such a specific counterexample ). In any case, the modern statements have the same relationships with each other as the older statements did. That is, the second and third modern statements are equivalent, and either implies the first modern statement.

The third modern statement (equivalent to the second) is the form in which the conjecture is usually expressed today. It is also known as the &quot;strong&quot;, &quot;even&quot;, or &quot;binary&quot; Goldbach conjecture. A weaker form of the second modern statement, known as &quot;Goldbach&#x27;s weak conjecture&quot;, the &quot;odd Goldbach conjecture&quot;, or the &quot;ternary Goldbach conjecture&quot;, asserts that 
==Heuristic justification==

Statistical considerations that focus on the probabilistic distribution of prime numbers present informal evidence in favour of the conjecture (in both the weak and strong forms) for sufficiently large integers: the greater the integer, the more ways there are available for that number to be represented as the sum of two or three other numbers, and the more &quot;likely&quot; it becomes that at least one of these representations consists entirely of primes.

A very crude version of the heuristic probabilistic argument (for the strong form of the Goldbach conjecture) is as follows. The prime number theorem asserts that an integer selected at random has roughly a chance of being prime. Thus if is a large even integer and is a number between 3 and , then one might expect the probability of and simultaneously being prime to be . If one pursues this heuristic, one might expect the total number of ways to write a large even integer as the sum of two odd primes to be roughly

: formula_1

Since , this quantity goes to infinity as increases, and one would expect that every large even integer has not just one representation as the sum of two primes, but in fact very many such representations.

This heuristic argument is actually somewhat inaccurate because it assumes that the events of and being prime are statistically independent of each other. For instance, if is odd, then is also odd, and if is even, then is even, a non-trivial relation because, besides the number 2, only odd numbers can be prime. Similarly, if is divisible by 3, and was already a prime other than 3, then would also be coprime to 3 and thus be slightly more likely to be prime than a general number. Pursuing this type of analysis more carefully, G. H. Hardy and John Edensor Littlewood in 1923 conjectured (as part of their &quot;Hardy‚ÄìLittlewood prime tuple conjecture&quot;) that for any fixed , the number of representations of a large integer as the sum of primes with should be asymptotically equal to

: formula_2

where the product is over all primes , and is the number of solutions to the equation in modular arithmetic, subject to the constraints . This formula has been rigorously proven to be asymptotically valid for from the work of Ivan Matveevich Vinogradov, but is still only a conjecture when . In the latter case, the above formula simplifies to 0 when is odd, and to

: formula_3

when is even, where is Hardy‚ÄìLittlewood&#x27;s twin prime constant

: formula_4

This is sometimes known as the &quot;extended Goldbach conjecture&quot;. The strong Goldbach conjecture is in fact very similar to the twin prime conjecture, and the two conjectures are believed to be of roughly comparable difficulty.

The &quot;Goldbach partition function&quot; is the function that associates to each even integer the number of ways it can be decomposed into a sum of two primes. Its graph looks like a comet and is therefore called Goldbach&#x27;s comet.

Goldbach&#x27;s comet suggests tight upper and lower bounds on the number of representations of an even number as the sum of two primes, and also that the number of these representations depend strongly on the value modulo 3 of the number.

== Related problems ==
Although Goldbach&#x27;s conjecture implies that every positive integer greater than one can be written as a sum of at most three primes, it is not always possible to find such a sum using a greedy algorithm that uses the largest possible prime at each step. The Pillai sequence tracks the numbers requiring the largest number of primes in their greedy representations.

Similar problems to Goldbach&#x27;s conjecture exist in which primes are replaced by other particular sets of numbers, such as the squares:
* It was proven by Lagrange that every positive integer is the sum of four squares. See Waring&#x27;s problem and the related Waring‚ÄìGoldbach problem on sums of powers of primes.
* Hardy and Littlewood listed as their Conjecture I: &quot;Every large odd number () is the sum of a prime and the double of a prime&quot;. This conjecture is known as Lemoine&#x27;s conjecture and is also called &quot;Levy&#x27;s conjecture&quot;.
* The Goldbach conjecture for practical numbers, a prime-like sequence of integers, was stated by Margenstern in 1984, and proved by Melfi in 1996: every even number is a sum of two practical numbers.
* Harvey Dubner proposed a strengthening of the Goldbach conjecture that states that every even integer greater than 4208 is the sum of two twin primes (not necessarily belonging to the same pair). Only 34 even integers less than 4208 are not the sum of two twin primes; Dubner has verified computationally that this list is complete up to formula_5 A proof of this stronger conjecture would not only imply Goldbach&#x27;s conjecture, but also the twin prime conjecture.
* According to Bertrand&#x27;s postulate, for every integer formula_6, there is always at least one prime formula_7 such that formula_8 If the postulate were false, there would exist some integer formula_9 for which no prime numbers lie between formula_9 and formula_11, making it impossible to express formula_11 as a sum of two primes. 

Goldbach&#x27;s conjecture is used when studying computation complexity. The connection is made through the Busy Beaver function, where BB(&quot;n&quot;) is the maximum number of steps taken by any &quot;n&quot; state Turing machine that halts. There is a 27-state Turing machine that halts if and only if Goldbach&#x27;s conjecture is false. Hence if BB(27) was known, and the Turing machine did not stop in that number of steps, it would be known to run forever and hence no counterexamples exist (which proves the conjecture true). This is a completely impractical way to settle the conjecture; instead it is used to suggest that BB(27) will be very hard to compute, at least as difficult as settling the Goldbach conjecture.

<text>Confectionery is the art of making confections, or sweet foods. Confections are items that are rich in sugar and carbohydrates although exact definitions are difficult. In general, however, confections are divided into two broad and somewhat overlapping categories: bakers&#x27; confections and sugar confections.

Bakers&#x27; confectionery, also called flour confections, includes principally sweet pastries, cakes, and similar baked goods. Baker&#x27;s confectionery excludes everyday breads, and thus is a subset of products produced by a baker.

Sugar confectionery includes candies (also called &quot;sweets&quot;, short for &quot;sweetmeats&quot;, in many English-speaking countries), candied nuts, chocolates, chewing gum, bubble gum, pastillage, and other confections that are made primarily of sugar. In some cases, chocolate confections (confections made of chocolate) are treated as a separate category, as are sugar-free versions of sugar confections. The words &quot;candy&quot; (Canada and US), &quot;sweets&quot; (UK, Ireland, and others), and &quot;lollies&quot; (Australia and New Zealand) are common words for some of the most popular varieties of sugar confectionery.

The occupation of confectioner encompasses the categories of cooking performed by both the French &quot;patissier&quot; (pastry chef) and the &quot;confiseur&quot; (sugar worker). The confectionery industry also includes specialized training schools and extensive historical records. Traditional confectionery goes back to ancient times and continued to be eaten through the Middle Ages and into the modern era.

==Etymology==

The oldest recorded use of the word confectionery discovered so far by the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; is by Richard Jonas in 1540, who spelled or misspelled it as &quot;confection nere&quot; in a passage &quot;Ambre, muske, frankencense, gallia muscata and confection nere&quot;, thus in the sense of &quot;things made or sold by a confectioner&quot;. Also according to the OED, the sense of &quot;the art and business of a confectioner&quot; is first recorded in 1743, and the earliest use in the sense of a &quot;confectioner&#x27;s shop&quot; dates to 1803.

==History==
Before sugar was readily available in the ancient western world, confectionery was based on honey. Honey was used in Ancient China, Ancient India, Ancient Egypt, Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome to coat fruits and flowers to preserve them or to create sweetmeats. Between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE, the Persians, followed by the Greeks, made contact with the Indian subcontinent and its &quot;reeds that produce honey without bees&quot;. They adopted and then spread sugar and sugarcane agriculture. Sugarcane is indigenous to tropical Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia.

In the early history of sugar usage in Europe, it was initially the apothecary who had the most important role in the production of sugar-based preparations. Medieval European physicians learned the medicinal uses of the material from the Arabs and Byzantine Greeks. One Middle Eastern remedy for rheums and fevers were little, twisted sticks of pulled sugar called in Arabic or &quot;&quot;. These became known in England as alphenics, or more commonly as penidia, penids, pennet or pan sugar. They were the precursors of barley sugar and modern cough drops. In 1390, the Earl of Derby paid &quot;two shillings for two pounds of penydes.&quot;

As the non-medicinal applications of sugar developed, the comfitmaker, or confectioner gradually came into being as a separate trade. In the late medieval period the words confyt, comfect or cumfitt were generic terms for all kinds of sweetmeats made from fruits, roots, or flowers preserved with sugar. By the 16th century, a cumfit was more specifically a seed, nut or small piece of spice enclosed in a round or ovoid mass of sugar. The production of comfits was a core skill of the early confectioner, who was known more commonly in 16th and 17th century England as a comfitmaker. Reflecting their original medicinal purpose, however, comfits were also produced by apothecaries and directions on how to make them appear in dispensatories as well as cookery texts. An early medieval Latin name for an apothecary was , and it was in this sort of sugar work that the activities of the two trades overlapped and that the word &quot;confectionery&quot; originated.

In the cuisine of the Late Ottoman Empire diverse cosmopolitan cultural influences were reflected in published recipes such as European-style molded jellies flavored with cordials. In Europe, Ottoman confections (especially &quot;lumps of delight&quot; (Turkish delight) became very fashionable among European and British high society. An important study of Ottoman confectionery called &quot;Conditorei des Orients&quot; was published by the royal confectioner Friedrich Unger in 1838.

The first confectionery in Manchester, England was opened by Elizabeth Raffald who had worked six years in domestic service as a housekeeper.

==Sweetening agents==
Confections are defined by the presence of sweeteners. These are usually sugars, but it is possible to buy sugar-free candies, such as sugar-free peppermints. The most common sweetener for home cooking is table sugar, which is chemically a disaccharide containing both glucose and fructose. Hydrolysis of sucrose gives a mixture called invert sugar, which is sweeter and is also a common commercial ingredient. Finally, confections, especially commercial ones, are sweetened by a variety of syrups obtained by hydrolysis of starch. These sweeteners include all types of corn syrup.

==Bakers&#x27; confectionery==

Bakers&#x27; confectionery includes sweet baked goods, especially those that are served for the dessert course. Bakers&#x27; confections are sweet foods that feature flour as a main ingredient and are baked. Major categories include cakes, sweet pastries, doughnuts, scones, and cookies. In the Middle East and Asia, flour-based confections predominate.

The definition of which foods are &quot;confectionery&quot; vs &quot;bread&quot; can vary based on cultures and laws. In Ireland, the definition of &quot;bread&quot; as a &quot;staple food&quot; for tax purposes requires that the sugar or fat content be no more than 2% of the weight of the flour, so some products sold as bread in the US would be treated as confectionery there.

=== Types ===
Cakes have a somewhat bread-like texture, and many earlier cakes, such as the centuries-old stollen (fruit cake), or the even older king cake, were rich yeast breads. The variety of styles and presentations extends from simple to elaborate. Major categories include butter cakes, tortes, and foam cakes. Confusingly, some confections that have the word &quot;cake&quot; in their names, such as cheesecake, are not technically cakes, while others, such as Boston cream pie are cakes despite seeming to be named something else.

Pastry is a large and diverse category of baked goods, united by the flour-based doughs used as the base for the product. These doughs are not always sweet, and the sweetness may come from the sugar, fruit, chocolate, cream, or other fillings that are added to the finished confection. Pastries can be elaborately decorated, or they can be plain dough.

Doughnuts may be fried or baked.

Scones and related sweet quick breads, such as bannock, are similar to baking powder biscuits and, in sweeter, less traditional interpretations, can seem like a cupcake.

Cookies are small, sweet baked treats. They originated as small cakes, and some traditional cookies have a soft, cake-like texture. Others are crisp or hard.

==Sugar confectionery==

Sugar confections include sweet, sugar-based foods, which are usually eaten as snack food. This includes sugar candies, chocolates, candied fruits and nuts, chewing gum, and sometimes ice cream. In some cases, chocolate confections are treated as a separate category, as are sugar-free versions of sugar confections.

Different dialects of English use regional terms for sugar confections:

*In Britain, Ireland, and some Commonwealth countries, &quot;sweets&quot; (the Scottish Gaelic word &quot;suiteis&quot; is a derivative). &quot;Candy&quot; is used specifically for rock candy and occasionally for (brittle) boiled sweets. &quot;Lollies&quot; are boiled sweets fixed on sticks.
*In Australia and New Zealand, &quot;lollies&quot;. &quot;Chewy&quot; and &quot;Chuddy&quot; are Australian slang for chewing gum.
*In North America, &quot;candy&quot;, although this term generally refers to a specific range of confectionery and does not include some items of sugar confectionery (e.g. ice cream). &quot;Sweet&quot; is occasionally used, as well as &quot;treat&quot;.

In the US, a chocolate-coated candy bar (e.g. Snickers) would be called a &quot;candy bar&quot;, in Britain more likely a &quot;chocolate bar&quot; than unspecifically a &quot;sweet&quot;.

===Classification===

The United Nations&#x27; International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC) scheme (revision 4) classifies both chocolate and sugar confectionery as ISIC 1073, which includes the manufacture of chocolate and chocolate confectionery; sugar confectionery proper (caramels, cachous, nougats, fondant, white chocolate), chewing gum, preserving fruit, nuts, fruit peels, and making confectionery lozenges and pastilles. In the European Union, the Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community (NACE) scheme (revision 2) matches the UN classification, under code number 10.82.

In the United States, the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS 2012) splits sugar confectionery across three categories: National industry code 311340 for all non-chocolate confectionery manufacturing, 311351 for chocolate and confectionery manufacturing from cacao beans, and national industry 311352 for confectionery manufacturing from purchased chocolate.

Ice cream and sorbet are classified with dairy products under ISIC 1050, NACE 10.52, and NAICS 311520.

===Examples===


Sugar confectionery items include candies, lollipops, candy bars, chocolate, cotton candy, and other sweet items of snack food. Some of the categories and types of sugar confectionery include the following:

*Chocolates: Bite-sized confectioneries generally made with chocolate, considered different from a candy bar made of chocolate.
*Divinity: A nougat-like confectionery based on egg whites with chopped nuts.
*Dodol: A toffee-like delicacy popular in Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines
*Drag√©e: Sugar-coated almonds and other types of sugar panned candies.
*Fudge: Made by boiling milk and sugar to the soft-ball stage. In the US, it tends to be chocolate-flavored.
*Halvah: Confectionery based on tahini, a paste made from ground sesame seeds.
*Hard candy: Based on sugars cooked to the hard-crack stage. Examples include lollipops, jawbreakers (or gobstoppers), lemon drops, peppermint drops and disks, candy canes, rock candy, etc. Also included are types often mixed with nuts such as brittle, which is similar to chikkis.
*Ice cream: Frozen, flavored cream, often containing small pieces of chocolate, fruits and/or nuts.
*Jelly candies: Including those based on sugar and starch, pectin, gum, or gelatin such as Turkish delight (lokum), jelly beans, gumdrops, jujubes, gummies, etc.
*Liquorice: Containing extract of the liquorice root, this candy is chewier and more resilient than gums or gelatin candies. For example, Liquorice allsorts. It has a similar taste to star anise.
*Marshmallow: For example, circus peanuts.
*Marzipan: An almond-based confection, doughy in consistency.
*Mithai: A generic term for confectionery in the Indian subcontinent, typically made from dairy products and/or some form of flour. Sugar or molasses are used as sweeteners.
*Persipan: similar to marzipan, but made with peaches or apricots instead of almonds.
*Pastillage: A thick sugar paste made with gelatin, water, and confectioner&#x27;s sugar, similar to gum paste, which is moulded into shapes, which then harden.
*Tablet: A crumbly milk-based soft and hard candy, based on sugars cooked to the soft ball stage. Comes in several forms, such as wafers and heart shapes. Not to be confused with tableting, a method of candy production.
*Taffy (British: &quot;chews&quot;): A sugar confection that is folded many times above 120¬†¬∞F (50¬†¬∞C), incorporating air bubbles thus reducing its density and making it opaque.
*Toffee: A confection made by caramelizing sugar or molasses along with butter. Toffee has a glossy surface and textures ranging from soft and sticky to a hard, brittle material. Its brown color and smoky taste arise from the caramelization of the sugars.

===Storage and shelf life===
Shelf life is largely determined by the amount of water present in the candy and the storage conditions. High-sugar candies, such as boiled candies, can have a shelf life of many years if kept covered in a dry environment. Spoilage of low-moisture candies tends to involve a loss of shape, color, texture, and flavor, rather than the growth of dangerous microbes. Impermeable packaging can reduce spoilage due to storage conditions.

Candies spoil more quickly if they have different amounts of water in different parts of the candy (for example, a candy that combines marshmallow and nougat), or if they are stored in high-moisture environments. This process is due to the effects of water activity, which results in the transfer of unwanted water from a high-moisture environment into a low-moisture candy, rendering it rubbery, or the loss of desirable water from a high-moisture candy into a dry environment, rendering the candy dry and brittle.

Another factor, affecting only non-crystalline amorphous candies, is the glass transition process. This can cause amorphous candies to lose their intended texture.

==Cultural roles==

Both bakers&#x27; and sugar confections are used to offer hospitality to guests.

Confections are used to mark celebrations or events, such as Christmas, Easter, a wedding cake, birthday cake, or Halloween. 

The chocolate company Cadbury (under the guidance of Richard Cadbury) was the first to commercialize the connection between romance and confectionery, producing a heart-shaped box of chocolates for Valentine&#x27;s Day in 1868. 

Tourists commonly eat confections as part of their travels. The indulgence in rich, sugary foods is seen as a special treat, and choosing local specialties is popular. For example, visitors to Vienna eat Sachertorte and visitors to seaside resorts in the UK eat Blackpool rock candy. Transportable confections like fudges and tablet may be purchased as souvenirs.

==Nutrition==
Generally, confections are low in micronutrients and protein but high in calories. They may be fat-free foods, although some confections, especially fried doughs and chocolate, are high-fat foods. Many confections are considered empty calories and ultra-processed foods. Specially formulated chocolate has been manufactured in the past for military use as a high-density food energy source.

Many sugar confections, especially caramel-coated popcorn and the different kinds of sugar candy, are defined in US law as foods of minimal nutritional value.

==Risks==

Contaminants and coloring agents in confectionery can be particularly harmful to children. Therefore, confectionery contaminants, such as high levels of lead, have been restricted to 1 ppm in the US. There is no specific maximum in the EU.

Candy colorants, particularly yellow colorants such as E102 Tartrazine, E104 Quinoline Yellow WS and E110 Sunset Yellow FCF, have many restrictions around the world. Tartrazine, for example, can cause allergic and asthmatic reactions and was once banned in Austria, Germany, and Norway. Some countries such as the UK have asked the food industry to phase out the use of these colorants, especially for products marketed to children.

<text>Coventry ( or rarely ) is a cathedral city and metropolitan borough in the West Midlands county, in England, on the River Sherbourne. Coventry had been a large settlement for centuries. Founded in the early Middle Ages, its city status was formally recognised in a charter of 1345. The city is governed by Coventry City Council, and the West Midlands Combined Authority.

Formerly part of Warwickshire until 1451, and again from 1842 to 1974, Coventry had a population of 345,324 at the 2021 census, making it the tenth largest city in England and the 13th largest in the United Kingdom.

It is the second largest city in the West Midlands region, after Birmingham, from which it is separated by an area of green belt known as the Meriden Gap; it is the third largest in the wider Midlands after Birmingham and Leicester. The city is part of a larger conurbation known as the Coventry and Bedworth Urban Area, which in 2021 had a population of 389,603.

Coventry is east-south-east of Birmingham, south-west of Leicester, north of Warwick and north-west of London. Coventry is also the most central city in England, being only south-west of the country&#x27;s geographical centre in Leicestershire.

Coventry became an important and wealthy city of national importance during the Middle Ages. Later it became an important industrial centre, becoming home to a large bicycle industry in the 19th century. In the 20th century, it became a major centre of the British motor industry; this made it a target for German air raids during the Second World War, and in November 1940, much of the historic city centre was destroyed by a large air raid.

The city was rebuilt after the war, and the motor industry thrived until the mid-1970s. However, by the late-1970s/early-1980s, Coventry was in an economic crisis, with one of the country&#x27;s highest levels of unemployment due to major plant closures and the collapse of the respective local supply-chain. In recent years, it has seen regeneration and an increase in population. The city also has three universities: Coventry University in the city centre, the University of Warwick on the southern outskirts and the smaller private Arden University with its headquarters close to Coventry Airport. In addition, Coventry was awarded UK City of Culture for 2021.

==History==

===Origins and toponymy===
The Romans founded a large fort on the outskirts of what is now Coventry at Baginton, next to the River Sowe; it has been excavated and partially reconstructed in modern times and is known as the Lunt Fort. The fort was probably constructed around AD 60 in connection with the Boudican revolt and then inhabited sporadically until around 280 AD.

The origins of the present settlement are obscure, but Coventry probably began as an Anglo-Saxon settlement. Although there are various theories of the origin of the name, the most widely accepted is that it was derived from &quot;Cofa&#x27;s tree&quot;; derived from a Saxon landowner called &quot;Cofa&quot;, and a tree which might have marked either the centre or the boundary of the settlement.

===Medieval===
Around a Saxon nunnery was founded here by St Osburga, which was later left in ruins by King Canute&#x27;s invading Danish army in 1016. Leofric, Earl of Mercia and his wife Lady Godiva built on the remains of the nunnery and founded a Benedictine monastery in 1043 dedicated to St Mary. It was during this time that the legend of Lady Godiva riding naked on horseback through the streets of Coventry, to protest against unjust taxes levied on the citizens of Coventry by her husband, was alleged to have occurred. Although this story is regarded as a myth by modern historians, it has become an enduring part of Coventry&#x27;s identity.

A market was established at the abbey gates and the settlement expanded. At the time of the Norman Conquest in 1066, Coventry was probably a modest sized town of around 1,200 inhabitants, and its own minster church.

Coventry Castle was a motte and bailey castle in the city. It was built in the early 12th¬†century by Ranulf de Gernon, 4th Earl of Chester. Its first known use was during The Anarchy when Robert Marmion, a supporter of King Stephen, expelled the monks from the adjacent priory of Saint Mary in 1144, and converted it into a fortress from which he waged a battle against the castle which was held by the Earl. Marmion perished in the battle. It was demolished in the late 12th¬†century. St Mary&#x27;s Guildhall was built on part of the site. It is assumed the name &quot;Broadgate&quot; comes from the area around the castle gates.

The Bishops of Lichfield were often referred to as the Bishops of Coventry and Lichfield, or Lichfield and Coventry (from 1102 to 1541), and in the medieval period Coventry was a major centre of pilgrimage of religion. The Benedictines, Carthusians, Carmelites and Franciscans all had religious houses in the city of Coventry. The Carthusian Priory of St Anne was built between 1381 and 1410 with royal patronage from King Richard II and his queen Anne of Bohemia Coventry has some surviving religious artworks from this time, such as the doom painting at Holy Trinity Church which features Christ in judgement, figures of the resurrected, and contrasting images of Heaven and Hell.

By the 13th¬†century, Coventry had become an important centre of the cloth trade, especially blue cloth dyed with woad and known as Coventry blue. Throughout the Middle Ages, it was one of the largest and most important cities in England, which at its Medieval height in the early 15th century had a population of up to 10,000, making it the most important city in the Midlands, and possibly the fourth largest in England behind London, York and Bristol. Reflecting its importance, in around 1355, work began on a defensive city wall, which, when finally finished around 175 years later in 1530, measured long, at least high, and up to thick, it had two towers and twelve gatehouses. Coventry&#x27;s city walls were described as one of the wonders of the late Middle Ages. Today, Swanswell Gate and Cook Street Gate are the only surviving gatehouses and they stand in the city centre framed by Lady Herbert&#x27;s Garden.

Coventry claimed the status of a city by ancient prescriptive usage, and was granted a charter of incorporation and coat of arms by King Edward III in 1345. The motto &quot;Camera Principis&quot; (the Prince&#x27;s Chamber) refers to Edward, the Black Prince. In 1451 Coventry became a county in its own right, a status it retained until 1842, when it was reincorporated into Warwickshire.

Coventry&#x27;s importance during the Middle Ages was such, that on a two occasions a national Parliament was held there, as well as a number of Great Councils. In 1404, King Henry IV summoned a parliament in Coventry as he needed money to fight rebellion, which wealthy cities such as Coventry lent to him. During the Wars of the Roses, the Royal Court was moved to Coventry by Margaret of Anjou, the wife of Henry VI, as she believed that London had become too unsafe. On several occasions between 1456 and 1459 parliament was held in Coventry, including the so-called Parliament of Devils. For a while Coventry served as the effective seat of government, but this would come to an end in 1461 when Edward IV was installed on the throne.

===Tudor period===

In 1506 the draper Thomas Bond founded Bond&#x27;s Hospital, an almshouse in Hill Street, to provide for 10 poor men and women. This was followed in 1509 with the founding of another almshouse, when the wool merchant William Ford founded Ford&#x27;s Hospital and Chantry on Greyfriars&#x27; Lane, to provide for 5 poor men and their wives.

Throughout the Middle Ages Coventry had been home several monastic orders and the city was badly hit by Henry VIII&#x27;s dissolution of the monasteries. Between 1539 and 1542, monasteries, priories and other properties belonging to the Carmelites, Greyfriars, Benedictines and Carthusians, were either sold off or dismantled. The greatest loss to the city was of Coventry&#x27;s first Cathedral, St Mary&#x27;s Priory and Cathedral which was mostly demolished, leaving only ruins, making it the only English Cathedral to be destroyed during the dissolution. Coventry would not have another Cathedral until 1918, when the parish church of St Michael was elevated to Cathedral status, and it was itself destroyed by enemy bombing in 1940. Coventry therefore has had the misfortune of losing its Cathedral twice in its history.

William Shakespeare, from nearby Stratford-upon-Avon, may have witnessed plays in Coventry during his boyhood or &#x27;teens&#x27;, and these may have influenced how his plays, such as &quot;Hamlet&quot;, came about.

===Civil War and aftermath===

During the English Civil War Coventry became a bastion of the Parliamentarians: In August 1642, a Royalist force led by King Charles I attacked Coventry. After a two-day battle, however, the attackers were unable to breach the city walls, and the city&#x27;s garrison and townspeople successfully repelled the attack, forcing the King&#x27;s forces to withdraw. During the Second Civil War many Scottish Royalist prisoners were held in Coventry; it is thought likely that the idiom &quot;sent to Coventry&quot;, meaning to ostracise someone, derived from this period, owing to the often hostile attitude displayed towards the prisoners by the city folk.

Following the restoration of the monarchy, as punishment for the support given to the Parliamentarians, King Charles II ordered that the city&#x27;s walls be slighted (damaged and made useless as defences) which was carried out in 1662.

===Industrial age===
In the 18th and early 19th centuries, silk ribbon weaving and watch and clock making became Coventry&#x27;s staple industries. In the 1780s, the silk ribbon weaving industry was estimated to employ around 10,000 weavers in Coventry, and its surrounding towns like Bedworth and Nuneaton. Coventry&#x27;s growth was aided by the opening of the Coventry Canal in 1769, which gave the city a connection to the growing national canal network. Nevertheless, during the 18th century, Coventry lost its status as the Midlands&#x27; most important city to nearby Birmingham, which overtook Coventry in size. During the same period, Coventry became one of the three main British centres of watch and clock manufacture and ranked alongside Prescot, in Lancashire and Clerkenwell in London. By the 1850s, Coventry had overshadowed its rivals to become the main centre of British watch and clock manufacture, which by that time employed around 2,000 people. The watch and clock industry produced a pool of highly skilled craftsmen, who specialised in producing precision components, and the &quot;Coventry Watchmakers&#x27; Association&quot; was founded in 1858.

As the city prospered industrially in the 18th and early 19th centuries, several Coventry newspapers were founded. These include &quot;Jopson&#x27;s Coventry Mercury,&quot; first issued by James Jopson of Hay Lane in 1741; the &quot;Coventry Gazette and Birmingham Chronicle&quot;, first published in 1757; the &quot;Coventry Herald,&quot; first published in 1808; the &quot;Coventry Observer,&quot; first published in 1827; and the &quot;Coventry Advertiser&quot;, first published in 1852.

The ribbon weaving and clock industries both rapidly collapsed after 1860, due to cheap imports following the Cobden‚ÄìChevalier free trade treaty, which flooded the market with cheaper French silks, and Swiss Made clocks and watches. For a while, this caused a devastating slump in Coventry&#x27;s economy.

A second wave of industrialisation, however, began soon after. Coventry&#x27;s pool of highly skilled workers attracted James Starley, who set up a company producing sewing machines in Coventry in 1861. Within a decade, he became interested in bicycles, and developed the penny-farthing design in 1870. His company soon began producing these bicycles, and Coventry soon became the centre of the British bicycle industry. Further innovation came from Starley&#x27;s nephew, John Kemp Starley, who developed the Rover safety bicycle, the first true modern bicycle with two equal-sized wheels and a chain drive in 1885. By the 1890s Coventry had the largest bicycle industry in the world, with numerous manufacturers, however bicycle manufacture went into steady decline from then on, and ended entirely in 1959, when the last bicycle manufacturer in the city relocated.

By the late-1890s, bicycle manufacture began to evolve into motor manufacture. The first motor car was made in Coventry in 1897, by the Daimler Company. Before long Coventry became established as one of the major centres of the British motor industry. In the early-to-mid 20th century, a number of famous names in the British motor industry became established in Coventry, including Alvis, Armstrong Siddeley, Daimler, Humber, Jaguar, Riley, Rootes, Rover, Singer, Standard, Swift and Triumph. Thanks to the growth of the car industry attracting workers, Coventry&#x27;s population doubled between 1901 and 1911.

For most of the early-20th century, Coventry&#x27;s economy boomed; in the 1930s, a decade otherwise known for its economic slump, Coventry was noted for its affluence. In 1937 Coventry topped a national purchasing power index, designed to calculate the purchasing power of the public.

=== Great War (1914‚Äì1918) ===

Many Coventry factories switched production to military vehicles, armaments and ammunitions during the Great War. Approximately 35,000 men from Coventry and Warwickshire served during the First World War, so most of the skilled factory workers were women drafted from all over the country. Due to the importance of war production in Coventry it was a target for German zeppelin attacks and defensive anti-aircraft guns were established at Keresley and Wyken Grange to protect the city.

In June 1921, the War Memorial Park was opened on the former Styvechale Common to commemorate the 2587 soldiers from the city who lost their lives in the war. The War Memorial was designed by Thomas Francis Tickner and is a Grade II* building. It was unveiled by Earl Haig in 1927, with a room called the Chamber of Silence inside the monument holding the roll of honour. Soldiers who lost their lives in recent conflicts have been added to the roll of honour over the years.

===Urban expansion and development===
With many of the city&#x27;s older properties becoming increasingly unfit for habitation, the first council houses were let to their tenants in 1917. With Coventry&#x27;s industrial base continuing to soar after the end of the Great War in 1918, numerous private and council housing developments took place across the city in the 1920s and 1930s to provide housing for the large influx of workers who came to work in the city&#x27;s booming factories. The areas which were expanded or created in this development included Radford, Coundon, Canley, Cheylesmore and Stoke Heath. 

As the population grew, the city boundaries underwent several expansions, in 1890, 1928, 1931 and 1965, and between 1931 and 1940 the city grew by 36%.

The development of a southern by-pass around the city, starting in the 1930s and being completed in 1940, helped deliver more urban areas to the city on previously rural land. In the 1910s plans were created to redevelop Coventry&#x27;s narrow streets and by the 1930s the plans were put into action with Coventry&#x27;s medieval street of Butcher Row being demolished. even before the war, the plans had been put in place to destroy the medieval character of Coventry.

The London Road Cemetery was designed by Joseph Paxton on the site of a former quarry to meet the needs of the city.

===German bombing of Coventry===

Coventry suffered severe bomb damage during the Second World War. The most severe was a massive Luftwaffe air raid that the Germans called Operation Moonlight Sonata. The raid, which involved more than 500 aircraft, started at 7pm on 14 November 1940 and carried on for 11 hours into the morning of 15 November. The raid led to severe damage to large areas of the city centre and to Coventry&#x27;s historic cathedral, leaving only a shell and the spire. More than 4,000 houses were damaged or destroyed, along with around three quarters of the city&#x27;s industrial plants. Between 380 and 554 people were killed, with thousands injured and homeless.

Aside from London, Hull and Plymouth, Coventry suffered more damage than any other British city during the Luftwaffe attacks, with huge firestorms devastating most of the city centre. The city was probably targeted owing to its high concentration of armaments, munitions, aircraft and aero-engine plants which contributed greatly to the British war effort, although there have been claims that Hitler launched the attack as revenge for the bombing of Munich by the RAF six days before the Coventry Blitz and chose the Midlands city because its medieval heart was regarded as one of the finest in Britain. Following the raids, the majority of Coventry&#x27;s historic buildings were demolished by a council who saw no need of them in a modern city, although some of them could have been repaired and some of those demolished were unaffected by the bombing.

===Post-Second World War===
====Redevelopment====
In the post-war years Coventry was largely rebuilt under the general direction of the Gibson Plan, gaining a new pedestrianised shopping precinct (the first of its kind in Europe on such a scale) and in 1962 Sir Basil Spence&#x27;s much-celebrated new St Michael&#x27;s Cathedral (incorporating one of the world&#x27;s largest tapestries) was consecrated. Its prefabricated steel spire (fl√®che) was lowered into place by helicopter.

Further housing developments in the private and public sector took place after the Second World War, partly to accommodate the growing population of the city and also to replace condemned and bomb damaged properties. Several new suburbs were constructed in the post-war period, including Tile Hill, Wood End, and Stoke Aldermoor.

====Boom and bust====

Coventry&#x27;s motor industry boomed during the 1950s and 1960s and Coventry enjoyed a &#x27;golden age&#x27;. In 1960 over 81,000 people were employed in the production of motor vehicles, tractors and aircraft in Coventry. During this period the disposable income of Coventrians was amongst the highest in the country and both the sports and the arts benefited. A new sports centre, with one of the few Olympic standard swimming pools in the UK, was constructed and Coventry City Football Club reached the First Division of English Football. The Belgrade Theatre (named in recognition of a gift of timber from the Yugoslavian capital city) was also constructed along with the Herbert Art Gallery. Coventry&#x27;s pedestrianised Precinct shopping area came into its own and was considered one of the finest retail experiences outside London. In 1965 the new University of Warwick campus was opened to students, and rapidly became one of the country&#x27;s leading higher-education institutions.

Coventry&#x27;s large industrial base made it attractive to the wave of Asian and Caribbean immigrants who arrived from Commonwealth colonies after 1948. In 1950, one of Britain&#x27;s first mosques‚Äîand the very first in Coventry‚Äîwas opened on Eagle Street to serve the city&#x27;s growing Pakistani community.

The 1970s, however, saw a decline in the British motor industry and Coventry suffered particularly badly, especially towards the end of that decade. By the 1970s, most of Coventry&#x27;s motor companies had been absorbed and rationalised into larger companies, such as British Leyland and Chrysler which subsequently collapsed. The early 1980s recession dealt Coventry a particularly severe blow: By 1981, Coventry was in an economic crisis, with one in six of its residents unemployed. By 1982, the number of British Leyland employees in the city had fallen from 27,000 at its height, to just 8,000. Other Coventry industrial giants such as the tool manufacturer Alfred Herbert also collapsed during this time.

In the late-1970s and early-1980s, Coventry also became the centre of the Two-tone musical phenomena. The two-tone style was multi-racial, derived from the traditional Jamaican music genres of ska, reggae and rocksteady combined with elements of punk rock and new wave. Bands considered part of the genre include the Specials, the Selecter, Madness, the Beat, Bad Manners, the Bodysnatchers and Akrylykz. Most famously the Specials 1981 UK no.1 hit &#x27;Ghost Town&#x27; reflected the unemployment and desolation of Coventry at the time.

===21st century===
Some motor manufacturing continued into the early 21st century: The research and design headquarters of Jaguar Cars is in the city at their Whitley plant and although vehicle assembly ceased at the Browns Lane plant in 2004, Jaguar&#x27;s head office returned to the city in 2011, and is also sited in Whitley. Jaguar is owned by the Indian company, Tata Motors. The closure of the Peugeot factory at Ryton-on-Dunsmore in 2006, ended volume car manufacture in Coventry. By 2008, only one motor manufacturing plant was operational, that of LTI Ltd, producing the popular TX4 taxi cabs. On 17 March 2010 LTI announced they would no longer be producing bodies and chassis in Coventry, instead producing them in China and shipping them in for final assembly in Coventry.

Since the 1980s, Coventry has recovered, with its economy diversifying into services, with engineering ceasing to be a mass employer, what remains of manufacturing in the city is driven by smaller more specialist firms. By the 2010s the biggest drivers of Coventry&#x27;s economy had become its two large universities; the University of Warwick and Coventry University, which between them, had 60,000 students, and a combined annual budget of around ¬£1 billion.

In 2021 Coventry became the UK City of Culture. A range of artistic and local history events and projects took place over the next year, including &quot;Coventrypedia&quot; and the creation of the Coventry Atlas local history map.

== Geography ==
=== Climate ===
As with the rest of the British Isles and the Midlands, Coventry experiences a maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters. The nearest Met Office weather station is Coundon/Coventry Bablake. Temperature extremes recorded in Coventry range from in February 1947, to in July 2022. The lowest temperature reading of recent years was during December 2010.


===City boundaries===
Coventry forms the largest part of the Coventry and Bedworth Urban Area. The city proper covers an area of almost .

The protected West Midlands Green Belt, which surrounds the city on all sides, has prevented the expansion of the city into both the administrative county of Warwickshire and the metropolitan borough of Solihull (the Meriden Gap), and has helped to prevent the coalescence of the city with surrounding towns such as Kenilworth, Nuneaton, Leamington Spa, Warwick and Rugby as well as the large village of Balsall Common.

===Places of interest===
====Cathedral====
The spire of the ruined cathedral forms one of the &quot;three spires&quot; which have dominated the city skyline since the 14th¬†century, the others being those of Christ Church (of which only the spire survives) and Holy Trinity Church (which is still in use).

St Michael&#x27;s Cathedral is Coventry&#x27;s best-known landmark and visitor attraction. The 14th¬†century church was largely destroyed by German bombing during the Second World War, leaving only the outer walls and spire. At high, the spire of St Michael&#x27;s is claimed to be the third tallest cathedral spire in England, after Salisbury and Norwich. Due to the architectural design (in 1940 the tower had no internal wooden floors and a stone vault below the belfry) it survived the destruction of the rest of the cathedral. 

The new Coventry Cathedral was opened in 1962 next to the ruins of the old. It was designed by Sir Basil Spence. The cathedral contains the tapestry &quot;Christ in Glory in the Tetramorph&quot; by Graham Sutherland. The bronze statue &quot;St Michael&#x27;s Victory over the Devil&quot; by Jacob Epstein is mounted on the exterior of the new cathedral near the entrance. Benjamin Britten&#x27;s &quot;War Requiem&quot;, regarded by some as his masterpiece, was written for the opening of the new cathedral. The cathedral was featured in the 2009 film &quot;Nativity!&quot;.

Coventry Cathedral is also notable for being one of the newest cathedrals in the world, having been built following the Second World War bombing of the ancient cathedral by the Luftwaffe. Coventry has since developed an international reputation as one of Europe&#x27;s major cities of peace and reconciliation, centred on its cathedral, and holds an annual Peace Month. John Lennon and Yoko Ono planted two acorns outside the cathedral in June 1968 to thank the city for making friends with others.

Coventry also has a Baptist church named Queens Road Baptist Church, which was first established in 1723 and moved to its current building in 1884.

====Cultural institutions====

The Herbert Art Gallery and Museum is one of the largest cultural institutions in Coventry. Another visitor attraction in the city centre is Coventry Transport Museum, which has the largest public collection of British-made road vehicles in the world. The most notable exhibits are the world speed record-breaking cars, Thrust2 and ThrustSSC The museum received a refurbishment in 2004 which included the creation of a new entrance as part of the city&#x27;s Phoenix Initiative project. It was a finalist for the 2005 Gulbenkian Prize. 

Historic Coventry Trust (previously known as The Charterhouse Coventry Preservation Trust) was founded in 2011. The Trust is a social enterprise aiming to regenerate Coventry&#x27;s historic buildings and landscapes. Their sites across Coventry include the Charterhouse, the two surviving City Gates, Drapers&#x27; Hall, London Road Cemetery: Paxton&#x27;s Arboretum and Priory Row.

The ¬£5 million Fargo Village creative quarter shopping precinct was open in 2014 on Far Gosford Street with a mixture of retail units.

About from the city centre and just outside Coventry in Baginton is the Lunt Fort, a reconstructed Roman fort on its original site. The Midland Air Museum is situated just within the perimeter of Coventry on land adjacent to Coventry Airport and near Baginton.

Coventry was one of the main centres of watchmaking during the 18th and 19th¬†centuries and as the industry declined, the skilled workers were key to setting up the cycle trade. A group of local enthusiasts founded the Coventry Watch Museum in Spon Street.

The city&#x27;s main police station in Little Park Street also hosts a museum of Coventry&#x27;s police force. The museum, based underground, is split into two sections‚Äîone representing the history of the city&#x27;s police force, and the other compiling some of the more unusual, interesting and grisly cases from the force&#x27;s history. The museum is funded from charity donations‚Äîviewings can be made by appointment.

Coventry City Farm was a small farm in an urban setting. It was mainly to educate city children who might not get out to the countryside very often. The farm closed in 2008 due to funding problems.

==Demography==


Coventry has an ethnic minority population which represented 34.5% of the population at the 2021 census. The ethnic minority population is concentrated in the Foleshill and the St Michael&#x27;s wards. Islam is the largest non-Christian religion, but the composition of the ethnic minority population is not typical of the UK with significant numbers of other South Asians. Both Sikh and Hindu religions are represented significantly higher than in the rest of the West Midlands in general.

Coventry has a large student population (approximately 15,000 are non-UK) who are in the UK for 12 months or longer that are included in these figures.



According to the 2021 Census, 43.9% (151,577) of residents identified themselves as Christian making Christianity the largest followed religion in the city. Islam was the second most followed religion with 10.4% (35,800) of residents identifying with the religion. 5.0% (17,297) of Coventry&#x27;s population were Sikh, disproportionately larger than the national average in England of 0.8%. Hindus made up 4.0% (13,724) of the resident population followed by Buddhists at 0.4% (1,257) and Jews at 0.1% (259) respectively. The adherents of other religions made up 0.6% (1,908) of the city&#x27;s population.

Almost a third of Coventry residents, 29.6% (102,338), identified themselves as having no religion and 6.1% did not declare any religion.

== Government and politics ==
===Local and national government===

Traditionally a part of Warwickshire (although it was a county in its own right for 400 years), Coventry became an independent county borough in 1889. It later became a metropolitan district of the West Midlands county under the Local Government Act 1974 (c. 7), even though it was entirely separate to the Birmingham conurbation area (this is why Coventry appears to unnaturally &quot;jut out&quot; into Warwickshire on political maps of the UK). In 1986, the West Midlands County Council was abolished and Coventry became administered as an effective unitary authority in its own right.

Coventry is administered by Coventry City Council, controlled since 2010 by the Labour Party, and led since May 2016 by George Duggins. The city is divided up into 18 Wards each with three councillors. The chairman of the council is the Lord Mayor, who has a casting vote.

Certain local services are provided by West Midlands wide agencies including the West Midlands Police, the West Midlands Fire Service and Transport for West Midlands (Centro) which is responsible for public transport.

In 2006, Coventry and Warwickshire Ambulance Service was merged with the West Midlands Ambulance Service. The Warwickshire and Northamptonshire Air Ambulance service is based at Coventry Airport in Baginton.

Coventry is represented in Parliament by three Members of Parliament (MPs). They are:
* Mary Creagh ‚Äì (Coventry East)
* Zarah Sultana ‚Äì (Coventry South)
* Taiwo Owatemi ‚Äì (Coventry North West)

Up until 1997, Coventry was represented by four Members of Parliament, whereupon the Coventry South West and Coventry South East constituencies were merged to form Coventry South.

On Tuesday, 10 September 2024, Zarah Sultana, the Member of Parliament for Coventry South, was suspended from the Labour Party for voting in favour of a Scottish National Party amendment to end the two child benefit cap.

On Thursday, 19 May 2016, Councillor Lindsley Harvard was inaugurated Lord Mayor of Coventry for 2016‚Äì17 as Coventry&#x27;s 65th Lord Mayor. Councillor Lindsley Harvard has been a Labour Councillor serving on the council for fourteen years, for Earlsdon Ward (1996‚Äì2000) and for Longford Ward since 2006. On Thursday, 19 May 2016, Councillor Tony Skipper was inaugurated as the Deputy Lord Mayor of Coventry for 2016‚Äì17. He has been a Labour councillor since 1995; representing Earlsdon Ward between 1995 and 2001, and then Radford Ward since 2001.

The Bishop of Coventry is Christopher John Cocksworth, who was consecrated on 3 July 2008.

===Council affiliation===
In May 2016, it was as follows
===Twinning with other cities; &quot;city of peace and reconciliation&quot;===
Coventry and Stalingrad (now Volgograd) were the world&#x27;s first &#x27;twin&#x27; cities when they established a twinning relationship during the Second World War. The relationship developed through ordinary people in Coventry who wanted to show their support for the Soviet Red Army during the Battle of Stalingrad. The city was also subsequently twinned with Dresden, as a gesture of peace and reconciliation following the Second World War. Each twin city country is represented in a specific ward of the city and in each ward has a peace garden dedicated to that twin city. Coventry is now twinned with 26 places across the world: On 22 March 2022, Coventry City Council voted unanimously to suspend the twinning arrangement with Volgograd in light of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

==Arts and culture==
On 7 December 2017 it was announced that the city would be the 2021 UK City of Culture, being the third such place to hold the title after Derry in 2013 and Hull in 2017. After the financial collapse of the Coventry City of Culture Trust, set up to run legacy projects following Coventry&#x27;s year as UK City of Culture in 2021, local MP Taiwo Owatemi raised an adjournment debate in the House of Commons.

===Literature and drama===
* The African American actor Ira Aldridge managed Coventry Theatre after impressing the people of the city with his acting during a tour in 1828. He was born in New York in 1807, but moved to England when he was18, and is considered the UK&#x27;s first black Shakespearean performer. 
* The poet Philip Larkin was born and brought up in Coventry, where his father was the City Treasurer.
* During the early 19th¬†century, Coventry was well known due to author George Eliot who was born near Nuneaton, Warwickshire. The city was the model for her famous novel &quot;Middlemarch&quot; (1871).
* The Coventry Carol is named after the city of Coventry. It was a carol performed in the play &quot;The Pageant of the Shearman and Tailors&quot;, written in the 15th¬†century as one of the Coventry Cycle Mystery Plays. These plays depicted the nativity story, the lyrics of the Coventry Carol referring to the Annunciation to the Massacre of the Innocents, which was the basis of the Pageant of the Shearmen and Tailors. These plays were traditionally performed on the steps of the (old) cathedral. The Belgrade Theatre brought back the Coventry Mystery Plays in 2000 to mark the city&#x27;s millennium celebrations: the theatre now produces the Mystery Plays every three years.
* The Belgrade Theatre was Britain&#x27;s first purpose-built civic theatre, opened in 1958. In 1965 the world&#x27;s first &quot;Theatre-in-Education&quot; (TiE) company was formed to develop theatre as a way of inspiring learning in schools. The TiE movement spread worldwide, the theatre still offers a number of programmes for young people across Coventry and has been widely recognised as a leader in the field.

It emerged as the winner in a competition organised by BBC Coventry &amp; Warwickshire and proudly flew during Coventry&#x27;s tenure as the UK City of Culture in 2021. The design features Lady Godiva, a local heroine, depicted in black on a white pale, symbolising Coventry&#x27;s history, principles, and its reputation as a city of peace.

==Sport==
On the sporting scene, Coventry Rugby Football Club was consistently among the nation&#x27;s leading rugby football sides from the early 20th¬†century, peaking in the 1970s and 1980s. Association football, on the other hand, was scarcely a claim to fame until 1967, when Coventry City F.C. finally won promotion to the top flight of English football as champions of the Football League Second Division. They would stay among the elite for the next 34 years, reaching their pinnacle with FA Cup glory in 1987‚Äîthe first and to date only major trophy in the club&#x27;s history. Their long stay in the top flight of English football ended in relegation in 2001, and in 2012 they were relegated again to the third tier of English football. Highfield Road, to the east of the city centre, was Coventry City&#x27;s home for 106 years from 1899. They finally departed from the stadium in 2005 on their relocation to the 32,600-seat Ricoh Arena some to the north of the city centre, in the Rowleys Green district. Since 2000, the city has also been home to one of the most successful ice hockey teams in the country, the Coventry Blaze who are four time Elite League champions, and play their home games at the SkyDome Arena.

===Football===

There are two professional football teams representing the city: Coventry City F.C. of the EFL Championship in men&#x27;s football and Coventry United L.F.C. of the FA Women&#x27;s Championship in women&#x27;s football.

Coventry City F.C., formed in 1883 as &quot;Singers F.C.&quot;. Nicknamed the &quot;Sky Blues&quot;, the club competes in the EFL Championship (second tier of English football), but spent 34 years from 1967 to 2001 in the top tier of English football, winning the FA Cup in 1987. They were founder members of the Premier League in 1992. In 2005, Coventry City moved to the 32,600 capacity Ricoh Arena which opened in the Rowleys Green district of the city. The 2013‚Äì14 season saw the football club begin a ground share with Northampton Town F.C. at Sixfields Stadium, Northampton, which lasted until their return to the Ricoh Arena in September 2014. The 2019‚Äì20 season saw the Sky Blues once again playing their home fixtures out of Coventry, at Birmingham City&#x27;s St Andrew&#x27;s Stadium. This arrangement continued until August 2021, when Coventry moved back to the newly renamed Coventry Building Society Arena.

Coventry United L.F.C. play at the Butts Park Arena and were originally Coventry City Ladies before the Sky Blues discontinued their women&#x27;s team, at which point they affiliated with Coventry United, and rose through the divisions to their current position in the second-tier of the women&#x27;s game.

Aside from these clubs, there are several other clubs in the city playing non-league football. Coventry Sphinx, Coventry Alvis, Coventry Copsewood and Coventry United all play in the Midland Football League.

===Rugby Union===
At the beginning of the 2014‚Äì15 season, there were 14 clubs based in Coventry, playing at various levels of the English rugby union system. However, on 21 December 2014, this rose to 15, when Aviva Premiership club Wasps RFC played their first home game at the Ricoh Arena, completing their relocation to the city. This followed Wasps&#x27; purchase of Arena Coventry Limited (the company which runs the Ricoh Arena). The club announced that they will build a new &#x27;state of the art&#x27; training complex in the area by 2016.

Wasps&#x27; stay in the City ended in 2022 after the club collapsed into administration and were forced to relinquish their ownership of the arena. As it stands, Wasps currently have no plans to play in Coventry again.

Coventry Rugby Football Club play in the RFU Championship, the second tier of the English rugby union system. The club enjoyed national success during the 1950s, the 1960s and 1970s, with many of its players playing for their countries, notable players include Ivor Preece, Peter Jackson, David Duckham, Fran Cotton and Danny Grewcock. From 1921 to 2004, the club played at Coundon Road Stadium. Their current home ground is the Butts Park Arena, which was opened in 2004.

===Speedway===
Coventry Speedway was based at Brandon Stadium (also known as Coventry Stadium). The stadium is located just outside the city in the village of Brandon, Warwickshire ( to the east of the city). The stadium operated both sides of the Second World War. Before the Second World War speedway also operated for a short time at Foleshill Stadium, off Lythalls Lane in the city. Between 1998 and 2000, Coventry Stadium hosted the Speedway Grand Prix of Great Britain.

The Coventry Bees started in 1948 and operated continuously until the end of the 2018 season. They started out in the National League Division Three before moving up to the Second Division and, later to the top flight. The Bees were crowned League Champions on nine occasions (1953, 1968, 1978, 1979, 1987, 1988, 2005, 2007 and 2010).

Amongst the top speedway riders who represented Coventry teams were Tom Farndon, Jack Parker, Arthur Forrest, Nigel Boocock, Kelvin Tatum, Chris Harris, Scott Nicholls, Emil Sayfutdinov and World Champions Ole Olsen, Hans Nielsen, Greg Hancock, Billy Hamill, Ronnie Moore and Jack Young.

In 2007, the Bees won the domestic speedway treble of Elite League, Knock-out Cup and Craven Shield, while Chris Harris won both the Speedway Grand Prix of Great Britain and the British Championship. The Bees retained the Craven Shield in 2008, and Chris Harris added further British Championship victories in both 2009 and 2010. The Elite League Championship Trophy returned to Brandon in 2010 when the Bees convincingly beat Poole Pirates in the play-off finals.

The Coventry Storm, an offshoot of the senior team, competed in the National League.

In 2017, the stadium became unavailable for motorsports, with new owners Brandon Estates pursuing planning permission for housing ‚Äì thus, neither Coventry team was able to compete in the leagues, although a number of challenge matches were undertaken on opposition teams&#x27; tracks.

For 2018, Coventry Bees were entered into the National League, the third tier of British Speedway, riding their home meetings at the home of Leicester Lions. The team has not operated since then.

==Economy==
Historically, Coventry was the most important seat of ribbon-making in the UK. In this industry it competed locally with Norwich and Leicester and internationally with Saint-√âtienne in France.

Coventry has been a centre of motor and cycle manufacturing. Starting with Coventry Motette, The Great Horseless Carriage Company, Swift Motor Company, Humber, Hillman, Riley, Francis-Barnett and Daimler and the Triumph motorcycle having its origins in 1902 in a Coventry factory. The Massey Ferguson tractor factory was situated on Banner Lane, Tile Hill, until it closed in the late 1990s.

Although the motor industry has declined almost to the point of extinction, the Jaguar
company has retained its corporate headquarters in the city (at Whitley) and an Advanced R&amp;D team at the University of Warwick, while Peugeot still have a large parts centre in Humber Road despite the closure of its Ryton factory (formerly owned by the Rootes Group) just outside the city in December 2006 with the loss of more than 2,000 jobs ‚Äì denting the economy of Coventry shortly before the onset of a recession which sparked further economic decline and high unemployment.

The Standard Motor Company opened a car factory at Canley in the south of the city in 1918, occupying a former munitions factory. This site was later expanded and produced Triumph cars after the Standard brand was phased out by BMC during the 1960s. In August 1980, however, it was closed down as part of British Leyland&#x27;s rationalisation process, although the Triumph brand survived for another four years on cars produced at other British Leyland factories. The closure of the Triumph car factory was perhaps the largest blow to Coventry&#x27;s economy during the early 1980s economic decline.

The famous London black cab taxis are produced by Coventry-based LEVC (formerly LTI); until its 2017 relocation from the historic Holyhead Road factory to a new plant at Ansty Park a few miles outside the city, these were the only remaining motor vehicles wholly built in Coventry.

The manufacture of machine tools was once a major industry in Coventry. Alfred Herbert Ltd became one of the largest machine tool companies in the world. In later years the company faced competition from foreign machine tool builders and ceased trading in 1983. Other Coventry machine tool manufacturers included A.C. Wickman, and Webster &amp; Bennett. The last Coventry machine tool manufacturer was Matrix Churchill which was forced to close in the wake of the Iraqi Supergun (Project Babylon) scandal.

Coventry&#x27;s main industries include: cars, electronic equipment, machine tools, agricultural machinery, man-made fibres, aerospace components and telecommunications equipment. In recent years, the city has moved away from manufacturing industries towards business services, finance, research, design and development and creative industries.

===Redevelopment===

Major improvements continue to regenerate the city centre. The Phoenix Initiative, which was designed by MJP Architects, reached the final shortlist for the 2004 RIBA Stirling Prize and has now won a total of 16 separate awards. It was published in the book &#x27;Phoenix : Architecture/Art/Regeneration&#x27; in 2004. Further major developments are potentially afoot, particularly the Swanswell Project, which is intended to deepen Swanswell Pool and link it to Coventry Canal Basin, coupled with the creation of an urban marina and a wide Parisian-style boulevard. A possible second phase of the Phoenix Initiative is also in the offing, although both of these plans are still on the drawing-board. On 16 December 2007, IKEA&#x27;s first city centre store in the UK was opened, in Coventry.

On 4 February 2020, it was announced that IKEA&#x27;s Coventry city centre store was to close the same year due to changing shopping habits and consistent losses at the store.

The River Sherbourne runs under Coventry&#x27;s city centre; the river was paved over during the rebuilding after the Second World War and is not commonly known. When the new rebuild of Coventry city centre takes place from 2017 onwards, it is planned that river will be re-opened, and a river walk way will be placed alongside it in parts of the city centre. In April 2012, the pedestrianisation of Broadgate was completed.

=== Electricity ===
Electricity was first supplied to Coventry in 1895 from Coventry power station off Sandy Lane adjacent to the canal (now Electric Wharf). A larger 130¬†MW power station was built at Longford in 1928, this operated until 1976, and was subsequently demolished.

===Waste management===
Coventry has an energy from waste incinerator which burns rubbish from both Coventry and Solihull, producing electricity for the National Grid and some hot water that is used locally through the Heatline project. Rubbish is still put into landfill.

* Many areas of Coventry have kerb-side plastic, metal (tins and cans), and paper recycling. Garden-green rubbish is collected and composted.
* Waste materials can be taken to the recycling depot, which is adjacent to the incineration unit.
* There are recycling points throughout the city for paper, glass recycling and metal / tin can recycling.

In October 2006, Coventry City Council signed the Nottingham Declaration, joining 130 other UK councils in committing to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of the council and to help the local community do the same.

==Transport==
===Roads===
Coventry is near to the M1, M6, M40, M45 and M69 motorways. The M45, which is situated a few miles to the south-east of the city, was opened in 1959 as a spur to the original section of the M1 motorway, which linked London with the Midlands. This was, in effect, the first motorway to serve Coventry, as the section of the M6 north of the city did not open until 1971 and the M69 between Coventry and Leicester opened five years later. The M40, which is connected to the city via the A46, is south of the city centre, south of Warwick and gives the city&#x27;s residents an alternative dual carriageway and motorway route to London.

It is served by the A45 and A46 dual carriageways. The A45 originally passed through the centre of the city, but was re-routed in the 1930s on the completion of the Coventry Southern Bypass, with westbound traffic heading in the direction of Birmingham and eastbound traffic in the direction of Northampton. The A46 was re-routed to the east of the city in 1989 on completion of the Coventry Eastern Bypass, which directly leads to the M6/M69 interchange. To the south, it gives a direct link to the M40, making use of the existing Warwick and Kenilworth bypasses.

Coventry has a dual-carriageway Ring Road (officially road number A4053) that is 2.25 miles long. It loops around the city centre and roughly follows the lines of the old city walls. The Ring Road began construction in the late 1950s, the first stretch was opened in 1962, and it was finally completed in 1974. Ring Road junctions have all been numbered since the 1980s. The road has a reputation for being difficult to navigate. A single street of Victorian terraces, Starley Road, remains inside the ring road after a campaign by residents prevented its demolition in the 1980s.

Phoenix Way, a dual-carriageway running north‚Äìsouth completed in 1995, links the city centre with the M6 motorway.

===Railway===
Coventry railway station is a principal stop on the West Coast Main Line; it is served by three train operating companies:

* Avanti West Coast operates inter-city services between , , , , , and 
* CrossCountry provides services between and , via Birmingham New Street, and 
* London Northwestern (a trade name of West Midlands Trains) provides stopping services between London Euston and Birmingham New Street, via Rugeley. There are also services between Nuneaton and Leamington Spa.

Coventry has also three suburban railway stations at Coventry Arena, Canley and Tile Hill. Coventry Arena, serving the north of city on the Coventry to Nuneaton Line, opened in January 2016 primarily for the Ricoh Arena where football, rugby matches and concerts take place.

===Light rail===
A light rail system is planned for Coventry, known as &quot;Coventry Very Light Rail&quot;. The first vehicle came off the production line in March 2021 and the first line, to University Hospital Coventry, was proposed to be operational by 2024.

===Buses===
Bus operators in Coventry include National Express Coventry, Arriva Midlands and Stagecoach in Warwickshire. Pool Meadow bus station is the main bus and coach interchange in the city centre. Coventry has a single Park and Ride service from War Memorial Park served by Stagecoach in Warwickshire. From Pool Meadow, there are national coach links to major towns and cities, seaside towns, ferry ports and events with National Express, with four stands (A, B, C and D). 

Coventry aims to have all of its buses powered by electricity by 2025.

===Air===
The nearest major airport is Birmingham Airport, some to the west of the city. Coventry Airport, located south of the city centre in Baginton, is now used for general aviation only.

Coventry in a linguistic sense looks both ways, towards both the &#x27;West&#x27; and &#x27;East&#x27; Midlands. One thousand years ago, the extreme west of Warwickshire (what today we would designate Birmingham and the Black Country) was separated from Coventry and east Warwickshire by the forest of Arden, with resulting inferior means of communication. The west Warwickshire settlements too were smaller in comparison to Coventry which, by the 14th¬†century, was England&#x27;s third city. Even as far back as Anglo-Saxon times Coventry‚Äîsituated as it was, close to Watling Street‚Äîwas a trading and market post between King Alfred&#x27;s Saxon Mercia and Danelaw England with a consequent merging of dialects.

=== Coventry and Birmingham accents ===
Phonetically the accent of Coventry, like the perhaps better known accent of Birmingham, is similar to Northern English with respect to its system of short vowels. For example, it lacks the BATH/TRAP (Cov. /baŒ∏/, Southern /b…ëÀêŒ∏/) and FOOT/STRUT (Cov. /str ät/, Southern /str åt/) splits. Yet the longer vowels in the accent also contain traces of Estuary English such as a partial implementation of the London diphthong shift, increasingly so amongst the young since 1950. We also see other Estuary English features, such as a /l/-vocalisation whereby words such as &#x27;milk&#x27; come to be pronounced as /m…™ äk/. However, the distinction between Coventry and Birmingham accents is often overlooked. Certain features of the Birmingham accent (e.g. occasional tapping of prevocalic /r/ in words such as &#x27;crack&#x27;) stop starkly as one moves beyond Solihull in the general direction of Coventry, a possible approximation of the &#x27;Arden Forest&#x27; divide perhaps. In any case, Coventry sits right at a dialectal crossroads, very close to isoglosses that generally delineate &#x27;Northern&#x27; and &#x27;Southern&#x27; dialects, exhibiting features from both sides of the divide.

=== Coventry accent on television ===
The BBC&#x27;s 2009 documentary &quot;The Bombing of Coventry&quot; contained interviews with Coventrians. Actress Becci Gemmell, played Coventry character Joyce in the BBC drama &quot;Land Girls&quot;.

==Honours==
A minor planet, 3009 Coventry, discovered by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh in 1973, is named after the city.

==Education==
===Universities and further education colleges===
Coventry has two universities; Coventry University is situated on a modern city centre campus while the University of Warwick lies to the south of the city centre. The University of Warwick is one of only five universities never to have been rated outside the top ten in terms of teaching excellence and research and is a member of the prestigious Russell Group. The university won the BBC TV &quot;University Challenge&quot; trophy in April 2007 and April 2021. Coventry University is one of only a handful of universities to run a degree course in automotive design, which is in its Coventry School of Art and Design.

Coventry also has two further education colleges within city boundaries, Coventry College and Hereward College.

===Schools===
Many of the secondary schools in and around Coventry are specialist colleges, such as Finham Park School, which is a mathematics and IT college, a teacher training school and the only school in Coventry to offer studying the International Baccalaureate, and Coventry Blue Coat Church of England School which has recently become a specialist college of music, one of only a few in the country. Cardinal Wiseman Catholic School specialises in languages. Bishop Ullathorne RC School became a specialist college in humanities in 2006. Ernesford Grange Community Academy, in the south east, is a specialist science college. Coundon Court School is a Technology College. Pattison College, a private school opened in 1949, specialises in the performing arts. Caludon Castle School is a business and enterprise school, which was rebuilt over 2005‚Äì07. Exhall Grange School and Science College is in the north of the city, although, its catchment area is north Warwickshire. There is also Cardinal Newman Catholic School and Community College and Whitley Academy in the city.

Coventry has a variety of schools: Two of the oldest secondary schools being President Kennedy School founded in 1966 and located in the north-west of Coventry (currently undergoing rebuilding work) and Sidney Stringer Academy which is located in the centre of the city. It is a co-educational school and has moved into a larger building costing ¬£28 million.

The Coventry School Foundation comprises the independent schools King Henry VIII School and Bablake School together with King Henry VIII Preparatory School.

The Woodlands Academy and Tile Hill Wood School were the last remaining single sex schools in the city, serving boys and girls respectively. These schools merged onto the Tile Hill Wood site in 2016 before officially being rebranded as West Coventry Academy in 2017. Both Woodlands and Tile Hill shared a joint sixth form along with The Westwood Academy called West Coventry Sixth Form, but in 2018 Westwood left the sixth form and it now operates under the name West Coventry Academy Sixth Form.

The Westwood Academy, which is a Technology College, is close to the University of Warwick. It is the only school in Coventry that is a CISCO Academy and has links with other educational establishments, industry and the local community.

Sherbourne Fields School is a school for young people with disabilities and is located in the Coundon area. It opened in the 1960s.

==Notable people associated with Coventry==
===History and politics===
Coventry is well known for the mythical 11th century exploits of Lady Godiva who, according to legend, rode through the city naked on horseback in protest at high taxes being levied on the city folk by her husband Leofric, Earl of Mercia. Contemporary historians do not dispute that lady Godiva was a real figure, as she was the first woman to be mentioned in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; (1086), however her ride is considered mythical. The residents of the city were commanded to look away as she rode, but one man did not and was allegedly struck blind. He became known as Peeping Tom thus originating a new idiom, or metonym, in English. There is a Grade II* listed statue of her in the city centre, which for 18 years had been underneath a Cathedral Lanes shopping centre canopy, removed in October 2008. There is also a bust of Peeping Tom looking out across Hertford Street shopping precinct, and overlooking Broadgate and the statue of Godiva is a clock where, at every hour, Lady Godiva appears on her horse while being watched by Peeping Tom.

Though there is little information about it, there are evidences that territory of Alcamo was inhabited even in prehistoric times; in one of the most ancient sites, near &quot;contrada&quot; Molinello (a country district), they discovered archaeological findings dating back to the Mesolithic, approximately 9,000‚Äì6,000 BC and other very old ones dating back to the Neolithic during the archaeological excavations done by the archaeologist Paolo Orsi (1899) and the marquis Antonio De Gregorio (1917) near the river Fiume Freddo. One of the most important finds is an axe from the Neolithic, kept at the Museo archeologico regionale Paolo Orsi of Syracuse.

=== Longuro and Longarico ===
From the quotations by Lycophron we know that in old times there was an inhabited centre called &quot;Longuro&quot; on Mount Bonifato. According to an old story, this settlement was founded by a Greek colony which had escaped from the destruction of the town of Troy.

During the Roman period the inhabitants of Longuro moved to the foot of the mountain so they could practice agriculture in the surrounding lands. The town was called Longaricum; this name appears in the &quot;Itinerario di Antonino Pio&quot; (=Itinerary of Antoninus Pius, in the 3rd century AD) and would coincide with the Latin name of Longuro.

According to a supposition the two hillocks appearing on the gonfalon of Alcamo would represent both the towns of Longaricum and Longuro.

=== Origins ===

The first document mentioning Alcamo is dating back to 1154, in a paper written by the Berber geographer Idrisi who was given this task by Roger II of Sicily in order to get a collection of geographic maps. From a distance longer than a mile, the writer describes the position of Alcamo viewed from the Castle of Calatubo (visible even today from the town territory) and defines it as a hamlet or a group of houses with rich soil and a flourishing market.

=== Medieval age ===
Alcamo was divided into four hamlets named San Vito, San Leonardo, Sant&#x27;Ippolito and San Nicol√≤ del Vauso. but a series of revolts between 1221 and 1243 led King Frederick II to move most of the population to a colony at Lucera, while Christians from Bonifato came to inhabit the town. In this period the poet Ciullo or Cielo d&#x27;Alcamo was born.

In 1340 Raimondo Peralta acquired the feud and barony of Alcamo from Peter II of Aragon. Then the barony passed to his son Guglielmo Peralta Sclafani, called &quot;Guglielmone&quot;. and afterwards to the Ventimiglia family (up to 1397), Giaimo de Prades (1407), the Cabrera family, the Speciale family, Pietro Balsamo prince of Roccafiorita (1618) and finally to Giuseppe Alvarez (1777).

In the 14th century Alcamo had several thousands of inhabitants and hundreds of them had immigrated from different parts of Sicily and Italy (in particular: Pisa, Amalfi, Bologna, Calabria, Liguria), and some also from Spain. During this period, Antonello da Messina moved to Alcamo for three years (around 1438‚Äì1441) in order to learn the tanning techniques from the tanner master Guglielmo Adragna di Alcamo, in fact the town was an important pole of development for commerce and handicraft. In particular, it had a massive exchange of wheat and wine with the nearby towns and there were also expert artisans such as bakers, blacksmiths, tanners and weavers. During this century Alcamo was an important centre for wheat storage and sorting. In the same period the writer Giacomo Adragna transcribed the &quot;Commentarii in Persium&quot; and Pietro d&#x27;Alcamo many works from the library of San Martino.

=== Modern age ===
At about the year 1500, Alcamo was under the jurisdiction of the captain of justice Ferdinando Vega, who fought against the raiding Turkish pirates. The town was surrounded by defensive embattled walls provided with four gates:
* &quot;Porta Palermo&quot; (afterwards called &quot;Porta Saccari&quot;), at the end of the present via Rossotti;
* &quot;Porta Corleone&quot;, at the end of the present via Commendatore Navarra;
* &quot;Porta di Ges√π&quot;, opposite the church of Saint Mary of Jesus, next to the Franciscan friary;
* &quot;Porta Trapani&quot; (later called &quot;Porta del Collegio&quot;), at the beginning of via Commendatore Navarra.

During this period, the town was divided into four-quarters, each one associated with the name of the main church in that area:
* San Giacomo de la Spada
* San Calogero
* San Francesco d&#x27;Assisi (or &quot;Terra nuova&quot;)
* Maggiore Chiesa.
The division between these quarters was coincident with the main streets of the town, that are the present Corso 6 Aprile and Via Rossotti and its continuation via dei Baroni Emanuele di San Giuseppe (called incorrectly &quot;Via Barone di San Giuseppe&quot;).

In 1535, in coincidence with the visit of the emperor Charles V, coming back from Tunisia, the old Porta Trapani was closed and four gates were opened:
* new &quot;Porta Trapani&quot;, near the beginning of the present Corso 6 Aprile (that was called &quot;Corso Imperiale&quot;);
* new &quot;Porta Palermo&quot; (initially called &quot;Porta San Francesco&quot;), at the end of today&#x27;s Corso 6 Aprile;
* &quot;Porta Stella&quot;, at the corner between Via Stella and Piazza Ciullo; this name derives from the name of the &quot;Church of Our Lady of the Star (in Italian &quot;Madonna della Stella&quot;), near there;
* &quot;Porta Nuova&quot;, between the present &quot;Discesa al Santuario&quot; and &quot;Piazza della Libert√†&quot;.
During the 16th century there was a development in education in Alcamo because of the construction of new schools and the activity of expert teachers, in particular the poet and scholar Sebastiano Bagolino (1562‚Äì1604). In 1547 the Madonna appeared to some women of the people and an image of Madonna &quot;Fons Misericordiae&quot; was discovered and worshipped as &quot;Our Lady of Miracles&quot;.

In the late 16th century, the population was decimated by an infectious disease. and the victims were buried in the cemetery of Saint Ippolito.

In 1667 Mariano Ballo ordered the construction of a theatre, called &quot;teatro Ferrigno&quot;, later demolished and rebuilt during the 1960s; after the reconstruction it was first called &quot;cine-teatro Euro&quot; and later &quot;Teatro Cielo d&#x27;Alcamo&quot;.
During the 18th century, pestilence and popular rebellions occurred in Alcamo again. On the other hand, this age was important for art because of the construction of the Basilica of Our Lady of the Assumption (1699), designed by the architects Angelo Italia and Giuseppe Diamante. Its interior was also decorated with 38 frescoes made by the Flemish painter Guglielmo Borremans between 1736 and 1737. In the same period the Church of Saint Olivia was renovated, Saint Paul and Bartholomew&#x27;s Church was rebuilt (1689), and the Church of the Holy Crucifix (or saint Francis of Paola) was completed (1699) together with the monumental church of College some decades later(1767).

Between 1752 and 1780, Ignazio De Blasi, an Alcamese nobleman, wrote the first book on Alcamo&#x27;s history, entitled: &quot;Discorso storico della opulenta citt√† di Alcamo situata a pi√® del Monte Bonifato, e dell&#x27;antichissima citt√† di Longarico ossia Lacarico, dopo detta Alcamo, su di esso monte&quot;.

The population of the town, gradually recovered from the pestilence and increased to 13,000 in 1798.

=== Contemporary age ===

At the beginning of the 19th century Alcamo&#x27;s feudal status was abolished (1812) and the town became a direct royal possession.

The archpriests Stefano Triolo Galifi and Giuseppe Virgilio, together with the baron Felice Pastore were members of the Sicilian Parliament as representatives of Alcamo. In 1820, during a revolt, there were different murders, sacks, release of criminals from prison and a fire in the municipal archives. and in 1829 many people died of cholera. 
In 1843 the construction of the present Town Hall started, on a land of the baron Felice Pastore.

On 6 April 1860, Stefano and Giuseppe Triolo let the Italian Tricolour wave on the town hall, creating groups of volunteers in order to help Giuseppe Garibaldi in the battle of Calatafimi and from Alcamo some dictatorial edicts on Victor Emmanuel II&#x27;s behalf were issued. Some time later Francesco Crispi prepared the Constitution for the lands set free. Further to this event, Corso Imperiale was named Corso 6 Aprile, in memory of 6 April, in which the volunteers started to be enlisted in Alcamo.

During the Unification of Italy the brothers Triolo of Sant&#x27;Anna and Giuseppe Coppola of Monte San Giuliano enlisted many citizens to fight with the &quot;Garibaldians&quot; in 1860.
At the end of the 19th century, in 1897, public lighting was inaugurated in Alcamo during the traditional feast of Our Lady of Miracles. Among the most important people of this period we have to remind Don Giuseppe Rizzo, a priest who founded the bank called &quot;Cassa Rurale e Artigiana Don Rizzo&quot; (1902).

At the beginning of the 20th century (1901‚Äì1911) the number of citizens in Alcamo diminished abruptly, partially because of the emigration of 36,718 Sicilians abroad and in particular to the United States, but it is possible that the statistics about this year and the previous years were not reliable because the census was carried out without following certain criteria. In the same period the cultivations in the territory of Alcamo were affected by phylloxera and two banks (&quot;Cooperativa&quot; and &quot;Segestana&quot;) went bankrupt with subsequent economic difficulties for its citizens.

There were also some events linked to the Mafia, such as the murder of Gaspare Cottone, a carter (1899) and the death of the 19-years-old Benedetto Guastella during a fire conflict with carabinieri in 1900.
As the Mafia had taken power in the districts of Trapani and Alcamo, the commissary Cesare Mori intervened with a series of arrests and charges against the material executors of the crimes occurred in the area and finally they arrested Vincenzo and Michele Tedesco, brothers, and Baldassare Adragna, considered the heads of the gangs in Trapani&#x27;s territory.
During the First World War, four hundred citizens from Alcamo died and the following period was characterized by poverty because of monetary inflation and banditry. In 1918 about five hundred people died because of Spanish flu and in the Second World War 213 citizens from Alcamo died or were lost. In 1927, Don Vincenzo Giovenco (1880‚Äì1954) operated and opened the first cinema in Alcamo, &#x27;Cinema Marconi&#x27;. It subsequently closed less than ten years after opening, due to a fire 
The foundation of &quot;Societ√† Elettrotecnica Palermitana&quot;, whose name was changed into &quot;Societ√† Generale Electrica della Sicilia&quot; (SGES) and which installed an important electric workroom in the district of Saint Augustine in Alcamo, dates back to the twenties. The jobs inside this firm were very longed-for because it was the only firm in Trapani Province which had a Health insurance fund and granted holidays. The electric workroom existed until 1963, when it was acquired by Enel and demolished. During the years in which SGES operated, there was an improvement of the electric services in Alcamo&#x27;s territory, owing also to the realization of several artificial lakes.

During Fascism, the citizens asked the government to appoint Alcamo as the capital of the province (1930), but this request was not satisfied. 

On 19 August 1937 the fascist leader Benito Mussolini visited the town, crossing Corso 6 Aprile by an open car and parading through the crowd of his supporters. The visit was due to the inauguration of the railway line between Trapani and Alcamo, completed in the same year. Some weeks later, prince Umberto visited Alcamo too.

On 21 July 1943 the American troops entered Alcamo without any opposition, freeing the town from Italian Fascism.
On 18 December 1944, because of the economic and social discomfort, the citizens raised up, occupied the Town Hall and put its archives on fire.
Since 1960 the town planning system has been greatly expanding, particularly at the foot of Mount Bonifato with the construction of &quot;Viale Europa&quot;, which is one of the most important street in Alcamo.

At about the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s there was a bloody Mafia war between the clan Greco (related to the Rimi family) and the members of the emergent Mafia of Corleone, led by the boss Vincenzo Milazzo in the territory of Alcamo. Vincenzo Milazzo received orders from Tot√≤ Riina to eliminate members of the old Mafia (in particular the member of the clan Greco) and put in command only his trusted men. 
Just for this reason the Greco family represented an obstacle: the cause which roused the conflict was the approaching of some members of Cosa Nostra to the rival clan of Grecos. The war bathed the town in blood for about five years and provoked tens of victims. The new Corleone&#x27;s Mafia prevailed, but the cost to be paid was very high, because a lot of members of this clan died.
During the same period, in which there were armed clashes between the Mafia families, at contrada Virgini in Alcamo, they discovered the biggest heroin refinery in Sicily. (1985) Tens of people died in five years, and at the end the Mafia of Corleone prevailed.
While the crimes of the Mafia went on and tens of people disappeared as victims of &quot;lupara bianca&quot;, there was a religious revival which led to the birth of several Catholic associations such as &quot;Rinnovamento nello Spirito Santo&quot;, Neocatechumenal Way and the movement of Comunione e Liberazione. From the last one the parish community of the Church of Jesus Christ the Redeemer originated in the district of Sant&#x27;Anna (2006). This religious revival was followed by a new interest into the town&#x27;s old traditions, mentioned in the works of Roberto Calia and Carlo Cataldo, historians from Alcamo. Carlo Cataldo has also been prized several times both for his historical works and for his dialectal poems which tell Alcamo&#x27;s folklore.

In the 21st century there was a renovation of Alcamo&#x27;s architectural context, thanks to the restoration of some important historical buildings such as the Castle of the Counts of Modica, the Theatre Cielo d&#x27;Alcamo, the Cine-Theatre Marconi, the Ex Jesuits&#x27; College, the Cuba delle rose (in 2013), the church of College (in 2014), the fa√ßade of Badia Nuova (in 2014) and the old Arab fountain (in 2016). Thanks also to the intervention of Fondo Ambiente Italiano, it is expected the restoration of the Castle of Calatubo; its chapel and the path leading to the castle have already been cleaned by the volunteers&#x27; association &quot;Salviamo il Castello di Calatubo&quot; (in 2015).

Among the works of revaluation of the urban areas there are the restoration of Piazza Ciullo by the architect Gae Aulenti (1996) and the realization of an underground car park in Piazza Bagolino, together with the creation of the near suburban park San Francesco.
The interest in environment is also associated with that in the territory, in fact, after the adhesion to the initiative &quot;Rifiuti Zero&quot; (Zero Rubbish), Alcamo has been considered an example to be followed for the results got between 2010 and 2013 in the field of waste sorting (raccolta differenziata).

== Coat of arms ==
The Coat of arms of Alcamo used since the kingdom of Frederick II of Swabia is a black flying Eagle, crowned by Gold in a Silver range, with three hills below and two Golden Oaks.

A sculpture of the coat of arms is put on a side wall of the Church of Saint Francis of Assisi, near Porta Palermo.

=== Military buildings ===
Military buildings in Alcamo include:

* The Castle of the Counts of Modica (or &quot;Castle of Alcamo&quot;): probably built in the 14th or 15th century by the Peralta family and then completed by the feudatories Enrico and Federico Chiaromonte. In 1535 the emperor Charles V lodged there. It was a possession of the Cabreras and then of the Counts of Modica, until 1812. Later, during the Reign of Italy and until 1960, it was used as a prison. It has a rhomboidal shape, with four towers: two quadrangular at the corners and the other two are connected by curtains and are cylindrical. In each tower there were a torture room for prisoners, rooms for sentinels and for passing guest sovereigns. One of the particular characteristics of the castle is given by the thick walls which bound it and that in old times defended it from the enemies&#x27; attacks extremely well.
* Castle of Ventimiglia: situated on the top of Mount Bonifato. It is a medieval castle and today there are only some parts of the walls, the primary tower and the dungeons. It took the name from Enrico Ventimiglia, who declared he had built it just for defence, though according to some interpretations, it would date back to a previous period.
* The Calatubo Castle, outside the town but inside its territory and on the road leading to Palermo, is a fortress built in the early Middle Ages. The homonymous village of Calatubo stood nearby and its commerce was based on the exportation of cereals and millstones. In the same place there is an old necropolis dating back to the 6th century BC.

<doc id="44768" wikidata="Q583" url="?curid=44768" title="Mont Blanc">
<text>Mont Blanc (, ) is the highest mountain in the Alps, Western Europe, and the highest point of the European Union; and the highest mountain in Europe outside the Caucasus Mountains, rising above sea level, located on the Franco-Italian border. It is the second-most prominent mountain in Europe, after Mount Elbrus, and the 11th most prominent mountain in the world.

It gives its name to the Mont Blanc massif, which straddles parts of France, Italy and Switzerland. Mont Blanc&#x27;s summit lies on the watershed line between the valleys of Ferret and Veny in Italy, and the valleys of Montjoie, and Arve in France. Ownership of the summit area has long been disputed between France and Italy.

The Mont Blanc massif is popular for outdoor activities like hiking, climbing, trail running and winter sports like skiing, and snowboarding. The most popular climbing route to the summit of Mont Blanc is the Go√ªter Route, which typically takes two days.

The three towns and their communes which surround Mont Blanc are Courmayeur in Aosta Valley, Italy; and Saint-Gervais-les-Bains and Chamonix in Haute-Savoie, France. The latter town was the site of the first Winter Olympics. A cable car ascends and crosses the mountain range from Courmayeur to Chamonix through the Col du G√©ant. The Mont Blanc Tunnel, constructed between 1957 and 1965, runs beneath the mountain and is a major transalpine transport route.

== Geology ==
Mont Blanc and adjacent mountains in the massif are predominately formed from a large intrusion of granite (termed a batholith) which was forced up through a basement layer of gneiss and mica schists during the Variscan mountain-forming event of the late Palaeozoic period. The summit of Mont Blanc is located at the point of contact of these two rock types. To the southwest, the granite contact is of a more intrusive nature, whereas to the northeast it changes to being more tectonic. The granites are mostly very-coarse grained, ranging in type from microgranites to porphyroid granites. The massif is tilted in a north-westerly direction and was cut by near-vertical recurrent faults lying in a north‚Äìsouth direction during the Variscan orogeny. Further faulting with shear zones subsequently occurred during the later Alpine orogeny. Repeated tectonic phases have caused breakup of the rock in multiple directions and in overlapping planes. Finally, past and current glaciation caused significant sculpting of the landscape into its present-day form.

The first systematic account of the minerals of the Mont Blanc area was published in 1873 by Venance Payot. His list, entitled &quot;Statistique min√©ralogique des environs du Mt-Blanc&quot;, catalogued 90 mineral types although it also included those present only as very small components of rocks. If these are excluded, it is known today that at least 68 separate mineral species occur across the wider range of the Mont Blanc massif.

==Climate==

Located on the watershed between the Rh√¥ne and the Po, the massif of Mont Blanc is also situated between the two different climatic regions of the northern and western Alps and that of the southern Alps. Climatic conditions on the Mer de Glace are similar to those found on the northern side of the Swiss Alps.

The climate is cold and temperate (K√∂ppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;), and is greatly influenced by altitude. Being the highest part of the Alps, Mont Blanc and surrounding mountains can create their own weather patterns. Temperatures drop as the mountains gain in height, and the summit of Mont Blanc is a permanent ice cap, with temperatures around . The summit is also prone to strong winds and sudden weather changes. Because of its great overall height, a considerable proportion is permanently glaciated or snow-covered and is exposed to extremely cold conditions.

There is, however, significant variation in precipitation with altitude. For example, the village of Chamonix below Mont Blanc is at an elevation of approximately . It receives around of annual precipitation, whilst the Col du Midi, which is at above sea level, receives significantly more, totalling . However, at an even higher altitude (near the summit of Mont Blanc), precipitation is considerably less, with only around recorded, despite the latter measurements being taken at the height of .

== History ==

The Mont Blanc was the highest mountain of the Frankish Empire under Charlemagne and the highest mountain of the Holy Roman Empire until 1792.

In 1760, Swiss naturalist Horace-B√©n√©dict de Saussure began to go to Chamonix to observe Mont Blanc. He tried to summit it with the Courmayeur mountain guide Jean-Laurent Jordaney, a native of Pr√©-Saint-Didier, who accompanied De Saussure since 1774 on the Miage Glacier and Mont Crammont.

The first recorded ascent of Mont Blanc (at the time neither within Italy nor France) was on 8 August 1786 by Jacques Balmat and the doctor Michel Paccard. This climb, initiated by Horace-B√©n√©dict de Saussure, who rewarded the successful ascent, traditionally marks the start of modern mountaineering. The first woman to reach the summit was Marie Paradis in 1808.
=== Ownership of the summit ===
At the scale of the Mont Blanc massif, the border between Italy and France passes along most of the main Alpine watershed, from the Aiguille des Glaciers to Mont Dolent, where it reaches the border with Switzerland. However, its precise location near the summits of Mont Blanc and nearby D√¥me du Go√ªter is disputed. Italian officials claim the border follows the watershed, splitting both summits between Italy and France. In contrast, French officials claim the border avoids the two summits, placing them entirely with France. The size of these two (distinct) disputed areas is approximately on Mont Blanc and on D√¥me du Go√ªter.

In 1723, the Duke of Savoy, Victor Amadeus II, acquired the Kingdom of Sardinia. The resulting state of Sardinia was to become preeminent in the Italian unification.

Citing the Treaty of Paris (1796), France claims that the historical border of Savoy and Piedmont diverged from the watershed line, fully encompassing the summit of Mont Blanc within Savoy and consequently, within French territory.

After the Napoleonic Wars, the Congress of Vienna restored the King of Sardinia in Savoy, Nice, and Piedmont, his traditional territories, overruling the 1796 Treaty of Paris. Forty-five years later, after the Second Italian War of Independence, it was replaced by a new legal act. This act was signed in Turin on 24 March 1860 by Napoleon III and Victor Emmanuel II of Savoy, and deals with the annexation of Savoy (following the French neutrality for the plebiscites held in Tuscany, Modena, Parma and Romagna to join the Kingdom of Sardinia, against the Pope&#x27;s will). A demarcation agreement, signed on 7 March 1861, defined the new border. With the formation of Italy, for the first time, Mont Blanc was located on the border of France and Italy, along the old border between the department of Savoy and that of Piedmont, formerly belonging to the Savoyard state.

The 1860 act is still legally valid for both the French and Italian governments. Italy claims, that the border was moved by France in 1865, when surveys carried out by a cartographer of the French army, Captain JJ Mieulet, incorporated the summit into French territory, making the state border deviate from the watershed line, and giving rise to the differences with the maps published in Italy in the same period.

Modern Swiss mapping, published by the Federal Office of Topography, plots a region of disputed territory (statut de territoire contest√©) around the summits of both Mont Blanc and the D√¥me du Go√ªter. One of its interpretations of the French-Italian border places both summits straddling a line running directly along the geographic ridgeline (watershed) between France and Italy, thus sharing their summits equally between both states. However, a second interpretation places both summits, as well as that of Mont Blanc de Courmayeur (although much less clearly in the latter case), solely within France.

NATO maps take data from the Italian national mapping agency, the Istituto Geografico Militare, which is based upon past treaties in force.

=== Vallot ===
=== Janssen observatory ===
In 1890, Pierre Janssen, an astronomer and the director of the Meudon astrophysical observatory, considered the construction of an observatory at the summit of Mont Blanc. Gustave Eiffel agreed to take on the project, provided he could build on a rock foundation if found at a depth of less than below the ice. In 1891, the Swiss surveyor Imfeld dug two horizontal tunnels below the ice summit but found nothing solid. Consequently, the Eiffel project was abandoned.

Despite this, the observatory was built in 1893. During the cold wave of January 1893, a temperature of was recorded on Mont Blanc, being the lowest ever recorded there.

Levers attached to the ice supported the observatory. This worked to some extent until 1906, when the building started leaning heavily. The movement of the levers corrected the lean slightly, but three years later (two years after Janssen&#x27;s death), a crevasse started opening under the observatory. It was abandoned. Eventually the building fell, and only the tower could be saved .

=== Air crashes ===
The mountain was the scene of two fatal air crashes; Air India Flight 245 in 1950 and Air India Flight 101 in 1966. Both planes were approaching Geneva Airport and the pilots miscalculated their descent; 48 and 117 people, respectively, died. The passengers on flight 101 included nuclear scientist Homi J. Bhabha, known as the &quot;father&quot; of India&#x27;s nuclear programme.

=== Tunnel ===
In 1946, a drilling project was initiated to carve a tunnel through the mountain. The Mont Blanc tunnel would connect Chamonix, France, and Courmayeur, Italy, and become one of the major transalpine transport routes between the two countries. In 1965, the tunnel opened to vehicle traffic with a length of .

==== 1999 disaster ====
In 1999, a transport truck caught fire in the tunnel beneath the mountain. In total, 39 people were killed when the fire raged out of control. The tunnel was renovated in the aftermath to increase driver safety. Renovations include computerised detection equipment, extra security bays, a parallel escape shaft, and a fire station in the middle of the tunnel. The escape shafts also have clean air flowing through them via vents. Any people in the security bays now have live video contact to communicate with the control centre. A remote site for cargo safety inspection was created on each side: Aosta in Italy and Passy-Le Fayet in France. Here all trucks are inspected before entering the tunnel. These remote sites are also used as staging areas to control commercial traffic during peak hours. The renovated tunnel reopened three years after the disaster.

== Elevation ==

The summit of Mont Blanc is a thick, perennial ice-and-snow dome whose thickness varies. Therefore, no exact and permanent summit elevation can be determined, though accurate measurements have been made on specific dates.
Its official elevation was for a long time. In 2002, the IGN and expert surveyors, with the aid of GPS technology, measured it to be .

After the 2003 heatwave in Europe, a team of scientists remeasured the height on 6 and 7 September. The team was made up of the glaciologist Luc Moreau, two surveyors from the GPS Company, three people from the IGN, seven expert surveyors, four mountain guides from Chamonix and Saint-Gervais and four students from various institutes in France. This team noted that the elevation was , and the peak had shifted to a point away from where it had been in 2002.

After these results were published, more than 500 points were measured to assess the effects of climate change and the mountain&#x27;s height fluctuations at different points. Since then, the mountain&#x27;s elevation has been measured every two years.

The summit was measured again in 2005, and the results were published on 16 December 2005. The height was found to be , more than the previously recorded height. The rock summit was found to be at , some west of the ice-covered summit.

In 2007, the summit was measured at and in 2009 at .
In 2013, the summit was measured at and in 2015 at .
From the summit of Mont Blanc on a clear day, the Jura, the Vosges, the Black Forest, and the Massif Central mountain ranges can be seen, as well as the principal summits of the Alps.


== Climbing routes ==

Several classic climbing routes lead to the summit of Mont Blanc:

*The most popular route is the Go√ªter Route, also known as the &quot;Voie Des Cristalliers&quot; or the &quot;Voie Royale&quot;. Starting from Saint-Gervais-les-Bains, the Tramway du Mont-Blanc (TMB) is taken to get to the Gare du Nid d&#x27;Aigle. The ascent begins in the direction of the Refuge de T√™te Rousse, crossing the &quot;Grand Couloir&quot; or &quot;Go√ªter Corridor&quot;, considered dangerous because of frequent rockfalls, leading to the Go√ªter Hut for night shelter. The next day the route leads to the D√¥me du Go√ªter, past the emergency Vallot cabin and l&#x27;Ar√™te des Bosses.
*&quot;La Voie des 3 Monts&quot; is also known as &quot;La Travers√©e&quot;. Starting from Chamonix, the T√©l√©ph√©rique de l&#x27;Aiguille du Midi is taken towards the Col du Midi. The Cosmiques Hut is used to spend the night. The next day the ascent continues over Mont Blanc du Tacul and Mont Maudit.
*The historic itinerary via the Grands Mulets Hut, or the old normal route on the French side, which is most frequently traversed in winter by ski, or in summer to descend to Chamonix.
*The normal Italian itinerary is called &quot;La route des Aiguilles Grises&quot;. After crossing the Miage Glacier, climbers spend the night at the Gonella refuge. The next day, one proceeds through the Col des Aiguilles Grises and the D√¥me du Go√ªter, concluding at L&#x27;ar√™te des Bosses (Bosses ridge).
*The Miage ‚Äì Bionnassay ‚Äì Mont Blanc crossing is usually done in three days. It has been described as &quot;a truly magical expedition of ice and snow ar√™tes at great altitude&quot;. The route begins from Contamines-Montjoie, with the night spent in the Conscrits Hut. The following day, the D√¥mes de Miages is crossed and the night is spent at the Durier cabin. The third day proceeds over l&#x27;Aiguille de Bionnassay and the D√¥me du Go√ªter, finally reaching the summit of Mont Blanc via the Bosses ridge.

Nowadays, the summit is ascended by an average of 20,000 mountaineer tourists each year. It could be considered a technically easy yet arduous ascent for someone well-trained and acclimatised to the altitude. From l&#x27;Aiguille du Midi (where the cable car stops), Mont Blanc seems quite close, being higher. But while the peak looks deceptively close, the La Voie des 3 Monts route (known to be more technical and challenging than other more commonly used routes) requires more ascent over two other mountains, Mont Blanc du Tacul and Mont Maudit, before the final section of the climb is reached. The last push to the summit is undertaken.

Each year climbing deaths occur on Mont Blanc. On the busiest weekends, normally around August, the local rescue service performs an average of 12 missions, mostly directed to aid people in trouble on one of the normal routes of the mountain. Some routes require knowledge of high-altitude mountaineering and a guide (or at least an experienced mountaineer), and all require proper equipment. All routes are long and arduous, involving delicate passages and the hazard of rockfall or avalanche. Climbers may also suffer altitude sickness, occasionally life-threatening, particularly if they are not properly acclimatised.

=== Fatalities ===
A 1994 estimate suggests there had been 6,000 to 8,000 alpinist fatalities in total, more than on any other mountain. These numbers exclude the fatalities of Air India Flight 245 and Air India Flight 101, two planes that crashed into Mont Blanc. Despite unsubstantiated claims recurring in media that &quot;some estimates put the fatality rate at an average of 100 hikers a year&quot;, actual reported annual numbers at least since the 1990s are between 10 and 20: in 2017, fourteen people died out of 20,000 summit attempts, and two remained missing; with 15 in 2018 as of August.

A French study on the especially risky &quot;Go√ªter couloir, on the normal route on Mont Blanc&quot; and necessary rescue operations found that, between 1990 and 2011, there were 74 deaths &quot;between the T√™te Rousse refuge (3,187 m) and the Go√ªter refuge (3,830 m)&quot;. There were 17 more in 2012‚Äì15, none in 2016, and 11 in 2017.

== Refuges ==
*Refuge Vallot, 4362 m
*Bivouac Giuseppe Lampugnani, 3860 m
*Bivouac Marco Crippa, 3840 m
*Refuge Go√ªter, 3817 m
*Bivouac Corrado Alberico ‚Äì Luigi Borgna, 3684 m
*Refuge Cosmiques, 3613 m
*Refuge T√™te Rousse, 3167 m
*Refuge Francesco Gonella, 3071 m
*Refuge Grands Mulets, 3050 m

=== Impacts of climate change ===
The recent temperature rises and heatwaves, such as those of the summers of 2015 and 2018, have significantly impacted many climbing routes across the Alps, including those on Mont Blanc. For example, in 2015, the Grand Mulets route, previously popular in the 20th century, was blocked by virtually impenetrable crevasse fields, and the Gouter Hut was closed by municipal decree for some days because of a very high rockfall danger, with some stranded climbers evacuated by helicopter.

In 2016 a crevasse opened at high altitude, also indicating previously unobserved glacial movements. The new crevasse forms an obstacle to be scaled by climbing parties on the final part of the itinerary to the top shared by the popular Go√ªter Route and the Grand Mulets Route.

== Protection ==
The Mont Blanc massif is being put forward as a potential World Heritage Site because of its uniqueness and cultural importance considered the birthplace and symbol of modern mountaineering. It would require the three governments of Italy, France and Switzerland to request UNESCO for it to be listed.

Mont Blanc is one of the most visited tourist destinations in the world. For this reason, some view it as threatened. Pro-Mont Blanc (an international collective of associations for the protection of Mont Blanc) published in 2002 the book &quot;Le versant noir du mont Blanc&quot; (The black hillside of Mont Blanc), which exposes current and future problems in conserving the site.

In 2007, Europe&#x27;s two highest toilets (at 4,260 metres, 13,976 feet) were taken by helicopter to the top of Mont Blanc. They are also serviced by helicopter. They will serve 30,000 skiers and hikers annually, helping to alleviate the discharge of urine and faeces that spreads down the mountain face with the spring thaw.

Global warming has begun to melt glaciers and cause avalanches on Mont Blanc, creating more dangerous climbing conditions.

<text>Carpigiani is an Italian company, located near Bologna, specialising in the production of gelato and ice cream machines. It has approximately 35% of the global market share, which includes both machines for the production of Italian artisan gelato and those for the production of soft serve gelato and ice cream.

== History ==
Brothers Bruto and Poerio Carlo Carpigiani created the &quot;Gastecnica S.a.s dei fratelli Carpigiani&quot; in 1944. Carpigiani produced and patented a gelato machine, named &quot;Autogelatiera&quot;. The Carpigiani soft serve ice cream machines make a fluffy, whippy ice cream due to their clever whipping action, mixing air and ice cream mix, during the ice cream making process.

The technological growth in the 1960s brought Carpigiani to become the worldwide leader in ice cream machinery, with the invention of the &quot;hard-o-matic&quot;.

In 1964 an American secondary company was founded with the name Coldelite U.S.A. and in 1971 Carpigiani bought Cattabriga (concurrent firm). In 1989 the Comenda Ali S.p.A. group bought the Carpigiani Bruto S.p.A., now become Carpigiani Group - Ali Group S.r.l.
In 1993 Carpagiani was certified UNI EN ISO 9001:1987. It was the first company in the business to receive this certification.

The company has branches in France, Germany, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, United States, Japan, China, Singapore, Russia and two in South America. Production plants are located in Bologna, including the headquarters in Anzola dell&#x27;Emilia, in Forl√¨, in Gandia and in Zhongshan. In the 1990s, the Swiss Ott-Freezer, the Promag of Milan, the Spanish Sencotel and the Italian GBG were acquired.

In 2003 the Carpigiani Gelato University was founded, a professional training school on the production of artisan gelato. By 2021 the school, which has established itself as the largest and most prestigious gelato school in the world, has 20 campuses around the globe in addition to the headquarters in Anzola, where lessons are held in Italian, English and French.

On 27 September 2012, the Carpigiani Gelato Museum was inaugurated, the first and only museum in the world entirely dedicated to gelato.

<text>Segesta (, &quot;Egesta&quot;, or , &quot;S√©gesta&quot;, or , &quot;A√≠gesta&quot;; ) was one of the major cities of the Elymians, one of the three indigenous peoples of Sicily. The other major cities of the Elymians were Eryx and Entella. It is located in the northwestern part of Sicily in Italy, near the modern commune of Calatafimi-Segesta in the province of Trapani. The hellenization of Segesta happened very early and had a profound effect on its people.

==History==
===Origins===
The origin and foundation of Segesta are extremely obscure. The tradition current among the Greeks and adopted by Thucydides, ascribed its foundation to a band of Trojan settlers, fugitives from the destruction of their city; and this tradition was readily welcomed by the Romans, who in consequence claimed a kindred origin with the Segestans. Thucydides seems to have considered the Elymians (), a barbarian tribe in the neighborhood of Eryx and Segesta, as descended from the Trojans in question; but another account represents the Elymi as a distinct people, already existing in this part of Sicily when the Trojans arrived there and founded the two cities. A different story seems also to have been current, according to which Segesta owed its origin to a band of Phocians, who had been among the followers of Philoctetes; and, as usual, later writers sought to reconcile the two accounts.

Another version of the Trojan story related in Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, which would seem to have been adopted by the inhabitants themselves, ascribed the foundation of the city jointly by the territorial king Egestus or Aegestus (the Acestes of Virgil), who was said to be the offspring of a Dardanian damsel named Segesta by the river god Crinisus, and by those of Aeneas&#x27; folk who wished to remain behind with Acestes to found the city of Acesta. We are told also that the names of Simois and Scamander were given by the Trojan colonists to two small streams which flowed beneath the town, and the latter name is mentioned by Diodorus Siculus as one still in use at a much later period.

The belief that the name of the city was originally Acesta or Egesta and changed to Segesta by the Romans to avoid its ill-omened meaning in Latin ( means &quot;poverty&quot; or &quot;lack&quot;) is disproved by coins which prove that considerably before the time of Thucydides it was called by the inhabitants themselves Segesta, though this form seems to have been softened by the Greeks of Magna Graecia into Egesta.

The city was occupied by a people distinct from the Sicanians, the native race of this part of Sicily, and on the other that it was not a Greek colony. Thucydides, in enumerating the allies of the Athenians at the time of the Peloponnesian War, distinctly calls the Segestans barbarians. At the same time they appear to have been, from a very early period, in close connection with the Greek cities of Sicily, and entering into relations both of hostility and alliance with the Hellenic states, wholly different from the other barbarians in the island. The early influence of Greek civilisation is shown also by their coins, which are inscribed with Greek characters, and bear the unquestionable impress of Greek art.

===In historical accounts===
The first historical notice of the Segestans transmitted to us represents them as already engaged (as early as 580 BC) in hostilities with Selinus (modern Selinunte), which would appear to prove that both cities had already extended their territories so far as to come into contact with each other. By the timely assistance of a body of Cnidian and Rhodian emigrants under Pentathlus, the Segestans at this time obtained the advantage over their adversaries. A more obscure statement of Diodorus relates that again in 454 BC, the Segestans were engaged in hostilities with the Lilybaeans for the possession of the territory on the river Mazarus. The name of the Lilybaeans is here certainly erroneous, as no town of that name existed till long afterwards; but we know not what people is really meant, though the presumption is that it is the Selinuntines, with whom the Segestans seem to have been engaged in almost perpetual disputes. It was doubtless with a view to strengthen themselves against these neighbors that the Segestans took advantage of the first Athenian expedition to Sicily under Laches (426 BC), and concluded a treaty of alliance with Athens. This, however, seems to have led to no result, and shortly after, hostilities having again broken out, the Selinuntines called in the aid of the Syracusans, with whose assistance they obtained great advantages, and were able to press Segesta closely both by land and sea. In this extremity the Segestans, having in vain applied for assistance to Agrigentum, and even to Carthage, again had recourse to the Athenians, who were, without much difficulty, persuaded to espouse their cause, and send a fleet to Sicily in 416 BC. It is said that this result was in part attained by fraud, the Segestans having deceived the Athenian envoys by a fallacious display of wealth, and led them to conceive a greatly exaggerated notion of their resources. They, however, actually furnished 60 talents in ready money, and 30 more after the arrival of the Athenian armament.

But though the relief of Segesta was thus the original object of the great Athenian expedition to Sicily (415‚Äì413¬†BC), that city bears little part in the subsequent operations of the war. Nicias, indeed, on arriving in the island, proposed to proceed at once to Selinus, and compel that people to submission by the display of their formidable armament. But this advice was overruled: the Athenians turned their arms against Syracuse, and the contest between Segesta and Selinus was almost forgotten in the more important struggle between those two great powers. In the summer of 415¬†BC an Athenian fleet, proceeding along the coast, took the small town of Hyccara, on the coast, near Segesta, and made it over to the Segestans. The latter people are again mentioned on more than one occasion as sending auxiliary troops to assist their Athenian allies; but no other notice occurs of them.

The final defeat of the Athenians left the Segestans again exposed to the attacks of their neighbors, the Selinuntines. Feeling themselves unable to cope with them, they again had recourse to the Carthaginians, who determined to espouse their cause, and sent them, in the first instance, an auxiliary force of 5000 Africans and 800 Campanian mercenaries, which sufficed to ensure them a victory over their rivals in 410 BC. This was followed the next year by a vast armament under Hannibal Mago, who landed at Lilybaeum, and, proceeding direct to Selinus, took and destroyed that city as well as Himera. The Carthaginian power now became firmly established in the western portion of Sicily. Segesta, surrounded on all sides by this formidable neighbor, naturally fell gradually into the position of a dependent ally of Carthage. It was one of the few cities that remained faithful to this alliance even in 397 BC, when the great expedition of Dionysius I of Syracuse to the West of Sicily and the siege of Motya seemed altogether to shake the power of Carthage. Dionysius in consequence laid siege to Segesta, and pressed it with the utmost vigor, especially after the fall of Motya. The city, however, was able to defy his efforts, until the landing of Himilco with a formidable Carthaginian force changed the aspect of affairs, and compelled Dionysius to raise the siege.

From this time there are few mentions of Segesta till the time of Agathocles of Syracuse, under whom it suffered a great calamity. The despot landed in the West of Sicily on his return from Africa (307 BC), and was received into the city as a friend and ally. He suddenly turned upon the inhabitants on a pretence of disaffection, and put the whole of the citizens (said to amount to 10,000 in number) to the sword, plundered their wealth, and sold the women and children into slavery. He then changed the name of the city to Dicaeopolis, and assigned it as a residence to the fugitives and deserters that had gathered around him.

It is probable that Segesta never altogether recovered this blow; but it soon resumed its original name, and again appears in history as an independent city. Thus it is mentioned in 276 BC, as one of the cities which joined Pyrrhus of Epirus during his expedition into the West of Sicily. It, however, soon after fell again under the power of the Carthaginians; and it was probably on this occasion that the city was taken and plundered by them, as alluded to by Cicero; a circumstance of which there are no other account. It continued subject to, or at least dependent on that people, till the First Punic War. In the first year of that war (264 BC) it was attacked by the consul Appius Claudius Caudex, but without success; but shortly after the inhabitants put the Carthaginian garrison to the sword, and declared for the alliance of Rome. They were in consequence besieged by a Carthaginian force, and were at one time reduced to great straits, but were relieved by the arrival of Gaius Duilius, after his naval victory in 260 BC. Segesta seems to have been one of the first of the Sicilian cities to set the example of defection from Carthage; on which account, as well as of their pretended Trojan descent, the inhabitants were treated with great distinction by the Romans. They were exempted from all public burdens, and even as late as the time of Cicero continued to be &quot;sine foedere immunes ac liberi&quot; ‚Äì a free and immune city. After the destruction of Carthage, Scipio Africanus restored to the Segestans a statue of Diana which had been carried off by the Carthaginians, probably when they obtained possession of the city after the departure of Pyrrhus.

During the Second Servile War also, in 102 BC, the territory of Segesta is again mentioned as one of those where the insurrection broke out with the greatest fury. But with the exception of these incidental notices we hear little of it under the Roman government. It seems to have been still a considerable town in the time of Cicero, and had a port or emporium of its own on the bay about 10¬†km distant. This emporium seems to have grown up in the days of Strabo to be a more important place than Segesta itself: but the continued existence of the ancient city is attested both by Pliny and Ptolemy; and we learn from the former that the inhabitants, though they no longer retained their position of nominal independence, enjoyed the privileges of the Latin citizenship. It seems, however, to have been a decaying place, and no trace of it is subsequently found in history. The site is said to have been finally abandoned, in consequence of the ravages of the Saracens, in 900 AD, and is now wholly desolate. The modern town of Castellammare del Golfo, about 10¬†km distant, occupies nearly, if not precisely, the same site as the ancient emporium or port of Segesta.

==Situation==

The ruins of the city are located on the top of Monte B√†rbaro at 305¬†m above sea level. The city was protected by steep slopes on several sides and by walls on the more gentle slope towards the temple.

The hilltop offers a view over the valley towards the Gulf of Castellamare. The city controlled several major roads between the coast to the north and the hinterland. Very little is known about the city plan. Aerial photography indicates a regular city plan, built in part on terraces to overcome the natural sloping terrain. The current remains might be from the reconstruction after the destruction of the city by Agathocles.

Current archaeological work indicates that the site was reoccupied by a Muslim community in the Norman period. Excavations have unearthed a Muslim necropolis and a mosque from the 12th century next to a Norman castle. Evidence suggests that the mosque was destroyed after the arrival of a new Christian overlord at the beginning of the 13th century. The city appears to have been finally abandoned by the second half of the 13th century.

==The temple==

On a hill just outside the site of the ancient city of Segesta lies an unusually well-preserved Doric temple. Some think it to have been built in the 420s BC by an Athenian architect, despite the city not having any Greek population. The prevailing view is that it was built by the indigenous Elymians. The temple has six by fourteen columns on a base measuring 21 by 56¬†metres, on a platform three steps high. Several elements suggest that the temple was never finished. The columns have not been fluted as they normally would have been in a Doric temple, and there are still bosses present in the blocks of the base (used for lifting the blocks into place but then normally removed). The temple also lacks a cella, any ornamentation, altar or deity dedication, and was never roofed over. The temple was never completed due to the war between Segesta and Selinunte. It managed to escape destruction by the Carthaginians in the late 5th century BC.

<text>The Hollywood Revue of 1929, or simply The Hollywood Revue, is a 1929 American pre-Code musical comedy film released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. It was the studio&#x27;s second feature-length musical, and one of their earliest sound films. Produced by Harry Rapf and Irving Thalberg and directed by Charles Reisner, it features nearly all of MGM&#x27;s stars in a two-hour revue that includes three segments in Technicolor. The masters of ceremonies are Conrad Nagel and Jack Benny.

At the 2nd Academy Awards, the film received a Best Picture nomination (its sole nomination) but lost to another Irving Thalberg MGM production, &quot;The Broadway Melody&quot;.

As a film published in 1929, it entered the public domain on January 1, 2025.

== Production ==

Unlike M-G-M&#x27;s imposing feature films, which always boasted strong story values, &quot;The Hollywood Revue of 1929&quot; was a plotless parade of variety acts. Conrad Nagel, interviewed for the book &quot;The Real Tinsel&quot;, recalled, &quot;Everybody thought Harry Rapf was crazy for making it.&quot; Billed as an &quot;All-Star Musical Extravaganza&quot;, the film includes performances by once and future stars, including Joan Crawford singing and dancing on stage. (She later remarked, &quot;&quot;Revue&quot; was one of those let&#x27;s-throw-everyone-on-the-lot-into-a musical things, but I did a good song-and-dance number.&quot;). Other segments feature Gus Edwards, John Gilbert, Norma Shearer, Lionel Barrymore, Buster Keaton, Marie Dressler, Bessie Love, Marion Davies, Anita Page, and the comedy team of Karl Dane and George K. Arthur.

Highlights of the film are a comedy routine starring Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy as inept magicians, and a variety of musical performances. One of these is the debut of &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;, performed initially by Cliff Edwards as &quot;Ukulele Ike,&#x27;&quot; and later performed at the end of the film by the entire cast. This latter all-star color sequence was a last-minute addition to the film, shot late at night on June 10, 1929, just ten days before the premiere at Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre. The only major M-G-M stars missing from the revue are Greta Garbo, Ramon Novarro, and Lon Chaney, although Chaney is referred to by name in one of the songs performed and Garbo is spoken of during one of the introductory dialogues. Only one sequence was cut from the film: three songs by The Brox Sisters, which was recycled into a short subject, &quot;Gems of MGM&quot;. Another sequence, a parody of the Albertina Rasch ballet&#x27;s &quot;pearl dance&quot; by Marie Dressler, was planned but not shot (as the film&#x27;s production records reveal). Instead, the number was replaced by one featuring Buster Keaton, though Dressler did pose for stills wearing a Lady Godiva wig.

The film is sometimes cited, as on the DVD release of the 1952 &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;, as the film that led to the downfall of Gilbert&#x27;s career. Gilbert, a popular silent film actor best known for his work opposite Garbo, possessed a pleasant, tenor speaking voice which did not always match his heroic, dashing screen image. In &quot;Hollywood Revue&quot; he plays the balcony scene from &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; with Norma Shearer, first straight, then for laughs with contemporary slang. It is possible, though, that the negative effect of the film on Gilbert&#x27;s career has been overstated, since many contemporary reviews made no criticism of his performance. His problems really began with the next two films he made, &quot;His Glorious Night&quot; (1929) and &quot;Redemption&quot; (1930).

== Reception ==
The film, which was shot in 25 days with a budget of US$426,000, was popular with audiences and critics alike, especially in its initial big-city engagements. &quot;Brimming over with good fun and catchy music&quot;, Mordaunt Hall of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote. &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;the top novelty film to be turned out to date...If the theater booths give it an even break, nothing can stop it.&quot; &quot;Film Daily&quot; reported, &quot;A smash and a wow. Smart revue with plenty of comedy beautifully dressed and a cast that is gilt-edged.&quot; John Mosher of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called it &quot;the most extravagant and extensive musical comedy so far presented by the talking pictures, and is in itself a complete evening&#x27;s entertainment.&quot;

The film went on to make a profit of $1.1 million and was considered for the Academy Award for Best Picture (there were no official nominations at that point in Motion Picture Association of America history). Producer Rapf tried to follow it up with another revue, &quot;The Hollywood Revue of 1930&quot;, which was changed during production to &quot;The March of Time&quot;, and finally abandoned. Musical numbers already shot for the film were edited into M-G-M short subjects of the early 1930s.

==Alternate version==
Some sources list the original running time of &quot;Hollywood Revue of 1929&quot; as 130 minutes. At least two sequences in the original roadshow version are missing from current prints: an opening recitation by the showgirls who are seen posing in the &quot;Hollywood Revue&quot; sign after the opening credits, and the appearance of Nils Asther, who assisted Jack Benny in introducing the final &quot;Orange Blossom&quot; number.

== Preservation ==
The film survives intact with its original Technicolor sequences. It was released on laserdisc in the 1990s from MGM/UA Home Video, and on DVD in 2009 through the Warner Archive Collection.
