<text>An end-user license agreement or EULA () is a legal contract between a software supplier and a customer or end-user. 

The practice of selling licenses to rather than copies of software predates the recognition of software copyright, which has been recognized since the 1970s in the United States. Initially, EULAs were often printed as shrink wrap contracts, where tearing the shrink wrap indicated acceptance. Software distributed via the internet is more commonly licensed via clickwrap (where the user clicks to agree to the license) or browsewrap (continuing to browse the website indicates agreement).

Most companies prefer to sell licenses rather than copies of the software because it enables them to enforce stricter terms on the end user in a number of domains, especially by prohibiting transfer of ownership or use on multiple computers, and by asserting ownership of the copyright of derivative works, such as user-generated content in video games.

Enforceability of EULAs has been a controversial issue and varies by jurisdiction. In the United States, it is possible to enforce a EULA that is shown to the customer after purchase, but this is not the case in Germany. European Union law only allows for enforcement of EULAs insofar as they do not breach reasonable customer expectations.

There have been numerous attempts to make fun of EULAs that are not read, for example by including a provision to sell the user&#x27;s soul to the company, or a stipulation to not use digital audio workstation software in the development of missiles or nuclear weapons.

== Software copyright ==
The source code (or compiled binaries in the form of object code) of a computer program is protected by copyright law that vests the owner with the exclusive right to copy the code. The underlying ideas or algorithms are not protected by copyright law, but are often treated as a trade secret and concealed by such methods as non-disclosure agreements. Software copyright has been recognized since the mid-1970s and is vested in the company that makes the software, not the employees or contractors who wrote it.

The tendency to license proprietary software—to sell the right of use of the software rather than a copy of the software—dates from the time period before the existence, then the scope of software copyright protection was clear. These licenses have continued in use after software copyright was recognized in the courts, and are considered to grant the company extra protection compared to copyright law. Virtually all proprietary software is not sold as a copy but rather as a license with associated EULA.

==Delivery of EULAs ==
Initially, end-user license agreement (EULAs) were printed on either the shrinkwrap packaging encasing the product (shrink wrap contract) or a piece of paper. The license often stipulated that a customer agreed if they did not return the product within a specified interval. After the advent of the internet, EULAs are more often found in clickwrap format where the user only needs to click an agree button. Without the constraints of having to print the license, the length of the agreements ballooned. Another type of license, browserwrap, intuits the user&#x27;s consent after they simply visit a website and are made aware of the terms of use.

EULAs are often written in vague language, and do not inform the customer of the limitations on the agreement&#x27;s enforceability. Most EULAs have been designed so that it is very difficult to read and understand them, but easy to agree to the licensing terms without reading them. Regardless of how easy it is to access, very few consumers read any part of the license agreement. Most assume the terms are unobjectionable or barely notice agreeing while installing the software. Companies take advantage of consumers&#x27; inattention to insert provisions into EULAs. Many assert that the purchaser is an adult and takes responsibility for minors&#x27; use of the product, to relieve the vendor of the issue of contracting with a minor and liability from minors&#x27; use of the product.

EULAs, almost always offered on a take-it-or-leave-it basis as a non-negotiable condition for using the software, are very far from the prototypical contract where both parties fully understand the terms and agree of their own free will. Proponents argue that the contracts streamline purchases and that savings for the company could be passed to the consumer. Enterprises buying software for a large number of employees often negotiate the licensing agreement with the vendor.

==Common provisions==
According to one study, economic competition from different software services leads to EULAs more favorable to the customer.
===Resale===
According to United States federal law, a company can restrict the parties to which it sells but it cannot prevent a buyer from reselling the product. Software licensing agreements usually prohibit resale, enabling the company to maximize revenue. Proprietary software is usually offered under a restrictive license that bans copying and reuse and often limits the purchaser to using the software on one computer. Source code is rarely available. Derivative software works and reverse engineering are usually explicitly prohibited. The issue of reuse is particularly important in the copyright law of English-speaking countries.

===Data collection===
Many EULAs allow the vendor to collect information about the user and use it in unrestricted ways. 

===Derivative works===
Some EULAs restrict the ability of users to exercise copyright over derivative work made using the software, such as creative creations in the virtual worlds of video games.
Although most video game EULAs assert that the developer holds the copyright on any user-generated content, this is contested by users and has not been tested in the court system. Legal scholar Anthony Michael Catton suggests that user-generated content should be considered jointly authored by the video game developers and the users.

Some companies do allow video footage of their games to be distributed online, even for profit.
===License term===
Traditionally, software was distributed in the form of binary object code that could not be understood or modified by the user, but could be downloaded and run. The user bought a perpetual license to use a particular version of the software. Software as service (SaaS) vendors—who have the majority market share in application software —rarely offer perpetual licenses. SaaS licenses are usually temporary and charged on a pay-per-usage or subscription basis, although other revenue models such as freemium are also used. Even if the user purchases a perpetual license, it is common for EULAs to allow unilateral termination by the vendor for any number of vague reasons or none at all. Furthermore, many EULAs allow the vendor to change the terms at any time and the customer must choose between agreeing or ceasing use of the product, without getting a refund. EULAs are also applicable to in-app purchases and microtransactions. As a result, players could lose access to purchased content if the vendor decides to terminate their license and withdraw the content.
===Product liability===
Most EULAs disclaim any liability for harms caused by the product, and prevent the purchaser from accessing the court system to seek a remedy.

==Enforceability==
There has been substantial debate on to what extent EULAs can be considered binding. Many EULAs contain stipulations that are illegal and therefore unenforceable. Software vendors keep these unenforceable provisions in the agreements, perhaps because users rarely resort to the legal system to challenge them.

===European Union===
Under the New Digital Content Directive effective since 2022 in the European Union, EULAs are only enforceable to the extent that they do not breach reasonable consumer expectations. The gap between expectations and the content of EULAs is especially wide when it comes to restrictions on copying and transferring ownership of digital content. In Germany, EULAs are only valid if known to the customer before purchase.
===United Kingdom===

The United Kingdom&#x27;s National Consumer Council undertook a study published in 2008 which found issues with the way 17 major IT businesses had been using EULA&#x27;s and asked the Office of Fair Trading to undertake an investigation. As of 2020, the enforceability of EULAs and provisions granting copyright of all derivative works to the developer has not been judicially tested in United Kingdom.
===United States===
Before the 1996 &quot;ProCD, Inc. v. Zeidenberg&quot; in the United States, shrinkwrap licenses were not held to be binding, but since then they often have been. In some shrinkwrap cases the customer was found not to have consented to the EULA and was therefore not bound by it. Clickwrap has been found generally to be enforceable—even when the license terms are provided after the sale. The enforceability of browserwrap is lower, but has been enforced in some cases where it can be proven that the user was presented with the terms of use and continued to use the website.
==Translations==
EULAs are primarily legal documents with IT terminology. As such, knowledge in several different domains may be necessary to produce a satisfactory translation. 
==Humor==
There have been numerous attempts to make fun of EULAs not being read. Some EULAs bury a contract offering payment to a reader who notices the clause. As an April Fool&#x27;s Day joke, Gamestation added a clause stating that users who placed an order on April 1, 2010, agreed to irrevocably give their soul to the company, which 7,500 users agreed to. Although there was a checkbox to exempt out of the &quot;immortal soul&quot; clause, few users checked it and thus Gamestation concluded that 88% of their users did not read the agreement. During the installation of version 4 of the Advanced Query Tool the installer measured the elapsed time between the appearance and the acceptance of the end-user license agreements to calculate the average reading speed. If the agreements were accepted fast enough, a popup congratulated the users for reading several hundred words per second. &quot;South Park&quot; parodied this in the episode &quot;HumancentiPad&quot;, where Kyle had neglected to read the terms of service for his last iTunes update and therefore inadvertently agreed to have Apple employees experiment upon him.

<doc id="49769" wikidata="Q30008669" url="?curid=49769" title="Friendship book">
<text>Friendship books (also known as &quot;FBs&quot; in their abbreviated form) are small booklets made by stapling paper together, or are sometimes just sheets or strips of paper. They are usually decorated and the person who starts the book writes their name and address as the first person sending the book. People often include a list of interests as well. The FB is then passed around from penpal to penpal, and can often also become a way for one to meet new penpals. Most people hope to see the book again once it is full so they add their return address to the back cover of the book too, or inscribe &quot;Return to Sender&quot; on it. People also sometimes make FBs for someone else rather than themselves, in which case they write the name and address of the recipient on the front/at the top. Some people find friendship books fun because you can see where they have been in a trail back to the original sender/recipient.

The German friendship books (or poetry albums) serve a similar purpose but are kept, not sent away. Access is considered more intimate; sometimes the book even has a lock. The information given about oneself often includes quotations, poetry and worldly wisdom. Typically they are more like shared journals between two best friends or a couple and are kept at one of their houses.

Friendship books that require entrants to make drawings, use stickers or magazine photographs are known as &quot;deco&quot; friendship books or just simply &quot;decos&quot;. Typically, each entrant in the &quot;deco&quot; must use one full page to express themselves. Glitter, sequins, feathers and other scrapbooking supplies are frequently used in &quot;decos.&quot; Despite the artistic expressions used in these types of friendship books, the basic rules of passing the friendship book to person to person is the same.

When a &#x27;friendship book&#x27; is only one page (no staples), it&#x27;s called a &#x27;friendship sheet.&#x27; If the page is small, like the size of a postcard, or smaller, it&#x27;s called a &#x27;cram.&#x27; Friendship books that have a musical theme, where you have to add lyrics to your entry, are called &quot;lyrix&quot; or &quot;lyrics sheets&quot;.

==Slams==
Slams are friendship books that include a theme of questions, either &quot;Sign if you did/like the following&quot;, &quot;What is your favorite&quot; or other similar questions. These usually include one page as a &quot;sign in&quot;, several pages of questions, and then a &quot;sign out&quot; or &quot;shout out&quot; page at the end. 
Slams can be themed or regular. Typically they are small like a standard friendship book. Often they have a &quot;sign-in&quot; page where you put your label or name, then each page will often contain a question which you answer (i.e. When was the last time you said &quot;I love you&quot;) and the signer would write the appropriate response. At the end there is often a sign-out page as well where it&#x27;s dated. Slams have many variations and can be &quot;sign if&quot; slams (you sign only if the statement or question applies to you). These are handled in a number of ways, but most of them become more clear when you have it in-hand.

==Crams==
Crams are like friendship sheets or book, but no one includes any personal information. The idea (as the name implies) is to &quot;cram&quot; as many names and addresses into the provided space.

==Friendship sheet==
As the name implies, friendship sheets are nearly the same as friendship books, but they are made on a single sheet of paper or stationery.

==Deco==
Decos are similar to FBs, but are often larger in size. The cover is often decorated with interesting materials like magazine pictures, rubber stamps, decorative papers, and other embellishments. Each person who signs decorates a full page in the book. Sometimes the book has a theme, for example cats. Then, each person decorates their page following the theme. As with FBs, when these are full, they are sent home to the person for whom the book was made.

==Lyrix==
Lyrix are much like decos except that each page is decorated using lyrics from a song. Some are more plain with the words simply written in them, others are as artistic as decos with pictures and other ornamental adornments.

==Quotes==
Quotes are like Lyrics, but instead of song lyrics they contain quotes from movies. These can also be themed, such as Brad Pitt movie quotes. Quotes can be plain text or decorative.

<doc id="49770" wikidata="Q1050279" url="?curid=49770" title="High-yield debt">
<text>In finance, a high-yield bond (non-investment-grade bond, speculative-grade bond, or junk bond) is a bond that is rated below investment grade by credit rating agencies. These bonds have a higher risk of default or other adverse credit events but offer higher yields than investment-grade bonds to compensate for the increased risk. As of 2024, high-yield bonds have a higher yield than U.S. Treasury securities.

==Default risk==
As indicated by their lower credit ratings, high-yield debt entails more risk to the investor compared to investment grade bonds. Investors require a greater yield to compensate them for investing in the riskier securities.

In the case of high-yield bonds, the risk is largely that of default: the possibility that the issuer will be unable to make scheduled interest and principal payments in a timely manner.:208 The default rate in the high-yield sector of the U.S. bond market has averaged about 5% over the long term. During the liquidity crisis of 1989–90, the default rate was in the 5.6% to 7% range. During the COVID-19 pandemic, default rates rose to just under 9%.:209 A recession and accompanying weakening of business conditions tends to increase the possibility of default in the high-yield bond sector.

==Investors== 
Institutional investors (such as pension funds, mutual funds, banks, and insurance companies) are the largest purchasers of high-yield debt. Individual investors participate in the high-yield sector mainly through mutual funds.:211

Some institutional investors have by-laws that prohibit investing in bonds which have ratings below a particular level. As a result, the lower-rated securities may have a different institutional investor base than investment-grade bonds.

==U.S. market and indices==
U.S. high-yield bonds outstanding as of the first quarter of 2022 are estimated to be about $1.8 trillion, comprising about 16% of the U.S. corporate bond market, which totals $10.7 trillion. New issuances amounted to $435 billion (~$ in ) in 2020.

Indices for the high-yield market include:
* ICE Bank of America US High Yield Total Return Index,
* Bloomberg Barclays US Corporate High Yield Total Return Index, 
* S&amp;P U.S. Issued High Yield Corporate Bond Index, and 
* FTSE US High-Yield Market Index.

Some investors, preferring to dedicate themselves to higher-rated and less-risky investments, use an index that only includes BB-rated and B-rated securities. Other investors focus on the lowest quality debt rated CCC or distressed securities, commonly defined as those yielding 1,000 basis points over equivalent government bonds.

==Usage==
=== Corporate debt ===
The original speculative grade bonds were bonds that once had been investment grade at time of issue, but where the credit rating of the issuer had slipped and the possibility of default increased significantly. These bonds are called &quot;fallen angels&quot;.

The investment banker Michael Milken realized that fallen angels had regularly been valued less than what they were worth. His experience with speculative grade bonds started with his investment in these. In the mid-1980s, Milken and other investment bankers at Drexel Burnham Lambert created a new type of high-yield debt: bonds that were speculative grade from the start, and were used as a financing tool in leveraged buyouts (LBOs) and hostile takeovers.:208 In a LBO, an acquirer would issue speculative grade bonds to help pay for an acquisition and then use the target&#x27;s cash flow to help pay the debt over time. Companies acquired in this manner were commonly saddled with very high debt loads, hampering their financial flexibility. Debt-to-equity ratios of at least 6 to 1 were common in such transactions. This led to controversy as to the economic and social consequences of transforming firms through the aggressive use of financial leverage.

In 2005, over 80% of the principal amount of high-yield debt issued by U.S. companies went toward corporate purposes rather than acquisitions or buyouts.

In emerging markets, such as China and Vietnam, bonds have become increasingly important as short term financing options, since access to traditional bank credits has always been proved to be limited, especially if borrowers are non-state corporates. The corporate bond market has been developing in line with the general trend of capital market, and equity market in particular.

=== Debt repackaging and subprime crisis ===
High-yield bonds can also be repackaged into collateralized debt obligations (CDO), thereby raising the credit rating of the senior tranches above the rating of the original debt. The senior tranches of high-yield CDOs can thus meet the minimum credit rating requirements of pension funds and other institutional investors despite the significant risk in the original high-yield debt.

When such CDOs are backed by assets of dubious value, such as subprime mortgage loans, and lose market liquidity, the bonds and their derivatives become what is referred to as &quot;toxic debt&quot;. Holding such &quot;toxic&quot; assets led to the demise of several investment banks such as Lehman Brothers and other financial institutions during the subprime mortgage crisis of 2007–09 and led the US Treasury to seek congressional appropriations to buy those assets in September 2008 to prevent a systemic crisis of the banks.

Such assets represent a serious problem for purchasers because of their complexity. Having been repackaged perhaps several times, it is difficult and time-consuming for auditors and accountants to determine their true value. As the recession of 2008–09 hit, their value decreased further as more debtors defaulted, so they represented a rapidly depreciating asset. Even those assets that might have gone up in value in the long-term depreciated rapidly, quickly becoming &quot;toxic&quot; for the banks that held them. Toxic assets, by increasing the variance of banks&#x27; assets, can turn otherwise healthy institutions into zombies. Potentially insolvent banks made too few good loans creating a debt overhang problem. Alternatively, potentially insolvent banks with toxic assets sought out very risky speculative loans to shift risk onto their depositors and other creditors.

On 23 March 2009, U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner announced a Public-Private Investment Partnership (PPIP) to buy toxic assets from banks&#x27; balance sheets. The major stock market indices in the United States rallied on the day of the announcement rising by over six percent with the shares of bank stocks leading the way. PPIP has two primary programs. The Legacy Loans Program will attempt to buy residential loans from banks&#x27; balance sheets. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation will provide non-recourse loan guarantees for up to 85 percent of the purchase price of legacy loans. Private sector asset managers and the U.S. Treasury will provide the remaining assets. The second program is called the legacy securities program which will buy mortgage backed securities (RMBS) that were originally rated AAA and commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) and asset-backed securities (ABS) which are rated AAA. The funds will come in many instances in equal parts from the U.S. Treasury&#x27;s Troubled Asset Relief Program monies, private investors, and from loans from the Federal Reserve&#x27;s Term Asset Lending Facility (TALF). The initial size of the Public Private Investment Partnership is projected to be $500 billion. Nobel Prize–winning economist Paul Krugman has been very critical of this program arguing the non-recourse loans lead to a hidden subsidy that will be split by asset managers, banks&#x27; shareholders and creditors. Banking analyst Meredith Whitney argues that banks will not sell bad assets at fair market values because they are reluctant to take asset write downs. Removing toxic assets would also reduce the volatility of banks&#x27; stock prices. Because stock is akin to a call option on a firm&#x27;s assets, this lost volatility will hurt the stock price of distressed banks. Therefore, such banks will only sell toxic assets at above market prices.

==EU member state debt crisis==
On 27 April 2010, the Greek debt rating was decreased to &quot;junk&quot; status by Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s amidst fears of default by the Greek Government. They also cut Portugal&#x27;s credit ratings by two notches to A, over concerns about its state debt and public finances on 28 April.
On 5 July 2011, Portugal&#x27;s rating was decreased to &quot;junk&quot; status by Moody&#x27;s (by four notches from Baa1 to Ba2) saying there was a growing risk the country would need a second bail-out before it was ready to borrow money from financial markets again, and private lenders might have to contribute.

On 13 July 2012, Moody&#x27;s cut Italy&#x27;s credit rating two notches, to Baa2 (leaving it just above junk). Moody&#x27;s warned the country it could be cut further.

With the ongoing deleveraging process within the European banking system, many European CFOs are still issuing high-yield bonds. As a result, by the end of September 2012, the total amount of annual primary bond issuances stood at . It is assumed that high-yield bonds are still attractive for companies with a stable funding base, although the ratings have declined continuously for most of those bonds.

<doc id="49786" wikidata="Q215108" url="?curid=49786" title="Microclimate">
<text>A microclimate (or micro-climate) is a local set of atmospheric conditions that differ from those in the surrounding areas, often slightly but sometimes substantially. The term may refer to areas as small as a few square meters or smaller (for example a garden bed, underneath a rock, or a cave) or as large as many square kilometers. Because climate is statistical, which implies spatial and temporal variation of the mean values of the describing parameters, microclimates are identified as statistically distinct conditions which occur and/or persist within a region. Microclimates can be found in most places but are most pronounced in topographically dynamic zones such as mountainous areas, islands, and coastal areas.

Microclimates exist, for example, near bodies of water which may cool the local atmosphere, or in heavy urban areas where brick, concrete, and asphalt absorb the sun&#x27;s energy, heat up, and re-radiate that heat to the ambient air: the resulting urban heat island (UHI) is a kind of microclimate that is additionally driven by relative paucity of vegetation.

==Background==
The terminology &quot;micro-climate&quot; first appeared in the 1950s in publications such as &quot;Climates in Miniature: A Study of Micro-Climate Environment&quot; (Thomas Bedford Franklin, 1955).

==Examples of microclimates==
The area in a developed industrial park may vary greatly from a wooded park nearby, as natural flora in parks absorb light and heat in leaves that a building roof or parking lot just radiates back into the air. Advocates of solar energy argue that widespread use of solar collection can mitigate overheating of urban environments by absorbing sunlight and putting it to work instead of heating the foreign surface objects.

A microclimate can offer an opportunity as a small growing region for crops that cannot thrive in the broader area; this concept is often used in permaculture practiced in northern temperate climates. Microclimates can be used to the advantage of gardeners who carefully choose and position their plants. Cities often raise the average temperature by zoning, and a sheltered position can reduce the severity of winter. Roof gardening, however, exposes plants to more extreme temperatures in both summer and winter.

In an urban area, tall buildings create their own microclimate, both by overshadowing large areas and by channeling strong winds to ground level. Wind effects around tall buildings are assessed as part of a microclimate study.

Microclimates can also refer to purpose-made environments, such as those in a room or other enclosure. Microclimates are commonly created and carefully maintained in museum display and storage environments. This can be done using passive methods, such as silica gel, or with active microclimate control devices.

Usually, if the inland areas have a humid continental climate, the coastal areas stay much milder during winter months, in contrast to the hotter summers. This is the case in places such as British Columbia, where Vancouver has an oceanic wet winter with rare frosts, but inland areas that average several degrees warmer in summer have cold and snowy winters.

==Sources and influences on microclimate==
Two main parameters to define a microclimate within a certain area are temperature and humidity. A source of a drop in temperature and/or humidity can be attributed to different sources or influences.
Often a microclimate is shaped by a conglomerate of different influences and is a subject of microscale meteorology.

===Cold air pool===
Examples of the cold air pool (CAP) effect are Gstettneralm Sinkhole in Austria (lowest recorded temperature ) and Peter Sinks in the US.
The main criterion on the wind speed formula_1 in order to create a warm air flow penetration into a CAP is the following:
:formula_2

where formula_3 is the Froude number, formula_4 — the Brunt–Väisälä frequency, formula_5 — depth of the valley, and formula_6 — Froude number at the threshold wind speed.

===Craters===
The presence of permafrost close to the surface in a crater creates a unique microclimate environment.

===Caves===
Caves are important geologic formations that can house unique and delicate geologic/biological environments. The vast majority of caves found are made of calcium carbonates such as limestone. In these dissolution environments, many species of flora and fauna find home. The mixture of water content within the cave atmosphere, air pressure, geochemistry of the cave rock as well as the waste product from these species can combine to make unique microclimates within cave systems. 
The speleogenetic effect is an observed and studied process of air circulation within cave environments brought on by convection. In phreatic conditions the cave surfaces are exposed to the enclosed air (as opposed to submerged and interacting with water from the water table in vadose conditions). This air circulates water particles that condense on cave walls and formations such as speleothems. This condensing water has been found to contribute to cave wall erosion and the formation of morphological features. Some examples of this can be found in the limestone walls of Grotta Giusti; a thermal cave near Monsummano, Lucca, Italy. Any process that leads to an increase or decrease in chemical/physical processes will subsequently impact the environment within that system. Air density within caves, which directly relates to the convection processes, is determined by the air temperature, humidity, and pressure. In enclosed cave environments, the introduction of bacteria, algae, plants, animals, or human interference can change any one of these factors therefore altering the microenvironment within the cave. There are over 750 caves worldwide that are available for people to visit. The constant human traffic through these cave environments can have a negative effect on the microclimates as well as on the geological and archeological findings. Factors that play into the deterioration of these environments include nearby deforestation, agriculture operations, water exploitation, mining, and tourist operations.

The speleogenetic effect of normal caves tends to show a slow circulation of air. In unique conditions where acids are present, the effects of erosion and changes to the microenvironment can be drastically enhanced. One example is the effect of the presence of hydrosulfuric acid(). When the oxidized hydrosulfuric acid chemically alters to sulfuric acid(), this acid starts to react with the calcium carbonate rock at much higher rates. The water involved in this reaction tends to have a high pH of 3 which renders the water almost unlivable for many bacteria and algae. An example of this can be found in the Grotta Grande del Vento cave in Ancona, Italy.

===Plant microclimate===
As pointed out by meteorologist Rudolf Geiger, not only does climate influence the living plant, but the opposite effect of the interaction of plants on their environment can also take place, which is ultimately known as &quot;plant climate&quot;. This effect has important consequences for forests in the midst of a continent; indeed, if forests were not creating their own clouds and water cycle with their efficient evapotranspiration activity, there would be no forest far away from coasts, as statistically, without any other influence, rainfall occurrence would decrease from the coast towards inland. Planting trees to fight drought has also been proposed in the context of afforestation.

===Dams===

Artificial reservoirs as well as natural ones create microclimates and often influence the macroscopic climate as well.

=== Slopes ===
Another contributing factor of microclimate is the slope or aspect of an area. South-facing slopes in the Northern Hemisphere and north-facing slopes in the Southern Hemisphere are exposed to more direct sunlight than opposite slopes and are therefore warmer for longer periods of time, giving the slope a warmer microclimate than the areas around the slope. The lowest area of a glen may sometimes frost sooner or harder than a nearby spot uphill, because cold air sinks, a drying breeze may not reach the lowest bottom, and humidity lingers and precipitates, then freezes.

===Soil types===
The type of soil found in an area can also affect microclimates. For example, soils heavy in clay can act like pavement, moderating the near ground temperature. On the other hand, if soil has many air pockets, then the heat could be trapped underneath the topsoil, resulting in the increased possibility of frost at ground level.

==Cities and regions known for microclimates==

===Americas===
* Northern California above the Bay Area is also well known for microclimates with significant differences of temperatures. The coastline typically has daytime temperatures of during summer months along that coastline, but inland towns not far from the ocean such as Lakeport, can be as hot as in an average summer day, in spite of being just around inland. Even as far north as the Klamath River valley around the 41st parallel north between Willow Creek and Eureka averages such temperatures, which is extremely hot for such northerly areas. At this parallel, the temperature at the coast is so cool that Willow Creek beats Eureka&#x27;s all-time record temperature on average 79 times per year. This is in spite of the areas being less than from each other.
** San Francisco is a city with various microclimates. Due to the city&#x27;s varied topography and influence from the prevailing summer marine layer, weather conditions can vary by as much as 9 °F (5 °C) from block to block and a full 30 °F (17 °C) between the coastal fog belt and the heat island of downtown. The Noe Valley district for example, is typically warmer and sunnier than adjacent areas because the surrounding hills block some of the cool fog from the Pacific.
** The region as a whole, known as the San Francisco Bay Area can have a wide range of extremes in temperature. In the basins and valleys adjoining the coast, climate is subject to wide variations within short distances as a result of the influence of topography on the circulation of marine air. The San Francisco Bay Area offers many varieties of climate within a few miles. In the Bay Area, for example, the average maximum temperature in July is about at Half Moon Bay on the coast, at Walnut Creek only inland, and at Tracy, just inland.
* The Los Angeles and San Diego areas are also subject to phenomena typical of a microclimate. The temperatures can vary as much as ) between inland areas and the coast, with a temperature gradient of over one degree per mile (1.6 km) from the coast inland. Hills and mountains can also block coastal air masses. The San Fernando Valley is usually much warmer in summer than most of Los Angeles, because the Santa Monica Mountains usually block the cool ocean breezes and fog. Southern California has also a weather phenomenon called &quot;June Gloom&quot; or &quot;May Grey&quot;, which sometimes gives overcast or foggy skies in the morning at the coast, but usually gives sunny skies by noon, during late spring and early summer.
* The Big Island of Hawaii is also an area known for microclimates, as Kailua-Kona and Hilo, Hawaii, experience rainfall of and per year, respectively, despite being just from each other.
* Calgary, Alberta, is also known for its microclimates. Especially notable are the differences between the downtown and river valley/flood plain regions and the areas to the west and north. This is largely due to an elevation difference within the city&#x27;s boundaries of over , but can also be somewhat attributed to the effects of the seasonal Chinooks.
* Halifax, Nova Scotia, also has numerous microclimates. Coastal temperatures and weather conditions can differ considerably from areas located just inland. This is true in all seasons. Varying elevations are common throughout the city, and it is even possible to experience several microclimates while traveling on a single highway due to these changing elevations.
* Vancouver and its metro area also has many microclimates. North Vancouver and other regions situated on the mountain slopes get over of precipitation a year on average, while other regions to the south get around , although they are less than away. Temperatures in the Fraser Valley inland may be up to 10 °C (18 °F) warmer than the coast, while in winter they are several degrees colder.
* Chesapeake Bay is also known for its subtropical microclimate. It is most notable for its mild climatic effects on the area east and west of the lowlands of Maryland and Delmarva. Having over of water; (most of which is a mix of fresh and salt water) creates higher levels of humidity and heat in the spring and summer months. An example of this effect is the survival of subtropical palm trees and plants such as water hyacinths in the area.
* Chile Chico and Los Antiguos on the southern shores of General Carrera Lake have favourable conditions for agriculture despite being in inner Patagonia.
*New York City and its surrounding metro area feature an extensive urban heat island, and influence from the Atlantic Ocean. These factors cause it to be the northernmost major city in the US that Köppen describes as humid subtropical, with the city being in the 7a/7b/8a USDA zones, compared to nearby cities south of it, which feature lower zones.

===Europe===
* The Ticino region in Switzerland has a microclimate in which palm trees and banana trees can grow.
* Gran Canaria is called &quot;Miniature Continent&quot; for its rich variety of microclimates.
* Tenerife is known for its wide variety of microclimates.
* Istanbul exhibits a multitude of distinct microclimates because of its hilly topography and maritime influences. Within the city, average summer mean temperatures range from depending on proximity to the Black Sea, with more significant differences on certain days. Rainfall also varies widely owing to the rain shadow of the hills in Istanbul, from around on the southern fringe at Florya to on the northern fringe at Bahçeköy. Furthermore, while the city itself lies in USDA hardiness zones 9a to 9b, its inland suburbs lie in zone 8b with isolated pockets of zone 8a, restricting the cultivation of cold-hardy subtropical plants to the coasts.
* Leeds, located in Yorkshire, England, is known to have a number of microclimates because of the number of valleys surrounding the city centre.
* The central west coast of Portugal, similarly to California, has huge differences in summer temperatures from the surrounding inland regions. In less than , average daily summer temperatures can vary through as much as 10 degrees Celsius/18 degrees Fahrenheit, from in Peniche or São Pedro de Moel to around in Santarém or Tomar. This phenomenon is caused by local upwelling created by the northern Nortada winds.
* The coastal areas in the Andalusia region of Spain has a microclimate. Further north along the coast, Cádiz has a summer average of with warm nights, whereas nearby Jerez de la Frontera has summer highs of with inland areas further north such as Seville being even hotter.
* Sorana, a commune in Italy&#x27;s Pescia Valley with a microclimate considered ideal for growing the Sorana bean.
* The Nizza (Nice) district of Frankfurt-am-Main, Germany is a small area on the north bank of the River Main where wind shelter and sunlight reflected off the river produces a Mediterranean climate and supports one of the largest gardens of southern European plants north of the Alps.

===Asia and Oceania===
* Amman, Jordan, has extreme examples of microclimate, and almost every neighbourhood exhibits its own weather. It is known among locals that some boroughs such as the northern and western suburbs are among the coldest in the city, and can be experiencing frost or snow whilst other warmer districts such as the city centre can be at much warmer temperatures at the same time.
* Sydney, Australia, has a microclimate occurring prominently in the warmer months. Inland, in Sydney&#x27;s western suburbs, the climate is drier and significantly hotter with temperatures generally around above Sydney CBD and Eastern Suburbs (the coast), as sea breezes do not penetrate further inland. In summer, the coast averages at , while inland varies between , depending on the suburb. In extreme occasions, the Coast would have a temperature of , while a suburb ) inland bakes in heat. However, winter lows in the West are around cooler than the coastal suburbs, and may provide mild to moderate frost. Within the city and surrounds, rainfall varies, from around in the far-west to at Observatory Hill (the east or the coast).

<doc id="49791" wikidata="Q725559" url="?curid=49791" title="Edmund Blunden">
<text>Edmund Charles Blunden (1 November 1896 – 20 January 1974) was an English poet, author, and critic. Like his friend Siegfried Sassoon, he wrote of his experiences in World War I in both verse and prose. For most of his career, Blunden was also a reviewer for English publications and an academic in Tokyo and later Hong Kong. He ended his career as Professor of Poetry at the University of Oxford. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature six times.

==Early years==
Born in London, Blunden was the eldest of the nine children of Charles Edmund Blunden (1871–1951) and his wife, Georgina Margaret &quot;née&quot; Tyler, who were joint-headteachers of Yalding school. Blunden was educated at Christ&#x27;s Hospital and The Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford.

==World War I==
In September 1915, over a year after the outbreak of World War I, Blunden was commissioned as a temporary second lieutenant into the British Army&#x27;s Royal Sussex Regiment. He was posted to the 11th (Service) Battalion (1st South Down), Royal Sussex Regiment, a Kitchener&#x27;s Army unit that formed part of the 116th Brigade of the 39th Division in May 1916, two months after the battalion&#x27;s arrival in France. He served with the battalion on the Western Front to the end of the war, taking part in the actions at Ypres and the Somme, followed in 1917 by the Battle of Passchendaele. In January 1917, and by now a temporary lieutenant (having been promoted to that rank in September 1916), he was awarded the Military Cross (MC), the citation for which reads:

Blunden survived nearly two years in the front line without physical injury (despite being gassed in October 1917), but for the rest of his life, he bore mental scars from his experiences. With characteristic self-deprecation, he attributed his survival to his diminutive size, which made &quot;an inconspicuous target&quot;. His own account of his experiences was published in 1928, as &quot;Undertones of War&quot;.

==University==
Blunden left the army in 1919 and took up the scholarship at Oxford that he had won while he was still at school. On the same English literature course was Robert Graves, and the two were close friends during their time at Oxford together, but Blunden found university life unsatisfactory and left in 1920 to take up a literary career, at first acting as assistant to Middleton Murry on the &quot;Athenaeum&quot;.

==Writer==

An early supporter was Siegfried Sassoon, who became a lifelong friend. In 1920, Blunden published a collection of poems, &quot;The Waggoner&quot;, and with Alan Porter, he edited the poems of John Clare (mostly from Clare&#x27;s manuscript).

Blunden&#x27;s next book of poems, &quot;The Shepherd&quot;, published in 1922, won the Hawthornden Prize, but his poetry, though well reviewed, did not provide enough to live on. In 1924, he accepted the post of lecturer of English at the University of Tokyo. In December 1925, he dedicated a poem « UP!UP! » to the rugby men of the University and this became the anthem of the Tokyo University RFC. He returned to England in 1927, and was literary editor of the &quot;Nation&quot; for a year. In 1927, he published a short book, &quot;On the Poems of Henry Vaughan, Characteristics and Intimations, with his principal Latin poems carefully translated into English verse&quot; (London: H. Cobden-Sanderson, 1927), expanding and revising an essay that he had published, in November 1926, in the &quot;London Mercury&quot;. In 1931, he returned to Oxford as a Fellow of Merton College, where he was highly regarded as a tutor. During his years in Oxford, Blunden published extensively: several collections of poetry including &quot;Choice or Chance&quot; (1934) and &quot;Shells by a Stream&quot; (1944), prose works on Charles Lamb; Edward Gibbon; Leigh Hunt; Percy Bysshe Shelley (&quot;&quot;); John Taylor; and Thomas Hardy; and a book about a game he loved, &quot;Cricket Country&quot; (1944). He returned to full-time writing in 1944, becoming assistant editor of &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;. In 1947, he returned to Japan as a member of the British liaison mission in Tokyo. In 1953 after three years back in England, he accepted the post of Professor of English Literature at the University of Hong Kong.

==Later life==
Blunden retired in 1964 and settled in Suffolk. In 1966, he was nominated for the Oxford Professorship of Poetry in succession to Graves; with some misgivings, he agreed to stand and was elected by a large majority over the other candidate, Robert Lowell. However, he now found the strain of public lecturing too much for him, and after two years, he resigned.

He died of a heart attack at his home at Long Melford, Suffolk, in 1974, and is buried in the churchyard of Holy Trinity Church, Long Melford.

==Personal life==
Blunden was married three times. While still in the army, he met and married Mary Daines in 1918. They had three children, the first of whom died in infancy. They divorced in 1931, and in 1933, Blunden married Sylva Norman, a young novelist and critic. That marriage, which was childless, was dissolved in 1945. The same year, he married Claire Margaret Poynting (1918–2000), one of his former pupils. Together, they had four daughters, who included Margaret, Lucy, and Frances. While in Japan in the summer of 1925, he met Aki Hayashi, and he began a relationship. When Blunden returned to England in 1927, Aki accompanied him and would become his secretary. The relationship later changed from a romantic one to a platonic friendship, and they remained in contact for the rest of her life.

Blunden&#x27;s love of cricket, celebrated in his book &quot;Cricket Country&quot;, is described by the biographer Philip Ziegler as fanatical. Blunden and his friend Rupert Hart-Davis regularly opened the batting for a publisher&#x27;s eleven in the 1930s (Blunden insisted on batting without gloves). An affectionate obituary tribute in &quot;The Guardian&quot; commented, &quot;He loved cricket… and played it ardently and very badly&quot;, and in a review of &quot;Cricket Country&quot;, George Orwell described him as &quot;the true cricketer&quot;:

The test of a true cricketer is that he shall prefer village cricket to &#x27;good&#x27; cricket [... Blunden&#x27;s] friendliest memories are of the informal village game, where everyone plays in braces, where the blacksmith is liable to be called away in mid-innings on an urgent job, and sometimes, about the time when the light begins to fail, a ball driven for four kills a rabbit on the boundary.

In a 2009 appreciation of the book and its author, Bangalore writer Suresh Menon wrote:

Any cricket book that talks easily of Henry James and Siegfried Sassoon and Ranji and Grace and Richard Burton (the writer, not the actor) and Coleridge is bound to have a special charm of its own. As Blunden says, &quot;The game which made me write at all, is not terminated at the boundary, but is reflected beyond, is echoed and varied out there among the gardens and the barns, the dells and the thickets, and belongs to some wider field.&quot;
Perhaps that is what all books on cricket are trying to say.

Blunden had a robust sense of humour. In Hong Kong, he relished linguistic misunderstandings such as those of the restaurant that offered &quot;fried prawn&#x27;s balls&quot; and the schoolboy who wrote, &quot;In Hong Kong there is a queer at every bus-stop&quot;.

His fellow poets&#x27; regard for Blunden was illustrated by the contributions to a dinner in his honour for which poems were specially written by Cecil Day-Lewis and William Plomer; T. S. Eliot and Walter de la Mare were guests; and Sassoon provided the Burgundy.

==Honours==
Blunden&#x27;s public honours included the CBE, 1951; the Queen&#x27;s gold medal for Poetry, 1956; the Royal Society of Literature&#x27;s Benson Medal; the Order of the Rising Sun, 3rd Class (Japan), 1963; and honorary Membership of the Japan Academy.

On 11 November 1985, Blunden was among 16 Great War poets commemorated on a slate stone unveiled in Poets&#x27; Corner in Westminster Abbey. The inscription on the stone was taken from Wilfred Owen&#x27;s &quot;Preface&quot; to his poems and reads: &quot;My subject is War, and the pity of War. The Poetry is in the pity.&quot;

==Works==
Blunden&#x27;s output was prolific. To those who thought that he published too much, he quoted Walter de la Mare&#x27;s observation that time was the poet&#x27;s best editor.

<doc id="49793" wikidata="Q514998" url="?curid=49793" title="Richard Aldington">
<text>Richard Aldington (born Edward Godfree Aldington; 8 July 1892 – 27 July 1962) was an English writer and poet. He was an early associate of the Imagist movement. His 50-year writing career covered poetry, novels, criticism and biography. He edited &quot;The Egoist&quot;, a literary journal, and wrote for &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;The Criterion&quot;, and &quot;Poetry&quot;. His biography, &quot;Wellington&quot; (1946), won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize.

Aldington was married to the poet Hilda Doolittle, known by her initials H.D., from 1913 to 1938. His acquaintances included writers T. S. Eliot, D. H. Lawrence, Ezra Pound, W. B. Yeats, Lawrence Durrell, C. P. Snow, and others. He championed H.D. as the major poetic voice of the Imagist movement and helped her work gain international notice.

==Early life and education==
Edward Godfree (known from an early age as &quot;Richard&quot;) Aldington was born in Portsmouth, the eldest of four children of Albert Edward Aldington (1864–1921) and Jessie May (1872–1954), née Godfree. His father failed to establish himself as a solicitor, going into business as a bookseller and stationer on Portsmouth High Street, later a solicitor&#x27;s clerk and amateur author; his mother was a novelist (as &quot;Mrs A. E. Aldington&quot;) and keeper of the Mermaid Inn at Rye. Both his parents wrote and published books, and their home held a large library of European and classical literature. As well as reading, Aldington&#x27;s interests at this time, all of which continued in later life, included butterfly-collecting, hiking, and learning languages – he went on to master French, Italian, Latin, and ancient Greek. He was educated at Mr. Sweetman&#x27;s Seminary for Young Gentlemen, St Margaret&#x27;s Bay, near Dover. His father died of heart problems at age 56.

Aldington attended Dover College, followed by the University of London. He was unable to complete his degree because of the financial circumstances of his family caused by his father&#x27;s failed speculations and ensuing debt. Supported by a small allowance from his parents, he worked as a sports journalist, started publishing poetry in British journals, and gravitated towards literary circles that included poets William Butler Yeats and Walter de la Mare.

In 1911, Aldington met society hostess Brigit Patmore, with whom he had a passing affair. At the time he was described as &quot;tall and broad-shouldered, with a fine forehead, thick longish hair of the indefinite colour blond hair turns to in adolescence, very bright blue eyes, too small a nose, and a determined mouth.&quot; Through her he met American poets Ezra Pound and H.D., who had previously been engaged to each other. Doolittle and Aldington grew closer and in 1913 travelled together extensively through Italy and France, just before the war. On their return to London in the summer they moved into separate flats in Churchwalk, Kensington, in West London. Doolittle lived at No. 6, Aldington at No. 8, and Pound at No. 10. In the presence of Pound and the Doolittle family, over from America for the summer, the couple married. They moved to 5 Holland Place Chambers into a flat of their own, although Pound soon moved in across the hall.

The poets were caught up in the literary ferment before the war, where new politics and ideas were passionately discussed and created in Soho tearooms and society salons. The couple bonded over their visions of new forms of poetry, feminism, and philosophy, emerging from the wake of staid Victorian mores. The couple were fed by a sense of peership and mutualism between them, rejecting hierarchies, beginning to view Pound as an intruder and interloper rather than a literary igniter.

The couple met influential American poet Amy Lowell and she introduced them to writer D. H. Lawrence in 1914, who would become a close friend and mentor to both.

==Career==

Aldington&#x27;s poetry was associated with the Imagist group, championing minimalist free verse with stark images, seeking to banish Victorian moralism. The group was key in the emerging Modernist movement. Ezra Pound coined the term &quot;imagistes&quot; for H.D. and Aldington (1912). Aldington&#x27;s poetry forms almost one third of the Imagists&#x27; inaugural anthology &quot;Des Imagistes&quot; (1914). The movement was heavily inspired by Japanese and classical European art. Aldington shared T. E. Hulme&#x27;s conviction that experimentation with traditional Japanese verse forms could provide a way forward for avant-garde literature in English.

Pound sent three of Aldington&#x27;s poems to Harriet Monroe&#x27;s magazine &quot;Poetry&quot; and they appeared in November 1912. She notes &quot;Mr Richard Aldington is a young English poet, one of the &quot;Imagistes&quot;, a group of ardent Hellenists who are pursuing interesting experiments in vers libre.&quot;She considered the poem &quot;Choricos&quot; to be his finest work, &quot;one of the most beautiful death songs in the language&quot;, &quot;a poem of studied and affected gravity&quot;.

H.D. became pregnant in August 1914, and in 1915 Aldington and H.D. relocated from their home in Holland Park near Ezra Pound to Hampstead close to D. H. Lawrence and Frieda. They felt calmer out of the bustle of the city, with more space and green. The pregnancy ended in a stillborn daughter, which traumatised the couple and put a great strain on the relationship; H.D. was 28 and Aldington 22. The outbreak of war in 1914 deeply disturbed Aldington, though no draft was in place at this time. H.D. felt more distant from the melee, not having a close affinity to the European landscape, geographical or political. This rift also put pressure on the marriage. Unhappy, Aldington dreamed of escape to America and began to have affairs. He began a relationship with Florence Fallas, who had also lost a child.

Between 1914 and 1916 Aldington was literary editor and a columnist at &quot;The Egoist&quot;. He was assistant editor with Leonard Compton-Rickett under Dora Marsden. Aldington knew Wyndham Lewis well and reviewed his work in &quot;The Egoist&quot;. He was also an associate of Ford Madox Ford&#x27;s, helping him with a propaganda volume for a government commission in 1914 and taking dictation for &quot;The Good Soldier&quot;.

===World War I and aftermath===
Aldington joined up in June 1916 and was sent for training at Wareham in Dorset. H.D. moved to be closer to her husband. He was then sent to a camp near Manchester. They found the duality of their lives harsh, and the gruelling, regimented nature of the training felt hard for the sensitive professional poet. He felt fundamentally different from the other men, more given to intellectual pursuits than unending physical labour that left him little time to write. Their sporadic meetings were emotionally wrenching and the couple could make no plans for their future together. He encouraged H.D. to return to America where she could make a safer and more stable home. They both watched news come in of heavy troop losses in France at the Somme and on other battlefields. She could not have information given on her husband&#x27;s future postings overseas, all held to be secret. Rationing and the forced draft began as the war turned against the British.

When Aldington was sent to the front in December 1916, the couple&#x27;s relationship became epistolary. He wrote that he had managed to complete 12 poems and three essays since joining up and wanted to work on producing a new book, in order to keep his mind on literature, despite his work of digging graves. He found the soldier&#x27;s life degrading, living with lice, cold, mud and little sanitation. His encounters with gas on the front would affect him for the rest of his life. He was given leave in July 1917 and the couple enjoyed a reunion during this brief reprieve. He felt distant from old Imagist friends like Pound who had not undergone the torturous life of the soldiers on the front and could not imagine the living conditions.

In November 1917, Aldington joined up in the 11th Leicestershires and was later commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Sussex Regiment. He finished the war as a signals officer and temporary captain, being demobilised in February 1919. He likely never fully recovered from the trauma of World War I, writing of his field experiences in the collections &quot;Images of War&quot; and &quot;Images of Desire&quot; (1919), which were suffused with a new melancholy. By the end of World War I, he was feeling disconsolate about his own talent as a poet. &quot;Exile and Other Poems&quot; (1923) also dealt with the process of trauma. A collection of war stories &quot;Roads to Glory&quot;, appeared in 1930. After this point he became known as a critic and biographer.

Towards the end of the war, H.D. lived with composer Cecil Gray, a friend of D. H. Lawrence&#x27;s. They had a daughter together in March 1919, the pregnancy much complicated by H.D.&#x27;s catching pneumonia towards the end. Neither Gray nor Aldington wanted to accept paternity. By the time of Aldington&#x27;s return H.D. was involved with the female writer Bryher. H.D. and Aldington formally separated and had relationships with other people, but they didn&#x27;t divorce until 1938. They remained friends for the rest of their lives. He destroyed all the couple&#x27;s pre-1918 correspondence.

Aldington helped T. S. Eliot by persuading Harriet Shaw Weaver to appoint Eliot as Aldington&#x27;s successor at &quot;The Egoist&quot; magazine. In 1919, he introduced Eliot to the editor Bruce Richmond of &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;. Aldington was on the editorial board of Chaman Lall&#x27;s London literary quarterly &quot;Coterie&quot; (published 1919–1921), accompanied by Conrad Aiken, Eliot, Lewis and Aldous Huxley. Eliot had a job in the international department of Lloyds Bank and well-meaning friends wanted him full-time writing poetry. Ezra Pound, plotting a scheme to &quot;get Eliot out of the bank&quot;, was supported by Lady Ottoline Morrell, Leonard Woolf and Harry Norton Aldington began publishing in journals such as the Imagist &quot;The Chapbook&quot;. In reply to Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot;, Aldington wrote &quot;A Fool i&#x27; the Forest&quot; (1924).
Aldington suffered a breakdown in 1925. His interest in poetry waned, and he developed an animosity towards Eliot&#x27;s celebrity. Aldington grew closer to Eliot but gradually became a supporter of Vivienne Eliot in the troubled marriage. Aldington satirised her husband as &quot;Jeremy Cibber&quot; in &quot;Stepping Heavenward&quot; (1931). He had a relationship with writer Valentine Dobrée and a lengthy and passionate affair with Arabella Yorke, a lover since Mecklenburgh Square days, coming to an end when he went abroad.

Aldington helped Irene Rathbone publish her semi-autobiographical novel &quot;We That Were Young&quot; in 1932. They had an affair that ended in 1937. Rathbone dedicated her 1936 novel &quot;They Call it Peace&quot; to him, and she wrote a long poem, &quot;Was There a Summer?: A Narrative Poem&quot;, in 1943 about their relationship.

===Exile===
Aldington went into self-imposed exile in 1928. He lived in Paris for years, living with Brigit Patmore and fascinated by Nancy Cunard, whom he met in 1928. Following his divorce in 1938 he married Netta, née McCullough, previously Brigit&#x27;s daughter-in-law.

&quot;Death of a Hero&quot; (1929), which Aldington called a &quot;jazz novel,&quot; was his semi-autobiographical response to the war. He started writing it almost immediately after the armistice was declared. The novel condemned Victorian materialism as a cause of the tragedy and waste of the war. Rejectionist, an &quot;Expressionist scream&quot;, it was commended by Lawrence Durrell as &quot;the best war novel of the epoch&quot;. It was developed mostly while Aldington was living on the island of Port-Cros in Provence, building on the manuscript from a decade before. Opening with a letter to the playwright Halcott Glover, the book takes a satirical, cynical, and critical stance on Victorian and Edwardian cant. Published in September 1929, by Christmas it had sold more than 10,000 copies in England alone, part of a wave of war remembrances from writers such as Remarque, Sassoon, and Hemingway. The book was quickly translated into German and other European languages. In Russia the book was taken to be a wholesale attack on bourgeois politics, &quot;the inevitable result of the life which had preceded it&quot;, as Aldington wrote. &quot;The next one will be much worse&quot;. It was praised by Gorky as revolutionary, and the book, along with Aldington&#x27;s later fiction, received huge Russian distribution. Aldington was, however, fiercely non-partisan in his politics, despite his passion for iconoclasm and feminism.

The character of George Winterbourne is loosely based on Aldington as an artist (Winterbourne a painter rather than writer), having a mistress before and through the war, and the novel portrays locations strongly resembling those he had travelled to. One of these locations, fictionally named &quot;The Chateau de Fressin,&quot; strongly resembled a castle he wrote about in a letter to H.D.

&quot;Death of a Hero&quot;, like many other novels published around this time about the war, suffered greatly from censorship. Instead of changing or cutting parts of his novel, he replaced objectionable words with asterisks. Although they looked awkward on the page, Aldington, among others, wanted to call attention to censoring by publishers.

In 1930 Aldington published a translation of &quot;The Decameron&quot; and then the romance &quot;All Men are Enemies&quot; (1933). In 1942, having relocated to the United States with his new wife Netta, he began to write biographies, starting with Wellington: &quot;The Duke: Being an Account of the Life &amp; Achievements of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington&quot; (1943). It was followed by works on D. H. Lawrence: &quot;Portrait of a Genius, But ...&quot; (1950), Robert Louis Stevenson: &quot;Portrait of a Rebel&quot; (1957), and T. E. Lawrence: &quot;Lawrence of Arabia: A Biographical Inquiry&quot; (1955). Under financial pressure, he also worked as a Hollywood screenwriter.

Aldington&#x27;s excoriating biography of T. E. Lawrence caused a scandal on its publication in 1955. In the spirit of iconoclasm, he was the first to bring public notice to Lawrence&#x27;s illegitimacy and asserted that he was a homosexual, a liar, a charlatan, an &quot;impudent mythomaniac&quot;, a &quot;self-important egotist&quot;, a poor writer and even a bad motorcyclist. The biography dramatically coloured popular opinion of Lawrence. Foreign and War Office files concerning Lawrence&#x27;s career were released during the 1960s and further biographies continued to analyse the &#x27;British hero&#x27;. Robert Graves, a friend of Lawrence, wrote that &quot;instead of a carefully considered portrait of Lawrence, I find the self-portrait of a bitter, bedridden, leering, asthmatic, elderly hangman-of-letters.&quot; Robert Irwin, in the London Review of Books, speculated that Aldington&#x27;s spite was driven by jealousy and a sense of exclusion by the British establishment. Lawrence had attended Oxford and his father was a baronet; Aldington had suffered in the bloodbath of Europe during the First World War while Lawrence had gained a heroic reputation in the Middle Eastern theatre and became an international celebrity and homosexual icon. Irwin observes that he &quot;was industrious and his portrait of Lawrence was fuelled by careful research&quot;. Christopher Sykes, in his 1969 introduction to the Collins edition (reprinted in Pelican Biographies in 1971), stated that &quot;for the first time, the awkward questions were faced squarely&quot;; Sykes&#x27;s final assessment of Aldington&#x27;s book is that it &quot;cleared the ground of rubbish, efficiently and thoroughly&quot;.

Aldington lived in Sury-en-Vaux, Cher, France, from 1958. His last significant book was a biography of the Provençal poet and winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, Frédéric Mistral (1956).

==Death==
Aldington died in Sury on 27 July 1962, shortly after being honoured in Moscow on the occasion of his 70th birthday and the translation of some of his novels to Russian. He was honored in the Soviet Union, &quot;even if some of the fêting was probably because he had, in his writings, sometimes suggested that the England he loved could, in certain of its aspects, be less than an earthly paradise.&quot;

Aldington is buried in the local cemetery in Sury. He was survived by a daughter, Catherine, the child of his second marriage, who died in 2010.

==Legacy==
On 11 November 1985 Aldington was among 16 Great War poets commemorated in stone at Westminster Abbey&#x27;s Poet&#x27;s Corner. The inscription on the stone was taken from Wilfred Owen&#x27;s &quot;Preface&quot; to his poems and reads: &quot;My subject is War, and the pity of War. The Poetry is in the pity.&quot;

==Style and bitterness==
Alec Waugh described Aldington as having been embittered by the war, but took it that he worked off his spleen in novels like &quot;The Colonel&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1931) rather than letting it poison his life. Douglas Bush describes his work as &quot;a career of disillusioned bitterness.&quot; His novels contained thinly veiled portraits of some of his friends, including Eliot, Lawrence and Pound; the friendship not always surviving. Lyndall Gordon characterises the sketch of Eliot in Aldington&#x27;s memoirs &quot;Life for Life&#x27;s Sake&quot; (1941) as &quot;snide.&quot; As a young man, he was cutting about Yeats, but they remained on good terms.

Aldington&#x27;s obituary in &quot;The Times&quot; of London in 1962 described him as &quot;[a]n angry young man of the generation before they became fashionable ... who remained something of an angry old man to the end&quot;.

<text>Brighton ( ) is a seaside resort in the city of Brighton and Hove, East Sussex, England, south of London.
Archaeological evidence of settlement in the area dates back to the Bronze Age, Roman and Anglo-Saxon periods. The ancient settlement of &quot;Brighthelmstone&quot; was documented in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; (1086). The town&#x27;s importance grew in the Middle Ages as the Old Town developed, but it languished in the early modern period, affected by foreign attacks, storms, a suffering economy and a declining population. Brighton began to attract more visitors following improved road transport to London and becoming a boarding point for boats travelling to France. The town also developed in popularity as a health resort for sea bathing as a purported cure for illnesses.

In the Georgian era, Brighton developed as a highly fashionable seaside resort, encouraged by the patronage of the Prince Regent, later King George IV, who spent much time in the town and constructed the Royal Pavilion in the Regency era. Brighton continued to grow as a major centre of tourism following the arrival of the railways in 1841, becoming a popular destination for day-trippers from London. Many of the major attractions were built in the Victorian era, including the Grand Hotel, the Hilton Brighton Metropole, the Palace Pier and the West Pier. The town continued to grow into the 20th century, expanding to incorporate more areas into the town&#x27;s boundaries before joining Hove to form the unitary authority of Brighton and Hove in 1997, which was granted city status in 2000. Today, Brighton and Hove district has a resident population of about and the wider Brighton and Hove conurbation has a population of 474,485 (2011 census).

Brighton&#x27;s location has made it a popular destination for tourists, renowned for its diverse communities, shopping areas, large and vibrant cultural, music and arts scene, and its large LGBT population, leading to its recognition as the &quot;unofficial gay capital of the UK&quot; and as of the 2021 census, 10.7% of the population of Brighton and Hove over the age of 18 identify as gay, lesbian or bisexual, the highest percentage in the entire UK. Brighton has been called the UK&#x27;s &quot;hippest city&quot; and &quot;the happiest place to live in the UK&quot;.
==Toponymy==
The earliest attestation of Brighton&#x27;s name is &quot;Bristelmestune&quot;, recorded in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot;. Although more than 40 variations have been documented, &quot;Brighthelmstone&quot; (or &quot;Brighthelmston&quot;) was the standard rendering between the 14th and 18th centuries.

&quot;Brighton&quot; was originally an informal shortened form, first seen in 1660; it gradually supplanted the longer name and was in general use from the late 18th century, although &quot;Brighthelmstone&quot; remained the town&#x27;s official name until 1810. The name is of Anglo-Saxon origin. Most scholars believe that it derives from &quot;Beorthelm&quot; + &quot;tūn&quot;—the homestead of Beorthelm, a common Old English name associated with villages elsewhere in England. The &quot;tūn&quot; element is common in Sussex, especially on the coast, although it occurs infrequently in combination with a personal name. An alternative etymology taken from the Old English words for &quot;stony valley&quot; is sometimes given but has less acceptance. &quot;Brighthelm&quot; gives its name to, among other things, a church, a pub in Brighton, some halls of residence at the University of Sussex. Writing in 1950, historian Antony Dale noted that unnamed antiquaries had suggested an Old English word &quot;brist&quot; or &quot;briz&quot;, meaning &quot;divided&quot;, could have contributed the first part of the historic name Brighthelmstone. The town was originally split in half by the Wellesbourne, a winterbourne which was culverted and buried in the 18th century.

Brighton has several nicknames. Poet Horace Smith called it &quot;The Queen of Watering Places&quot;, which is still widely used, and &quot;Old Ocean&#x27;s Bauble&quot;. Novelist William Makepeace Thackeray referred to &quot;Doctor Brighton&quot;, calling the town &quot;one of the best of Physicians&quot;. &quot;London-by-the-Sea&quot; is well-known, reflecting Brighton&#x27;s popularity with Londoners as a day-trip resort, a commuter dormitory and a desirable destination for those wanting to move out of the metropolis. &quot;The Queen of Slaughtering Places&quot;, a pun on Smith&#x27;s description, became popular when the Brighton trunk murders came to the public&#x27;s attention in the 1930s. The mid-19th-century nickname &quot;School Town&quot; referred to the remarkable number of boarding, charity and church schools in the town at the time.

==History==
The first settlement in the Brighton area was Whitehawk Camp, a Neolithic encampment on Whitehawk Hill which has been dated to between 3500 BC and 2700 BC. It is one of six causewayed enclosures in Sussex. Archaeologists have only partially explored it, but have found numerous burial mounds, tools and bones, suggesting it was a place of some importance. There was also a Bronze Age settlement at Coldean. Brythonic Celts arrived in Britain in the 7th century BC, and an important Brythonic settlement existed at Hollingbury Castle on Hollingbury Hill. This Celtic Iron Age encampment dates from the 3rd or 2nd century BC and is circumscribed by substantial earthwork outer walls with a diameter of . Cissbury Ring, roughly from Hollingbury, is suggested to have been the tribal &quot;capital&quot;.

Later, there was a Roman villa at Preston Village, a Roman road from London ran nearby, and much physical evidence of Roman occupation has been discovered locally. From the 1st century AD, the Romans built a number of villas in Brighton and Romano-British Brythonic Celts formed farming settlements in the area. After the Romans left in the early 4th century AD, the Brighton area returned to the control of the native Celts. Anglo-Saxons then invaded in the late 5th century AD, and the region became part of the Kingdom of Sussex, founded in 477 AD by king Ælle.

Anthony Seldon identified five phases of development in pre-20th century Brighton. The village of &quot;Bristelmestune&quot; was founded by these Anglo-Saxon invaders, probably in the early Saxon period. They were attracted by the easy access for boats, sheltered areas of raised land for building and better conditions compared to the damp, cold and misty Weald to the north. By the time of the Domesday survey in 1086 it was a fishing and agricultural settlement, a rent of 4,000 herring was established, and its population was about 400. By the 14th century there was a parish church, a market and rudimentary law enforcement (the first town constable was elected in 1285). Sacked and burnt by French invaders in the early 16th century—the earliest depiction of Brighton, a painting of 1520, shows Admiral Pregent de Bidoux&#x27;s attack of June 1514—the town recovered strongly based on a thriving mackerel-fishing industry. The grid of streets in the Old Town (the present Lanes area) were well developed and the town grew quickly: the population rose from 1,500 in 1600 to 4,000 in the 1640s. By that time Brighton was Sussex&#x27;s most populous and important town.

Over the next few decades, though, events severely affected its local and national standing, such that by 1730 &quot;it was a forlorn town decidedly down on its luck&quot;. More foreign attacks, storms (especially the devastating Great Storm of 1703), a declining fishing industry, and the emergence of nearby Shoreham as a significant port caused its economy to suffer. By 1708 other parishes in Sussex were charged rates to alleviate poverty in Brighton, and Daniel Defoe wrote that the expected £8,000 cost of providing sea defences was &quot;more than the whole town was worth&quot;. The population declined to 2,000 in the early 18th century.

From the 1730s, Brighton entered its second phase of development—one which brought a rapid improvement in its fortunes. The contemporary fad for drinking and bathing in seawater as a purported cure for illnesses was enthusiastically encouraged by Richard Russell from nearby Lewes. He sent many patients to &quot;take the cure&quot; in the sea at Brighton, published a popular treatise on the subject, and moved to the town soon afterwards (the Royal Albion, one of Brighton&#x27;s early hotels, occupies the site of his house). Others were already visiting the town for recreational purposes before Russell became famous, and his actions coincided with other developments which made Brighton more attractive to visitors. From the 1760s it was a boarding point for boats travelling to France; road transport to London was improved when the main road via Crawley was turnpiked in 1770; and spas and indoor baths were opened by other entrepreneurial physicians such as Sake Dean Mahomed and Anthony Relhan (who also wrote the town&#x27;s first guidebook).

From 1780, the development of the Georgian terraces had started, and the fishing village developed as the fashionable resort of Brighton. The growth of the town was further encouraged by the patronage of the Prince Regent (later King George IV) after his first visit in 1783. He spent much of his leisure time in the town and constructed the Royal Pavilion during the early part of his Regency. In this period the modern form of the name Brighton came into common use. A permanent military presence was established in the city with the completion of Preston Barracks in 1793. It was rebuilt in 1830.
The population increased rapidly throughout the 19th century from 7,339 in 1801 to 46,661 in 1841, and by 1901 the population had reached more than 120,000. The arrival of the London and Brighton Railway in 1841 brought Brighton within the reach of day-trippers from London. Many of the major attractions were built during the Victorian era, such as the Grand Hotel (1864), the West Pier (1866), and the Palace Pier (1899). Prior to either of these structures, the famous Royal Suspension Chain Pier was built, to the designs of Captain Samuel Brown. It lasted from 1823 to 1896 and is featured in paintings by both Turner and Constable.

Due to the boundary changes, the land area of Brighton expanded from 1,640 acres (7 km2) in 1854 to 14,347 acres (58 km2) in 1952. New housing estates were established in the acquired areas, including Moulsecoomb, Bevendean, Coldean and Whitehawk. The major expansion of 1928 also incorporated the villages of Patcham, Ovingdean and Rottingdean, and much council housing was built in parts of Woodingdean after the Second World War. By the 1970s, the town had acquired a reputation as a retirement destination, with an elderly population. However, this was reversed in the 1990s, as Brighton regained the fashionable status it held in the 18th and 19th centuries.

In 1997, the town of Brighton and its neighbouring town Hove were joined to form the unitary authority of Brighton and Hove, which was granted city status by Queen Elizabeth II as part of the millennium celebrations in 2000.

==Demography==
, the Brighton and Hove district, of which Brighton is the largest area, has an estimated resident population of residents. It is ranked the most populous district in England. Compared to the national average, Brighton has fewer children and old residents but a large proportion of adults aged 20–44.

Brighton has long had an LGBT-friendly history. In a 2014 estimate, 11–15 per cent of the city&#x27;s population aged 16 or over is thought to be lesbian, gay or bisexual. The city also had the highest percentage of same-sex households in the UK in 2004 and the largest number of civil partnership registrations outside London in 2013.

===Religion===
Brighton is identified as one of the least religious places in the UK, based upon analysis of the 2011 census which revealed that 42 per cent of the population profess no religion, far higher than the national average of 25 per cent. Brighton has been described as the UK&#x27;s most &quot;Godless&quot; city. The largest religion is Christianity, with 43 per cent reporting an affiliation. The second-largest religion is Islam, with 2.2 per cent, which is lower than the national average.

As part of the Jedi census phenomenon in 2001, 2.6 per cent claimed their religion was &#x27;Jedi Knight&#x27;, the largest percentage in the country.

===Homelessness===

In December 2021, new data released by Shelter, revealed that &quot;one in 78 people in Brighton and Hove are homeless&quot;. The report also records the city as having the third highest rate of homelessness in England, with London claiming the top spot followed by Luton. 
In a previous charity report issued in November 2016, three areas in Brighton &amp; Hove, East Brighton, Queen&#x27;s Park, and Moulsecoomb &amp; Bevendean ranked in the top ten per cent nationally for deprivation.
Although deprivation in Brighton is distributed across the city, it is more concentrated in some areas. The highest concentration is in the Whitehawk, Moulsecoomb, and Hollingbury areas but is also found around the St. James&#x27;s Street and Eastern Road areas. A 2015 government statistic showed that the area around Brighton&#x27;s Palace Pier roundabout and to the east towards St James&#x27;s Street in Kemptown is the seventh-worst living environment in England. On 19 January 2017, Brighton council announced they were looking at certain initiatives to try to alleviate some of the increasing homelessness seen on Brighton&#x27;s streets and were hoping to open the first in-house temporary housing for homeless people in the city. 
Homelessness figures released by Crisis in December 2018 reported a record high in the UK, with figures in Sussex, including Brighton and Hove, reported as being &quot;high&quot;.

At a meeting of the full B&amp;H Council on 25 March 2021, Brighton and Hove became the first UK City to adopt the Homeless Bill of Rights.
The bill was passed by 31 votes to 11, with 7 abstentions.

==Geography==

Brighton lies between the South Downs and the English Channel to the north and south, respectively. The Sussex coast forms a wide, shallow bay between the headlands of Selsey Bill and Beachy Head; Brighton developed near the centre of this bay around a seasonal river, the Wellesbourne (or Whalesbone), which flowed from the South Downs above Patcham. This emptied into the English Channel at the beach near the East Cliff, forming &quot;the natural drainage point for Brighton&quot;.

Behind the estuary was a stagnant pond called the Pool or Poole, so named since the medieval era. This was built over with houses and shops from 1793, when the Wellesbourne was culverted to prevent flooding, and only the name of the road (Pool Valley, originally Pool Lane) marks its site. One original house survives from the time of the pool&#x27;s enclosure. Behind Pool Valley is Old Steine (historically &quot;The Steyne&quot;), originally a flat and marshy area where fishermen dried their nets. The Wellesbourne occasionally reappears during times of prolonged heavy rain; author Mark Antony Lower referred to an early 19th-century drawing of the Royal Pavilion showing &quot;quite a pool of water across the Steyne&quot;.

Despite 16th-century writer Andrew Boorde&#x27;s claim that &quot;Bryght-Hempston [is] among the noble ports and havens of the realm&quot;, Brighton never developed as a significant port: rather, it was considered as part of Shoreham. Nevertheless, the descriptions &quot;Port of Brighthelmston&quot; or &quot;Port of Brighton&quot; were sometimes used between the 14th and 19th centuries, as for example in 1766 when its notional limits were defined for customs purposes.

The East Cliff runs for several miles from Pool Valley towards Rottingdean and Saltdean, reaching above sea level. The soil beneath it, a mixture of alluvium and clay with some flint and chalk rubble, has experienced erosion for many years. The cliff itself, like the rest of Brighton&#x27;s soil, is chalk. Below this are thin layers of Upper and Lower Greensand separated by a thicker band of Gault clay. The land slopes upwards gradually from south to north towards the top of the Downs.

Main transport links developed along the floor of the Wellesbourne valley, from which the land climbs steeply—particularly on the east side. The earliest settlement was by the beach at the bottom of the valley, which was partly protected from erosion by an underwater sandbar. Changes in sea level affected the foreshore several times: disappeared in the first half of the 14th century, and the Great Storm of 1703 caused widespread destruction. The first sea defences were erected in 1723, and a century later a long sea wall was built.

===Climate===

Brighton has a temperate climate: its Köppen climate classification is &quot;Cfb&quot;. It is characterised by cool summers and cool winters with frequent cloudy and rainy periods. Average rainfall levels increase as the land rises: the 1958–1990 mean was on the seafront and about at the top of the South Downs above Brighton. Storms caused serious damage in 1703, 1806, 1824, 1836, 1848, 1850, 1896, 1910 and 1987. Heavy snow is rare, but particularly severe falls were recorded in 1881 and 1967.

===Boundaries and areas===

At the time of the Domesday survey in 1086, Brighton was in the Rape of Lewes and the Hundred of Welesmere. The new Hundred of Whalesbone, which covered the parishes of Brighton, West Blatchington, Preston and Hove, was formed in 1296. Parishes moved in and out several times, and by 1801 only Brighton and West Blatchington were included in the Hundred.

In its original form, Brighton parish covered about between the English Channel, Hove, Preston, Ovingdean and Rottingdean. The borough (but not the civil parish) was first extended from 31 October 1873, when was annexed from Preston civil parish. In 1894 the part outside the borough became Preston Rural civil parish and Preston civil parish continued in the borough. On 1 April 1889 Brighton became a county borough.

On 1 October 1923, were added to Brighton borough and to Preston civil parish from Patcham parish: Brighton Corporation was developing the Moulsecoomb estate there at the time. On 1 April 1928, Brighton civil parish was extended to include Preston civil parish. On the same date the borough grew by nearly five times by adding Ovingdean and Rottingdean parishes in their entirety and parts of Falmer, Patcham and West Blatchington; it also exchanged small parts with Hove municipal borough. All the areas added to the borough became part of Brighton civil parish. From 1 April 1952, more of Falmer and part of the adjacent Stanmer parish were added; 20 years later, land and marine territory associated with the new Brighton Marina development also became part of Brighton. Except for a small addition of rural land in 1993 (from Pyecombe parish), Brighton Borough&#x27;s boundaries remained the same until it was joined to Hove Borough in 1997 to form the unitary authority of Brighton and Hove.

The old boundary between Brighton and Hove is most clearly seen on the seafront, where the King Edward Peace Statue (1912) straddles the border, and in a twitten called Boundary Passage which runs northwards from Western Road to Montpelier Place. There is a Grade II-listed parish boundary marker stone in this passageway. Between Western Road and the seafront, the boundary runs up Little Western Street (pavement on eastern side, in Brighton), but it is not visible. Northwards from Western Road, it runs to the west of Norfolk Road, Norfolk Terrace, Windlesham Road and Windlesham Gardens in the Montpelier area, then along the south side of Davigdor Road to Seven Dials. From there it runs along the west side of Dyke Road as far as Withdean Road in Withdean, at which point it crosses Dyke Road so that the section north of that is part of Hove parish. The boundary continues to follow Dyke Road towards Devil&#x27;s Dyke on the South Downs.

==Governance and politics==

Brighton is covered by two constituencies in the Parliament of the United Kingdom: Brighton Kemptown and Peacehaven and Brighton Pavilion. In the 2024 general election, Brighton Kemptown elected Chris Ward, Labour; Brighton Pavilion elected Siân Berry, Green Party.

There are 21 wards in the city of Brighton and Hove, of which 12 are in Brighton. Regency, St Peter&#x27;s &amp; North Laine, Preston Park, Withdean, Patcham, Hollingdean &amp; Stanmer and Hanover &amp; Elm Grove are part of the Brighton Pavilion constituency; Moulsecoomb &amp; Bevendean, Queen&#x27;s Park, East Brighton, Woodingdean and Rottingdean Coastal are covered by the Brighton Kemptown constituency.

The newly created Borough of Brighton consisted of six wards in 1854: St Nicholas, St Peter, Pier, Park, Pavilion and West. When the territory was extended to include part of Preston parish in 1873, the new area became a seventh ward named Preston. The seven were split into 14 in 1894: Hanover, Kemp Town (renamed King&#x27;s Cliff in 1908), Lewes Road, Montpelier, Pavilion, Pier, Preston, Preston Park, Queen&#x27;s Park, Regency, St John, St Nicholas, St Peter, and West. Preston ward was extended in 1923 to incorporate the area taken into the borough from Patcham parish in 1923 for the construction of the Moulsecoomb estate, and in 1928 the ward was divided into four: Hollingbury, Moulsecoomb, Preston and Preston Park. Elm Grove and Patcham wards were created at the same time, bringing the total to 19. There were further changes in 1952, 1955 and 1983, at which time there were 16 wards. This situation continued until 1 April 1997, when Hove and its wards became part of the new unitary authority of Brighton and Hove.
Brighton Town Hall occupies a large site in the Lanes. Medieval Brighthelmston had a town hall, although it was called the Townhouse and functioned more like a market hall. A later building (1727) known as the Town Hall was principally used as a workhouse. Work on the first purpose-built town hall began in 1830; Thomas Read Kemp laid the first stone, and Thomas Cooper designed it on behalf of the Brighton Town Commissioners (of which he was a member). Brighton Corporation spent £40,000 to extend it in 1897–99 to the Classical design of Brighton Borough Surveyor Francis May. Despite this, the building was too small for municipal requirements by the mid-20th century, and extra council buildings were built in locations throughout Brighton Borough Council&#x27;s existence: the most recent, Bartholomew House and Priory House next to the town hall, were finished in 1987. The town hall ceased to be responsible solely for Brighton&#x27;s affairs when Brighton and Hove were united in 1997, but it is still used by Brighton &amp; Hove City Council—particularly for weddings and civil partnerships.

The presence of a British subsidiary of the United States arms company EDO Corporation on the Home Farm Industrial Estate in Moulsecoomb has been the cause of protests since 2004. The premises were significantly damaged in January 2009 when protesters broke in.

==Economy==
In 1985, the Borough Council described three &quot;myths&quot; about Brighton&#x27;s economy. Common beliefs were that most of the working population commuted to London every day; that tourism provided most of Brighton&#x27;s jobs and income; or that the borough&#x27;s residents were &quot;composed entirely of wealthy theatricals and retired business people&quot; rather than workers. Brighton has been an important centre for commerce and employment since the 18th century. It is home to several major companies, some of which employ thousands of people locally; as a retail centre it is of regional importance; creative, digital and new media businesses are increasingly significant; and, although Brighton was never a major industrial centre, its railway works contributed to Britain&#x27;s rail industry in the 19th and 20th centuries, particularly in the manufacture of steam locomotives.

Since the amalgamation of Brighton and Hove, economic and retail data has been produced at a citywide level only. Examples of statistics include: Brighton and Hove&#x27;s tourism industry contributes £380m to the economy and employs 20,000 people directly or indirectly; the city has 9,600 registered companies; and a 2001 report identified it as one of five &quot;supercities for the future&quot;. In the past couple of years tourists to Brighton and Hove have fallen in numbers. Over 2016, day visitors to Brighton and Hove dropped by an average of 2,400 per day. In August 2017, new figures for the year showed Brighton&#x27;s tourism had fallen by a further 1 per cent on the previous year.

===Commerce and industry===
Brighton&#x27;s largest private sector employer is American Express, whose European headquarters are at John Street. As of 2012, about 3,000 people work there. Planning permission to demolish the old Amex offices and build a replacement was granted in 2009, and work started in March 2010. Other major employers include Lloyds Bank, Legal &amp; General, Asda (which has hypermarkets at Hollingbury and Brighton Marina), Brighton &amp; Hove Bus and Coach Company and call-centre operator Inkfish. In 2012, it was reported that about 1,500 of Gatwick Airport&#x27;s 21,000 workers lived in the city of Brighton and Hove.

Brighton is a popular destination for conferences, exhibitions and trade fairs, and has had a purpose-built conference centre—the Brighton Centre—since 1977. Direct income from the Brighton Centre&#x27;s 160 events per year is £8 million, and a further £50 million is generated indirectly by visitors spending money during their stay. Events range from political party conferences to concerts.

The Hollingbury Industrial Estate is one of the largest such facilities in Brighton; in its early days about 6,000 people were employed, principally in industrial jobs, but in the late 20th and early 21st centuries its focus has switched to commercial and retail development, limiting Brighton&#x27;s potential for industrial growth. Brighton Corporation laid out the estate on of land around Crowhurst Road in 1950. By 1956, large-scale employment was provided at a bakery, a typewriter factory and a machine tools manufacturer among others. Most of the large factories closed during the recessions of the 1980s and 1990s, employment fell to 1,000, and structural changes started in the mid-1980s with a move towards small-scale industrial units (the Enterprise Estate was finished in October 1985) and then retail warehouses. Asda&#x27;s superstore opened in November 1987, MFI followed two years later, and other retail units were built in the 1990s. Two large headquarters buildings were vacated in quick succession when British Bookshops left in March 2011 and &quot;The Argus&quot; newspaper moved out of its headquarters in 2012—although the Brighton &amp; Hove Bus and Coach Company signed a contract to move its 1,250 employees into the latter building.

Brighton has a high density of businesses involved in the media sector, particularly digital or &quot;new media&quot;, and since the 1990s has been referred to as &quot;Silicon Beach&quot;. By 2007, over 250 new media business had been founded in Brighton. Brandwatch is a social media monitoring company based in offices near Brighton station. Computer game design company Black Rock Studio was founded in 1998 and was taken over by Disney Interactive Studios, who closed it down in 2011. The Gamer Network, whose portfolio of websites relating to computer gaming (including Eurogamer) and creative industries was founded in 1999, is based in Brighton.

By the early 21st century, the market for office accommodation in the city was characterised by fluctuating demand and a lack of supply of high-quality buildings. As an example, the Trafalgar Place development ( 1990), &quot;now considered a prime office location&quot;, stood partly empty for a decade. Exion 27 (built in 2001), a high-tech, energy-efficient office development at Hollingbury, remained empty for several years and is still not in commercial use: it houses some administrative departments of the University of Brighton. It was Brighton&#x27;s first ultramodern commercial property and was intended for mixed commercial and industrial use, but its completion coincided with a slump in demand for high-tech premises.

===Retail and shopping===
Brighton is well known for its high number of independent shops, which add to the character of the city.

Walking from Brighton station towards the seafront, first, is the North Laine area, stretching from Trafalgar Street, Kensington Gardens, Sydney Street, Gardner Street and Bond Street and is mostly pedestrianised. It is a retail, leisure and the residential area immediately north of the Lanes. Its name derives from the Anglo-Saxon &quot;Laine&quot; meaning &quot;fields&quot;, although the misnomer &quot;North Lanes&quot; is often used to describe the area. The North Laine contains a mix of businesses dominated by cafés, bars, theatres, and over 400 shops independent and avant-garde shops including an erotic shop and indoor flea markets.
The Lanes which is characterised by a labyrinth of narrow alleyways form a retail, leisure and residential area near the seafront, following the street pattern of the original fishing village. The Lanes contain predominantly clothing stores, jewellers, antique shops, restaurants and pubs.

Churchill Square is a shopping centre with a floor space of and over 80 shops, several restaurants and 1,600 car-parking spaces. It was built in the 1960s as an open-air, multi-level pedestrianised shopping centre, but was rebuilt and enlarged in 1998 and is no longer open-air. Further retail areas include Western Road and London Road, the latter of which is undergoing extensive regeneration in the form of new housing and commercial properties.

There are two weekly flea market / bootfairs in Brighton on Sunday mornings, one at Brighton Marina on the top open-air level of the carpark, and another at Brighton Racecourse.

==Landmarks==

The Royal Pavilion, a Grade I listed building, is a former royal palace built as a home for the Prince Regent during the early 19th century, under the direction of the architect John Nash. It is notable for its Indo-Saracenic architecture and Oriental interior. Other Indo-Saracenic buildings in Brighton include the Sassoon Mausoleum, now, with the bodies reburied elsewhere, in use as a chic supper club.

The first of Brighton&#x27;s three piers was the Chain Pier, which was destroyed in a storm in 1896. All that remains of the pier are small lumps of wood and stone, which are only visible at low tide. It was primarily intended as a landing stage for packet boats to Dieppe, France, but it also featured a small number of attractions including a camera obscura.

Brighton Marine Palace and Pier (long known as the Palace Pier) opened in 1899, it was meant to be a replacement for the Chain Pier, but became a pleasure pier instead. It features a funfair, restaurants and arcade halls. The West Pier was built in 1866 and is one of only two Grade I listed piers in the United Kingdom; it has been closed since 1975. For some time it was under consideration for restoration, but two fires in 2003, and other setbacks, led to these plans being abandoned. Nevertheless, publicity material presented in question-and-answer form during the building of the Brighton i360 observation tower (see below) maintained that the building of the tower would not prove prejudicial to the eventual restoration of the pier.

The Brighton i360, an observation tower located at the shore end of the West Pier, opened on 4 August 2016. At high, with a spacious glass viewing pod rising to , it is Britain&#x27;s highest observation tower outside London – taller even than the London Eye. With a diameter of , it is also the thinnest tower in the world, with a height-to-width ratio of 41.15 to one.

Brighton Clock Tower, built in 1888 for Queen Victoria&#x27;s jubilee, stands at the intersection of Brighton&#x27;s busiest thoroughfares.

Volk&#x27;s Electric Railway runs along the inland edge of the beach from Palace Pier to Black Rock and Brighton Marina. It was created in 1883 and is the world&#x27;s oldest operating electric railway.

The Grand Hotel was built in 1864. The Brighton hotel bombing occurred there. Its nighttime blue lighting is particularly prominent along the foreshore.

===Churches and other places of worship===
St Nicholas Church may be the oldest building in Brighton (the Domesday Book records the presence of an Anglo-Saxon church, valued at £12) and is commonly known as &quot;The Mother Church&quot;. Other notable Anglican churches include the very tall (the highest church interior in Britain) brick-built St Bartholomew&#x27;s (1874) designed by the architect Edmund Scott; St Peter&#x27;s (1828); and St Martin&#x27;s (1875), noted for its ornate interior. Brighton&#x27;s Quakers run the Friends Meeting House in the Lanes. There is an active Unitarian community based in a Grade II listed building in New Road. Brighton has six listed Roman Catholic churches; St John the Baptist&#x27;s Church (1835) in Kemptown is the earliest surviving Roman Catholic church in the city.

Brighton and Hove has five synagogues: New Church Road Synagogue; Holland Road Synagogue; Brighton and Hove Progressive Synagogue; Brighton and Hove Reform Synagogue; and Middle Street Synagogue. The Middle Street Synagogue is a Grade II listed building built in 1874–75; it is being gradually restored by English Heritage. There are also several mosques and Buddhist centres.

===Beaches===
Brighton has a expanse of shingle beach, part of the unbroken section within the city limits. A flat sandy foreshore is exposed at low tide. The seafront is home to many restaurants, sports facilities, amusement arcades, nightclubs and bars. At Black Rock, to the east of Brighton, a vegetated shingle wildlife habitat has been created. A 600m long boardwalk runs through the wildlife site. The Palace Pier section of the beach has been awarded blue flag status.

The city council owns all the beaches, which are divided into named sections by groynes—the first of which were completed in 1724. Eastwards from the Hove boundary, the names are Boundary, Norfolk, Bedford, Metropole, Grand (referring to the four hotels with those names), Centre, King&#x27;s, Old Ship, Volk&#x27;s, Albion, Palace Pier, Aquarium, Athina (where the MS &quot;Athina B&quot; ran aground), Paston, Banjo, Duke&#x27;s, Cliff, Crescent and Black Rock. Cliff Beach is a nudist beach. Beyond Black Rock, the cliffs (part of the Brighton to Newhaven Cliffs Site of Special Scientific Interest) rise to more than and there are three small beaches at Ovingdean Gap, Rottingdean Gap and Saltdean Gap. All are connected by the Undercliff Walk, which has been affected by several cliff falls since 2000.

Part of the beach adjoining Madeira Drive, to the east of the city centre, was redeveloped opened to the public in March 2007, with a playground, mini-golf, beach saunas and beach volleyball courts.

On the sea wall of Madeira Drive is Madeira Terrace, a Grade 2* listed, 865-metre-long stretch of seafront arches. The Terrace structure has degraded, deemed unsafe, and been closed to the public since 2014. The Terrace is being restored, with a number of plans submitted. In front of the Terrace has been built a new national outdoor swimming centre, including a 50m swimming pool with an adjoining complex of shops, and bars.

Since the demolition in 1978 of the Black Rock open-air lido at the eastern end of Brighton&#x27;s seafront, the area has been developed and now features one of Europe&#x27;s largest marinas. However, the site of the pool itself remains empty except for a skate park and graffiti wall. Since 2003 a series of developments have been proposed including housing, a five-star hotel with a winter garden, and an 11,000-seat sports arena.

===Liz Williams Butterfly Haven===

The Liz Williams Butterfly haven () is a purpose-built area that has been created to attract and provide a habitat for butterflies. It is situated between Dorothy Stringer and Varndean College, north of Stringer Way. It was the brainchild of Dan Danahar with funding from the BBC, in conjunction with the National Lottery, through the Breathing Places scheme. This site was created between 2006 and 2007, and by September 2008 the late Liz Williams, botanist, had recorded 97 wildflower species and 10 species of grass. This was an order of magnitude increase in the floral diversity of the site within one year. As a tribute to her work, the site has been renamed the Liz Williams Butterfly Haven in 2011. Since its creation up to 2021 twenty-seven species of butterfly have been recorded here including Adonis blue, chalkhill blue, green hairstreak, dingy and chequered skipper.

===The Woodvale Cemeteries===

Woodvale () is actually five linked cemeteries that cover the western side of Race Hill. The cemeteries are east of Lewes Road and either side of Bear Road. Their cultural significance and importance to wildlife to the city were described evocatively by the Sussex field naturalist, David Bangs (p. 303).&quot;They are a profoundly peaceful place of little woods and glades, sunny banks and shady paths. They have become, in the last 150 years, reservoirs for much of the wildlife of the surrounding countryside. Some of the big beech trees down in Woodvale are as old as the cemeteries. The marbles, limestones, and granites of the memorials are a detective story for geologists. Yaffles call across the trees. The rare greater horseshoe bat has hibernated in the funerary buildings. Badgers pit the mossy turf in their search for earthworms, and violet and celandine cheer the turf in early spring.&quot;

Motoring events take place on Madeira Drive, a piece of roadway on Brighton&#x27;s seafront, throughout the year. It was originally constructed to host what is commonly held to be the world&#x27;s oldest motor race, the Brighton Speed Trials, which has been running since 1905. The event is organised by the Brighton and Hove Motor Club and normally takes place on the second Saturday in September each year.

Brighton has a horse racing course, Brighton Racecourse, with the unusual feature that when the full length of the course is to be used, some of the grass turf of the track has to be laid over the tarmac at the top of Wilson Avenue, a public road, which therefore has to be closed for the races. A greyhound racing circuit – the Brighton &amp; Hove Greyhound Stadium – in Hove is run by Coral, at which motorcycle speedway racing was staged in 1928.

Brighton Sailing Club has been operating since the 1870s.

The Brighton and Hove Pétanque Club runs an annual triples, doubles and singles competition, informal KOs, winter and summer league, plus Open competitions with other clubs. The club is affiliated to Sussex Pétanque, the local region of the English Pétanque Association, so they can also play at a Regional and National level. The Peace Statue terrain is the official pétanque terrain situated on the seafront near the West Pier.

Brighton has two competitive swimming clubs: Brighton SC, formed in 1860, claims to be the oldest swimming club in England; and Brighton Dolphin SC was formed in 1891 as Brighton Ladies Swimming. Casual sea swimming is also a popular activity in Brighton, rising in popularity since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Amateur track cycling is held at the Preston Park Velodrome, the oldest velodrome in the UK, built in 1877.

There are three recognised surfing breaks close to Brighton, including East of the Marina, by the West Pier and at Shoreham harbour.

==Transport==

Brighton has several railway stations, many bus routes, coach services and taxis. A Rapid Transport System has been under consideration for some years. Trolleybuses, trams, ferries and hydrofoil services have operated in the past.

===Roads===
Brighton is connected to the trunk road network by the A23 (London Road) northwards, and by two east–west routes: the A259 along the coast and the A27 trunk route inland which joins the M27 motorway near Portsmouth. The A23 joins the M23 motorway at Pease Pottage near Gatwick Airport. The A27 originally ran through the urban area along Old Shoreham Road and Lewes Road, but it now follows the route of the Brighton Bypass (final section opened in 1992) and the old alignment has become the A270. A bypass was first proposed in 1932, six routes were submitted for approval in 1973, and the Department of the Environment published its recommended route in 1980. Public inquiries took place in 1983 and 1987, construction started in 1989 and the first section—between London Road at Patcham and the road to Devil&#x27;s Dyke—opened in summer 1991.

By 1985, there were about 5,000 parking spaces in central Brighton. The largest car parks are at London Road, King Street and the Churchill Square/Regency Road/Russell Road complex. In 1969, a 520-space multi-storey car park was built beneath the central gardens of Regency Square.

===Railway===
Frequent trains operate from Brighton railway station. Many Brighton residents commute to work in London and destinations include , and . Most trains serve and those operated by Thameslink continue to , , , and . The fastest service from London Victoria takes 51 minutes. The West Coastway Line serves stations to Portsmouth, and Southampton; the East Coastway Line runs via Lewes to Newhaven, Eastbourne, and Hastings, crossing the landmark London Road viaduct en route and providing &quot;a dramatic high-level view&quot; of Brighton. A wider range of long-distance destinations was served until 2007–08 when rationalisation caused the ending of InterCity services via and to Birmingham, Manchester and Edinburgh.

===Buses===
Until deregulation in 1986, bus services in Brighton were provided by Southdown Motor Services and Brighton Borough Transport under a joint arrangement called &quot;Brighton Area Transport Services&quot;. Southdown were part of the nationalised NBC group and were based at Freshfield Road in the Kemptown area; Brighton Borough Transport were owned by the council and used the former tram depot at Lewes Road as their headquarters. Joint tickets were available and revenue was shared. The Brighton &amp; Hove Bus Company, owned by the Go-Ahead Group since 1993, now runs most bus services in Brighton. It has a fleet of about 280 buses. Compass Travel, The Big Lemon, Metrobus, Stagecoach South operate services to central Brighton. The city had 1,184 bus stops in 2012, 456 of which had a shelter. Real-time travel information displays are provided at many stops.
The only park and ride facility in Brighton is based at the Withdean Stadium. It does not offer a dedicated shuttle bus service: intending passengers must join the Brighton &amp; Hove Bus Company&#x27;s route 27 service to Saltdean—which travels via Brighton railway station, the Clock Tower and Old Steine—and pay standard fares. The 20-year City Plan released in January 2013 ruled out an official park-and-ride facility, stating it would be an &quot;inefficient use of public money, particularly in an era of declining car use&quot;. Councillors and residents in Woodingdean and Rottingdean have claimed that streets and car parks in those areas have become unofficial park-and-ride sites: drivers park for free and take buses into the city centre.

===Air===
Shoreham Airport, which offers chartered and scheduled flights using light aircraft, is west of Brighton near the town of Shoreham-by-Sea. In 1971, the borough councils of Worthing, Hove and Brighton bought it and operated it jointly as a municipal airport, but since 2006 it has been privately owned. Gatwick Airport, one of Britain&#x27;s major international airports, is north on the A23; regular coach and rail services operate from Brighton.

<doc id="49797" wikidata="Q152788" url="?curid=49797" title="Emil Nolde">
<text>Emil Nolde (born Hans Emil Hansen; 7 August 1867 – 13 April 1956) was a German-Danish painter and printmaker. He was one of the first Expressionists, a member of Die Brücke, and was one of the first oil painting and watercolor painters of the early 20th century to explore color. He is known for his brushwork and expressive choice of colors. Golden yellows and deep reds appear frequently in his work, giving a luminous quality to otherwise somber tones. His watercolors include vivid, brooding storm-scapes and brilliant florals.

Nolde&#x27;s intense preoccupation with the subject of flowers reflected his interest in the art of Vincent van Gogh.

Even though his art was included in the &quot;Entartete Kunst&quot; exhibition of 1937, Nolde was a racist, anti-semite and a staunch supporter of Nazi Germany.

==Early life==
Emil Nolde was born as Hans Emil Hansen, near the village of Nolde (since 1920 part of the municipality of Burkal in Southern Jutland, Denmark), in the Prussian Duchy of Schleswig. He grew up on a farm. His parents, devout Protestants, were Danish and Frisian peasants. He realized his unsuitability for farm life, and that he and his three brothers were not at all alike. 

Between 1884 and 1891, he studied to become a woodcarver and illustrator in Flensburg, and worked in furniture factories as a young adult. He spent his years of travel in Munich, Karlsruhe and Berlin.In 1889, he gained entrance into the School of Applied Arts in Karlsruhe. He was a drawing instructor at the school of the Museum of Industrial and Applied Arts (&quot;Industrie- und Gewerbemuseum&quot;; today the &quot;Textilmuseum&quot;, or Textile Museum) in St. Gallen, Switzerland, from 1892 to 1898. He eventually left this job to finally pursue his dream of becoming an independent artist. 

==Career==
As a child, he had loved to paint and draw; however, he was already 31 by the time he pursued this new career. When he was rejected by the Munich Academy of Fine Arts in 1898, he spent the next three years taking private painting classes, visiting Paris, and becoming familiar with the contemporary impressionist scene that was popular at this time. He married Danish actress Ada Vilstrup in 1902, and moved to Berlin, where he would meet collector Gustav Schiefler and artist Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, both of whom would advocate his work later in life. From that year, he named himself after his birthplace.

He became a member of the revolutionary expressionist group Die Brücke (The Bridge), of Dresden, in 1906, upon the group&#x27;s invitation. This association lasted only until the end of the following year. He was a member of the Berlin Secession from 1908 to 1910, but was then excluded owing to a disagreement with the leadership. In Berlin, Nolde was strongly influenced by the collections of the Völkerkundemuseum in what was then Königgrätzer Straße, which he visited repeatedly and where he made over 120 drawings of exhibits from the Global South. His studies resulted in works such as &quot;Man, Woman and Cat&quot; (1912), in which Nolde depicted King Njoya&#x27;s throne “Mandu Yenu”, which came to Germany from Cameroon under controversial circumstances, only slightly altered. He exhibited with Wassily Kandinsky&#x27;s Munich-based group Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider) in 1912; by this time he had achieved some fame, and was able to support himself through his art.

==Politics==
Nolde was a supporter of the National Socialist German Workers&#x27; Party from the early 1920s, having become a member of its Danish section. He expressed anti-semitic, negative opinions about Jewish artists, and considered Expressionism to be a distinctively Germanic style. This view was shared by some other members of the Nazi party, notably Joseph Goebbels and Fritz Hippler.

==Degenerate art==
However, Adolf Hitler rejected all forms of modernism as &quot;degenerate art&quot;; the Nazi regime officially condemned Nolde&#x27;s work. Until that time, he had been held in great esteem in Germany. A total of 1,052 of his works were removed from museums, more than those of any other artist. Some were included in the &quot;Entartete Kunst&quot; exhibition of 1937, despite his protests, including (later) a personal appeal to Nazi &quot;Gauleiter&quot; Baldur von Schirach in Vienna. He was not allowed to paint—even in private—after 1941. Nevertheless, during this period he created hundreds of watercolors, which he hid. He called them the &quot;Unpainted Pictures&quot;.

In 1942, Nolde wrote:
There is silver blue, sky blue and thunder blue. Every color holds within it a soul, which makes me happy or repels me, and which acts as a stimulus. To a person who has no art in him, colors are colors, tones tones...and that is all. All their consequences for the human spirit, which range between heaven to hell, just go unnoticed.
==Post war==
After World War II, Nolde was once again honoured, receiving the Pour le Mérite.

While acknowledging his success as a brilliant colourist, greater awareness of Nolde&#x27;s commitment to Nazism and a discussion of the relationship between his politics, denunciation of non-Jewish adversaries as Jews, and his art is considered in more recent scholarship. A recent exhibition (&quot;Emile Nolde: A German Legend, The Artist during the Nazi Regime,&quot; Berlin National Gallery, 2019) examined Nolde&#x27;s self-professed Nazi leanings, and the tendency of postwar art historians to downplay them.

==Death==
He died in Seebüll, now part of Neukirchen, in 1956. The Nolde Stiftung Seebüll (The Nolde Foundation at Seebull) was created the same year and opened a museum dedicated to his life and work in 1957.

==Body of work==
Apart from paintings, Nolde&#x27;s work includes many prints, often in color, and watercolor paintings of varied subjects (landscapes, religious images, flowers, stormy seas and scenes from Berlin nightlife). A famous series of paintings covers the German New Guinea Expedition, visiting the South Seas, Moscow, Siberia, Korea, Japan, and China. The Schiefler &quot;catalogue raisonné&quot; of his prints describes 231 etchings, 197 woodcuts, 83 lithographs, and four hectographs. He named a wartime series of 1300 works in watercolor on Japanese paper &quot;Unpainted Paintings&quot;, made in the shadow of Hitler&#x27;s decree.

==Religious motifs==
Although religious images make up a relatively small part of Nolde&#x27;s artistic oeuvre, he considered some to be &quot;milestones&quot; with respect to his progression as an artist.

Nolde, who grew up a farmer&#x27;s son in a small, religious community near the German-Danish border, was left with lasting impressions of Judeo-Christian stories after reading the Bible in its entirety. In his early religious works (1900–1904), he was unable to solidify his own style and distinguish himself from several role models, Jean-François Millet and Honoré Daumier.

Nolde experienced a turning point in 1906; in that year, he shifted from an impressionistic style to a depiction of religious themes that emphasized the emotion of the moment, use of bright colors and only two dimensions of representation. This new devotion to religious artwork was hastened by a near death experience in 1909 after drinking poisoned water at the age of 42.
After 1911 Nolde&#x27;s religious treatments—now including etchings—became darker and more ominous in tone than his previous works. Even his wife, Ada, was unnerved by his bold vision. In response to his nine-part &quot;The Life of Christ&quot;, she wrote in a letter: &quot;For the first few days I was only able to take a furtive peek now and then, so strong was the effect.&quot;

==Paintings==
==Major works==
Nolde&#x27;s work is exhibited at major museums around the world, including &quot;Portrait of a Young Woman and a Child&quot;, &quot;Portrait of a Man&quot; (c. 1926), and &quot;Portrait of a Young Girl&quot; (1913–1914) at the Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg, Russia; and &quot;Prophet&quot; (1921) and &quot;Young Couple&quot; (1913) at the Museum of Modern Art, New York City. His most important print, &quot;The Prophet&quot; (1912), is an icon of 20th-century art.

Among his most important oils are &quot;Lesende junge Frau&quot; (1906), &quot;Blumengarten (ohne Figur)&quot; (1908), and &quot;Blumen und Wolken&quot; (1933).

Other important works:
* &quot;Lesende junge frau&quot;, 1906, oil on canvas, Kunsthalle Kiel
* &quot;Blumengarten (ohne Figur)&quot;, 1908, oil on canvas, Sotheby&#x27;s purchaser 8 February 2012
* &quot;Anna Wieds Garten&quot;, 1907, oil on canvas, Private Collection
* &quot;Steigende Wolken&quot;, 1927, oil on canvas, Karl-Ernst-Osthaus-Museum, Hagen
* &quot;Grosse Sonnenblumen&quot;, 1928, oil on canvas, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York
* &quot;Blumen und Wolken&quot;, 1933, oil on canvas, Museum Sprengel, Hanover

In recent years, Nolde&#x27;s paintings have achieved prices of several million US dollars, in auctions conducted by the leading international auction houses. On 8 February 2012, &quot;Blumengarten (ohne Figur)&quot; was sold by Sotheby&#x27;s in London for US$3,272,673.

==Nazi-looted art==
Nolde&#x27;s work has become the focus of renewed attention after a painting entitled &quot;Blumengarten (Utenwarf)&quot; from 1917, which now hangs in the art museum Moderna Museet, Stockholm, Sweden, and has been valued at US$4 million, was discovered to have been looted from Otto Nathan Deutsch, a German-Jewish refugee whose heirs, including a Holocaust survivor, are asking for its return. The Swedish government decided in 2007 that the museum must settle with the heirs. Deutsch was forced to flee Germany before World War II and left for Amsterdam in late 1938 or early 1939. The painting was sold to the Swedish museum at an auction in Switzerland, where it had resurfaced in 1967.

In 2015, Nolde&#x27;s &quot;Maiwiese (Maienwiese) [Meadow in May&quot;], 1915, (Inv. Nr. 94) was restituted by the Lentos Art Museum in Linz to the heirs of Dr. Otto Siegfried Julius.

In 2017 the Wilhelm Lehmbruck Museum Foundation restituted the painting “Women in a Flower Garden” by Emil Nolde to the heirs of Eduard Müller who was murdered in a Nazi concentration camp in 1942.

In 2019 the city of Düsseldorf agreed to restitute Nolde&#x27;s The Actress to the heirs of Curt Schueler. The painting had been acquired for Düsseldorf by Conrad Doebbeke.

In 2000 the Wilhelm Lehmbruck Museum Foundation, Duisburg rejected a restitution request from the family of the Breslau (Wroclaw) collector Dr. Ismar Littmann for Nolde&#x27;s painting &quot;Buchsbaumgarten (Boxtree Garden&quot;).

<text>Clement of Rome (; ; died ), also known as Pope Clement I, was the Bishop of Rome in the late first century AD. He is considered to be the first of the Apostolic Fathers of the Church, and a leading member of the Church in Rome in the late 1st century.

Little is known about Clement&#x27;s life. Tertullian claimed that Clement was ordained by Saint Peter. Early church lists place him as the second or third bishop of Rome. Eusebius, in his book &quot;Church History&quot; mentioned Clement as the third bishop of Rome and as the &quot;co-laborer&quot; of Paul. In Against Heresies, Irenaeus described Clement as the successor to Anacletus, who was the third bishop of Rome, and as a personal acquaintance of the Apostles. According to the &quot;Annuario Pontificio&quot;, Clement was the fourth bishop of Rome, holding office at the very end of the 1st century. It is likely that Clement died in exile, and was possibly martyred. According to apocryphal stories dating back to the 4th century by authors such as Rufinus, Clement was imprisoned by Roman Emperor Trajan, and was executed by being tied to an anchor and thrown into the sea. The &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot; states that Clement died in Greece in the third year of Trajan&#x27;s reign, or 100 AD.

The only known genuine extant writing of Clement is his letter to the church at Corinth (1 Clement) in response to a dispute in which certain presbyters of the Corinthian church had been deposed. He asserted the authority of the presbyters as rulers of the church because they had been appointed by the Apostles. His letter, which is one of the oldest extant Christian documents outside the New Testament, was read in the church at Corinth, along with other epistles, some of which later became part of the Christian canon. This letter is considered to be the earliest affirmation of the principle of apostolic succession. A second epistle, 2 Clement, was once controversially attributed to Clement, although recent scholarship suggests it to be a homily by another author. In the pseudo-Clementine Writings, Clement is the intermediary through whom the apostles teach the church.

Clement is recognized as a saint in many Christian churches and a patron saint of mariners. He is commemorated on 23 November in the Catholic Church, the Anglican Communion, and the Lutheran Church. In Eastern Orthodox Christianity his feast is kept on 25 November.

==Life==

The &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot; presents a list that makes Linus the second in the line of bishops of Rome, with Peter as first; but at the same time it states that Peter ordained two bishops, Linus and Anacletus, for the priestly service of the community, devoting himself instead to prayer and preaching, and that it was to Clement that he entrusted the Church as a whole, appointing him as his successor. Tertullian considered Clement to be the immediate successor of Peter. In one of his works, Jerome listed Clement as &quot;the fourth bishop of Rome after Peter, if indeed the second was Linus and the third Anacletus, although most of the Latins think that Clement was second after the apostle.&quot; Clement is put after Linus and Cletus/Anacletus in the earliest (c. 180) account, that of Irenaeus, who is followed by Eusebius of Caesarea.

Early succession lists name Clement as the first, second, or third successor of Peter. However, the meaning of his inclusion in these lists has been very controversial. Some believe there were presbyter-bishops as early as the 1st century, but that there is no evidence for a monarchical episcopacy in Rome at such an early date. There is also, however, no evidence of a change occurring in ecclesiastical organization in the latter half of the 2nd century, which would indicate that a new or newly-monarchical episcopacy was establishing itself.

A tradition that began in the 3rd and 4th century, has identified him as the Clement that Paul mentioned in Philippians , a fellow laborer in Christ. While in the mid-19th century it was customary to identify him as a freedman of Titus Flavius Clemens, who was consul with his cousin, the Emperor Domitian, this identification, which no ancient sources suggest, afterwards lost support. The 2nd-century &quot;Shepherd of Hermas&quot; mentions a Clement whose office it was to communicate with other churches; most likely, this is a reference to Clement I.

A large congregation existed in Rome c. 58, when Paul wrote his Epistle to the Romans. Paul arrived in Rome c. 60 (Acts). Paul and Peter were said to have been martyred there. Nero persecuted Roman Christians after Rome burned in 64, and the congregation may have suffered further persecution under Domitian (81–96). Clement was the first of early Rome&#x27;s most notable bishops. The &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;, which documents the reigns of popes, states that Clement had known Peter.

Clement is known for his epistle to the church in Corinth (c. 96), in which he asserts the apostolic authority of the bishops/presbyters as rulers of the church. The epistle mentions &quot;episkopoi&quot; (overseers, bishops) or &quot;presbyteroi&quot; (elders, presbyters) as the upper class of minister, served by the deacons, but, since it does not mention himself, it gives no indication of the title or titles used for Clement in Rome.

== Death and legends of final days ==
According to apocryphal &quot;acta&quot; dating to the 4th century at earliest, Clement was banished from Rome to the Chersonesus during the reign of the Emperor Trajan and was set to work in a stone quarry. Finding on his arrival that the prisoners were suffering from lack of water, he knelt down in prayer. Looking up, he saw a lamb on a hill, went to where the lamb had stood and struck the ground with his pickaxe, releasing a gushing stream of clear water. This miracle resulted in the conversion of large numbers of the local pagans and his fellow prisoners to Christianity. As punishment, Clement was martyred by being tied to an anchor and thrown from a boat into the Black Sea. The legend recounts that every year a miraculous ebbing of the sea revealed a divinely built shrine containing his bones. However, the oldest sources on Clement&#x27;s life, Eusebius and Jerome, note nothing of his martyrdom.

The Inkerman Cave Monastery marks the supposed place of Clement&#x27;s burial in Crimea. A year or two before his own death in 869, Cyril brought to Rome what he believed to be the relics of Clement, bones he found in Crimea buried with an anchor on dry land. They are now enshrined in the Basilica di San Clemente. But there are also other traditions about an ancient veneration of the relics in Chersonesus and the translation of the head to Kyiv. Other relics of Clement, including his head, are claimed by the Kyiv Monastery of the Caves in Ukraine.

==Writings==
The &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot; states that Clement wrote two letters (though the second letter, 2 Clement, is no longer ascribed to him by many modern scholars).

===Epistle of Clement===

Clement&#x27;s only extant, uncontested text is a letter to the Christian congregation in Corinth, often called the First Epistle of Clement or 1 Clement. The history of 1 Clement clearly and continuously shows Clement as the author of this letter. It is considered the earliest authentic Christian document outside the New Testament.

Clement writes to the troubled congregation in Corinth, where certain &quot;presbyters&quot; or &quot;bishops&quot; have been deposed (the class of clergy above that of deacons is argued by certain historians to be designated indifferently by the two terms). Clement calls for repentance and reinstatement of those who have been deposed, in line with maintenance of order and obedience to church authority, since the apostles established the ministry of &quot;bishops and deacons.&quot; He mentions &quot;offering the gifts&quot; as one of the functions of the higher class of clergy. The epistle offers valuable insight into Church ministry at that time and into the history of the Roman Church. It was highly regarded, and was read in church at Corinth along with the Scriptures c. 170.

In the epistle, it is argued by some that Clement uses the terms &quot;bishop&quot; and &quot;presbyter&quot; interchangeably for the higher order of ministers above deacons. In some congregations, particularly in Egypt, the distinction between bishops and presbyters seems to have become established only later. But by the middle of the second century all the leading Christian centres had bishops. Scholars such as Bart Ehrman treat as significant the fact that, of the seven letters written by Ignatius of Antioch to seven Christian churches shortly after the time of Clement, the only one that does not present the church as headed by a single bishop is that addressed to the church in Rome, although this letter did not refer to a collective priesthood either.

Clement&#x27;s letter also contains historical references, it mentions persecutions of Christians, records the martyrdom of the Apostle Peter and suggests that the apostle Paul traveled to Spain.

==== Theology ====

Clement&#x27;s view on justification has had much scholarly discussion, as he is sometimes argued to have believed sola fide, though others believe him as having synergist views. Debate exists, because Clement directly stated that &quot;we are not justified by ourselves but by faith&quot;, however in other places of the letter, he stresses judgement on sin. The Protestant scholar Tom Schreiner argued that Clement of Rome believed in a grace oriented justification by faith, which will cause the believer to do works as a result, Philip Schaff also said that Clement probably taught a faith alone doctrine while &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; wrote that Clement believed works to be part of justification. Rudolf Knopf and Rudolf Bultmann also believed that Clement believed in synergism, and that the believer needs to cooperate with the grace of God to be saved. Rudolf Knopf in his commentary on the letter of Clement to the Corinthians stated that: &quot;Pre-Christian sins are wiped out by baptism. For those sins that follow, a person must have faith in divine mercy and, at the same time, that person must exhibit his or her own good deeds, apart from which the person cannot be saved&quot; David Downs argued against the view that Clement of Rome holds synergist views, he argued that Clement did not write a letter about deep soteriology, but instead to provide moral guidance to the Corinthians, David Downs stated &quot;According to the soteriological economy of Clement everything rests on the goodness, mercy, and election of the Creator, which have befitted the &#x27;chosen portion&#x27; through Jesus&quot;.

Thomas Schreiner argued that Clement taught that faith was enough to be saved because of 1 Clement 32:4 where he stated:And so we, having been called through His will in Christ Jesus, are not justified through ourselves or through our own wisdom or understanding or piety or works which we wrought in holiness of heart, but through faith, whereby the Almighty God justified all men that have been from the beginning; to whom be the glory for ever and ever. Amen. (1 Clement 32:4)The epistle has been cited as the first work to establish Roman primacy, because he wrote to settle a problem in the church, but most scholars see the epistle as more fraternal than authoritative, and Orthodox scholar John Meyendorff sees it as connected with the Roman church&#x27;s awareness of its &quot;priority&quot; (rather than &quot;primacy&quot;) among local churches. It has also been argued by Dave Armstrong, that Clement supported Papal Infallibility in Letter to the Corinthians 1, 63. Because of him speaking of the Corinthians to &quot;being obedient&quot; to the things he has &quot;written through the Holy Spirit&quot; in order to correct and &quot;root out the wicked passion of jealousy&quot;.

It has also been argued that the epistle may contain early evidence for belief in universal salvation.

According to &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;, the letter of Clement has Trinitarian theology and Christ is frequently called as the high priest by him.

=== Writings formerly attributed to Clement ===
====Second Epistle of Clement====

The Second Epistle of Clement is a homily, or sermon, likely written in Corinth or Rome, but not by Clement. Early Christian congregations often shared homilies to be read. The homily describes Christian character and repentance. It is possible that the Church from which Clement sent his epistle had included a festal homily to share in one economical post, thus the homily became known as the Second Epistle of Clement.

While 2 Clement has been traditionally ascribed to Clement, most scholars believe that 2 Clement was written in the 2nd century based on the doctrinal themes of the text and a near match between words in 2 Clement and in the Greek Gospel of the Egyptians. Doubts about the authorship were already expressed in antiquity by Eusebius and Jerome.

====Epistles on Virginity====
Two &quot;Epistles on Virginity&quot; were traditionally attributed to Clement, but now there exists almost universal consensus that Clement was not the author of those two epistles.

====False Decretals====

A 9th-century collection of church legislation known as the False Decretals, which was once attributed to Isidore of Seville, is largely composed of forgeries. All of what it presents as letters of pre-Nicene popes, beginning with Clement, are forgeries, as are some of the documents that it attributes to councils; and more than forty falsifications are found in the decretals that it gives as those of post-Nicene popes from Sylvester I (314–335) to Gregory II (715–731). The False Decretals were part of a series of falsifications of past legislation by a party in the Carolingian Empire whose principal aim was to free the church and the bishops from interference by the state and the metropolitan archbishops respectively.

Clement is included among other early Christian popes as authors of the Pseudo-Isidoran (or False) Decretals, a 9th-century forgery. These decrees and letters portray even the early popes as claiming absolute and universal authority. Clement is the earliest pope to whom a Pseudo-Isidoran text is attributed.

===Clementine literature===

Clement is also the hero of an early Christian romance or novel that has survived in at least two different versions, known as the Clementine literature, where he is identified with Emperor Domitian&#x27;s cousin Titus Flavius Clemens. Clementine literature portrays Clement as the Apostles&#x27; means of disseminating their teachings to the Church.

==Recognition as a saint==

Clement&#x27;s name is in the Roman Canon of the Mass. He is commemorated on 23 November as a pope and martyr in the Catholic Church as well as within the Anglican Communion and the Lutheran Church. The Syriac Orthodox Church, the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, the Macedonian Orthodox Church and the Greek Orthodox Church, as well as the Syriac Catholic Church, the Syro-Malankara Catholic Church and all Byzantine Rite Eastern Catholic Churches commemorate Clement of Rome (called in Syriac &quot;Mor Clemis&quot;) on 24 November; the Russian Orthodox Church commemorates Clement on 25 November. Clement is honored in the Church of England and in the Episcopal Church on 23 November.

The St Clement&#x27;s Church in Moscow is renowned for its glittering Baroque interior and iconostasis, as well as a set of gilded 18th-century railings. The parish was disbanded in 1934 and the original free-standing gate was demolished. The Lenin State Library stored its books in the building throughout the Soviet period. It was not until 2008 that the building reverted to the Russian Orthodox Church.

Clement of Rome is commemorated in the Synaxarium of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria on the 29th of the month of Hatour [25 November (Julian) – equivalent to 8 December (Gregorian) due to the current 13-day Julian–Gregorian Calendar offset]. According to the Coptic Church Synaxarium, he suffered martyrdom in AD 100 during the reign of Emperor Trajan (98–117). He was martyred by tying his neck to an anchor and casting him into the sea. The record of the 29th of the Coptic month of Hatour states that this saint was born in Rome to an honorable father whose name was Fostinus and also states that he was a member of the Roman senate and that his father educated him and taught him Greek literature.

===Relics===
Besides relics venerated in Rome and Kyiv (see above), 
in the city of Santa Cruz de Tenerife in Spain, the shinbone of Clement is kept. It was a gift of Sidotti, Patriarch of Antioch, to the Church of the Immaculate Conception. Historically, this was a highly revered relic in the city.

===Symbolism===

In workings of art, Clement can be recognized by having an anchor at his side or tied to his neck. He is most often depicted wearing papal vestments, including the pallium, and sometimes with a papal tiara but more often with a mitre. He is also sometimes shown with papal symbols such as the papal cross and the Keys of Heaven. In reference to his martyrdom, he often holds the palm of martyrdom.

Clement can be seen depicted near a fountain or spring, relating to the incident from his hagiography, or lying in a temple in the sea. The Anchored Cross or Mariner&#x27;s Cross is also referred to as St. Clement&#x27;s Cross, in reference to the way he was martyred.

<text>Pope Zephyrinus was the bishop of Rome from the year 199 until his death on 20 December 217. He was born in Rome, and succeeded Victor I. Upon his death on 20 December 217, he was succeeded by his principal advisor, Callixtus I. He is known for combating heresies and defending the divinity of Christ.

==Papacy==
During the 18-year pontificate of Zephyrinus, the young Church endured persecution under the Emperor Septimius Severus until his death in the year 211. To quote Alban Butler, &quot;this holy pastor was the support and comfort of the distressed flock&quot;. According to St. Optatus, Zephyrinus also combated new heresies and apostasies, chief of which were Marcion, Praxeas, Valentine and the Montanists. Eusebius insists that Zephyrinus fought vigorously against the blasphemies of the two Theodotuses, who in response treated him with contempt, but later called him the greatest defender of the divinity of Christ. Although he was not physically martyred for the faith, his suffering – both mental and spiritual – during his pontificate have earned him the title of martyr, a title that was repealed 132 years after his death. He was accused of being seduced by Monarchian views.

===Conflicts===
During the reign of Emperor Septimius Severus (193–211), relations with the young Christian Church deteriorated, and in 202 or 203, the edict of persecution appeared, which forbade conversion to Christianity under the severest penalties.

Zephyrinus&#x27;s predecessor, Pope Victor I, had excommunicated Theodotus the Tanner for reviving a heresy that Christ became God only after the Resurrection. Theodotus&#x27; followers formed a separate heretical community at Rome, ruled by another Theodotus, the Money Changer, and Asclepiodotus. Natalius, who was tortured for his faith during the persecution, was persuaded by Asclepiodotus to become a bishop in their sect in exchange for a monthly stipend of 150 denarii. Natalius then reportedly experienced several visions warning him to abandon these heretics. According to an anonymous work entitled &quot;The Little Labyrinth&quot; quoted by Eusebius, Natalius was whipped a whole night by an angel, and the next day, he donned sackcloth and ashes and weeping bitterly threw himself at the feet of Zephyrinus.

===Feast day===
A feast of St Zephyrinus, Pope and Martyr, held on 26 August, was inserted in the General Roman Calendar in the 13th century, but was removed in the 1969 revision, since he was not a martyr and 26 August is not the anniversary of his death which is 20 December, the day under which he is now mentioned in the Roman Martyrology. His feast is currently celebrated on 20 December in both the Extraordinary Form of the Roman Rite and within the Maronite Catholic Church, as well as in the Orthodox Church.

<text>An IBM PC compatible is any personal computer that is hardware- and software-compatible with the IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC) and its subsequent models. Like the original IBM PC, an IBM PC–compatible computer uses an x86-based central processing unit, sourced either from Intel or a second source like AMD, Cyrix or other vendors such as Texas Instruments, Fujitsu, OKI, Mitsubishi or NEC and is capable of using interchangeable commodity hardware such as expansion cards. Initially such computers were referred to as PC clones, IBM clones or IBM PC clones, but the term &quot;IBM PC compatible&quot; is now a historical description only, as the vast majority of microcomputers produced since the 1990s are IBM compatible. IBM itself no longer sells personal computers, having sold its division to Lenovo in 2005. &quot;Wintel&quot; is a similar description that is more commonly used for modern computers. 

The designation &quot;PC&quot;, as used in much of personal computer history, has not meant &quot;personal computer&quot; generally, but rather an x86 computer capable of running the same software that a contemporary IBM or Lenovo PC could. The term was initially in contrast to the variety of home computer systems available in the early 1980s, such as the Apple II, TRS-80, and Commodore 64. Later, the term was primarily used in contrast to Commodore&#x27;s Amiga and Apple&#x27;s Macintosh computers.

== Overview ==
These &quot;clones&quot; duplicated almost all the significant features of the original IBM PC architectures. This was facilitated by IBM&#x27;s choice of commodity hardware components, which were cheap, and by various manufacturers&#x27; ability to reverse-engineer the BIOS firmware using a &quot;clean room design&quot; technique. Columbia Data Products built the first clone of the IBM personal computer, the MPC 1600 by a clean-room reverse-engineered implementation of its BIOS. Other rival companies, Corona Data Systems, Eagle Computer, and the Handwell Corporation were threatened with legal action by IBM, who settled with them. Soon after in 1982, Compaq released the very successful Compaq Portable, also with a clean-room reverse-engineered BIOS, and also not challenged legally by IBM.

Early IBM PC compatibles used the same computer buses as their IBM counterparts, switching from the 8-bit IBM PC and XT bus to the 16-bit IBM AT bus with the release of the AT. IBM&#x27;s introduction of the proprietary Micro Channel architecture (MCA) in its Personal System/2 (PS/2) series resulted in the establishment of the Extended Industry Standard Architecture bus open standard by a consortium of IBM PC compatible vendors, redefining the 16-bit IBM AT bus as the Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) bus. Additional bus standards were subsequently adopted to improve compatibility between IBM PC compatibles, including the VESA Local Bus (VLB), Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI), and the Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP).

Descendants of the x86 IBM PC compatibles, namely 64-bit computers based on &quot;x86-64/AMD64&quot; chips comprise the majority of desktop computers on the market as of 2021, with the dominant operating system being Microsoft Windows. Interoperability with the bus structure and peripherals of the original PC architecture may be limited or non-existent. Many modern computers are unable to use old software or hardware that depends on portions of the IBM PC compatible architecture which are missing or do not have equivalents in modern computers. For example, computers which boot using Unified Extensible Firmware Interface-based firmware that lack a Compatibility Support Module, or CSM, required to emulate the old BIOS-based firmware interface, or have their CSMs disabled, cannot natively run MS-DOS since MS-DOS depends on a BIOS interface to boot.

Only the Macintosh had kept significant market share without having compatibility with the IBM PC, although that changed during the Intel Macs era running Mac OS X, often dual-booting Windows with Boot Camp.

==Origins==
IBM decided in 1980 to market a low-cost single-user computer as quickly as possible. On August 12, 1981, the first IBM PC went on sale. There were three operating systems (OS) available for it. The least expensive and most popular was PC DOS made by Microsoft. In a crucial concession, IBM&#x27;s agreement allowed Microsoft to sell its own version, MS-DOS, for non-IBM computers. The only component of the original PC architecture exclusive to IBM was the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System).

IBM at first asked developers to avoid writing software that addressed the computer&#x27;s hardware directly and to instead make standard calls to BIOS functions that carried out hardware-dependent operations. This software would run on any machine using MS-DOS or PC DOS. Software that directly addressed the hardware instead of making standard calls was faster, however; this was particularly relevant to games. Software addressing IBM PC hardware in this way would not run on MS-DOS machines with different hardware (for example, the PC-98). The IBM PC was sold in high enough volumes to justify writing software specifically for it, and this encouraged other manufacturers to produce machines that could use the same programs, expansion cards, and peripherals as the PC. The x86 computer marketplace rapidly excluded all machines which were not hardware-compatible or software-compatible with the PC. The 640 KB barrier on &quot;conventional&quot; system memory available to MS-DOS is a legacy of that period; other non-clone machines, while subject to a limit, could exceed 640 KB.

Rumors of &quot;lookalike,&quot; compatible computers, created without IBM&#x27;s approval, began almost immediately after the IBM PC&#x27;s release. &quot;InfoWorld&quot; wrote on the first anniversary of the IBM PC that

By June 1983 &quot;PC Magazine&quot; defined &quot;PC &#x27;clone as &quot;a computer [that can] accommodate the user who takes a disk home from an IBM PC, walks across the room, and plugs it into the &#x27;foreign&#x27; machine&quot;. Demand for the PC by then was so strong that dealers received 60% or less of the inventory they wanted, and many customers purchased clones instead. Columbia Data Products produced the first computer more or less compatible with the IBM PC standard during June 1982, soon followed by Eagle Computer. Compaq announced its first product, an IBM PC compatible in November 1982, the Compaq Portable. The Compaq was the first sewing machine-sized portable computer that was essentially 100% PC-compatible. The court decision in &quot;Apple v. Franklin&quot;, was that BIOS code was protected by copyright law, but it could reverse-engineer the IBM BIOS and then write its own BIOS using clean room design. Note this was over a year after Compaq released the Portable. The money and research put into reverse-engineering the BIOS was a calculated risk.

==Compatibility issues==
===Non-compatible MS-DOS computers: Workalikes===
At the same time, many manufacturers such as Tandy/RadioShack, Xerox, Hewlett-Packard, Digital Equipment Corporation, Sanyo, Texas Instruments, Tulip, Wang and Olivetti introduced personal computers that supported MS-DOS, but were not completely software- or hardware-compatible with the IBM PC.

Tandy described the Tandy 2000, for example, as having a &quot;&#x27;next generation&#x27; true 16-bit CPU&quot;, and with &quot;More speed. More disk storage. More expansion&quot; than the IBM PC or &quot;other MS-DOS computers&quot;. While admitting in 1984 that many PC DOS programs did not work on the computer, the company stated that &quot;the most popular, sophisticated software on the market&quot; was available, either immediately or &quot;over the next six months&quot;.

Like IBM, Microsoft&#x27;s apparent intention was that application writers would write to the application programming interfaces in MS-DOS or the firmware BIOS, and that this would form what would now be termed a hardware abstraction layer. Each computer would have its own Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) version of MS-DOS, customized to its hardware. Any software written for MS-DOS would operate on any MS-DOS computer, despite variations in hardware design.

This expectation seemed reasonable in the computer marketplace of the time. Until then Microsoft&#x27;s business was based primarily on computer languages such as BASIC. The established small system operating software was CP/M from Digital Research which was in use both at the hobbyist level and by the more professional of those using microcomputers. To achieve such widespread use, and thus make the product viable economically, the OS had to operate across a range of machines from different vendors that had widely varying hardware. Those customers who needed other applications than the starter programs could reasonably expect publishers to offer their products for a variety of computers, on suitable media for each.

Microsoft&#x27;s competing OS was intended initially to operate on a similar varied spectrum of hardware, although all based on the 8086 processor. Thus, MS-DOS was for several years sold only as an OEM product. There was no Microsoft-branded MS-DOS: MS-DOS could not be purchased directly from Microsoft, and each OEM release was packaged with the trade dress of the given PC vendor. Malfunctions were to be reported to the OEM, not to Microsoft. However, as machines that were compatible with IBM hardware—thus supporting direct calls to the hardware—became widespread, it soon became clear that the OEM versions of MS-DOS were virtually identical, except perhaps for the provision of a few utility programs.

MS-DOS provided adequate functionality for character-oriented applications such as those that could have been implemented on a text-only terminal. Had the bulk of commercially important software been of this nature, low-level hardware compatibility might not have mattered. However, in order to provide maximum performance and leverage hardware features (or work around hardware bugs), PC applications quickly developed beyond the simple terminal applications that MS-DOS supported directly. Spreadsheets, WYSIWYG word processors, presentation software and remote communication software established new markets that exploited the PC&#x27;s strengths, but required capabilities beyond what MS-DOS provided. Thus, from very early in the development of the MS-DOS software environment, many significant commercial software products were written directly to the hardware, for a variety of reasons:
* MS-DOS itself did not provide any way to position the text cursor other than to advance it after displaying each letter (teletype mode). While the BIOS video interface routines were adequate for rudimentary output, they were necessarily less efficient than direct hardware addressing, as they added extra processing; they did not have &quot;string&quot; output, but only character-by-character teletype output, and they inserted delays to prevent CGA hardware &quot;snow&quot; (a display artifact of CGA cards produced when writing directly to screen memory)——an especially bad artifact since they were called by IRQs, thus making multitasking very difficult. A program that wrote directly to video memory could achieve output rates 5 to 20 times faster than making system calls. Turbo Pascal used this technique from its earliest versions.
* Graphics capability was not taken seriously in the original IBM design brief; graphics were considered only from the perspective of generating static business graphics such as charts and graphs. MS-DOS did not have an API for graphics, and the BIOS only included the rudimentary graphics functions such as changing screen modes and plotting single points. To make a BIOS call for every point drawn or modified increased overhead considerably, making the BIOS interface notoriously slow. Because of this, line-drawing, arc-drawing, and blitting had to be performed by the application to achieve acceptable speed, which was usually done by bypassing the BIOS and accessing video memory directly. Software written to address IBM PC hardware directly would run on any IBM clone, but would have to be rewritten especially for each non-PC-compatible MS-DOS machine.
* Video games, even early ones, mostly required a true graphics mode. They also performed any machine-dependent trick the programmers could think of in order to gain speed. Though initially the major market for the PC was for business applications, games capability became an important factor motivating PC purchases as prices decreased. The availability and quality of games could mean the difference between the purchase of a PC compatible or a different platform with the ability to exchange data like the Amiga.
* Communications software directly accessed the UART serial port chip, because the MS-DOS API and the BIOS did not provide full support and was too slow to keep up with hardware which could transfer data at 19,200 bit/s.
* Even for standard business applications, speed of execution was a significant competitive advantage. Integrated software Context MBA preceded Lotus 1-2-3 to market and included more functions. Context MBA was written in UCSD p-System, making it very portable but too slow to be truly usable on a PC. 1-2-3 was written in x86 assembly language and performed some machine-dependent tricks. It was so much faster that it quickly surpassed Context MBA&#x27;s sales.
* Disk copy-protection schemes, in common use at the time, worked by reading nonstandard data patterns on the diskette to verify originality. These patterns were impossible to detect using standard DOS or BIOS calls, so direct access to the disk controller hardware was necessary for the protection to work.
* Some software was designed to run only on a true IBM PC, and checked for an actual IBM BIOS.

== First-generation PC workalikes by IBM competitors ==
===&quot;Operationally Compatible&quot;===
In May 1983, Future Computing defined four levels of compatibility:

* &quot;Operationally Compatible&quot;. Can run &quot;the top selling&quot; IBM PC software, use PC expansion boards, and read and write PC disks. Has &quot;complementary features&quot; like portability or lower price that distinguish computer from the PC, which is sold in the same store. Examples: (Best) Columbia Data Products, Compaq; (Better) Corona; (Good) Eagle.
* &quot;Functionally Compatible&quot;. Runs own version of popular PC software. Cannot use PC expansion boards but can read and write PC disks. Cannot become Operationally Compatible. Example: TI Professional.
* &quot;Data Compatible&quot;. May not run top PC software. Can read and/or write PC disks. Can become Functionally Compatible. Examples: NCR Decision Mate, Olivetti M20, Wang PC, Zenith Z-100.
* &quot;Incompatible&quot;. Cannot read PC disks. Can become Data Compatible. Examples: Altos 586, DEC Rainbow 100, Grid Compass, Victor 9000.

During development, Compaq engineers found that &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator&quot; would not run because of what subLOGIC&#x27;s Bruce Artwick described as &quot;a bug in one of Intel&#x27;s chips&quot;, forcing them to make their new computer bug compatible with the IBM PC. At first, few clones other than Compaq&#x27;s offered truly full compatibility. Jerry Pournelle purchased an IBM PC in mid-1983, &quot;rotten keyboard and all&quot;, because he had &quot;four cubic feet of unevaluated software, much of which won&#x27;t run on anything but an IBM PC. Although a lot of machines claim to be 100 percent IBM PC compatible, I&#x27;ve yet to have one arrive ... Alas, a lot of stuff doesn&#x27;t run with Eagle, Z-100, Compupro, or anything else we have around here&quot;. Columbia Data Products&#x27;s November 1983 sales brochure stated that during tests with retail-purchased computers in October 1983, its own and Compaq&#x27;s products were compatible with all tested PC software, while Corona and Eagle&#x27;s were less compatible. Columbia University reported in January 1984 that Kermit ran without modification on Compaq and Columbia Data Products clones, but not on those from Eagle or Seequa. Other MS-DOS computers also required custom code.

By December 1983 Future Computing stated that companies like Compaq, Columbia Data Products, and Corona that emphasized IBM PC compatibility had been successful, while non-compatible computers had hurt the reputations of others like TI and DEC despite superior technology. At a San Francisco meeting it warned 200 attendees, from many American and foreign computer companies as well as IBM itself, to &quot;Jump on the IBM PC-compatible bandwagon—quickly, and as compatibly as possible&quot;. Future Computing said in February 1984 that some computers were &quot;press-release compatible&quot;, exaggerating their actual compatibility with the IBM PC. Many companies were reluctant to have their products&#x27; PC compatibility tested. When &quot;PC Magazine&quot; requested samples from computer manufacturers that claimed to produce compatibles for an April 1984 review, 14 of 31 declined. Corona specified that &quot;Our systems run all software that conforms to IBM PC programming standards. And the most popular software does.&quot; When a &quot;BYTE&quot; journalist asked to test Peachtext at the Spring 1983 COMDEX, Corona representatives &quot;hemmed and hawed a bit, but they finally led me ... off in the corner where no one would see it should it fail&quot;. The magazine reported that &quot;Their hesitancy was unnecessary. The disk booted up without a problem&quot;. Zenith Data Systems was bolder, bragging that its Z-150 ran all applications people brought to test with at the 1984 West Coast Computer Faire.

&quot;Creative Computing&quot; in 1985 stated, &quot;we reiterate our standard line regarding the IBM PC compatibles: try the package you want to use before you buy the computer.&quot; Companies modified their computers&#x27; BIOS to work with newly discovered incompatible applications, and reviewers and users developed stress tests to measure compatibility; by 1984 the ability to operate Lotus 1-2-3 and &quot;Flight Simulator&quot; became the standard, with compatibles specifically designed to run them.

IBM believed that some companies such as Eagle, Corona, and Handwell infringed on its copyright, and after &quot;Apple Computer, Inc. v. Franklin Computer Corp.&quot; successfully forced the clone makers to stop using the BIOS. The Phoenix BIOS in 1984, however, and similar products such as AMI BIOS, permitted computer makers to legally build essentially 100%-compatible clones without having to reverse-engineer the PC BIOS themselves. A September 1985 &quot;InfoWorld&quot; chart listed seven compatibles with RAM, two disk drives, and monochrome monitors for to , while the equivalent IBM PC cost . The Zenith Z-150 and inexpensive Leading Edge Model D are even compatible with IBM proprietary diagnostic software, unlike the Compaq Portable. By 1986 &quot;Compute!&quot; stated that &quot;clones are generally reliable and about 99 percent compatible&quot;, and a 1987 survey in the magazine of the clone industry did not mention software compatibility, stating that &quot;PC by now has come to stand for a computer capable of running programs that are managed by MS-DOS&quot;.

==The decreasing influence of IBM==


In February 1984 &quot;Byte&quot; wrote that &quot;IBM&#x27;s burgeoning influence in the PC community is stifling innovation because so many other companies are mimicking Big Blue&quot;, but &quot;The Economist&quot; stated in November 1983, &quot;The main reason why an IBM standard is not worrying is that it can help competition to flourish&quot;.

By 1983, IBM had about 25% of sales of personal computers between and , and computers with some PC compatibility were another 25%. As the market and competition grew IBM&#x27;s influence diminished. In November 1985 &quot;PC Magazine&quot; stated &quot;Now that it has created the [PC] market, the market doesn&#x27;t necessarily need IBM for the machines. It may depend on IBM to set standards and to develop higher-performance machines, but IBM had better conform to existing standards so as to not hurt users&quot;. In January 1987, Bruce Webster wrote in &quot;Byte&quot; of rumors that IBM would introduce proprietary personal computers with a proprietary operating system: &quot;Who cares? If IBM does it, they will most likely just isolate themselves from the largest marketplace, in which they really can&#x27;t compete anymore anyway&quot;. He predicted that in 1987 the market &quot;will complete its transition from an IBM standard to an Intel/MS-DOS/expansion bus standard ... Folks aren&#x27;t so much concerned about IBM compatibility as they are about Lotus 1-2-3 compatibility&quot;. By 1992, &quot;Macworld&quot; stated that because of clones, &quot;IBM lost control of its own market and became a minor player with its own technology&quot;.

&quot;The Economist&quot; predicted in 1983 that &quot;IBM will soon be as much a prisoner of its standards as its competitors are&quot;, because &quot;Once enough IBM machines have been bought, IBM cannot make sudden changes in their basic design; what might be useful for shedding competitors would shake off even more customers&quot;. After the Compaq Deskpro 386 became the first 80386-based PC, &quot;PC&quot; wrote that owners of the new computer did not need to fear that future IBM products would be incompatible with the Compaq, because such changes would also affect millions of real IBM PCs: &quot;In sticking it to the competition, IBM would be doing the same to its own people&quot;. After IBM announced the OS/2-oriented PS/2 line in early 1987, sales of existing DOS-compatible PC compatibles rose, in part because the proprietary operating system was not available. In 1988, Gartner Group estimated that the public purchased 1.5 clones for every IBM PC. By 1989 Compaq was so influential that industry executives spoke of &quot;Compaq compatible&quot;, with observers stating that customers saw the company as IBM&#x27;s equal or superior.

After 1987, IBM PC compatibles dominated both the home and business markets of commodity computers, with other notable alternative architectures being used in niche markets, like the Macintosh computers offered by Apple Inc. and used mainly for desktop publishing at the time, the aging 8-bit Commodore 64 which was selling for $150 by this time and became the world&#x27;s bestselling computer, the 32-bit Commodore Amiga line used for television and video production and the 32-bit Atari ST used by the music industry. However, IBM itself lost the main role in the market for IBM PC compatibles by 1990. A few events in retrospect are important:

* IBM designed the PC with an open architecture which permitted clone makers to use freely available non-proprietary components.
* Microsoft included a clause in its contract with IBM which permitted the sale of the finished PC operating system (PC DOS) to other computer manufacturers. These IBM competitors licensed it, as MS-DOS, in order to offer PC compatibility for less cost.
* The 1982 introduction of the Columbia Data Products MPC 1600, the first 100% IBM PC compatible computer.
* The 1983 introduction of the Compaq Portable, providing portability unavailable from IBM at the time.
* An Independent Business Unit (IBU) within IBM developed the IBM PC and XT. IBUs did not share in corporate R&amp;D expense. After the IBU became the Entry Systems Division it lost this benefit, greatly decreasing margins.
* The availability by 1986 of sub- &quot;Turbo XT&quot; PC XT compatibles, including early offerings from Dell Computer, reducing demand for IBM&#x27;s models. It was possible to buy two of these &quot;generic&quot; systems for less than the cost of one IBM-branded PC AT, and many companies did just that.
* By integrating more peripherals into the computer itself, compatibles like the Model D have more free ISA slots than the PC.
* Compaq was the first to release an Intel 80386-based computer, almost a year before IBM, with the Compaq Deskpro 386. Bill Gates later said that it was &quot;the first time people started to get a sense that it wasn&#x27;t just IBM setting the standards&quot;.
* IBM&#x27;s 1987 introduction of the incompatible and proprietary MicroChannel Architecture (MCA) computer bus, for its Personal System/2 (PS/2) line.
* The split of the IBM-Microsoft partnership in development of OS/2. Tensions caused by the market success of Windows 3.0 ruptured the joint effort because IBM was committed to the 286&#x27;s protected mode, which stunted OS/2&#x27;s technical potential. Windows could take full advantage of the modern and increasingly affordable 386 / 386SX architecture. As well, there were cultural differences between the partners, and Windows was often bundled with new computers while OS/2 was only available for extra cost. The split left IBM the sole steward of OS/2 and it failed to keep pace with Windows.
* The 1988 introduction by the &quot;Gang of Nine&quot; companies of a rival bus, Extended Industry Standard Architecture, intended to compete with, rather than copy, MCA.
* The duelling expanded memory (EMS) and extended memory (XMS) standards of the late 1980s, both developed without input from IBM.

Despite popularity of its ThinkPad set of laptop PC&#x27;s, IBM finally relinquished its role as a consumer PC manufacturer during April 2005, when it sold its laptop and desktop PC divisions (ThinkPad/ThinkCentre) to Lenovo for .

As of October 2007, Hewlett-Packard and Dell had the largest shares of the PC market in North America. They were also successful overseas, with Acer, Lenovo, and Toshiba also notable. Worldwide, a huge number of PCs are &quot;white box&quot; systems assembled by myriad local systems builders. Despite advances of computer technology, the IBM PC compatibles remained very much compatible with the original IBM PC computers, although most of the components implement the compatibility in special backward compatibility modes used only during a system boot. It was often more practical to run old software on a modern system using an emulator rather than relying on these features.

In 2014 Lenovo acquired IBM&#x27;s x86-based server (System x) business for .

==Expandability==
One of the strengths of the PC-compatible design is its modular hardware design. End-users could readily upgrade peripherals and, to some degree, processor and memory without modifying the computer&#x27;s motherboard or replacing the whole computer, as was the case with many of the microcomputers of the time. However, as processor speed and memory width increased, the limits of the original XT/AT bus design were soon reached, particularly when driving graphics video cards. IBM did introduce an upgraded bus in the IBM PS/2 computer that overcame many of the technical limits of the XT/AT bus, but this was rarely used as the basis for IBM-compatible computers since it required license payments to IBM both for the PS/2 bus and any prior AT-bus designs produced by the company seeking a license. This was unpopular with hardware manufacturers and several competing bus standards were developed by consortiums, with more agreeable license terms. Various attempts to standardize the interfaces were made, but in practice, many of these attempts were either flawed or ignored. Even so, there were many expansion options, and despite the confusion of its users, the PC compatible design advanced much faster than other competing designs of the time, even if only because of its market dominance.

==&quot;IBM PC compatible&quot; becomes &quot;Wintel&quot;==
During the 1990s, IBM&#x27;s influence on PC architecture started to decline. &quot;IBM PC compatible&quot; becomes &quot;Standard PC&quot; in 1990s, and later &quot;ACPI PC&quot; in 2000s. An IBM-brand PC became the exception rather than the rule. Instead of placing importance on compatibility with the IBM PC, vendors began to emphasize compatibility with Windows. In 1993, a version of Windows NT was released that could operate on processors other than the x86 set. While it required that applications be recompiled, which most developers did not do, its hardware independence was used for Silicon Graphics (SGI) x86 workstations–thanks to NT&#x27;s Hardware abstraction layer (HAL), they could operate NT (and its vast application library).

No mass-market personal computer hardware vendor dared to be incompatible with the latest version of Windows, and Microsoft&#x27;s annual WinHEC conferences provided a setting in which Microsoft could lobby for—and in some cases dictate—the pace and direction of the hardware of the PC industry. Microsoft and Intel had become so important to the ongoing development of PC hardware that industry writers began using the word Wintel to refer to the combined hardware-software system.

This terminology itself is becoming a misnomer, as Intel has lost absolute control over the direction of x86 hardware development with AMD&#x27;s AMD64. Additionally, non-Windows operating systems like macOS and Linux have established a presence on the x86 architecture.

==Design limitations and more compatibility issues==
Although the IBM PC was designed for expandability, the designers could not anticipate the hardware developments of the 1980s, nor the size of the industry they would engender. To make things worse, IBM&#x27;s choice of the Intel 8088 for the CPU introduced several limitations for developing software for the PC compatible platform. For example, the 8088 processor only had a 20-bit memory addressing space. To expand &quot;PC&quot;s beyond one megabyte, Lotus, Intel, and Microsoft jointly created expanded memory (EMS), a bank-switching scheme to allow more memory provided by add-in hardware, and accessed by a set of four 16-kilobyte &quot;windows&quot; inside the 20-bit addressing. Later, Intel CPUs had larger address spaces and could directly address 16 MB (80286) or more, causing Microsoft to develop extended memory (XMS) which did not require additional hardware.

&quot;Expanded&quot; and &quot;extended&quot; memory have incompatible interfaces, so anyone writing software that used more than one megabyte had to provide for both systems for the greatest compatibility until MS-DOS began including EMM386, which simulated EMS memory using XMS memory. A protected mode OS can also be written for the 80286, but DOS application compatibility was more difficult than expected, not only because most DOS applications accessed the hardware directly, bypassing BIOS routines intended to ensure compatibility, but also that most BIOS requests were made by the first 32 interrupt vectors, which were marked as &quot;reserved&quot; for protected mode processor exceptions by Intel.

Video cards suffered from their own incompatibilities. There was no standard interface for using higher-resolution SVGA graphics modes supported by later video cards. Each manufacturer developed their own methods of accessing the screen memory, including different mode numberings and different bank switching arrangements. The latter were used to address large images within a single 64 KB segment of memory. Previously, the VGA standard had used planar video memory arrangements to the same effect, but this did not easily extend to the greater color depths and higher resolutions offered by SVGA adapters. An attempt at creating a standard named VESA BIOS Extensions (VBE) was made, but not all manufacturers used it.

When the 386 was introduced, again a protected mode OS could be written for it. This time, DOS compatibility was much easier because of virtual 8086 mode. Unfortunately programs could not switch directly between them, so eventually, some new memory-model APIs were developed, VCPI and DPMI, the latter becoming the most popular.

Because of the great number of third-party adapters and no standard for them, programming the PC could be difficult. Professional developers would operate a large test-suite of various known-to-be-popular hardware combinations.

Meanwhile, consumers were overwhelmed by the competing, incompatible standards and many different combinations of hardware on offer. To give them some idea of what sort of PC they would need to operate their software, the Multimedia PC (MPC) standard was set during 1990. A PC that met the minimum MPC standard could be marketed with the MPC logo, giving consumers an easy-to-understand specification to look for. Software that could operate on the most minimally MPC-compliant PC would be guaranteed to operate on any MPC. The MPC level 2 and MPC level 3 standards were set later, but the term &quot;MPC compliant&quot; never became popular. After MPC level 3 during 1996, no further MPC standards were established.

==Challenges to Wintel domination==

By the late 1990s, the success of Microsoft Windows had driven rival commercial operating systems into near-extinction, and had ensured that the &quot;IBM PC compatible&quot; computer was the dominant computing platform. This meant that if a developer made their software only for the Wintel platform, they would still be able to reach the vast majority of computer users. The only major competitor to Windows with more than a few percentage points of market share was Apple Inc.&#x27;s Macintosh. The Mac started out billed as &quot;the computer for the rest of us&quot;, but high prices and closed architecture drove the Macintosh into an education and desktop publishing niche, from which it only emerged in the mid-2000s. By the mid-1990s the Mac&#x27;s market share had dwindled to around 5% and introducing a new rival operating system had become too risky a commercial venture. Experience had shown that even if an operating system was technically superior to Windows, it would be a failure in the market (BeOS and OS/2 for example). In 1989, Steve Jobs said of his new NeXT system, &quot;It will either be the last new hardware platform to succeed, or the first to fail.&quot; Four years later in 1993, NeXT announced it was ending production of the NeXTcube and porting NeXTSTEP to Intel processors.

Very early on in PC history, some companies introduced their own XT-compatible chipsets. For example, Chips and Technologies introduced their 82C100 XT Controller which integrated and replaced six of the original XT circuits: one 8237 DMA controller, one 8253 interrupt timer, one 8255 parallel interface controller, one 8259 interrupt controller, one 8284 clock generator, and one 8288 bus controller. Similar non-Intel chipsets appeared for the AT-compatibles, for example OPTi&#x27;s 82C206 or 82C495XLC which were found in many 486 and early Pentium systems. The x86 chipset market was very volatile though. In 1993, VLSI Technology had become the dominant market player only to be virtually wiped out by Intel a year later. Intel has been the uncontested leader ever since. As the &quot;Wintel&quot; platform gained dominance Intel gradually abandoned the practice of licensing its technologies to other chipset makers; in 2010 Intel was involved in litigation related to their refusal to license their processor bus and related technologies to other companies like Nvidia.

Companies such as AMD and Cyrix developed alternative x86 CPUs that were functionally compatible with Intel&#x27;s. Towards the end of the 1990s, AMD was taking an increasing share of the CPU market for PCs. AMD even ended up playing a significant role in directing the development of the x86 platform when its Athlon line of processors continued to develop the classic x86 architecture as Intel deviated with its NetBurst architecture for the Pentium 4 CPUs and the IA-64 architecture for the Itanium set of server CPUs. AMD developed AMD64, the first major extension not created by Intel, which Intel later adopted as x86-64. During 2006 Intel began abandoning NetBurst with the release of their set of &quot;Core&quot; processors that represented a development of the earlier Pentium III.

A major alternative to Wintel domination is the rise of alternative operating systems since the early 2000s, which marked as the start of the post-PC era. This would include both the rapid growth of the smartphones (using Android or iOS) as an alternative to the personal computer; and the increasing prevalence of Linux and Unix-like operating systems in the server farms of large corporations such as Google or Amazon.

==The IBM PC compatible today==

The term &quot;IBM PC compatible&quot; is not commonly used presently because many current mainstream desktop and laptop computers are based on the PC architecture, and IBM no longer makes PCs. The competing hardware architectures have either been discontinued or, like the Amiga, have been relegated to niche, enthusiast markets. In the past, the most successful exception was Apple&#x27;s Macintosh platform, which used non-Intel processors from its inception. Although Macintosh was initially based on the Motorola 68000 series, then transitioned to the PowerPC architecture, Macintosh computers transitioned to Intel processors beginning in 2006. Until 2020 Macintosh computers shared the same system architecture as their Wintel counterparts and could boot Microsoft Windows without a DOS Compatibility Card. However, with the transition to the internally developed ARM-based Apple silicon, they are again the exception to IBM compatibility.

The processor speed and memory capacity of modern PCs are many orders of magnitude greater than they were for the original IBM PC and yet backwards compatibility has been largely maintained a 32-bit operating system can still operate many of the simpler programs written for the OS of the early 1980s without needing an emulator, though an emulator like DOSBox now has near-native functionality at full speed (and is necessary for certain games which may run too fast on modern processors). Additionally, many modern PCs can still run DOS directly, although special options such as USB legacy mode and SATA-to-PATA emulation may need to be set in the BIOS setup utility. Computers using the UEFI might need to be set at legacy BIOS mode to be able to boot DOS. However, the BIOS/UEFI options in most mass-produced consumer-grade computers are very limited and cannot be configured to truly handle OSes such as the original variants of DOS.

The spread of the x86-64 architecture has further distanced current computers&#x27; and operating systems&#x27; internal similarity with the original IBM PC by introducing yet another processor mode with an instruction set modified for 64-bit addressing, but x86-64 capable processors also retain standard x86 compatibility.

<text>Gary Stanley Becker (; December 2, 1930 – May 3, 2014) was an American economist who received the 1992 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. He was a professor of economics and sociology at the University of Chicago, and was a leader of the third generation of the Chicago school of economics.

Becker was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1992 and received the United States Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2007. A 2011 survey of economics professors named Becker their favorite living economist over the age of 60, followed by Kenneth Arrow and Robert Solow. Economist Justin Wolfers called him &quot;the most important social scientist in the past 50 years.&quot;

Becker was one of the first economists to analyze topics that had been researched in sociology, including racial discrimination, crime, family organization, and rational addiction. He argued that many different types of human behavior can be seen as rational and utility-maximizing, including those that are often regarded as self-destructive or irrational. His approach also extended to altruistic aspects of human behavior, which he showed to sometimes have self-serving ends (when individuals&#x27; utility is properly defined and measured, that is). He was also among the foremost exponents of the study of human capital. According to Milton Friedman, he was &quot;the greatest social scientist who has lived and worked&quot; in the second part of the twentieth century.

==Career==
Becker was born to a Jewish family in Pottsville, Pennsylvania. He received a BA from Princeton University in 1951, completing a senior thesis titled &quot;The Theory of Multi-Country Trade&quot;. He then earned a PhD from the University of Chicago in 1955 with a thesis entitled &quot;The Economics of Discrimination&quot;. At Chicago, Becker was influenced by Milton Friedman, whom Becker called &quot;by far the greatest living teacher I have ever had&quot;. Becker credits Friedman&#x27;s course on microeconomics for helping to renew his interest in economics. Becker also noted that during his time at Chicago, there were several other economists that greatly influenced his future work, namely Gregg Lewis, T. W. Schultz, Aaron Director, and L. J. Savage. For a few years, Becker worked as an assistant professor at Chicago and conducted research there. Before turning 30, he moved to teach at Columbia University in 1957 while also conducting research at the National Bureau of Economic Research. In 1970 Becker returned to the University of Chicago, and in 1983 was offered a joint appointment by the Sociology Department of Chicago. In 1965 he was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association.

Becker was a founding partner of TGG Group, a business and philanthropy consulting company. Becker won the John Bates Clark Medal in 1967. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1972, a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1975, and a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1986. Becker was a member, and later the president of, the Mont Pelerin Society. Becker received the Nobel Prize in 1992 &quot;for having extended the domain of microeconomic analysis to a wide range of human behavior and interaction, including nonmarket behavior&quot;. Becker also received the National Medal of Science in 2000. Becker received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 2001, presented by Awards Council member and Nobel Prize laureate Leon M. Lederman.

A political conservative, he wrote a monthly column for &quot;Business Week&quot; from 1985 to 2004, alternating with liberal Princeton economist Alan Blinder. In 1996 Becker was a senior adviser to Republican presidential candidate Robert Dole. In December 2004, Becker started a joint weblog with Judge Richard Posner entitled &quot;The Becker-Posner Blog&quot;.

Becker&#x27;s first wife was Doria Slote. They were married from 1954 until her death in 1970. The marriage produced two daughters, Catherine Becker and Judy Becker. About ten years later, in 1980 Becker married Guity Nashat, a historian of the Middle East whose research interests overlapped his own.

In 2014 Becker died in Chicago, Illinois, aged 83. The same year, he was honored in a three-day conference organized at the University of Chicago.

==Economic analysis==
Becker&#x27;s work has been influential not only in economics but also other disciplines including sociology and demography. His most famous work is &quot;Human Capital&quot;, and he wrote on sociological topics as diverse as marriage, the family, criminal behavior, and racial discrimination.

===Discrimination===
Becker recognized that people (employers, customers, and employees) sometimes do not want to work with minorities because they have bias against the disadvantaged groups. He went on to say that discrimination increases a firm&#x27;s cost because in discriminating against certain workers, the employer would have to pay more to other workers so that work can proceed without the biased ones. If the employer employs the minority, low wages can be provided, but more people can be employed, and productivity can be increased.

===Politics===
Becker&#x27;s contributions to politics have come to be known as &quot;Chicago political economy&quot; of which he is considered one of the founding fathers.

Becker&#x27;s insight was to recognize that deadweight losses put a brake on predation. He took the well-known insight that deadweight losses are proportional to the square of the tax, and used it to argue that a linear increase in takings by a predatory interest group will provoke a non-linear increase in the deadweight losses its victim suffers. These rapidly increasing losses will prod victims to invest equivalent sums in resisting attempts on their wealth. The advance of predators, fueled by linear incentives, slows before the stiffening resistance of prey outraged by non-linear damages.

===Crime and punishment===
Jurist Richard Posner has stressed the enormous influence of Becker&#x27;s work which &quot;has turned out to be a fount of economic writing on crime and its control&quot;, as well as the analytics of crime and punishment.

While Becker acknowledged that many people operate under a high moral and ethical constraint, criminals rationally see that the benefits of their crime outweigh the cost which depends upon the probability of apprehension, conviction, and punishment, and their current set of opportunities. From a public policy perspective, since the cost of increasing a fine is trivial in comparison to the cost of increasing surveillance, one can conclude that the best policy is to maximize the fine and minimize surveillance.

===Human capital===
In his 1964 book &quot;Human capital theories&quot; Becker introduced the economic concept of human capital. This book is now a classic in economy research and Becker went on to become a defining proponent of the Chicago school of economics. The book was republished in 1975 and 1993. Becker considered labor economics to be part of capital theory. He mused that &quot;economists and plan-makers have fully agreed with the concept of investing on human beings&quot;.

=== Modern household economics ===
Together, Becker and Jacob Mincer founded Modern Household Economics, sometimes called the New Home Economics (NHE), in the 1960s at the labor workshop at Columbia University that they both directed. Shoshana Grossbard, who was a student of Becker at the University of Chicago, first published a history of the NHE at Columbia and Chicago in 2001. After receiving feedback from the NHE founders she revised her account.

Among the first publications in Modern Household Economics were Becker (1960) on fertility, Mincer (1962) on women&#x27;s labor supply, and Becker (1965) on the allocation of time. Students and faculty who attended the Becker-Mincer workshop at Columbia in the 1960s and have published in the NHE tradition include Andrea Beller, Barry Chiswick, Carmel Chiswick, Victor Fuchs, Michael Grossman, Robert Michael, June E. O&#x27;Neill, Sol Polachek, and Robert Willis. James Heckman was also influenced by the NHE tradition and attended the labor workshop at Columbia from 1969 until his move to the University of Chicago. The NHE may be seen as a subfield of family economics.

In 2013, responding to a lack of women in top positions in the United States, Becker told the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; reporter David Wessel, &quot;A lot of barriers [to women and blacks] have been broken down. That&#x27;s all for the good. It&#x27;s much less clear what we see today is the result of such artificial barriers. Going home to take care of the kids when the man doesn&#x27;t: Is that a waste of a woman&#x27;s time? There&#x27;s no evidence that it is.&quot; This view was criticized by Charles Jones, stating that, &quot;Productivity could be 9 percent to 15 percent higher, potentially, if all barriers were eliminated.&quot;

=== Home production ===
In the mid-1960s Becker and Kelvin Lancaster developed the economic concept of a household production function. Both assumed that consumers in a household receive utility from the goods they purchase. Such as for example, when consumers purchase raw food. If it is cooked, a utility arises from the meal. In 1981 Becker published &quot;Treatise on the Family&quot;, where he stressed the importance of division of labor and gains from specification.

=== Economics of the family ===
During Becker&#x27;s time at Chicago in the 1970s, he mostly focused on the family. He had previously done work on birth rates and family size, and he used this time to expand his understanding of how economics works within a family. Some specific family issues covered during this time were marriage, divorce, altruism toward other members of the family, investments by parents in their children, and long-term changes in what families do. All of Becker&#x27;s research on the family resulted in &quot;A Treatise on the Family&quot; (1981). Throughout the decade, he contributed new ideas and information, and in 1991 an expanded edition of the work was published. His research applies basic economic assumptions such as maximizing behavior, preferences, and equilibrium to the family. He analyzed determinants for marriage and divorce, family size, parents&#x27; allocation of time to their children, and changes in wealth over several generations. This publication was an extensive overview of the economics of the family and helped to unite economics with other fields like sociology and anthropology.

==== Rotten kid theorem ====
At the core of Becker&#x27;s economic theory on the family, which he developed on the basis of figures for United States families in 1981, is the &quot;rotten kid theorem&quot;. He applied the economics of an &quot;altruist&quot; to a family, wherein a person takes actions that improve the well-being of another person, despite more self-interested action being feasible. Becker pointed out that a parent foregoes higher income, by focusing on family work commitments in order to maximize a well-meaning objective. Becker also theorized that a child in a US family may be perfectly selfish because it maximizes its own utility. There have been attempts to test this economic thesis, in the course of which it was found that cross-generational families do not necessarily maximize their joint income.

===Organ markets===
A 2007 article by Gary Becker and Julio Jorge Elias entitled &quot;Introducing Incentives in the market for live and cadaveric organ donations&quot; posited that a free market could help solve the problem of a scarcity in organ transplants. Their economic modeling was able to estimate the price tag for human kidneys (about US$15,000) and human livers (about US$32,000). It is argued by critics that this particular market would exploit the underprivileged donors from the developing world.

<doc id="49808" wikidata="Q1057397" url="?curid=49808" title="Measures of national income and output">
<text>A variety of measures of national income and output are used in economics to estimate total economic activity in a country or region, including gross domestic product (GDP), Gross national income (GNI), net national income (NNI), and adjusted national income (NNI adjusted for natural resource depletion – also called as NNI at factor cost). All are specially concerned with counting the total amount of goods and services produced within the economy and by various sectors. The boundary is usually defined by geography or citizenship, and it is also defined as the total income of the nation and also restrict the goods and services that are counted. For instance, some measures count only goods &amp; services that are exchanged for money, excluding bartered goods, while other measures may attempt to include bartered goods by &quot;imputing&quot; monetary values to them. 

==National accounts==

Arriving at a figure for the total production of goods and services in a large region like a country entails a large amount of data-collection and calculation. Although some attempts were made to estimate national incomes as long ago as the 17th century,
the systematic keeping of national accounts, of which these figures are a part, only began in the 1930s, in the United States and some European countries. The impetus for that major statistical effort was the Great Depression and the rise of Keynesian economics, which prescribed a greater role for the government in managing an economy, and made it necessary for governments to obtain accurate information so that their interventions into the economy could proceed as well-informed as possible.

==Market value==

In order to count a good or service, it is necessary to assign value to it. The value that the measures of national income and output assign to a good or service is its market value – the price it fetches when bought or sold. The actual usefulness of a product (its use-value) is not measured – assuming the use-value to be any different from its market value.

Three strategies have been used to obtain the market values of all the goods and services produced: the product (or output) method, the expenditure method, and the income method. The product method looks at the economy on an industry-by-industry basis. The total output of the economy is the sum of the outputs of every industry. However, since an output of one industry may be used by another industry and become part of the output of that second industry, to avoid counting the item twice we use not the value output by each industry, but the value-added; that is, the difference between the value of what it puts out and what it takes in. The total value produced by the economy is the sum of the values-added by every industry.

The expenditure method is based on the idea that all products are bought by somebody or some organisation. Therefore, we sum up the total amount of money people and organisations spend in buying things. This amount must equal the value of everything produced. Usually, expenditures by private individuals, expenditures by businesses, and expenditures by government are calculated separately and then summed to give the total expenditure. Also, a correction term must be introduced to account for imports and exports outside the boundary.

The income method works by summing the incomes of all producers within the boundary. Since what they are paid is just the market value of their product, their total income must be the total value of the product. Wages, proprietor&#x27;s incomes, and corporate profits are the major subdivisions of income.

===Methods of measuring national income===
===Output===
The output approach focuses on finding the total output of a nation by directly finding the total value of all goods and services a nation produces.

Because of the complication of the multiple stages in the production of a good or service, only the final value of a good or service is included in the total output. This avoids an issue often called &#x27;double counting&#x27;, wherein the total value of a good is included several times in national output, by counting it repeatedly in several stages of production. In the example of meat production, the value of the good from the farm may be $10, then $30 from the butchers, and then $60 from the supermarket. The value that should be included in final national output should be $60, not the sum of all those numbers, $100. The values added at each stage of production over the previous stage are respectively $10, $20, and $30. Their sum gives an alternative way of calculating the value of final output.

Key formulae are:
GDP at market price = value of output in the economy - intermediate consumption
NNP at factor cost = GDP at market price - net indirect taxes - depreciation + net factor income from abroad

NDP at factor cost = compensation of employees + net interest + rental &amp; royalty income + profit of incorporated and unincorporated NDP at factor cost
===Expenditure===
The expenditure approach is basically an output accounting method. It focuses on finding the total output of a nation by finding the total amount of money spent. This is acceptable to economists, because, like income, the total value of all goods is equal to the total amount of money spent on goods. The basic formula for domestic output takes all the different areas in which money is spent within the region, and then combines them to find the total output.

formula_1

where:
C = Consumption (economics) (Household consumption expenditures / Personal consumption expenditures)
I = Investment (macroeconomics) / Gross private domestic investment
G = Government spending (Government consumption / Gross investment expenditures)
X = Exports (Gross exports of goods and services)
M = Imports (Gross imports of goods and services)

Note: (X - M) is often written as XN or less commonly as NX, both stand for &quot;net exports&quot;

The names of the measures consist of one of the words &quot;Gross&quot; or &quot;Net&quot;, followed by one of the words &quot;National&quot; or &quot;Domestic&quot;, followed by one of the words &quot;Product&quot;, &quot;Income&quot;, or &quot;Expenditure&quot;. All of these terms can be explained separately.

:&quot;Gross&quot; means total product, regardless of the use to which it is subsequently put.
:&quot;Net&quot; means &quot;Gross&quot; minus the amount that must be used to offset depreciation – ie., wear-and-tear or obsolescence of the nation&#x27;s fixed capital assets. &quot;Net&quot; gives an indication of how much product is actually available for consumption or new investment.

:&quot;Domestic&quot; means the boundary is geographical: we are counting all goods and services produced within the country&#x27;s borders, regardless of by whom.
:&quot;National&quot; means the boundary is defined by citizenship (nationality). We count all goods and services produced by the nationals of the country (or businesses owned by them) regardless of where that production physically takes place.
:The output of a French-owned cotton factory in Senegal counts as part of the Domestic figures for Senegal, but the National figures of France.

:&quot;Product&quot;, &quot;Income&quot;, and &quot;Expenditure&quot; refer to the three counting methodologies explained earlier: the product, income, and expenditure approaches. However, the terms are used loosely.
:&quot;Product&quot; is the general term, often used when any of the three approaches was actually used. Sometimes the word &quot;Product&quot; is used and then some additional symbol or phrase to indicate the methodology; so, for instance, we get &quot;Gross Domestic Product by income&quot;, &quot;GDP (income)&quot;, &quot;GDP(I)&quot;, and similar constructions.
:&quot;Income&quot; specifically means that the income approach was used.
:&quot;Expenditure&quot; specifically means that the expenditure approach was used.

All three counting methods should in theory give the same final figure.
However, in practice, minor differences are obtained from the three methods for several reasons, including changes in inventory levels and errors in the statistics. One problem for instance is that goods in inventory have been produced (therefore included in Product), but not yet sold (therefore not yet included in Expenditure). Similar timing issues can also cause a slight discrepancy between the value of goods produced (Product) and the payments to the factors that produced the goods (Income), particularly if inputs are purchased on credit, and also because wages are collected often after a period of production.

== Gross domestic product and gross national product ==

Gross domestic product (GDP) is defined as &quot;the value of all final goods and services produced in a country in 1 year&quot;.

Gross national product (GNP) is defined as &quot;the market value of all goods and services produced in one year by labour and property supplied by the residents of a country.&quot;

As an example, the table below shows some GDP and GNP, and NNI data for the United States:
*NDP: Net domestic product is defined as &quot;gross domestic product (GDP) minus depreciation of capital&quot;, similar to NNP.
* GDP per capita: Gross domestic product per capita is the average market value rendered per person. 
* GNI per capita: Gross national income per capita is related to average income per person and mean income.

==National income and welfare==
GDP per capita (per person) is often used as a measure of a person&#x27;s welfare. Countries with higher GDP may be more likely to also score high on other measures of welfare, such as life expectancy. However, there are serious limitations to the usefulness of GDP as a measure of welfare:
* Measures of GDP typically exclude unpaid economic activity, most importantly domestic work such as childcare. This leads to distortions; for example, a paid nanny&#x27;s income contributes to GDP, but an unpaid parent&#x27;s time spent caring for children will not, even though they are both carrying out the same economic activity.
* GDP takes no account of the inputs used to produce the output. For example, if everyone worked for twice the number of hours, then GDP might roughly double, but this does not necessarily mean that workers are better off as they would have less leisure time. Similarly, the impact of economic activity on the environment is not measured in calculating GDP.
* Comparison of GDP from one country to another may be distorted by movements in exchange rates. Measuring national income at purchasing power parity may overcome this problem at the risk of overvaluing basic goods and services, for example subsistence farming.
* GDP does not measure factors that affect quality of life, such as the quality of the environment (as distinct from the input value) and security from crime. This leads to distortions - for example, spending on cleaning up an oil spill is included in GDP, but the negative impact of the spill on well-being (e.g. loss of clean beaches) is not measured.
* GDP is the mean (average) wealth rather than median (middle-point) wealth. Countries with a skewed income distribution may have a relatively high per-capita GDP while the majority of its citizens have a relatively low level of income, due to concentration of wealth in the hands of a small fraction of the population. See Gini coefficient.

Because of this, other measures of welfare such as the Human Development Index (HDI), Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW), Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI), gross national happiness (GNH), and sustainable national income (SNI) are used.

<doc id="49810" wikidata="Q3235607" url="?curid=49810" title="USS Oregon (BB-3)">
<text>USS &quot;Oregon&quot; (BB-3) was the third and final member of the of pre-dreadnought battleships built for the United States Navy in the 1890s. The three ships were built as part of a modernization program aimed at strengthening the American fleet to prepare for a possible conflict with a European navy. Designed for short-range operations in defense of the United States, the three &quot;Indiana&quot;-class ships had a low freeboard and carried a main battery of four guns in a pair of gun turrets. &quot;Oregon&quot; and her sister ships were the first modern battleships built for the United States, though they suffered from significant stability and seakeeping problems owing to their small size and insufficient freeboard.

After entering service in 1896, &quot;Oregon&quot; briefly served with the Pacific Squadron before being transferred to the East Coast of the United States as tensions with Spain over Cuba grew in early 1898. She completed a journey around South America in the span of 66 days, arriving shortly after the start of the Spanish–American War. She thereafter took part in the blockade of Santiago de Cuba, which culminated in the Battle of Santiago de Cuba on 3 July, where &quot;Oregon&quot; contributed to the destruction of the Spanish squadron in Cuba. After the war, &quot;Oregon&quot; was deployed to the Asiatic Squadron, serving during the Philippine–American War and the Boxer Rebellion in Qing China. The ship returned to the United States in 1906, when she was decommissioned and placed in reserve for the next five years, during which she was modernized.

Reactivated in 1911, &quot;Oregon&quot; spent the next several years cruising off the West Coast of the United States, frequently going in and out of service. During the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War in 1918, she escorted a convoy for the Siberian expedition. The ship was decommissioned in 1919 and efforts by naval enthusiasts in the early 1920s led the Navy to loan &quot;Oregon&quot; to her namesake state for use as a museum ship. After the start of World War II, the Navy decided in late 1942 to scrap the ship for the war effort, but after work began the Navy requested the ship&#x27;s return for use as an ammunition hulk for the upcoming invasion of Guam in 1944. She remained off the island through the mid-1950s before being sold for scrap in 1956 and broken up in Japan.

== Design ==
In the late 1880s, the United States Navy&#x27;s senior commanders began to plan for the possibility of a conflict with a European naval power, eventually coming to the conclusion that a force of both short- and long-range battleships would be necessary to defend the country. Congress agreed to begin modernizing the Navy and authorized three small vessels—the ironclad battleship and the armored cruisers and . Three further ships, the , were authorized in 1890; these were to be the first installment of short-range battleships to meet the Navy&#x27;s plans. The ships proved to be disappointments in service, as they were badly overweight upon completion, their low freeboard hampered operations at sea, and they handled poorly. They were nevertheless the first modern battleships for the American fleet.

&quot;Oregon&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced as designed and up to at full load. The ship was powered by two-shaft triple-expansion steam engines rated at and four coal-fired fire-tube boilers, generating a top speed of . She had a cruising radius of at a speed of . As built, she was fitted with a heavy military mast, this was later supplemented by a stern cage mast in 1910–1911. She had a crew of 32 officers and 441 enlisted men, which increased to a total of 586–636 officers and enlisted.

The ship was armed with a main battery of four /35 caliber guns in two twin gun turrets on the centerline, one forward and aft. The secondary battery consisted of eight /35 cal. guns, which were placed in four twin wing turrets. These were supported by a battery of six /40 cal. guns in a casemate battery amidships. For close-range defense against torpedo boats, she carried twenty 6-pounder guns and six 1-pounder guns in individual mounts. As was standard for capital ships of the period, &quot;Oregon&quot; carried  torpedo tubes in above-water mounts, though the number is unclear. According to &quot;Conway&#x27;s All the World&#x27;s Fighting Ships&quot; and the US Navy&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships&quot;, she was fitted with six tubes, though the naval historian Norman Friedman states she was ordered with seven but completed with five.

&quot;Oregon&quot;″s main armored belt was thick over the magazines and the machinery spaces and was reduced to at the bow and stern. The main battery gun turrets had thick sides, and the supporting barbettes had the same thickness of armor plate on their exposed sides. The 8 in turrets had 6 in of armor plating and the casemate battery had . The conning tower had thick sides.

== Service history ==
Congress authorized three &quot;Indiana&quot;-class battleships on 30 June 1890, and in the authorization, specified that one of the ships was to be built on the West Coast of the United States. Therefore, after the first two vessels— and —were awarded to William Cramp &amp; Sons of Philadelphia, the contract for the third was given to Union Iron Works in San Francisco. Her keel was laid down on 19 November 1891 and her completed hull was launched on 26 October 1893. After completing fitting-out, she was commissioned into the fleet on 15 July 1896. She then completed sea trials as part of the Pacific Squadron, where she served for the next year.

On 15 February 1898, the armored cruiser &quot;Maine&quot; exploded in Havana, Cuba during a period of rising tensions between the United States and Spain, which possessed Cuba as part of its colonial empire. &quot;Oregon&quot;, which was in dry dock at the time, was refloated the next day and placed under the command of Captain Charles Edgar Clark. Initial reports blamed a Spanish naval mine, and as the threat of war between the two countries grew, &quot;Oregon&quot; was ordered to steam to the East Coast of the United States to strengthen the North Atlantic Squadron. She steamed south to San Francisco, California to load ammunition on 9 March, departing ten days later for the long voyage around South America, a distance of some . &quot;Oregon&quot; reached Callao, Peru on 4 April, where she took on a fresh load of coal before continuing on the journey.

Clark decided to skip the scheduled coaling stop in Valparaíso, Chile, electing to proceed to the Strait of Magellan directly, which the ship reached on 16 April. A severe storm complicated her passage through the hazardous waters and she was forced to drop anchor overnight to avoid running aground, but she reached Punta Arenas, Chile, the next morning. There, she joined the gunboat , which was also en route to join the North Atlantic Squadron. After both ships replenished their coal stocks there, they got underway for Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on 21 April; false rumors of a Spanish torpedo boat in the area kept the ships&#x27; gun crews at their stations. The ships reached Rio de Janeiro on 30 April, where they learned of the state of war between the United States and Spain. They departed on 4 May, stopped briefly in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil, and then coaled in Barbados on 18 May. &quot;Oregon&quot; arrived in Jupiter, Florida on 24 May, where she met other elements of the North Atlantic Squadron. In the course of the voyage, which lasted sixty-six days, &quot;Oregon&quot; had traveled some . One long term result of this trip, which had received extensive press coverage, was public pressure for the construction of a Panama Canal to shorten future trans-oceanic repositionings.

=== Spanish–American War ===

&quot;Oregon&quot; sailed to Key West on 26 May, where she joined the rest of the North Atlantic Squadron, under the command of Rear Admiral William T. Sampson. By that time, the Flying Squadron, under Commodore Winfield Scott Schley&#x27;s command, had located the Spanish squadron that had sailed to Cuba at the start of the war and had blockaded it in Santiago de Cuba. The Spanish squadron was commanded by Rear Admiral Pascual Cervera y Topete and consisted of the armored cruisers , , and and the destroyers and . &quot;Oregon&quot; arrived off that port on 1 June, and over the course of the month, took part in bombardments of Spanish positions around the city and helped to maintain the blockade.

At 08:45 on 3 July, Cervera sortied with his flag aboard &quot;Infanta Maria Teresa&quot;, followed by &quot;Cristóbal Colón&quot;, &quot;Vizcaya&quot; and &quot;Almirante Oquendo&quot;, with the two destroyers bringing up the rear. The Spaniards cleared the roadstead at 09:35; luckily for the Spanish, &quot;New York&quot;—Sampson&#x27;s flagship—was out of position at the time and &quot;Massachusetts&quot; was replenishing her coal at Guantánamo Bay. Lookouts aboard the armored cruiser spotted Cervera approaching and fired one of her guns to warn the other American ships, which quickly ordered their crews to general quarters and initiated the Battle of Santiago de Cuba. As the Spanish ships attempted to break out to the west, Cervera charged at &quot;Brooklyn&quot; with &quot;Infanta Maria Teresa&quot; to delay the American pursuit and give his other ships time to escape. The Spanish coastal batteries also contributed their fire in the first stage of the battle but had little effect.

&quot;Oregon&quot; took the lead in the ensuing chase as she was the only large American ship which had good steam pressure when the battle began. The cruiser &quot;Brooklyn&quot; had uncoupled two of her four engines, but could still achieve and was right behind her. Heavy American gunfire had set &quot;Infanta Maria Theresa&quot; on fire, and, fearing a magazine explosion, Cervara ordered her run aground at 10:25. &quot;Almirante Oquendo&quot;″s captain issued similar instructions five minutes later, as his ship, too, was burning badly. &quot;Vizcaya&quot; was also forced ashore shortly thereafter, striking her colors to surrender at 10:36. Meanwhile, the two Spanish destroyers had also been badly damaged by the American battleships; &quot;Indiana&quot; had nearly cut &quot;Plutón&quot; in half with a 13-inch shell, forcing her to run aground, where she exploded. And &quot;Furor&quot; had been savaged by &quot;Oregon&quot;″s, ″s, and &quot;Indiana&quot;″s secondary batteries, leading her crew to surrender to the gunboat .

Only &quot;Cristóbal Colón&quot;, which had a lead at that point, was still running westward. &quot;Oregon&quot; and &quot;Texas&quot; followed &quot;Brooklyn&quot; as they chased &quot;Cristóbal Colón&quot;; the Americans slowly caught up to the fleeing Spanish cruiser and engaged her at long range. &quot;Cristóbal Colón&quot;, which had not been fitted with her main armament before being sent to Cuba, could not return fire, and her commander realized his hopeless position. At 13:20, he turned to shore and struck his flag, indicating his surrender, and the crew scuttled the ship. &quot;Oregon&quot; was not hit in the action, owing in large part to the poor quality of Spanish shooting. With the destruction of Cervera&#x27;s squadron and American successes in Cuba and the Philippines, Spain sued for peace on 17 July, and the war ended on 12 August with the Treaty of Paris.

=== Asiatic Station ===

After the war, &quot;Oregon&quot; steamed to New York for an overhaul, after which she was assigned to the Asiatic Squadron in October. She reached Manila in the Philippines on 18 March 1899 and operated there for the next year during the Philippine–American War. During this period, she assisted with the blockade of Manila and Lingayen Gulf and supported the capture of the city of Vigan. On 13 February 1900, &quot;Oregon&quot; departed for a visit to Japan that lasted into May, when she steamed to Hong Kong. By that time, the Boxer Rebellion had broken out in Qing China, and the ship was ordered to steam to Taku, China, on 23 June to reinforce the Eight-Nation Alliance forces that were gathering there. While passing through the Bohai Strait on 28 June, she struck an uncharted rock, running hard aground. She remained on the rock for a week before being re-floated on 5 July. After completing temporary repairs, she steamed to Kure, Japan to be dry-docked for permanent repairs on 17 July.

&quot;Oregon&quot; got underway again on 29 August for operations along the coast of China. She patrolled off the mouth of the Yangtze River and was then stationed at Wusong in Shanghai, China until 5 May 1901. That day, she departed to return to the United States for a refit, sailing first to Yokohama, Japan, and then to Honolulu, Hawaii. From there, she steamed to San Francisco, arriving there on 12 June. She then steamed north to the Puget Sound Navy Yard, which she reached on 6 July. She remained there for a year and a half before departing in early 1903 for China. She arrived in Hong Kong on 18 March, and over the course of the next three years, she served on the Asiatic Station, visiting ports in China, Japan, and the Philippines. The period passed uneventfully for &quot;Oregon&quot;, and she returned to the United States in February 1906. She was decommissioned in Puget Sound on 27 April.

=== Later career ===
The ship remained out of service for the next five years. She received a fairly minimal modernization during her period in reserve, which included the installation of a cage main mast. She also had her slow-firing 6-inch guns removed and a battery of twelve quick-firing guns was installed to improve her defenses against torpedo-boats, which had grown in size and power since &quot;Oregon&quot;″s construction. These were placed in single mounts, with four in an open battery atop the deckhouse amidships, one on each 8-inch turret and two on the 13-inch turrets apiece. Her small size and cramped decks prevented the more thorough modernization of her superstructure that the later American pre-dreadnought battleships received at this time.

On 29 August 1911, &quot;Oregon&quot; was recommissioned, but she remained assigned to the reserve fleet until October, when she got underway for San Diego, California. Over the next two years, she cruised off the West Coast but saw no events of note. She was placed &quot;in ordinary&quot; on 9 April 1913 in Bremerton, Washington before being formally returned to the reserve fleet on 16 September 1914, though she remained in partial commission. She was fully commissioned again on 2 January 1915 to participate in the Panama–Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco. She was again reduced to the reserve fleet on 11 February 1916, remaining there until 7 April 1917, though she was still in partial commission. This period was spent in San Francisco, and 7 April she was once again returned to full commission, the United States having entered World War I the day before. She saw no activity during the war, but she was used to escort the troop ships carrying the force for the Siberian expedition that intervened in the Russian Civil War in 1918.

After returning from Russia, &quot;Oregon&quot; was decommissioned again on 12 June 1919 before being recommissioned briefly from 21 August to 4 October. During this period, she hosted President Woodrow Wilson during a review of the Pacific Fleet when it arrived in Seattle, Washington. She was assigned the hull number of &quot;BB-3&quot; on 17 July 1920 when the Navy adopted the system. Beginning in 1921, a group of naval enthusiasts embarked on a campaign to have &quot;Oregon&quot; preserved as a museum ship, to be based somewhere in her namesake state. The Washington Naval Treaty, signed in 1922, required &quot;Oregon&quot; to be demilitarized, and she was accordingly disarmed in 1923, being pronounced compliant with the terms of the treaty on 4 January 1924. She was listed on the Naval Vessel Register as an &quot;unclassified&quot; relic. The Navy loaned the ship to Oregon in June 1925, and she was moored in Portland and restored as a museum vessel.

===Fate===
&quot;Oregon&quot; was redesignated with the hull number IX-22 on 17 February 1941. After the United States entered World War II with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, the Navy determined that &quot;Oregon&quot; ought to be sold for scrap to free resources for the war effort. She was accordingly struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 2 November 1942 and was sold to ship breakers on 7 December. In March 1943, she was towed to Kalama, Washington to be broken up, but after the work began the Navy decided that &quot;Oregon&quot; would be of use during the planned reconquest of Guam scheduled for mid-1944, either as a storage hulk or as a breakwater. The Navy requested that the breakers stop after the superstructure had been cleared and her internal fittings and equipment had been removed and to return her. She was then loaded with ammunition to support the forces that would invade Guam and towed there as part of the invasion fleet.

The vessel remained moored in Guam through the end of the war in 1945 and for several years thereafter. During this period, on the night of 14–15 November 1948, &quot;Oregon&quot; broke free from her moorings during Typhoon Agnes and drifted away. After an extensive search, aircraft located the vessel adrift some southeast of Guam. The ship was towed back to Guam, and she remained there until 1956, when on 15 March she was sold to Massey Supply Corporation, which in turn resold her to Iwai Sanggo Company of Kawasaki, Japan. She was then towed there and broken up.

Several parts of the ship remain in Portland; her military foremast was erected in 1956 at the Tom McCall Waterfront Park and her wheel is held in the collection of the Oregon Historical Society. Both of her funnels also survive, but are not on public display.

<text>Avro (an initialism of the founder&#x27;s name) was a British aircraft manufacturer. Its designs include the Avro 504, used as a trainer in the First World War, the Avro Lancaster, one of the pre-eminent bombers of the Second World War, and the delta wing Avro Vulcan, a stalwart of the Cold War.

Avro was founded in 1910 by Alliott Verdon Roe at the Brownsfield Mill on Great Ancoats Street in Manchester. The company remained based primarily in Lancashire throughout its 53 years of existence, with key development and manufacturing sites in Alexandra Park, Chadderton, Trafford Park, and Woodford, Greater Manchester. The company was merged into Hawker Siddeley Aviation in 1963, although the Avro name has been used for some aircraft since then.
==History==

===Early history===

One of the world&#x27;s first aircraft builders, A.V. Roe and Company was established on 1 January 1910 at Brownsfield Mill, Great Ancoats Street, Manchester, by Alliott Verdon Roe and his brother Humphrey Verdon Roe. Humphrey&#x27;s contribution was chiefly financial and organizational; funding it from the earnings of the family webbing business and acting as managing director until he joined the RFC in 1917. Alliot had already constructed a successful aircraft, the Roe I Triplane, named &quot;The Bullseye&quot; after a brand of braces manufactured by Humphrey. The railway arch where A.V. Roe in 1909 built and achieved the first all-British powered flight still stands in the Lee Valley Park on the Walthamstow Marshes. In 1911, Roy Chadwick began work as Alliott&#x27;s personal assistant and the firm&#x27;s draughtsman and, in 1918, he was appointed Chief Designer.

The first Avro aircraft to be produced in any quantity was the Avro E or Avro 500, first flown in March 1912, of which 18 were manufactured, most for the newly formed Royal Flying Corps. The company also built the world&#x27;s first aircraft with enclosed crew accommodation in 1912, the monoplane Type F and the biplane Avro Type G in 1912, neither progressing beyond the prototype stage. The Type 500 was developed into the Avro 504, first flown in September 1913. A small number were bought by the War Office before the outbreak of World War I, and the type saw some front-line service in the early months of the war, but it is best known as a training aircraft, serving in that role until 1933. Production lasted 20 years and totalled 8,340 aircraft from several factories: Hamble, Failsworth, Miles Platting and Newton Heath.

===Interwar years===
After the boom in orders during the First World War, the lack of new work in peacetime caused severe financial problems and in August 1920, 68.5% of the company&#x27;s shares were acquired by nearby Crossley Motors which had an urgent need for more factory space for automotive vehicle body building. 

In 1924, the company left Alexandra Park Aerodrome in south Manchester where test flying had taken place since 1918; the site was used for a mixture of recreation and housing development. A rural site to the south of the city was found at New Hall Farm, Woodford in Cheshire, which continued to be used by aviation company BAE Systems until March 2011; the site has now been earmarked for a mixed use development. 

In 1928 Crossley Motors sold AVRO to Armstrong Siddeley Holdings Ltd. In 1928 A.V. Roe resigned from the company he had founded and formed the Saunders-Roe company, which after World War II developed several radical designs for combat jets, and, eventually, a range of powerful hovercraft. 

In 1935 Avro became a subsidiary of Hawker Siddeley.

===Second World War===

Maintaining their skills in designing trainer aircraft, the company built a more robust biplane called the Avro Tutor in the 1930s which the Royal Air Force (RAF) also bought in quantity. A twin piston-engined airliner called the Anson followed but as tensions rose again in Europe the firm&#x27;s emphasis returned to combat aircraft. The Avro Manchester, Lancaster, and Lincoln were particularly famous Avro designs. Over 7,000 Lancasters were built and their bombing capabilities led to their use in the famous &quot;Dam Busters&quot; raid. Of the total, nearly half were built at Avro&#x27;s Woodford (Stockport) and Chadderton (Oldham) sites, with some 700 Lancasters built at the Avro &quot;shadow&quot; factory next to Leeds Bradford Airport (formerly Yeadon Aerodrome), northwest Leeds. This factory employed 17,500 workers at a time when the population of Yeadon was just 10,000. It was the largest building in Europe at the time, at , and its roof was disguised by the addition of fields and hedges to hide it from enemy planes. The old taxiway from the factory to the runway is still evident.

The Avro Lancaster carried the heaviest bomb loads of the war, including the Grand Slam bomb.

===Postwar developments===
The civilian Lancastrian and maritime reconnaissance Shackleton were derived from the successful Lancaster design. The Tudor was a pressurised but problematic post-war Avro airliner which faced strong competition from designs by Bristol, Canadair, Douglas, Handley Page, and Lockheed. With the same wings and engines as the Lincoln, it achieved only a short (34 completed) production run following a first flight in June 1945 and the cancellation of an order from BOAC. The older Avro York was somewhat more successful in both the RAF and in commercial service, being distinguished by a fuselage square in cross-section. Both Tudors and Yorks played an important humanitarian part in the Berlin Airlift.

The postwar Vulcan bomber, originally designed as a nuclear-strike aircraft, was used to maintain the British nuclear deterrent, armed with the Avro Blue Steel stand-off nuclear bomb. The Vulcan saw service as a conventional bomber during the British campaign to recapture the Falkland Islands in 1982. Several Vulcans are prized as museum exhibits.

A twin turboprop airliner, the Avro 748, was developed during the 1950s and sold widely to airlines and governments across the globe, powered by two Rolls-Royce Dart engines. The RAF bought 6 for use by the Queen&#x27;s Flight and a variant with a rear-loading ramp and a &quot;kneeling&quot; main undercarriage was sold to the RAF (31 aircraft) as the Andover.

===Avro regional jets===

The Avro name would subsequently be resurrected by British Aerospace when this aircraft manufacturer renamed its BAe 146 family of regional jetliners as Avro regional jets (Avro RJ). Three differently sized versions of the four engine jetliner were produced: the Avro RJ70, the Avro RJ85 and the largest example, the Avro RJ100.

===Avro Canada===

In 1945, Hawker Siddeley Group purchased the former Victory Aircraft firm in Malton, Ontario, and renamed the operation A.V. Roe Canada Limited. Commonly known as Avro Canada, it was actually a subsidiary of the Hawker Siddeley Group and used the Avro name for trading purposes.

===Amalgamation===
When the company was absorbed into Hawker Siddeley Aviation in July 1963 following the 1957 Defence White Paper, the Avro name ceased to be used. The brand still had a strong heritage appeal, and as mentioned above the marketing name &quot;Avro RJ&quot; (regional jet) was used by British Aerospace from 1994 to 2001 for production of the RJ70, RJ85 and RJ100 models which were respectively based on the BAe 146-100, BAe 146-200 and BAe 146-300. This four engine jet aircraft type is sometimes also loosely called the &quot;Avro 146&quot;.

The BAe ATP (Advanced Turbo Prop) design evolved from the Avro 748 and examples continue in use on shorter, mainly domestic, scheduled air services. A few Avro 504s, Tutors, Ansons and Lancasters are maintained in flying condition. At 39 years, the Shackleton held the distinction of being the aircraft with the longest period of active RAF service, until overtaken by the English Electric Canberra in 1998.

==Car production==
Avro also built motor vehicles in the immediate post-World War 1 era, including the three-wheeler Harper Runabout, as well as their own light car. Powered by a 1,330 cc 4-cylinder engine, wood and aluminium were used in an integral construction similar to an aircraft. Approximately 100 were built.

In 1927 Alliott Verdon-Roe designed a two-wheeler car powered by a 350 cc Villiers air-cooled engine. An outrigger wheel kept the car upright when stationary. The &quot;Mobile&quot; did not go into production.

<doc id="49813" wikidata="Q49164" url="?curid=49813" title="Amherst, Massachusetts">
<text>Amherst () is a city in Hampshire County, Massachusetts, United States, in the Connecticut River valley. Amherst has a council–manager form of government, and is considered a city under Massachusetts state law. Amherst is one of several Massachusetts municipalities that have city forms of government but retain &quot;The Town of&quot; in their official names. At the 2020 census, the population was 39,263, making it the highest populated municipality in Hampshire County (although the county seat is Northampton). The town is home to Amherst College, Hampshire College, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst, three of the Five Colleges. 

Amherst has three census-designated places: Amherst Center, North Amherst, and South Amherst.

Amherst is part of the Springfield, Massachusetts Metropolitan Statistical Area. Lying north of the city of Springfield, Amherst is considered the northernmost town in the Hartford–Springfield Metropolitan Region, &quot;The Knowledge Corridor&quot;. Amherst is also located in the Pioneer Valley, which encompasses Hampshire, Hampden and Franklin counties.

== Name ==
The name of the town is pronounced without the &quot;h&quot; (&quot;AM-erst&quot;) by natives and long-time residents, giving rise to the local saying, &quot;only the &#x27;h&#x27; is silent&quot;, in reference both to the pronunciation and to the town&#x27;s politically active populace.

==History==
The earliest known document of the lands now comprising Amherst is the deed of purchase dated December 1658 between John Pynchon of Springfield and three native inhabitants, referred to as Umpanchla, Quonquont, and Chickwalopp. According to the deed, &quot;ye Indians of Nolwotogg (Norwottuck) upon ye River of Quinecticott (Connecticut)&quot; sold the entire area in exchange for &quot;two Hundred fatham of Wampam &amp; Twenty fatham, and one large Coate at Eight fatham wch Chickwollop set of, of trusts, besides severall small giftes&quot; .

Amherst was first visited by Europeans no later than 1665, when Nathaniel Dickinson surveyed the lands for its mother town Hadley. The first permanent English settlements arrived in 1727. It remained a part of Hadley, even when it gained precinct status in 1734, before becoming a township in 1759.

When it incorporated, the colonial governor assigned the town the name &quot;Amherst&quot; after Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst. Many a colonial governor at the time scattered his name during the influx of new town applications, which is why several towns in the Northeast bear the name. Amherst was Commander-in-Chief of the forces of North America during the French and Indian War who, according to popular legend, singlehandedly won Canada for the British and banished France from North America. Popular belief has it that he supported the American side in the Revolutionary War and resigned his commission rather than fight for the British. Baron Amherst actually remained in the service of the Crown during the war—albeit in Great Britain rather than North America—where he organized the defense against the proposed Franco-Spanish Armada of 1779. Nonetheless, his previous service in the French and Indian War meant he remained popular in New England. Amherst is also infamous for recommending, in a letter to a subordinate, the use of smallpox-covered blankets in warfare against the Native Americans along with any &quot;other method that can serve to Extirpate this Execrable Race&quot;. For this reason, there have been occasional ad hoc movements to rename the town.

Amherst celebrated its 250th anniversary in 2009. The Amherst 250th Anniversary Celebration Committee and Amherst Historical Society organized events, including a book published by the Historical Society and written by Elizabeth M. Sharpe, &quot;Amherst A to Z&quot;.

In 2021 the City Council voted to establish the Amherst African Heritage Reparation Assembly to study reparations for the town&#x27;s black residents. In 2022, at the Assembly&#x27;s suggestion, the City Council approved $2,000,000 of initial funding for reparations.

===History of town government ===
The Town converted from an open town meeting to a representative town meeting form in 1938. In 1953, Amherst voters passed the &quot;Town Manager Act&quot;, which established the office of a town manager and reduced a number of elected positions. In 1995, a charter commission was approved to study Amherst&#x27;s government; the charter majority recommended a seven-person Council and a mayor, while also maintaining a reduced size representative Town Meeting (150). This proposal failed in two successive votes.

In 2001, the League of Women Voters Amherst made a number of recommendations that were adopted in 2001 in the form of a revised &quot;Amherst Town Government Act&quot;. An effort shortly thereafter to amend the charter to eliminate the town meeting, and establish an elected mayor and a nine-member Town Council, was rejected by voters twice, first in spring 2003 by fourteen votes and again on March 29, 2005 by 252 votes.

In 2016, a charter commission was approved to study Amherst&#x27;s government. A majority of commissioners proposed a charter that would establish a 13-member council with no mayor. This proposal was voted on the March 27, 2018 local ballot, and was passed by over 1,000 votes, a 58% majority. The new town council was sworn in on December 2, 2018.

==Infrastructure==
=== Transportation ===
====Bus====
The Pioneer Valley Transit Authority, funded by local governments and the Five College Consortium, provides public transportation in the area, operated by University of Massachusetts Transportation Services. Service runs well into the early morning hours on weekends when school is in session. Students attending any colleges in the Five Colleges Consortium have a fee included in their tuition bills (service fee for UMass Amherst students and student activity fees for the other colleges) for each semester that prepays their bus fares for the semester. UMass Transit buses operate via a proof-of-payment system, in which there are random inspections of student identification cards and bus passes and transfers.

Peter Pan Bus Lines provides service between Amherst and Springfield, Boston, and other locations in New England. Megabus provides service between New York City, Amherst, and Burlington, Vermont.

<text>Two ships of the United States Navy have borne the name USS &quot;Salt Lake City&quot;, in honor of the city in Utah which has served successively as the capital of the Provisional State of Deseret, the Utah Territory, and the 45th state. See Salt Lake City, Utah.

*The first was a &quot;Pensacola&quot;-class treaty cruiser, a heavy cruiser commissioned in 1929, and saw much action in World War II before being used in atomic bomb tests in 1946.
*The second was a attack submarine, decommissioned in November 2006 at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.

<text>Year 896 ([[Roman numerals|DCCCXCVI]]) was a leap year starting on Thursday of the Julian calendar.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===
==== Europe ====
* February – King Arnulf of Carinthia invades Italy at the head of an East Frankish expeditionary army. He storms Rome (the Leonine City), and has himself crowned Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Formosus at St. Peter&#x27;s. Arnulf sets out to establish his authority in Spoleto, but suffers a stroke; he is forced to call off the campaign, and returns to Bavaria.
* March – King Lambert II proceeds to re-conquer Italy. Heading north, he captures western Lombardy, and decapitates count Maginulf of Milan. In the meantime, the deposed king Berengar I recovers Verona (March of Friuli) from Arnulf&#x27;s candidate, count Walfred of Verona, who dies in office with &quot;great fidelity to the emperor&quot;.
* Battle of Southern Buh: Bulgarian forces under Simeon I (&#x27;the Great&#x27;) defeat the Magyars, near the banks of the Southern Buh river (modern Ukraine). The Magyars withdraw from Bulgaria, and are forced to migrate to new pastures. Led by Árpád, they settle in the Carpathian Basin (modern Hungary).
* Summer – Battle of Boulgarophygon: Simeon I invades the Theme of Thrace (in the southeastern Balkans). The Byzantines transfer a new army to Europe, to deal with the Bulgarian threat. The armies clash at Boulgarophygon (modern Turkey); the Byzantines are completely destroyed in battle.
* November – Lambert II and Berengar I agree to sign a treaty at Pavia. Berengar receives the realm between the Adda and the Po, while the rest stays under the control of Lambert (including the March of Tuscany). They share Bergamo, and Lambert pledges to marry Gisela, Berengar&#x27;s daughter.
* Prince Klonimir, pretender to the throne of the Serbian Principality, is defeated by his ruling cousin, Petar. He is recognized as sole ruler of Serbia by Simeon I, resulting in a 20-year peace and alliance (approximate date).

==== Britain ====
* Summer – King Alfred the Great orders the building of English warships (almost twice as long as the longships) on the Itchen at Southampton, against the Danish Viking raiders in Wessex.
* A Viking pirate army under Hastein (a son of Ragnar Lodbrok) ravages the Welsh kingdoms of Brycheiniog and Gwent (approximate date).

==== Arabian Empire ====
* Kharijite Rebellion: The Kharijite uprising against the Abbasid Caliphate in Jazira is ended. Caliph Al-Mu&#x27;tadid reunifies the entire province under central government, and installs his son and heir, Al-Muktafi, as governor.

==== China ====
* Emperor Zhao Zong appoints Li Keyong, a Shatuo military governor (&quot;jiedushi&quot;), as Prince of Jin. He becomes the first ruler of Jin (see 907) following the collapse of the Tang dynasty.

<text>The gross world product (GWP), also known as gross world income (GWI), is the combined gross national income (previously, the &quot;gross national product&quot;) of all the countries in the world. Because imports and exports balance exactly when considering the whole world, this also equals the total global gross domestic product (GDP). According to the World Bank, the 2013 nominal GWP was approximately 75.59 trillion United States dollars. In 2017, according to the CIA&#x27;s &quot;World Factbook&quot;, the GWP was around $80.27 trillion in nominal terms and totaled approximately 127.8 trillion international dollars in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP). The per capita PPP GWP in 2017 was approximately 17,500 international dollars according to the &quot;World Factbook&quot;. According to the World Bank, the 2020 GWP in current dollars was approximately $84.705 trillion.

==Recent growth==
The table below gives recent percentage values for overall GWP growth from 2006 through 2020, as well as an estimate for 2021, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)&#x27;s World Economic Outlook database. Data is given in terms of constant year-on-year prices.

==Historical and prehistorical estimates==
In 1998, economic historian J. Bradford DeLong estimated the total GWP in 1990 U.S. dollars for the main years between one million years BCE and 2000 CE (shown in the table below). 

Estimates from 2000 onwards are based on world GDP, PPP estimates in 2021 constant international dollars from the World Bank and subsequently converted to 1990 US$. &quot;Billion&quot; in the table below refers to the short scale usage of the term, where 1 billion = 1,000 million = 109.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Byzantine Empire ====
* July 29 – Sack of Thessalonica: A Muslim fleet, led by the Greek renegade Leo of Tripoli, appears outside Thessalonica and begins its attack after a short and silent inspection of the fortification of the city. After attacks from the sea for two days, the Saracens are able to storm the city walls, overcome the Thessalonians&#x27; resistance and capture the city. The sacking continues for a full week, before the raiders depart for their base in the Levant. Having freed 4,000 Muslim prisoners and captured 60 ships, gaining a large loot, they carry off 22,000 men and women as slaves. 
* Arab–Byzantine War: The Byzantines under Andronikos Doukas, along with Eustathios Argyros, campaign against the Abbasids and defeat the Muslim garrisons of Mopsuestia and Tarsus, near Marash (modern Turkey).
* Emperor Leo VI (the Wise) is forced to sign a peace treaty with Simeon I, ruler (&quot;knyaz&quot;) of the Bulgarian Empire. All Slavic-inhabited lands of Macedonia and southern Albania are ceded to the Bulgarians.

==== Europe ====
* Summer – King Louis IV (the Child) invites Kurszán, a Hungarian leader (&quot;gyula&quot;) of the Magyar tribal confederation, and his entourage to negotiate at the Fischa River, but they are killed in an ambush. 
* In Portugal, for the third time in less than 30 years, the Christians take control of Coimbra, this time for almost a century.
* Beginning of the &quot;Saeculum obscurum&quot; (&#x27;Dark Age&#x27;), a period of 60 years in which the papacy was heavily influenced by the powerful Theophylacti family, the counts of Tusculum.

==== Britain ====
* Prince Hywel ap Cadell of Seisyllwg (Wales) marries Princess Elen of Dyfed. The latter&#x27;s father, King Llywarch ap Hyfaidd, dies. The throne of Dyfed is claimed by Llywarch&#x27;s brother, Rhodri ap Hyfaidd, but he is probably forced to flee from Hywel&#x27;s armies.

==== Arabian Empire ====
* Winter – Shayban ibn Ahmad ibn Tulun succeeds his nephew Harun ibn Khumarawayh as emir of the Tulunid dynasty, who is killed in a mutiny during the invasion of Egypt by the Abbasid Caliphate.

==== China ====
* September 22 – The warlord Zhu Quanzhong kills Emperor Zhao Zong, along with his family and many ministers, after seizing control of the imperial government. Zhu places Zhao Zong&#x27;s 13-year-old son Ai (Li Zhou) on the imperial throne as a puppet ruler of the Tang dynasty.
* Zhu Quanzhong has Chang&#x27;an, the capital of the Tang dynasty and the largest city in the ancient world, destroyed, and moves the materials to Luoyang, which becomes the new capital.

=== By topic ===

==== Religion ====
* January 29 – Pope Sergius III succeeds Leo V and the deposed Antipope Christopher (both of whom are murdered or exiled) as the 119th pope of the Catholic Church. The ascension of Sergius marks the beginning of the Pornocracy (&#x27;rule of the whores&#x27;), which will last for 150 years. During this time, the clergy will be sidelined and rule over Rome is dominated by the Roman nobility.
* Sergius III allies himself with Theophylact I, count of Tusculum, who becomes ruler of Rome and the papal administration. Sergius rewards him (for his support and rise of power) with the position of &quot;sacri palatii vestararius&quot; and essentially becomes his puppet.

<text>In probability, and statistics, a multivariate random variable or random vector is a list or vector of mathematical variables each of whose value is unknown, either because the value has not yet occurred or because there is imperfect knowledge of its value. The individual variables in a random vector are grouped together because they are all part of a single mathematical system — often they represent different properties of an individual statistical unit. For example, while a given person has a specific age, height and weight, the representation of these features of &quot;an unspecified person&quot; from within a group would be a random vector. Normally each element of a random vector is a real number.

Random vectors are often used as the underlying implementation of various types of aggregate random variables, e.g. a random matrix, random tree, random sequence, stochastic process, etc.

Formally, a multivariate random variable is a column vector formula_1 (or its transpose, which is a row vector) whose components are random variables on the probability space formula_2, where formula_3 is the sample space, formula_4 is the sigma-algebra (the collection of all events), and formula_5 is the probability measure (a function returning each event&#x27;s probability).

==Probability distribution==

Every random vector gives rise to a probability measure on formula_6 with the Borel algebra as the underlying sigma-algebra. This measure is also known as the joint probability distribution, the joint distribution, or the multivariate distribution of the random vector.

The distributions of each of the component random variables formula_7 are called marginal distributions. The conditional probability distribution of formula_7 given formula_9 is the probability distribution of formula_7 when formula_9 is known to be a particular value.

The cumulative distribution function formula_12 of a random vector formula_13 is defined as
|cellpadding= 6
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA}}

where formula_14.

==Operations on random vectors==
Random vectors can be subjected to the same kinds of algebraic operations as can non-random vectors: addition, subtraction, multiplication by a scalar, and the taking of inner products.

===Affine transformations===
Similarly, a new random vector formula_15 can be defined by applying an affine transformation formula_16 to a random vector formula_17:

:formula_18, where formula_19 is an formula_20 matrix and formula_21 is an formula_22 column vector.

If formula_19 is an invertible matrix and formula_24 has a probability density function formula_25, then the probability density of formula_15 is

:formula_27.

===Invertible mappings===
More generally we can study invertible mappings of random vectors.

Let formula_28 be a one-to-one mapping from an open subset formula_29 of formula_6 onto a subset formula_31 of formula_6, let formula_28 have continuous partial derivatives in formula_29 and let the Jacobian determinant formula_35 of formula_28 be zero at no point of formula_29. Assume that the real random vector formula_17 has a probability density function formula_39 and satisfies formula_40. Then the random vector formula_41 is of probability density

:formula_42

where formula_43 denotes the indicator function and set formula_44 denotes support of formula_15.

==Expected value==
The expected value or mean of a random vector formula_17 is a fixed vector formula_47 whose elements are the expected values of the respective random variables.

==Covariance and cross-covariance==
===Definitions===
The covariance matrix (also called second central moment or variance-covariance matrix) of an formula_48 random vector is an formula_49 matrix whose (&quot;i,j&quot;)th element is the covariance between the &quot;i&quot; th and the &quot;j&quot; th random variables. The covariance matrix is the expected value, element by element, of the formula_49 matrix computed as formula_51, where the superscript T refers to the transpose of the indicated vector:
|cellpadding= 6
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA}}

By extension, the cross-covariance matrix between two random vectors formula_17 and formula_15 (formula_17 having formula_55 elements and formula_15 having formula_57 elements) is the formula_58 matrix
|cellpadding= 6
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA}}

where again the matrix expectation is taken element-by-element in the matrix. Here the (&quot;i,j&quot;)th element is the covariance between the &quot;i&quot; th element of formula_17 and the &quot;j&quot; th element of formula_15.

===Properties===
The covariance matrix is a symmetric matrix, i.e.
:formula_61.

The covariance matrix is a positive semidefinite matrix, i.e.
:formula_62.

The cross-covariance matrix formula_63 is simply the transpose of the matrix formula_64, i.e.
:formula_65.

===Uncorrelatedness===
Two random vectors formula_66 and formula_67 are called uncorrelated if
:formula_68.

They are uncorrelated if and only if their cross-covariance matrix formula_69 is zero.

==Correlation and cross-correlation==
===Definitions===
The correlation matrix (also called second moment) of an formula_48 random vector is an formula_49 matrix whose (&quot;i,j&quot;)th element is the correlation between the &quot;i&quot; th and the &quot;j&quot; th random variables. The correlation matrix is the expected value, element by element, of the formula_49 matrix computed as formula_73, where the superscript T refers to the transpose of the indicated vector:
|cellpadding= 6
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA}}

By extension, the cross-correlation matrix between two random vectors formula_17 and formula_15 (formula_17 having formula_55 elements and formula_15 having formula_57 elements) is the formula_58 matrix
|cellpadding= 6
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA}}

===Properties===
The correlation matrix is related to the covariance matrix by
:formula_81.
Similarly for the cross-correlation matrix and the cross-covariance matrix:
:formula_82

==Orthogonality==
Two random vectors of the same size formula_83 and formula_67 are called orthogonal if
:formula_85.

==Independence==

Two random vectors formula_17 and formula_15 are called independent if for all formula_88 and formula_89
:formula_90
where formula_91 and formula_92 denote the cumulative distribution functions of formula_17 and formula_15 andformula_95 denotes their joint cumulative distribution function. Independence of formula_17 and formula_15 is often denoted by formula_98.
Written component-wise, formula_17 and formula_15 are called independent if for all formula_101
:formula_102.

==Characteristic function==
The characteristic function of a random vector formula_103 with formula_104 components is a function formula_105 that maps every vector formula_106 to a complex number. It is defined by

:formula_107.

==Further properties==
===Expectation of a quadratic form===
One can take the expectation of a quadratic form in the random vector formula_17 as follows:

:formula_109

where formula_110 is the covariance matrix of formula_17 and formula_112 refers to the trace of a matrix — that is, to the sum of the elements on its main diagonal (from upper left to lower right). Since the quadratic form is a scalar, so is its expectation.

Proof: Let formula_113 be an formula_114 random vector with formula_115 and formula_116 and let formula_117 be an formula_118 non-stochastic matrix.

Then based on the formula for the covariance, if we denote formula_119 and formula_120, we see that:

:formula_121

Hence

:formula_122

which leaves us to show that

:formula_123

This is true based on the fact that one can cyclically permute matrices when taking a trace without changing the end result (e.g.: formula_124).

We see that

:formula_125

And since

:formula_126

is a scalar, then

:formula_127

trivially. Using the permutation we get:

:formula_128

and by plugging this into the original formula we get:

:formula_129

===Expectation of the product of two different quadratic forms===
One can take the expectation of the product of two different quadratic forms in a zero-mean Gaussian random vector formula_17 as follows:

:formula_131

where again formula_110 is the covariance matrix of formula_17. Again, since both quadratic forms are scalars and hence their product is a scalar, the expectation of their product is also a scalar.

==Applications==

===Portfolio theory===
In portfolio theory in finance, an objective often is to choose a portfolio of risky assets such that the distribution of the random portfolio return has desirable properties. For example, one might want to choose the portfolio return having the lowest variance for a given expected value. Here the random vector is the vector formula_134 of random returns on the individual assets, and the portfolio return &quot;p&quot; (a random scalar) is the inner product of the vector of random returns with a vector &quot;w&quot; of portfolio weights — the fractions of the portfolio placed in the respective assets. Since &quot;p&quot; = &quot;w&quot;Tformula_134, the expected value of the portfolio return is &quot;w&quot;TE(formula_134) and the variance of the portfolio return can be shown to be &quot;w&quot;TC&quot;w&quot;, where C is the covariance matrix of formula_134.

===Regression theory===
In linear regression theory, we have data on &quot;n&quot; observations on a dependent variable &quot;y&quot; and &quot;n&quot; observations on each of &quot;k&quot; independent variables &quot;xj&quot;. The observations on the dependent variable are stacked into a column vector &quot;y&quot;; the observations on each independent variable are also stacked into column vectors, and these latter column vectors are combined into a design matrix &quot;X&quot; (not denoting a random vector in this context) of observations on the independent variables. Then the following regression equation is postulated as a description of the process that generated the data:

:formula_138

where β is a postulated fixed but unknown vector of &quot;k&quot; response coefficients, and &quot;e&quot; is an unknown random vector reflecting random influences on the dependent variable. By some chosen technique such as ordinary least squares, a vector formula_139 is chosen as an estimate of β, and the estimate of the vector &quot;e&quot;, denoted formula_140, is computed as

:formula_141

Then the statistician must analyze the properties of formula_139 and formula_140, which are viewed as random vectors since a randomly different selection of &quot;n&quot; cases to observe would have resulted in different values for them.

===Vector time series===

The evolution of a &quot;k&quot;×1 random vector formula_17 through time can be modelled as a vector autoregression (VAR) as follows:

:formula_145

where the &quot;i&quot;-periods-back vector observation formula_146 is called the &quot;i&quot;-th lag of formula_17, &quot;c&quot; is a &quot;k&quot; × 1 vector of constants (intercepts), &quot;Ai&quot; is a time-invariant &quot;k&quot; × &quot;k&quot; matrix and formula_148 is a &quot;k&quot; × 1 random vector of error terms.

<text>A creole language, or simply creole, is a stable natural language that develops from the process of different languages simplifying and mixing into a new form (often a pidgin), and then that form expanding and elaborating into a full-fledged language with native speakers, all within a fairly brief period. While the concept is similar to that of a mixed or hybrid language, creoles are often characterized by a tendency to systematize their inherited grammar (e.g., by eliminating irregularities or regularizing the conjugation of otherwise irregular verbs). Like any language, creoles are characterized by a consistent system of grammar, possess large stable vocabularies, and are acquired by children as their native language. These three features distinguish a creole language from a pidgin. Creolistics, or creology, is the study of creole languages and, as such, is a subfield of linguistics. Someone who engages in this study is called a creolist.

The precise number of creole languages is not known, particularly as many are poorly attested or documented. About one hundred creole languages have arisen since 1500. These are predominantly based on European languages such as English and French due to the European Age of Discovery and the Atlantic slave trade that arose at that time. With the improvements in ship-building and navigation, traders had to learn to communicate with people around the world, and the quickest way to do this was to develop a pidgin; in turn, full creole languages developed from these pidgins. In addition to creoles that have European languages as their base, there are, for example, creoles based on Arabic, Chinese, and Malay.

The lexicon of a creole language is largely supplied by the parent languages, particularly that of the most dominant group in the social context of the creole&#x27;s construction. However, there are often clear phonetic and semantic shifts. On the other hand, the grammar that has evolved often has new or unique features that differ substantially from those of the parent languages.

==Overview==
A creole is believed to arise when a pidgin, developed by adults for use as a second language, becomes the native and primary language of their children – a process known as nativization. The pidgin-creole life cycle was studied by American linguist Robert Hall in the 1960s.

Some linguists, such as Derek Bickerton, posit that creoles share more grammatical similarities with each other than with the languages from which they are phylogenetically derived. However, there is no widely accepted theory that would account for those perceived similarities. Moreover, no grammatical feature has been shown to be specific to creoles.

Many of the creoles known today arose in the last 500 years, as a result of the worldwide expansion of European maritime power and trade in the Age of Discovery, which led to extensive European colonial empires. Like most non-official and minority languages, creoles have generally been regarded in popular opinion as degenerate variants or dialects of their parent languages. Because of that prejudice, many of the creoles that arose in the European colonies, having been stigmatized, have become extinct. However, political and academic changes in recent decades have improved the status of creoles, both as living languages and as object of linguistic study. Some creoles have even been granted the status of official or semi-official languages of particular political territories.

Linguists now recognize that creole formation is a universal phenomenon, not limited to the European colonial period, and an important aspect of language evolution.

Other scholars, such as Salikoko Mufwene, argue that pidgins and creoles arise independently under different circumstances, and that a pidgin need not always precede a creole nor a creole evolve from a pidgin. Pidgins, according to Mufwene, emerged in trade colonies among &quot;users who preserved their native vernaculars for their day-to-day interactions&quot;. Creoles, meanwhile, developed in settlement colonies in which speakers of a European language, often indentured servants whose language would be far from the standard in the first place, interacted extensively with non-European slaves, absorbing certain words and features from the slaves&#x27; non-European native languages, resulting in a heavily basilectalized version of the original language. These servants and slaves would come to use the creole as an everyday vernacular, rather than merely in situations in which contact with a speaker of the superstrate was necessary.

==History==
===Etymology===
The English term &quot;creole&quot; comes from , which is cognate with the and , all descending from the verb &quot;criar&quot; (&#x27;to breed&#x27; or &#x27;to raise&#x27;), all coming from Latin . The specific sense of the term was coined in the 16th and 17th century, during the great expansion in European maritime power and trade that led to the establishment of European colonies in other continents.

The terms and were originally qualifiers used throughout the Spanish and Portuguese colonies to distinguish the members of an ethnic group who were born and raised locally from those who immigrated as adults. They were most commonly applied to nationals of the colonial power, e.g. to distinguish (people born in the colonies from Spanish ancestors) from (those born in the Iberian Peninsula, i.e. Spain). However, in Brazil the term was also used to distinguish between (blacks born in Brazil from African slave ancestors) and (born in Africa). Over time, the term and its derivatives (Creole, Kréol, Kreyol, Kreyòl, Kriol, Krio, etc.) lost the generic meaning and became the proper name of many distinct ethnic groups that developed locally from immigrant communities. Originally, therefore, the term &quot;creole language&quot; meant the speech of any of those creole peoples.

===Geographic distribution===
As a consequence of colonial European trade patterns, most of the known European-based creole languages arose in coastal areas in the equatorial belt around the world, including the Americas, western Africa, Goa along the west of India, and along Southeast Asia up to Indonesia, Singapore, Macau, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Malaysia, Mauritius, Réunion, Seychelles and Oceania.

Many of those creoles are now extinct, but others still survive in the Caribbean, the north and east coasts of South America (The Guyanas), western Africa, Australia (see Australian Kriol language), the Philippines (see Chavacano), Island Countries such as Mauritius and Seychelles and in the Indian Ocean.

Atlantic Creole languages are based on European languages with elements from African and possibly Amerindian languages. Indian Ocean Creole languages are based on European languages with elements from Malagasy and possibly other Asian languages. There are, however, creoles like Nubi and Sango that are derived solely from non-European languages.

===Social and political status===
Because of the generally low status of the Creole peoples in the eyes of prior European colonial powers, creole languages have generally been regarded as &quot;degenerate&quot; languages, or at best as rudimentary &quot;dialects&quot; of the politically dominant parent languages. Because of this, the word &quot;creole&quot; was generally used by linguists in opposition to &quot;language&quot;, rather than as a qualifier for it.

Another factor that may have contributed to the relative neglect of creole languages in linguistics is that they do not fit the 19th-century neogrammarian &quot;tree model&quot; for the evolution of languages, and its postulated regularity of sound changes (these critics including the earliest advocates of the wave model, Johannes Schmidt and Hugo Schuchardt, the forerunners of modern sociolinguistics). This controversy of the late 19th century profoundly shaped modern approaches to the comparative method in historical linguistics and in creolistics.

Because of social, political, and academic changes brought on by decolonization in the second half of the 20th century, creole languages have experienced revivals in the past few decades. They are increasingly being used in print and film, and in many cases, their community prestige has improved dramatically. In fact, some have been standardized, and are used in local schools and universities around the world. At the same time, linguists have begun to come to the realization that creole languages are in no way inferior to other languages. They now use the term &quot;creole&quot; or &quot;creole language&quot; for any language suspected to have undergone creolization, terms that now imply no geographic restrictions nor ethnic prejudices.

There is controversy about the extent to which creolization influenced the evolution of African-American Vernacular English (AAVE). In the American education system, as well as in the past, the use of the word &quot;ebonics&quot; to refer to AAVE mirrors the historical negative connotation of the word &quot;creole&quot;.

==Classification==
===Historic classification===
According to their external history, four types of creoles have been distinguished: plantation creoles, fort creoles, maroon creoles, and creolized pidgins. By the very nature of a creole language, the phylogenetic classification of a particular creole usually is a matter of dispute; especially when the pidgin precursor and its parent tongues (which may have been other creoles or pidgins) have disappeared before they could be documented.

Phylogenetic classification traditionally relies on inheritance of the lexicon, especially of &quot;core&quot; terms, and of the grammar structure. However, in creoles, the core lexicon often has mixed origin, and the grammar is largely original. For these reasons, the issue of which language is &quot;the&quot; parent of a creole – that is, whether a language should be classified as a &quot;French creole&quot;, &quot;Portuguese creole&quot; or &quot;English creole&quot;, etc. – often has no definitive answer, and can become the topic of long-lasting controversies, where social prejudices and political considerations may interfere with scientific discussion.

===Substrate and superstrate===
The terms substrate and superstrate are often used when two languages interact. However, the meaning of these terms is reasonably well-defined only in second language acquisition or language replacement events, when the native speakers of a certain source language (the substrate) are somehow compelled to abandon it for another target language (the superstrate). The outcome of such an event is that erstwhile speakers of the substrate will use some version of the superstrate, at least in more formal contexts. The substrate may survive as a second language for informal conversation. As demonstrated by the fate of many replaced European languages (such as Etruscan, Breton, and Venetian), the influence of the substrate on the official speech is often limited to pronunciation and a modest number of loanwords. The substrate might even disappear altogether without leaving any trace.

However, there is dispute over the extent to which the terms &quot;substrate&quot; and &quot;superstrate&quot; are applicable to the genesis or the description of creole languages. The language replacement model may not be appropriate in creole formation contexts, where the emerging language is derived from multiple languages without any one of them being imposed as a replacement for any other. The substratum–superstratum distinction becomes awkward when multiple superstrata must be assumed (such as in Papiamento), when the substratum cannot be identified, or when the presence or the survival of substratal evidence is inferred from mere typological analogies. On the other hand, the distinction may be meaningful when the contributions of each parent language to the resulting creole can be shown to be very unequal, in a scientifically meaningful way. In the literature on Atlantic Creoles, &quot;superstrate&quot; usually means European and &quot;substrate&quot; non-European or African.

===Decreolization===
Since creole languages rarely attain official status, the speakers of a fully formed creole may eventually feel compelled to conform their speech to one of the parent languages. This decreolization process typically brings about a post-creole speech continuum characterized by large-scale variation and hypercorrection in the language.

It is generally acknowledged that creoles have a simpler grammar and more internal variability than older, more established languages. However, these notions are occasionally challenged. (See also language complexity.)

Phylogenetic or typological comparisons of creole languages have led to divergent conclusions. Similarities are usually higher among creoles derived from related languages, such as the languages of Europe, than among broader groups that include also creoles based on non-Indo-European languages (like Nubi or Sango). French-based creole languages in turn are more similar to each other (and to varieties of French) than to other European-based creoles. It was observed, in particular, that definite articles are mostly prenominal in English-based creole languages and English whereas they are generally postnominal in French creoles and in the variety of French that was exported to what is now Quebec in the 17th and 18th century. Moreover, the European languages which gave rise to the creole languages of European colonies all belong to the same subgroup of Western Indo-European and have highly convergent grammars; to the point that Whorf joined them into a single Standard Average European language group. French and English are particularly close, since English, through extensive borrowing, is typologically closer to French than to other Germanic languages. Thus the claimed similarities between creoles may be mere consequences of similar parentage, rather than characteristic features of all creoles.

==Creole genesis==
There are a variety of theories on the origin of creole languages, all of which attempt to explain the similarities among them. outline a fourfold classification of explanations regarding creole genesis:
# Theories focusing on European input
# Theories focusing on non-European input
# Gradualist and developmental hypotheses
# Universalist approaches

In addition to the precise mechanism of creole genesis, a more general debate has developed whether creole languages are characterized by different mechanisms than traditional languages (which is McWhorter&#x27;s 2018 main point) or whether in that regard creole languages develop by the same mechanisms as any other languages (e.g. DeGraff 2001).

===Theories focusing on European input===
====Monogenetic theory of pidgins and creoles====
The monogenetic theory of pidgins and creoles hypothesizes that all Atlantic creoles derived from a single Mediterranean Lingua Franca, via a West African Pidgin Portuguese of the seventeenth century, relexified in the so-called &quot;slave factories&quot; of Western Africa that were the source of the Atlantic slave trade. This theory was originally formulated by Hugo Schuchardt in the late nineteenth century and popularized in the late 1950s and early 1960s by Taylor, Whinnom, Thompson, and Stewart. However, this hypothesis is now not widely accepted, since it relies on all creole-speaking slave populations being based on the same Portuguese-based creole, despite no to very little historical exposure to Portuguese for many of these populations, no strong direct evidence for this claim, and with Portuguese leaving almost no trace on the lexicon of most of them, with the similarities in grammar explainable by analogous processes of loss of inflection and grammatical forms not common to European and West African languages. For example, points out that relexification postulates too many improbabilities and that it is unlikely that a language &quot;could be disseminated round the entire tropical zone, to peoples of widely differing language background, and still preserve a virtually complete identity in its grammatical structure wherever it took root, despite considerable changes in its phonology and virtually complete changes in its lexicon&quot;.

====Domestic origin hypothesis====
Proposed by for the origin of English-based creoles of the West Indies, the domestic origin hypothesis argues that, towards the end of the 16th century, English-speaking traders began to settle in the Gambia and Sierra Leone rivers as well as in neighboring areas such as the Bullom and Sherbro coasts. These settlers intermarried with the local population leading to mixed populations, and, as a result of this intermarriage, an English pidgin was created. This pidgin was learned by slaves in slave depots, who later on took it to the West Indies and formed one component of the emerging English creoles.

====European dialect origin hypothesis====
The French creoles are the foremost candidates to being the outcome of &quot;normal&quot; linguistic change and their creoleness to be sociohistoric in nature and relative to their colonial origin. Within this theoretical framework, a French creole is a language phylogenetically based on French, more specifically on a 17th-century koiné French extant in Paris, the French Atlantic harbors, and the nascent French colonies. Supporters of this hypothesis suggest that the non-Creole French dialects still spoken in many parts of the Americas share mutual descent from this single koiné. These dialects are found in Canada (mostly in Québec and in Acadian communities), Louisiana, Saint-Barthélemy and as isolates in other parts of the Americas. Approaches under this hypothesis are compatible with gradualism in change and models of imperfect language transmission in koiné genesis.

====Foreigner talk and baby talk====
The Foreigner Talk (FT) hypothesis argues that a pidgin or creole language forms when native speakers attempt to simplify their language in order to address speakers who do not know their language at all. Because of the similarities found in this type of speech and speech directed to a small child, it is also sometimes called baby talk.

 suggest that four different processes are involved in creating Foreigner Talk:
* Accommodation
* Imitation
* Telegraphic condensation
* Conventions

This could explain why creole languages have much in common, while avoiding a monogenetic model. However, , in analyzing German Foreigner Talk, claims that it is too inconsistent and unpredictable to provide any model for language learning.

While the simplification of input was supposed to account for creoles&#x27; simple grammar, commentators have raised a number of criticisms of this explanation:
# There are a great many grammatical similarities amongst pidgins and creoles despite having very different lexifier languages.
# Grammatical simplification can be explained by other processes, i.e. the innate grammar of Bickerton&#x27;s language bioprogram theory.
# Speakers of a creole&#x27;s lexifier language often fail to understand, without learning the language, the grammar of a pidgin or creole.
# Pidgins are more often used amongst speakers of different substrate languages than between such speakers and those of the lexifier language.

Another problem with the FT explanation is its potential circularity. points out that FT is often based on the imitation of the incorrect speech of the non-natives, that is the pidgin. Therefore, one may be mistaken in assuming that the former gave rise to the latter.

====Imperfect L2 learning====
The imperfect L2 (second language) learning hypothesis claims that pidgins are primarily the result of the imperfect L2 learning of the dominant lexifier language by the slaves. Research on naturalistic L2 processes has revealed a number of features of &quot;interlanguage systems&quot; that are also seen in pidgins and creoles:
* invariant verb forms derived from the infinitive or the least marked finite verb form;
* loss of determiners or use of demonstrative pronouns, adjectives or adverbs as determiners;
* placement of a negative particle in preverbal position;
* use of adverbs to express modality;
* fixed single word order with no inversion in questions;
* reduced or absent nominal plural marking.

Imperfect L2 learning is compatible with other approaches, notably the European dialect origin hypothesis and the universalist models of language transmission.

===Theories focusing on non-European input===
Theories focusing on the substrate, or non-European, languages attribute similarities amongst creoles to the similarities of African substrate languages. These features are often assumed to be transferred from the substrate language to the creole or to be preserved invariant from the substrate language in the creole through a process of relexification: the substrate language replaces the native lexical items with lexical material from the superstrate language while retaining the native grammatical categories. The problem with this explanation is that the postulated substrate languages differ amongst themselves and with creoles in meaningful ways. argues that the number and diversity of African languages and the paucity of a historical record on creole genesis makes determining lexical correspondences a matter of chance. coined the term &quot;cafeteria principle&quot; to refer to the practice of arbitrarily attributing features of creoles to the influence of substrate African languages or assorted substandard dialects of European languages.

For a representative debate on this issue, see the contributions to ; for a more recent view, .

Because of the sociohistoric similarities amongst many (but by no means all) of the creoles, the Atlantic slave trade and the plantation system of the European colonies have been emphasized as factors by linguists such as .

===Gradualist and developmental hypotheses===
One class of creoles might start as pidgins, rudimentary second languages improvised for use between speakers of two or more non-intelligible native languages. Keith Whinnom (in ) suggests that pidgins need three languages to form, with one (the superstrate) being clearly dominant over the others. The lexicon of a pidgin is usually small and drawn from the vocabularies of its speakers, in varying proportions. Morphological details like word inflections, which usually take years to learn, are omitted; the syntax is kept very simple, usually based on strict word order. In this initial stage, all aspects of the speech – syntax, lexicon, and pronunciation – tend to be quite variable, especially with regard to the speaker&#x27;s background.

If a pidgin manages to be learned by the children of a community as a native language, it may become fixed and acquire a more complex grammar, with fixed phonology, syntax, morphology, and syntactic embedding. Pidgins can become full languages in only a single generation. &quot;Creolization&quot; is this second stage where the pidgin language develops into a fully developed native language. The vocabulary, too, will develop to contain more and more items according to a rationale of lexical enrichment.

===Universalist approaches===

Universalist models stress the intervention of specific general processes during the transmission of language from generation to generation and from speaker to speaker. The process invoked varies: a general tendency towards semantic transparency, first-language learning driven by universal process, or a general process of discourse organization. Bickerton&#x27;s language bioprogram theory, proposed in the 1980s, remains the main universalist theory.
Bickerton claims that creoles are inventions of the children growing up on newly founded plantations. Around them, they only heard pidgins spoken, without enough structure to function as natural languages; and the children used their own innate linguistic capacities to transform the pidgin input into a full-fledged language. The alleged common features of all creoles would then stem from those innate abilities being universal.

==Recent studies==
The last decades have seen the emergence of some new questions about the nature of creoles: in particular, the question of how complex creoles are and the question of whether creoles are indeed &quot;exceptional&quot; languages.

===Creole prototype===
Some features that distinguish creole languages from noncreoles have been proposed (by Bickerton, for example).

John McWhorter has proposed the following list of features as defining the creole prototype, that is, any language born recently of a pidgin:
* a lack of contextual inflection, that is, a lack of inflection that marks only agreement in case or gender (as opposed to inherent inflection that marks tense, mood or number);
* a lack of functional tone marking, that is, a lack of tone that serves to distinguish lexical items (e.g. Mandarin Chinese vs. ) or to encode grammatical features; and
* a lack of semantically opaque word formation, that is, a lack of words like &quot;understand&quot; or &quot;make up&quot;, the meaning of which is not analyzable in terms of the meanings of their components.

McWhorter argues that the absence of these three features is predictable in languages that were born recently of a pidgin, since learning them would constitute a distinct challenge to the non-native speaker. Over the course of generations, however, such features would be expected to gradually (re-)appear, and therefore &quot;many creoles would harbor departures from the Prototype identifiable as having happened after the creole was born&quot; (McWhorter 2018). As one example, McWhorter (2013) notes that the creole Sranan, which has existed for centuries in a diglossic relationship with Dutch, has borrowed some Dutch verbs containing the prefix ( in Sranan) and whose meaning is not analyzable; for instance the pair , .

McWhorter claims that these three properties characterize any language that was born recently as a pidgin, and states &quot;At this writing, in twenty years I have encountered not a single counterexample&quot; (McWhorter 2018). Nevertheless, the existence of a creole prototype has been disputed by others:
* Henri Wittmann (1999) and David argue that languages such as Manding, Soninke, Magoua French and Riau Indonesian have all these three features but show none of the sociohistoric traits of creole languages. McWhorter (2011, 2018) disagrees: for instance, he points out that Soninke has &quot;a goodly amount&quot; of inherent (i.e. non-contextual) inflection, that Magoua &quot;retains ample marking of gender, person and number distinctions on verbs as well as conjugational classes&quot; and therefore that these languages should not be considered creoles.
* Others (see overview in ) have claimed the existence of creoles that serve as counterexamples to McWhorter&#x27;s hypothesis – the existence of inflectional morphology in Berbice Dutch Creole, for example, or tone in Papiamentu. Again, McWhorter (2018) disagrees. For instance, he points out that the use of tone in Papiamentu to distinguish participial verb forms from base ones appeared only after extensive contact with native Spanish speakers.

===Exceptionalism===
Building up on this discussion, McWhorter proposed that &quot;the world&#x27;s simplest grammars are Creole grammars&quot;, claiming that every noncreole language&#x27;s grammar is at least as complex as any creole language&#x27;s grammar. Gil has replied that Riau Indonesian has a simpler grammar than Saramaccan, the language McWhorter uses as a showcase for his theory. The same objections were raised by Wittmann in his 1999 debate with McWhorter.

The lack of progress made in defining creoles in terms of their morphology and syntax has led scholars such as Robert Chaudenson, Salikoko Mufwene, Michel DeGraff, and Henri Wittmann to question the value of &quot;creole&quot; as a typological class; they argue that creoles are structurally no different from any other language, and that &quot;creole&quot; is a sociohistoric concept – not a linguistic one – encompassing displaced populations and slavery.

 spell out the idea of creole exceptionalism, claiming that creole languages are an instance of nongenetic language change due to language shift with abnormal transmission. Gradualists question the abnormal transmission of languages in a creole setting and argue that the processes which created today&#x27;s creole languages are no different from universal patterns of language change.

Given these objections to &quot;creole&quot; as a concept, DeGraff and others question the idea that creoles are exceptional in any meaningful way. Additionally, argues that some Romance languages are potential creoles but that they are not considered as such by linguists because of a historical bias against such a view.

==Controversy==
Creolistics investigates the relative creoleness of languages suspected to be creoles, what calls &quot;the cline of creoleness&quot;. No consensus exists among creolists as to whether the nature of creoleness is prototypical or merely evidence indicative of a set of recognizable phenomena seen in association with little inherent unity and no underlying single cause.

===&quot;Creole&quot;, a sociohistoric concept===
&quot;Creoleness&quot; is at the heart of the controversy with John McWhorter and Mikael Parkvall opposing Henri Wittmann (1999) and Michel DeGraff. In McWhorter&#x27;s definition, creoleness is a matter of degree, in that prototypical creoles exhibit all of the three traits he proposes to diagnose creoleness: little or no inflection, little or no tone, and transparent derivation. In McWhorter&#x27;s view, less prototypical creoles depart somewhat from this prototype. Along these lines, McWhorter defines Haitian Creole, exhibiting all three traits, as &quot;the most creole of creoles&quot;. A creole like Palenquero, on the other hand, would be less prototypical, given the presence of inflection to mark plural, past, gerund, and participle forms. Objections to the McWhorter-Parkvall hypotheses point out that these typological parameters of creoleness can be found in languages such as Manding, Sooninke, and Magoua French which are not considered creoles. Wittmann and DeGraff come to the conclusion that efforts to conceive a yardstick for measuring creoleness in any scientifically meaningful way have failed so far. comes to the same conclusion for Riau Indonesian. have adduced evidence as to creole languages which respond unexpectedly to one of McWhorter&#x27;s three features (for example, inflectional morphology in Berbice Creole Dutch, tone in Papiamentu). and have argued further that Creole languages are structurally no different from any other language, and that Creole is in fact a sociohistoric concept (and not a linguistic one), encompassing displaced population and slavery. discuss creolistics in relation to colonialist ideologies, rejecting the notion that Creoles can be responsibly defined in terms of specific grammatical characteristics. They discuss the history of linguistics and nineteenth-century work that argues for the consideration of the sociohistorical contexts in which Creole languages emerged.

===&quot;Creole&quot;, a genuine linguistic concept===
On the other hand, McWhorter points out that in languages such as Bambara, essentially a dialect of Manding, there is ample non-transparent derivation, and that there is no reason to suppose that this would be absent in close relatives such as Mandinka itself. Moreover, he also observes that Soninke has what all linguists would analyze as inflections, and that current lexicography of Soninke is too elementary for it to be stated with authority that it does not have non-transparent derivation. Meanwhile, Magoua French, as described by Henri Wittmann, retains some indication of grammatical gender, which qualifies as inflection, and it also retains non-transparent derivation. Michel DeGraff&#x27;s argument has been that Haitian Creole retains non-transparent derivation from French.

===Additional resources===
 critically assesses the proposal that creole languages exist as a homogeneous structural type with shared and/ or peculiar origins.

 groups creole genesis theories into four categories:

* Theories focusing on the European input
* Theories focusing on the non-European input
* Gradualist and developmental hypotheses
* Universalist approaches

The authors also confine Pidgins and mixed languages into separate chapters outside this scheme whether or not relexification come into the picture.

<text>The Grand Canal () is a system of interconnected canals linking various major rivers in North and East China, serving as an important waterborne transport infrastructure between the north and the south during Medieval and premodern China. It is the longest artificial waterway in the world and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The Grand Canal&#x27;s main stem, known to the Chinese as the [[Beijing|Jing]][[Hangzhou|Hang]] Grand Canal, is thought to extend for and is divided into 6 main subsections. The Jiangnan Canal runs from the Qiantang River at Hangzhou to the Yangtze River at Zhenjiang; the Inner Canal from the Yangtze at Yangzhou to the Huai River at Huai&#x27;an, which for centuries was also its junction with the former course of the Yellow River; the Middle Canal from Huai&#x27;an to the Nansi Lakes; the Lu Canal from the lakes past Jining and the present course of the Yellow River to the Wei River at Linqing; the Southern Canal from Linqing to the Hai River at Tianjin; and the Northern Canal from Tianjin to Tongzhou on the outskirts of Beijing. As such, it passes through the provinces and municipalities of Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shandong, Hebei, Tianjin, and Beijing. In 2014, the Chinese government and UNESCO recognized the Eastern Zhejiang Canal from Hangzhou to Ningbo along the former Tongji and Yongji Canals as official components of the Grand Canal.

The oldest sections of what is now the Grand Canal were completed in the early 5th century BC during the conflicts of China&#x27;s Spring and Autumn period to provide supplies and transport routes for the states of Wu and Yue. The network was completed by Emperor Yang of the Sui dynasty in AD 609, linking the fertile Jiangnan region in the south to his capital at Luoyang in the west and to his armies in the far north. His unsuccessful and unpopular wars and the massive amounts of conscripted labor involved in creating the canal were among the chief factors in the rapid fall of the Sui, but the connection of China&#x27;s major watersheds and population centers proved enormously beneficial. Additional canals supplied Chang&#x27;an (now Xi&#x27;an) even further west under the Tang dynasty while stopover towns along the main course became the economic hubs of the empire. Periodic flooding of the Yellow River threatened the safety and functioning of the canal while, during wartime, the rivers&#x27; high dikes were sometimes deliberately broken to delay or sweep away advancing enemy troops. Even so, restoration and improvement of the canal and its associated flood control works was assumed as a duty by each successive dynasty. The canal played a major role in periodically reuniting northern and southern China, and officials in charge of the canal and nearby salt works grew enormously wealthy. Despite damage from floods, rebellions, and wars, the canal&#x27;s importance only grew with the removal of the capital to Khanbaliq under the Mongol Yuan and to Beijing under Yongle Emperor of the Ming dynasty and the Manchu Qing dynasty. Despite the importance of railways and roads in modern China, the People&#x27;s Republic of China has worked to improve the navigability of the canal since the end of the Chinese Civil War and the portion south of the Yellow River remains in heavy use by barges carrying bulk cargo. Increasing concern over pollution in China and particularly the use of the Grand Canal as the eastern path of the South-North Water Diversion Projectintended to provide clean potable water to the northhas led to regulations and several projects to improve water quality along the waterway.

The greatest height on the canal is an elevation of above sea level reached in the foothills of Shandong. Ships in Chinese canals did not have trouble reaching higher elevations after the Song official and engineer Qiao Weiyue invented the pound lock in the 10th century. The canal has been admired by many visitors throughout its history, including the Japanese monk Ennin (794–864), the Persian historian Rashid al-Din Hamadani (1247–1318), the Korean official Choe Bu (1454–1504), and the Italian missionary Matteo Ricci (1552–1610).

==History==

===Early periods===
In the late Spring and Autumn period, King Fuchai of Wu (whose capital was in present-day Suzhou), ventured north to attack the State of Qi. He ordered a canal to be constructed for trading purposes, as well as a means to ship ample supplies north in case his forces should engage the northern states of Song and Lu. This became known as the Han or Hangou Canal &quot;Hángōu&quot;). Work began in 486 BC, from south of Yangzhou to north of Huai&#x27;an in Jiangsu, and within three years the Han Canal had connected the Yangtze with the Huai River utilizing existing waterways, lakes, and marshes.

The Han Canal is known as the second oldest section of the later Grand Canal since the Hong Canal ( &quot;Hónggōu&quot;, &quot;Canal of the Wild Geese&quot; or &quot;Far-Flung Canal&quot;) most likely preceded it. It linked the Yellow River near Kaifeng to the Si and Bian rivers and became the model for the shape of the Grand Canal in the north. The exact date of the Hong Canal&#x27;s construction is uncertain; it is first mentioned by the diplomat Su Qin in 330 BC when discussing state boundaries. The historian Sima Qian (145–90 BC) knew of no historical date for it, placing his discussion of it just after the legendary works of Yu the Great; modern scholars now consider it to belong to the 6th century BC.

===Sui dynasty===
The reunification of China under the Sui dynasty (581–618) ended three centuries of chaos since the Upheaval of the Five Barbarians, and the renewed political stability allowed both the thorough repair of existing canals and flood control systems as well as the construction of new canals. The primary consideration of the Sui canals was the need to tap into the expanding economic and agricultural resources of the Jiangnan region in the southeast to enrich the main Sui capital at Luoyang to the west and to supply the expeditionary Sui armies in the Goguryeo-Sui Wars to the northeast. The institution of the Grand Canal also obviated the need for army garrisons to become self-sufficient part-time militia-farmers while guarding the dry frontiers between China, Goguryeo and Göktürk.

A dike-building project in 587 along the Yellow River—overseen by engineer Liang Rui—established canal lock gates to regulate water levels for the canal. Double slipways were installed to haul boats over when the difference in water levels was too great for the flash lock to operate. Similarly, by the year 600, there were major buildups of silt on the bottom of the Hong Canal, obstructing river barges whose drafts were too deep for its waters. The chief engineer of the Sui dynasty, Yuwen Kai, advised the digging of a new canal that would run parallel to the existing canal, diverging from it at Chenliu (Yanzhou). The new canal was to pass not Xuzhou but Suzhou, to avoid connecting with the Si River and instead make a direct connection with the Huai River just west of Lake Hongze. With the recorded labor of five million people under the supervision of Ma Shumou, the first major section of the Grand Canal was completed in the year 605 and was called the Bian Qu.

The Grand Canal was fully completed from the years 604 to 609 under Emperor Yang, first by linking his southern capital Yangzhou northwest to Luoyang by the Tongji Canal &quot;Tōngjì Qú&quot;). He then proceeded to connect Yangzhou southeast to Suzhou and Hangzhou by the Jiangnan Canal and to connect Luoyang northeast to his wars with Korea by the Yongji Canal &quot;Yǒngjì Qú&quot;). After this network&#x27;s completion in 609, Emperor Yang was said to have led a flotilla of boats long from the north down to his southern capital at Yangzhou. This process again involved massive levies of conscripted labor and was detailed at length in the &quot;Record of the Opening of the Canal&quot; &quot;Kāihéjì&quot;).

At this point, the Grand Canal continued to use noncontiguous artificial channels and both canalized and natural waterways rather than presenting a single continuous manmade canal. However, running alongside and parallel to the course of the canals was an imperial roadway with stables maintained at regular intervals to support a rapid courier system. Enormous lines of trees were also planted along parts of the canal as windbreaks.

===Tang to Yuan dynasties===
Although the Tang dynasty (618–907) capital at Chang&#x27;an was the most thriving metropolis of China in its day, it was the city of Yangzhou—in proximity to the Grand Canal—that was the economic hub of the Tang era. Besides being the headquarters for the government salt monopoly and the largest pre-modern industrial production center of the empire, Yangzhou was also the geographical midpoint along the north–south trade axis, and so became the major center for southern goods shipped north. One of the greatest benefits of the canal system in the Tang dynasty—and subsequent dynasties—was that it reduced the cost of shipping grain that had been collected in taxes (caoyun) from the Yangtze Delta to northern China. Minor additions to the canal were made after the Sui period to cut down on travel time, but overall no fundamental differences existed between the Sui Grand Canal and the Tang Grand Canal.

By the year 735, it was recorded that about of grain were shipped annually along the canal. The Tang government oversaw canal lock efficiency and built granaries along the route in case a flood or other disaster impeded the path of shipment. To ensure smooth travel of grain shipments, Transport Commissioner Liu Yan (in office from 763 to 779) had special river barge ships designed and constructed to fit the depths of each section of the entire canal.

After the An Lushan rebellion (755–763), the economy of North China was greatly damaged and never recovered due to wars and to constant flooding of the Yellow River. Such a case occurred in the year 858 when an enormous flood along the Grand Canal inundated thousands of acres of farmland and killed tens of thousands of people in the North China Plain. Such an unfortunate event could reduce the legitimacy of a ruling dynasty by causing others to perceive it as having lost the Mandate of Heaven; this was a good reason for dynastic authorities to maintain a smooth and efficient canal system.
The city of Kaifeng grew to be a major hub, later becoming the capital of the Song dynasty (960–1279). Although the Tang and Song dynasty international seaports—the greatest being Guangzhou and Quanzhou, respectively—and maritime foreign trade brought merchants great fortune, it was the Grand Canal within China that spurred the greatest amount of economic activity and commercial profit. During the Song and earlier periods, barge ships occasionally crashed and wrecked along the Shanyang Yundao section of the Grand Canal while passing the double slipways, and more often than not those were then robbed of the tax grain by local bandits. This prompted Qiao Weiyue, an Assistant Commissioner of Transport for Huainan, to invent a double-gate system known as the pound lock in the year 984. This allowed ships to wait within a gated space while the water could be drained to appropriate levels; the Chinese also built roofed hangars over the space to add further protection for the ships.

Much of the Grand Canal was ruined for several years after 1128 when Kaifeng&#x27;s governor Du Chong &quot;Dù Chōng&quot;, d.1141) decided to break the dykes and dams holding back the waters of the Yellow River in order to decimate the oncoming Jurchen invaders during the Jin–Song wars. Over a series of floods, this entirely shifted the river south of Shandong, capturing the course of the Si River and emptying the Yellow River into Hongze Lake and the East China Sea for centuries. The Jurchen Jin dynasty continually battled with the Song in this region. The warfare led to the dilapidation of the canal until the Mongols invaded in the 13th century and began necessary repairs.

During the Mongol Yuan dynasty (1271–1368) the capital of China was moved to Beijing, eliminating the need for the canal arm flowing west to Kaifeng or Luoyang. A summit section was dug across the foothills of the Shandong massif during the 1280s, shortening the overall length by as much as , making the total length about and linking Hangzhou and Beijing with a direct north–south waterway for the first time. As in the Song and Jin era, the canal fell into disuse and dilapidation during the Yuan dynasty&#x27;s decline.

The Grand Canal as infrastructure has had influence on other architectural works in the west. The Erie Canal in North America is designed and draws inspiration from the Chinese architecture. Many saw the canal as an economic advantage that could bring economic prosperity, like the canal and its benefits. Matteo Ricci&#x27;s Journals describes the canal in great detail documenting the economic prosperity. The pound lock is one of the more notable features of the Erie canal that is directly connected to the infrastructure of the Grand Canal as it is used in other similar bodies of water.

===Ming dynasty restoration===

The Grand Canal was renovated almost in its entirety between 1411 and 1415 during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644). A magistrate of Jining, Shandong sent a memorandum to the throne of the Yongle Emperor protesting the current inefficient means of transporting 4,000,000 &quot;dan&quot; (428,000,000 liters) of grain a year by means of transferring it along several different rivers and canals in barge types that went from deep to shallow after the Huai River, and then transferred back onto deep barges once the shipment of grain reached the Yellow River. Chinese engineers built a dam to divert the Wen River to the southwest in order to feed 60% of its water north into the Grand Canal, with the remainder going south. They dug four large reservoirs in Shandong to regulate water levels, which allowed them to avoid pumping water from local sources and water tables. Between 1411 and 1415 a total of 165,000 laborers dredged the canal bed in Shandong and built new channels, embankments, and canal locks.

The Yongle Emperor moved the Ming capital from Nanjing to Beijing in 1403. This move deprived Nanjing of its status as chief political center of China. The reopening of the Grand Canal also benefited Suzhou over Nanjing since the former was in a better position on the main artery of the Grand Canal, and so it became Ming China&#x27;s greatest economic center. The only other viable contender with Suzhou in the Jiangnan region was Hangzhou, but it was located further down the Grand Canal and away from the main delta. Even the shipwrecked Korean Choe Bu (1454–1504)—while traveling for five months throughout China in 1488—acknowledged that Hangzhou served not as a competitor but as an economic feeder into the greater Suzhou market. Therefore, the Grand Canal served to make or break the economic fortunes of certain cities along its route and served as the economic lifeline of indigenous trade within China.

The scholar Gu Yanwu of the early Qing dynasty (1644–1912) estimated that the previous Ming dynasty had to employ 47,004 full-time laborers recruited by the &quot;lijia&quot; corvée system in order to maintain the entire canal system. It is known that 121,500 soldiers and officers were needed simply to operate the 11,775 government grain barges in the mid-15th century.

Besides its function as a grain shipment route and major vein of river-borne indigenous trade in China, the Grand Canal had long been a government-operated courier route as well. In the Ming dynasty, official courier stations were placed at intervals of . Each courier station was assigned a different name, all of which were popularized in travel songs of the period.

===Qing dynasty===

The Manchus invaded China in the mid-17th century, allowed through the northern passes by the Chinese general Wu Sangui once the Ming capital at Beijing had fallen into the hands of a rebel army. The Manchus established the Qing dynasty (1644–1912), and under their leadership, the Grand Canal was overseen and maintained just as in earlier times.

In 1855, the Yellow River flooded and changed its course, severing the course of the canal in Shandong. This was foreseen by a Chinese official in 1447, who remarked that the flood-prone Yellow River made the Grand Canal like a throat that could be easily strangled (leading some officials to request restarting the grain shipments through the East China Sea). In 1855 the dikes of the canal were opened to flood advancing troops of the Taiping Rebellion&#x27;s Northern Expedition.

===Modern China===
Because of various factors—the difficulty of crossing the Yellow River, the increased development of an alternative sea route for grain-ships, and the opening of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway and the Beijing-Hankou Railway—the canal languished and for decades the northern and southern parts remained separate. Many of the canal sections fell into disrepair, and some parts were returned to flat fields. Even today, the Grand Canal has not fully recovered its importance prior to the floods of the mid-19th century. After the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, the need for economic development led the authorities to order heavy reconstruction work.

The Grand Canal played a major role during Mao Zedong&#x27;s Great Leap Forward as it provided an efficient way to transport grain. It was further refurbished following Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s Reform and Opening Up, with improving economic conditions leading to greater infrastructure investment. The economic importance of the canal will likely continue. The provincial governments of Shandong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang undertook dredging intended to increase shipping capacity by 40 percent by 2012. The central government has also made the main route of the Grand Canal the eastern path of the South-North Water Diversion Project, using enormous pumping stations to redirect water from the Yangtze Delta to the drier north.

The canal became greatly polluted during China&#x27;s industrialization. By the 1990s, canal barge crews could tell when they neared Hangzhou by the stench of the visibly black water they passed through. Similarly, fishermen on Dongping Lake in Shandong objected to the introduction of water from the Yangtze as part of the South-North Water Diversion Project when they saw it noticeably killing fish and affecting their catch. During the 21st century, increasing efforts have been made to improve environmental conditions along the canal. Around Hangzhou, for instance, a $250 million restoration project begun in 2001 improved water quality to the point where it no longer produces a noticeable odor and is once again capable of supporting some fauna.

On 22 June 2014, UNESCO&#x27;s Conference on World Heritage listed the Grand Canal as a World Heritage Site.

===Historical sections===
As well as its present-day course, fourteen centuries of canal-building have left the Grand Canal with a number of historical sections. Some of these have disappeared, others are still partially extant, and others form the basis for the modern canal. The following are the most important but do not form an exhaustive list.

====Jia Canal====
In 12 BC, in order to solve the problem of the Grand Canal having to use of the perilous course of the Yellow River in Northern Jiangsu, a man named Li Hualong created the Jia Canal. Named after the Jia River whose course it followed, it ran from Xiazhen (modern Weishan) on the shore of Shandong&#x27;s Weishan Lake to Suqian in Jiangsu. The construction of the Jia Canal left only of Yellow River navigation on the Grand Canal, from Suqian to Huai&#x27;an, which by 1688 had been removed by the construction of the Middle Canal by Jin Fu.

====Nanyang New Canal====
In 1566, to escape the problems caused by flooding of the Yellow River around Yutai (now on the western shore of Weishan Lake), the Nanyang New Canal was opened. It ran for from Nanyang (now Nanyang Town, located in the center of Weishan Lake) to the small settlement of Liucheng (in the vicinity of modern Gaolou Village, Weishan County, Shandong) north of Xuzhou City. This change in effect moved the Grand Canal from the low-lying and flood-prone land west of Weishan Lake onto the marginally higher land to its east. It was fed by rivers flowing from east to west from the borders of the Shandong massif.

====Huitong Canal====
North of the Jizhou Canal summit section, the Huitong Canal ran downhill, fed principally by the River Wen, to join the Wei River in the city of Linqing. In 1289, a geological survey preceded its one-year construction. The Huitong Canal, built by an engineer called Ma Zhizhen, ran across sharply sloping ground and the high concentration of locks gave it the nicknames &quot;chahe&quot; or &quot;zhahe&quot;, i.e. &#x27;the river of locks&#x27;. Its great number of feeder springs (between two and four hundred, depending on the counting method and season of the year) also led to it being called the &quot;quanhe&quot; or &#x27;river of springs&#x27;.

====Jizhou Canal====
This, the Grand Canal&#x27;s first true summit section, was engineered by the Mongol Oqruqči in 1238 to connect Jining to the southern end of the Huitong Canal. It rose to a height of 42 meters (138 ft) above the Yangtze, but environmental and technical factors left it with chronic water shortages until it was re-engineered in 1411 by Song Li of the Ming. Song Li&#x27;s improvements, recommended by a local man named Bai Ying, included damming the rivers Wen and Guang and drawing lateral canals from them to feed reservoir lakes at the very summit, at a small town called Nanwang.

====Duke Huan&#x27;s Conduit====
In AD 369, General Huan Wen of the Eastern Jin dynasty connected the shallow river valleys of the Huai and the Yellow. He achieved this by joining two of these rivers&#x27; tributaries, the Si and the Ji respectively, at their closest point, across a low watershed of the Shandong massif. Huan Wen&#x27;s primitive summit canal became a model for the engineers of the Jizhou Canal.

====Yilou Canal====
The Shanyang Canal originally opened onto the Yangtze a short distance south of Yangzhou. As the north shore of the Yangtze gradually silted up to create the sandbank island of Guazhou, it became necessary for boats crossing to and from the Jiangnan Canal to sail the long way around the eastern edge of that island. After a particularly rough crossing of the Yangtze from Zhenjiang, the local prefect realized that a canal dug directly across Guazhou would reduce the journey time and thus make the crossing safer. The Yilou Canal was opened in 738 and still exists, though not as part of the modern Grand Canal route.

==Modern course==

The Grand Canal nominally runs between Beijing and Hangzhou over a total length of ; however, only the section from Hangzhou to Liangshan County is currently navigable. Its course is today divided into seven sections. From south to north these are the Jiangnan Canal, the Li Canal, the Inner Canal, the Middle Canal, the Lu Canal, the South Canal, the North Canal, and the Tonghui River.

Man-Made Lake Lianhu

Training Lake &quot;Lianhu&quot; was used to feed water to the Grand Canal section near Jiangnan. Since the canal was man-made there was not enough naturally flowing water to keep the canal at proper depth so that boats could travel through it. So a man-made lake was used to feed water to the Jiangnan section of the Grand Canal. It was protected by the Government from reclamation and any use of the lake water without proper taxation was deemed illegal. It was supposed to be protected from profitable exploitation, but because the government changed over the years, lake Lianhu had been reclaimed many times and it started to become more shallow. The government changed the lake to become more profitable farmland which led to reclamations and agricultural irrigation using the lake. This began to lead to Lake Lianhu not being able to properly feed water to the Grand Canal. Loss of depth due to reclamation and maintenance costs became too high for the lake to become practical to use. Even though it was a man made lake it was still a beautiful sight. Many different people praised its beauty and various poems have been written about the lake. In recent years recreational uses for the lake have become more popular and may lead to the lake being restored.

===Jiangnan Canal===

This southernmost section of the canal runs from Hangzhou in Zhejiang, where the canal connects with the Qiantang River, to Zhenjiang in Jiangsu, where it meets the Yangtze. After leaving Hangzhou heading north toward Beijing, the canal passes around the eastern border of Lake Tai, through the major cities of Jiaxing, Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou before reaching Zhenjiang. 

The Jiangnan (or &#x27;South of the Yangtze&#x27;) Canal is heavily utilized by barge traffic bringing coal, containers and construction materials to the booming delta. It is generally a minimum of 100 meters wide in the congested city centers, and often two or three times this width in the neighboring countryside. In recent years, broad bypass canals have been dug around the major cities to reduce &#x27;traffic jams&#x27;.

The Suzhou section of the Jiangnan Canal flows through the western part of the city. It includes ten city gates and over 20 stone bridges of traditional design and historic areas that have been well preserved as well as temples and pavilions. 

===Inner Canal===
The Inner Canal runs between the Yangtze and Huai rivers, skirting the Shaobo, Gaoyou, and Hongze lakes of central Jiangsu. This section connects the cities of Huai&#x27;an and Yangzhou. Here the land lying to the west of the canal is higher than its bed while the land to the east is lower. Historically the Shanghe region west of the canal has been prone to frequent flooding, while the Xiahe region to its east has been hit by less frequent but immensely damaging inundations caused by the failure of the Grand Canal levees. Recent works have allowed floodwaters from Shanghe to be diverted safely out to sea. Like the Jiangnan Canal, the Inner Canal is heavily utilized by barge traffic bringing coal, construction materials and increasingly shipping containers around Jiangsu Province.

===Middle Canal===

This &#x27;Middle Canal&#x27; section runs from Huai&#x27;an to Weishan Lake, passing through Luoma Lake and following more than one course, the result of the impact of centuries of Yellow River flooding. After Pizhou, a northerly course passes through Tai&#x27;erzhuang to enter Weishan Lake at Hanzhuang bound for Nanyang and Jining (this course is the remnant of the New Nanyang Canal of 1566 – see below). A southerly course passes close by Xuzhou and enters Weishan Lake near Peixian. This latter course is less used today. Canal is utilized by barge traffic bringing coal and construction materials around northern Jiangsu Province.

===Lu Canal===
At Weishan Lake, both courses enter Shandong province. From here to Linqing, the canal is called the Lu or &#x27;Shandong&#x27; Canal. It crosses a series of lakes—Zhaoyang, Dushan, and Nanyang—which nominally form a continuous body of water. At present, diversions of water mean that the lakes are often largely dry land. North of the northernmost Nanyang Lake is the city of Jining. Further on, about north of Jining, the highest elevation of the canal ( above sea level) is reached at the town of Nanwang. In the 1950s a new canal was dug to the south of the old summit section. The old summit section is now dry, while the new canal holds too little water to be navigable. About further north, passing close by Dongping Lake, the canal reaches the Yellow River. By this point waterless, it no longer connects to the river. It reappears again in Liaocheng City on the north bank where, intermittently flowing through a renovated stone channel, it reaches the city of Linqing on the Shandong – Hebei border. Liangshan County is the northern terminus of the canal for barge traffic.

===Southern Canal===
The fifth section of the canal extends for a distance of from Linqing to Tianjin along the course of the canalized Wei River. Though one of the northernmost sections, its name derives from its position relative to Tianjin. The Wei River at this point is heavily polluted while drought and industrial water extraction have left it too low to be navigable. The canal, now in Hebei province, passes through the cities of Dezhou and Cangzhou. Although to spectators, the canal appears to be a deep waterway in these city centers, its depth is maintained by weirs and the canal is all but dry where it passes through the surrounding countryside. At its terminus, the canal joins the Hai River in the center of Tianjin City before turning north-west.

===Northern Canal and Tonghui River===
In Tianjin, the canal heads northwest, for a short time following the course of the Yongding, a tributary of the Hai River, before branching off toward Tongzhou on the edge of the municipality of Beijing. It is here that the modern canal stops and that a Grand Canal Cultural Park has been built. During the Yuan dynasty, a further canal on the Tonghui River connected Tongzhou with a wharf called the Houhai or &quot;rear sea&quot; in central Beijing. In the Ming and Qing dynasties, however, the water level in the Tonghui River dropped and ships could not travel from Tongzhou to Beijing. Tongzhou then became the northern shipping terminus of the canal. Cargo was unloaded at Tongzhou and transported to Beijing by land. The Tonghui river still exists as a wide, concrete-lined storm-channel and drain for the suburbs of Beijing.

===Eastern Zhejiang Canal===

The Eastern Zhejiang Canal runs across the coastal plain south of Hangzhou Bay in northern Zhejiang. It begins at the Qiantang River in Xixing, Binjiang District, Hangzhou; crosses the Cao&#x27;e River in Shaoxing; and connects to the Yong River and ports on the East China Sea at Ningbo.

This HangzhouNingbo canal began as the Shanyin Canal excavated in Shaoxing by the Yue official Fan Li in the early 5th century BC during China&#x27;s Spring and Autumn period. Despite the difficulty of connecting the route&#x27;s various watersheds, the present route was completed with the construction of the Xixing Canal by the Jin official He Xun in the late 3rd century AD. The canal was an important artery of transport and supply for the region during periods of disunity in medieval China and was particularly prosperous and vital during the Southern Song, who established their capital at Lin&#x27;an within present-day Hangzhou. During the Yuan, Ming, and Qing, the canal diminished in importance but was kept navigable until the development of railways and roads in the 19th and 20th century. Renovation of the canal for use by modern barges began in 2002, was completed except for areas around Ningbo by 2009, and was fully completed in late 2013.

In November 2008, the Eastern Zhejiang Canal was added to the Grand Canal&#x27;s UNESCO nomination and, in May 2013, was officially included as part of the Grand Canal and listed among the 7th group of Major Historical and Cultural Sites Protected at the National Level by the Chinese government. In 2014, it was included with the BeijingHangzhou and Sui and Tang canals as part of UNESCO&#x27;s listing for the Grand Canal.

==Registered Sections and Sites of the World Heritage complex==
The Grand Canal World Heritage site is composed of 31 sections and a number of accessory heritage sites.
==Elevations==
Though the canal nominally crosses the watersheds of five river systems, in reality, the variation between these is so low that it has only a single summit section. The elevation of the canal bed varies from 1 m below sea level at Hangzhou to 38.5 m above at its summit. At Beijing, it reaches 27 m, fed by streams flowing downhill from the mountains to the west. The water flows from Beijing toward Tianjin, from Nanwang north toward Tianjin, and from Nanwang south toward Yangzhou. The water level in the Jiangnan Canal remains scarcely above sea level (the Zhenjiang ridge is 12 meters higher than that of the Yangtze River).

==Uses==
=== Transportation ===
From the Tang to Qing dynasties, the Grand Canal served as the main artery between northern and southern China and was essential for the transport of grain to Beijing. Although it was mainly used for shipping grain, it also transported other commodities and the corridor along the canal developed into an important economic belt. Records show that, at its height, every year more than 8,000 boats transported four to six million dan (240,000–360,000 metric tons) of grain. The convenience of transport also enabled rulers to lead inspection tours to southern China. In the Qing dynasty, the Kangxi and Qianlong emperors made twelve trips to the south, on all occasions but one reaching Hangzhou.

The Grand Canal also enabled cultural exchange and political integration to occur between the north and south of China. The canal even made a distinct impression on some of China&#x27;s early European visitors. Marco Polo recounted the Grand Canal&#x27;s arched bridges as well as the warehouses and prosperous trade of its cities in the 13th century. The famous Roman Catholic missionary Matteo Ricci traveled from Nanjing to Beijing along the canal at the end of the 16th century.

Since the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, the canal has been used primarily to transport vast amounts of bulk goods such as bricks, gravel, sand, diesel, and coal. The Jianbi ship locks on the Yangtze are currently handling some 75,000,000 metric tons each year, and the Li Canal is forecast to reach 100,000,000 metric tons in the next few years. When first constructed, the canal served as a major source of transportation, linking northern and southern China. With the introduction of expressways, railways and high speed railways in modern China, passenger travel on the canal became far less common.

Currently, ships can only travel up to Jining. The section from Jining to Beijing is not available for transport due to the silt deposit buildup from the Yellow River and lack of water sources. There are plans for restoring transportation up to Tai&#x27;an.

===South-North Water Transfer Project===
The Grand Canal has been upgraded to serve as the Eastern Route of the South-North Water Transfer Project. Additional water is pumped into the canal from the Yangtze at Jiangdu near Yangzhou using a pumping station. and repumped through 23 stations until it reaches the watershed at Nanwang. Afterwards the water flows by gravity, one secondary canal going to the Shandong peninsula, and the main canal bypasses the Yellow River through 7.9 km tunnels and flows through a modified route into reservoirs in Tianjin. The extra waterflow has allowed the start of several projects to reestablish shipping in the northern half of the Grand Canal.

==Notable travelers==
In 1169, with China divided between the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty in the north and the Southern Song dynasty in the south, the Southern Song Emperor Xiaozong sent a delegation to the Jurchen to wish their ruler well for the New Year. A scholar-official named Lou Yue, secretary to the delegation, recorded the journey, much of which was made upon the Grand Canal, and submitted his &quot;Diary of a Journey to the North&quot; to the emperor on his return.

In 1170, the poet, politician, and historian Lu You traveled along the Grand Canal from Shaoxing to the river Yangtze, recording his progress in a diary.

In the late 1200s, Marco Polo traveled extensively through China and his trips included time on the Grand Canal, then a major artery for shipping silk, porcelain, and wine.

In 1345, Maghrebi traveler Ibn Battuta traveled China and journeyed through the Abe Hayat river (Grand Canal) up to the capital Khanbalik (Beijing).

In 1488, the shipwrecked Korean scholar Choe Bu traveled the entire length of the Grand Canal on his way from Zhejiang to Beijing (and on to Korea) and left a detailed account of his trip.

In 1600, Matteo Ricci traveled to Beijing from Nanjing via the Grand Canal waterway to gain the support of the Wanli Emperor of the Ming dynasty with the help of Wang Zhongde, the Director of the Board of Rites in the central government of China at the time.

In 1793, after a largely fruitless diplomatic mission to Jehol, a large part of Lord Macartney&#x27;s embassy returned south to the Yangtze delta via the Grand Canal.

In 1848, Robert Fortune reached Hang Chow Foo by the Grand Canal in his quest for tea plants.

<text>An arcade video game is an arcade game that takes player input from its controls, processes it through electrical or computerized components, and displays output to an electronic monitor or similar display. All arcade video games are coin-operated or accept other means of payment, housed in an arcade cabinet, and located in amusement arcades alongside other kinds of arcade games. Until the early 2000s, arcade video games were the largest and most technologically advanced segment of the video game industry.

Early prototypical entries &quot;Galaxy Game&quot; and &quot;Computer Space&quot; in 1971 established the principle operations for arcade games, and Atari&#x27;s &quot;Pong&quot; in 1972 is recognized as the first successful commercial arcade video game. Improvements in computer technology and gameplay design led to a golden age of arcade video games, the exact dates of which are debated but range from the late 1970s to the early 1980s. This golden age includes &quot;Space Invaders&quot;, &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, and &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;. The arcade industry had a resurgence from the early 1990s to mid-2000s, including &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, and &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot;, but ultimately declined in the Western world as competing home video game consoles such as the Sony PlayStation and Microsoft Xbox increased in their graphics and gameplay capability and decreased in cost. Nevertheless, Japan, China, and South Korea retain a strong arcade industry in the present day.

==History==

Games of skill were popular amusement-park midway attractions from the 19th century on. With the introduction of electricity and coin-operated machines, they facilitated a viable business. When pinball machines with electric lights and displays were introduced in 1933 (but without the user-controller flippers which would not be invented until 1947) these machines were seen as games of luck. Numerous states and cities treated them as amoral playthings for rebellious young people, and banned them into the 1960s and 1970s.

Electro-mechanical games (EM games) appeared in arcades in the mid-20th century. Following Sega&#x27;s EM game &quot;Periscope&quot; (1966), the arcade industry experienced a &quot;technological renaissance&quot; driven by &quot;audio-visual&quot; EM novelty games, establishing the arcades as a suitable environment for the introduction of commercial video games in the early 1970s. In the late 1960s, college student Nolan Bushnell had a part-time job at an arcade where he became familiar with EM games such as Chicago Coin&#x27;s racing game &quot;Speedway&quot; (1969), watching customers play and helping to maintain the machinery, while learning the game business.

The early mainframe game &quot;Spacewar!&quot; (1962) inspired the first commercial arcade video game, &quot;Computer Space&quot; (1971), created by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney and released by Nutting Associates. It was demonstrated at the Amusement &amp; Music Operators Association (AMOA) show in October 1971. Another &quot;Spacewar&quot;-inspired coin-operated video game, &quot;Galaxy Game&quot;, was demonstrated at Stanford University in November 1971. Bushnell and Dabney followed their &quot;Computer Space&quot; success to create - with the help of Allan Alcorn - a table-tennis game, &quot;Pong&quot;, released in 1972. &quot;Pong&quot; became a commercial success, leading numerous other coin-op manufacturers to enter the market.

The video game industry transitioned from discrete integrated circuitry to programmable microprocessors in the mid-1970s, starting with &quot;Gun Fight&quot; in 1975. The arcade industry entered a &quot;Golden Age&quot; in 1978 with the release of Taito&#x27;s &quot;Space Invaders&quot;, which introduced many novel gameplay features - including a scoreboard. From 1978 to 1982, several other major arcade-games from Namco, Atari, Williams Electronics, Stern Electronics, and Nintendo were all considered blockbusters, particularly Namco&#x27;s &quot;Pac-Man&quot; (1980), which became a fixture in popular culture. Across North America and Japan, dedicated video-game arcades appeared and arcade-game cabinets appeared in many smaller storefronts. By 1981, the arcade video-game industry was worth in the US.

The novelty of arcade games waned sharply after 1982 due to several factors, including market saturation of arcades and arcade games, a moral panic over video games (similar to fears raised over pinball machines in the decades prior), and the 1983 video game crash as the home-console market impacted arcades. The arcade market had recovered by 1986, with the help of software-conversion kits, the arrival of popular beat &#x27;em up games (such as &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot; (1984) and &quot;Renegade&quot; (1986-1987)), and advanced motion simulator games (such as Sega&#x27;s &quot;taikan&quot; games including &quot;Hang-On&quot; (1985), &quot;Space Harrier&quot; (1985), and &quot;Out Run&quot; (1986)). However, the growth of home video-game systems such as the Nintendo Entertainment System led to another brief arcade decline toward the end of the 1980s.

Arcade games continued to improve with the development of technology and of gameplay. In the early 1990s, the release of Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; established the modern style of fighting games and led to a number of similar games such as &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, &quot;Fatal Fury&quot;, &quot;Killer Instinct&quot;, &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot;, and &quot;Tekken&quot;, creating a new renaissance in the arcades. Another factor was realism, including the &quot;3D Revolution&quot; from 2D and pseudo-3D graphics to &quot;true&quot; real-time 3D polygon graphics. This was largely driven by a technological arms-race between Sega and Namco. During the early 1990s games such as Sega&#x27;s &quot;Virtua Racing&quot; and &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; popularized 3D-polygon technology in arcades. 3D graphics later became popular in console and computer games by the mid-1990s, though arcade systems such as the Sega Model 3 remained considerably more advanced than home systems in the late 1990s. Until about 1996, arcade video-games had remained the largest segment of the global video-game industry. Arcades declined in the late 1990s, surpassed by the console market for the first time around 1997–1998.

Since the 2000s, arcade games have taken different routes globally. In the United States, arcades have become niche markets as they compete with the home-console market, and they have adapted other business models, such as providing other entertainment options or adding prize redemptions. In Japan, where arcades continue to flourish, games like &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot; and &quot;The House of the Dead&quot; aim to deliver tailored experiences that players cannot easily have at home.

==Technology==


Virtually all modern arcade games (other than the very traditional fair midway) make extensive use of solid state electronics, integrated circuits, and monitor screens, all installed inside an arcade cabinet.

With the exception of &quot;Galaxy Game&quot; and &quot;Computer Space&quot;, which were built around small form-factor mainframe computers, the first arcade games are based on combinations of multiple discrete logic chips, such as transistor–transistor logic (TTL) chips. Designing an arcade game was more about the combination of these TTL chips and other electronic components to achieve the desired effect on screen. More complex gameplay required significantly more TTL components to achieve this result. By the mid-1970s, the first inexpensive programmable microprocessors had arrived on the market. The first microprocessor-based video game is Midway&#x27;s &quot;Gun Fight&quot; in 1975 (a conversion of Taito&#x27;s &quot;Western Gun&quot;), and with the advent of &quot;Space Invaders&quot; and the golden era, microprocessor-based games became typical. Early arcade games were also designed around raster graphics displayed on a cathode-ray tube (CRT) display. Many games of the late 1970s and early 1980s use special displays that rendered vector graphics, though these waned by the mid-1980s as display technology on CRTs improved. Prior to the availability of color CRT or vector displays, some arcade cabinets have a combination of angled monitor positioning, one-way mirrors, and clear overlays to simulate colors and other graphics onto the gameplay field.

Coin-operated arcade video games from the 1990s to the 2000s generally use custom hardware often with multiple CPUs, highly specialized sound and graphics chips, and the latest in expensive computer graphics display technology. This allows more complex graphics and sound than contemporary video game consoles or personal computers. Many arcade games since the 2000s run on modified video game console hardware (such as the Sega NAOMI or Triforce) or gaming PC components (such as the Taito Type X). Many arcade games have more immersive and realistic game controls than PC or console games. This includes specialized ambiance or control accessories such as fully enclosed dynamic cabinets with force feedback controls, dedicated lightguns, rear-projection displays, reproductions of automobile or airplane cockpits, motorcycle or horse-shaped controllers, or highly dedicated controllers such as dancing mats and fishing rods. These accessories are usually too bulky, expensive, and specialized to be used with typical home PCs and consoles. Arcade makers experiment with virtual reality technology. Arcades have progressed from using coins as credits to smart cards that hold the virtual currency of credits.

Modern arcade cabinets use flat panel displays instead of cathode-ray tubes. Internet services such as ALL.Net, NESiCAxLive, e-Amusement and NESYS, allow the cabinets to download updates or new games, do online multiplayer gameplay, save progress, unlock content, or earn credits.

==Genres==

Many arcade games have short levels, simple and intuitive control schemes, and rapidly increasing difficulty. The classic formula for a successful arcade video game is &quot;easy to learn, difficult to master&quot; along with a &quot;multiple life, progressively difficult level&quot; paradigm. This is due to the environment of the arcade, where the player is essentially renting the game for as long as their in-game avatar can stay alive or until they run out of tokens. Games on consoles or PCs can be referred to as &quot;arcade games&quot; if they share these qualities, or are direct ports of arcade games.

Arcade racing games often have sophisticated motion simulator arcade cabinets, a simplified physics engine, and short learning time when compared with more realistic racing simulations. Cars can turn sharply without braking or understeer, and the AI rivals are sometimes programmed so they are always near the player with a rubberband effect. Other types of arcade-style games include music games (particularly rhythm games), and mobile and casual games with intuitive controls and short sessions.

===Action===
The term &quot;arcade game&quot; can refer to an action video game designed to play similarly to an arcade game with frantic, addictive gameplay. The focus of arcade action games is on the user&#x27;s reflexes, and many feature very little puzzle-solving, complex thinking, or strategy skills. These include fighting games often played with an arcade controller, beat &#x27;em up games including fast-paced hack and slash games, and light gun rail shooters and &quot;bullet hell&quot; shooters with intuitive controls and rapidly increasing difficulty.

Many arcade combat flight simulation games have sophisticated hydraulic motion simulator cabinets, and simplified physics and handling. Arcade flight games are meant to have an easy learning curve, in order to preserve their action component. Increasing numbers of console flight video games, such as &quot;Crimson Skies&quot;, &quot;Ace Combat&quot;, and &quot;Secret Weapons Over Normandy&quot; indicate the falling of manual-heavy flight sim popularity in favor of instant arcade flight action.

A modern subgenre of action games called &quot;hack and slash&quot; or &quot;character action games&quot; represent an evolution of traditional arcade action games, and are sometimes considered a subgenre of beat &#x27;em up brawlers. This subgenre of games was largely defined by Hideki Kamiya, creator of the &quot;Devil May Cry&quot; and &quot;Bayonetta&quot; franchises.

==Industry==
Arcade games are found in restaurants, bowling alleys, college campuses, video rental shops, dormitories, laundromats, movie theaters, supermarkets, shopping malls, airports, and other retail environments. They are popular in public places where people are likely to have free time.

Their profitability is expanded by the popularity of conversions of arcade games for home-based platforms. In 1997, WMS Industries (parent company of Midway Games) reported that if more than 5,000 arcade units are sold, at least 100,000 home version units will be sold.

The American Amusement Machine Association (AAMA) is a trade association established in 1981 that represents the American coin-operated amusement machine industry, including 120 arcade game distributors and manufacturers. The Japan Amusement Machine and Marketing Association (JAMMA) represents the Japanese arcade industry. Arcade machines may have standardized connectors or interfaces such as JAMMA, or JVS, that help with quick replacement of game systems or boards in arcade cabinets. The game boards or arcade boards may themselves allow for games to be replaced via game cartridges or discs.

==Conversions, emulators, and recreations==
Prior to the 2000s, successful video games were often converted to a home video game console or home computer. Many of the initial Atari VCS games, for example, were conversions of Atari&#x27;s success arcade games. Arcade game manufacturers that were not in the home console or computer business found licensing of their games to console manufacturers to be a successful business model, as console manufacturer competitors would vie for rights to more popular games. Coleco famously bested Atari to secure the rights to convert Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, which it subsequently included as a pack-in game for the ColecoVision to challenge the VCS.

Arcade conversions typically had to make concessions for the lower computational power and capabilities of the home console, such as limited graphics or alterations in gameplay. Such conversions had mixed results. The Atari VCS conversion of &quot;Space Invaders&quot; was considered the VCS&#x27;s killer application, helping to quadruple the VCS sales in 1980. In contrast, the VCS conversion of &quot;Pac-Man&quot; in 1982 was highly criticized for technical flaws due to VCS limitations such as flickering ghosts and simplified gameplay. Though &quot;Pac-Man&quot; was the best-selling game on the VCS, it eroded consumer confidence in Atari&#x27;s games and partially contributed to the 1983 crash.

The need for arcade conversions began to wane as arcade game manufacturers like Nintendo, Sega, and SNK entered the home console market and used similar technology within their home consoles as found at the arcade, negating the need to simplify the game. Concessions still may be made for a home release; notably, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System conversion of &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; removed much of the gore from the arcade version to meet Nintendo&#x27;s quality control standards.
Exact copies of arcade video games can be run through emulators such as MAME on modern devices. An emulator is an application that translates foreign software onto a modern system, in real-time. Emulated games appeared legally and commercially on the Macintosh in 1994 with Williams floppy disks, Sony PlayStation in 1996, and Sega Saturn in 1997 with CD-ROM compilations such as &quot;Williams Arcade&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot; and &quot;Arcade&#x27;s Greatest Hits: The Atari Collection 1&quot;, and on the PlayStation 2 and GameCube with DVD-ROM compilations such as &quot;Midway Arcade Treasures&quot;. Arcade games are downloaded and emulated through the Nintendo Wii Virtual Console service starting in 2009.

Using emulation, companies like Arcade1Up have produced at-scale or reduced-scale recreations of arcade cabinets using modern technology, such as LCD monitors and lightweight construction. These cabinets are typically designed to resemble the original arcade game cabinets, but may also support multiple related games. These cabinets can be offered in diverse and miniaturized styles, such as table-mounted and wall-mounted versions.

==Highest-grossing==
For arcade games, success is usually judged by either the number of arcade hardware units sold to operators, or the amount of revenue generated. The revenue can include the coin drop earnings from coins (such as quarters, dollars, or 100 yen coins) inserted into machines, and/or the earnings from hardware sales with each unit costing thousands of dollars. Most of the revenue figures listed below are incomplete as they only include hardware sales revenue, due to a lack of available data for coin drop earnings which typically account for the majority of a hit arcade game&#x27;s gross revenue. This list only includes arcade games that either sold more than 10,000 hardware units or generated a revenue of more than . Most of the games listed were released between the golden age of arcade video games (1978–1984) and the 1990s.

===Franchises===
These are the combined hardware sales of at least two or more arcade games that are part of the same franchise. This list only includes franchises that have sold at least 5,000 hardware units or grossed at least $10 million revenues.

<text>Otto von Guericke ( , , ; spelled Gericke until 1666; – ) was a German scientist, inventor, mathematician and physicist. His pioneering scientific work, the development of experimental methods and repeatable demonstrations on the physics of the vacuum, atmospheric pressure, electrostatic repulsion, his advocacy for the reality of &quot;action at a distance&quot; and of &quot;absolute space&quot; were noteworthy contributions for the advancement of the Scientific Revolution.

Von Guericke was a very pious man in the Dionysian tradition and attributed the vacuum of space to the creations and designs of an infinite divinity. Von Guericke described this duality &quot;as something that &#x27;contains all things&#x27; and is &#x27;more precious than gold, without beginning and end, more joyous than the perception of bountiful light&#x27; and &#x27;comparable to the heavens&#x27;.&quot;

==Biography==
=== Early life and education ===
Otto von Guericke was born to a patrician family of Magdeburg. He was privately tutored until the age of fifteen. In 1617 he began studying law and philosophy at the Leipzig University. However, in 1620 his studies were disrupted by his father&#x27;s death. He briefly returned home before continuing his studies at the Academia Julia in Helmstedt and the universities of Jena and Leiden. It was at Leiden that he first attended courses on mathematics, physics and military engineering. He concluded his academic education with a nine-month Grand Tour to France and England.

=== Family ===
Upon his return to Magdeburg in 1626 he married Margarethe Alemann, with whom he had three children (Anna Catherine, Hans Otto, and Jacob Christopher) before her untimely death in 1645. Anna Catherine and Jacob Christopher both died in infancy and in 1652 von Guericke married Dorothea Lentke.

===Political career===

Von Guericke was the offspring of one of Magdeburg&#x27;s leading patrician families, that were well educated and well connected. His father and grandfather had been life-long members of the city council and at various occasions during their careers been appointed to serve as mayor of the city. In 1626, Otto von Guericke started his career as political representative of Magdeburg and accepted an official appointment to join the city council. However, in 1618, the Thirty Years&#x27; War had broken out. This exceptionally long, tragic and destructive conflict would soon also descend upon Magdeburg. Only a few years later, he had luckily fled from the city before an army of the imperial Catholic League, led by the Count of Tilly had completely surrounded and cut off Magdeburg. The attack culminated in the single most devastating event of the entire war, namely the Sack of Magdeburg. In May 1631, the imperial troops had crushed the city walls and indiscriminately plundered the riches. Around eighty percent of its more than 25,000 inhabitants perished. The material loss was also unusually high as widespread fires destroyed about 1,700 of a total of 1,900 buildings, including all of von Guericke&#x27;s personal property. He returned to Magdeburg in 1631 and his academic engineer education designated him an appointee of the reconstruction committee.

He became a master brewer in an attempt to speedily acquire a new personal fortune and accumulate wealth for the city. In 1646, he was elected as Magdeburg&#x27;s Burgomeister, the city&#x27;s chief magistrate or executive, an office that arguably bestowed more power (in a practical sense) than that of a mayor. He held this position until his retirement in 1678. During four decades in office he undertook numerous diplomatic missions, which took him to many European courts and councils, where he met powerful executives and secretaries and addressed the illustrious elite of dukes, kings and emperors. In 1666, Otto von Guericke was ennobled by emperor Leopold I, which, apart from entitling him to add the &quot;von&quot; prefix to his name, was of little consequence. He also altered the spelling of his last name from &quot;Gericke&quot; to &quot;Guericke&quot;.

=== Diplomatic pursuits ===
Otto von Guericke&#x27;s first diplomatic mission on behalf of the city led him in September 1642 to the court of the Elector of Saxony at Dresden. Von Guericke&#x27;s mandate was to bring about a more lenient treatment from the Saxon military commander for Magdeburg. In 1648, he represented the city at the peace treaty delegation, that ended the Thirty Year&#x27;s War. During a 1654 diplomatic mission to Regensburg, Guericke presented his invention of the air-pump to impress those he was going to meet and help sway the talks in his favour, as well as promote his own scientific achievements. Diplomacy assignments, often dangerous as well as tedious, would occupy much of his time for the next twenty years. His private life, of which much remains unclear, was developing in parallel. Otto von Guericke utilised both his official status and his scientific knowledge in each other&#x27;s support to serve his city&#x27;s political agenda. Demonstrations of his inventions, such as the air-pump and the electrostatic generator were meant to impress his audiences and improve and extend political communication. He would, if necessary forgo scientific and technical elaborations on how his showpieces worked, leaving people to believe in his wizardry, a characteristic that was of great use for the promotion of a great leader.

=== Initial scientific investigations ===
Curious and inspired by the Copernican cosmology and hardly understanding new ideas of vast, endless, empty space where light would propagate, bodies of matter could move about unhindered, and sound cannot be detected, von Guericke set about replicating this &quot;nothing&quot; phenomenon on Earth. Von Guericke first started investigating the concept of a vacuum through the use of fire pumps by pumping water out of wooden barrels. However, he soon realised that the porosity of wood was allowing unwanted water, filled with dissolved air, to enter. The pressure fluctuations experienced inside the barrel were allowing this encapsulated air to escape: spoiling the vacuum inside. In 1647 he turned his focus to pumping out enclosed air instead of water to solve this problem.

=== Merging of his scientific and political careers ===
His scientific and diplomatic pursuits finally intersected when, at the Reichstag in Ratisbon in 1654, he was invited to demonstrate his experiments on the vacuum before the highest dignitaries of the Holy Roman Empire. He built a vacuum pump, pumped air out of two joined Magdeburg hemispheres, attached a team of horses to each side, and had them pull. He demonstrated this again to the King of Prussia in 1663 and was awarded a lifetime pension. One of these dignitaries, the Archbishop Elector Johann Philipp von Schönborn, bought von Guericke&#x27;s apparatus from him and had it sent to his Jesuit College at Würzburg. One of the professors at the College, Fr. Gaspar Schott, entered into friendly correspondence with von Guericke and thus it was that, at the age of 55, von Guericke&#x27;s work was first published as an Appendix to a book by Fr. Schott – &quot;Mechanica Hydraulico-pneumatica&quot; – published in 1657. This book came to the attention of Robert Boyle who, stimulated by it, embarked on his own experiments on air pressure and the vacuum, and in 1660 published &quot;New Experiments Physico-Mechanical touching the Spring of Air and its Effects&quot;. The following year this was translated into Latin and, made aware of it in correspondence with Fr. Schott, von Guericke acquired a copy.

In the decade following the first publication of his own work von Guericke, in addition to his diplomatic and administrative commitments, was scientifically very active. He embarked upon his Magnum Opus—&quot;Ottonis de Guericke Experimenta Nova (ut vocantur) Magdeburgica de Vacuo Spatio&quot;—which as well as a detailed account of his experiments on the vacuum, contains his pioneering electrostatic experiments in which electrostatic repulsion was demonstrated for the first time and he sets out his theologically based view of the nature of space, but there are also contemporary arguments that he did not conceptualise these demonstrations as electrical. In the Preface to the Reader he claims to have finished the book on 14 March 1663, though publication was delayed for another nine years until 1672. In 1664, his work again appeared in print, again through the good offices of Gaspar Schott, the first section of whose book &quot;Technica Curiosa&quot;, titled &quot;Mirabilia Magdeburgica&quot;, was dedicated to von Guericke&#x27;s work. The earliest reference to the celebrated Magdeburg hemispheres experiment is on page 39 of the &quot;Technica Curiosa&quot;, where Schott notes that von Guericke had mentioned them in a letter of 22 July 1656. Schott goes on to quote a subsequent letter of von Guericke of 4 August 1657, in which he states that he now had carried out the experiment, at considerable cost, with 12 horses.

The 1660s marked the ultimate end for the Magdeburg citizen&#x27;s hope of achieving Free Imperial City status, a goal to which von Guericke had devoted some twenty years of diplomatic effort. On behalf of Magdeburg, he was the first signatory to the &quot;Treaty of Klosterberg&quot; in 1666 whereby Magdeburg accepted a garrison of Brandenburg troops (upon the withdrawal of the imperial garrison) and the obligation to pay dues to the Great Elector, Friedrich Wilhelm I of Brandenburg. Despite the Elector&#x27;s crushing of Magdeburg&#x27;s political aspirations, the personal relationship of von Guericke and Friedrich Wilhelm remained warm. The Great Elector was a patron of scientific scholarship. He had employed von Guericke&#x27;s son, Hans Otto, as his resident in Hamburg and in 1666 had called Otto himself to the Brandenburg Rat. When the &quot;Experimenta Nova&quot; finally appeared it was prefaced with a dedication to Friedrich Wilhelm.

=== Later years ===
In 1677 von Guericke was reluctantly permitted to step down from his civic responsibilities, after repeated requests. In January 1681, as a precaution against an outbreak of the plague then threatening Magdeburg, he and his second wife Dorothea moved to Hamburg, where their son Hans Otto lived. There von Guericke died peacefully on 11 May (Julian) 1686, to the day 55 years after he had fled the siege in 1631. His body was returned to Magdeburg for interment in the on 23 May (Julian). The Otto von Guericke University Magdeburg was named in his honour.

=== Primary publications ===

There are three bodies of text, that contain systematic treatises on von Guericke&#x27;s scientific work.
*1. Friar Gaspar Schott&#x27;s 1657 work &quot;Mechanica Hydraulico-pneumatica&quot;, originally intended as a brief guide to the hydraulic and pneumatic instruments in Athanasius Kircher&#x27;s Roman museum, an appendix added by Schott, is a detailed account of Guericke&#x27;s experiments on vacuums.
*2. Friar Gaspar Schott&#x27;s 1664 &quot;Technica Curiosa&quot;, with appendix that contains a reupload of the 1657 account plus more recent material from Guericke.
*3. Otto von Guericke&#x27;s &quot;Experimenta Nova (ut vocantur) Magdeburgica de Vacuo Spatio&quot; of 1672, published upon Guericke&#x27;s initiative.
The scientific studies and related experiments contained in the above works may be grouped under three topics, to each of which the following books of &quot;Experimenta Nova&quot; are dedicated:
* Book II: The Nature of Space and the Possibility of the Void
* Book III: The Experimental Work on the Production of Vacua, The Pressure of Air and the Earth&#x27;s Atmosphere
* Book IV: The Investigation into Cosmic Potencies.
==Scientific work ==
===&quot;Nature of Space and the Possibility of the Void&quot;===
Book II of the &quot;Experimenta Nova&quot; is an extended philosophical essay in which von Guericke puts forward a view of the nature of space similar to that later espoused by Newton. He is explicitly critical of the plenist views of Aristotle and of their adoption by his younger contemporary Descartes. A particular and repeated target of his criticism is the manner in which the &quot;nature abhors a vacuum&quot; principle had migrated from simply a matter of experiment to a high principle of physics which could be invoked to explain phenomena such as suction but which itself was above question. In setting out his own view, von Guericke, while acknowledging the influence of previous philosophers such as Lessius (but not Gassendi), makes it clear that he considers his thinking on this topic to be original and new. There is no evidence that von Guericke was aware of the &quot;Nouvelles Experiences touchant le vide&quot; of Blaise Pascal published in 1647. In the &quot;Experimenta Nova&quot;, Book III, Ch. 34, he relates how he first became aware of Torricelli&#x27;s mercury tube experiment from Valerianus Magnus at Regensburg in 1654. Pascal&#x27;s work built upon reports of the mercury tube experiment which had reached Paris via Marin Mersenne in 1644. An indication of the unresolved status of the &quot;nature abhors a vacuum&quot; principle at that time may be taken from Pascal&#x27;s opinion, expressed in the conclusion of the &quot;Nouvelles Experiences&quot;, when he writes: &quot;I hold for true the maxims set out below: (a) that all bodies possess a repugnance to being separated one from another and from admitting a vacuum in the interval between them – that is to say that nature abhors a void.&quot; Pascal goes on to claim that this abhorrence of a void is, however, a limited force and thus that the creation of a vacuum is possible.

There were three broad currents of opinion from which von Guericke dissented. Firstly, there was the Aristotelian view that there simply was no void and that everything that exists objectively is in the category of substance. The general plenist position lost credibility in the 17th century, owing primarily to the success of Newtonian mechanics. It was revived again in the 19th century as a theory of an all-pervading aether and again lost plausibility with the success of Special Relativity. Secondly, there was the Augustinian position of an intimate relation between space, time, and matter; all three, according to St. Augustine in the &quot;Confessions&quot; (Ch. XI) and the &quot;City of God&quot; (Book XI, Ch. VI), came into being as a unity and ways of speaking that purport to separate them – such as &quot;outside the universe&quot; or &quot;before the beginning of the universe&quot; are, in fact, meaningless. Augustine&#x27;s way of thinking is also attractive to many and seems to have a strong resonance with General Relativity. The third view, which von Guericke discusses at length, but does not attribute to any individual, is that space is a creation of the human imagination. Thus, it is not truly objective in the sense in which matter is objective. The later theories of Leibniz and Kant seem inspired by this general outlook, but the denial of the objectivity of space has not been scientifically fruitful.

Von Guericke sidestepped the vexing question of the meaning of &quot;nothing&quot; by asserting that all objective reality fell into one of two categories – the created and the uncreated. Space and time were objectively real but were uncreated, whereas matter was created. In this way he created a new fundamental category alongside Aristotle&#x27;s category of substance, that of the uncreated. His understanding of space is theological and similar to that expressed by Newton in the General Scholium to the &quot;Principia&quot;. For instance, von Guericke writes (Book II, Chapter VII): &quot;For God cannot be contained in any location, nor in any vacuum, nor in any space, for He Himself is, of His nature, location and vacuum.&quot;

===Air pressure and the vacuum===
In 1650 von Guericke invented the vacuum pump. His model consisting of a piston and an air gun cylinder with two-way flaps designed to pull air out of whatever vessel it was connected to, and used it to investigate the properties of the vacuum in many experiments. Guericke demonstrated the force of air pressure with dramatic experiments.

In 1657, he machined two 20-inch diameter hemispheres and pumped all the air out of them, locking them together with a vacuum seal. The air pressure outside held the halves together so tightly that sixteen horses, eight harnessed to each side of the globe, could not pull the halves apart. It would have required more than 4,000 pounds of force to separate them. It is estimated that by pumping the air out of these spheres, he was able to reduce the internal pressure to roughly 1/25 of an atmosphere.

With his experiments Guericke disproved the hypothesis of &quot;horror vacui&quot;, that nature abhors a vacuum. Aristotle (e.g. in &quot;Physics&quot; IV 6–9) had argued against the existence of the void and his views commanded near-universal endorsement by philosophers and scientists up to the 17th century. Guericke showed that substances were not pulled by a vacuum, but were pushed by the pressure of the surrounding fluids.

All of von Guericke&#x27;s work on the vacuum and air pressure is described in Book III of the &quot;Experimenta Nova&quot; (1672). As regards the more detailed chronology of his work we have, in addition to the &quot;Experimenta Nova&quot;″s description of his demonstrations at Regensburg in 1654, the two accounts published by Fr. Schott in 1657 and 1663.

In Chapter 27 he alludes to what transpired at Regensburg in 1654. The first experiment he explicitly records as having been demonstrated was the crushing of a non-spherical vessel as the air was withdrawn from it. He did not use a vacuum pump directly on the vessel, but allowed the air in it to expand into a previously evacuated receiver.
The second was an experiment in which a number of men proved able to pull an airtight piston only about halfway up a cylindrical copper vessel. Von Guericke then attached his evacuated receiver to the space below the piston and succeeded in drawing the piston back down again against the force of the men pulling it up. In a letter to Friar Schott of June 1656, reproduced in &quot;Mechanica Hydraulico-pneumatica&quot; (pp. 454–55), von Guericke gives a short account of his experiences at Regensburg. Based on this, Schimank [1936] gives a list of ten experiments that he considers likely to have been carried out at Regensburg. In addition to the above two, these included the extraction of air using a vacuum pump, the extinction of a flame in a sealed vessel, the raising of water by suction, a demonstration that air has weight, and a demonstration of how fog and mist can be produced in a sealed vessel. The &quot;Mechanica Hydraulico-pneumatica&quot; also provides the earliest drawing of von Guericke&#x27;s vacuum pump. This corresponds to the description in the opening chapters of Book III of the &quot;Experimenta Nova&quot; of the first version of his pump.

Stimulated by the interest taken in his work, von Guericke was scientifically very active in the decade after 1654. In June 1656 we find him writing to Fr. Schott (&quot;Mechanica Hydraulico-pneumatica&quot;, p. 444) &quot;Since the time when I produced the exhibition for the said eminent Elector, I have a better and clearer grasp of all these matters and many other topics as well.&quot; The celebrated hemispheres experiment was, as noted in the biographical section above, carried out between July 1656 and August 1657. In Chapter IV of Book III he describes a new and much-improved design of vacuum pump and attributes its invention to the need for a more easily transportable machine with which he could demonstrate his experiments to Frederick William, who had expressed the desire to see them. The new pump is also described on p. 67 of the &quot;Technica Curiosa&quot;. The demonstration in the Elector&#x27;s Library at Cölln an der Spree took place in November 1663 and was recorded by a tutor to the Elector&#x27;s sons. (Schneider p. 113.) A number of experiments, such as the rather cruel testing of the effect of a vacuum on birds and fish (&quot;Experimenta Nova&quot;, Book III, Chapter XVI), are not described in the &quot;Technica Curiosa&quot;. Although the &quot;Experimenta Nova&quot; does contain correspondence from 1665, there is no reason to doubt von Guericke&#x27;s assertion that the work was essentially finished by March 1663.

Throughout Books II and III he returns again and again to the theme of there being no abhorrence of a vacuum and that all the phenomena explained by this supposed principle are in fact attributable to the pressure of the atmosphere in conjunction with various incorporeal potencies which he held to be acting. Thus the Earth&#x27;s &quot;conservative potency&quot; (&quot;virtus conservativa&quot;) provided the explanation for the fact that the Earth retains its atmosphere though travelling through space. In countering the objection of a Dr. Deusing that the weight of the atmosphere would simply crush the bodies of all living things, he shows explicit awareness of the key property of a fluid – that it exerts pressure equally across all planes. In Chapter XXX of Book III he writes: &quot;Dr. Deusing ought to have borne in mind that the air does not just press on our heads but flows all around us. Just as it presses from above on the head, it likewise presses on the soles of the feet from below and simultaneously on all parts of the body from all directions.&quot;

====Relevant research====
In the &quot;Experimenta Nova&quot;, Book III, Chapter 20, von Guericke reports on a barometer he had constructed and its application to weather forecasting. The earliest reference to his barometer is in a letter to Fr. Schott of November 1661 (&quot;Technica Curiosa&quot;, p. 37) where he writes: &quot;I have observed the variation in the weight of the air by using a little man (i.e. a statue in the form of one) who hangs from a wall in my hypocaust where it floats on air in a glass tube and uses a finger to show the weight or lightness of the air. At the same time it indicates whether or not it is raining in nearby localities or whether there is unusually stormy weather at sea.&quot; In a subsequent letter of 30 December 1661 (&quot;Technica Curiosa&quot; p. 52) he gives a somewhat amplified account. His barometer thus prepared the way for meteorology. His later works focused on electricity. He invented the &quot;Elektrisiermaschine&quot;, a version of which is illustrated in the engraving by Hubert-François Gravelot, c. 1750. This device, which is usually identified as the first electrostatic generator, was developed as part of von Guericke&#x27;s interest in the worldly powers (&quot;mundane virtues&quot;) that operated in the universe. Von Guericke also showed that electrical (magnetic) attraction does not require a medium to operate in by an experiment using electrical transmission through linen thread.

===Electrostatic investigations===

Von Guericke thought of the capacity of body to exert an influence beyond its immediate boundaries in terms of &quot;corporeal and incorporeal potencies&quot;. Examples of corporeal potencies were the giving off of fumes, smells, gases etc. by bodies. An example of an incorporeal potency was the Earth&#x27;s &quot;conservative potency&quot; whereby it retained its atmosphere and caused the return of objects thrown upwards to the Earth&#x27;s surface. The Earth also possessed an &quot;expulsive potency&quot; which was deemed to explain why objects that fall bounce back up again. The notion of an &quot;incorporeal potency&quot; is similar to that of &quot;action at a distance&quot;, except the former notion remained purely qualitative and there is no inkling of the fundamental &quot;action and reaction&quot; principle.

Von Guericke describes his work on electrostatics in Chapter 15 of Book IV of the &quot;Experimenta Nova&quot;. In a letter of November 1661 to Fr. Schott, reproduced in the &quot;Technica Curiosa&quot;, he notes that the then projected Book IV would be concerned with &quot;cosmic potencies&quot; (&quot;virtutes mundanae&quot;). Accepting the claim of the preface to the &quot;Experimenta Nova&quot; that the entire work had been essentially completed before March 1663, von Guericke can be fairly credited with inventing a primitive form of frictional electrical machine before 1663. His electrostatic generator was created using a sulphur globe attached to an iron rod. By rubbing the sphere with a dry hand, von Guericke was able to impart a charge imbalance on the surface, which would allow him to attract and repel other objects.

In Chapter 6 of Book IV von Guericke writes: &quot;It seems reasonable to suppose that if the Earth has a fitting and appropriate attractive potency it will also have a potency of repelling things that might be dangerous or disagreeable to it. This is to be seen in the case of the sulphur sphere described below in Chapter 15. When that sphere is stroked or rubbed not only does it attract all light objects, but it sometimes arbitrarily also repels them before attracting them again. Sometimes indeed it doesn&#x27;t even attract them again.&quot; Von Guericke was aware of both Gilbert&#x27;s book &quot;On the Magnet and Magnetic bodies and on the great magnet the Earth&quot; (&quot;De Magnete&quot;) published in 1600 and of the Jesuit Niccolo Cabeo&#x27;s &quot;Philosophia Magnetica&quot; (1629). He does not explicitly acknowledge any anticipation of his demonstration of electrostatic repulsion by the latter but, as he quotes a passage from the same page, could not have been unaware that, in a discussion of the nature of electrical attraction, Cabeo had written (&quot;Philosophia Magnetica&quot;, p. 192): &quot;When we see that small bodies (&quot;corpuscula&quot;) are lifted (&quot;sublevari et attolli&quot;) above the amber and also fall back to the motionless amber, it cannot be said that such erratic behaviour (&quot;talem matum&quot; – but if &quot;matum&quot; is taken as a misprint for &quot;motum&quot;, then the translation is simply &quot;such motion&quot;) is an attraction by the gravity of the attracting body.&quot; In Book IV, Chapter 8 of the &quot;Experimenta Nova&quot; von Guericke is at pains to point out the difference between his own &quot;incorporeal potency&quot; views and Cabeo&#x27;s more Aristotelian conclusions. He writes: &quot;Writers who have written on magnetism, always confuse it with electrical attraction, although there is a great difference. In particular, Gilbert in his book &quot;De Magnete&quot; claims that electrical attraction is caused by the effluence of a humour, that the humid seeks the humid and this is the cause of the attraction. Moreover in &quot;Philosophia Magnetica&quot;, Book 2, Chapter 21, Cabeo criticises Gilbert but does admit that this attraction is created by the agency of an effluent. Humidity does not play any role but the attraction is brought about purely by the agency of an effluent, by which the air is disturbed. After the initial impulse, the air returns to the amber again taking with it little particles. He (Cabeo) concludes by saying: &#x27;I say therefore that from amber or any other electrically attracting body, a very rarefied effluent is emitted which dispels and attenuates the air, extremely agitating it. Then the agitated and attenuated air returns to the amber body sweeping along with it whatever dust or small bodies are in its way&#x27;. We however, who in the previous chapter, take the attraction of the sulphur ball as electrical in nature and operating through a conservative potency, cannot admit that the air plays a role in producing the attraction. Experiment visibly shows that this sulphur globe (once it has been rubbed) also exercises its potency through a linen cord up to a range of a cubit and more and can attract at that distance.&quot; Unknown to them at the time, this &quot;mysterious&quot; attraction and repulsion they had been witnessing was actually electrical conduction.

The key Chapter 15 is titled &quot;On an experiment, in which these potencies, listed above, can be evoked by the rubbing of a sulphur ball.&quot; In Section 3 of this chapter, he describes how light bodies are repelled from a sulphur sphere which has been rubbed with a dry hand, and are not again attracted until they have touched another body. Oldenburg&#x27;s review of the &quot;Experimenta Nova&quot; (November 1672) in the &quot;Proceedings of the Royal Society&quot; sceptically observes: &quot;How far this globe may be confided in, the Tryals and Consideration of some ingenious person here may perhaps inform us hereafter.&quot; In fact, Robert Boyle repeated von Guericke&#x27;s experiments for the Royal Society in November 1672 and February 1673.

<text>In an optical fiber, the material dispersion coefficient, &quot;M&quot;(λ), characterizes the amount of pulse broadening by material dispersion per unit length of fiber and per unit of spectral width. It is usually expressed in picoseconds per (nanometre·kilometre). 

For many optical fiber materials, &quot;M&quot;(λ) approaches zero at a specific wavelength λ0 between 1.3 and 1.5 μm. At wavelengths shorter than λ0, &quot;M&quot;(λ) is negative and increases with wavelength; at wavelengths longer than λ0, &quot;M&quot;(λ) is positive and decreases with wavelength. 

Pulse broadening caused by material dispersion in a unit length of optical fiber is given by the product of &quot;M&quot;(λ) and spectral width (Δλ).

<text>A light pen is a computer input device in the form of a light-sensitive wand used in conjunction with a computer&#x27;s cathode-ray tube (CRT) display.

It allows the user to point to displayed objects or draw on the screen in a similar way to a touchscreen but with greater positional accuracy. A light pen can work with any CRT-based display, but its ability to be used with LCDs was unclear (though Toshiba and Hitachi displayed a similar idea at the &quot;Display 2006&quot; show in Japan).

A light pen detects changes in brightness of nearby screen pixels when scanned by cathode-ray tube electron beam and communicates the timing of this event to the computer. Since a CRT scans the entire screen one pixel at a time, the computer can keep track of the expected time of scanning various locations on screen by the beam and infer the pen&#x27;s position from the latest time stamps.

== History ==

The first light pen, at this time still called &quot;light gun&quot;, was created around 1951–1955 as part of the Whirlwind I project at MIT, where it was used to select discrete symbols on the screen, and later at the SAGE project, where it was used for tactical real-time-control of a radar-networked airspace.

One of the first more widely deployed uses was in the Situation Display consoles of the AN/FSQ-7 for military airspace surveillance. This is not very surprising, given its relationship with the Whirlwind projects. See Semi-Automatic Ground Environment for more details.

During the 1960s, light pens were common on graphics terminals such as the IBM 2250 and were also available for the IBM 3270 text-only terminal.

The first nonlinear editor, the CMX 600 was controlled by a light pen, where operator clicked symbols superimposed on edited footage.

Light pen usage was expanded in the early 1980s to music workstations such as the Fairlight CMI and personal computers such as the BBC Micro and Holborn 9100. IBM PC-compatible MDA (only early versions), CGA, HGC (including HGC+ and InColor) and some EGA graphics cards also featured a connector compatible with a light pen, as did early Tandy 1000 computers, the Thomson MO5 computer family, the Amiga, Atari 8-bit, Commodore 8-bit, some MSX computers and Amstrad PCW home computers. For the MSX computers, Sanyo produced a light pen interface cartridge.

Because the user was required to hold their arm in front of the screen for long periods of time (potentially causing &quot;gorilla arm&quot;) or to use a desk that tilts the monitor, the light pen fell out of use as a general-purpose input device. Light pen was also perceived as working well only on displays with low persistence, which tend to flicker.

<text>In telecommunications, an &quot;n&quot;-ary code is a code that has &quot;n&quot; significant conditions, where &quot;n&quot; is a positive integer greater than 1. The integer substituted for &quot;n&quot; indicates the specific number of significant conditions, &quot;i.e.&quot;, quantization states, in the code. For example, an 8-ary code has eight significant conditions and can convey three bits per code symbol. A prefix that indicates an integer, &quot;e.g.&quot;, &quot;bin&quot;, &quot;tern,&quot; or &quot;quatern&quot;, may be used in lieu of a numeral, to produce &quot;binary&quot;, &quot;ternary&quot;, or &quot;quaternary&quot; (2, 3, and 4 states respectively).

<text>RealMedia is a proprietary multimedia container format created by RealNetworks with the filename extension . RealMedia is used in conjunction with RealVideo and RealAudio, while also being used for streaming content over the Internet. Typically these streams are in CBR (constant bitrate), but a container for VBR (variable bitrate) streams named RMVB (RealMedia variable bitrate) has been developed.

== Overview ==

A RealMedia file consists of a series of chunks that can be of several different types:
* &quot;.RMF&quot;: RealMedia file header
* &quot;PROP&quot;: File properties header
* &quot;MDPR&quot;: Media properties header
* &quot;CONT&quot;: Content description header
* &quot;DATA&quot;: Data header
* &quot;INDX&quot;: Index header

<text>A keyboard instrument is a musical instrument played using a keyboard, a row of levers that are pressed by the fingers. The most common of these are the piano, organ, and various electronic keyboards, including synthesizers and digital pianos. Other keyboard instruments include celestas, which are struck idiophones operated by a keyboard, and carillons, which are usually housed in bell towers or belfries of churches or municipal buildings.

Today, the term &quot;keyboard&quot; often refers to keyboard-style synthesizers and arrangers as well as work-stations. These keyboards typically work by translating the physical act of pressing keys into electrical signals that produce sound. Under the fingers of a sensitive performer, the keyboard may also be used to control dynamics, phrasing, shading, articulation, and other elements of expression—depending on the design and inherent capabilities of the instrument. Modern keyboards, especially digital ones, can simulate a wide range of sounds beyond traditional piano tones, thanks to advanced sound synthesis techniques and digital sampling technology.

Another important use of the word &quot;keyboard&quot; is in historical musicology, where it means an instrument whose identity cannot be firmly established. Particularly in the 18th century, the harpsichord, the clavichord, and the early piano competed, and the same piece might be played on more than one. Hence, in a phrase such as &quot;Mozart excelled as a keyboard player&quot;, the word &quot;keyboard&quot; is typically all-inclusive.

The term keyboard classifies instruments based on how the performer plays the instrument, and not on how the sound is produced. Categories of keyboard instruments include the following families (of which this is only a partial list):
*[[aerophone]]s (pipe organ, pump organ, accordion);
*[[idiophone]]s (celesta, carillon, glasschord);
*[[String instrument|chordophones]]:
**&quot;plucked string instruments&quot; (harpsichord, tangent piano, lautenwerck);
**&quot;bowed string instruments&quot; (hurdy-gurdy, bowed clavier);
**&quot;struck string instruments&quot; (clavichord, piano);
*[[Electronic musical instrument|electrophones]] (electric pianos, electric and electronic organs, synthesizers, mellotron).

== History ==
The earliest known keyboard instrument was the Ancient Greek hydraulis, a type of pipe organ invented in the third century BC. The keys were likely balanced and could be played with a light touch, as is clear from the reference in a Latin poem by Claudian (late 4th century), who says &quot;magna levi detrudens murmura tactu . . . intonet,&quot; that is &quot;let him thunder forth as he presses out mighty roarings with a light touch&quot; (&quot;Paneg. Manlio Theodoro,&quot; 320–22). From its invention until the fourteenth century, the organ remained the only keyboard instrument. Often, the organ did not feature a keyboard at all, but rather buttons or large levers operated by a whole hand. Almost every keyboard until the fifteenth century had seven naturals to each octave.

The clavicymbalum, clavichord, and the harpsichord appeared during the fourteenth century—the clavichord probably being earlier. The harpsichord and clavichord were both common until the widespread adoption of the piano in the eighteenth century, after which their popularity decreased. The first template for the modern piano was introduced in 1698 in Italy by Bartolomeo Cristofori as the &quot;gravicèmbalo con piano e forte&quot; (&quot;harpsichord with soft and loud&quot;), also shortened to &quot;pianoforte&quot;, as it allowed the pianist to control the dynamics by adjusting the force with which each key was struck. In its current form, the piano is a product of further developments made since the late nineteenth century and is distinct in both sound and appearance from the instruments known to earlier pianists, including Mozart, Haydn, and Beethoven. Beginning in the twentieth century, early electromechanical instruments, such as the Ondes Martenot, began to appear as well. Later in the 20th century, electronic keyboards appeared.

<text>Local exchange carrier (LEC) is a regulatory term in telecommunications for the local telephone company.

In the United States, wireline telephone companies are divided into two large categories: long-distance (interexchange carrier, or IXCs) and local (local exchange carrier, or LECs). This structure is a result of 1984 divestiture of then-regulated monopoly carrier American Telephone &amp; Telegraph. Local telephone companies at the time of the divestiture are also known as Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers (ILEC).

The divestiture created local exchange carriers for the management of local telephone lines and switches, and provisioning of local phone services within their business area, as well as the long-distance calls originating or terminating in their business area. The vast majority of the United States are served by LECs called Baby Bells, or RBOCs (Regional Bell Operating Companies). The rest of the United States, most commonly in rural or outlying suburban areas, are served by independent LECs, known in the industry simply as the &quot;independents.&quot; Although independent companies typically serve these areas, RBOC LECs still have vast territories of low population density regions of the country. Therefore, independents generally exist as pockets of territory within a greater RBOC region. Popular independents are Frontier Communications, and Windstream Communications.

Local calls are defined as calls originating and terminating within a local access and transport area (LATA) which is defined by the Federal Communications Commission. All of the Baby Bells, as well as other LECs, typically operate businesses in more than one LATA yet their services of local telephone calls are still defined by LATA boundaries, not their business areas.

==Residential local exchange services==
The following information applied to residential local telephone service in the Detroit, Michigan area during the 1970s and 1980s. Much about this subject has changed dramatically since that time, and continues to do so.

A local exchange carrier is a carrier of telephone calls and other communication services carried by telephone lines. A local exchange is generally either an exchange within one&#x27;s own LATA or in an immediately adjacent LATA. A call that is neither local nor long-distance is called a local toll call. A local exchange carrier normally sells package deals that include local and local toll calls. Local calls are customarily billed in by the call, or in blocks of calls. Residential local exchange carrier services typically charges formula_1, where formula_2 is the monthly minimum and covers the first formula_3 calls, formula_4 is the price per local call, and formula_5 is the total quantity of calls consumed. Local toll calls are each billed at formula_6, where formula_2 is minimum charge for a local toll call, formula_4 is the per-minute charge, and formula_9 is the duration of the call in minutes. Local toll calls are traditionally grouped into two price ranges, called &quot;near zone&quot; and &quot;far zone&quot;, with values of formula_2 and formula_4 higher for far zone.

==Duties==
Generally, the local exchange carrier has the following duties: 
* Resale – The duty not to prohibit, and not to impose unreasonable or discriminatory conditions or limitations on, the resale of its telecommunications services. 
* Number portability – The duty to provide, to the extent technically feasible, number portability in accordance with requirements prescribed by the Commission. 
* Dialing parity – The duty to provide dialing parity to competing providers of telephone exchange service and telephone toll service, and the duty to permit all such providers to have nondiscriminatory access to telephone numbers, operator services, directory assistance, and directory listing, with no unreasonable dialing delays. 
* Access to right-of-way – The duty to afford access to the poles, ducts, conduits, and rights-of-way of such carrier to competing providers of telecommunications services on rates, terms, and conditions that are consistent with section 224. 
* Reciprocal compensation – The duty to establish reciprocal compensation arrangements for the transport and termination of telecommunications.
