<text>Izear Luster &quot;Ike&quot; Turner Jr. (November 5, 1931 – December 12, 2007) was an American musician, bandleader, songwriter, record producer, and talent scout. An early pioneer of 1950s rock and roll, he is best known for his work in the 1960s and 1970s with his wife Tina Turner as the leader of the Ike &amp; Tina Turner Revue.

A native of Clarksdale, Mississippi, Turner began playing piano and guitar as a child and then formed the Kings of Rhythm as a teenager. His first recording, &quot;Rocket 88&quot; (credited to Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats), is considered a contender for the distinction of first rock and roll song. During the 1950s, Turner also worked as a talent scout and producer for Sun Records and Modern Records. He was instrumental in the early careers of various blues musicians such as B.B. King, Howlin&#x27; Wolf, and Bobby &quot;Blue&quot; Bland. In 1954, Turner relocated to East St. Louis where his Kings of Rhythm became one of the most renowned acts in Greater St. Louis. He formed the Ike &amp; Tina Turner Revue in 1960, which over the course of the decade became a soul/rock crossover success.

Turner&#x27;s cocaine addiction and legal troubles, together with accounts by Tina Turner of domestic violence (published in her 1986 autobiography &quot;I, Tina&quot; and the 1993 film adaptation &quot;What&#x27;s Love Got to Do with It&quot;), had an impact on his career. Addicted to cocaine for at least 15 years, Turner was convicted of drug offenses and served 18 months in prison. After his release in 1991, he relapsed in 2004, and died of a drug overdose in 2007. During the last decade of his life, Turner revived his career as a frontman by returning to his blues roots. He released two award-winning albums, &quot;Here and Now&quot; (2001) and &quot;Risin&#x27; with the Blues&quot; (2006).

Hailed as a &quot;great innovator&quot; of rock and roll by contemporaries such as Little Richard and Johnny Otis, Turner received critical acclaim as well. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; editor David Fricke ranked Turner No. 61 on his list of 100 Greatest Guitarists and noted, &quot;Turner was one of the first guitarists to successfully transplant the intensity of the blues into more commercial music.&quot; Turner won five Grammy Awards, including two competitive awards and three Grammy Hall of Fame Awards. He also received the Recording Academy&#x27;s Heroes Award. Turner was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with Tina Turner in 1991. As a solo artist he is inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame, the Clarksdale Walk of Fame, the Mississippi Musicians Hall of Fame, the Blues Hall of Fame, and the Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame.

== Early life ==
Izear Luster Turner Jr. was born in Clarksdale, Mississippi, on November 5, 1931, to Beatrice Cushenberry, a seamstress, and Izear Luster Turner, a Baptist minister. His parents were Creole. Turner was the younger of their two children; his sister, Lee Ethel Knight, was &quot;some ten years&quot; his senior. When Turner applied for his first passport in the 1960s, he discovered that his name was registered as Ike Wister Turner. By then both of his parents were deceased, so he could not verify the origin of his name.

Blues historian Ted Drozdowski claimed that Turner&#x27;s father died in an industrial accident;
according to Turner, he witnessed his father beaten and left for dead by a white man (another account given by Turner alleged that &quot;a couple of pickup-truck loads of whites in khaki pants and khaki shirts&quot; dragged his father away, returning him after having &quot;kicked holes in his stomach&quot;). He claimed he was later told this assault was an act of retaliation over a woman with whom his father was having an affair, and that his father lived for two or three years as an invalid in a tent erected by the Health Department in the family&#x27;s yard before succumbing to his injuries when Turner was about five years old. Donald Brackett, author of &quot;Tumult! The Incredible Life of Tina Turner&quot;, observed Turner &quot;often related&quot; this story, but that &quot;like most Ike stories, it might need to be taken with a pound of salt.&quot;

His mother remarried an artist named Philip Reese, who Turner described as a violent alcoholic. One day after Reese gave him a whipping, Turner knocked him out with a length of lumber and ran away to Memphis for a few days before returning home. Despite their troubled relationship, Turner moved his stepfather into one of his homes in St. Louis after his mother died in 1959 and took care of him until his death in 1961.

Turner recounted how he was sexually assaulted at the age of six by a woman called Miss Boozie. Walking past her house to school, she would invite him to help feed her chickens and then take him to bed. This continued daily for some time. Turner was also sexually assaulted by another middle-aged woman, Miss Reedy, before he was twelve. Reflecting on these experiences, he stated: &quot;That&#x27;s probably why every relationship I was in was surrounded by sex. Sex was power to me.&quot;
Turner attended Booker T. Washington Elementary School, then was promoted to Myrtle Hall in the sixth grade. He quit school in the eighth grade and began working as an elevator operator at the Alcazar Hotel in downtown Clarksdale. During breaks, he would watch DJ John Friskillo play records at the radio station, WROX, located in the hotel. WROX is noted for being the first radio station in Mississippi to employ a black DJ, Early Wright. One day, Friskillo spotted Turner watching and put him to work, teaching him the ins and outs of the control room. Soon, he was left to play records while Friskillo took coffee breaks. This led to Turner being offered a job by the station manager as the DJ on the late-afternoon shift. On his show, &quot;Jive Till Five&quot;, he played a diverse range of music such as Roy Milton and Louis Jordan alongside early rockabilly records.

Turner was inspired to learn the piano after he heard blues pianist Pinetop Perkins play at his friend Ernest Lane&#x27;s house. Turner persuaded his mother to pay for piano lessons, but he did not take to the formal style of playing. Instead, he spent the money in a pool hall and learned boogie-woogie from Perkins. At some point in the 1940s, Turner moved into Clarksdale&#x27;s Riverside Hotel. The Riverside played host to touring musicians, including Sonny Boy Williamson II and Duke Ellington. Turner associated with many of these musicians, and at 13 years old he backed Sonny Boy Williamson II on piano.

== Career ==

=== 1946–1950: Formation of the Kings of Rhythm ===
As a teenager, Turner joined a local rhythm ensemble called the Tophatters, who played around Clarksdale, Mississippi. Members of the band were Clarksdale musicians and included Turner&#x27;s school friends Raymond Hill, Eugene Fox and Clayton Love. The Tophatters played big band arrangements from sheet music. Turner, who was trained by ear and could not sight read, would learn the pieces by listening to a version on record at home, pretending to be reading the music during rehearsals. The Tophatters had over 30 members, but they broke up into two groups after six months to a year. One faction wanted to play jazz music and became the Dukes of Swing. The other band led by Turner became the Kings of Rhythm. Turner said, &quot;we wanted to play blues, boogie-woogie and Roy Brown, Jimmy Liggins, Roy Milton.&quot; Turner kept the name throughout his career, although it went through lineup changes over time. Their early stage performances consisted largely of covers of popular jukebox hits. B.B. King helped them to get a steady weekend gig and recommended them to Sam Phillips at Memphis Recording Service. In the 1950s, Turner&#x27;s group got regular airplay from live sessions on the radio stations WROX in Clarksdale and KFFA in Helena, Arkansas.

Around the time he was starting out with the Kings of Rhythm, Turner and Lane became unofficial roadies for blues musician Robert Nighthawk, who often played live on WROX. The pair played drums and piano on radio sessions. Turner gained experience performing by supporting Nighthawk at gigs around Clarksdale. He played juke joints alongside other local blues artists such as Elmore James, Muddy Waters, and Little Walter. Performances typically lasted about twelve hours, from early evening to dawn the next day. Turner recalled, &quot;there wasn&#x27;t no intermission. If the drummer had to pee, I would play drums until he returned...There were no breaks. We just switched around.&quot;

=== 1951: &quot;Rocket 88&quot; ===

In March 1951, Turner and his band recorded the song &quot;Rocket 88&quot; at Memphis Recording Service. Turner&#x27;s vocalist Johnny O&#x27;Neal had left to sign a solo contract with King Records, so Jackie Brenston, a saxophonist in the Kings of Rhythm, sang lead vocals while Turner was on piano. &quot;Rocket 88&quot; is notable among other things for Willie Kizart&#x27;s distorted guitar sound.

Phillips licensed the recording to Chess Records in Chicago. Chess released it under the name &quot;Jackie Brenston and His Delta Cats&quot; instead of &quot;Ike Turner and His Kings of Rhythm Featuring Jackie Brenston&quot;. Turner blamed Phillips for this misrepresentation. Soon after its release, the single caused a sensation and Turner performed with his band at the W.C. Handy Theatre in Memphis.

The single reached number-one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B charts in June 1951 and spent 5 weeks on top of the charts. The record sold approximately half a million copies. Turner and the band were paid $20 each for the record. The exception was Brenston, who sold the rights to Phillips for $910. Phillips used profits from the success of the record to launch Sun Records in February 1952.

The song is often cited as the first rock n&#x27; roll record, but in a later interview, Turner offered this assessment: &quot;I don&#x27;t think that &#x27;Rocket 88&#x27; is rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll. I think that &#x27;Rocket 88&#x27; is R&amp;B, but I think &#x27;Rocket 88&#x27; is the cause of rock and roll existing&quot;.

The success of &quot;Rocket 88&quot; generated tension and ego clashes in the band which culminated with Brenston leaving to pursue a solo career, causing the band to fall apart. Turner, without a band and disappointed his hit record had not created more opportunities for him, disbanded the Kings of Rhythm for a few years.

=== 1951–1954: Session musician and talent scout ===
Soon after the release of &quot;Rocket 88&quot;, Turner moved to West Memphis, Arkansas and played with various local bands. He then became a freelance talent scout, session musician, and production assistant for Sam Phillips at Sun Studio, commuting to Memphis, Tennessee. Wishing to exploit his Delta music connections, the Bihari brothers at Modern Records also hired Turner as a talent scout, paying him to find southern musicians who might be worth recording. Turner arranged for B.B. King and the Beale Streeters to record for Modern at the YMCA in Memphis. Turner played piano on King&#x27;s early records &quot;You Know I Love You&quot; and &quot;3 O&#x27;Clock Blues&quot;, which became King&#x27;s first two number-ones. According to Joe Bihari, Turner had brought King to his attention years prior. He said, &quot;Ike wasn&#x27;t more than sixteen then. He would send dubs of things he cut to us, and if we&#x27;d like them we&#x27;d make a seal or sign the artist. That&#x27;s how we acquired B.B. King.&quot; King also maintained that Turner introduced him to the Bihari brothers.

Unaware of songwriter&#x27;s royalties, Turner also wrote new material which the Biharis copyrighted under their own names. They often purchased or claimed co-writer credit of songs written by artists on their labels using pseudonyms. Turner estimated he wrote seventy-eight hit records for the Biharis. Artists Turner discovered for Modern and Sun include Bobby Bland, Howlin&#x27; Wolf, Rosco Gordon, Boyd Gilmore, Houston Boines, Charley Booker, and Little Milton. He played piano in sessions with them and lesser-known artists such as the Prisonaires, Driftin&#x27; Slim, Ben Burton, Matt Cockrell, Dennis Binder, Sunny Blair, and Baby Face Turner.

Turner was contracted to the Bihari brothers, but he continued to work for Phillips, where he was effectively the in-house producer. This sometimes created conflicts of interest. In 1951, Turner recorded two Howlin&#x27; Wolf tracks for Phillips, playing piano on &quot;How Many More Years&quot; and &quot;Moanin&#x27; at Midnight&quot;, which Phillips sent to Chess. Turner and Howlin&#x27; Wolf then recorded a version of &quot;Moanin&#x27; at Midnight&quot; at radio station KWEM in West Memphis without Phillips&#x27; or the Chess brothers&#x27; knowledge. He sent the results to the Biharis at Modern and they released it on their subsidiary label RPM Records. Turner also attempted to poach Elmore James from Trumpet Records and record him for Modern. Trumpet found out and Modern had to cancel the record. However, James did eventually sign with Modern, and Turner played on his recordings that were released on Modern&#x27;s subsidiary label Flair Records.

While in Helena, Turner tried to recruit Little Walter to record for Modern in January 1952, but Little Walter was on his way to Mississippi. In 1952, Turner discovered Little Junior Parker in West Memphis, and they formed a band with Matt &quot;Guitar&quot; Murphy. Turner recorded Parker&#x27;s first single, &quot;You&#x27;re My Angel&quot; / &quot;Bad Women, Bad Whiskey&quot;, credited to Little Junior Parker and the Blue Flames. That summer Turner recorded with the new vocalist and pianist in his band, Marion Louis Lee, resulting in &quot;My Heart Belongs to You&quot; / &quot;Looking for My Baby&quot;. The records were released on RPM as Bonnie and Ike Turner and they performed together at the Hippodrome in Memphis. Turner married Lee in September 1952.

Unbeknownst to Turner, during his time in West Memphis, he met Elvis Presley, who was a truck driver. He recalled, &quot;[Presley] was just a white boy that would come over to black clubs. He would come in and stand behind the piano and watch me play. I never knew he was no musician.&quot; Turner discovered his identity many years later after Presley approached him when they were both playing at the International Hotel.

To accommodate his then-wife Bonnie, who also played piano, Turner taught himself how to play guitar by ear, and Willie Kizart taught him blues guitar techniques. He began playing guitar in sessions in 1953, and by 1954, with the assistance of Joe Bihari, he built a makeshift recording studio at a defunct Greyhound bus station in Clarksdale. Turner used his Kings of Rhythm as session musicians. They played on many recordings for Bihari&#x27;s Modern, RPM, and Flair labels. Some of the artists Turner backed on piano and guitar during this period include Elmore James, Johnny Ace and the Flairs. Around this time Turner discovered Billy &quot;The Kid&quot; Emerson in Greenville. He brought Emerson to record at Sun Records and backed him on guitar in 1954.

=== 1954–1959: St. Louis ===
In 1954, Turner visited his sister Lee Ethel Knight in St. Louis, Missouri. During his stay, he went clubbing at Ned Love&#x27;s in East St. Louis, Illinois. Love invited Turner and his band to play at his club. Eventually, Turner returned with his reformed version of the Kings of Rhythm. The band consisted of Willie Kizart on guitar, Willie &quot;Bad Boy&quot; Sims on drums, vocalist Johnny O&#x27;Neal, Turner&#x27;s nephew Jesse Knight Jr. on bass, and Turner&#x27;s wife Annie Mae Wilson on piano and vocals.

Turner maintained strict discipline and the band lived at his home on Virginia Place in East St. Louis which doubled as a studio. A teetotaler at the time, he avoided drugs and insisted all band members also adopt this policy, firing anyone he even suspected of breaking the rules. Turner established his group as one of the most highly rated on the St. Louis club circuit, vying for popularity with their main competition, Sir John&#x27;s Trio featuring Chuck Berry. The bands would play all-nighters in St. Louis, then cross the river to the clubs of East St. Louis, and continue playing until dawn. Initially, they played for predominately black audiences at clubs in Illinois such as the Club Manhattan in East St. Louis, which Turner and his band built, the Club Riviera in St. Louis, the Harlem Club in Brookline and the Kingsbury in Madison. In St. Louis, Turner was exposed to a white audience who were excited by R&amp;B. He played at the Moonlight Bar, Latin Quarter, and the Club Imperial, which was popular with white teenagers. He also gained a big following at Club DeLisa and locally he was acknowledged as the &quot;King of Rock and Roll.&quot; As his popularity grew among both whites and blacks, he demanded that the clubs should be integrated. He performed regularly on Dave Dixon&#x27;s radio show, which aired live from the Birdcage Lounge, on KSTL. He also had live music broadcasts on the St. Louis radio station KATZ.

In between live dates, Turner took the band to Cincinnati to record for Federal Records in 1956. The single, &quot;I&#x27;m Tore Up&quot; / &quot;If I Never Had Known You&quot; featuring Billy Gayles, was released in April 1956. It became a regional hit and Turner&#x27;s booking fee doubled after its release. Like Brenston years prior, Gayles left Turner&#x27;s band to pursue a solo career. In 1958, Turner took the band to Chicago to record for Cobra/Artistic, as well as fulfilling his contract as a session musician back at Sun. While in Chicago, Turner backed Otis Rush, playing the signature vibrato guitar parts on &quot;Double Trouble&quot;. He also helped Buddy Guy record his second record, resulting in the single &quot;You Sure Can&#x27;t Do&quot; / &quot;This Is The End&quot;, on which Turner played guitar and composed the latter.

Turner befriended St. Louis R&amp;B fan Bill Stevens, who set up the short-lived Stevens Records in 1959. Turner released two singles on the Stevens label, &quot;Jack Rabbit&quot; / &quot;In Your Eyes Baby&quot; and &quot;Ho–Ho&quot; / &quot;Hey–Hey.&quot; He used the anagram &quot;Icky Renrut&quot; because he was still under contract with Sun for several more months, and he didn&#x27;t want to cause friction with Phillips. In addition, Turner recorded numerous sessions for Stevens with various vocalists and musician lineups of the Kings of Rhythm.

=== 1960–1976: The Ike and Tina Turner Revue ===
In 1956, Ann Bullock accompanied her sister Alline Bullock to watch Turner and the Kings of Rhythm at the Club Manhattan in East St. Louis. Alline was a barmaid at the club and was dating Turner&#x27;s drummer Eugene Washington. Through her sister and Washington, Ann Bullock asked Turner to sing with his band. Turner said he&#x27;d call her onstage, but he never did. One night during an intermission, she got hold of the microphone from Washington and sang &quot;You Know I Love You&quot; by B.B. King. Impressed by her voice, Turner invited her to sing with the band. She made her recording debut on Turner&#x27;s song &quot;Boxtop&quot;, released on Tune Town Records in 1958.

In March 1960, Turner allowed her to record a demo of his self-penned song &quot;A Fool in Love&quot;. He intended to use the demo as guide track for Art Lassiter, who did not attend the scheduled recording session at Technisonic Studios. A local DJ suggested he send the record to Sue Records in New York, where label owner Juggy Murray insisted on releasing the track with Bullock&#x27;s vocal. Murray offered a $20,000 advance for the song and suggested Turner &quot;make her the star&quot; of his show. Turner then renamed her &quot;Tina&quot; because it rhymed with Sheena; however, family and friends still called her Ann. He was inspired by Sheena, Queen of the Jungle and Nyoka the Jungle Girl to create her stage persona. He had the name &quot;Tina Turner&quot; trademarked, so that in case she left, another singer could perform under the same name.

The single &quot;A Fool In Love&quot; was released in July 1960, and it became a national hit, selling a million copies. It peaked at No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart and No. 27 on the Hot 100. Turner added a backing girl group he renamed the Ikettes, and along with the Kings of Rhythm they began performing as the Ike &amp; Tina Turner Revue. The success of the single was followed by a string of hits including &quot;I Idolize You&quot;, &quot;Poor Fool&quot;, and &quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Work Out Fine&quot; which gave them their second million-seller and their first Grammy nomination.

In 1961, Turner played piano on Albert King&#x27;s first hit record, &quot;Don&#x27;t Throw Your Love on Me So Strong&quot;. The single, released on King Records, peaked at No. 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart. He also wrote and produced the Ikettes hit &quot;I&#x27;m Blue (The Gong-Gong Song)&quot;.

The Revue performed rigorously on the Chitlin&#x27; Circuit and built a reputation as &quot;one of the hottest, most durable, and potentially most explosive of all R&amp;B ensembles.&quot; To assure he always had a record out while on tour, Turner formed multiple labels such as Sputnik, Teena, Prann, Innis, Sony and Sonja. He produced singles by the Ikettes, Jimmy Thomas, Fontella Bass, George Jackson, and other artists on his labels. The duo switched to Turner&#x27;s Sonja label in 1963. For the next six years, they recorded on Warner Bros./Loma, Modern/Kent, Cenco, Philles, Tangerine, Pompeii, Blue Thumb, Minit, and A&amp;M. Between 1964 and 1965, they scored fourteen top 40 R&amp;B hits with &quot;You Can&#x27;t Miss Nothing That You Never Had&quot;, &quot;Tell Her I&#x27;m Not Home&quot;, &quot;Good Bye, So Long&quot;, and &quot;Two Is a Couple&quot;. Around this time, Jimi Hendrix briefly played backing guitar in the band.

In 1965, Phil Spector saw them perform at a club on the Sunset Strip and invited them to film &quot;The Big T.N.T. Show&quot;. Impressed by their performance, Spector negotiated a deal with their manager Bob Krasnow, head of Loma Records, offering $20,000 to produce Tina and have them released from their Loma contract. After Tina and Spector recorded &quot;River Deep – Mountain High&quot;, the duo signed to Spector&#x27;s Philles label in 1966. The failure of the single in America triggered Spector&#x27;s retreat from the music industry. However, it was a hit in Europe, reaching No. 3 on the UK Singles Chart and No. 1 on Los 40 Principales in Spain. Following the song&#x27;s success in the UK, Mick Jagger invited them to open for the Rolling Stones on their 1966 British Tour. This exposure introduced them to a wider audience outside of R&amp;B. Soon they were booking bigger venues, and by 1969 they were headlining in Las Vegas.

In April 1969, Turner and the Kings of Rhythm released an album, &quot;A Black Man&#x27;s Soul&quot;, on Pompeii Records. The album earned Turner his first solo Grammy nomination for Best R&amp;B Instrumental Performance at the 12th Annual Grammy Awards. Later that year, the duo released the blues-oriented albums &quot;Outta Season&quot; and &quot;The Hunter&quot; on Blue Thumb Records. Turner and Bob Krasnow, founder of Blue Thumb, co-produced Earl Hooker&#x27;s 1969 album &quot;Sweet Black Angel&quot;. In November, the Ike &amp; Tina Turner Revue opened for the Rolling Stones on their 1969 American Tour.

In January 1970, they performed on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; and released their rendition of &quot;Come Together&quot;, which reached No. 21 on the R&amp;B chart. Their cover of &quot;I Want to Take You Higher&quot; by Sly and the Family Stone was also successful on the charts in 1970. Turner, who was a friend of Sly Stone, played guitar on Sly and the Family Stone&#x27;s album &quot;There&#x27;s a Riot Goin&#x27; On&quot; (1971). The release of &quot;Proud Mary&quot; in 1971 became Ike &amp; Tina Turner&#x27;s biggest hit, reaching No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and No. 5 on the R&amp;B chart. It sold more than a million copies, and won the duo a Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Vocal Performance by a Group at the 14th Annual Grammy Awards.

Their mainstream success provided Turner with the finances to open his own recording studio, Bolic Sound in Inglewood, in 1972. Turner had two sixteen track studios built, a large one to rent out and a smaller one for his personal recordings. He fitted them out with state-of-the-art equipment. Artists who recorded there included Paul McCartney, George Harrison, Duane Allman, Little Richard, Gayle McCormick, and Frank Zappa.

Turner released two solo albums for United Artists Records, &quot;Blues Roots&quot; (1972) and &quot;Bad Dreams&quot; (1973). In 1973, the duo released &quot;Nutbush City Limits&quot; penned by Tina. The single peaked at No. 22 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, No. 11 on the R&amp;B chart and it was a bigger hit in Europe. The Turners received the Golden European Record Award, the first ever given, for selling more than one million records of &quot;Nutbush City Limits&quot; in Europe.

During this period, Turner produced singer Judy Cheeks&#x27; debut album &quot;Judy Cheeks&quot; (1973), and the last album by the Ikettes, &quot;(G)Old &amp; New&quot; (1974). In 1974, Ike and Tina released the album &quot;The Gospel According to Ike &amp; Tina Turner.&quot; The album was nominated for Best Soul Gospel &quot;Performance&quot;. Turner also earned a solo nomination for his single &quot;Father Alone&quot;. Between 1974 and 1975, the duo released the singles &quot;Sweet Rhode Island Red&quot;, &quot;Sexy Ida&quot;, and &quot;Baby, Get It On&quot;.The Ike &amp; Tina Turner Revue ended abruptly in 1976. That year, they headlined at the Waldorf Astoria New York and signed a television deal with CBS-TV. Turner had plans to leave United Artists Records for a five-year $150,000 per year deal with Cream Records, which was to be signed on July 6. On July 1, the Turners got into a violent altercation en route to their gig at the Dallas Statler Hilton. Turner later claimed that Tina initiated the conflict by purposely irritating him so that she would have a reason to break up with him before they signed the new contract. Tina fled from the hotel shortly after they arrived, and filed for divorce on July 27, 1976. She would later describe a relationship in which Turner was frequently violent and abusive, sometimes beating her with wooden objects like a shoe-stretcher or hanger. The night she left, his beating left her face bruised, swollen, and bleeding.

United Artists responded to the Turners&#x27; separation by releasing albums of compiled recordings from their last sessions together, &quot;Delilah&#x27;s Power&quot; (1977) and &quot;Airwaves&quot; (1978). Two years after their divorce was finalized, Turner released the single &quot;Party Vibes&quot; / &quot;Shame, Shame, Shame&quot; from the album &quot;The Edge&quot; (1980) which peaked at No. 27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Disco Top 100 chart.

=== 1977–2007: Later career ===
After his breakup with Tina, singer Holly Maxwell sang with Turner on occasion from 1977 to 1985 and again for eight months in 1992. She reported a positive working relationship with Turner, and later released the memoir &quot;Freebase Ain&#x27;t Free&quot; about their close friendship. In 1979, Turner spent time in the studio with Chaka Khan following her separation from her manager-husband. She told &quot;Jet&quot;: &quot;He&#x27;s been real inspiration and a catalyst emotionally and in other ways as well. We plan to record together.&quot; Turner struggled to find success due to his cocaine addiction and run-ins with the law. In 1988, Turner attempted an ill-fated return to the stage with Marcy Thomas, Bonnie Johnson, and Jeanette Bazzell as his Ikettes.

While Turner was in prison following a drug conviction, Ike &amp; Tina Turner were inducted to the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in 1991. Tina did not attend because she took the year off from making public appearances, so Phil Spector delivered a speech at the ceremony on their behalf. After his release from prison, Turner told the press that he was nervous about returning to performing live, but had plans to return to the studio. He sold 20 unreleased Ike &amp; Tina Turner masters to the independent label Esquire Records. In 1992, Turner performed as a special guest at Oliver Sain&#x27;s Soul Reunion concert at Mississippi Nights in St. Louis.

Hip-hop group Salt-N-Pepa sampled Turner&#x27;s composition &quot;I&#x27;m Blue (The Gong Gong Song)&quot;, released by the Ikettes in 1961, for their 1993 single &quot;Shoop&quot;. The song reached No. 4 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and Turner earned around half a million dollars in royalties. He re-recorded &quot;I&#x27;m Blue&quot; as a duet with singer Billy Rogers in 1995. Produced by Rogers, the remake received favorable reviews. Turner later appeared on the song &quot;Love Gravy&quot; with Rick James for the soundtrack album &quot;Chef Aid: The South Park Album&quot;.

Turner reformed the Ikettes in the mid-1990s, which included his then-wife Jeanette Bazzell Turner, Nina Hill, and Michelle Love (Randi Love). Vera Clyburn, who was an Ikette in the 1970s, was the lead singer. They performed to positive reviews as the Ike Turner Revue. In August 1997, Turner returned to his hometown Clarksdale to headline the 10th Annual Sunflower River Blues &amp; Gospel Festival. Turner credited Joe Louis Walker with encouraging him to return to his roots in blues music. Turner played guitar and assisted in the production on Walker&#x27;s 1997 album &quot;Great Guitars&quot;; Walker paid him $5,000 a night for six songs. Walker invited Turner to perform with him at the San Francisco Blues Festival and to tour in Europe. The positive response to the tour encouraged Turner to reform the Kings of Rhythm. They toured the US in 2001, and headlined a showcase at South by Southwest, where they were hailed as one of the highlights of the conference. Turner&#x27;s work on the tour led to the recording and release of his Grammy-nominated album &quot;Here &amp; Now&quot; (2001). In 2002, Turner&#x27;s performance at the Montreux Jazz Festival was released as a live album and DVD.

In 2002, Turner filmed Martin Scorsese&#x27;s PBS documentary series &quot;The Blues&quot;, which aired in September 2003. He is featured in the documentaries &quot;The Road to Memphis&quot; and &quot;Godfathers and Sons&quot;, as part of the series. Turner appeared on the Gorillaz&#x27;s album &quot;Demon Days&quot; (2005), playing piano on &quot;Every Planet We Reach Is Dead&quot;. He performed the song with Gorillaz at the Manchester Opera House in November 2005. His performance is featured in the live concert DVD &quot;Demon Days: Live at the Manchester Opera House&quot;.

In 2006, Turner released his last album, &quot;Risin&#x27; With the Blues&quot;, on the independent label Zoho Roots. The album received positive critical reception, and was nominated for best Blues Album at the 7th Annual Independent Music Awards. Turner won his first solo Grammy Award for Best Traditional Blues Album at the 49th Annual Grammy Awards in 2007.

Turner began working on a collaboration album with Gorillaz&#x27;s producer Danger Mouse and the Black Keys in early 2007. The Black Keys sent demos to Turner, but the project was temporarily shelved. After Turner&#x27;s death, the songs were used for their 2008 album &quot;Attack &amp; Release&quot;. Although Turner does not appear on the album, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; noted his influence in the production.

== Artistry and legacy ==
=== Musical style ===

In his career, Turner originally worked in the style of 1950s R&amp;B, or post-jump blues. His early influences included Amos Milburn and Louis Jordan, as well as country music artists such as Hank Williams Sr. and Merle Travis. Though primarily known as a guitarist, Turner began his career playing piano and personally considered it his main instrument. In 1951, journalist Mike McGee compared him to jazz pianist Fats Waller and wrote: &quot;Ike Turner is the hottest piano player in many a day.&quot;

Turner grew up playing boogie woogie piano, which he learned from blues pianist Pinetop Perkins. He decided he was not meant to be a frontman when at twelve he was coerced into giving an impromptu piano recital in school. He found the experience terrifying and from then on preferred not to be the focus of attention, but rather to be in the background controlling the show. He considered himself an organizer rather than a performer. Musician Donald Fagen noted: &quot;[T]alented as he was, there wasn&#x27;t anything really supernatural about Ike&#x27;s skills as a musician... What Ike excelled at was leadership: conceptualization, organization, and execution.&quot;

Turner&#x27;s guitar style is distinguished by heavy use of the whammy bar to achieve a strong reverb-soaked vibrato, string bending, hammer-ons and triplets in his blues phrasing. Turner was an early adopter of the Fender Stratocaster electric guitar, buying one from O.K. Houk&#x27;s Piano Co. store in Memphis the year of its release in 1954. Unaware that the guitar&#x27;s tremolo arm could be used to subtle effect, Turner used it to play screaming, swooping and diving solos that predated artists such as Jimi Hendrix and Jeff Beck by a decade. In &quot;The Stratocaster Chronicles&quot;, Tom Wheeler wrote that Turner&#x27;s &quot;inventive style is a classic example of an artist discovering the Stratocaster, adapting to its features and fashioning something remarkable.&quot; Turner himself said of his tremolo technique: &quot;I thought it was to make the guitar scream—people got so excited when I used that thing.&quot; Dave Rubin wrote in &quot;Premier Guitar&quot; magazine: &quot;All those years of playing piano and arranging taught him a considerable amount about harmony, as he could certainly navigate I-IV-V chord changes. Ike modestly terms what he does on the guitar as &#x27;tricks&#x27;, but make no mistake, he attacked his axe with the conviction of a man who knew precisely what he wanted to hear come out of it.&quot;

Reviewing Turner&#x27;s 1973 album &quot;Bad Dreams&quot;, Robert Christgau wrote: &quot;After twenty years of raking it in from the shadows, he&#x27;s finally figured out a way of applying his basically comic bass/baritone to rock and roll. Studio-psychedelic New Orleans, echoes of the Band and Dr. John, some brilliant minor r&amp;b mixed in with the dumb stuff. My God—at the moment he&#x27;s more interesting than Tina.&quot;

=== Influence ===

Turner was praised by his contemporaries for his influence. Johnny Otis said, &quot;Ike Turner is a very important man in American music. The texture and flavor of R&amp;B owe a lot to him. He defined how to put the Fender bass into that music. He was a great innovator.&quot; B.B. King was a great admirer of Turner, describing him as &quot;The best bandleader I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot; King also said, &quot;When they talk about rock &#x27;n roll, I see Ike as one of the founding fathers.&quot; Turner was a big influence on Little Richard, who wrote the introduction to Turner&#x27;s autobiography. Little Richard was inspired to play the piano after he heard Turner&#x27;s piano intro on &quot;Rocket 88&quot;, and later used it note for note on &quot;Good Golly, Miss Molly&quot;. Prince also said Turner was his first musical influence.

Phil Alexander, editor-in-chief of &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine, referred to Turner as the &quot;cornerstone of modern day rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot; and credited his arrangements of blues standards as being an influence on 1960s British Invasion groups: &quot;He proceeded to influence British rockers from the mid-1960s onwards. Without Ike you wouldn&#x27;t have had the Stones and Zeppelin. People like that wouldn&#x27;t have had the source material on which they drew.&quot;

Speaking on &quot;Rocket 88&quot; being a contender for the first rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll record, broadcaster Paul Gambaccini said:In musical terms [he was] very important. &quot;Rocket 88&quot; is one of the two records that can claim to be the first rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll record, the other being &quot;The Fat Man&quot; by Fats Domino from 1949. But &quot;Rocket 88&quot; does have a couple of elements which &quot;The Fat Man&quot; did not. The wailing saxophone and that distorted electric guitar. It was number one in the rhythm and blues chart for five weeks, it is in the Grammy Hall of Fame and it was an indisputable claim to fame for Ike Turner...To critics he will be known as a great founder, unfortunately to the general public he will always be known as a brutal man.Nigel Cawthorne—co-author of Turner&#x27;s autobiography—said:Although there had been black rock &#x27;n&#x27; rollers who had made it big already, they really only played to a white audience. Ike and Tina played to a mixed audience and he deliberately desegregated audiences in the southern states and he wouldn&#x27;t play to any segregated audiences at all. Because he had such a big band and entourage he desegregated a lot of the hotels because the hotel chains wouldn&#x27;t want to miss out on the money they would make from him touring the southern states.Turner&#x27;s songs have been sampled by hip hop artists; most notably, Salt-N-Pepa used &quot;I&#x27;m Blue&quot; for their 1994 hit &quot;Shoop&quot;. Jurassic 5 used &quot;Getting Nasty&quot; from &quot;A Black Man&#x27;s Soul&quot; on the track &quot;Concrete Schoolyard&quot; in 1997. Main Source also sampled &quot;Getting Nasty&quot; on the track &quot;Snake Eyes&quot; as well as Ike &amp; Tina Turner&#x27;s &quot;Bold Soul Sister&quot; on &quot;Just Hanging Out&quot;; both featured on their 1991 album &quot;Breaking Atoms&quot;. The track &quot;Funky Mule&quot;, also from &quot;A Black Man&#x27;s Soul&quot;, has been sampled extensively by jungle DJs, with the drum introduction being a very popular break. It was sampled by producer Goldie for his 1994 hit &quot;Inner City Life&quot;, in the same year by Krome &amp; Time on &quot;The License&quot;, and by Paradox in 2002 on track &quot;Funky Mule&quot;.

In 2009, a Nashville-based band, Mr. Groove Band, recorded a tribute album titled &quot;Rocket 88: Tribute to Ike Turner&quot;. Vocalists on the album include Turner&#x27;s last wife Audrey Madison Turner and former Ikette Bonnie Bramlett.

=== Accolades ===
Turner won two competitive Grammy Awards. Ike &amp; Tina Turner won Best R&amp;B Vocal Performance by a Group for &quot;Proud Mary&quot; in 1972. In 2007, Turner won Best Traditional Blues Album for &quot;Risin&#x27; with the Blues&quot;. Turner also has three songs inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame: &quot;Rocket 88&quot;, &quot;River Deep – Mountain High&quot;, and &quot;Proud Mary&quot;.

Ike &amp; Tina Turner were inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in 1991. Turner is inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame and the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame. He is also inducted into the Mississippi Musicians Hall of Fame. He was honored with a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame in 2001.

In 2003, the album &quot;Proud Mary: The Best of Ike &amp; Tina Turner&quot; was ranked No. 212 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time (No. 214 on 2012 revised list).

In 2004, Fender Custom Shop manufactured a limited edition Ike Turner Tribute Stratocaster. The model has an alder body in Sonic Blue with an Ike Turner signature in gold ink on the body under the clear-coat, with a maple neck in a 1960s &quot;C&quot; shape with a rosewood fingerboard, with 21 vintage frets. It had three custom single coil 1960s Strat pickups. Only 100 specimens were made, retailing at $3,399.99.

In August 2010, Turner was posthumously celebrated in his hometown of Clarksdale, Mississippi. On August 6, Clarksdale officials and music fans gathered to unveil a marker on the Mississippi Blues Trail and a plaque on the Clarksdale Walk of Fame in downtown Clarksdale honoring Turner and his musical legacy. The unveilings coincided with Clarksdale&#x27;s 23rd Annual Sunflower River Blues &amp; Gospel Festival, which paid tribute to Turner.

Although Turner considered himself a pianist rather than a guitarist, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine editor David Fricke ranked him No. 61 on his list of 100 Greatest Guitarists in 2010.

In 2015, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Ike &amp; Tina Turner No. 2 on their list of the 20 Greatest Duos of All Time.

In 2017, the Mississippi Blues Trail honored &quot;Rocket 88&quot; for being an influential record with a marker in Lyon, Mississippi. In 2018, &quot;Rocket 88&quot; was chosen for the inaugural class of influential songs inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Singles.

=== Portrayal in popular culture ===
In 1986, Tina Turner released her autobiography, &quot;I, Tina&quot;, in which she recounted Turner&#x27;s volatile behavior. He received negative publicity that was exacerbated in 1993 by the release of the film adaptation &quot;What&#x27;s Love Got to Do with It&quot;. Turner received $45,000 for the film, but he had unknowingly signed papers waiving the right to sue Disney&#x27;s Touchstone Pictures for his depiction. He was portrayed by Laurence Fishburne, whose performance earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Actor at the 66th Academy Awards.

After the release of the film, the fictionalized version of Turner from the movie was seized on by comedians, who reused the persona in sketches. On the 1990s sketch comedy show &quot;In Living Color&quot;, Turner was parodied by David Alan Grier. He was portrayed on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;″s Weekend Update by Tim Meadows in a pageboy wig. On the &quot;John Boy and Billy&quot; radio show, cast member Jeff Pillars regularly performed an impersonation of Turner in a segment called &quot;Ax/Ask Ike&quot;. These sketches were collected in a 2008 comedy album &quot;Ike at the Mike&quot;. In 2006, &quot;Vibe&quot; magazine ranked the character of Ike Turner from &quot;What&#x27;s Love Got to Do with It&quot; at No. 4 in their list of the 20 best movie &quot;bad guys&quot;.

Commenting on the historical accuracy of the film, Tina told Larry King in 1997: &quot;I would have liked them to have more truth, but according to Disney [owner of the film&#x27;s production company], they said it&#x27;s impossible, the people would not have believed the truth.&quot; In 2018, Tina told Oprah Winfrey that she only recently watched the film, but she could not finish it because she &quot;didn&#x27;t realize they would change the details so much.&quot; Phil Spector criticized Tina&#x27;s book and called the film a &quot;piece of trash&quot; during his eulogy at Turner&#x27;s funeral.

In 2015, TV One&#x27;s &quot;Unsung&quot; offered some redemption with &quot;The Story of Ike Turner&quot;, which documented his career along with his trials and tribulations. In the musical &quot;Tina: The Tina Turner Musical&quot;, Turner was portrayed by British actor Kobna Holdbrook-Smith, who won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Musical for his role in 2019.

=== Books ===
In 1999, Turner published his autobiography &quot;Takin&#x27; Back My Name: The Confessions of Ike Turner&quot;. It was written with Nigel Cawthorne and Little Richard wrote the introduction. In 2003, John Collis published &quot;Ike Turner: King of Rhythm&quot; about the life and musical contributions of Turner.

== Personal life ==
=== Marriages ===
Turner was married fourteen times. He often married another woman before divorcing his existing wife. Speaking on his early marriages, he said: &quot;You gave a preacher two dollars, the (marriage) papers cost three dollars, that was it. In those days, African Americans did not bother with divorces.&quot;

==== Early marriages ====
Turner was first married at 16 years old to Edna Dean Stewart of Ruleville, Mississippi. They were married on April 10, 1948. Records show that Turner added four years to his age. Edna didn&#x27;t want to stay in Clarksdale, so she left Turner and returned to Ruleville.

Turner&#x27;s second wife, Velma Davis (née Dishman) is the elder sister of former Ikette Joshie Armstead. Turner met her at the Cotton Club on Camplin Avenue in Yazoo City, Mississippi in 1948. Davis claimed that Turner was the father of her daughter Linda Turner Bullock, born in 1949. However, Turner asserted in his book that he is not the biological father. The couple married on September 19, 1950. Davis and Bullock attended Turner&#x27;s Mississippi Blues Trail marker unveiling in 2010.

Turner then married Rosa Lee Sane in West Memphis, Arkansas. She had a mental breakdown so her family put her in an insane asylum in Tennessee. Turner tried to get her out, but he never saw her again.

Turner married Marion Louis Lee (Bonnie Turner) in Clarksdale on September 24, 1952. Lee was a member of the Kings of Rhythm as a pianist and vocalist. In 1952, under the alias Mary Sue, she released the single &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Talking&quot; / &quot;Love Is a Gamble&quot; on Modern Records. She co-wrote both tunes with Turner. The couple also recorded for RPM Records and Sun Records. Turner recalled, &quot;Bonnie played piano. It was a job staying ahead of this chick, man, cos&#x27; she was always trying to outdo me.&quot; While they were in Sarasota, Florida for a gig, she ran off to New York with another man in 1953. Their divorce was finalized in 1955.

After Lee, Turner married a woman named Alice in Helena, Arkansas. According to Turner, they did not consummate their marriage. Alice was dating his vocalist Johnny O&#x27;Neal, but Turner liked her so he married her to avoid &quot;locking heads&quot; with O&#x27;Neal. &quot;If I married her, he couldn&#x27;t do nothing,&quot; he said.

After Alice, Turner married Annie Mae Wilson from Greenville, Mississippi. She played piano and was the secretary for his band. Wilson left Turner for a policeman in East St. Louis, Illinois. In 1958, Turner presented a petition to the East St. Louis Board of Police Commissioners, stating that police officer Curtis Smith had harassed him and burst his eardrum out of spite because of his relationship with Wilson.

In East St. Louis, Turner lived with Lorraine Taylor. Her parents owned the Taylor Sausage Factory in St. Louis. Sources often incorrectly refer to Taylor as one of Turner&#x27;s wives, but she was his live-in girlfriend. Lorraine already had two children of her own before she had two sons, Ike Jr. and Michael, with Turner.

==== Tina Turner ====

In 1956, Turner met Ann Bullock (whom he later renamed Tina Turner) at the Club Manhattan in East St. Louis. They became close friends and she began dating his saxophonist Raymond Hill. When Bullock became pregnant by Hill, they lived with Turner and his live-in girlfriend Lorraine Taylor. Hill injured his ankle and left Bullock before their son Craig was born in August 1958. During Bullock&#x27;s pregnancy, Taylor became suspicious that Bullock was pregnant by Turner and threatened her with a gun before shooting herself; her injuries were nonfatal. However, Turner and Bullock eventually began having an affair and she became pregnant in January 1960.

Following the birth of their son Ronnie in October 1960, they were married in Tijuana in 1962. Turner stated that the reason they went to Tijuana was to see &quot;sex shows and whores&quot;. At the time, he was still legally married to Alice Bell. He used a detective agency to locate Bell in Chicago and they divorced in 1974. On multiple occasions, Turner said that he was never officially married to Tina. He also revealed on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; in 1993 and on &quot;Fresh Air&quot; in 1996 that Tina&#x27;s birth name was Martha Nell (not Anna Mae) Bullock. Tina signed her legal name as Martha Nell Turner on multiple contracts.

Following a violent altercation in July 1976, Tina filed for divorce on the grounds of irreconcilable differences. Although Turner reiterated that they were never officially married, they had a common-law marriage and still had to go through a formal divorce. Their divorce was finalized on March 29, 1978. In the final divorce decree, Tina took responsibility for missed concert dates as well as an IRS lien. Tina retained songwriter royalties from songs she had written, but Turner got the publishing royalties for his compositions and hers. She also kept her two Jaguar cars, furs and jewelry along with her stage name. Tina gave up her share of their Bolic Sound recording studio, publishing companies, and real estate.

In her 1986 autobiography, Tina revealed that Turner had been abusive during their marriage. She said: &quot;It was my relationship with Ike that made me most unhappy. At first, I had really been in love with him. Look what he&#x27;d done for me. But he was totally unpredictable.&quot; Turner admitted he took Tina for granted and called her &quot;the best woman I ever knew&quot;. In his autobiography, he said: &quot;Sure, I&#x27;ve slapped Tina. We had fights and there have been times when I punched her to the ground without thinking. But I never beat her.&quot; In a 1999 interview, Roseanne Barr urged him to publicly apologize to Tina on &quot;The Roseanne Barr Show&quot;. In 2007, Turner told &quot;Jet&quot; that he had written Tina an apology letter, but had never sent it. In 2018, Tina told &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; that &quot;as an old person, I have forgiven him, but I would not work with him. He asked for one more tour with me, and I said, &#x27;No, absolutely not.&#x27; Ike wasn&#x27;t someone you could forgive and allow him back in.&quot;

==== Later marriages ====
Turner married Margaret Ann Thomas in Las Vegas on April 11, 1981; they divorced in 1990. They had met in the mid-1960s at a concert in Bakersfield, California. According to Turner, Tina suggested Ann fill in as an Ikette however, she could not sing, she was attractive. Eventually, she moved into their View Park home. Turner stated, &quot;I loved Tina, but I was in love with Ann Thomas.&quot; Their daughter Mia was born in January 1969. They rekindled their friendship years after their divorce, and she found Turner unconscious at his home the day he died.

Turner was introduced to St. Louis native singer Jeanette Bazzell by his son Ike Turner Jr. in 1988. She became his lead vocalist and they married in a private ceremony at Circus Circus Hotel &amp; Resort in Las Vegas on July 4, 1995. They divorced in 2000, but later rekindled their friendship. According to Jeanette, Turner called her his &quot;backbone&quot;. In 2019, she told &quot;Palm Spring Life&quot; that the film &quot;What&#x27;s Love Got to Do with It&quot; &quot;assassinated Ike&#x27;s career. But more than that, it broke his heart&quot;. She added, &quot;Ike doesn&#x27;t get any recognition because of all the negative things [shown] in that movie and in his relationship with Tina... I went through things with Ike, too, but there&#x27;s a time to forgive and to let go. To strip him from having the opportunity to get recognition in an area where he was entitled to deserve it, it&#x27;s so wrong to me.&quot;

Turner met San Francisco native singer Audrey Madison through a mutual friend in 1993. She started as an Ikette before becoming his lead singer. They married at A Special Memory Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas on October 8, 2006. Turner filed for divorce two months later on December 22, but after the divorce was granted, they reconciled in 2007. In 2011, Audrey appeared as a contestant on &quot;The X Factor&quot;. In 2016, she released her memoir &quot;Love Had Everything to Do with It&quot;, which details her volatile relationship with Turner due to his bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. She told &quot;The Afro&quot;: &quot;I decided to write it because it was like a cleansing and it released all of the trauma. Also, I wanted the general public to have a better outlook and perspective on where Ike was mentally and emotionally, because so often, as a nation, we turn on people who have mental health issues and define them by their behaviors rather than their condition.&quot;

=== Children ===
Turner had six children. He had two sons, Ike Turner Jr. (b. 1958) and Michael Turner (b. 1960), with Lorraine Taylor. He had a son Ronald &quot;Ronnie&quot; Turner (1960–2022) with Tina Turner. Tina&#x27;s son Craig Turner (1958–2018) with Raymond Hill was adopted by Turner and therefore carried his surname. Craig died in an apparent suicide.

Turner had a daughter, Mia Turner (b. 1969), with Ann Thomas, and he later discovered he had another daughter, Twanna Melby Turner (b. 1959), with Pat Richard.

Turner&#x27;s second wife Velma Davis (née Dishman) claimed that Turner was the father of her daughter, Linda Turner Bullock (b. 1949), but Turner denied that assertion in his autobiography (in which Velma is mistakenly referred to as Thelma): &quot;I met Thelma Dishman, who, at that time, I thought was a pretty girl. Thelma was pregnant, not by me, but I liked her.&quot;

In 1988, Turner discovered he had a daughter named Twanna Melby. He was paroled into her custody in 1991. Her mother, Pat Richard, attended Sumner High School with Tina in St. Louis.

Ike Turner Jr. released an album, &quot;Hard Labor&quot;, in 1987. He won a Grammy Award for his involvement with Turner&#x27;s 2006 album &quot;Risin&#x27; with the Blues&quot;. He toured with former Ikette Randi Love as Sweet Randi Love and The Love Thang Band.

Ronnie Turner was in a band called Manufactured Funk with songwriter and musician Patrick Moten. He played bass guitar in his mother&#x27;s band after his parents divorced and he later played in his father&#x27;s band. He married French singer Afida Turner in 2007. After his father&#x27;s death, he told &quot;Jet&quot; magazine: &quot;I loved my father very much... You can talk 5 or 10 minutes about the bad he&#x27;s done. You can talk all night about the achievements he&#x27;s had. He was successful with my mom and after my mom. He won a Grammy before he died. That&#x27;s a lifetime achievement.&quot; Ronnie died from complications of colon cancer in 2022.

=== Legal problems and drug addiction ===
In 1960, Turner and two others were charged for &quot;interstate transportation of forged checks and conspiracy.&quot; Turner plead not guilty and was forced to stand trial in St. Louis. The jury failed to reach a verdict at the first trial, but he was found not guilty at the retrial in 1961.

In 1974, Turner and three others were arrested for using illegal blue boxes at Bolic Sound studio to make long-distance phone calls. He was cleared of the charges.

Before the age of thirty, Turner did not use drugs or drink alcohol. He would fire anyone in his band who used any substances. Turner was first introduced to cocaine by &quot;two very famous people&quot; he had been working with at the International Hotel in Las Vegas. Producer D&#x27;Angela Proctor alleged in Turner&#x27;s &quot;Unsung&quot; documentary that the two famous people were Elvis Presley and Redd Foxx. He took the cocaine home and tried it one night while writing songs at the piano. Turner said he liked the reduced need for sleep the drug gave him, which allowed him to write more music. By the early 1970s, he was heavily addicted to the drug, buying it in large quantities and sharing it with friends. Turner later estimated that he had spent $11 million on cocaine. His addiction caused a hole through his nasal septum, the pain of which he relieved by using more cocaine. He eventually began freebasing crack cocaine.

By the 1980s, Turner&#x27;s finances were in disarray and he owed the state of California $12,802 in back taxes. He later settled his account. He had tried to sell his studio Bolic Sound to raise funds to avoid foreclosure, but the studio burned down on the day a potential buyer was scheduled to view it in January 1981.

During the 1980s, Turner was arrested multiple times for drug and firearm offenses, which resulted in two convictions.

* In 1980, a SWAT team raided his Bolic Sound studio, finding a live hand grenade and seven grams of cocaine. Turner received his first conviction for cocaine possession. He was sentenced to thirty days in the L.A. county jail with three years probation.
* In April 1981, Turner was arrested for shooting a 49-year-old newspaper delivery man. He accused the man of assaulting his wife Ann Thomas and of kicking his dog. Turner said he only fired a shot to scare him off and that the man had injured himself when he climbed over the fence to get away. A jury acquitted Turner of assault in 1982.
* In June 1985, Turner was arrested and charged with conspiracy to sell $16,000 worth of cocaine, possession and maintaining a residence for selling or using a controlled substance. The police took $1,000 worth of rock cocaine from his North Hollywood apartment. Record producer Eddie Coleman Jr. and music company writer Richard Lee Griffin were also arrested and charged. Turner was released on a $5,000 bond.
* In 1986, Turner was arrested for cocaine possession, concealed carry of a handgun and traffic violations; he was released on bail.
* In January 1987, Turner was arrested for trying to sell 10 ounces of cocaine to an undercover police officer; he pleaded not guilty.
* In May 1989, Turner was arrested on drug charges in West Hollywood. He was convicted of cocaine intoxication and driving under the influence of cocaine in January 1990. The next month he was sentenced to four years in prison. He was released on parole in September 1991 after completing 18 months of his sentence at California Men&#x27;s Colony in San Luis Obispo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jet-9/23/91&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Larry Kamien, associate warden of the California Men&#x27;s Colony, said Turner was a model inmate. In prison he became a trustee working in the library and saved $13,000 by selling cigarettes, candy bars, and coffee to other inmates.

Turner managed to break his dependency on cocaine while in prison and remained clean for more than ten years. He visited high schools during Black History Month to speak against drug use. While trying to help an acquaintance from crack addiction at a crack house he relapsed in 2004.

=== Health problems ===
In 2005, Turner revealed he had been diagnosed with emphysema, which required him to use an oxygen tank. His daughter Mia Turner said, &quot;He was too weak from the emphysema to do anything. He&#x27;d go in the studio for a couple of minutes and play a couple of bars and say he had to go lay down.&quot; Despite his ill health, he collaborated with Gorillaz on their album &quot;Demon Days&quot; and performed the track with them at the Manchester Opera House in November 2005.

After his death in 2007, Turner&#x27;s autopsy and toxicology report showed he was taking Seroquel at the time of his death. The medicine is most commonly used as treatment for bipolar disorder, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and schizophrenia. His ex-wife Audrey Madison claimed Turner was bipolar and that she was helping him with his illness, a claim supported by Turner&#x27;s personal assistant and caretaker, Falina Rasool. Rasool said she talked to Turner about his bipolar disorder and witnessed its effects. &quot;I would come in the room and see him change like a lightbulb, switch on and switch off. I did ask him about it. He said he made a song about it and we started laughing,&quot; said Rasool, referring to &quot;Bi Polar&quot; from the Grammy-winning album &quot;Risin&#x27; with the Blues&quot;. &quot;I know I&#x27;m bipolar...And I&#x27;ve been bipolar, but a lot of people is bipolar,&quot; he told her. However, Turner&#x27;s daughter, Mia Turner, disagreed with this diagnosis and felt he was being overmedicated.

=== Religious affiliation ===
Turner was raised a Baptist and reportedly converted to Judaism in 1994, but never spoke about it.

== Death ==
In the weeks leading up to his death, Turner became reclusive. On December 10, 2007, he told his assistant, Falina Rasool, that he believed he was dying and would not make it to Christmas. He died two days later, on December 12, at the age of 76, at his home in San Marcos, California. He was found dead by his former wife, Ann Thomas. Rasool was also in the house and administered CPR. Turner was pronounced dead at 11:38 a.m.

His funeral was held on December 21, 2007, at the City of Refuge Church in Gardena, California. Among those who spoke at the funeral were Little Richard, Solomon Burke and Phil Spector. The Kings of Rhythm played &quot;Rocket 88&quot; and &quot;Proud Mary&quot;. Turner was cremated after the funeral service.

On January 16, 2008, the San Diego County Medical Examiner&#x27;s Office reported that Turner had died from a cocaine overdose. &quot;The cause of death for Ike Turner is cocaine toxicity with other significant conditions, such as hypertensive cardiovascular disease and pulmonary emphysema&quot;, Supervising Medical Examiner Investigator Paul Parker told CNN. His daughter Mia was said to be surprised at the coroner&#x27;s assessment, believing his advanced stage emphysema was a larger factor.

Turner died without a valid will. Less than a week after his death, his former wife Audrey Madison Turner filed a petition stating that he had penned a handwritten will naming her as a beneficiary. In 2009, a judge ruled that the handwritten will was invalid and that Turner&#x27;s children were legally the direct heirs to his estate.

<doc id="50505" wikidata="Q41692" url="?curid=50505" title="Mule">
<text>The mule is a domestic equine hybrid between a donkey and a horse. It is the offspring of a male donkey (a jack) and a female horse (a mare). The horse and the donkey are different species, with different numbers of chromosomes; of the two possible first-generation hybrids between them, the mule is easier to obtain and more common than the hinny, which is the offspring of a male horse (a stallion) and a female donkey (a jenny).

Mules vary widely in size, and may be of any color seen in horses or donkeys. They are more patient, hardier and longer-lived than horses, and are perceived as less obstinate and more intelligent than donkeys.

== Terminology ==

A female mule that has oestrus cycles, and so could, in theory, carry a fetus, is called a &quot;molly&quot; or &quot;Molly mule&quot;, although the term is sometimes used to refer to female mules in general. A male mule is properly called a &quot;horse mule&quot;, although it is often called a &quot;john mule&quot;, which is the correct term for a gelded mule. A young male mule is called a &quot;mule colt&quot;, and a young female is called a &quot;mule filly&quot;.

== History ==

Breeding of mules became possible only when the range of the domestic horse, which originated in Central Asia in about , extended into that of the domestic ass, which originated in north-eastern Africa. This overlap probably occurred in Anatolia and Mesopotamia in Western Asia, and mules were bred there before .

A painting in the Tomb of Nebamun at Thebes, dating from approximately , shows a chariot drawn by a pair of animals which have been variously identified as onagers, as mules or as hinnies. Mules were present in Israel and Judah in the time of King David. There are many representations of them in Mesopotamian works of art dating from the first millennium BC. Among the bas-reliefs depicting the Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal from the North Palace of Nineveh is a clear and detailed image of two mules loaded with nets for hunting.

Homer noted their arrival in Asia Minor in the &quot;Iliad&quot; in 800 BC.

Christopher Columbus allegedly brought mules to the New World.

George Washington bred mules at his Mount Vernon home. At the time, they were not common in the United States, but Washington understood their value, as they were &quot;more docile than donkeys and cheap to maintain.&quot; In the nineteenth century, they were used in various capacities as draught animals – on farms, especially where clay made the soil slippery and sticky; pulling canal boats; and famously for pulling, often in teams of 20 or more animals, wagonloads of borax out of Death Valley, California from 1883 to 1889. The wagons were among the largest ever pulled by draught animals, designed to carry 10 short tons (9 metric tons) of borax ore at a time.

Mules were used by armies to transport supplies, occasionally as mobile firing platforms for smaller cannons, and to pull heavier field guns with wheels over mountainous trails such as in Afghanistan during the Second Anglo-Afghan War.

In the second half of the twentieth century, widespread use of mules declined in industrialised countries. The use of mules for farming and for transportation of agricultural products largely gave way to steam-, then diesel-powered, tractors and lorries.

On 5 May 2003, Idaho Gem, a mule foal cloned by nuclear transfer of cells from foetal material, was born at the University of Idaho in Moscow, Idaho. Neither an equid nor a hybrid animal had been cloned before.

== Characteristics ==

In general terms, in both the mule and the hinny, the foreparts and head of the animal are similar to those of the father sire, while the hindparts and tail tend to resemble those of the dam. A mule is generally larger than a hinny, with longer ears and a heavier head; the tail is usually covered with long hair like that of its mare mother. A mule has the thin limbs, small narrow hooves and short mane of the donkey, while its height, the shape of the neck and body, and the uniformity of its coat and teeth are more similar to those of the horse.

Mules vary widely in size, from small miniature mules under to large and powerful draught mules standing up to at the withers. The median weight range is between about .

The coat may be of any color seen in the horse or in the donkey. Mules usually display the light points commonly seen in donkeys: pale or mealy areas on the belly and the insides of the thighs, on the muzzle, and around the eyes. They often have primitive markings such as dorsal stripe, shoulder stripe or zebra stripes on the legs.

The mule exhibits hybrid vigor. Charles Darwin wrote: &quot;The mule always appears to me a most surprising animal. That a hybrid should possess more reason, memory, obstinacy, social affection, powers of muscular endurance, and length of life, than either of its parents, seems to indicate that art has here outdone nature&quot;.

The mule inherits from the donkey the traits of intelligence, sure-footedness, toughness, endurance, disposition, and natural cautiousness. From the horse it inherits speed, conformation, and agility. Mules are reputed to exhibit a higher cognitive intelligence than their parent species, but robust scientific evidence to back up these claims is lacking. Preliminary data exist from at least two evidence-based studies, but they rely on a limited set of specialized cognitive tests and a small number of subjects. Mules are generally taller at the shoulder than donkeys and have better endurance than horses, although a lower top speed.

In the early twentieth century the mule was preferred to the horse as a pack animal – its skin is harder and less sensitive than that of a horse, and it is better able to bear heavy weights.

=== Fertility ===
A mule has 63 chromosomes, intermediate between the 64 of the horse and the 62 of the donkey. Mules are usually infertile for this reason.

Pregnancy is rare, but can occasionally occur naturally, as well as through embryo transfer. A few mare mules have produced offspring when mated with a horse or a jack. Herodotus gives an account of such an event as an ill omen of Xerxes&#x27; invasion of Greece in 480 BC: &quot;There happened also a portent of another kind while he was still at Sardis—a mule brought forth young and gave birth to a mule&quot; (Herodotus &quot;The Histories&quot; 7:57), and a mule&#x27;s giving birth was a frequently recorded portent in antiquity, although scientific writers also doubted whether it was really possible (see e.g. Aristotle, &quot;Historia animalium&quot;, 6.24; Varro, &quot;De re rustica&quot;, 2.1.28). Between 1527 and 2002, approximately sixty such births were reported. In Morocco in early 2002 and Colorado in 2007, mare mules produced colts. Blood and hair samples from the Colorado birth verified that the mother was indeed a mule and the foal was indeed her offspring.

A 1939 article in the &quot;Journal of Heredity&quot; describes two offspring of a fertile mare mule named &quot;Old Bec,&quot; which was owned at the time by Texas A&amp;M University in the late 1920s. One of the foals was a female, sired by a jack. Unlike her mother, she was sterile. The other, sired by a five-gaited Saddlebred stallion, exhibited no characteristics of any donkey. That horse, a stallion, was bred to several mares, which gave birth to live foals that showed no characteristics of the donkey. In 1995, a group from the Federal University of Minas Gerais described a female mule that was pregnant for a seventh time, having previously produced two donkey sires, two foals with the typical 63 chromosomes of mules, and several horse stallions that had produced four foals. The three of the latter available for testing each bore 64 horse-like chromosomes. These foals phenotypically resembled horses, though they bore markings absent from the sire&#x27;s known lineages, and one had ears noticeably longer than those typical of her sire&#x27;s breed. The elder two horse-like foals had proved fertile at the time of publication, with their progeny being typical of horses.

== Use ==
While a few mules can carry live weight up to , the superiority of the mule becomes apparent in their additional endurance. In general, a mule can be packed with dead weight up to 20% of its body weight, or around . Although it depends on the individual animal, mules trained by the Army of Pakistan are reported to be able to carry up to and walk without resting. The average equine in general can carry up to roughly 30% of its body weight in live weight, such as a rider.

About 3.5 million donkeys and mules are slaughtered each year for meat worldwide.

Mule trains have been part of working portions of transportation links as recently as 2005 by the World Food Programme, and are still used extensively to transport cargo in rugged, roadless regions.

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations reports that China was the top market for mules in 2003, closely followed by Mexico and many Central and South American nations.

<doc id="50510" wikidata="Q828224" url="?curid=50510" title="Kilometre">
<text>The kilometre (SI symbol: km; or ), spelt kilometer in American and Philippine English, is a unit of length in the International System of Units (SI), equal to one thousand metres (kilo- being the SI prefix for ). It is the preferred measurement unit to express distances between geographical places on land in most of the world; notable exceptions are the United States and the United Kingdom where the statute mile is used.

== Pronunciation==

There are two common pronunciations for the word.
# 

The first pronunciation follows a pattern in English whereby SI units are pronounced with the stress on the first syllable (as in kilogram, kilojoule and kilohertz) and the pronunciation of the actual base unit does not change irrespective of the prefix (as in centimetre, millimetre, nanometre and so on). It is generally preferred by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).

Many other users, particularly in countries where SI (the metric system) is not widely used, use the second pronunciation with stress on the second syllable. The second pronunciation follows the stress pattern used for the names of measuring instruments (such as &quot;micrometer&quot;, &quot;barometer&quot;, &quot;thermometer&quot;, &quot;tachometer,&quot; and &quot;speedometer&quot;). The contrast is even more obvious in countries that use the American spelling of the word &quot;metre&quot;. This pronunciation is irregular because it makes the kilometre the only SI unit with the stress on the second syllable.

After Australia introduced the metric system in 1970, the first pronunciation was declared official by the government&#x27;s Metric Conversion Board. However, the Australian prime minister at the time, Gough Whitlam, insisted that the second pronunciation was the correct one because of the Greek origins of the two parts of the word.

== Equivalence to other units of length ==

== History ==
By a decree of 8 May 1790, the French National Constituent Assembly ordered the French Academy of Sciences to develop a new measurement system. In August 1793, the French National Convention decreed the metre as the sole length measurement system in the French Republic and it was based on millionth of the distance from the orbital poles (either North or South) to the Equator, this being a truly internationally based unit. The first name of the kilometre was &quot;Millaire&quot;.
Although the metre was formally defined in 1799, the myriametre ( metres) was preferred to the &quot;kilometre&quot; for everyday use. The term &quot;&quot;myriamètre&quot; appeared a number of times in the text of Develey&#x27;s book &quot;Physique d&#x27;Emile: ou, Principes de la science de la nature&quot;, (published in 1802), while the term &quot;kilometre&quot; only appeared in an appendix. French maps published in 1835 had scales showing &quot;myriametres&quot; and &quot;lieues de Poste&quot; (Postal leagues of about  metres).

The Dutch, on the other hand, adopted the kilometre in 1817 but gave it the local name of the &quot;mijl&quot;. It was only in 1867 that the term &quot;&quot;kilometer&quot; became the only official unit of measure in the Netherlands to represent  metres.

Two German textbooks dated 1842 and 1848 respectively give a snapshot of the use of the kilometre across Europe: the kilometre was in use in the Netherlands and in Italy, and the myriametre was in use in France.

In 1935, the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) officially abolished the prefix &quot;myria-&quot; and with it the &quot;myriametre&quot;, leaving the kilometre as the recognised unit of length for measurements of that magnitude.

The symbol km for the kilometre is in lower case and has been standardised by the BIPM. A slang term for the kilometre in the US, UK, and Canadian militaries is &quot;&quot;.

== Kilometre records ==
Some sporting disciplines feature (one-kilometre) races in major events (such as the Olympic Games). In some disciplines—although world records are catalogued—one-kilometre events remain a minority.

<doc id="50513" wikidata="Q187526" url="?curid=50513" title="Melanin">
<text>Melanin (; ) is a family of biomolecules organized as oligomers or polymers, which among other functions provide the pigments of many organisms. Melanin pigments are produced in a specialized group of cells known as melanocytes.

There are five basic types of melanin: eumelanin, pheomelanin, neuromelanin, allomelanin and pyomelanin. Melanin is produced through a multistage chemical process known as melanogenesis, where the oxidation of the amino acid tyrosine is followed by polymerization. Pheomelanin is a cysteinated form containing polybenzothiazine portions that are largely responsible for the red or yellow tint given to some skin or hair colors. Neuromelanin is found in the brain. Research has been undertaken to investigate its efficacy in treating neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson&#x27;s. Allomelanin and pyomelanin are two types of nitrogen-free melanin.

The phenotypic color variation observed in the epidermis and hair of mammals is primarily determined by the levels of eumelanin and pheomelanin in the examined tissue. In an average human individual, eumelanin is more abundant in tissues requiring photoprotection, such as the epidermis and the retinal pigment epithelium. In healthy subjects, epidermal melanin is correlated with UV exposure, while retinal melanin has been found to correlate with age, with levels diminishing 2.5-fold between the first and ninth decades of life, which has been attributed to oxidative degradation mediated by reactive oxygen species generated via lipofuscin-dependent pathways. In the absence of albinism or hyperpigmentation, the human epidermis contains approximately 74% eumelanin and 26% pheomelanin, largely irrespective of skin tone, with eumelanin content ranging between 71.8–78.9%, and pheomelanin varying between 21.1–28.2%. Total melanin content in the epidermis ranges from around 0 μg/mg in albino epidermal tissue to &gt;10 μg/mg in darker tissue.

In the human skin, melanogenesis is initiated by exposure to UV radiation, causing the skin to darken. Eumelanin is an effective absorbent of light; the pigment is able to dissipate over 99.9% of absorbed UV radiation. Because of this property, eumelanin is thought to protect skin cells from UVA and UVB radiation damage, reducing the risk of folate depletion and dermal degradation. Exposure to UV radiation is associated with increased risk of malignant melanoma, a cancer of melanocytes (melanin cells). Studies have shown a lower incidence for skin cancer in individuals with more concentrated melanin, i.e. darker skin tone.

== Melanin types ==

=== Eumelanin ===

Eumelanin () has two forms linked to 5,6-dihydroxyindole (DHI) and 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid (DHICA). DHI-derived eumelanin is dark brown or black and insoluble, and DHICA -derived eumelanin which is lighter and soluble in alkali. Both eumelanins arise from the oxidation of tyrosine in specialized organelles called melanosomes. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme tyrosinase. The initial product, dopaquinone can transform into either 5,6-dihydroxyindole (DHI) or 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid (DHICA). DHI and DHICA are oxidized and then polymerize to form the two eumelanins. 

In natural conditions, DHI and DHICA often co-polymerize, resulting in a range of eumelanin polymers. These polymers contribute to the variety of melanin components in human skin and hair, ranging from light yellow/red pheomelanin to light brown DHICA-enriched eumelanin and dark brown or black DHI-enriched eumelanin. These final polymers differ in solubility and color. 

Analysis of highly pigmented (Fitzpatrick type V and VI) skin finds that DHI-eumelanin comprises the largest portion, approximately 60–70%, followed by DHICA-eumelanin at 25–35%, and pheomelanin only 2–8%. Notably, while an enrichment of DHI-eumelanin occurs in during sun tanning, it is accompanied by a decrease in DHICA-eumelanin and pheomelanin. A small amount of black eumelanin in the absence of other pigments causes grey hair. A small amount of eumelanin in the absence of other pigments causes blond hair. Eumelanin is present in the skin and hair, etc.

=== Pheomelanin ===

Pheomelanins (or phaeomelanins, from Greek φαιός &quot;phaios&quot;, &quot;grey&quot;) impart a range of yellowish to reddish colors. Pheomelanins are particularly concentrated in the lips, nipples, glans of the penis, and vagina. When a small amount of eumelanin in hair (which would otherwise cause blond hair) is mixed with pheomelanin, the result is orange hair, which is typically called &quot;red&quot; or &quot;ginger&quot; hair. Pheomelanin is also present in the skin, and redheads consequently often have a more pinkish hue to their skin as well. Exposure of the skin to ultraviolet light increases pheomelanin content, as it does for eumelanin; but rather than absorbing light, pheomelanin within the hair and skin reflect yellow to red light, which may increase damage from UV radiation exposure.

Pheomelanin production is highly dependent on cysteine availability, which is transported into the melanosome, reacting with dopaquinone to form cys-dopa. Cys-dopa then undergoes several transformations before forming pheomelanin. In chemical terms, pheomelanins differ from eumelanins in that the oligomer structure incorporates benzothiazine and benzothiazole units that are produced, instead of DHI and DHICA, when the amino acid L-cysteine is present.

Pheomelanins, unlike euemanins, are rare in lower organisms with claims they are an &quot;evolutionary innovation in the tetrapod lineage&quot; but recent research finds them also in some fish.

=== Neuromelanin ===
Neuromelanin (NM) is an insoluble polymer pigment produced in specific populations of catecholaminergic neurons in the brain. Humans have the largest amount of NM, which is present in lesser amounts in other primates, and totally absent in many other species. The biological function remains unknown, although human NM has been shown to efficiently bind transition metals such as iron, as well as other potentially toxic molecules. Therefore, it may play crucial roles in apoptosis and the related Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

=== Other forms of melanins ===
Up until the 1960s, melanin was classified into eumelanin and pheomelanin. However, in 1955, a melanin associated with nerve cells was discovered, neuromelanin. In 1972 a water-soluble form, pyomelanin was discovered. In 1976, allomelanin, the fifth form of the melanins was found in nature.

==== Peptidomelanin ====

Peptidomelanin is another water-soluble form of melanin. It was found to be secreted into the surrounding medium by germinating &quot;Aspergillus niger&quot; (strain: melanoliber) spores. Peptidomelanin is formed as a copolymer between L-DOPA eumelanin and short peptides that form a &#x27;corona&#x27;, that are responsible for the substance&#x27;s solubility. The peptide chains are linked to the L-DOPA core polymer via peptide bonds. This lead to a proposed biosynthetic process involving the hydroxylation of tyrosinylated peptides formed via proteases during sporogenesis, which are then incorporated autoxidatively into a growing L-DOPA core polymer.

==== Selenomelanin ====
It is possible to enrich melanin with selenium instead of sulphur. This selenium analogue of pheomelanin has been successfully synthesized through chemical and biosynthetic routes using selenocystine as a feedstock. Due to selenium&#x27;s higher atomic number, the obtained selenomelanin can be expected to provide better protection against ionising radiation as compared to the other known forms of melanin. This protection has been demonstrated with radiation experiments on human cells and bacteria, opening up the possibility of applications in space travel.

==== Trichochromes ====
Trichochromes (formerly called trichosiderins) are pigments produced from the same metabolic pathway as the eumelanins and pheomelanins, but unlike those molecules they have low molecular weight. They occur in some red human hair.

== Humans ==

In humans, melanin is the primary determinant of skin color. It is also found in hair, the pigmented tissue underlying the iris of the eye, and the stria vascularis of the inner ear. In the brain, tissues with melanin include the medulla and pigment-bearing neurons within areas of the brainstem, such as the locus coeruleus. It also occurs in the zona reticularis of the adrenal gland.

The melanin in the skin is produced by melanocytes, which are found in the basal layer of the epidermis. Although, in general, human beings possess a similar concentration of melanocytes in their skin, the melanocytes in some individuals and ethnic groups produce variable amounts of melanin. The ratio of eumelanin (74%) and pheomelanin (26%) in the epidermis is constant regardless of the degree of pigmentation. Some humans have very little or no melanin synthesis in their bodies, a condition known as albinism.

Because melanin is an aggregate of smaller component molecules, there are many different types of melanin with different proportions and bonding patterns of these component molecules. Both pheomelanin and eumelanin are found in human skin and hair, but eumelanin is the most abundant melanin in humans, as well as the form most likely to be deficient in albinism.

== Other organisms ==
Melanins have very diverse roles and functions in various organisms. A form of melanin makes up the ink used by many cephalopods (see cephalopod ink) as a defense mechanism against predators. Melanins also protect microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi, against stresses that involve cell damage such as UV radiation from the sun and reactive oxygen species. Melanin also protects against damage from high temperatures, chemical stresses (such as heavy metals and oxidizing agents), and biochemical threats (such as host defenses against invading microbes). Therefore, in many pathogenic microbes (for example, in &quot;Cryptococcus neoformans&quot;, a fungus) melanins appear to play important roles in virulence and pathogenicity by protecting the microbe against immune responses of its host. In invertebrates, a major aspect of the innate immune defense system against invading pathogens involves melanin. Within minutes after infection, the microbe is encapsulated within melanin (melanization), and the generation of free radical byproducts during the formation of this capsule is thought to aid in killing them. Some types of fungi, called radiotrophic fungi, appear to be able to use melanin as a photosynthetic pigment that enables them to capture gamma rays and harness this energy for growth.

In fish, melanin occurs not only in the skin but also in internal organs such as eyes. Most fish species use eumelanin, but &quot;Stegastes apicalis&quot; and &quot;Cyprinus carpio&quot; use pheomelanin instead.

The darker feathers of birds owe their color to melanin and are less readily degraded by bacteria than unpigmented ones or those containing carotenoid pigments. Feathers that contain melanin are also 39% more resistant to abrasion than those that do not because melanin granules help fill the space between the keratin strands that form feathers. Pheomelanin synthesis in birds implies the consumption of cysteine, a semi‐essential amino acid that is necessary for the synthesis of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH) but that may be toxic if in excess in the diet. Indeed, many carnivorous birds, which have a high protein content in their diet, exhibit pheomelanin‐based coloration.

Melanin is also important in mammalian pigmentation. The coat pattern of mammals is determined by the agouti gene which regulates the distribution of melanin. The mechanisms of the gene have been extensively studied in mice to provide an insight into the diversity of mammalian coat patterns.

Melanin in arthropods has been observed to be deposited in layers thus producing a Bragg reflector of alternating refractive index. When the scale of this pattern matches the wavelength of visible light, structural coloration arises: giving a number of species an iridescent color.

Arachnids are one of the few groups in which melanin has not been easily detected, though researchers found data suggesting spiders do in fact produce melanin.

Some moth species, including the wood tiger moth, convert resources to melanin to enhance their thermoregulation. As the wood tiger moth has populations over a large range of latitudes, it has been observed that more northern populations showed higher rates of melanization. In both yellow and white male phenotypes of the wood tiger moth, individuals with more melanin had a heightened ability to trap heat but an increased predation rate due to a weaker and less effective aposematic signal.

Melanin may protect &quot;Drosophila&quot; flies and mice against DNA damage from non-UV radiation.

=== Plants ===

Melanin produced by plants are sometimes referred to as &#x27;catechol melanins&#x27; as they can yield catechol on alkali fusion. It is commonly seen in the enzymatic browning of fruits such as bananas. Chestnut shell melanin can be used as an antioxidant and coloring agent. Biosynthesis involves the oxidation of indole-5,6-quinone by the tyrosinase type polyphenol oxidase from tyrosine and catecholamines leading to the formation of catechol melanin. Despite this many plants contain compounds which inhibit the production of melanins.

== Interpretation as a single monomer ==
It is now understood that melanins do not have a single structure or stoichiometry. Nonetheless, chemical databases such as PubChem include structural and empirical formulae; typically &quot;3,8-Dimethyl-2,7-dihydrobenzo[1,2,3-&quot;cd&quot;:4,5,6-&quot;c&quot;′&quot;d&quot;′]diindole-4,5,9,10-tetrone&quot;. This can be thought of as a single monomer that accounts for the measured elemental composition and some properties of melanin, but is unlikely to be found in nature. Solano claims that this misleading trend stems from a report of an empirical formula in 1948, but provides no other historical detail.

== Biosynthetic pathways ==
The first step of the biosynthetic pathway for both eumelanins and pheomelanins is catalysed by tyrosinase.
:Tyrosine → DOPA → dopaquinone
Dopaquinone can combine with cysteine by two pathways to benzothiazines and pheomelanins
:dopaquinone + cysteine → 5-S-cysteinyldopa → benzothiazine intermediate → pheomelanin

:dopaquinone + cysteine → 2-S-cysteinyldopa → benzothiazine intermediate → pheomelanin

Also, dopaquinone can be converted to leucodopachrome and follow two more pathways to the eumelanins
:dopaquinone → leucodopachrome → dopachrome → 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid → quinone → eumelanin

:dopaquinone → leucodopachrome → dopachrome → 5,6-dihydroxyindole → quinone → eumelanin

Detailed metabolic pathways can be found in the KEGG database (see External links).

== Microscopic appearance ==
Melanin is brown, non-refractile, and finely granular with individual granules having a diameter of less than 800 nanometers. This differentiates melanin from common blood breakdown pigments, which are larger, chunky, and refractile, and range in color from green to yellow or red-brown. In heavily pigmented lesions, dense aggregates of melanin can obscure histologic detail. A dilute solution of potassium permanganate is an effective melanin bleach.

== Genetic disorders and disease states ==
There are approximately nine types of oculocutaneous albinism, which is mostly an autosomal recessive disorder. Certain ethnicities have higher incidences of different forms. For example, the most common type, called oculocutaneous albinism type 2 (OCA2), is especially frequent among people of black African descent and white Europeans. People with OCA2 usually have fair skin, but are often not as pale as OCA1. They (OCA2 or OCA1? see comments in History) have pale blonde to golden, strawberry blonde, or even brown hair, and most commonly blue eyes. 98.7–100% of modern Europeans are carriers of the derived allele SLC24A5, a known cause of nonsyndromic oculocutaneous albinism. It is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a congenital reduction or absence of melanin pigment in the skin, hair, and eyes. The estimated frequency of OCA2 among African-Americans is 1 in 10,000, which contrasts with a frequency of 1 in 36,000 in white Americans. In some African nations, the frequency of the disorder is even higher, ranging from 1 in 2,000 to 1 in 5,000. Another form of Albinism, the &quot;yellow oculocutaneous albinism&quot;, appears to be more prevalent among the Amish, who are of primarily Swiss and German ancestry. People with this IB variant of the disorder commonly have white hair and skin at birth, but rapidly develop normal skin pigmentation in infancy.

Ocular albinism affects not only eye pigmentation but visual acuity, as well. People with albinism typically test poorly, within the 20/60 to 20/400 range. In addition, two forms of albinism, with approximately 1 in 2,700 most prevalent among people of Puerto Rican origin, are associated with mortality beyond melanoma-related deaths.

The connection between albinism and deafness is well known, though poorly understood. In his 1859 treatise &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;, Charles Darwin observed that &quot;cats which are entirely white and have blue eyes are generally deaf&quot;. In humans, hypopigmentation and deafness occur together in the rare Waardenburg&#x27;s syndrome, predominantly observed among the Hopi in North America. The incidence of albinism in Hopi Indians has been estimated as approximately 1 in 200 individuals. Similar patterns of albinism and deafness have been found in other mammals, including dogs and rodents. However, a lack of melanin &quot;per se&quot; does not appear to be directly responsible for deafness associated with hypopigmentation, as most individuals lacking the enzymes required to synthesize melanin have normal auditory function. Instead, the absence of melanocytes in the stria vascularis of the inner ear results in cochlear impairment, though the reasons for this are not fully understood.

In Parkinson&#x27;s disease, a disorder that affects neuromotor functioning, there is decreased neuromelanin in the substantia nigra and locus coeruleus as a consequence of specific dropping out of dopaminergic and noradrenergic pigmented neurons. This results in diminished dopamine and norepinephrine synthesis. While no correlation between race and the level of neuromelanin in the substantia nigra has been reported, the significantly lower incidence of Parkinson&#x27;s in blacks than in whites has &quot;prompt[ed] some to suggest that cutaneous melanin might somehow serve to protect the neuromelanin in substantia nigra from external toxins.&quot;

In addition to melanin deficiency, the molecular weight of the melanin polymer may be decreased by various factors such as oxidative stress, exposure to light, perturbation in its association with melanosomal matrix proteins, changes in pH, or in local concentrations of metal ions. A decreased molecular weight or a decrease in the degree of polymerization of ocular melanin has been proposed to turn the normally anti-oxidant polymer into a pro-oxidant. In its pro-oxidant state, melanin has been suggested to be involved in the causation and progression of macular degeneration and melanoma. Rasagiline, an important monotherapy drug in Parkinson&#x27;s disease, has melanin binding properties, and melanoma tumor reducing properties.

Higher eumelanin levels also can be a disadvantage, however, beyond a higher disposition toward vitamin D deficiency. Dark skin is a complicating factor in the laser removal of port-wine stains. Effective in treating white skin, in general, lasers are less successful in removing port-wine stains in people of Asian or African descent. Higher concentrations of melanin in darker-skinned individuals simply diffuse and absorb the laser radiation, inhibiting light absorption by the targeted tissue. In a similar manner, melanin can complicate laser treatment of other dermatological conditions in people with darker skin.

Freckles and moles are formed where there is a localized concentration of melanin in the skin. They are highly associated with pale skin.

Nicotine has an affinity for melanin-containing tissues because of its precursor function in melanin synthesis or its irreversible binding of melanin. This has been suggested to underlie the increased nicotine dependence and lower smoking cessation rates in darker pigmented individuals.

== Human adaptations ==
===Physiology===
Melanocytes insert granules of melanin into specialized cellular vesicles called melanosomes. These are then transferred into the keratinocyte cells of the human epidermis. The melanosomes in each recipient cell accumulate atop the cell nucleus, where they protect the nuclear DNA from mutations caused by the ionizing radiation of the sun&#x27;s ultraviolet rays. In general, people whose ancestors lived for long periods in the regions of the globe near the equator have larger quantities of eumelanin in their skins. This makes their skins brown or black and protects them against high levels of exposure to the sun, which more frequently result in melanomas in lighter-skinned people.

Not all the effects of pigmentation are advantageous. Pigmentation increases the heat load in hot climates, and dark-skinned people absorb 30% more heat from sunlight than do very light-skinned people, although this factor may be offset by more profuse sweating. In cold climates dark skin entails more heat loss by radiation. Pigmentation also hinders synthesis of vitamin D. Since pigmentation appears to be not entirely advantageous to life in the tropics, other hypotheses about its biological significance have been advanced; for example a secondary phenomenon induced by adaptation to parasites and tropical diseases.

===Evolutionary origins===
Early humans evolved dark skin color, as an adaptation to a loss of body hair that increased the effects of UV radiation. Before the development of hairlessness, early humans might have had light skin underneath their fur, similar to that found in other primates. Anatomically modern humans evolved in Africa between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago, and then populated the rest of the world through migration between 80,000 and 50,000 years ago, in some areas interbreeding with certain archaic human species (Neanderthals, Denisovans, and possibly others). The first modern humans had darker skin as the indigenous people of Africa today. Following migration and settlement in Asia and Europe, the selective pressure dark UV-radiation protecting skin decreased where radiation from the sun was less intense. This resulted in the current range of human skin color. Of the two common gene variants known to be associated with pale human skin, &quot;Mc1r&quot; does not appear to have undergone positive selection, while &quot;SLC24A5&quot; has undergone positive selection.

===Effects===
As with peoples having migrated northward, those with light skin migrating toward the equator acclimatize to the much stronger solar radiation. Nature selects for less melanin when ultraviolet radiation is weak. Most people&#x27;s skin darkens when exposed to UV light, giving them more protection when it is needed. This is the physiological purpose of sun tanning. Dark-skinned people, who produce more skin-protecting eumelanin, have a greater protection against sunburn and the development of melanoma, a potentially deadly form of skin cancer, as well as other health problems related to exposure to strong solar radiation, including the photodegradation of certain vitamins such as riboflavins, carotenoids, tocopherol, and folate.

Melanin in the eyes, in the iris and choroid, helps protect from ultraviolet and high-frequency visible light; people with blue, green, and grey eyes are more at risk of sun-related eye problems. Furthermore, the ocular lens yellows with age, providing added protection. However, the lens also becomes more rigid with age, losing most of its accommodation—the ability to change shape to focus from far to near—a detriment due probably to protein crosslinking caused by UV exposure.

Recent research suggests that melanin may serve a protective role other than photoprotection. Melanin is able to effectively chelate metal ions through its carboxylate and phenolic hydroxyl groups, often much more efficiently than the powerful chelating ligand ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA). Thus, it may serve to sequester potentially toxic metal ions, protecting the rest of the cell. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the loss of neuromelanin, observed in Parkinson&#x27;s disease, is accompanied by an increase in iron levels in the brain.

== Physical properties and technological applications ==
Evidence exists for a highly cross-linked heteropolymer bound covalently to matrix scaffolding melanoproteins. It has been proposed that the ability of melanin to act as an antioxidant is directly proportional to its degree of polymerization or molecular weight. Suboptimal conditions for the effective polymerization of melanin monomers may lead to formation of pro-oxidant melanin with lower-molecular-weight, implicated in the causation and progression of macular degeneration and melanoma. Signaling pathways that upregulate melanization in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) also may be implicated in the downregulation of rod outer segment phagocytosis by the RPE. This phenomenon has been attributed in part to foveal sparing in macular degeneration.

=== Role in melanoma metastasis ===
Heavily pigmented melanoma cells have a Young&#x27;s modulus of about 4.93 kPa, compared to non-pigmented cells, with a value of 0.98 kPa. The elasticity of melanoma cells is crucial to metastasis and growth; non-pigmented tumors were larger than pigmented tumors, and spread far more easily. Pigmented and non-pigmented cells are both present in melanoma tumors, so that they can both be drug-resistant and metastatic.

<text>Akkadian ( ; ) was an East Semitic language that is attested in ancient Mesopotamia (Akkad, Assyria, Isin, Larsa, Babylonia and perhaps Dilmun) from mid third millennium BC until its gradual replacement in common use by Old Aramaic among Assyrians and Babylonians from the 8th century BC.

Akkadian, which is the earliest documented Semitic language, is named after the city of Akkad, a major centre of Mesopotamian civilization during the Akkadian Empire (–2154 BC). It was written using the cuneiform script, originally used for Sumerian, but also used to write multiple languages in the region including Eblaite, Hurrian, Elamite, Old Persian and Hittite. The influence of Sumerian on Akkadian went beyond just the cuneiform script; owing to their close proximity, a lengthy span of contact and the prestige held by the former, Sumerian significantly impacted Akkadian phonology, vocabulary and syntax. This mutual influence of Akkadian and Sumerian has also led scholars to describe the languages as a &quot;Sprachbund&quot;.

Akkadian proper names are first attested in Sumerian texts in the mid-3rd millennium BC, and inscriptions ostensibly written in Sumerian but whose character order reveals that they were intended to be read in East Semitic (presumably early Akkadian) date back to as early as . From about the 25th century BC, texts fully written in Akkadian begin to appear. By the 20th century BC, two variant dialectic forms of the same language were in use in Assyria and Babylonia, known as Assyrian and Babylonian respectively. The bulk of preserved material is from this later period, corresponding to the Near Eastern Iron Age. In total, hundreds of thousands of texts and text fragments have been excavated, covering a vast textual tradition of religious and mythological narrative, legal texts, scientific works, personal correspondence, political, civil and military events, economic tracts and many other examples.

Centuries after the fall of the Akkadian Empire, Akkadian, in its Assyrian and Babylonian varieties, was the native language of the Mesopotamian empires (Old Assyrian Empire, Babylonia, Middle Assyrian Empire) throughout the later Bronze Age, and became the lingua franca of much of the Ancient Near East by the time of the Bronze Age collapse . However, its gradual decline began in the Iron Age, during the Neo-Assyrian Empire when in the mid-eighth century BC Tiglath-Pileser III introduced Imperial Aramaic as a lingua franca of the Assyrian empire. By the Hellenistic period, the language was largely confined to scholars and priests working in temples in Assyria and Babylonia. The last known Akkadian cuneiform document dates from the 1st century AD.

Mandaic spoken by Mandean Gnostics and the dialects spoken by the extant Assyrians (Suret) are three extant Neo-Aramaic languages that retain Akkadian vocabulary and grammatical features, as well as personal and family names. These are spoken by Assyrians and Mandeans mainly in northern Iraq, southeast Turkey, northeast Syria, northwest Iran, the southern Caucasus and by communities in the Assyrian diaspora.

Akkadian is a fusional language with grammatical case. Like all Semitic languages, Akkadian uses the system of consonantal roots. The Kültepe texts, which were written in Old Assyrian, include Hittite loanwords and names, which constitute the oldest record of any Indo-European language.

==Classification==

Akkadian belongs with the other Semitic languages in the Near Eastern branch of the Afroasiatic languages, a family native to Middle East, Arabian Peninsula, parts of Anatolia, parts of the Horn of Africa, North Africa, Malta, Canary Islands and parts of West Africa (Hausa). Akkadian is only ever attested in Mesopotamia and neighboring regions in the Near East.

Within the Near Eastern Semitic languages, Akkadian forms an East Semitic subgroup (with Eblaite and perhaps Dilmunite). This group differs from the Northwest Semitic languages and South Semitic languages in its subject–object–verb word order, while the other Semitic languages usually have either a verb–subject–object or subject–verb–object order.

Additionally Akkadian is the only Semitic language to use the prepositions &quot;ina&quot; and &quot;ana&quot; (locative case, English &quot;in&quot;/&quot;on&quot;/&quot;with&quot;, and dative-locative case, &quot;for&quot;/&quot;to&quot;, respectively). Other Semitic languages like Arabic, Hebrew and Aramaic have the prepositions &quot;bi/bə&quot; and &quot;li/lə&quot; (locative and dative, respectively). The origin of the Akkadian spatial prepositions is unknown.

In contrast to most other Semitic languages, Akkadian has only one non-sibilant fricative: ḫ . Akkadian lost both the glottal and pharyngeal fricatives, which are characteristic of the other Semitic languages. Until the Old Babylonian period, the Akkadian sibilants were exclusively affricated.

==History and writing==

===Writing===
Old Akkadian is preserved on clay tablets dating back to . It was written using cuneiform, a script adopted from the Sumerians using wedge-shaped symbols pressed in wet clay. As employed by Akkadian scribes, the adapted cuneiform script could represent either (a) Sumerian logograms (&quot;i.e.&quot;, picture-based characters representing entire words), (b) Sumerian syllables, (c) Akkadian syllables, or (d) phonetic complements. In Akkadian the script practically became a fully fledged syllabic script, and the original logographic nature of cuneiform became secondary, though logograms for frequent words such as &#x27;god&#x27; and &#x27;temple&#x27; continued to be used. For this reason, the sign &quot;AN&quot; can on the one hand be a logogram for the word &quot;ilum&quot; (&#x27;god&#x27;) and on the other signify the god Anu or even the syllable &quot;-an-&quot;. Additionally, this sign was used as a determinative for divine names.

Another peculiarity of Akkadian cuneiform is that many signs do not have a well defined phonetic value. Certain signs, such as &#x27;, do not distinguish between the different vowel qualities. Nor is there any coordination in the other direction; the syllable &#x27;, for example, is rendered by the sign &#x27;, but also by the sign &#x27;. Both of these are often used for the same syllable in the same text.

Cuneiform was in many ways unsuited to Akkadian: among its flaws was its inability to represent important phonemes in Semitic, including a glottal stop, pharyngeals, and emphatic consonants. In addition, cuneiform was a syllabary writing system—i.e., a consonant plus vowel comprised one writing unit—frequently inappropriate for a Semitic language made up of triconsonantal roots (i.e., three consonants plus any vowels).

===Development===
Akkadian is divided into several varieties based on geography and historical period:
*Old Akkadian, 2500–1950 BC
*Old Babylonian and Old Assyrian, 1950–1530 BC
*Middle Babylonian and Middle Assyrian, 1530–1000 BC
*Neo-Babylonian and Neo-Assyrian, 1000–600 BC
*Late Babylonian, 600 BC–100 AD

One of the earliest known Akkadian inscriptions was found on a bowl at Ur, addressed to the very early pre-Sargonic king Meskiagnunna of Ur (–2450 BC) by his queen Gan-saman, who is thought to have been from Akkad. The Akkadian Empire, established by Sargon of Akkad, introduced the Akkadian language (the &quot;language of Akkad&quot;) as a written language, adapting Sumerian cuneiform orthography for the purpose. During the Middle Bronze Age (Old Assyrian and Old Babylonian period), the language virtually displaced Sumerian, which is assumed to have been extinct as a living language by the 18th century BC.

Old Akkadian, which was used until the end of the 3rd millennium BC, differed from both Babylonian and Assyrian, and was displaced by these dialects. By the 21st century BC Babylonian and Assyrian, which were to become the primary dialects, were easily distinguishable. Old Babylonian, along with the closely related dialect Mariotic, is clearly more innovative than the Old Assyrian dialect and the more distantly related Eblaite language. For this reason, forms like &quot;lu-prus&quot; (&#x27;I will decide&#x27;) were first encountered in Old Babylonian instead of the older &quot;la-prus&quot;.

While generally more archaic, Assyrian developed certain innovations as well, such as the &quot;Assyrian vowel harmony&quot;. Eblaite was even more so, retaining a productive dual and a relative pronoun declined in case, number and gender. Both of these had already disappeared in Old Akkadian. Over 20,000 cuneiform tablets in Old Assyrian have been recovered from the Kültepe site in Anatolia.
Most of the archaeological evidence is typical of Anatolia rather than of Assyria, but the use both of cuneiform and the dialect is the best indication of Assyrian presence.

Old Babylonian was the language of king Hammurabi and his code, which is one of the oldest collections of laws in the world. (see Code of Ur-Nammu.) Old Assyrian developed as well during the second millennium BC, but because it was a purely popular language—kings wrote in Babylonian—few long texts are preserved. It was, however, notably used in the correspondence of Assyrian traders in Anatolia in the 20th–18th centuries BC and that even led to its temporary adoption as a diplomatic language by various local Anatolian polities during that time.

The Middle Babylonian period started in the 16th century BC. The division is marked by the Kassite invasion of Babylonia around 1550 BC. The Kassites, who reigned for 300 years, gave up their own language in favor of Akkadian, but they had little influence on the language. At its apogee, Middle Babylonian was the written language of diplomacy of the entire Ancient Near East, including Egypt (Amarna Period). During this period, a large number of loan words were included in the language from Northwest Semitic languages and Hurrian. However, the use of these words was confined to the fringes of the Akkadian-speaking territory.

From 1500 BC onwards, the Assyrian language is termed Middle Assyrian. It was the language of the Middle Assyrian Empire. However, the Babylonian cultural influence was strong and the Assyrians wrote royal inscriptions, religious and most scholarly texts in Middle Babylonian, whereas Middle Assyrian was used mostly in letters and administrative documents.

During the first millennium BC, Akkadian progressively lost its status as a &quot;lingua franca&quot;. In the beginning, from around 1000 BC, Akkadian and Aramaic were of equal status, as can be seen in the number of copied texts: clay tablets were written in Akkadian, while scribes writing on papyrus and leather used Aramaic. From this period on, one speaks of Neo-Babylonian and Neo-Assyrian.

Neo-Assyrian experienced an upswing in popularity in the 10th century BC when the Assyrian kingdom became a major power with the Neo-Assyrian Empire. During the existence of that empire, however, Neo-Assyrian began to turn into a chancellery language, being marginalized by Old Aramaic. The dominance of the Neo-Assyrian Empire under Tiglath-Pileser III over Aram-Damascus in the middle of the 8th century led to the establishment of Aramaic as a &quot;lingua franca&quot; of the empire, rather than it being eclipsed by Akkadian. Texts written &#x27;exclusively&#x27; in Neo-Assyrian disappear within 10 years of Nineveh&#x27;s destruction in 612 BC. Under the Achaemenids, Aramaic continued to prosper, but Assyrian continued its decline. The language&#x27;s final demise came about during the Hellenistic period when it was further marginalized by Koine Greek, even though Neo-Assyrian cuneiform remained in use in literary tradition well into Parthian times.

Similarly, the Persian conquest of the Mesopotamian kingdoms contributed to the decline of Babylonian, from that point on known as Late Babylonian, as a popular language. However, the language was still used in its written form. Even after the Greek invasion under Alexander the Great in the 4th century BC, Akkadian was still a contender as a written language, but spoken Akkadian was likely extinct by this time, or at least rarely used. The last positively identified Akkadian text comes from the 1st century AD. The latest known text in cuneiform Babylonian is an astronomical almanac dated to 79/80 AD. However, the latest cuneiform texts are almost entirely written in Sumerian logograms. Iamblichus, a 2nd century Syrian novelist, may have been one of the last known people to know Babylonian.

===Decipherment===
The Akkadian language began to be rediscovered when Carsten Niebuhr in 1767 was able to make extensive copies of cuneiform texts and published them in Denmark. The deciphering of the texts started immediately, and bilinguals, in particular Old Persian-Akkadian bilinguals, were of great help. Since the texts contained several royal names, isolated signs could be identified, and were presented in 1802 by Georg Friedrich Grotefend. By this time it was already evident that Akkadian was a Semitic language, and the final breakthrough in deciphering the language came from Edward Hincks, Henry Rawlinson and Jules Oppert in the middle of the 19th century.

In the early 21st century it was shown that automatic high-quality translation of Akkadian can be achieved using natural language processing methods such as convolutional neural networks.
===Dialects===
The following table summarises the dialects of Akkadian identified with certainty so far.

Some researchers (such as W. Sommerfeld 2003) believe that the Old Akkadian variant used in the older texts is not an ancestor of the later Assyrian and Babylonian dialects, but rather a separate dialect that was replaced by these two dialects and which died out early.

Eblaite, formerly thought of as yet another Akkadian dialect, is now generally considered a separate East Semitic language.

==Phonology==

Because Akkadian as a spoken language is extinct and no contemporary descriptions of the pronunciation are known, little can be said with certainty about the phonetics and phonology of Akkadian. Some conclusions can be made, however, due to the relationship to the other Semitic languages and variant spellings of Akkadian words.

===Consonants===
The following table presents the consonants of the Akkadian language, as distinguished in Akkadian cuneiform. The reconstructed phonetic value of a phoneme is given in IPA transcription, alongside its standard (DMG-Umschrift) transliteration in angle brackets .


==== Reconstruction ====

Akkadian emphatic consonants are typically reconstructed as ejectives, which are thought to be the oldest realization of emphatics across the Semitic languages. One piece of evidence for this is that Akkadian shows a development known as Geers&#x27;s law, where one of two emphatic consonants dissimilates to the corresponding non-emphatic consonant. For the sibilants, traditionally has been held to be postalveolar , and , , analyzed as fricatives; but attested assimilations in Akkadian suggest otherwise. For example, when the possessive suffix &quot;-šu&quot; is added to the root &quot;awat&quot; (&#x27;word&#x27;), it is written &quot;awassu&quot; (&#x27;his word&#x27;) even though &quot;šš&quot; would be expected.

The most straightforward interpretation of this shift from &quot;tš&quot; to &quot;ss&quot;, is that form a pair of voiceless alveolar affricates , is a voiceless alveolar sibilant , and is a voiced alveolar affricate or fricative . The assimilation is then [awat+su] &gt; . In this vein, an alternative transcription of is , with the macron below indicating a soft (lenis) articulation in Semitic transcription. Other interpretations are possible. could have been assimilated to the preceding , yielding , which would later have been simplified to .

The rhotic has traditionally been interpreted as a voiced alveolar trill but its pattern of alternation with suggests it was a fricative (either uvular or velar ). In the Hellenistic period, Akkadian was transcribed using the Greek ρ, indicating it was pronounced similarly as an alveolar sound (though Greeks may also have perceived a uvular trill as ρ).

==== Descent from Proto-Semitic ====
Several Proto-Semitic phonemes are lost in Akkadian. The Proto-Semitic glottal stop , as well as the fricatives , , are lost as consonants, either by sound change or orthographically, but they gave rise to the vowel quality &quot;e&quot; not exhibited in Proto-Semitic. The voiceless lateral fricatives () merged with the sibilants as in Canaanite, leaving 19 consonantal phonemes. Old Akkadian preserved the /*ś/ phoneme longest but it eventually merged with /*š/, beginning in the Old Babylonian period. The following table shows Proto-Semitic phonemes and their correspondences among Akkadian, Modern Standard Arabic and Tiberian Hebrew:

===Vowels===
The existence of a back mid-vowel has been proposed, but the cuneiform writing gives no good proof for this. There is limited contrast between different u-signs in lexical texts, but this scribal differentiation may reflect the superimposition of the Sumerian phonological system (for which an /o/ phoneme has also been proposed), rather than a separate phoneme in Akkadian.

All consonants and vowels appear in long and short forms. Long consonants are transliterated as double consonants, and inconsistently written as such in cuneiform. Long vowels are transliterated with a macron (ā, ē, ī, ū) or a circumflex (â, ê, î, û), the latter being used for long vowels arising from the contraction of vowels in hiatus. The distinction between long and short is phonemic, and is used in the grammar; for example, &quot;iprusu&quot; (&#x27;that he decided&#x27;) versus &quot;iprusū&quot; (&#x27;they decided&#x27;).

===Stress===
There is broad agreement among most Assyriologists about Akkadian stress patterns. The rules of Akkadian stress were originally reconstructed by means of a comparison with other Semitic languages, and the resulting picture was gradually amended using internal linguistic evidence from Akkadian sources, especially deriving from so-called &quot;plene&quot; spellings (spellings with an extra vowel).

According to this widely accepted system, the place of stress in Akkadian is completely predictable and sensitive to syllable weight. There are three syllable weights: &quot;light&quot; (ending in -V); &quot;heavy&quot; (ending in -V̄ or -VC), and &quot;superheavy&quot; (ending in -V̂, -V̄C or -V̂C). If the last syllable is superheavy, it is stressed, otherwise the rightmost heavy non-final syllable is stressed. If a word contains only light syllables, the first syllable is stressed. It has also been argued that monosyllabic words generally are not stressed but rather function as clitics. The special behaviour of /V̂/ syllables is explained by their functioning, in accordance with their historical origin, as sequences of two syllables, of which the first one bears stress.

A rule of Akkadian phonology is that certain short (and probably unstressed) vowels are dropped. The rule is that the last vowel of a succession of syllables that end in a short vowel is dropped, for example the declinational root of the verbal adjective of a root PRS is &quot;PaRiS-&quot;. Thus the masculine singular nominative is &quot;PaRS-um&quot; (&lt; &quot;*PaRiS-um&quot;) but the feminine singular nominative is &quot;PaRiStum&quot; (&lt; &quot;*PaRiS-at-um&quot;). Additionally there is a general tendency of syncope of short vowels in the later stages of Akkadian.

==Grammar==

===Morphology===

====Consonantal root====
Most roots of the Akkadian language consist of three consonants, called the radicals, but some roots are composed of four consonants, so-called quadriradicals. The radicals are occasionally represented in transcription in upper-case letters, for example &quot;PRS&quot; (to decide). Between and around these radicals various infixes, suffixes and prefixes, having word generating or grammatical functions, are inserted. The resulting consonant-vowel pattern differentiates the original meaning of the root. The middle radical can be geminated, which is represented by a doubled consonant in transcription, and sometimes in the cuneiform writing itself.

The consonants &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27; and &#x27; are termed &quot;weak radicals&quot; and roots containing these radicals give rise to irregular forms.

==== Case, number and gender ====
Formally, Akkadian has three numbers (singular, dual and plural) and three cases (nominative, accusative and genitive). However, even in the earlier stages of the language, the dual number is vestigial, and its use is largely confined to natural pairs (eyes, ears, etc.). Adjectives are never found in the dual. In the dual and plural, the accusative and genitive are merged into a single oblique case.

Akkadian, unlike Arabic, has only &quot;sound&quot; plurals formed by means of a plural ending. Broken plurals are not formed by changing the word stem. As in all Semitic languages, some masculine nouns take the prototypically feminine plural ending (&quot;-āt&quot;).

The nouns &quot;šarrum&quot; (king) and &quot;šarratum&quot; (queen) and the adjective &quot;dannum&quot; (strong) will serve to illustrate the case system of Akkadian.

As is clear from the above table, the adjective and noun endings differ only in the masculine plural. Certain nouns, primarily those referring to geography, can also form a locative ending in &quot;-um&quot; in the singular and the resulting forms serve as adverbials. These forms are generally not productive, but in the Neo-Babylonian the &quot;um&quot;-locative replaces several constructions with the preposition &quot;ina&quot;.

In the later stages of Akkadian, the mimation (word-final &quot;-m&quot;) and nunation (dual final &quot;-n&quot;) that occurred at the end of most case endings disappeared, except in the locative. Later, the nominative and accusative singular of masculine nouns collapsed to &quot;-u&quot; and in Neo-Babylonian most word-final short vowels were dropped. As a result, case differentiation disappeared from all forms except masculine plural nouns. However, many texts continued the practice of writing the case endings, although often sporadically and incorrectly. As the most important contact language throughout this period was Aramaic, which itself lacks case distinctions, it is possible that Akkadian&#x27;s loss of cases was an areal as well as phonological phenomenon.

====Noun states and nominal sentences====
As is also the case in other Semitic languages, Akkadian nouns may appear in a variety of &quot;states&quot; depending on their grammatical function in a sentence. The basic form of the noun is the &quot;status rectus&quot; (the governed state), which is the form as described above, complete with case endings. In addition to this, Akkadian has the &quot;status absolutus&quot; (the absolute state) and the &quot;status constructus&quot; (construct state). The latter is found in all other Semitic languages, while the former appears only in Akkadian and some dialects of Aramaic.

The status absolutus is characterised by the loss of a noun&#x27;s case ending (e.g. &quot;awīl&quot; &lt; &quot;awīlum&quot;, &quot;šar&quot; &lt; &quot;šarrum&quot;). It is relatively uncommon, and is used chiefly to mark the predicate of a nominal sentence, in fixed adverbial expressions, and in expressions relating to measurements of length, weight, and the like.

The status constructus is more common by far, and has a much wider range of applications. It is employed when a noun is followed by another noun in the genitive, a pronominal suffix, or a verbal clause in the subjunctive, and typically takes the &quot;shortest form of the noun which is phonetically possible&quot;. In general, this amounts to the loss of case endings with short vowels, with the exception of the genitive -i in nouns preceding a pronominal suffix, hence:

but

There are numerous exceptions to this general rule, usually involving potential violations of the language&#x27;s phonological limitations. Most obviously, Akkadian does not tolerate word-final consonant clusters, so nouns like &quot;kalbum&quot; (dog) and &quot;maḫrum&quot; (front) would have illegal construct state forms &quot;*kalb&quot; and &quot;*maḫr&quot; unless modified. In many of these instances, the first vowel of the word is simply repeated (e.g. &quot;kalab&quot;, &quot;maḫar&quot;). This rule, however, does not always hold true, especially in nouns where a short vowel has historically been elided (e.g. &quot;šaknum&quot; &lt; &quot;*šakinum&quot; &quot;governor&quot;). In these cases, the lost vowel is restored in the construct state (so &quot;šaknum&quot; yields &quot;šakin&quot;).

A genitive relation can also be expressed with the relative preposition &quot;ša&quot;, and the noun that the genitive phrase depends on appears in status rectus.

The same preposition is also used to introduce true relative clauses, in which case the verb is placed in the subjunctive mood.

====Verbal morphology====

=====Verb aspects=====
The Akkadian verb has six finite verb aspects (preterite, perfect, present, imperative, precative, and vetitive (the negative form of precative)) and three infinite forms (infinitive, participle and verbal adjective). The preterite is used for actions that are seen by the speaker as having occurred at a single point in time. The present is primarily imperfective in meaning and is used for concurrent and future actions as well as past actions with a temporal dimension. The final three finite forms are injunctive where the imperative and the precative together form a paradigm for positive commands and wishes, and the vetitive is used for negative wishes. The periphrastic prohibitive, formed by the present form of the verb and the negative adverb lā, is used to express negative commands.

The infinitive of the Akkadian verb is a verbal noun, and in contrast to some other languages the Akkadian infinitive can be declined in case. The verbal adjective is an adjectival form and designates the state or the result of the action of the verb, and consequently the exact meaning of the verbal adjective is determined by the semantics of the verb itself. The participle, which can be active or passive, is another verbal adjective and its meaning is similar to the English gerund.

The following table shows the conjugation of the G-stem verbs derived from the root PRS (&quot;to decide&quot;) in the various verb aspects of Akkadian:

The table below shows the different affixes attached to the preterite aspect of the verb root PRS &quot;to decide&quot;; and as can be seen, the grammatical genders differ only in the second person singular and third person plural.

=====Verb moods=====
Akkadian verbs have three moods:
#Indicative, used in independent clauses, is unmarked.
#Subjunctive, used in dependent clauses, is marked in forms which do not end in a vowel by the suffix &quot;-u&quot; (compare Arabic and Ugaritic subjunctives) but is otherwise unmarked. In the later stages of most dialects, the subjunctive is indistinct, as short final vowels were mostly lost.
#Venitive or allative, not a mood in the strictest sense, being a development of the first-person dative pronominal suffix &quot;-am&quot;/&quot;-m&quot;/&quot;-nim&quot;. With verbs of motion, it often indicates motion toward an object or person (&quot;e.g.&quot;, &quot;illik&quot;, &quot;he went&quot; vs. &quot;illikam&quot;, &quot;he came&quot;). However, this pattern is not consistent, even in earlier stages of the language, and its use often appears to serve a stylistic rather than morphological or lexical function.

The following table demonstrates the verb moods of verbs derived from the root PRS (&quot;to decide&quot;, &quot;to separate&quot;):

=====Verb patterns=====
Akkadian verbs have thirteen separate derived stems formed on each root. The basic, underived, stem is the G-stem (from the German Grundstamm, meaning &quot;basic stem&quot;). Causative or intensive forms are formed with the doubled D-stem, and it gets its name from the doubled-middle radical that is characteristic of this form. The doubled middle radical is also characteristic of the present. The forms of the D-stem use the secondary conjugational affixes, so a D-form will never be identical to a form in a different stem. The Š-stem is formed by adding a prefix &quot;š-&quot;, and these forms are mostly causatives. The passive forms of the verb are in the N-stem, formed by adding a &quot;n-&quot; prefix. The &quot;n-&quot; element is assimilated to a following consonant, so the original /n/ is only visible in a few forms.

Reflexive and iterative verbal stems can be derived from each of the basic stems. The reflexive stem is formed with an infix &quot;-ta&quot;, and the derived stems are therefore called Gt, Dt, Št and Nt, and the preterite forms of the Xt-stem are identical to the perfects of the X-stem. Iteratives are formed with the infix &quot;-tan-&quot;, giving the Gtn, Dtn, Štn and Ntn. Because of the assimilation of &quot;n&quot;, the /n/ is only seen in the present forms, and the Xtn preterite is identical to the Xt durative.

The final stem is the ŠD-stem, a form mostly attested only in poetic texts, and whose meaning is usually identical to either the Š-stem or the D-stem of the same verb. It is formed with the Š prefix (like the Š-stem) in addition to a doubled-middle radical (like the D-stem).

An alternative to this naming system is a numerical system. The basic stems are numbered using Roman numerals so that G, D, Š and N become I, II, III and IV, respectively. The infixes are numbered using Arabic numerals; 1 for the forms without an infix, 2 for the Xt, and 3 for the Xtn. The two numbers are separated using a solidus. As an example, the Štn-stem is called III/3. The most important user of this system is the Chicago Assyrian Dictionary.

There is mandatory congruence between the subject of the sentence and the verb. This is expressed by prefixes and suffixes. There are two different sets of affixes, a primary set used for the forms of the G and N-stems, and a secondary set for the D and Š-stems.

The stems, their nomenclature and examples of the third-person masculine singular stative of the verb &quot;parāsum&quot; (root PRS: &#x27;to decide, distinguish, separate&#x27;) is shown below:


===Stative===
A very often appearing form which can be formed by nouns, adjectives as well as by verbal adjectives is the stative. Nominal predicatives occur in the status absolutus and correspond to the verb &quot;to be&quot; in English. The stative in Akkadian corresponds to the Egyptian pseudo-participle. The following table contains an example of using the noun &quot;šarrum&quot; (king), the adjective &quot;rapšum&quot; (wide) and the verbal adjective &quot;parsum&quot; (decided).

Thus, the stative in Akkadian is used to convert simple stems into effective sentences, so that the form &quot;šarr-āta&quot; is equivalent to: &quot;you were king&quot;, &quot;you are king&quot; and &quot;you will be king&quot;. Hence, the stative is independent of time forms.

===Derivation===
Beside the already explained possibility of derivation of different verb stems, Akkadian has numerous nominal formations derived from verb roots. A very frequently encountered form is the maPRaS form. It can express the location of an event, the person performing the act and many other meanings. If one of the root consonants is labial (p, b, m), the prefix becomes na- (maPRaS &gt; naPRaS). Examples for this are: &quot;maškanum&quot; (place, location) from ŠKN (set, place, put), &quot;mašraḫum&quot; (splendour) from ŠRḪ (be splendid), &quot;maṣṣarum&quot; (guards) from NṢR (guard), &quot;napḫarum&quot; (sum) from PḪR (summarize).

A very similar formation is the maPRaSt form. The noun derived from this nominal formation is grammatically feminine. The same rules as for the maPRaS form apply, for example &quot;maškattum&quot; (deposit) from ŠKN (set, place, put), &quot;narkabtum&quot; (carriage) from RKB (ride, drive, mount).

The suffix – ūt is used to derive abstract nouns. The nouns which are formed with this suffix are grammatically feminine. The suffix can be attached to nouns, adjectives and verbs, e.g. &quot;abūtum&quot; (paternity) from &quot;abum&quot; (father), &quot;rabûtum&quot; (size) from &quot;rabûm&quot; (large), &quot;waṣûtum&quot; (leaving) from WṢY (leave).

Also derivatives of verbs from nouns, adjectives and numerals are numerous. For the most part, a D-stem is derived from the root of the noun or adjective. The derived verb then has the meaning of &quot;make X do something&quot; or &quot;becoming X&quot;, for example: &quot;duššûm&quot; (let sprout) from &quot;dīšum&quot; (grass), &quot;šullušum&quot; (to do something for the third time ) from &quot;šalāš&quot; (three).

===Pronouns===

====Personal pronouns====

=====Independent personal pronouns=====
Independent personal pronouns in Akkadian are as follows:

=====Suffixed (or enclitic) pronouns=====
Suffixed (or enclitic) pronouns (mainly denoting the genitive, accusative and dative) are as follows:

====Demonstrative pronouns====
Demonstrative pronouns in Akkadian differ from the Western Semitic variety. The following tables show the Akkadian demonstrative pronouns according to near and far deixis:

====Relative pronouns====
Relative pronouns in Akkadian are shown in the following table:

Unlike plural relative pronouns, singular relative pronouns in Akkadian exhibit full declension for case. Only the form &quot;ša&quot; (originally accusative masculine singular) survived, while the other forms disappeared in time.

====Interrogative pronouns====
The following table shows the interrogative pronouns used in Akkadian:
===Prepositions===
Akkadian has prepositions which consist mainly of only one word. For example: &quot;ina&quot; (in, on, out, through, under), &quot;ana&quot; (to, for, after, approximately), &quot;adi&quot; (to), &quot;aššum&quot; (because of), &quot;eli&quot; (up, over), &quot;ištu/ultu&quot; (of, since), &quot;mala&quot; (in accordance with), &quot;itti&quot; (also, with). There are some compound prepositions which are combined with &quot;ina&quot; and &quot;ana&quot; (e.g. &quot;ina maḫar&quot; (forwards), &quot;ina balu&quot; (without), &quot;ana ṣēr&quot; (up to), &quot;ana maḫar&quot; (forwards). Regardless of the complexity of the preposition, the following noun is always in the genitive case.

Examples: &quot;ina bītim&quot; (in the house, from the house), &quot;ana dummuqim&quot; (to do good), &quot;itti šarrim&quot; (with the king), &quot;ana ṣēr mārīšu&quot; (up to his son).

===Numerals===
Since numerals are written mostly as a number sign in the cuneiform script, the transliteration of many numerals is not well ascertained yet. Along with the counted noun, the cardinal numerals are in the status absolutus. Because other cases are very rare, the forms of the status rectus are known only by isolated numerals. The numerals 1 and 2 as well as 21–29, 31–39, 41–49 correspond with the counted in the grammatical gender. The numerals 3–20, 30, 40 and 50 are characterized by polarity of gender, i.e. if the counted noun is masculine, the numeral would be feminine and vice versa.

This polarity is typical of the Semitic languages and appears, for example, in classical Arabic. The numerals 60, 100, and 1,000 do not change according to the gender of the counted noun. Counted nouns more than two appear in the plural form. Body parts that occur in pairs appear in the dual form in Akkadian; &quot;e.g.&quot;, &quot;šēpum&quot; (foot) becomes &quot;šēpān&quot; (two feet).

The ordinals are formed (with few exceptions) by adding a case ending to the nominal form PaRuS. The P, R and S must be substituted with the suitable consonants of the numeral. It is noted, that in the case of the numeral &quot;one&quot;, the ordinal (masculine) and the cardinal number are the same. A metathesis occurs in the numeral &quot;four&quot;.

Examples: erbē aššātum (four wives) (masculine numeral), meat ālānū (100 towns).

===Syntax===

====Nominal phrases====
Adjectives, relative clauses and appositions follow the noun.
While numerals precede the counted noun.
In the following table the nominal phrase &quot;erbēt šarrū dannūtum ša ālam īpušū abūya&quot; &#x27;the four strong kings who built the city are my fathers&#x27; is analyzed:

====Sentence syntax====
Akkadian sentence order was Subject+Object+Verb (SOV), which sets it apart from most other ancient Semitic languages such as Arabic and Biblical Hebrew, which typically have a verb–subject–object (VSO) word order. Modern South Semitic languages in Ethiopia also have SOV order, but these developed within historical times from the classical verb–subject–object (VSO) language Ge&#x27;ez. It has been hypothesized that this word order was a result of influence from the Sumerian language, which was also SOV. There is evidence that native speakers of both languages were in intimate language contact, forming a single society for at least 500 years, so it is entirely likely that a sprachbund could have formed. Further evidence of an original VSO or SVO ordering can be found in the fact that direct and indirect object pronouns are suffixed to the verb. Word order seems to have shifted to SVO/VSO late in the 1st millennium BC to the 1st millennium AD, possibly under the influence of Aramaic.

==Vocabulary==
The Akkadian vocabulary is mostly of Semitic origin. Although classified as East Semitic, many elements of its basic vocabulary find no evident parallels in related Semitic languages: &quot;mārum&quot; &#x27;son&#x27; (Semitic *bn), &quot;qātum&quot; &#x27;hand&#x27; (Semitic *yd), &quot;šēpum&quot; &#x27;foot&#x27; (Semitic *rgl), &quot;qabûm&quot; &#x27;say&#x27; (Semitic *qwl), &quot;izuzzum&quot; &#x27;stand&#x27; (Semitic *qwm), &quot;ana&quot; &#x27;to, for&#x27; (Semitic *li).

Due to extensive contact with Sumerian and Aramaic, the Akkadian vocabulary contains many loan words from these languages. Aramaic loan words were limited to the 1st centuries of the 1st millennium BC and primarily in the north and middle parts of Mesopotamia. Sumerian loan words were spread in the whole linguistic area. Beside the previous languages, some nouns were borrowed from Hurrian, Kassite, Ugaritic and other ancient languages.

Since Sumerian and Hurrian, two non-Semitic languages, differ from Akkadian in word structure, only nouns and some adjectives (not many verbs) were borrowed from these languages. Some verbs were borrowed, along with many nouns, from Aramaic and Ugaritic, both of which are Semitic languages.

The following table contains examples of loan words in Akkadian:
Akkadian was also a source of borrowing to other Semitic languages such as &quot;biṣru&quot; &quot;onion&quot; (into and ), &quot;āsu&quot; &quot;myrtle&quot; ( &quot;ās&quot;) and so on, above all Sumerian with examples: Sumerian &quot;da-ri&quot; (&#x27;lastingly&#x27;, from Akkadian &quot;dārum&quot;), Sumerian &quot;ra gaba&quot; (&#x27;riders, messenger&#x27;, from Akkadian &quot;rākibum&quot;).

In 2011, the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago completed a 21-volume dictionary, the &quot;Chicago Assyrian Dictionary&quot;, of the Akkadian language. The dictionary took 90 years to develop, beginning in 1921, with the first volume published in 1956. The completion of this work was hailed as a significant milestone for the study of the language by prominent academic Irving Finkel of the British Museum.

<doc id="50521" wikidata="Q35355" url="?curid=50521" title="Sumer">
<text>Sumer () is the earliest known civilization, located in the historical region of southern Mesopotamia (now south-central Iraq), emerging during the Chalcolithic and early Bronze Ages between the sixth and fifth millennium BC. Like nearby Elam, it is one of the cradles of civilization, along with Egypt, the Indus Valley, the Erligang culture of the Yellow River valley, Caral-Supe, and Mesoamerica. Living along the valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, Sumerian farmers grew an abundance of grain and other crops, a surplus which enabled them to form urban settlements. The world&#x27;s earliest known texts come from the Sumerian cities of Uruk and Jemdet Nasr, and date to between , following a period of proto-writing .

==Name==

The term &quot;Sumer&quot; () comes from the Akkadian name for the &quot;Sumerians&quot;, the ancient non-Semitic-speaking inhabitants of southern Mesopotamia. In their inscriptions, the Sumerians called their land &quot;Kengir&quot;, the &quot;Country of the noble lords&quot; (), and their language &quot;Emegir&quot; ( or ).

The origin of the Sumerians is not known, but the people of Sumer referred to themselves as &quot;Black-Headed Ones&quot; or &quot;Black-Headed People&quot; (, or , , phonetically , &quot;head&quot; + &quot;black&quot; + relative marker). For example, the Sumerian king Shulgi described himself as &quot;the king of the four quarters, the pastor of the black-headed people&quot;. The Akkadians also called the Sumerians &quot;black-headed people&quot;, or , in the Semitic Akkadian language.

The Akkadians, the East Semitic-speaking people who later conquered the Sumerian city-states, gave Sumer its main historical name, but the phonological development of the term is uncertain. Hebrew , Egyptian , and Hittite , all referring to southern Mesopotamia, could be western variants of &quot;Sumer&quot;.

==Origins==
Most historians have suggested that Sumer was first permanently settled between and by a West Asian people who spoke the Sumerian language (pointing to the names of cities, rivers, basic occupations, etc., as evidence), a non-Semitic and non-Indo-European agglutinative language isolate.
Others have suggested that the Sumerians were a North African people who migrated from the Green Sahara into the Middle East and were responsible for the spread of farming in the Middle East. However, contrary evidence strongly suggests that the first farming originated in the Fertile Crescent. Although not specifically discussing Sumerians, Lazaridis et al. 2016 have suggested a partial North African origin for some pre-Semitic cultures of the Middle East, particularly Natufians, after testing the genomes of Natufian and Pre-Pottery Neolithic culture-bearers. Craniometric analysis has also suggested an affinity between Natufians and ancient North Africans.

Some scholars associate the Sumerians with the Hurrians and Urartians, and suggest the Caucasus as their homeland. This is not generally accepted.

Based on mentions of Dilmun as the &quot;home city of the land of Sumer&quot; in Sumerian legends and literature, other scholars have suggested the possibility that the Sumerians originated from Dilmun, which was theorized to be the island of Bahrain in the Persian Gulf. In Sumerian mythology, Dilmun was also mentioned as the home of deities such as Enki. The status of Dilmun as the Sumerians’ ancestral homeland has not been established, but archaeologists have found evidence of civilization in Bahrain, namely the existence of Mesopotamian-style round disks.

A prehistoric people who lived in the region before the Sumerians have been termed the &quot;Proto-Euphrateans&quot; or &quot;Ubaidians&quot;, and are theorized to have evolved from the Samarra culture of northern Mesopotamia. The Ubaidians, though never mentioned by the Sumerians themselves, are assumed by modern-day scholars to have been the first civilizing force in Sumer. They drained the marshes for agriculture, developed trade, and established industries, including weaving, leatherwork, metalwork, masonry, and pottery.
Some scholars contest the idea of a Proto-Euphratean language or one substrate language; they think the Sumerian language may originally have been that of the hunting and fishing peoples who lived in the marshland and the Eastern Arabia littoral region and were part of the Arabian bifacial culture. Juris Zarins believes the Sumerians lived along the coast of Eastern Arabia, today&#x27;s Persian Gulf region, before it was flooded at the end of the Ice Age.

Sumerian civilization took form in the Uruk period (4th millennium BC), continuing into the Jemdet Nasr and Early Dynastic periods. The Sumerian city of Eridu, on the coast of the Persian Gulf, is considered to have been one of the oldest cities, where three separate cultures may have fused: that of peasant Ubaidian farmers, living in mud-brick huts and practicing irrigation; that of mobile nomadic Semitic pastoralists living in black tents and following herds of sheep and goats; and that of fisher folk, living in reed huts in the marshlands, who may have been the ancestors of the Sumerians.

Reliable historical records begin with Enmebaragesi (Early Dynastic I). The Sumerians progressively lost control to Semitic states from the northwest. Sumer was conquered by the Semitic-speaking kings of the Akkadian Empire around 2270 BC (short chronology), but Sumerian continued as a sacred language. Native Sumerian rule re-emerged for about a century in the Third Dynasty of Ur at approximately 2100–2000 BC, but the Akkadian language also remained in use for some time.

==Archeological discovery==
The Sumerians were entirely unknown during the early period of modern archeology. Jules Oppert was the first scholar to publish the word Sumer in a lecture on 17 January 1869. The first major excavations of Sumerian cities were in 1877 at Girsu by the French archeologist Ernest de Sarzec, in 1889 at Nippur by John Punnett Peters from the University of Pennsylvania between 1889 and 1900, and in Shuruppak by German archeologist Robert Koldewey in 1902–1903. Major publications of these finds were &quot;&quot;Decouvertes en Chaldée par Ernest de Sarzec&quot; by Léon Heuzey in 1884, &quot;Les Inscriptions de Sumer et d&#x27;Akkad&quot; by François Thureau-Dangin in 1905, and &quot;Grundzüge der sumerischen Grammatik&quot;&quot; on Sumerian grammar by Arno Poebel in 1923.

==City-states in Mesopotamia==
In the late 4th millennium BC, Sumer was divided into many independent city-states, which were divided by canals and boundary stones. Each was centered on a temple dedicated to the particular patron god or goddess of the city and ruled over by a priestly governor (ensi) or by a king (lugal) who was intimately tied to the city&#x27;s religious rites.

An incomplete list of cities that may have been visited, interacted and traded with, invaded, conquered, destroyed, occupied, colonized by and/or otherwise within the Sumerians’ sphere of influence (ordered from south to north):
# Eridu (&quot;Tell Abu Shahrain&quot;)
# Kuara (probably &quot;Tell al-Lahm&quot;)
# Ur (&quot;Tell al-Muqayyar&quot;)
# Kesh (probably &quot;Tell Jidr&quot;)
# Larsa (&quot;Tell as-Senkereh&quot;)
# Uruk (&quot;Warka&quot;)
# Bad-tibira (probably &quot;Tell al-Madain&quot;)
# Lagash (&quot;Tell al-Hiba&quot;)
# Girsu (&quot;Tello or Telloh&quot;)
# Umma (&quot;Tell Jokha&quot;)
# Zabala (&quot;Tell Ibzeikh&quot;)
# Shuruppak (&quot;Tell Fara&quot;)
# Kisurra (&quot;Tell Abu Hatab&quot;)
# Mashkan-shapir (&quot;Tell Abu Duwari&quot;)
# Eresh (probably &quot;Abu Salabikh&quot;) 
# Isin (&quot;Ishan al-Bahriyat&quot;)
# Adab (&quot;Tell Bismaya&quot;)
# Nippur (&quot;Afak&quot;)
# Marad (&quot;Tell Wannat es-Sadum&quot;)
# Dilbat (&quot;Tell ed-Duleim&quot;)
# Borsippa (&quot;Birs Nimrud&quot;)
# Larak (probably &quot;Tell al-Wilayah&quot;)
# Kish (&quot;Tell Uheimir and Ingharra&quot;)
# Kutha (&quot;Tell Ibrahim&quot;)
# Sippar (&quot;Tell Abu Habbah&quot;)
# Der (&quot;al-Badra&quot;)
# Akshak (probably &quot;Tell Rishad&quot;)
# Akkad (probably &quot;Tell Mizyad&quot;)
# Eshnunna (&quot;Tell Asmar&quot;)
# Awan (probably &quot;Godin Tepe&quot;)
# Mari (&quot;Tell Hariri&quot;)
# Hamazi (probably &quot;Kani Jowez&quot;)
# Nagar (&quot;Tell Brak&quot;)

Apart from Mari, which lies full 330 kilometres (205 miles) north-west of Agade, but which is credited in the king list as having exercised kingship in the Early Dynastic II period, and Nagar, an outpost, these cities are all in the Euphrates-Tigris alluvial plain, south of Baghdad in what are now the Bābil, Diyala, Wāsit, Dhi Qar, Basra, Al-Muthannā and Al-Qādisiyyah governorates of Iraq.

==History==

The Sumerian city-states rose to power during the prehistoric Ubaid and Uruk periods. Sumerian written history reaches back to the 27th century BC and before, but the historical record remains obscure until the Early Dynastic III period, , when the language of the written records becomes easier to decipher, which has allowed archaeologists to read contemporary records and inscriptions.

The Akkadian Empire was the first state that successfully united larger parts of Mesopotamia in the 23rd century BC. After the Gutian period, the Ur III kingdom similarly united parts of northern and southern Mesopotamia. It ended in the face of Amorite incursions at the beginning of the second millennium BC. The Amorite &quot;dynasty of Isin&quot; persisted until , when Mesopotamia was united under Babylonian rule.

===Ubaid period===
The Ubaid period is marked by a distinctive style of fine quality painted pottery which spread throughout Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf. The oldest evidence for occupation comes from Tell el-&#x27;Oueili, but, given that environmental conditions in southern Mesopotamia were favourable to human occupation well before the Ubaid period, it is likely that older sites exist but have not yet been found. It appears that this culture was derived from the Samarran culture from northern Mesopotamia. It is not known whether or not these were the actual Sumerians who are identified with the later Uruk culture. The story of the passing of the gifts of civilization (&quot;me&quot;) to Inanna, goddess of Uruk and of love and war, by Enki, god of wisdom and chief god of Eridu, may reflect the transition from Eridu to Uruk.

===Uruk period===

The archaeological transition from the Ubaid period to the Uruk period is marked by a gradual shift from painted pottery domestically produced on a slow wheel to a great variety of unpainted pottery mass-produced by specialists on fast wheels. The Uruk period is a continuation and an outgrowth of Ubaid with pottery being the main visible change.

By the time of the Uruk period, c. 4100–2900 BC calibrated, the volume of trade goods transported along the canals and rivers of southern Mesopotamia facilitated the rise of many large, stratified, temple-centered cities, with populations of over 10,000 people, where centralized administrations employed specialized workers. It is fairly certain that it was during the Uruk period that Sumerian cities began to make use of slave labour captured from the hill country, and there is ample evidence for captured slaves as workers in the earliest texts. Artifacts, and even colonies of this Uruk civilization have been found over a wide area—from the Taurus Mountains in Turkey, to the Mediterranean Sea in the west, and as far east as western Iran.

The Uruk period civilization, exported by Sumerian traders and colonists, like that found at Tell Brak, had an effect on all surrounding peoples, who gradually evolved their own comparable, competing economies and cultures. The cities of Sumer could not maintain remote, long-distance colonies by military force.

Sumerian cities during the Uruk period were probably theocratic and were most likely headed by a priest-king (&quot;ensi&quot;), assisted by a council of elders, including both men and women. It is quite possible that the later Sumerian pantheon was modeled upon this political structure. There was little evidence of organized warfare or professional soldiers during the Uruk period, and towns were generally unwalled. During this period Uruk became the most urbanized city in the world, surpassing for the first time 50,000 inhabitants.

The ancient Sumerian king list includes the early dynasties of several prominent cities from this period. The first set of names on the list is of kings said to have reigned before a major flood occurred. These early names may be fictional, and include some legendary and mythological figures, such as Alulim and Dumizid.

The end of the Uruk period coincided with the Piora oscillation, a dry period from c. 3200–2900 BC that marked the end of a long wetter, warmer climate period from about 9,000 to 5,000 years ago, called the Holocene climatic optimum.

===Early Dynastic Period===
The dynastic period begins c. 2900 BC and was associated with a shift from the temple establishment headed by council of elders led by a priestly &quot;En&quot; (a male figure when it was a temple for a goddess, or a female figure when headed by a male god) towards a more secular Lugal (Lu = man, Gal = great) and includes such legendary patriarchal figures as Dumuzid, Lugalbanda and Gilgamesh—who reigned shortly before the historic record opens c. 2900 BC, when the now deciphered syllabic writing started to develop from the early pictograms. The center of Sumerian culture remained in southern Mesopotamia, even though rulers soon began expanding into neighboring areas, and neighboring Semitic groups adopted much of Sumerian culture for their own.

The earliest dynastic king on the Sumerian king list whose name is known from any other legendary source is Etana, 13th king of the first dynasty of Kish. The earliest king authenticated through archaeological evidence is Enmebaragesi of Kish (Early Dynastic I), whose name is mentioned in the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;—leading to the suggestion that Gilgamesh himself might have been a historical king of Uruk. As the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot; shows, this period was associated with increased war. Cities became walled, and increased in size as undefended villages in southern Mesopotamia disappeared. Both Gilgamesh and one of his predecessors Enmerkar are credited with having built the walls of Uruk.

====1st Dynasty of Lagash====
The dynasty of Lagash (c. 2500–2270 BC), though omitted from the king list, is well attested through several important monuments and many archaeological finds.

Although short-lived, one of the first empires known to history was that of Eannatum of Lagash, who annexed practically all of Sumer, including Kish, Uruk, Ur, and Larsa, and reduced to tribute the city-state of Umma, arch-rival of Lagash. In addition, his realm extended to parts of Elam and along the Persian Gulf. He seems to have used terror as a matter of policy. Eannatum&#x27;s Stele of the Vultures depicts vultures pecking at the severed heads and other body parts of his enemies. His empire collapsed shortly after his death.

Later, Lugal-zage-si, the priest-king of Umma, overthrew the primacy of the Lagash dynasty in the area, then conquered Uruk, making it his capital, and claimed an empire extending from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean. He was the last ethnically Sumerian king before Sargon of Akkad.

===Akkadian Empire===

The Akkadian Empire dates to –2154 BC (middle chronology), founded by Sargon of Akkad. The Eastern Semitic Akkadian language is first attested in proper names of the kings of Kish , preserved in later king lists. There are texts written entirely in Old Akkadian dating from . Use of Old Akkadian was at its peak during the rule of Sargon the Great (–2279 BC), but even then most administrative tablets continued to be written in Sumerian, the language used by the scribes. Gelb and Westenholz differentiate three stages of Old Akkadian: that of the pre-Sargonic era, that of the Akkadian empire, and that of the Ur III period that followed it.

Akkadian and Sumerian coexisted as vernacular languages for about one thousand years, but by around 1800 BC, Sumerian was becoming more of a literary language familiar mainly only to scholars and scribes. Thorkild Jacobsen has argued that there is little break in historical continuity between the pre- and post-Sargon periods, and that too much emphasis has been placed on the perception of a &quot;Semitic vs. Sumerian&quot; conflict. It is certain that Akkadian was also briefly imposed on neighboring parts of Elam that were previously conquered, by Sargon.

===Gutian period===

c. 2193–2119 BC (middle chronology)

====2nd Dynasty of Lagash====

–2110 BC (middle chronology)

Following the downfall of the Akkadian Empire at the hands of Gutians, another native Sumerian ruler, Gudea of Lagash, rose to local prominence and continued the practices of the Sargonic kings&#x27; claims to divinity.

The previous Lagash dynasty, Gudea and his descendants also promoted artistic development and left a large number of archaeological artifacts.

===Ur III period===

Later, the Third Dynasty of Ur under Ur-Nammu and Shulgi (c. 2112–2004 BC, middle chronology), whose power extended as far as southern Assyria, has been erroneously called a &quot;Sumerian renaissance&quot; in the past. Already, the region was becoming more Semitic than Sumerian, with the resurgence of the Akkadian-speaking Semites in Assyria and elsewhere, and the influx of waves of Semitic Martu (Amorites), who founded several competing local powers in the south, including Isin, Larsa, Eshnunna and later, Babylonia.

The last of these eventually came to briefly dominate the south of Mesopotamia as the Babylonian Empire, just as the Old Assyrian Empire had already done in the north from the late 21st century BC. The Sumerian language continued as a sacerdotal language taught in schools in Babylonia and Assyria, much as Latin was used in the Medieval period, for as long as cuneiform was used.

===Fall and transmission===
This period is generally taken to coincide with a major shift in population from southern Mesopotamia toward the north. Ecologically, the agricultural productivity of the Sumerian lands was being compromised as a result of rising salinity. Soil salinity in this region had been long recognized as a major problem. Poorly drained irrigated soils, in an arid climate with high levels of evaporation, led to the buildup of dissolved salts in the soil, eventually reducing agricultural yields severely.

During the Akkadian and Ur III phases, there was a shift from the cultivation of wheat to the more salt-tolerant barley, but this was insufficient, and during the period from 2100 BC to 1700 BC, it is estimated that the population in this area declined by nearly three-fifths. This greatly upset the balance of power within the region, weakening the areas where Sumerian was spoken, and comparatively strengthening those where Akkadian was the major language. Henceforth, Sumerian remained only a literary and liturgical language, similar to the position occupied by Latin in medieval Europe.

Following an Elamite invasion and sack of Ur during the rule of Ibbi-Sin (c. 2028–2004 BC), Sumer came under Amorite rule (taken to introduce the Middle Bronze Age). The independent Amorite states of the 20th to 18th centuries are summarized as the &quot;Dynasty of Isin&quot; in the Sumerian king list, ending with the rise of Babylonia under Hammurabi c. 1800 BC.

Later rulers who dominated Assyria and Babylonia occasionally assumed the old Sargonic title &quot;King of Sumer and Akkad&quot;, such as Tukulti-Ninurta I of Assyria after c. 1225 BC.

==Population==
Uruk, one of Sumer&#x27;s largest cities, has been estimated to have had a population of 50,000–80,000 at its height. Given the other cities in Sumer, and the large agricultural population, a rough estimate for Sumer&#x27;s population might be 0.8 million to 1.5 million. The world population at this time has been estimated at 27 million.
The Sumerians spoke a language isolate. A number of linguists have claimed to be able to detect a substrate language of unknown classification beneath Sumerian, because names of some of Sumer&#x27;s major cities are not Sumerian, revealing influences of earlier inhabitants. However, the archaeological record shows clear uninterrupted cultural continuity from the time of the early Ubaid period (5300–4700 BC C-14) settlements in southern Mesopotamia. The Sumerian people who settled here, farmed the lands in this region that were made fertile by silt deposited by the Tigris and the Euphrates.

Some archaeologists have speculated that the original speakers of ancient Sumerian may have been farmers, who moved down from the north of Mesopotamia after perfecting irrigation agriculture there. The Ubaid period pottery of southern Mesopotamia has been connected via Choga Mami transitional ware, to the pottery of the Samarra period culture (–4900 BC C-14) in the north, who were the first to practice a primitive form of irrigation agriculture along the middle Tigris River and its tributaries. The connection is most clearly seen at Tell el-&#x27;Oueili near Larsa, excavated by the French in the 1980s, where eight levels yielded pre-Ubaid pottery resembling Samarran ware. According to this theory, farming peoples spread down into southern Mesopotamia because they had developed a temple-centered social organization for mobilizing labor and technology for water control, enabling them to survive and prosper in a difficult environment.

Others have suggested a continuity of Sumerians, from the indigenous hunter-fisherfolk traditions, associated with the bifacial assemblages found on the Arabian littoral. Juris Zarins believes the Sumerians may have been the people living in the Persian Gulf region before it flooded at the end of the last Ice Age.

==Culture==
===Social and family life===

In the early Sumerian period, the primitive pictograms suggest that
* &quot;Pottery was very plentiful, and the forms of the vases, bowls and dishes were manifold; there were special jars for honey, butter, oil and wine, which was probably made from dates. Some of the vases had pointed feet, and stood on stands with crossed legs; others were flat-bottomed, and were set on square or rectangular frames of wood. The oil-jars, and probably others also, were sealed with clay, precisely as in early Egypt. Vases and dishes of stone were made in imitation of those of clay.&quot;
* &quot;A feathered head-dress was worn. Beds, stools and chairs were used, with carved legs resembling those of an ox. There were fire-places and fire-altars.&quot;
* &quot;Knives, drills, wedges and an instrument that looks like a saw were all known. While spears, bows, arrows, and daggers (but not swords) were employed in war.&quot;
* &quot;Tablets were used for writing purposes. Daggers with metal blades and wooden handles were worn, and copper was hammered into plates, while necklaces or collars were made of gold.&quot;
* &quot;Time was reckoned in lunar months.&quot;

There is considerable evidence concerning Sumerian music. Lyres and flutes were played, among the best-known examples being the Lyres of Ur.

Sumerian culture was male-dominated and stratified. The Code of Ur-Nammu, the oldest such codification yet discovered, dating to the Ur III, reveals a glimpse at societal structure in late Sumerian law. Beneath the &quot;lu-gal&quot; (&quot;great man&quot; or king), all members of society belonged to one of two basic strata: The &quot;lu&quot; or free person, and the slave (male, &quot;arad&quot;; female &quot;geme&quot;). The son of a &quot;lu&quot; was called a &quot;dumu-nita&quot; until he married. A woman (&quot;munus&quot;) went from being a daughter (&quot;dumu-mi&quot;), to a wife (&quot;dam&quot;), then if she outlived her husband, a widow (&quot;numasu&quot;) and she could then remarry another man who was from the same tribe.

In early Sumer women played an important public rule as priestesses. They could also own property, transact business and had their rights protected by the courts. Sons and daughters inherited property on equal terms. The status of women deteriorated in the centuries after 2300 BC. Their right to dispose of their property was limited, and the female deities also lost their former importance.

Inscriptions describing the reforms of king Urukagina of Lagash () say that he abolished the former custom of polyandry in his country, prescribing that a woman who took multiple husbands be stoned with rocks upon which her crime had been written.
Marriages were usually arranged by the parents of the bride and groom; engagements were usually completed through the approval of contracts recorded on clay tablets. These marriages became legal as soon as the groom delivered a bridal gift to his bride&#x27;s father. One Sumerian proverb describes the ideal, happy marriage, through the mouth of a husband, who boasts that his wife has borne him eight sons and is still eager to have sex.

The Sumerians considered it desirable for women to still be virgins at the time of marriage, but did not expect the same of men, although one author considers premarital sex in general to have been discouraged. Neither Sumerian nor Akkadian had a word exactly corresponding to the English word &#x27;virginity&#x27;, and the concept was expressed descriptively, for example as &quot;a/é-nu-gi4-a&quot; (Sum.)/&quot;la naqbat&quot; (Akk.) &#x27;un-deflowered&#x27;, or &quot;giš nunzua&quot;, &#x27;never having known a penis&#x27;. It is unclear whether terms such as &quot;šišitu&quot; in Akkadian medical texts indicate the hymen, but it appears that the intactness of the hymen was much less relevant to assessing a woman&#x27;s virginity than in later cultures of the Near East. Most assessments of virginity depended on the woman&#x27;s own account.

From the earliest records, the Sumerians had very relaxed attitudes toward sex. Their sexual mores were determined not by whether a sexual act was deemed immoral, but rather by whether or not it made a person ritually unclean. The Sumerians widely believed that masturbation enhanced sexual potency, both for men and for women, and they frequently engaged in it, both alone and with their partners. The Sumerians did not regard anal sex as taboo either. &quot;Entu&quot; priestesses were forbidden from producing offspring and frequently engaged in anal sex as a method of birth control.

Prostitution existed, but it is not clear if sacred prostitution did.

===Language and writing===
The most important archaeological discoveries in Sumer are a large number of clay tablets written in cuneiform script. Sumerian writing is considered to be a great milestone in the development of humanity&#x27;s ability to not only create historical records but also in creating pieces of literature, both in the form of poetic epics and stories as well as prayers and laws.

Although the writing system was first hieroglyphic using ideograms, logosyllabic cuneiform soon followed.

Triangular or wedge-shaped reeds were used to write on moist clay. A large body of hundreds of thousands of texts in the Sumerian language have survived, including personal and business letters, receipts, lexical lists, laws, hymns, prayers, stories, and daily records. Full libraries of clay tablets have been found. Monumental inscriptions and texts on different objects, like statues or bricks, are also very common. Many texts survive in multiple copies because they were repeatedly transcribed by scribes in training. Sumerian continued to be the language of religion and law in Mesopotamia long after Semitic speakers had become dominant.

A prime example of cuneiform writing is a lengthy poem that was discovered in the ruins of Uruk. The &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot; was written in the standard Sumerian cuneiform. It tells of a king from the early Dynastic II period named Gilgamesh or &quot;Bilgamesh&quot; in Sumerian. The story relates the fictional adventures of Gilgamesh and his companion, Enkidu. It was laid out on several clay tablets and is thought to be the earliest known surviving example of fictional literature.

The Sumerian language is generally regarded as a language isolate in linguistics, because it belongs to no known language family. Akkadian, by contrast, belongs to the Semitic branch of the Afroasiatic languages. There have been many failed attempts to connect Sumerian to other language families. It is an agglutinative language. In other words, morphemes (&quot;units of meaning&quot;) are added together to create words, unlike analytic languages where morphemes are purely added together to create sentences. Some authors have proposed that there may be evidence of a substratum or adstratum language for geographic features and various crafts and agricultural activities, called variously Proto-Euphratean or Proto Tigrean, but this is disputed by others.

Understanding Sumerian texts today can be problematic. Most difficult are the earliest texts, which in many cases do not give the full grammatical structure of the language and seem to have been used as an &quot;aide-mémoire&quot; for knowledgeable scribes.

Akkadian gradually replaced Sumerian as a spoken language somewhere around the turn of the 3rd and the 2nd millennium BC. Sumerian continued to be used as a sacred, ceremonial, literary, and scientific language in Babylonia and Assyria until the 1st century AD.
===Religion===
The Sumerians credited their divinities for all matters pertaining to them and exhibited humility in the face of cosmic forces, such as death and divine wrath.

Sumerian religion seems to have been founded upon two separate cosmogenic myths. The first saw creation as the result of a series of &quot;hieroi gamoi&quot; or sacred marriages, involving the reconciliation of opposites, postulated as a coming together of male and female divine beings, the gods.

This pattern continued to influence regional Mesopotamian myths. Thus, in the later Akkadian Enuma Elish, creation was seen as the union of fresh and salt water, between male Abzu, and female Tiamat. The products of that union, Lahm and Lahmu, &quot;the muddy ones&quot;, were titles given to the gate keepers of the E-Abzu temple of Enki in Eridu, the first Sumerian city.

Mirroring the way that muddy islands emerge from the confluence of fresh and salty water at the mouth of the Euphrates, where the river deposits its load of silt, a second hieros gamos supposedly resulted in the creation of Anshar and Kishar, the &quot;sky-pivot&quot; (or axle), and the &quot;earth pivot&quot;, parents in turn of Anu (the sky) and Ki (the earth).

Another important Sumerian hieros gamos was that between Ki, here known as Ninhursag or &quot;Lady of the Mountains&quot;, and Enki of Eridu, the god of fresh water which brought forth greenery and pasture.

At an early stage, following the dawn of recorded history, Nippur, in central Mesopotamia, replaced Eridu in the south as the primary temple city, whose priests exercised political hegemony on the other city-states. Nippur retained this status throughout the Sumerian period.

====Deities====

Sumerians believed in an anthropomorphic polytheism, or the belief in many gods in human form. There was no common set of gods; each city-state had its own patrons, temples, and priest-kings. Nonetheless, these were not exclusive; the gods of one city were often acknowledged elsewhere. Sumerian speakers were among the earliest people to record their beliefs in writing, and were a major inspiration in later Mesopotamian mythology, religion, and astrology.

The Sumerians worshiped:
* An as the full-time god equivalent to heaven; indeed, the word &quot;an&quot; in Sumerian means sky and his consort Ki, means earth.
* Enki in the south at the temple in Eridu. Enki was the god of beneficence and of wisdom, ruler of the freshwater depths beneath the earth, a healer and friend to humanity who in Sumerian myth was thought to have given humans the arts and sciences, the industries and manners of civilization; the first law book was considered his creation.
* Enlil was the god of storm, wind, and rain. He was the chief god of the Sumerian pantheon and the patron god of Nippur. His consort was Ninlil, the goddess of the south wind.
* Inanna was the goddess of love, sexuality, and war; the deification of Venus, the morning (eastern) and evening (western) star, at the temple (shared with An) at Uruk. Deified kings may have re-enacted the marriage of Inanna and Dumuzid with priestesses.
* The sun-god Utu at Larsa in the south and Sippar in the north,
* The moon god Sin at Ur.

These deities formed the main pantheon, and in addition to this there were hundreds of other minor gods. Sumerian gods were often associated with different cities, and their religious importance often waxed and waned with those cities&#x27; political power. The gods were said to have created human beings from clay for the purpose of serving them. The temples organized the mass labour projects needed for irrigation agriculture. Citizens had a labor duty to the temple, though they could avoid it by a payment of silver.

====Cosmology====
Sumerians envisioned Earth to be a rectangular field with four corners. The Sumerian afterlife involved a descent into a gloomy netherworld to spend eternity in a wretched existence as a Gidim (ghost).

The universe was divided into four quarters:
* To the north were the hill-dwelling Subartu, who were periodically raided for slaves, timber, and other raw materials.
* To the west were the tent-dwelling Martu, ancient Semitic-speaking peoples living as pastoral nomads tending herds of sheep and goats.
* To the south was the land of Dilmun, a trading state associated with the land of the dead and the place of creation.
* To the east were the Elamites, a rival people with whom the Sumerians were frequently at war.

Their known world extended from &quot;The Upper Sea&quot; or Mediterranean coastline, to &quot;The Lower Sea&quot;, the Persian Gulf and the land of Meluhha (probably the Indus Valley) and Magan (Oman), famed for its copper ores.

====Temple and temple organisation====
Ziggurats (Sumerian temples) each had an individual name and consisted of a forecourt, with a central pond for purification. The temple itself had a central nave with aisles along either side. Flanking the aisles would be rooms for the priests. At one end would stand the podium and a mudbrick table for animal and vegetable sacrifices. Granaries and storehouses were usually located near the temples. After a time the Sumerians began to place the temples on top of multi-layered square constructions built as a series of rising terraces, giving rise to the Ziggurat style.

====Funerary practices====
It was believed that when people died, they would be confined to a gloomy world of Ereshkigal, whose realm was guarded by gateways with various monsters designed to prevent people entering or leaving. The dead were buried outside the city walls in graveyards where a small mound covered the corpse, along with offerings to monsters and a small amount of food. Those who could afford it sought burial at Dilmun. Human sacrifice was found in the death pits at the Ur royal cemetery where Queen Puabi was accompanied in death by her servants.

===Agriculture and hunting===
The Sumerians adopted an agricultural lifestyle perhaps as early as –4500 BC. The region demonstrated a number of core agricultural techniques, including organized irrigation, large-scale intensive cultivation of land, monocropping involving the use of plough agriculture, and the use of an agricultural specialized labour force under bureaucratic control. The necessity to manage temple accounts with this organization led to the development of writing (c. 3500 BC).

In the early Sumerian Uruk period, the primitive pictograms suggest that sheep, goats, cattle, and pigs were domesticated. They used oxen as their primary beasts of burden and donkeys or equids as their primary transport animal and &quot;woollen clothing as well as rugs were made from the wool or hair of the animals. ... By the side of the house was an enclosed garden planted with trees and other plants; wheat and probably other cereals were sown in the fields, and the &quot;shaduf&quot; was already employed for the purpose of irrigation. Plants were also grown in pots or vases.&quot;

The Sumerians were one of the first known beer-drinking societies. Cereals were plentiful and were the key ingredient in their early brew. They brewed multiple kinds of beer consisting of wheat, barley, and mixed grain beers. Beer brewing was very important to the Sumerians. It was referenced in the Epic of Gilgamesh when Enkidu was introduced to the food and beer of Gilgamesh&#x27;s people: &quot;Drink the beer, as is the custom of the land... He drank the beer-seven jugs! and became expansive and sang with joy!&quot;

The Sumerians practiced similar irrigation techniques as those used in Egypt. American anthropologist Robert McCormick Adams says that irrigation development was associated with urbanization, and that 89% of the population lived in the cities.

They grew barley, chickpeas, lentils, wheat, dates, onions, garlic, lettuce, leeks and mustard. Sumerians caught many fish and hunted fowl and gazelle.

Sumerian agriculture depended heavily on irrigation. The irrigation was accomplished by the use of &quot;shaduf&quot;, canals, channels, dykes, weirs, and reservoirs. The frequent violent floods of the Tigris, and less so, of the Euphrates, meant that canals required frequent repair and continual removal of silt, and survey markers and boundary stones needed to be continually replaced. The government required individuals to work on the canals in a corvée, although the rich were able to exempt themselves.

As is known from the &quot;Sumerian Farmer&#x27;s Almanac&quot;, after the flood season and after the Spring equinox and the &quot;Akitu&quot; or New Year Festival, using the canals, farmers would flood their fields and then drain the water. Next they made oxen stomp the ground and kill weeds. They then dragged the fields with pickaxes. After drying, they plowed, harrowed, and raked the ground three times, and pulverized it with a mattock, before planting seed. Unfortunately, the high evaporation rate resulted in a gradual increase in the salinity of the fields. By the Ur III period, farmers had switched from wheat to the more salt-tolerant barley as their principal crop.

Sumerians harvested during the spring in three-person teams consisting of a reaper, a binder, and a sheaf handler. The farmers would use threshing wagons, driven by oxen, to separate the cereal heads from the stalks and then use threshing sleds to disengage the grain. They then winnowed the grain/chaff mixture.

===Art===
The Sumerians were great artists. Sumerian artefacts show great detail and ornamentation, with fine semi-precious stones imported from other lands, such as lapis lazuli, marble, and diorite, and precious metals like hammered gold, incorporated into the design. Since stone was rare it was reserved for sculpture. The most widespread material in Sumer was clay, as a result many Sumerian objects are made of clay. Metals such as gold, silver, copper, and bronze, along with shells and gemstones, were used for the finest sculptures and inlays. Small stones of all kinds, including more precious stones such as lapis lazuli, alabaster, and serpentine, were used for cylinder seals.

Some of the most famous masterpieces are the Lyres of Ur, which are considered to be the world&#x27;s oldest surviving stringed instruments. They were discovered by Leonard Woolley when the Royal Cemetery of Ur was excavated between 1922 and 1934.
===Architecture===

The Tigris-Euphrates plain lacked minerals and trees. Sumerian structures were made of plano-convex mudbrick, not fixed with mortar or cement. Mud-brick buildings eventually deteriorate, so they were periodically destroyed, leveled, and rebuilt on the same spot. This constant rebuilding gradually raised the level of cities, which thus came to be elevated above the surrounding plain. The resultant hills, known as tells, are found throughout the ancient Near East.

According to Archibald Sayce, the primitive pictograms of the early Sumerian (i.e. Uruk) era suggest that &quot;Stone was scarce, but was already cut into blocks and seals. Brick was the ordinary building material, and with it cities, forts, temples and houses were constructed. The city was provided with towers and stood on an artificial platform; the house also had a tower-like appearance. It was provided with a door which turned on a hinge, and could be opened with a sort of key; the city gate was on a larger scale, and seems to have been double. The foundation stones—or rather bricks—of a house were consecrated by certain objects that were deposited under them.&quot;

The most impressive and famous of Sumerian buildings are the ziggurats, large layered platforms that supported temples. Sumerian cylinder seals also depict houses built from reeds not unlike those built by the Marsh Arabs of Southern Iraq until as recently as 400 CE. The Sumerians also developed the arch, which enabled them to develop a strong type of dome. They built this by constructing and linking several arches. Sumerian temples and palaces made use of more advanced materials and techniques, such as buttresses, recesses, half columns, and clay nails.

===Mathematics===
The Sumerians developed a complex system of metrology c. 4000 BC. This advanced metrology resulted in the creation of arithmetic, geometry, and algebra. From c. 2600 BC onwards, the Sumerians wrote multiplication tables on clay tablets and dealt with geometrical exercises and division problems. The earliest traces of the Babylonian numerals also date back to this period. The period c. 2700–2300 BC saw the first appearance of the abacus, and a table of successive columns which delimited the successive orders of magnitude of their sexagesimal number system. The Sumerians were the first to use a place value numeral system. There is also anecdotal evidence the Sumerians may have used a type of slide rule in astronomical calculations. They were the first to find the area of a triangle and the volume of a cube.

===Economy and trade===

Discoveries of obsidian from far-away locations in Anatolia and lapis lazuli from Badakhshan in northeastern Afghanistan, beads from Dilmun (modern Bahrain), and several seals inscribed with the Indus Valley script suggest a remarkably wide-ranging network of ancient trade centered on the Persian Gulf. For example, Imports to Ur came from many parts of the world. In particular, the metals of all types had to be imported.

The &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot; refers to trade with far lands for goods, such as wood, that were scarce in Mesopotamia. In particular, cedar from Lebanon was prized. The finding of resin in the tomb of Queen Puabi at Ur, indicates it was traded from as far away as Mozambique.

The Sumerians used slaves, although they were not a major part of the economy. Slave women worked as weavers, pressers, millers, and porters.

Sumerian potters decorated pots with cedar oil paints. The potters used a bow drill to produce the fire needed for baking the pottery. Sumerian masons and jewelers knew and made use of alabaster (calcite), ivory, iron, gold, silver, carnelian, and lapis lazuli.

====Trade with the Indus valley====

Evidence for imports from the Indus to Ur can be found from around 2350 BC. Various objects made with shell species that are characteristic of the Indus coast, particularly &quot;Turbinella pyrum&quot; and &quot;Pleuroploca trapezium&quot;, have been found in the archaeological sites of Mesopotamia dating from around 2500–2000 BC. Carnelian beads from the Indus were found in the Sumerian tombs of Ur, the Royal Cemetery at Ur, dating to 2600–2450. In particular, carnelian beads with an etched design in white were probably imported from the Indus Valley, and made according to a technique of acid-etching developed by the Harappans. Lapis lazuli was imported in great quantity by Egypt, and already used in many tombs of the Naqada II period (c. 3200 BC). Lapis lazuli probably originated in northern Afghanistan, as no other sources are known, and had to be transported across the Iranian plateau to Mesopotamia, and then Egypt.

Several Indus seals with Harappan script have also been found in Mesopotamia, particularly in Ur, Babylon and Kish.

Gudea, the ruler of the Neo-Summerian Empire at Lagash, is recorded as having imported &quot;translucent carnelian&quot; from Meluhha, generally thought to be the Indus Valley area. Various inscriptions also mention the presence of Meluhha traders and interpreters in Mesopotamia. About twenty seals have been found from the Akkadian and Ur III sites, that have connections with Harappa and often use Harappan symbols or writing.

The Indus Valley Civilization only flourished in its most developed form between 2400 and 1800 BC, but at the time of these exchanges, it was a much larger entity than the Mesopotamian civilization, covering an area of 1.2 million square kilometers with thousands of settlements, compared to an area of only about 65.000 square kilometers for the occupied area of Mesopotamia, while the largest cities were comparable in size at about 30–40,000 inhabitants.

====Money and credit====
Large institutions kept their accounts in barley and silver, often with a fixed rate between them. The obligations, loans and prices in general were usually denominated in one of them. Many transactions involved debt, for example goods consigned to merchants by temple and beer advanced by &quot;ale women&quot;.

Commercial credit and agricultural consumer loans were the main types of loans. The trade credit was usually extended by temples in order to finance trade expeditions and was nominated in silver. The interest rate was set at 1/60 a month (one shekel per mina) some time before 2000 BC and it remained at that level for about two thousand years.
Rural loans commonly arose as a result of unpaid obligations due to an institution (such as a temple), in this case the arrears were considered to be lent to the debtor. They were denominated in barley or other crops and the interest rate was typically much higher than for commercial loans and could amount to 1/3 to 1/2 of the loan principal.

Periodically, rulers signed &quot;clean slate&quot; decrees that cancelled all the rural (but not commercial) debt and allowed bondservants to return to their homes. Customarily, rulers did it at the beginning of the first full year of their reign, but they could also be proclaimed at times of military conflict or crop failure. The first known ones were made by Enmetena and Urukagina of Lagash in 2400–2350 BC. According to Hudson, the purpose of these decrees was to prevent debts mounting to a degree that they threatened the fighting force, which could happen if peasants lost their subsistence land or became bondservants due to inability to repay their debt.

===Military===

The almost constant wars among the Sumerian city-states for 2000 years helped to develop the military technology and techniques of Sumer to a high level. The first war recorded in any detail was between Lagash and Umma in c. 2450 BC on a stele called the Stele of the Vultures. It shows the king of Lagash leading a Sumerian army consisting mostly of infantry. The infantry carried spears, wore copper helmets, and carried rectangular shields. The spearmen are shown arranged in what resembles the phalanx formation, which requires training and discipline; this implies that the Sumerians may have used professional soldiers.

The Sumerian military used carts harnessed to onagers. These early chariots functioned less effectively in combat than did later designs, and some have suggested that these chariots served primarily as transports, though the crew carried battle-axes and lances. The Sumerian chariot comprised a four or two-wheeled device manned by a crew of two and harnessed to four onagers. The cart was composed of a woven basket and the wheels had a solid three-piece design.

Sumerian cities were surrounded by defensive walls. The Sumerians engaged in siege warfare between their cities, but the mudbrick walls were able to deter some foes.

===Technology===
Examples of Sumerian technology include: the wheel, cuneiform script, arithmetic and geometry, irrigation systems, Sumerian boats, lunisolar calendar, bronze, leather, saws, chisels, hammers, braces, bits, nails, pins, rings, hoes, axes, knives, lancepoints, arrowheads, swords, glue, daggers, waterskins, bags, harnesses, armor, quivers, war chariots, scabbards, boots, sandals, harpoons and beer.
The Sumerians had three main types of boats:
* clinker-built sailboats stitched together with hair, featuring bitumen waterproofing
* skin boats constructed from animal skins and reeds
* wooden-oared ships, sometimes pulled upstream by people and animals walking along the nearby banks

==Legacy==

Evidence of wheeled vehicles appeared in the mid-4th millennium BC, near-simultaneously in Mesopotamia, the Northern Caucasus (Maykop culture) and Central Europe. The wheel initially took the form of the potter&#x27;s wheel. The new concept led to wheeled vehicles and mill wheels. The Sumerians&#x27; cuneiform script is the oldest (or second oldest after the Egyptian hieroglyphs) which has been deciphered (the status of even older inscriptions such as the Jiahu symbols and Tartaria tablets is controversial). The Sumerians were among the first astronomers, mapping the stars into sets of constellations, many of which survived in the zodiac and were also recognized by the ancient Greeks. They were also aware of the five planets that are easily visible to the naked eye.

They invented and developed arithmetic by using several different number systems including a mixed radix system with an alternating base 10 and base 6. This sexagesimal system became the standard number system in Sumer and Babylonia. They may have invented military formations and introduced the basic divisions between infantry, cavalry, and archers. They developed the first known codified legal and administrative systems, complete with courts, jails, and government records.

The first true city-states arose in Sumer, roughly contemporaneously with similar entities in what are now Syria and Lebanon. Several centuries after the invention of cuneiform, the use of writing expanded beyond debt/payment certificates and inventory lists to be applied for the first time, about 2600 BC, to messages and mail delivery, history, legend, mathematics, astronomical records, and other pursuits. Conjointly with the spread of writing, the first formal schools were established, usually under the auspices of a city-state&#x27;s primary temple.

<text>A melanocytic nevus (also known as nevocytic nevus, nevus-cell nevus, and commonly as a mole) is usually a noncancerous condition of pigment-producing skin cells. It is a type of melanocytic tumor that contains nevus cells. A mole can be either subdermal (under the skin) or a pigmented growth on the skin, formed mostly of a type of cell known as a melanocyte. The high concentration of the body&#x27;s pigmenting agent, melanin, is responsible for their dark color. Moles are a member of the family of skin lesions known as nevi (singular &quot;nevus&quot;), occurring commonly in humans. Some sources equate the term &quot;mole&quot; with &quot;melanocytic nevus&quot;, but there are also sources that equate the term &quot;mole&quot; with any nevus form.

The majority of moles appear during the first 2 decades of a person&#x27;s life, with about 1 in every 100 babies being born with moles. Acquired moles are a form of benign neoplasm, while congenital moles, or congenital nevi, are considered a minor malformation or hamartoma and may be at a higher risk for melanoma.

==Signs and symptoms==

According to the American Academy of Dermatology, the most common types of moles are skin tags, raised moles, and flat moles. Benign moles are usually brown, tan, pink, or black (the latter especially on dark-colored skin). They are circular or oval and are usually small (commonly between 1–3 mm), though some can be larger than the size of a typical pencil eraser (&gt;5 mm). Some moles produce dark, coarse hair. Common mole hair removal procedures include plucking, cosmetic waxing, electrolysis, threading, and cauterization.

===Aging===
Moles tend to appear during early childhood and during the first 30 years of life. They may change slowly, becoming raised, changing color, or gradually fading. Most people have between 30 and 40 moles, but some have as many as 600.

The number of moles a person has was found to have a correlation with telomere length. However, the relation between telomeres and aging remains uncertain.

===Complications===
The American Academy of Dermatology says that the vast majority of moles are benign. Data on the chances of transformation from melanocytic nevus to melanoma is controversial, but it appears that about 10% of malignant melanomas have a precursor lesion, of which about 10% are melanocytic nevi. Therefore, it appears that malignant melanoma quite seldom (1% of cases) has a melanocytic nevus as a precursor.

==Cause==
The cause of this condition is not clearly understood, but it is thought to result from a defect in embryologic development during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. The defect is thought to cause a proliferation of melanocytes, the cells responsible for normal skin color. When melanocytes are produced at an extremely rapid rate, they form in clusters instead of spreading out evenly, resulting in abnormal skin pigmentation in some areas of the body.

===Genetics===
Genes can influence a person&#x27;s moles.

Dysplastic nevus syndrome is a largely hereditary condition that causes a person to have a large quantity of moles (often 100 or more), with some larger than normal or atypical. This often leads to a higher risk of melanoma, a serious type of skin cancer. Dysplastic nevi are more likely than ordinary moles to become cancerous. While dysplastic nevi are common and many people have a few of these abnormal moles, having more than 50 ordinary moles also increases the risk of developing melanoma.

In the general population, a slight majority of melanomas do not form in existing moles but rather create new growths on the skin. Somewhat surprisingly, this pattern also applies to those with dysplastic nevi. These individuals are at a higher risk of melanoma occurring not only where there is an existing mole but also in areas without moles. Consequently, such persons need regular examinations to check for changes in their moles and to identify any new ones.

===Sunlight===
Ultraviolet (UV) light from the sun causes premature aging of the skin and skin damage that can lead to melanoma. Researchers hypothesized that overexposure to UV, including excessive sunlight, may play a role in the formation of acquired moles. However, more research is needed to determine the complex interaction between genetic makeup and overall UV exposure. Some strong indications supporting this hypothesis (but falling short of proof) include:
*The relative lack of moles on the buttocks of people with dysplastic nevi
*The known influence of sunlight on freckles (spots of melanin on the skin, distinct from moles)

Studies have found that sunburns and excessive sun exposure can increase risk factors for melanoma. This is in addition to the higher risk already faced by individuals with dysplastic nevi (the uncertainty is in regards to acquiring benign moles). To prevent and reduce the risk of melanoma caused by UV radiation, the American Academy of Dermatology and the National Cancer Institute recommend:

* Staying out of the sun between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. standard time (or whenever one&#x27;s shadow is shorter than one&#x27;s height)
* Wearing long sleeves and trousers
* Wearing hats with a wide brim
* Applying sunscreens
* Wearing sunglasses that have UV-deflecting lenses

==Diagnosis==

Clinical diagnosis can be made with the naked eye using the ABCD guideline or by using dermatoscopy. An online-screening test is also available to help screen out benign moles.

===Classification===
Melanocytic nevi can mainly be classified by depth, being congenital versus acquired, and/or specific dermatoscopy or histopathology patterns:
;Depth:

;Congenital versus acquired
*Congenital nevus: Small to large nevus present at or near time of birth. Small ones have low potential for forming melanomas, however the risk increases with size, as in the giant pigmented nevus.
*Acquired nevus: Any melanocytic nevus that is not a congenital nevus or not present at birth or near birth.
Specific dermatoscopy or histopathology patterns 
;Recurrence
Recurrent nevus: Any incompletely removed nevus with residual melanocytes left in the surgical wound. It creates a dilemma for the patient and physician, as these scars cannot be distinguished from a melanoma.

===Differentiation from melanoma===
It often requires a dermatologist to fully evaluate moles. For instance, a small blue or bluish-black spot, often called a blue nevus, is usually benign but often mistaken for melanoma. Conversely, a junctional nevus, which develops at the junction of the dermis and epidermis, is potentially cancerous.

A basic reference chart used for consumers to spot suspicious moles is found in the mnemonic A-B-C-D, used by institutions such as the American Academy of Dermatology and the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The letters stand for asymmetry, border, color, and diameter. Sometimes, the letter E (for elevation or evolving) is added. According to the American Academy of Dermatology, if a mole starts changing in size, color, shape or, especially, if the border of a mole develops ragged edges or becomes larger than a pencil eraser, it would be an appropriate time to consult with a physician. Other warning signs include a mole, even if smaller than a pencil eraser, that is different from the others and begins to crust over, bleed, itch, or become inflamed. The changes may indicate developing melanomas. The matter can become clinically complicated because mole removal depends on which types of cancer, if any, come into suspicion.

A recent and novel method of melanoma detection is the &quot;ugly duckling sign&quot; It is simple, easy to teach, and highly effective in detecting melanoma. Simply, correlation of common characteristics of a person&#x27;s skin lesion is made. Lesions which greatly deviate from the common characteristics are labeled as an &quot;ugly duckling&quot;, and further professional exam is required. The &quot;little red riding hood sign&quot;, suggests that individuals with fair skin and light colored hair might have difficult-to-diagnose melanomas. Extra care and caution should be rendered when examining such individuals as they might have multiple melanomas and severely dysplastic nevi. A dermatoscope must be used to detect &quot;ugly ducklings&quot;, as many melanomas in these individuals resemble non-melanomas or are considered to be &quot;wolves in sheep clothing&quot;. These fair skinned individuals often have lightly pigmented or amelanotic melanomas which will not present easy-to-observe color changes and variation in colors. The borders of these amelanotic melanomas are often indistinct, making visual identification without a dermatoscope very difficult.

People with a personal or family history of skin cancer or of dysplastic nevus syndrome (multiple atypical moles) should see a dermatologist at least once a year to be sure they are not developing melanoma.

==Management==

First, a diagnosis must be made. If the lesion is a seborrheic keratosis, then shave excision, electrodesiccation, or cryosurgery may be performed, usually leaving very little, if any scarring. If the lesion is suspected to be skin cancer, a skin biopsy must be done before considering removal. This is unless an excisional biopsy is warranted. If the lesion is a melanocytic nevus, one has to decide if it is medically indicated or not. Other reasons for removal may be cosmetic or because a raised mole interferes with daily life (e.g., shaving).

If a melanocytic nevus is suspected of being a melanoma, it needs to be sampled or removed via skin biopsy, and sent for microscopic evaluation by a pathologist. Depending on the size and location of the original nevus, a complete excisional skin biopsy or a punch skin biopsy can be done. Removal can also occur by shaving. Shaving leaves a red mark on the site but changes to the patient&#x27;s usual skin color in about 2 weeks. However, there might still be a risk of spread of the melanoma, so the methods of melanoma diagnosis, including excisional biopsy, are still recommended even in these instances. Moles can also be removed by laser, surgery, or electrocautery.

In properly trained hands, some medical lasers are used to remove flat moles level with the surface of the skin, as well as some raised moles. While laser treatment is commonly offered and may require several appointments, other dermatologists think lasers are not the best method for removing moles because the laser only cauterizes or, in certain cases, removes very superficial levels of skin. Moles tend to go deeper into the skin than non-invasive lasers can penetrate. After a laser treatment, a scab is formed, which falls off about 7 days later, in contrast to surgery, where the wound has to be sutured. A second concern about the laser treatment is that if the lesion is a melanoma, and was misdiagnosed as a benign mole, the procedure might delay diagnosis. If the mole is incompletely removed by the laser, and the pigmented lesion regrows, it might form a recurrent nevus.

For surgery, many dermatologic and plastic surgeons first use a freezing solution, usually liquid nitrogen, on a raised mole and then shave it away with a scalpel. If the surgeon opts for the shaving method, he or she usually also cauterizes the stump. Because a circle is difficult to close with stitches, the incision is usually elliptical or eye-shaped. However, freezing should not be done to a nevus suspected to be a melanoma, as the ice crystals can cause pathological changes called &quot;freezing artifacts&quot; which might interfere with the diagnosis of the melanoma.

Electrocautery is available as an alternative to laser cautery. Electrocautery is a procedure that uses a light electrical current to burn moles, skin tags, and warts off the skin. Electric currents are set to a level such that they only reach the outermost layers of the skin, thus reducing the problem of scarring. Approximately 1–3 treatments may be needed to completely remove a mole. Typically, a local anesthetic is applied to the treated skin area before beginning the mole removal procedure.

===Mole removal risks===
The risks of mole removal mainly depend on the type of method used. First, mole removal may be followed by some discomfort that can be relieved with pain medication. Second, there is a risk that a scab will form or that redness will occur. However, such scabs and redness usually heal within 1 or 2 weeks. Third, similar to other surgeries, there is also risk of infection, allergic reactions to anesthesia, or even nerve damage. Lastly, the mole removal may leave an uncomfortable scar depending on the mole size.

==Society and culture==

Throughout human history, individuals who have possessed facial moles have been subject to ridicule and attack based on superstition. Throughout most of history, facial moles were not considered objects of beauty on lovely faces. Rather, most moles were considered hideous growths that appeared mostly on the noses, cheeks, and chins of witches, frogs, and other low creatures.

During the Salem witch trials, warts and other dermatological lesions such as moles, scars, and other blemishes, found on accused women were considered evidence of a pact with the devil.

===Face mole reading===
In traditional Chinese culture, facial moles are used in moleomancy, or face mole reading. Moles that can be easily seen may be considered warnings or reminders, while hidden moles may symbolize good luck and fortune. Furthermore, traditional Chinese culture holds that each facial mole indicates the presence of a corresponding mole on another part of the body. For instance, if a mole is present around the mouth, a corresponding mole should be found in the pubic region.

<doc id="50526" wikidata="Q104190" url="?curid=50526" title="Robert Walpole">
<text>Robert Walpole, 1st Earl of Orford (26 August 1676 – 18 March 1745), known between 1725 and 1742 as Sir Robert Walpole, was a British Whig politician who served as Prime Minister of Great Britain from 1721 to 1742. He also served as First Lord of the Treasury, Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Leader of the House of Commons, and is generally regarded as the &quot;de facto&quot; first prime minister of Great Britain.

Although the exact dates of Walpole&#x27;s dominance, dubbed the &quot;Robinocracy&quot;, are a matter of scholarly debate, the period 1721–1742 is often used. He dominated the Walpole–Townshend ministry, as well as the subsequent Walpole ministry, and holds the record as the longest-serving British prime minister. W. A. Speck wrote that Walpole&#x27;s uninterrupted run of 20 years as prime minister &quot;is rightly regarded as one of the major feats of British political history. Explanations are usually offered in terms of his expert handling of the political system after 1720, [and] his unique blending of the surviving powers of the crown with the increasing influence of the Commons&quot;.

Walpole was a Whig from the gentry class who was first elected to Parliament in 1701 and held many senior positions. He was a country squire and looked to country gentlemen for his political base. Historian F. O&#x27;Gorman says his leadership in Parliament reflected his &quot;reasonable and persuasive oratory, his ability to move both the emotions as well as the minds of men, and, above all, his extraordinary self-confidence&quot;. Hoppit says Walpole&#x27;s policies sought moderation, he worked for peace, lower taxes and growing exports, and allowed a little more tolerance for Protestant Dissenters. He mostly avoided controversy and high-intensity disputes as his middle way attracted moderates from both the Whig and Tory camps; his appointment to Chancellor of the Exchequer after the South Sea Bubble stock-market crisis drew attention to perceived protection of political allies by Walpole.

Historian H. T. Dickinson sums up his historical role by saying that &quot;Walpole was one of the greatest politicians in British history. He played a significant role in sustaining the Whig party, safeguarding the Hanoverian succession, and defending the principles of the Glorious Revolution (1688). He established stable political supremacy for the Whig party and taught succeeding ministers how best to establish an effective working relationship between Crown and Parliament.&quot; Some scholars rank him highly among British prime ministers.

==Early life ==
Walpole was born in Houghton, Norfolk, in 1676. One of 19 children, he was the third son and fifth child of Robert Walpole, a member of the local gentry and a Whig politician who represented the borough of Castle Rising in the House of Commons. His wife Mary Burwell was the daughter and heiress of Sir Geoffrey Burwell of Rougham, Suffolk. Horatio Walpole, 1st Baron Walpole, was his younger brother.

As a child, Walpole attended a private school at Massingham, Norfolk. Walpole entered Eton College in 1690 where he was a King&#x27;s Scholar. He left Eton on 2 April 1696 and matriculated at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, on the same day. On 25 May 1698, he left Cambridge after the death of his only remaining older brother, Edward, so that he could help his father administer the family estate to which he had become the heir. Walpole had planned to become a clergyman but as he was now the eldest surviving son in the family, he abandoned the idea. In November 1700 his father died, and Robert succeeded to inherit the Walpole estate. A paper in his father&#x27;s handwriting, dated 9 June 1700, shows the family estate in Norfolk and Suffolk to have been nine manors in Norfolk and one in Suffolk.

=== Business success ===
As a young man, Walpole had bought shares in the South Sea Company, which monopolised trade with Spain, the Caribbean, and South America. The speculative market for slaves, rum, and mahogany spawned a frenzy that had ramifications throughout Europe when it collapsed. However, Walpole had bought at the bottom and sold at the top, adding greatly to his inherited wealth and allowing him to create Houghton Hall as seen today.

== Early career ==
===Political career===
Walpole&#x27;s political career began in January 1701 when he won a seat in the English general election at Castle Rising in Norfolk. He left Castle Rising in 1702 so that he could represent the neighbouring borough of King&#x27;s Lynn, a pocket borough that would re-elect him for the remainder of his political career. Voters and politicians nicknamed him &quot;Robin&quot;.

Like his father, Robert Walpole was a member of the Whig Party. In 1705, Walpole was appointed by Queen Anne to be a member of the council for her husband, Prince George of Denmark, Lord High Admiral. After having been singled out in a struggle between the Whigs and the government, Walpole became the intermediary for reconciling the government to the Whig leaders. His abilities were recognised by Lord Godolphin (the Lord High Treasurer and leader of the Cabinet) and he was subsequently appointed to the position of Secretary at War in 1708; for a short period of time in 1710 he also simultaneously held the post of Treasurer of the Navy.

Despite his personal clout, however, Walpole could not stop Lord Godolphin and the Whigs from pressing for the prosecution of Henry Sacheverell, a minister who preached anti-Whig sermons. The trial was extremely unpopular with much of the country, causing the Sacheverell riots, and was followed by the downfall of the Duke of Marlborough and the Whig Party in the general election of 1710. The new ministry, under the leadership of the Tory Robert Harley, removed Walpole from his office of Secretary at War but he remained Treasurer of the Navy until 2 January 1711. Harley had first attempted to entice him and then threatened him to join the Tories, but Walpole rejected the offers, instead becoming one of the most outspoken members of the Whig Opposition. He effectively defended Lord Godolphin against Tory attacks in parliamentary debate, as well as in the press.

In 1712, Walpole was accused of venality and corruption in the matter of two forage contracts for Scotland. Although it was proven that he had retained none of the money, Walpole was pronounced &quot;guilty of a high breach of trust and notorious corruption&quot;. He was impeached by the House of Commons and found guilty by the House of Lords; he was then imprisoned in the Tower of London for six months and expelled from Parliament. While in the Tower he was regarded as a political martyr, and visited by all the Whig leaders. After he was released, Walpole wrote and published anonymous pamphlets attacking the Harley ministry and assisted Sir Richard Steele in crafting political pamphlets. Walpole was re-elected for King&#x27;s Lynn in 1713.

===Stanhope–Sunderland ministry===

Queen Anne died in 1714. Under the Act of Settlement 1701, which excluded Roman Catholics from the line of succession, Anne was succeeded by her second cousin, the Elector of Hanover, George I. George I distrusted the Tories, who he believed opposed his right to succeed to the Throne. The year of George&#x27;s accession, 1714, marked the ascendancy of the Whigs who would remain in power for the next fifty years. Robert Walpole became a Privy Councillor and rose to the position of Paymaster of the Forces in a Cabinet nominally led by Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax, but actually dominated by Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend (Walpole&#x27;s brother-in-law), and James Stanhope (later 1st Earl Stanhope). Walpole was also appointed chairman of a secret committee formed to investigate the actions of the previous Tory ministry in 1715. Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer, was impeached, and Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke, suffered from an act of attainder, the Attainder of Viscount Bolingbroke Act 1714 (1 Geo. 1. St. 2. c. 16).

Halifax, the titular head of the administration, died in 1715 and by 1716 Walpole was appointed to the posts of First Commissioner (Lord) of the Treasury and Chancellor of the Exchequer. He was a member of the &quot;Board of General Officers&quot; established in 1717 to investigate the abuse of pay. Walpole&#x27;s fellow members, appointed by the Prince of Wales (later George II), included William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath, Secretary at War; General Lumley; General Erle; and Sir Philip Meadowes, Controller of the Army and Knight Marshal of the King&#x27;s Palace,
whose daughter, Mary Meadows, was maid-of-honour to Walpole&#x27;s friend, Queen Caroline. A keen huntsman, Walpole built for himself Great Lodge (Old Lodge) in Richmond Park. Philip Medows, the deputy ranger of the park and son of Walpole&#x27;s political ally, Sir Philip Meadowes, lived at Great Lodge after Walpole had vacated it.

In his new political positions, and encouraged by his advisers, Walpole introduced the sinking fund, a device to reduce the national debt. The Cabinet of which he was a member was often divided over most important issues. Normally, Walpole and Townshend were on one side, with Stanhope and Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland on the other. Foreign policy was the primary issue of contention; George I was thought to be conducting foreign affairs with the interests of his German territories, rather than those of Great Britain, at heart. The Stanhope–Sunderland faction, however, had the King&#x27;s support. In 1716 Townshend had been removed from the important post of Northern Secretary and put in the lesser office of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.

Even this change did not appease Stanhope and Sunderland, who secured the dismissal of Townshend from the Lord-Lieutenancy in April 1717. On the next day, Walpole resigned from the Cabinet to join the Opposition &quot;because I could not connive at some things that were carrying on&quot;, and by joining the opposition he did not intend &quot;to make the king uneasy or to embarrass his affairs.&quot; This began the Whig Split, dividing the dominant party for three years. In the new Cabinet, Sunderland and Stanhope (who was created an Earl) were the effective heads. Walpole reversed his earlier support for the impeachment of Robert Harley, the former first minister, and joined with the Tory opposition in securing an acquittal in July 1717.

Soon after Walpole&#x27;s resignation, a bitter family quarrel between the King and the Prince of Wales, split the royal family. Walpole and others who opposed the Government often congregated at Leicester House, the home of the Prince of Wales, to form political plans.

Walpole also became an adviser and close friend of the Prince of Wales&#x27;s wife, Caroline. In 1720 he improved his position by bringing about a reconciliation between the Prince of Wales and the King.

Walpole continued to be an influential figure in the House of Commons. He was especially active in opposing one of the Government&#x27;s more significant proposals, the Peerage Bill, which would have limited the power of the monarch to create new peerages. Walpole brought about a temporary abandonment of the bill in 1719 and the outright rejection of the bill by the House of Commons. This defeat led Stanhope and Sunderland to reconcile with their opponents; Walpole returned as Paymaster of the Forces and Townshend was appointed Lord President of the Council. By accepting the position of Paymaster, however, Walpole lost the favour of the Prince of Wales (the future King George II), who still harboured disdain for his father&#x27;s Government.

==Premiership (1721–1742) ==
Soon after Walpole returned to the Cabinet, Britain was swept by a wave of over-enthusiastic speculation which led to the South Sea Bubble. The Government had established a plan whereby the South Sea Company would assume the national debt of Great Britain in exchange for lucrative bonds. It was widely believed that the company would eventually reap an enormous profit through international trade in cloth, agricultural goods, and slaves. Many in the country, including Walpole himself (who sold at the top of the market and made 1,000 per cent profit), frenziedly invested in the company. By the latter part of 1720, however, the company had begun to collapse as the price of its shares plunged.

In 1721 a committee investigated the scandal, finding that there was corruption on the part of many in the Cabinet. Among those implicated were John Aislabie (the Chancellor of the Exchequer), James Craggs the Elder (the Postmaster General), James Craggs the Younger (the Southern Secretary), and even Lords Stanhope and Sunderland (the heads of the Ministry). Both Craggs the Elder and Craggs the Younger died in disgrace; the remainder were impeached for their corruption. Aislabie was found guilty and imprisoned, but the personal influence of Walpole saved both Stanhope and Sunderland. For his role in preventing these individuals and others from being punished, Walpole gained the nickname of &quot;The Screen&quot;,
or &quot;Screenmaster-General&quot;.

The resignation of Sunderland and the death of Stanhope in 1721 left Walpole as the most important figure in the administration. On 3 April 1721 he was appointed First Lord of the Treasury, Chancellor of the Exchequer and Leader of the House of Commons. Walpole&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; tenure as &quot;prime minister&quot; is often dated to his appointment as First Lord of the Treasury in 1721, though he himself rejected that title (it was originally a term of abuse), stating in 1741: &quot;I unequivocally deny that I am sole and prime minister.&quot; His brother-in-law Lord Townshend served as Secretary of State for the Northern Department and controlled the nation&#x27;s foreign affairs. The two also had to contend with the Secretary of State for the Southern Department, Lord Carteret. Townshend and Walpole were thus restored to power and &quot;annihilated the opposing faction&quot;.

===First term===

Under the guidance of Walpole, Parliament attempted to deal with the financial crisis brought on by the South Sea Bubble. The estates of the directors of the South Sea Company were used to relieve the suffering of the victims, and the stock of the company was divided between the Bank of England and East India Company. The crisis had gravely damaged the credibility of the King and of the Whig Party, but Walpole defended both with skilful oratory in the House of Commons.

Walpole&#x27;s first year as prime minister was also marked by the discovery of a plot formed by Francis Atterbury, the bishop of Rochester. The exposure of the scheme crushed the hopes of the Jacobites whose previous attempts at rebellion (most notably the risings of 1715 and 1719) had also failed. The Tory Party was equally unfortunate even though Lord Bolingbroke, a Tory leader who fled to France to avoid punishment for his Jacobite sympathies, was permitted to return to Britain in 1723.
During the remainder of George I&#x27;s reign, Walpole&#x27;s ascendancy continued; the political power of the monarch was gradually diminishing and that of his ministers gradually increasing. In 1724 the primary political rival of Walpole and Townshend in the Cabinet, Lord Carteret, was dismissed from the post of Southern Secretary and once again appointed to the lesser office of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. In Ireland, Lord Carteret used his power to secretly aid in the controversy over Wood&#x27;s Halfpence and support &quot;Drapier&#x27;s Letters&quot; behind the scenes and cause harm to Walpole&#x27;s power. Walpole was able to recover from these events by removing the patent. However, Irish sentiment was situated against the English control.

Townshend, working with the king, helped keep Great Britain at peace, especially by negotiating a treaty with France and Prussia in 1725. Walpole was not consulted and stated that Townshend was &quot;too precipitate&quot; in his actions. Great Britain, free from Jacobite threats, from war, and from financial crises, grew prosperous, and Robert Walpole acquired the favour of George I. In 1725 he persuaded the king to revive the Knighthood of the Bath and was himself invested with the order, and in 1726 was made a Knight of the Garter, earning him the nickname &quot;Sir Bluestring&quot;. His eldest son was granted a barony.

===Second term===
Walpole&#x27;s position was threatened in 1727 when George I died and was succeeded by George II. For a few days it seemed that Walpole would be dismissed but, on the advice of Queen Caroline, the King agreed to keep him in office. Although the King disliked Townshend, he retained him as well. Over the next years Walpole continued to share power with Townshend but the two clashed over British foreign affairs, especially over policy regarding Austria. Gradually Walpole became the clearly dominant partner in government. His colleague retired on 15 May 1730 and this date is sometimes given as the beginning of Walpole&#x27;s unofficial tenure as prime minister. Townshend&#x27;s departure enabled Walpole to conclude the Treaty of Vienna, creating the Anglo-Austrian alliance.

====Opposition====
Walpole, a polarising figure, had many opponents, the most important of whom were in the Country Party, such as Lord Bolingbroke (who had been his political enemy since the days of Queen Anne) and William Pulteney (a capable Whig statesman who felt snubbed when Walpole failed to include him in the Cabinet). Bolingbroke and Pulteney ran a periodical called &quot;The Craftsman&quot; in which they incessantly denounced the Prime Minister&#x27;s policies. Walpole was also satirised and parodied extensively; he was often compared to the criminal Jonathan Wild as, for example, John Gay did in his farcical &quot;Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot;. Walpole&#x27;s other enemies included Jonathan Swift, Alexander Pope, Henry Fielding, and Samuel Johnson.

Walpole secured the support of the people and of the House of Commons with a policy of avoiding war. He used his influence to prevent George II from entering the War of the Polish Succession in 1733, because it was a dispute between the Bourbons and the Habsburgs. He boasted, &quot;There are 50,000 men slain in Europe this year, and not one Englishman.&quot; By avoiding wars, Walpole could lower taxes. He reduced the national debt with a sinking fund, and by negotiating lower interest rates. He reduced the land tax from four shillings in 1721, to 3s in 1728, 2s in 1731 and finally to only 1s in 1732. His long-term goal was to replace the land tax, which was paid by the local gentry, with excise and customs taxes, which were paid by merchants and ultimately by consumers. Walpole joked that the landed gentry resembled hogs, which squealed loudly whenever anyone laid hands on them. By contrast, he said, merchants were like sheep, and yielded their wool without complaint. The joke backfired in 1733 when he was defeated in a major battle to impose excise taxes on wine and tobacco. To reduce the threat of smuggling, the tax was to be collected not at ports but at warehouses. This new proposal, however, was extremely unpopular and aroused the opposition of the nation&#x27;s merchants. Walpole agreed to withdraw the bill before Parliament voted on it, but he dismissed the politicians who had dared to oppose it in the first place. Thus, Walpole lost a considerable element of his Whig Party to the Opposition.

After the general elections of 1734, Walpole&#x27;s supporters still formed a majority in the House of Commons although they were less numerous than before. He maintained both his parliamentary supremacy and his popularity in Norfolk, his home county. In May 1734, he presented a new silver mace &quot;weighing 168 ounces, gilt, and finely exchased, to the city of Norwich – on the cup part of it are Sir Robert&#x27;s arms, and the arms of the city; it was first carried before Mayor Philip Meadows Esq. on the 29th of May&quot;. However, despite these great occasions, Walpole&#x27;s broader popularity had begun to wane. In 1736 an increase in the tax on gin inspired riots in London. The even more serious Porteous riots broke out in Edinburgh after the King pardoned a captain of the guard (John Porteous) who had commanded his troops to shoot a group of protesters. Though these events diminished Walpole&#x27;s popularity, they failed to shake his majority in Parliament. Walpole&#x27;s domination over the House of Commons was highlighted by the ease with which he secured the rejection of Sir John Barnard&#x27;s plan to reduce the interest on the national debt. Walpole was also able to persuade Parliament to pass the Licensing Act 1737 under which London theatres were regulated. The act revealed a disdain for Swift, Pope, Fielding, and other literary figures who had attacked his government in their works.

While the &quot;country party&quot; attacked Walpole relentlessly, he subsidised writers and lesser-known journalists such as William Arnall and Bishop Benjamin Hoadly as well as two men he named to the role of poet laureate, Laurence Eusden and Colley Cibber. They defended Walpole from the charge of evil political corruption by arguing that corruption is the universal human condition. Furthermore, they argued, political divisiveness was also universal and inevitable because of selfish passions that were integral to human nature. Arnall argued that government must be strong enough to control conflict, and in that regard, Walpole was quite successful. This style of &quot;court&quot; political rhetoric continued through the 18th century.

===Decline===
The year 1737 saw the death of Walpole&#x27;s close friend Queen Caroline. Though her death did not end his personal influence with George II, who had grown loyal to the Prime Minister during the preceding years, Walpole&#x27;s domination of government continued to decline. His opponents acquired a vocal leader in the Prince of Wales who was estranged from his father, the King. Several young politicians including William Pitt the Elder and George Grenville formed a faction known as the &quot;Patriot Boys&quot; and joined the Prince of Wales in opposition.

Walpole&#x27;s failure to maintain a policy of avoiding military conflict eventually led to his fall from power. Under the Treaty of Seville (1729), Great Britain agreed not to trade with the Spanish colonies in North America. Spain claimed the right to board and search British vessels to ensure compliance with this provision. Disputes, however, broke out over trade with the West Indies. Walpole attempted to prevent war but was opposed by the King, the House of Commons, and by a faction in his own Cabinet. In 1739 Walpole abandoned all efforts to stop the conflict and commenced the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear (so called because Robert Jenkins, a Welsh mariner, claimed that a Spaniard inspecting his vessel had severed his ear).

Walpole&#x27;s influence continued to dramatically decline even after the war began. In the 1741 general election his supporters secured an increase in votes in constituencies that were decided by mass electorates but failed to win in many pocket boroughs (constituencies subject to the informal but strong influence of patrons). In general, the government made gains in England and Wales but this was not enough to overturn the reverses of the 1734 election and further losses in Cornwall where many constituencies were obedient to the will of the Prince of Wales (who was also Duke of Cornwall). These constituencies returned members of parliament hostile to the Prime Minister. Similarly, the influence of the Duke of Argyll secured the election of members opposed to Walpole in some parts of Scotland. Walpole&#x27;s new majority was difficult to determine because of the uncertain loyalties of many new members, but contemporaries and historians estimated it as low as fourteen to eighteen.

In the new Parliament, many Whigs thought the ageing Prime Minister incapable of leading the military campaign. Moreover, his majority was not as strong as it had formerly been, his detractors – such as William Pulteney, earl of Bath, and Lord Perceval – being approximately as numerous as his supporters. Behind these political enemies were opposition Whigs, Tories and Jacobites. Walpole was alleged to have presided over an immense increase in corruption and to have enriched himself enormously whilst in office. Parliamentary committees were formed to investigate these charges. In 1742 when the House of Commons was prepared to determine the validity of a by-election in Chippenham, Walpole and others agreed to treat the issue as a motion of no confidence. As Walpole was defeated on the vote, he agreed to resign from the Government. The news of the naval disaster against Spain in the Battle of Cartagena de Indias also prompted the end of his political career. King George II wept on his resignation and begged to see him frequently. As part of his resignation the King agreed to elevate him to the House of Lords as the Earl of Orford, Viscount Walpole and Baron Walpole of Houghton in the County of Norfolk, this occurred on 6 February 1742. Five days later he formally relinquished the seals of office.

Although no longer First Lord of the Treasury, Walpole remained politically involved as an advisor. His former colleagues were still pleased to see him, perhaps in part because he retained the king&#x27;s favour. After his resignation, his main political roles were to support the government by means of advice, to dole out some patronage and to speak on the ministry&#x27;s behalf in the Lords.

==Later life==

Lord Orford was succeeded as prime minister by Lord Wilmington in an administration whose true head was Lord Carteret. A committee was created to inquire into Walpole&#x27;s ministry but no substantial evidence of wrongdoing or corruption was discovered. Though no longer a member of the Cabinet, Orford continued to maintain personal influence with George II and was often dubbed the &quot;Minister behind the Curtain&quot; for this advice and influence. In 1744 he managed to secure the dismissal of Carteret and the appointment of Henry Pelham whom he regarded as a political protégé. He advised Pelham to make use of his seat in the Commons to serve as a bridge between the King and Parliament, just as Walpole had done.

During this time, Walpole also made two interventions in the Lords. The first was in January 1744 in the debate on Hanoverian troops being kept in British pay. Walpole prevented them from losing the troops. In his second intervention, Walpole, with fear of a Jacobite-inspired invasion in February 1744, made a speech on the situation. Frederick, Prince of Wales, usually hostile to Walpole, warmly received him at his court the next day, most likely because his father&#x27;s throne, and the future of the whole Hanoverian dynasty, was at risk from the Stuart Pretender.

Along with his political interests in his last years, Walpole enjoyed the pleasures of the hunt. Back at his recently rebuilt country seat in Houghton, Norfolk, such pastimes were denied him due to &quot;dismal weather&quot;. He also enjoyed the beauties of the countryside. His art collection gave him particular pleasure. He had spent much money in the 1720s and 1730s in building up a collection of Old Masters from all over Europe. Walpole also concerned himself with estate matters.

His health, never good, deteriorated rapidly toward the end of 1744. Walpole died in London on 18 March 1745 from a bladder stone, aged 68 years, and was buried at the Church of St Martin at Tours on the Haughton estate. His earldom passed to his eldest son Robert who was in turn succeeded by his only son George. Upon the death of the third Earl, the earldom was inherited by the first Earl&#x27;s younger son Horace Walpole, who is now remembered for his many thousands of insightful letters, published in 48 volumes by Yale University Press. The title died with him in 1797.

==Legacy==
Walpole exercised a tremendous influence on the politics of his day. The Tories became a minor insignificant faction, and the Whigs became a dominant and largely unopposed party. His influence on the development of the uncodified constitution of Great Britain was less momentous, even though he is regarded as Great Britain&#x27;s first prime minister. He relied primarily on the favour of the King, rather than the support of the House of Commons. His power stemmed from his personal influence instead of the influence of his office. Most of his immediate successors were, comparatively speaking, extremely weak. It would take several decades more for the premiership to develop into the most powerful and most important office in the country.

Walpole&#x27;s strategy of keeping Great Britain at peace contributed greatly to the country&#x27;s prosperity. Walpole also managed to secure the position of the Hanoverian dynasty, and effectively countervailed Jacobitism. The Jacobite threat ended, soon after Walpole&#x27;s term ended, with the defeat of the rebellion of 1745. Later in the century, the Whig MP Edmund Burke &quot;admitted him into the whig pantheon&quot;. Burke wrote:

Lord Chesterfield expressed scepticism as to whether &quot;an impartial Character of Sr Robert Walpole, will or can be transmitted to Posterity, for he governed this Kingdom so long that the various passions of Mankind mingled, and in a manner incorporated themselves, with every thing that was said or writt concerning him. Never was Man more flattered nor more abused, and his long power, was probably the chief cause of both&quot;. Chesterfield claimed he was &quot;much acquainted with him both in his publick and his private life&quot;:

10 Downing Street represents another part of Walpole&#x27;s legacy. George II offered this home to Walpole as a personal gift in 1732, but Walpole accepted it only as the official residence of the First Lord of the Treasury, taking up his residence there on 22 September 1735. His immediate successors did not always reside in Number 10 (preferring their larger private residences), but the home has nevertheless become established as the official residence of the prime minister (in his or her capacity as First Lord of the Treasury).

Walpole has attracted attention from heterodox economists as a pioneer of protectionist policies, in the form of tariffs and subsidies to woollen manufacturers. As a result, the industry became Britain&#x27;s primary export, enabling the country to import the raw materials and food that fueled the industrial revolution.

Walpole is immortalised in St Stephen&#x27;s Hall, where he and other notable Parliamentarians look on at visitors to Parliament.

Walpole built Houghton Hall in Norfolk as his country seat. He also left behind a collection of art which he had assembled during his career. His grandson, the 3rd Earl of Orford, sold many of the works in this collection to the Russian Empress Catherine II in 1779. This collection – then regarded as one of the finest in Europe – now lies in the State Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia. In 2013 the Hermitage loaned the collection to Houghton for display, following the original William Kent hanging plan, which had been recently discovered at Houghton.

The nursery rhyme &quot;Who Killed Cock Robin?&quot; may allude to the fall of Walpole, who carried the popular nickname &quot;Cock Robin&quot;.
(Contemporaries satirised the Walpole regime as the &quot;Robinocracy&quot; or as the &quot;Robinarchy&quot;.)

Various locations are named after Walpole, including Walpole Street in Wolverhampton, England; and the towns of Walpole, Massachusetts (founded in 1724), and Orford, New Hampshire (incorporated in 1761) in the United States.

==Marriages and issue==
===Catherine Shorter===

On 30 July 1700, Walpole married Catherine Shorter (1682–1737), the eldest daughter and co-heiress of John Shorter of Bybrook in Ashford, Kent (the son of Sir John Shorter (1625–1688), Lord Mayor of London) by his wife Elizabeth Philipps (born c. 1664), a daughter of Sir Erasmus Philipps, 3rd Baronet. She was described as &quot;a woman of exquisite beauty and accomplished manners&quot;. Her £20,000 dowry was, according to Walpole&#x27;s brother Horatio Walpole, spent on the wedding, christenings and jewels. Her sister and co-heiress Charlotte Shorter married (as his third wife) Francis Seymour-Conway, 1st Baron Conway (1679–1731/2), by whom she was the mother of Francis Seymour-Conway, 1st Marquess of Hertford (1718–1794). Sir John Shorter (c. 1625–1688), Lord Mayor of London, married Isabel Birkhead, a sister of Edward Birkhead (d.1662) of Richmond House, Twickenham, Serjeant-at-Arms in the House of Commons in 1648, a Quaker Magistrate and the principal landowner in the parish of Twickenham. Catherine&#x27;s youngest son Horace later built Strawberry Hill House on land purchased by him at Twickenham. Catherine Shorter died on 20 August 1737 and was buried at Houghton, with a monument in the south aisle of the King Henry VII Chapel, Westminster Abbey, erected by her son Horatio, in the form of a life-size white marble statue, a copy by Filippo della Valle of a Roman statue of Livia (or &quot;Pudicitia&quot;) in the Villa Mattei in Rome.
On the plinth sculpted by John Michael Rysbrack is the following inscription written by Horace:
:To the memory of Catherine Lady Walpole, eldest daughter of John Shorter, Esqr. of Bybrook in Kent and first wife of Sir Robert Walpole, afterwards Earl of Orford, Horace her youngest son consecrates this monument. She had beauty and wit without vice or vanity, and cultivated the Arts without affectation. She was devout, tho&#x27; without bigotry to any sect, and was without prejudice to any party tho&#x27; the wife of a minister, whose power she esteemed but when she could employ it to benefit the miserable or to reward the meritorious. She loved a private life, tho&#x27; born to shine in public; and was an ornament to courts, untainted by them. She died 20 August 1737.
By Catherine Shorter he had two daughters and three sons:
* Robert Walpole, 2nd Earl of Orford, eldest son and heir, who in 1724 married Margaret Rolle (17 January 1709 – 13 January 1781), later &quot;suo jure&quot; 15th Baroness Clinton. They had one son George Walpole, 3rd Earl of Orford and 16th Baron Clinton (1730–1791), who left no legitimate children and died insane.
*Katherine Walpole, who died unmarried and without issue;
*Mary Walpole, who on 14 September 1723 married George Cholmondeley, 3rd Earl of Cholmondeley. They had sons and daughters and the Houghton Estate eventually became the inheritance of the Cholmondeley family. She died at Aix-en-Provence in 1731, and was buried at Malpas, Cheshire.
*Edward Walpole, who died unmarried but had four illegitimate children by his mistress Dorothy Clement:
**Edward, born in 1737, died in 1771 without issue;
**Laura, the eldest daughter, who married Bishop Frederick Keppel;
**Maria Walpole (d. 1807) (Duchess of Gloucester and Edinburgh), the second daughter, who married firstly James Waldegrave, 2nd Earl Waldegrave and secondly Prince William Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh the brother of King King George III. 
**Charlotte, the youngest daughter, who married Lionel Tollemache, 5th Earl of Dysart.
*Horatio Walpole, 4th Earl of Orford (24 September 1717 – 2 March 1797), of Strawberry Hill House, Twickenham, youngest son, the diarist known to history as &quot;Horace Walpole&quot;. He became the 4th and last Earl of Orford on his nephew&#x27;s death in 1791, and died unmarried and without issue.

===Maria Skerritt===

Prior to the death of his first wife Walpole took on a mistress, Maria Skeritt (d. 1738), a fashionable socialite of wit and beauty, with an independent fortune of £30,000, the daughter and sole heiress of Thomas Skeritt (d. 1738) (&quot;aliter&quot; Skerret, Skeritt, etc), a wealthy Irish merchant living in Dover Street, Mayfair, London. They had been living together openly in Richmond Park and Houghton Hall since before 1728, and married at some time before March 1738. She died on 4 June 1739 following a miscarriage. Walpole considered her &quot;indispensable to his happiness&quot;, and her loss plunged him into a &quot;deplorable and comfortless condition&quot;, which led to a severe illness. By Maria Skerritt he had one daughter, born before the marriage, but subsequently legitimated:
*Maria Walpole, who after her legitimation acquired the style of the daughter of an earl, as Lady Maria Walpole. In 1746 she married Colonel Charles Churchill (1720–1812) of Chalfont, an illegitimate son of General Charles Churchill, and became the king&#x27;s housekeeper at Windsor Castle. By Charles Churchill she had daughters including:
**Sophia Churchill, who married her relative Horatio Walpole, 2nd Earl of Orford (1752–1822), of the third creation of that earldom, the son of Horatio Walpole, 1st Earl of Orford, son of Horatio Walpole, 1st Baron Walpole of Wolterton, 9th brother of Prime Minister Robert Walpole, 1st Earl of Orford.
**Mary Churchill, who on 10 May 1777 became the second wife of Charles Cadogan, 1st Earl Cadogan (1728–1807), and had issue, before being divorced in 1796 by her husband for &quot;criminal conversation&quot; with Rev. Mr. Cooper.

<text>An enchilada (, ) is a Mexican dish consisting of a corn tortilla rolled around a filling and covered with a savory sauce. Enchiladas can be filled with various ingredients, including meats, cheese, beans, potatoes, vegetables, or combinations. Enchilada sauces include chili-based sauces, such as salsa roja, various moles, tomatillo-based sauces, such as salsa verde, or cheese-based sauces, such as chile con queso.

==Etymology==
The Royal Spanish Academy defines the word &quot;enchilada&quot;, as used in Mexico, as a rolled maize tortilla stuffed with meat and covered with a tomato and chili sauce. &quot;Enchilada&quot; is the past participle of the Mexican Spanish &quot;enchilar&quot;, &quot;to add chili pepper to&quot;; literally, &quot;to season (or decorate) with chili&quot;.

==History==
Enchiladas originated in Mexico, where the practice of rolling tortillas around other food dates back at least to Aztec times. The people living in the lake region of the Valley of Mexico traditionally ate corn tortillas folded or rolled around small fish. Writing at the time of the Spanish conquistadors, Bernal Díaz del Castillo documented a feast enjoyed by Europeans hosted by Hernán Cortés in Coyoacán, which included foods served in corn tortillas. (Note that the native Nahuatl name for the flat corn bread used was &quot;tlaxcalli&quot;; the Spanish gave it the name &quot;tortilla&quot;.) The Nahuatl word for enchilada is &quot;chīllapītzalli&quot; , which is formed of the Nahuatl word for &quot;chili&quot;, &quot;chīlli&quot; and the Nahuatl word for &quot;flute&quot;, &quot;tlapītzalli&quot; . In the 19th century, as Mexican cuisine was being memorialized, enchiladas were mentioned in the first Mexican cookbook, &quot;El cocinero mexicano&quot; (&quot;The Mexican Chef&quot;), published in 1831, and in Mariano Galvan Rivera&#x27;s &quot;Diccionario de Cocina&quot;, published in 1845.

==Varieties==
In their original form as Mexican street food, enchiladas were simply corn tortillas dipped in chili sauce and eaten without fillings. There are now many varieties, which are distinguished primarily by their sauces, fillings and, in one instance, by their form. Various adjectives may be used to describe the recipe content or origin, e.g. &quot;enchilada tapatia&quot; would be a recipe from Jalisco.

Varieties include:
* &quot;Enchiladas con chile rojo&quot; (with red chile) is a traditional red enchilada sauce, meat, composed of dried red chili peppers soaked and ground into a sauce with other seasonings, &quot;Chile Colorado&quot; sauce adds a tomato base.
* &quot;Enchiladas con mole&quot;, instead of chili sauce, are served with &quot;mole&quot;, and are also known as &quot;enmoladas&quot;.
* &quot;Enchiladas placeras&quot; are Michoacán plaza-style, made with vegetables and poultry.
* &quot;Enchiladas poblanas&quot; are soft corn tortillas filled with chicken and poblano peppers, topped with oaxaca cheese.
* &quot;Enchiladas potosinas&quot; originate from San Luis Potosi, Mexico, and are made with cheese-filled, chili-spiced masa.
* &quot;Enchiladas San Miguel&quot; are San Miguel de Allende-style enchiladas flavored with guajillo chilies by searing the flavor into the tortillas in a frying pan.

* &quot;Enchiladas suizas&quot; (Swiss-style) are topped with a milk- or cream-based white sauce such as &quot;béchamel&quot;. This appellation is derived from Swiss immigrants to Mexico who established dairies to produce cream and cheese.
* &quot;Enfrijoladas&quot; are topped with refried beans rather than chili sauce; their name comes from &quot;frijol&quot;, meaning &quot;bean&quot;.
* &quot;Entomatadas&quot; are made with tomato sauce instead of chili sauce.
* &quot;Enchiladas montadas&quot; (stacked enchiladas) are a New Mexico variation in which corn tortillas are fried flat until softened (but not tough) then stacked with red or green sauce, chopped onion and shredded cheese between the layers and on top of the stack. Ground beef or chicken can be added to the filling. The stack is often topped (&quot;montada&quot;) with a fried egg. Shredded lettuce and black olive slices may be added as a garnish.
* &quot;Enchiladas verdes&quot; are sauced with salsa verde and typically made with white corn tortillas, filled with poached chicken breasts and topped with queso fresco.
* &quot;Enjococadas&quot; are baked corn tortillas covered in jocoque and filled with queso panela and chile poblano.

==Fillings, toppings and garnishes==
Fillings include meat (e.g. beef, poultry, pork, seafood) or cheese, potatoes, vegetables, beans, tofu, and any combination thereof. Enchiladas are commonly topped or garnished with cheese, sour cream, lettuce, olives, chopped onions, chili peppers, sliced avocado, and salsa, or fresh cilantro.

==Outside of Mexico==
===Costa Rica===
In Costa Rica, the enchilada is a common, small, spicy pastry made with puff pastry and filled with diced potatoes spiced with a common variation of Tabasco sauce or other similar sauces. Other variations include fillings made of spicy chicken or minced meat.
===Honduras===
In Honduras, enchiladas look and taste very different from those in Mexico; they are not corn tortillas rolled around a filling, but instead are flat, fried, corn tortillas topped with ground beef, salad toppings (usually consisting of cabbage and tomato slices), a tomato sauce (often ketchup blended with butter and other spices such as cumin), and crumbled or shredded cheese. They look and taste much like what many people call a tostada.
===Nicaragua===
In Nicaragua, enchiladas are different from the other ones in Central America and resemble those in Mexico; they are corn tortillas filled with a mixture of ground beef and rice with chili, they are then folded and covered in egg batter and deep fried. It is commonly served with a cabbage and tomato salad (either pickled salad or in cream and tomato sauce). The Nicaraguan enchilada resembles the empanada of other countries.

===Guatemala===
In Guatemala, enchiladas look much like Honduran enchiladas but the recipe is different. This version most commonly begins with a leaf of fresh lettuce, then a layer of &#x27;picado de carne,&#x27; which includes meat (generally ground beef, shredded chicken, or pork) and diced vegetables (carrot, potato, onion, celery, green bean, peas, red bell pepper, garlic, bay leaf, seasoned with salt and black pepper). The next layer in the recipe is the &#x27;curtido&#x27; layer which includes more vegetables (cabbage, beets, onions, and carrots). After this is two or three pieces of sliced hard boiled egg, then thin sliced white onion, and finally a drizzle of mild red salsa. The dish is topped with either queso seco or queso fresco and garnished with cilantro.

<doc id="50528" wikidata="Q115148" url="?curid=50528" title="Dutchess County, New York">
<text>Dutchess County is a county in the U.S. state of New York. As of the 2020 census, the population was 295,911. The county seat is the city of Poughkeepsie. The county was created in 1683, one of New York&#x27;s first twelve counties, and later organized in 1713. Dutchess County is part of the Kiryas Joel-Poughkeepsie-Newburgh Metropolitan Statistical Area, which belongs to the larger New York–Newark–Bridgeport, NY-NJ-CT-PA Combined Statistical Area. The county is part of the Hudson Valley region of the state.

==History==
Before Anglo-Dutch settlement, what is today Dutchess County was a leading center for the indigenous Wappinger peoples. They had their council-fire at what is now Fishkill Hook, and had settlements throughout the area.

On November 1, 1683, the Province of New York established its first twelve counties, including Dutchess. Its boundaries at that time included the present Putnam County, and a small portion of the present Columbia County (the towns of Clermont and Germantown). The county was named for Mary of Modena, Duchess of York; &quot;&quot; is an archaic spelling of the word &quot;duchess&quot;.

The Province of New York and the Connecticut Colony negotiated an agreement on November 28, 1683, establishing their border as east of the Hudson River, north to Massachusetts. The east of the Byram River making up the Connecticut Panhandle were granted to Connecticut, in recognition of the wishes of the residents. In exchange, Rye was granted to New York, along with a wide strip of land running north from Ridgefield to Massachusetts alongside the New York counties of Westchester, Putnam then Dutchess, known as &quot;The Oblong&quot;. The eastern half of the stub of land in northeast Dutchess County containing Rudd Pond and Taconic State Park is the northernmost extension of The Oblong.

Until 1713, Dutchess was administered by Ulster County. On October 23, 1713, Queen Anne gave permission for Dutchess County to elect its own officers from among their own population, including a supervisor, tax collector, tax assessor and treasurer. In 2013, Dutchess County celebrated its 300th anniversary of democracy based upon a legislative resolution sponsored by County Legislator Michael Kelsey from Salt Point. In 1812, Putnam County was detached from Dutchess.

===The Patents===

Fourteen royal land patents were granted between 1685 and 1706 covering the entirety of the original footprint of Dutchess County (which until 1812 included today&#x27;s Putnam County).

The first ten, granted between 1685 and 1697, covered almost all of Hudson River shoreline in the original county, with three - Rombouts, the Great Nine Partners, and Philipse Patents - extending significantly inland. The eleventh, and smallest, Cuyler, 1697, was the first to contain solely inland territory, just in from the Hudson. The twelfth, and next smallest, Fauconnier, in 1705, completed the Hudson River shoreline. The last two, Beekman, 1705, and the Little Nine Partners, 1706, laid claim to the remaining interior lands.

===Early settlement===
From 1683 to 1715, most of the settlers in Dutchess County were Dutch. Many of these moved in from Albany and Ulster counties. They settled along the Fishkill Creek and in the areas that are now Poughkeepsie and Rhinebeck.

From 1715 to 1730, most of the new settlers in Dutchess county were Germans. From 1730 until 1775, New Englanders were the primary new settlers in Dutchess County. Coles Mills was settled by Elisha Cole from Cape Cod in 1747 at the outlet of Barrett Pond into the West Branch of the Croton River.
===20th century===
Franklin D. Roosevelt was born in Dutchess County. He lived in his family home in Hyde Park, overlooking the Hudson River. His family&#x27;s home is now the Home of Franklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site, managed by the National Park Service.

Prior to the 1960s, Dutchess County was primarily agricultural. Since then the southwestern part (from Poughkeepsie southward and from the Taconic State Parkway westward) of the county has developed into a largely residential area, suburban in character, with many of its residents commuting to jobs in New York City and Westchester County. The northern and eastern regions of the county remain rural with large farmlands but at the same time developed residences used during the summer and or on weekends by people living in the New York City urban area.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (3.6%) is water.

Dutchess County is located in southeastern New York State, between the Hudson River on its west and the New York–Connecticut border on its east, about halfway between the cities of Albany and New York City. It contains two cities: Beacon and Poughkeepsie. Depending on precise location within the county, road travel distance to New York City ranges between .

The terrain of the county is mostly hilly, especially in the Hudson Highlands in the southwestern corner and the Taconic Mountains to the northeast. Some areas nearer the river are flatter.

The highest point in the county is the summit of Brace Mountain, in the Taconics, at above sea level. The lowest point is sea level, along the Hudson River. The highest point of neighboring Fairfield County, Connecticut, is a point along the state line in Pawling.

Wappinger Creek, at from its source at Thompson Pond in Pine Plains to where it drains into the Hudson at New Hamburg, is the longest stream in the county. Its watershed is likewise the largest in the county. To its south is the watershed of Dutchess County&#x27;s second-longest stream, Fishkill Creek, part of which spills over into Putnam County. Within that watershed are the county&#x27;s third-longest stream, Sprout Creek, and its largest, deepest and highest lakes: Whaley (), in the town of Pawling; Sylvan () in the town of Beekman and Beacon Reservoir, in the town of Fishkill, at respectively.

Other, smaller tributaries of the Hudson such as the Saw Kill drain the northwestern portion of the county. The southeastern fringe of Dutchess is part of the upper Croton River watershed and thus part of the New York City water supply system. On the east, in the Oblong, streams drain into the Housatonic River in adjacent Connecticut.

A border nearly one-half mile (800 m) long exists with Berkshire County, Massachusetts, in the extreme northern end of the county.

About 5.0% of families and 7.5% of the population were below the poverty line, including 8.5% of those under age 18 and 6.5% of those age 65 or over.

The decrease in population between 1810 and 1820 was due to the separation of Putnam County from Dutchess in 1812.

=== Racial demographics ===
As of 2017, the residents of Dutchess County were reported as the following: American Indian and Alaska Native (0.04%), Asian (4%), Black or African American (8.5%), Hispanic or Latino (12.5%), Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander (0.016%), Some Other Race (0.35%), Two or More Races (3%), White (71%).
== Government ==
Dutchess County has a Charter Government with a County Executive and directly elected legislature of 25 members, each elected from a single member district. The Charter form of Government went in to effect in 1968 given the favorable outcome of a 1967 special election dedicated to the question. From 1713 until 1967, the County Government had been managed by a Board of Supervisors, made up of the locally elected leaders.


===Elections===













The composition of the County Legislature is 15 Republicans and 10 Democrats for the 2024–2025 term. County elections occur in odd-numbered years.

Historically, Dutchess County, like most of the lower Hudson, was classic &quot;Yankee Republican&quot; territory. Between 1884 and 2004, the Republican presidential candidate carried Dutchess County in 28 out of 30 elections (1964 and 1996 being exceptions). Even Hyde Park resident Franklin D. Roosevelt failed to carry the county during his four campaigns.

The Republican edge narrowed significantly in the 1990s, with George H. W. Bush going from 61 percent of the county&#x27;s vote in 1988 to only 40.5 percent in 1992, although that likely was affected by the presence of Ross Perot on the ballot as a third-party candidate. In 2008, Barack Obama became only the third Democrat to carry the county since 1884, and the first to win a majority since Lyndon Johnson in 1964. It has gone for the Democratic candidate in five consecutive elections (2008, 2012, 2016, 2020, and 2024), though never by a margin of more than 10%.

Dutchess County is split between two congressional districts. The most southern portion is in the 17th district, represented by Republican Mike Lawler. The rest of the county is in the 18th district, represented by Democrat Pat Ryan. These are considered &quot;swing&quot; districts nationally, with Cook Partisan Voting Index ratings of D+3 and D+1, respectively, as of 2022.

===Law enforcement===
The Cities of Beacon and Poughkeepsie; Towns of Fishkill, Hyde Park, Pine Plains, Poughkeepsie, Rhinebeck, Red Hook, and East Fishkill; and Villages of Millerton, Wappingers Falls, Millbrook, have their own Police departments. The remainder of the county is patrolled by the Dutchess County Sheriff&#x27;s Office and New York State Police. The New York State Police Troop K headquarters is located in Millbrook.

==Transportation==

===Roads===

* Interstate 84 traverses the county in an east–west route cutting through the southwestern quadrant of the county before entering Putnam County. It is the only interstate highway in the county.
* US 9, the Taconic State Parkway (the only other limited-access road in the county besides I-84, although it still has some at-grade intersections), and NY 22 are the main north–south roads in the county. For much of its length the Taconic is paralleled by NY 82. NY 9G leaves US 9 in Poughkeepsie and parallels it north to the Columbia County line.
* US 44, NY 52, NY 55, and NY 199 are the other primary east–west roads in the county. NY 52 enters the county concurrent with I-84, leaves it at Fishkill but then follows it into Putnam County. NY 55 enters the county concurrently with US 44, leaves it at Poughkeepsie, but neither of the two routes encounter each other again within the state.

===Crossings===

Three spans cross the Hudson River, linking Dutchess with Orange, Ulster, and Greene Counties:

* The Newburgh-Beacon Bridge carries Interstate 84 and NY 52 between Fishkill/Beacon and Newburgh (Orange County). The westbound span opened in 1963 and the eastbound span opened in 1980.
* The Mid-Hudson Bridge carries US 44 and NY 55 between Poughkeepsie and Highland (Town of Lloyd, Ulster County)
* The Kingston-Rhinecliff Bridge carries NY 199 between Rhinebeck and Kingston (Ulster County)

===Railroads===
The Metro-North railroad provides a critical link to New York City for Dutchess County&#x27;s commuting population. The Hudson Line and Amtrak run concurrently along the Hudson River, on the western edge of the county. The Hudson Line has stops at Breakneck Ridge, Beacon, and New Hamburg (a hamlet of the town of Poughkeepsie) before the Hudson Line terminates at Poughkeepsie. The tracks continue north of that point as Amtrak, with Poughkeepsie and Rhinecliff (a small hamlet in the Town of Rhinebeck) being stops along Amtrak&#x27;s Empire Service.

The Harlem Line, on the eastern side of the county, has station stops in Pawling, along the Appalachian Trail, Wingdale, Dover Plains, and two stops in Wassaic (one along the Tenmile River and the other the namesake terminus of that line).

===Buses and ferries===

Public transportation in Dutchess County is handled by Dutchess County Public Transit, commonly called &quot;the LOOP.&quot; Outside of the urbanized area of the county, most service is limited. Privately run lines connect Poughkeepsie to New Paltz and Beacon to Newburgh. Leprechaun Lines and Short Line Bus also operate some service through Poughkeepsie, Rhinebeck, and the southern part of the county.

NY Waterway operates the Newburgh–Beacon Ferry, which is located at the Beacon train station.

===Air===
General aviation facilities are located at Hudson Valley Regional Airport (formerly Dutchess County Airport), located in Wappinger and Sky Park Airport in Red Hook, New York. General commercial passenger service is provided by New York Stewart International Airport, which is located across the Hudson River in Newburgh.
==Culture==
Dutchess County holds an annual county fair. The County Chamber of Commerce holds an annual hot air balloon launch typically in the first week of July. The main launch sites are along the Hudson River. As many as 20 balloons participate in the event.

The Dutchess County Historical Society was formed in 1914 and is active in the preservation of a large collection at the 18th century Clinton House. The Society has published a yearbook since 1914 and presents up to four awards of merit in the field of Dutchess County history each year.

===Media===
Dutchess County has no locally based television stations. (However, it does have a translator for the Capitol District PBS affiliate, WMHT.) Its only news radio format station is WKIP (AM) of Poughkeepsie. WRHV is an NPR affiliated broadcasting out of Poughkeepsie. The country music format station, WRWB-FM, broadcasting across the Hudson River, can be reached in much of the county.

&quot;Poughkeepsie Journal&quot; is published in that city. &quot;Vassar Miscellany News,&quot; associated with Vassar College, is published weekly. Also published in the county is the &quot;Beacon Free Press&quot;/&quot;Southern Dutchess News.&quot;

== Health ==
The county is home to four hospitals. Northern Dutchess Hospital in Rhinebeck and Vassar Brothers Medical Center in Poughkeepsie are both owned by Nuvance Health. In addition, MidHudson Regional Hospital (formerly St. Francis) is located in Poughkeepsie and The Castle Point Veterans Health Administration is in Wappinger.

On March 11, 2020, the county&#x27;s first case of COVID-19 was confirmed. As of June 2021, there had been 29,483 cases and 445 deaths.

==Sports==
The Hudson Valley Renegades are a minor league baseball team affiliated with the New York Yankees. The team is a member of the High-A East, play at Dutchess Stadium in Fishkill and have been located in Dutchess County since 1994.

Previous professional sports teams include the Hudson Valley Bears (2008-2009) which played hockey, and the Hudson Valley Hawks which played in the former National Professional Basketball League.

<doc id="50530" wikidata="Q3189180" url="?curid=50530" title="Mole (animal)">
<text>Moles are small, subterranean mammals. They have cylindrical bodies, velvety fur, very small, inconspicuous eyes and ears, reduced hindlimbs, and short, powerful forelimbs with large paws adapted for digging.

The word &quot;mole&quot; most commonly refers to many species in the family Talpidae (which are named after the Latin word for mole, &quot;talpa&quot;). True moles are found in most parts of North America, Europe (except for Ireland) and Asia. Other mammals referred to as moles include the African golden moles and the Australian marsupial moles, which have a similar ecology and lifestyle to true moles, but are unrelated. 

Moles may be viewed as pests to gardeners, but they provide positive contributions to soil, gardens, and ecosystems, including soil aeration, feeding on slugs and small creatures that eat plant roots, and providing prey for other wildlife. They eat earthworms and other small invertebrates in the soil.

==Terminology==
In Middle English, moles were known as &quot;moldwarps&quot;. The expression &quot;don&#x27;t make a mountain out of a molehill&quot; (which means &quot;exaggerating problems&quot;) was first recorded in Tudor times. By the era of Early Modern English, the mole was also known in English as &quot;mouldywarp&quot; or &quot;mouldiwarp&quot;, a word having cognates in other Germanic languages such as German (&quot;Maulwurf&quot;), and Danish, Norwegian, Swedish and Icelandic (&quot;muldvarp&quot;, &quot;moldvarp&quot;, &quot;mullvad&quot;, &quot;moldvarpa&quot;), where &quot;muld/mull/mold&quot; refers to soil and &quot;varp/vad/varpa&quot; refers to throwing, hence &quot;one who throws soil&quot; or &quot;dirt-tosser&quot;.

Male moles are called &quot;boars&quot;; females are called &quot;sows&quot;.

==Characteristics==

===Underground breathing===
Moles have been found to tolerate higher levels of carbon dioxide than other mammals, because their blood cells have a special form of hemoglobin that has a higher affinity to oxygen than other forms. In addition, moles use oxygen more effectively by reusing the exhaled air, and can survive in low-oxygen environments such as burrows.

===Extra thumbs===

Moles have polydactyl forepaws: each has an extra thumb (also known as a prepollex) next to the regular thumb. While the mole&#x27;s other digits have multiple joints, the prepollex has a single, sickle-shaped bone that develops later and differently from the other fingers during embryogenesis from a transformed sesamoid bone in the wrist, independently evolved but similar to the giant panda thumb. This supernumerary digit is species-specific, as it is not present in shrews, the mole&#x27;s closest relatives. Androgenic steroids are known to affect the growth and formation of bones, and a connection is possible between this species-specific trait and the male genital apparatus in female moles of many mole species (gonads with testicular and ovary tissues).

== Diet ==
Moles are omnivores, but their diet primarily consists of earthworms and other small invertebrates found in the soil. The mole runs are in reality &quot;worm traps&quot;, the mole sensing when a worm falls into the tunnel and quickly running along to kill and eat it. Because their saliva contains a toxin that can paralyze earthworms, moles are able to store their still-living prey for later consumption. They construct special underground &quot;larders&quot; for just this purpose; researchers have discovered such larders with over a thousand earthworms in them. Before eating earthworms, moles pull them between their squeezed paws to force the collected earth and dirt out of the worm&#x27;s gut.

The star-nosed mole can detect, catch and eat food faster than the human eye can follow.

==Breeding==
Breeding season for a mole depends on species, but is generally from February through May. Males search for females by letting out high-pitched squeals and tunneling through foreign areas.

The gestation period of the Eastern (North America) mole (&quot;Scalopus aquaticus&quot;) is approximately 42 days. Three to five young are born, mainly in March and early April. Townsend&#x27;s moles mate in February and March, and the 2–4 young are born in March and April after a gestation period of about 1 month.

==Social structure==
Moles are allegedly solitary creatures, coming together only to mate. Territories may overlap, but moles avoid each other and males may fight fiercely if they meet.

==Classification==

The family Talpidae contains all the true moles and some of their close relatives. Those species called &quot;shrew moles&quot; represent an intermediate form between the moles and their shrew ancestors, and as such may not be fully described by the article.

Moles were traditionally classified in the order Insectivora, but that order has since been abandoned because it has been shown to not be monophyletic. Moles are now classified with shrews and hedgehogs, in the more narrowly defined order Eulipotyphla.

==Other &quot;moles&quot;==
Many groups of burrowing animals (pink fairy armadillos, tuco-tucos, mole rats, mole crickets, pygmy mole crickets, and mole crabs) have independently developed close physical similarities with moles due to convergent evolution; two of these are so similar to true moles, they are commonly called and thought of as &quot;moles&quot; in common English, although they are completely unrelated to true moles or to each other. These are the golden moles of southern Africa and the marsupial moles of Australia. While difficult to distinguish from each other, they are most easily distinguished from true moles by shovel-like patches on their noses, which they use in tandem with their abbreviated forepaws to swim through sandy soils.

===Golden moles===
The golden moles belong to the same branch on the phylogenetic tree as the tenrecs, called Tenrecomorpha, which, in turn, stem from a main branch of placental mammals called the Afrosoricida. This means that they share a closer common ancestor with such existing afrosoricids as elephants, manatees and aardvarks than they do with other placental mammals, such as true Talpidae moles.

===Marsupial moles===

As marsupials, these moles are even more distantly related to true talpid moles than golden moles are, both of which belong to the Eutheria, or placental mammals. This means that they are more closely related to such existing Australian marsupials as kangaroos or koalas, and even to a lesser extent to American marsupials, such as opossums, than they are to placental mammals, such as golden or Talpidae moles.

==Interaction with humans==

===Pelts===

Moles&#x27; pelts have a velvety texture not found in surface animals. Surface-dwelling animals tend to have longer fur with a natural tendency for the nap to lie in a particular direction, but to facilitate their burrowing lifestyle, mole pelts are short and very dense and have no particular direction to the nap. This makes it easy for moles to move backwards underground, as their fur is not &quot;brushed the wrong way&quot;. The leather is extremely soft and supple. Queen Alexandra, the wife of Edward VII of the United Kingdom, ordered a mole-fur garment to start a fashion that would create a demand for mole fur, thereby turning what had been a serious pest problem in Scotland into a lucrative industry for the country. Hundreds of pelts are cut into rectangles and sewn together to make a coat. The natural color is taupe, (derived from the French noun &quot;taupe&quot; meaning mole) but it is readily dyed any color.

The term &quot;moleskin&quot; for a tough cotton fabric is in common use today.

===Pest status: extermination and humane options===

Moles are considered agricultural pests in some countries, while in others, such as Germany, they are a protected species, but may be killed with a permit. Problems cited as caused by moles include contamination of silage with soil particles, making it unpalatable to livestock, the covering of pasture with fresh soil reducing its size and yield, damage to agricultural machinery by the exposure of stones, damage to young plants through disturbance of the soil, weed invasion of pasture through exposure of freshly tilled soil, and damage to drainage systems and watercourses. Other species such as weasels and voles may use mole tunnels to gain access to enclosed areas or plant roots.

Moles burrow and raise molehills, killing parts of lawns. They can undermine plant roots, indirectly causing damage or death. Moles do not eat plant roots.
Moles are controlled with traps such as mole-catchers, smoke bombs, and poisons such as calcium carbide, which produces acetylene gas to drive moles away. Strychnine was also used for this purpose in the past. The most common method now is Phostoxin or Talunex tablets. They contain aluminium phosphide and are inserted in the mole tunnels, where they turn into phosphine gas (not be confused with phosgene gas). More recently, high-grade nitrogen gas has proven effective at killing moles, with the added advantage of having no polluting effect to the environment.
Other common defensive measures include cat litter and blood meal, to repel the mole, or smoking its burrow. Devices are also sold to trap the mole in its burrow, when one sees the &quot;mole hill&quot; moving and therefore knows where the animal is, and then stabbing it.

Other humane options are also possible including humane traps that capture the mole alive so it may be transported elsewhere. In many contexts including ordinary gardens, the damage caused by moles to lawns is mostly visual, and it is possible instead of extermination to simply remove the earth of the molehills as they appear, leaving their permanent galleries for the moles to continue their existence underground. However, when the tunnels are near the surface in soft ground or after heavy rain, they may collapse, leaving (small) unsightly furrows in the lawn.

===Meat===
William Buckland, known for eating every animal he could, opined that mole meat tasted vile.

=== Archaeology ===
Moles can inadvertently help archaeologists by bringing small artifacts to the surface through their digging. By examining molehills for sherds and other small objects, archaeologists can find evidence of human habitation.

<doc id="50534" wikidata="Q76961" url="?curid=50534" title="Caroline of Ansbach">
<text>Caroline of Brandenburg-Ansbach (Wilhelmina Charlotte Caroline; 1 March 1683 – 20 November 1737) was Queen of Great Britain and Ireland and Electress of Hanover from 11 June 1727 until her death in 1737 as the wife of King George II.

Caroline&#x27;s father, Margrave John Frederick of Brandenburg-Ansbach, belonged to a branch of the House of Hohenzollern and was the ruler of a small German state, the Principality of Ansbach. After Caroline was orphaned at a young age, she moved to the enlightened court of her guardians, King Frederick I and Queen Sophia Charlotte of Prussia. At the Prussian court, her previously limited education was widened and she adopted the liberal outlook possessed by Sophia Charlotte, who became her good friend and whose views influenced Caroline all her life.

When she was a young woman, Caroline was much sought-after as a bride. After rejecting the suit of Archduke Charles of Austria, a claimant to the Spanish throne, she married George Augustus, who was third in line to the English throne (and subsequently the British throne) and heir apparent to the Electorate of Hanover. They had eight children, seven of whom reached adulthood. Caroline moved to Britain permanently in 1714 when her husband became Prince of Wales. As Princess of Wales she joined George Augustus in rallying political opposition to his father, King George I. In 1717, after a family row, George Augustus was expelled from court. Caroline came to be associated with Robert Walpole, an opposition politician who was a former government minister. Walpole rejoined the government in 1720, and George Augustus reconciled publicly with his father on Walpole&#x27;s advice. Over the next few years Walpole rose to become the leading minister.

Upon her husband&#x27;s accession in 1727, Caroline became queen and electress, and her eldest son, Frederick, became Prince of Wales. He was a focus for the opposition, like his father before him, and Caroline&#x27;s relationship with him was strained. As princess and as queen, Caroline was known for her political influence, which she exercised both through and for Walpole. Her tenure included four regencies, which occurred during George II&#x27;s stays in Hanover; she is credited with strengthening the House of Hanover&#x27;s place in Britain during a period of political instability. After her death in 1737, Caroline was widely mourned by her political allies as well as by the King, who refused to remarry.

==Early life==

Caroline was born on 1 March 1683 at Ansbach, the daughter of John Frederick, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach, and his second wife, Princess Eleonore Erdmuthe of Saxe-Eisenach. Her father was the ruler of one of the smallest German states; he died of smallpox at the age of 32, when Caroline was three years old. Caroline and her only full sibling, her younger brother Margrave William Frederick, left Ansbach with their mother, who returned to her native Eisenach.
In 1692, Caroline&#x27;s widowed mother was pushed into an unhappy marriage with the Elector of Saxony, and she and her two children moved to the Saxon court at Dresden. Eleonore Erdmuthe was widowed again two years later, after her unfaithful husband contracted smallpox from his mistress. Eleonore remained in Saxony for another two years, until her death in 1696. The orphaned Caroline and William Frederick returned to Ansbach to stay with their elder half-brother, Margrave George Frederick II. George Frederick was a youth with little interest in parenting a girl, and so Caroline soon moved to Lützenburg outside Berlin, where she entered into the care of her new guardians, Frederick, Elector of Brandenburg, and his wife, Sophia Charlotte, who had been a friend of Eleonore Erdmuthe.

===Education===
Frederick and Sophia Charlotte became king and queen of Prussia in 1701. The Queen was the daughter of Sophia, Dowager Electress of Hanover, and the sister of George, Elector of Hanover. She was renowned for her intelligence and strong character, and her uncensored and liberal court attracted a great many scholars, including philosopher Gottfried Leibniz. Caroline was exposed to a lively intellectual environment quite different from anything she had experienced previously. Before she began her education under Sophia Charlotte&#x27;s care, Caroline had received little formal education; her handwriting remained poor throughout her life. With her lively mind, Caroline developed into a scholar of considerable ability. She and Sophia Charlotte developed a strong relationship in which Caroline was treated as a surrogate daughter; the Queen once declared Berlin was &quot;a desert&quot; without Caroline whenever she left temporarily for Ansbach.

==Marriage==

An intelligent and attractive woman, Caroline was much sought-after as a bride. Dowager Electress Sophia called her &quot;the most agreeable Princess in Germany&quot;. She was considered for the hand of Archduke Charles of Austria, who was a candidate for the throne of Spain and later became Holy Roman Emperor. Charles made official overtures to her in 1703, and the match was encouraged by King Frederick of Prussia. After some consideration, Caroline refused in 1704, as she would not convert from Lutheranism to Catholicism. Early in the following year, Queen Sophia Charlotte died on a visit to her native Hanover. Caroline was devastated, writing to Leibniz, &quot;The calamity has overwhelmed me with grief and sickness, and it is only the hope that I may soon follow her that consoles me.&quot;

In June 1705, Sophia Charlotte&#x27;s nephew Prince George Augustus of Hanover visited the Ansbach court, supposedly incognito, to inspect Caroline, as his father the Elector did not want his son to enter into a loveless arranged marriage as he himself had. The nephew of three childless uncles, George Augustus was under pressure to marry and father an heir to prevent endangering the Hanoverian succession. He had heard reports of Caroline&#x27;s &quot;incomparable beauty and mental attributes&quot;. He immediately took a liking to her &quot;good character&quot; and the British envoy reported that George Augustus &quot;would not think of anybody else after her&quot;. For her part, Caroline was not fooled by the prince&#x27;s disguise, and found her suitor attractive. He was the heir apparent of his father&#x27;s Electorate of Hanover and third-in-line to the English throne, then held by his distant cousin Queen Anne, after his grandmother Dowager Electress Sophia and his father the Elector.

On 22 August 1705, Caroline arrived in Hanover for her wedding to George Augustus; they were married that evening in the palace chapel at Herrenhausen. By May of the following year, Caroline was pregnant, and her first child Prince Frederick was born on 20 January 1707. A few months after the birth, in July, Caroline fell seriously ill with smallpox followed by pneumonia. Her baby was kept away from her, but George Augustus remained devotedly at her side, catching the infection himself. They both survived. Over the next seven years, Caroline had three more children, Anne, Amelia, and Caroline, all of whom were born in Hanover.

George Augustus and Caroline had a successful and loving marriage, though he continued to keep mistresses, as was customary for the time. Caroline was aware of his infidelities; they were well known and he told her about them himself. His two best-known mistresses were Henrietta Howard, later Countess of Suffolk, and, beginning in 1735, Amalie von Wallmoden, Countess of Yarmouth. Howard was one of Caroline&#x27;s Women of the Bedchamber and became Mistress of the Robes when her husband inherited a peerage in 1731; she retired in 1734. In contrast with George Augustus and his mother, Sophia Dorothea, Caroline was known for her marital fidelity; she never made any embarrassing scenes nor did she take lovers. She preferred her husband&#x27;s mistresses to be her ladies-in-waiting so that she could keep a closer eye on them.

After the union of England and Scotland in 1707, the succession of George Augustus&#x27;s family to the united British throne was confirmed but insecure, since Queen Anne&#x27;s half-brother James Stuart contested the Hanoverian claim, and Anne had fallen out with Dowager Electress Sophia. The Queen refused permission for any of the Hanoverians to visit Britain in her lifetime. Caroline wrote to Leibniz, &quot;I accept the comparison which you draw, though all too flattering, between me and Queen Elizabeth as a good omen. Like Elizabeth, the Electress&#x27;s rights are denied her by a jealous sister [Queen Anne], and she will never be sure of the English crown until her accession to the throne.&quot; In June 1714, Sophia died in Caroline&#x27;s arms at the age of 83, and Caroline&#x27;s father-in-law became Queen Anne&#x27;s heir presumptive. Just weeks later, Anne died, and the Elector of Hanover was proclaimed her successor, becoming George I of Great Britain.

==Princess of Wales==

George Augustus sailed to England in September 1714, and Caroline and two of her daughters followed in October. Her journey across the North Sea from The Hague to Margate was the only sea voyage she took in her life. Their young son, Prince Frederick, remained in Hanover for the rest of George I&#x27;s reign, and was brought up by private tutors.

On the accession of George I in 1714, George Augustus automatically became Duke of Cornwall and Duke of Rothesay. Shortly afterwards, he was invested as Prince of Wales, whereupon Caroline became Princess of Wales. She was the first woman to receive the title at the same time as her husband received his. She was also the first Princess of Wales in over two hundred years, the previous one being Catherine of Aragon in the 16th century. Since George I had repudiated his wife, Sophia Dorothea of Celle, in 1694 before he became King of Great Britain, there was no queen consort, and Caroline was therefore the highest-ranking woman in the kingdom. George Augustus and Caroline made a concerted effort to &quot;anglicise&quot; by getting to know England&#x27;s language, people, politics and customs. Two separate and very different courts developed: the old king&#x27;s court had German courtiers and government ministers, while the Wales&#x27;s court attracted English nobles who were out of favour with the King, and was considerably more popular with the British people. George Augustus and Caroline gradually became centres of the political opposition to the King.

Two years after their arrival in England, Caroline suffered a stillbirth, which her friend the Countess of Bückeburg blamed on the incompetence of English doctors, but the following year she had another son, Prince George William, in November. At the baptism, George Augustus fell out with his father over the choice of godparents, leading to the couple&#x27;s placement under house arrest at St James&#x27;s Palace prior to their banishment from court. Caroline was originally allowed to stay with their children, but refused as she believed her place was with George Augustus. The couple moved into Leicester House, while their children remained in the care of the King. Caroline fell sick with worry, and fainted during a secret visit to her children made without the King&#x27;s approval. By January, the King had relented and allowed Caroline unrestricted access. In February, Prince George William fell ill, and the King allowed both George Augustus and Caroline to see him at Kensington Palace without any conditions. When the baby died, a post-mortem was conducted to prove that the cause of death was disease (a polyp on the heart) rather than the separation from his mother. Further tragedy occurred in 1718, when she miscarried at Richmond Lodge, her country residence, after being startled by a violent storm. Over the next few years, Caroline had three more children: William, Mary and Louise. In July 1725, her 11th and final pregnancy ended in a second miscarriage.

Leicester House became a frequent meeting place for the ministry&#x27;s political opponents. Caroline struck up a friendship with politician Sir Robert Walpole, a former minister in the Whig government who led a disgruntled faction of the party. In April 1720, Walpole&#x27;s wing of the Whig party reconciled with the governing wing, and Walpole and Caroline helped to effect a reconciliation between the King and George Augustus for the sake of public unity. Caroline wanted to regain her three eldest daughters, who remained in the care of the King, and thought the reconciliation would lead to their return, but negotiations came to nothing. George Augustus came to believe that Walpole had tricked him into the reconciliation as part of a scheme to gain power. The prince was isolated politically when Walpole&#x27;s Whigs joined the government, and Leicester House played host to literary figures and wits, such as John Arbuthnot and Jonathan Swift, rather than politicians. Arbuthnot told Swift that Caroline had enjoyed his &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;, particularly the tale of the crown prince who wore one high-heel and one low-heel in a country where the King and his party wore low heels, and the opposition wore high ones: a barely veiled reference to the political leanings of the Prince of Wales.

Caroline&#x27;s intellect far outstripped her husband&#x27;s, and she read avidly. She established an extensive library at St James&#x27;s Palace. As a young woman, she corresponded with Gottfried Leibniz, the intellectual colossus who was courtier and factotum to the House of Hanover. She later facilitated the Leibniz-Clarke correspondence, arguably the most important philosophy of physics discussion of the 18th century. She helped to popularise the practice of variolation (an early type of immunisation), which had been witnessed by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu and Charles Maitland in Constantinople. At the direction of Caroline, six condemned prisoners from Newgate Prison were offered the chance to undergo variolation instead of execution: they all survived, as did six orphan children given the same treatment as a further test. Convinced of its medical value, Caroline had her children Amelia, Caroline and Frederick inoculated against smallpox in the same manner. In praising her support for smallpox inoculation, Voltaire wrote of her, &quot;I must say that despite all her titles and crowns, this princess was born to encourage the arts and the well-being of mankind; even on the throne she is a benevolent philosopher; and she has never lost an opportunity to learn or to manifest her generosity.&quot;

==Queen consort and regent==
On George I&#x27;s death in 1727, George Augustus ascended as George II and Caroline became queen consort. George II and Caroline&#x27;s coronation was held at Westminster Abbey on 11 October that year. Though George II denounced Walpole as a &quot;rogue and rascal&quot; over the terms of the reconciliation with his father, Caroline advised her husband to retain Walpole as the leading minister. Walpole commanded a substantial majority in Parliament and George II had little choice but to accept him or risk ministerial instability. Walpole secured a civil list payment of £100,000 a year for Caroline, and she was given both Somerset House and Richmond Lodge. Courtier Lord Hervey called Walpole &quot;the Queen&#x27;s minister&quot; in recognition of their close relationship. For the next ten years, Caroline had immense influence. She persuaded the King to adopt policies at the behest of Walpole, and persuaded Walpole against taking inflammatory actions. Caroline had absorbed the liberal opinions of her mentor, Queen Sophia Charlotte of Prussia, and supported clemency for the Jacobites (supporters of the rival Stuart claim to the throne), freedom of the press, and freedom of speech in Parliament.

Over the next few years, the King and Queen fought a constant battle against their eldest son, Frederick, Prince of Wales, who had been left behind in Germany when they came to England. He joined the family in 1728, by which time he was an adult, had mistresses and debts, and was fond of gambling and practical jokes. He opposed his father&#x27;s political beliefs, and complained of his lack of influence in government. The Regency Act 1728 made Caroline rather than Frederick regent when her husband was in Hanover for five months from May 1729. During her regency, a diplomatic incident with Portugal (where a British ship had been seized on the Tagus) was defused, and the negotiation of the Treaty of Seville between Britain and Spain was concluded. From May 1732, she was regent for four months while George II was again away in Hanover. An investigation into the penal system uncovered widespread abuses, including cruel treatment and conspiracy in the escape of wealthy convicts. Caroline pressed Walpole for reform, largely unsuccessfully. In March 1733, Walpole introduced an unpopular Excise Bill to parliament, which the Queen supported, but it gathered such strong opposition that it was eventually dropped.

Caroline&#x27;s entire life in Britain was spent in southeast England in or around London. As queen, she continued to surround herself with artists, writers and intellectuals. She collected jewellery, especially cameos and intaglios, acquired important portraits and miniatures, and enjoyed the visual arts. She commissioned works such as terracotta busts of the kings and queens of England from Michael Rysbrack, and supervised a more naturalistic design of the royal gardens by William Kent and Charles Bridgeman. In 1728, she rediscovered sets of sketches by Leonardo da Vinci and Hans Holbein that had been hidden in a drawer since the reign of William III.

Caroline&#x27;s eldest daughter, Anne, married William IV of Orange in 1734 and moved with her husband to the Netherlands. Caroline wrote to her daughter of her &quot;indescribable&quot; sadness at the parting. Anne soon felt homesick and travelled back to England when her husband went on campaign. Eventually her husband and father commanded her to return to Holland.

==Final years==

In mid-1735, Prince Frederick was further dismayed when Caroline, rather than himself, again acted as regent while the King was absent in Hanover. The King and Queen arranged Frederick&#x27;s marriage, in 1736, to Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha. Shortly after the wedding, George went to Hanover, and Caroline resumed her role as &quot;Protector of the Realm&quot;. As regent, Caroline considered the reprieve of Captain John Porteous, who had been convicted of murder in Edinburgh. Before she could act, a mob stormed the jail where he was held and killed him. Caroline was appalled. George&#x27;s absences abroad were leading to unpopularity, and in late 1736 he made plans to return, but his ship was caught in poor weather, and it was rumoured that he had been lost at sea. Caroline was devastated, and disgusted by the insensitivity of her son, who hosted a grand dinner while the gale was blowing. During her regency, Frederick attempted to start a number of quarrels with his mother, whom he saw as a useful proxy to irritate the King. George eventually returned in January 1737.

Frederick applied to Parliament unsuccessfully for an increased financial allowance that had hitherto been denied him by the King, and public disagreement over the money drove a further wedge between parents and son. On the advice of Walpole, Frederick&#x27;s allowance was raised in an attempt to mitigate further conflict, but by less than he had asked. In June 1737, Frederick informed his parents that Augusta was pregnant, and due to give birth in October. In fact, Augusta&#x27;s due date was earlier and a peculiar episode followed in July in which the prince, on discovering that his wife had gone into labour, sneaked her out of Hampton Court Palace in the middle of the night, to ensure that the King and Queen could not be present at the birth. George and Caroline were horrified. Traditionally, royal births were witnessed by members of the family and senior courtiers to guard against children, and Augusta had been forced by her husband to ride in a rattling carriage for an hour and a half while heavily pregnant and in pain. With a party including her daughters Amelia and Caroline and Lord Hervey, the Queen raced over to St James&#x27;s Palace, where Frederick had taken Augusta. Caroline was relieved to discover that Augusta had given birth to a &quot;poor, ugly little she-mouse&quot;, also called Augusta, rather than a &quot;large, fat, healthy boy&quot; as the pitiful nature of the baby made a supposititious child unlikely. The circumstances of the birth deepened the estrangement between mother and son. According to Lord Hervey, she once remarked after seeing Frederick, &quot;Look, there he goes—that wretch!—that villain!—I wish the ground would open this moment and sink the monster to the lowest hole in hell!&quot;

In the final years of her life, Caroline was troubled by gout in her feet, but more seriously she had suffered an umbilical hernia at the birth of her final child in 1724. On 9 November 1737, she felt an intense pain and, after struggling through a formal reception, took to her bed. Part of her small intestine had poked through the hernia opening. Over the next few days she was bled, purged, and operated on, without anaesthetic, but there was no improvement in her condition. George refused Frederick permission to see his mother, a decision with which she complied; she sent her son a message of forgiveness through Walpole. She asked her husband to remarry after her death, which he rejected saying he would take only mistresses; she replied &quot;Ah, mon Dieu, cela n&#x27;empêche pas&quot; (&quot;My God, that doesn&#x27;t prevent it&quot;). On 17 November, her strangulated bowel burst. She died on 20 November 1737 at St James&#x27;s Palace.

Caroline was buried in Westminster Abbey on 17 December. Frederick was not invited to the funeral. George Frideric Handel composed an anthem for the occasion, &quot;The Ways of Zion Do Mourn / Funeral Anthem for Queen Caroline&quot;. George arranged for a pair of matching coffins with removable sides, so that when he followed her to the grave (23 years later), they could lie together again.

==Legacy==

Caroline was widely mourned. The Protestants lauded her moral example, and even the Jacobites acknowledged her compassion, and her intervention on the side of mercy for their compatriots. During her lifetime her refusal to convert when offered the hand of Archduke Charles was used to portray her as a strong adherent to Protestantism. For example, John Gay wrote of Caroline in &quot;A Letter to A Lady&quot; (1714):
:The pomp of titles easy faith might shake,
:She scorn&#x27;d an empire for religion&#x27;s sake:
:For this, on earth, the British crown is giv&#x27;n,
:And an immortal crown decreed in heav&#x27;n.

Caroline was widely seen by both the public and the court as having great influence over her husband. A satirical verse of the period went:
:You may strut, dapper George, but &#x27;twill all be in vain,
:We all know &#x27;tis Queen Caroline, not you, that reign –
:You govern no more than Don Philip of Spain.
:Then if you would have us fall down and adore you,
:Lock up your fat spouse, as your dad did before you.
The memoirs of the 18th century, particularly those of John, Lord Hervey, fed perceptions that Caroline and Walpole governed her husband. Peter Quennell wrote that Hervey was the &quot;chronicler of this remarkable coalition&quot; and that she was Hervey&#x27;s &quot;heroine&quot;. Using such sources, biographers of the 19th and 20th centuries credit her with aiding the establishment of the House of Hanover in Britain, in the face of Jacobite opposition. R. L. Arkell wrote &quot;by her acumen and geniality, [Caroline] ensured the dynasty&#x27;s rooting itself in England&quot;, and William Henry Wilkins said her &quot;gracious and dignified personality, her lofty ideals and pure life did much to counteract the unpopularity of her husband and father-in-law, and redeem the early Georgian era from utter grossness.&quot; Although modern historians tend to believe that Hervey, Wilkins and Arkell have overestimated her importance, it is nevertheless probable that Caroline of Ansbach was one of the most influential consorts in British history.

<doc id="50538" wikidata="Q334993" url="?curid=50538" title="Eugene V. Debs">
<text>Eugene Victor Debs (November 5, 1855 – October 20, 1926) was an American socialist, political activist, trade unionist, one of the founding members of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), and five-time candidate of the Socialist Party of America for President of the United States. Through his presidential candidacies as well as his work with labor movements, Debs eventually became one of the best-known socialists living in the United States.

Early in his political career, Debs was a member of the Democratic Party. He was elected as a Democrat to the Indiana General Assembly in 1884. After working with several smaller unions, including the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen, Debs led his union in a major ten-month strike against the CB&amp;Q Railroad in 1888. Debs was instrumental in the founding of the American Railway Union (ARU), one of the nation&#x27;s first industrial unions. After workers at the Pullman Palace Car Company organized a wildcat strike over pay cuts in the summer of 1894, Debs signed many into the ARU. He led a boycott by the ARU against handling trains with Pullman cars in what became the nationwide Pullman Strike, affecting most lines west of Detroit and more than 250,000 workers in 27 states. Purportedly to keep the mail running, President Grover Cleveland used the United States Army to break the strike. As a leader of the ARU, Debs was convicted of federal charges for defying a court injunction against the strike and served six months in prison.

In prison, Debs read various works of socialist theory and emerged six months later as a committed adherent of the international socialist movement. Debs was a founding member of the Social Democracy of America (1897), the Social Democratic Party of America (1898) and the Socialist Party of America (1901). Debs ran as a Socialist candidate for President of the United States five times: 1900 (earning 0.6 percent of the popular vote), 1904 (3.0 percent), 1908 (2.8 percent), 1912 (6.0 percent), and 1920 (3.4 percent), the last time from a prison cell. He was also a candidate for United States Congress from his native state Indiana in 1916.

Debs was noted for his oratorical skills, and his speech denouncing American participation in World War I led to his second arrest in 1918. He was convicted under the Sedition Act of 1918 and sentenced to a 10-year term. President Warren G. Harding commuted his sentence in December 1921. Debs died in 1926, not long after being admitted to a sanatorium due to cardiovascular problems that developed during his time in prison.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Eugene Victor &quot;Gene&quot; Debs was born on November 5, 1855, in Terre Haute, Indiana, to Jean Daniel and Marguerite Mari Bettrich Debs, who immigrated to the United States from Colmar, Alsace, France. His father, who came from a prosperous Protestant family, owned a textile mill and meat market. Debs was named after the French authors Eugène Sue and Victor Hugo.


Debs attended public school, dropping out of high school at age 14. He took a job with the Vandalia Railroad cleaning grease from the trucks of freight engines for fifty cents a day. He later became a painter and car cleaner in the railroad shops. In December 1871, when a drunken locomotive fireman failed to report for work, Debs was pressed into service as a night fireman. He decided to remain a fireman on the run between Terre Haute and Indianapolis, earning more than a dollar a night for the next three and half years. In July 1875, Debs left to work at a wholesale grocery house, where he remained for four years while attending a local business school at night.

Debs joined the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen (BLF) in February 1875 and became active in the organization. In 1877 he served as a delegate of the Terre Haute lodge to the organization&#x27;s national convention. Debs was elected associate editor of the BLF&#x27;s monthly organ, &quot;Firemen&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, in 1878. Two years later, he was appointed Grand Secretary and Treasurer of the BLF and editor of the magazine in July 1880. He worked as a BLF functionary until February 1893 and as the magazine&#x27;s editor until September 1894.

At the same time, he became a prominent figure in the community. He served two terms as Terre Haute&#x27;s city clerk from September 1879 to September 1883. In the autumn of 1884, he was elected as a Democrat to represent Terre Haute and Vigo County in the Indiana General Assembly. He served for one term in 1885.

===Marriage and family===
Debs married Katherine &quot;Kate&quot; Metzel on June 9, 1885, at St. Stephen&#x27;s Episcopal church. Their home still stands in Terre Haute, preserved on the campus of Indiana State University.

==Labor activism==
The railroad brotherhoods were comparatively conservative organizations, focused on providing fellowship and services rather than on collective bargaining. Their motto was &quot;Benevolence, Sobriety, and Industry&quot;. As editor of the official journal of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen, Debs initially concentrated on improving the brotherhood&#x27;s death and disability insurance programs. During the early 1880s, Debs&#x27;s writing stressed themes of self-uplift: temperance, hard work, and honesty. Debs also held the view that &quot;labor and capital are friends&quot; and opposed strikes as a means of settling differences. The brotherhood had never authorized a strike from its founding in 1873 to 1887, a record which Debs was proud of. Railroad companies cultivated the brotherhood and granted them perks like free transportation to their conventions for the delegates. Debs also invited railroad president Henry C. Lord to write for the magazine. Summarizing Debs&#x27;s thought in this period, the historian David A. Shannon wrote: &quot;Debs&#x27;s was one of peace and co-operation between labor and capital, but he expected management to treat labor with respect, honor and social equality&quot;.

Debs gradually became convinced of the need for a more unified and confrontational approach as railroads were powerful forces in the economy. One influence was his involvement in the Burlington Railroad Strike of 1888, a defeat for labor that convinced Debs of &quot;the need to reorganize across craft lines&quot;, according to Joanne Reitano. After stepping down as Brotherhood Grand Secretary in 1893, Debs organized one of the first industrial unions in the United States, the American Railway Union (ARU), for unskilled workers. He was elected president of the ARU upon its founding, with fellow railway labor organizer George W. Howard as first vice president. The union successfully struck the Great Northern Railway in April 1894, winning most of its demands.

===Pullman Strike===
In 1894, Debs became involved in the Pullman Strike, which grew out of a compensation dispute started by the workers who constructed the rail cars made by the Pullman Palace Car Company. The Pullman Company, citing falling revenue after the economic Panic of 1893, had cut the wages of its factory employees by twenty-eight percent. The workers, many of whom were already members of the ARU, appealed for support to the union at its convention in Chicago, Illinois. Debs tried to persuade union members, who worked on the railways, that the boycott was too risky given the hostility of the railways and the federal government, the weakness of the union, and the possibility that other unions would break the strike.

The membership ignored his warnings and refused to handle Pullman cars or any other railroad cars attached to them, including cars containing the U.S. mail. After ARU Board Director Martin J. Elliott extended the strike to St. Louis, doubling its size to eighty thousand workers, Debs relented and decided to take part in the strike, which was now endorsed by almost all members of the ARU in the immediate area of Chicago. On July 9, 1894, a &quot;New York Times&quot; editorial called Debs &quot;a lawbreaker at large, an enemy of the human race&quot;. Strikers fought by establishing boycotts of Pullman train cars and with Debs&#x27;s eventual leadership the strike came to be known as &quot;Debs&#x27; Rebellion&quot;.

The federal government intervened, obtaining an injunction against the strike on the grounds that the strikers had obstructed the U.S. mail, carried on Pullman cars, by refusing to show up for work. President Grover Cleveland, whom Debs had supported in all three of his presidential campaigns, sent the United States Army to enforce the injunction. The presence of the army was enough to break the strike. Overall, thirty strikers were killed in the strike, thirteen of them in Chicago, and thousands were blacklisted. An estimated $80 million worth of property was damaged and Debs was found guilty of contempt of court for violating the injunction and sent to federal prison.

Debs was represented by Clarence Darrow, later a leading American lawyer and civil libertarian, who had previously been a corporate lawyer for the railroad company. Although it is commonly thought that Darrow &quot;switched sides&quot; to represent Debs, a myth repeated by Irving Stone&#x27;s biography, &quot;Clarence Darrow for the Defense&quot;, he had in fact resigned from the railroad earlier, after the death of his mentor William Goudy. A Supreme Court case decision, &quot;In re Debs&quot;, later upheld the right of the federal government to issue the injunction.

== Socialist leader ==

At the time of his arrest for mail obstruction, Debs was not yet a socialist. While serving his six-month term in the jail at Woodstock, Illinois, Debs and his ARU comrades received a steady stream of letters, books and pamphlets in the mail from socialists around the country. Debs recalled several years later:

I began to read and think and dissect the anatomy of the system in which workingmen, however organized, could be shattered and battered and splintered at a single stroke. The writings of [Edward] Bellamy and [Robert] Blatchford early appealed to me. &quot;The Cooperative Commonwealth&quot; of [Laurence] Gronlund also impressed me, but the writings of [Karl] Kautsky were so clear and conclusive that I readily grasped, not merely his argument, but also caught the spirit of his socialist utterance – and I thank him and all who helped me out of darkness into light.

Additionally, Debs was visited in jail by the Milwaukee socialist newspaper editor Victor L. Berger, who in Debs&#x27;s words &quot;came to Woodstock, as if a providential instrument, and delivered the first impassioned message of Socialism I had ever heard&quot;. In his 1926 obituary in &quot;Time&quot;, it was said that Berger left him a copy of &quot;Capital&quot; and &quot;prisoner Debs read it slowly, eagerly, ravenously&quot;. Debs emerged from jail at the end of his sentence a changed man. He spent the final three decades of his life proselytizing for the socialist cause.

After Debs and Martin Elliott were released from prison in 1895, Debs started his socialist political career. Debs started agitating for the ARU membership to form a Social Democratic organization. In 1896, Debs supported Democratic candidate William Jennings Bryan in the presidential election following Bryan&#x27;s Cross of Gold speech. After Bryan&#x27;s loss in the election, a disappointed Debs decided for certain that the future for socialist policies lay outside the Democratic Party. In June 1897, the ARU membership finally joined with the Brotherhood of the Cooperative Commonwealth to form the Social Democracy of America.

Debs&#x27;s wife Kate was opposed to socialism and was &quot;hostile&quot; to Debs&#x27;s socialist revolutionary activism as &quot;it threatened her sense of middle-class respectability&quot;. The &quot;tempestuous relationship with a wife who rejects the very values he holds most dear&quot; was the basis of Irving Stone&#x27;s biographical novel &quot;Adversary in the House&quot;.

=== Split to found the Social Democratic Party ===
The Social Democracy of America (SDA), founded in June 1897 by Eugene V. Debs from the remnants of his American Railway Union, was deeply divided between those who favored a tactic of launching a series of colonies to build socialism by practical example and others who favored establishment of a European-style socialist political party with a view to capture of the government apparatus through the ballot box.

The June 1898 convention would be the group&#x27;s last, with the minority political action wing quitting the organization to establish a new organization, the Social Democratic Party of America (SDP), also called the Social Democratic Party of the United States. Debs was elected to the National Executive Board, the five-member committee which governed the party, and his brother, Theodore Debs, was selected as its paid executive secretary, handling day-to-day affairs of the organization. Although by no means the sole decision-maker in the organization, Debs&#x27;s status as prominent public figure in the aftermath of the Pullman strike provided cachet and made him the recognized spokesman for the party in the newspapers.

===Presidential elections===
Along with Elliott, who ran for Congress in 1900, Debs was the first federal office candidate for the fledgling socialist party, running unsuccessfully for president the same year. Debs and his running mate Job Harriman received 87,945 votes (0.6 percent of the popular vote) and no electoral votes.

Following the 1900 Election, the Social Democratic Party and dissidents who had split from the Socialist Labor Party in 1899 unified forces at a Socialist Unity Convention held in Indianapolis in mid-1901 – a meeting which established the Socialist Party of America (SPA).

Debs was the Socialist Party of America candidate for president in 1904, 1908, 1912, and 1920 (the final time from prison). Though he received increasing numbers of popular votes in each subsequent election, he never won any votes in the Electoral College. In both 1904 and 1908, Debs ran with running-mate Ben Hanford. They received 402,810 votes in 1904, for 3.0 percent of the popular vote and an overall third-place finish. In the 1908 election, they received a slightly higher number of votes (420,852) than in their previous run, but at 2.8 percent, a smaller percentage of the total votes cast. In 1912, Debs ran with Milwaukee mayor Emil Seidel as a running mate and received 901,551 votes, which was 6.0 percent of the popular vote, which remains the all-time highest percentage of the vote for a Socialist Party candidate in a U.S. presidential election. Though Debs won no state&#x27;s electoral votes, in Florida, he came in second behind Wilson and ahead of President William Howard Taft and former President Teddy Roosevelt. Finally, in 1920, running with Seymour Stedman, Debs won 914,191 votes (3.4%), which remains the all-time high number of votes for a Socialist Party candidate in a U.S. presidential election. Notably, the Nineteenth Amendment passed in 1920, granting women the federal right to vote across the country, and with the expanded voting pool, his vote total accounted for only 3.4 percent of the total number of votes cast. The size of the vote is nevertheless remarkable since Debs was at the time a federal prisoner in jail for sedition, though he promised to pardon himself if elected.

Although he received some success as a third-party candidate, Debs was largely dismissive of the electoral process as he distrusted the political bargains that Victor Berger and other &quot;sewer socialists&quot; had made in winning local offices. He put much more value on organizing workers into unions, favoring unions that brought together all workers in a given industry over those organized by the craft skills workers practiced.

=== Founding the Industrial Workers of the World ===
After his work with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and the American Railway Union, Debs&#x27;s next major work in organizing a labor union came during the founding of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). On June 27, 1905, in Chicago, Illinois, Debs and other influential union leaders including Bill Haywood, leader of the Western Federation of Miners; and Daniel De Leon, leader of the Socialist Labor Party, held what Haywood called the &quot;Continental Congress of the working class&quot;. Haywood stated: &quot;We are here to confederate the workers of this country into a working-class movement that shall have for its purpose the emancipation of the working class&quot;. Debs stated: &quot;We are here to perform a task so great that it appeals to our best thought, our united energies, and will enlist our most loyal support; a task in the presence of which weak men might falter and despair, but from which it is impossible to shrink without betraying the working class&quot;.

=== Socialists split with the Industrial Workers of the World ===

Although the IWW was built on the basis of uniting workers of industry, a rift began between the union and the Socialist Party. It started when the electoral wing of the Socialist Party, led by Victor Berger and Morris Hillquit, became irritated with speeches by Haywood. In December 1911, Haywood told a Lower East Side audience at New York City&#x27;s Cooper Union that parliamentary Socialists were &quot;step-at-a-time people whose every step is just a little shorter than the preceding step&quot;. It was better, Haywood said, to &quot;elect the superintendent of some branch of industry, than to elect some congressman to the United States Congress&quot;. In response, Hillquit attacked the IWW as &quot;purely anarchistic&quot;.

The Cooper Union speech was the beginning of a split between Haywood and the Socialist Party, leading to the split between the factions of the IWW, one faction loyal to the Socialist Party and the other to Haywood. The rift presented a problem for Debs, who was influential in both the IWW and the Socialist Party. The final straw between Haywood and the Socialist Party came during the Lawrence Textile Strike. The decision of the elected officials in Lawrence, Massachusetts, to send police, who subsequently used their clubs on children, disgusted Haywood, who publicly declared that &quot;I will not vote again&quot; until such a circumstance was rectified. Haywood was purged from the National Executive Committee by passage of an amendment that focused on the direct action and sabotage tactics advocated by the IWW. Debs was probably the only person who could have saved Haywood&#x27;s seat.

In 1906, when Haywood had been on trial for his life in Idaho, Debs had described him as &quot;the Lincoln of Labor&quot; and called for Haywood to run against Theodore Roosevelt for president, but times had changed and Debs, facing a split in the party, chose to echo Hillquit&#x27;s words, accusing the IWW of representing anarchy. Debs thereafter stated that he had opposed the amendment, but that once it was adopted it should be obeyed. Debs remained friendly to Haywood and the IWW after the expulsion despite their perceived differences over IWW tactics.

Prior to Haywood&#x27;s dismissal, the Socialist Party membership had reached an all-time high of 135,000. One year later, four months after Haywood was recalled, the membership dropped to 80,000. The reformists in the Socialist Party attributed the decline to the departure of the &quot;Haywood element&quot; and predicted that the party would recover, but it did not. In the election of 1912, many of the Socialists who had been elected to public office lost their seats.

=== Leadership style ===
Debs was noted by many to be a charismatic speaker who sometimes called on the vocabulary of Christianity and much of the oratorical style of evangelism, even though he was generally disdainful of organized religion. Howard Zinn opined that &quot;Debs was what every socialist or anarchist or radical should be: fierce in his convictions, kind and compassionate in his personal relations.&quot; Heywood Broun noted in his eulogy for Debs, quoting a fellow Socialist: &quot;That old man with the burning eyes actually believes that there can be such a thing as the brotherhood of man. And that&#x27;s not the funniest part of it. As long as he&#x27;s around I believe it myself&quot;.

Although sometimes called &quot;King Debs&quot;, Debs himself was not wholly comfortable with his standing as a leader. As he told an audience in Detroit in 1906:

=== Sedition conviction and appeal to U.S. Supreme Court ===
Debs&#x27;s speeches against the Wilson administration and the war earned the enmity of President Woodrow Wilson, who later called Debs a &quot;traitor to his country&quot;. On June 16, 1918, Debs made a speech in Canton, Ohio, urging resistance to the military draft. He was arrested on June 30 and charged with ten counts of sedition.

His trial defense called no witnesses, asking that Debs be allowed to address the court in his defense. That unusual request was granted, and Debs spoke for two hours. He was found guilty on September 12. At his sentencing hearing on September 14, he again addressed the court and his speech has become a classic. Heywood Broun, a liberal journalist and not a Debs partisan, said it was &quot;one of the most beautiful and moving passages in the English language. He was for that one afternoon touched with inspiration. If anyone told me that tongues of fire danced upon his shoulders as he spoke, I would believe it.&quot; Debs said in part:

Your honor, I have stated in this court that I am opposed to the form of our present government; that I am opposed to the social system in which we live; that I believe in the change of both but by perfectly peaceable and orderly means. ...

I am thinking this morning of the men in the mills and factories; I am thinking of the women who, for a paltry wage, are compelled to work out their lives; of the little children who, in this system, are robbed of their childhood, and in their early, tender years, are seized in the remorseless grasp of Mammon, and forced into the industrial dungeons, there to feed the machines while they themselves are being starved body and soul. ...

Your honor, I ask no mercy, I plead for no immunity. I realize that finally the right must prevail. I never more fully comprehended than now the great struggle between the powers of greed on the one hand and upon the other the rising hosts of freedom. I can see the dawn of a better day of humanity. The people are awakening. In due course of time they will come into their own.

When the mariner, sailing over tropic seas, looks for relief from his weary watch, he turns his eyes toward the Southern Cross, burning luridly above the tempest-vexed ocean. As the midnight approaches the Southern Cross begins to bend, and the whirling worlds change their places, and with starry finger-points the Almighty marks the passage of Time upon the dial of the universe; and though no bell may beat the glad tidings, the look-out knows that the midnight is passingthat relief and rest are close at hand.

Let the people take heart and hope everywhere, for the cross is bending, midnight is passing, and joy cometh with the morning.

Debs was sentenced on September 18, 1918, to ten years in prison and was also disenfranchised for life. Debs presented what has been called his best-remembered statement at his sentencing hearing:

Your Honor, years ago I recognized my kinship with all living beings, and I made up my mind that I was not one bit better than the meanest on earth. I said then, and I say now, that while there is a lower class, I am in it, and while there is a criminal element, I am of it, and while there is a soul in prison, I am not free.

Debs appealed his conviction to the Supreme Court. In its ruling on &quot;Debs v. United States&quot;, the court examined several statements Debs had made regarding World War I and socialism. While Debs had carefully worded his speeches in an attempt to comply with the Espionage Act of 1917, the Court found he had the intention and effect of obstructing the draft and military recruitment. Among other things, the Court cited Debs&#x27;s praise for those imprisoned for obstructing the draft. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. stated in his opinion that little attention was needed since Debs&#x27;s case was essentially the same as that of &quot;Schenck v. United States&quot;, in which the court had upheld a similar conviction.

Debs went to prison on April 13, 1919. In protest of his jailing, Charles Ruthenberg led a parade of unionists, socialists, anarchists, and communists on May 1 (May Day) in Cleveland, Ohio. The event quickly broke into the violent May Day riots of 1919.

=== 1920 presidential run ===

Debs ran for president in the 1920 election while imprisoned in the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary. Campaign pins reading &quot;For President: Convict No. 9653&quot; accompanied his campaign. He received 914,191 votes (3.4 percent), a slightly smaller percentage than he had won in 1912, when he received 6 percent, the highest number of votes for a Socialist Party presidential candidate in the United States. During his time in prison, Debs wrote a series of columns deeply critical of the prison system. They appeared in sanitized form in the Bell Syndicate and were published in his only book, &quot;Walls and Bars&quot;, with several added chapters. It was published posthumously.

In March 1919, President Wilson asked Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer for his opinion on clemency, offering his own: &quot;I doubt the wisdom and public effect of such an action.&quot; Palmer generally favored releasing people convicted under the wartime security acts, but when he consulted with Debs&#x27;s prosecutorseven those with records as defenders of civil libertiesthey assured him that Debs&#x27;s conviction was correct and his sentence appropriate. The President and his Attorney General both believed that public opinion opposed clemency and that releasing Debs could strengthen Wilson&#x27;s opponents in the debate over the ratification of the peace treaty. Palmer proposed clemency in August and October 1920 without success. At one point, Wilson wrote: &quot;While the flower of American youth was pouring out its blood to vindicate the cause of civilization, this man, Debs, stood behind the lines sniping, attacking, and denouncing them. ... This man was a traitor to his country and he will never be pardoned during my administration.&quot; In January 1921, Palmer, citing Debs&#x27;s deteriorating health, proposed to Wilson that Debs receive a presidential pardon freeing him on February 12, Lincoln&#x27;s birthday. Wilson returned the paperwork after writing &quot;Denied&quot; across it.

In March 1921, soon after the inauguration of President Warren G. Harding, Debs met Harding&#x27;s Attorney General Harry Daugherty, but was returned to jail afterwards.

On December 23, 1921, President Harding commuted Debs&#x27;s sentence to time served, effective Christmas Day. He did not issue a pardon. A White House statement summarized the administration&#x27;s view of Debs&#x27;s case:

There is no question of his guilt. ... He was by no means, however, as rabid and outspoken in his expressions as many others, and but for his prominence and the resulting far-reaching effect of his words, very probably might not have received the sentence he did. He is an old man, not strong physically. He is a man of much personal charm and impressive personality, which qualifications make him a dangerous man calculated to mislead the unthinking and affording excuse for those with criminal intent.

=== Last years ===
When Debs was released from the Atlanta Penitentiary, the other prisoners sent him off with &quot;a roar of cheers&quot; and a crowd of fifty thousand greeted his return to Terre Haute to the accompaniment of band music. En route home, Debs was warmly received at the White House by Harding, who greeted him by saying: &quot;Well, I&#x27;ve heard so damned much about you, Mr. Debs, that I am now glad to meet you personally.&quot;

In 1924, Debs was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by the Finnish Socialist Karl H. Wiik on the grounds that &quot;Debs started to work actively for peace during World War I, mainly because he considered the war to be in the interest of capitalism.&quot; The same year, he was named &quot;national chairman&quot; of the Socialist Party, a newly-created office that allowed him to step away from the taxing work of the National Executive Committee.

He spent his remaining years trying to recover his health, which was severely undermined by prison confinement. In late 1926, he was admitted to Lindlahr Sanitarium in Elmhurst, Illinois. He died there of heart failure on October 20, 1926, at the age of 70. His body was cremated and buried in Highland Lawn Cemetery in Terre Haute, Indiana.

== Legacy ==

Debs helped motivate the American left to organize political opposition to corporations and World War I. American socialists, communists, and anarchists honor his work for the labor movement and motivation to have the average working man build socialism without large state involvement. Several books have been written about his life as an inspirational American socialist.

The Vermont senator and presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has long been an admirer of Debs and produced in 1979 a documentary about Debs which was released as a film and an audio LP record as an audio-visual teaching aid. In the documentary, he described Debs as &quot;probably the most effective and popular leader that the American working class has ever had&quot;. Sanders hung a portrait of Debs in city hall in Burlington, Vermont, when he served as mayor of the city in the 1980s and has a plaque dedicated to Debs in his congressional office.

On May 22, 1962, Debs&#x27;s home was purchased for $9,500 by the Eugene V. Debs Foundation, which worked to preserve it as a Debs memorial. In 1965 it was designated as an official historic site of the state of Indiana, and in 1966 it was designated as a National Historic Landmark of the United States. The preservation of the museum is monitored by the National Park Service. In 1990, the Department of Labor named Debs a member of its Labor Hall of Fame.

While Debs did not leave a collection of papers to a university library, the pamphlet collection which he and his brother amassed is held by Indiana State University in Terre Haute. The scholar Bernard Brommel, author of a 1978 biography of Debs, has donated his biographical research materials to the Newberry Library in Chicago, where they are open to researchers. The original manuscript of Debs&#x27;s book &quot;Walls and Bars&quot;, with handwritten amendments, presumably by Debs, is held in the Thomas J. Morgan Papers in the special collections department of the University of Chicago Library.

Eugene Township in Lake of the Woods County, Minnesota, was likely named after Debs. The community of Debs in Minnesota&#x27;s Beltrami County may have also been named after him.

Eugene V Debs Hall in Buffalo, NY is a 501(c)7 nonprofit social club; and home to the Eugene V. Debs Local Initiative, a project to document and commemorate Buffalo&#x27;s labor movement history.

Former New York radio station WEVD (now ESPN radio), then owned by the socialist Yiddish newspaper the Jewish Daily Forward, took its call letters from his initials and was known as the &quot;Debs Memorial Station.&quot;

Debs Place, a housing block in Co-op City in the Bronx, New York, was named in his honor. The Eugene V. Debs Cooperative House in Ann Arbor, Michigan, was named after Debs.

Debs School, a one-room schoolhouse built in 1926 in Hinsdale County, Colorado, was named in honor of Debs; the building also served as a community gathering spot for the rural area. Noteworthy for its unique ornamental concrete block construction, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.

There are at least two beers named after Debs, namely Debs&#x27;s Red Ale and Eugene.

The Oregon State Senator Eugene &quot;Debbs&quot; Potts was named in Debs&#x27;s honor.

<text>James Wilson Rouse (April 26, 1914 – April 9, 1996) was an American businessman and founder of The Rouse Company. Rouse was a pioneering American real estate developer, urban planner, civic activist, and later, free enterprise-based philanthropist. He received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award, for his lifetime achievements.

==Early life and education==
James &quot;Jim&quot; Rouse was born in Easton, Maryland, to Lydia Agnes (née Robinson) and Willard Goldsmith Rouse, a canned-foods broker. His father, a lawyer trained at Johns Hopkins University, once ran for state&#x27;s attorney for Harford County. When he lost, the Rouse family moved from Bel Air, Maryland, to Easton. Rouse grew up in Easton (then population: 5,000) on a well-to-do street on the edge of town. He was taught at home by his mother until second grade when he transferred to a public school. In 1930, Rouse lost his father to bladder cancer, his mother to heart failure, and his childhood home to bank foreclosure. His brother Bill paid for him to attend the private preparatory Tome School in Port Deposit, Maryland, for a year.

Facing money problems and unable to continue at the Tome School, the Rouse family sought a way for him to attend college by appealing to his oldest sister, who had married a United States Navy officer stationed in Hawaii. Rouse declared himself his sister&#x27;s dependent and, with Navy connections now secured, was thereby able to attend the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa at a greatly reduced cost. Rouse later attended the University of Virginia. He declared his major as political science and waited tables at a local boarding house. Because he was unable to cover the gap between his scholarship and his remaining expenses, he left Charlottesville and moved to Baltimore to try to make it on his own.

==Career==
He found a job parking cars at the St. Paul Garage for one year. He later remarked that he got the job even though he could not drive, and had convinced his foreman to teach him rather than fire him. In May 1935, Rouse wrote Millard Tydings, who found him a position with the Federal Housing Administration as a clerk specializing in completing FHA loans to eastern Maryland banks. Although he had only two years of undergraduate college on his transcript, in the 1930s that was enough to qualify for law school. He borrowed money in March 1936 from Guy Hollyday who was a loan officer with the Title Guarantee and Trust Company seeking FHA loan guarantees and attended classes three nights a week at the University of Maryland School of Law. He was hired at age 22 by his mentor Hollyday.

While working at the FHA during the New Deal, Rouse was tasked with enforcing racially discriminatory guidelines. Rouse used antisemitic quotas when building in the Roland Park neighborhood of Baltimore. In 1951, Rouse enforced a quota of no more than 12% Jewish residents for the Maryland Apartment in north Baltimore until 75% of the apartments were rented.

Rouse graduated in 1937 and in 1939 left the FHA and became partner with Hunter Moss at a mortgage banking firm called the Moss-Rouse Company funded by a $20,000 loan from Moss&#x27;s sister, which would eventually become the Rouse Company. The company would specialize in FHA backed loans, and hired Churchill G. Carey from Connecticut General, with his former company providing loan capital to Moss-Rouse. Both Moss and Rouse served during WWII, with Moss joining the Marines and Rouse the Navy. Rouse was able to defer duty while his wife was pregnant, shipping out to Hawaii to work on John Henry Towers staff on July 4, 1942. Rouse returned from the war and went back to work with Moss, using his gambling assets. By 1951, the Moss-Rouse Company had become the largest mortgage banking company in the state of Maryland. In 1954, the two partners split, with Moss summarizing the split this way: &quot;[Rouse] was a person who liked to do things in a big way. I liked the smaller company. So we split up.&quot;

As he was growing his business, Rouse pursued various civic activities. He co-founded the Citizens Planning and Housing Association (CPHA) and became involved in Baltimore, Maryland&#x27;s efforts to rehabilitate its decayed housing stock through The Baltimore Plan. The national publicity of this program led to his participation in Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s National Housing Task Force starting in 1953. He introduced (or at least helped popularize) the term &quot;urban renewal&quot; to describe the series of recommendations made by that task force.

===Shopping malls===
In 1958, Rouse built Harundale Mall in Glen Burnie, Maryland, the first enclosed shopping center east of the Mississippi River and the first built by a real estate developer. His company used the term &quot;mall&quot; to describe the development, which was an alternative to the more typical strip malls usually built in the suburbs (the &quot;mall&quot; in &quot;strip mall&quot; came into usage later, after the enclosed mall had been popularized by Rouse&#x27;s company). Although many now attribute the rise of the shopping mall to the decline of the American downtown core, Rouse&#x27;s focus at the time was on the introduction of malls as a form of town center for the suburbs.

His company became an active developer and manager of shopping center and mall properties, even as he shifted focus to new projects which eventually included planned communities and festival marketplaces.

In late 1973, the Columbia project took a downturn as Maryland land developers such as Joel Kline, and politicians such as Governor Marvin Mandel, and Vice President Spiro Agnew were indicted on various charges of corruption related to land speculation. Rouse was indicted for donations to Mandel&#x27;s 1974 campaign which violated campaign contribution limits, but the charges were dropped because they had been brought outside the one-year limit.

Harundale Mall has since been replaced by Harundale Plaza. In 1999, the mall reopened and redeveloped as Harundale Plaza, a strip shopping center. Stores include A.J. Wright, a Super Fresh supermarket, Outback Steakhouse, Hollywood Video, Burlington Coat Factory, and a U.S. Post Office, along with several other typical strip-mall stores. The signature &quot;rock&quot; from Harundale Mall is now at Harundale Plaza.

===Planned communities===
In the 1960s Rouse turned his focus to planned communities. After engaging in a planning exercise for the Pocantico Hills estate of the Rockefellers, Rouse constructed his first planned residential development: the Village of Cross Keys in Baltimore. On June 16, 1961, Rouse bought inside the city from the Baltimore Country Club for $25,000 an acre. Rouse excitedly proclaimed that this undertaking &quot;will be the largest, and potentially most important development in the history of Baltimore.&quot; Rouse hoped that he could bring to the residential field &quot;some of the fresh thinking, good taste and high standards which we believe have marked our shopping center developments.&quot;

Familiar with bad housing in Baltimore and Washington, D.C., Rouse now had an opportunity to demonstrate what housing within a city&#x27;s borders could be like. &quot;There is a real need for residential development,&quot; he said, &quot;in which there is a strong sense of community; a need to feed into the city some of the atmosphere and pace of the small town and village; a need to create a community which can meet as many as possible of the needs of the people who live there; which can bring these people into natural contact with one another; which can produce out of these relationships a spirit and feeling of neighborliness and a rich sense of belonging to a community.&quot; In a city that practiced strict racial segregation, Rouse intended Cross Keys to be open to all who could afford to live there. The development was a mixture of townhouses, garden apartments, a high-rise apartment house designed by Frank Gehry, stores grouped around a village square, and an office complex. By 1970, the Village of Cross Keys had become among the most desirable places to live in the Baltimore area.

While Cross Keys was still under construction, Rouse decided to build a whole new &quot;city.&quot; The creation of Columbia, Maryland, between Baltimore and Washington, D.C., was the greatest adventure of Rouse&#x27;s life. Columbia was the ultimate opportunity: the chance to embody his ideals in a whole new city. For the undertaking that would become Columbia, Rouse turned to his partner in previous projects, the Connecticut General Life Insurance Company (&quot;CG&quot;). At a meeting at company headquarters in Hartford, Rouse made his pitch to CG&#x27;s top real estate and mortgage people and the company&#x27;s chairman of the board, Frazar B. Wilde. The questioning was mostly negative, until Wilde joined in. He expressed the view that CG couldn&#x27;t lose. If Rouse&#x27;s project did not succeed, the land could always be sold, and probably for a higher price than what it cost.

The land for the new city would be owned by a subsidiary called Howard Research and Development Corporation. CG would own half of that corporation and Rouse&#x27;s corporation the other half. Rouse would be responsible for the management of the acquired land and for preparing a master plan for development. CG also put up some of the money for Columbia&#x27;s infrastructure. The rest was supplied by Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association and the Chase Manhattan Bank.

By the end of the summer of 1963 close to of Howard County farmland had been acquired, and the time was at hand to begin planning what to do with it. Rouse wanted to hear from a wide assortment of experts and scholars. He brought together an assemblage which became known as &quot;The Work Group.&quot; It consisted of top people in health, family life, education, recreation, government, transportation, and employment. Ultimately emerging was the idea that the new city should be a real multi-faceted city, not a bedroom suburb. It should be possible for its residents to find everything they needed right there—jobs, education, recreation, health care, and any other necessity.

Rouse was not reluctant to bring up his home town of Easton as a model for Columbia. Consensus formed around the idea that the basic subdivision within the new city should be the village, a unit of 10,000 to 15,000 people. This number was thought to be the most likely to foster a local feeling of identification: for merchants to get to know their customers, ministers their memberships, and teachers their pupils and parents.

Within the city, there would be 12 villages. Each village would have a central gathering place where people of different income levels and types of housing would cross paths and mix. Each village would have a middle school and a high school, a teen center, a supermarket, a library, a hospital, an auditorium, offices, restaurants, some specialty shops, and a few larger recreational facilities. It also would have a multi-denominational house of worship known as an &quot;interfaith center&quot; based on the Gordon Cosby&#x27;s Ecumenical Church of the Savior called the Kittamaqundi Community. The hope was that one building would be used by several religions.

In addition to the villages there would be a core area that would function as the new city&#x27;s &quot;downtown.&quot; Here would be the main cluster of retail stores (arranged as a mall), a hotel and conference center, a hospital, movie theaters and a concert hall, a community college, and branches of the Maryland Institute College of Art and the Peabody Conservatory of Music.

The main entertainment area was to be known as Tivoli, after the entertainment area in Copenhagen. Early on, Rouse said that he hoped Tivoli would be a place &quot;where, under the benign influence of having fun and relaxing in familiar ways, people would have opportunities, especially attractive and conveniently presented, for discovering new ways to enjoy their free time—new foods, new visual and tactile aesthetic experiences, even new social relations.&quot; Rouse wanted the town center in Columbia to provide the most comprehensive range of recreational activities and services that had ever been contemplated in a new town.

The recession of the 1970s hit Columbia hard, and CG had to refinance the project, reducing The Rouse Company&#x27;s stake. CG later pulled out of the project completely in 1985, but by that time it had returned to profitability.

===Festival marketplaces===
Rouse shifted focus from suburban retail to urban malls, which he called &quot;festival marketplaces,&quot; of which the Faneuil Hall Marketplace was the first and most successful example. Completed in 1976, and partly funded with assistance from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Faneuil Hall Marketplace (comprising Quincy Market and other spaces adjacent to Boston&#x27;s Faneuil Hall) was designed by architect Benjamin C. Thompson and was a financial success, an act of historic preservation, and an anchor for urban revitalization. Later the Boston Museum of Fine Arts established an annex at the Quincy Market, and the mall generated more foot traffic than the museum. Initially, there were critics who predicted the project would fail, while other dismissed its early success as a fad. Calvin Trillin and Peter Hall each invoked Disneyland in their claims that Faneuil Hall Marketplace was an example of fake urbanism. Robert Campbell, an architecture critic, rejected this kind of criticism as snobbery, and claimed that the festival marketplace was effective at getting people out of their cars and getting them to experience the city. In his planning for the project, Rouse imagined that people would not just shop, that they would also be entertained. However, he later claimed that he had not anticipated its popularity as a tour bus destination.

Other examples of Rouse Company &quot;festival marketplace&quot; developments include South Street Seaport in New York City, The Gallery at Market East, in Philadelphia, Harborplace in Baltimore, St. Louis Union Station in St. Louis, Downtown Portland&#x27;s Pioneer Place, and the Riverwalk Marketplace of New Orleans. The early festival marketplaces like Faneuil Hall and Harborplace led &quot;TIME&quot; magazine to dub Rouse &quot;the man who made cities fun again.&quot;

===Retirement===
After 40 years at the Rouse Company, Rouse retired from day-to-day management in 1979. Soon afterwards, he and his wife founded the Enterprise Community Partners, a not-for-profit foundation funded in part by a for-profit subsidiary, The Enterprise Development Company, and focused on seeding partnerships with community groups that would address the need for affordable housing and associated social services for poor neighborhoods. In 1984, Jim Rouse was soliciting business representing both Rouse Company as CEO and Enterprise Development as president. The Rouse Company board of directors asked Jim Rouse to leave as CEO of the Rouse Company and his position in Enterprise Development which ended his involvement with the company he founded.

Rouse was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1981. In 1988, Rouse was awarded the second Honor Award from the National Building Museum.

The Rouse Theatre in Wilde Lake High School is named after James. In May 2006, an approximately four-mile stretch of Maryland Route 175 between Interstate 95 and U.S. Route 29 in Columbia, Maryland, was named after Rouse and his wife, Patty. The Jim Rouse Visionary Center opened in 2006 in a formerly contaminated Whiskey Warehouse in Baltimore.

==Awards==
In 1978, Rouse received the S. Roger Horchow Award for Greatest Public Service by a Private Citizen, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards.

In 1981, Rouse received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

In 1995, Rouse was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Bill Clinton.

==Personal life==
James Rouse&#x27;s first wife was Elizabeth Jamieson &quot;Libby&quot; (née Winstead) whom he married on May 3, 1941. His daughter Robin is the mother of actor Edward Norton. His son Jim applied for conscientious objector status during the Vietnam War with his father&#x27;s support. In May 1970, Rouse posted full page anti-war ads in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and later &quot;The New York Times&quot; that upset the new Nixon administration. Rouse separated from Libby in 1973, and married Myrtle Patricia &quot;Patty&quot; Traugott, from Norfolk, Virginia, in November 1974. He died of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis on April 9, 1996. Patty Rouse died on March 5, 2012.

Rouse&#x27;s nephew, Willard Rouse III, was also a real estate developer.

==Homage==
His grandson Edward Norton, upon graduating from Yale University in 1991, moved to Japan to work for the Rouses&#x27; foundation. Later, Norton directed the film &quot;Motherless Brooklyn&quot;, released in 2019, &quot;as an homage to the things [James Rouse] cared about&quot;. In particular, the movie denounces the controversial urbanist Robert Moses, accused of lust for power, questionable ethics, vindictiveness, and racism.

<text>Oakland is a city in the East Bay region of the San Francisco Bay Area in the U.S. state of California. It is the county seat and most populous city in Alameda County, with a population of 440,646 in 2020. A major West Coast port, Oakland is the most populous city in the East Bay, the third most populous city in the Bay Area, and the eighth most populous city in California. It serves as the Bay Area&#x27;s trade center: the Port of Oakland is the busiest port in Northern California, and the fifth- or sixth-busiest in the United States. A charter city, Oakland was incorporated on May 4, 1852, in the wake of the state&#x27;s increasing population due to the California gold rush.

Oakland&#x27;s territory covers what was once a mosaic of California coastal terrace prairie, oak woodland, and north coastal scrub. In the late 18th century, it became part of a large &quot;rancho&quot; grant in the colony of New Spain, and was known for its plentiful oak tree stands. Its land served as a resource when its hillside oak and redwood timber were logged to build San Francisco. The fertile flatland soils helped it become a prolific agricultural region. In the 1850s, what became the first campus of the University of California was founded in Oakland, and Oakland was selected as the western terminal of the Transcontinental Railroad in 1869. The following year, Oakland&#x27;s Lake Merritt became the United States&#x27; first officially designated wildlife refuge, now a National Historic Landmark. Following the catastrophic 1906 San Francisco earthquake, many San Francisco citizens moved to Oakland, enlarging the population, increasing its housing stock, and improving its infrastructure. It continued to grow in the 20th century with its port, shipyards, and manufacturing industry. In the 21st century, between 2019 and 2023, after the city and county refused requests for hundreds of millions of dollars in benefits to the privately owned teams, Oakland lost three teams of the major North American sports leagues within a span of five years.

==History==

===Ohlone era ===
The earliest known inhabitants of the area were the Huchiun natives, who lived there for thousands of years. The Huchiun belonged to a linguistic grouping later called the Ohlone (a Miwok word meaning &quot;western people&quot;). In Oakland, they were concentrated around Lake Merritt and Temescal Creek, a stream that enters the San Francisco Bay at Emeryville.

===Spanish and Mexican eras===

In 1772, the area that later became Oakland was colonized, along with the rest of California, by Spanish settlers for the king of Spain. In the early 19th century, the Spanish crown granted the East Bay area to Luis María Peralta for his Rancho San Antonio. The grant was confirmed by the successor Mexican republic upon its independence from Spain. Upon his death in 1842, Peralta divided his land among his four sons. Most of Oakland was within the shares given to Antonio Maria and Vicente. The portion of the parcel that is now Oakland was called &quot;Encinar&quot; (misrendered at an early date and carried forward as &quot;encinal&quot;) – Spanish for &quot;oak grove&quot; – due to the large oak forest that covered the area, which eventually led to the city&#x27;s name.

According to Stanford University historian Albert Camarillo, the Peralta family struggled to keep their land after the incorporation of California into the United States after the Mexican–American War. Camarillo claims the family was the victim of targeted racial violence. He writes in &quot;Chicanos in California&quot;, &quot;They lost everything when squatters cut down their fruit trees, killed their cattle, destroyed their buildings, and even fenced off the roads leading to the rancho. Especially insidious were the actions of attorney Horace Carpentier, who tricked Vicente Peralta into signing a &#x27;lease&#x27; which turned out to be a mortgage against the 19,000-acre rancho. The lands became Carpentier&#x27;s when Peralta refused to repay the loan he believed was fraudulently incurred. The Peraltas had no choice but to abandon the homesite they had occupied for two generations.&quot;

===City beginnings===

In 1851, three men—Horace Carpentier, Edson Adams, and Andrew Moon—began developing what is now downtown Oakland. In 1852, the Town of Oakland was incorporated by the state legislature. During this time, Oakland had 75–100 inhabitants, two hotels, a wharf, two warehouses, and only cattle trails. Two years later, on March 25, 1854, Oakland re-incorporated as the City of Oakland. Horace Carpentier was elected the first mayor, though a scandal ended his mayorship in less than a year. In 1853, a preparatory academy was founded in Oakland that soon became the College of California, and in 1869, the first campus of the University of California. The university moved just north to Berkeley in the 1870s.

During the 1850s, just as gold was discovered in California, Oakland started growing and further developing because land was becoming too expensive in San Francisco. People in China were struggling financially as a result of the First Opium War, the Second Opium War, and the Taiping Rebellion, so they began migrating to Oakland, many of whom were recruited to work on railroads. However, the Chinese struggled to settle because they were discriminated against by the white community and their living quarters were burned down on several occasions.

The city and its environs quickly grew with the railroads, becoming a major rail terminal in the late 1860s and 1870s. In 1868, the Central Pacific constructed the Oakland Long Wharf at Oakland Point, the site of today&#x27;s Port of Oakland.

A number of horsecar and cable car lines were constructed in Oakland during the latter half of the 19th century. The first electric streetcar set out from Oakland to Berkeley in 1891, and other lines were converted and added over the course of the 1890s. The various streetcar companies operating in Oakland were acquired by Francis &quot;Borax&quot; Smith and consolidated into what eventually became known as the Key System, the predecessor of today&#x27;s publicly owned AC Transit.

===1900–1950s===

Oakland was one of the worst affected cities in California that was impacted by the San Francisco plague of 1900–1904. Quarantine measures were set in place at the Oakland ports requiring the authorities at the port to inspect the arriving vessels for the presence of infected rats. Quarantine authorities at these ports inspected over a thousand vessels per year for plague and yellow fever. By 1908, over 5,000 people were detained in quarantine. Hunters were sent to poison the affected areas in Oakland and shoot the squirrels, but the eradication work was limited in its range because the State Board of Health and the United States Public Health Service were only allotted about $60,000 a year to eradicate the disease. During this period Oakland did not have sufficient health facilities, so some of the infected patients were treated at home.

The State Board of Health along with Oakland also advised physicians to promptly report any cases of infected patients. Yet, in 1919 it still resulted in a small epidemic of Pneumonic plague which killed a dozen people in Oakland. This started when a man went hunting in Contra Costa Valley and killed a squirrel. After eating the squirrel, he fell ill four days later and another household member contracted the plague. This in turn was passed on either directly or indirectly to about a dozen others. The officials in Oakland acted quickly by issuing death certificates to monitor the spread of plague.

==== Incorporation ====
At the time of incorporation in 1852, Oakland had consisted of the territory that lay south of today&#x27;s major intersection of San Pablo Avenue, Broadway, and Fourteenth Street. The city gradually annexed farmlands and settlements to the east and the north. Oakland&#x27;s rise to industrial prominence, and its subsequent need for a seaport, led to the digging of a shipping and tidal channel in 1902. This resulted in the nearby town of Alameda being made an island. In 1906, the city&#x27;s population doubled with refugees made homeless after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire.

In 1908, the lawyer, former miner, and newspaper owner Homer Wood (1880–1976) suggested to his friend Frank Bilger of Blake and Bilger Rock Quarry and Paving Company that he organize a gathering to establish a Rotary Club east of the bay. On November 27, 1908, Homer took a ferry across the bay in a driving rainstorm and met for lunch with Frank and twenty three other businessmen at the Hotel Metropole at 13th and Jefferson. This gathering became the first meeting of the Tri-City Rotary Club, renamed in 1911 The Rotary Club of Oakland, the third Rotary Club in the world. This group established the tradition of weekly meetings, something most clubs worldwide follow today.

In 1917, General Motors opened an automobile factory in East Oakland called Oakland Assembly. It produced Chevrolet cars and then GMC trucks until 1963, when it was moved to Fremont in southern Alameda County. Also in 1916, the Fageol Motor Company chose East Oakland for their first factory, manufacturing farming tractors from 1918 to 1923. By 1920, Oakland was the home of numerous manufacturing industries, including metals, canneries, bakeries, internal combustion engines, automobiles, and shipbuilding. By 1929, when Chrysler expanded with a new plant there, Oakland had become known as the &quot;Detroit of the West,&quot; referring to the major auto manufacturing center in Michigan.
Oakland expanded during the 1920s, as its population expanded with factory workers. Approximately 13,000 homes were built in the 3 years between 1921 and 1924, more than during the 13 years between 1907 and 1920. Many of the large downtown office buildings, apartment buildings, and single-family houses still standing in Oakland were built during the 1920s; they reflect the architectural styles of the time.


Russell Clifford Durant established Durant Field at 82nd Avenue and East 14th Street in 1916. The first transcontinental airmail flight finished its journey at Durant Field on August 9, 1920, flown by Army Capt. Eddie Rickenbacker and Navy Lt. Bert Acosta. Durant Field was often called Oakland Airport, though the current Oakland International Airport was soon established to the southwest.

During World War II, the East Bay Area was home to many war-related industries. Oakland&#x27;s Moore Dry Dock Company expanded its shipbuilding capabilities and built over 100 ships. Valued at $100 million in 1943, Oakland&#x27;s canning industry was its second-most-valuable war contribution after shipbuilding. The largest canneries were in the Fruitvale District, and included the Josiah Lusk Canning Company, the Oakland Preserving Company (which started the Del Monte brand), and the California Packing Company.

President Franklin D. Roosevelt called on defense industries with government contracts to integrate their workforces and provide opportunities for all Americans. Tens of thousands of laborers came from around the country, especially poor whites and blacks from the Deep South: Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Texas, as well as Missouri and Tennessee. Henry J. Kaiser&#x27;s representatives recruited sharecroppers and tenant farmers from rural areas to work in his shipyards. African Americans were part of the Great Migration by which five million persons left the South, mostly for the West, from 1940 to 1970. White migrants from the Jim Crow South carried their racial attitudes, causing tensions to rise among black and white workers competing for better-paying jobs in the Bay Area. The racial harmony Oakland African-Americans had been accustomed to prior to the war evaporated. Also migrating to the area during this time were many Mexican Americans from southwestern states such as New Mexico, Texas, and Colorado. Many worked for the Southern Pacific Railroad, at its major rail yard in West Oakland. Their young men encountered hostility and discrimination by Armed Forces personnel, and tensions broke out in &quot;zoot suit riots&quot; in downtown Oakland in 1943 in the wake of a major disturbance in Los Angeles that year.

In 1946, National City Lines (NCL), a General Motors holding company, acquired 64% of Key System stock; during the next several years NCL engaged in the conspiratorial dissolution of Oakland&#x27;s electric streetcar system. The city&#x27;s expensive electric streetcar fleet was converted to cheaper diesel buses. The state Legislature created the Alameda and Contra Costa Transit District in 1955, which operates today as AC Transit, the third-largest bus-only transit system in the nation.

After the war, as Oakland&#x27;s shipbuilding industry declined and the automobile industry went through restructuring, many jobs were lost. In addition, labor unrest increased as workers struggled to protect their livelihoods. Oakland was the center of a general strike during the first week of December 1946, one of six cities across the country that had such a strike after World War II.

The Mary&#x27;s First and Last Chance in Oakland was a lesbian bar, once the focus of the 1950s California Supreme Court lawsuit Vallerga v. Dept. Alcoholic Bev. Control, when the bar challenged a state law for the right to serve gay patrons and won in 1959.

===1960–1999===

In 1960, Kaiser Corporation opened its new headquarters; it was the largest skyscraper in Oakland, as well as &quot;the largest office tower west of Chicago&quot; up to that time. In the postwar period, suburban development increased around Oakland, and wealthier residents moved to new housing. Despite the major increases in the number and proportion of African Americans in the city, in 1966 only 16 of the city&#x27;s 661 police officers were black. Tensions between the black community and the largely white police force were high, as expectations during the civil rights era increased to gain social justice and equality before the law. Police abuse of blacks was common.

Students Huey Newton and Bobby Seale founded the Black Panther Party at Merritt College (then located at a former high school on Grove Street, now occupied by Children&#x27;s Hospital Oakland Research Institute), which emphasized Black nationalism, advocated armed self-defense against police, and was involved in several incidents that ended in the deaths of police officers and other Black Panther members. Among their social programs were feeding children and providing other services to the needy.

As in many other American cities during the 1980s, crack cocaine became a serious problem in Oakland. Drug dealing in general, and the dealing of crack cocaine in particular, resulted in elevated rates of violent crime, causing Oakland to consistently be listed as one of America&#x27;s most crime-ridden cities.

In 1980, Oakland&#x27;s Black population reached its 20th-century peak at approximately 47% of the overall city population.

The 6.9 Loma Prieta earthquake occurred on October 17, 1989. The rupture was related to the San Andreas fault system and affected the entire San Francisco Bay Area with a maximum Mercalli intensity of IX (&quot;Violent&quot;). Many structures in Oakland were badly damaged including the double-decker portion of Interstate 880 that collapsed. The eastern span of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge also sustained damage and was closed to traffic for one month.

On October 20, 1991, a massive firestorm swept down from the Berkeley/Oakland hills above the Caldecott Tunnel. Twenty-five people were killed, 150 people were injured, and nearly 4,000 homes destroyed. With the loss of life and an estimated economic loss of 1.5 billion, this was the worst urban firestorm in American history, until 2017.

During the mid-1990s, Oakland&#x27;s economy began to recover as it transitioned to new types of jobs. In addition, the city participated in large development and urban renewal projects, concentrated especially in the downtown area, at the Port of Oakland, and at the Oakland International Airport.

===21st century===

After his 1999 inauguration, Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown continued his predecessor Elihu Harris&#x27; public policy of supporting downtown housing development in the area defined as the Central Business District in Oakland&#x27;s 1998 General Plan. Brown&#x27;s plan and other redevelopment projects were controversial due to potential rent increases and gentrification, which would displace lower-income residents from downtown Oakland into outlying neighborhoods and cities.

Due to allegations of misconduct by the Oakland Police Department, the City of Oakland has paid claims for a total of 57 million during the 2001–2011 timeframe to plaintiffs claiming police abuse; this is the largest sum paid by any city in California. On October 10, 2011, protesters and civic activists began &quot;Occupy Oakland&quot; demonstrations at Frank Ogawa Plaza in Downtown Oakland.

African-Americans dropped to 28% of Oakland&#x27;s population in 2010, from nearly half in 1980, due to fast-rising rents and an extreme housing crisis in the region.

The city inspected warehouses and live/work spaces after a fire broke out in the Ghost Ship warehouse, killing 36 people in 2016.

Oakland is the second U.S. city, after Denver, to decriminalize psilocybin mushrooms. In June 2019, the City Council passed the resolution in a unanimous vote ending the investigation and imposition of criminal penalties for use and possession of natural entheogens.

In November 2019, two homeless mothers and their children moved into a vacant three-bedroom house in West Oakland. The group, calling themselves Moms 4 Housing, said their goal was to protest what they said was a large number of vacant houses in Oakland owned by redevelopment companies while the city experienced a housing crisis. Two months later they were evicted from the house by three dozen sheriff&#x27;s deputies, as hundreds of supporters demonstrated in favor of the women. The incident received nationwide coverage. The company that owns the house later said they would sell it to a nonprofit affordable housing group. As of 2019, Oakland&#x27;s per-capita homeless rate was higher than San Francisco and Berkeley. Between 2014 and 2020, Oakland strengthened its protections for tenants in order to reduce the displacement of its long-time residents. Between January 2020 and March 2022, Oakland suffered a disproportionate death toll from the COVID-19 pandemic and Delta cron hybrid variant within the San Francisco Bay Area.

In 2023, prior to and during the Covid pandemic, Oakland became the first city in American history to lose three professional major league sports teams to other cities within a span of five years.

==Geography==

Oakland is in the eastern region of the San Francisco Bay.

The United States Census Bureau says the city&#x27;s total area is , including of land and (28.48 percent) of water.

Oakland&#x27;s highest point is near Grizzly Peak Blvd, east of Berkeley, just over above sea level at about . Oakland has of shoreline, but Radio Beach is the only beach in Oakland.

Oaklanders refer to their city&#x27;s terrain as &quot;the flatlands&quot; and &quot;the hills&quot;. Until recent waves of gentrification, these terms also symbolized Oakland&#x27;s deep economic divide, with &quot;the hills&quot; being more affluent communities. About two-thirds of Oakland lies in the flat plain of the East Bay, with one-third rising into the foothills and hills of the East Bay range.

Ruptures along the nearby San Andreas Fault caused severe earth movement in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1906 and 1989. San Andreas quakes induces creep (movement occurring on earthquake faults) in the Hayward fault, which runs directly through Oakland, Berkeley, San Jose and other Bay Area cities.

===Neighborhoods===


Oakland has more than 50 distinct neighborhoods. The city&#x27;s greater divisions include downtown Oakland and its greater Central Business District, Lake Merritt, East Oakland, North Oakland, West Oakland, and the Oakland Hills. East Oakland, which includes the East Oakland Hills, encompasses more than half of Oakland&#x27;s land area, stretching from Lakeshore Avenue on the east shore of Lake Merritt southeast to the San Leandro border. North Oakland encompasses the neighborhoods between downtown and Berkeley and Emeryville. West Oakland is the area between downtown and the Bay, partially surrounded by the Oakland Point, and encompassing the Port of Oakland. In 2011, Oakland was ranked the tenth most walkable city in the United States by Walk Score.
Lake Merritt, an urban estuary near downtown, is a mix of fresh and salt water draining in and out from the Oakland Harbor at the San Francisco Bay and one of Oakland&#x27;s most notable features. It was designated the United States&#x27; first official wildlife refuge in 1870. Originally a marsh-lined wildlife haven, Lake Merritt was dredged and bordered with parks from the 1890s to the 1910s. Despite this reduction in habitat, Oakland is home to a number of rare and endangered species, many of which are localized to serpentine soils and bedrock. Lake Merritt is surrounded by residential and business districts, including downtown and Grand Lake.

The city of Piedmont, incorporated in Oakland&#x27;s central foothills after the 1906 earthquake, is a small independent city surrounded by the city of Oakland.

===Climate===

Oakland has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Csb&quot;) with an average of 260 sunny days per year. In general, the city features warm, dry summers, and cool, wet winters.

Based on data gathered by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Oakland is ranked No. 1 in climate among U.S. cities. Oakland&#x27;s climate is typified by the temperate and seasonal Mediterranean climate. Summers are usually dry and warm and winters are cool and damp. It has features found in both nearby coastal cities such as San Francisco and inland cities such as San Jose, making it warmer than San Francisco and cooler than San Jose. Its position on San Francisco Bay across from the Bay Bridge means the northern part of the city can have cooling maritime fog. It is far enough inland that the fog often burns off by midday, allowing it to have typically sunny California days. The hills tend to have more fog than the flatlands, as the fog drifts down from Berkeley.

The U.S. Weather Bureau kept weather records in downtown Oakland from October 4, 1894, to July 31, 1958. During that time, the record high temperature was on June 24, 1957, and the record low temperature was on January 23, 1949. Dry, warm offshore &quot;Diablo&quot; winds (similar to the Santa Ana winds of Southern California) sometimes occur, especially in fall, and raise the fire danger. In 1991, such an episode allowed the catastrophic Oakland Hills fire to spread and consume many homes.
Oakland, like much of Northern California, is susceptible to winter rainstorms and Atmospheric rivers. The wettest &quot;rain year&quot; was from July 1997 to June 1998 with and the driest from July 2020 to June 2021 with . The most rainfall in one month was in January 1911. The most rainfall in 24 hours was on December 31, 2022. Rainfall near the bayfront is only , but is higher in the Oakland Hills to the east (up to ), with nearly all precipitation falling between November and April. While measurable amounts of snowfall in Oakland at sea level is very rare, light snow accumulates on the ground the higher elevations of the Oakland hills with more regularity.

Overnight lows are mild. Oakland seldom experiences warm nights with the warmest recorded night of in September 1971 and an average of for the annual warmest low. The coldest day of the year averages a mild and has never been recorded below .

The National Weather Service today has two official weather stations in Oakland: Oakland International Airport and the Oakland Museum (established 1970).

===Vegetation===
The higher rainfall in the hills supports woods of oak, madrona, pine, fir and a few redwood groves in the wetter areas. Before being logged in the 19th century, some of the tallest redwood trees in California (used for navigation by ships entering the Golden Gate) may have stood in the Oakland Hills. One old stump in diameter can be seen near Redwood Regional Park. Sunny, drier slopes are grassy or covered in scattered oaks and chaparral brush. Australian eucalyptus trees have been extensively planted in many areas, as they come from a similar climate.

==Demographics==
The 2020 United States census reported Oakland had a population of 440,646. The population density was .

=== Religion ===
34.95% of people in Oakland are affiliated with a religion, in a total of 417 congregations.

Major places of worship in Oakland include – 

===Race and ethnicity===

===2022 United States Census Bureau American Community Survey estimates===
According to 2022 US Census Bureau estimates, Oakland&#x27;s population declined to 430,531, and was 31.1% White (29.7% Non-Hispanic White and 1.5% Hispanic White), 20.6% Black or African American, 1.3% Native American and Alaskan Native, 15.9% Asian, 0.3% Pacific Islander, 19.6% Other Race, and 11.3% from two or more races.

White Americans are the largest racial/ethnic group at either 31.1% (including White Hispanics) or 29.7% (excluding White Hispanics).

Hispanics have been the second largest ethnic group since 2012 when they displaced the Black population. However, Black Americans still form the second largest racial group. By ethnicity, 26.8% of the total population is Hispanic-Latino (of any race) and 73.2% is Non-Hispanic (of any race). The majority of Hispanics self-identify as Some Other Race (69.3%) with the remainder choosing White (5.4%), Multiracial (19.2%), Black (1.6%), American Indian and Alaskan Native (3.8%), Asian (0.7%), and Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (0.1%).

The Black population is the third largest ethnic group and second largest racial group at either 20.6% (including Black Hispanics) or 20.1% excluding Black Hispanics.

The Asian population continues to remain the fourth largest group at 15.9% of the population.

5.1% are of English ancestry, French (except Basque), 1.4% German, 6.1% Irish - 6.2% Italian, 3.1% Norwegian, 1.1% Polish - 1.7% Scottish and 1.0%Subsaharan African 2.5%.

The most common ancestries in Oakland are German, Irish, English, Italian and European. Spanish and Chinese are the most common non-English spoken languages.

===Educational attainment and income===

The greater Oakland area has the fifth largest cluster of &quot;elite zip codes&quot; ranked by the number of households with the highest combination of income and education. 37.9% of residents over 25 years of age have bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher. Oakland ranked among the top cities with residents with bachelor&#x27;s degrees and graduate degrees per square mile.

Oakland ranks in the top 20 of American cities in median household income, with a 2012 value of 51,863. In 2012, the median income for a household in the city was 51,863 and the median income for a family was 59,459. The mean income for a household was 77,888 and the mean income for a family was 90,948. Males had a median income of 50,140 versus 50,304 for females. The unemployment rate as of December 2013 was 9.7%.

In 2007 approximately 15.3 percent of families and 17.0 percent of the general population were below the poverty line, including 27.9 percent of those under age 18 and 13.1 percent of those age 65 or over. 0.7% of the population is homeless. Home ownership is 41% and 14% of rental units are subsidized.

As of the census of 2000, 19.4% of the population and 16.2% of families were below the poverty line. Out of the total population, 27.9% of those under the age of 18 and 13.1% of those 65 and older were living below the poverty line.

===Households===

The census reported 382,586 people (97.9% of the population) lived in households, 5,675 (1.5%) lived in non-institutionalized group quarters, and 2,463 (0.6%) were institutionalized.

There were 153,791 households, out of which 44,762 (29.1%) had children under the age of 18 living in them, 50,797 (33.0%) were opposite-sex married couples living together, 24,122 (15.7%) had a female householder with no husband present, 8,799 (5.7%) had a male householder with no wife present.

===Shifting of cultures===

Oakland has consistently ranked as one of the most ethnically diverse major cities in the country. A 2019 analysis by WalletHub showed that Oakland was the most ethnoracially diverse city in the United States. The city&#x27;s formerly most populous ethnic group, whites, declined from 95.3% in 1940 to 32.5% by 1990, due to a combination of factors, including suburbanization. Oakland became a destination for African Americans in the Great Migration during and after World War II as they gained high-paying jobs in the defense industry. Blacks have formed a plurality in Oakland for many years, peaking in 1980 at about 47% of the population.

Oakland&#x27;s Black population decreased by nearly 25 percent between 2000 and 2010. The city&#x27;s demographics have changed due to a combination of rising housing prices associated with gentrification and with blacks relocating to better (and in many cases more affordable) housing in Bay Area suburbs or moving to the Southern United States in a reverse migration, where conditions (including race relations) are considered to have improved in comparison to previous generations. These trends and cultural shifts have led to a decline among some of Oakland&#x27;s long standing black institutions, such as churches, businesses and nightclubs, which had developed during the growing years of the 1950s through 1970.

In the 2010 census African Americans maintained their status as Oakland&#x27;s single largest ethnic group, with 27% of the population, followed by non-Hispanic whites at 25.9%, and Hispanics of any race at 25.4%. Ethnic Asians constitute 17%, followed by smaller minority groups.

Many immigrants have settled in the city. Immigrants and others have marched by the thousands down Oakland&#x27;s International Boulevard in support of legal reforms benefiting undocumented immigrants.

An analysis by the Urban Institute of U.S. Census 2000 numbers showed Oakland had the third-highest concentration of gays and lesbians among the 50 largest U.S. cities, behind San Francisco and Seattle. Census data showed that among incorporated places that have at least 500 female couples, Oakland had the nation&#x27;s largest proportion. In the 2000 census, 2,650 lesbian couples identified as such in Oakland; one in every 41 Oakland couples identified as a same-sex female partnership.

=== Gentrification ===
As of 2020, the San Francisco-Oakland Metro shows indications of having the greatest intensity of gentrification nationally, with over 31% of eligible neighborhoods gentrifying. Gentrifying neighborhoods showed significant increases in median home value, median household income, percentage of college educated residents, but also in economic inequality.

Historically low-income neighborhoods have been rapidly changed by new, higher-income residents as high-wage tech workers and expensive housing have continued to push lower-wage residents out of Oakland. In West Oakland, for example, median household income rose from $80,700 to $86,300 between 2010 and 2017, while the percent of population with four-year degrees rose from one-third to nearly one-half, according to the National Community Reinvestment Coalition.

Big tech companies have continued to transform the communities and culture of Oakland as modern apartments have appeared, housing prices have spiked, and many prior working-class residents have moved to suburbs further inland.

According to 2015 data compiled by the Bay Area Equity Atlas, 91% of low-income households of color were either in neighborhoods that were gentrifying or were at risk of gentrification at the time. The number was higher for individual low-income communities, with 96% of Native American households in neighborhoods that either experienced gentrification or were at risk of being gentrified, followed by Latino households at 94%, Black households at 92%, and Asian or Pacific Islander households at 88%.

===Crime===
A 2014 study by the Chief Justice Earl Warren Institute on Law &amp; Social Policy at the University of California, Berkeley School of Law examined crime in the city from 1987 to 2012 and concluded that &quot;The story of crime in Oakland over the last 25 years is a nuanced one, as there are both positive and negative aspects of the crime trends.&quot; Crime dramatically decreased since the early 1990s but the city has continued to suffer from serious violent crime problems. Crime trends generally tracked comparison cities of Fresno, Richmond, Sacramento, and Stockton &quot;in terms of direction if not magnitude&quot;; this suggested that crime trends are regional rather than city-specific.

A 2007 journal article identified crime in Oakland as being fueled by the dramatic increase of street narcotics sales and use since the 1970s, with Oakland becoming a major west-coast hub for heroin and cocaine distribution. Subsequent battle for control over the lucrative narcotics trade incited gang conflicts and violence, with shootings becoming a regular occurrence. A concurrent rise in rape, robbery, burglary, auto-theft and other crimes occurred as well. Prior to 1960, there had been successful government-funded social programs whereby rebellious teens were enrolled in youth centers that would teach them proper values and improve their behavior. Similar programs since then have been inconsistent.

By the 1970s, the police and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) used military tactics such as SWAT teams, infiltration and counter intelligence in an attempt to counter groups such as the Black Panthers (responsible for several police ambushes), the S.L.A. and organized drug gangs such as the &quot;69 Mob&quot;, with increases in arrests, prosecutions, and imprisonment. During the first decade of the 21st century, Oakland has consistently been listed as one of the most dangerous large cities in the United States.

The number of Oakland Police Department officers has varied from a low of 626 (in 1996 and in 2012) to a high of 814 (in 2002). There were 723 officers at the end of 2015. The city&#x27;s strategic plan recommended 925 officers, and an independent study commissioned by the city in the mid-1990s recommended 1,200 officers.

Among Oakland&#x27;s 35 police patrol beats, violent crime remains a serious problem in specific East and West Oakland neighborhoods. In 2008, homicides were concentrated: 72% occurred in three City Council districts, District 3 in West Oakland and Districts 6 and 7 in East Oakland, although these districts have 44% of Oakland&#x27;s residents.

In 2012, Oakland implemented Operation Ceasefire, a gang violence reduction plan used in other cities, based in part on the research and strategies of author David M. Kennedy.

==Economy==


Oakland is a major West Coast port, and the fifth-busiest in the United States by cargo volume. The Port of Oakland handles 99% of all containerized goods moving through Northern California, representing $41 billion worth of international trade. There are nearly 200,000 jobs related to marine cargo transport in the Oakland area. These jobs range from minimum wage hourly positions to Transportation Storage and Distribution Managers who earn an annual average salary of 91,520.

The Port of Oakland was an early innovator/pioneer in the technologies of Intermodal Containerized Shipping. The city is also home to several major corporations including Kaiser Permanente, Clorox, and Dreyer&#x27;s ice cream. Tech companies such as Ask.com and Pandora Radio are in Oakland, and in recent years many start-up high tech and green energy companies have found a home in the downtown neighborhoods of Uptown, City Center, Jack London Square and Lake Merritt Financial District.

, the San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward metropolitan area has a gross domestic product (GDP) of 360.4 billion, ranking eighth among metropolitan areas in the United States. In 2014, Oakland was amongst the best cities to start a career, the highest ranked city in California after San Francisco. Additionally, Oakland ranked fourth in cities with professional opportunities. Numerous companies in San Francisco continue to expand in or migrate over to Oakland.

Oakland experienced an increase of both its population and of land values in the early-to-mid first decade of the 21st century. The 10k Plan, which began during former mayor Elihu Harris&#x27; administration, and intensified during former mayor Jerry Brown&#x27;s administration resulted in several thousand units of new multi-family housing and development. In 2023, Oakland became the first American city ever to lose three professional major league sports teams to other cities within a five-year span.

===Top employers===

, the top employers in the city were:

===Tourism===

In 2013, over 2.5 million people visited Oakland, contributed 1.3 billion into the economy. Oakland has been experiencing an increase in hotel demand. Occupancy is 74%, while RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room) increased by 14%, the highest increase of any big city in the western region of the United States.

Recent years have seen the growth of the Oakland Art Murmur event, occurring in the Uptown neighborhood the first Friday evening of every month. The event attracts around 20,000 people along twenty city blocks, featuring live performances, food trucks, and over 30 galleries and venues.

===&quot;There is no there there&quot;===

Gertrude Stein wrote about Oakland in her 1937 book &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Autobiography&quot; &quot;There is no there there&quot;, upon learning that the neighborhood where she lived as a child had been torn down to make way for an industrial park. The quote is usually misconstrued to refer to Oakland as a whole.

Modern-day Oakland has made steps to rebuke Stein&#x27;s claim with a statue downtown titled &quot;There&quot;. In 2005 a sculpture called &quot;HERETHERE&quot; was installed by the City of Berkeley on the Berkeley-Oakland border at Martin Luther King Jr. Way. The sculpture consists of eight-foot-tall letters spelling &quot;HERE&quot; and &quot;THERE&quot; in front of the BART tracks as they descend from their elevated section in Oakland to the subway through Berkeley.

==Sports==

Formerly based at the Oakland Coliseum, the Oakland Athletics announced plans to move to Las Vegas to play at a new 33,000-seat partially retractable ballpark on the Las Vegas Strip with the team itself spending three seasons at Sutter Health Park in West Sacramento as a temporary home. The move leaves Oakland without a major professional sports team for the first time since 1959.

The Warriors, whose primary owners reside in Southern California, announced in April 2014 that they would leave Oakland once their new arena was built across the Bay in San Francisco. In 2019, the Warriors built and moved to Chase Center across the Bay. Since the team remained in the Bay Area, they decided not to revert to the San Francisco Warriors name it had in its first stint with the city.

The Oakland Roots SC are a professional soccer team that was formed in 2018. The Roots began play in 2019 in a new third division professional league known as the National Independent Soccer Association, however, the team announced that it would move into the second division of US professional soccer, and play in the USL Championship beginning in the 2021 season. The Roots play their home matches at Oakland Coliseum.

Oakland&#x27;s former hockey team, the California Golden Seals were a professional ice hockey club that competed in the National Hockey League (NHL) from 1967 to 1976. Based in Oakland, they played their home games at the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum Arena. The Seals were one of six teams added to the league as part of the 1967 NHL expansion. Initially named the California Seals, the team was renamed the Oakland Seals during the 1967–68 season and then the Bay Area Seals in 1970 before becoming the California Golden Seals the same year.
The Seals were the least successful of the teams added in the 1967 expansion, never earning a winning record and only making the playoffs twice in nine seasons of play. Off the ice, they were plagued by low attendance. The franchise was relocated prior to the beginning of the 1976–77 season to become the Cleveland Barons, who would cease operation two years later.

Oakland has a mayor-council government. The mayor is elected at-large for a four-year term. The Oakland City Council has eight council members representing seven districts in Oakland with one member elected at-large and others from single-member districts; council members serve staggered four-year terms. The mayor appoints a city administrator, subject to the confirmation by the City Council, who is the city&#x27;s chief administrative officer.

There are no term limits for the city council.

Oakland City Hall was evacuated after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake until 80M seismic retrofit and hazard abatement work was complete in 1995. City offices had to be housed in leased space and other locations.

Jean Quan was elected mayor in November 2010, beating Don Perata and Rebecca Kaplan in the city&#x27;s first ranked choice balloting. This new system is intended to increase voters&#x27; ability to choose preferred candidates, as they can combine ranked votes when several candidates are competing. Sheng Thao, the first Hmong American mayor of a major city in the United States, took office in 2023.

Oakland is also part of Alameda County, for which the Government of Alameda County is defined and authorized under the California Constitution, California law, and the Charter of the County of Alameda. The County government provides countywide services such as elections and voter registration, law enforcement, jails, vital records, property records, tax collection, public health, and social services. The County government is primarily composed of the elected five-member Board of Supervisors, other elected offices including the Sheriff/Coroner, the District Attorney, Assessor, Auditor-Controller/County Clerk/Recorder, and Treasurer/Tax Collector, and numerous county departments and entities under the supervision of the County Administrator.

===Politics===
Oakland was a Republican Party bastion from the 1860s to the 1950s, with positions expressed by the Republican-oriented &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot; newspaper. In the 1960s, the majority of voters began to favor liberal policies and the Democratic Party. Oakland has the second highest percentage of registered Democrats of any of the incorporated cities in Alameda County, with Berkeley coming in first.

The last Republican presidential candidate to receive at least one-third of vote in Oakland was Richard Nixon in 1972. Since then, the Republican percentage of the vote has generally declined in each successive election.

According to the California Secretary of State, as of February 10, 2019, Oakland has 245,111 registered voters. Of those, 159,771 (65.2%) are registered Democrats, 9,544 (3.9%) are registered Republicans, and 65,416 (26.7%) have declined to state a political party. Oakland is widely regarded as being one of the most liberal major cities in the nation. The Cook Partisan Voting Index of Congressional District 12, which includes Oakland and Berkeley, is D+40, making it the most Democratic congressional district in California and the fourth most Democratic district in the US.

On November 27, 2023, the City Council unanimously passed a resolution calling for a ceasefire in Israel&#x27;s war on Hamas, after hearing more than 500 residents speak on the topic.

==Education==
===Primary and secondary education===

The Oakland Unified School District (OUSD), which covers the city except for Sheffield Village, operates most of Oakland&#x27;s public schools. Due to financial troubles and administrative failures, it was in receivership by the state of California from 2002 to 2008. , the Oakland Unified School District includes 86 division-run schools and 32 charter schools; the district also manages several adult education programs. there are 48,181 K–12 students; among division-run schools, there are 4,600 plus employees.

OUSD test scores historically lag behind the rest of California, in particular due to a high proportion of English-language learners. Some individual schools have much better performance than the citywide average. , for example, over half the students at Hillcrest Elementary School in the Montclair upper hills neighborhood performed at the &quot;advanced&quot; level in the English portion of the test, and students at Lincoln Elementary School in the Chinatown neighborhood performed at the &quot;advanced&quot; level in the math portion.

Oakland&#x27;s three largest public high schools are Oakland High School, Oakland Technical High School, and Skyline High School. Other Oakland public high schools include Castlemont High School, Fremont High School, and McClymonds High School, briefly known as Castlemont Community of Small Schools, Fremont Federation of High Schools, and McClymonds Educational Complex, respectively.

Among charter schools in the district, North Oakland Community Charter School (NOCCS), an elementary and middle school, is one of the few public progressive schools in the country. Other charter schools include the Oakland Military Institute, Oakland School for the Arts, Bay Area Technology School, East Bay Innovation Academy, and Oakland Charter Academy.

There are several religious and secular private high schools, including The College Preparatory School, Head-Royce School, Bishop O&#x27;Dowd High School, Holy Names High School, St. Elizabeth High School and Oakland Hebrew Day School. Catholic schools in Oakland are operated by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Oakland also include eight K–8 schools (plus one in Piedmont on the Oakland city border). Northern Light School is a private nonprofit elementary and middle school. Bentley School is an Independent Co-educational K–12, college preparatory school on two campuses in Oakland and Lafayette, California.

==== Funding ====
In 2017, the Oakland Unified School District has received funding from Pandora in partnership with Little Kids Rock, towards expanding music education programs within the schools. The result from these donations has given teachers from 20 additional Oakland- area schools the ability to participate in an eight-hour professional development workshop, and receive music education instruction from Little Kids Rock. The donation includes providing new instruments, that will benefit over 2,000 Oakland students.

===Colleges and universities===

Accredited colleges and universities include:
* Oakland is also the home of the headquarters of the University of California system, the University of California Office of the President.

In 2001, the SFSU Oakland Multimedia Center was opened, allowing San Francisco State University to conduct classes near downtown Oakland. The Oakland Higher Education Consortium and the City of Oakland&#x27;s Community and Economic Development Agency (CEDA) opened the Oakland Higher Education Center downtown in 2002 to provide &quot;access to multiple higher education service providers within a shared urban facility.&quot; Member schools include primary user California State University, East Bay as well as Lincoln University, New College of California, Saint Mary&#x27;s College of California, SFSU Multimedia Studies Program, UC Berkeley Extension, University of Phoenix and Peralta Community College District.

==Media==
Oakland is served by major television stations broadcasting primarily out of San Francisco and San Jose. The region&#x27;s Fox O&amp;O, KTVU 2, is based in (and licensed to) Oakland at Jack London Square along with co-owned MyNetworkTV outlet KICU-TV 36 (licensed to San Jose). In addition, the city is served by various radio stations as well; AM stations KKSF 910, KMKY 1310 and KNEW 960 are licensed to Oakland.

Oakland was served by the &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot;, which published its first newspaper on February 21, 1874. The Tribune Tower, which features a large clock, is an Oakland landmark. At key times throughout the day (8:00 am, noon and 5:00 pm), the clock tower carillon plays a variety of classic melodies, which change daily. In 2007, the Oakland Tribune moved its offices from the tower to an East Oakland location, before folding in 2011.

The &quot;East Bay Express&quot;, a locally owned free weekly paper, is based in Jack London Square and distributed throughout the East Bay.

Oaklandwiki is a thriving (mostly) English-language LocalWiki.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===

====Air and rail====
Oakland residents have access to the three major airports of the San Francisco Bay Area: Oakland International Airport, San Francisco International Airport, and San Jose International Airport. Oakland International Airport, within Oakland&#x27;s city limits, is south of downtown Oakland and serves domestic and international destinations. AC Transit provides 24-hour service to the airport, and BART&#x27;s Oakland Airport Connector automated guideway transit line provides frequent service between the airport and Oakland Coliseum station.

The city has regional and long-distance passenger train service provided by Amtrak, with stations near Jack London Square and the RingCentral Coliseum. Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;California Zephyr&quot; has its western terminus at the nearby Emeryville station.

Historically, the city was served by several train companies, which terminated in different terminals. Santa Fe trains terminated at its Oakland depot, actually located within the city limits of Emeryville at 40th and San Pablo. Southern Pacific trains ended at the 16th Street Station. Western Pacific trains ended at the 3rd and Washington station. However, a common feature was that the different railroads continued one more stop to a station at Oakland Pier. From this latter point passengers would ride ferries to San Francisco.

====Mass transit and bicycling====

Data compiled in 2007 by the United States Census Bureau before gasoline price spikes in 2008, showed that 24.3% of Oaklanders used public transportation, walked or used &quot;other means&quot; to commute to work, not including remote work, with 17% of Oakland households being &quot;car free&quot; and/or statistically categorized as having &quot;no vehicles available.&quot;

Bus transit service in Oakland and the inner East Bay is provided by the Alameda and Contra Costa Transit District, AC Transit. The district originated in 1958 after the conspiratorial dissolution of the Key System of streetcars. Many AC Transit lines follow old routes of the Key System.

Intercity bus companies that serve Oakland include Greyhound, BoltBus, USAsia, and Hoang Transportation. Megabus no longer serves Oakland.

The metropolitan area is served by Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) from eight stations in Oakland, served by all BART lines.The system has headquarters in Oakland, with major transfer hubs at MacArthur and 19th Street stations. BART&#x27;s headquarters was in a building above the Lake Merritt BART station until 2006, when it relocated to the Kaiser Center due to seismic safety concerns.

The Alameda / Oakland Ferry operates ferry service from Jack London Square to Alameda, Oracle Park, Pier 41, the San Francisco Ferry Building, and the South San Francisco Ferry Terminal.
Oakland licenses taxi cabs, and has zoned cab stands in its downtown, including a bicycle pedi-cab service.

The Oakland City Council adopted a Bicycle Master Plan in 1999 as a part of the Land Use and Transportation (LUTE) element of Oakland&#x27;s 1998 General Plan. The creation of the plan was to promote alternatives to the private automobile. The Oakland City Council reaffirmed the bike plan in 2005, revised it in 2007, and reaffirmed it in 2012. From 1999 to 2007, the city installed 900 bike racks throughout Oakland, accommodating over 2,000 bicycles. By the end of 2017, over 160 bikeway miles and 9,900 bike parking spaces were constructed. Facilities for parking thousands of bicycles have been installed downtown and in other commercial districts throughout Oakland. According to the U.S. Census Bureau&#x27;s 2011 American Community Survey, Oakland came in seventh place out of the 100 largest cities in the nation by percentage of people that chose to commute by bike in 2011.

==== Motorized scooters ====
In July 2019, the City of Oakland Department of Transportation announced that it had issued official permits for the deployment of shared e-scooters to four companies: Bird, Clevr, Lime, and Lyft. Oakland requires these operators to educate users on the correct and safe use of scooters, to distribute the scooters equitably throughout the city, to ensure accessibility, and to provide insurance and indemnification.

====Bridges, freeways, and tunnels====

Oakland is served by several major highways: Eastbound Bay Bridge traffic entering Oakland then splits into three freeways at the MacArthur Maze freeway interchange: Interstate 580 (MacArthur Freeway) heads southeast toward Hayward and eventually to the California Central Valley; Interstate 880 (Nimitz Freeway) runs south to San Jose; and the Eastshore Freeway (Interstate 80/I-580) runs north, providing connections to Sacramento and San Rafael, respectively.
Interstate 980 (Williams Freeway) begins its eastbound journey at I-880 in Downtown Oakland before turning into State Route 24 (Grove Shafter Freeway) at I-580. State Route 13 begins as the Warren Freeway at I-580, and runs through a scenic valley in the Montclair District before entering Berkeley. A stub of a planned freeway was constructed at the High Street exit from the Nimitz Freeway, but that freeway extension plan was abandoned.

At the time of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the Cypress Street Viaduct double-deck segment of the Nimitz Freeway collapsed, killing 42 people. The old freeway segment had passed through the middle of West Oakland, forming a barrier between West Oakland neighborhoods. Following the earthquake, this section was rerouted around the perimeter of West Oakland and rebuilt in 1997–2001. The east span of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge also suffered damage from the quake when a 50-foot (15-m) section of the upper deck collapsed onto the lower deck; the damaged section was repaired within a month of the earthquake. As a result of Loma Prieta, a significant seismic retrofit was performed on the western span of the Bay Bridge. The eastern span has now been replaced with a dramatic single-tower self-anchoring suspension span.

Two underwater tunnels, the Webster and Posey Tubes, connect the main island of Alameda to downtown Oakland, coming above ground in Chinatown. In addition, the Park Street, Fruitvale, and High Street bridges connect Alameda to East Oakland over the Oakland Estuary.

In the hills, the Leimert Bridge crosses Dimond Canyon, connecting the Oakmore neighborhood to Park Boulevard. The Caldecott Tunnel carries Highway 24 through the Berkeley Hills, connecting central Contra Costa County to Oakland. The Caldecott has four bores.

==== Oakland Slow Streets Program ====

On April 11, 2020, the City of Oakland launched its Slow Streets Program. This was facilitated in part by the sudden decrease of vehicle traffic that resulted from the state-wide stay-at-home order and school closures in response to the spread of the COVID-19 in California. The goal of the program was to &quot;support safe physical activity and alleviate overcrowding in parks and on trails by discouraging through traffic.&quot; This was accomplished by closing 74 miles of streets to through traffic.

Over the course of three months the city installed &quot;soft closure&quot; barriers consisting of signage, traffic cones, and barricades in over 21 miles of city streets. While the primary goal at the time was to encourage socially distanced outdoor physical activities like biking, walking, and jogging, the long term implementation of the Slow Streets Program contributed to the city&#x27;s traffic calming measures and promoted alternatives to car use as well.

Although the Slow Streets Program was initially praised for its rapid implementation and prioritization of pedestrian safety, the Oakland Department of Transportation quickly came under fire for its failure to collect feedback that represented the opinions of the diverse range of residents whom the program affected. The high engagement with online surveys by wealthy white residents initially suggested an almost universally positive reaction to the program. The disproportionately low number of responses from residents of East Oakland—a largely Black and Latino and low-income area—revealed both the oversight of city officials as well as the shortcomings of urban planning systems&#x27; ability to equally benefit different social groups, which consequently perpetuates inequalities like the transport divide.

After the flaws of the feedback forms were brought to light, city planners made concentrated efforts to meet with representatives from different community groups who in turn stressed that simply closing streets to through traffic was not enough to protect pedestrians from dangerous driving. In response the city expressed its commitment to its local residents calling for road traffic safety by rolling out Slow Streets: Essential Places, a phase of the program which installed cones and signage at dangerous traffic areas in order to make grocery stores, COVID-19 test sites, and food distribution sites easily and safely accessible.

===Freight rail===

Freight service, which consists primarily of moving shipping containers to and from the Port of Oakland, is provided today by Union Pacific Railroad (UP), and to a lesser extent by BNSF Railway (which now shares the tracks of the UP between Richmond and Oakland).

Historically, Oakland was served by several railroads. Besides the transcontinental line of the Southern Pacific, there was also the Santa Fe (whose Oakland terminal was actually in Emeryville), the Western Pacific Railroad (who built a pier adjacent to the SP&#x27;s), and the Sacramento Northern Railroad (eventually absorbed by the Western Pacific, which in turn was absorbed by UP in 1983).

===Shipping===

As one of the three major ports on the West Coast of the United States, the Port of Oakland is the largest seaport on San Francisco Bay and the fifth busiest container port in the United States. It was one of the earliest seaports to switch to containerization and to intermodal container transfer, thereby displacing the Port of San Francisco, which never modernized its waterfront. One of the earlier limitations to growth was the inability to transfer containers to rail lines, all cranes historically operating between ocean vessels and trucks. In the 1980s, the Port of Oakland began the evaluation of development of an intermodal container transfer capability, i.e., facilities that now allow trans-loading of containers from vessels to either trucks or rail modes.

===Utilities===
Public water supply and sewage treatment are provided by East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD). Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG &amp; E) provides natural gas and electricity service. Municipal garbage collection is franchised to Waste Management, Inc. Telecommunications and subscriber television services are provided by multiple private corporations and other service providers in accordance with the competitive objectives of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.

Oakland tops the list of the 50 largest US cities using electricity from renewable sources.

===Healthcare===

Originating in Oakland, Kaiser Permanente is an HMO started in 1942, during World War II, by industrialist Henry J. Kaiser to provide medical care for Kaiser Shipyards workers. It is the largest managed care organization in the United States and the largest non-governmental health care provider in the world. It is headquartered at One Kaiser Plaza in Downtown Oakland and maintains a large medical center in the Piedmont Avenue neighborhood.

Alta Bates Summit Medical Center, an East Bay hospital system, maintains its Summit Campus in the neighborhood known as &quot;Pill Hill&quot; north of downtown. Until 2000, it was the Summit Medical Center before merging with Berkeley-based Alta Bates. All campuses now operate under the Sutter Health network.

Alameda Health System is an integrated public health care system organized as a public hospital authority. It operates five Alameda County hospitals including Oakland&#x27;s Highland Hospital and four primary care medical clinics including Oakland&#x27;s Highland Wellness Center and Eastmont Wellness Center.

Children&#x27;s Hospital Oakland is the primary medical center specializing in pediatrics in the East Bay. It is a designated Level I pediatric trauma center and the only independent children&#x27;s hospital in Northern California.

There are also several community health centers in Oakland. Some examples include Lifelong Medical Care, Asian Health Services, and Roots Community Health Center.

<text>In church governance, a diocese or bishopric is the ecclesiastical district under the jurisdiction of a bishop.

== History ==
In the later organization of the Roman Empire, the increasingly subdivided provinces were administratively associated in a larger unit, the diocese (Latin &quot;dioecesis&quot;, from the Greek term διοίκησις, meaning &quot;administration&quot;).

Christianity was given legal status in 313 with the Edict of Milan. Churches began to organize themselves into dioceses based on the civil dioceses, not on the larger regional imperial districts. These dioceses were often smaller than the provinces. Christianity was declared the Empire&#x27;s official religion by Theodosius I in 380. Constantine I in 318 gave litigants the right to have court cases transferred from the civil courts to the bishops. This situation must have hardly survived Julian, 361–363. Episcopal courts are not heard of again in the East until 398 and in the West in 408. The quality of these courts was low, and not above suspicion as the Bishop of Alexandria Troas found that clergy were making a corrupt profit. Nonetheless, these courts were popular as people could get quick justice without being charged fees. Bishops had no part in the civil administration until the town councils, in decline, lost much authority to a group of &#x27;notables&#x27; made up of the richest councilors, powerful and rich persons legally exempted from serving on the councils, retired military, and bishops post-AD 450. As the Western Empire collapsed in the 5th century, bishops in Western Europe assumed a larger part of the role of the former Roman governors. A similar, though less pronounced, development occurred in the East, where the Roman administrative apparatus was largely retained by the Byzantine Empire. In modern times, many dioceses, though later subdivided, have preserved the boundaries of a long-vanished Roman administrative division. For Gaul, Bruce Eagles has observed that &quot;it has long been an academic commonplace in France that the medieval dioceses, and their constituent &quot;pagi&quot;, were the direct territorial successors of the Roman &quot;civitates&quot;.&quot;

Modern usage of &#x27;diocese&#x27; tends to refer to the sphere of a bishop&#x27;s jurisdiction. This became commonplace during the self-conscious &quot;classicizing&quot; structural evolution of the Carolingian Empire in the 9th century, but this usage had itself been evolving from the much earlier &quot;parochia&quot; (&quot;parish&quot;; Late Latin derived from the Greek παροικία &quot;paroikia&quot;), dating from the increasingly formalized Christian authority structure in the 4th century.

== Archdiocese ==
Dioceses ruled by an archbishop are commonly referred to as archdioceses; most are metropolitan sees, being placed at the head of an ecclesiastical province. In the Catholic Church, some are suffragans of a metropolitan see or are directly subject to the Holy See.

The term &quot;archdiocese&quot; is not found in Catholic canon law, with the terms &quot;diocese&quot; and &quot;episcopal see&quot; being applicable to the area under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of any bishop. If the title of archbishop is granted on &quot;personal&quot; grounds to a diocesan bishop, his diocese does not thereby become an archdiocese.

==Catholic Church==
The Canon Law of the Catholic Church defines a diocese as &quot;a portion of the people of God which is entrusted to a bishop for him to shepherd with the cooperation of the presbyterium, so that, adhering to its pastor and gathered by him in the Holy Spirit through the gospel and the Eucharist, it constitutes a particular church in which the one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church of Christ is truly present and operative.&quot;

Also known as &quot;particular churches&quot; or &quot;local churches&quot;, dioceses are under the authority of a bishop. They are described as ecclesiastical districts defined by geographical territory. Dioceses are often grouped by the Holy See into ecclesiastical provinces for greater cooperation and common action among regional dioceses. Within an ecclesiastical province, one diocese can be designated an &quot;archdiocese&quot; or &quot;metropolitan archdiocese&quot;, establishing centrality within an ecclesiastical province and denoting a higher rank. Archdioceses are often chosen based on their population and historical significance. All dioceses and archdioceses, and their respective bishops or archbishops, are distinct and autonomous. An archdiocese has limited responsibilities within the same ecclesiastical province assigned to it by the Holy See.

, in the Catholic Church there are 2,898 regular dioceses (or eventually eparchies) consisting of: 1 papal see, 9 patriarchates, 4 major archeparchies, 564 metropolitan archdioceses, 77 single archdioceses and 2,261 dioceses in the world.

In the Eastern Catholic Churches that are in communion with the Pope, the equivalent entity is called an &quot;eparchy&quot; or &quot;archeparchy&quot;, with an &quot;eparch&quot; or &quot;archeparch&quot; serving as the ordinary.

==Eastern Orthodox Church==

The Eastern Orthodox Church calls dioceses &quot;episkopies&quot; (from the Greek ἐπισκοπή) in the Greek tradition and &quot;eparchies&quot; (from ἐπαρχία) in the Slavic tradition.

==Church of England and Anglican Communion==
After the English Reformation, the Church of England retained the existing diocesan structure which remains throughout the Anglican Communion. The one change is that the areas administered under the Archbishop of Canterbury and Archbishop of York are properly referred to as dioceses, not archdioceses: they are the metropolitan bishops of their respective provinces and bishops of their own diocese and have the position of archbishop.

The Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia in its constitution uses the specific term &quot;Episcopal Unit&quot; for both dioceses and because of its unique three-&quot;tikanga&quot; (culture) system. are the tribal-based jurisdictions of Māori (bishops) which overlap with the &quot;New Zealand dioceses&quot; (i.e. the geographical jurisdictions of the (European) bishops); these function like dioceses, but are never called so.

==Lutheranism==
Certain Lutheran denominations such as the Church of Sweden do have individual dioceses similar to Roman Catholics. These dioceses and archdioceses are under the government of a bishop (see Archbishop of Uppsala). Other Lutheran bodies and synods that have dioceses and bishops include the Church of Denmark, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland, the Evangelical Church in Germany (partially), and the Church of Norway.

From about the 13th century until the German mediatization of 1803, the majority of the bishops of the Holy Roman Empire were prince-bishops, and as such exercised political authority over a principality, their so-called Hochstift, which was distinct, and usually considerably smaller than their diocese, over which they only exercised the usual authority of a bishop.

Some American Lutheran church bodies such as the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America have a bishop acting as the head of the synod, but the synod does not have dioceses and archdioceses as the churches listed above. Rather, it is divided into a middle judicatory.

The Lutheran Church - International, based in Springfield, Illinois, presently uses a traditional diocesan structure, with four dioceses in North America. Its current president is Archbishop Robert W. Hotes.

== Church of God in Christ ==
The Church of God in Christ (COGIC) has dioceses throughout the United States. In the COGIC, most states are divided into at least three or more dioceses that are each led by a bishop (sometimes called a &quot;state bishop&quot;); some states have as many as ten dioceses. These dioceses are called &quot;jurisdictions&quot; within COGIC.

==Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints==
In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the term &quot;bishopric&quot; is used to describe the bishop together with his two counselors, not the ward or congregation of which a bishop has charge.

==Catharism==
An organization created by the Gnostic group known as the Cathars in 1167 called the Council of Saint-Félix organized Cathar communities into bishoprics, which each had a bishop presiding over a specific division, even though there was no central authority.

==Churches that have bishops, but not dioceses==

In the United Methodist Church (the United States and some other countries), a bishop is given oversight over a geographical area called an episcopal area. Each episcopal area contains one or more annual conferences, which is how the churches and clergy under the bishop&#x27;s supervision are organized. Thus, the use of the term &quot;diocese&quot; referring to geography is the most equivalent in the United Methodist Church, whereas each annual conference is part of one episcopal area (though that area may contain more than one conference). The African Methodist Episcopal Church has a similar structure to the United Methodist Church, also using the Episcopal Area. The bishops govern the church as a single bench.

In the British Methodist Church and Irish Methodist Church, the closest equivalent to a diocese is the &#x27;circuit&#x27;. Each local church belongs to a circuit, and the circuit is overseen by a superintendent minister who has pastoral charge of all the circuit churches (though in practice he or she delegates such charge to other presbyters who each care for a section of the circuit and chair the local church meetings as deputies of the superintendent). This echoes the practice of the early church where the bishop was supported by a bench of presbyters. Circuits are grouped together to form Districts. All of these, combined with the local membership of the Church, are referred to as the &quot;Connexion&quot;. This 18th-century term, endorsed by John Wesley, describes how people serving in different geographical centres are &#x27;connected&#x27; to each other. Personal oversight of the Methodist Church is exercised by the President of the Conference, a presbyter elected to serve for a year by the Methodist Conference; such oversight is shared with the vice-president, who is always a deacon or layperson. Each District is headed by a &#x27;Chair&#x27;, a presbyter who oversees the district. Although the district is similar in size to a diocese, and Chairs meet regularly with their partner bishops, the Methodist superintendent is closer to the bishop in function than is the chair. The purpose of the district is to resource the circuits; it has no function otherwise.

==Churches that have neither bishops nor dioceses==
Many churches worldwide have neither bishops nor dioceses. Most of these churches are descended from the Protestant Reformation and more specifically the Swiss Reformation led by John Calvin.

Presbyterian churches derive their name from the presbyterian form of church government, which is governed by representative assemblies of elders. The Church of Scotland is governed solely through presbyteries, at parish and regional level, and therefore has no dioceses or bishops.

Congregational churches practice congregationalist church governance, in which each congregation independently and autonomously runs its own affairs.

Churches of Christ, being strictly non-denominational, are governed solely at the congregational level.

Most Baptists hold that no church or ecclesiastical organization has inherent authority over a Baptist church. Churches can properly relate to each other under this polity only through voluntary cooperation, never by any sort of coercion. Furthermore, this Baptist polity calls for freedom from governmental control. Most Baptists believe in &quot;Two offices of the church&quot;—pastor-elder and deacon—based on certain scriptures (; ). Exceptions to this local form of local governance include a few churches that submit to the leadership of a body of elders, as well as the Episcopal Baptists that have an Episcopal system.

Continental Reformed churches are ruled by assemblies of &quot;elders&quot; or ordained officers. This is usually called Synodal government by the continental Reformed, but is essentially the same as presbyterian polity.

<text>James V (10 April 1512 – 14 December 1542) was King of Scotland from 9 September 1513 until his death in 1542. He was crowned on 21 September 1513 at the age of seventeen months. James was the son of King James IV and Margaret Tudor, daughter of Henry VII of England. During his childhood Scotland was governed by regents, firstly by his mother until she remarried, and then by his first cousin once removed, John Stewart, Duke of Albany. James&#x27;s personal rule began in 1528 when he finally escaped the custody of his stepfather, Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus. His first action was to exile Angus and confiscate the lands of the Douglases.

James greatly increased his income by tightening control over royal estates and from the profits of justice, customs and feudal rights. He founded the College of Justice in 1532 and also acted to end lawlessness and rebellion in the Borders and the Hebrides. The rivalry among France, England and the Holy Roman Empire lent James unwonted diplomatic weight, and saw him secure two politically and financially advantageous French marriages, first to Madeleine of Valois and then to Mary of Guise. James also fathered at least nine illegitimate children by a series of mistresses.

James&#x27;s reign witnessed the beginnings of Protestantism in Scotland, and his uncle Henry VIII of England&#x27;s break with Rome in the 1530s placed James in a powerful bargaining position with the papacy, allowing James to exploit the situation to increase his control over ecclesiastical appointments and the financial dividends from church revenues. Pope Paul III also granted him the title of &quot;Defender of the Faith&quot; in 1537. James maintained diplomatic correspondence with various Irish nobles and chiefs throughout their resistance to Henry VIII in the 1530s, and in 1540 they offered him the kingship of Ireland. A patron of the arts, James spent lavishly on the construction of several royal residences in the High Gothic and Renaissance styles.

James has been described as a vindictive king, whose policies were largely motivated by the pursuit of wealth, and a paranoid fear of his nobility which led to the ruthless appropriation of their lands. He has also been characterised as the &quot;poor man&#x27;s king&quot;, due to his accessibility to the poor and his acting against their oppressors. James died in December 1542 following the Scottish defeat by the English at the Battle of Solway Moss. His only surviving legitimate child, Mary, succeeded him at the age of just six days old.

== Early life ==
James was the third son of King James IV and his wife Margaret Tudor, the eldest daughter of Henry VII of England, and was the only legitimate child of James IV to survive infancy. He was born on 10 April 1512 at Linlithgow Palace and baptised the following day, receiving the title Duke of Rothesay. James became king at just seventeen months old when his father was killed at the Battle of Flodden on 9 September 1513.

James was crowned in the Chapel Royal at Stirling Castle on 21 September 1513. The nobility accepted Margaret Tudor as regent for her young son, in accordance with the terms of James IV&#x27;s will, which also stated that Margaret was to retain this position so long as she remained a widow. The long minority of James V would last for nearly fifteen years, with Margaret&#x27;s position as regent soon challenged by the French-born John, Duke of Albany, who was James V&#x27;s second cousin and the nearest male heir to the throne after the king and his younger brother, Alexander, Duke of Ross, who was born in April 1514.

In August 1514, Margaret married Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus. This marriage was opposed by many among the nobility, who feared the advancement of the Douglases, and sought to deprive Margaret of the regency because she had remarried.

The Privy Council removed Margaret from the office of regent and appointed the Duke of Albany to replace her.

== Minority rule ==
=== Albany&#x27;s regency ===
Albany arrived at Dumbarton Castle with eight ships and a troop of French soldiers in May 1514. He entered Edinburgh on 26 May, and in July Parliament confirmed his restoration as Duke of Albany and his position as regent. Albany&#x27;s noble supporters intended his arrival to bring stable and good government, while Francis I of France sought to use Albany to maintain support for the Auld Alliance with France. The first year of his regency was a period when a vigorous defence of his authority was essential to prevent the crumbling of Scottish government either into anarchy or into English control.

The struggle for control of the person of the King was an essential prelude to Albany&#x27;s attempt to govern, as he was aware from the beginning that his claims to act for the King and with full royal authority depended on the continued goodwill of the King himself, or rather of whoever had control of his person and could therefore claim to speak with his voice. Margaret and Angus were potentially hostile to Albany&#x27;s intentions, and James V had to be removed from their influence. Albany besieged Stirling Castle and Margaret was forced to relinquish possession of the King and the Duke of Ross. James would not see his mother again for two years. Having lost the regency, her income and control of her sons, Margaret departed from the court in September 1515, fleeing from Linlithgow Palace, where she had gone for her lying in, to Tantallon Castle, where she gave birth to her daughter, Lady Margaret Douglas, in Northumberland.

The birth and long journey left her extremely ill and she was not told of the death of her second son Alexander in December 1515 until she had recovered her strength. The Earl of Angus made his peace with Albany later in 1516.

A contemporary tribute, paid to the Duke of Albany&#x27;s success in bringing order and good government to Scotland, by Sebastian Giustinian, the Venetian Ambassador at Henry VIII&#x27;s Court, was that Scotland, &quot;...was as much under Albany&#x27;s control as if he were King...&quot;. In February 1517, James was brought from Stirling to the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh, but during an outbreak of plague in the city, he was moved to the care of Antoine d&#x27;Arces at nearby rural Craigmillar Castle.

At Stirling, the ten-year-old James had a guard of 20 footmen dressed in his colours, red and yellow. When he went to the park below the Castle, &quot;by secret and in right fair and soft wedder (weather)&quot;, six horsemen would scour the countryside two miles roundabout for intruders. Poets wrote their own nursery rhymes for James and advised him on royal behavior. Although his academic development was effectively cut short under Angus&#x27;s captivity from 1525 onward, James V had been given a strong grounding by a number of tutors, including David Lyndsay and Gavin Dunbar. James had been taught French and Latin, but as an adult, he spoke halting French, and his need for an interpreter to converse with an Italian bishop suggests that his spoken Latin and Italian were poor.

Between 1517 and 1520, Albany sojourned in France, and did not exercise the regency in person, but through his lieutenants including Antoine d&#x27;Arces, sieur de la Bastie. On 26 August 1517 Albany and Charles, Duke of Alençon agreed the Treaty of Rouen, which renewed the Auld Alliance between Scotland and France and promised a French royal bride for James V. At England&#x27;s request, Albany was detained in France for four years, and with him absent, Queen Margaret returned to Scotland and sought in vain to regain the regency. Young James V was kept a virtual prisoner by Albany and his lieutenants, and Margaret was allowed to see her son only once between 1516 and the end of Albany&#x27;s regency in 1524. Following the signing of the Treaty of Bruges (1521) between Henry VIII of England and Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, Francis I allowed the Duke of Albany to return to Scotland to strengthen the Franco-Scottish alliance.

The Treaty of Rouen was ratified, and Madeleine of Valois was suggested as a suitable bride for James V. When the Duke of Albany returned in November 1521 Margaret sided with him against her husband, the Earl of Angus. Albany came to Edinburgh Castle, where James V was kept, and in a public ceremony, the keeper gave him the keys, which he passed to Margaret, who gave them back to Albany, symbolising that the government of Scotland was in his hands. Thus, Albany was able to keep an upper hand in regard to the ambitious Angus. The regent put Angus under charges of high treason in December 1521 and later sent him practically a prisoner to France. In November 1522, Albany took an army to besiege Wark Castle defended by William Lisle, but gave up after three days when the weather deteriorated.

=== Margaret&#x27;s coup ===
In 1524, Albany was finally removed from power in a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; while he was in France. Margaret, with the help of James Hamilton, 1st Earl of Arran and his followers, brought James V from Stirling to Edinburgh. In August, Parliament declared the regency at an end, and the 12-year-old King James was prematurely &quot;erected&quot; to full kingly powers. In November, Parliament formally recognised Margaret as the chief councillor to the King. Margaret&#x27;s alliance with the Hamiltons inevitably alienated other noble houses. Henry VIII allowed the Earl of Angus (who Albany had banished) to return to Scotland in 1524, and he entered into an alliance with John Stewart, 3rd Earl of Lennox, an enemy of Margaret and Arran. When Angus arrived in Edinburgh with a large group of armed men, claiming his right to attend Parliament, Margaret ordered cannons to be fired on them from Edinburgh Castle. Parliament subsequently made Angus a &quot;Lord of the Articles&quot; and a member of the &quot;council of regency&quot;.

=== Angus captivity ===
A plan was agreed to end the feuding among these opposing groups by allowing each of them in turn to act as host to the young king. However, the plan fell apart in November 1525 when, at the end of his period of custody, Angus refused to surrender the King who, in effect, became a prisoner of the Red Douglases for the next two-and-a-half years. Angus again &quot;erected&quot; James V to full kingly powers, took him on justice ayres and kept him under close supervision. He spoiled the King with various lavish gifts in an attempt to buy his favour and make the detention more tolerable, and when James showed signs of tiring of these gifts, Angus also introduced the adolescent king to the pleasures of the flesh with a succession of prostitutes.

Angus overreached himself, assuming the office of Lord Chancellor, and granting his followers almost every lucrative post available in the royal household. While James V clearly enjoyed some aspects of his captivity, he grew to hate his captor. Several attempts were made to free the young king—one by Walter Scott of Branxholme and Buccleuch, who ambushed the King&#x27;s forces on 25 July 1526 at the Battle of Melrose and was routed off the field. Another attempt later that year, on 4 September at the Battle of Linlithgow Bridge, failed again to relieve the King from the clutches of Angus. In May 1528 James finally escaped from Angus&#x27;s captivity when he fled from Edinburgh to Stirling in disguise. After meeting with his mother at Stirling, James V re-entered Edinburgh in July with a large army. Summoned for treason, Angus holed himself up in Tantallon Castle until an agreement was reached whereby he was allowed to go into exile in England after surrendering his castles.

== Personal rule ==
Pierre de Ronsard saw James in 1537 when the King was twenty-four and summed up his paradoxical appearance: &quot;La douceur et la force illustroient son visage Si que Venus et Mars en avoient fait partage&quot; – His royal bearing, and vigorous pursuit of virtue, of honour, and love&#x27;s war, this sweetness and strength illuminate his face, as if he were the child of Venus and Mars.

=== Religion ===
The first action James took as king was to remove Angus from the scene. The Douglas family — excluding James&#x27;s half-sister Margaret, who was already safely in England, innocent of any crime against him (and thus safe from any revenge James took) — were forced into exile and James besieged their castle at Tantallon. He then subdued the Border rebels and the chiefs of the Western Isles. As well as taking advice from his nobility and using the services of the Duke of Albany in France and at Rome, James had a team of professional lawyers and diplomats, including Adam Otterburn and Thomas Erskine of Haltoun. Even his pursemaster and yeoman of the wardrobe, John Tennent of Listonschiels, was sent on an errand to England, though he got a frosty reception.

James increased his income by tightening control over royal estates and from the profits of justice, customs and feudal rights. He also gave his illegitimate sons lucrative benefices, diverting substantial church wealth into his coffers. James spent a large amount of his wealth on building up a collection of tapestries from those inherited from his father. James sailed to France for his first marriage and strengthened the royal fleet. In 1540, he sailed to Kirkwall in Orkney, then Lewis, in his ship the &quot;Salamander&quot;, first making a will in Leith, knowing this to be &quot;uncertane aventuris.&quot; The purpose of this voyage was to show the royal presence and hold regional courts, called &quot;justice ayres.&quot;

Domestic and international policy was affected by the Reformation, especially after Henry VIII broke from the Catholic Church. James V did not tolerate heresy and during his reign a number of outspoken Protestants were persecuted. The most famous of these was Patrick Hamilton, who was burned at the stake as a heretic at St Andrews in 1528. Later in the reign, the English ambassador Ralph Sadler tried to encourage James to close the monasteries and take their revenue so that he would not have to keep sheep like a mean subject. James replied that he had no sheep, he could depend on his god-father the king of France, and it was against reason to close the abbeys that &quot;stand these many years, and God&#x27;s service maintained and kept in the same, and I might have anything I require of them.&quot; Sadler knew that James did farm sheep on his estates.

James recovered money from the church by getting Pope Clement VII to allow him to tax monastic incomes. He sent £50 to Johann Cochlaeus, a German opponent of Martin Luther, after receiving one of his books in 1534. On 19 January 1537, Pope Paul III sent James a blessed sword and hat symbolising his prayers that James would be strengthened against heresies from across the border. These gifts were delivered by the Pope&#x27;s messenger while James was at Compiègne in France on 25 February 1537.

According to 16th-century writers, his treasurer James Kirkcaldy of Grange tried to persuade James against the persecution of Protestants and to meet Henry VIII at York. James and Henry corresponded about meeting in 1536. Pope Paul III advised James against travelling to England, and sent an envoy or nuncio to Scotland to discuss the initiative. Although Henry VIII sent his tapestries to York in September 1541 ahead of a meeting, James did not come. The lack of commitment to this meeting was regarded by English observers as a sign that Scotland was firmly allied to France and Catholicism, particularly by the influence of Cardinal Beaton, Keeper of the Privy Seal, and as a cause for war.

In 1540, Irish nobles and chiefs offered James the kingship of Ireland, as a further challenge to Henry VIII.

=== Building ===

James V spent a large amount of money (at least £41,000) during his adult reign on extensively remodelling all the major residences and several minor ones, including the construction of new structures, with the most significant work focused on Falkland Palace and Stirling Castle. Early in his personal rule James began the construction of the present Late Gothic James V Tower at the north-west corner of the Palace of Holyroodhouse, which provided new royal lodgings on the first and second floors, and a high degree of security. A new west front was also built. At Linlithgow Palace, James closed off the original east entranceway and formed a new formal access from the south, including an inner gatehouse and an outer entrance gate decorated with the carved arms of the four chivalric orders of which James was a member: Garter, Thistle, Golden Fleece and Saint Michael. The three-tiered octagonal King&#x27;s Fountain topped by an imperial crown was built in 1538 as the centrepiece of the courtyard.

At Falkland Palace, James V extended his father&#x27;s buildings in French Renaissance style between 1537 and 1541 and built a real tennis court in the garden in 1541. The court survives to this day and is the oldest in the United Kingdom. James also built a new Late Gothic entrance tower in the south range, and the courtyard facades of the east and south ranges that were built in 1537 and 1539 are the earliest examples of Renaissance architecture in the British Isles. The largest of James V&#x27;s building projects was the construction of the Royal Palace at Stirling Castle, built between 1538 and 1540, with its Renaissance facades and the north, east and south quarters housing the king&#x27;s and queen&#x27;s apartments. Work was also carried out at Tantallon Castle, Blackness Castle and Hermitage Castle.

== Marriages ==
As early as August 1517, a clause of the Treaty of Rouen provided that if the Auld Alliance between France and Scotland was maintained, James should have a daughter of Francis I of France as a bride. Yet by the 1520s Francis&#x27;s two surviving daughters were too frail or too young. In 1528 the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V and the English diplomat Thomas Magnus both raised the possibility of a marriage between the King and his cousin, Princess Mary, while that same year, Margaret of Austria, Charles V&#x27;s aunt, suggested that James should marry Charles&#x27;s sister, Mary of Austria. Charles V also proposed James marry his niece, Maria of Portugal. Perhaps to remind Francis I of his obligations, in 1529 James V began negotiations for his marriage elsewhere, sending the Duke of Albany to Rome to negotiate a marriage to Catherine de&#x27; Medici, the niece of Pope Clement VII. By 1533 there was discussion of James marrying one of his second cousins, Christina or Dorothea, the daughters of Christian II of Denmark, while in 1534 Margaret of Valois-Angoulême, sister of Francis I, suggested her sister-in-law Isabella.

In December 1534, Francis I insisted that his eldest daughter Madeleine&#x27;s health was too poor for marriage, suggesting that James V should marry Mary of Bourbon, daughter of the Duke of Vendôme, instead to fulfil the Treaty of Rouen. Again, the Duke of Albany briefly entertained the idea that James might marry Christina of Denmark, and the King halted progress on the marriage negotiations. There was also an investigation into the possibility of James marrying his former mistress, Margaret Erskine before the negotiations resumed again, and in March 1536 a final contract made for Mary of Bourbon to marry James V. She would have a dowry as if she were a French princess, and Francis I consolidated the agreement by sending James the collar of the Order of Saint Michael as a token of his affection.

=== Marriage to Madeleine of Valois ===
James decided to travel to France to meet his prospective bride in person. He sailed from Kirkcaldy on 1 September 1536, with the earls of Arran, Argyll and Rothes, Lord Fleming, David Beaton and a force of 500 men in a fleet of six ships, using the &quot;Mary Willoughby&quot; as his flagship. Before his departure, James appointed six vice-regents to govern Scotland in his absence. In the event, James V would be away from Scotland for eight months, becoming the first Scottish king to voluntarily remain away from his realm since David II almost two hundred years earlier. Arriving at Dieppe a week later, the Scots travelled to the Duke of Vendôme&#x27;s court at Saint-Quentin. However, on meeting Mary of Bourbon, James V was not impressed by her. He then travelled south to the French court at the Château d&#x27;Amboise, where he met Madeleine, and again pressed Francis for her hand in marriage. Fearing the harsh climate of Scotland would prove fatal to his daughter&#x27;s already failing health, Francis initially refused to permit the marriage, but the couple persuaded Francis to reluctantly grant permission to their marriage. The marriage contract was signed in November, with Francis I granting Madeleine a dowry of 100,000 écu, and a further 30,000 francs a year for James.

James V renewed the Auld Alliance and fulfilled the terms of the Treaty of Rouen on 1 January 1537 by marrying Madeleine at Notre-Dame de Paris. James received papal approval in the form of the Blessed sword and hat, and was granted the title of &quot;Defender of the Faith&quot; by Pope Paul III on 19 January 1537, symbolising the hopes of the papacy that he would resist the path that his uncle Henry VIII had followed. After months of festivities and celebrations, and visits to Chantilly, Compiègne and Rouen (where Madeleine fell ill), the royal couple embarked for Scotland in May 1537, arriving at Leith on 19 May. Madeleine wrote to her father from Edinburgh on 8 June 1537 saying that she was better and her symptoms had diminished. However, a month later, on 7 July 1537, Queen Madeleine died in her husband&#x27;s arms at Holyrood Palace of tuberculosis. James V wrote to Francis I to inform him of what had happened, saying that if it were not for the fact that he was relying on the French king to remain his &quot;good father&quot;, he would be in even greater pain. The Queen was interred in Holyrood Abbey in Edinburgh.

=== Marriage to Mary of Guise ===
Following Madeleine&#x27;s death, James V&#x27;s thoughts turned to a second French bride to further the interests of the Franco-Scottish alliance. David Beaton was sent to France to persuade Francis I to agree to James marrying his only surviving daughter, Margaret. Francis offered Mary of Guise as a bride instead. The daughter of Claude, Duke of Guise, Mary had recently been widowed by the death of her husband, Louis II d&#x27;Orléans, Duke of Longueville. David Beaton wrote to James V from Lyon in October 1537 that Mary was &quot;stark (strong), well complexioned, and fit to travel&quot;, and that her father was &quot;marvellous desirous of the expedition and hasty end of the matter,&quot; and had already consulted with his brother, Antoine, Duke of Lorraine, and Mary herself. The marriage contract was finalised in January 1538, with James V receiving a dowry of 150,000 livres. As was customary, if the King died first, Mary would retain for her lifetime her jointure houses of Falkland Palace, Stirling Castle, Dingwall Castle and Threave Castle, along with the rentals of the earldoms of Fife, Strathearn, Ross and Orkney, and the lordships of Galloway, Ardmannoch and the Isles.

The proxy wedding of James V and Mary of Guise was held on 9 May 1538 at the Château de Châteaudun. Some 2,000 Scottish lords and barons came from Scotland aboard a fleet of ships under Lord Maxwell to attend, with Lord Maxwell standing as proxy for James V. Mary departed from Le Havre on 10 June 1538, and landed in Scotland 6 days later at Crail in Fife. She was formally received by the king at St Andrews a few days later amid pageants and plays performed in her honour, and James and Mary were married in person at St Andrews Cathedral on 18 June 1538. James&#x27;s mother Margaret Tudor wrote to Henry VIII in July, &quot;I trust she will prove a wise Princess. I have been much in her company, and she bears herself very honourably to me, with very good entertaining.&quot; James and Mary had two sons: James, Duke of Rothesay (born 22 May 1540 at St Andrews), and Robert (or Arthur), Duke of Albany (born and baptised on 12 April 1541); however, both died on 21 April 1541, when James was nearly one year old and Robert (or Arthur) was nine days old. Mary&#x27;s mother, Antoinette de Bourbon, wrote that the couple were still young and should hope for more children. The third and last child of the union was a daughter, Mary, who was born on 8 December 1542.

== Outside interests ==

According to legend, James was nicknamed &quot;King of the Commons&quot; as he would sometimes travel around Scotland disguised as a common man, describing himself as the &quot;Gudeman of Ballengeich&quot;. (&quot;Gudeman&quot; means &quot;landlord&quot; or &quot;farmer&quot;, and &quot;Ballengeich&quot; was the nickname of a road next to Stirling Castle — meaning &quot;windy pass&quot; in Gaelic). One traditional ballad, &quot;The Jolly Beggar&quot;, is considered by some to refer to his activities.

James was also a keen lute player. In 1562, Sir Thomas Wood reported that James had &quot;a singular good ear and could sing that he had never seen before&quot; (sight-read), but his voice was &quot;rawky&quot; and &quot;harske.&quot; At court, James maintained a band of Italian musicians who adopted the name Drummond. These were joined for the winter of 1529/30 by a musician and diplomat sent by the Duke of Milan, Thomas de Averencia de Brescia, probably a lutenist. The historian Andrea Thomas makes a useful distinction between the loud music provided at ceremonies and processionals and instruments employed for more private occasions or worship, the &quot;music fyne&quot; described by Helena Mennie Shire. This quieter music included a consort of viols played by four Frenchmen led by Jacques Columbell. It seems certain that David Peebles wrote music for James V and probable that the Scottish composer Robert Carver was in royal employ, though evidence is lacking.

As a patron of poets and authors, James supported William Stewart and John Bellenden, the son of his nurse, who translated the Latin &quot;History of Scotland&quot; compiled in 1527 by Hector Boece into verse and prose. Sir David Lindsay of the Mount, the Lord Lyon, head of the Lyon Court and diplomat, was a prolific poet. He produced an interlude at Linlithgow Palace thought to be a version of his play &quot;The Thrie Estaitis&quot; in 1540. James also attracted the attention of international authors. The French poet Pierre de Ronsard, who had been a page of Madeleine of Valois, offered unqualified praise:
&quot;Son port estoit royal, son regard vigoureux
De vertus, et de l&#x27;honneur, et guerre amoureux
La douceur et la force illustroient son visage
Si que Venus et Mars en avoient fait partage&quot;

His royal bearing, and vigorous pursuit
of virtue, of honour, and love&#x27;s war,
this sweetness and strength illuminate his face,
as if he were the child of Venus and Mars.

When he married Mary of Guise, Giovanni Ferrerio, an Italian scholar who had been at Kinloss Abbey in Scotland, dedicated to the couple a new edition of his work &quot;On the True Significance of Comets against the Vanity of Astrologers.&quot; Like Henry VIII, James employed many foreign artisans and craftsmen in order to enhance the prestige of his renaissance court. Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie listed their professions:
he plenished the country with all kind of craftsmen out of other countries, as French-men, Spaniards, Dutch men, and Englishmen, which were all cunning craftsmen, every man for his own hand. Some were gunners, wrights, carvers, painters, masons, smiths, harness-makers (armourers), tapesters, broudsters, taylors, cunning chirugeons, apothecaries, with all other kind of craftsmen to apparel his palaces.

One technological initiative was a special mill for polishing armour at Holyroodhouse next to his mint. The mill had a pole drive 32 feet long powered by horses. Mary of Guise&#x27;s mother Antoinette of Bourbon sent him an armourer. The armourer made steel plates for his jousting saddles in October 1538 and delivered a skirt of plate armour in February 1540. In the same year, for his wife&#x27;s coronation, the treasurer&#x27;s accounts record that James personally devised fireworks made by his master gunners. His goldsmith John Mosman renovated the crown jewels for the occasion. When James took steps to suppress the circulation of slanderous ballads and rhymes against Henry VIII, Henry sent Fulke ap Powell, Lancaster Herald, to give thanks and to make arrangements for the present of a lion for James&#x27;s menagerie of exotic pets.

== War with England and death ==
The death of James&#x27;s mother in 1541 removed any incentive for peace with England, and war broke out. Initially, the Scots won a victory at the Battle of Haddon Rig in August 1542. The Imperial ambassador in London, Eustace Chapuys, wrote on 2 October that the Scottish ambassadors ruled out a conciliatory meeting between James and Henry VIII in England until the pregnant Mary of Guise delivered her child. Henry would not accept this condition and mobilised his army against Scotland. James was with his army at Lauder on 31 October 1542. Although he hoped to invade England, his nobles were reluctant. He returned to Edinburgh, on the way writing a letter in French to his wife from Falahill mentioning he had three days of illness. On 24 November his army suffered a serious defeat at the Battle of Solway Moss. Following a few days spent at Linlithgow Palace with Queen Mary, who was in the final stages of her pregnancy, on 6 December James travelled to Falkland Palace, where he soon took ill.

Although James V&#x27;s army had been beaten at Solway Moss, it was neither a personal humiliation for the King (who was not there) nor the result of noble disaffection. In fact, James had substantial support for his war policy and early in December, he had made plans to renew the conflict with England. James was on his deathbed at Falkland when news arrived from Linlithgow that the Queen had given birth to a daughter. According to John Knox, on hearing of the birth of his daughter, the King said &quot;It cam wi&#x27; a lass, and it will gang wi&#x27; a lass&quot; (meaning &quot;It began with a girl and it will end with a girl&quot;). This could refer to the Stewart dynasty&#x27;s accession to the throne through Marjorie Bruce, daughter of Robert the Bruce. The prophecy could have been intended to express his belief that his new-born daughter Mary would be the last of the Stewart monarchs. In fact, the last Stewart monarch was female: Anne, Queen of Great Britain. James V died at Falkland Palace on 14 December 1542, aged thirty. The King had been ill on a number of occasions during the previous decade: in 1533 &quot;of a sore fois (face)&quot;; in 1534 of the &quot;pox, and fevir contenew&quot;; in Paris in 1536; and in 1540, when he wrote to his wife to say that he had been as ill as he had ever been in his life, but was now recovered. Evidently, his immune system had not recovered, as he had been ill again in November 1542. It is likely that James V died from cholera or dysentery, rather than shame or despair brought on by the news of Solway Moss.

James was succeeded by his infant daughter, Mary, Queen of Scots. On 7 January 1543, the King&#x27;s body was conveyed from Falkland to the Forth ferry at Kinghorn, before being transported to Edinburgh, escorted by a funeral cortege, and accompanied by Cardinal Beaton, the Earls of Arran, Argyll, Rothes, Marischal and other nobles. James V was buried on 8 January at Holyrood Abbey, next to his first wife, Madeleine, and his two sons. A stone tomb was erected, on which Andrew Mansioun carved a lion, a crown and an eighteen-foot-long inscription in Roman letters. Alms were distributed to the poor of Edinburgh who had been present at the soul-Mass and dirge performed for the King. During the Rough Wooing, the invading English armies inflicted structural damage on Holyrood Abbey in 1544 and 1547, destroying James V&#x27;s tomb.

James was the last monarch to die in Scotland until 8 September 2022 when Queen Elizabeth II died at Balmoral Castle in Aberdeenshire, 480 years later. Days later her body was carried through the streets of Edinburgh, the first time that a royal cortege had passed through the city since James V&#x27;s burial.

<text>Pseudotsuga is a genus of evergreen coniferous trees in the family Pinaceae (subfamily Laricoideae). Common names for species in the genus include Douglas fir, Douglas-fir, Douglas tree, Oregon pine and Bigcone spruce. &quot;Pseudotsuga menziesii&quot; (Douglas fir proper) is widespread in western North America and is an important source of timber. The number of species has long been debated, but two in western North America and two to four in eastern Asia are commonly acknowledged.

Nineteenth-century botanists had problems in classifying Douglas firs, due to the species&#x27; similarity to various other conifers better known at the time; they have at times been classified in &quot;Pinus&quot;, &quot;Picea&quot;, &quot;Abies&quot;, &quot;Tsuga&quot;, and even &quot;Sequoia&quot;. Because of their distinctive cones, Douglas firs were finally placed in the new genus &quot;Pseudotsuga&quot; (meaning &quot;false hemlock&quot;) by the French botanist Carrière in 1867. The genus name has also been hyphenated as &quot;Pseudo-tsuga&quot;.

==Name==
The tree takes its English name from David Douglas, the Scottish botanist who first introduced &quot;Pseudotsuga menziesii&quot; into cultivation at Scone Palace in 1827. Douglas is known for introducing many native American tree species to Europe. The hyphenated form &quot;Douglas-fir&quot; is used by some to indicate that &quot;Pseudotsuga&quot; species are not true firs, which belong to the genus &quot;Abies&quot;.

==Description==
Douglas-firs are medium-size to extremely large evergreen trees, tall (although only coast Douglas-firs reach such great height). The leaves are flat, soft, linear, long, generally resembling those of the firs, occurring singly rather than in fascicles; they completely encircle the branches, which can be useful in recognizing the species. The female cones are pendulous, with persistent scales (unlike true firs), and are distinctive in having a long tridentine (three-pointed) bract that protrudes prominently above each scale (it resembles the back half of a mouse, with two feet and a tail).

&quot;Pseudotsuga menziesii&quot; var. &quot;menziesii&quot; has attained heights of 393 feet (120* m). That was the estimated height of the tallest conifer ever well-documented, the Mineral Tree (Mineral, Washington), measured in 1924 by Dr. Richard E. McArdle, former chief of the U.S. Forest Service. The volume of that tree was . The tallest living individual is the Brummitt (Doerner) Fir in Coos County, Oregon, tall. Only coast redwood and &quot;Eucalyptus regnans&quot; reach greater heights based on current knowledge of living trees: 379 and 331 feet (116 and 101* m), respectively.
At Quinault, Washington, is found a collection of the largest Douglas-firs in one area. Quinault Rain Forest hosts most of the top ten known largest Douglas-firs.

, the largest known Douglas-firs in the world are, by volume:

# Red Creek Tree (Red Creek, SW British Columbia) 
# Queets Fir (Queets River Valley-Olympic National Park) 
# Tichipawa (Quinault Lake Rain Forest-Olympic National Park) 
# Rex (Quinault Lake Rain Forest-Olympic National Park) 
# Ol&#x27; Jed (Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park) 
== Species and varieties ==


By far the best-known is the very widespread and abundant North American species &quot;Pseudotsuga menziesii&quot;, a taxonomically complex species divided into two major varieties (treated as distinct species or subspecies by some botanists): coast Douglas-fir or &quot;green Douglas-fir&quot;, on the Pacific coast; and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir or &quot;interior Douglas-fir&quot;, in the interior west of the continent. According to some botanists, Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir extends south into Mexico to include all Mexican Douglas-fir populations, whereas others have proposed multiple separate species in Mexico and multiple varieties in the United States. Morphological and genetic evidence suggest that Mexican Douglas-fir should probably be considered a distinct variety within &quot;P. menziesii&quot;.

All of the other species are of restricted range and little-known outside of their respective native environments, where they are often rare and of scattered occurrence in mixed forests; all those have unfavorable conservation status. The taxonomy of the Asian Douglas-firs continues to be disputed, but the most recent taxonomic treatment accepts four species: three Chinese and one Japanese. The three Chinese species have been variously considered varieties of &quot;P. sinensis&quot; or broken down into additional species and varieties. In the current treatment, the Chinese species &quot;P. sinensis&quot; is further subdivided into two varieties: var. &quot;sinensis&quot; and var. &quot;wilsoniana&quot;.

== Uses ==

Douglas-fir wood is used for structural applications that are required to withstand high loads. It is used extensively in the construction industry. Other examples include its use for homebuilt aircraft such as the RJ.03 IBIS canard. Very often, these aircraft were designed to utilize Sitka spruce, which is becoming increasingly difficult to source in aviation quality grades. Oregon pine is also used in boat building when it is available in long, fairly knot-free lengths. Most timber now comes from plantation forests in North America which are managed to produce faster growing timber with fewer knots. This timber is generally lighter but weaker. Traditionally, Oregon pine was used in mast building due to its ability to resist bending loads without fracturing. This was based on using older native forest wood with a high number of growth rings per inch. This sort of wood is seldom available new but can be sourced from merchants dealing in recycled timber. Native Oregon pine is considerably heavier than Sitka spruce, which is about the same weight as western red cedar, but with far better bending characteristics than cedar. Large-sized Oregon pine, as used in beams, is inclined to split as it dries, like oak, but this does not reduce its strength.

Douglas-fir is one of the most commonly marketed Christmas tree species in the United States, where they are sold alongside firs like noble fir and grand fir. Douglas-fir Christmas trees are usually trimmed to a near perfect cone instead of left to grow naturally like noble and grand firs.

==Pests and diseases==

Douglas-firs are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including autumnal moth, bordered white, engrailed moth, pine beauty and turnip moth. The gelechiids &quot;Chionodes abella&quot; and &quot;Chionodes periculella&quot; and the tortrix moth &quot;Cydia illutana&quot; have been specifically recorded on &quot;P. menziesii&quot;.

==Culture==
A California Native American myth explains that each three-ended bract is the tail and two tiny legs of a mouse that hid inside the scales of the tree&#x27;s cones during forest fires, and the tree was kind enough to be its enduring sanctuary.

A Douglas-fir species, &quot;Pseudotsuga menziesii&quot;, is the state tree of Oregon.

<text>Domoic acid (DA) is a kainic acid-type neurotoxin that causes amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP). It is produced by algae and accumulates in shellfish, sardines, and anchovies. When sea lions, otters, cetaceans, humans, and other predators eat contaminated animals, poisoning may result. Exposure to this compound affects the brain, causing seizures, and possibly death.

==History==
There has been little use of domoic acid throughout history except for in Japan, where it has been used as an anthelmintic for centuries.
Domoic acid was first isolated in 1959 from a species of red algae, &quot;Chondria armata&quot;, in Japan, which is commonly referred to as &quot;dōmoi&quot; (ドウモイ) in the Tokunoshima dialect, or &quot;hanayanagi&quot;. Poisonings in history have been rare, or undocumented; however, it is thought that the increase in human activities is resulting in an increasing frequency of harmful algal blooms along coastlines in recent years. In 2015, the North American Pacific coast was heavily impacted by an algal bloom, consisting predominantly of the domoic acid-producing pennate diatom, &quot;Pseudo-nitzschia.&quot; Consequently, elevated levels of domoic acid were measured in stranded marine mammals, prompting the closure of beaches and damaging razor clam, rock crab and Dungeness crab fisheries.

In 1961, seabirds attacked the Capitola area in California, and though it was never confirmed, it was later hypothesized that they were under the influence of domoic acid.

In 1987, in Prince Edward Island, Canada, there was a shellfish poisoning resulting in 3 deaths. Blue mussels (&quot;Mytulis edulis&quot;) contaminated with domoic acid were blamed.

Domoic acid has been suggested to have been involved in an incident which took place on June 22, 2006, when a California brown pelican flew through the windshield of a car on the Pacific Coast Highway.

On Friday, June 14, 2019, a teenager was attacked and injured by a sea lion that was alleged to be under the influence of domoic acid in Pismo Beach on the Central California coast.

==Chemistry==

===General===

Domoic acid is a structural analog of kainic acid, proline, and endogenous excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. Ohfune and Tomita, who wanted to investigate its absolute stereochemistry, were the first and only to synthesize domoic acid in 1982.

===Biosynthesis===

In 1999, using 13C- and 14C-labelled precursors, the biosynthesis of domoic acid in the diatom genus &quot;Pseudo-nitzschia&quot; was examined. After addition of [1,2-13C2]-acetate, NMR spectroscopy showed enrichment of every carbon in domoic acid, indicating incorporation of the carbon isotopes. This enrichment was consistent with two biosynthetic pathways. The labeling pattern determined that domoic acid can be biosynthesized by an isoprenoid intermediate in combination with a tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediate.

In 2018, using growth conditions known to induce domoic acid production in &quot;Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries&quot;, transcriptome sequencing successfully identified candidate domoic acid biosynthesis genes responsible for the pyrrolidine core. These domoic acid biosynthesis genes, or ‘Dab’ enzymes were heterologously expressed, characterized, and annotated as &quot;dabA&quot; (terpene cyclase), &quot;dabB&quot; (hypothetical protein), &quot;dabC&quot; (α-ketoglutarate–dependent dioxygenase), and &quot;dabD&quot; (CYP450).Domoic acid biosynthesis begins with the DabA-catalyzed geranylation of L-glutamic acid (L-Glu) with geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) to form &quot;N-geranyl&quot;-L-glutamic acid (L-NGG). DabD then performs three successive oxidation reactions at the 7′-methyl of L-NGG to produce 7′-carboxy-L-NGG, which is then cyclized by DabC to generate the naturally occurring isodomoic acid A. Finally, an uncharacterized isomerase could convert isodomoic acid A to domoic acid. Further investigation is needed to resolve the final isomerization reaction to complete the pathway to Domoic acid.

=== Synthesis ===

Using intermediates 5 and 6, a Diels-Alder reaction produced a bicyclic compound (7). 7 then underwent ozonolysis to open the six-membered ring leading to selenide (8). 8 was then deselenated to form 9 (E-9 and Z-9), lastly leading to the formation of (-) domoic acid.

==Mechanism of action==
The effects of domoic acid have been attributed to several mechanisms, but the one of concern is through glutamate receptors. Domoic acid is an excitatory amino acid analogue of glutamate; a neurotransmitter in the brain that activates glutamate receptors. Domoic acid has a very strong affinity for these receptors, which results in excitotoxicity initiated by an integrative action on ionotropic glutamate receptors at both sides of the synapse, coupled with the effect of blocking the channel from rapid desensitization. In addition there is a synergistic effect with endogenous glutamate and N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptor agonists that contribute to the excitotoxicity.

In the brain, domoic acid especially damages the hippocampus and amygdaloid nucleus. It damages the neurons by activating AMPA and kainate receptors, causing an influx of calcium. Although calcium flowing into cells is normal, the uncontrolled increase of calcium causes the cells to degenerate. Because the hippocampus may be severely damaged, short-term memory loss occurs. It may also cause kidney damage – even at levels considered safe for human consumption, a new study in mice has revealed. The kidney is affected at a hundred times lower than the concentration allowed under FDA regulations.

==Toxicology==
Domoic acid producing algal blooms are associated with the phenomenon of amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP). Domoic acid can bioaccumulate in marine organisms such as shellfish, anchovies, and sardines that feed on the phytoplankton known to produce this toxin. It can accumulate in high concentrations in the tissues of these plankton feeders when the toxic phytoplankton are high in concentration in the surrounding waters.
Domoic acid is a neurotoxin that inhibits neurochemical processes, causing short-term memory loss, brain damage, and, in severe cases, death in humans. In marine mammals, domoic acid typically causes seizures and tremors.

Studies have shown that there are no symptomatic effects in humans at levels of 0.5 mg/kg of body weight. In the 1987 domoic acid poisoning on Prince Edward Island concentrations ranging from 0.31 to 1.28 mg/kg of muscle tissue were noted in people that became ill (three of whom died). Dangerous levels of domoic acid have been calculated based on cases such as the one on Prince Edward island. The exact for humans is unknown; for mice the LD50 is 3.6 mg/kg.

New research has found that domoic acid is a heat-resistant and very stable toxin, which can damage kidneys at concentrations that are 100 times lower than what causes neurological effects.

==Diagnosis and prevention==
In order to be diagnosed and treated if poisoned, domoic acid must first be detected. Methods such as ELISA or probe development with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) may be used to detect the toxin or the organism producing this toxin.

There is no known antidote available for domoic acid. Therefore, if poisoning occurs, it is advised to go quickly to a hospital. Cooking or freezing affected fish or shellfish tissue that are contaminated with domoic acid does not lessen the toxicity.

As a public health concern, the concentration of domoic acid in shellfish and shellfish parts at point of sale should not exceed the current permissible limit of 20 mg/kg tissue. In addition, during processing shellfish, it is important to pay attention to environmental condition factors.

==In popular culture==
On August 18, 1961, in Capitola and Santa Cruz, California there was an invasion of what people described as chaotic seabirds. These birds were believed to be under the influence of domoic acid, and it inspired a scene in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s feature film &quot;The Birds&quot;.

In the &quot;Elementary&quot; Season 1 Episode 13 &quot;The Red Team&quot;, domoic acid was used as a poison to mimic Alzheimer&#x27;s.
