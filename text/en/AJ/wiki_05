<text>Campania is an administrative region of Italy located in Southern Italy; most of it is in the south-western portion of the Italian Peninsula (with the Tyrrhenian Sea to its west), but it also includes the small Phlegraean Islands and the island of Capri. The capital of the Campania region is Naples. As of 2018, the region had a population of around 5,820,000 people, making it Italy&#x27;s third most populous region, and, with an area of , its most densely populated region. Based on its GDP, Campania is also the most economically productive region in Southern Italy and the 7th most productive in the whole country. Naples&#x27; urban area, which is in Campania, is the eighth most populous in the European Union. The region is home to 10 of the 58 UNESCO sites in Italy, including Pompeii and Herculaneum, the Royal Palace of Caserta, the Amalfi Coast, the Longobardian Church of Santa Sofia in Benevento and the Historic Centre of Naples. In addition, Campania&#x27;s Mount Vesuvius is part of the UNESCO World Network of Biosphere Reserves. The Region plays also a key international role in international diplomacy, since it is home to NATO&#x27;s Allied Joint Force Command Naples and of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Mediterranean.

The Campania&#x27;s hinterland was inhabited from the beginning of the 1st millennium BC by the Osci, Samnites and Etruscans, while between the 8th and 7th centuries BC its coastal areas were colonised by the ancient Greeks (Magna Graecia). At that time, Capua was Campania&#x27;s leading city, while Naples was an anomaly, being predominantly Greek-speaking.

Campania is rich in culture, especially with regard to food, music, architecture, and archaeological and ancient sites—such as Pompeii, Herculaneum, Oplontis, Paestum, Aeclanum, Stabiae, and Velia. The name &quot;Campania&quot; is derived from Latin; the Romans knew the region as &quot;Campania felix&quot; (&quot;fertile countryside&quot; or &quot;happy countryside&quot;). The rich natural beauty of Campania makes it important to the tourism industry: the city of Naples, the Amalfi Coast, Mount Vesuvius, and the islands of Capri and Ischia have long been major attractions.

==History==
=== Pre-Roman period ===
The region known today as &quot;Campania&quot; was inhabited from at least the beginning of the 1st millennium BC by several Oscan-speaking Italic tribes: the Osci, the Opici, the Aurunci, the Ausones, the Sidicini, the Hirpini, the Caudini, the Oenotrians, the Campanians (after whom the region is named) and the Lucanians (who inhabited the southernmost part of Campania, known in ancient times as Lucania, roughly where modern-day Salerno is). Many of these tribes lived in simple agro-towns. Not much is known about the pre-Indo-European tribes that had lived in the region earlier; they were probably not as technologically or culturally advanced as the Oscans, and any who still flourished had become fully Oscanised by the middle of the first millennium BC.

Between the 9th and 6th centuries BC, the Etruscans from Central Italy established colonies in the Campanian Plains (the inland territories that today are the provinces of Caserta and Naples), as well as in the regions of Agro Nocerino-Sarnese and Agro Picentino (which today are in the province of Salerno). There, they essentially replicated their &quot;Dodecapolis&quot; (twelve cities) political model, founding the cities of &quot;Hyria&quot; (modern-day Nola), &quot;Irnthi&quot; or &quot;Marcina&quot; (modern-day Salerno), &quot;Amina&quot; (modern-day Pontecagnano Faiano), &quot;Velcha&quot;, &quot;Velsu&quot; and &quot;Uri&quot;. In addition to assimilating into their urban-political domains, the Etruscans also incorporated the pre-existing tribal Oscan agro-towns of &quot;Capua&quot; (modern-day Santa Maria Capua Vetere), &quot;Nuceria&quot; (modern-day &quot;comuni&quot; of Nocera Superiore and Nocera Inferiore), Suessula, Acerra, Ercolano, Pompeii, Stabiae and Sorrento.

Meanwhile, during the 8th century BC, Greek-speaking people from Euboea (in Central Greece), known as Cumaeans, began to establish colonies themselves roughly around the coastal areas of the modern-day province of Naples and in the nearby islands founding, among others, the cities of Cumae, &quot;Pithekoūsai&quot; (modern-day Ischia), Paestum, Herculaneum and &quot;Dicaearchia&quot;, later &#x27;Puteoli&#x27;, in Latin (modern-day Pozzuoli). The city of Naples began as a small commercial port called Parthenope (Παρθενόπη, meaning &quot;Pure Eyes&quot;, a Siren in Greek mythology), which was established by Greek colonial sailors from Rhodes. The region thus became one of the centers of Magna Graecia.

At one point in history, a distinct group of Oscan-speaking tribes from Samnium (in south-central Italy), the Samnites, moved down into Campania.
Since the Samnites were more warlike than the other Oscan populations, they easily took over the cities of Capua and Cumae, in an area which was one of the most prosperous and fertile in the Italian Peninsula at the time. During the 340s BC, the Samnites were engaged in a war with the Roman Republic in a dispute known as the Samnite Wars, with Rome claiming the rich pastures of northern Campania during the First Samnite War. The First Samnite War was initiated when the Etruscan-influenced Oscan city of Capua (in Etruscan &quot;Capeva&quot;) was being attacked by the Samnites, and thus appealed to Rome for defensive help.

As the majority of Southern Italy was under Roman control at the time, the sole major remaining independent settlement in the region was the Greek colony of Neapolis, and when the city was eventually captured by the Samnites, the Neapolitan Greeks were left with no option but to call on the Romans, with whom they established an alliance, setting off the Second Samnite War. The Roman consul Quintus Publilius Filo recaptured Neapolis by 326 BC and allowed it to remain a Greek city with some autonomy as a &quot;civitas foederata&quot; while strongly aligned with Rome. The Second Samnite War ended with the Romans controlling all of southern Campania and additional regions further to the south, such as parts of Lucania.

===Roman period===

Campania was a full-fledged part of the Roman Republic by the end of the 4th century BC, valued for its pastures and rich countryside. Naples, with its Greek language and customs, made it a centre of Hellenistic culture for the Romans, creating the first traces of Greco-Roman culture. During the Pyrrhic War in 275 BC, the Battle of Beneventum took place in Campania in the Samnite city of Maleventum, in which the Romans, led by the consul Curius Dentatus, were victorious. They renamed it Beneventum (modern day Benevento), which grew in stature until it was second only to Capua in southern Italy. During the Second Punic War in 216 BC, Capua, in a bid for equality with Rome, allied with Carthage. The rebellious Capuans were isolated from the rest of Campania, which remained allies of Rome. Naples resisted Hannibal due to the imposing walls. Capua was eventually starved into submission in the Roman retaking of 211 BC, and the Romans were victorious.

With the initial exception of Naples, the region adopted Latin as official language, in that sense gradually replacing the native Oscan and the Greek and the Etruscan still talked respectively in their colonies of the region, subsequently becoming fully Romanised. As part of the Roman Empire, Campania, with Latium, formed the most important region of the Augustan divisions of Italia, the &quot;Regio I Latium et Campania&quot;; Campania was one of the main areas for granary. In ancient times Misenum (modern &#x27;Miseno&#x27;), at the extreme northern end of the bay of Naples, was the largest base of the Roman navy, since its port (Portus Julius) was the base of the Classis Misenensis, the most important Roman fleet. It was first established as a naval base in 27 BC by Marcus Agrippa, the right-hand man of the emperor Augustus. Roman Emperors chose Campania as a holiday destination, among them Claudius and Tiberius, the latter of whom is infamously linked to the island of Capri. It was also during this period that Christianity came to Campania. Two of the apostles, St. Peter and St. Paul, are said to have preached in the city of Naples, and there were also several martyrs during this time. The period of relative calm was violently interrupted by the epic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 which buried the cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum. With the Decline of the Roman Empire, its last emperor, Romulus Augustus, was put in a manor house prison near Castel dell&#x27;Ovo, Naples, in 476, ushering in the beginning of the Middle Ages and a period of uncertainty in regard to the future of the area.

===Feudalism in the Middle Ages===
The area had many duchies and principalities during the Middle Ages, in the hands of the Byzantine Empire (also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire) and the Lombards. Under the Normans, the smaller independent states were brought together as part of the Kingdom of Sicily, before the mainland broke away to form the Kingdom of Naples. It was during this period that elements of Spanish, French and Aragonese culture were introduced to Campania. Allegiances with the Muslim Saracens were made in 836, and the Arabs were requested to repel the siege of Lombard troops coming from the neighbouring Duchy of Benevento.

===The Kingdom===

====Norman to Angevin====
After a period as a Norman kingdom, the Kingdom of Sicily passed to the Hohenstaufens, who were a powerful Germanic royal house of Swabian origins. The University of Naples Federico II was founded by Frederick II in the city, the oldest state university in the world, making Naples the intellectual centre of the kingdom. Conflict between the Hohenstaufen house and the Papacy, led in 1266 to Pope Innocent IV crowning Angevin Dynasty duke Charles I as the king. Charles officially moved the capital from Palermo to Naples where he resided at the &quot;Castel Nuovo&quot;. During this period, much Gothic architecture sprang up around Naples, including the Naples Cathedral, the main church of the city.

In 1281, with the advent of the Sicilian Vespers, the kingdom split in half. The Angevin Kingdom of Naples included the southern part of the Italian peninsula, while the island of Sicily became the Aragonese Kingdom of Sicily. The wars continued until the peace of Caltabellotta in 1302, which saw Frederick III recognised as king of the Isle of Sicily, while Charles II was recognised as the king of Naples by Pope Boniface VIII. Despite the split, Naples grew in importance, attracting Pisan and Genoese merchants, Tuscan bankers, and with them some of the most championed Renaissance artists of the time, such as Boccaccio, Petrarch and Giotto. Alfonso I conquered Naples after his victory against the last Angevin king, René, and Naples was unified for a brief period with Sicily again.

====Aragonese to Bourbon====
Sicily and Naples were separated in 1458 but remained as dependencies of Aragon under Ferrante. The new dynasty enhanced Naples&#x27; commerce by establishing relations with the Iberian Peninsula. Naples also became a centre of the Renaissance, with artists such as Laurana, da Messina, Sannazzaro and Poliziano arriving in the city. During 1501 Naples came under direct rule from France at the time of Louis XII, as Neapolitan king Frederick was taken as a prisoner to France; this lasted four years. Spain won Naples at the Battle of Garigliano and, as a result, Naples then became part of the Spanish Empire throughout the entire Habsburg Spain period. The Spanish sent viceroys to Naples to directly deal with local issues: the most important of which was Pedro Álvarez de Toledo, who was responsible for considerable social, economic and urban progress in the city; he also supported the Inquisition.

During this period Naples became Europe&#x27;s second largest city after Paris. During the Baroque era it was home to artists including Caravaggio, Rosa and Bernini; philosophers such as Telesio, Bruno, Campanella and Vico; and writers such as Battista Marino. A revolution led by local fisherman Masaniello saw the creation of a brief independent Neapolitan Republic, though this lasted only a few months before Spanish rule was regained. Finally, by 1714, the Spanish ceased to rule Naples as a result of the War of the Spanish Succession; it was the Austrian Charles VI who ruled from Vienna, similarly, with viceroys. However, the
War of the Polish Succession saw the Spanish regain Sicily and Naples as part of a personal union, which in the Treaty of Vienna were recognised as independent under a cadet branch of the Spanish Bourbons in 1738 under Charles VII.

During the time of Ferdinand IV, the French Revolution made its way to Naples: Horatio Nelson, an ally of the Bourbons, even arrived in the city in 1798 to warn against it. However, Ferdinand was forced to retreat and fled to Palermo, where he was protected by a British fleet. Naples&#x27; lower classes (the &quot;lazzaroni&quot;) were pious and Royalist, favouring the Bourbons; in the mêlée that followed, they fought the Neapolitan pro-Republican aristocracy, causing a civil war. The Republicans conquered Castel Sant&#x27;Elmo and proclaimed a Parthenopaean Republic, secured by the French Army. A counter-revolutionary religious army of &quot;lazzaroni&quot; under Fabrizio Ruffo was raised; they had great success and the French surrendered the Neapolitan castles and were allowed to sail back to Toulon.

Ferdinand IV was restored as king; however, after only seven years Napoleon conquered the kingdom and instated Bonapartist kings including his brother Joseph Bonaparte. With the help of the Austrian Empire and allies, the Bonapartists were defeated in the Neapolitan War and Bourbon Ferdinand IV once again regained the throne and the kingdom. The Congress of Vienna in 1815 saw the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily combined to form the Two Sicilies, with Naples as the capital city. Naples became the first city on the Italian peninsula to have a railway in 1839, there were many factories throughout the kingdom making it a highly important trade centre.

===World War II===
In September 1943, Salerno was the scene of Operation Avalanche and suffered a great deal of damage. From 12 February to 17 July 1944, it hosted the Government of Marshal Pietro Badoglio. In those months Salerno was the temporary &quot;Capital of the Kingdom of Italy&quot;, and the King Victor Emmanuel III lived in a mansion in its outskirts. Salerno received the first &quot;Tricolore&quot; in an official ceremony on 7 January 2012 from the premier Mario Monti, to celebrate the glorious story of Italy and its old capitals.

==Geography==

Campania has an area of and a coastline of on the Tyrrhenian Sea. Campania is famous for its gulfs (Naples, Salerno and Policastro) as well as for three islands (Capri, Ischia and Procida).

Four other regions border Campania; Lazio to the northwest, Molise to the north, Apulia (Puglia) to the northeast and Basilicata to the east.

The mountainous interior is fragmented into several massifs, rarely reaching (Miletto of ), whereas close to the coast there are volcanic massifs: Vesuvio () and Campi Flegrei.

The climate is typically Mediterranean along the coast with warm, sunny and sultry summers and mild, rainy winters, whereas in the inner zones it is more continental, with lower temperatures in winter and warm summers. Snow is possible at higher elevations but rare at sea level. 51% of the total area is hilly, 34% mountainous and the remaining 15% is made up of plains. There is a high seismic risk across the region.
==Economy==
The GDP per capita in Campania is rank 18 from 20 Italian regions, surpassing only Sicily and Calabria. It is only 66.7% of the Italian average. It has been speculated that a factor could be the failure to connect the region&#x27;s economy with the rest of Italy, while another factor could be its peripheral position with respect to the developed central areas of Europe.

Overall, Campania appears to be a region with great economic potential, which is partly held back by organized crime (Camorra) and the resulting corruption. The economy of Campania is one of the most affected nationwide by the economic and financial crisis that began in 2008, but between 2015 and 2016 it came out of the recession and began to recover due to, above all, industry, but also tourism and tertiary.

=== Tourism ===
Tourism is supported by the abundant presence of artistic and naturalistic beauty which attract millions of people from all over the world every year. Precisely in this sector the region finds its strong point (through which it was able to react to the recession in 2015), in fact, according to 2018 studies done by Eurostat, Campania is in the top 20 of the most visited regions in Europe and fifth in Italy after Lombardy, Lazio, Veneto and Tuscany (in order), as well as first among the southern regions.

The tourist flow sees more than half of the Italian and foreign tourists of the entire region gather in the Metropolitan City of Naples. Of all the locations, Pompeii and Herculaneum stand out, two of the most visited archaeological sites in Italy and among the most visited in the world where there is an average of four million tourists a year. Then there are the Campanian Archipelago (Capri, Ischia and Procida, the latter named Italian capital of culture in 2022), Vesuvius and the Sorrento coast; a notable growth in the cruise sector was observed in the Port of Naples.

Tourist data on other sites in Campania show important records that the region holds nationally and worldwide. Among these above all the data relating to Capri (which is the most visited minor island in Italy and among the most sought-after in the world), the Amalfi Coast (which is among the most visited sites in Italy) and finally Vesuvius (the most visited and well-known volcano in the world). There is also a growing influx of tourists to Cilento (Paestum and Certosa di Padula.

Campania has many small and picturesque villages, 11 of them have been selected by (), a non-profit private association of small Italian towns of strong historical and artistic interest, that was founded on the initiative of the Tourism Council of the National Association of Italian Municipalities.

=== Decline of heavy industry ===

Campania is traditionally the most industrialized region of southern Italy, particularly the Neapolitan territory was one of the most industrialized areas of Italy until the beginning of the 20th century, preceded only by the provinces of the so-called &quot;industrial triangle&quot; (Milan, Turin and Genoa).

In recent decades, the gap with respect to other regions is no longer as significant as it used to be, given that southern regions such as Apulia and Abruzzo have grown considerably economically, while Campania has paradoxically undergone a constant process of de-industrialisation. The symbol of this phenomenon is the reclamation process of the area in Bagnoli where the former Italsider and Eternit operated promoted by the region.

=== Food and agriculture ===
Campania mainly produces fruit and vegetables, but has also expanded its production of flowers grown in greenhouses, becoming one of the leading regions of the sector in Italy. In 2021 the value added of this sector represents around 2.34% of the total value added of the region, equalling €2.2 billion. Campania produces over 50% of Italy&#x27;s nuts and is also the leader in the production of tomatoes.

Typical products are:
A distinctive point of regional agriculture in the breeding of buffalos. The milk is used to produce mozzarella di bufala.

Olive trees, mainly of the varieties Carpellese (PDO designated), Cornia (Val di Cornia DOC), Frantoio, Leccino, Ogliarola Barese, Olivella, Ortice, Pisciottana (Also Ogliastrina or Olivo dell&#x27;Ascea), Ravece (also known as Rotondello), and Salella, covers over .

Vineyards cover 41,129 ha, but only ca. 5,100 ha using to produce quality wine of DOC and DOCG types. There are 4 DOCG wines: Aglianico del Taburno (red and rose), Fiano di Avellino (white), Greco di Tufo (white and sparkling) and Taurasi (red). Wine production has increased as well as the quality of the wine.

There is a problem with illegal toxic waste dump in the Triangle of death north of Naples between Acerra, Nola and Marigliano. In the region, over 12,000 cattle, river buffaloes and sheep had been culled before 2006. High levels of mortality and abnormal foetuses were also recorded in farms in Acerra linked to elevated levels of dioxin. Local studies have shown higher than permissible levels of lead in vegetables grown in the area. The government blames the Mafia&#x27;s illegal garbage disposal racket. In samples of milk, which is using to produce mozzarella di bufala, found cancerogenic dioxine. In Naples-Bagnoli is an asbestos contamination from former Eternit cement plant. Millions of tons of toxic industrial waste has been dumped in Campania, not only in the Triangle of death, a region once celebrated for the fertility of its soil, but now the local population have been exposed to land contaminated with waste. This includes highly dangerous materials such as asbestos, zinc, lead, germanium, arsenic, mercury, cadmium, chromium, dioxin and uranium. Blood tests of people living in Campania show alarming levels of dioxins.

=== Automotive ===

Campania had a massive automotive industrial production till 2011, focused on Alfa Romeo. Production of Alfa Romeo was reduced and relocated to a plant in Cassino near Rome. Currently only one low-level Fiat Panda model is produced in facilities located in Pomigliano d&#x27;Arco in the Naples metropolitan area (140,478 units in 2020). A FIAT plant manufacturing engines is in Pratola Serra, Avellino. There are also plants for automotive parts suppliers like Magneti Marelli (exhaust systems) and Denso (engine cooling and air-conditioners). Buses are produced by Industria Italiana Autobus in Flumeri (ex-Irisbus).

=== Aerospace and rail ===
There is also a significant aerospace industry:
* A failed Mars mission named ExoMars in 2016 had a major part of its technology designed in Naples No signal indicating a successful landing was received.
* Also in Pomigliano d&#x27;Arco there are a Leonardo plant, which produces the fuselage and tail of ATR planes and an Avio Aero plant, which manufactures parts of gas turbines. Benevento has a Leonardo Helicopters plant (aluminum and magnesium castings)
* Radars for military and air traffic control applications and components are produced by two other Leonardo establishments in Giugliano in Campania and Bacoli
* Vulcanair in Casoria manufactures light aircraft
* Seekers for missiles are made in Bacoli-Fusaro by MBDA

Hitachi Rail Italy has headquarters, manufacturing plant and service facilities in Naples. Here it produces the metro trains Meneghino and Driverless Metro.

=== Fashion ===
Luxury brands like Kiton, Cesare Attolini, Isaia, Rubinacci, Harmont &amp; Blaine, E. Marinella are also located in Campania. All of them are relative small-sized with annual sales of less than 100 million euros each.

=== Other industrial districts ===
There are other industrial districts in Campania:

* Jewelry in Marcianise, one of the four located in Italy. It has 350 companies with ca. 2500 employees, and the annual turnover is 750 million euros. Every two years there is a special fair.
* Coral products, cameos and nacre in Torre del Greco. Since 1989 in Torre del Greco coral fishing is not practised, but the town still remains the most important centre in the world for coral processing, with over 2,000 employees in the sector. 
* Leather tanning in Solofra extends over an area of about 60 km2 in the south-western area of the province of Avellino, including also Montoro and Serino. This area is specialized in the tanning of sheep and goatskins, for a total of about 400 companies operating in the sector including tanneries, subcontractors and garment manufacturers, 4,000–4,500 employees and an average annual turnover of 1,500 million euros. It specializes in the processing of leathers for clothing, shoes and leather goods. 
* Shoe making in Grumo Nevano, Aversa, Trentola Ducenta

=== Transport ===

The region has a dense network of roads and motorways, a system of maritime connections and an international airport (Naples Airport). The port of Naples connects the region with the Mediterranean basin, and brings tourists to the archaeological sites, the cities of art (Naples and Caserta), to the coastal areas and to the islands.

==== Rail ====
There are high-speed rail lines:
* Rome–Naples
* Naples–Salerno

There is a maintenance and service centre for high-speed trains Alstom AGV in Nola.

==== Maritime ====

Sea-based activity accounts for about 3.9% of the economy, which includes port movements of goods and passengers and sea transportation, as well as a sizable seaside tourism economy. In Castellammare di Stabia there is a big Fincantieri shipyard. Shipping companies Grimaldi and Tirrenia both headquarter in Naples.

=== Service ===
The services sector makes up for 78% of the region&#x27;s gross domestic product.

=== Unemployment ===
The unemployment rate stood at 17.4% in 2022 and was one of the highest in Italy.
==Demographics==
The region, with a population of over 5.8 million inhabitants, is divided into five provinces: Naples, Benevento, Avellino, Caserta and Salerno. Over half of the population is resident in the province of Naples, where there is a population density of 2,626 inhabitants per km2. Within the province, the highest density can be found along the coast, where it reaches 13,000 inhabitants per km2 in the city of Portici. The region, which was characterised until recently by an acute economic contrast between internal and coastal areas, has shown an improvement in the last decade thanks to the development of the provinces of Benevento and Avellino. At the same time, the provinces of Naples, Caserta and in part Salerno, have developed a variety of activities connected to advanced types of services.

===Immigration and ethnicity===
Unlike central and northern Italy, in the first decade of the 2000s the region of Campania has not attracted large numbers of immigrants, despite having increased from approximately 100,000 in 2007 to 240,000 in 2021. The Italian national institute of statistics ISTAT estimated in December 2022 that 241,008 foreign-born immigrants live in Campania, equal to 4.32% of the total regional population. Part of the reason for this is in recent times, there have been more employment opportunities in northern regions than in the Southern Italian regions.

==Government and politics==

The Politics of Campania, takes place in a framework of a presidential representative democracy, whereby the President of Regional Government is the head of government, and of a pluriform multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the Regional Government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the Regional Council.

The Regional Council of Campania (&quot;Consiglio Regionale della Campania&quot;) is composed of 60 members, of which 47 are elected in provincial constituencies with proportional representation, 12 from the so-called &quot;regional list&quot; of the elected president and the last one is for the candidate for president who comes second, who usually becomes the leader of the opposition in the council. If a coalition wins more than 55% of the vote, only 6 candidates from the &quot;regional list&quot; will be elected and the number of those elected in provincial constituencies will be 53.

===Administrative divisions===
Campania is divided into four provinces and one metropolitan city:
==Culture==
===Cuisine===
Campanian cuisine varies within the region. While Neapolitan dishes centre on seafood, Casertan and Aversan ones rely more on fresh vegetables and cheeses. The cuisine from Sorrento combines the culinary traditions from both Naples and Salerno. Pizza was conceived in Naples. Spaghetti is also a well-known dish from southern Italy and Campania. 
Campania produces wines including Lacryma Christi, Fiano, Aglianico, Greco di Tufo, Falerno del Massico, Taburno, Solopaca, and Taurasi. The cheeses of Campania consist of Mozzarella di Bufala (buffalo mozzarella) (mozzarella made from buffalo milk), fiordilatte (&quot;flower of milk&quot;) a mozzarella made from cow&#x27;s milk, ricotta from sheep or buffalo milk, provolone from cow milk, and caciotta made from goat milk. Buffalo are bred in the provinces of Salerno and Caserta.

Several different cakes and pies are made in Campania. Pastiera pie is made during Easter. Casatiello and tortano are Easter breads made by adding lard or oil and various types of cheese to bread dough and garnishing it with slices of salami. Babà cake is a well known Neapolitan delicacy, best served with rum or limoncello (a liqueur invented in the Sorrento peninsula). It is an old Austrian cake, which arrived in Campania during the Austrian domination of the Kingdom of Two Sicilies and was modified there to become a &quot;walking cake&quot; for citizens always in a hurry for work and other pursuits. Sfogliatella is another pastry from the Amalfi Coast, as is Zeppole, traditionally eaten on Saint Joseph&#x27;s day. Struffoli, little balls fried dough dipped in honey, are enjoyed during the Christmas holidays.
Another Campanian dish is the so-called Russian salad, also known as Olivier salad, which is based on similar dishes from France. It is made of potatoes in mayonnaise garnished with shrimp and vegetables in vinegar. Another French-derived dish is &quot;gattò&quot; or &quot;gâteau di patate&quot; (an oven-baked pie made of boiled potatoes). As with the Russian salad, Campania is home to popular seafood-based dishes, such as &quot;insalata di mare&quot; (seafood salad), &quot;zuppa di polpo&quot; (octopus soup), and &quot;zuppa di cozze&quot; (mussel soup). Other regional seafood dishes include &quot;frittelle di mare&quot; (fritters with seaweed), made with edible poseidonia algae, &quot;triglie al cartoccio&quot; (red mullet in the bag), and &quot;alici marinate&quot; (fresh anchovies in olive oil). The island of Ischia is known for its fish dishes, as well as for cooked rabbit. Campania is also home to the lemons of Sorrento. Rapini (or Broccoli rabe), known locally as &quot;friarielli&quot;, are often used in regional cooking. Campania also produces many nuts, especially in the area of Avellino, Salerno and Benevento. Hazelnut production is especially relevant in the province of Avellino – in Spanish, in Portuguese and in Occitan the hazelnut is respectively called &quot;avellana&quot;, &quot;avelã&quot; and &quot;avelano&quot;, after the city of Avella. That is also the case of ancient Italian &quot;avellana&quot;, which is however not in use anymore.

===Ancient, medieval, and early arts===
The region of Campania is rich with a vast array of culture and history. Since the Greek colony of Elea, now Velia, Campania was home to philosophers of the Pre-Socratic philosophy school, such as Parmenides and Zeno of Elea, who came to prominence around 490–480 BC. The Latin poet Vergil (70 BC–19 BC) settled in Naples in his late-life: parts of his epic poem Aeneid are located in Campania. The ancient scientist Pliny the Elder studied Mount Vesuvius and died after being poisoned and killed by gas emitted from the volcano during the 79 AD eruption.

Romulus Augustus, the last emperor of the Western Roman Empire, died as a prisoner of the German general Odoacer at Naples around 500. In the Middle Ages, the artist Giotto made some frescoes in Castel Nuovo. These works of art were subsequently destroyed by an earthquake.

By the end of the Middle Ages, the medical school of Salerno, which combined ancient Roman and Greek medicine with Arab medicine, was known throughout Europe and its methods were adopted across the continent. Some have suggested that this may have been one of the first universities in Europe. Boccaccio, the Tuscan poet, visited Naples on various occasions, and in the Decameron described it as a dissolute city. He also wrote a love story involving a noblewoman close to the King of Naples.
In 1570, the Spanish writer Miguel de Cervantes, who wrote the romance novel &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, served as a Spanish soldier for a period in Naples. Poet Torquato Tasso was born in Sorrento in 1575. Years earlier in 1558, the first modern description and studies of the &quot;camera obscura&quot; (&quot;dark chamber&quot;), were established in Italy by Giovanni Battista della Porta in his &quot; Magiae Naturalis&quot;.

Philosopher Giordano Bruno was born in Nola. He was the first to theorize infinite suns and infinite worlds in the universe. He was burnt in Rome by the Spanish Inquisition in 1600. Later, in , the Baroque painter Caravaggio established his studio in Naples. Italian Baroque architect Cosimo Fanzago from Bergamo also decided to move to Naples.

In the 18th century, Naples was the last city to be visited by philosophers who created the &quot;Grand Tour&quot; which was the big touring voyage to visit all the important cultural sites of the European continent. Italian architect Luigi Vanvitelli son of Dutch architect Caspar van Wittel built the Royal Palace in Caserta in .

<text>The&#x27;Ndrangheta (, , ) is an Italian mafia-type criminal syndicate, based in the peninsular region of Calabria and dating back to the 19th century. Although loosely structured, it is considered one of the most powerful organized crime groups in the world. It is characterized by a horizontal structure made up of autonomous clans known as &quot;&#x27;ndrine&quot;, based almost exclusively on blood ties. Since the 1950s, following wide-scale emigration from Calabria, &#x27;Ndrangheta clans dispersed to other European countries, Australia and the Americas. Currently, its main activity is drug trafficking, but it also deals with arms trafficking, money laundering, racketeering, extortion, and loan sharking.

It is capable of influencing local and national Italian politics, and infiltrating sectors of the legal economy in Italy and some other countries. In 2013, they purportedly made €53 billion. In 2010, a US diplomat estimated that the organization&#x27;s drug trafficking, extortion and money laundering activities accounted for at least three per cent of Italy&#x27;s GDP. The &#x27;Ndrangheta has existed for as long as the better-known Sicilian Cosa Nostra, but was only designated as a Mafia-type association in 2010 under Article 416 bis of the Italian penal code. Italy&#x27;s highest court of last resort, the Supreme Court of Cassation, had ruled similarly in March 2010.

==Etymology==
In folk culture surrounding &#x27;Ndrangheta in Calabria, references to the Spanish Garduña often appear. Aside from these references, however, there is nothing to substantiate a link between the two organizations. The Calabrian word &#x27;Ndrangheta derives from the Greek word ἀνδραγαθία &quot;andragathía&quot; meaning &quot;gallantry&quot; or &quot;manly virtue&quot; or ἀνδράγαθος &quot;andrágathos&quot;, a compound of the words ἀνήρ, &quot;anḗr&quot; (gen. ἀνδρóς, &quot;andrós&quot;), i.e. man, and ἀγαθός, &quot;agathós&quot;, i.e. good, brave, meaning a courageous man. In many areas of Calabria the verb ndranghitiari&quot;, from the Greek verb &quot;andragathízesthai&quot;, means &quot;to engage in a defiant and valiant attitude&quot;.

The etymological approach is criticised by some historians. John Dickie argues that &quot;the flattering connotations of the word &#x27;Ndrangheta (courage, martial prowess, manliness) indicate that the &#x27;Ndrangheta as a social phenomenon was rooted in the same positive values, and that it only later degenerated into criminality.&quot; A historical and sociological approach shows that &#x27;Ndrangheta is actually the most recent of many earlier descriptions of the phenomenon of organised crime in Calabria. Historical evidence suggests, according to Dickie, that the use of &#x27;Ndrangheta as a name for the Calabrian mafia was adopted by Calabrian mafiosi themselves around the time it first appeared in the documentary sources of the Carabinieri in the late 1920s. The word &#x27;Ndrangheta was brought to a wider audience by the Calabrian writer Corrado Alvaro in the in September 1955.

== Structure ==
=== Organizational structure ===


Both the Sicilian Cosa Nostra and the &#x27;Ndrangheta are loose confederations of about one hundred organized groups, also called or families, each of which claims sovereignty over a territory, usually a town or village, though without ever fully conquering and legitimizing its monopoly of violence. There are approximately 100 of these families, totaling between 4,000 and 5,000 members in Reggio Calabria. Other estimates mention 6,000–7,000 men. Worldwide there might be some 10,000 members.

Most of the groups (86) operate in the Province of Reggio Calabria, although a portion of the recorded 70 criminal groups based in the Calabrian provinces Catanzaro and Cosenza also appear to be formally affiliated with the &#x27;Ndrangheta. The families are concentrated in poor villages in Calabria such as Platì, Locri, San Luca, Africo and Altomonte as well as the main city and provincial capital Reggio Calabria. San Luca is considered to be the stronghold of the &#x27;Ndrangheta. According to a former &#x27;ndranghetista, &quot;almost all the male inhabitants belong to the &#x27;Ndrangheta, and the Sanctuary of Polsi has long been the meeting place of the affiliates.&quot; Bosses from outside Calabria, from as far as Canada and Australia, regularly attend the meetings at the Sanctuary of Polsi, an indication that the &quot;&#x27;ndrine&quot; around the world perceive themselves as being part of the same collective entity.

The basic local organizational unit of the &#x27;Ndrangheta is called a &quot;locale&quot; (local or place) with jurisdiction over an entire town or an area in a large urban center. A &quot;locale&quot; may have branches, called &quot; &#x27;ndrina&quot; (plural: &quot; &#x27;ndrine&quot;), in the districts of the same city, in neighbouring towns and villages, or even outside Calabria, in cities and towns in the industrial North of Italy in and around Turin and Milan: for example, Bardonecchia, an alpine town in the province of Turin in Piedmont, where the presence of the &#x27;Ndrangheta has been attested since the early 60s. In 1973 the Antimafia Commission, drawn by the numerous articles in the newspapers, made an inspection on the territory of Bardonecchia, and confirmed the presence of organized crime. . In 1995 Bardonecchia has been, the first municipality in northern Italy dissolved for alleged mafia infiltration, with the arrest of Rocco Lo Presti, the historical &#x27;Ndrangheta boss of Bardonecchia and Susa Valley.

The small towns of Corsico and Buccinasco in Lombardy are considered to be strongholds of the &#x27;Ndrangheta. Sometimes &quot;sotto &#x27;ndrine&quot; are established. These subunits enjoy a high degree of autonomy – they have a leader and independent staff. In some contexts the &quot; &#x27;ndrine&quot; have become more powerful than the &quot;locale&quot; on which they formally depend. Other observers maintain that the &quot; &#x27;ndrina&quot; is the basic organizational unit. Each &quot; &#x27;ndrina&quot; is &quot;autonomous on its territory and no formal authority stands above the &quot;&quot; &#x27;ndrina&quot; boss&quot;, according to the Antimafia Commission. The &quot; &#x27;ndrina&quot; is usually in control of a small town or a neighborhood. If more than one &quot; &#x27;ndrina&quot; operates in the same town, they form a &quot;locale&quot;.

Blood family and membership of the crime family overlap to a great extent within the &#x27;Ndrangheta. By and large, the &quot; &#x27;ndrine&quot; consist of men belonging to the same family lineage. Salvatore Boemi, anti-mafia prosecutor in Reggio Calabria, told the Italian Antimafia Commission that &quot;one becomes a member for the simple fact of being born in a mafia family&quot;, although other reasons might attract a young man to seek membership, and non-kin have also been admitted. Marriages help cement relations within each &quot; &#x27;ndrina&quot; and to expand membership. As a result, a few blood families constitute each group, hence &quot;a high number of people with the same last name often end up being prosecuted for membership of a given &quot;″ndrina&quot;.&quot; Indeed, since there is no limit to the membership of a single unit, bosses try to maximize descendants.

At the bottom of the chain of command are the &quot;picciotti d&#x27;onore&quot; or soldiers, who are expected to perform tasks with blind obedience until they are promoted to the next level of &quot;cammorista&quot;, where they will be granted command over their own group of soldiers. The next level, separated by the &quot; &#x27;ndrina&quot; but part of &#x27;Ndrangheta, is known as &quot;santista&quot; and higher still is the &quot;vangelista&quot;, upon which the up-and-coming gangster has to swear their dedication to a life of crime on the Bible. The &quot;Quintino&quot;, also called &quot;Padrino&quot;, is the second-highest level of command in a &#x27;Ndrangheta clan (name &quot;Ndrina&quot;), being made up of five privileged members of the crime family who report directly to the boss, the &quot;capobastone&quot; (head of command).

During a 2018 trial in Toronto, ex-mobster Carmine Guido told the court that the &#x27;Ndrangheta is a collection of family-based clans, each with its own boss, working within a uniform structure and under board of control.

=== Power structure ===
For many years, the power apparatus of the single families were the sole ruling bodies within the two associations, and they have remained the real centres of power even after superordinate bodies were created in the Cosa Nostra beginning in the 1950s (the Sicilian Mafia Commission) and in the &#x27;Ndrangheta a superordinate body was created only in 1991 as the result of negotiations to end years of inter-family violence. However, the absolute autonomy of Calabrian crime families prior to this is not supported by historical evidence. At least since the end of the 19th century, some stable mechanisms for coordination and dispute settlement have existed. Contacts and meetings among the bosses of the &quot;locali&quot; were frequent. A investigation, known as Operation Crimine, which ended in July 2010 with an arrest of 305 &#x27;Ndrangheta members revealed that the &#x27;Ndrangheta was extremely &quot;hierarchical, united and pyramidal&quot;, and not just clan-based as previously believed, as said by Italy&#x27;s chief anti-mafia prosecutor Pietro Grasso.

Although the legal definition of the &#x27;Ndrangheta as a hierarchical structure is legally attractive because of the wider possibilities in Italian criminal law to convict criminals from different clans through the doctrine of criminal association, criminologists have challenged the view of the &#x27;Ndrangheta as a stable, monolithic criminal association. While there are coordinating structures, according to criminologist Anna Sergi, these are mainly used by distinct clans to boost business and share risks, but the clans remain single territorial units, based on blood and family ties, and do not act jointly with a common strategic design. The name &quot;&#x27;Ndrangheta&quot; is more like a brand, rather than describing a tightly knit organisation. According to Sergi &quot;the misconception of the &#x27;Ndrangheta as a single organisation is likely to work to the advantage of such groups&quot; and &quot;invoke the &#x27;Ndrangheta&#x27;s formidable international reputation to exploit weak political systems, invest in new ventures and grow.&quot;

At least since the 1950s, the chiefs of the &#x27;Ndrangheta &quot;locali&quot; have met regularly near the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Polsi in the municipality of San Luca during the September Feast. These annual meetings, known as the &quot;crimine&quot;, have traditionally served as a forum to discuss future strategies and settle disputes among the &quot;locali&quot;. The assembly exercises weak supervisory powers over the activities of all &#x27;Ndrangheta groups. Strong emphasis was placed on the temporary character of the position of the &quot;crimine&quot; boss. A new representative was elected at each meeting. Far from being the &quot;boss of bosses&quot;, the &quot;capo crimine&quot; actually has comparatively little authority to interfere in family feuds or to control the level of interfamily violence.

At these meetings, every boss &quot;must give account of all the activities carried out during the year and of all the most important facts taking place in his territory such as kidnappings, homicides, etc.&quot; The historical preeminence of the San Luca family is such that every new group or &quot;locale&quot; must obtain its authorization to operate and every group belonging to the &#x27;Ndrangheta &quot;still has to deposit a small percentage of illicit proceeds to the &quot;principale&quot; of San Luca in recognition of the latter&#x27;s primordial supremacy&quot;.

Security concerns have led to the creation in the &#x27;Ndrangheta of a secret society within the secret society: &quot;La Santa&quot;. Membership in the &quot;Santa&quot; is known only to other members. Contrary to the code, it allowed bosses to establish close connections with state representatives, even to the extent that some were affiliated with the &quot;Santa&quot;. These connections were often established through Freemasonry, which the &quot;santisti&quot; – breaking another rule of the traditional code – were allowed to join.

Since the end of the Second &#x27;Ndrangheta war in 1991, the &#x27;Ndrangheta is ruled by a collegial body or Commission, known as &quot;La Provincia&quot;. Its primary function is the settlement of inter-family disputes. The body, also referred to as the Commission in reference to its Sicilian counterpart, is composed of three lower bodies, known as &quot;mandamenti&quot;. One for the clans on the Ionic side (the Aspromonte mountains and Locride) of Calabria, a second for the Tyrrhenian side (the plains of Gioia Tauro) and one central &quot;mandamento&quot; for the city of Reggio Calabria.

An article published in July 2019 in Canada, summarized the traditional structure. &quot;For decades, the &#x27;Ndrangheta families of Siderno operating in Canada—about seven of them—have been governed by a board of directors, called the &quot;camera di controllo&quot;, or chamber of control. The local board, as in other countries around the world and other regions of Italy where clans have spread, have all been subservient to the mother clans of Calabria, under a body known as &#x27;il Crimine di Siderno&#x27;&quot;.

By mid-2019, however, police in both countries were convinced that &quot;the &#x27;Ndrangheta&#x27;s Canadian presence has become so powerful and influential that the board north of Toronto has the authority to make decisions, not only in relation to Canada&#x27;s underworld, but also abroad, even back in Siderno&quot;.

== Characteristics ==
In 2007, Italian anti-organized crime agencies estimated that the &#x27;Ndrangheta has an annual revenue of about €35–40 billion (US$35–40 billion), which amounts to approximately 3.5% of the GDP of Italy. This comes mostly from illegal drug trafficking, but also from ostensibly legal businesses such as construction, restaurants and supermarkets. The &#x27;Ndrangheta has a strong grip on the economy and governance in Calabria. According to a leaked US Embassy cable, the &#x27;Ndrangheta controls huge segments of its territory and economy, and accounts for at least three percent of Italy&#x27;s GDP through drug trafficking, extortion, skimming of public contracts, and usury.

The principal difference with the Mafia is in recruitment methods. The &#x27;Ndrangheta recruits members on the criterion of blood relationships resulting in an extraordinary cohesion within the family clan that presents a major obstacle to investigation. Sons of &quot;&#x27;ndranghetisti&quot; are expected to follow in their fathers&#x27; footsteps, and go through a grooming process in their youth to become &quot;giovani d&#x27;onore&quot; (&#x27;boys of honour&#x27;) before they eventually enter the ranks as &quot;uomini d&#x27;onore&quot; (&#x27;men of honour&#x27;). There are relatively few Calabrian mafiosi who have opted out to become a pentito; at the end of 2002, there were 157 Calabrian witnesses in the state witness protection program. Unlike the Sicilian Mafia in the early 1990s, they have meticulously avoided a head-on confrontation with the Italian state.

Prosecution in Calabria is hindered by the fact that Italian judges and prosecutors who score highly in exams get to choose their posting; those who are forced to work in Calabria will usually request to be transferred right away. With weak government presence and corrupt officials, few civilians are willing to speak out against the organization.

In the 2018 book, &quot;The Good Mothers: The True Story of the Women Who Took on the World&#x27;s Most Powerful Mafia&quot;, Alex Perry reports that the Calabrian &#x27;Ndrangheta has, for the past decade, been replacing the Sicilian Cosa Nostra as the primary drug traffickers in North America.

== Activities ==
According to Italian DIA (&quot;Direzione Investigativa Antimafia&quot;, Department of the Police of Italy against organized crime) and Guardia di Finanza (Italian Financial Police and Customs Police) the &quot;&#x27;Ndrangheta is now one of the most powerful criminal organizations in the world.&quot; Economic activities of &#x27;Ndrangheta include international cocaine and weapons smuggling, with Italian investigators estimating that 80% of Europe&#x27;s cocaine passes through the Calabrian port of Gioia Tauro and is controlled by the &#x27;Ndrangheta. However, according to a report of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) and Europol, the Iberian peninsula is considered the main entry point for cocaine into Europe and a gateway to the European market. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimated that in 2007 nearly ten times as much cocaine was intercepted in Spain (almost 38 MT) in comparison with Italy (almost 4 MT).

&#x27;Ndrangheta groups and Sicilian Cosa Nostra groups sometimes act as joint ventures in cocaine trafficking enterprises.
Further activities include skimming money off large public work construction projects, money laundering and traditional crimes such as usury and extortion. &#x27;Ndrangheta invests illegal profits in legal real estate and financial activities.

In early February 2017, the Carabinieri arrested 33 suspects in the Calabrian mafia&#x27;s Piromalli &#x27;ndrina (&#x27;Ndrangheta) which was allegedly exporting fake extra virgin olive oil to the U.S.; the product was actually inexpensive olive pomace oil fraudulently labeled. In early 2016, the American television program 60 Minutes had warned that &quot;the olive oil business has been corrupted by the Mafia&quot; and that &quot;Agromafia&quot; was $16-billion per year enterprise.

The business volume of the &#x27;Ndrangheta is estimated at almost € 44 billion in 2007, approximately 2.9% of Italy&#x27;s GDP, according to a private research institute, Eurispes (Institute of Political, Economic and Social Studies) in Italy. Drug trafficking is the most profitable activity with 62% of the total turnover.

== History ==
In 1861, the prefect of Reggio Calabria noticed the presence of so-called &quot;camorristi&quot;, a term used at the time since there was no formal name for the phenomenon in Calabria (the Camorra was the older and better known criminal organization in Naples). Since the 1880s, there is ample evidence of &#x27;Ndrangheta-type groups in police reports and sentences by local courts. At the time they were often being referred to as the &quot;picciotteria&quot;, &quot;onorata società&quot; (honoured society), &quot;&#x27;ndrina&quot;, &quot;Famiglia Montalbano&quot;, &quot;fibbia&quot;, or &quot;camorra&quot; and &quot;mafia&quot;. These secret societies in the areas of Calabria rich in olives and vines were distinct from the often anarchic forms of local banditry and were organized hierarchically with a code of conduct that included omertà – the code of silence – according to a sentence from the court in Reggio Calabria in 1890. An 1897 sentence from the court in Palmi mentioned a written code of rules found in the village of Seminara based on honour, secrecy, violence, solidarity, often based on blood relationships, and mutual assistance.

===Modern history===
Until the 1960s, the &#x27;Ndrangheta restricted their Italian operations to Calabria, mainly involved in extortion and blackmail. Their involvement in cigarette contraband expanded their scope and contacts with the Sicilian Mafia and the Neapolitan Camorra. With the arrival of large public works in Calabria, skimming of public contracts became an important source of income. Disagreements over how to distribute the spoils led to the First &#x27;Ndrangheta war (1974–77) killing 233 people. The prevailing factions began to kidnap rich people located in northern Italy for ransom. A high-profile case was the 1973 kidnapping of John Paul Getty III, who had his severed ear mailed to a newspaper in November, and later released in December following the negotiated payment of $2.2 million by Getty&#x27;s grandfather, J. Paul Getty. There were reportedly more than 200 abductions between the 1970s and mid-1990s acredited to the &#x27;Ndrangheta.

The Second &#x27;Ndrangheta war raged from 1985 to 1991. The bloody six-year war between the Condello-Imerti-Serraino-Rosmini clans and the De Stefano-Tegano-Libri-Latella clans led to more than 600 deaths. The Sicilian Mafia contributed to the end of the conflict and probably suggested the subsequent set up of a superordinate body, called La Provincia, to avoid further infighting.

Deputy President of the regional parliament of Calabria Francesco Fortugno was killed by the &#x27;Ndrangheta on 16 October 2005 in Locri. Demonstrations against the organization then ensued, with young protesters carrying banderoles reading &quot;Ammazzateci tutti!&quot;, Italian for &quot;Kill us all&quot;. The national government started a large-scale enforcement operation in Calabria and arrested numerous &#x27;ndranghetisti including the murderers of Fortugno.

In June 2014, Pope Francis denounced the &#x27;Ndrangheta for their &quot;adoration of evil and contempt of the common good&quot; and vowed that the Church would help tackle organized crime, saying that Mafiosi were excommunicated. A spokesperson for the Vatican clarified that the pope&#x27;s words did not constitute a formal excommunication under canon law, as a period of legal process is required beforehand.

== Law enforcement operations in Italy ==
The &#x27;Ndrangheta has expanded its activities to Northern Italy, mainly to sell drugs and to invest in legal businesses which could be used for money laundering. In May 2007 twenty members of &#x27;Ndrangheta were arrested in Milan. On 30 August 2007, hundreds of police raided the town of San Luca, the focal point of the bitter San Luca feud between rival clans among the &#x27;Ndrangheta. Over 30 men and women, linked to the killing of six Italian men in Germany, were arrested.

On 4 June 2012, numerous arrests in Spain, Croatia, Slovenia, Italy, the Netherlands, Bulgaria, and Finland were made following the Milan District Anti-Mafia Prosecutor&#x27;s Office investigation into several Switzerland bank accounts and a fleet of ships that supported cocaine shipped to Europe from Venezuela, Argentina, and the Dominican Republic.

On 9 October 2012, following a months-long investigation by the central government, the City Council of Reggio Calabria headed by Mayor was dissolved for alleged ties to the group. Arena and all the 30 city councilors were sacked to prevent any &quot;mafia contagion&quot; in the local government.
This was the first time a government of a capital of a provincial government was dismissed. Three central government-appointed administrators governed the city for 18 months until new elections. The move came after unnamed councilors were suspected of having ties to the &#x27;Ndrangheta under the 10-year centre-right rule of Mayor Giuseppe Scopelliti.

&#x27;Ndrangheta infiltration of political offices is not limited to Calabria. On 10 October 2012, the commissioner of Milan&#x27;s regional government in charge of public housing, Domenico Zambetti of People of Freedom (PDL), was arrested on accusations he paid the &#x27;Ndrangheta in exchange for an election victory and to extort favours and contracts from the housing official, including construction tenders for the World Expo 2015 in Milan. The probe of alleged vote-buying underscores the infiltration of the &#x27;Ndrangheta in the political machine of Italy&#x27;s affluent northern Lombardy region. Zambetti&#x27;s arrest marked the biggest case of &#x27;Ndrangheta infiltration so far uncovered in northern Italy and prompted calls for Lombardy governor Roberto Formigoni to resign.

On 12 December 2017, 48 members of &#x27;Ndrangheta were arrested for mafia association, extortion, criminal damage, fraudulent transferral of assets and illegal possession of firearms. Out of the 48 arrested, four were forced to house arrest and 44 were ordered to jail detention. Two-time mayor of Taurianova, Calabria and his former cabinet member were among the indicted. It was alleged by investigators that the Calabrian clans had infiltrated construction of public works, control of real estate brokerage, food fields, greenhouse production and renewable energy.

On 9 January 2018, law enforcement in Italy and Germany arrested 169 people in connection with the &#x27;Ndrangheta mafia, specifically the &quot;Farao&quot; and &quot;Marincola&quot; clans based in Calabria. Assets worth € 50 million (£44/$59m) were seized. The indictment mentions that owners of German restaurants, ice cream parlours, hotels and pizzerias were forced to buy wine, pizza dough, pastries and other products made in southern Italy. The Farao clan was being led by life-imprisoned Giuseppe Farao, before the arrests, and was passing orders onto his sons. They controlled bakeries, vineyards, olive groves, funeral homes, launderettes, plastic recycling plants and shipyards.

The waste disposal of the Ilva steel company based in Taranto was also infiltrated. Some of the charges were mafia association, attempted murder, money laundering, extortion and illegal weapons possession and trafficking. Italian prosecutor Nicola Gratteri said that the arrests were the most important step taken against the &#x27;Ndrangehta in the past 20 years. Eleven suspects were detained, and accused of blackmailing and money laundering. They were deported back to Italy. Alessandro Figliomeni, former mayor of Siderno, Calabria, was sentenced to 12 years in prison on 7 May 2018. He is alleged to be a member of the Commisso &#x27;ndrina clan and served in the top hierarchy.

In December 2019, more than 300 people were arrested in Calabria on suspicion of belonging to the &#x27;Ndrangheta in an operation involving 2,500 police. Among those arrested was Giancarlo Pittelli, a prominent lawyer and former member of Silvio Berlusconi&#x27;s Forza Italia party. The arrests were said by Nicola Gratteri, the chief prosecutor in Catanzaro, to be the second largest in number in the history of Italian organised crime, after those that led to the so-called &quot;Maxi Trial&quot; of Sicilian Mafia bosses in Palermo between 1986 and 1992. The trial against the more than 300 &#x27;Ndrangheta members began on 13 January 2021.

In early May 2023, a police crackdown on the &#x27;Ndrangheta network on suspicion of cocaine smuggling, money laundering and several other offences got 108 people arrested in Italy by Carabinieri and 30 people arrested in several states of Germany by over 1,000 police officers. The raids were prepared four years into highly secretive investigations and were a result of a coordinated probe by investigators in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal and Spain. Major investigations included getting a glimpse into inner workings of the organisation, including their crypto phones and services such as EncroChat and Sky ECC, which &#x27;Ndrangheta resorted to using amid movement restrictions imposed over the COVID-19 pandemic.

Also in 2023, it was alleged that links with the Gambino family allows the &#x27;Ndrangheta to use New York as a &#x27;gym&#x27; to train new recruits.

In November 2023, over 200 people connected to the &#x27;Ndrangheta were convicted in the largest mafia trial for three decades. Despite more than 100 individuals being acquitted following the three-year trial proceedings, it still represented a huge blow to the crime organisation&#x27;s activities in Europe. Almost all defendants had been arrested in 2019.

== Outside Italy ==
The &#x27;Ndrangheta has established branches abroad, mainly through migration. The overlap of blood and mafia family seems to have helped the &#x27;Ndrangheta expand beyond its traditional territory: &quot;The familial bond has not only worked as a shield to protect secrets and enhance security, but also helped to maintain identity in the territory of origin and reproduce it in territories where the family has migrated.&quot; &quot; &#x27;Ndrine&quot; are reported to be operating in northern Italy, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, France, the rest of Europe, the Americas, Australia, West Africa, and Asia. One group of &#x27;ndranghetisti discovered outside Italy was in Ontario, Canada, several decades ago. They were dubbed the Siderno Group by Canadian judges as most of its members hailed from and around Siderno.

Magistrates in Calabria warned a few years ago about the international scale of the &#x27;Ndrangheta&#x27;s operations. It is now believed to have surpassed the traditional axis between the Sicilian and American Cosa Nostra, to become the major importer of cocaine to Europe. Outside Italy &#x27;Ndrangheta operates in several countries, such as:

===Albania===
According to the German Federal Intelligence Service, the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND), in a leaked report to a Berlin newspaper, states that the &#x27;Ndrangheta &quot;act in close co-operation with Albanian mafia families in moving weapons and narcotics across Europe&#x27;s porous borders&quot;.

===Argentina===
In November 2006, a cocaine trafficking network that operated in Argentina, Spain and Italy was dismantled. The Argentinian police said the &#x27;Ndrangheta had roots in the country and shipped cocaine through Spain to Milan and Turin. In October 2022, an Italian &#x27;Ndrangheta mafia leader, Carmine Alfonso Maiorano, who was responsible for drug and arms trafficking operations between Latin America and Europe was captured in Guernica, Buenos Aires after years-long of manhunt.

===Australia===

Known by the name &quot;The Honoured Society,&quot; the &#x27;Ndrangheta controlled Italian-Australian organized crime all along the east coast of Australia since the early 20th century. &#x27;Ndrangheta operating in Australia include the Sergi, Barbaro and Papalia clans. Similarly in Victoria the major families are named as Italiano, Arena, Muratore, Benvenuto, and Condello. In the 1960s warfare among &#x27;Ndrangheta clans broke out over the control of the Victoria Market in Melbourne, where an estimated $45 million worth of fruits and vegetables passed through each year. After the death of Domenico Italiano, known as Il Papa, different clans tried to gain control over the produce market. At the time it was unclear that most involved were affiliated with the &#x27;Ndrangheta.

The &#x27;Ndrangheta began in Australia in Queensland, where they continued their form of rural organised crime, especially in the fruit and vegetable industry. After the 1998–2006 Melbourne gangland killings which included the murder of &#x27;Ndrangheta Godfather Frank Benvenuto. In 2008, the &#x27;Ndrangheta were tied to the importation of 15 million ecstasy pills to Melbourne, at the time the world&#x27;s largest ecstasy haul. The pills were hidden in a container-load of tomato cans from Calabria. Australian &#x27;Ndrangheta boss Pasquale Barbaro was arrested. Pasquale Barbaro&#x27;s father Francesco Barbaro was a boss throughout the 1970s and early 1980s until his retirement. Several of the Barbaro clan, including among others, Francesco, were suspected in orchestrating the murder of Australian businessman Donald Mackay in July 1977 for his anti-drugs campaign.

Italian authorities believe that former Western Australian mayor of the city of Stirling, Tony Vallelonga, is an associate of Giuseppe Commisso, boss of the Siderno clan of the &#x27;Ndrangheta. In 2009, Italian police overheard the two discussing &#x27;Ndrangheta activities. Since migrating from Italy to Australia in 1963, Vallelonga has &quot;established a long career in grass-roots politics.&quot;

The &#x27;Ndrangheta are also tied to large cocaine imports. Up to 500 kilograms of cocaine was documented relating to the mafia and Australian associates smuggled in slabs of marble, plastic tubes and canned tuna, coming from South America to Melbourne via Italy between 2002 and 2004. A report in 2016 by Vice Media indicated that the activities continued to be profitable: &quot;Between 2004 and 2014, the gang&#x27;s members amassed more than $10 million [$7.6 million USD] in real estate and race horses in Victoria alone pouring money into wholesalers, cafes, and restaurants&quot;.

A June 2015 report by BBC News discussed an investigation by Fairfax Media and 
Four Corners which alleged that &quot;the &#x27;Ndrangheta, runs a drugs and extortion business worth billions of euros&quot; in Australia and that &quot;politicians have been infiltrated by the Calabrian mafia&quot;.

In February 2020, two individuals, said to be &quot;multimillionaire fruit and vegetable kings&quot; were alleged to be &#x27;Ndrangheta &quot;capos&quot;, having a relationship with the &quot;secretive criminal organisation&quot;. The Sydney Morning Herald report specified that the two &quot;are not accused of any crime in either Italy or Australia&quot;. The alleged information was obtained during investigations of other individuals during Operation Eyphemos in Calabria, which &quot;led to the arrest ... of 65 men for alleged mafia activities including extortion and political corruption in Calabria&quot;.

===Belgium===
&#x27;Ndrangheta clans purchased almost &quot;an entire neighbourhood&quot; in Brussels with laundered money originating from drug trafficking. On 5 March 2004, 47 people were arrested, accused of drug trafficking and money laundering to purchase real estate in Brussels for some 28 million euros. The activities extended to the Netherlands where large quantities of heroin and cocaine had been purchased by the Pesce-Bellocco clan from Rosarno and the Strangio clan from San Luca.

===Brazil===

The &#x27;Ndrangheta has operated in Brazil since the 1970s, but an alliance between various &#x27;ndrine clans and the Primeiro Comando da Capital since the mid-2010s has increased the mafia&#x27;s presence in the country. A reliable stream of cocaine from Brazil is crucial to the &#x27;Ndrangheta&#x27;s grip on the European cocaine market, and the alliance has enabled a massive overseas expansion for the PCC through access to different markets across Africa, Europe and Asia.
A share of cocaine exported by the PCC and the &#x27;Ndrangheta moves through West Africa, and international and regional law enforcement investigations have implicated &#x27;Ndrangheta elements in cocaine trafficking in several countries across the region, including Senegal, Niger, Ghana and Côte d&#x27;Ivoire. &#x27;Ndrine clans operate in West Africa through the stable presence of individuals in certain countries, as well as through trusted brokers established through visits by &#x27;Ndrangheta clan family members.

In May 2021, a joint operation by the Federal Police of Brazil, Interpol and Italian police arrested Italian mobster Vincenzo Pasquino, in a flat in João Pessoa, along with Rocco Morabito, one of the most wanted Italian drug traffickers at the time. Pasquino held a leadership position in the Calabrian mafia, the &#x27;Ndrangheta.

Several important &#x27;Ndrangheta bosses have been arrested in Brazil, such as Domenico Pelle, Nicola Assisi and Rocco Morabito.
Assisi and Morabito (according to investigations by the Brazilian Federal Police) resided in Brazil, where they pretended to be legitimate businessmen and lived in luxury properties, while negotiating with important members of the PCC.

In 2022, a Federal Police investigation on the PCC&#x27;s usage of the Port of Rio de Janeiro for part of its cocaine exports to Europe revealed a criminal network that included Chendal Wilfrido Rosa, a member of the No Limit Soldiers who was acting as a representative for &#x27;Ndrangheta in Brazil.

In June 2023, the São Paulo Civil Police arrested Garip Uç, a Turkish chemist associated with Hezbollah during an operation in Praia Grande. Investigations later pointed to Moroccan hashish being imported to Brazil by a criminal network that involved the PCC, &#x27;Ndrangheta, the Balkan Mafia and Hezbollah, by way of Barakat clan entrepreneurs who operated in the Triple Frontier region.

In July 2024, Vincenzo Pasquino who was arrested in Brazil decided to tell the authorities in his country about the criminal factions PCC and CV&#x27;s secrets. He signed a kind of plea bargain with the Italian justice system.

===Canada===
According to a May 2018 news report, &quot;Siderno&#x27;s Old World &#x27;Ndrangheta boss sent acolytes to populate the New World&quot; including Michele (Mike) Racco who settled in Toronto in 1952, followed by other mob families. By 2010, investigators in Italy said that Toronto&#x27;s &#x27;Ndrangheta had climbed &quot;to the top of the criminal world&quot; with &quot;an unbreakable umbilical cord&quot; to Calabria.

The Canadian &#x27;Ndrangheta is believed to be involved in various activities including the smuggling of unlicensed tobacco products through ties with criminal elements in cross-border Native American tribes. According to Alberto Cisterna of the Italian National Anti-Mafia Directorate, the &#x27;Ndrangheta has a heavy presence in Canada. &quot;There is a massive number of their people in North America, especially in Toronto. And for two reasons. The first is linked to the banking system. Canada&#x27;s banking system is very secretive; it does not allow investigation. So Canada is the ideal place to launder money. The second reason is to smuggle drugs.&quot; The &#x27;Ndrangheta have found Canada a useful North American entry point. The organization used extortion, loan sharking, theft, electoral crimes, mortgage and bank fraud, crimes of violence and cocaine trafficking.

A Canadian branch labelled the Siderno Group has been active in Canada since the 1950s; it was formed originally by Michele (Mike) Racco, who was the head of the Group until his death in 1980. Siderno is also home to one of the &#x27;Ndrangheta&#x27;s biggest and most important clans, heavily involved in the global cocaine business and money laundering. Antonio Commisso, the alleged leader of the Siderno group, is reported to lead efforts to import &quot;... illicit arms, explosives and drugs ...&quot; Elements of &#x27;Ndrangheta have been reported to have been present in Hamilton, Ontario as early as 1911. Historical crime families in the Hamilton area include the Musitanos, Luppinos and Papalias.

According to an agreed Statement of Fact filed with the court, &quot;the Locali [local cells] outside of Calabria replicate the structure from Calabria, and are connected to their mother-Locali in Calabria. The authority to start Locali outside Calabria comes from the governing bodies of the organization in Calabria. The Locali outside of Calabria are part of the same &#x27;Ndrangheta organization as in Calabria, and maintain close relationships with the Locali where its members come from.&quot; The group&#x27;s activities in the Greater Toronto Area were controlled by a group known as the &#x27;Camera di Controllo&#x27; which &quot;makes all of the final decisions&quot;, according to the witness&#x27; testimony. It consists of six or seven Toronto-area men, who co-ordinate activities and resolves disputes among Calabrian gangsters in Southern Ontario. In 1962, Racco established a &quot;crimini&quot; or Camera di Controllo in Canada with the help of Giacomo Luppino and Rocco Zito. One of the members was Giuseppe Coluccio, before he was arrested and extradited to Italy. Other members are Vincenzo DeMaria, Carmine Verduci before his death, and Cosimo Stalteri before his death. In August 2015, the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) issued a deportation order for Carmelo Bruzzese. Bruzzese appealed the decision to Canada&#x27;s Federal Court, but it was rejected, and on 2 October 2015, Bruzzese was escorted onto a plane in Toronto, landing in Rome, where he was arrested by Italian police. Major Giuseppe De Felice, a commander with the Carabinieri, told the IRB that Bruzzese &quot;assumed the most important roles and decisions. He gave the orders.&quot;

After living in Richmond Hill, Ontario for five years until 2010, Antonio Coluccio was one of 29 people named in arrest warrants in Italy in September 2014. Police said they were part of the Commisso &#x27;ndrina (&#x27;Ndrangheta) crime family in Siderno. In July 2018, Coluccio was sentenced to 30 years in prison for corruption. His two brothers, including Salvatore and Giuseppe Coluccio, were already in prison due to Mafia-related convictions.

In June 2018, Cosimo Ernesto Commisso, of Woodbridge, Ontario, and an unrelated woman were shot and killed in his vehicle whilst outside his home. According to sources contacted by the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, &quot;Commisso was related to Cosimo &quot;The Quail&quot; Commisso of Siderno, Italy, who has had relations in Ontario, is considered by police to be a &quot;&#x27;Ndrangheta organized crime boss&quot;. The &quot;National Post&quot; reported that Cosimo Ernesto Commisso, while not a known criminal, &quot;shares a name and family ties with a man who has for decades been reputed to be a Mafia leader in the Toronto area&quot;. The cousin of &quot;The Quail&quot;, Antonio Commisso, was on the list of most wanted fugitives in Italy until his capture on 28 June 2005, in Woodbridge.

In June 2015, RCMP led police raids across the Greater Toronto Area, named Project OPhoenix, which resulted in the arrest of 19 men, allegedly affiliated with the &#x27;Ndrangheta. In March 2018, during the resultant criminal trial north of Toronto, the court heard from a Carabinieri lieutenant-colonel that &#x27;Ndrangheta is active in Germany, Australia and the Greater Toronto Area. &quot;People in Italy have to be responsible for their representatives here but the final word comes from Italy&quot;. A member of the Greater Toronto Area&#x27;s &#x27;Ndrangheta cell, Carmine Guido, who had been a police informant, testified at length in 2018 about the structure and activities of the organization which had been under the control of Italian-born Bradford, Ontario resident, Giuseppe (Pino) Ursino and Romanian-born Cosmin (Chris) Dracea of Toronto. The latter two faced two counts of cocaine trafficking for the benefit of a criminal organization and one charge of conspiracy to commit an indictable offence. Guido was paid $2.4 million by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police between 2013 and 2015 to secretly tape dozens of conversations with suspected &#x27;Ndrangheta members. In February 2019, Ursino was sentenced to years in prison on drug trafficking charges, with Dracea sentenced to nine years in prison on cocaine trafficking conspiracy. Neither had a previous criminal record. At the sentencing, the presiding judge made this comment: &quot;Based on the evidence at trial, Giuseppe Ursino is a high-ranking member of the &#x27;Ndrangheta who orchestrated criminal conduct and then stepped back to lessen his potential implication&quot; ... Cosmin Dracea knew he was dealing with members of a criminal organization when he conspired to import cocaine&quot;.

During the Ursino/Dracea trial, an Italian police expert testified that the &#x27;Ndrangheta operated in the Greater Toronto Area and in Thunder Bay particularly in drug trafficking, extortion, loan sharking, theft of public funds, robbery, fraud, electoral crimes and crimes of violence. After the trial, Tom Andreopoulos, deputy chief federal prosecutor, said that this was the first time in Canada that the &#x27;Ndrangheta was targeted as an organized crime group since 1997, when the Criminal Code was amended to include the offence of criminal organization. He offered this comment about the organization:&quot;We&#x27;re talking about structured organized crime. We&#x27;re talking about a political entity, almost; a culture of crime that colonizes across the sea from Italy to Canada. This is one of the most sophisticated criminal organizations in the world.&quot;

In June 2018, a Mafia expert wrote that &quot;A new alliance between Bonanno associates and the Violi family . . . is significant, as it suggests a growing prominence for Calabrian mafia – the &#x27;Ndrangheta – within the New York families and in Canada&quot;. Criminologist Anna Sergi of the University of Essex added that drug trafficking was the most active pursuit in North America.

On 18 July 2019, the York Regional Police announced the largest organized crime bust in Ontario, part of an 18-month long operation called Project Sindicato that was also coordinated with the Italian State Police. York Regional Police had arrested 15 people in Canada, 12 people in Calabria, and seized $35 million worth of homes, sports cars and cash in a major trans-Atlantic probe targeting the most prominent wing of the &#x27;Ndrangheta in Canada headed by Angelo Figliomeni. On 14 and 15 July, approximately 500 officers raided 48 homes and businesses across the GTA, seizing 27 homes worth $24 million, 23 cars, including five Ferraris, and $2 million in cash and jewelry. Nine of the 15 arrests in Canada included major crime figures: Angelo Figliomeni, Vito Sili, Nick Martino, Emilio Zannuti, Erica Quintal, Salvatore Oliveti, Giuseppe Ciurleo, Rafael Lepore and Francesco Vitucci. The charges laid included tax evasion, money laundering, defrauding the government and participating in a criminal organization.

During a press conference in Vaughan, Ontario, Fausto Lamparelli of the Italian State Police, offered this comment about the relationship between the &#x27;Ndrangheta in Ontario and Calabria:&quot;This investigation allowed us to learn something new. The &#x27;Ndrangheta crime families in Canada are able to operate autonomously, without asking permission or seeking direction from Italy. Traditionally, &#x27;Ndrangheta clans around the world are all subservient to the mother ship in Calabria. It suggests the power and influence the Canadian-based clans have built.&quot;

On 9 August 2019, as part of the same joint investigation, several former Greater Toronto Area residents were arrested in Calabria, including Giuseppe DeMaria, Francesco Commisso, Rocco Remo Commisso, Antonio Figliomeni and Cosimo Figiomeni. Vincenzo Muià had visited Toronto on 31 March 2019 to meet with Angelo and Cosimo Figliomeni, seeking answers to who had ambushed and killed his brother, Carmelo Muià, in Siderno on 18 January 2018; Muià&#x27;s smartphone was unwittingly and secretly transmitting his closed-door conversations to authorities in Italy.

In 2020, the charges laid against three individuals as a result of Project Sindicato were &quot;stayed&quot; (the prosecution discontinued), unless the prosecutors could find new evidence and proceeded with the charges again within one year. In January 2021, the charges against the remaining six were also stayed, including that of Angelo Figliomeni, &quot;the head of the &#x27;Ndrangheta in Toronto&quot; according to York Regional Police. The charges were stayed after an investigation &quot;into the use of the privileged conversations&quot; that found &quot;improper use of wiretapping&quot; and &quot;significant breaches of solicitor-client privilege&quot;. All property seized by police must now be returned – with the exception of illegal possessions.

===Colombia===
The &#x27;Ndrangheta clans were closely associated with the AUC paramilitary groups led by Salvatore Mancuso, a son of Italian immigrants; he surrendered to Álvaro Uribe&#x27;s government to avoid extradition to the U.S. According to Giuseppe Lumia of the Italian Parliamentary Antimafia Commission, &#x27;Ndrangheta clans are actively involved in the production of cocaine. The Mancuso &#x27;ndrina is a powerful &#x27;Ndrangheta family.

===Germany===
According to a study by the German foreign intelligence service, the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND), &#x27;Ndrangheta groups are using Germany to invest cash from drugs and weapons smuggling. Profits are invested in hotels, restaurants and houses, especially along the Baltic coast and in the eastern German states of Thuringia and Saxony. Investigators believe that the mafia&#x27;s bases in Germany are used primarily for clandestine financial transactions. In 1999, the state Office of Criminal Investigation in Stuttgart investigated an Italian from San Luca who had allegedly laundered millions through a local bank, the Sparkasse Ulm. The man claimed that he managed a profitable car dealership, and authorities were unable to prove that the business was not the source of his money. The Bundeskriminalamt (BKA) concluded in 2000 that &quot;the activities of this &#x27;Ndrangheta clan represent a multi-regional criminal phenomenon.&quot;

A war between the two &#x27;Ndrangheta clans Pelle-Romeo (Pelle-Vottari) and Strangio-Nirta from San Luca that had started in 1991 in their home town in Calabria and resulted in several deaths, spilled into Germany in 2007; six men were shot to death in front of an Italian restaurant in Duisburg on 15 August 2007. (See San Luca feud.)

In 2009, a confidential report by the BKA said some 229 &#x27;Ndrangheta families were living in Germany, and were involved in gun-running, money laundering, drug-dealing, and racketeering, as well as legal businesses. Some 900 people were involved in criminal activity, and were also legal owners of hundreds of restaurants, as well as being major players in the property market in the former East. The most represented &#x27;Ndrangheta family originated from the city of San Luca (Italy), with some 200 members in Germany. According to the head of the German federal police service, Jörg Ziercke, &quot;Half of the criminal groups identified in Germany belong to the &#x27;Ndrangheta. It has been the biggest criminal group since the 1980s. Compared to other groups operating in Germany, the Italians have the strongest organization.&quot;

===Netherlands===
 allegedly lived for 10 years in the Netherlands, where he managed his contacts with Colombian cocaine cartels. He was arrested in Amsterdam on 27 October 2005. The seaports of Rotterdam and Amsterdam are used to import cocaine. The Giorgi, Nirta and Strangio clans from San Luca have a base in the Netherlands and Brussels (Belgium). In March 2012, the head of the Dutch National Crime Squad (&quot;Dienst Nationale Recherche&quot;, DNR) stated that the DNR will team up with the Tax and Customs Administration and the Fiscal Information and Investigation Service to combat the &#x27;Ndrangheta.

===Malta===
David Gonzi, a son of former Prime Minister of Malta Lawrence Gonzi, was accused of illegal activities by acting as a trustee shareholder in a gaming company. The company in question was operated by a Calabrian associate of the &#x27;Ndrangheta in Malta. His name appeared several times on an investigation document of over 750 pages that was commissioned by the tribunal of the Reggio Calabria. Gonzi called the document unprofessional. A European arrest warrant was published for Gonzi to appear at the tribunal but this never materialised. Gonzi, however, was completely exonerated from the list of potential suspects in the &#x27;Ndrangheta gaming bust.

After investigation of the presence of the &#x27;Ndrangheta, 21 gaming outlets had their operation license temporarily suspended in Malta due to irregularities in a period of one year.

In a Notice of the Conclusion of the Investigation dated 30 June 2016, criminal action was commenced in Italy against 113 persons originally mentioned in the investigation.

=== Mexico ===
According to some reports, the &#x27;Ndrangheta works in conjunction with Mexican drug cartels in the drug trade, such as with the mercenary army known as Los Zetas.

===Slovakia===

In February 2018, Slovak investigative journalist Ján Kuciak was shot dead at his home together with his fiancée. At the time of his murder, Kuciak was working on a report about Slovak connections with the &#x27;Ndrangheta. He had previously reported on organized tax fraud involving businesspeople close to the ruling Smer-SD party. On 28 February, Aktuality.sk published Kuciak&#x27;s last, unfinished story. The article details the activities of Italian businessmen with ties to organised crime who have settled in eastern Slovakia, and have spent years embezzling European Union funds intended for the development of this relatively poor region, as well as their connections to high-ranking state officials, such as Viliam Jasaň, a deputy and the Secretary of the State Security Council of Slovakia, and Mária Trošková, a former nude model who became Chief Adviser of Prime Minister Robert Fico. Both Jasaň and Trošková took leave of absence on the same day, stating that they would return to their positions once the investigations were concluded.

===Switzerland===
The crime syndicate has a significant presence in Switzerland since the early 1970s but has operated there with little scrutiny due to the inconspicuous life styles of their members, the Swiss legal landscape, and solid foundations in local businesses. In the aftermath of the San Luca feud in 2007 and subsequent arrests in Italy (Operation &quot;Crimine&quot;), it became clear that the group had also infiltrated the economically proliferous regions of Switzerland and Southern Germany. In March 2016, Swiss law enforcement in cooperation with Italian state prosecutors arrested a total of 15 individuals, 13 in the city of Frauenfeld, 2 in the canton of Valais, accusing them of active membership to an organized crime syndicate also known as &quot;Operazione Helvetica&quot;.

Since 2015, the Swiss federal police has conducted undercover surveillance and recorded the group&#x27;s meetings in a restaurant establishment in a small village just outside of Frauenfeld. The meetings were taking place in a relatively remote location using the now defunct entity the &quot;Wängi Boccia Club&quot; as its cover. According to the Italian prosecutor Antonio De Bernardo, there are several cells operating within the jurisdiction of the Swiss Federation, estimating the number of operatives per cell to about 40, and a couple of 100 in total. All of the arrested persons are Italian citizens, the two men arrested in the Valais have already been extradited to Italy, and as of August 2016, one individual arrested in Frauenfeld has been approved for extradition to Italy.

===United Kingdom===
In London, the Aracri and Fazzari clans are thought to be active in money laundering, catering and drug trafficking.

===United States===
The earliest evidence of &#x27;Ndrangheta activity in the U.S. points to an intimidation scheme run by the syndicate in Pennsylvania mining towns; this scheme was unearthed in 1906. Current &#x27;Ndrangheta activities in the United States mainly involve drug trafficking, arms smuggling, and money laundering. It is known that the &#x27;Ndrangheta branches in North America have been associating with Italian-American organized crime. The Suraci family from Reggio Calabria has moved some of its operations to the U.S. The family was founded by Giuseppe Suraci, who has been in the United States since 1962. His younger cousin, Antonio Rogliano runs the family in Calabria.

In February 2014, both FBI and Italian Police joint operation named &quot;New Bridge&quot;, intercepted the transatlantic network of U.S. and Italian crime families. The raid targeted the Gambino and Bonanno families in the U.S. while in Italy, it targeted the Ursino &quot; &#x27;ndrina&quot; from Gioiosa Jonica. The defendants were charged with drug trafficking, money laundering and firearms offenses, based, in part, on their participation in a transnational heroin and cocaine trafficking conspiracy involving the &#x27;Ndrangheta. The operation began in 2012 when investigators detected a plan by members of the Ursino clan of the &#x27;Ndrangheta to smuggle large amounts of drugs. An undercover agent was dispatched to Italy and was successful in infiltrating the clan. An undercover agent was also involved in the handover of 1.3 kg of heroin in New York as part of the infiltration operation.

In June 2018, a Mafia expert wrote that &quot;A new alliance between Bonanno associates and the Violi family . . . is significant, as it suggests a growing prominence for Calabrian mafia – the &#x27;Ndrangheta – within the New York families and in Canada&quot;. Criminologist Anna Sergi of the University of Essex added that drug trafficking was the most active pursuit in North America.

===Uruguay===
On 24 June 2019, &#x27;Ndrangheta leader Rocco Morabito, dubbed the &quot;cocaine king of Milan&quot;, escaped from Central Prison in Montevideo, together with three other inmates, &quot;through a hole in the roof of the building&quot;. Morabito was awaiting extradition to Italy for international drug trafficking, having been arrested at a Montevideo hotel in 2017 after living in Punta del Este under a false name for 13 years.

== In popular culture ==
Beginning in 2000, music producer released three CD compilations of Italian mafia folk songs over a five-year period. Collectively known as &quot;&quot;, these compilations consist mainly of songs written by &#x27;Ndrangheta musicians, often sung in Calabrian and dealing with themes such as vengeance (&quot;Sangu chiama sangu&quot;), betrayal (&quot;I cunfirenti&quot;), justice within the &#x27;Ndrangheta (&quot;Nun c&#x27;è pirdunu&quot;), and the ordeal of prison life (&quot;Canto di carcerato&quot;). The 2013 book &quot;ZeroZeroZero&quot; by Roberto Saviano investigates the activities of the &#x27;Ndrangheta in Italy. Stefano Sollima adapted the book into a 2020 TV series of the same name. 

In 2023, the Italian-language TV series &quot;The Good Mothers&quot; depicting &#x27;Ndrangheta premiered. It was based on the novel of the same name by British author Alex Perry, and appeared in the 73rd Berlin International Film Festival.

<text>The Camorra (; ) is an Italian Mafia-type criminal organization and criminal society originating in the region of Campania. It is one of the oldest and largest criminal organizations in Italy, dating to the 18th century. The Camorra&#x27;s organizational structure is divided into individual groups called &quot;clans&quot;. Every &quot;capo&quot; or &quot;boss&quot; is the head of a clan, in which there may be tens or hundreds of affiliates, depending on the clan&#x27;s power and structure. The Camorra&#x27;s main businesses are drug trafficking, racketeering, counterfeiting, and money laundering. It is also not unusual for Camorra clans to infiltrate the politics of their respective areas.

Since the early 1980s and its involvement in the drug trafficking business, the Camorra has acquired a strong presence in other European countries, particularly Spain. Usually, Camorra clans maintain close contact with South American drug cartels, which facilitates the arrival of drugs in Europe.

According to Naples public prosecutor Giovanni Melillo, during a 2023 speech of the Antimafia Commission, the most powerful groups of the Camorra in the present day are the Mazzarella clan and the Secondigliano Alliance. The latter is an alliance of the Licciardi, Contini and Mallardo clans.

==History==

The origins of the Camorra are unclear. It may date to the 17th century as a direct Italian descendant of a Spanish secret society, the Garduña, founded in 1417. Recent historical research suggests that the Garduña did not exist and its legendary status was based on a 19th-century fictional book. According to historian John Dickie the Garduña was a fictional organisation that appeared from nowhere in a very popular French pulp novel published in 1845. The author probably based the story on Miguel de Cervantes’ short story &quot;Rinconete and Cortadillo&quot;. An Italian translation in 1847 spread the myth in Italy.

More likely, the Camorra developed in the 18th century. Officials of the Kingdom of Naples may have introduced the organisation to the area, or it may have developed gradually from small criminal gangs operating in Neapolitan society near the end of the 18th century. The first official use of &quot;camorra&quot; as a word dates from 1735, when a royal decree authorised the establishment of eight gambling houses in Naples. The word is likely a blend, or portmanteau, of &quot;capo&quot; (boss) and a Neapolitan street game, the &quot;&quot;morra&quot;.&quot; After gambling was prohibited by the local government, some people started making the players pay for protection against the attentions of passing police.

The Camorra emerged during the chaotic power vacuum between 1799 and 1815, when the Parthenopean Republic was proclaimed on the wave of the French Revolution and the Bourbon Restoration. The first official mention of the Camorra as an organisation dates from 1820, when police records detail a disciplinary meeting of the Camorra, a tribunal known as the &quot;Gran Mamma&quot;. That year the first written statute of the Camorra, the &quot;frieno&quot;, was discovered, indicating a stable organisational structure in the underworld. Another statute was discovered in 1842, related to initiation rites and funds set aside for the families of those imprisoned. The organisation was also known as the &quot;Bella Società Riformata&quot;, &quot;Società dell&#x27;Umirtà&quot; or &quot;Onorata Società&quot;.

The evolution into more organised formations indicated a qualitative change: the Camorra and &quot;camorristi&quot; were no longer local gangs living off theft and extortion; they had a fixed structure and some kind of hierarchy. Another qualitative leap was the agreement between the liberal opposition and the Camorra, following the defeat of the 1848 revolution. The liberals realised that they needed popular support to overthrow the king. They turned to the Camorra and paid them because the &quot;camorristi&quot; were the leaders of the city&#x27;s poor. The new police chief, Liborio Romano, appealed to the head of the Camorra, Salvatore De Crescenzo, to maintain order and appointed him as head of the municipal guard. In a few decades, the Camorra had developed into power brokers. In 1869, Ciccio Cappuccio was elected as the &quot;capintesta&quot; (head-in-chief) of the Camorra by the twelve district heads (&quot;capintriti&quot;), succeeding De Crescenzo after a short interregnum. Nicknamed &quot;The king of Naples&quot; (&quot;o rre &#x27;e Napole&quot;), he died in 1892.

Following Italian unification in 1861, the government made attempts to suppress the Camorra. From 1882, it conducted a series of manhunts. The Saredo Inquiry (1900–1901), established to investigate corruption and bad governance in Naples, identified a system of political patronage run by what the report called the &quot;high Camorra&quot;:
The inquiry introduced the terminology of &quot;high Camorra&quot;, as having a bourgeois character, and distinct from the plebeian Camorra proper. The two groups were in close contact through the figure of the intermediary (&quot;faccendiere&quot;).

Scholars dispute whether the &quot;high Camorra&quot; was an integral part of the Camorra proper. Although the inquiry did not prove specific collusion between the Camorra and politics, it did reveal the patronage mechanisms that contributed to corruption in the municipality. The society&#x27;s influence was weakened, which was exemplified by the defeat of all of their candidates in the 1901 Naples election. In the early 20th century, given the poverty of Naples and the region, many camorristi emigrated to the United States.
The Camorra received another blow with the Cuocolo Trial (1911–1912). The trial was ostensibly to prosecute those charged with the murder on 6 June 1906 of the Camorra boss Gennaro Cuocolo and his wife, who were suspected of being police spies. The main investigator, Carabinieri Captain Carlo Fabbroni, transformed the trial into one against the Camorra as a whole, intending to use it to strike the final blow to the Camorra.

The trial attracted much attention among newspapers and the general public, both in Italy and the United States, including by Pathé&#x27;s Gazette. The hearings began in 1911. After 17 months, the often tumultuous proceedings ended with a guilty verdict on 8 July 1912 against defendants who included 27 leading Camorra bosses. They were sentenced to a total of 354 years&#x27; imprisonment. Enrico Alfano, the main defendant and nominal head of the Camorra, was sentenced to 30 years.

The Camorra has never been a unified, centralised organisation, but instead a loose confederation of different, independent clans, groups or families. Each group is bound by kinship ties and controlled economic activities that took place in its particular geographic territory. Each clan takes care of its own business, protects its territory, and sometimes tries to expand at another group&#x27;s expense. There is some minimal coordination to avoid mutual interference. The families compete to maintain a system of checks and balances among equal powers.

One of the Camorra&#x27;s strategies to gain social prestige was and remains political patronage. The family clans became the preferred go-betweens of local politicians and public officials because of their grip on the community. In turn, the family bosses used their political sway to assist and protect their clients against the local authorities. Through a mixture of brute force, political status, and social leadership, the Camorra clans gained ground as middlemen between the local community and bureaucrats and politicians at national level. They granted privileges and protection, and intervened in favour of their clients, in return for their silence and connivance against local authorities and the police. With their political connections, the heads of the major Neapolitan families became power brokers in local and national political contexts, providing Neapolitan politicians with broad electoral support, and in return receiving benefits for their constituency.

==Activities==
Compared to the Sicilian Mafia&#x27;s pyramidal structure, the Camorra has more of a &#x27;horizontal&#x27; structure. As a result, Camorra clans act independently of one another and are more prone to feuding. This, however, makes the Camorra more resilient when top leaders are arrested or killed, as new clans and organisations emerge from the remnants of old ones. Clan leader Pasquale Galasso stated in court, &quot;Campania can get worse because you could cut into a Camorra group, but another ten could emerge from it.&quot;

In the 1970s and 1980s, Raffaele Cutolo made an unsuccessful attempt to unify the Camorra families in the manner of the Sicilian Mafia, by forming the New Organized Camorra (&quot;Nuova Camorra Organizzata&quot; or &quot;NCO&quot;). Drive-by shootings by &quot;camorristi&quot; often result in casualties among the local population but such episodes are often difficult to investigate because of the widespread practise of omertà (code of silence). According to a report published in 2007 by Confesercenti, the second-largest Italian trade organisation, the Camorra control the milk and fish industries, the coffee trade, and over 2,500 bakeries in Naples.

In 1983, Italian law enforcement estimated that there were about a dozen Camorra clans. By 1987, the estimate had risen to 26, and in the following year to 32. Roberto Saviano, an investigative journalist and author of &quot;Gomorra&quot;, an exposé of the activities of the Camorra, says that this sprawling network of clans now dwarfs the Sicilian Mafia, the &#x27;Ndrangheta and southern Italy&#x27;s other organised gangs, in numbers, in economic power and in ruthless violence.

In 2004 and 2005, the Di Lauro clan and the so-called Scissionisti di Secondigliano fought a bloody feud which came to be known in the Italian press as the Scampia feud. The result was over 100 street killings. At the end of October 2006 a new series of murders took place in Naples between 20 competing clans, costing 12 lives in 10 days. The Interior Minister, Giuliano Amato, decided to send more than 1,000 extra police and carabinieri to Naples to fight crime and protect tourists. Despite this, in the following year there were over 120 murders.

In 2001, the businessman Domenico Noviello from Caserta testified against a Camorra extortionist and subsequently received police protection. In 2008 he refused further protection and was killed one week later.

In recent years, various Camorra clans have been allegedly using alliances with Nigerian drug gangs and the Albanian mafia. Augusto La Torre, the former La Torre clan boss who became a pentito, is married to an Albanian woman; the first foreign pentito, a Tunisian, admitted to being involved with the feared Casalesi clan of Casal di Principe. The first town in which the Camorra sanctioned stewardship by a foreign clan was Castel Volturno, which was given to the Rapaces, clans from Lagos and Benin City in Nigeria. This allowed them to traffic cocaine and women in sexual slavery before sending them across Europe.

==Waste crisis==

Since the 1980s, the Camorra has taken over the handling of waste disposal in the region of Campania. By December 1999, all regional landfills had reached capacity. Reports in 2008 stated that the crisis was caused at least in part by the Camorra, which created a lucrative business in the municipal waste disposal business, mostly in the triangle of death. With the complicity of industrial companies, heavy metals, industrial waste, and chemicals and household waste are frequently mixed together, then dumped near roads and burned to avoid detection, leading to severe soil and air pollution.

According to Giacomo D&#x27;Alisa et al., &quot;the situation worsened during this period as the Camorra diversified their illegal waste disposal strategy: 1) transporting and dumping hazardous waste in the countryside by truck; 2) dumping waste in illegal caves or holes; 3) mixing toxic waste with textiles to avoid explosions and then burning it; and 4) mixing toxic with urban waste for disposal in landfills and incinerators.&quot;

A Camorra member, Nunzio Perella was arrested in 1992, and began collaborating with authorities; he had stated &quot;the rubbish is gold.&quot; The boss of the Casalesi clan, Gaetano Vassallo, admitted to systematically working for 20 years to bribe local politicians and officials to gain their acquiescence to dumping toxic waste.

The triangle of death and the waste management crisis is primarily a result of government failure to control illegal waste dumping. The government had attempted to mandate recycling and waste management programs, but were unable, causing the expansion of opportunities for illegal activities, which caused further barriers to solve the waste crisis.

In November 2013, a demonstration by tens of thousands of people was held in Naples in protest against the pollution caused by the Camorra&#x27;s control of refuse disposal. Over a twenty-year period, it was alleged, about ten million tonnes of industrial waste had been illegally dumped, with cancers caused by pollution increasing by 40–47%.

==Efforts to fight the Camorra==
The Camorra has proven to be an extremely difficult organisation to fight within Italy. During the 1911–12 trial, Fabroni gave testimony on how complicated it was to successfully prosecute the Camorra: &quot;The Camorrist has no political ideals. He exploits the elections and the elected for gain. The leaders distribute bands throughout the town, and they have recoursed to violence to obtain the vote of the electors for the candidates whom they have determined to support. Those who refuse to vote as instructed are beaten, slashed with knives, or kidnapped. All this is done with assurance of impunity, as the Camorrists will have the protection of successful politicians, who realize that they cannot be chosen to office without paying toll to the Camorra.&quot;

Unlike the Sicilian Mafia, which has a clear hierarchy and a division of interests, the Camorra&#x27;s activities are much less centralised. This makes the organisation much more difficult to combat through crude repression. In Campania, where unemployment is high and opportunities are limited, the Camorra has become an integral part of the fabric of society. It offers a sense of community and provides the youth with jobs. Members are guided in the pursuit of criminal activities, including cigarette smuggling, drug trafficking, and theft.

The government has made an effort to combat the Camorra&#x27;s criminal activities in Campania. The solution ultimately lies in Italy&#x27;s ability to offer values, education and work opportunities to the next generation. However, the government has been hard pressed to find funds for promoting long-term reforms that are needed to improve the local economic outlook and create jobs. Instead, it has had to rely on limited law enforcement activity in an environment that has a long history of tolerance and acceptance of criminality and is governed by the omertà.

Despite the overwhelming magnitude of the problem, law enforcement officials continue their pursuit. The Italian police are coordinating their efforts with Europol and Interpol to conduct special operations against the Camorra. The Carabinieri and the Financial Police (&quot;Guardia di Finanza&quot;) are also fighting criminal activities related to tax evasion, border controls, and money laundering. Prefect Gennaro Monaco, Deputy Chief of Police and Chief of the Section of Criminal Police cites &quot;impressive results&quot; against the Camorra in recent years, yet the Camorra continues to grow in power.

In 1998, police took a leading Camorra figure into custody. Francesco Schiavone was caught hiding in a secret apartment near Naples behind a sliding wall of granite. The mayor of Naples, Antonio Bassolino, compared the arrest to that of Sicilian Mafia chief Salvatore Riina in 1993. Schiavone is now serving a life sentence after a criminal career which included arms trafficking, bomb attacks, armed robbery, and murder.

Michele Zagaria, a senior member of the Casalesi clan, was arrested in 2011 after eluding police for 16 years. He was found in a secret bunker in the town Casapesenna, near Naples. In 2014, clan boss Mario Riccio was arrested for drug trafficking in the Naples area. Around the same time 29 suspected Camorra members were also arrested in Rome.

The arrests in the Campania region demonstrate that the police are not allowing the Camorra to operate without intervention. However, progress remains slow, and these minor victories have done little to loosen the Camorra&#x27;s grip on Naples and the surrounding regions.

In 2008, Italian police arrested three members of the Camorra crime syndicate on 30 September 2008. According to Gianfrancesco Siazzu, commander of the Carabinieri police, the three were captured in small villas on the coast of Naples. All three had been on Italy&#x27;s 100 top most wanted list. Police seized assets valued at over 100 million euros and also weapons, including two AK-47 assault rifles that may have been used in the shooting of six Africans on 18 September 2008. Police found pistols, Carabinieri uniforms and other outfits that were used to disguise members of the operation. During the same week, a separate operation netted 26 additional suspects in Caserta. All were believed to belong to the powerful Camorra crime syndicate that operates in and around Naples. The suspects were charged with extortion and weapons possession. In some cases, the charges also included murder and robbery. Giuseppina Nappa, the 48-year-old wife of a jailed crime boss, was among those arrested. She is believed to be the Camorra&#x27;s local paymaster.

The Italian state confiscated €30 million including real estate in Luxembourg belonging to Angelo Grillo, a businessman from Marcianise, considered very close to the Belforte clan. Grillo also owned the company Lynch Invest SA based in the country. In the name of this company, he purchased real estate in Campania and Sardinia.

In November 2018, Italian police announced the arrest of Antonio Orlando, suspected of being a major figure in the Camorra.

In February 2019, Ciro Rinaldi, boss of the Rinaldi clan, was arrested in a house in the region of San Pietro a Patierno, he is accused of the double murder of Raffaele Cepparulo, member of a small gang linked to the Mazzarella clan, and Ciro Colonna, an innocent victim. Rinaldi is also considered responsible for the murder of Vincenzo De Bernardo, also linked to the Mazzarellas. At the time of his arrest, his clan was considered one of the most powerful clans of the Camorra, having all the eastern area of the city of Naples under its control and having as allies the Secondigliano Alliance. On 18 September 2019, Ciro Rinaldi was sentenced to life imprisonment, considered to be the mastermind behind the murders of Cepparulo and Colonna. According to the reports, Rinaldi reportedly ordered Cepparulo&#x27;s death believing Cepparulo was planning to kill him to give &quot;pleasure&quot; to the Mazzarella clan, historical enemies of the Rinaldi clan.

In March 2019, Marco Di Lauro, the second most wanted man in Italy, was arrested after spending 14 years on the run. He is the fourth son of ex-Camorra boss Paolo Di Lauro. In 2010, an informant said that he was responsible for at least four murders.

In June 2019, the Italian police arrested more than 120 members of the Secondigliano Alliance, the alliance created by the Licciardi, Contini and Mallardo clans, in an &quot;anti-Camorra&quot; operation. The police also confiscated €130 million. Among those who were arrested were the wives of the bosses of the Bosti, Mallardo, Licciardi and Contini clans, but also their lieutenants, children, grandchildren and entrepreneurs who worked for the alliance. The historical female boss Maria Licciardi managed to escape from the arrest in the operation, and is now considered a fugitive. Seven members of the organization were arrested in Spain, Netherlands, South America and in the Balkans, places where they were running illicit business on behalf of the Alliance.

On 12 July 2019, the Italian police confiscated €300 million, including 600 houses, lands, 16 cars and bank accounts belonging to Antonio Passarelli, a businessman believed to be connected to the Di Lauro clan, Puca clan, Aversano clan, Mallardo clan, Verde clan, Perfetto clan and to the Scissionisti di Secondigliano.

On 10 August 2019, an operation of the police arrested six important members of the Rinaldi clan, particularly members of the Reale faction. They are accused of drug trafficking, extortion and illegal possession of weapons. The organization, once considered one of the most prominent, suffered hard blows in 2019, with the arrests of most of its leaders and important figures.

On 21 August 2019, Giuseppe Chirico, included in the list of the most dangerous fugitives in Italy, was arrested in the Ciampino airport, where he landed after a brief holiday abroad. Chirico is considered a prominent member of the Scarpa, linked to the powerful Gallo-Cavalieri clan from Torre Annunziata, dedicated in particular to international drug trafficking. He was wanted since January 2018 and was using a fake identity at the time of his arrest.

On 24 September 2019, the Italian police arrested Salvatore Ferro, step brother of Gaetano Beneduce, head of the historical Beneduce-Longobardi clan, based in Pozzuoli. Ferro, according to investigations, led the Ferro faction of the clan since the death of his brother Rosario Ferro, known as &#x27;Capatosta, in 1998. Now he will serve two years and five months in prison.

In September 2019, Pasquale Puca, known as ‘o minorenne, head of the Puca clan and nephew of Giuseppe Puca, was sentenced to life in prison. Puca is held responsible for the murder of Francesco Verde, known as ‘o negus, then leader of the Verde clan, happened in 2007. Between the end of the 1980s and the 1990s, the Verde clan fought with the Puca and Ranucci clans, a clash to which numerous murders were attributed.

In October 2019, the Direzione Investigativa Antimafia seized €1.5 million belonging to Annalisa De Martino, the former partner of the boss Giuseppe Gallo. The Gallo clan has control over illegal activities such as extortion, drug trafficking and money laundering in the areas of Boscotrecase, Boscoreale and Torre Annunziata. De Martino was considered to be in charge of the financial management of the organization.

On 23 October 2019, the Italian police dismantled the Montescuro clan, arresting 23 important members of the organisation. The clan was headed by the elderly boss Carmine Montescuro, nicknamed &quot; &#x27;Zì Menuzzo&#x27; &quot;, a leader of remarkable criminal charisma, who for at least 20 years played the role of mediator in the wars between various clans. According to the investigations, due to his mediation skills, he was able to put the , the Mazzarellas and the Continis at the same table when the war between their organisations was at its peak in the early 2000s. Montescuro also had a good relationship with Marco Mariano, boss of the Mariano clan in the 1990s.

According to Silvain Coué, a French liaison officer, who participated of the operation:
The drug trafficking in the country is said to contribute to the financing of the various jihadist groups in the Sahel, Africa.

===Morocco===

Giuseppe Polverino, the leader of the Polverino clan before his arrest, was considered the &#x27;hashish king&#x27;, due to his monopoly on the importation of hashish from Morocco to Italy via Spain supplying not only all the Camorra clans, but also the &#x27;Ndrangheta, the Sicilian Mafia and the Sacra Corona Unita. The Polverino clan had a monopoly of the hashish trade since 1992. According to one of the pentitos of the clan, Domenico Verde, the hashish was cultivated in the region of Ketama, and arrived by mules in the beginning, but later was modernized and accessible on trucks and cars.

According to the DEA, Zazo would manage more than U$500 million per year in shipments of cocaine through the ports of the country to Europe.

A 2021 report made by Raúl Del Castillo, general of the National Police of Peru, stressed that Europe is today the main destination of Peruvian cocaine, specifying also that Camorra clans are among the international criminal organizations that have their emissaries &quot;working&quot; in Peru.

The notorious &quot;super cartel&quot; headed by Raffaele Imperiale, one of the major drug traffickers of the Camorra, had a virtual monopoly of the Peruvian cocaine trade, in which the drugs were distributed throughout Europe.

===Romania===

Camorra clans in Romania deal in money laundering. In 2017, Gaetano Manzo, the accountant of the Sacco-Bocchetti clan, was arrested in his villa in Fizeșu Gherlii.

And was reportedly taking charge of the vast business the Casalesi clan, particularly the Zagaria&#x27;s faction, held in Romania.

===Spain===

According to the journalist Roberto Saviano, Spain (after Italy) is the country most entwined with the Camorra. It is where the Camorra clans established its massive businesses revolving around drug trafficking and money laundering in real estate.

Camorra has been in Spain since the 1980s. The most powerful clan acting in the country is the Polverino clan due to the number of people they have installed and because of the potential of their structure. They have influence in the cities of Alicante, Tarragona, Málaga and Cádiz.

According to the Italian antimafia police, in recent times, the Camorra clans based in Spain have accumulated €700 million as a result of drug trafficking and money laundering in the country.

The presence of the organization in the Costa del Sol is so strong that Camorra bosses refer to it as &quot;Costa Nostra&quot;&#x27; (&quot;Our Coast&quot;), according to Italian journalist Roberto Saviano, a specialist on the Naples criminal underworld.

Another clan with influence in Spain is the Scissionisti di Secondigliano led by Raffaele Amato nicknamed Lo Spagnolo (the Spaniard), because before creating his own clan, he controlled the drug trafficking operation from Galicia to Naples for the Di Lauro clan. Amato was arrested as he left a casino in Barcelona in 2005.

The drug trafficker Pasquale Brunese was arrested in Valencia in 2015, after seven years hiding from the Italian police. He was a member of the De Luca Bossa clan, for whom he worked in the drug trade. In Spain, Brunese owned a restaurant and was living with a false name.

Alfredo Barasso, linked to the bloodthirsty Casalesi boss Giuseppe Setola, was arrested in Valencia and extradited to Italy. Barasso was a &quot;bridge&quot; between Italy and Spain, working for the Casalesi clan in the drugs management in the Barcelona area. After his decision to become a pentito, and afraid of retaliation by the Camorra, Barasso would be willing to return to Spain, where he has wife and children, and pay his penalty there, as provided by the bilateral agreements between the two countries.

According to a 2019 documentary of the Spanish television, Barcelona is the nerve center of the organization outside Italy, exposing the endless business of the Camorra in Catalonia, from the massive drug trafficking to the laundering of huge amounts of money in restaurants, clubs and hotels of the region. The documentary also features an interview with Maurizio Prestieri, former member of the Di Lauro clan arrested in Marbella in 2003 and now pentito, who said that Spain is the favorite place for the &quot;camorristi.&quot;

Also in 2019, relatives of top members belonging to the Polverino clan claim three million euros to the Spanish State of compensation after their relatives were acquitted by the National Court of the crime of money laundering for which they were arrested in 2013 and tried in 2016. Among the assets seized were six yachts, two Ferrari Testarossa, one Lamborghini, one Harley-Davidson, bank accounts and real estate. The plaintiffs are all relatives of the late Giuseppe Felaco, who was allegedly an important member of the Polverino clan based in the Canary Islands, they assure that this Spanish police operation against their family has been a great economic damage, apart from a moral damage.

On 20 November 2019, the Italian police with the cooperation of the Spanish police, arrested two members of the Polverino clan, who belonged to a major transnational organizational structure, created by the Polverinos, based in Valencia and Naples, that between 2001 and 2012 imported hashish from Morocco via Spain to arrive in the Campania region.

===Switzerland===

The Camorra has had a presence in Switzerland for more than 50 years, undertaking money laundering but also arms trafficking and drug trafficking. The Casalesi clan is present throughout the country, and according to the investigations into the clan, it has numerous Swiss bank accounts.

In 1992, Ciro Mazzarella, the late boss of the Mazzarella clan, decided to move to Switzerland, after losing a war between Camorra clans in Naples. From his logistics base in Lugano, he created an enviable economic empire with cigarette smuggling that arrived from Montenegro.

In 2017, assets worth €20 million belonging to the Potenza brothers, who are considered to be linked to the Lo Russo clan, were seized in Lugano, including bank accounts in BSI.

===United Kingdom===
According to 2020 reports about the Camorra, the United Kingdom is an area of interest to launder money, using finance companies and business activities. The Casalesi clan, through an entrepreneur and alleged financial intermediary, had invested 12 million euros using various companies based in Great Britain.

Antonio Righi, called &quot;Tonino il biondo&quot;, was considered by the investigators as a money laudererer on behalf of the Contini and Mazzarella clans in London. Although the two organizations are historically rivals, in England they were represented by the same man. Among the British companies that figured in his scheme, was one registered at a luxurious terraced house not far from Oxford Street in London&#x27;s West End. The trial built against Righi clearly showed that he understood exactly how modern global finance works. The Italian police confiscated 250 million euros belonging to Righi.

Between the mid-1980s and early 2000s, Scotland has had its brush with the Camorra, when Antonio La Torre of Aberdeen was the local &quot;Boss&quot;. He is the brother of Camorra boss Augusto La Torre of the La Torre clan which had its base in Mondragone, Caserta. The La Torre Clan&#x27;s empire was worth hundreds of millions of euros. Antonio had several legitimate businesses in Aberdeen, whereas his brother Augusto had several illegal businesses there. Augusto would eventually become a pentito in January 2003. Antonio was convicted in Scotland and extradited to Italy in 2006 to serve a 13-year sentence; he was released in 2014. With the fall of the La Torre clan in the 2000s, Scotland experienced the disappearance of Camorra in the country, in fact the La Torre clan was overthrown in all the countries it had a massive presence, such as in Italy and in the Netherlands.

===United States===
The Camorra operated in the United States, primarily in New York City, between the mid-19th century and early 20th century. They rivaled the now defunct Morello crime family for power in New York City. Eventually, they melded with early Italian-American Mafia groups.

In the 1980s, many Camorra members and associates fled the internecine gang warfare and Italian justice, which was directed at suppressing the groups, and immigrated to the United States. According to the FBI, it is believed that nearly 200 Camorra affiliates operate in the country. Although they did not appear to recreate their clan structure in the United States, Camorra members have established a presence in Los Angeles, New York City, and Springfield, Massachusetts. The US law enforcement considers the Camorra to be a rising criminal enterprise, especially dangerous because of its ability to adapt to new trends and forge new alliances with other criminal organizations.

In 2012, the Obama administration imposed sanctions on the Camorra as one of four key transnational organized crime groups, along with the Brothers&#x27; Circle from Russia, the Yamaguchi-gumi (Japan&#x27;s largest yakuza organization), and Los Zetas from Mexico.

==Alliances with other criminal groups==

===Camorra-&#x27;Ndrangheta===

According to the media, there have always been alliances between the Camorra and the &#x27;Ndrangheta members. On 26 August 1976, Domenico Tripodo, a powerful &#x27;Ndrangheta boss of the time, was stabbed to death in prison on the request of the De Stefano &#x27;ndrina, and with the help of Camorra boss Raffaele Cutolo, the boss of the Nuova Camorra Organizzata (NCO) who worked with the De Stefano&#x27;s in drug trafficking.

The Tamanaco operation that ended on 22 June 2010, destroyed a drug trafficking operation managed by the La Torre clan from Mondragone and the Barbaro &#x27;ndrina from Platì. The operation consisted in transporting the drugs from Venezuela and Colombia, through several European ports including the port of Amsterdam. At the port of Livorno, 700 kilos of cocaine were seized.

On 11 May 2016, a criminal alliance between the Sinti criminal organization Casamonica clan, members of the Camorra, and affiliates from the &#x27;Ndrangheta&#x27;s of Polistena, Taurianova and Melicucco was dismantled by the police. €25 million were seized.

On 21 March 2018, 19 arrests were made in Rome of alleged members belonging to the Licciardi clan of the Camorra and members of the Filippone &#x27;ndrina and Gallico &#x27;ndrina accused of drug trafficking.

In 2019, investigations of the Italian police reveals links between the Contini clan and the Crupi brothers, members of the powerful Commisso &#x27;ndrina. Both organizations are reportedly cooperating in the drug trafficking business.

===Camorra-Cosa Nostra===

Several Camorra clans have lasting relationships with the Cosa Nostra. Prominent elements of the Mafia such as Salvatore Riina, Leoluca Bagarella, Luciano Leggio and Bernardo Provenzano found themselves in contact with Camorra clans such as the Nuvoletta clan, members of the Camorra such as Michele Zaza and Antonio Bardellino, and with other groups that formed the Nuova Famiglia confederation in the 1980s.

In the past, the Russo clan had links with the Mafia, particularly in the 1980s and 1990s, at the time of the Corleonesi Mafia era.

In 2019, the Direzione Investigativa Antimafia of Catania dismantled a scheme between the Camorra&#x27;s Mallardo clan and Casalesi clan and members of the powerful Catania&#x27;s mafia family, led by Vincenzo Enrico Augusto Ercolano, son of Giuseppe Ercolano (deceased, but once an important member of the Catania&#x27;s mafia) and Grazia Santapaola, the sister of the historical boss Benedetto Santapaola. The DIA also confiscated €10 million in the operation.

According to the pentito Domenico Verde, the Polverino clan has a good relationship with the Cosa Nostra families from Palermo, in particular thanks to the drug trafficking business.

===Camorra-Sacra Corona Unita===

In 1981, Raffaele Cutolo, entrusted Pino Iannelli and Alessandro Fusco the task of founding an organization in Apulia to be directly controlled by the Nuova Camorra Organizzata, the organization was named Nuova Camorra Pugliese, later called Sacra Corona Unita. This organization operated in various cities of Apulia during the 1980s. But with the downfall of Cutolo, the organisation was no longer a subgroup of the Camorra and was under the leadership of Giuseppe Rogoli.

According to the pentito Antonio Accurso, the Di Lauro clan has several links to the Sacra Corona Unita in question with regards to drug trafficking.

===Camorra-Società foggiana===

In September 2019, the Italian police dismantled an international drug trafficking alliance between the powerful Gionta clan of the Camorra, the Società foggiana, also known as the fifth-mafia, and Moroccan drug traffickers. The investigation started in 2016 against a Maghreb gang based in the region of Trentino-Alto Adige. The vast network of drug traffickers, extended from Morocco, passing through Spain, Switzerland and the Netherlands to finally arrive in Trentino and in Bolzano. Arriving in Italy, the drugs were sold in parks, historic centers and near schools by mainly Tunisian and Moroccan pushers. Nineteen people were arrested, four are still wanted in Italy, Spain and in the Netherlands and seventy-three are under investigation. The operation seized over 1 ton of hashish and 2 kg of cocaine.

===Camorra-South American drug cartels===

The links between the South American drug cartels and Camorra clans dates back to at least the 1980s, having stabilized numerous privileged drug channels from South America to Europe over the years.

According to investigations, the Camorra member Tommaso Iacomino allegedly negotiated with the head of Peruvian and Colombian drug cartels over the cocaine trade.

Giuseppe Gallo called &quot; &#x27;o pazz&quot; (the crazy one), boss of the Limelli-Vangone clan, is said to having contacts with Colombian drug traffickers able to reach agreements for the purchase of large quantities of cocaine, supplying various clans in the Naples area.

In 2016, Salvatore Iavarone, a broker in South America representing the Tamarisco clan from Torre Annunziata, was arrested in Ecuador. Iavarone is believed to be the main link for the shipment of narcotics from Ecuador to Europe. Other 28 members were arrested during this operation. The police also confiscated €11 million that belonged to Iavarone in Ecuador.

On 4 July 2019, the &quot;Guardia di Finanza&quot; seized 538 kg of cocaine, worth €200 million, destined for the Camorra in the port of Genoa. According to the reports, the drug was found in 19 bags inside a container that arrived from Colombia. On each of the loaves was a fake €500 note, a symbol known to be that of a new Colombian cartel born of the merger of several other cartels. The container was headed to Naples but was intercepted at the port of Genoa.

On 18 December 2019, the Italian police arrested 12 people, including members of an international drug cartel dedicated to the drug trafficking between Colombia and Italy. According to the investigations, the cocaine brought from Colombia was pure and of high quality, and when it arrived in Italy, it was sold at a &quot;retail&quot; price of 200 euros per gram, all the scheme was managed by Camorra members. Among those arrested in the operation was Salvatore Nurcaro, a well known member of the Rinaldi clan.

===Camorra-Albanian mafia===

According to the Direzione Investigativa Antimafia, the Albanian mafia has alliances with the Mazzarella clan and with the Scissionisti di Secondigliano, both from Naples and with the Serino clan, from Salerno.

Saviano spoke of the Albanian mafia as a &quot;no longer foreign mafia&quot; to Italy and stressed that the Albanians and Italians have a &quot;brotherly&quot; relationship with each other. Saviano notes that the Camorra feels great affinity with the Albanian crime families because both organizations are based on family ties.

===Camorra-Chinese Triads===

According to the expert on terrorist organizations and mafia-type organized crime Antonio De Bonis, there is a close relationship between the Triads and the Camorra, and the port of Naples is the most important landing point of the trades managed by the Chinese groups in cooperation with the Camorra. Among the illegal activities in which the two criminal organizations work together are the human trafficking and illegal immigration aimed at the sexual and labour exploitation of the Chinese compatriots into Italy, the synthetics drug trafficking and the laundering of illicit money through the purchase of real estate.

In 2017, investigators discovered a scheme between the Camorra and the Chinese gangs. They exported industrial waste from Italy to China that guaranteed million-dollar revenues for both organizations. The industrial waste left Prato in Italy and arrived in Hong Kong. Among the Camorra clans involved in this alliance were the Casalesi clan, the Fabbrocino clan and the Ascione clan.

===Camorra-Nigerian gangs===

In the beginning, Nigerian immigrants to Italy were not tolerated by the Camorra, but in the 2010s Nigerians and the Camorra began making alliances. Cooperation between the Camorra and Nigerian mafia is mainly in the areas of drug trafficking and prostitution. In particular, Camorra members have allowed the Nigerian gangs to organize the trafficking of women in their territory in exchange for a share on the earnings. The Nigerian mafia produces synthetic drugs independently and sells them with the consent of the Camorra. This alliance, however, may not be stable in the future, as the Nigerians have asked to be treated on par with other Italian mafias, for the fact that they are growing both as a military and as an economic force.

=== Camorra-Islamic State ===
According to numerous articles, the Camorra may be in alliance with the Islamic State. The allegations reached the media after the Italian police seized 14 tonnes of amphetamines produced in Syria by the Islamic State, on July 1, 2020. It is considered the world&#x27;s largest seizure of amphetamines, with a value of over €1 billion. Camorra clans reportedly bring the drugs to Italy and take a huge cut for helping to distribute them. According to the investigations, the production of these drugs provides the terrorist group (ISIS) with vital revenue for its militant activities.

===Other alliances===

In 1995, the Camorra cooperated with the Russian Mafia in a scheme in which the Camorra would bleach out US$1 bills and reprint them as $100s. These bills would then be transported to the Russian Mafia for distribution in 29 post-Eastern Bloc countries and former Soviet republics. In return, the Russian Mafia paid the Camorra with property (including a Russian bank) and firearms, smuggled into Eastern Europe and Italy.

In the 2000s, the Ukrainian mafia cooperated with Camorra clans in the cigarette smuggling business. The Ukrainians would smuggle the cigarettes from Ukraine and Eastern Europe into Italy, where with the help of the Camorra it supplies the Neapolitan market. In recent years, the Contini clan is said to have cooperated in the same scheme with the Ukrainians.

In March 2019, a massive international arms trafficking ring was dismantled by the authorities of Italy and Austria and coordinated by Eurojust.
According to the investigations, the alliance between the Camorra and the Austrians lasted for seven years, until the police dismantled the scheme.
The Austrians are known to have sold more than 800 new pistols to the Camorra as well as 50 Kalashnikovs and 10 &#x27;Scorpion&#x27; sub-machine guns, worth a total of €500,000.
According to Gerhard Jarosch, the National Member for Austria at Eurojust:
The weapons are believed to have come originally from Eastern Europe taken to Carinthia in Austria with the objective to arrive in Terzigno near Naples. On 15 October 2019, father, 73, and son, 47, were convicted in the Court of Klagenfurt to serve 24 and 20 months respectively in jail.

DEA documents sent to the Dutch police exposed what would be a super drug cartel headed by Raffaele Imperiale (Camorra&#x27;s drugs and arms dealer), Ridouan Taghi (former Dutch most wanted criminal, now in jail), Daniel Kinahan (Irish drug trafficker) and Edin G. (Bosnian drug trafficker). The group was observed by the DEA having meetings in the Burj Al Arab hotel in Dubai, which is the base of the alleged cartel. The meetings took place in 2017; however, it only reached the Dutch media in October 2019. The DEA regards this as one of the world&#x27;s fifty largest drug cartels, with a virtually monopoly of the Peruvian cocaine and controlled around a third of the cocaine trade in Europe. Yet, according to the DEA documents, the destination for all the drugs shipments were Dutch ports.

In 2005, it was alleged the Camorra created safe houses, forged documents, firearms, and explosives to Al-Qaeda in return for narcotics, which are brought into Italy via the Adriatic Sea.

==Current status==

With most of the old Camorra clans decapitated, and their bosses either dead or arrested, the organization is experiencing a rise in youth criminal gangs trying to take their places. This phenomenon is called &quot;Paranza&quot;, Camorra terminology for a criminal group led by youngsters or &quot;small fish&quot;. Whilst the older bosses often operated out of the limelight, these young criminals broadcast their exploits on social media, posing in designer clothes and with €200 bottles of champagne.

In 2015, 19 year-old Emanuele Sibillo, considered one of the first young and leading bosses of this new generation, was shot dead by a rival baby gang. Most of these young criminals are children of Camorra members that are currently in jail.

According to Felia Allum, author of book &quot;The Invisible Camorra: Neapolitan Crime Families across Europe&quot;:
However, according to Peppe Misso, called &quot;’o nasone&quot;, former boss of the Misso clan for over 40 years and now pentito, this young generation of criminals are managed by the &quot;real&quot; Camorra clans, shifting the public attention to these baby gangs while they do their business in silence. According to Misso, the real power of the organization is now in the hands of the Licciardi clan, Mallardo clan, Moccia clan and Contini clan.

On 2 September 2018, Ciro Mazzarella, one of the last historical godfathers of the Camorra, and head of the Mazzarella clan, died in his villa in the affluent neighbourhood of Posillipo, Naples, at the age of 78.

According to reports, in 2019, after the arrest of Marco Di Lauro, leader of the Di Lauro clan and fourth son of Paolo Di Lauro, the Contini clan became the most powerful clan of the Camorra, thanks to no internal split, and not having affiliates that became collaborators of justice. The clan is present in the drugs trafficking, extortion, betting and counterfeiting, also investing hundreds of millions of euros in various countries of Europe.

On 23 April 2019, the powerful boss Mario Fabbrocino, leader of the Fabbrocino clan, died in the hospital of the Parma prison, where he was serving a life sentence for ordering the murder of Roberto Cutolo, Raffaele Cutolo&#x27;s only son, in 1990. He was known as the &quot;boss dei due mondi&quot; (boss of two worlds) due to his drug trafficking connections in South America.

Since 26 June 2019, Maria Licciardi was considered the most wanted fugitive belonging to the Camorra, after she managed to escape the huge police operation against her clan. However, on 12 July 2019, the Court of Naples annulled the preventive detention against Licciardi, sharing the legal questions raised by her lawyer, Dario Vannetiello. She was arrested again at Rome&#x27;s Ciampino airport by Carabinieri on the orders of Naples prosecutors, alleged to have been running extortion rackets as head of the Licciardi Camorra clan, on 7 August 2021 when attempting to travel to Spain.
On 11 July 2019, Anna Terracciano, known as &quot;‘a Masculona&quot;, boss of the Terracciano clan, died after suffering from an unknown illness. Terraciano had taken control of the clan after the death of her brother Salvatore, known as &quot;‘o Nirone&quot;, in 2016. She has always been very feared and respected for her impetuous nature. According to the media, she is the figure that has well represented the image of the women inside the Camorra, the female symbol of leadership when men are detained or dead.

According to the reports of the DIA about the Camorra, the Mazzarella clan, despite the bloody war against the Rinaldi clan, is still one of the most powerful organizations in Campania, dominating the territory in various neighbourhoods, and having numerous groups under their influence, as the Ferraiuolo clan.

After a time inactive, the De Luca Bossa clan is believed to be gaining power again in the eastern area of Naples, specifically in Ponticelli, thanks to the merger with emergent groups as the Minichini and Schisa. The clan was founded by Antonio De Luca Bossa, known as &quot;‘O sicco&quot;, in the 1990s, and was famous for the bloody war against the once powerful Sarno clan. In 1998, &quot;‘O sicco&quot; made the first attack with a car bomb in the Camorra&#x27;s history, killing Luigi Amitrano, the nephew of the boss Vincenzo Sarno, the real target of the ambush. Antonio&#x27;s father was a member of the Nuova Camorra Organizzata, and died from natural causes in 2008 after 18 years in jail.

On 11 September 2019, Antonino Di Lorenzo, known as &quot;o&#x27; lignammone&quot;, was killed in an ambush near his house in Casola di Napoli. Di Lorenzo was a notorious drug trafficker, dubbed by the media &#x27;the king of drug trafficking in the Monti Lattari region&#x27;. According to the Direzione Investigativa Antimafia, he was specialized in the industrial production of marijuana, flooding the illegal drug market, supplying market squares from Castellammare di Stabia to Sorrento and in recent years was at the center of numerous investigations about drug trafficking. His murder is believed to be connected with the feud for control of vast marijuana plantations in the mountainous area of Monti Lattari. Yet, according to the investigations, the killing happened thanks to the &#x27;permission&#x27; of the clans from Castellammare di Stabia, who have always supervised the immensely lucrative marijuana trade from the region.

On 30 October 2019, the release of two affiliates belonging to the Beneduce-Longobardi clan made the media headlines after they were received with a huge party in the neighborhood of Monterusciello, Pozzuoli. Giovanni Illiano, 48, and Silvio De Luca, 41, were released after 8 years and 10 years in prison, respectively. More than a hundred of relatives and friends were waiting for them for a party with champagne, flashing nightclub lights, a large fireworks display and a concert of Anthony, a well known neomelodic singer of the area. The fact, documented with photos and videos sent through social networks, caused outrage in the population, and is being investigated by the Italian Police, as it was not authorized by the Municipality of Pozzuoli or by the police.

On 21 November 2019, Feliciano Mallardo, brother of Giuseppe and Francesco Mallardo, was found dead inside his car. According to the investigations, he would have suffered a heart attack. Feliciano, who had taken the reins of the Mallardo clan after his brothers ended up in jail, was known as ‘&quot;o Sfregiato.&quot;

According to numerous 2019 reports, the most powerful clans of the Camorra are the Secondigliano Alliance and the Mazzarella clan. Both clans remain with full dominance of their territories while most of city experiences the growth of small and violent gangs headed by young guys between 17 and 25 years old.

In May 2020, Patrizio Bosti, one of the most powerful Camorra bosses who is still alive and one of the leaders of the Secondigliano Alliance, was released from prison. Bosti also claimed inhumane treatment while in prison, and will be compensated by the Italian state. The Camorra boss, that was serving a prison sentence since his arrest in Spain in 2008, should have been released from prison in 2023, however he was charged for three years and the halfway between early release and the time calculated as credit for the &quot;inhuman treatment&quot;. On May 16, 2020, Bosti was rearrested. The new prison order concerns a recalculation of the sentence by the Emilia-Romagna judiciary, as he was serving his sentence in the region, on the basis of documents provided by the Naples Public Prosecutor. According to the authorities, Bosti has to serve another six years in jail.

In June 2022, the notorious Camorra boss Cosimo Di Lauro died in prison. Di Lauro was considered an icon of the Camorra, a ruthless criminal who has become a role model for young people for his look and the storytelling about him.

<text>(; ; acronym: SCU), also known as the Fourth Mafia, is a Mafia-type criminal organization from the Apulia region in Southern Italy, and it is especially active in the areas of Brindisi, Lecce, and Taranto.

==Origin of the name==
Informer Cosimo Capodieci said the SCU used &quot;the &quot;Corona&quot; because it resembles a crown, meaning the rosary typically used in Church in order to carry out the functions of Jesus Christ and the cross... &quot;Unita&quot; because it was necessary to be connected to one another, similar to the rings of a chain.&quot; &quot;Sacra&quot; (Sacred) because at the time of the affiliation the new member is &quot;baptized&quot;.

==History==
Sacra Corona Unita was formed in the late 1970s and early 1980s and was formally established in a prison in 1983, according to a document found by investigators in the cell of the organisation&#x27;s founder, . The Sacra Corona Unita was created to counter the overwhelming power in the prisons and on the Apulian territory of some of the more established mafia organisations, such as the Campania families united in Raffaele Cutolo&#x27;s Nuova Camorra Organizzata.

According to one account of Rogoli&#x27;s rise to leadership, the foundations of Sacra Corona Unita were laid by Rogoli on Christmas night 1981. At the time, Rogoli was a 32-year-old tiler from Mesagnese who was serving a sentence in Trani prison for a bank robbery and murder in Giovinazzo in 1980. In prison, Rogoli had come into contact with exponents of the &#x27;ndrangheta. and had affiliated himself with Umberto Bellocco, capobastone and founder of the Bellocco &#x27;ndrina. Together with of Manduria and Mario Papalia, linked to Cosa Nostra, Rogoli set up the Sacra Corona Unita, whose structure and rituals closely resembled that of the &#x27;ndrangheta, and was officially sanctioned as the supreme head of the newly formed organisation. However, the &quot;Statuto della S.C.U.&quot; (charter of the Sacra Corona Unita) seized from Rogoli by the Italian law enforcement agencies in 1984 states that the organisation was established on 1 May 1983. 

Under Rogoli&#x27;s leadership, the Sacra Corona Unita mixed Apulian interests and opportunities with &#x27;Ndrangheta and Camorra traditions. While it is often referred to as the &quot;fourth mafia&quot;, it remained only a loose association of some ten to fifteen criminal groups in southern Apulia, whose cohesion, stability and economic and political power were always far inferior to those of the &#x27;Ndrangheta and the Mafia. After the defection of some of its leaders and the arrest of most of its members in the early 2000s, Sacra Corona Unita no longer exists as a single, viable organisation.

==Activities==

Originally preying on the region&#x27;s substantial wine and olive oil industries, the group moved into cigarette smuggling, arms trafficking, drug trafficking, human trafficking, money laundering, extortion, and political corruption.

According to a survey conducted by the &quot;Eurispes&quot; the main sources of income of the organization are:

* Drug trafficking — €878 million per year
* Prostitution — €775 million per year 
* Arms trafficking — €516 million per year
* Extortion and usury — €351 million per year

==Structure ==

The SCU is made up of three distinct groupings or levels. Members can &#x27;graduate&#x27; from one level to the next by going through &quot;riti battesimali&quot; (baptismal rites). The religious symbolism is probably left over from the SCU&#x27;s association with the Camorra.

* Società Minore – The lowest level, made up of lower-level criminals who do street-level activities. Members start out as &quot;picciotti&quot; and go through a 40-day trial to ensure they are suitable for criminal work and are not associated with the police. They are then inducted into the next phase of the level, the &quot;manovalanza&quot;, or worker. The candidate must also swear an oath of devotion to SCU.
*Società Maggiore – The second level, made up of two positions.
*Lo Sgarro – The position is given only to members who have killed at least three people for SCU, and from now on members cannot leave, on pain of death. Members can now form their own crew of picciotti, known as a &quot;filiale&quot;. Upon indoctrination into the &quot;La Santa&quot; position the member is given a firearm (to symbolically use on oneself upon failing SCU), a cyanide pill, cotton (representing Mont Blanc, which is considered sacred), a lemon (treating the wounds of one&#x27;s comrades), a needle to puncture the index finger of the right hand, handkerchiefs (representing purity of spirit) and a &quot;spartenza&quot; (a gift of some sort, usually cigarettes).
*Società Segreta– The top level, the core of the organization where key decisions are made.

The Sacra Corona Unita consists of about 50 clans with approximately 2,000 members and specializes in smuggling cigarettes, drugs, arms, and people. The Sacra Corona Unita collects payoffs from other criminal groups for landing rights on the southeast coast of Italy.

The SCU uses a hierarchical structure when running its organization, and the higher you climb the more responsibility and money you gain. Men are the predominant rulers of the group. In recent years, the SCU has been finding ways to exploit people online by scamming and hacking individuals for money. This money is then laundered into countries across Europe, such as the U.K., Spain, and Germany.

==Presence outside Apulia==

The Sacra Corona Unita has the Apulian region as their main territory, however, they are known to have a presence in other parts of Italy, especially in Modena, Mantua, and Reggio Emilia. Outside Italy, the organization has a presence in Albania, Spain, Germany, United States and the United Kingdom.

*The organization has long been present in Albania, partly because of the proximity of Apulia and Albania and the diffusion of the Italian language. Albania is a point of arrival for huge quantities of smuggled cigarettes and drugs from Afghanistan.
*Spain is considered a logistical base for the trafficking operations of the organization. SCU fugitives have been stopped in seaside resorts south of Barcelona.
*While the organization does not have consolidated structures in Germany, it is known that the &quot;Rogoli-Buccarella-Donatiello clan&quot;, the &quot;Padovano&quot; clan, the &quot;Tornese clan&quot; and the &quot;Mesagnesi clan&quot; have a presence in the country. The &quot;Coca-family&quot; investigation documented large cocaine trafficking from Germany to the province of Brindisi.
*The US FBI say: &quot;Very few members of the Sacra Corona Unita have been identified in the United States, although some individuals in Illinois, Florida and New York would have ties with the organization.&quot;
*In the United Kingdom the Sacra Corona Unita is believed to invest dirty money in hotels and in the tourism sector.
With the decreasing importance of the Adriatic corridor as a smuggling channel as the situation in the Balkans normalises, and a series of successful police and judicial operations against it in recent years, the Sacra Corona Unita has been reduced to a fraction of its former power, which peaked around the mid-1990s.

==Alliances of Sacra Corona Unita==

===&#x27;Ndrangheta===

Giuseppe Rogoli, one of the founders of the SCU, was an affiliate of the &#x27;Ndrangheta in Apulia, even before the creation of the Sacra Corona Unita.
The SCU, after Cutolo&#x27;s downfall, can be considered an offshoot of the &#x27;Ndrangheta in the region, due to Rogoli asked for the permission of the Capobastone Umberto Bellocco to create an &quot;Apulian &#x27;Ndrangheta&quot;, which becomes the today&#x27;s Sacra Corona Unita.

On 13 November 2017, the operation Lampo ended, lasting three years and started from the Sant&#x27;Anna operation, which arrested 10 alleged affiliates of the SCU and its alleged head Cataldo Caporosso operating in Massafra, Statte, Palagiano and in the Tamburi district of Taranto. The coterie had entered the fish and local cocaine market. The criminal activities of the criminal association would always have been endorsed by the &#x27;Ndrangheta boss Umberto Bellocco who, after 21 years in prison, would have met the Sacra Corona Unita member Cataldo Caporosso and conferred on him the dowry of &quot;padrino&quot;.

On 14 November 2018, the operation Galassia of the Guardia di Finanza ended, in which the presumed member of the Pesce-Bellocco &#x27;ndrina, Antonio Zungri, some members of the Tegano &#x27;ndrina and perhaps of the Piromalli &#x27;ndrina together with the Camorra and Sacra Corona Unita&#x27;s Capriati and Parisi clans were illegally included in the commercial network of the online betting companies &quot;Planetwin365&quot;, &quot;Betaland&quot;, &quot;Enjoybet&quot; and &quot;Planetwin&quot;. The Apulian clans set up its own foreign bookmaker with interests and projections in Brazil, Colombia, Nigeria, Romania, Vietnam, Panama, Paraguay, Argentina and Russia. In this operation were seized assets worth over €1 billion, while over 80 searches have been carried out throughout Italy.

===Camorra===

Although the first structured criminal organization in Apulia was created by the Nuova Camorra Organizzata, preceding the SCU, the Apulian underworld frowned upon their region being dominated by an outside organization. Taking advantage of the downfall of Raffaele Cutolo, the local criminals distanced themselves of the Camorra and get more aligned to the &#x27;Ndrangheta.

However, according to the pentito Antonio Accurso, the Camorra&#x27;s Di Lauro clan has several links to the Sacra Corona Unita in question with regards to drug trafficking.

===Balkan organizations===
The Apulian mafias have long been rooted in Albania, a neighbouring country where the Italian language is widespread. The Albanian mafia collaborates with the SCU to make Albania a sorting centre for large amounts of smuggled cigarettes, and drugs from Afghanistan, much of which enter Italy through the coasts of Montenegro, Croatia and Albania. On 27 July 1999 police in Durrës (Albania), with Italian assistance, arrested one of the godfathers of the Sacra Corona Unita. This Albanian link seems to confirm that the Sacra Corona Unita and the Albanian mafia are &quot;partners&quot; in Apulia and delegate several criminal activities.

==Rivals==
The internal difficulties of the SCU aided the birth of antagonistic criminal groups such as:
*&quot;Remo Lecce Libera&quot;: formed by some leading criminal figures from Lecce, who claim to be independent from any criminal group other than the &#x27;Ndrangheta. The term Remo indicates Remo Morello, a criminal from the Salento area, killed by criminals from the Campania region because he opposed any external interference;
*&quot;Nuova Famiglia Salentina&quot;: formed in 1986 by De Matteis Pantaleo, from Lecce and stemming from the Famiglia Salentina Libera born in the early 1980s as an autonomous criminal movement in the Salento area with no links with extra-regional Mafia expressions, the organization fought a feud against SCU&#x27;s clans in Lecce;
*&quot;Rosa dei Venti&quot;: formed in 1990 by De Tommasi in the Lecce prison, following an internal division in the SCU.

==Internal divisions==

===Società Foggiana===

The murder of Giuseppe Laviano, lieutenant of the Sacra Corona Unita in Foggia (whose body was never found), in January 1989, marked a turning point in the mafia war and the rise of Rocco Moretti, known as &quot;il porco&quot; (the pig), in the context of the Foggia organized crime at the expense of Laviano himself. After the murder, Moretti became the head of the new criminal organization &quot;Società foggiana&quot; in Foggia. Following the arrests made by the police in the &quot;Mantide&quot; operation, among the many details, macabre revelations also emerged, such as the photo of Laviano&#x27;s severed head, shown to the main members of the &quot;Società Foggiana&quot; during the summits.

The relations between the Foggia delinquency and the Camorra are probably the oldest and deepest ones. The Foggia delinquency has managed to make the qualitative leap thanks to the Camorra, particularly the Nuova Camorra Organizzata; during the NCO period many &quot;Cutoliani&quot; spent periods of imprisonment in the prisons of San Severo and Foggia, making contacts with and recruiting local criminals. Raffaele Cutolo&#x27;s sister Rosetta Cutolo spent time in San Severo. Cutolo even organized a sort of offshoot of the NCO in northern Apulia, the &quot;Nuova Camorra Pugliese&quot;; the killing of Don Peppe Sciorio, Lieutenant of Cutolo for Foggia, was another clear sign that the Foggia criminals wanted to become independent.

The &quot;Società Foggiana&quot; is considered the most brutal and bloody of all the Italian mafias.

The most powerful clans inside the Società Foggiana are the &quot;Trisciuoglio clan&quot;, the &quot;Sinesi-Francavilla clan&quot; and the &quot;Moretti-Pellegrino-Lanza clan&quot;.

In September 2019, the Italian police dismantled an international drug trafficking alliance between the powerful Gionta clan of the Camorra, the Società Foggiana, and Moroccan drug traffickers. The investigation started in 2016 against a Maghreb gang based in the region of Trentino-Alto Adige. The vast network of drug traffickers, extended from Morocco, passing through Spain, Switzerland and the Netherlands to finally arrive in Trentino and in Bolzano. Arriving in Italy, the drugs were sold in parks, historic centers and near schools by mainly Tunisian and Moroccan pushers. Nineteen people were arrested, with four still being wanted in Italy, Spain and in the Netherlands at the time, and seventy-three under investigation. Over one ton of hashish and 2 kg of cocaine were seized.

In January 2020 two bomb attempts were made in Foggia to murder a key witness in a major trial against mobsters; nobody was injured. The anti-mafia task force was reinforced after the attacks, and 20,000 people marched through Foggia in a protest organised by the anti-mafia group Libera.

<text>Navy Pier is a pier on the shoreline of Lake Michigan, located in the Streeterville neighborhood of the Near North Side community area in Chicago, Illinois, United States. Navy Pier encompasses over of shops, restaurants, live theaters, family attractions, parks (including Polk Bros Park), gardens, and exhibition facilities, and it is one of the top destinations in the Midwestern United States, drawing over nine million visitors annually. It is one of the most visited attractions in the entire Midwest and is Chicago&#x27;s second-most visited tourist attraction.

==History==
=== Military usage ===

Navy Pier opened to the public on July 15, 1916. Originally known as the &quot;Municipal Pier&quot;, the pier was built by Charles Sumner Frost, a nationally known architect, with a design based on the 1909 Plan of Chicago by Daniel Burnham and Edward H. Bennett. Its original purpose was to serve as a dock for freighters, passenger ships, and indoor and outdoor recreation; events like expositions and pageants were held there.

In mid-1918, the pier was also used as a jail for draft dodgers. In 1927, the pier was renamed Navy Pier to honor the naval veterans who served in World War I.

In 1941, during World War II, the pier became a training center for the United States Navy; about 10,000 people worked, trained and lived there. The pier contained a 2,500-seat theater, gym, 12-chair barber shop, tailor, cobbler shops, soda fountain and a vast kitchen and hospital.

Beginning in 1946, as the Navy was winding down from its mission, the University of Illinois held classes at the pier, especially to serve the high demand from returning service members. As the maximum capacity was exceeded, the school outgrew the pier, the University of Illinois at Chicago was partly founded as a result. After the university left, Navy Pier became underutilized.

=== Later use ===
In 1959, the St. Lawrence Seaway opened and increased commercial shipping activity at the pier for a short time, though business died down and left for more modern facilities at Lake Calumet. In 1976, the East End buildings were renovated and for a brief period the pier was alive again, home to summer events like ChicagoFest. But maintenance was not done and the pier went into decline.

In 1989, the City of Chicago had the Urban Land Institute (ULI) reimagine uses for the pier. The Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority (MPEA) was created; its responsibility was to manage and operate Navy Pier as well as McCormick Place. The MPEA undertook the redevelopment, incorporating some of ULI&#x27;s recommendations. In 1995, Navy Pier was redesigned and introduced to the public as a mixed-use venue incorporating retail, dining, entertainment and cultural spaces.

===Redevelopment===
Efforts to update Navy Pier for the 21st century began on January 13, 2006, when the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority released a proposal for a major renovation of the pier, which including a monorail, a spokeless Ferris wheel, a roller coaster, floating hotel, and a water park with a Great Lakes theme. The plan would have included nearly double the current parking and a replacement theater with a greater capacity. At the time of the announcement, a price tag of $2 billion was announced.

Following the reorganization of the agency that runs Navy Pier and McCormick Place, a new study was commissioned to reinvigorate the upgrade process. The new study, by the Urban Land Institute, was released on November 11, 2010, and recommended a more modest set of enhancements aimed at retaining the pier&#x27;s role as a public space, rather than turning it into a theme park. Suggested elements include a concert venue, an enlarged Chicago Shakespeare Theater space, new restaurants, a renovated commercial area around the pier&#x27;s entrance and additional park-like features to bring people closer to the lake. Possibilities, including the enlarged Ferris wheel and a hotel, are mentioned as more remote possibilities.
In March 2012, a competition led to selection of a design concept presented by a team led by James Corner of James Corner Field Operations that focuses on the pier&#x27;s role as a waterfront promenade. In 2013, the Authority announced plans to carry out the first elements of a streamlined version of that concept, with reworked streetscape and a wider pedestrian space, moving tour-boat moorings to improve the view from a new central stairway centered on the Ferris wheel. Work began on the redevelopment plan, called &quot;The Centennial Vision,&quot; during the winter of 2013–2014. The purpose of the plan is to fulfill the mission to keep Navy Pier as a world-class public space and to renovate the pier so it will have more evening and year-round entertainment and more compelling landscape and design features. The Polk Family Foundation (founded by Sol Polk) donated $20 million to the redevelopment effort; the park and fountain at the entrance to the pier was named the Polk Bros Park and Fountain. The park hosts concerts and screens films.

A new Ferris wheel for the pier was announced on June 23, 2015. It is tall, taller than its predecessor. Rides now last twelve minutes instead of seven and feature three revolutions. The new wheel has brighter lights and opened in May 2016.

&quot;The Centennial Vision&quot;&#x27;s first phase was completed in summer 2016. Work included the redesign of the Pier&#x27;s public spaces, known as Pierscape, and improvements to the interior of the Family Pavilion and South Arcade. Phase I projects included the transformation of South Dock into a more engaging, greener space, conversion of the South Arcade indoor walkway into a Chicago-themed food experience and creation of a lighted water fountain/ice skating rink in Polk Bros Park. In November 2016, Phase I development achieved Gold certification under the Sustainable SITES Initiative (SITES) rating system, based on its expanded green spaces, improved pedestrian access, energy efficiency, innovative storm water management, and use of recycled local materials.

Phase II projects include the development of a seven-story, 240-room hotel, adjacent to the south side of Festival Hall; marquee additions to the East End Plaza, including a proposed arched, elevated overlook walkway and reflective water feature; a Welcome Pavilion in the 13-acre Polk Bros Park with 4,000 square feet for guest services and programmatic space; a seasonal ice rink within the footprint of the Polk Bros Park&#x27;s fountain and plaza; and a short-term, north-side boat docking facility for use by recreational boaters seasonally.

==Attractions==

There are many outdoor attractions at the Navy Pier Park, such as the Pepsi Wave Swinger, Light Tower Ride, Remote Control Boats (now removed along with fountain around the Wave Swinger), Teacups and the Carousel. New for 2021 is Drop Tower, an S&amp;S Double Shot relocated from the closed Pleasure Island.

Amazing Chicago&#x27;s Funhouse Maze is on the pier. It is a self-paced, full sensory maze experience where a person navigates their way through of tunnels and mazes. Crystal Gardens is a one-acre, botanical garden inside the pier. It is a six-story glass atrium with a arched ceiling. Many schools come here for field-trips to see and experience the attraction.

The Chicago Children&#x27;s Museum is a part of the pier, with many different exhibits and activities for both children and adults to enjoy. Chicago Shakespeare Theater, a theater that performs Shakespeare&#x27;s productions, is located there.

The original Ferris wheel was sold on September 27, 2015, and moved to Branson, Missouri, where it opened in 2016. The new Ferris wheel which replaced it is a DW60 from Dutch Wheels, the Netherlands-based company that built the pier&#x27;s former wheel. The state-of-the-art DW60 is the first of its kind in the U.S. with similar wheels currently in operation in Hong Kong and Baku, Azerbaijan. Significant features include two-sided cars that allow for easy loading and unloading, a fortified structure to withstand winds of and safety glass capable of weathering intense storms. The new Ferris Wheel was unveiled on May 27, 2016.

Around April 2019, the pier’s original carousel that had operated since 1995 was dismantled and removed, after the original carousel’s mechanism broke due to cold weather in early 2019. Around late May into June, a new carousel was installed in the site of the original. This new carousel had previously operated at Dorney Park from 1986-2016 under the name Chance Carousel.

The halls were used to represent Atlantic City, New Jersey, in the 1986 movie &quot;The Color of Money&quot; for the 9-Ball Championship.

In both &quot;Raw Deal&quot; and &quot;Cooley High&quot;, the pier was used as a location for car chases.

The fourth season finale of &quot;T. J. Hooker&quot;, titled &quot;The Chicago Connection&quot;, featured a scene in front of the then-abandoned pier.

In the film &quot;Divergent&quot;, the pier and Ferris wheel are shown abandoned and decayed in a future Chicago and it is stated that they were abandoned by choice a long time before. The Dauntless members play capture the flag in the park. Tris and Four climb the Ferris wheel to spot the opposing team. In the book, the opposing team hides the flag in a park near Navy Pier, while in the film version, the flag is hidden in a tower of the Chicago Children&#x27;s Museum building.

In the video game &quot;NASCAR 09&quot;, the pier is featured as a fictional race track.

The album/DVD &quot;A Long Day&#x27;s Night&quot; by Blue Öyster Cult was recorded live at Navy Pier/Skyline Stage on June 21, 2002.

<doc id="44950" wikidata="Q1897" url="?curid=44950" title="Cagliari">
<text>Cagliari (, , ; ; ; ) is an Italian municipality and the capital and largest city of the island of Sardinia, an autonomous region of Italy. It has about 155,000 inhabitants, while its metropolitan city (including Cagliari and 16 other nearby municipalities) has about 420,000 inhabitants. According to Eurostat, the population of the functional urban area, the commuting zone of Cagliari, rises to 476,975. Cagliari is the 26th largest city in Italy and the largest city on the island of Sardinia.

An ancient city with a long history, Cagliari has seen the rule of several civilisations. Under the buildings of the modern city there is a continuous stratification attesting to human settlement over the course of some five thousand years, from the Neolithic to today. Historical sites include the prehistoric Domus de Janas, very damaged by cave activity, a large Carthaginian era necropolis, a Roman era amphitheatre, a Byzantine basilica, three Pisan-era towers and a strong system of fortification that made the town the core of Spanish Habsburg imperial power in the western Mediterranean Sea. Its natural resources have always been its sheltered harbour, the often powerfully fortified hill of &quot;Castel di Castro&quot;, the modern &quot;Casteddu&quot;, the salt from its lagoons, and, from the hinterland, wheat from the Campidano plain and silver and other ores from the Iglesiente mines.

Cagliari was the capital of the Kingdom of Sardinia from 1324 to 1848, when Turin became the formal capital of the kingdom (which in 1861 became the Kingdom of Italy). Today the city is a regional cultural, educational, political and artistic centre, known for its diverse Art Nouveau architecture and several monuments. It is also Sardinia&#x27;s economic and industrial hub, having one of the biggest ports in the Mediterranean Sea, an international airport, and the 106th highest income level in Italy (among 8,092 comuni), comparable to that of several northern Italian cities.

It is also the seat of the University of Cagliari, founded in 1607, and of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cagliari, since the 5th century AD.

==History==


===Early history===
The Cagliari area has been inhabited since the Neolithic. It occupies a favourable position between the sea and a fertile plain and is surrounded by two marshes (which provides defence against attacks from the inland). There are high mountains nearby, to which people could evacuate if the settlement had to be given up. Relics of prehistoric inhabitants were found in the hill of Monte Claro (Monte Claro culture) and in Cape Sant&#x27;Elia (several domus de janas).

Karaly (, ) was established around the 8th/7th century BC as one of a string of Phoenician colonies in Sardinia, including Tharros. The etymology of the toponym is unknown. It almost certainly does not come from the Phoenician language, but it has some similarities with other Sardinian or Asia Minor toponyms. Its founding is linked to its position along communication routes with Africa as well as to its excellent port. The Phoenician settlement was located in the Stagno di Santa Gilla, west of the present centre of Cagliari. This was also the site of the Roman &quot;Portus Scipio&quot;, and when Arab pirates raided the area in the 8th century it became the refuge for people fleeing from the city. Other Phoenician settlements have been found at Cape Sant&#x27;Elia.

In the late 6th century BC Carthage took control of part of Sardinia, and Cagliari grew substantially under its domination, as testified by the large Tuvixeddu necropolis and other remains. Cagliari was a fortified settlement in what is now the modern Marina quarter, with an annexed holy area in the modern Stampace.

Sardinia and Cagliari came under Roman rule in 238 BC, shortly after the First Punic War, when the Romans defeated the Carthaginians. No mention of it is found on the occasion of the Roman conquest of the island but, during the Second Punic War, Caralis was the headquarters of the praetor, Titus Manlius Torquatus, whence he conducted his operations against Hampsicora and the Carthaginians. At other times it was also the Romans&#x27; chief naval station on the island and the residence of its praetor.

The Romans built a new settlement east of the old Punic city, the &quot;vicus munitus Caralis&quot; (i.e. the fortified community of Caralis) mentioned by Varro Atacinus. The two urban agglomerations merged gradually during the second century BC; to this process is perhaps attributable the plural name Carales.

Florus calls it the &quot;urbs urbium&quot; or capital of Sardinia. He represents it as taken and severely punished by Gracchus, but this statement is wholly at variance with Livy&#x27;s account of the wars of Gracchus, in Sardinia, according to which the cities were faithful to Rome, and the revolt was confined to the mountain tribes. In the Civil War between Caesar and Pompey, the citizens of Caralis were the first to declare in favor of the former, an example soon followed by the other cities of Sardinia; and Caesar himself touched there with his fleet on his return from Africa. A few years later, when Sardinia fell into the hands of Menas, the lieutenant of Sextus Pompeius, Caralis was the only city which offered any resistance, but was taken after a short siege.

Cagliari continued to be regarded as the capital of the island under the Roman Empire, and though it did not become a colony, obtained the status of &quot;municipium&quot;.

Remains of Roman public buildings were found to the west of Marina in Piazza del Carmine. There was an area of ordinary housing near the modern Via Roma, and richer houses on the slopes of the Marina distinct. The amphitheatre is located to the west of the Castello.

A Christian community is attested in Cagliari at least as early as the 3rd century, and by the end of that century the city had a Christian bishop. In the middle decades of the 4th century bishop Lucifer of Cagliari was exiled because of his opposition to the sentence against Athanasius of Alexandria at the Synod of Milan. He was banished to the desert of Thebais by the emperor Constantius II.

Claudian describes the ancient city of Karalis as extending to a considerable length towards the promontory or headland, the projection of which sheltered its port. The port affords good anchorage for large vessels, but besides this, which is only a well-sheltered standby, there is a large salt-water lake or lagoon, called the Stagno di Cagliari, adjoining the city and communicating by a narrow channel with the bay, which appears from Claudian to have been used in ancient times as an inner harbor or basin. The promontory adjoining the city is evidently that noticed by Ptolemy (), but the Caralitanum Promontorium of Pliny can be no other than the headland, now called Capo Carbonara, which forms the eastern boundary of the Gulf of Cagliari and the southeast point of the whole island. Immediately off it lay the little island of Ficaria, now called the &quot;Isola dei Cavoli&quot; (&quot;Cabbage Island&quot; in Italian, &quot;Isula de is Càvurus&quot; &quot;Crab Island&quot; in Sardinian).

After the fall of the Western Roman Empire Cagliari fell, together with the rest of Sardinia, into the hands of the Vandals, but appears to have retained its importance throughout the Middle Ages.

===Judicate of Cagliari===
Subsequently, ruled by the Vandals, Ostrogoths, and then part of the Byzantine Empire, Cagliari became the capital of a gradually independent Judicate, (from Latin Iudex, Governor and Supreme Magistrate, used in late Roman and Byzantine period, along with the medieval Greek ἄρχων). This state was born around 1020 and was overthrown by the Republic of Pisa in 1258. Due to the overlap of buildings since the year 800 B.C., and the scarcity of archeological and historical informations, it was believed that the population was moved to more inland areas of the territory, along the lagoon, in a city called Santa Ilia or Santa Igia (modern San Gilla) and it was believed that the ancient Roman and Byzantine city had been abandoned because it was too exposed to attacks by Moorish pirates coming from north Africa and Spain. Recent studies have instead hypothesized that the capital of the Giudicato was located around the road that it directed towards Sassari, today called Corso Vittorio Emanuele II (in Sardinian language: Su Brugu, the borough), although there are not yet archeological confirmations, particularly of the Cathedral and the Judex Palace, destroyed after the Pisan conquest. The Judicate of Cagliari comprised a large area of the Campidano plain, the Sulcis-Iglesiente and the mountain region of Ogliastra.

===11th to 13th century===

During the 11th century, the Republic of Pisa began to extend its political influence over the Judgedom of Cagliari. Pisa and the maritime republic of Genoa had a keen interest in Sardinia because it was a perfect strategic base for controlling the commercial routes between Italy and North Africa.

In 1215 the Pisan Lamberto Visconti, husband of Elena of Gallura, forced the judikessa Benedetta of Cagliari to give him the mount located east of Santa Igia. Soon (1216–17) Pisan merchants established there a new fortified city, known as &quot;Castel di Castro&quot;, which can be considered the ancestor of the modern city of Cagliari.

In 1258, after the defeat of William III, the last king of Cagliari, the Pisans and their Sardinian allies (Arborea, Gallura and Logudoro) destroyed the old capital of Santa Igia. The Judgedom of Cagliari was then divided into three parts: the northeast third went to Gallura; the central portion was incorporated into Arborea; Sulcis and Iglesiente, on the southwest, were given to the Pisan della Gherardesca family, while the Republic of Pisa maintained control over its colony of Castel di Castro.

Some of the fortifications that still surround the current district of Castello were built by the Pisans, including the two remaining white limestone towers (early 14th century) designed by the architect Giovanni Capula. Together with the district of Castello, Castel di Castro comprised the districts of Marina (which included the port), and later and Villanova. Marina and Stampace were guarded by walls, in contrast to Villanova, which was mostly home to peasants.

===14th to 17th centuries===

In the second decade of the 14th century the Crown of Aragon conquered Sardinia after a series of battles against the Pisans. During the siege of Castel di Castro (1324-1326), the Aragonese, led by Alfonso IV of Aragon, built a stronghold on a more southern hill, that of Bonaria.

When the fortified city was finally conquered by the Aragonese army, Castel di Castro (&quot;Castel de Càller&quot; or simply Càller in Catalan) became the administrative capital of the newborn Kingdom of Sardinia, one of the many kingdoms forming the Crown of Aragon, which later came under the rule of the Spanish Empire. After the expulsion of the Tuscans, the Castello district was repopulated by the Aragonese settlers of Bonaria while the indigenous population was, as in the past, concentrated in Stampace and Villanova.

The kings of Sardinia, also kings of Aragon and later kings of Spain, were represented in Cagliari by a viceroy, who resided in the Palazzo Regio.
In the 16th century the fortifications of the city were strengthened with the construction of the bastions and the rights and benefits of the Aragonese were extended to all citizens. The intellectual life was relatively lively and in the early years of the 17th century the university was founded.

===18th century===
In 1718, after a brief rule by the Habsburgs, Cagliari and Sardinia came under the House of Savoy. As rulers of Sardinia, the Savoys took the title of kings of the Sardinian kingdom. During the Savoyard Era, until 1848, the institutions of the Sardinian kingdom remained unchanged, but with the &quot;Perfect Fusion&quot; in that year, all the possessions of the House of Savoy House, comprising Savoy, Nice (now part of France), Piedmont and from 1815 Liguria, were merged into a unitary state. Although Sardinian by name, the kingdom had its parliament in Turin, where the Savoys resided, and its members were mainly aristocrats from Piedmont or the mainland.

In the late 18th century during the French Revolutionary Wars France tried to conquer Cagliari because of its strategic role in the Mediterranean sea (&quot;Expédition de Sardaigne&quot;). A French army landed on Poetto beach and advanced towards Cagliari, but the French were defeated by Sardinians who had decided to defend themselves against the revolutionary army. The people of Cagliari hoped to receive some concession from the Savoys in return for their defence of the town. For example, aristocrats from Cagliari asked for a Sardinian representative in the parliament of the kingdom. When the Savoyards refused any concession to the Sardinians, the inhabitants of Cagliari rose up against them and expelled all the representatives of the kingdom along with the Piedmontese rulers. This insurgence is celebrated in Cagliari during &quot;Sa die de sa Sardigna&quot; (&quot;The day of Sardinia&quot;) on the last weekend of April. However, the Savoys regained control of the town after a brief period of autonomous rule.

===Modern age===
The population by the 1840s had reached 29,000. Starting in the 1870s, in the wake of the unification of Italy, the city experienced a century of rapid growth. Numerous buildings combined influences from Art Nouveau together with the traditional Sardinian taste for floral decoration; an example is the white marble City Hall near the port. Many buildings were erected by the end of the 19th century during the term of office of mayor Ottone Bacaredda. In 1905 he had to face up to the a violent, bloody revolt against the exorbitant cost of living, stoked by his political opponents and which caused a number of victims and extensive material damage. After various other ups and downs, and following another resignation, he was returned to office between 1911 and 1917. Ottone Bacaredda died in his modest house in Via San Giovanni, on 26 December 1921,
During the Second World War Cagliari was heavily bombed by the Allies in February 1943. In order to escape from the danger of bombardments and difficult living conditions, many people were evacuated from the city into the countryside. In total the victims of the bombings were more than 2000 and about 80% of the buildings were damaged. The city received the Gold Medal of Military Valour.

After the Italian armistice with the Allies in September 1943, the German Army took control of Cagliari and the island, but soon retreated peacefully in order to reinforce their positions in mainland Italy. The American Army then took control of Cagliari. Airports near the city (Elmas, Monserrato, Decimomannu, currently a NATO airbase) were used by Allied aircraft to fly to North Africa or mainland Italy and Sicily.

After the war, the population of Cagliari grew again and many apartment blocks and recreational areas were erected in new residential districts.

=== Coats of Arms of Cagliari ===
==Geography==
The city of Cagliari is situated in the south of Sardinia, overlooking the centre of the eponymous gulf, also called Golfo degli Angeli (&quot;Bay of Angels&quot;) after an ancient legend. The city is spread over and around the hill of the historic district of Castello and nine other limestone hills of the middle-to-late Miocene, unique heights of a little more than above sea level on the long plains of Campidano. The plain is actually a Graben formed during the Alpine orogeny of the Cenozoic, which separated Sardinia from the European continent, roughly where the Gulf of Lion is now. The Graben filled in the course of tectonic movements associated with the breakup of the ancient island Paleozoic skeleton.
The repeated intrusion of the sea left calcareous sediments that formed a series of hills that mark the territory of Cagliari. Castello is where the fortified town arose in the Middle Age near the harbour of the port, other hills are those of Mount Urpinu, the St. Elias hill, also known as the &quot;Sella del Diavolo&quot; (&quot;Saddle of the Devil&quot;) for its shape, Tuvumannu and Tuvixeddu, the site of the ancient Punic and Roman necropolis, the small Bonaria hill, where the basilica stands, and the San Michele hill, with the eponymous castle on top. The modern city occupies the flat spaces between the hills and the sea to the south and southeast, along the Poetto beach, the lagoons and ponds of Santa Gilla and Molentargius, and the remains of more recent marine intrusions, in an articulate landscape with many landmarks and panoramas of the bay, the plain, and the mountains that surround it on the east (The Seven Brothers and Serpeddì) and west (the mountains of Capoterra). On the cold, clear days of winter, the snowy peaks of Gennargentu can be seen from the highest points of the city.
The city has four historic neighbourhoods: Castello, Marina, Stampace and Villanova and several modern districts (such as San Benedetto, Monte Urpinu and Genneruxi at the east, Sant&#x27;Avendrace at the west, Is Mirrionis/San Michele at north and Bonaria, La Palma and Poetto at the south), grown when part of the ancient walls had been demolished in the middle of the 19th century.

=== Pirri === 
The comune of Cagliari has one circoscrizione, the town of Pirri (about 30.000 inhabitants), former village of the Campidano absorbed in the fast growth after the Second World War.

===Parks and recreation===
Cagliari is one of the &quot;greenest&quot; Italian cities. Every inhabitant of Cagliari has access to of public gardens and parks.

Its mild climate allows the growth of numerous subtropical plants, such as &quot;Jacaranda mimosifolia&quot;, &quot;Ficus macrophylla&quot;, with some huge specimens in Via Roma and in the University Botanic Gardens, &quot;Erythrina afra&quot; with its stunning red flowers, &quot;Ficus retusa&quot;, which provides shade for several of the city&#x27;s streets, &quot;Araucaria heterophylla&quot;, the date palm (&quot;Phoenix dactylifera&quot;), the Canary Islands palm (&quot;Phoenix canariensis&quot;) and the Mexican Fan Palm (&quot;Washingtonia robusta&quot;).

Major city parks include: 
* Monte Urpinu Park, the most wooded, is a low hill covered by a pine (&quot;Pinus halepensis Mill.&quot;) and evergreen oak (&quot;Quercus ilex L.&quot;) forest with a dense Mediterranean maquis of mastic (&quot;Pistacia lentiscus L.&quot;), juniper (&quot;Juniperus phoenicea L.&quot;), Kermes oak (&quot;Quercus coccifera L.&quot;), wild olive (&quot;Olea europaea L. ssp. europaea, var. sylvestris&quot;) and tree spurge (&quot;Euphorbia dendroides L.&quot;). It extends for about .
* Park of San Michele hill (about 25 hectares), with its medieval castle on the top;
* Terramaini Park, about , with a little pond which is home to flamingos and other wading birds;
* Monte Claro Provincial Park, about , which hosts the provincial library in an old mansion on the top of the hill;
* Ex-vetreria Pirri Park, about ;
* Public gardens, the oldest public esplanade of the city, planted in the 19th century, with a wonderful promenade of &quot;Jacaranda mimosifolia D.Don&quot;.

The Molentargius - Saline Regional Park is located near the city. Some mountain parks, such as Monte Arcosu or Maidopis, with large forests and wildlife (Sardinian deer, wild boars, etc.) are also nearby.

The city is the starting and ending point of the Path of 100 Towers, which consist of a trekking route named after the 105 towers located along the whole Sardinian coast.

====Beaches====

The main beach of Cagliari is the Poetto. It stretches for about , from Sella del Diavolo (&quot;Devil&#x27;s Saddle&quot;) up to the coastline of Quartu Sant&#x27;Elena. Poetto is also the name of the district located on the western stretch of the strip between the beach and Saline di Molentargius (&quot;Molentargius&#x27;s Salt Mine&quot;).

Another smaller beach is that of Calamosca near the Sant&#x27;Elia district. On the coast between Calamosca and Poetto beaches, among the cliffs of the Sella del Diavolo, lies Cala Fighera, a small bay.

Cagliari is close to other seaside locations such as Santa Margherita di Pula, Chia, Geremeas, Solanas, Villasimius and Costa Rei.

===Climate=== 
Cagliari has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;), with hot, dry summers and mild winters like other historical regions along the coast. Its precipitation values also bring it closer to semi-arid conditions. The summer extreme values can be slightly over , sometimes with very high humidity, while in winter, under special and rare conditions, the temperature drops slightly below zero. Heavy snowfalls occur on average every thirty years.

The average temperature of the coldest month, January, is about , and of the warmest month, August, about . But heat waves can occur, due to African anticyclone, starting in June. From mid-June to mid-September, rain is a rare event, limited to brief afternoon storms. The rainy season starts in September, and the first cold days come in December.

Winds are frequent, especially the mistral and sirocco; in summer a marine sirocco breeze (called &quot;s&#x27;imbattu&quot; in Sardinian language) lowers the temperature and brings some relief from the heat.

==Demographics== 


According to ISTAT, in 2014 there were 154,356 people residing in Cagliari (+3.0% compared with 2011), of whom 71,522 were male and 82,834 female for a sex ratio of 0.86. Minors (children aged 18 and younger) totaled 12.92% of the population, compared to pensioners at 24.81%. The average age of Cagliari residents is 47.44. The ratio of the population over 65 years of age to that under the age of 18, is 53.39%. The elderly population, defined as being over 65 years of age, has increased by 21.95% over the last 10 years. The current birth rate in Cagliari is 6.29 births per 1,000 inhabitants. The average number of people of any age per household is 2.11 and the percentage of households composed of a single person is 42.53%. The population of Cagliari is structured like that of other first world countries, especially as to the prevalence of an elderly population. The trend of these rates in the Cagliari metropolitan area is proportionally reversed in the suburbs, where most younger families move.

, 5.8% (8,796 people) of the population was foreign, of which the largest group were Filipinos (17.21%), followed by Ukrainians (10.38%), Romanians (8.42%), Senegalese (8.25%) and Chinese (7.94%).

In 1928, during the fascist regime, the neighbouring municipalities of Pirri, Monserrato, Selargius, Quartucciu and Elmas, were merged with that of Cagliari. Mussolini&#x27;s regime wanted to streamline the local administration by eliminating many small towns and at the same time show that Italy was a major power with many large cities. After the war these small municipalities gradually regained their autonomy, except for the former town of Pirri.

The first table shows the inhabitants of the town in its present borders, the second one the commune population including the merged municipalities.

===Metropolitan City===
The Metropolitan City of Cagliari has been established in 2016 by a Sardinia Regional Law and totals about 420,000 inhabitants according to ISTAT. It is composed of 17 municipalities along the coast of the gulf and up to of the inner Campidano plain.

It covers an area on the plain of Campidano between large basins (Santa Gilla lagoon and salt mills of about 30 km2 or 3200 acres), ponds (Molentargius), 16,22 km2 (40,10 acres) and the depopulated mountains up to above sea level. The mountains are largely covered by forests mostly managed by the Ente Foreste of the Autonomous Region of Sardinia. To the west these amount to on the Capoterra and Pula mountains. Monte Arcosu WWF Natural Reserve has another , and to the east on Mount Serpeddì and Sette Fratelli there are a total of of forest.

The Metropolitan City is defined by municipalities where the population increased between the last two censuses, in a region where the population is otherwise generally decreasing. These municipalities welcome immigrants to the urban area whose main nucleus, the city of Cagliari, has a high number of elderly people.

In the last century, the population of the municipalities of the metropolitan area increased by 354% and in the last 50 years by 158% (1911: 128,444; 1961: 288,683; 2011: 454,819). For the whole of Sardinia this increase was respectively 88% and 15% (1911: 868,181; 1961: 1,419,362; 2011: 1,639,362). The urbanisation towards the area of Cagliari was, in percentage terms, impressive, making the capital of the island a metropolis surrounded by rural areas increasingly depopulated. This urbanisation is also reflected in the concentration in Cagliari of most of the economic activities and wealth.

==Economy==

According to 2014 data from the Italian Ministry of Economic Affairs, the inhabitants of Cagliari benefited a per capita income of 23,220 euros (being the fifth Regional Capital), that is the 122% of the national average, while all of Sardinia benefited only 16,640 euros, being the 13th Region and 86% of the national average. The metropolitan area benefited an average income of 19,185 euros, 103% of the national average. With the 26% of the island population the Cagliari Metropolitan City produces the 31% of its GDP.

As the capital city of the Autonomous Region of Sardinia, Cagliari is the administrative hub and headquarters of the region as well as of the provincial and regional offices of the Italian central administration. Cagliari is also the main trade and industrial centre of the island, with numerous commercial sites and factories within its metropolitan boundaries.

Cagliari is the fourth port of Italy for movement of goods in tons (35,922,468), and the 18th for passengers (705,715), of whom 394,697 cruise passengers (8th in Italy).

The first department store, (La Rinascente) opened in 1931 in the centre of the city, and it is still open today. Nowadays there are many commercial centres in the metropolitan area (Le Vele, Santa Gilla, La Corte del Sole, Marconi) hosting many European chain stores such as Auchan, Metro AG, Lidl, MediaWorld, Euronics, Jysk, IKEA, Carrefour and Bata Shoes. Cagliari is also home to an Amazon customer service center.

Cagliari is the main operational headquarters of the Banco di Sardegna, which belongs to the BPER Group and is listed on Borsa Italiana, of the Banca di Cagliari. Banca di Credito Sardo was based in Cagliari until it was absorbed by the parent company Intesa Sanpaolo.

The Macchiareddu-Grogastru area between Cagliari and Capoterra is one of the most important industrial areas of Sardinia, in conjunction with a large international container terminal port at Giorgino. Beside having one of the biggest container terminals on the Mediterranean Sea, Cagliari also has one of the largest fish markets in Italy offering for sale a vast array of fish to both the public and traders. The communications provider Tiscali also has its headquarters in Cagliari.

Multinational corporations like Coca-Cola, Heineken, Unilever, Bridgestone and Eni Group have factories in town. One of the six oil refinery supersites in Europe, Saras, is located within the metropolitan area at Sarroch.

Tourism is one of the major industries of the city, although historical venues such as its monumental Middle Ages and Early modern period defence system, its Carthaginian, Roman and Byzantine ruins are less highlighted compared to the recreational beaches and coastline. Cruise ships touring the Mediterranean often stop for passengers at Cagliari, and the city is a traffic hub to the nearby beaches of Villasimius, Chia, Pula and Costa Rei, as well as to the urban beach of Poettu. Pula is home to the archaeological site of the Punic and Roman city of Nora. Especially in summer many clubs and pubs are goals for young locals and tourists. Pubs and night-clubs are concentrated in the Corso Vittorio Emanuele II, a narrow street in Stampace district, in the Marina district, near the port and in the Castello district, The clubs are mostly to be found on the Poetto Beach (in summer) or in Viale Marconi (in winter). In Cagliari there are 180 B&amp;B and 22 hotels that totals 3,300 beds. There are many others hotels in seaside resort of his gulf.

==Main sights==
Considerable remains of the ancient city of Karalis are still visible, including those of the Tuvixeddu necropolis (the largest Punic necropolis still in existence), the Roman amphitheatre, traditionally called &quot;Is centu scalas&quot; (&quot;One hundred steps&quot;), and of an aqueduct used to provide generally scarce water. Still visible are also some ancient cisterns of vast extent, the ruins of a small circular temple, and numerous sepulchres on a hill outside the modern town that appear to have formed the necropolis of the ancient city.

The Palaeo-Christian Basilica of San Saturnino, dedicated to a martyr killed under Diocletian&#x27;s reign, Saturninus of Cagliari, patron saint of the city, was built in the 5th century. Of the original building the dome and the central part remain, to which two arms (one with a nave and two aisles) were added later. A Palaeo-Christian crypt is also under the church of &quot;San Lucifero&quot; (1660), dedicated to Saint Lucifer, a bishop of the city. The church has a Baroque façade with ancient columns and sculpted parts, some of which came from the nearby necropolis.
The old medieval town (called &quot;Castello&quot; in Italian, &quot;Casteddu de susu&quot; in Sardinian, &quot;the upper castle&quot;) lies on top of a hill with a view of the Gulf of Cagliari (also known as Angels&#x27; Gulf). Most of its city walls are intact and include two early 14th-century white limestone towers, the Torre di San Pancrazio and the Torre dell&#x27;Elefante, typical examples of Pisan military architecture. The local white limestone was also used to build the walls of the city and many other buildings, besides the towers. The exact period of construction of a fortress on this hill is unknown at present, due to the superposition of layers of buildings along the history. Some scholars have suggested a first urbanization of the quarter in the Punic era on the basis of similarity of the planimetry with the contemporary Carthaginian fortress of Monte Sirai. Recently, archaeological excavations have identified Punic and Roman buildings under the ramparts of the fortress. Already the Roman poet Varro called the city &quot;Vicus munitus&quot;, a fortified city, and sixteenth-century authors describe a Roman acropolis perhaps still visible in their day.

D. H. Lawrence, in his memoir of a voyage to Sardinia, &quot;Sea and Sardinia&quot;, that he undertook in January 1921, described the effect of warm Mediterranean sunlight on the white limestone city and compared Cagliari to a &quot;white Jerusalem&quot;.

The cathedral was restored in the 1930s, returning the former Baroque façade into a Medieval Pisan-style façade more akin to the original appearance of the church in the 13th century. The bell tower is original. The interior has a nave and two aisles, with a pulpit (1159–1162) sculpted for the Cathedral of Pisa but later donated to Cagliari. The crypt houses the remains of martyrs found in the Basilica of San Saturno (see below). Near the cathedral is the palace of the provincial government. Before 1900 it was the island&#x27;s governor&#x27;s palace.
The Sanctuary of Our Lady of Bonaria (from which the city of Buenos Aires, Argentina, gets its name) was built by the Catalans in 1324–1329 when they were besieging the Pisans in Castello. It has a small Gothic portal in the façade and the interior houses a wooden statue of the Madonna, which, after having been thrown off a Spanish ship, landed at the foot of Bonaria hill. Bonaria hill is also the location of the Monumental Cemetery of Bonaria.

The &quot;Chiesa della Purissima&quot; is a Catalan Gothic church built in the 16th century in the Castello distinct.

The other early districts of the town (Marina, Stampace and Villanova) retain much of their original character. In Stampace the Torre dello Sperone, another tower built by the Pisans in the late 13th century, is located, as well as two important monumental churches: the &quot;Collegiata di Sant&#x27;Anna&quot; and the &quot;Chiesa di San Michele&quot;, both built in the 18th century in a baroque style. Many more churches, both old and modern, can be found throughout the city.

The Promenade Deck and the Terrazza Umberto I were designed in 1896 by the engineers Joseph Costa and Fulgenzio Setti. The entire building was built of white and yellow limestone in a classical style with Corinthian columns. It was opened in 1901. A staircase with two flights provides access from Constitution Square. It is interrupted by a covered walkway and ends beneath the Arc de Triomphe, in the Terrazza Umberto I. In 1943, during World War II, the staircase and the Arch of Triumph were severely damaged by aerial bombardment, but after the conflict they were faithfully reconstructed.

From the Terrazza Umberto I the Bastion of Santa Caterina can be accessed via a short flight of steps. Here there was once an old Dominican convent, destroyed by fire in 1800. According to tradition, the conspiracy to kill the Viceroy Camarassa in 1666 was set up in the surroundings of the monastery.

The Promenade Deck was inaugurated in 1902. At first it was used as a banqueting hall, then during the First World War as an infirmary. In the 1930s, during the period of sanctions, it was an exhibition of autarky During World War II it served as a shelter for displaced people whose homes had been destroyed by bombs. In 1948 it hosted the first Trade Fair of Sardinia. After many years of decay, the Promenade was restored and re-evaluated as a cultural space reserved especially for art exhibitions. 

The modern districts built in the late 19th and early 20th century contain examples of Art Deco architecture, as well as controversial examples of Fascist neoclassicism architecture, such as the Court of Justice (&quot;Palazzo di Giustizia&quot;) in Republic Square. The Court of Justice is near the biggest city park, Monte Urpinu, with its pine trees, artificial lakes, and a vast area with a hill. The Orto Botanico dell&#x27;Università di Cagliari, the city&#x27;s botanical garden, is also of interest.

==Culture==
The city has numerous libraries and is also home to the State Archive, containing thousands of handwritten documents from the foundation of the Kingdom of Sardinia (1325 AD) to the present. In addition to numerous local and university department libraries, the most important libraries are the old University Library, with thousands of ancient books, the Provincial Library, the Regional Library, and the Mediateca of the Mediterranean, which contains the municipal archive and library collection.

In the first century B.C. a famous singer and musician from Cagliari, Tigellius, lived in Rome and was satirized by Cicero and Horace. The history of Sardinian literature begins in Cagliari in the first century A.D. In the funerary monument of Atilia Pomptilla, carved into the rock of the necropolis of Tuvixeddu, poems are engraved in Greek and Latin dedicated to his dead wife. Some of them, particularly those in the Greek language, have literary merit.

The first Sardinian literary author known was Bishop Lucifer of Cagliari, who wrote severe pamphlets against the Arian heresy in the fourth century A.D. Only in the eleventh century A.D. did the first texts of an administrative nature appear in the modern Sardinian language, together with hagiographies of local martyrs written in Latin.

Life in Cagliari has been depicted by many writers, starting with the late Roman poet Claudian. In the late 16th century, the local humanist Roderigo Hunno Baeza dedicated to his town a didactic Latin poem, &quot;Caralis Panegyricus&quot;. At the beginning of the 17th century Juan Francisco Carmona wrote a hymn to Cagliari in Spanish; Jacinto Arnal De Bolea published in 1636, in Spanish, the first novel set in Cagliari, entitled &quot;El Forastero&quot;. David Herbert Lawrence wrote about the city in his &quot;Sea and Sardinia&quot;.

Modern writers connected to Cagliari include Giuseppe Dessì, Giulio Angioni, Giorgio Todde, Sergio Atzeni, (who set many of his novels and short stories, such as &quot;Bakunin&#x27;s Son&quot;, in ancient and modern Cagliari), Flavio Soriga.
Cagliari was the birthplace or residence of the composer Ennio Porrino, of the film, theatre and TV director Nanni Loy, and of the actors Gianni Agus, Amedeo Nazzari and Pier Angeli (born Anna Maria Pierangeli).

Excluding the Roman era amphitheater, the first theater was inaugurated in Cagliari in 1767: the Teatro Zapata, later becoming the Civic Theatre. Devastated by bombing in 1943, it was recently restored, but the roof was not rebuilt, and today it serves as an open-air theatre. The Politeama Regina Margherita, inaugurated in 1859, was destroyed by fire in 1942 and never rebuilt.

Although opera had, and in part still has, a solid tradition the city, it was left without a true theater until 1993 when a new opera house, the Teatro Lirico, was inaugurated. Inside there is a music compound with a music conservatory with its own auditorium, and a music park. Cagliari is and was home to opera singers such as the tenors Giovanni Matteo Mario (Giovanni Matteo De Candia, 1810–1883) and Piero Schiavazzi (1875–1949), the baritone Angelo Romero (born 1940), the contralto Bernadette Manca di Nissa, born 1954 and the soprano Giusy Devinu (1960–2007).

The Italian pop singer Marco Carta was also born in Cagliari, in 1985.

The old Teatro Massimo was only recently renovated and is now the seat of the Teatro Stabile of Sardinia. The Municipal Auditorium, in the former 17th-century church of Santa Teresa, is the seat of the Scuola di Arte Drammatica (School of Dramatic Art) di Cagliari, while the Teatro delle Saline (&quot;Saltworks Theatre&quot;), is home of Akroama, Teatro Stabile di Innovazione (&quot;Permanent Theater of Innovation&quot;).

Finally, some comic and satirical theater companies are active in the city, the most well known being the &quot;Compagnia Teatrale Lapola&quot;, which offers an urban version of the traditional campidanese comic theater.

Founded by Bepi Vigna, Antonio Serra and Michele Medda, a comic book school, the Centro Internazionale del Fumetto (&quot;Comic Strip International Centre&quot;) has been active for several decades. Its founders invented and designed the comic characters Nathan Never and Legs Weaver.

===Museums and galleries===

===Feast of Sant&#x27;Efis===
The Feast of St. Ephysius (Sant&#x27;Efisio in Italian, Sant&#x27;Efis in Sardinian) is the most important religious event of Cagliari, taking place every year on 1 May. During this festival, thousands of people from folk groups all over Sardinia wear their traditional costumes. The saint is escorted by the traditional ancient &quot;Milicia&quot;, the deputy mayor (Alter Nos), numerous confraternities, and a convoy of chariots pulled by oxen in a procession to Nora (near modern Pula), from Cagliari, where, according to tradition, he was beheaded. In addition to being one of the oldest, it is also the longest Italian religious procession, with about of walks over four days, and the largest in the Mediterranean area.

A plague was spreading throughout Sardinia, starting in 1652, and the epidemic infected Cagliari in particular, killing some ten thousand inhabitants. According to legend, in 1656 St. Ephysius appeared to the Spanish Viceroy, Francisco Fernández de Castro Andrade, Count of Lemos to request a procession on 1 May, in order to free the city from the plague. The Municipality of Cagliari swore that, if the plague disappeared, a procession would be held every day in the saint&#x27;s honor, starting from the Stampace district and ending at Nora where the saint was martyred. In September the plague ended, and the procession and festival was therefore regularly held starting the following year on 1 May. The procession was held even during the last war; a statue of the saint was placed on a lorry and, through city ruins of the devastated by the bombs, arrived safely in Nora.

===Other events===
Other feasts and events in Cagliari include:
*The Carnival
*Holy Week and Easter celebrations
*Sea processions of St. Francis of Paola, held in May, and Nostra Signora di Bonaria, in July
*Cagliari Fair, in early May

===Languages===

The native language of Cagliari, declared official along with Italian, is Sardinian (&quot;sardu&quot;), a Romance language, specifically the Campidanese dialect (&quot;campidanesu&quot;) in its local variant (&quot;casteddaju&quot;).

The variant of Cagliari in its high register has traditionally represented the linguistic model of reference for the entire southern area of the island, and the high social variant used by the middle class in the whole Campidanese domain, as well as the literary model of reference for writers and poets. This language is less spoken by the younger generations in the city, who use Italian instead as that language is compulsory in education and the mass media. Italian has increasingly become predominant in social relations, both formal and informal, relegating Sardinian to a mostly marginal role in everyday life. Young people often have only passive competence in the language, gathered from elderly relatives who still speak it, as their parents often speak only Italian, or they may use a slang (&quot;italianu porceddinu&quot;) that mixes both Sardinian and Italian.

Since Cagliari was the metropolis of the ancient Roman province, it absorbed innovations coming from Rome, Carthage, and Constantinople, and its language probably reflected late Latin urban dialects of the 5th-century core cities of the empire.

===Gastronomy===
Cagliari has some unique gastronomic traditions: unlike the rest of the island its cuisine is mostly based on the wide variety of locally available seafood. Although it is possible to trace influences from Catalan, Sicilian and Genoese cuisine, Cagliaritan food has a distinctive and unique character.

Excellent wines are also part of Cagliaritanians&#x27; dinners, like the Cannonau, Nuragus, Nasco, Monica, Moscau, Girò and Malvasia, produced in the nearby vineyards of the Campidano plain.

==Media==
The main newspaper of Sardinia is &quot;L&#x27;Unione Sarda&quot;, it was founded in Cagliari in 1889. It was one of the first European newspapers to have its own website in 1994. It has a circulation of about 85,000 copies.

The main regional headquarters of RAI, the Italian state-owned radio and television network, is in Cagliari. There are also two regional television and radio companies as well as numerous information sites on the internet.

==Sports==

Cagliari is home to the football team Cagliari Calcio, winner of the Italian league championship in 1970, when the team was led by Gigi Riva. Founded in 1920, the club played at the Stadio Sant&#x27;Elia in the city from 1970 until it was closed in the summer of 2017, causing the club to temporarily relocate to the provisional Sardegna Arena (now Unipol Domus). Sant&#x27;Elia was the venue for three 1990 FIFA World Cup matches.

Cagliari is an ideal location for water sports such as surfing, kitesurfing, windsurfing and sailing due to strong and reliable favourable winds. Field hockey is also popular, with two teams in the Italian top division, G.S. Amsicora and C.U.S. Cagliari, the first of which won the league title more often than any other Italian team in the men&#x27;s championship (20) and is also the protagonist in the women&#x27;s division.

Sport venues in Cagliari include:
*Unipol Domus
*Tennis Club Cagliari
*Rockfeller sports hall
*Rockfeller skating rink
*Via dello Sport gymnastics hall
*Terra Maini Olympionic pool

*Rari Nantes pool
*Esperia pool
*Riccardo Santoru athletics stadium
*Civic pool

==Government==
Cagliari is the hub of the administration offices of the Sardinia Autonomous Region and of Cagliari Province. It is also the home of several local offices of the Italian central administration.

It is the seat of the Superintendency of Cultural and Environmental Heritage, of the Sardinia Archival Superintendency and of the Archeological Superintendency of the Cultural Heritage Ministry, of the Sardinia and Provincial seat of the Employment and Social Policies Ministry, of the regional offices of the Finance and Economy Ministry, and of some branch offices of the Health Ministry.

Cagliari is home to all criminal, civil, administrative and accounting courts for Sardinia of the Ministry of Justice up to the High Court of Assizes of Appeal. It was home to a prison, Buon Cammino, built in the late 19th century, famous because no one has ever managed to escape. A new modern prison has been built in the nearby town of Uta.

Traditionally, votes in Cagliari are oriented towards the center-right wing. Since World War II, all the mayors belonged to the Christian Democracy party with the exception of Salvatore Ferrara, from the Socialist Party, allied with the former. After the collapse of the traditional parties in the 1990s, the mayors belonged to the party or the coalition led by Silvio Berlusconi. The current economic and political crisis that affects Italy has prompted the electorate toward a large abstention and to elect a young mayor, Massimo Zedda, who belongs to a centre-left alliance. In the last municipal elections in June 2016, Massimo Zedda was confirmed in the first round with 50.86% of the votes.

==Education==

Cagliari is home to the University of Cagliari, the largest public university in Sardinia, founded in 1626. It currently includes six faculties: Engineering and Architecture, Medicine and Surgery, Economics, Juridical and Political Sciences, Basic Sciences, Biology and Pharmacy, Humanistic Studies.

It is attended by about 35,000 students. All science faculties of the university, as well as the university hospital, have been transferred to a new &quot;University Citadel&quot;, located in Monserrato. Cagliari&#x27;s downtown houses the engineering and the humanities divisions and, in the Castle, the seat of the Rector, in an 18th-century palace with a library of thousands of ancient books.

Cagliari is also the seat of the Pontifical Faculty of Theology of Sardinia and of the European Institute of Design.

==Health care==

Life expectancy in Cagliari is high: 79.5 years for men and 85.4 for women (provincial level).

There has been a public hospital in Cagliari since the 17th century. The first modern structure was built in the middle of the 19th century, designed by the architect Gaetano Cima. This hospital is still operating, although all its departments will eventually be transferred to the new University Hospital in Monserrato.

Among the other public hospitals, the Giuseppe Brotzu (San Michele) Hospital was recognized in 1993 as a High Specialization Nationally Relevant Hospital, particularly for liver, heart, pancreas and bone marrow transplants.

Other public hospitals in the city include: the &quot;Santissima Trinità&quot; or commonly &quot;Is Mirrionis&quot;; the &quot;Binaghi&quot;, specialised in pulmonology; &quot;Marino&quot; specialised in traumatology, hyperbaric medicine and spinal cord injuries; &quot;Businco&quot; specialised in oncology; and &quot;Microcitemico&quot;, specialised in thalassemia, Genetic diseases and rare diseases. There are in addition many private hospitals.

Despite its dry climate, thanks to the regional system of dams, every inhabitant of Cagliari may have per day of safe drinking water.

Waste sorting is still at a low level: only 33.4 percent of waste is separated.

<text>McCormick Place is a convention center in Chicago. It is the largest convention center in North America. It consists of four interconnected buildings and one indoor arena sited on and near the shore of Lake Michigan, about south of the Chicago Loop. McCormick Place hosts numerous trade shows and meetings. The largest regular events are the Chicago Auto Show each February, the International Home and Housewares Show each March, the National Restaurant Association Annual Show each May, and the International Manufacturing Technology Show in the fall every other year.

==History==
As early as 1927, Robert R. McCormick, a prominent member of the McCormick family of McCormick Reaper/International Harvester fame, and publisher of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, championed a purpose-built lakeside convention center for Chicago. In 1958, ground was broken for a $35 million facility that opened in November 1960, and was named after McCormick, who died in 1955. The lead architect was Alfred Shaw, one of the architects of the Merchandise Mart. This building included the Arie Crown Theater, designed by Edward Durell Stone. It seated nearly 5,000 people and was the second largest theater (by seating capacity) in Chicago.

The 1960 exposition hall was destroyed in a major fire on January 16, 1967, despite being thought fireproof by virtue of its steel and concrete construction. At the time of the fire, the building contained highly combustible exhibits, several hydrants were shut off, and there were no sprinklers on the main floor where the fire started. Thus the fire spread quickly and destructively, taking the life of security guard Kenneth Goodman.

The fire was investigated by a team led by Rolf H. Jensen, Professor of Fire Protection Engineering at the Illinois Institute of Technology, who later went on to found RJA Group. Many lessons were learned and multiple building, electrical, and fire codes for the city and worldwide were amended to avert a repeat situation.

Although many wanted to rebuild the hall on a different site, Chicago mayor Richard J. Daley elected to rebuild on the foundations of the burned building. The new design of dark steel and glass, by Gene Summers of C. F. Murphy and Associates (and formerly of Mies van der Rohe&#x27;s office) contrasted markedly with the white look of the structure that had burned. On January 3, 1971, the replacement building, later called the East Building and now called the Lakeside Center, opened with a main exhibition hall. The Arie Crown Theatre sustained only minor damage in the 1967 fire, and so was incorporated into the interior of the new building. The theater, with the largest seating capacity of any active theater in Chicago (the Uptown Theatre having more seating, but currently closed), underwent major modifications in 1997 to improve its acoustics.

On March 27, 2020, the United States Army Corps of Engineers announced that the complex would begin transforming convention space into a 3,000-bed hospital in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis affecting the Chicago area. The $15 million project was paid for by FEMA and was scheduled for completion on April 30.

In 2021, it was proposed to turn Lakeside Center into a Rivers Casino, as part of the Chicago Casino Proposals.

In a move to help birds avoid colliding into its windows, McCormick Place Lakeside Center implemented a project in 2024 to make its windows more visible. The project, which cost $1.2 million and took three months to complete, was initiated following an incident in 2023 when, on a single night at the height of the fall bird migration, nearly 1,000 birds collided into the building&#x27;s windows and died. The modified windows are covered with an array of small white dots designed to be visible to birds. (The dots were applied to the building&#x27;s existing windows on sheets of adhesive film; the film was later removed, leaving the dots in place.) According to the Field Museum of Natural History, an analysis following the window modifications showed that the number of birds colliding with windows at the building during the fall migration season dropped by over 95% compared with migrations of previous years. The windows at McCormick Place Lakeside Center, which make up most of the building&#x27;s exterior, encompass an area of , roughly equivalent to two American football fields.

==Additions==
The North Building, located west of Lake Shore Drive and completed in 1986, is connected to the East Building by an enclosed pedestrian bridge. In contrast to the dark, flat profile of the East Building, the North Building is white (as the original building was), with twelve concrete pylons on the roof which support the roof using 72 cables. The HVAC system for the building is incorporated into the pylons and give the building the appearance of a rigged sailing ship. The North Building has approximately of main exhibition space.

The South Building, dedicated on December 12th, 1996, and designed by tvsdesign, contains more than of exhibition space. It more than doubled the space in the complex and made McCormick Place the largest convention center in the nation. The South Building was built on the former site of the McCormick Inn, a 25-story, 619-room hotel built in 1973 as part of the McCormick City complex and demolished in 1993 when ground was broken for the South Building.On August 2, 2007, McCormick Place officials opened yet another addition to the complex, the West Building, also designed by tvsdesign and costing $882 million and completed eight months ahead of schedule. The publicly financed West Building contains of exhibit space, bringing McCormick Place&#x27;s total existing exhibition space to . The West Building also has of meeting space, including 61 meeting rooms, as well as a ballroom, the size of a football field and one of the largest ballrooms in the world.

McCormick Place continued to expand in October 2017 with the opening of Wintrust Arena, a 10,387-seat arena situated on Cermak Road just north of the West Building. The new facility hosts DePaul Blue Demons men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s college basketball, and the WNBA&#x27;s Chicago Sky. The new arena boasts 22 suites, 479 club seats, and 2 VIP lounges. The arena is also equipped to host concerts, sporting events, meetings, and conventions in conjunction with the rest of the McCormick Place complex. Sporting events such as gymnastics and volleyball are also held in the McCormick Place buildings in addition to the arena.

Archival materials are held by the Ryerson &amp; Burnham Libraries at the Art Institute of Chicago. The McCormick Place on the Lake 1971 Collection includes photographs, drawings and project files documenting its construction.

South of the center is McCormick Place Bird Sanctuary, created in 2003. The northern end includes a recreated prairie, covering the roof of the center&#x27;s underground carpark, and so requiring the use of shallow-rooted plants.

==Public transit==
McCormick Place is served by the Chicago Transit Authority&#x27;s bus and &quot;L&quot; (rapid transit) systems; by Metra, Chicago&#x27;s commuter rail network; and by the South Shore Line, an interurban passenger rail service that runs between Chicago and South Bend, Indiana.

Metra Electric trains—which run between the Loop and points south—stop at an eponymous station underneath McCormick Place. South Shore trains also stop here, but only during special events, and will not board northbound nor discharge southbound passengers due to a non-compete agreement with Metra.

At the street level, CTA&#x27;s no. 3 and no. 21 bus routes—which run north-south and east-west through the South and Southwest Sides, respectively—serve McCormick directly. Cermak–McCormick Place, a station on the &quot;L&quot;&#x27;s Green Line, lies two blocks west of the convention center&#x27;s westernmost entrance.

==Busway==

The McCormick Place Busway runs from Lower Randolph between Michigan and Columbus in downtown Chicago to the center. It uses the lower levels of the multilevel streets near downtown, and surfaces to follow the Metra Electric District right-of-way to outside the South Building of McCormick Place. Opened in 2002 at a cost of $43 million, it is meant to provide a true and unencumbered expressway for visitors to move between downtown hotels and the convention center, but is also used by buses for Soldier Field events, public safety workers, Metra, convention contractors, and Art Institute deliveries, along with providing a secure route for national and international government officials to utilize between the two points. It is not necessarily restricted only to buses, despite its name. It is also known as the &quot;Mayor&#x27;s Road&quot; (as it runs to Maggie Daley Park, which was named in memoriam for mayor Richard M. Daley&#x27;s wife), the &quot;Bat Cave&quot;, the &quot;Magic Road&quot; and a &quot;secret road&quot;. Road use is administered by the Chicago OEMC (Office of Emergency Management and Communications), and regular users are granted access cards. The convention center advertises the road as a benefit to potential customers.

<text>Fiat S.p.A., or &quot;Fabbrica Italiana Automobili Torino&quot; (Italian Automobile Factory of Turin), was an Italian holding company whose original and core activities were in the automotive industry, and that was succeeded by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA). The Fiat Group contained many brands such as Ferrari, Maserati, Fiat, Alfa Romeo, the Chrysler Group, and many more. On 29 January 2014, it was announced that Fiat S.p.A. (the former owner of Fiat Group) was to be merged into a new Netherlands-based holding company Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA), taking place before the end of 2014. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles became the new owner of Fiat Group. On 1 August 2014, Fiat S.p.A. received necessary shareholder approval to proceed with the merger (which followed board approval). The merger became effective 12 October 2014.

Fiat was founded in 1899 by a group of investors, including Giovanni Agnelli. During its more than century-long history, Fiat has also manufactured railway engines and carriages, military vehicles, farm tractors, and aircraft. In 2013, Fiat (together with Chrysler) was the second largest European automaker by volumes produced, and the seventh in the world ahead of Honda, PSA Peugeot Citroën, Suzuki, Renault, and Daimler AG.

Over the years Fiat has acquired numerous other automakers: it acquired Lancia in 1968, became a shareholder of Ferrari in 1969, took control of Alfa Romeo from the Italian government in 1986, purchased Maserati in 1993, and became the full owner of Chrysler Group LLC in 2014. Fiat Group currently produces vehicles under twelve brands: Abarth, Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Dodge, Ferrari, Fiat, Fiat Professional, Jeep, Lancia, Maserati, Ram Trucks, and SRT.

In 1970 Fiat employed more than 100,000 in Italy when its production reached the highest number, 1.4 million cars, in that country. As of 2002, Fiat built more than 1 million vehicles at six plants in Italy and the country accounted for more than a third of the company&#x27;s revenue.

Fiat-brand cars are built in several locations around the world. Outside Italy, the largest country of production is Brazil, where the Fiat brand is the market leader. The group also has factories in Argentina, Poland and Mexico (where Fiat-brand vehicles are manufactured at plants owned and operated by Chrysler for export to the U.S., Brazil, Italy and other markets) and a long history of licensing manufacture of its products in other countries – in the 1960s, Fiat notably set up joint ventures in Eastern Europe with the best known being VAZ (Lada) in the former Soviet Union. It also has numerous alliances and joint ventures around the world, the main ones being located in Serbia, France, Turkey, India and China.

Gianni Agnelli, the grandson of founder Giovanni Agnelli, was Fiat&#x27;s chairman from 1966 until 1996; he then served as honorary chairman from 1996 until his death on 24 January 2003, during which time Cesare Romiti served as chairman. He was succeeded briefly by Paolo Fresco, who served as chairman, and Paolo Cantarella, as CEO. Umberto Agnelli then took over as chairman from 2003 to 2004. After Umberto Agnelli&#x27;s death on 28 May 2004, Luca Cordero di Montezemolo was named chairman, with Agnelli heir John Elkann becoming vice chairman (at the age of 28), and other family members also serving on the board. On 1 June 2004, Giuseppe Morchio was replaced by Sergio Marchionne as CEO.

==History==


Giovanni Agnelli, with several investors, founded the Fabbrica Italiana Automobili Torino (F.I.A.T.) società per azioni (S.p.a.), &quot;Italian Automobile Factory of Turin&quot;, in 1899. Its acronymous name was changed to upper- and lower-case &quot;Fiat&quot; in 1906. Agnelli led the company until his death in 1945, while Vittorio Valletta administered the firm&#x27;s daily activities. Its first car, the 3 ½ CV, of which only 24 copies were built, all bodied by Alessio of Turin, strongly resembled contemporary Benz, and had a boxer twin engine. In 1903, Fiat produced its first truck. In 1908, the first Fiat was exported to the US. That same year, the first Fiat aircraft engine was produced. Also around the same time, Fiat taxis became popular in Europe.

By 1910 Fiat was the largest automotive company in Italy – a position it has retained since. That same year, a new plant was built in Poughkeepsie, NY, by the newly founded American F.I.A.T. Automobile Company. Owning a Fiat at that time was a sign of distinction. The cost of a Fiat in the US was initially $4,000 and rose up to $6,400 in 1918, compared to $825 for a Ford Model T in 1908, and $525 in 1918, respectively. During World War I, Fiat had to devote all of its factories to supplying the Allies with aircraft, engines, machine guns, trucks, and ambulances. Upon the entry of the US into the war in 1917, the factory was shut down as US regulations became too burdensome. After the war, Fiat introduced its first tractor, the 702. By the early 1920s, Fiat had a market share in Italy of 80%.

In 1921 workers seized Fiat&#x27;s plants and hoisted the red flag of communism over them, to which Agnelli responded by quitting the company. However, the Italian Socialist Party and its ally organization, the Italian General Confederation of Labour, in an effort to effect a compromise with the centrist parties ordered the occupation to end. In 1922, Fiat began to build the famous Lingotto car factory—then the largest in Europe—which opened in 1923. It was the first Fiat factory to use assembly lines; by 1925, Fiat controlled 87% of the Italian car market. In 1928, with the 509, Fiat included insurance in the purchase price.

Fiat made military machinery and vehicles during World War II for the Italian army and &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot;, and later for the Germans. Fiat made fighter aircraft like the biplane CR.42 Falco, which was one of the most common Italian aircraft, along with Savoia-Marchettis, as well as light tanks, obsolete compared to their German and Soviet counterparts, and armoured vehicles. The best Fiat aircraft was the G.55 fighter, which arrived too late and in too limited numbers to impact the outcome of the war.

In 1945 the National Liberation Committee removed the Agnelli family from leadership roles in Fiat because of its ties to Mussolini&#x27;s government. These were not returned until 1963, when Giovanni&#x27;s grandson, Gianni, took over as general manager until 1966 and as chairman until 1996.

Fiat launched a nuclear research program in the 1950s. It was the first private company in Europe to host its own nuclear reactor.

===Gianni Agnelli===
Among the younger Agnelli&#x27;s first steps after gaining control of Fiat was a massive reorganization of the company management, which had previously been highly centralized, with little provision for the delegation of authority and decision-making. Such a system was effective in the past, but lacked the responsiveness and flexibility needed by Fiat&#x27;s steady expansion, and the growth of its international operations in the 1960s. The company was reorganized on a product-line basis, with two main product groups—one for passenger cars, the other for trucks and tractors—and a number of semi-independent division and subsidiaries. Top management, freed from responsibility for day-by-day operations of the company, was able to devote its efforts to more far-reaching goals. In 1967, Fiat made its first acquisition when it purchased Autobianchi; with sales amounting to $1.7 billion, it outstripped Volkswagen, its main European competitor, and in 1968 produced some 1,750,000 vehicles while its sales volume climbed to $2.1 billion. According to &quot;Newsweek&quot; in 1968, Fiat was &quot;the most dynamic automaker in Europe...[and] may come closest to challenging the worldwide supremacy of Detroit.&quot; Then, in 1969, it purchased controlling interests in Ferrari and Lancia. At the time, Fiat was a conglomerate, owning Alitalia, toll highways, a typewriter and office machine manufacturer, electronics and electrical equipment firms, a paint company, a civil engineering firm, and an international construction company. Following up on an agreement Valletta had made with Soviet officials in 1966, Agnelli constructed the AvtoVAZ plant in the new city of Togliattigrad on the Volga. This began operation in 1970, producing a local version of the Fiat 124 as the Lada. On his initiative, Fiat automobile and truck plants were also constructed in industrial centers of Yugoslavia, Poland, Bulgaria, and Romania. In 1973, Fiat established Comau, an industrial automation company out of the various suppliers which had equipped the AvtoVAZ plant in Russia. Comau became an industry pioneer in the use of Robotics for vehicle assembly – a technology with which Fiat would become synonymous for in the 1970s, with its &quot;Robogate&quot; system for bodyshell manufacture, and the later FIRE family of robot-assembled engines in the 1980s.

Despite offering a relatively competitive range of cars, Fiat was not immune from the financial pressures that the auto industry confronted following the 1973 oil price shock. Towards the end of 1976 it was announced that the Libyan government was to take a 9.6% shareholding in the company in return for a capital injection worth an equivalent of £250 million. The size of the Libyan investment is apparent when it is compared to the £310 million IMF loan that the Italian government was trying to negotiate at the time. Other aspects of the Libyan agreement included the construction of a truck and bus plant at Tripoli. Chairman Agnelli candidly described the deal as &quot;a classic petro-money recycling operation which will strengthen the Italian reserves, provide Fiat with fresh capital and give the group greater tranquility in which to carry out its investment programmes&quot;. Equally noteworthy was the fact that despite the dilutive effect of the Libyan investment on existing shareholders, the company&#x27;s largest shareholder, the Agnelli family, retained a 30% stake in the recapitalised business.

In 1979 the company became a holding company when it spun off its various businesses into autonomous companies, one of them being Fiat Auto S.p.A. Vittorio Ghidella was named CEO. That same year, sales reached an all-time high in the US, corresponding to the Iranian Oil Crisis. However, when gas prices fell again after 1981, Americans began purchasing sport utility vehicles, minivans, and pickup trucks in larger numbers (marking a departure from their past preference for large cars). Also, Japanese automakers had been taking an ever-larger share of the car market, increasing at more than half a percent a year. Consequently, in 1984, Fiat and Lancia withdrew from the United States market. In 1989, it did the same in the Australian market, although it remained in New Zealand.

In 1986 Fiat acquired Alfa Romeo from the Italian government. Also, in 1986 15% of Fiat company stock was still owned by Libya, an investment dating back to the mid-seventies. US foreign policy under President Reagan&#x27;s administration canceled a Pentagon contract to produce earth movers with Fiat and pressured the company into brokering a buyout of the Libyan investment. In 1992, two top corporate officials in the Fiat Group were arrested for political corruption.&lt;ref name=&quot;query.nytimes.com/gst&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, Fiat acquired Maserati. In 1995 Alfa Romeo exited the US market. Maserati re-entered the US market under Fiat in 2002. Since then, Maserati sales there have been increasing briskly.

===Paolo Fresco===
Paolo Fresco became chairman of Fiat in 1998 with the hope that the veteran of General Electric would bring more emphasis on shareholder value to Fiat. By the time he took power, Fiat&#x27;s market share in Italy had fallen to 41% from around 62% in 1984. However, a Jack Welch-like management style would be much harsher than that used by the Italians (e.g., precarious versus lifetime employment). Instead, Fresco focused on offering more incentives for good performance, including compensation using stock options for top and middle management.

But his efforts were frustrated by union objections. Unions insisted that pay raises be set by length of tenure, rather than performance. Another conflict was over his preference for informality (the founder, Giovanni Agnelli, used to be a cavalry officer). He often referred to other managers by their first name, although company tradition obliged one to refer to others using their titles (e.g., &quot;Chairman Fresco&quot;). The CEO of the company, Paolo Cantarella, ran the day-to-day affairs of the company, while Fresco determined company strategy and especially acted as a negotiator for the company. In 1999, Fiat formed CNH Global by merging New Holland NV and Case Corporation.

In 2003 Fiat shed its insurance sector, which it was operating through Toro Assicurazioni to the DeAgostini Group. In the same year, Fiat sold its aviation business, FiatAvio to Avio Holding. In February 2004, the company sold its interest in Fiat Engineering, as well as its stake in Edison.

===Sergio Marchionne===
Sergio Marchionne was appointed CEO of Fiat in 2004 and initially he impressed investors. At the end of the 2005 financial year, the company saw its first profit in 17 quarters of €196M for the first 9 months of FY2006.

Marchionne reduced Fiat&#x27;s managerial bureaucracy refocused the business on markets and profit. While chairman, Luca di Montezemolo, dealt with politicians and unions, Marchionne rebuilt the car business. The success of the Grande Punto model was in large part responsible for the turnaround in Fiat&#x27;s fortunes, but the award-winning 500 cemented it. Fiat formed a joint venture with India&#x27;s TATA Motors, which has subsequently ended, and with China&#x27;s Chery Motors which didn&#x27;t conclude. In 2005 Fiat courted Ford, and returned to China with a joint venture GAC Fiat created in 2010. Under Marchionne Fiat also re-entered several large markets that it had exited years before, such as Mexico and Australia.

&quot;Fiat Group Automobiles S.p.A.&quot; was created on 1 February 2007 from Fiat Auto S.p.A.

Simultaneously, the four divisions of Fiat Auto (Fiat, Alfa Romeo, Lancia and Fiat Veicoli Commerciali) were made into four Società per azioni, all controlled 100 percent by Fiat Group Automobiles. The former brand directors became CEOs of the new societies, while the employees and production facilities remained under Fiat Group Automobiles.

At the same time the Abarth brand was relaunched as &quot;Abarth &amp; C. S.p.A.&quot;, a fifth independent society again owned 100 percent by Fiat Group Automobiles.

In December 2008 Marchionne announced Fiat had to become one of the top five automakers to survive in the long run. Under Marchionne&#x27;s leadership, Fiat returned to Canadian and American markets with the new 500. However, since 2009, Marchionne has presided over a business that has experienced a loss in European market share from 9.3 to 6.2 percent. In December 2013, Marchionne announced that he intended to discontinue the Grande Punto so that the company could focus on &quot;cool, high margin&quot; Fiat 500 (2007) variants and the Fiat Panda.

In 2010 John Elkann became the Chairman of Fiat SpA and shareholders approved a plan to demerger Fiat&#x27;s capital goods businesses. Agricultural and construction equipment manufacturer CNH Global NV, truck maker Iveco, and the industrial and marine division of Fiat Powertrain Technologies were spun off into a new group on 1 January 2011. The parent company, Fiat Industrial S.p.A., was listed on the Milan stock exchange on 3 January 2011.

In 2010 credit rating agency Fitch cut Fiat&#x27;s debt rating to BB− after it had accumulated a debt of around . In 2013, Fiats debt rating was cut again, this time by Moody&#x27;s, to Ba3 over concerns European demand was lower and debt was falling slower than expected. The &quot;Financial Times&quot; estimate of Fiat&#x27;s debt at the time was almost .

=== Acquisition of Chrysler ===
On 20 January 2009 Fiat S.p.A. and Chrysler LLC announced their intention to form a global alliance. Under the terms of the agreement, Fiat would take a 20% stake in Chrysler and gain access to its North American distribution network in exchange for providing Chrysler with technology and platforms to build smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles in the US and providing reciprocal access to Fiat&#x27;s global distribution network.&lt;ref name=&quot;autonews.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;italiaspeed.com/2009&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Agreements were signed on 30 April 2009, with Fiat&#x27;s future shareholding capped at 49% until all government loans had been repaid.&lt;ref name=&quot;fiatgroup.com/en-us/mediacentre&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the proposed agreement would entitle Fiat to receive a further 15% (without cash consideration) through the achievement of specific product and commercial objectives. No cash or financial support was required from Fiat under the agreement. Instead it would obtain its stake mainly in exchange for covering the cost of retooling a Chrysler plant to produce one or more Fiat models for in the US. Fiat would also provide engine and transmission technology to enable Chrysler to introduce smaller, fuel-efficient models in the NAFTA market.
The deal was engineered by Fiat chief Sergio Marchionne. The principal objective of the partnership was to provide both groups with significantly enhanced economies of scale and geographical reach at a time when they were struggling to compete with larger and more global rivals such as Toyota, Volkswagen and alliance partners Renault S.A. and Nissan.

Fiat would not have to pay any money for its 20% of Chrysler. On 7 June 2009, the Indiana State Police Pension Fund, the Indiana Teacher&#x27;s Retirement Fund, and the state&#x27;s Major Moves Construction Fund asked the US Supreme Court to delay the sale of Chrysler to Fiat while they challenge the deal. The funds argued that the sale went against US bankruptcy law because it unlawfully rewarded unsecured creditors ahead of secured creditors. On 9 June 2009, the Supreme Court lifted the temporary hold, clearing the way for Fiat to acquire Chrysler.&lt;ref name=&quot;online.wsj.com/article&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; See Indiana State Police Pension Trust v. Chrysler for more information. On 10 June, the Supreme Court announced that Fiat was now an owner of the new Chrysler a.k.a. Chrysler Group LLC.

Marchionne was appointed CEO of Chrysler following its emergence from bankruptcy proceedings. Under his leadership, Chrysler has taken on a structure similar to that of Fiat and has released, in quick succession, a large number of completely redesigned or refreshed vehicles. Fiat launched its 500, which had been available in Europe since 2007, in the United States and Canada in 2011, marking the company&#x27;s return to the American auto market, which it had been absent from since 1984. Prior to this, Fiat&#x27;s main presence on the continent was Mexico, where it offers a greater variety of products than in the United States and Canada.

On 10 January 2011 Fiat announced that it had increased its share in Chrysler from 20% to 25% following the achievement of the first of three performance objectives. On 11 April 2011, it announced achievement of the second performance objective, increasing its stake a further 5% to 30%. On 24 May 2011, Fiat announced that it had paid Chrysler US$1,268 million for a further 16% interest, increasing its stake total stake to 46% (fully diluted). The transaction coincided with Chrysler refinancing its debt to the U.S. and Canadian governments. On 25 May autonews.com reported that Fiat could buy government stakes in Chrysler as soon as the end of July 2011, increasing its total stake to 54%.

In May 2011 it emerged that Fiat could actually increase its stake in Chrysler Group to more than 70 percent through the exercise of further options.

In a regulatory filing dated 22 July 2011, the Michigan-based automaker reported that Fiat held a 53.5% interest (fully diluted). Fiat and Chrysler have both stated that they expect that interest to reach 58.5% by the end of 2011 as result of achievement of the third of the three performance objectives. On 5 January 2012 Fiat released press info that the ownership has increased to 58.5%. The stake was further increased to 68.49% in July 2013. On 1 January 2014, Fiat announced it would be acquiring the remaining shares of Chrysler owned by the VEBA worth $3.65 billion. The deal was completed by 21 January.

On 29 January 2014 it was announced that Fiat S.p.A. would be merged into a new company, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, incorporated in the Netherlands with tax domicile in the UK. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles will become the owner of Fiat Group. On 1 August 2014, Fiat S.p.A. received necessary shareholder approval to proceed with the merger (which followed board approval). FCA will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange with an additional listing on the Mercato Telematico Azionario in Milan to follow.

===Alliances and joint ventures===
Fiat has undertaken numerous joint ventures and alliances. Commencing in 1978, the Type Four platform was an alliance between Alfa Romeo, Fiat, Lancia and Saab and resulting in a range of cars on sale in the mid-1980s.

In 2000 a number of joint ventures were established with General Motors following GM buying 20% of Fiat while Fiat bought 6% of GM. Complications with the relationship saw these JVs being wound back by 2005. Resulting projects included the GM Fiat Small platform and Fiat-GM Powertrain.

In 2005 Fiat formed an alliance with Ford to create a new small car, resulting in the Fiat 500 and Ford Ka.

In 2012 Fiat formed an alliance with Mazda to develop and build a new rear wheel drive roadster for the Alfa Romeo and Mazda brands.

Since 2007, Teksid S.p.A. runs also Teksid Aluminum S.r.l. a company specialized in casting and producing auto components from aluminium alloys.

===Production systems===
Production systems are made mainly through Comau S.p.A. (now Comau Systems), which bought the American Pico, Renault Automation and Sciaky and produces industrial automation systems. In the 1970s and 1980s, the company became a pioneer in the use of industrial robotics for the assembly of motor vehicles. Fiat assembly plants are among the best automated and advanced in the world.

===Services===
An insurance company, Toro Assicurazioni, allowed Fiat to control a relevant part of this market (also with minor companies like Lloyd Italico) and to interact with some associated banks. Toro Assicurazioni was acquired by the giant insurance company Assicurazioni Generali and is no longer part of the Fiat Group.

====Construction====
Ingest Facility and Fiat Engineering work in various fields of construction, while IPI is a mediation company that also deals with the management of real estate properties.

Fiat supports the &quot;Fondazione Giovanni Agnelli&quot;, an important foundation for social and economic research. Palazzo Grassi, a well-known historic building in Venice, now a museum and formerly supported by Fiat, was eventually sold to the French businessman François Pinault in January 2005.

====Aviation and motorcycles====

Fiat, as Fiat Aviazione, was an important aircraft manufacturer, focused mainly on military aviation. After World War I, Fiat consolidated several Italian small aircraft manufacturers, like Pomilio and Ansaldo. Most famous were Fiat biplane fighter aircraft of the 1930s, Fiat CR.32 and Fiat CR.42. Other notable designs were fighters CR.20, G.50, G.55 and a bomber, the Fiat BR.20. In the 1950s, the company designed the G.91 light ground attack plane. In 1969, Fiat Aviazione merged with Aerfer to create Aeritalia.

In 1959 Piaggio came under the control of the Agnelli family. In 1964, the aeronautical and motorcycle divisions split to become independent companies. The aeronautical division was named IAM Rinaldo Piaggio. Today the aeronautical company Piaggio Aero is controlled by the family of Piero Ferrari, which also holds 10% of the carmaker Ferrari.
The motorcycle division Vespa thrived until 1992, when Giovanni Alberto Agnelli became CEO—but Agnelli was already suffering from cancer, and died in 1997. In 1999, Morgan Grenfell Private Equity acquired Piaggio.

====Weapons====
Fiat built artillery tractors for the French and Italian armies in World War I.

&quot;Società Anonima Fabbrica Armi Torino&quot; (SAFAT) was a wholly owned subsidiary of FIAT in the 1930s, designing and manufacturing weapons for the Italian armed forces. After losing a competition to produce a series of new machine-guns for the Regia Aeronautica, SAFAT was sold to the winning competitor – Società Italiana Ernesto Breda, forming Breda-SAFAT.

====Rail transport====
Fiat Ferroviaria&#x27;s history goes back to before World War II, when Fiat provided motive power used for both Diesel and electric locomotives and railcars (&quot;littorine&quot;) not only in Italy, but other parts of Europe, and in South America. Fiat produced, among the rest, the successful Pendolino tilting trains, the first working prototype four-car set being run in the mid-1970s.

Fiat Ferroviaria was later sold to Alstom in 2000.

====Recreation====
The Fiat Group owned the Sestriere skiing facilities; the village in the Alps is a creation of the Agnelli family. The Sestriere skiing facilities were sold by the group in 2006.

==Enterprises outside Italy==
&quot;See list of Fiat Group assembly sites&quot;

Fiat was a key player in developing motor industries for a number of countries from the 1950s, particularly in Eastern Europe, Spain, Egypt, Ethiopia and Turkey. The AutoVAZ state works Lada products in Tolyatti (Togliatti), Russia, were Fiat based, as were SEAT products of Spain. Lada is now controlled by Renault, and SEAT by Volkswagen. A small number of Fiats were built in Bulgaria. Among Fiat&#x27;s earliest foreign assembly plants was one in Poughkeepsie, New York, between 1910 and 1917.

===United States===

The American F.I.A.T. Automobile Company was founded by American licensees in 1909 as a response to 45 percent tariffs on imported automobiles. The plant was finished in the spring of 1910 and the first car rolled off the production line in September 1910; all Poughkeepsie Fiats were built with parts shipped from Italy although they usually received locally made bodywork by companies like Holbrook, Quinby, or Fleetwood. American F.I.A.T. focused on the larger and more luxurious end of the range, with the smaller Types 51 and 52 (&quot;Tipo&quot; 1 and 2) only available to order as fully built-up imports.

The first model offered was the Type 54, corresponding to the European &quot;Tipo 4.&quot; This has a four-cylinder engine (itself called &quot;Tipo 54A&quot;) and rode on a wheelbase; it was manufactured until 1914 or 1915. This was joined by the large and expensive Type 56 in 1912, a seven-passenger touring car reserved for the American market. This model has a six-cylinder version of the Type 54 engine, displacing and mounted in a chassis with a wheelbase. In 1913 the Type 55 arrived (although some Type 55s appear to have been sold in 1912), slightly shorter than the Type 56 with a wheelbase but with a massive four-cylinder engine. This car was largely identical to the European &quot;Tipo 5&quot; and was also manufactured for export. In 1914 the fourth and final American Fiat was introduced, the smaller Type 53 – the equivalent of the Italian &quot;Tipo 3 Ter.&quot; This has a four-cylinder engine and a wheelbase. The Tipo 53 was built until 1916, while the 55 and 56 were manufactured until 1917, although late 55s seem to have been sold as &quot;1918s&quot; and they did appear in new-car catalogues that year. Fiat Italy took over the American operation in 1917 and reduced the lineup to the Type 55, now sitting on a wheelbase. NACC tax horsepower figures were 30 hp for the Type 54, 45 for the Type 56, 42 for the Type 55, and 25 hp for the Type 53. Actual outputs were higher, ranging from for the Type 53 to for the big Types 55 and 56.

Output was never very large, Fiats being very expensive cars at the time, with annual production averaging around 350 cars. Once the United States entered the war, no more car parts were arriving from Italy and production was halted. There were plans for restarting production after the war but they came to naught and the plant was sold to Duesenberg in February 1918. Duesenberg proceeded to transfer the machinery to their plant in Elizabeth, NJ, to build aircraft engines. At the beginning of 1928 the facilities changed hands again, now belonging to truck manufacturers Larrabee Motor Truck Co. who transferred their activities there from Binghamton. The building went on to serve various functions, being part of the Marist College campus for a while, and was torn down in 1997.

===Fiat Automóveis (Brazil)===
Fiat Automóveis S.A., a subsidiary of Fiat S.p.A., began making automobiles in Brazil in 1976 beginning with the production of the Fiat 147, the Brazilian version of the Italian Fiat 127, produced until 1986. More than 10,000,000 units have been produced in Fiat Automóveis factory in Betim since 1976, plus 232,807 units in the Fiat Argentina plant of Córdoba. The original factory, located in the city of Belo Horizonte, cost $250 million to build. The state of Minas Gerais had a 10–20% stake in the company and also provided special economic benefits to Fiat.

Launched in July 1979, the 147 was the first mass-produced car that ran on ethanol as fuel instead of petrol. The performance slightly increased and fuel consumption was 30% higher but the cost of the alcohol was a quarter of the gasoline because, at that time, petrol had become expensive as a consequence of the 1979 oil crisis. This version was nicknamed &quot;cachacinha&quot; (little cachaça) because it had the scent of that Brazilian drink.

In October 1984 Fiat Automóveis introduced the Fiat Uno, which continued on sale until the end of 2013 as the renamed Fiat Mille, resulting in total production of 3.6 million vehicles. Production of the Fiat Palio world car began in 1996.

After the successful 2003 introduction of flexible-fuel vehicles in the Brazilian market, Fiat Automóveis launched its first flex model in March 2004, the Fiat Palio, followed by the Siena and Palio Weekend. Fiat sold 665,514 vehicles in Brazil in 2008, allowing the carmaker to continue as the market leader for seven years in a row. Flex fuel automobiles represented almost 100 percent of the car sales in 2008, and 92 percent of all light-duty trucks sold.

In 2006 Fiat introduced the Fiat Siena Tetra fuel, a four-fuel car developed under Magneti Marelli of Fiat Brazil. This automobile can run as a flex-fuel on 100% ethanol (E100); or on E20-E25 blend, Brazil&#x27;s normal ethanol gasoline blend; on pure gasoline (though no longer available in Brazil since 1993, it is still used in neighboring countries); or just on natural gas (CNG). The Siena Tetrafuel was engineered to switch from any gasoline-ethanol blend to CNG automatically, depending on the power required by road conditions.

===Fiat Argentina===
Fiat has been present in Argentina since the beginning of the 20th century. There was a Fiat manufacturing plant in Córdoba at least as far back as 1954 when Fiat entered into a joint venture with two local companies to manufacture tractors. The company was known as Fiat-Concord until 1980. In 1959 the construction of a car plant in Caseros was approved, and 1960 saw the production there of the first Argentinian produced Fiat passenger car, a Fiat 600, after the Fiat 1100 Export and after in 1963 the Fiat 1500. In 1977 appears the Fiat 133, just a rebadged Seat 133 but made in Argentina. By 1978 a car manufacturing facility was well established in Córdoba, producing Fiat 128s as well as two models which from the Italian perspective belonged in earlier decades, the 125 (with some derivates) and the 600R.

In 1980 a joint venture with PSA called Sevel Argentina was begun, which lasted until 1995. The current day automobile manufacturing started with a new factory opened in Córdoba on 20 December 1996. From April 1997 the Siena and Palio models production started.

Production was suspended in the early 2000s as the Argentinean economy went downhill. In 2008 Fiat invested new money and the production of Fiat Siena saloon and the Fiat Palio was started. In October 2009, a Fiat Siena HLX becomes the 2 million unit produced by Fiat in Argentina. The Fiat Auto Argentina S.A. is Fiat S.p.A. owned company.&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters.com/article&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fiat Automobili Srbija===
Its first enterprise came in 1955, when it agreed to a deal with Yugoslav carmaker Zastava to assemble Fiats for Eastern Europe. The first cars produced by Zastava were its versions of the Fiat 1300 and Fiat 1400. By 1970, Zastava was producing parts for the newer Fiat 124 and Fiat 125 models, which were assembled in Poland. The Zastava 750, launched in 1962, was Zastava&#x27;s version of the iconic Fiat 600 minicar. It outlived the car on which it was based, with production lasting until 1981. Zastavas were not popular outside of Eastern Europe before the 1980s, although they were exported to the US and several European countries under the Yugo brand during the 1980s.

The most famous product launched by Zastava is the Zastava 101, a front-wheel drive car based on the Fiat 128, also available as a hatchback version never sold in Italy. With the demise of the Zastava 750 in 1981, the minicar gap in the Zastava range was filled by the Zastava Koral, which was best known in Britain and America as the Yugo Tempo or Yugo 45/55. It was based on the 1971 Fiat 127, which was due to be replaced by the Fiat Uno in 1983. Hostility towards Yugoslavia in the wake of the 1992 civil unrest saw a swift ending of imports to both Britain and America. The Zastava factory in Kragujevac was later bombed, but was rebuilt after the war ended, and production continued at another factory in Kragujevac.

In 1987 Zastava came up with a new car design. The Zastava Florida — also known as a Yugo, and in other markets as the Yugo Sana – was styled by Giorgetto Giugiaro at the ItalDesign studio, later featured a range of more modern Peugeot engines. Sales continued in its homeland, with an update at the end of the 1990s. Zastava did not launch another new car for another 16 years. The 2003 Zastava 10 model was another Fiat design—this time the second generation Punto, and in 2009 was renamed Fiat Punto Classic

A new memorandum of understanding between Fiat and the Serb ministry of economic and regional development about the acquisition of Zastava&#x27;s Kragujevac plant in 2008 led to a new company being set up in which the Italians would have a 70 percent stake and the Serb government 30 percent.&lt;ref name=&quot;forbes.com/feeds&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The factory was renamed from &quot;Zastava Automobili Srbija&quot; to &quot;Fiat Automobili Srbija&quot;. In 2010 and 2011, FAS (Fiat Automobili Srbija) underwent large-scale reconstruction for production of the Fiat 500L in 2012.

===Polski Fiat/FSO (Poland)===
Fiat automobiles have been made in Poland since 1920. In 1932, the Polskie Zakłady Inżynieryjne (Polish Engineering Works, PZInż) started the production of Fiat 508, produced until 1939 also as a military vehicle. In 1936 the licence was extended to include the Fiat 518 model. In 1965, the Polish communist government signed a deal with Fiat to produce selected Fiat models in Poland at the FSO factory in Warsaw that had been built in 1951. Production of the new car—the Polski Fiat 125p—began in 1967. It was visually identical to the Fiat 125, but it made use of older Fiat mechanicals which dated back to 1960. The car sold well in its homeland and was soon exported to Western Europe. 1978 saw the appearance of a new five-door hatchback, the FSO Polonez, that made use of Fiat 125p running gear. After 1982, Fiat withdrew its licence; since then FSO badge was reinstated with the Polski Fiat 125p surviving until 1991, and the Polonez production ending in 2002. FSO was taken over by Daewoo of South Korea in 1995, and become independent again in late 2000, after Daewoo went bankrupt and was taken over by General Motors.

Fabryka Samochodów Małolitrażowych (FSM) in Bielsko-Biała and Tychy was a joint venture between FSO and Fiat, and manufactured the Fiat 126(p) in 1973 and the Cinquecento in 1991. In 1992 Fiat owned 90% of FSM (called Fiat Auto Poland, since 1993) and since then it produced Cinquecento, Uno, Seicento, Siena and Palio Weekend models with the capacity up to 200.000 cars a year. In 2003, FSM become the sole producer of Fiat Panda, and in 2007, the Fiat 500 and the related Ford Ka. Capacity was increased with production reaching over 600,000 in 2009, but dropped below 300,000 in 2013, resulting in the workforce being cut by a third.

===AutoVAZ Lada (Russia)===
In 1966 Fiat helped USSR state industries build a new car factory (AvtoVAZ) on the Volga river. A planned city called Tolyatti (named after Palmiro Togliatti, former Italian Communist Party Secretary) was developed around the factory, which started producing a &quot;people&#x27;s car&quot; similar to the Volkswagen Beetle and Citroën 2CV of Germany and France. The new Soviet car, called the Lada, was a more spacious offering, in four-door saloon and five-door estate variants. Fiat installed British machine tools supplied by Herbert-BSA of Birmingham for the manufacture of many Lada parts. The 124&#x27;s design was mechanically upgraded to survive treacherous Russian driving conditions and extremely cold winters. Imports to Western Europe, Canada, and some third world countries sold well owing to their low price. This car was upgraded to become the Lada Riva (marketing name in some markets) in 1980. Lada has gone on to develop some of its own models. The four-wheel drive Lada Niva uses some Fiat based components, e.g. engine and gearbox, but the body and four-wheel drive system are VAZ designs.

===Bulgaria===
1967–1971 produced Pirin-Fiat in Lovech, Bulgaria.

===Tofaş (Turkey)===
Tofaş is joint venture owned by Fiat SpA and Koç Holding (37.8% Fiat Group Automobiles, 37.8% Koc and 24.3% others). The Fiat 124 was produced under licence by Tofaş as the Tofaş Murat. This was replaced by a version of the Fiat 131, known as the Tofaş Şahin. Today the Fiat Linea car is among those manufactured by the Fiat-Tofas joint venture in Turkey, and the company has 12.1% of the Turkish car market as of 2007.

===SEAT (Spain)===
In Spain, SEAT—Sociedad Española de Automóviles de Turismo (Spanish Touring Car Company)—was established with Fiat assistance in 1950, producing Fiat models under its own brand name until 1981, when Fiat withdrew its support. In 1982 SEAT signed a cooperation agreement with the German manufacturer Volkswagen and by the end of 1986 after a purchase of a majority stake SEAT had become part of the Volkswagen Group. However, production of some Fiat-based models continued, ending with the Fiat-based Marbella in 1998.

===Ethiopia===
The Fiat 131, known as the Holland Car DOCC.

===Egypt===
Following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, President Gamal Abdel Nasser ordered the EGID (General Intelligence Agent) to establish a state owned automobile company. Nasr was founded in 1960 in Helwan, Egypt. It began producing some Fiat based models, but later produced the Tofaş Şahin under license by Tofaş. The last Fiat 128 model was built in 2008, while the Şahin is still in production in Egypt.

Currently the &quot;El-Mashreq Company&quot;, a part of the Seoudi Group is the main manufacturer of Alfa Romeo and Fiat vehicles for the Egyptian market. Arab American Vehicles (AAV) also manufactured Fiats in Egypt. They assembled the Fiat Ritmo at the behest of Nasr.

===India===
Fiat India Automobiles Private Limited (FIAPL) is a joint venture between Fiat and Mumbai based Tata Motors, founded in 1997. Fiat builds the Palio Stile, Linea and Punto. The Fiat plant is situated in Ranjangaon near Pune in Maharashtra and also manufactures the Tata Indica.

Although not a subsidiary of Fiat, Premier Automobiles Limited (PAL) of Mumbai was licensed to manufacture versions of the Fiat 500 for the Indian market. This was followed by the Fiat 1100 in 1954. In 1973, the Fiat label was replaced with the Premier name. Premier built the Fiat 1100 and 124 into the 21st century; after a brief attempt at building the Uno in the early years of the 21st century, the companies severed their ties.

===Pakistan===
Raja Motors are the authorized manufacturers of Fiat motor vehicles in Pakistan since 1948. The manufacturing started with VESPA scooters in 1948. The project was expanded in 2001 to facilitate assembly-cum-manufacturing of the Fiat Uno. The production facility is located in Landhi Industrial Area, Karachi, Pakistan.

===Sri Lanka===
In 1973 entrepreneur Upali Wijewardena&#x27;s Upali Motor Company began assembly of the local variant of Fiat 128, known as UMC-Fiat 128. Production ended with the introduction of the open-market economy in 1978.

===North Korea===
The North Korean car manufacturer and dealer Pyeonghwa Motors assembles two Fiat models under licence since 2002: Hwiparam (whistle)—based on the Fiat Siena, Bbeokgugi (owl)—based on the Fiat Doblò.

===China===
Fiat entered into a 50:50 joint venture with GAC Group in 2010 to create GAC Fiat Automobiles Co, with a factory in Changsha completed in 2012 producing a localised version of the Dodge Dart sold as the Fiat Viaggio.

<text>Year 210 ([[Roman numerals|CCX]]) was a common year starting on Monday of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of [[Faustinus]] and [[Rufinus (consul)|Rufinus]] (or, less frequently, year 963 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 210 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

<text>The Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA; , UÇK) was an ethnic Albanian separatist militia that sought the separation of Kosovo, the vast majority of which is inhabited by Albanians, from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) and Serbia during the 1990s. Albanian nationalism was a central tenet of the KLA and many in its ranks supported the creation of a Greater Albania, which would encompass all Albanians in the Balkans, stressing Albanian culture, ethnicity and nation.

Military precursors to the KLA began in the late 1980s with armed resistance to Yugoslav police trying to take Albanian activists in custody. By the early 1990s there were attacks on police forces and secret-service officials who abused Albanian civilians. By mid-1998 the KLA was involved in frontal battle though it was outnumbered and outgunned. Conflict escalated from 1997 onward due to the Yugoslav army retaliating with a crackdown in the region which resulted in population displacements. The bloodshed, ethnic cleansing of thousands of Albanians driving them into neighbouring countries and the potential of it to destabilize the region provoked intervention by international organizations, such as the United Nations, NATO and INGOs. NATO conducted a bombing campaign against Yugoslav forces and provided air support to KLA.

In September 1999, with the fighting over and an international force in place within Kosovo, the KLA was officially disbanded and thousands of its members entered the Kosovo Protection Corps, a civilian emergency protection body that replaced the KLA and Kosovo Police Force, as foreseen in United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244. The ending of the Kosovo war resulted in the emergence of offshoot guerrilla groups and political organisations from the KLA continuing violent struggles in southern Serbia (1999–2001) and northwestern Macedonia (2001), which resulted in peace talks and greater Albanian rights. Former KLA leaders also entered politics, some of them reaching high-ranking offices.

The KLA received large funds from Albanian diaspora organizations. There have been allegations that it used narcoterrorism to finance its operations. Abuses and war crimes were committed by the KLA during and after the conflict, such as massacres of civilians, prison camps and destruction of cultural heritage sites. In April 2014, the Assembly of Kosovo considered and approved the establishment of a special court to try cases involving crimes and other serious abuses allegedly committed in 1999–2000 by members of the KLA. In June 2020 the Kosovo Specialist Chambers and Specialist Prosecutor&#x27;s Office filed indictments for crimes against humanity and war crimes against a number of former KLA members, including the former president of Kosovo Hashim Thaçi.

==Background==

A key precursor to the Kosovo Liberation Army was the People&#x27;s Movement of Kosovo (LPK). This group, who argued Kosovo&#x27;s freedom could be won only through armed struggle, traces back to 1982, and played a crucial role in the creation of the KLA in 1993. Fund-raising began in the 1980s in Switzerland by Albanian exiles of the violence of 1981 and subsequent émigrés. Slobodan Milošević revoked Kosovan autonomy in 1989, returning the region to its 1945 status, ejecting ethnic Albanians from the Kosovan bureaucracy and violently putting down protests. In response, Kosovar Albanians established the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK). Headed by Ibrahim Rugova, its goal was independence from Serbia, but via peaceful means. To this end, the LDK set up and developed a &quot;parallel state&quot; with a particular focus on education and healthcare. 

Albanian nationalism was a central tenet of the KLA and many in its ranks supported the creation of a Greater Albania, which would encompass all Albanians in the Balkans, stressing Albanian culture, ethnicity and nation. It was considered a terrorist group until the breakup of Yugoslavia. The KLA itself disavowed the creation of a &#x27;Greater Albania&#x27;. The KLA made their name known publicly for the first time in 1995, and a first public appearance followed in 1997, at which time its membership was still only around 200. Critical of the progress made by Rugova, the KLA received boosts from the 1995 Dayton Accords— these granted Kosovo nothing, and so generated a more widespread rejection of the LDK&#x27;s peaceful methods — and from looted weaponry that spilled into Kosovo after the Albanian rebellion of 1997. During 1997–98, the Kosovo Liberation Army moved ahead of Rugova&#x27;s LDK, a fact starkly illustrated by the KLA&#x27;s Hashim Thaçi leading the Kosovar Albanians at the Rambouillet negotiations of spring 1999, with Rugova as his deputy.

In February 1996, the KLA undertook a series of attacks against police stations and Yugoslav government officers, saying that they had killed Albanian civilians as part of an ethnic cleansing campaign. Later that year, the British weekly &quot;The European&quot; carried an article by a French expert stating that &quot;German civil and military intelligence services have been involved in training and equipping the rebels with the aim of cementing German influence in the Balkan area. (...) The birth of the KLA in 1996 coincided with the appointment of Hansjoerg Geiger as the new head of the BND (German secret Service). (...) The BND men were in charge of selecting recruits for the KLA command structure from the 500,000 Kosovars in Albania.&quot; Matthias Küntzel tried to prove later on that German secret diplomacy had been instrumental in helping the KLA since its creation.

Serbian authorities denounced the KLA as a terrorist organisation and increased the number of security forces in the region. This had the effect of boosting the credibility of the embryonic KLA among the Kosovar Albanian population. Not long before NATO&#x27;s military action commenced, the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants reported that &quot;Kosovo Liberation Army ... attacks aimed at trying to &#x27;cleanse&#x27; Kosovo of its ethnic Serb population.&quot;

One of the goals mentioned by the KLA commanders was the formation of Greater Albania, irredentist concept of lands that are considered to form the national homeland by many Albanians, encompassing Kosovo, Albania, and the ethnic Albanian minority of neighbouring Macedonia and Montenegro.

==Kosovo War==
Between 5 and 7 March 1998, the Yugoslav Army launched an operation on Prekaz. The operation followed an earlier firefight (28 February) in which four policemen were killed and several more were wounded; Adem Jashari, a KLA leader, escaped. In Prekaz, 28 militants were killed, along with 30 civilians, most belonging to Jashari&#x27;s family. Amnesty International claimed that it was a military operation focused primarily on the elimination of Jashari and his family.

On 23 April 1998, the Yugoslav Army (VJ) ambushed the KLA near the Albanian-Yugoslav border. The KLA had tried to smuggle arms and supplies into Kosovo. The Yugoslav Army, although greatly outnumbered, had no casualties, while 19 militants were killed.

According to Roland Keith, a field office director of the OSCE&#x27;s Kosovo Verification Mission:

Upon my arrival the war increasingly evolved into a mid intensity conflict as ambushes, the encroachment of critical lines of communication and the [KLA] kidnapping of security forces resulted in a significant increase in government casualties which in turn led to major Yugoslavian reprisal security operations... By the beginning of March these terror and counter-terror operations led to the inhabitants of numerous villages fleeing, or being dispersed to either other villages, cities or the hills to seek refuge... The situation was clearly that KLA provocations, as personally witnessed in ambushes of security patrols which inflicted fatal and other casualties, were clear violations of the previous October&#x27;s agreement [and United Nations Security Council Resolution 1199].

At one point during the Kosovo War, the KLA changed their tactics from hit and run operations to conventional warfare. In July 1998, the KLA captured the cities of Rahovec and Malisheva and expanded their occupation of territory to 40% of Kosovo. However, without enough manpower and heavy weaponry to defend their gains, both cities quickly fell to Yugoslav forces. Their occupation of Rahovec was marred by acts of atrocities committed against Serbian civilians. On 24 August 1998, the KLA reverted to guerrilla warfare and employed new tactics including the appointment of new commanders, central authorities, expanded training camps and military prisons.

Some sources say that the KLA never won a battle, while others say it won relatively few battles.

==Funding==
The KLA received large funds from the Albanian diaspora in Europe and the United States, but also from Albanian businessmen in Kosovo. It is estimated that those funds amounted from $75 million to $100 million and mainly came from the Albanian diaspora in Switzerland, United States and Germany. The KLA received the majority of its funds through the Homeland Calls Fund, but significant funds were also transferred directly to the war zones. Apart from the financial contributions, the KLA also received contributions in kind, especially from the United States and Switzerland. These included weapons, but also military fatigues, boots and other supporting equipment.

According to the Stockholm International peace research institute: In 1999, the KLA&#x27;s source of arms were Switzerland, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Albania, and United States with non-state armament through the Albanian diaspora, whereas the Armed Forces of Serbia and Montenegro were funded by Israel. The weaponry received through Albania were often cheap and faulty often so bad that KLA smugglers could buy a Kalashnikov for as little as $5.

The KLA received its funding in multiple decentralized ways. Apart from the Homeland Calls Fund, which mostly went to KLA operations in the Drenica region, the KLA also received donations through personal contacts of commanders with Albanians in the diaspora. Members of the diaspora usually stressed the difficulties through which KLA&#x27;s soldiers were going through to fight an uneven battle. They often used stories of KLA members or civilian survivors of massacres to convince others to donate. After collection, the money was then transferred to its destination in different ways. The secrecy of the Swiss banking system allowed some of the funding to be transferred directly to the locations where military equipment would be purchased. From the United States, most of the money was legally carried by individuals in suitcases, who reported to the FBI and other federal authorities that they were sending money to the KLA. The KLA also received some funding from the Three-Percent Fund, which was set up by the institutions of Republic of Kosova led by Bujar Bukoshi and was also collected from the Albanian diaspora.

According to some sources, the KLA may have received funds from individuals involved in drug trade. However insufficient evidence exists that the KLA itself was involved in such activities. For example, Swiss citizens believe that elements of the Albanian community in Switzerland control narcotics trade in Switzerland. Some of the money earned through these illegal activities may have gone to the KLA through contributions to the Homeland Calls Fund or through the usual funding channels in which individuals and businessmen engaged in legitimate economic activities donated. This however is insufficient evidence to claim that the KLA itself got involved in narcotics trade or other criminal activities.

In a hearing before the United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism and Homeland Security, Ralf Mutschke from the Interpol General Secretariat claimed that half of the funding that had reached the KLA, which he estimated to have been 900 million DM in total, may have come from drug trafficking. Mother Jones obtained a congressional briefing paper for the U.S. Congress, which stated: &quot;We would be remiss to dismiss allegations that between 30 and 50 percent of the KLA&#x27;s money comes from drugs.&quot; Furthermore, journalist Peter Klebnikov added that after the NATO bombing, KLA-linked heroin traffickers began using Kosovo again as a major supply route. Citing German Federal Police, he said that in 2000, an estimated 80% of Europe&#x27;s heroin supply was controlled by Kosovar Albanians. According to scholars Gary Dempsey and Roger Fontaine, by 1999, Western intelligence agencies estimated that over $250m of narcotics money had found its way into KLA coffers. Scholar Henry Perritt, who studied the KLA, argues that &quot;[a]ll available evidence refutes the proposition aggressively advanced by the Milosevic regime that the KLA was mainly financed by drug and prostitution money.&quot;

==Recruitment==

=== In Kosovo ===

The original core of KLA in the early 1990s was a closely knitted group of commanders consisting of commissioned and non commissioned officers belonging to reserve, regular and territorial defense units of the Yugoslav army (JNA). In 1996, the KLA consisted of only a few hundred fighters. Within the context of the armed struggle, in 1996-1997 a report by the CIA noted that the KLA could mobilize tens of thousands of supporters in Kosovo within a two to three year time frame. By the end of 1998, the KLA had 17,000 men. While religion was not an explicit ideology of the KLA, it was practically fully made up of muslim-Albanians. 

===Foreign volunteers===
Albanian recruits from neighbouring Macedonia joined the KLA and their numbers ranged from several dozen into the thousands. Following the war some Albanians from Macedonia have felt that their military participation and assistance to fellow Kosovan Albanians during the conflict has not been properly recognised in Kosovo.

Former KLA spokesman Jakup Krasniqi said that volunteers came from &quot;Sweden, Belgium, the UK, Germany and the U.S.&quot;. The KLA included many foreign volunteers from West Europe, mostly from Germany and Switzerland, and also ethnic Albanians from the U.S.

According to the Serbian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, by September 1998 there were foreign mercenaries from Albania, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Afghanistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina (Muslims) and Chechnya in the KLA ranks. Citing a 2003 report by the Serbian government, academics Lyubov Mincheva and Ted Gurr claim that the Abu Bekir Sidik mujahideen unit of 115 members operated in Drenica in May–June 1998, and dozen of its members were Saudis and Egyptians, reportedly funded by Islamist organizations. They further claim that the group was later disbanded, and no permanent Jihadist presence was established.The failure of Islamists groups to gain a foothold with the ranks of the separatist movement is related to the secular foundation of Albanian nationalism and the heavily secular attitudes of Kosovo Albanians which did not leave room for the development of Islamist ideologies.

During the Kosovo conflict Milošević and his supporters portrayed the KLA as a terrorist organisation of militant Islam. The CIA advised the KLA to avoid involvement with Muslim extremists. The KLA rejected offers of assistance from Muslim fundamentalists. There was an understanding within the ranks of the KLA that foreign assistance from Muslim fundamentalists would limit support toward the cause of Kosovo Albanians in the West.

==Aftermath (post-1999)==
After the war, the KLA was transformed into the Kosovo Protection Corps, which worked alongside NATO forces patrolling the province. In 2000 there was unrest in Mitrovica, with a Yugoslav police officer and physician killed, and three officers and a physician wounded, in February. In March, the FRY complained about the escalation of violence in the region, claiming this showed that the KLA was still active. Between April and September the FRY issued several documents to the UN Security Council about violence against Serbs and other non-Albanians.

Some people from non-Albanian communities such as the Serbs and Romani fled Kosovo, some fearing revenge attacks by armed people and returning refugees and others were pressured by the KLA and armed gangs to leave. The Yugoslav Red Cross had estimated a total of 30,000 refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) from Kosovo, most of whom were Serb. The UNHCR estimated the figure at 55,000 refugees who had fled to Montenegro and Central Serbia, most of whom were Kosovo Serbs: &quot;Over 90 mixed villages in Kosovo have now been emptied of Serb inhabitants and other Serbs continue leaving, either to be displaced in other parts of Kosovo or fleeing into central Serbia.&quot;

In post war Kosovo, KLA fighters have been venerated by Kosovar Albanian society with the publishing of literature such as biographies, the erection of monuments and commemorative events. The exploits of Adem Jashari have been celebrated and turned into legend by former KLA members and by Kosovar Albanian society. Several songs, literature works, monuments, memorials have been dedicated to him, and some streets and buildings bear his name across Kosovo.

===Insurgency in south Serbia and Macedonia===
After the end of the Kosovo War in 1999 with the signing of the Kumanovo agreement, a 5-kilometre-wide Ground Safety Zone (GSZ) was created. It served as a buffer zone between the Yugoslav Army and the Kosovo Force (KFOR). In June 1999, a new Albanian militant insurgent group was formed under the Liberation Army of Preševo, Medveđa and Bujanovac (UÇPMB), which started training in the GSZ. The group began attacking Serbian civilians and police, which escalated into an insurgency.

With the signing of the Končulj Agreement in May 2001, the former KLA and UÇPMB fighters next moved to western Macedonia where the National Liberation Army (NLA) was established, which fought against the Macedonian government in 2001. Ali Ahmeti organized the NLA from former KLA and UÇPMB fighters from Kosovo, Albanian insurgents from the Liberation Army of Preševo, Medveđa and Bujanovac in Serbia, young Albanian radicals, nationalists from Macedonia, and foreign mercenaries. The acronym was the same as the KLA&#x27;s in Albanian.

===KLA veterans in politics===
A number of KLA figures now play a major role in Kosovar politics.
*Hashim Thaçi, the political head of the KLA, is leader of the Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) and served a term as prime minister from January 2008. In 2011, he was identified in leaked Western military intelligence reports as a &quot;big fish&quot; in Kosovan organized crime. He was President of Kosovo since 7 April 2016 until his resignation on 5 November 2020. On 24 June 2020 the Kosovo Specialist Chambers and Specialist Prosecutor&#x27;s Office filed a ten-count Indictment, charging Hashim Thaçi and others for crimes against humanity and war crimes.
*Agim Çeku, the KLA&#x27;s military chief, became Prime Minister of Kosovo after the war. The move caused some controversy in Serbia, as Belgrade regarded him as a war criminal, though he was never indicted by the Hague tribunal.
*Ramush Haradinaj, a KLA commander, is the founder and currently the leader of Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK) and served briefly as Prime Minister of Kosovo before he turned himself into the ICTY at The Hague to stand trial on war crimes charges. He was later acquitted. From 2017 to 2020 he was again Prime Minister of Kosovo.
*Fatmir Limaj, a senior commander of the KLA, is now the leader of the Initiative for Kosovo (NISMA). He was also tried at The Hague, and was acquitted of all charges in November 2005.

===Indictments===
Hajredin Bala, an ex-KLA prison guard, was sentenced on 30 November 2005 to 13 years&#x27; imprisonment for the mistreatment of three prisoners at the Llapushnik prison camp, his personal role in the &quot;maintenance and enforcement of the inhumane conditions&quot; of the camp, aiding the torture of one prisoner, and of participating in the murder of nine prisoners from the camp who were marched to the Berisha Mountains on 25 or 26 July 1998 and killed. Bala appealed the sentence and the appeal is still pending.

==Foreign support==
The United States (and NATO) directly supported the KLA. The CIA funded, trained and supplied the KLA (as they had earlier the Bosnian Army). As disclosed to &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; by CIA sources, &quot;American intelligence agents have admitted they helped to train the Kosovo Liberation Army before NATO&#x27;s bombing of Yugoslavia&quot;.

James Bissett, Canadian Ambassador to Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and Albania, wrote in 2001 on the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; that media reports indicate that &quot;as early as 1998, the Central Intelligence Agency assisted by the British Special Air Service were arming and training Kosovo Liberation Army members in Albania to foment armed rebellion in Kosovo. (...) The hope was that with Kosovo in flames NATO could intervene ...&quot;. According to Tim Judah, KLA representatives had already met with American, British, and Swiss intelligence agencies in 1996, and possibly &quot;several years earlier&quot;.

American Republican Congressman Dana Rohrabacher, while opposed to American ground troops in Kosovo, advocated for America providing support to the KLA to help them gain their freedom. He was honored by the Albanian American Civic League at a New Jersey located fundraising event on 23 July 2001. President of the League, Joseph J. DioGuardi, praised Rohrabacher for his support to the KLA, saying &quot;He was the first member of Congress to insist that the United States arm the Kosovo Liberation Army, and one of the few members who to this day publicly supports the independence of Kosovo.&quot; Rohrabacher gave a speech in support of American equipping the KLA with weaponry, comparing it to French support of America in the Revolutionary War.

==War crimes ==


There have been reports of war crimes committed by the KLA both during and after the conflict. These have been directed against Serbs, other ethnic minorities (primarily the Roma) and against ethnic Albanians accused of collaborating with Serb authorities. According to a 2001 report by Human Rights Watch (HRW):

The KLA was responsible for serious abuses... including abductions and murders of Serbs and ethnic Albanians considered collaborators with the state.

Elements of the KLA are also responsible for post-conflict attacks on Serbs, Roma, and other non-Albanians, as well as ethnic Albanian political rivals... widespread and systematic burning and looting of homes belonging to Serbs, Roma, and other minorities and the destruction of Orthodox churches and monasteries... combined with harassment and intimidation designed to force people from their homes and communities... elements of the KLA are clearly responsible for many of these crimes.

The KLA engaged in tit-for-tat attacks against Serbs in Kosovo, reprisals against ethnic Albanians who &quot;collaborated&quot; with the Serbian government, and bombed police stations and cafes known to be frequented by Serb officials, killing innocent civilians in the process. Most of its activities were funded by drug running, though its ties to community groups and Albanian exiles gave it local popularity.

The Panda Bar incident, a massacre of Serb teenagers in a café, led to an immediate crackdown on the Albanian-populated southern quarters of Peć during which Serbian police killed two Albanians. This has been alleged by the Serbian newspaper &quot;Kurir&quot; to have been organized by the Serbian government, while Aleksandar Vučić has stated that there is no evidence that the murder was committed by Albanians, as previously believed. The Serbian Organised Crime Prosecutor&#x27;s Office launched a new investigation in 2016 and reached the conclusion that the massacre was not perpetrated by Albanians. Many years after the incident, the Serbian government has officially acknowledged that it was perpetrated by agents of the Serbian Secret Service.

The exact number of victims of the KLA is not known. According to a Serbian government report, the KLA had killed and kidnapped 3,276 people of various ethnic descriptions including some Albanians. From 1 January 1998 to 10 June 1999 the KLA killed 988 people and kidnapped 287; in the period from 10 June 1999 to 11 November 2001, when NATO took control in Kosovo, 847 were reported to have been killed and 1,154 kidnapped. This comprised both civilians and security force personnel. Of those killed in the first period, 335 were civilians, 351 soldiers, 230 police and 72 were unidentified. By nationality, 87 of the killed civilians were Serbs, 230 Albanians, and 18 of other nationalities. Following the withdrawal of Serbian and Yugoslav security forces from Kosovo in June 1999, all casualties were civilians, the vast majority being Serbs. According to Human Rights Watch, as &quot;many as one thousand Serbs and Roma have been murdered or have gone missing since 12 June 1999... elements of the KLA are clearly responsible for many of these crimes&quot;.

A Serbian court sentenced 9 former KLA members for murdering 32 non-Albanian civilians. In the same case, another 35 civilians are missing while 153 were tortured and released.

===Use of child soldiers===

The Convention on the Rights of the Child, adopted by the UN General Assembly on 20 November 1989, entered into force on 2 September 1990 and was valid throughout the conflict. Article 38 of this Convention state the age of 15 as the minimum for recruitment or participation in armed conflict. Article 38 requires state parties to prevent anyone under the age of 15 from taking direct part in hostilities and to refrain from recruiting anyone under the age of 15 years.

The participation of persons under the age of 18 in the KLA was confirmed in October 2000 when details of the registration of 16,024 KLA soldiers by the International Organization for Migration in Kosovo became known. Ten percent of this number were under the age of 18. The majority of them were 16 and 17 years old. Around 2% were below the age of 16. These were mainly girls recruited to cook for the soldiers rather than to actually fight.

===Organ theft allegations===
Carla Del Ponte, a long-time ICTY chief prosecutor, claimed in her book &quot;The Hunt: Me and the War Criminals&quot; (2008) that there were instances of organ trafficking in 1999 after the end of the Kosovo War. The allegations have been rejected by Kosovar authorities as fabrications while the ICTY has said &quot;no reliable evidence had been obtained to substantiate the allegations&quot;. In early 2011 the European Parliament&#x27;s Committee on Foreign Affairs viewed a report by Dick Marty on the alleged criminal activities and alleged organ harvesting controversy; however, the Members of Parliament criticised the report, citing lack of evidence, and Marty responded that a witness protection program was needed in Kosovo before he could provide more details on witnesses because their lives were in danger.

In 2011, France 24 obtained a classified document which dated back to 2003 and revealed that the UN knew about the organ trafficking before it was mentioned by Carla del Ponte in 2008.

In July 2014, American attorney Clint Williamson, the former United States Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes Issues, announced that he and his team had found &quot;compelling indications&quot; that approximately 10 prisoners had been killed so their organs could be harvested. &quot;The fact that it occurred on a limited scale does not diminish the savagery of such a crime,&quot; Williamson said, but added that the level of evidence was insufficient to file charges against any particular individual.

===Murders===
On 24 June 2020, Hashim Thaçi, then President of Kosovo, Kadri Veseli and eight other former leaders of the KLA, were indicted by the Specialist Prosecutor&#x27;s Office (SPO) at the International Court of Justice in Hague. The indictment charges the suspects with approximately 100 murders of Kosovo Albanians, Kosovo Serbs, Kosovo Roma, and political opponents. According to the Specialist Prosecutor it was necessary to make the issue public due to repeated efforts by Thaçi and Veseli to obstruct and undermine the work of the Kosovo Specialist Chambers.

===Massacres===
* Klečka killings (26–27 August 1998) – 22 burnt bodies were found in a makeshift crematorium; Serbia has attributed the killings to the KLA.
* Lake Radonjić massacre (9 September 1998) – 34 individuals of Serb, Roma and Albanian ethnicity were discovered by a Serbian forensic team near the lake. Serbia has attributed the killing to the KLA and other Kosovan militants.
* Mališevo mass grave - After being kidnapped and held in detention by the KLA, 12 Serbs and 1 Bulgarian civilian were massacred with their remains discovered in a mass grave in the town of Malisheva.
* Gnjilane killings – The remains of 80 Serbs were discovered after they were killed, allegedly by members of the KLA&#x27;s Gnjilane Group, who were tried in absentia by a Serbian court and found guilty. A mass grave was found in Čena(r) Česma near Gjilan.
* Orahovac massacre – More than 100 Serbian and Roma civilians from Rahovec and its surrounding villages - Retimlje, Opterusa, Zočište and Velika Hoca - in western Kosovo were kidnapped and placed in prison camps by KLA fighters; 47 were killed and their grave found in 2005.
* Staro Gracko massacre – 14 Serbian farmers were murdered. Perpetrators were never found.
* Ugljare mass grave – 15 bodies of Serbs found in a mass grave, reported on 25 August 1999 by KFOR. The KFOR exhumed the mass grave on 27 July. 14 Serbs had been shot, stabbed or clubbed. was a KLA stronghold.
* Volujak massacre – According to Serb authorities, 25 male Kosovo Serb civilians were murdered. Serbia attributes the killings to the KLA &quot;Orahovac group&quot;.

In 2003, the daily Serbian newspaper &quot;Večernje novosti&quot; published wartime photographs of three KLA soldiers with the heads of decapitated Serbs. The newspaper identified two of the three KLA members as Sadik Chuflaj and his son Valon Chuflaj, who according to the newspaper then worked for the Kosovo Protection Corps. Bojan Cvetkovic, a volunteer soldier who had been only on duty for weeks was identified as one of the victims while the Serbian Radical Party later confirmed that soldier Aleksandar Njegovic who was a SRP member, was the second victim out of three other soldiers that went missing at the same time.

===Destroyed medieval churches and monuments===
Cultural historian András Riedlmayer stated that no Serbian Orthodox churches or monasteries were damaged or destroyed by the KLA during the war. Riedlmayer and Andrew Herscher conducted a survey of Kosovo cultural heritage for the ICTY and UNMIK following the war and their results found that most of the damage to the churches occurred during revenge attacks following the conflict and the return of Kosovo Albanian refugees. In 1999 KLA fighters were accused of vandalizing Devič monastery and terrorizing the staff. The KFOR troops said KLA rebels vandalized centuries-old murals and paintings in the chapel and stole two cars and all the monastery&#x27;s food.

Karima Bennoune, United Nations special rapporteur in the field of cultural rights, referred to the many reports of widespread attacks against churches committed by the Kosovo Liberation Army. In 2014, John Clint Williamson announced EU Special Investigative Task Force&#x27;s investigative findings and he indicated that a certain element of the KLA following the conclusion of the war (June 1999) intentionally targeted minority populations in organized ethnic cleansing campaign with acts of persecution that also included desecration and destruction of churches and other religious sites. Fabio Maniscalco, an Italian archaeologist, specialist about the protection of cultural property, described that KLA members seized icons and liturgical ornaments as they ransacked and that they proceeded to destroy Christian Orthodox churches and monasteries with mortar bombs after the arrival of KFOR.

===Prison camps===
*Lapušnik prison camp – Haradin Bala, a KLA prison guard, was found guilty by the ICTY of torture and mistreatment of prisoners crimes committed at the camp.
* Jablanica prison camp – 10 individuals were detained and tortured by KLA forces including: one Serb, three Montenegrins, one Bosnian, three Albanians, and two victims of unknown ethnicity.

Several survivors of KLA run prison camps in Albania have come forward to tell their stories of being kidnapped and transported to these camps where they witnessed the torture and killing of other prisoners. In 2009, eyewitness testimonies from former inmates and KLA fighters described the detention of Albanian, Roma and Serb civilians from the area of Prizren in KLA run prison camps in the Albanian town of Kukës. Despite the prison camp initially being set up, with assistance from the Albanian army, to detain unruly KLA fighters, acts of torture and extrajudicial killings were committed by the KLA against Albanian, Roma, and Serb civilians. According to one former KLA fighter:

It didn&#x27;t seem strange at the time...but now, looking back, I know that some of the things that were done to innocent civilians were wrong. But the people who did those things act as if nothing happened, and continue to hurt their own people, Albanians.

===Sexual violence===
Since the entry of the NATO-led Kosovo Force, rapes of Serb and Romani, as well as Albanian women perceived as collaborators, by ethnic Albanians and sometimes by KLA members have been documented.

==Status as a terrorist group==

The Yugoslav authorities, under Slobodan Milošević, regarded the KLA as terrorist group. In February 1998, U.S. President Bill Clinton&#x27;s special envoy to the Balkans, Robert Gelbard, condemned both the actions of the Serb government and of the KLA, and described the KLA as &quot;without any questions, a terrorist group&quot;. UN resolution 1160 took a similar stance.

Allegedly the 1997 U.S. State Department&#x27;s official list of &quot;Foreign Terrorist Organizations&quot; did not include the KLA but the U.S. State Department might have listed it as a terrorist organization in 1998 presumably by the fact that it was financing its operations with money from the international heroin trade and loans from Islamic countries. In March 1998, just one month later Gerbald had to modify his statements to say that KLA had not been classified legally by the U.S. government as a terrorist group, and the U.S. government approached the KLA leaders to make them interlocutors with the Serbs. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; claimed later that the U.S. government had in February 1998 removed the KLA from the list of terrorist organisations, a removal that has never been confirmed. France delisted the KLA in late 1998, after strong U.S. and UK lobbying. KLA is still present in the MIPT Terrorism Knowledge Base list of terrorist groups, and is listed as an inactive terrorist organisation by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism. Throughout its existence the KLA was designated as a terrorist group by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

During the war, the KLA troops collaborated with the NATO troops, and one of its members was called by NATO the embodiment of the Kosovo &quot;freedom fighters&quot;. In late 1999 the KLA was disbanded and its members entered the Kosovo Protection Corps. Most states which faced on their territory international activity by the KLA never officially designated it as a terrorist organization.

==Investigations for war crimes==
In 2005, the KLA commander Haradin Bala was convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity against Serbs and Albanians by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. KLA commanders and later Kosovo politicians, Ramush Haradinaj and Fatmir Limaj were acquitted, but the court noted that there were difficulties because many witnesses were fearful of giving testimonies, while others changed their testimonies and some died in mysterious circumstances. In addition, there were convictions for witness-tampering regarding these two cases.

In 2010, a report by the Council of Europe accused KLA guerrillas of killing civilian Serbs and ethnic Albanian political opponents. Based on the Council of Europe report, the Special Investigative Task Force (SITF) was created in 2011 to investigate the allegations. The SITF chief prosecutor presented his general findings in 2014 resulting in the creation of the specialist chambers in The Hague to adjudicate the cases.

In April 2014, the Assembly of Kosovo considered and approved the establishment of a special court of Kosovo to try alleged war crimes and other serious abuses committed during and after the 1998–99 Kosovo war. The court will adjudicate cases against individuals based on a 2010 Council of Europe report by the Swiss senator Dick Marty. The proceedings will be EU-funded and held in The Hague, though it would still be a Kosovo national court. Defendants will likely include members of the Kosovo Liberation Army who are alleged to have committed crimes against ethnic minorities and political opponents, meaning the court is likely to meet with some unpopularity at home, where the KLA are still widely considered heroes.

In 2017, ten members of the KLA, including Sylejman Selimi who was ex-head of the Kosovo Security Force and later ambassador to Albania, were convicted for war crimes against civilians.

On June 24, 2020, the Kosovo Specialist Chambers and Specialist Prosecutor&#x27;s Office filed a ten-count Indictment, charging Kosovo President Hashim Thaçi, Kadri Veseli and others for crimes against humanity and war crimes. The prosecutors said that Hashim Thaci and Kadri Veseli repeatedly tried to obstruct and undermine the work of the KSC (Special Court of Kosovo), &quot;in an attempt to ensure that they do not face justice&quot;. In July 2020, Thaçi was questioned by war crimes prosecutors at The Hague.

In September 2020, Agim Çeku was summoned by the prosecutors as a war crimes suspect. The same month, the former KLA commander Salih Mustafa was arrested and transferred to the detention facilities in The Hague, based on a &quot;warrant, transfer order and confirmed indictment issued by a pre-trial judge&quot;. Mustafa was charged with the war crimes of arbitrary detention, cruel treatment, torture and murder. The same month, Hysni Gucati (Chairman of the Kosovo Liberation Army War Veterans Association) and Nasim Haradinaj (Deputy Chairman of the Kosovo Liberation Army War Veterans Association) were also arrested and transferred to the Kosovo Specialist Chambers&#x27;s Detention Unit. They were charged for obstructing Special Court of Kosovo officials in performing their duties, intimidation during criminal proceedings, retaliation and violating secrecy of proceedings.

In November 2020, Thaci, a deputy in the Kosovo parliament Rexhep Selimi, the president of Thaci&#x27;s Kosovo Democratic Party Kadri Veseli and veteran Kosovo politician Jakup Krasniqi were arrested and transferred to the detention center of the Kosovo Tribunal in The Hague on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity.

In December 2020, the Parliament of Albania decided to create a committee in order to investigate the accusations against KLA of human rights violations in both Kosovo and north Albania where it had bases. Prime Minister Edi Rama accused the opposition chief Lulzim Basha of helping the UN to investigate the KLA and called him a traitor. Basha denied the accusations.

In 2020, Serbian authorities arrested Nezir Mehmetaj at the Merdare. He is accused of participating in war crimes against civilians including murders and burning and looting of private properties in the village of Rudice at Klina during the war. He denied the accusations.

In February 2021, the president of the Kosovo Specialist Chambers, Ekaterina Trendafilova, informed the European diplomats that there were increasing efforts from Kosovo to undermine the court&#x27;s work and warned about the safety of the witnesses. She mentioned that there were attempts to challenge the law and to pardon those convicted of crimes. In addition she said that Kosovo is trying hard to move the court from Hague to Pristina (capital of Kosovo) and such a move would &quot;risk the lives, safety and security of the people who have or will be willing to cooperate with the court&quot;.

In March 2021, Belgian authorities arrested Pjeter Shala, a former KLA commander on war crimes charges.

The United States Country Reports on Human Rights Practices of 2021 reported that &quot;leading politicians, civil society leaders and veterans organisations&quot; in Kosovo were trying to undermine the Hague court.

In May 2022, more charges were added for war crimes allegedly committed in 1998 and 1999 by KLA members at the dormitories in Budakove and Semetishte. According to the final indictment, most of the crimes committed at detention centres in Kosovo and Albania.

In December 2022 Salih Mustafa, who had been arrested in September 2020, was convicted in The Hague of the war crimes of arbitrary detention, torture, and murder, but not convicted of cruel treatment for legal reasons. He was sentenced to 26 years in prison. The Trial Panel also mentioned that the victims and witnesses had shown tremendous courage cooperating with the Specialist Chambers and the Specialist Prosecutor, because they were subjected to threats and intimidation in Kosovo for their cooperation.

Kosovo provides help to former KLA members but does not support the victims of war crimes, despite the Chambers requests.

<text>A water tower is an elevated structure supporting a water tank constructed at a height sufficient to pressurize a distribution system for potable water, and to provide emergency storage for fire protection. Water towers often operate in conjunction with underground or surface service reservoirs, which store treated water close to where it will be used. Other types of water towers may only store raw (non-potable) water for fire protection or industrial purposes, and may not necessarily be connected to a public water supply.

Water towers are able to supply water even during power outages, because they rely on hydrostatic pressure produced by elevation of water (due to gravity) to push the water into domestic and industrial water distribution systems; however, they cannot supply the water for a long time without power, because a pump is typically required to refill the tower. A water tower also serves as a reservoir to help with water needs during peak usage times. The water level in the tower typically falls during the peak usage hours of the day, and then a pump fills it back up during the night. This process also keeps the water from freezing in cold weather, since the tower is constantly being drained and refilled.

== History ==

Although the use of elevated water storage tanks has existed since ancient times in various forms, the modern use of water towers for pressurized public water systems developed during the mid-19th century, as steam-pumping became more common, and better pipes that could handle higher pressures were developed. In the United Kingdom, standpipes consisted of tall, exposed, N-shaped pipes, used for pressure relief and to provide a fixed elevation for steam-driven pumping engines which tended to produce a pulsing flow, while the pressurized water distribution system required constant pressure. Standpipes also provided a convenient fixed location to measure flow rates. Designers typically enclosed the riser pipes in decorative masonry or wooden structures. By the late 19th century, standpipes grew to include storage tanks to meet the ever-increasing demands of growing cities.

Many early water towers are now considered historically significant and have been included in various heritage listings around the world. Some are converted to apartments or exclusive penthouses. In certain areas, such as New York City in the United States, smaller water towers are constructed for individual buildings. In California and some other states, domestic water towers enclosed by siding (tankhouses) were once built (1850s–1930s) to supply individual homes; windmills pumped water from hand-dug wells up into the tank in New York.

Water towers were used to supply water stops for steam locomotives on railroad lines. Early steam locomotives required water stops every .

== Design and construction ==

A variety of materials can be used to construct a typical water tower; steel and reinforced or prestressed concrete are most often used (with wood, fiberglass, or brick also in use), incorporating an interior coating to protect the water from any effects from the lining material. The reservoir in the tower may be spherical, cylindrical, or an ellipsoid, with a minimum height of approximately and a minimum of in diameter. A standard water tower typically has a height of approximately . 

Pressurization occurs through the hydrostatic pressure of the elevation of water; for every of elevation, it produces of pressure. of elevation produces roughly , which is enough pressure to operate and provide for most domestic water pressure and distribution system requirements.

The height of the tower provides the pressure for the water supply system, and it may be supplemented with a pump. The volume of the reservoir and diameter of the piping provide and sustain flow rate. However, relying on a pump to provide pressure is expensive; to keep up with varying demand, the pump would have to be sized to meet peak demands. During periods of low demand, jockey pumps are used to meet these lower water flow requirements. The water tower reduces the need for electrical consumption of cycling pumps and thus the need for an expensive pump control system, as this system would have to be sized sufficiently to give the same pressure at high flow rates.

Very high volumes and flow rates are needed when fighting fires. With a water tower present, pumps can be sized for average demand, not peak demand; the water tower can provide water pressure during the day and pumps will refill the water tower when demands are lower.

Using wireless sensor networks to monitor water levels inside the tower allows municipalities to automatically monitor and control pumps without installing and maintaining expensive data cables.

== Architecture ==
The adjacent image shows three architectural approaches to incorporating these tanks in the design of a building, one on East 57th Street in New York City. From left to right, a fully enclosed and ornately decorated brick structure, a simple unadorned roofless brick structure hiding most of the tank but revealing the top of the tank, and a simple utilitarian structure that makes no effort to hide the tanks or otherwise incorporate them into the design of the building.

The technology dates to at least the 19th century, and for a long time New York City required that all buildings higher than six stories be equipped with a rooftop water tower. Two companies in New York build water towers, both of which are family businesses in operation since the 19th century.

The original water tower builders were barrel makers who expanded their craft to meet a modern need as buildings in the city grew taller in height. Even today, no sealant is used to hold the water in. The wooden walls of the water tower are held together with steel cables or straps, but water leaks through the gaps when first filled. As the water saturates the wood, it swells, the gaps close and become impermeable. The rooftop water towers store of water until it is needed in the building below. The upper portion of water is skimmed off the top for everyday use while the water in the bottom of the tower is held in reserve to fight fire. When the water drops below a certain level, a pressure switch, level switch or float valve will activate a pump or open a public water line to refill the water tower.

Architects and builders have taken varied approaches to incorporating water towers into the design of their buildings. On many large commercial buildings, water towers are completely hidden behind an extension of the facade of the building. For cosmetic reasons, apartment buildings often enclose their tanks in rooftop structures, either simple unadorned rooftop boxes, or ornately decorated structures intended to enhance the visual appeal of the building. Many buildings, however, leave their water towers in plain view atop utilitarian framework structures.

Water towers are common in India, where the electricity supply is erratic in most places.

If the pumps fail (such as during a power outage), then water pressure will be lost, causing potential public health concerns. Many U.S. states require a &quot;boil-water advisory&quot; to be issued if water pressure drops below . This advisory presumes that the lower pressure might allow pathogens to enter the system.

Some have been converted to serve modern purposes, as for example, the Wieża Ciśnień (Wrocław water tower) in Wrocław, Poland which is today a restaurant complex. Others have been converted to residential use.

Historically, railroads that used steam locomotives required a means of replenishing the locomotive&#x27;s tenders. Water towers were common along the railroad. The tenders were usually replenished by water cranes, which were fed by a water tower.

Some water towers are also used as observation towers, and some restaurants, such as the Goldbergturm in Sindelfingen, Germany, or the second of the three Kuwait Towers, in the State of Kuwait. It is also common to use water towers as the location of transmission mechanisms in the UHF range with small power, for instance for closed rural broadcasting service, amateur radio, or cellular telephone service.

In hilly regions, local topography can be substituted for structures to elevate the tanks. These tanks are often nothing more than concrete cisterns terraced into the sides of local hills or mountains, but function identically to the traditional water tower. The tops of these tanks can be landscaped or used as park space, if desired.

=== Spheres and spheroids ===
The Chicago Bridge and Iron Company has built many of the water spheres and spheroids found in the United States. The website &quot;World&#x27;s Tallest Water Sphere&quot; describes the distinction between a water sphere and water spheroid thus:


The Union Watersphere is a water tower topped with a sphere-shaped water tank in Union, New Jersey, and characterized as the &quot;World&#x27;s Tallest Water Sphere&quot;.

A &quot;Star Ledger&quot; article suggested a water tower in Erwin, North Carolina completed in early 2012, tall and holding , had become the World&#x27;s Tallest Water Sphere. However, photographs of the Erwin water tower revealed the new tower to be a water spheroid.

The water tower in Braman, Oklahoma, built by the Kaw Nation and completed in 2010, is tall and can hold . Slightly taller than the Union Watersphere, it is also a spheroid.

Another tower in Oklahoma, built in 1986 and billed as the &quot;largest water tower in the country&quot;, is tall, can hold , and is located in Edmond.

The &quot;Earthoid&quot;, a perfectly spherical tank located in Germantown, Maryland is tall and holds of water. The name is taken from it being painted to resemble a globe of the world.

The golf ball-shaped tank of the water tower at Gonzales, California is supported by three tubular legs and reaches about high.

The Watertoren (or Water Towers) in Eindhoven, Netherlands contain three spherical tanks, each in diameter and capable of holding of water, on three spires were completed in 1970.

== Decoration and Traditions ==
Water towers can be surrounded by ornate coverings including fancy brickwork, a large ivy-covered trellis or they can be simply painted. Some city water towers have the name of the city painted in large letters on the roof, as a navigational aid to aviators and motorists. Sometimes the decoration can be humorous. An example of this are water towers built side by side, labeled &quot;HOT&quot; and &quot;COLD&quot;. Cities in the United States possessing side-by-side water towers labeled HOT and COLD include Granger, Iowa; Canton, Kansas; Pratt, Kansas, and St. Clair, Missouri. Eveleth, Minnesota at one time had two such towers, but no longer does.

&lt;br&gt;

Many small towns in the United States use their water towers to advertise local tourism, their local high school sports teams, or other locally notable facts. A &quot;mushroom&quot; water tower was built in Örebro, Sweden and holds almost two million gallons of water.

== Tallest ==


== Alternatives ==
Alternatives to water towers are simple pumps mounted on top of the water pipes to increase the water pressure. This new approach is more straightforward, but also more subject to potential public health risks; if the pumps fail, then loss of water pressure may result in entry of contaminants into the water system. Most large water utilities do not use this approach, given the potential risks.

<text>The U.S. National Ice Center (USNIC) is a tri-agency operational center and echelon V command of the Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVOCEANO), whose mission is to provide worldwide navigational ice analyses for the armed forces of the United States, allied nations, and U.S. government agencies.

It is represented by the United States Navy (Department of Defense); the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Department of Commerce); and the United States Coast Guard (Department of Homeland Security). The U.S. National Ice Center is a subordinate command of the Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVOCEANO). Originally known as the Navy/NOAA Joint Ice Center, which was established on December 15, 1976 in a memorandum of agreement between the U.S. Navy and NOAA, the National Ice Center was formed in 1995 when the U.S. Coast Guard became a partner. The U.S. National Ice Center produces global sea ice charts and various cryospheric GIS products. They also name and track Antarctic icebergs if greater than on its longest axis.

Icebergs must be a minimum of 19 kilometers in length to be tracked by the USNIC.

<text>Stefano Benni (born 12 August 1947) is an Italian satirical writer, poet and journalist. His books have been translated into around 20 foreign languages and scored notable commercial success. 2.5 million copies of his books have been sold in Italy.

==Biography==
Benni has written many successful novels and anthologies, among which are &quot;Bar Sport, Elianto, Terra!, La compagnia dei celestini, Baol, Comici spaventati guerrieri, Saltatempo, Margherita Dolcevita&quot; and &quot;Il bar sotto il mare&quot;.
He has also worked with the weekly magazines &quot;L&#x27;espresso&quot; and &quot;Panorama&quot;, and with the satirical &quot;Cuore&quot; and &quot;Tango&quot;, the monthly magazines &quot;Linus&quot; and &quot;Il Mago&quot; (where he began and published in installments part of &quot;Bar Sport&quot;), and the newspapers &quot;La Repubblica&quot; and &quot;il manifesto&quot;.

He also wrote television sketches for Beppe Grillo at the beginning of Grillo&#x27;s career, and one of these sketches – called &quot;Pietro Longo=P2&quot; – caused the Psdi to ask the RAI commission to remove Grillo from RAI TV; their request was denied.

In 1989, with Umberto Angelucci, Benni directed the film &quot;Musica per vecchi animali&quot;, adapted from his book &quot;Comici spaventati guerrieri&quot;, with the actors Dario Fo, Paolo Rossi, and Viola Simoncioni. Two years before that he was also the screenwriter of another film, &quot;Topo Galileo&quot; by Francesco Laudadio, starring his friend Beppe Grillo and with music by Fabrizio De André and Mauro Pagani.

With the jazz musician Umberto Petrin, he wrote &quot;Misterioso. Viaggio nel silenzio di Thelonius Monk&quot;.

His novels contain, within imaginary worlds and situations, a strong satire of Italian society over the last few decades. His writing style includes many puns, neologisms and parodies of other literary styles.

In January and February 2010, he presented the event &quot;Bennac&quot;, a meeting between himself and the French writer Daniel Pennac.

<text>The Colorado Mineral Belt (CMB) is an area of ore deposits from the La Plata Mountains in Southwestern Colorado to near the middle of the state at Boulder, Colorado, and from which over 25 million troy ounces (778 t) of gold were extracted beginning in 1858. The belt is a &quot;northeast-striking zone defined by: a Proterozoic shear zone system (McCoy, 2001); a suite of Laramide-aged plutons and related ore deposits (Tweto and Sims, 1963); a major gravity low (Isaacson and Smithson, 1976); low-crustal velocities; and high heat flow (Decker et al., 1988).&quot; Mining districts include:

*Central City-Idaho Springs district
*Leadville mining district, named for Leadville, Colorado
*Sneffels-Red Mountain-Telluride district

The belt lies within a zone that has been geologically active at intervals beginning from near the time of crustal accretion in central Colorado at least 1.6 billion years ago until the present. Parts of the CMB follow shear zones of Precambrian age and the Paleozoic and Mesozoic. Igneous rocks intruded about 60 to 70 million years ago during the Laramide orogeny are associated with the belt and once were thought to be responsible for most of the ore deposits. Now many of the important ore deposits are thought to be genetically related to younger magmatism, some at least as young as about 25 million years.

<doc id="44968" wikidata="Q45284" url="?curid=44968" title="Likelihood function">
<text>A likelihood function (often simply called the likelihood) measures how well a statistical model explains observed data by calculating the probability of seeing that data under different parameter values of the model. It is constructed from the joint probability distribution of the random variable that (presumably) generated the observations. When evaluated on the actual data points, it becomes a function solely of the model parameters.

In maximum likelihood estimation, the argument that maximizes the likelihood function serves as a point estimate for the unknown parameter, while the Fisher information (often approximated by the likelihood&#x27;s Hessian matrix at the maximum) gives an indication of the estimate&#x27;s precision.

In contrast, in Bayesian statistics, the estimate of interest is the &quot;converse&quot; of the likelihood, the so-called posterior probability of the parameter given the observed data, which is calculated via Bayes&#x27; rule.

==Definition==
The likelihood function, parameterized by a (possibly multivariate) parameter formula_1, is usually defined differently for discrete and continuous probability distributions (a more general definition is discussed below). Given a probability density or mass function

formula_2

where formula_3 is a realization of the random variable formula_4, the likelihood function is
formula_5
often written
formula_6

In other words, when formula_7 is viewed as a function of formula_3 with formula_1 fixed, it is a probability density function, and when viewed as a function of formula_1 with formula_3 fixed, it is a likelihood function. In the frequentist paradigm, the notation formula_7 is often avoided and instead formula_13 or formula_14 are used to indicate that formula_1 is regarded as a fixed unknown quantity rather than as a random variable being conditioned on. 

The likelihood function does &quot;not&quot; specify the probability that formula_1 is the truth, given the observed sample formula_17. Such an interpretation is a common error, with potentially disastrous consequences (see prosecutor&#x27;s fallacy).

===Discrete probability distribution===
Let formula_4 be a discrete random variable with probability mass function formula_19 depending on a parameter formula_1. Then the function

formula_21

considered as a function of formula_1, is the &quot;likelihood function&quot;, given the outcome formula_3 of the random variable formula_4. Sometimes the probability of &quot;the value formula_3 of formula_4 for the parameter value formula_1&quot; is written as or . The likelihood is the probability that a particular outcome formula_3 is observed when the true value of the parameter is formula_1, equivalent to the probability mass on formula_3; it is &quot;not&quot; a probability density over the parameter formula_1. The likelihood, formula_32, should not be confused with formula_33, which is the posterior probability of formula_1 given the data formula_3.

====Example====
Consider a simple statistical model of a coin flip: a single parameter formula_36 that expresses the &quot;fairness&quot; of the coin. The parameter is the probability that a coin lands heads up (&quot;H&quot;) when tossed. formula_36 can take on any value within the range 0.0 to 1.0. For a perfectly fair coin, formula_38.

Imagine flipping a fair coin twice, and observing two heads in two tosses (&quot;HH&quot;). Assuming that each successive coin flip is i.i.d., then the probability of observing HH is

formula_39

Equivalently, the likelihood of observing &quot;HH&quot; assuming formula_38 is

formula_41

This is not the same as saying that formula_42, a conclusion which could only be reached via Bayes&#x27; theorem given knowledge about the marginal probabilities formula_43 and formula_44.

Now suppose that the coin is not a fair coin, but instead that formula_45. Then the probability of two heads on two flips is

formula_46

Hence

formula_47

More generally, for each value of formula_36, we can calculate the corresponding likelihood. The result of such calculations is displayed in Figure 1. The integral of formula_49 over [0, 1] is 1/3; likelihoods need not integrate or sum to one over the parameter space.

===Continuous probability distribution===
Let formula_4 be a random variable following an absolutely continuous probability distribution with density function formula_51 (a function of formula_3) which depends on a parameter formula_1. Then the function

formula_54

considered as a function of formula_1, is the &quot;likelihood function&quot; (of formula_1, given the outcome formula_57). Again, formula_49 is not a probability density or mass function over formula_1, despite being a function of formula_1 given the observation formula_17.

====Relationship between the likelihood and probability density functions====
The use of the probability density in specifying the likelihood function above is justified as follows. Given an observation formula_62, the likelihood for the interval formula_63, where formula_64 is a constant, is given by formula_65. Observe that
formula_66
since formula_67 is positive and constant. Because
formula_68

where formula_69 is the probability density function, it follows that

formula_70

The first fundamental theorem of calculus provides that
formula_71

Then
formula_72

Therefore,
formula_73
and so maximizing the probability density at formula_74 amounts to maximizing the likelihood of the specific observation formula_74.

===In general===

In measure-theoretic probability theory, the density function is defined as the Radon–Nikodym derivative of the probability distribution relative to a common dominating measure. The likelihood function is this density interpreted as a function of the parameter, rather than the random variable. Thus, we can construct a likelihood function for any distribution, whether discrete, continuous, a mixture, or otherwise. (Likelihoods are comparable, e.g. for parameter estimation, only if they are Radon–Nikodym derivatives with respect to the same dominating measure.)

The above discussion of the likelihood for discrete random variables uses the counting measure, under which the probability density at any outcome equals the probability of that outcome.

===Likelihoods for mixed continuous–discrete distributions===
The above can be extended in a simple way to allow consideration of distributions which contain both discrete and continuous components. Suppose that the distribution consists of a number of discrete probability masses formula_76 and a density formula_7, where the sum of all the formula_19&#x27;s added to the integral of formula_51 is always one. Assuming that it is possible to distinguish an observation corresponding to one of the discrete probability masses from one which corresponds to the density component, the likelihood function for an observation from the continuous component can be dealt with in the manner shown above. For an observation from the discrete component, the likelihood function for an observation from the discrete component is simply
formula_80
where formula_81 is the index of the discrete probability mass corresponding to observation formula_3, because maximizing the probability mass (or probability) at formula_3 amounts to maximizing the likelihood of the specific observation.

The fact that the likelihood function can be defined in a way that includes contributions that are not commensurate (the density and the probability mass) arises from the way in which the likelihood function is defined up to a constant of proportionality, where this &quot;constant&quot; can change with the observation formula_3, but not with the parameter formula_1.

=== Regularity conditions ===
In the context of parameter estimation, the likelihood function is usually assumed to obey certain conditions, known as regularity conditions. These conditions are in various proofs involving likelihood functions, and need to be verified in each particular application. For maximum likelihood estimation, the existence of a global maximum of the likelihood function is of the utmost importance. By the extreme value theorem, it suffices that the likelihood function is continuous on a compact parameter space for the maximum likelihood estimator to exist. While the continuity assumption is usually met, the compactness assumption about the parameter space is often not, as the bounds of the true parameter values might be unknown. In that case, concavity of the likelihood function plays a key role.

More specifically, if the likelihood function is twice continuously differentiable on the k-dimensional parameter space formula_86 assumed to be an open connected subset of formula_87 there exists a unique maximum formula_88 if the matrix of second partials
formula_89 is negative definite for every formula_90 at which the gradient formula_91 vanishes,
and if the likelihood function approaches a constant on the boundary of the parameter space, formula_92 i.e.,
formula_93
which may include the points at infinity if formula_94 is unbounded. Mäkeläinen and co-authors prove this result using Morse theory while informally appealing to a mountain pass property. Mascarenhas restates their proof using the mountain pass theorem.

In the proofs of consistency and asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator, additional assumptions are made about the probability densities that form the basis of a particular likelihood function. These conditions were first established by Chanda. In particular, for almost all formula_3, and for all formula_96
formula_97
exist for all formula_98 in order to ensure the existence of a Taylor expansion. Second, for almost all formula_3 and for every formula_90 it must be that
formula_101
where formula_102 is such that formula_103 This boundedness of the derivatives is needed to allow for differentiation under the integral sign. And lastly, it is assumed that the information matrix,
formula_104
is positive definite and formula_105 is finite. This ensures that the score has a finite variance.

The above conditions are sufficient, but not necessary. That is, a model that does not meet these regularity conditions may or may not have a maximum likelihood estimator of the properties mentioned above. Further, in case of non-independently or non-identically distributed observations additional properties may need to be assumed.

In Bayesian statistics, almost identical regularity conditions are imposed on the likelihood function in order to proof asymptotic normality of the posterior probability, and therefore to justify a Laplace approximation of the posterior in large samples.

==Likelihood ratio and relative likelihood==

===Likelihood ratio===

A &quot;likelihood ratio&quot; is the ratio of any two specified likelihoods, frequently written as:
formula_106

The likelihood ratio is central to likelihoodist statistics: the &quot;law of likelihood&quot; states that the degree to which data (considered as evidence) supports one parameter value versus another is measured by the likelihood ratio.

In frequentist inference, the likelihood ratio is the basis for a test statistic, the so-called likelihood-ratio test. By the Neyman–Pearson lemma, this is the most powerful test for comparing two simple hypotheses at a given significance level. Numerous other tests can be viewed as likelihood-ratio tests or approximations thereof. The asymptotic distribution of the log-likelihood ratio, considered as a test statistic, is given by Wilks&#x27; theorem.

The likelihood ratio is also of central importance in Bayesian inference, where it is known as the Bayes factor, and is used in Bayes&#x27; rule. Stated in terms of odds, Bayes&#x27; rule states that the &quot;posterior&quot; odds of two alternatives, and , given an event , is the &quot;prior&quot; odds, times the likelihood ratio. As an equation:
formula_107

The likelihood ratio is not directly used in AIC-based statistics. Instead, what is used is the relative likelihood of models (see below).

In evidence-based medicine, likelihood ratios are used in diagnostic testing to assess the value of performing a diagnostic test.

===Relative likelihood function===

Since the actual value of the likelihood function depends on the sample, it is often convenient to work with a standardized measure. Suppose that the maximum likelihood estimate for the parameter is formula_108. Relative plausibilities of other values may be found by comparing the likelihoods of those other values with the likelihood of formula_108. The &quot;relative likelihood&quot; of is defined to be 
formula_110
Thus, the relative likelihood is the likelihood ratio (discussed above) with the fixed denominator formula_111. This corresponds to standardizing the likelihood to have a maximum of 1.

====Likelihood region====
A &quot;likelihood region&quot; is the set of all values of whose relative likelihood is greater than or equal to a given threshold. In terms of percentages, a &quot;% likelihood region&quot; for is defined to be

formula_112

If is a single real parameter, a % likelihood region will usually comprise an interval of real values. If the region does comprise an interval, then it is called a &quot;likelihood interval&quot;.

Likelihood intervals, and more generally likelihood regions, are used for interval estimation within likelihoodist statistics: they are similar to confidence intervals in frequentist statistics and credible intervals in Bayesian statistics. Likelihood intervals are interpreted directly in terms of relative likelihood, not in terms of coverage probability (frequentism) or posterior probability (Bayesianism).

Given a model, likelihood intervals can be compared to confidence intervals. If is a single real parameter, then under certain conditions, a 14.65% likelihood interval (about 1:7 likelihood) for will be the same as a 95% confidence interval (19/20 coverage probability). In a slightly different formulation suited to the use of log-likelihoods (see Wilks&#x27; theorem), the test statistic is twice the difference in log-likelihoods and the probability distribution of the test statistic is approximately a chi-squared distribution with degrees-of-freedom (df) equal to the difference in df&#x27;s between the two models (therefore, the −2 likelihood interval is the same as the 0.954 confidence interval; assuming difference in df&#x27;s to be 1).

==Likelihoods that eliminate nuisance parameters==
In many cases, the likelihood is a function of more than one parameter but interest focuses on the estimation of only one, or at most a few of them, with the others being considered as nuisance parameters. Several alternative approaches have been developed to eliminate such nuisance parameters, so that a likelihood can be written as a function of only the parameter (or parameters) of interest: the main approaches are profile, conditional, and marginal likelihoods. These approaches are also useful when a high-dimensional likelihood surface needs to be reduced to one or two parameters of interest in order to allow a graph.

===Profile likelihood===
It is possible to reduce the dimensions by concentrating the likelihood function for a subset of parameters by expressing the nuisance parameters as functions of the parameters of interest and replacing them in the likelihood function. In general, for a likelihood function depending on the parameter vector formula_113 that can be partitioned into formula_114, and where a correspondence formula_115 can be determined explicitly, concentration reduces computational burden of the original maximization problem.

For instance, in a linear regression with normally distributed errors, formula_116, the coefficient vector could be partitioned into formula_117 (and consequently the design matrix formula_118). Maximizing with respect to formula_119 yields an optimal value function formula_120. Using this result, the maximum likelihood estimator for formula_121 can then be derived as
formula_122
where formula_123 is the projection matrix of formula_124. This result is known as the Frisch–Waugh–Lovell theorem.

Since graphically the procedure of concentration is equivalent to slicing the likelihood surface along the ridge of values of the nuisance parameter formula_119 that maximizes the likelihood function, creating an isometric profile of the likelihood function for a given formula_121, the result of this procedure is also known as &quot;profile likelihood&quot;. In addition to being graphed, the profile likelihood can also be used to compute confidence intervals that often have better small-sample properties than those based on asymptotic standard errors calculated from the full likelihood.

===Conditional likelihood===
Sometimes it is possible to find a sufficient statistic for the nuisance parameters, and conditioning on this statistic results in a likelihood which does not depend on the nuisance parameters.

One example occurs in 2×2 tables, where conditioning on all four marginal totals leads to a conditional likelihood based on the non-central hypergeometric distribution. This form of conditioning is also the basis for Fisher&#x27;s exact test.

===Marginal likelihood===

Sometimes we can remove the nuisance parameters by considering a likelihood based on only part of the information in the data, for example by using the set of ranks rather than the numerical values. Another example occurs in linear mixed models, where considering a likelihood for the residuals only after fitting the fixed effects leads to residual maximum likelihood estimation of the variance components.

===Partial likelihood===
A partial likelihood is an adaption of the full likelihood such that only a part of the parameters (the parameters of interest) occur in it. It is a key component of the proportional hazards model: using a restriction on the hazard function, the likelihood does not contain the shape of the hazard over time.

==Products of likelihoods==
The likelihood, given two or more independent events, is the product of the likelihoods of each of the individual events:
formula_127
This follows from the definition of independence in probability: the probabilities of two independent events happening, given a model, is the product of the probabilities.

This is particularly important when the events are from independent and identically distributed random variables, such as independent observations or sampling with replacement. In such a situation, the likelihood function factors into a product of individual likelihood functions.

The empty product has value 1, which corresponds to the likelihood, given no event, being 1: before any data, the likelihood is always 1. This is similar to a uniform prior in Bayesian statistics, but in likelihoodist statistics this is not an improper prior because likelihoods are not integrated.

==Log-likelihood==

&quot;Log-likelihood function&quot; is the logarithm of the likelihood function, often denoted by a lowercase or , to contrast with the uppercase or formula_49 for the likelihood. Because logarithms are strictly increasing functions, maximizing the likelihood is equivalent to maximizing the log-likelihood. But for practical purposes it is more convenient to work with the log-likelihood function in maximum likelihood estimation, in particular since most common probability distributions—notably the exponential family—are only logarithmically concave, and concavity of the objective function plays a key role in the maximization.

Given the independence of each event, the overall log-likelihood of intersection equals the sum of the log-likelihoods of the individual events. This is analogous to the fact that the overall log-probability is the sum of the log-probability of the individual events. In addition to the mathematical convenience from this, the adding process of log-likelihood has an intuitive interpretation, as often expressed as &quot;support&quot; from the data. When the parameters are estimated using the log-likelihood for the maximum likelihood estimation, each data point is used by being added to the total log-likelihood. As the data can be viewed as an evidence that support the estimated parameters, this process can be interpreted as &quot;support from independent evidence &quot;adds&quot;,&quot; and the log-likelihood is the &quot;weight of evidence&quot;. Interpreting negative log-probability as information content or surprisal, the support (log-likelihood) of a model, given an event, is the negative of the surprisal of the event, given the model: a model is supported by an event to the extent that the event is unsurprising, given the model.

A logarithm of a likelihood ratio is equal to the difference of the log-likelihoods:
formula_129

Just as the likelihood, given no event, being 1, the log-likelihood, given no event, is 0, which corresponds to the value of the empty sum: without any data, there is no support for any models.

===Graph===
The graph of the log-likelihood is called the support curve (in the univariate case).
In the multivariate case, the concept generalizes into a support surface over the parameter space.
It has a relation to, but is distinct from, the support of a distribution.

The term was coined by A. W. F. Edwards in the context of statistical hypothesis testing, i.e. whether or not the data &quot;support&quot; one hypothesis (or parameter value) being tested more than any other.

The log-likelihood function being plotted is used in the computation of the score (the gradient of the log-likelihood) and Fisher information (the curvature of the log-likelihood). Thus, the graph has a direct interpretation in the context of maximum likelihood estimation and likelihood-ratio tests.

===Likelihood equations===
If the log-likelihood function is smooth, its gradient with respect to the parameter, known as the score and written formula_130, exists and allows for the application of differential calculus. The basic way to maximize a differentiable function is to find the stationary points (the points where the derivative is zero); since the derivative of a sum is just the sum of the derivatives, but the derivative of a product requires the product rule, it is easier to compute the stationary points of the log-likelihood of independent events than for the likelihood of independent events.

The equations defined by the stationary point of the score function serve as estimating equations for the maximum likelihood estimator.
formula_131
In that sense, the maximum likelihood estimator is implicitly defined by the value at formula_132 of the inverse function formula_133, where formula_134 is the d-dimensional Euclidean space, and formula_135 is the parameter space. Using the inverse function theorem, it can be shown that formula_136 is well-defined in an open neighborhood about formula_132 with probability going to one, and formula_138 is a consistent estimate of formula_1. As a consequence there exists a sequence formula_140 such that formula_141 asymptotically almost surely, and formula_142. A similar result can be established using Rolle&#x27;s theorem.

The second derivative evaluated at formula_108, known as Fisher information, determines the curvature of the likelihood surface, and thus indicates the precision of the estimate.

===Exponential families===

The log-likelihood is also particularly useful for exponential families of distributions, which include many of the common parametric probability distributions. The probability distribution function (and thus likelihood function) for exponential families contain products of factors involving exponentiation. The logarithm of such a function is a sum of products, again easier to differentiate than the original function.

An exponential family is one whose probability density function is of the form (for some functions, writing formula_144 for the inner product):

formula_145

Each of these terms has an interpretation, but simply switching from probability to likelihood and taking logarithms yields the sum:

formula_146

The formula_147 and formula_148 each correspond to a change of coordinates, so in these coordinates, the log-likelihood of an exponential family is given by the simple formula:

formula_149

In words, the log-likelihood of an exponential family is inner product of the natural parameter and the sufficient statistic , minus the normalization factor (log-partition function) . Thus for example the maximum likelihood estimate can be computed by taking derivatives of the sufficient statistic and the log-partition function .

====Example: the gamma distribution====
The gamma distribution is an exponential family with two parameters, formula_150 and formula_151. The likelihood function is

formula_152

Finding the maximum likelihood estimate of formula_151 for a single observed value formula_3 looks rather daunting. Its logarithm is much simpler to work with:

formula_155

To maximize the log-likelihood, we first take the partial derivative with respect to formula_151:

formula_157

If there are a number of independent observations formula_158, then the joint log-likelihood will be the sum of individual log-likelihoods, and the derivative of this sum will be a sum of derivatives of each individual log-likelihood:

formula_159

To complete the maximization procedure for the joint log-likelihood, the equation is set to zero and solved for formula_151:

formula_161

Here formula_162 denotes the maximum-likelihood estimate, and formula_163 is the sample mean of the observations.

==Background and interpretation==
===Historical remarks===
The term &quot;likelihood&quot; has been in use in English since at least late Middle English. Its formal use to refer to a specific function in mathematical statistics was proposed by Ronald Fisher, in two research papers published in 1921 and 1922. The 1921 paper introduced what is today called a &quot;likelihood interval&quot;; the 1922 paper introduced the term &quot;method of maximum likelihood&quot;. Quoting Fisher:

The concept of likelihood should not be confused with probability as mentioned by Sir Ronald Fisher

Fisher&#x27;s invention of statistical likelihood was in reaction against an earlier form of reasoning called inverse probability. His use of the term &quot;likelihood&quot; fixed the meaning of the term within mathematical statistics.

A. W. F. Edwards (1972) established the axiomatic basis for use of the log-likelihood ratio as a measure of relative support for one hypothesis against another. The &quot;support function&quot; is then the natural logarithm of the likelihood function. Both terms are used in phylogenetics, but were not adopted in a general treatment of the topic of statistical evidence.

===Interpretations under different foundations===
Among statisticians, there is no consensus about what the foundation of statistics should be. There are four main paradigms that have been proposed for the foundation: frequentism, Bayesianism, likelihoodism, and AIC-based. For each of the proposed foundations, the interpretation of likelihood is different. The four interpretations are described in the subsections below.

====Frequentist interpretation====
====Bayesian interpretation====
In Bayesian inference, although one can speak about the likelihood of any proposition or random variable given another random variable: for example the likelihood of a parameter value or of a statistical model (see marginal likelihood), given specified data or other evidence, the likelihood function remains the same entity, with the additional interpretations of (i) a conditional density of the data given the parameter (since the parameter is then a random variable) and (ii) a measure or amount of information brought by the data about the parameter value or even the model. Due to the introduction of a probability structure on the parameter space or on the collection of models, it is possible that a parameter value or a statistical model have a large likelihood value for given data, and yet have a low &quot;probability&quot;, or vice versa. This is often the case in medical contexts. Following Bayes&#x27; Rule, the likelihood when seen as a conditional density can be multiplied by the prior probability density of the parameter and then normalized, to give a posterior probability density. More generally, the likelihood of an unknown quantity formula_4 given another unknown quantity formula_165 is proportional to the &quot;probability of formula_165 given formula_4&quot;.

====Likelihoodist interpretation====

In frequentist statistics, the likelihood function is itself a statistic that summarizes a single sample from a population, whose calculated value depends on a choice of several parameters &quot;θ&quot;1 ... &quot;θ&quot;p, where &quot;p&quot; is the count of parameters in some already-selected statistical model. The value of the likelihood serves as a figure of merit for the choice used for the parameters, and the parameter set with maximum likelihood is the best choice, given the data available.

The specific calculation of the likelihood is the probability that the observed sample would be assigned, assuming that the model chosen and the values of the several parameters θ give an accurate approximation of the frequency distribution of the population that the observed sample was drawn from. Heuristically, it makes sense that a good choice of parameters is those which render the sample actually observed the maximum possible &quot;post-hoc&quot; probability of having happened. Wilks&#x27; theorem quantifies the heuristic rule by showing that the difference in the logarithm of the likelihood generated by the estimate&#x27;s parameter values and the logarithm of the likelihood generated by population&#x27;s &quot;true&quot; (but unknown) parameter values is asymptotically χ2 distributed.

Each independent sample&#x27;s maximum likelihood estimate is a separate estimate of the &quot;true&quot; parameter set describing the population sampled. Successive estimates from many independent samples will cluster together with the population&#x27;s &quot;true&quot; set of parameter values hidden somewhere in their midst. The difference in the logarithms of the maximum likelihood and adjacent parameter sets&#x27; likelihoods may be used to draw a confidence region on a plot whose co-ordinates are the parameters &quot;θ&quot;1 ... &quot;θ&quot;p. The region surrounds the maximum-likelihood estimate, and all points (parameter sets) within that region differ at most in log-likelihood by some fixed value. The χ2 distribution given by Wilks&#x27; theorem converts the region&#x27;s log-likelihood differences into the &quot;confidence&quot; that the population&#x27;s &quot;true&quot; parameter set lies inside. The art of choosing the fixed log-likelihood difference is to make the confidence acceptably high while keeping the region acceptably small (narrow range of estimates).

As more data are observed, instead of being used to make independent estimates, they can be combined with the previous samples to make a single combined sample, and that large sample may be used for a new maximum likelihood estimate. As the size of the combined sample increases, the size of the likelihood region with the same confidence shrinks. Eventually, either the size of the confidence region is very nearly a single point, or the entire population has been sampled; in both cases, the estimated parameter set is essentially the same as the population parameter set.

====AIC-based interpretation====

Under the AIC paradigm, likelihood is interpreted within the context of information theory.

<doc id="44970" wikidata="Q709453" url="?curid=44970" title="Frederick T. Frelinghuysen">
<text>Frederick Theodore Frelinghuysen (August 4, 1817May 20, 1885) was an American lawyer and politician from New Jersey who served as a U.S. Senator and later as United States Secretary of State under President Chester A. Arthur.

Frelinghuysen was born in Millstone, New Jersey, and was adopted by his uncle Theodore Frelinghuysen after his father&#x27;s death. He graduated from Rutgers College and studied law under his uncle. Frelinghuysen was involved in various political roles, including serving as a delegate to the 1860 Republican National Convention and as Attorney General of New Jersey. He was also appointed to fill a vacancy in the United States Senate.

In 1870, Frelinghuysen was nominated as U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom but declined the position. He served again as a U.S. Senator from 1871 to 1877, and in 1881, was appointed U.S. Secretary of State by President Chester A. Arthur, serving until 1885. During his tenure, he withdrew the U.S. from the War of the Pacific and negotiated a treaty change with Hawaii, allowing for a naval base at Pearl Harbor.

After his term as Secretary of State, Frelinghuysen returned to Newark, New Jersey, where he died less than three months later. He married Matilda Elizabeth Griswold in 1842, with whom he had six children. Frelinghuysen University in Washington, D.C. was named in his honor in 1917.

==Early life and education==

Frelinghuysen was born in Millstone, New Jersey, to Frederick Frelinghuysen (1788–1820) and Mary Dumont. His father died when he was just three years old, and he was adopted by his uncle, Theodore Frelinghuysen (1787–1862).

His grandfather, Frederick Frelinghuysen (1753–1804), was an eminent lawyer, one of the framers of the first New Jersey Constitution, a soldier in the American Revolutionary War, a member (1778–1779 and 1782–1783) of the Continental Congress from New Jersey, and from 1793 to 1796 a member of the United States Senate.

His uncle, Theodore Frelinghuysen, was Attorney General of New Jersey from 1817 to 1829, was a U.S. Senator from New Jersey from 1829 to 1835, was the Whig candidate for Vice President of the United States on the Henry Clay ticket in the 1844 Presidential election, and was Chancellor of New York University from 1839 until 1850 and president of Rutgers College from 1850 to 1862.

Frelinghuysen graduated from Rutgers College in 1836, and studied law in Newark with his uncle, to whose practice he succeeded in 1839, after he was admitted to the bar.

==Career==
Following his admission to the bar, he became attorney for the Central Railroad of New Jersey, the Morris Canal and Banking Company and other corporations.

===Political career===

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Frelinghuysen was a member of the Whig Party until joining the Republican Party upon its inception. He was also crucial in establishing the Republican Party in New Jersey.

During the American Civil War, Frelinghuysen was active in public office rather than joining the Union Army. He was a delegate in 1861 to the Peace Congress, and appointed Attorney General of New Jersey by Governor Charles S. Olden that year to serve in the post until 1867. Frelinghuysen was encouraged by some to run for governor in 1862, though declined.

Frelinghuysen was a delegate to the 1860 Republican National Convention from New Jersey and from 1861 to 1867 was Attorney General of New Jersey. He was a delegate to the Peace conference of 1861 in Washington, and in 1866 was appointed by the Governor of New Jersey, as a Republican, to fill a vacancy in the United States Senate. In the winter of 1867, he was elected to fill the unexpired term, but a Democratic majority in the New Jersey Legislature prevented his re-election in 1869.

In 1870, he was nominated by President Ulysses S. Grant, and confirmed by the Senate, as United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom to succeed John Lothrop Motley, but declined the mission. From 1871 to 1877 he was again a member of the United States Senate, in which he was prominent in debate and in committee work, and was chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs during the Alabama Claims negotiations.

He was a strong opponent of the Reconstruction measures of President Andrew Johnson, for whose conviction he voted for in Johnson&#x27;s impeachment trial. Frelinghuysen supported the Radical Republicans&#x27; program for Reconstruction that emphasized a harsh treatment of former Confederates. He later allied with the GOP Stalwart faction whose members tended to utilize corruption/patronage effectively, though was considered to have a clean record.

He was a member of the joint committee which drew up and reported (1877) the Electoral Commission Bill, and subsequently served as a member of the Electoral Commission that decided the 1876 Presidential election. As a Republican, he voted with the eight-member majority on all counts.

====U.S. Secretary of State====
On December 12, 1881, he was appointed United States Secretary of State by President Chester A. Arthur to succeed James G. Blaine, and served until the inauguration of President Grover Cleveland in 1885.

Upon taking the post, Frelinghuysen was tasked with resolving a number of consequences resulted by the actions of his predecessor Blaine. Taking a pacifistic and patient approach, he shared the vision held by William H. Seward of the United States dominating the global market in setting an example for other nations to follow, he withdrew the U.S. from the War of the Pacific between Chile and Peru in which his predecessor unsuccessfully backed the Peruvians.

Frelinghuysen&#x27;s other actions included canceling a scheduled Pan-American conference against President Arthur&#x27;s wishes that Blaine had originally planned. In addition, he negotiated a treaty change with Hawaii that allowed for a naval base for the U.S. in Pearl Harbor, which was later known for being bombed by Japan in World War II.

In contrast to his predecessors in the position of U.S. Secretary of State, Frelinghuysen proved unable to urge Great Britain to modify the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty terms in a re-negotiation attempt, and instead pushed through a treaty with Nicaragua that would permit the construction of a canal in the country under joint ownership. However, it was withdrawn later during the presidency of Grover Cleveland by the U.S. Senate, which did not ratify it. Other efforts rejected by Congress included proposals to negotiate reciprocity Spain, Mexico, and Santo Dominigo, in addition to opening an international consortium between the Congo, U.S. and other countries.

Frelinghuysen served in the post until the end of President Arthur&#x27;s term, effectively resigning in early March 1885.

After his term as Secretary of State Frelinghuysen returned to his home in Newark where he died less than three months after retiring.

=== Legacy ===
In 1917, Frelinghuysen University in Washington D.C. was named in honor of his service to African American causes.

==Marriage and children==
On January 25, 1842, Frelinghuysen married Matilda Elizabeth Griswold (1817–1889). She was the daughter of George Griswold, a merchant in New York City who &quot;made an immense fortune in the time of the clipper trade with China.&quot; Together, they were the parents of three daughters and three sons, including:

* Matilda Griswold Frelinghuysen (1846–1926), who married Henry Winthrop Gray (1840–1906), a prominent merchant in 1889.
* Charlotte Louisa &quot;Lucy&quot; Frelinghuysen (1847–1930),
* Frederick Frelinghuysen (1848–1924), who married Estelle B. Kinney, daughter of Thomas T. Kinney, in 1902.
* George Griswold Frelinghuysen (1851–1936), who married Sara Linen Ballantine, granddaughter of Peter Ballantine, in 1881.
* Sarah Helen Frelinghuysen (1856–1939), who first married Judge John J. Davis (1851–1902), the grandson of Massachusetts governor John Davis. After his death, she married Brig. Gen. Charles Laurie McCawley (1865–1935), the son of Charles G. McCawley, the 8th Commandant of the Marine Corps, in 1906.
* Theodore Frelinghuysen (1860–1928), who married Alice Dudley Coats (1861–1889) in 1885. After her death, he married Elizabeth Mary &quot;Lily&quot; (née Thompson) Cannon, a daughter of William G. Thompson and descendant of Elijah Brush, both Mayors of Detroit, and the widow of Henry Lee Grand Cannon.

Frelinghuysen died at Newark on May 20, 1885, aged 67. He was buried at Mount Pleasant Cemetery, Newark. His widow died a few years later in February 1889.

===Descendants===
Through his eldest son Frederick, he was the grandfather of George Griswold Frelinghuysen II, who married Anne de Smolianinof; Estelle C. &quot;Suzy&quot; Frelinghuysen, who married fellow painter George Lovett Kingsland Morris; Frederick Frelinghuysen; Thomas Frelinghuysen; and Theodore Frelinghuysen.

Through his daughter Sarah and granddaughter Mathilda Elizabeth Frelinghuysen (née Davis) Lodge (1876–1960), who married George Cabot Lodge, he was the great-grandfather of Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. (1902–1985), the diplomat and United States Senator from Massachusetts, and John Davis Lodge (1903–1985), also a diplomat, U.S. Representative, and Governor of Connecticut.

<text>The Kannada script (IAST: &quot;Kannaḍa lipi&quot;; obsolete: Kanarese or Canarese script in English) is an abugida of the Brahmic family, used to write Kannada, one of the Dravidian languages of South India especially in the state of Karnataka. It is one of the official scripts of the Indian Republic. Kannada script is also widely used for writing Sanskrit texts in Karnataka. Several minor languages, such as Tulu, Konkani, Kodava, Beary and Sanketi also use alphabets based on the Kannada script. The Kannada and Telugu scripts share very high mutual intellegibility with each other, and are often considered to be regional variants of single script. Other scripts similar to Kannada script are Sinhala script (which included some elements from the Kadamba script), and Old Peguan script
(used in Burma).

The Kannada script ( &quot;akṣaramāle&quot; or &quot;varṇamāle&quot;) is a phonemic abugida of forty-nine letters. The character set is almost identical to that of other Brahmic scripts or often known as Brahmi Lipi. Consonantal letters imply an inherent vowel. Letters representing consonants are combined to form digraphs &quot;(&quot; &quot;ottakṣara)&quot; when there is no intervening vowel. Otherwise, each letter corresponds to a syllable.

The letters are classified into three categories: &quot;svara&quot; (vowels), &quot;vyañjana&quot; (consonants), and &quot;yōgavāhaka&quot; (semiconsonants).

The Kannada words for a letter of the script are &quot;akshara&quot;, &quot;akkara&quot;, and &quot;varṇa&quot;. Each letter has its own form ( &quot;ākāra&quot;) and sound ( &quot;śabda&quot;), providing the visible and audible representations, respectively. Kannada is written from left to right.

==History==
Kannada script or the early Kadamba script evolved from the Ashokan Brahmi script, which later evolved into Kannada-Telugu script, during the period of Chalukyas and later Chalukyas of Vengi. The Kannada and Telugu scripts then separated by around 1300 C.E.

The 11th-century Persian scholar and polymath Al-Biruni calls the Kannada script as &quot;Karnata&quot; alphabets used in &quot;Karnatadesa&quot;

Over the centuries some changes have been made to the Kannada script. These changes consist of:
# Modification of existing glyphs: In the early Kannada script, no orthographic distinction was made between the short mid , and long mid , . However, distinct signs were employed to denote the special consonants viz. the trill the retroflex lateral and the retroflex rhotic , by the 5th century.

==Vowels==
There are thirteen vowel letters ( &quot;svara&quot;) in modern Kannada.
The Kannada script is an abugida, where when a vowel follows a consonant, it is written with a diacritic rather than as a separate letter. There are also three obsolete vowels, corresponding to vowels in Sanskrit.

Written Kannada is composed of akshara or &quot;kagunita&quot;, corresponding to syllables. The letters for consonants combine with diacritics for vowels. The consonant letter without any diacritic, such as , has the inherent vowel . A consonant without a vowel is marked with a &#x27;killer&#x27; stroke, such as . This silencing diacritic and process is known as , whereas the resulting letter is called an ().

Kannada has a phonemic vowel length distinction, so like many other Brahmic scripts, the writing system has two sets of diacritics, one for short vowels and one for long vowels. Short vowels are referred to as , while long vowels are referred to as .


=== Yōgavāha ===
There are two &quot;yōgavāha&quot; (part-vowel, part consonant) letters, known as &quot;ardhavisarga&quot;, used in modern Kannada and two others used in Sanskrit transcription.


== Consonant letters ==

Two categories of consonant letters ( &quot;vyan̄jana&quot;) are defined in Kannada: the structured consonants and the unstructured consonants.

===Structured consonants===
The structured consonants are classified according to their place of articulation, that is, where the tongue touches the palate.

===Unstructured consonants===
The unstructured consonants are consonants that do not fall into any of the above structures:

=== Obsolete Kannada letters ===

Kannada literary works employed the letters (transliterated &quot; or &#x27;rh&#x27;) and (transliterated &quot;, &#x27;lh&#x27; or &#x27;zh&#x27;), whose manner of articulation most plausibly could be akin to those in present-day Malayalam and Tamil. The letters dropped out of use in the 12th and 18th centuries, respectively. Later Kannada works replaced &#x27;rh&#x27; and &#x27;lh&#x27; with (ra) and (la) respectively.

It is still used to write the Badaga language and a vowel + virama + ḻ is used to transcribe its retroflex vowels.

Another letter (or unclassified &quot;vyanjana&quot; (consonant)) that has become extinct is &#x27;nh&#x27; or &#x27;inn&#x27;. Likewise, this has its equivalent in Telugu, where it is called &quot;Nakaara pollu&quot;. The usage of this consonant was observed until the 1980s in Kannada works from the mostly coastal areas of Karnataka (especially the Dakshina Kannada district). Now, hardly any mainstream works use this consonant. This letter has been replaced by (consonant n).

===Consonant conjuncts===

The Kannada script is rich in conjunct consonant clusters, with most consonants having a standard subjoined form and few true ligature clusters. A table of consonant conjuncts follows although the forms of individual conjuncts may differ according to the font.

Of special note is the sequence concerning the letter (ra). Unlike other letters, the conjunct form is written second even if it is pronounced first in the sequence.

For example, the /rnaː/ in the word &quot;Karnāṭaka&quot; (ಕರ್ನಾಟಕ) is written ರ್ನಾ rather than ರ‍್ನಾ.

The nasal consonants (ṅa), (ña), (ṇa), (na), and (ma) are usually written as an anusvara when preceding another consonant rather than a consonant conjunct.

For example, the /ŋg/ in the word &quot;Beṅgaḷūru&quot; (ಬೆಂಗಳೂರು) is usually written rather than (ಬೆಙ್ಗಳೂರು).

The formations shown boldface above are seldom used.

== Numerals ==

The decimal numerals in the script are:

== Transliteration ==

Several transliteration schemes/tools are used to type Kannada characters using a standard keyboard. These include Baraha (based on ITRANS), Pada Software and several internet tools like Google transliteration, Quillpad (predictive transliterator). Nudi, the Government of Karnataka&#x27;s standard for Kannada Input, is a phonetic layout loosely based on transliteration.

==In popular culture==

Due to its resemblance to an eye and an eyebrow, the Kannada letter &quot;ṭha&quot; is used in the &quot;look of disapproval&quot; (displayed as &quot;ಠ_ಠ&quot;), a popular emoticon used to convey disapproval or contempt. Similarly, the akshara &quot;rr̥a&quot; has been used in emoticons to represent a monocle, while &quot;tha&quot; has been used to represent a tearing eye.

==Unicode==
Kannada script was added to the Unicode Standard in October 1991 with the release of version 1.0.

The Unicode block for Kannada is U+0C80–U+0CFF:

<text>In grammar, a phrasecalled expression in some contextsis a group of words or singular word acting as a grammatical unit. For instance, the English expression &quot;the very happy squirrel&quot; is a noun phrase which contains the adjective phrase &quot;very happy&quot;. Phrases can consist of a single word or a complete sentence. In theoretical linguistics, phrases are often analyzed as units of syntactic structure such as a constituent. There is a difference between the common use of the term &quot;phrase&quot; and its technical use in linguistics. In common usage, a phrase is usually a group of words with some special idiomatic meaning or other significance, such as &quot;all rights reserved&quot;, &quot;economical with the truth&quot;, &quot;kick the bucket&quot;, and the like. It may be a euphemism, a saying or proverb, a fixed expression, a figure of speech, etc.. In linguistics, these are known as phrasemes.

In theories of syntax, a phrase is any group of words, or sometimes a single word, which plays a particular role within the syntactic structure of a sentence. It does not have to have any special meaning or significance, or even exist anywhere outside of the sentence being analyzed, but it must function there as a complete grammatical unit. For example, in the sentence &quot;Yesterday I saw an orange bird with a white neck&quot;, the words &quot;an orange bird with a white neck&quot; form a noun phrase, or a determiner phrase in some theories, which functions as the object of the sentence.

==Phrase trees==
Many theories of syntax and grammar illustrate sentence structure using phrase &#x27;trees&#x27;, which provide schematics of how the words in a sentence are grouped and relate to each other. A tree shows the words, phrases, and clauses that make up a sentence. Any word combination that corresponds to a complete subtree can be seen as a phrase.

There are two competing principles for constructing trees; they produce &#x27;constituency&#x27; and &#x27;dependency&#x27; trees and both are illustrated here using an example sentence. The constituency-based tree is on the left and the dependency-based tree is on the right (where adjective (A), determiner (D), noun (N), sentence (S), verb (V), noun phrase (NP), prepositional phrase (PP), verb phrase (VP)):

The tree on the left is of the constituency-based, phrase structure grammar, and the tree on the right is of the dependency grammar. The node labels in the two trees mark the syntactic category of the different constituents, or word elements, of the sentence.

In the constituency tree each phrase is marked by a phrasal node (NP, PP, VP); and there are eight phrases identified by phrase structure analysis in the example sentence. On the other hand, the dependency tree identifies a phrase by any node that exerts dependency upon, or dominates, another node. And, using dependency analysis, there are six phrases in the sentence.

The trees and phrase-counts demonstrate that different theories of syntax differ in the word combinations they qualify as a phrase. Here the constituency tree identifies three phrases that the dependency trees does not, namely: &quot;house at the end of the street&quot;, &quot;end of the street&quot;, and &quot;the end&quot;. More analysis, including about the plausibilities of both grammars, can be made empirically by applying constituency tests.

==Heads and dependents==
In grammatical analysis, most phrases contain a head, which identifies the type and linguistic features of the phrase. The syntactic category of the head is used to name the category of the phrase; for example, a phrase whose head is a noun is called a noun phrase. The remaining words in a phrase are called the dependents of the head.

In the following phrases the head-word, or head, is bolded:

::too slowly — 
::very happy — 
::the massive dinosaur — 
::at lunch — 
::watch TV — 

The above five examples are the most common of phrase types; but, by the logic of heads and dependents, others can be routinely produced. For instance, the subordinator phrase:

::before that happened — 

By linguistic analysis this is a group of words that qualifies as a phrase, and the head-word gives its syntactic name, &quot;subordinator&quot;, to the grammatical category of the entire phrase. But this phrase, &quot;before that happened&quot;, is more commonly classified in other grammars, including traditional English grammars, as a subordinate clause (or dependent clause); and it is then labelled &quot;not&quot; as a phrase, but as a clause.

Most theories of syntax view most phrases as having a head, but some non-headed phrases are acknowledged. A phrase lacking a head is known as exocentric, and phrases with heads are endocentric.

===Functional categories===
Some modern theories of syntax introduce functional categories in which the head of a phrase is a functional lexical item. Some functional heads in some languages are not pronounced, but are rather covert. For example, in order to explain certain syntactic patterns which correlate with the speech act a sentence performs, some researchers have posited &quot;force phrases&quot; (ForceP), whose heads are not pronounced in many languages including English. Similarly, many frameworks assume that covert determiners are present in bare noun phrases such as proper names.

Another type is the inflectional phrase, where (for example) a finite verb phrase is taken to be the complement of a functional, possibly covert head (denoted INFL) which is supposed to encode the requirements for the verb to inflect – for agreement with its subject (which is the specifier of INFL), for tense and aspect, etc. If these factors are treated separately, then more specific categories may be considered: &quot;tense phrase&quot; (TP), where the verb phrase is the complement of an abstract &quot;tense&quot; element; &quot;aspect phrase&quot;; &quot;agreement phrase&quot; and so on.

Further examples of such proposed categories include &quot;topic phrase&quot; and &quot;focus phrase&quot;, which are argued to be headed by elements that encode the need for a constituent of the sentence to be marked as the topic or focus.

==Variation among theories of syntax==

Theories of syntax differ in what they regard as a phrase. For instance, while most if not all theories of syntax acknowledge the existence of verb phrases (VPs), Phrase structure grammars acknowledge both finite verb phrases and non-finite verb phrases while dependency grammars only acknowledge non-finite verb phrases. The split between these views persists due to conflicting results from the standard empirical diagnostics of phrasehood such as constituency tests.

The distinction is illustrated with the following examples:

::The Republicans may nominate Newt. 
::The Republicans may nominate Newt. 

The syntax trees of this sentence are next:

The constituency tree on the left shows the finite verb string &quot;may nominate Newt&quot; as a constituent; it corresponds to VP1. In contrast, this same string is not shown as a phrase in the dependency tree on the right. However, both trees, take the non-finite VP string &quot;nominate Newt&quot; to be a constituent.

<doc id="44980" wikidata="Q504" url="?curid=44980" title="Émile Zola">
<text>Émile Édouard Charles Antoine Zola (, ; ; 2 April 184029 September 1902) was a French novelist, journalist, playwright, the best-known practitioner of the literary school of naturalism, and an important contributor to the development of theatrical naturalism. He was a major figure in the political liberalization of France and in the exoneration of the falsely accused and convicted army officer Alfred Dreyfus, which is encapsulated in his renowned newspaper opinion headlined &quot;J&#x27;Accuse...!&quot; Zola was nominated for the first and second Nobel prizes in literature in 1901 and 1902.

==Early life==
Zola was born in Paris in 1840 to François Zola (originally Francesco Zolla) and Émilie Aubert. His father was an Italian engineer with some Greek ancestry, who was born in Venice in 1795, and engineered the Zola Dam in Aix-en-Provence; his mother was French. The family moved to Aix-en-Provence in the southeast when Émile was three years old. In 1845, five-year-old Zola was sexually molested by an older boy. Two years later, in 1847, his father died, leaving his mother on a meager pension. In 1852, Zola entered the Collège Bourbon as a boarding student. He would later complain about poor nutrition and bullying in school.

In 1858, the Zolas moved to Paris, where Émile&#x27;s childhood friend Paul Cézanne soon joined him. Zola started to write in the Romantic style. His widowed mother had planned a law career for Émile, but he failed his baccalauréat examination twice.

Before his breakthrough as a writer, Zola worked for minimal pay as a clerk in a shipping firm and then in the sales department for the publisher Hachette. He also wrote literary and art reviews for newspapers. As a political journalist, Zola did not hide his dislike of Napoleon III, who had successfully run for the office of president under the constitution of the French Second Republic, only to use this position as a springboard for the coup d&#x27;état that made him emperor.

==Later life==
In 1862 Zola was naturalized as a French citizen. In 1865, he met Éléonore-Alexandrine Meley, who called herself Gabrielle, a seamstress. They married on 31 May 1870. Together they cared for Zola&#x27;s mother. She stayed with him all his life and was instrumental in promoting his work. The marriage remained childless. Alexandrine Zola had had a child before she met Zola that she had given up, because she had been unable to take care of it. When she confessed this to Zola after their marriage, they went looking for the girl, but she had died a short time after birth.

In 1888, he was given a camera, but he only began to use it in 1895 and attained a near professional level of expertise. Also in 1888, Alexandrine hired Jeanne Rozerot, a 21-year-old seamstress who was to live with them in their home in Médan. The 48-year-old Zola fell in love with Jeanne and fathered two children with her: Denise in 1889 and Jacques in 1891. After Jeanne left Médan for Paris, Zola continued to support and visit her and their children. In November 1891 Alexandrine discovered the affair, which brought the marriage to the brink of divorce. The discord was partially healed, which allowed Zola to take an increasingly active role in the lives of the children. After Zola&#x27;s death, the children were given his name as their lawful surname.

==Career==
During his early years, Zola wrote numerous short stories and essays, four plays, and three novels. Among his early books was &quot;Contes à Ninon&quot;, published in 1864. With the publication of his sordid autobiographical novel &quot;La Confession de Claude&quot; (1865) attracting police attention, Hachette fired Zola. His novel &quot;Les Mystères de Marseille&quot; appeared as a serial in 1867. He was also an aggressive critic, his articles on literature and art appearing in Villemessant&#x27;s journal &quot;L&#x27;Événement&quot;. After his first major novel, &quot;Thérèse Raquin&quot; (1867), Zola started the series called .

In Paris, Zola maintained his friendship with Cézanne, who painted a portrait of him with another friend from Aix-en-Provence, writer Paul Alexis, entitled &quot;Paul Alexis Reading to Zola&quot;.

===Literary output===

More than half of Zola&#x27;s novels were part of the twenty-volume cycle, which details the history of a single family under the reign of Napoléon III. Unlike Balzac, who in the midst of his literary career resynthesized his work into &quot;La Comédie Humaine&quot;, Zola from the start, at the age of 28, had thought of the complete layout of the series. Set in France&#x27;s Second Empire, in the context of Baron Haussmann&#x27;s changing Paris, the series traces the environmental and hereditary influences of violence, alcohol, and prostitution which became more prevalent during the second wave of the Industrial Revolution. The series examines two branches of the family—the respectable (that is, legitimate) Rougons and the disreputable (illegitimate) Macquarts—over five generations.

In the preface to the first novel of the series, Zola states, &quot;I want to explain how a family, a small group of regular people, behaves in society, while expanding through the birth of ten, twenty individuals, who seem at first glance profoundly dissimilar, but who are shown through analysis to be intimately linked to one another. Heredity has its own laws, just like gravity. I will attempt to find and to follow, by resolving the double question of temperaments and environments, the thread that leads mathematically from one man to another.&quot;

Although Zola and Cézanne were friends from childhood, they experienced a falling out later in life over Zola&#x27;s fictionalised depiction of Cézanne and the Bohemian life of painters in Zola&#x27;s novel (&quot;The Masterpiece&quot;, 1886).
From 1877, with the publication of &quot;L&#x27;Assommoir&quot;, Émile Zola became wealthy; he was better paid than Victor Hugo, for example. Because &quot;L&#x27;Assommoir&quot; was such a success, Zola was able to renegotiate his contract with his publisher Georges Charpentier to receive more than 14% royalties and the exclusive rights to serial publication in the press. Subsequently, sales of &quot;L&#x27;Assommoir&quot; were even exceeded by those of &quot;Nana&quot; (1880) and &quot;La Débâcle&quot; (1892). He became a figurehead among the literary bourgeoisie and organised cultural dinners with Guy de Maupassant, Joris-Karl Huysmans, and other writers at his luxurious villa (worth 300,000 francs) in Médan, near Paris, after 1880. Despite being nominated several times, Zola was never elected to the .

Zola&#x27;s output also included novels on population (&quot;Fécondité&quot;) and work (&quot;Travail&quot;), a number of plays, and several volumes of criticism. He wrote every day for around 30 years, and took as his motto (&quot;not a day without a line&quot;).

The self-proclaimed leader of French naturalism, Zola&#x27;s works inspired operas such as those of Gustave Charpentier, notably &quot;Louise&quot; in the 1890s. His works were inspired by the concept of heredity and milieu (Claude Bernard and Hippolyte Taine) and by the realism of Balzac and Flaubert. He also provided the libretto for several operas by Alfred Bruneau, including &quot;Messidor&quot; (1897) and &quot;L&#x27;Ouragan&quot; (1901); several of Bruneau&#x27;s other operas are adapted from Zola&#x27;s writing. These provided a French alternative to Italian verismo.

He is considered to be a significant influence on those writers that are credited with the creation of the so-called new journalism: Wolfe, Capote, Thompson, Mailer, Didion, Talese and others.
Tom Wolfe wrote that his goal in writing fiction was to document contemporary society in the tradition of John Steinbeck, Charles Dickens, and Émile Zola.

==Dreyfus affair==

Captain Alfred Dreyfus was a French-Jewish artillery officer in the French army. In September 1894, French intelligence discovered someone had been passing military secrets to the German Embassy. Senior officers began to suspect Dreyfus, though there was no direct evidence of any wrongdoing. Dreyfus was court-martialed, convicted of treason, and sent to Devil&#x27;s Island in French Guiana.

Lt. Col. Georges Picquart came across evidence that implicated another officer, Ferdinand Walsin Esterhazy, and informed his superiors. Rather than move to clear Dreyfus, the decision was made to protect Esterhazy and ensure the original verdict was not overturned. Major Hubert-Joseph Henry forged documents that made it seem as if Dreyfus were guilty, while Picquart was reassigned to duty in Africa. However, Picquart&#x27;s findings were communicated by his lawyer to the Senator Auguste Scheurer-Kestner, who took up the case, at first discreetly and then increasingly publicly. Meanwhile, further evidence was brought forward by Dreyfus&#x27;s family and Esterhazy&#x27;s estranged family and creditors. Under pressure, the general staff arranged for a closed court-martial to be held on 10–11 January 1898, at which Esterhazy was tried &quot;in camera&quot; and acquitted. Picquart was detained on charges of violation of professional secrecy.


In response Zola risked his career and more, and on 13 January 1898 published &quot;J&#x27;Accuse...!&quot; on the front page of the Paris daily &quot;L&#x27;Aurore&quot;. The newspaper was run by Ernest Vaughan and Georges Clemenceau, who decided that the controversial story would be in the form of an open letter to the president, Félix Faure. Zola&#x27;s &quot;J&#x27;Accuse...!&quot; accused the highest levels of the French Army of obstruction of justice and antisemitism by having wrongfully convicted Alfred Dreyfus to life imprisonment on Devil&#x27;s Island. Zola&#x27;s intention was that he be prosecuted for libel so that the new evidence in support of Dreyfus would be made public.

The case, known as the Dreyfus affair, deeply divided France between the reactionary army and Catholic Church on one hand, and the more liberal commercial society on the other. The ramifications continued for many years; on the 100th anniversary of Zola&#x27;s article, France&#x27;s Catholic daily paper, &quot;La Croix&quot;, apologised for its antisemitic editorials during the Dreyfus affair. As Zola was a leading French thinker and public figure, his letter formed a major turning point in the affair.
Zola was brought to trial for criminal libel on 7 February 1898, and was convicted on 23 February and removed from the Legion of Honour. The first judgment was overturned in April on a technicality, but a new suit was pressed against Zola, which opened on 18 July. At his lawyer&#x27;s advice, Zola fled to England rather than wait for the end of the trial (at which he was again convicted). Without even having had the time to pack a few clothes, he arrived at Victoria Station on 19 July, the start of a brief and unhappy residence in the UK.

Zola visited historic locations including a Church of England service at Westminster Abbey. After initially staying at the Grosvenor Hotel, Victoria, Zola went to the Oatlands Park Hotel in Weybridge and shortly afterwards rented a house locally called Penn where he was joined by his family for the summer. At the end of August, they moved to another house in Addlestone called Summerfield. In early October the family moved to London and then his wife and children went back to France so the children could resume their schooling. Thereafter Zola lived alone in the Queen&#x27;s Hotel, Norwood. He stayed in Upper Norwood from October 1898 to June 1899.

In France, the furious divisions over the Dreyfus affair continued. The fact of Major Henry&#x27;s forgery was discovered and admitted to in August 1898, and the Government referred Dreyfus&#x27;s original court-martial to the Supreme Court for review the following month, over the objections of the General Staff. Eight months later, on 3 June 1899, the Supreme Court annulled the original verdict and ordered a new military court-martial. The same month Zola returned from his exile in England. Still the anti-Dreyfusards would not give up, and on 9 September 1899 Dreyfus was again convicted.

Dreyfus applied for a retrial, but the government countered by offering Dreyfus a pardon (rather than exoneration), which would allow him to go free, provided that he admit to being guilty. Although he was clearly not guilty, he chose to accept the pardon. Later the same month, despite Zola&#x27;s condemnation, an amnesty bill was passed, covering &quot;all criminal acts or misdemeanours related to the Dreyfus affair or that have been included in a prosecution for one of these acts&quot;, indemnifying Zola and Picquart, but also all those who had concocted evidence against Dreyfus. Dreyfus was finally completely exonerated by the Supreme Court in 1906.

Zola said of the affair, &quot;The truth is on the march, and nothing shall stop it.&quot; Zola&#x27;s 1898 article is widely viewed in France as the most prominent manifestation of the new power of the intellectuals (writers, artists, academicians) in shaping public opinion, the media and the state.

== The Manifesto of the Five ==
On August 18, 1887, the French daily newspaper &quot;Le Figaro&quot; published &quot;The Manifesto of the Five&quot; shortly after &quot;La Terre&quot; was released. The signatories included Paul Bonnetain, J. H. Rosny, Lucien Descaves, Paul Margueritte and Gustave Guiches, who strongly disapproved of the lack of balance of both morals and aesthetics throughout the book&#x27;s depiction of the revolution. The manifesto accused Zola of having &quot;lowered the standard of Naturalism, of catering to large sales by deliberate obscenities, of being a morbid and impotent hypochondriac, incapable of taking a sane and healthy view of mankind. They freely referred to Zola&#x27;s physiological weaknesses and expressed the utmost horror at the crudeness of La Terre.&quot;

==Death==

Zola died on 29 September 1902 of carbon monoxide poisoning caused by an improperly ventilated chimney. His funeral on 5 October was attended by thousands. Alfred Dreyfus initially had promised not to attend the funeral, but was given permission by Zola&#x27;s widow and attended. At the time of his death Zola had just completed a novel, , about the Dreyfus trial. A sequel, , had been planned, but was not completed.

His enemies were blamed for his death because of previous attempts on his life, but nothing could be proven at the time. Expressions of sympathy arrived from everywhere in France; for a week the vestibule of his house was crowded with notable writers, scientists, artists, and politicians who came to inscribe their names in the registers. On the other hand, Zola&#x27;s enemies used the opportunity to celebrate in malicious glee. Writing in &quot;L&#x27;Intransigeant&quot;, Henri Rochefort claimed Zola had committed suicide, having discovered Dreyfus to be guilty.

Zola was initially buried in the Cimetière de Montmartre in Paris, but on 4 June 1908, just five years and nine months after his death, his remains were relocated to the Panthéon, where he shares a crypt with Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas. The ceremony was disrupted by an assassination attempt on Alfred Dreyfus by , a disgruntled journalist and admirer of Édouard Drumont, in which Dreyfus was wounded in the arm by the gunshot. Grégori was acquitted by the Parisian court which accepted his defense that he had not meant to kill Dreyfus, meaning merely to graze him.

A 1953 investigation by journalist Jean Bedel published in the newspaper &quot;Libération&quot; under the headline &quot;Was Zola assassinated?&quot; raised the idea that Zola&#x27;s death might have been a murder rather than an accident. It is based on the revelation by Norman pharmacist Pierre Hacquin, who was told by chimney-sweep Henri Buronfosse that he intentionally blocked the chimney of Zola&#x27;s apartment in Paris.
Literary historian Alain Pagès believes that is likely true and Zola&#x27;s great-granddaughters, Brigitte Émile-Zola and Martine Le Blond-Zola, corroborate this explanation of Zola&#x27;s poisoning by carbon monoxide. As reported in &quot;L&#x27;Orient-Le Jour&quot;, Brigitte Émile-Zola recounts that her grandfather Jacques Émile-Zola, son of Émile Zola, told her at the age of eight that, in 1952, a man came to his house to give him information about his father&#x27;s death. The man had been with a dying friend, who had confessed to taking money to plug Emile Zola&#x27;s chimney.

==Scope of the Rougon-Macquart series==
Zola&#x27;s Rougon-Macquart novels are a panoramic account of the Second French Empire. They tell the story of a family approximately between the years 1851 and 1871. These twenty novels contain over 300 characters, who descend from the two family lines of the Rougons and Macquarts. In Zola&#x27;s words, which are the subtitle of the Rougon-Macquart series, they are &quot;&quot;L&#x27;Histoire naturelle et sociale d&#x27;une famille sous le Second Empire&quot; (&quot;The natural and social history of a family under the Second Empire&quot;).&quot;

Most of the Rougon-Macquart novels were written during the French Third Republic. To an extent, attitudes and value judgments may have been superimposed on that picture with the wisdom of hindsight. Some critics classify Zola&#x27;s work, and naturalism more broadly, as a particular strain of decadent literature, which emphasized the fallen, corrupted state of modern civilization. Nowhere is the doom-laden image of the Second Empire so clearly seen as in &quot;Nana&quot;, which culminates in echoes of the Franco-Prussian War (and hence by implication of the French defeat). Even in novels dealing with earlier periods of Napoleon III&#x27;s reign the picture of the Second Empire is sometimes overlaid with the imagery of catastrophe.
In the Rougon-Macquart novels, provincial life can seem to be overshadowed by Zola&#x27;s preoccupation with the capital. However, the following novels (see the individual titles in the Livre de poche series) scarcely touch on life in Paris: &quot;La Terre&quot; (peasant life in Beauce), &quot;Le Rêve&quot; (an unnamed cathedral city), &quot;Germinal&quot; (collieries in the northeast of France), &quot;La Joie de vivre&quot; (the Atlantic coast), and the four novels set in and around Plassans (modelled on his childhood home, Aix-en-Provence), (, &quot;La Conquête de Plassans&quot;, &quot;La Faute de l&#x27;Abbé Mouret&quot; and &quot;Le Docteur Pascal&quot;). &quot;La Débâcle&quot;, the military novel, is set for the most part in country districts of eastern France; its dénouement takes place in the capital during the civil war leading to the suppression of the Paris Commune. Though Paris has its role in the most striking incidents (notably the train crash) take place elsewhere. Even the Paris-centred novels tend to set some scenes outside, if not very far from, the capital. In the political novel &quot;Son Excellence Eugène Rougon&quot;, the eponymous minister&#x27;s interventions on behalf of his so-called friends, have their consequences elsewhere, and the reader is witness to some of them. Even Nana, one of Zola&#x27;s characters most strongly associated with Paris, makes a brief and typically disastrous trip to the country.

==Quasi-scientific purpose==
In &quot;Le Roman expérimental&quot; and &quot;Les Romanciers naturalistes,&quot; Zola expounded the purposes of the &quot;naturalist&quot; novel. The experimental novel was to serve as a vehicle for scientific experiment, analogous to the experiments conducted by Claude Bernard and expounded by him in &quot;Introduction à la médecine expérimentale&quot;. Claude Bernard&#x27;s experiments were in the field of clinical physiology, those of the Naturalist writers (Zola being their leader) would be in the realm of psychology influenced by the natural environment. Balzac, Zola claimed, had already investigated the psychology of lechery in an experimental manner, in the figure of Hector Hulot in &quot;La Cousine Bette&quot;. Essential to Zola&#x27;s concept of the experimental novel was dispassionate observation of the world, with all that it involved by way of meticulous documentation. To him, each novel should be based upon a dossier. With this aim, he visited the colliery of Anzin in northern France, in February 1884 when a strike was on; he visited La Beauce (for &quot;La Terre&quot;), Sedan, Ardennes (for &quot;La Débâcle&quot;) and travelled on the railway line between Paris and Le Havre (when researching &quot;La Bête humaine&quot;).

==Characterisation==

Zola strongly claimed that Naturalist literature is an experimental analysis of human psychology. Considering this claim, many critics, such as György Lukács, find Zola strangely poor at creating lifelike and memorable characters in the manner of Honoré de Balzac or Charles Dickens, despite his ability to evoke powerful crowd scenes. It was important to Zola that no character should appear &quot;larger than&quot; life; but the criticism that his characters are &quot;cardboard&quot; is substantially more damaging. Zola, by refusing to make any of his characters larger than life (if that is what he has indeed done), did not inhibit himself from also achieving verisimilitude.

Although Zola found it scientifically and artistically unjustifiable to create larger-than-life characters, his work presents some larger-than-life symbols which, like the mine Le Voreux in &quot;Germinal&quot;, take on the nature of a surrogate human life. The mine, the still in &quot;L&#x27;Assommoir&quot; and the locomotive La Lison in &quot;La Bête humaine&quot; impress the reader with the vivid reality of human beings. The great natural processes of seedtime and harvest, death and renewal in &quot;La Terre&quot; are instinct with a vitality which is not human but is the elemental energy of life. Human life is raised to the level of the mythical as the hammerblows of Titans are seemingly heard underground at Le Voreux, or as in &quot;La Faute de l&#x27;Abbé Mouret&quot;, the walled park of Le Paradou encloses a re-enactment—and restatement—of the Book of Genesis.

==Zola&#x27;s optimism==

In Zola there is the theorist and the writer, the poet, the scientist and the optimist – features that are basically joined in his own confession of positivism; later in his life, when he saw his own position turning into an anachronism, he would still style himself with irony and sadness over the lost cause as &quot;an old and rugged Positivist&quot;.

The poet is the artist in words whose writing, as in the racecourse scene in &quot;Nana&quot; or in the descriptions of the laundry in &quot;L&#x27;Assommoir&quot; or in many passages of &quot;La Faute de l&#x27;Abbé Mouret&quot;, &quot;Le Ventre de Paris&quot; and &quot;La Curée&quot;, vies with the colourful impressionistic techniques of Claude Monet and Pierre-Auguste Renoir. The scientist is a believer in some measure of scientific determinism – not that this, despite his own words &quot;devoid of free will&quot; (&quot;&quot;dépourvus de libre arbitre&quot;), need always amount to a philosophical denial of free will. The creator of &quot;la littérature putride&quot;, a term of abuse invented by an early critic of &quot;Thérèse Raquin&quot; (a novel which predates series), emphasizes the squalid aspects of the human environment and upon the seamy side of human nature.

The optimist is that other face of the scientific experimenter, the man with an unshakable belief in human progress. Zola bases his optimism on &quot;innéité&quot; and on the supposed capacity of the human race to make progress in a moral sense. &quot;Innéité&quot; is defined by Zola as that process in which &quot;se confondent les caractères physiques et moraux des parents, sans que rien d&#x27;eux semble s&#x27;y retrouver&quot;&quot;; it is the term used in biology to describe the process whereby the moral and temperamental dispositions of some individuals are unaffected by the hereditary transmission of genetic characteristics. Jean Macquart and Pascal Rougon are two instances of individuals liberated from the blemishes of their ancestors by the operation of the process of &quot;innéité&quot;.

==In popular culture==

<text> ( , , ), from German (chapel) and (master), literally &quot;master of the chapel choir&quot;, designates the leader of an ensemble of musicians. Originally used to refer to somebody in charge of music in a chapel, the term has evolved considerably in its meaning and is today used for denoting the leader of a musical ensemble, often smaller ones used for TV, radio, and theatres.

==Historical usage==
In German-speaking countries during the approximate period 1500–1800, the word often designated the director of music for a monarch or nobleman. For English speakers, it is this sense of the term that is most often encountered, since it appears frequently in biographical writing about composers who worked in German-speaking countries. During that period, in Italy, the position (Italian: &quot;maestro di capella&quot;) largely referred to directors of music assigned to cathedrals and sacred institutions rather than those under royal or aristocratic patronage.

A Kapellmeister position was a senior one and involved supervision of other musicians. Johann Sebastian Bach worked from 1717 to 1723 as Kapellmeister for Prince Leopold of Anhalt-Cöthen. Joseph Haydn worked for many years as Kapellmeister for the Esterházy family, a high-ranking noble family of the Habsburg monarchy. George Frideric Handel served as Kapellmeister for George, Elector of Hanover (who eventually became King George I of Great Britain).

A Kapellmeister might also be the director of music for a church. Thus, Georg Reutter was the Kapellmeister at St. Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral, Vienna, where his young choristers included both Joseph and Michael Haydn.

Becoming a Kapellmeister was a mark of success for professional musicians. For instance, Joseph Haydn once remarked that he was glad his father (a wheelwright) had lived long enough to see his son become a Kapellmeister. The term also implied the possession of considerable musical skill. When the 18th-century actor and musician Joachim Daniel Preisler heard the famous soprano Aloysia Weber (Mozart&#x27;s sister-in-law) perform in her home, he paid her the following compliment in his diary:
The well-known &quot;Mozardt&quot; is her brother-in-law and has taught her so well that she accompanies from a score and plays interludes like a Kapellmeister.
By the end of the 18th century, many of the nobility had declined in their economic power relative to the newly prosperous middle class. Eventually, the maintenance of a became too expensive for most nobles, which led to a decline in the number of Kapellmeister positions. A well-known instance occurred in 1790, when Prince Anton Esterházy succeeded his father Nikolaus and dismissed almost all of the latter&#x27;s extensive musical establishment. But Prince Anton was hardly alone in doing this; during this same period, &quot;the steady decline in the number of orchestras supported by aristocratic families represented a ... change that affected all composers and their works.&quot; This was a difficult time for musicians, who needed to find new ways to support themselves. For instance, Ludwig van Beethoven (1770–1827) never worked as a Kapellmeister but was supported by a somewhat unreliable combination of noble patronage, publication, and concert income.

===The case of Mozart===
Mozart never was a Kapellmeister in the sense given above. In 1787, he was given a paid position in the court of the Austrian Emperor Joseph II as (chamber composer), but authority in matters musical at the court was exercised primarily by Antonio Salieri. In reviews, diaries, and advertising, Mozart was commonly referred to as . It seems that Mozart&#x27;s prestige, along with the fact that he frequently appeared in public directing other musicians, led to the use of &quot;Kapellmeister&quot; as a term of respect.

In April 1791, Mozart applied to become the Kapellmeister at St. Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral and was designated by the City Council to take over this job following the death of the then-ailing incumbent, Leopold Hofmann. This never took place, since Mozart died (December 1791) before Hofmann did (1793).

==Similar terms and equivalents==
Variant spellings &quot;capellmeister&quot; and &quot;capelle&quot;, to refer to the orchestra or choir, are sometimes encountered in English language works about composers who held the title.

The word specified that the Kapellmeister worked at a nobleman&#x27;s court (); a held a somewhat less senior position.

Equivalent positions existed in other European countries and were referred to with equivalent names. In Finnish &quot;kapellimestari&quot; is still the primary word used of conductors.

==Contemporary usage==
In contemporary German, the term &quot;Kapellmeister&quot; has become less common than (conductor). When used today it designates the director or chief conductor of an orchestra or choir. It suggests involvement in orchestra or choir policy (for example, selecting repertoire, concert schedules, and guest conductors) as well as conducting. In military settings it refers to a bandmaster. The music director of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra traditionally holds the old-fashioned title . In other German opera houses, the term generally refers to a deputy conductor reporting to the (general music director, usually also the chief conductor). An opera company may have several Kapellmeister, ranked as (First...), (Second...), etc.

The conductor Christian Thielemann has offered a nuanced account of the &quot;Dirigent&quot;/&quot;Kapellmeister&quot; distinction in contemporary usage. He suggests that &quot;Kapellmeister&quot; has unfairly acquired a sense of routine or failure to project glamour: &quot;a Kapellmeister now describes a pale, meek figure beating time. A policeman on duty at the podium directing the musical traffic, no more.&quot; In fact, Thielemann, who is fully aware of the historical usage of the term, would himself prefer to be called a &quot;Kapellmeister&quot;: &quot;it implies such virtues as knowledge of a work, great ability, and dedication to the cause of music&quot;.

The term &quot;Kapellmeister Tradition&quot; is commonly used to describe these qualities, as exemplified by such historically important conductors as Otto Klemperer, Clemens Krauss, and Erich Kleiber, in the sense that they have &quot;paid their dues&quot; on their way to international fame.

<text>In probability theory, the Borel–Cantelli [[Lemma_(mathematics)|lemma]] is a theorem about sequences of events. In general, it is a result in measure theory. It is named after Émile Borel and Francesco Paolo Cantelli, who gave statement to the lemma in the first decades of the 20th century. A related result, sometimes called the second Borel–Cantelli lemma, is a partial converse of the first Borel–Cantelli lemma. The lemma states that, under certain conditions, an event will have probability of either zero or one. Accordingly, it is the best-known of a class of similar theorems, known as zero-one laws. Other examples include Kolmogorov&#x27;s zero–one law and the Hewitt–Savage zero–one law.

==Statement of lemma for probability spaces==

Let &quot;E&quot;1, &quot;E&quot;2, ... be a sequence of events in some probability space.
The Borel–Cantelli lemma states:

Here, &quot;lim sup&quot; denotes limit supremum of the sequence of events, and each event is a set of outcomes. That is, lim sup &quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot; is the set of outcomes that occur infinitely many times within the infinite sequence of events (&quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot;). Explicitly,
formula_1The set lim sup &quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot; is sometimes denoted {&quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot; i.o.}, where &quot;i.o.&quot; stands for &quot;infinitely often&quot;. The theorem therefore asserts that if the sum of the probabilities of the events &quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot; is finite, then the set of all outcomes that are &quot;repeated&quot; infinitely many times must occur with probability zero. Note that no assumption of independence is required.

===Example===

Suppose (&quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;) is a sequence of random variables with Pr(&quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; = 0) = 1/&quot;n&quot;2 for each &quot;n&quot;. The probability that &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; = 0 occurs for infinitely many &quot;n&quot; is equivalent to the probability of the intersection of infinitely many [&quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; = 0] events. The intersection of infinitely many such events is a set of outcomes common to all of them. However, the sum ΣPr(&quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; = 0) converges to and so the Borel–Cantelli Lemma states that the set of outcomes that are common to infinitely many such events occurs with probability zero. Hence, the probability of &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; = 0 occurring for infinitely many &quot;n&quot; is 0. Almost surely (i.e., with probability 1), &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; is nonzero for all but finitely many &quot;n&quot;.

== Proof ==

Let (&quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot;) be a sequence of events in some probability space.

The sequence of events formula_2 is non-increasing:
formula_3By continuity from above,
formula_4By subadditivity,
formula_5By original assumption, formula_6 As the series formula_7 converges,
formula_8
as required.

==General measure spaces==

For general measure spaces, the Borel–Cantelli lemma takes the following form:

==Converse result==

A related result, sometimes called the second Borel–Cantelli lemma, is a partial converse of the first Borel–Cantelli lemma. The lemma states: If the events &quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot; are independent and the sum of the probabilities of the &quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot; diverges to infinity, then the probability that infinitely many of them occur is 1. That is:

The assumption of independence can be weakened to pairwise independence, but in that case the proof is more difficult.

The infinite monkey theorem follows from this second lemma.

===Example===
The lemma can be applied to give a covering theorem in R&quot;n&quot;. Specifically , if &quot;E&quot;&quot;j&quot; is a collection of Lebesgue measurable subsets of a compact set in R&quot;n&quot; such that
formula_9
then there is a sequence &quot;F&quot;&quot;j&quot; of translates
formula_10
such that
formula_11
apart from a set of measure zero.

===Proof ===

Suppose that formula_12 and the events formula_13 are independent. It is sufficient to show the event that the &quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot;&#x27;s did not occur for infinitely many values of &quot;n&quot; has probability 0. This is just to say that it is sufficient to show that
formula_14

Noting that:
formula_15 it is enough to show: formula_16. Since the formula_17 are independent:
formula_18
The convergence test for infinite products guarantees that the product above is 0, if formula_19 diverges. This completes the proof.

== Counterpart ==

Another related result is the so-called counterpart of the Borel–Cantelli lemma. It is a counterpart of the
Lemma in the sense that it gives a necessary and sufficient condition for the limsup to be 1 by replacing the independence assumption by the completely different assumption that formula_20 is monotone increasing for sufficiently large indices. This Lemma says:

Let formula_20 be such that formula_22,
and let formula_23 denote the complement of formula_24. Then the probability of infinitely many formula_25 occur (that is, at least one formula_25 occurs) is one if and only if there exists a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers formula_27 such that
formula_28This simple result can be useful in problems such as for instance those involving hitting probabilities for stochastic process with the choice of the sequence formula_29 usually being the essence.

==Kochen–Stone==
Let formula_20 be a sequence of events with formula_31 and
formula_32 Then there is a positive probability that formula_33 occur infinitely often.

===Proof===
Let formula_34. Then, note that 
formula_35
and 
formula_36
Hence, we know that
formula_37
We have that 
formula_38
Now, notice that by the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality,
formula_39
therefore, 
formula_40
We then have
formula_41
Given formula_42, since formula_43, we can find formula_44 large enough so that 
formula_45
for any given formula_46. Therefore, 
formula_47
But the left side is precisely the probability that the formula_48 occur infinitely often since 
formula_49
We&#x27;re done now, since we&#x27;ve shown that formula_50

<text>Chip carving or chip-carving, &quot;kerbschnitt&quot; in German, is a style of carving in which knives or chisels are used to remove small chips of the material from a flat surface in a single piece. The style became important in Migration Period metalwork, mainly animal style jewellery, where the faceted surfaces created caught the light to give a glinting appearance. This was very probably a transfer to metalworking of a technique already used in woodcarving, but no wooden examples have survived. Famous Anglo-Saxon examples include the jewellery from Sutton Hoo and the Tassilo Chalice, although the style originated in mainland Europe. In later British and Irish metalwork, the same style was imitated using casting, which is often called imitation chip-carving, or sometimes just chip carving (authors are not always careful to distinguish the two), a term also sometimes applied to pottery decorated in a similar way.

==Woodwork==
In modern wood carving, the style is also called spoon carving. The style is traditional in the folk art of many countries. Patterns can be free form style or based on geometric figures. In America it is mostly used with basswood, butternut, pine, or mahogany. Chip carving knives can also be used for whittling, cabinet making, and general workbench purposes.

<text>Ryan Wayne White (December 6, 1971 – April 8, 1990) was an American teenager from Kokomo, Indiana, who became a national poster child for HIV/AIDS in the United States after his school barred him from attending classes following a diagnosis of AIDS.

As a hemophiliac, White became infected with HIV from a contaminated factor VIII blood treatment and, when diagnosed in December 1984, was given six months to live. Doctors said he posed no risk to other students, as AIDS is not an airborne disease and spreads solely through bodily fluids, but AIDS was poorly understood by the general public at the time. When White tried to return to school, irate parents and teachers in Howard County rallied against his attendance due to unwarranted concerns of the disease spreading to other students and staff. A lengthy administrative appeal process ensued, and news of the conflict turned White into a popular celebrity and advocate for AIDS research and public education. Surprising his doctors, White lived five years longer than predicted. He died on April 8, 1990, one month before his high school graduation.

During the 1980s, AIDS was largely stigmatized as an illness impacting the gay community. In the U.S., that perception shifted with the media focus placed on White and other prominent heterosexual HIV-infected people such as Magic Johnson, Arthur Ashe and the Ray brothers, although these cases were often framed as &quot;innocent&quot;—a contrast to gay men who were seen as &quot;guilty&quot; subjects. The U.S. Congress passed a major piece of AIDS legislation, the Ryan White CARE Act, shortly after White&#x27;s death, which was signed into law by President George H. W. Bush in August 1990 and reauthorized twice. Through the &quot;Ryan White programs&quot; it funds, the Act has become the largest provider of services for people living with HIV/AIDS in the United States.

==Early life and illness==
Ryan White was born at St. Joseph Memorial Hospital in Kokomo, Indiana, to Hubert Wayne and Jeanne Elaine (Hale) White. When he was circumcised, the bleeding would not stop; when he was three days old, doctors diagnosed him with severe hemophilia A, a hereditary blood coagulation disorder associated with the X chromosome, which causes even minor injuries to result in severe bleeding. For treatment, he received weekly infusions of factor VIII, a blood product created from pooled plasma of non-hemophiliacs, an increasingly common treatment for hemophiliacs at the time.

Healthy for most of his childhood, White became extremely ill with pneumonia in December 1984. On December 17, 1984, during a lung biopsy, White was diagnosed with AIDS. By this time, the scientific community had studied the epidemic in great detail. Earlier that year, HTLV-III was identified and isolated by American research scientists, confirming the work done by French research scientists who called it LAV. A lengthy public battle to determine who should be recognized as the discoverer of the human retrovirus delayed development of a test for what would later be called HIV. White had apparently received a contaminated treatment of factor VIII that was infected with HIV, as did thousands of other Americans with hemophilia and hemophiliacs around the world. At that time, because the virus had only recently been identified and there was no screening of blood products, much of the pooled factor VIII concentrate was tainted. Blood banks and pharmaceutical companies dismissed calls by the CDC to use a hepatitis B test as a surrogate until an HIV test could be developed. Later plasma products were screened and heat-treated to deactivate both HIV and hepatitis. Among hemophiliacs treated with blood-clotting factors between 1979 and 1984, nearly 90% became infected with HIV and/or hepatitis C. At the time of his diagnosis, White&#x27;s T-cell count had dropped to 25 per cubic millimeter (a healthy individual without HIV will have around 500–1,200; below 200 is AIDS-defining in the U.S.). Doctors predicted Ryan White had only six months to live.

After the diagnosis, White was too ill to return to school, but by early 1985 he began to feel better. His mother asked if he could return to school but was told by school officials that he could not. On June 30, 1985, a formal request to permit re-admittance to school was denied by Western School Corporation superintendent James O. Smith, sparking an administrative appeal process that lasted for over nine months.

==Battle with schools==
Western Middle School in Russiaville faced enormous pressure from many parents and faculty to prevent White from returning to the campus after his diagnosis became widely known. In the school of 360 total students, 117 parents and 50 teachers signed a petition encouraging school leaders to ban White from school. Due to the widespread fear and ignorance of AIDS, the principal and later the school board succumbed to this pressure and prohibited re-admittance. The White family filed a lawsuit seeking to overturn the decision. The Whites initially filed suit in the U.S. District Court in Indianapolis. The court, however, declined to hear the case until administrative appeals had been resolved. On November 25, an Indiana Department of Education officer ruled that the school must follow the Indiana Board of Health guidelines and that White must be allowed to attend school.

The means of transmission of HIV had not yet been fully understood by the mid- to late 1980s. Scientists knew it spread via blood and was not transmittable by any sort of casual contact (such as shaking hands or being in the same room), but as recently as 1983, the American Medical Association had thought that &quot;Evidence Suggests Household Contact May Transmit AIDS&quot;, and the belief that the disease could easily spread persisted. Children with AIDS were still rare; at the time of White&#x27;s rejection from school, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention knew of only 148 cases of pediatric AIDS in the United States. Many families in Kokomo believed his presence posed an unacceptable risk. When White was permitted to return to school for one day in February 1986, 151 of 360 students stayed home. He also worked as a paperboy, and many of the people on his route canceled their subscriptions, believing that HIV could be transmitted through newsprint.

The Indiana state health commissioner, Dr. Woodrow Myers, who had extensive experience treating AIDS patients in San Francisco, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention both notified the board that White posed no risk to other students, but the school board and many parents ignored their statements. In February 1986, &quot;The New England Journal of Medicine&quot; published a study of 101 people who had spent three months living in close but non-sexual contact with people with AIDS. The study concluded that the risk of infection was &quot;minimal to nonexistent,&quot; even when contact included sharing toothbrushes, razors, clothing, combs, and drinking glasses; sleeping in the same bed; and hugging and kissing.

When White was finally readmitted in April, a group of families withdrew their children and started an alternative school. Threats of violence and lawsuits persisted. According to White&#x27;s mother, people on the street would often yell, &quot;we know you&#x27;re queer&quot; at White. The editors and publishers of the &quot;Kokomo Tribune&quot;, which supported White both editorially and financially, were also ridiculed by members of the community and threatened with death for their actions.

White attended Western Middle School for eighth grade during the 1985–1986 school year. He was deeply unhappy and had few friends. The school required him to eat with disposable utensils, use separate bathrooms, and waived his requirement to enroll in a gym class. Threats continued. When a bullet was fired through the Whites&#x27; living room window (no one was home at the time), the family decided to leave Kokomo. After finishing the school year, his family moved to Cicero, Indiana, where he began ninth grade at Hamilton Heights High School, in Arcadia, Indiana. On August 31, 1986, a &quot;very nervous&quot; White was greeted by school principal Tony Cook, school system superintendent Bob G. Carnal, and a handful of students who had been educated about AIDS and were unafraid to shake White&#x27;s hand.

==National spokesman==
The publicity of Ryan White&#x27;s story catapulted him into the national spotlight, amidst a growing wave of AIDS coverage in the news media. Between 1985 and 1987, the number of news stories about AIDS in the American media doubled. While isolated in middle school, White appeared frequently on national television and in newspapers to discuss his tribulations with the disease. Eventually, he became known as a poster child for the AIDS crisis, appearing in fundraising and educational campaigns for the syndrome. White participated in numerous public benefits for children with AIDS. Many celebrities appeared with him, starting during his trial and continuing for the rest of his life, to help publicly destigmatize socializing with people with AIDS. Singers John Mellencamp, Elton John and Michael Jackson, actor Matt Frewer, diver Greg Louganis, President Ronald Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan, Surgeon General Dr. C. Everett Koop, Indiana University basketball coach Bob Knight and basketball player Kareem Abdul-Jabbar all befriended White. He also was a friend to many children with AIDS or other potentially debilitating conditions.

For the rest of his life, White appeared frequently on Phil Donahue&#x27;s talk show. His celebrity crush, Alyssa Milano of the then-popular TV show &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot;, met White and gave him a friendship bracelet and a kiss. Elton John loaned Jeanne White $16,500 to put toward a down payment on the Cicero home, and rather than accept repayment, placed the repaid money into a college fund for White&#x27;s sister. In high school, White drove a red 1988 Ford Mustang LX 5.0, a gift from Michael Jackson. Despite the fame and donations, Ryan White stated that he disliked the public spotlight, loathed remarks that seemingly blamed his parents or his upbringing for his illness, and emphasized that he would be willing at any moment to trade his fame for freedom from the disease.

In 1988, Ryan White spoke before the President&#x27;s Commission on the HIV Epidemic. Ryan White told the commission of the discrimination he had faced when he first tried to return to school, but how education about the disease had made him welcome in the town of Cicero. Ryan White emphasized his differing experiences in Kokomo and Cicero as an example of the power and importance of AIDS education.

In 1989, ABC aired the television movie &quot;The Ryan White Story&quot;, starring Lukas Haas as Ryan, Judith Light as Jeanne and Nikki Cox as his sister Andrea. Ryan White had a small cameo appearance as &quot;Chad&quot; in the film, playing a boy who also has HIV and later befriends Haas. Others in the film included Sarah Jessica Parker as a sympathetic nurse, George Dzundza as his doctor, and George C. Scott as Ryan&#x27;s attorney, who legally argued against school board authorities. Nielsen estimated that the movie was seen by 15 million viewers. Some residents of Kokomo felt that the movie was condemning of them for their actions against White. After the film aired, the office of Kokomo mayor Robert F. Sargent was flooded with complaints from across the country, although Robert Sargent had not been mayor during the time of the controversy.

By early 1990, White&#x27;s health was deteriorating rapidly. In his final public appearance, he hosted an after-Oscars party with former president Ronald Reagan and his wife Nancy Reagan in California. Despite his declining health, Ryan White spoke to the Reagans about his date to the prom and his hopes of attending college.

==Death==
On March 29, 1990, White entered Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis with a respiratory tract infection. As his condition deteriorated, he was sedated and placed on a ventilator. Elton John paid him a visit and the hospital was deluged with calls from well-wishers. White died on April 8, 1990.

Over 1,500 people attended White&#x27;s funeral on April 11, a standing-room only event held at the Second Presbyterian Church on Meridian Street in Indianapolis. White&#x27;s pallbearers included Elton John, football star Howie Long and Phil Donahue. Elton John performed &quot;Skyline Pigeon&quot; at the funeral. The funeral was also attended by singer Michael Jackson, and then-First Lady Barbara Bush. On the day of the funeral, Ronald Reagan wrote a tribute to White that appeared in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. Reagan&#x27;s statement about AIDS and White&#x27;s funeral were seen as indicators of how greatly White had helped change perceptions of AIDS.

White is buried in Cicero, close to the former home of his mother. In the year following his death, his grave was vandalized on four occasions. As time passed, White&#x27;s grave became a shrine for his admirers.

==Legacy==
Ryan White was one of a handful of highly visible people with AIDS in the 1980s and early 1990s who helped change the public perception of the disease. Ryan, along with actor Rock Hudson, was one of the earliest public faces of AIDS. Other public figures who were infected with HIV included Keith Haring, Holly Johnson, Freddie Mercury, the Ray brothers, Magic Johnson, Greg Louganis, Arthur Ashe, Liberace, Eazy-E, Tim Richmond, Anthony Perkins, Randy Shilts, Ricky Wilson, Ofra Haza, Robert Reed, and Jerry Smith. Ryan White helped to increase public awareness that HIV/AIDS was a significant epidemic.

Numerous charities formed around White&#x27;s death. The Indiana University Dance Marathon, started in 1991, raises money for the Riley Hospital for Children. Between 1991 and 2022, this event helped raise over $50 million for children at Riley. The money raised has also helped fund the Ryan White Infectious Disease Clinic at the hospital to take care of the nation&#x27;s sickest children. Ryan&#x27;s personal physician, with whom he was close friends, Dr. Martin Kleiman, became the Ryan White Professor of Pediatrics at Indiana University School of Medicine in Indianapolis. In a 1993 interview, prominent gay rights and AIDS activist Larry Kramer said, &quot;I think little Ryan White probably did more to change the face of this illness and to move people than anyone. And he continues to be a presence through his mom, Jeanne White. She has an incredibly moving presence as she speaks around the world.&quot;

In 1992, White&#x27;s mother founded the national nonprofit Ryan White Foundation. The foundation worked to increase awareness of HIV/AIDS-related issues, with a focus on hemophiliacs like Ryan White, and on families caring for relatives with the disease. The foundation was active throughout the 1990s, with donations reaching $300,000 a year in 1997. Between 1997 and 2000, however, AIDS donations declined nationwide by 21%, and the Ryan White Foundation saw its donation level drop to $100,000 a year. In 2000, Ryan&#x27;s mother closed the foundation, and merged its remaining assets with AIDS Action, a larger charity. She became a spokeswoman for AIDS activism and continued to arrange speaking events through the site devoted to her son, ryanwhite.com (no longer online as of October 2020). White&#x27;s high school, Hamilton Heights, has had a student–government-sponsored annual AIDS Walk, with proceeds going to a Ryan White Scholarship Fund.

Elton John has cited White&#x27;s death as the major impetus behind his decision to fight his long-standing alcohol and cocaine addiction; he went into rehab shortly afterwards and later created the Elton John AIDS Foundation. White also became the inspiration for a handful of popular songs. Elton John donated proceeds from &quot;The Last Song,&quot; which appears on his album &quot;The One&quot;, to a Ryan White fund at Riley Hospital. Michael Jackson dedicated the song &quot;Gone Too Soon&quot; from his &quot;Dangerous&quot; album to White, as did 1980s pop star Tiffany with the song &quot;Here in My Heart&quot; on her &quot;New Inside&quot; album. In November 2007, The Children&#x27;s Museum of Indianapolis opened an exhibit called &quot;The Power of Children: Making a Difference,&quot; which features White&#x27;s bedroom and belongings alongside similar tributes to Anne Frank and Ruby Bridges. After Ryan died, Greg Louganis gave his Olympic gold medal to Ryan&#x27;s mother, and it is now part of the display about Ryan at the Children&#x27;s Museum. In April 2015, Greg visited The Power of Children exhibit with Jeanne to see his medal in Ryan&#x27;s recreated room. He said then, &quot;The thing I’ll always remember about Ryan is his courage, strength, and sense of humor...The way Ryan lived his life continues to give me the strength and courage to do things I might not otherwise feel comfortable doing.&quot;

===Ryan White and public perception of AIDS===

In the early 1980s, AIDS was known as gay-related immune deficiency, because the disease had first been identified among primarily homosexual communities in Los Angeles, New York City, and San Francisco. At the start of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the United States, the disease was thought to be a &quot;homosexual problem&quot; and was largely ignored by policymakers. White&#x27;s diagnosis demonstrated to many that AIDS was not exclusive to homosexual men. Lesser criticisms had been made that the disease was a punishment for drug abuse and heterosexual promiscuity, citing &quot;an expensive price to pay for drugs and casual sex&quot;. In his advocacy for AIDS research, White, not gay himself, always rejected any criticism of homosexuality.

White was seen by some as an &quot;innocent victim&quot; of the AIDS epidemic. White and his family strongly rejected the language of &quot;innocent victim&quot; because the phrase was often used to imply that gays with AIDS were &quot;guilty&quot;. His mother told &quot;The New York Times&quot;, 

===Ryan White CARE Act===

In August 1990, four months after Ryan White&#x27;s death, Congress enacted The Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act (often known simply as the Ryan White CARE Act), in his honor. The act is the United States&#x27; largest federally funded program for people living with HIV/AIDS. The Ryan White CARE Act funds several different programs to improve availability of care for low-income, uninsured and underinsured victims of AIDS and their families.

Ryan White programs are &quot;payers of last resort,&quot; which subsidize treatment when no other resources are available. The Act provided some level of care for around 500,000 people a year and, in 2004, provided funds to 2,567 organizations. Ryan White programs also provide funding and technical assistance to local and state primary medical care providers, support services, healthcare providers and training programs.

The act was reauthorized in 1996, 2000, 2006, and 2009. Since the Affordable Care Act of 2010 prohibited discrimination on the basis of health status and expanded access to insurance coverage, some experts debated the need for programs like the Ryan White Act. The Ryan White CARE Act expired in 2013, but individual programs continue to receive congressional funding.

In 2024, over half of the people diagnosed with HIV in the United States (more than 550,000) were provided care and treatment from the funded programs, and 57,000 health care professionals treating people with HIV received education and training.

<text>Pope Nicholas V (; ; 15 November 1397 – 24 March 1455), born Tommaso Parentucelli, was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 6 March 1447 until his death, in March 1455. Pope Eugene IV made him a cardinal in 1446 after successful trips to Italy and Germany, and when Eugene died the next year, Parentucelli was elected in his place. He took his name Nicholas in memory of his obligations to Niccolò Albergati.

The pontificate of Nicholas saw the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks and the end of the Hundred Years&#x27; War. He responded by calling a crusade against the Ottomans, which never materialized. By the Concordat of Vienna he secured the recognition of papal rights over bishoprics and benefices. He also brought about the submission of the last of the antipopes, Felix V, and the dissolution of the Synod of Basel. A key figure in the Roman Renaissance, Nicholas sought to make Rome the home of literature and art. He strengthened fortifications, restored aqueducts, and rebuilt many churches. He ordered design plans for what would eventually be the Basilica of St. Peter.

==Early life==
Tommaso Parentucelli was born in Sarzana, an important town in Lunigiana, to the physician Bartolomeo Parentucelli and wife Andreola Bosi of Fivizzano. The Lunigiana region had long been fought over by competing Tuscan, Ligurian and Milanese forces. Three years before Parentucelli&#x27;s birth, the town was captured from the Florentines by the Genoese Republic. His father died while he was young. Parentucelli later became a tutor, in Florence, to the families of the Strozzi and Albizzi, where he met the leading humanist scholars.

Parentucelli studied at Bologna and Florence, gaining a degree in theology in 1422. Bishop Niccolò Albergati was so awestruck with his capabilities that he took him into his service and gave him the chance to pursue his studies further by sending him on a tour through Germany, France and England. He was able to collect books, for which he had an intellectual&#x27;s passion, wherever he went. Some of them survive with his marginal annotations.

Parentucelli attended the Council of Florence and in 1444, when his patron died, he was appointed Bishop of Bologna in his place. Civic disorders at Bologna were prolonged, so Pope Eugene IV soon named him as one of the legates sent to Frankfurt. He was to assist in negotiating an understanding between the Papal States and the Holy Roman Empire, regarding undercutting or at least containing the reforming decrees of the Council of Basel (1431–1439).

==Papacy==
Parentucelli&#x27;s successful diplomacy gained him the reward, on his return to Rome, of the title Cardinal-Priest of Santa Susanna in December 1446. At the papal conclave of 1447 he was elected pope in succession to Eugene IV on 6 March. He took the name Nicholas in honour of his early benefactor, Niccolò Albergati.
In only eight years, his pontificate delivered important achievements in the political, scientific, and literary history of the world. Politically, he needed to repair relationships which had broken down in the pontificate of Eugene IV. He called the congress which produced the Treaty of Lodi, secured peace with Charles VII of France, and concluded the Concordat of Vienna or &quot;Aschaffenburg&quot; (17 February 1448) with the German King, Frederick III, by which the decrees of the Council of Basel against papal annates and reservations were abrogated so far as Germany was concerned. In the following year he secured a still greater tactical triumph with the resignation of the Antipope Felix V on 7 April and his own recognition by the rump of the Council of Basel that assembled at Lausanne.

In 1450, Nicholas held a Jubilee at Rome, and the offerings of the numerous pilgrims who thronged to Rome gave him the means of furthering the cause of culture in Italy, which he had so much at heart. In March 1452 he crowned Frederick III as Holy Roman Emperor in St. Peter&#x27;s, in what was the last imperial coronation held in Rome.

Within the city of Rome, Nicholas introduced the fresh spirit of the Renaissance both intellectually and architecturally. His plans were of embellishing the city with new monuments worthy of the capital of the Christian world. It was in recognition of this commitment to building that Leon Battista Alberti dedicated to Nicholas V his treatise &quot;De re aedificatoria&quot;.

He is the last pope to date to take the pontifical name &quot;Nicholas&quot;.

===Rebuilding Rome===
His first care was practical, to reinforce the city&#x27;s fortifications, cleaning and even paving some main streets and restoring the water supply. The end of ancient Rome is sometimes dated from the destruction of its magnificent array of aqueducts by 6th-century invaders. In the Middle Ages Romans depended on wells and cisterns for water, and the poor dipped their water from the yellow Tiber. The Aqua Virgo aqueduct, originally constructed by Agrippa, was restored by Nicholas and emptied into a simple basin that Alberti designed, the predecessor of the Trevi Fountain.

He continued restoration of the major Roman basilicas, but also of many other Roman churches including Sant&#x27; Apostoli, Sant&#x27; Eusebio, San Lorenzo fuori le Mura, Santa Maria in Trastevere, Santa Prassede, San Salvatore, Santo Stefano Rotondo, San Teodoro, and especially San Celso. He rebuilt the Ponte Sant&#x27; Angelo which had collapsed in 1450, and supported the redevelopment of the surrounding area as a prestigious business and residential district.

===Arts patron===

Nicholas V&#x27;s major focus was on establishing the Vatican as the official residence of the Papacy, replacing the Lateran Palace. He added a substantial new wing including a private chapel to the Vatican, andaccording to Giannozzo Manetti, biographer of Nicholasplanned substantial changes to the Borgo district. He also laid up 2,522 cartloads of marble from the dilapidated Colosseum for use in the later constructions.

The Pope&#x27;s contemporaries criticised his lavish expenditure on building: Manetti drew parallels with the wealth and expenditure of Solomon, suggesting that Papal wealth was acceptable so long as it was expended to the glory of God and the good of the Church. The decoration of the Niccoline Chapel by Fra Angelico demonstrated this message through its depictions of St Lawrence (martyred for refusing to hand to the Roman state the wealth of the Church) and St Stephen.

Under the generous patronage of Nicholas, humanism made rapid strides as well. The new humanist learning had been hitherto looked on with suspicion in Rome, a possible source of schism and heresy from an unhealthy interest in paganism. For Nicholas, humanism became a tool for the cultural aggrandizement of the Christian capital, and he sent emissaries to the East to attract Greek scholars after the fall of Constantinople. The pope also employed Lorenzo Valla to translate Greek histories, pagan as well as Christian, into Latin. This industry, coming just before the dawn of printing, contributed enormously to the sudden expansion of the intellectual horizon.

Nicholas, with assistance from Enoch of Ascoli and Giovanni Tortelli, founded a library of five thousand volumes, including manuscripts rescued from the Turks after the fall of Constantinople. The Pope himself was a man of vast erudition, and his friend Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini, later Pope Pius II, said of him that &quot;what he does not know is outside the range of human knowledge&quot;. A lifelong bibliophile, he treasured books: while the Vatican library was still being designed and planned, he kept the rarest books near to him in his bedroom, with the others in a room nearby. Often thinking fondly of his former work as a librarian, he once remarked, &quot;I had more happiness in a day than now in a whole year.&quot;

He was compelled, however, to add that the lustre of his pontificate would be forever dulled by the fall of Constantinople, which the Turks took in 1453. Unsuccessful in a campaign to unite Christian powers to come to the aid of Constantinople, just before that great citadel was conquered, Nicholas had ordered 10 papal ships to sail with ships from Genoa, Venice and Naples to defend the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire. However, the ancient capital fell before the ships could offer any aid. The Pope bitterly felt this catastrophe as a double blow to Christendom and to Greek letters. &quot;It is a second death&quot;, wrote Aeneas Silvius, &quot;to Homer and Plato.&quot;

Nicholas preached a crusade and endeavoured to reconcile the mutual animosities of the Italian states, but without much success.

In undertaking these works, Nicholas was moved &quot;to strengthen the weak faith of the populace by the greatness of that which it sees&quot;. The Roman populace, however, appreciated neither his motives nor their results, and in 1452 a formidable conspiracy for the overthrow of the papal government under the leadership of Stefano Porcari was discovered and crushed. This revelation of disaffection, together with the fall of Constantinople in 1453, darkened the last years of Pope Nicholas. &quot;As Thomas of Sarzana&quot;, he said, &quot;I had more happiness in a day than now in a whole year&quot;.

===Slavery===

In late spring of 1452 Byzantine Emperor Constantine XI wrote to Pope Nicholas for help against the impending siege by Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II. Nicholas issued the bull &quot;Dum Diversas&quot; (18 June 1452) authorizing King Afonso V of Portugal to &quot;attack, conquer, and subjugate Saracens, pagans and other enemies of Christ wherever they may be found&quot;. Issued less than a year before the fall of Constantinople, the bull may have been intended to begin another crusade against the Ottoman Empire.
Ownership of the Canary Islands continued to be a source of dispute between Spain and Portugal and Nicholas was asked to settle the matter, ultimately in favor of the Portuguese. The geographical area of the concession given in the bull is not explicit, but historian Richard Raiswell finds that it clearly refers to the recently discovered lands along the coast of West Africa. Portuguese ventures were intended to compete with the Muslim trans-Sahara caravans, which played a key role in the highly profitable Muslim slave trade and also held a monopoly on West African gold and ivory.

The Portuguese claimed territorial rights along the African coast by virtue of having invested time and treasure in discovering it; the Castilian claim was based on their being the heirs of the Visigoths. In 1454 a fleet of caravels from Seville and Cádiz traded along the African coast and upon their return, were intercepted by a Portuguese squadron. Enrique IV of Castile threatened war. Afonso V appealed to the Pope for moral support of Portugal&#x27;s right to a monopoly of trade in lands she discovered.

The papal bull &quot;Romanus Pontifex&quot;, issued on 8 January 1455, endorsed Portuguese possession of Cuerta (which they already held), and the exclusive right to trade, navigation, and fishing in the discovered lands, and reaffirmed the previous &quot;Dum Diversas&quot;. It granted permission to Afonso and his heirs to &quot;... make purchases and sales of any things and goods, and victuals whatsoever, as it may seem fit, with any Saracens and infidels in said regions; ... provided they be not iron instruments, wood used for construction, cordage, ships, and any kinds of armor.&quot;

The bull conferred exclusive trading rights to the Portuguese between Morocco and the Indies with the rights to conquer and convert the inhabitants. A significant concession given by Nicholas in a brief issued to King Alfonso in 1454 extended the rights granted to existing territories to all those that might be taken in the future. Consistent with these broad aims, it allowed the Portuguese &quot;to invade, search out, capture, vanquish, and subdue all Saracens and pagans whatsoever, and other enemies of Christ wheresoever placed, and the kingdoms, dukedoms, principalities, dominions, possessions, and all movable and immovable goods whatsoever held and possessed by them and to reduce their persons to perpetual slavery&quot;. However, together with a second reference to some who have already been enslaved, this has been used to suggest that Nicholas sanctioned the purchase of black slaves from &quot;the infidel&quot;: &quot;... many Guineamen and other negroes, taken by force, and some by barter of unprohibited articles, or by other lawful contract of purchase, have been ... converted to the Catholic faith, and it is hoped, by the help of divine mercy, that if such progress be continued with them, either those peoples will be converted to the faith or at least the souls of many of them will be gained for Christ.&quot;

It is on this basis that it has been argued that collectively the two bulls issued by Nicholas gave the Portuguese the rights to acquire slaves along the African coast by force or trade. By dealing with local African chieftains and Muslim slave traders, the Portuguese sought to become key European players in the lucrative slave trade. The concessions given in them were confirmed by bulls issued by Pope Callixtus III (&quot;Inter Caetera quae&quot; in 1456), Sixtus IV (&quot;Aeterni regis&quot; in 1481), and they became the models for subsequent bulls issued by Pope Alexander VI: &quot;Eximiae devotionis&quot; (3 May 1493), &quot;Inter Caetera&quot; (4 May 1493) and &quot;Dudum Siquidem&quot; (23 September 1493), in which he conferred similar rights to Spain relating to the newly discovered lands in the Americas.

<doc id="44995" wikidata="Q348611" url="?curid=44995" title="Antipope Nicholas V">
<text>Nicholas V, born Pietro Rainalducci (c. 125816 October 1333) was an antipope in Italy from 12 May 1328 to 25 July 1330 during the pontificate of Pope John XXII (1316–1334) at Avignon. He was the last antipope set up by a Holy Roman Emperor.

Rainalducci was born at Corvaro, an ancient stronghold near Rieti in Lazio. He joined the Franciscan order after separating from his wife in 1310, and became famous as a preacher.

He was elected through the influence of the excommunicated Holy Roman Emperor, Louis the Bavarian, by an assembly of priests and laymen, and consecrated at Old St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, Rome, on 12 May 1328 by the bishop of Venice.

After spending four months in Rome, he withdrew with Louis IV to Viterbo, but in December 1328 the papal legate Cardinal Orsini began a campaign against Viterbo and Corneto. Nicholas moved on to Grosseto and then to Pisa, where he was guarded by the imperial vicar. On 19 February 1329, Nicholas V presided at a ceremony in the Duomo of Pisa, at which a straw puppet representing Pope John XXII and dressed in pontifical robes was formally condemned, degraded, and handed over to the secular arm (to be &quot;executed&quot;).

Nicholas V was excommunicated by Pope John XXII in April 1329, and sought refuge with Count Boniface of Donoratico near Piombino. Having obtained assurance of pardon, he presented a confession of his sins first to the archbishop of Pisa, and then at Avignon on 25 August 1330, to John XXII, who absolved him.

He remained in honourable imprisonment in the papal palace, Avignon until his death in October 1333. Despite this reconciliation, memories of him were highly negative in the later 1330s. In a monumental fresco by Buonamico Buffalmacco in the Camposanto Monumentale di Pisa, Nicholas V is depicted in Hell being dismembered and eaten by demons. The inscription describes him as a &quot;friend of Muhammad&quot;, who is shown being tortured at his feet.

<doc id="45002" wikidata="Q679871" url="?curid=45002" title="Systems analysis">
<text>Systems analysis is &quot;the process of studying a procedure or business to identify its goal and purposes and create systems and procedures that will efficiently achieve them&quot;. Another view sees systems analysis as a problem-solving technique that breaks a system down into its component pieces and analyses how well those parts work and interact to accomplish their purpose.

The field of system analysis relates closely to requirements analysis or to operations research. It is also &quot;an explicit formal inquiry carried out to help a decision maker identify a better course of action and make a better decision than they might otherwise have made.&quot;

The terms and stems from Greek, meaning &quot;to take apart&quot; and &quot;to put together&quot;, respectively. These terms are used in many scientific disciplines, from mathematics and logic to economics and psychology, to denote similar investigative procedures. The analysis is defined as &quot;the procedure by which we break down an intellectual or substantial whole into parts,&quot; while synthesis means &quot;the procedure by which we combine separate elements or components to form a coherent whole.&quot; System analysis researchers apply methodology to the systems involved, forming an overall picture.

System analysis is used in every field where something is developed. Analysis can also be a series of components that perform organic functions together, such as systems engineering. Systems engineering is an interdisciplinary field of engineering that focuses on how complex engineering projects should be designed and managed.

==Information technology==
The development of a computer-based information system includes a system analysis phase. This helps produce the data model, a precursor to creating or enhancing a database. There are several different approaches to system analysis. When a computer-based information system is developed, system analysis (according to the Waterfall model) would constitute the following steps:

* The development of a feasibility study: determining whether a project is economically, socially, technologically, and organizationally feasible
* Fact-finding measures, designed to ascertain the requirements of the system&#x27;s end-users (typically involving interviews, questionnaires, or visual observations of work on the existing system)
* Gauging how the end-users would operate the system (in terms of general experience in using computer hardware or software), what the system would be used for, and so on

Another view outlines a phased approach to the process. This approach breaks system analysis into 5 phases:

* Scope Definition: Clearly defined objectives and requirements necessary to meet a project&#x27;s requirements as defined by its stakeholders
* Problem analysis: the process of understanding problems and needs and arriving at solutions that meet them
* Requirements analysis: determining the conditions that need to be met
* Logical design: looking at the logical relationship among the objects
* Decision analysis: making a final decision
Use cases are widely used system analysis modeling tools for identifying and expressing the functional requirements of a system. Each use case is a business scenario or event for which the system must provide a defined response. Use cases evolved from the object-oriented analysis.

==Policy analysis==

The discipline of what is today known as policy analysis originated from the application of system analysis when it was first instituted by United States Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara.

==Practitioners==
Practitioners of system analysis are often called up to dissect systems that have grown haphazardly to determine the current components of the system. This was shown during the year 2000 re-engineering effort as business and manufacturing processes were examined as part of the Y2K automation upgrades. Employment utilizing system analysis include system analyst, business analyst, manufacturing engineer, systems architect, enterprise architect, software architect, etc.

While practitioners of system analysis can be called upon to create new systems, they often modify, expand, or document existing systems (processes, procedures, and methods). Researchers and practitioners rely on system analysis. Activity system analysis has been already applied to various research and practice studies including business management, educational reform, educational technology, etc.
