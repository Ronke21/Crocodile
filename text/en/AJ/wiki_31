<text>William Tecumseh Sherman ( ; February 8, 1820February 14, 1891) was an American soldier, businessman, educator, and author. He served as a general in the Union Army during the American Civil War (1861–1865), earning recognition for his command of military strategy but criticism for the harshness of his scorched-earth policies, which he implemented in his military campaign against the Confederate States. British military theorist and historian B. H. Liddell Hart declared that Sherman was &quot;the most original genius of the American Civil War&quot; and &quot;the first modern general&quot;.

Born in Lancaster, Ohio, into a politically prominent family, Sherman graduated in 1840 from the United States Military Academy at West Point. In 1853, he interrupted his military career to pursue private business ventures, without much success. In 1859, he became superintendent of the Louisiana State Seminary of Learning &amp; Military Academy, now Louisiana State University, but resigned when Louisiana seceded from the Union. Sherman commanded a brigade of volunteers at the First Battle of Bull Run in 1861, and then was transferred to the Western Theater. He was stationed in Kentucky, where his pessimism about the outlook of the war led to a breakdown that required him to be briefly put on leave. He recovered and forged a close partnership with General Ulysses S. Grant. Sherman served under Grant in 1862 and 1863 in the Battle of Fort Henry and the Battle of Fort Donelson, the Battle of Shiloh, the campaigns that led to the fall of the Confederate stronghold of Vicksburg on the Mississippi River, and the Chattanooga campaign, which culminated with the routing of the Confederate armies in the state of Tennessee.

In 1864, when Grant went east to serve as the General-in-Chief of the Union Armies, Sherman succeeded him as the commander in the Western Theater. He led the capture of the strategic city of Atlanta, a military success that contributed to the re-election of President Abraham Lincoln. Sherman&#x27;s subsequent famous &quot;March to the Sea&quot; through Georgia and the Carolinas involved little fighting but large-scale destruction of military and civilian infrastructure, a systematic policy intended to undermine the ability and willingness of the Confederacy to continue fighting. Sherman accepted the surrender of all the Confederate armies in the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida in April 1865, but the terms that he negotiated were considered too generous by U.S. Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, who ordered General Grant to modify them.

When Grant became President of the United States in March 1869, Sherman succeeded him as Commanding General of the Army. Sherman served in that capacity from 1869 until 1883 and was responsible for the U.S. Army&#x27;s engagement in the Indian Wars. He steadfastly refused to be drawn into party politics. In 1875, he published his memoirs, which became one of the best-known first-hand accounts of the Civil War.

==Early life==

Sherman was born in 1820 in Lancaster, Ohio, near the banks of the Hocking River. His father, Charles Robert Sherman, a lawyer who was a justice on the Ohio Supreme Court, died unexpectedly of typhoid fever in 1829. His widow, Mary Hoyt Sherman, remained with eleven children and no inheritance. Nine-year-old Sherman was raised by a Lancaster neighbor and family friend, attorney Thomas Ewing. Ewing was a prominent member of the Whig Party who became U.S. senator for Ohio and the first Secretary of the Interior. Sherman was a 5th cousin 3 times removed of US founding father Roger Sherman.

Sherman&#x27;s older brother Charles Taylor Sherman became a federal judge. One of his younger brothers, John Sherman, was one of the founders of the Republican Party and served as a U.S. congressman, senator, and cabinet secretary. Another younger brother, Hoyt Sherman, was a successful banker. Two of his foster brothers served as major generals in the Union Army during the Civil War: Hugh Boyle Ewing, later an ambassador and author, and Thomas Ewing Jr., who was a defense attorney in the military trials of the Lincoln conspirators. Sherman&#x27;s niece, Euthanasia Sherman Meade, was a pioneering woman physician in California.

===Names===
Sherman&#x27;s unusual given name has always attracted attention. One 19th-century source, for example, states that &quot;General Sherman, we believe, is the only eminent American named from an Indian chief&quot;. According to Sherman&#x27;s &quot;Memoirs&quot;, he was named William Tecumseh because his father had &quot;caught a fancy for the great chief of the Shawnees, &#x27;Tecumseh″&quot;. However, Lloyd Lewis&#x27;s 1932 biography claimed that Sherman was originally named only Tecumseh and that he acquired the name William at the age of nine or ten, when he was baptized as a Catholic at the behest of his foster family. According to Lewis&#x27;s account, which was repeated by later authors, Sherman was baptized in the Ewing home by a Dominican priest who found the pagan name Tecumseh unsuitable and instead named the child William after the saint on whose feast day the baptism took place. Sherman had already been baptized as an infant by a Presbyterian minister and recent biographers believe, contrary to Lewis&#x27;s claims, that he was probably given the first name William at that time. As an adult, Sherman signed all his correspondence, including to his wife, &quot;W. T. Sherman&quot;. His friends and family called him Cump.

===Military training and service===

Senator Ewing secured an appointment for the 16-year-old Sherman as a cadet in the United States Military Academy at West Point. Sherman roomed with and befriended another important future Civil War general for the Union, George Henry Thomas. Sherman excelled academically at West Point, but he treated the demerit system with indifference. Fellow cadet William Rosecrans remembered Sherman as &quot;one of the brightest and most popular fellows&quot; at the academy and as &quot;a bright-eyed, red-headed fellow, who was always prepared for a lark of any kind&quot;. About his time at West Point, Sherman says only the following in his &quot;Memoirs&quot;:


Upon graduation in 1840, Sherman entered the army as a second lieutenant in the 3rd U.S. Artillery and saw action in Florida in the Second Seminole War. In his memoirs he noted that &quot;it was a great pity to remove the Seminoles at all [as Florida] was the Indian&#x27;s paradise&quot; and still had (at the time that Sherman wrote his memoirs in the 1870s) &quot;a population less than should make a good State&quot;. Sherman was later stationed in Georgia and South Carolina. As the foster son of a prominent Whig politician, in Charleston the popular Lieutenant Sherman moved within the upper circles of Old South society.

While many of his colleagues engaged in the Mexican–American War, Sherman was assigned to administrative duties in the captured territory of California. Along with fellow Lieutenants Henry Halleck and Edward Ord, Sherman embarked from New York City on the 198-day journey around Cape Horn, aboard the converted sloop USS &quot;Lexington&quot;. During that voyage, Sherman grew close to Ord and especially to the intellectually distinguished Halleck. In his memoirs, Sherman relates a hike with Halleck to the summit of Corcovado, overlooking Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, in order to examine the city&#x27;s aqueduct design.

Sherman and Ord disembarked in Monterey, California on January 28, 1847, two days before the town of Yerba Buena acquired the new name of &quot;San Francisco&quot;. Sherman and Halleck lived in a house in Monterey, now known as the &quot;Sherman Quarters&quot;, from 1847 to 1849. In June 1848, Sherman accompanied the military governor of California, Col. Richard Barnes Mason, to inspect the gold mines at Sutter&#x27;s Fort. Sherman unwittingly helped to launch the California Gold Rush by drafting the official documents in which Governor Mason confirmed that gold had been discovered in the region.
At John Augustus Sutter Jr.&#x27;s request, Sherman assisted Captain William H. Warner in surveying the new city of Sacramento, laying its street grid in 1848. He also opened a general store in Coloma, which earned him $1,500 in 1849 while his army salary was only $70 a month. Sherman also earned money from surveying and by the sale of lots in Sacramento and Benicia. Even though he earned a brevet promotion to captain in 1848 for his &quot;meritorious service&quot;, his lack of combat experience and relatively slow advancement within the army discouraged him. Sherman would eventually become one of the few high-ranking officers of the American Civil War who had not fought in Mexico.

===Marriage and business career===
On May 1, 1850, Sherman married his foster sister, Ellen Boyle Ewing, who was four years and eight months his junior. Ellen&#x27;s father, Thomas Ewing, was the US Secretary of the Interior at that time. Father James A. Ryder, president of Georgetown College, officiated at the Washington, D.C., ceremony. President Zachary Taylor, Vice President Millard Fillmore and other political luminaries attended the wedding. Ellen Ewing Sherman was a devout Catholic, and the couple&#x27;s children were reared in that faith.

Their eight children were:
* Maria Ewing (&quot;Minnie&quot;) (1851–1913)
* Mary Elizabeth (1852–1925)
* William Tecumseh Jr. (&quot;Willie&quot;) (1854–1863)
* Thomas Ewing (1856–1933)
* Eleanor Mary (&quot;Ellie&quot;) (1859–1915)
* Rachel Ewing (1861–1919)
* Charles Celestine (1864–1864)
* Philemon Tecumseh (1867–1941)
Sherman was appointed as captain in the Army&#x27;s Commissary Department on September 27, 1850, with offices in St. Louis, Missouri. He resigned his commission in 1853 and entered civilian life as manager of the San Francisco branch of the Bank of Lucas, Turner &amp; Co., whose corporate headquarters were in St. Louis. Sherman survived two shipwrecks and floated through the Golden Gate on the overturned hull of a foundering lumber schooner.

Sherman suffered from asthma attacks, which he attributed in part to stress caused by the city&#x27;s aggressive business culture. Late in life, Sherman said of his time in San Francisco, under frenzied real estate speculation: &quot;I can handle a hundred thousand men in battle, and take the City of the Sun, but am afraid to manage a lot in the swamp of San Francisco.&quot;

The failure of Page, Bacon &amp; Co. triggered a panic surrounding the &quot;Black Friday&quot; of February 23, 1855, leading to the closure of several of San Francisco&#x27;s principal banks and many other businesses. Sherman, however, succeeded in keeping his own bank solvent. In 1856, during the vigilante period, he served briefly as a major general of the California militia.

Sherman&#x27;s San Francisco branch closed in May 1857, and he relocated to New York City on behalf of the same bank, travelling on the steamer SS &quot;Central America&quot;. When the bank failed during the Panic of 1857, he closed the New York branch. In early 1858, he returned to California to finalize the bank&#x27;s outstanding accounts there. Later in 1858, he moved to Leavenworth, Kansas, where he worked as the office manager of the law firm established by his brothers-in-law Hugh Ewing and Thomas Ewing Jr. Sherman obtained a license to practice law, despite not having studied for the bar, but had little success as a lawyer.

===Military college superintendent===
In 1859, Sherman accepted a job as the first superintendent of the Louisiana State Seminary of Learning &amp; Military Academy in Pineville, Louisiana, a position he sought at the suggestion of Major Don Carlos Buell and obtained through the support of General George Mason Graham. Sherman was an effective and popular leader of the institution, which would later become Louisiana State University. Colonel Joseph P. Taylor, brother of the late President Zachary Taylor, declared that &quot;if you had hunted the whole Army, from one end of it to the other, you could not have found a man in it more admirably suited for the position in every respect than Sherman.&quot;
Sherman&#x27;s younger brother John was, from his seat in the U.S. Congress, a prominent advocate against slavery. Before the Civil War, however, the more conservative William had expressed some sympathy for the white Southerners&#x27; defense of their traditional agrarian system, including the institution of slavery. On the other hand, he was adamantly opposed to the secession of the southern states. In Louisiana, he became a close friend of professor David French Boyd, a native of Virginia and an enthusiastic secessionist. Boyd later recalled witnessing that, when news of South Carolina&#x27;s secession from the United States reached them at the Seminary, &quot;Sherman burst out crying, and began, in his nervous way, pacing the floor and deprecating the step which he feared might bring destruction on the whole country.&quot; In what some authors have seen as an accurate prophecy of the conflict that would engulf the United States during the next four years, Boyd recalled Sherman declaring:

In January 1861, as more Southern states seceded from the Union, Sherman was required to take receipt of arms surrendered to the Louisiana State Militia by the U.S. arsenal at Baton Rouge. Instead of complying, he resigned his position as superintendent, declaring to the governor of Louisiana that &quot;on no earthly account will I do any act or think any thought hostile to or in defiance of the old Government of the United States.&quot;

===St. Louis interlude===
Sherman departed Louisiana and traveled to Washington, D.C., possibly in the hope of securing a position in the U.S. Army. At the White House, Sherman met with Abraham Lincoln a few days after his inauguration as president of the United States. Sherman expressed grave concerns about the North&#x27;s poor state of preparedness for the looming civil war, but he found Lincoln unresponsive.

Sherman then moved to St. Louis to become president of a streetcar company called the Fifth Street Railroad. Thus, he was living in the border state of Missouri as the secession crisis reached its climax. While trying to hold himself aloof from politics, he observed first-hand the efforts of Congressman Frank Blair, who later served under Sherman in the U.S. Army, to keep Missouri in the Union. In early April, Sherman declined Montgomery Blair&#x27;s offer of the administrative position of chief clerk in the War Department, despite Blair&#x27;s promise that it would be followed by nomination as Assistant Secretary of War after the U.S. Congress assembled in July.

After the April 12–13 bombardment of Fort Sumter and its subsequent capture by the Confederacy, Sherman hesitated about committing to military service. He privately ridiculed Lincoln&#x27;s call for 75,000 three-month volunteers to quell secession, reportedly saying: &quot;Why, you might as well attempt to put out the flames of a burning house with a squirt-gun.&quot; In May, however, he offered himself for service in the regular Army. Senator John Sherman (his younger brother and a political ally of President Lincoln) and other connections in Washington helped him to obtain a commission. On June 3, he wrote in a letter to his brother-in-law: &quot;I still think it is to be a long war—very long—much longer than any Politician thinks.&quot;

==Civil War service==
===First commissions and Bull Run===

Sherman was first commissioned as colonel of the 13th U.S. Infantry Regiment, effective May 14, 1861. This was a new regiment yet to be raised. In fact, Sherman&#x27;s first command was a brigade of three-month volunteers who fought in the First Battle of Bull Run on July 21, 1861. It was one of the four brigades in the division commanded by General Daniel Tyler, which was in turn one of the five divisions in the Army of Northeastern Virginia under General Irvin McDowell.

The engagement at Bull Run was a disastrous defeat for the Union, dashing hopes for a rapid resolution of the conflict. Sherman was one of the few Union officers to distinguish himself in the field and historian Donald L. Miller has characterized Sherman&#x27;s performance at Bull Run as &quot;exemplary&quot;. During the fighting, Sherman was grazed by bullets in the knee and shoulder. According to British military historian Brian Holden-Reid, &quot;if Sherman had committed tactical errors during the attack, he more than compensated for these during the subsequent retreat&quot;. Holden-Reid also concluded that Sherman &quot;might have been as unseasoned as the men he commanded, but he had not fallen prey to the naïve illusions nursed by so many on the field of First Bull Run.&quot;

The outcome at Bull Run caused Sherman to question his own judgment as an officer and the capabilities of his volunteer troops. However, Sherman impressed Lincoln during the President&#x27;s visit to the troops on July 23, and Lincoln promoted Sherman to brigadier general of volunteers effective May 17, 1861. This made Sherman senior in rank to Ulysses S. Grant, his future commander. Sherman was then assigned to serve under Robert Anderson in the Department of the Cumberland, in Louisville, Kentucky. In October, Sherman succeeded Anderson in command of that department. In his memoirs, Sherman would later write that he saw that new assignment as breaking a promise by President Lincoln that he would not be given such a prominent leadership position.

===Kentucky and breakdown===

Having succeeded Anderson at Louisville, Sherman now had principal military responsibility for Kentucky, a border state in which the Confederates held Columbus and Bowling Green, and were also present near the Cumberland Gap. He became exceedingly pessimistic about the outlook for his command and he complained frequently to Washington about shortages, while providing exaggerated estimates of the strength of the rebel forces and requesting inordinate numbers of reinforcements. Critical press reports about Sherman began to appear after the U.S. Secretary of War, Simon Cameron, visited Louisville in October 1861. In early November, Sherman asked to be relieved of his command. He was promptly replaced by Don Carlos Buell and transferred to St. Louis. In December, he was put on leave by Henry W. Halleck, commander of the Department of the Missouri, who found him unfit for duty and sent him to Lancaster, Ohio, to recuperate. While he was at home, his wife Ellen wrote to his brother, Senator John Sherman, seeking advice and complaining of &quot;that melancholy insanity to which your family is subject&quot;. In his private correspondence, Sherman later wrote that the concerns of command &quot;broke me down&quot; and admitted to having contemplated suicide. His problems were compounded when the &quot;Cincinnati Commercial&quot; described him as &quot;insane&quot;.

By mid-December 1861 Sherman had recovered sufficiently to return to service under Halleck in the Department of the Missouri. In March, Halleck&#x27;s command was redesignated the Department of the Mississippi and enlarged to unify command in the West. Sherman&#x27;s initial assignments were rear-echelon commands, first of an instructional barracks near St. Louis and then in command of the District of Cairo. Operating from Paducah, Kentucky, he provided logistical support for the operations of Grant to capture Fort Donelson in February 1862. Grant, the previous commander of the District of Cairo, had just won a major victory at Fort Henry and been given command of the ill-defined District of West Tennessee. Although Sherman was technically the senior officer, he wrote to Grant, &quot;I feel anxious about you as I know the great facilities [the Confederates] have of concentration by means of the River and R[ail] Road, but [I] have faith in you—Command me in any way.&quot;

===Shiloh===
After Grant captured Fort Donelson, Sherman got his wish to serve under Grant when he was assigned on March 1, 1862, to the Army of West Tennessee as commander of the 5th Division. His first major test under Grant was at the Battle of Shiloh. The massive Confederate attack on the morning of April 6 took most of the senior Union commanders by surprise. Sherman had dismissed the intelligence reports from militia officers, refusing to believe that Confederate General Albert Sidney Johnston would leave his base at Corinth. He took no precautions beyond strengthening his picket lines, and refused to entrench, build abatis, or send out reconnaissance patrols. At Shiloh, he may have wished to avoid appearing overly alarmed in order to escape the kind of criticism he had received in Kentucky. Indeed, he had written to his wife that if he took more precautions &quot;they&#x27;d call me crazy again&quot;. Despite being caught unprepared by the attack, Sherman rallied his division and conducted an orderly, fighting retreat that helped avert a disastrous Union rout.

With a heavy rain coming down at the end of the first day of fighting at Shiloh, Sherman came upon Grant standing under a large oak tree, his cigar glowing in the darkness. Heeding, Sherman later said, &quot;some wise and sudden instinct not to mention retreat,&quot; he made a noncommittal remark: &quot;Well, Grant, we&#x27;ve had the devil&#x27;s own day, haven&#x27;t we?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; Grant replied, puffing on his cigar. &quot;Lick &#x27;em tomorrow, though.&quot;

Sherman proved instrumental to mounting the successful Union counterattack of the following day, April 7. At Shiloh, Sherman was wounded twice—in the hand and shoulder—and had three horses shot out from under him. His performance was praised by Grant and Halleck, and after the battle he was promoted to major general of volunteers, effective May 1. This success contributed greatly to raising Sherman&#x27;s spirits and changing his personal outlook on the Civil War and his role in it. According to Sherman&#x27;s biographer Robert O&#x27;Connell, &quot;Shiloh marked the turning point of his life.&quot;

In late April, a Union force of 100,000 men under Halleck, with Grant relegated to second-in-command, began advancing slowly against Corinth. Sherman commanded the division on the extreme right of the Union&#x27;s right wing (under George Henry Thomas). Shortly after the Union forces occupied Corinth on May 30, Sherman persuaded Grant not to resign his command, despite the serious difficulties he was having with Halleck. Sherman offered Grant an example from his own life: &quot;Before the battle of Shiloh, I was cast down by a mere newspaper assertion of &#x27;crazy&#x27;, but that single battle gave me new life, and I&#x27;m now in high feather.&quot; He told Grant that, if he remained in the army, &quot;some happy accident might restore you to favor and your true place&quot;. In July, Grant&#x27;s situation improved when Halleck left for the East to become general-in-chief. Sherman then became the military governor of occupied Memphis.

===Vicksburg===
In November 1862, Grant, acting as commander of the Union forces in the state of Mississippi, launched a campaign to capture the city of Vicksburg, the principal Confederate stronghold along the Mississippi River. Grant made Sherman a corps commander and put him in charge of half of his forces. According to historian John D. Winters&#x27;s &quot;The Civil War in Louisiana&quot; (1963), at this stage Sherman


In December, Sherman&#x27;s forces suffered a severe repulse at the Battle of Chickasaw Bayou, just north of Vicksburg. Sherman&#x27;s operations were supposed to be coordinated with an advance on Vicksburg by Grant from another direction. Unbeknownst to Sherman, Grant abandoned his advance, and Sherman&#x27;s river expedition met more resistance than expected. Soon after, Major General John A. McClernand ordered Sherman&#x27;s XV Corps to join in his assault on Arkansas Post. Grant, who was on poor terms with McClernand, regarded this as a politically motivated distraction from the efforts to take Vicksburg, but Sherman had targeted Arkansas Post independently and considered the operation worthwhile. Arkansas Post was taken by the Union army and navy on January 11, 1863.

The failure of the first phase of the campaign against Vicksburg led Grant to formulate an unorthodox new strategy, which called for the invading Union army to leave its supply train and subsist by foraging. Sherman initially expressed reservations about the wisdom of these plans, but he soon submitted to Grant&#x27;s leadership and the campaign in the spring of 1863 cemented Sherman&#x27;s personal ties to Grant. The bulk of Grant&#x27;s forces were now organized into three corps: the XIII Corps under McClernand, the XV Corps under Sherman, and the XVII Corps under Sherman&#x27;s young protégé, Maj. Gen. James B. McPherson. During the long and complicated maneuvers against Vicksburg, one newspaper complained that the &quot;army was being ruined in mud-turtle expeditions, under the leadership of a drunkard [Grant], whose confidential adviser [Sherman] was a lunatic&quot;. When Vicksburg fell on July 4, 1863, after a prolonged siege, the Union had achieved a major strategic victory, putting navigation along the Mississippi River entirely under Union control and effectively cutting off the western half of the Confederacy from the eastern half.

During the siege of Vicksburg, Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston had gathered a force of 30,000 men in Jackson, Mississippi, with the intention of relieving the garrison under the command of John C. Pemberton that was trapped inside Vicksburg. After Pemberton surrendered to Grant on July 4, Johnston advanced toward the rear of Grant&#x27;s forces. In response to this threat, Grant instructed Sherman to attack Johnston. Sherman conducted the ensuing Jackson Expedition, which concluded successfully on July 25 with the re-capture of the city of Jackson. This helped ensure that the Mississippi River would remain in Union hands for the remainder of the war. According to Holden-Reid, Sherman finally &quot;had as an army commander&quot; with the Jackson Expedition.

===Chattanooga===

After the surrender of Vicksburg and the re-capture of Jackson, Sherman was given the rank of brigadier general in the regular army, in addition to his rank as a major general of volunteers. His family traveled from Ohio to visit him at the camp near Vicksburg. Sherman&#x27;s nine-year-old son, Willie, the &quot;Little Sergeant&quot;, died from typhoid fever contracted during the trip.

Ordered to relieve the Union forces besieged in the city of Chattanooga, Tennessee, Sherman departed from Memphis on October 11, 1863, aboard a train bound for Chattanooga. When Sherman&#x27;s train passed Collierville it came under attack by 3,000 Confederate cavalry and eight guns under James Ronald Chalmers. Sherman took command of the infantrymen in the local Union garrison and successfully repelled the Confederate attack. Following the defeat of the Army of the Cumberland at the Battle of Chickamauga by Confederate general Braxton Bragg&#x27;s Army of Tennessee, President Lincoln re-organized the Union forces in the West as the Military Division of the Mississippi, placing it under General Grant&#x27;s command. Sherman then succeeded Grant at the head of the Army of the Tennessee.

At Chattanooga, Grant instructed Sherman to attack the right flank of Bragg&#x27;s forces, which were entrenched along Missionary Ridge overlooking the city. On November 25, Sherman took his assigned target of Billy Goat Hill at the north end of the ridge, only to find that it was separated from the main spine by a rock-strewn ravine. When he attempted to attack the main spine at Tunnel Hill, his troops were repeatedly repelled by Patrick Cleburne&#x27;s heavy division, the best unit in Bragg&#x27;s army. Grant then ordered Thomas to attack the center of the Confederate line. This frontal assault was intended as a diversion, but it unexpectedly succeeded in capturing the enemy&#x27;s entrenchments and routing the Confederate Army of Tennessee, bringing the Union&#x27;s Chattanooga campaign to a successful completion.

After Chattanooga, Sherman led a column to relieve Union forces under Ambrose Burnside, thought to be in peril at Knoxville. In February 1864, he commanded an expedition to Meridian, Mississippi, intended to disrupt Confederate infrastructure and communications. Sherman&#x27;s army captured the city of Meridian on February 14 and proceeded to destroy 105 miles of railroad and 61 bridges, while burning at least 10 locomotives and 28 railcars. The army took 4,000 prisoners and commandeered many wagons and horses. Thousands of refugees, both black and white, joined Sherman&#x27;s columns, which on February 20 finally withdrew toward Canton.

===Atlanta===

The Meridian campaign marked the end of Sherman&#x27;s brief tenure as commander of the Army of the Tennessee. Sherman had, up to that point, achieved mixed success as a general, and controversy attached especially to his performance at Chattanooga. However, he enjoyed Grant&#x27;s confidence and friendship. When Lincoln called Grant east in the spring of 1864 to take command of all the Union armies, Grant appointed Sherman (by then known to his soldiers as &quot;Uncle Billy&quot;) to succeed him as head of the Military Division of the Mississippi, which entailed command of Union troops in the Western Theater of the war. As Grant took overall command of the armies of the United States, Sherman wrote to him outlining his strategy to bring the war to an end: &quot;If you can whip Lee and I can march to the Atlantic I think ol&#x27; Uncle Abe [Lincoln] will give us twenty days leave to see the young folks.&quot;

Sherman proceeded to invade the state of Georgia with three armies: the 60,000-strong Army of the Cumberland under Thomas, the 25,000-strong Army of the Tennessee under James B. McPherson, and the 13,000-strong Army of the Ohio under John M. Schofield. He conducted a series of flanking maneuvers through rugged terrain against Confederate general Joseph E. Johnston&#x27;s Army of Tennessee, attempting a direct assault only at the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain. The Confederate victory at Kennesaw Mountain did little to halt Sherman&#x27;s advance toward Atlanta. In July, the cautious Johnston was replaced by the more aggressive John Bell Hood, who played to Sherman&#x27;s strength by challenging him to direct battles on open ground. Meanwhile, in August, Sherman &quot;learned that I had been commissioned a major-general in the regular army, which was unexpected, and not desired until successful in the capture of Atlanta&quot;.
Sherman&#x27;s Atlanta campaign concluded successfully on September 2, 1864, with the capture of the city, which Hood had been forced to abandon. After ordering almost all civilians to abandon the city in September, Sherman gave instructions that all military and government buildings in Atlanta be burned, although many private homes and shops were burned as well. The capture of Atlanta made Sherman a household name and was decisive in ensuring Lincoln&#x27;s re-election in November. Sherman&#x27;s success caused the collapse of the once powerful &quot;Copperhead&quot; faction within the Democratic Party, which had advocated immediate peace negotiations with the Confederacy. It also dealt a major blow to the popularity of the Democratic presidential candidate, George B. McClellan, whose victory in the election had until then appeared likely to many, including Lincoln himself. According to Holden-Reid, &quot;Sherman did more than any other man apart from the president in creating [the] climate of opinion&quot; that afforded Lincoln a comfortable victory over McClellan at the polls.

===March to the Sea===
During September and October, Sherman and Hood played a cat-and-mouse game in northern Georgia and Alabama, as Hood threatened Sherman&#x27;s communications to the north. Eventually, Sherman won approval from his superiors for a plan to cut loose from his communications and march south, having advised Grant that he could &quot;make Georgia howl&quot;. In response, Hood moved north into Tennessee. Sherman at first trivialized the corresponding threat, reportedly saying that he would &quot;give [Hood] his rations&quot; to go in that direction, as &quot;my business is down south&quot;. Sherman left forces under Major Generals George H. Thomas and John M. Schofield to deal with Hood; their forces eventually smashed Hood&#x27;s army in the battles of Franklin (November 30) and Nashville (December 15–16).

After the November elections, Sherman began marching on November 15 with 62,000 men in the direction of the port city of Savannah, Georgia, living off the land and causing, by his own estimate, more than $100 million in property damage. At the end of this campaign, known as Sherman&#x27;s March to the Sea, his troops took Savannah on December 21. Upon reaching Savannah, Sherman appointed Private A. O. Granger as his personal secretary. Sherman then dispatched a message to Lincoln, offering him the city as a Christmas present.

Sherman&#x27;s success in Georgia received ample coverage in the Northern press at a time when Grant seemed to be making little progress in his fight against General Robert E. Lee&#x27;s Army of Northern Virginia. A bill was introduced in Congress to promote Sherman to Grant&#x27;s rank of lieutenant general, probably with a view toward having him replace Grant as commander of the Union Army. Sherman wrote both to his brother, Senator John Sherman, and to General Grant vehemently repudiating any such promotion. According to a war-time account, it was around this time that Sherman made his memorable declaration of loyalty to Grant:

While in Savannah, Sherman learned from a newspaper that his infant son Charles Celestine had died during the Savannah campaign; the general had never seen the child.

===Final campaigns in the Carolinas===

Grant then ordered Sherman to embark his army on steamers and join the Union forces confronting Lee in Virginia, but Sherman instead persuaded Grant to allow him to march north through the Carolinas, destroying everything of military value along the way, as he had done in Georgia. He was particularly interested in targeting South Carolina, the first state to secede from the Union, because of the effect that it would have on Southern morale. His army proceeded north through South Carolina against light resistance from the troops of General Johnston. Upon hearing that Sherman&#x27;s men were advancing on corduroy roads through the Salkehatchie swamps at a rate of a dozen miles per day, Johnston &quot;made up his mind that there had been no such army in existence since the days of Julius Caesar&quot;.

Sherman captured Columbia, the state capital, on February 17, 1865. Fires began that night and by next morning most of the central city was destroyed. The burning of Columbia has engendered controversy ever since, with some claiming the fires were a deliberate act of vengeance by the Union troops and others that the fires were accidental, caused in part by the burning bales of cotton that the retreating Confederates left behind them.

Local Native American Lumbee guides helped Sherman&#x27;s army cross the Lumber River, which was flooded by torrential rains, into North Carolina. According to Sherman, the trek across the Lumber River and through the swamps, pocosins, and creeks of Robeson County was &quot;the damnedest marching I ever saw&quot;. Thereafter, his troops did relatively little damage to the civilian infrastructure. North Carolina, unlike its southern neighbor, was regarded by the Union troops as a reluctant Confederate state, having been second from last to secede from the Union, ahead only of Tennessee.
The only general engagement during Sherman&#x27;s marches through Georgia and the Carolinas, the Battle of Bentonville, took place on March 19–21. Having defeated the Confederate forces under Johnston at Bentonville, Sherman proceeded to rendezvous at Goldsboro with the Union troops that awaited him there after the captures of the coastal cities of New Bern and Wilmington.

In late March, Sherman briefly left his forces and traveled to City Point, Virginia, to confer with Grant. Lincoln happened to be at City Point at the same time, making possible the only three-way meeting of Lincoln, Grant, and Sherman during the war. Also present at the City Point conference was Rear Admiral David Dixon Porter. This meeting was memorialized in G. P. A. Healy&#x27;s painting &quot;The Peacemakers&quot;. After returning to Goldsboro, Sherman marched to the state capital, Raleigh, where Sherman sought to communicate with Johnston&#x27;s army regarding possible terms for ending the war. On April 9, Sherman relayed to his troops the news that Lee had surrendered to Grant at Appomattox Court House and that the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia had ceased to exist.

===Confederate surrender===
Following Lee&#x27;s surrender and the assassination of Lincoln, Sherman met with Johnston on April 17, 1865, at Bennett Place in Durham, North Carolina, to negotiate a Confederate surrender. At the insistence of Johnston, Confederate President Jefferson Davis, and Secretary of War John C. Breckinridge, Sherman conditionally agreed to generous terms that dealt with both military and political issues. On April 20, Sherman dispatched a memorandum with those terms to the government in Washington.
Sherman believed that the terms that he had agreed to were consistent with the views that Lincoln had expressed at City Point, and that they offered the best way to prevent Johnston from ordering his men to go into the wilderness and conduct a destructive guerrilla campaign. However, Sherman had proceeded without authority from Grant, the newly installed President Andrew Johnson, or the Cabinet. The assassination of Lincoln had caused the political climate in Washington to turn against the prospect of a rapid reconciliation with the defeated Confederates, and the Johnson administration rejected Sherman&#x27;s terms. Grant may have had to intervene to save Sherman from dismissal for having overstepped his authority. The U.S. Secretary of War, Edwin M. Stanton, leaked Sherman&#x27;s memorandum to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, intimating that Sherman might have been bribed to allow Davis to escape capture by the Union troops. This precipitated a deep and long-lasting enmity between Sherman and Stanton, and it intensified Sherman&#x27;s disdain for politicians.

Grant then offered Johnston purely military terms, similar to those that he had negotiated with Lee at Appomattox. Johnston, ignoring instructions from President Davis, accepted those terms on April 26, 1865, formally surrendered his army and all the Confederate forces in the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. This was the largest single capitulation of the war. Sherman proceeded with some of his troops to Washington, where they marched in the Grand Review of the Armies on May 24.

==Slavery and emancipation==
Sherman was not an abolitionist before the war and, like others of his time and background, he did not believe in &quot;Negro equality&quot;. Before the war, Sherman expressed some sympathy with the view of Southern whites that the black race was benefiting from slavery, although he opposed breaking up slave families and advocated that laws forbidding the education of slaves be repealed. Throughout the Civil War, Sherman declined to employ black troops in his armies.

In his &quot;Memoirs&quot;, Sherman commented on the political pressures of 1864–1865 to encourage the escape of slaves, in part to avoid the possibility that &quot;able-bodied slaves will be called into the military service of the rebels&quot;. Sherman rejected this, arguing that it would have delayed the &quot;successful end&quot; of the war and the &quot;[liberation of] &quot;all&quot; slaves&quot;. According to Sherman:

Tens of thousands of escaped slaves nonetheless joined Sherman&#x27;s marches through Georgia and the Carolinas as refugees. Their fate soon became a pressing military and political issue. Some abolitionists accused Sherman of doing too little to alleviate the precarious living conditions of these refugees, motivating Secretary of War Stanton to travel to Georgia in January 1865 to investigate the situation. On January 12, Sherman and Stanton met in Savannah with twenty local black leaders, most of them Baptist or Methodist ministers, invited by Sherman. According to historian Eric Foner, &quot;the &#x27;Colloquy&#x27; between Sherman, Stanton, and the black leaders offered a rare lens through which the experience of slavery and the aspirations that would help to shape Reconstruction came into sharp focus.&quot;

After Sherman&#x27;s departure the spokesman for the black leaders, Baptist minister Garrison Frazier, declared in response to Stanton&#x27;s inquiry about the feelings of the black community:

Four days later, Sherman issued his Special Field Orders, No. 15. The orders provided for the settlement of 40,000 freed slaves and black refugees on land expropriated from white landowners in South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. Sherman appointed Brig. Gen. Rufus Saxton, an abolitionist from Massachusetts who had previously directed the recruitment of black soldiers, to implement that plan. Those orders, which became the basis of the claim that the Union government had promised freed slaves &quot;forty acres and a mule&quot;, were revoked later that year by President Johnson.

Toward the end of the Civil War, some elements within the Republican Party regarded Sherman as being strongly prejudiced against black people. Sherman&#x27;s views on race evolved significantly over time. He dealt in a friendly and unaffected way with the black people that he met during his career. In 1888, near the end of his life, Sherman published an essay in the &quot;North American Review&quot; defending the full civil rights of black citizens in the former Confederacy. In that essay, Sherman called upon the South to &quot;let the negro vote, and count his vote honestly&quot;, adding that &quot;otherwise, so sure as there is a God in Heaven, you will have another war, more cruel than the last, when the torch and dagger will take the place of the muskets of well-ordered battalions&quot;.

==Strategies==

Sherman&#x27;s military legacy rests primarily on his command of logistics and on his brilliance as a strategist. The influential 20th-century British military historian and theorist B. H. Liddell Hart ranked Sherman as &quot;the first modern general&quot; and one of the most important strategists in the annals of war, along with Scipio Africanus, Belisarius, Napoleon Bonaparte, T. E. Lawrence, and Erwin Rommel. Liddell Hart&#x27;s views on the historical significance of Sherman have since been discussed and, to varying extents, defended by subsequent military scholars such as Jay Luvaas, Victor Davis Hanson, and Brian Holden-Reid.

===Maneuver warfare===
Liddell Hart credited Sherman with mastery of maneuver warfare, also known as the &quot;indirect approach&quot;. In maneuver warfare, a commander seeks to defeat the enemy on the battleground through shock, disruption, and surprise, while minimizing frontal attacks on well-defended positions. According to Liddell Hart, this strategy was most clearly illustrated by Sherman&#x27;s series of turning movements against Johnston during the Atlanta campaign. Liddell Hart also declared that the study of Sherman&#x27;s campaigns had contributed significantly to his own &quot;theory of strategy and tactics in mechanized warfare&quot;, and claimed that this had in turn influenced Heinz Guderian&#x27;s doctrine of and Rommel&#x27;s use of tanks during the Second World War. Another World War II-era student of Liddell Hart&#x27;s writings on Sherman was General George S. Patton, who &quot;spent a long vacation studying Sherman&#x27;s campaigns on the ground in Georgia and the Carolinas, with the aid of [Liddell Hart&#x27;s] book&quot; and later &quot;carried out his [bold] plans, in super-Sherman style&quot;.

===Hard war===

Like Grant and Lincoln, Sherman was convinced that the Confederacy&#x27;s strategic, economic, and psychological ability to wage further war needed to be crushed if the fighting were to end. Therefore, he believed that the North had to conduct its campaign as a war of conquest, employing scorched earth tactics to break the backbone of the rebellion. Historian Mark Grimsley promoted the use of the term &quot;hard war&quot; to refer to this strategy in the context of the American Civil War. Sherman&#x27;s advance through Georgia and the Carolinas was characterized by widespread destruction of civilian supplies and infrastructure. This strategy has been characterized by some military historians as an early form of total war, although the appropriateness of that term has been questioned by many scholars. Holden-Reid, for instance, argued that &quot;the concept of &#x27;total war&#x27; is deeply flawed, an imprecise label that at best describes the two world wars but is of dubious relevance to the U.S. Civil War.&quot;

After the fall of Atlanta in 1864, Sherman ordered the city&#x27;s immediate evacuation. When the city council appealed to him to rescind that order, on the grounds that it would cause great hardship to women, children, the elderly, and others who bore no responsibility for the conduct of the war, Sherman sent a written response in which he sought to articulate his conviction that a lasting peace would be possible only if the Union were restored, and that he was therefore prepared to do all he could do to end the rebellion:


The damage done by Sherman&#x27;s marches through Georgia and the Carolinas was almost entirely limited to the destruction of property. Looting was officially forbidden, but historians disagree on how rigorously this regulation was enforced. Though exact figures are not available, the loss of civilian life appears to have been very small. Consuming supplies, wrecking infrastructure, and undermining morale were Sherman&#x27;s stated goals, and several of his Southern contemporaries noted this and commented on it. For instance, Alabama-born Major Henry Hitchcock, who served in Sherman&#x27;s staff, declared that &quot;it is a terrible thing to consume and destroy the sustenance of thousands of people&quot;, but if the scorched earth strategy served &quot;to paralyze their husbands and fathers who are fighting [...] it is mercy in the end&quot;. One of Sherman&#x27;s tactics was to destroy the railways by pulling up the rails, heating them over a bonfire, and twisting them to leave behind what came to known as &quot;Sherman&#x27;s neckties&quot;. This made repairs extremely difficult at a time when the Confederacy lacked both iron and heavy machinery.

The severity of the destructive acts by Union troops was significantly greater in South Carolina than in Georgia or North Carolina. This appears to have been a consequence of the animosity felt by Union soldiers and officers for the state that they regarded as the &quot;cockpit of secession&quot;. One of the most serious accusations against Sherman was that he allowed his troops to burn the city of Columbia. Some pro-Confederate sources have repeated a claim that Oliver Otis Howard, the commander of Sherman&#x27;s 15th Corps, said in 1867 that &quot;It is useless to deny that our troops burnt Columbia, for I saw them in the act.&quot; Sherman stated that &quot;[i]f I had made up my mind to burn Columbia I would have burnt it with no more feeling than I would a common prairie dog village; but I did not do it&quot;. Sherman&#x27;s official report on the burning placed the blame on Confederate Lieutenant General Wade Hampton, who Sherman said had ordered the burning of cotton in the streets. In his memoirs, Sherman said, &quot;In my official report of this conflagration, I distinctly charged it to General Wade Hampton, and confess I did so pointedly, to shake the faith of his people in him, for he was in my opinion boastful, and professed to be the special champion of South Carolina.&quot; Historian James M. McPherson has concluded that:

In this general connection, Sherman and his subordinates (particularly John A. Logan) took steps to protect Raleigh, North Carolina, from acts of revenge after the assassination of President Lincoln.

==Postwar service==

In May 1865, after the major Confederate armies had surrendered, Sherman wrote in a personal letter:
In June 1865, two months after Lee&#x27;s surrender at Appomattox, Sherman received his first postwar command, originally called the Military Division of the Mississippi, later the Military Division of the Missouri, which came to comprise the territory between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains. Sherman&#x27;s efforts in that position were focused on protecting the main wagon roads, such as the Oregon, Bozeman, and Santa Fe Trails. Tasked with guarding a vast territory with limited forces, Sherman grew weary of the multitude of requests for military protection addressed to him. On July 25, 1866, the U.S. Congress created the new rank of General of the Army for Grant, while also promoting Sherman to Grant&#x27;s previous rank of lieutenant general.

===Indian Wars===
There was little large-scale military action against the Indians during the first three years of Sherman&#x27;s tenure as divisional commander, as Sherman allowed negotiations between the U.S. government and Indian leaders to proceed, while he built up his troops and awaited completion of the Union Pacific and Kansas Pacific Railroads. During this time, he was a member of the Indian Peace Commission. Though the commission was responsible for the negotiation of the Medicine Lodge Treaty and the Treaty of Fort Laramie, Sherman did not have a significant role in the drafting of those treaties because in both cases he was called away to Washington during the negotiations. In one instance, he was summoned to testify as a witness in the impeachment of Andrew Johnson. He testified in the trial on April 11 and 13, 1868. He successfully negotiated other treaties, such as the removal of Navajos from the Bosque Redondo to traditional lands in Western New Mexico.
When the Medicine Lodge Treaty failed in 1868, Sherman authorized his subordinate in Missouri, Major General Philip Sheridan, to lead the winter campaign of 1868–1869, of which the Battle of Washita River was part. Sheridan used hard-war tactics similar to those he and Sherman had employed in the Civil War. In 1871, Sherman ordered that the leaders of the Warren Wagon Train raid, an attack by a Kiowa and Comanche war party from which Sherman himself had narrowly escaped, be tried for murder in Jacksboro, Texas. The resulting trial of Satanta and Big Tree marked the first occasion in which Native American chiefs were tried by a civilian court in the United States.

Sherman regarded the expansion of the railroad system &quot;as the most important element now in progress to facilitate the military interests of our Frontier&quot;. One of the main concerns of his postwar service was, therefore, to protect the construction and operation of the railroads from hostile Indians. Sherman&#x27;s views on Indian matters were often strongly expressed. Following the 1866 Fetterman Massacre, in which 81 U.S. soldiers were ambushed and killed by Native American warriors, Sherman telegraphed Grant that &quot;we must act with vindictive earnestness against the Sioux, even to their extermination, men, women and children&quot;. In 1867, he wrote to Grant that &quot;we are not going to let a few thieving, ragged Indians check and stop the progress&quot; of the railroads. In 1873, Sherman wrote in a private letter that &quot;during an assault, the soldiers can not pause to distinguish between male and female, or even discriminate as to age. As long as resistance is made, death must be meted out, but the moment all resistance ceases, the firing will stop and all survivors turned over to the proper Indian agent&quot;.

Displacement of the Plains Indians was facilitated by the growth of the railroads and the eradication of the bison. Sherman believed that bison eradication should be encouraged as a means of weakening Indian resistance to assimilation. He voiced this view in remarks to a joint session of the Texas legislature in 1875, although the U.S. Army under Sherman&#x27;s command never conducted its own program of bison extermination. Sherman encouraged bison hunting by private citizens and, when Congress passed a law in 1874 to protect the bison from over-hunting, Sherman helped convince President Grant to use a pocket veto to prevent it from coming into force.

===General of the Army===

When Grant became president in 1869, Sherman was appointed Commanding General of the United States Army and promoted to the rank of full general. After the death of John A. Rawlins, Sherman also served for one month as acting Secretary of War.

Sherman&#x27;s early tenure as Commanding General was marred by political difficulties, many of which stemmed from disagreements with Secretary of War Rawlins and his successor, William W. Belknap, both of whom Sherman felt had assumed too much power over the army and reduced the position of Commanding General to a sinecure. Sherman also clashed with Eastern humanitarians who were critical of the army&#x27;s harsh treatment of the Indians and who had apparently found an ally in President Grant. To escape from these difficulties, Sherman moved his headquarters to St. Louis in 1874. He returned to Washington in 1876, when the new Secretary of War, Alphonso Taft, promised him greater authority.

Much of Sherman&#x27;s time as Commanding General was devoted to making the Western and Plains states safe for settlement through the continuation of the Indian Wars, which included three significant campaigns: the Modoc War, the Great Sioux War of 1876, and the Nez Perce War. Despite his harsh treatment of the warring tribes, Sherman spoke out against speculators and government agents who abused the Native Americans living within the reservations. During this time, Sherman also reorganized the U.S. Army forts to better accommodate the shifting frontier.

In 1875, ten years after the end of the Civil War, Sherman became one of the first Civil War generals to publish his memoirs. The &quot;Memoirs of General William T. Sherman. By Himself&quot;, published by D. Appleton &amp; Company in two volumes, began with the year 1846 (when the Mexican War began) and ended with a chapter about the &quot;military lessons of the [civil] war&quot;. The publication of Sherman&#x27;s memoirs sparked controversy and drew complaints from many quarters. Grant, who was president when Sherman&#x27;s memoirs appeared, later remarked that others had told him that Sherman treated Grant unfairly but &quot;when I finished the book, I found I approved every word; that ... it was a true book, an honorable book, creditable to Sherman, just to his companions—to myself particularly so—just such a book as I expected Sherman would write.&quot;

According to critic Edmund Wilson, Sherman:


During the election of 1876, Southern Democrats who supported Wade Hampton for governor used mob violence to attack and intimidate African American voters in Charleston. Republican Governor Daniel Henry Chamberlain appealed to President Grant for military assistance. In October 1876, Grant, after issuing a proclamation, instructed Sherman to gather all available Atlantic region troops and dispatch them to South Carolina to stop the mob violence.

On June 19, 1879, Sherman delivered a wholly inspirational address to the graduating class of the Michigan Military Academy, in which he did not use the word hell, nor mention the horrors of war. However, on August 12, 1880, he addressed a crowd of more than 10,000 in Columbus, Ohio: &quot;There is many a boy here today who looks on war as all glory, but, boys, it is all hell.&quot; One month later a reporter for the Columbus Dispatch simplified those words to &quot;Gen. Sherman said war was hell&quot;. By June 1881 it had become mainstream that General Sherman had said &quot;War is hell&quot;.

In 1880, Sherman organized and accompanied President Rutherford B. Hayes&#x27; tour of the West Coast of the United States, the first undertaken by a president. One of Sherman&#x27;s significant contributions as head of the Army was the establishment of the Command School (now the Command and General Staff College) at Fort Leavenworth in 1881. Sherman stepped down as commanding general on November 1, 1883, and retired from the army on February 8, 1884, at the then-mandatory retirement age of 64.

==Final years==

Sherman lived most of the rest of his life in New York City. He was devoted to the theater and to amateur painting and was in demand as a colorful speaker at dinners and banquets, in which he indulged a fondness for quoting Shakespeare. During this period, he remained in contact with war veterans, and he was an active member of various social and charitable organizations.

Proposed as a Republican candidate for the presidential election of 1884, Sherman declined as emphatically as possible, saying, &quot;I will not accept if nominated and will not serve if elected.&quot; Such a categorical rejection of a candidacy is now referred to as a &quot;Shermanesque statement&quot;.

In 1886, after the publication of Grant&#x27;s memoirs, Sherman produced a &quot;second edition, revised and corrected&quot; of his own memoirs. This new edition, published by Appleton, added a second preface, a chapter about his life up to 1846, a chapter concerning the post-war period (ending with his 1884 retirement from the army), several appendices, portraits, improved maps, and an index. For the most part, Sherman refused to revise his original text on the ground that &quot;I disclaim the character of historian, but assume to be a witness on the stand before the great tribunal of history&quot; and &quot;any witness who may disagree with me should publish his own version of [the] facts in the truthful narration of which he is interested&quot;. However, Sherman did include the views of some others in the appendices to the new edition.

===Death===

Sherman died of pneumonia in New York City at 1:50 PM on February 14, 1891, six days after his 71st birthday. President Benjamin Harrison, who served under Sherman, sent a telegram to Sherman&#x27;s family and ordered all national flags to be flown at half staff. Harrison, in a message to the Senate and the House of Representatives, wrote that:

On February 19, a funeral service was held at his home, followed by a military procession. Joseph E. Johnston, the Confederate officer who had commanded the resistance to Sherman&#x27;s troops in Georgia and the Carolinas, served as a pallbearer in New York City. It was a bitterly cold day and a friend of Johnston, fearing that the general might become ill, asked him to put on his hat. Johnston replied: &quot;If I were in [Sherman&#x27;s] place, and he were standing in mine, he would not put on his hat.&quot; Johnston did catch a serious cold and died one month later of pneumonia.

Sherman&#x27;s body was then transported to St. Louis, where another service was conducted at a local Catholic church on February 21, 1891. His son, Thomas Ewing Sherman, who was a Jesuit priest, presided over his father&#x27;s funeral masses in New York City and in St. Louis. Former U.S. president and Civil War veteran Rutherford B. Hayes, who attended both ceremonies, said at the time that Sherman had been &quot;the most interesting and original character in the world.&quot; He is buried in Calvary Cemetery in St. Louis.

==Religious views==
Sherman&#x27;s birth family was Presbyterian and he was originally baptized as such. His foster mother, Maria Ewing, was devoutly Catholic and raised her own children in that faith. Sherman was re-baptized as a Catholic, but Maria&#x27;s husband, Senator Thomas Ewing, insisted that the young Sherman not be compelled to practice Catholicism. Sherman observed but did not join in the religious ceremonies of the Ewing household. He later married his foster sister Ellen, who was also a devout Catholic. In 1864, she took up temporary residence in South Bend, Indiana in order to have her young family educated at the University of Notre Dame and St. Mary&#x27;s College, both Catholic institutions.

Sherman wrote to his wife in 1842: &quot;I believe in good works rather than faith.&quot; In letters written in 1865 to Thomas, his eldest surviving son, General Sherman said &quot;I don&#x27;t want you to be a soldier or a priest, but a good useful man&quot;, and complained that Thomas&#x27;s mother Ellen &quot;thinks religion is so important that everything else must give way to it&quot;. Thomas&#x27;s decision to abandon his career as a lawyer in 1878 to join the Jesuits and prepare for the Catholic priesthood caused Sherman profound distress, and he referred to it as a &quot;great calamity&quot;. Father and son, however, were reconciled when Thomas returned to the United States in August 1880, after having travelled to England for his religious instruction.

Some modern historians have characterized Sherman as a deist in the manner of Thomas Jefferson, while others identify him as an agnostic who accepted many Christian values but lacked faith. Except during the personal crisis triggered by his son Thomas&#x27;s decision to become a priest, Sherman&#x27;s personal attitude toward the Catholic Church was tolerant and even friendly at a time when anti-Catholic prejudice was common in the United States. In 1888, Sherman wrote publicly that &quot;my immediate family are strongly Catholic. I am &quot;not&quot; and cannot be.&quot; Upon Sherman&#x27;s death, his son Thomas publicly declared: &quot;My father was baptized in the Catholic Church, married in the Catholic Church, and attended the Catholic Church until the outbreak of the civil war. Since that time he has not been a communicant of any church.&quot;

==Historical reputation==
In the years immediately after the war, Sherman was popular in the North and well regarded by his own soldiers. At the same time, he was generally respected in the South as a military man, while his conservative politics were attractive to many white Southerners. By the 1880s, however, Southern &quot;Lost Cause&quot; writers began to demonize Sherman for his attacks on civilians in Georgia and South Carolina. The magazine &quot;Confederate Veteran&quot;, based in Nashville, dedicated more attention to Sherman than to any other Union general, in part to enhance the visibility of the Civil War&#x27;s western theater. In this new discourse, Sherman&#x27;s devastation of railroads and plantations mattered less than his perceived insults to southern dignity and especially to its unprotected white womanhood. Sherman was thus presented by Lost-Cause authors as the antithesis of the Southern ideals of chivalry supposedly embodied by General Lee.

In the early 20th century, Sherman&#x27;s role in the Civil War attracted attention from influential British military intellectuals, including Field Marshal Lord Wolseley, Maj. Gen. J. F. C. Fuller, and especially Capt. Liddell Hart. American historian Wesley Moody has argued that these commentators tended to filter Sherman&#x27;s actions and his hard-war strategy through their own ideas about modern warfare, thereby contributing to the exaggeration of his &quot;atrocities&quot; and unintentionally feeding into the negative assessment of Sherman&#x27;s moral character associated with the &quot;Lost Cause&quot; school of Southern historiography. This led to the publication of several works, notably John B. Walters&#x27;s &quot;Merchant of Terror: General Sherman and Total War&quot; (1973), that presented Sherman as responsible for &quot;a mode of warfare which transgressed all ethical rules and showed an utter disregard for human rights and dignity.&quot; Following Walters, James Reston Jr. argued in 1984 that Sherman had planted the &quot;seed for the Agent Orange and Agent Blue programs of food deprivation in Vietnam&quot;. More recently, historians such as Brian Holden-Reid have challenged such readings of Sherman&#x27;s record and of his contributions to modern warfare.

The influential literary critic Edmund Wilson found in Sherman&#x27;s &quot;Memoirs&quot; a fascinating and disturbing account of an &quot;appetite for warfare&quot; that &quot;grows as it feeds on the South&quot;. Former U.S. Defense Secretary Robert McNamara refers equivocally to the statement that &quot;war is cruelty and you cannot refine it&quot; in both the book &quot;Wilson&#x27;s Ghost&quot; and in his interview for the documentary film &quot;The Fog of War&quot; (2003). When comparing Sherman&#x27;s scorched-earth campaigns to the actions of the British Army during the Second Boer War (1899–1902)—another war in which civilians were targeted because of their central role in sustaining a belligerent power—South African historian Hermann Giliomee claims that it &quot;looks as if Sherman struck a better balance than the British commanders between severity and restraint in taking actions proportional to legitimate needs&quot;. The admiration of scholars such as B. H. Liddell Hart, Lloyd Lewis, Victor Davis Hanson, John F. Marszalek, and Brian Holden-Reid for Sherman owes much to what they see as an approach to the exigencies of modern armed conflict that was both effective and principled.

==Monuments and tributes==

The gilded bronze Sherman Memorial (1902) by Augustus Saint-Gaudens stands at the Grand Army Plaza near the main entrance to New York City&#x27;s Central Park. Sherman is represented astride his horse Ontario and led by a winged female figure of &quot;Victory&quot;. Saint-Gaudens&#x27;s &quot;Bust of William Tecumseh Sherman&quot;, which he used as the basis for the larger Memorial, is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Arlington National Cemetery features a smaller version of Saint-Gaudens&#x27;s statue of &quot;Victory&quot;.

The General William Tecumseh Sherman Monument (1903) by Carl Rohl-Smith stands near President&#x27;s Park in Washington, D.C. The bronze monument consists of an equestrian statue of Sherman and a platform with a soldier at each corner, representing the infantry, artillery, cavalry, and engineer branches of the U.S. Army. The site was chosen because Sherman was reported to have stood there while reviewing returning Civil War troops in May 1865.

Other posthumous tributes include Sherman Circle in the Petworth neighborhood of Washington, D.C., the M4 Sherman tank, which was named by the British during World War II, and the &quot;General Sherman&quot; Giant Sequoia tree, which is the most massive documented single-trunk tree in the world.

There are only a few Generals of the US Army who are honored on a US postage stamp, and even fewer who appear more than twice as General Sherman has. The first postage stamp to honor Sherman was released to the public by the US Post Office on February 22, 1893, a little more than two years after his death, on Washington&#x27;s birthday.

<doc id="46721" wikidata="Q20875" url="?curid=46721" title="Edward VII">
<text>Edward VII (Albert Edward; 9 November 1841 – 6 May 1910) was King of the United Kingdom and the British Dominions, and Emperor of India, from 22 January 1901 until his death in 1910.

The second child and eldest son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Edward, nicknamed &quot;Bertie&quot;, was related to royalty throughout Europe. He was Prince of Wales and heir apparent to the British throne for almost 60 years. During his mother&#x27;s reign, he was largely excluded from political influence and came to personify the fashionable, leisured elite. He married Princess Alexandra of Denmark in 1863, and the couple had six children. As Prince of Wales, Edward travelled throughout Britain performing ceremonial public duties and represented Britain on visits abroad. His tours of North America in 1860 and of the Indian subcontinent in 1875 proved popular successes. Despite the approval of the public, his reputation as a playboy prince soured his relationship with his mother.

Edward inherited the throne upon his mother&#x27;s death in 1901. He played a role in the modernisation of the British Home Fleet and the reorganisation of the British Army after the Second Boer War of 1899–1902. He re-instituted traditional ceremonies as public displays and broadened the range of people with whom royalty socialised. He fostered good relations between Britain and other European countries, especially France, for which he was popularly called &quot;Peacemaker&quot;, but his relationship with his nephew, German Emperor Wilhelm II, was poor.

The Edwardian era, which covered Edward&#x27;s reign and was named after him, coincided with the start of a new century and heralded significant changes in technology and society, including steam turbine propulsion and the rise of socialism. Edward died in 1910 in the midst of a constitutional crisis that was resolved the following year by the Parliament Act 1911, which restricted the power of the unelected House of Lords. Edward was succeeded by his only surviving son, George V.

==Early life and education==

Edward was born on 9 November 1841 in Buckingham Palace. He was the eldest son and second child of Queen Victoria and her husband, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. He was christened &quot;Albert Edward&quot; at St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle, on 25 January 1842. He was named Albert after his father and Edward after his maternal grandfather, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn. He was known as &quot;Bertie&quot; to the royal family throughout his life.

As the eldest son of the British sovereign, Edward was automatically Duke of Cornwall and Duke of Rothesay at birth. As a son of Prince Albert, he also held the titles of Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and Duke of Saxony. He was created Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester on 8 December 1841, Earl of Dublin on 17 January 1850, a Knight of the Garter on 9 November 1858, and a Knight of the Thistle on 24 May 1867. In 1863, he renounced his succession rights to the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in favour of his younger brother Alfred.

The Queen and Prince Albert were determined that their eldest son should have an education that would prepare him to be a model constitutional monarch. At age seven, Edward embarked on a rigorous educational programme devised by Albert, and supervised by several tutors. Unlike his elder sister Victoria, he did not excel in his studies. He tried to meet the expectations of his parents, but to no avail. Although Edward was not a diligent student—his true talents were those of charm, sociability and tact—Benjamin Disraeli described him as informed, intelligent and of sweet manner. After the completion of his secondary-level studies, his tutor Frederick Waymouth Gibbs was replaced by Robert Bruce as his personal governor.

After an educational trip to Rome, undertaken in the first few months of 1859, Edward spent the summer of that year studying at the University of Edinburgh under, among others, the chemist Lyon Playfair. In October, he matriculated as an undergraduate at Christ Church, Oxford. Now released from the educational strictures imposed by his parents, he enjoyed studying for the first time and performed satisfactorily in examinations. In 1861, he transferred to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was tutored in history by Charles Kingsley, Regius Professor of Modern History. Kingsley&#x27;s efforts brought forth the best academic performances of Edward&#x27;s life, and Edward actually looked forward to his lectures.

==Early adulthood==

In 1860, Edward undertook the first tour of North America by a Prince of Wales. His genial good humour and confident &quot;&quot; made the tour a great success. He inaugurated the Victoria Bridge, Montreal, across the St Lawrence River, and laid the cornerstone of Parliament Hill, Ottawa. He watched Charles Blondin traverse Niagara Falls by highwire, and stayed for three days with President James Buchanan at the White House. Buchanan accompanied the prince to Mount Vernon, to pay his respects at the tomb of George Washington. Vast crowds greeted Edward everywhere. He met Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. Prayers for the royal family were said in Trinity Church, New York, for the first time since 1776. The four-month tour throughout Canada and the United States considerably boosted Edward&#x27;s confidence and self-esteem, and had many diplomatic benefits for Great Britain.

Edward had hoped to pursue a career in the British Army, but his mother vetoed an active military career. He had been gazetted colonel on 9 November 1858—to his disappointment, as he had wanted to earn his commission by examination. In September 1861, he was sent to Germany, supposedly to watch military manoeuvres, but actually in order to engineer a meeting between him and Princess Alexandra of Denmark. The Queen and Prince Albert had already decided that Edward and Alexandra should marry. They met at Speyer on 24 September under the auspices of Edward&#x27;s elder sister, Victoria, who had married the Crown Prince of Prussia in 1858. Princess Victoria, acting upon instructions from her mother, had met Alexandra at Strelitz in June; Alexandra made a very favourable impression. She and Edward were friendly from the start, and marriage plans advanced.

Edward gained a reputation as a playboy. Determined to get some army experience, he attended manoeuvres in Ireland, during which he spent three nights with an actress, Nellie Clifden, who was hidden in the camp by his fellow officers. Albert, though ill, was appalled and visited Edward at Cambridge to issue a reprimand. Albert died in December 1861, just two weeks after the visit. The Queen was inconsolable, wore mourning clothes for the rest of her life and blamed Edward for his father&#x27;s death. At first, she regarded her son with distaste as frivolous, indiscreet and irresponsible. She wrote to her eldest daughter, &quot;I never can, or shall, look at him without a shudder.&quot;

===Marriage===
Once widowed, the Queen effectively withdrew from public life. Shortly after Prince Albert&#x27;s death, she arranged for Edward to embark on an extensive tour of the Middle East, visiting Egypt, Jerusalem, Damascus, Beirut and Istanbul. The British government wanted Edward to secure the friendship of Egypt&#x27;s ruler, Said Pasha, to prevent French control of the Suez Canal if the Ottoman Empire collapsed. It was the first royal tour on which an official photographer, Francis Bedford, was in attendance.

As soon as Edward returned to Britain, preparations were made for his engagement, which was sealed at Laeken in Belgium on 9 September 1862. Edward married Alexandra at St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle, on 10 March 1863. He was 21; she was 18.

The couple established Marlborough House as their London residence and Sandringham House in Norfolk as their country retreat. They entertained on a lavish scale. Their marriage met with disapproval in certain circles because most of the Queen&#x27;s relations were German, and Denmark was at loggerheads with Germany over the territories of Schleswig and Holstein. When Alexandra&#x27;s father, King Christian IX, inherited the throne of Denmark in November 1863, the German Confederation took the opportunity to invade and annex Schleswig-Holstein. The Queen was of two minds as to whether it was a suitable match, given the political climate. After the marriage, she expressed anxiety about their socialite lifestyle and attempted to dictate to them on various matters, including the names of their children.

Edward had mistresses throughout his married life. He socialised with actress Lillie Langtry; Lady Randolph Churchill; Daisy Greville, Countess of Warwick; actress Sarah Bernhardt; noblewoman Lady Susan Vane-Tempest; singer Hortense Schneider; prostitute Giulia Beneni (known as &quot;La Barucci&quot;); wealthy humanitarian Agnes Keyser; and Alice Keppel. At least fifty-five liaisons are conjectured. How far these relationships went is not always clear. Edward always strove to be discreet, but this did not prevent society gossip or press speculation. Keppel&#x27;s great-granddaughter Camilla Parker Bowles became the mistress and subsequent wife of King Charles III, Edward&#x27;s great-great-grandson. It was rumoured that Camilla&#x27;s grandmother Sonia Keppel was fathered by Edward, but she was &quot;almost certainly&quot; the daughter of George Keppel, whom she resembled. Edward never acknowledged any illegitimate children. Alexandra was aware of his affairs, and seems to have accepted them.

In 1869, Sir Charles Mordaunt, a British Member of Parliament, threatened to name Edward as co-respondent in his divorce suit. Ultimately, he did not do so but Edward was called as a witness in the case in early 1870. It was shown that Edward had visited the Mordaunts&#x27; house while Sir Charles was away sitting in the House of Commons. Although nothing further was proven and Edward denied he had committed adultery, the suggestion of impropriety was damaging.

==Heir apparent==
During his mother&#x27;s widowhood, Edward pioneered the idea of royal public appearances as they are understood today—for example, opening the Thames Embankment in 1871, the Mersey Railway Tunnel in 1886, and Tower Bridge in 1894—but his mother did not allow him an active role in the running of the country until 1898. He was sent summaries of important government documents, but she refused to give him access to the originals. Edward annoyed his mother, who favoured the Germans, by siding with Denmark on the Schleswig-Holstein Question in 1864 and in the same year annoyed her again by making a special effort to meet Giuseppe Garibaldi, the Italian general and revolutionary, who was a leader in the movement for Italian unification. Liberal Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone sent him papers secretly. From 1886, Foreign Secretary Lord Rosebery sent him Foreign Office despatches, and from 1892 some Cabinet papers were opened to him.

In 1870 republican sentiment in Britain was given a boost when the French Emperor, Napoleon III, was defeated in the Franco-Prussian War and the French Third Republic was declared. However, in the winter of 1871, a brush with death led to an improvement in both Edward&#x27;s popularity with the public and his relationship with his mother. While staying at Londesborough Lodge, near Scarborough, North Yorkshire, Edward contracted typhoid fever, the disease that was believed to have killed his father. There was great national concern, and one of his fellow guests (Lord Chesterfield) died. Edward&#x27;s recovery was greeted with almost universal relief. Public celebrations included the composition of Arthur Sullivan&#x27;s Festival Te Deum. Edward cultivated politicians from all parties, including republicans, as his friends, and thereby largely dissipated any residual feelings against him.

On 26 September 1875, Edward set off for India on an extensive eight-month tour; on the way, he visited Malta, Brindisi and Greece. His advisors remarked on his habit of treating all people the same, regardless of their social station or colour. In letters home, he complained of the treatment of the native Indians by the British officials: &quot;Because a man has a black face and a different religion from our own, there is no reason why he should be treated as a brute.&quot; Consequently, Lord Salisbury, the Secretary of State for India, issued new guidance and at least one resident was removed from office. He returned to England on 11 May 1876, after stopping off at Portugal. At the end of the tour, Queen Victoria was given the title Empress of India by Parliament, in part as a result of the tour&#x27;s success.

Edward was regarded worldwide as an arbiter of men&#x27;s fashions. He made wearing tweed, Homburg hats and Norfolk jackets fashionable, and popularised the wearing of black ties with dinner jackets, instead of white tie and tails. He pioneered the pressing of trouser legs from side to side in preference to the now normal front and back creases, and was thought to have introduced the stand-up turn-down shirt collar, created for him by Charvet. A stickler for proper dress, he is said to have admonished Lord Salisbury for wearing the trousers of an Elder Brother of Trinity House with a privy councillor&#x27;s coat. Deep in an international crisis, Salisbury informed Edward that it had been a dark morning, and that &quot;my mind must have been occupied by some subject of less importance.&quot; The tradition of men not buttoning the bottom button of waistcoats is said to be linked to Edward, who supposedly left his undone because of his large girth. His waist measured 48 inches (122 cm) shortly before his coronation. He introduced the practice of eating roast beef and potatoes with horseradish sauce and Yorkshire pudding on Sundays, a meal that remains a staple British favourite for Sunday lunch. He was a lifelong heavy smoker, but not a heavy drinker, though he did drink champagne and, occasionally, port.

Edward was a patron of the arts and sciences and helped found the Royal College of Music. He opened the college in 1883 with the words, &quot;Class can no longer stand apart from class ... I claim for music that it produces that union of feeling which I much desire to promote.&quot; At the same time, he enjoyed gambling and country sports, and was an enthusiastic hunter. He ordered all the clocks at Sandringham to run half an hour ahead to provide more daylight time for shooting. This tradition of so-called Sandringham time continued until 1936, when it was abolished by Edward VIII. He also laid out a golf course at Windsor. By the 1870s Edward had taken a keen interest in horseracing and steeplechasing. In 1896, his horse Persimmon won both the Derby Stakes and the St Leger Stakes. In 1900, Persimmon&#x27;s brother, Diamond Jubilee, won five races (Derby, St Leger, 2000 Guineas Stakes, Newmarket Stakes and Eclipse Stakes) and another of Edward&#x27;s horses, Ambush II, won the Grand National.

In 1891 Edward was embroiled in the royal baccarat scandal, when it was revealed he had played an illegal card game for money the previous year. He was forced to appear as a witness in court for a second time when one of the participants unsuccessfully sued his fellow players for slander after being accused of cheating. In the same year Edward was involved in a personal conflict, when Lord Charles Beresford threatened to reveal details of Edward&#x27;s private life to the press, as a protest against Edward interfering with Beresford&#x27;s affair with Daisy Greville, Countess of Warwick. The friendship between the two men was irreversibly damaged, and their bitterness would last for the remainder of their lives. Usually, Edward&#x27;s outbursts of temper were short-lived, and &quot;after he had let himself go ... [he would] smooth matters by being especially nice&quot;.

In late 1891, Edward&#x27;s eldest son, Albert Victor, was engaged to Princess Victoria Mary of Teck. Just a few weeks later, in early 1892, Albert Victor died of pneumonia. Edward was grief-stricken. &quot;To lose our eldest son&quot;, he wrote, &quot;is one of those calamities one can never really get over&quot;. Edward told the Queen, &quot;[I would] have given my life for him, as I put no value on mine&quot;. Albert Victor was the second of Edward&#x27;s children to die. In 1871, his youngest son, Alexander John, had died just 24 hours after being born. Edward had insisted on placing Alexander John in a coffin personally with &quot;the tears rolling down his cheeks&quot;.

On his way to Denmark through Belgium on 4 April 1900, Edward was the victim of an attempted assassination when 15-year-old Jean-Baptiste Sipido shot at him in protest over the Second Boer War. The culprit was acquitted by a Belgian court because he was underage. The perceived laxity of the Belgian authorities, combined with British disgust at Belgian atrocities in the Congo, worsened the already poor relations between the United Kingdom and the Continent. However, in the next ten years, Edward&#x27;s affability and popularity, as well as his use of family connections, assisted Britain in building European alliances.

==Reign==
===Accession===

When his mother died on 22 January 1901, Edward became King of the United Kingdom, Emperor of India and, in an innovation, King of the British Dominions. He chose to reign under the name of Edward VII, instead of Albert Edward—the name his mother had intended for him to use—declaring that he did not wish to &quot;undervalue the name of Albert&quot; and diminish the status of his father with whom the &quot;name should stand alone&quot;. The numeral VII was occasionally omitted in Scotland, even by the national church, in deference to protests that the previous Edwards were English kings who had &quot;been excluded from Scotland by battle&quot;. J. B. Priestley recalled, &quot;I was only a child when he succeeded Victoria in 1901, but I can testify to his extraordinary popularity. He was in fact the most popular king England had known since the earlier 1660s.&quot;

Edward donated his parents&#x27; house, Osborne on the Isle of Wight, to the state and continued to live at Sandringham. He could afford to be magnanimous; his private secretary, Sir Francis Knollys, claimed that he was the first heir to succeed to the throne in credit. Edward&#x27;s finances had been ably managed by Sir Dighton Probyn, Comptroller of the Household, and had benefited from advice from Edward&#x27;s financier friends, some of whom were Jewish, such as Ernest Cassel, Maurice de Hirsch and the Rothschild family. At a time of widespread antisemitism, Edward attracted criticism for openly socialising with Jews.

Edward&#x27;s coronation had originally been scheduled for 26 June 1902. However, two days before, he was diagnosed with appendicitis. The disease was generally not treated operatively. It carried a high mortality rate, but developments in anaesthesia and antisepsis in the preceding 50 years made life-saving surgery possible. Sir Frederick Treves, with the support of Lord Lister, performed a then-radical operation of draining a pint of pus from the infected abscess through an incision in the king&#x27;s abdomen; this outcome showed that the cause was not cancer. The next day, Edward was sitting up in bed, smoking a cigar. Two weeks later, it was announced that he was out of danger. Treves was honoured with a baronetcy (which the King had arranged before the operation) and appendix surgery entered the medical mainstream. Edward was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 9 August 1902 by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Frederick Temple.

Edward refurbished the royal palaces, reintroduced the traditional ceremonies, such as the State Opening of Parliament, that his mother had foregone, and founded new honours, such as the Order of Merit, to recognise contributions to the arts and sciences. In 1902, the Shah of Persia, Mozzafar-al-Din, visited England expecting to receive the Order of the Garter. The King refused to bestow the honour on the Shah because the order was meant to be in his personal gift and the Foreign Secretary, Lord Lansdowne, had promised it without his consent. He also objected to inducting a Muslim into a Christian order of chivalry. His refusal threatened to damage British attempts to gain influence in Persia, but Edward resented his ministers&#x27; attempts to reduce his traditional powers. Eventually, he relented and Britain sent a special embassy to the Shah with a full Order of the Garter the following year.

===&quot;Uncle of Europe&quot;===

As King, Edward&#x27;s main interests lay in the fields of foreign affairs and naval and military matters. Fluent in French and German, he reinvented royal diplomacy by numerous state visits across Europe. He took annual holidays in Biarritz and Marienbad. One of his most important foreign trips was an official visit to France in May 1903 as the guest of President Émile Loubet. Following a visit to Pope Leo XIII in Rome, this trip helped create the atmosphere for the Anglo-French Entente Cordiale, an agreement delineating British and French colonies in North Africa, and ruling out any future war between the two countries. The Entente was negotiated in 1904 between the French foreign minister, Théophile Delcassé, and the British foreign secretary, Lord Lansdowne. It marked the end of centuries of Anglo-French rivalry and Britain&#x27;s splendid isolation from Continental affairs, and attempted to counterbalance the growing dominance of the German Empire and its ally, Austria-Hungary.

Edward was related to nearly every other European monarch, and came to be known as the &quot;uncle of Europe&quot;. German Emperor Wilhelm II and Emperor Nicholas II of Russia were his nephews; Queen Victoria Eugenia of Spain, Crown Princess Margaret of Sweden, Crown Princess Marie of Romania, Crown Princess Sophia of Greece, and Empress Alexandra of Russia were his nieces; King Haakon VII of Norway was both his nephew and his son-in-law; kings Frederick VIII of Denmark and George I of Greece were his brothers-in-law; kings Albert I of Belgium, Ferdinand I of Bulgaria, and Carlos I and Manuel II of Portugal were his second cousins. Edward doted on his grandchildren, and indulged them, to the consternation of their governesses. However, there was one relation whom Edward did not like: Wilhelm II. His difficult relationship with his nephew exacerbated the tensions between Germany and Britain.

In April 1908, during Edward&#x27;s annual stay at Biarritz, he accepted the resignation of British Prime Minister Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman. In a break with precedent, Edward asked Campbell-Bannerman&#x27;s successor, H. H. Asquith, to travel to Biarritz to kiss hands. Asquith complied, but the press criticised the action of the King in appointing a prime minister on foreign soil instead of returning to Britain. In June 1908, Edward became the first reigning British monarch to visit the Russian Empire, despite refusing to visit in 1906, when Anglo-Russian relations were strained in the aftermath of the Russo-Japanese War, the Dogger Bank incident, and the Tsar&#x27;s dissolution of the Duma. The previous month, he visited the Scandinavian countries, becoming the first British monarch to visit Sweden.

While Prince of Wales, Edward had to be dissuaded from breaking with constitutional precedent by openly voting for W. E. Gladstone&#x27;s Representation of the People Bill (1884) in the House of Lords. On other matters, he was more conservative; for example, he did not favour giving votes to women, although he did suggest that the social reformer Octavia Hill serve on the Commission for Working Class Housing. He was also opposed to Irish Home Rule, instead preferring a form of dual monarchy.

As Prince of Wales, Edward had come to enjoy warm and mutually respectful relations with Gladstone, whom his mother detested. But the statesman&#x27;s son, Home Secretary Herbert Gladstone, angered the King by planning to permit Roman Catholic priests in vestments to carry the Host through the streets of London, and by appointing two ladies, Lady Frances Balfour and May Tennant (wife of H. J. Tennant), to serve on a Royal Commission on reforming divorce law—Edward thought divorce could not be discussed with &quot;delicacy or even decency&quot; before ladies. Edward&#x27;s biographer Philip Magnus-Allcroft suggests that Gladstone may have become a whipping boy for the King&#x27;s general irritation with the Liberal government. Gladstone was sacked in the reshuffle the following year and the King agreed, with some reluctance, to appoint him Governor-General of South Africa.

Edward involved himself heavily in discussions over army reform, the need for which had become apparent with the failings of the Second Boer War. He supported the redesign of army command, the creation of the Territorial Force, and the decision to provide an Expeditionary Force supporting France in the event of war with Germany. Reform of the Royal Navy was also suggested, partly due to the ever-increasing Naval Estimates, and because of the emergence of the Imperial German Navy as a new strategic threat. Ultimately a dispute arose between Admiral Lord Charles Beresford, who favoured increased spending and a broad deployment, and the First Sea Lord Admiral Sir John Fisher, who favoured efficiency savings, scrapping obsolete vessels, and a strategic realignment of the Royal Navy relying on torpedo craft for home defence backed by the new dreadnoughts.

The King lent support to Fisher, in part because he disliked Beresford, and eventually Beresford was dismissed. Beresford continued his campaign outside of the navy and Fisher ultimately announced his resignation in late 1909, although the bulk of his policies were retained. The King was intimately involved in the appointment of Fisher&#x27;s successor as the Fisher-Beresford feud had split the service, and the only truly qualified figure known to be outside of both camps was Sir Arthur Wilson, who had retired in 1907. Wilson was reluctant to return to active duty, but Edward persuaded him to do so, and Wilson became First Sea Lord on 25 January 1910.

Edward was rarely interested in politics, although his views on some issues were notably progressive for the time. During his reign, he said use of the word &quot;nigger&quot; was &quot;disgraceful&quot;, despite it then being in common parlance. In 1904, Wilhelm II and Edward met during an Anglo-German summit in Kiel. Wilhelm, with the Russo-Japanese War in mind, started to go on about the &quot;Yellow Peril&quot;, which he called &quot;the greatest peril menacing ... Christendom and European civilisation. If the Russians went on giving ground, the yellow race would, in twenty years time, be in Moscow and Posen&quot;. Wilhelm went on to attack his British guests for supporting Japan against Russia, suggesting that the British were committing &quot;race treason&quot;. In response, Edward stated that he &quot;could not see it. The Japanese were an intelligent, brave and chivalrous nation, quite as civilised as the Europeans, from whom they only differed by the pigmentation of their skin&quot;. Although Edward lived a life of luxury often far removed from that of the majority of his subjects, they expected it, and his personal charm with all levels of society and his strong condemnation of prejudice went some way to assuage republican and racial tensions building during his lifetime.

===Constitutional crisis===
In the last year of his life, Edward became embroiled in a constitutional crisis when the Conservative majority in the House of Lords refused to pass the &quot;People&#x27;s Budget&quot; proposed by the Liberal government of Prime Minister Asquith. The crisis eventually led—after Edward&#x27;s death—to the removal of the Lords&#x27; right to veto legislation.
The King was displeased at Liberal attacks on the peers, which included a polemical speech by David Lloyd George at Limehouse. Cabinet minister Winston Churchill publicly demanded a general election, for which Asquith apologised to the King&#x27;s adviser Lord Knollys and rebuked Churchill at a Cabinet meeting. Edward was so dispirited at the tone of class warfare—although Asquith told him that party rancour had been just as bad over the First Home Rule Bill in 1886—that he introduced his son to Secretary of State for War Richard Haldane as &quot;the last King of England&quot;. After the King&#x27;s horse Minoru won the Derby on 26 July 1909, he returned to the racetrack the following day and laughed when a man shouted: &quot;Now, King. You&#x27;ve won the Derby. Go back home and dissolve this bloody Parliament!&quot;

In vain, the King urged Conservative leaders Arthur Balfour and Lord Lansdowne to pass the budget, which Lord Esher had advised him was not unusual, as Queen Victoria had helped to broker agreements between the two Houses over Irish disestablishment in 1869 and the Third Reform Act in 1884. On Asquith&#x27;s advice, however, he did not offer them an election (at which, to judge from recent by-elections, they were likely to gain seats) as a reward for doing so.
The Finance Bill passed the Commons on 5 November 1909, but was rejected by the Lords on 30 November; they instead passed a resolution of Lord Lansdowne&#x27;s stating that they were entitled to oppose the bill as it lacked an electoral mandate. The King was annoyed that his efforts to urge passage of the budget had become public knowledge and had forbidden Knollys, who was an active Liberal peer, from voting for the budget, although Knollys had suggested that this would be a suitable gesture to indicate royal desire to see the budget pass. In December 1909, a proposal to create peers (to give the Liberals a majority in the Lords) or give the prime minister the right to do so was considered &quot;outrageous&quot; by Knollys, who thought the King should abdicate rather than agree to it.

Talk of removing the Lords&#x27; veto played a major role in the January 1910 election. Early in the election campaign, Lloyd George talked of &quot;guarantees&quot; and Asquith of &quot;safeguards&quot; that would be necessary before forming another Liberal government, but such talk ceased after the King informed Asquith that he would not be willing to contemplate creating peers until after a second general election. Balfour refused to say whether or not he would be willing to form a Conservative government, but advised the King not to promise to create peers until he had seen the terms of any proposed constitutional change. During the campaign, the leading Conservative Walter Long asked Knollys for permission to state that the King did not favour Irish Home Rule, but Knollys refused on the grounds that it was not appropriate for the monarch&#x27;s views to be known in public.

The election resulted in a hung parliament, with the Liberal government dependent on the support of the third-largest party, the nationalist Irish Parliamentary Party. The King suggested a compromise whereby only 50 peers from each side would be allowed to vote, which would also obviate the large Conservative majority in the Lords, but Lord Crewe, Liberal leader in the Lords, advised that this would reduce the Lords&#x27; independence, as only peers who were loyal party supporters would be picked. Pressure to remove the Lords&#x27; veto now came from the Irish nationalist MPs, who wanted to remove the Lords&#x27; ability to block the introduction of Home Rule. They threatened to vote against the budget unless they had their way (an attempt by Lloyd George to win their support by amending whiskey duties was abandoned as the Cabinet felt this would recast the budget too much). Asquith now revealed that there were no &quot;guarantees&quot; for the creation of peers. The Cabinet considered resigning and leaving it up to Balfour to try to form a Conservative government.

The King&#x27;s speech from the throne on 21 February made reference to introducing measures restricting the Lords&#x27; power of veto to one of delay, but Asquith inserted a phrase &quot;in the opinion of my advisers&quot; so the King could be seen to be distancing himself from the planned legislation. The Commons passed resolutions on 14 April that would form the basis for the Parliament Act 1911: to remove the power of the Lords to veto money bills, to replace their veto of other bills with a power to delay, and to reduce the term of Parliament from seven years to five (the King would have preferred four). But in that debate Asquith hinted—to ensure the support of the nationalist MPs—that he would ask the King to break the deadlock &quot;in that Parliament&quot; (i.e. contrary to Edward&#x27;s earlier stipulation that there be a second election). The budget was passed by both Commons and Lords in April.

By April, the Palace was having secret talks with Balfour and Randall Davidson, Archbishop of Canterbury, who both advised that the Liberals did not have sufficient mandate to demand the creation of peers. The King thought the whole proposal &quot;simply disgusting&quot; and that the government was &quot;in the hands of Redmond &amp; Co&quot;. Lord Crewe announced publicly that the government&#x27;s wish to create peers should be treated as formal &quot;ministerial advice&quot; (which, by convention, the monarch must accept), although Lord Esher argued that the monarch was entitled &quot;in extremis&quot; to dismiss the government rather than take their &quot;advice&quot;. Esher&#x27;s view has been called &quot;obsolete and unhelpful&quot;.

==Death==

Edward habitually smoked twenty cigarettes and twelve cigars a day. In 1907, a rodent ulcer, a type of cancer affecting the skin next to his nose, was cured with radium. Towards the end of his life he increasingly suffered from bronchitis. He suffered a momentary loss of consciousness during a state visit to Berlin in February 1909. In March 1910, he was staying at Biarritz when he collapsed. He remained there to convalesce, while in London Asquith tried to get the Finance Bill passed. The King&#x27;s continued ill health was unreported, and he attracted criticism for staying in France while political tensions were so high. On 27 April he returned to Buckingham Palace, still suffering from severe bronchitis. Alexandra returned from visiting her brother, George I of Greece, in Corfu a week later on 5 May.

On 6 May, Edward suffered several heart attacks, but refused to go to bed, saying, &quot;No, I shall not give in; I shall go on; I shall work to the end.&quot; Between moments of faintness, his son the Prince of Wales (shortly to be King George V) told him that his horse, Witch of the Air, had won at Kempton Park that afternoon. The King replied, &quot;Yes, I have heard of it. I am very glad&quot;: his final words. At 11:30 p.m. he lost consciousness for the last time and was put to bed. He died 15 minutes later.

Alexandra refused to allow Edward&#x27;s body to be moved for eight days afterwards, though she allowed small groups of visitors to enter his room. On 11 May, the late king was dressed in his uniform and placed in a massive oak coffin, which was moved on 14 May to the throne room, where it was sealed and lay in state, with a guardsman standing at each corner of the bier. Despite the time that had elapsed since his death, Alexandra noted his body remained &quot;wonderfully preserved&quot;. On the morning of 17 May, the coffin was placed on a gun carriage and drawn by black horses to Westminster Hall, with the new king, his family and Edward&#x27;s favourite dog, Caesar, walking behind. Following a brief service, the royal family left, and the hall was opened to the public; over 400,000 people filed past the coffin over the next two days. As Barbara Tuchman noted in &quot;The Guns of August&quot;, his funeral, held on 20 May 1910, marked &quot;the greatest assemblage of royalty and rank ever gathered in one place and, of its kind, the last.&quot; A royal train conveyed the King&#x27;s coffin from London to Windsor Castle, where Edward was buried at St George&#x27;s Chapel.

==Legacy==

Before his accession to the throne, Edward was the longest-serving heir apparent in British history. He was surpassed by his great-great-grandson Charles III on 20 April 2011. The title Prince of Wales is not automatically held by the heir apparent; it is bestowed by the reigning monarch at a time of his or her choosing. Edward was the longest-serving holder of that title until surpassed by Charles on 9 September 2017. Edward was Prince of Wales between 8 December 1841 and 22 January 1901 (59 years, 45 days); Charles held the title between 26 July 1958 and 8 September 2022 ().

As king, Edward VII proved a greater success than anyone had expected, but he was already past the average life expectancy and had little time left to fulfil the role. In his short reign, he ensured that his second son and heir, George V, was better prepared to take the throne. Contemporaries described their relationship as more like affectionate brothers than father and son, and on Edward&#x27;s death George wrote in his diary that he had lost his &quot;best friend and the best of fathers ... I never had a [cross] word with him in my life. I am heart-broken and overwhelmed with grief&quot;.

Edward has been recognised as the first truly constitutional British sovereign and the last sovereign to wield effective political power. Though lauded as &quot;Peacemaker&quot;, he had been afraid that German Emperor Wilhelm II, who was one of his nephews, would tip Europe into war. Four years after Edward&#x27;s death, the First World War broke out. The naval reforms he had supported and his part in securing the Triple Entente between Britain, France, and Russia, as well as his relationships with his extended family, fed the paranoia of the German Emperor, who blamed Edward for the war. Publication of the official biography of Edward was delayed until 1927 by its author, Sidney Lee, who feared German propagandists would select material to portray Edward as an anti-German warmonger. Lee was also hampered by the extensive destruction of Edward&#x27;s personal papers; Edward had left orders that all his letters should be burned on his death. Subsequent biographers have been able to construct a more rounded picture of Edward by using material and sources that were unavailable to Lee.

Historian R. C. K. Ensor, writing in 1936, praised the King&#x27;s political personality:

 ...he had in many respects great natural ability. He knew how to be both dignified and charming; he had an excellent memory; and his tact in handling people was quite exceptional. He had a store of varied, though unsystematized, knowledge gathered at first-hand through talking to all sorts of eminent men. His tastes were not particularly elevated, but they were thoroughly English; and he showed much (though not unfailing) comprehension for the common instincts of the people over whom he reigned. This was not the less remarkable because, though a good linguist in French and German, he never learned to speak English without a German accent.

Ensor rejects the widespread notion that the King exerted an important influence on British foreign policy, believing he gained that reputation by making frequent trips abroad, with many highly publicized visits to foreign courts. Ensor thought surviving documents showed &quot;how comparatively crude his views on foreign policy were, how little he read, and of what naïve indiscretions he was capable.&quot; Edward received criticism for his apparent pursuit of self-indulgent pleasure, but he received great praise for his affable manners and diplomatic tact. As his grandson Edward VIII wrote, &quot;his lighter side ... obscured the fact that he had both insight and influence.&quot; &quot;He had a tremendous zest for pleasure but he also had a real sense of duty&quot;, wrote J. B. Priestley. Lord Esher wrote that Edward VII was &quot;kind and debonair and not undignified—but too human&quot;.

<doc id="46722" wikidata="Q1265357" url="?curid=46722" title="Duncan Campbell (died 1758)">
<text>Duncan Campbell was a Scots nobleman who died on 18 July 1758 as a result of wounds received in an unsuccessful frontal attack against French forces at Fort Carillon (renamed Fort Ticonderoga when the British took the fort a year later). The legend associated with Campbell is that a number of years prior—while still living in Scotland—Campbell gave shelter to a stranger who turned out to have killed Duncan&#x27;s cousin. Faced with the conflict between betraying a guest or taking vengeance for the death of his cousin, Campbell compromised by allowing the killer to hide out in a cave. The ghost of Campbell&#x27;s cousin is claimed to have appeared to Campbell in a dream and promised to meet him again at &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;, a place that Duncan surely had never heard of previously. This story was published in the poem &quot;Ticonderoga a Legend of the West Highlands&quot; by Robert Louis Stevenson in &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Magazine&quot; December 1887.
Campbell&#x27;s 42nd Regiment of Foot Highlanders took many casualties in the ill-fated attack on Fort Carillon. Legend has it that the battle was replicated in the clouds over Inveraray Castle in Scotland on the afternoon of the attack. The story of the ghostly prediction and the apparition in the clouds over Inverawe has been repeated a number of times in magazines, song, and used several times in television scripts.
His remains are interred at the Union Cemetery in Fort Edward, NY alongside Jane McCrea and her cousin Sara McNeil.

==Songs==
Inspired by the history and legend, Rich Nardin wrote (circa 1980) the song &quot;Piper&#x27;s Refrain&quot;, about the end of Campbell&#x27;s story. The song was first released on Nardin&#x27;s 1983 album, and has been recorded by multiple artists since. The song is in the folk tradition and may be thought by some to be a traditional ballad when sung by others. The story further inspired Margaret MacArthur to write &quot;The Legend of Duncan Campbell&quot; as an accompanying song which explores the beginning of the tale in Scotland.

<doc id="46723" wikidata="Q103404" url="?curid=46723" title="Pope Paul I">
<text>Pope Paul I (; 70028 June 767) was the bishop of Rome and ruler of the emerging Papal States from 29 May 757 to his death. He first served as a Roman deacon and was frequently employed by his brother, Pope Stephen II, in negotiations with the Lombard kings.

==Rise==
Paul was a Roman aristocrat and member of the Orsini family. He and his brother Stephen had been educated for the priesthood at the Lateran Palace. Stephen became pope in 752. After Stephen&#x27;s death on 26 April 757, Paul prevailed over a faction that wanted to make Archdeacon Theophylact pope and was chosen to succeed his brother by the majority that wished a continuation of Stephen&#x27;s policy.

==Pontificate==

Paul I&#x27;s reign was dominated by relations with the Frankish and Lombard kings and with the Eastern Roman emperor. He wrote to Pepin the Short that the Frankish alliance should be maintained unimpaired. Paul was likely concerned of the danger posed by the Lombard king Desiderius. The Lombards held the cities of Imola, Osimo, Bologna, and Ancona, which were claimed by the papacy, and in 758 seized upon the duchies of Spoleto and Benevento.

On his return from suppressing a revolt in Benevento, Desiderius visited Rome and compelled Paul to write to Pepin asking him to concede all the Lombard claims. He promised to return Imola, but on condition that the pope should persuade Pepin to send back Lombard hostages held by the Franks. Paul agreed and sent a letter to Pepin. Pepin found it advisable to maintain good relations with Desiderius, and Paul apparently accomplished little by his double-dealing. Later, however, Pepin gave the pope some support and acted as arbiter between the Roman and Lombard claims.

In 765, papal privileges were restored in the duchies of Benevento and Tuscany and partially in Spoleto. Meanwhile, the alienation from the Eastern Roman Empire grew greater. On several occasions, especially in 759, Paul feared that the emperor would send an army against Rome. This meant that he lived in constant dread of Eastern Roman ambitions turning the Frankish influence in favor of the Lombards. This was actually attempted, but Pepin held to his original policy regarding Italy.

Paul died in Rome on 28 June 767.

<doc id="46725" wikidata="Q312422" url="?curid=46725" title="Arion">
<text>Arion (; ) was a kitharode in ancient Greece, a Dionysiac poet credited with inventing the dithyramb. The islanders of Lesbos claimed him as their native son, but Arion found a patron in Periander, tyrant of Corinth. Although notable for his musical inventions, Arion is chiefly remembered for the fantastic myth of his kidnapping by pirates and miraculous rescue by dolphins, a folktale motif.

== Origins ==
Arion was a native of Methymna in Lesbos, and, according to some mythological accounts, a son of Cyclon or of Poseidon and the nymph Oncaea. All traditions about him agree in describing him as a contemporary and friend of Periander, tyrant of Corinth. He appears to have spent a great part of his life at the court of Periander, but respecting his life and his poetical or musical productions, scarcely anything is known beyond the story of his escape from the sailors with whom he sailed from Sicily to Corinth.

== The dithyramb ==
Arion is often called the inventor of the dithyrambic poetry, and of the name dithyramb. As Arthur Wallace writes: &quot;As a literary composition for chorus dithyramb was the creation of Arion of Corinth,&quot; His fame was established in antiquity, and Herodotus says &quot;Arion was second to none of the lyre-players in his time and was also the first man we know of to compose and name the dithyramb and teach it in Corinth&quot;. However, J. H. Sleeman observes of the dithyramb, or circular chorus, &quot;It is first mentioned by Archilochus (c. 665 BC) ... Arion flourished at least 50 years later ... probably gave it a more artistic form, adding a chorus of 50 people, personating satyrs... who danced around an altar of Dionysus. He was doubtless the first to introduce the dithyramb into Corinth&quot;. Armand D&#x27;Angour notes that Arion&#x27;s contribution to the reform of the dithyramb, which was eventually performed in a circle and called &quot;kuklios choros&quot;, was recognised by ancient sources by the fact that they named his father &quot;Kukleus&quot; (&quot;Circle-man&quot;).

Arion is also associated with the origins of tragedy: of Solon John the Deacon reports: “Arion of Methymna first introduced the drama [i.e. action] of tragedy, as Solon indicated in his poem entitled &quot;Elegies&quot;&quot;.

==Kidnapping by pirates==
According to Herodotus&#x27; account of the Lydian empire under the Mermnads, Arion attended a musical competition in Sicily, which he won. On his return trip from Tarentum, whose onomastic founder has a similar story, avaricious sailors plotted to kill Arion and steal the rich prizes he carried home. Arion was given the choice of suicide with a proper burial on land, or being thrown in the sea to perish. He asked for permission to sing a last song to win time.

Playing his kithara, Arion sang a praise to Apollo, the god of poetry, and his song attracted a number of dolphins around the ship. Some argue that the dolphins were sent by Apollo to rescue Arion. At the end of the song, Arion threw himself into the sea rather than be killed, but one of the dolphins saved his life and carried him to safety at the sanctuary of Poseidon at Cape Tainaron. When he reached land, being eager for his journey, he failed to return the dolphin to the sea and it perished there. He told his misfortunes to Periander, the Tyrant of Corinth, who ordered the dolphin to be buried, and monument raised to it. Shortly after, word came to Periander that the ship on which Arion had sailed had been brought to Corinth by a storm. He ordered the crew to be led before him, and inquired about Arion, but they replied that he had died and that they had buried him. The tyrant replied: &quot;Tomorrow you will swear to that at the Dolphin&#x27;s monument.&quot; Because of this he ordered them to be kept under guard, and instructed Arion to hide in the dolphin&#x27;s monument the next morning, attired as he had been when he had thrown himself into the sea. When the tyrant brought the ship&#x27;s crew to the dolphin&#x27;s monument and ordered them to swear by the departed spirit of the dolphin that Arion was dead, Arion came out of the monument. In amazement, wondering by what divinity he had been saved, the ship&#x27;s crew was silent. The tyrant ordered them to be crucified at the dolphin&#x27;s monument. Apollo, because of Arion&#x27;s skill with the kithara, placed him and the dolphin among the stars. This dolphin was catasterised as the constellation Delphinus, by the blessing of Apollo.

The story as Herodotus tells it was taken up in other literature. Lucian of Samosata wittily imagined the dialogue between Poseidon and the very dolphin who bore Arion.

Augustine of Hippo asserted that pagans &quot;believed in what they read in their own books&quot; and took Arion to be a historical individual. &quot;There is no historicity in this tale&quot;, according to Eunice Burr Stebbins, Arion and the dolphins are given as an example of &quot;a folkloristic motif especially associated with Apollo&quot; by Irad Malkin. Erasmus instanced Arion as one of the traditional poet&#x27;s topics that sound like &quot;historia&quot; rather than &quot;fabulae&quot;, though he misremembered that Augustine had taken the Arion story to be historical.

=== Mythological parallels ===
The pirates episode may be seen as a doublet of the fate of Melicertes, where the leap into the sea was that of his mother, Ino, transformed into the &quot;white goddess&quot; Leucothea. Melicertes was carried more dead than alive to the shores where the Isthmian Games were celebrated in his honour, as he was transformed to the hero Palaimon, who was placated with a nocturnal chthonic rite, and the whose winners were crowned with a barren wreath of spruce.

A similar story of told of the founding of Taras in Megale Hellas (Magna Graecia), modern Taranto, Apulia, Italy. When a son of Poseidon called Taras was shipwrecked, his father rescued him by sending a dolphin which he rode to traverse the sea from the promontory of Taenarum to the south of Italy. Brought ashore, Taras founded the city of the same name. According to Pausanias, he was worshiped as a hero who named both the city and the river, Taras after himself.

Another parallel is the myth of Dionysus and the sailors, related in the Homeric Hymns: Tyrrhenian pirates try to lash the god to the mast, but the wood itself starts to sprout and the mast is entwined with ivy (like the god&#x27;s thyrsus); the sailors leap into the sea and are transformed into dolphins. This is especially interesting because Arion is credited with the invention of the dithyramb, a dionysiac song form.

===Scholarly interpretations===
In light of the above parallels, Walter Burkert interprets the story as a significant development in the history of Dionysiac cult: &quot;Released from this gloomy background, the cheerful and liberating legend of the sixth century further developed the image of the dolphin-rider under the colours of the renewed cult of Dionysus.&quot;. C. M. Bowra tied the myth to the period following the expulsion from Corinth of the aristocratic Bacchiadae, who traced their descent from Dionysus: &quot;the cult of the god had to develop new and more democratic forms.&quot;

Stewart Flory identified Herodotus&#x27; characteristic use of the episode in a historicising context as an example of what Flory calls his &quot;brave gestures&quot;, a man faced with death performs with calm dignity some spirited but unnecessary gesture that demonstrates contempt for danger.

== Surviving fragment ==
A fragment of a hymn to Poseidon, quoted by Aelian and by him ascribed to Arion, has survived, and is contained in Bergk&#x27;s &quot;Poetae Lyrici Graeci.&quot; A poetic translation was made by the English schoolmaster Herbert Kynaston. A more literal prose rendering follows: 

Chiefest of Gods, sea-lord Poseidon of the trident of gold, earth-shaking king of the swelling brine, the beasts that swim dance all about thee with fins, and lightly bound with nimble flingings of the foot, the snub-nosed coarsing hounds of bristling mane, the dolphin-lovers of the Muse, sea-creatures of Nereus&#x27; goddess-daughters that he had of Amphitrite, the beasts that bore a wanderer on the Sicilian sea to Taenarum&#x27;s shore in Pelops&#x27; land, ploughing to the untrodden furrow of Nereus&#x27; field astride their humpèd back, when crafty men had cast me from out the hollow wave-going ship into the sea-purple billows of the ocean.
==In literature==
Letitia Elizabeth Landon&#x27;s narrative poem &quot;Arion&quot; examines and illustrates the story of Arion&#x27;s return to Greece.

Alexander Pushkin&#x27;s 1827 &quot;Arion&quot; poem, where Arion is the sole survivor of a shipwreck after a sea storm and continues to sing the same songs with which he used to delight his shipmates, is thought to be a thinly veiled allusion to his own situation after the Decembrist revolt of 1825.

George Eliot&#x27;s poem of the same name recounts Arion&#x27;s murder by pirates (&quot;sailors&quot;), with, however, no mention of him being saved by dolphins.

In Amor Towles&#x27; 2016 novel A Gentleman in Moscow, the Count tells Anna the story of Arion, after tracing freckles that reminded him of a dolphin on her back.

==In Astronomy==
Inspired by the lifeguard dolphin story, the name Arion was given in 2015 to a possible exoplanet orbiting the star 18 Delphini, which was named Musica at the same time.

<text>The E-carrier is a member of the series of carrier systems developed for digital transmission of many simultaneous telephone calls by time-division multiplexing. The European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT) originally standardised the E-carrier system, which revised and improved the earlier American T-carrier technology, and this has now been adopted by the International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T). It was widely used in almost all countries outside the US, Canada, and Japan. E-carrier deployments have steadily been replaced by Ethernet as telecommunication networks transition towards all IP.

==E1 frame structure==
An E1 link operates over two separate sets of wires, usually unshielded twisted pair (balanced cable) or using coaxial (unbalanced cable). A nominal 3 volt peak signal is encoded with pulses using a method avoiding long periods without polarity changes. The line data rate is 2.048 Mbit/s (full duplex, i.e. 2.048 Mbit/s downstream and 2.048 Mbit/s upstream) which is split into 32 timeslots, each being allocated 8 bits in turn. Thus each timeslot sends and receives an 8-bit PCM sample, usually encoded according to A-law algorithm, 8,000 times per second (8 × 8,000 × 32 = 2,048,000). This is ideal for voice telephone calls where the voice is sampled at that data rate and reconstructed at the other end. The timeslots are numbered from 0 to 31.

===Special timeslots===
One timeslot (TS0) is reserved for framing purposes, and alternately transmits a fixed pattern. This allows the receiver to lock onto the start of each frame and match up each channel in turn. The standards allow for a full cyclic redundancy check to be performed across all bits transmitted in each frame, to detect if the circuit is losing bits (information), but this is not always used. An alarm signal may also be transmitted using timeslot TS0. Finally, some bits are reserved for national use.

One timeslot (TS16) is often reserved for signalling purposes, to control call setup and teardown according to one of several standard telecommunications protocols. This includes channel-associated signaling (CAS) where a set of bits is used to replicate opening and closing the circuit (as if picking up the telephone receiver and pulsing digits on a rotary phone), or using tone signalling which is passed through on the voice circuits themselves. More recent systems use common-channel signaling (CCS) such Signalling System 7 (SS7) where no particular timeslot is reserved for signalling purposes, the signalling protocol being transmitted on a freely chosen set of timeslots or on a different physical channel.

When using E1 frames for data communication, some systems use those timeslots slightly differently, either

* TS0: Framing, TS1–TS31: Data traffic — This is named Channelized E1, and is used where the framing is required, it allows any of the 32 timeslots to be identified and extracted.
* TS0–TS31: Data traffic — Often referred to as Clear Channel E1 or Unchannelized, it is used where no framing is required, timeslot extraction is not required and the full bandwidth (2 Mb/s) is required.

==Hierarchy levels==
The PDH based on the E0 signal rate is designed so that each higher level can multiplex a set of lower level signals. Framed E1 is designed to carry 30 or 31 E0 data channels plus 1 or 2 special channels, all other levels are designed to carry 4 signals from the level below. Because of the necessity for overhead bits, and justification bits to account for rate differences between sections of the network, each subsequent level has a capacity greater than would be expected from simply multiplying the lower level signal rate (so for example E2 is 8.448 Mbit/s and not 8.192 Mbit/s as one might expect when multiplying the E1 rate by 4).

Note, because bit interleaving is used, it is very difficult to demultiplex low level tributaries directly, requiring equipment to individually demultiplex every single level down to the one that is required.

<text>Narses (also sometimes written Nerses; ; ; ; 478–573) was, with Belisarius, one of the great generals in the service of the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I during the Roman reconquest that took place during Justinian&#x27;s reign. He spent most of his life as an important eunuch in the palace of the emperors in Constantinople.

==Origins==
Narses was born in Persarmenia, the eastern part of Armenia that had been given to Persia a little less than 100 years earlier under the Peace of Acilisene. He was an Armenian. Some sources mistakenly identify Narses the eunuch with his namesake Narses Kamsarakan, thus, the commander is incorrectly attributed a relationship with this princely family, to which he had no relation. His first mention in a primary source is by Procopius in AD 530. The year of Narses&#x27; birth is unknown; historians have given dates including 478, 479 and 480. The year of his death is also unknown, with dates given between 566 and 574, making him eighty-six to ninety-six years old at his death. His family and lineage is also completely unknown, with many different stories told about his origins and how he became a eunuch.

Agathias Scholasticus of Myrina described him thus: &quot;He was a man of sound mind, and clever at adapting himself to the times. He was not versed in literature nor practiced in oratory, [but] made up for it by the fertility of his wits,&quot; and as &quot;small and of a lean habit, but stronger and more high-spirited than would have been believed.&quot;

==Religion==
Narses was reported to be a very pious man with a special devotion to the Virgin Mary. Evagrius Scholasticus in Ecclesiastica Historia reported that She would tell him the proper time to attack, and Narses would never engage in battle without Her consent. Narses also was reported to be generous to the poor and zealous when it came to restoring churches. He was so devoted to prayers and vigils that &quot;he obtained victory more by the supplications he poured forth to God, than by arms of war.&quot; Before accepting supreme command of the army, Narses built a church and monastery in Cappadocia, intent upon going there upon his retirement. Paul the Deacon, a late 8th century Lombard writer, insisted that Narses was a Catholic, but John of Ephesus, a Monophysite contemporary of Narses, wrote that Narses staffed his monastery with exiled Monophysite monks.

==Early career==
How or when Narses arrived in Constantinople, or exactly how he found a footing in the &quot;officium&quot; of the Grand Chamberlain, remains unknown. When Procopius first mentions Narses, he was serving as Emperor Justinian I&#x27;s steward (&quot;cubicularius&quot;) in 530. Narses was also a high treasurer who dealt with the emperor&#x27;s finances and payments from the imperial treasury, probably holding the post of &quot;sacellarius&quot;. He rose through the ranks, became the commander of the emperor&#x27;s eunuch bodyguard (&quot;spatharius&quot;) c. 532, and eventually became Grand Chamberlain (&quot;praepositus sacri cubiculi&quot;) around 537/538. Despite his later military commands, he is never attested as Master of Soldiers (&quot;magister militum&quot;) in formal documents. Narses became a patrician in the 550s. Although Theodosius II was alleged to have, in 422, barred eunuchs from serving as patricians, Justinian overturned this law.

==Nika riots==
Narses had a part in quashing the Nika riots in 532; he was instructed by Justinian to take sufficient funds to bribe the Blue Faction&#x27;s leaders. Narses distributed the money and persuaded the Blue faction to support Justinian and turn against Hypatius, who had been proclaimed as emperor by the rebels. He was also involved in slaughtering the rebels.

==Military career==
Narses&#x27; involvement and help in suppressing the Nika Riots suddenly found him in charge of a moderately-sized army that would go to Italy to help Belisarius. The army arrived in June of 538 probably in Ancona and consisted of roughly 7,000 soldiers. (Every army that Narses commanded was made up of very diverse peoples, drawing from many of the surrounding tribes.) Procopius referred to Narses as the eunuch and keeper of the royal treasuries, and described him as &quot;keen and more energetic than would be expected of a eunuch&quot;. Narses met with Belisarius at Firmum where a council of war was held. The council discussed what should happen regarding the Siege of Ariminum and with the commander of troops, John, who was a close friend of Narses. Narses commented that he had already been punished for his &quot;insolence&quot; and that if the Goths took Rimini then it could turn the tide of the war. Belisarius and Narses led a column of troops through inland mountainous routes to descend upon Rimini from the northwest.

John owed his thanks to Narses for convincing Belisarius, and according to Procopius, commented on the relationship between the two men. &quot;And from that time both these men [Belisarius and Narses] began to regard each other with great suspicion.&quot; During the autumn and winter months of 538–39, the Army in Italy was divided into two parties, between Belisarius and Narses. Justinian himself dispatched a letter to Belisarius, stating that &quot;We have not sent our steward Narses to Italy in order to command the army; for we wish Belisarius alone to command the whole army in whatever manner seems to him best, and it is the duty of all of you to follow him in the interest of the state.&quot; The division however remained and the city of Milan was to fall victim to the divided command. Narses was recalled to Constantinople, but not in disgrace, as he was allowed to retain some of his barbarian guardsmen.

After being recalled, Narses seemed to have lost &quot;none of his favour at court, [and] remained the most trusted servant and minister of the Emperor and his consort.&quot; In 541, Narses was believed to have helped the Empress Theodora and Antonina (wife of Belisarius) with the overthrow of John the Cappadocian. In late 541 or early 542, Narses was sent by Justinian to investigate popular disturbances near the Golden Gate of Constantinople. He received a report that a prophetess&#x27; foretelling of deadly floods had agitated the crowds. In 545, Justinian sent Narses to the rulers of the Heruli to recruit troops to join Belisarius in Italy. When the Heruli troops were accompanying Narses to Thrace, they unexpectedly encountered and defeated the Sclaveni raiders.

==Return to Italy==
Finally in 551, Narses was sent back to Italy, where he was to achieve his greatest victories. Germanus, a cousin of the Emperor, was appointed by Justinian to finish what Belisarius had started a decade before. However, on his way to Italy in 550, Germanus fell ill and &quot;abruptly reached the term of life.&quot; Narses was appointed the new commander of the army, given supreme command and returned to Italy where twelve years previously he had been recalled. Many historians believe that Narses was put in command because of his old age, so that he would never be able to rebel successfully against Justinian.

Narses&#x27; greatest asset in his newfound position was to have access to the Emperor&#x27;s financial resources. With the treasury, Narses was able to amass anywhere between 20,000 and 30,000 troops. Narses also seemed to be well liked by many of the soldiers of fortune, as he had treated them &quot;especially well&quot;. Procopius reported that Narses had built an army that in the requirement of men and arms was &quot;worthy of the Roman Empire&quot;. The army reflected many of Narses&#x27; previous commands, in that most of the troops were barbarians.

Narses was to take more than a year to reach Italy after his appointment, as his entire army made a long march along the coast of the Adriatic Sea. Totila the Ostrogothic king controlled the sea of eastern Italy and hampered supply ships that set sail for Narses&#x27; army. John from Salona led 38 ships and Valerian sailed with 12 to meet Totila&#x27;s force and bring relief to Ancona. Procopius described the subsequent Battle of Sena Gallica as a naval battle that resembled a battle on land. &quot;There were arrows discharged and fighting at close quarters with sword and spear, just as on a battle field.&quot; The Byzantine victory at Sena Gallica was overwhelming, as 36 of the 47 Gothic ships were destroyed, and Gibal, a Gothic admiral, was captured. Historian Archibald R. Lewis pointed out that victory could only come to Narses after Totila&#x27;s sea dominance was brought to an end.

There were a number of reasons that Narses&#x27; march was very slow. Totila had dispatched various troops to employ delaying tactics and the Franks were enemies of Narses&#x27; allies the Lombards, and did not allow free passage. Procopius stated that Narses was &quot;completely bewildered&quot;, but John was familiar with that part of Italy and advised him how to continue. Using this advice, Narses was able to reach Ravenna unopposed. Totila may have believed that Narses was going to come from the sea, whence all the previous invasions had come.

==Battle of Taginae==
On his way to seek Totila&#x27;s main army, Narses encountered a small Gothic garrison at the town of Rimini. John, who had previously been in command at Rimini when it was besieged by Gothic forces, again gave advice to Narses on how to proceed. The exact route taken was not precisely indicated by Procopius and has led to confusion on the reconstruction of the coming battles. Procopius referred to the next battle as &quot;Busta Gallorum&quot;, but many historians now refer to it as the Battle of Taginae.

Narses sent word to Totila and gave him a chance to either surrender, or give the day in which the battle would take place. Procopius quoted Totila&#x27;s response, &quot;At the end of eight days let us match our strength.&quot; Narses was not fooled by this and preferred the tactical defensive upon meeting Totila, as his army would have been larger than that of Totila. The following battle would be Narses&#x27; ultimate victory, and would set the estimation of his military talents as not inferior to those of Belisarius.

===Tactics===
Narses&#x27; great success at the Battle of Taginae was to come from the disposition of his forces before the battle began. Narses arrayed his troops in a &quot;crescent shaped&quot; formation with mostly infantry in the middle, flanked by archers. The infantry were in fact dismounted barbarian cavalry, since many of the Goths thought that typical infantry was frail and would flee in the face of a charge. Some historians feel there may have been a political motivation by placing the Heruli and Lombards in the centre dismounted, Narses possibly suspecting them of having sympathy or admiration for Totila.

On the sides of the crescent, foot-archers were placed, and this enabled them to destroy the Gothic cavalry through enfilading fire. (This disposition of the archers and their effect upon the battle is strikingly parallel to the later Battle of Agincourt.) Next, Narses placed much of his cavalry on the immediate sides of the dismounted infantry. Normally the cavalry would have been behind the centre, but they were not meant to aid any of the struggling line. Instead they were used to deliver a surprise attack on the Goths when they became fully enveloped. Narses knew that Totila would take the advantage of attacking the &quot;weak&quot; centre, and therefore allowed Narses to completely destroy the Ostrogothic army. Procopius said that Totila had been &quot;out-generalled by his own folly&quot;, because Totila had instructed his troops to only engage with spears, as he thought a quick strike would win the battle.

Totila sent wave after wave of troops, who became so disorganized by the raining arrow storm that by the time they met the dismounted infantrymen they were completely broken. The Gothic infantry never even engaged in actual combat as they hesitated to advance far enough to actually become effective. They were kept in the rear of the advance, fearing that Narses&#x27; horsemen would outflank them from the hill. Finally, Totila&#x27;s cavalry was pressed backwards onto their own line of infantry, Narses then charged with his own cavalry, which had been held in reserve. The retreat quickly turned into a rout, as the Gothic cavalry rushed right over the infantry, who joined them in the withdrawal.

Totila himself was killed at this battle and Procopius gave two versions as to the fate of the Ostrogothic king. The first has Totila initially surviving the battle and fleeing the field of battle with only five of his followers. Asbad, leader of the Gepids, overtook him and drove his spear into Totila. The body was immediately taken to the village of Caprae where it was hurriedly buried. In the second version, Totila was mortally wounded in the first wave, struck by a bowman who did not even recognize his target. The first is more widely accepted by historians, as later a Gothic woman revealed where Totila was buried and the body was exhumed and positively identified.

==Rome==
Narses marched to Rome after the Battle of Taginae and had to conduct a short siege of the city. Narses attacked on one side with a large contingent of archers, while John assaulted another part of the walls. From Rome, Narses would work to remove all of the remaining Ostrogothic forces from Italy. The next major move that Narses undertook was to capture the treasury of Totila that was held in Cumae. Both Procopius and Agathias wrote of the strength of the fortress at Cumae. Procopius called it, &quot;an exceedingly strong fortress,&quot; and Agathias declared it &quot;very well fortified.&quot;

As parts of the army were sent throughout the country to deal with Teias (the son of Totila, and new Gothic king), a considerable detachment was sent to Campania to take Cumae. Teias followed the example set by Narses on his march into Italy and marched around the Imperial Army. After engaging Narses in small skirmishes for nearly two months, Teias retreated into the mountains. They maneuvered onto Mons Lactarius, where they soon faced death from starvation.

==Battle of Mons Lactarius==
The Goths suddenly came down the mountain in a compact phalanx, catching the army off guard who were also on foot. The reasons why the Goths attacked horseless is unknown, but the suddenness of the attack seemed to be the reason that Narses fought horseless as well. The ensuing battle was fought for two days and Procopius described the bravery of King Teias. He first introduced the battle as &quot;a battle of great note,&quot; and the heroism displayed by King Teias was not &quot;inferior to any of the heroes of legend.&quot; It may be noted that Procopius did not witness any of the battle, and only retold it from the account of others.

Teias led the charge towards Narses. Procopius recounts that every time his shield was filled with arrows, he received another from his man-at-arms. Finally when a spear struck his shield, he received another but was struck with a mortal blow. The soldier cut off his head to display to the Goths their king had died, but instead of disheartening the Goths, it reinvigorated them to fight for another day. The second day was much like the first, as the Goths charged and fought on foot, involving little to no tactics. Finally, the Goths sent some of their officers to Narses who said they would surrender if they were allowed to leave the country safely. Narses, who received more advice from John, accepted those terms of surrender.

==Final battles==
After the final defeat of the Goths, the Franks, led by the brothers Leutharis and Buccillinus, attempted to invade the recently reconquered lands. From the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;: &quot;They (The Franks) in like manner wasted Italy. But with the help of the Lord they too were destroyed by Narses. And all Italy rejoiced.&quot; For the next year or two, Narses crossed the countryside, reinstituting Byzantine rule and laying siege to towns that resisted. But as more and more Franks poured over the Alps, Narses regrouped in Rome, and once spring came, marched his army against them. The Franks, led by the two brothers, were pursuing separate routes, but plundering the whole time.

At the Battle of Casilinum, Narses put true heavy infantry in the centre, instead of dismounted cavalry. These were hand picked troops, &quot;Ante-signani&quot;, who wore long clad coats of mail that went down to their feet. Highly trained cavalry were on the flanks, armed with everything that the army carried. On the opposing side, Agathias describes the Franks as, &quot;Very rude and without cavalry. Their swords were worn on the left leg, and their main weapons were the throwing ax and hooked javelins.&quot; The Franks attacked Narses&#x27; centre, which was initially pushed back but was reinforced by the Heruli, who slowed the attackers.

At this point Narses had the cavalry wheel in from the flanks, but without directly engaging the Franks. Instead, he had them unleash an enormous number of arrows into the half-naked barbarians. Finally the Franks became disorganized and their tightly held formations broke down. Narses sounded a general charge that blasted their ranks, and mowed them down. The Franks were massacred and Agathias claimed that only five of them escaped from Narses that day. All three of Narses&#x27; major victories can be credited to his skillful use of combined tactics involving cavalry and archers to create and exploit disorder in his enemies. Afterwards, in the autumn of 554, the triumphant Narses returned to Rome, possibly to celebrate a formal Triumph; but Agathias, the sole source for the possibility, &quot;does not provide even a rhetorical account of this&quot;, and gives no further detail.

==Final years==
For the next twelve years, Narses may have stayed in Italy and &quot;set about to reorganize&quot; its government. Justinian sent Narses a series of new decrees known as &quot;pragmatic sanctions&quot;. Many historians refer to Narses in this part of his career as an Exarch. Narses completed some restoration projects in Italy but was unable to return Rome to its former splendor, though he did repair many of the bridges into the city and rebuild the city&#x27;s walls.

Little is known of Narses&#x27; last years. Some historians believe he died in 567, while others assert that he died in 574, in which case he may have reached the age of 96.

Legend has it that Narses was recalled to Constantinople for turning the Romans under his rule into virtual slaves, thereby upsetting the new Emperor Justin II and his wife, the Empress Sophia. Narses then retired to Naples. In an apocryphal but often retold story, Sophia sent Narses a golden distaff with the sarcastic message that he was invited to return to the palace and oversee the women&#x27;s spinning, and Narses is said to have replied that he would spin a thread of which neither she nor Justin would ever find the end. From Naples, Narses supposedly sent word to the Lombards inviting them to invade northern Italy. 

The historian Dunlap questions whether there was hostility between the empress and Narses. Paul the Deacon wrote that his body was returned to Constantinople; his peaceful retirement contradicts the story that he had invited the Lombards into Italy. John of Ephesus wrote that Narses was buried in the presence of the Emperor and Empress in a Bithynian monastery founded by him.

<text>Ernest Frederick &quot;Fritz&quot; Hollings (January 1, 1922April 6, 2019) was an American politician from South Carolina. A member of the Democratic Party who was a Conservative Democrat, he served as a member of the South Carolina House of Representatives from 1949 to 1954, the 77th lieutenant governor of South Carolina from 1959 to 1963, the 106th governor of South Carolina from 1959 to 1963, and a member of the United States Senate from South Carolina from 1966 to 2005. He served alongside Democrat-turned-Republican Senator Strom Thurmond for 36 years, making them the longest-serving duo in U.S. Senate history. At the time of his death, he was the oldest living former U.S. senator and the second-oldest living American governor. As of 2025, he is the last Democrat to hold or win a U.S. Senate seat in South Carolina.

Born in Charleston, South Carolina, Hollings graduated from The Citadel in 1942 and joined a law practice in Charleston after attending the Joseph F. Rice School of Law. During World War II, he served as an artillery officer in campaigns in North Africa and Europe. After the war, Hollings successively won election to the South Carolina House of Representatives, as lieutenant governor, and as governor. He sought election to the Senate in 1962 but was defeated by incumbent Olin D. Johnston.

Johnston died in 1965, and the following year Hollings won a special election to serve the remainder of Johnston&#x27;s term. Hollings remained popular and continually won re-election, becoming one of the longest-serving senators in U.S. history. Hollings sought the Democratic nomination in the 1984 presidential election but dropped out of the race after the New Hampshire primary. He declined to seek re-election in 2004 and was succeeded by Republican Jim DeMint.

==Early life==

Hollings was born in Charleston, South Carolina, the son of Wilhelmine Dorothea Meyer (1888–1982) and Adolph Gevert Hollings, Sr. (1882–1940). He was of German descent. Hollings was raised at 338 President St. in the Hampton Park Terrace neighborhood from age 10 until he enrolled in college.

==Education and personal life==

Hollings graduated from The Citadel in 1942, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree. He achieved a Bachelor of Laws in 1947 after one year and nine months at the University of South Carolina, and joined a law practice in Charleston. Hollings was a member of the Pi Kappa Phi fraternity. He was a member of the German Friendly Society of Charleston from 1976 to 1991.

Hollings was married to Rita Liddy &quot;Peatsy&quot; Hollings from August 21, 1971, until her death in October 2012. He had four children (Michael, Helen, Patricia Salley, and Ernest III) with his first wife, Martha Patricia Salley Hollings, whom he married on March 30, 1946. He was a Lutheran. In addition, Fritz and Patricia had two sons who died.

Hollings served as an officer in the United States Army&#x27;s 353rd and 457th Artillery units from 1942 to 1945, during World War II, and was awarded the Bronze Star Medal for meritorious service in direct support of combat operations from December 13, 1944, to May 1, 1945, in France and Germany. He received the European–African–Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with five Bronze Service Stars for participation in the Tunisia, Southern France, Rome-Arno, and Central Europe Campaigns.

==Political career==

Hollings served three terms in the South Carolina House of Representatives from 1949 to 1954. In 1950, following the notorious Lynching of Willie Earle, Hollings authored a law that mandated the death penalty for lynching. No lynchings occurred in South Carolina after that law was enacted. After only one term, Hollings&#x27;s colleagues elected him Speaker &quot;Pro Tempore&quot; in 1951 and 1953. He was subsequently elected Lieutenant Governor of South Carolina in 1954, and Governor of South Carolina in 1958 at the age of 36.

===Governor of South Carolina===

As governor of South Carolina from January 20, 1959, to January 15, 1963, Hollings worked to improve the state&#x27;s educational system, helping to bring more industry and employment opportunities to the state. His term in office saw the establishment of the state&#x27;s technical education system and its educational television network. He also called for and achieved significant increases in teachers&#x27; salaries, bringing them closer to the regional average. At the 1961 Governor&#x27;s Conference on Business, Industry, Education and Agriculture in Columbia, South Carolina, he declared, &quot;Today, in our complex society, education is the cornerstone upon which economic development must be builtand prosperity assured.&quot;

During Hollings&#x27;s term as governor, the Confederate battle flag was flown above the South Carolina State House underneath the U.S. and state flags. The battle flag was placed over the dome in 1962 by a concurrent resolution of the state legislature during the commemoration of the Civil War centennial. The resolution failed to designate a time for its removal. In 2000 the state legislature voted to move the flag from above the state house to a Confederate soldiers&#x27; monument in front of the building, where it remained until 2015, when Republican governor Nikki Haley ordered it removed following Charleston church shooting by a Neo-Confederate in the state earlier that year.

Hollings did little to either support or oppose the civil rights movement as governor, and instead took pride in the lack of civil rights violence that occurred in the state. In his last address to the General Assembly on January 9, 1963, ahead of the peaceful admission to Clemson University of its first African American student, Harvey Gantt, Hollings declared: &quot;As we meet, South Carolina is running out of courts... this General Assembly must make clear South Carolina&#x27;s choice, a government of laws rather than a government of men... This should be done with dignity. It should be done with law and order.&quot;

Hollings oversaw the last executions in South Carolina before &quot;Furman v. Georgia&quot;, a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States, which temporarily banned capital punishment. During his term, eight inmates were put to death by electric chair. The last was rapist Douglas Thorne, on April 20, 1962.

He sought the Democratic nomination for a seat in the United States Senate in 1962 but lost to incumbent Olin D. Johnston.

===United States Senator===
====Early Senate career====
Johnston died on April 18, 1965. Hollings&#x27;s successor as governor, Donald S. Russell, resigned in order to accept appointment to the Senate seat. In the summer of 1966, Hollings defeated Russell in the Democratic primary for the remaining two years of the term. He then narrowly won the special election on November 8, 1966, against the Democrat-turned-Republican Marshall Parker by 11,758 votes, and was sworn in shortly thereafter. He gained seniority on other newly elected U.S. senators who would have to wait until January 1967 to take the oath of office. In 1967, he was one of eleven senators who voted against the nomination of Thurgood Marshall to become the first black justice on the U.S. Supreme Court. The following year, Hollings won the Senate seat for his first full term when he again defeated Marshall Parker this time by 155,280 votes.

For over 36 years (from November 9, 1966, until January 3, 2003), he served alongside Democrat-turned-Republican Strom Thurmond, making them the longest-serving state delegation duo in U.S. Senate history to date. Thurmond and Hollings generally had a good relationship despite their sometimes sharp philosophical differences, and frequently collaborated on legislation and projects for South Carolina. Hollings was also the thirteenth-longest-serving U.S. Senator.

In 1970, Hollings authored &quot;The Case Against Hunger: A Demand for a National Policy&quot;, acknowledging the Reverend I. DeQuincey Newman and Sister Mary Anthony for opening his eyes to the despair caused by hunger and helping him realize that he must do something about it. Hollings made headlines the year before when he toured poverty-stricken areas of South Carolina, often referred to as his &quot;Hunger Tours&quot;. He was accused of drawing unwanted attention to South Carolina while other states, both northern and southern, also faced extreme poverty. Hollings knew South Carolina was not alone in its struggle and thought that if any politician was going to investigate hunger in South Carolina, it was going to at least be a South Carolinian. After a tour of an East Charleston slum, he said, &quot;I don&#x27;t want Romney and Kennedy coming here to look at my slums. As a matter of fact when I get caught up with my work, I think I may go look at the slums of Boston.&quot; For his efforts, Hollings was also accused of &quot;scheming for the Negro vote&quot;. Hollings, who had seen plenty of white hunger and poverty and slums on his tours, responded, &quot;You just don&#x27;t make political points on hunger. The poor aren&#x27;t registered to vote and they won&#x27;t vote.&quot; In February 1969, however, Hollings testified as to what he had seen on his fact-finding tours in front of the United States Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs. Charleston&#x27;s &quot;News and Courier&quot; (now &quot;The Post and Courier&quot;) reported that &quot;Senators, members of the press corps and visitors packed in the hearing room watched and listened in disbelief as Hollings detailed dozens of tragically poignant scenes of human suffering in his state.&quot; Hollings recommended to the committee that free food stamps from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program be distributed to the most needy, and just over a day later, Senator George McGovern from South Dakota announced that free food stamps would be distributed in South Carolina as part of a national pilot program for feeding the hungry.

Hollings and his first wife separated in 1970 and divorced in 1971. Their children lived with their mother, and Hollings never discussed the reason for the divorce. Later that year, he married Rita Liddy &quot;Peatsy&quot; Hollings (born 1935), who was 13 years his junior. She had joined his administrative staff in 1967. It was her first and his second marriage. They were married 41 years until her death in 2012.

In the 1970s, Hollings joined with fellow senators Ted Kennedy from Massachusetts and Henry M. Jackson from Washington in a press conference to oppose President of the United States Gerald Ford&#x27;s request that Congress end Richard Nixon&#x27;s price controls on domestic oil, which had helped to cause the gasoline lines during the 1973 oil crisis. Hollings said he believed ending the price controls (as was eventually done in 1981) would be a &quot;catastrophe&quot; that would cause &quot;economic chaos&quot;.

In February 1970, during a session of debate on federal aid to school districts serving children living in public housing units, Hollings asked Senator Jacob Javits of New York if he would support the anti-busing amendment given that it was based on New York law.

In September 1970, during a speech at the University of Georgia in Athens, Georgia, Hollings declared that the United States could not afford such &quot;leadership by political bamboozle&quot;, calling on Americans to ignore the voices of discord and unite for &quot;meaningful changes&quot; in society. Hollings said President Nixon had led the U.S. down a &quot;clamorous road of drift and division&quot; and criticized the &quot;ranting rhetoric&quot; of Vice President of the United States Spiro Agnew. Hollings attributed the principal blame for the disunity of the U.S. on special interest groups and &quot;impatient minority blocs&quot; that had shouted &quot;non negotiable demands&quot;. Hollings linked former President Johnson and President Nixon with having both &quot;attacked the politics of the problem rather than the problems themselves&quot;.

In February 1971, Hollings introduced Ted Kennedy in Charleston, South Carolina, ahead of his remarks calling for an end to the Vietnam War. Hollings disclosed that Kennedy had sought his advice on how to answer reporters&#x27; questions regarding a possible presidential campaign and that Kennedy believed his visit would spark speculation on the part of reporters about a campaign regardless of what he said.

In November 1971, Hollings announced his opposition to the nomination of Earl Butz for United States Secretary of Agriculture.

In 1972, Hollings and Republican William B. Saxbe sponsored a resolution bestowing early United States recognition on Bangladesh as the Nixon administration sought a policy of delaying recognition until &quot;there were commensurate diplomatic benefits to the United States.&quot;

In 1977, Hollings was one of five Democrats to vote against the nomination of Ray Marshall as United States Secretary of Labor.

In early 1979, United States Secretary of State Cyrus Vance sought permission from a Senate Appropriations subcommittee to transfer $2million in funds for the American Embassy to the new unofficial American Institute in Taiwan. Hollings was one of four members of the committee to oppose Vance&#x27;s request during the latter&#x27;s appearance before the subcommittee and Hollings later sent a letter to Vance declining the request. Hollings explained that &quot;a smooth transition to unofficial relations may be threatened&quot; in the event of funds not being transferred to the American Institute before the American Embassy in Taiwan ceased its function by its designated date of March 1. Hollings&#x27;s opposition was considered unusual given that most requests were approved and State Department officials publicly stated their wishes for Hollings and his colleagues to drop their opposition in the face of Taiwan&#x27;s reluctant agreement to setting up &quot;nongovernmental body in Washington&quot; that would serve as the counterpart to the American Institute in Taipei.

Hollings opposed legislation in 1979 that would admit additional ethnic Chinese refugees amid increased concern regarding moves by the Vietnamese government.

In August 1979, Hollings announced his opposition to the United States-Soviet Union nuclear arms treaty, saying the treaty should be defeated unless amended with a reduction of Soviet military power. His proposal was believed to stir Russian disapproval of the treaty if implemented. Hollings also made an unsuccessful attempt to persuade the United States Senate Committee on the Budget to add $2.6billion for a recommendation for military spending that would be included in Congress&#x27;s second concurrent resolution on the budget.

====Presidential candidate====

Hollings unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for President of the United States in the 1984 United States presidential election. Hollings&#x27;s wit and experience, as well as his call for a budget freeze, won him some positive attention, but his relatively conservative record alienated liberal Democrats, and he was never really noticed in a field dominated by Walter Mondale, John Glenn and Gary Hart. Hollings dropped out two days after losing badly in the New Hampshire Primary, and endorsed Hart a week later. His disdain for his competitors sometimes showed. He notably referred to Mondale as a &quot;lapdog&quot; and to former astronaut Glenn as a &quot;Sky King&quot; who was &quot;confused in his capsule&quot;.

====Later Senate career====

On March 24, 1981, Hollings introduced legislation that if passed would restore the military draft with limited deferments and exemptions and stipulating that men aged 18 to 22 years old would be required to spend nine months of active service for basic training that potentially would precede reserve duty. Hollings&#x27;s proposal granted deferments &quot;to people on active duty, in the reserves or in advanced Reserve Officers Training Corps study; surviving sons or brothers of those killed in war or missing in action; conscientious objectors and ministers; doctors and others in vital health professions, and judges of courts of record and elected officials&quot;. Hollings stated that recruiting for the armed forces had fallen short of requirements by an estimated 23,000 people in 1979 and that he believed the draft applying to women &quot;should be across the board&quot; due to the issue continuing to be debated between the public and the courts.

In 1981, Hollings apologized to fellow Democrat Howard Metzenbaum after Hollings referred to him as the &quot;senator from B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith&quot; on the floor. Metzenbaum, who was Jewish, raised a question of privilege and Hollings&#x27;s remarks were stricken from the record.

In March 1985, the Senate Budget Committee approved a proposal sponsored by Hollings freezing military spending by not allowing any growth above inflation in fiscal year 1986 and bestowing three percent hikes in the following two years, Hollings after the vote saying that a pattern had been set for similar action on other budget items and predicted that the Budget Committee would also go against another Reagan administration supported position by freezing Social Security cost of living increases.

On May 1, 1985, the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation rejected an amendment to a bill reauthorizing the Federal Communications Commission prohibiting public television stations from swapping channels with commercial stations, Hollings afterward stating that the vote was &quot;a tragic abdication by Congress of its over 60-year-old responsibility to protect the public&#x27;s interest in broadcasting&quot;.

In October 1985, Hollings and Republicans Phil Gramm and Warren Rudman sponsored an amendment to establish a budget deficit ceiling that would decline to zero by 1991 that was attached to a bill raising the debt limit of the federal government by more than $250billion. The amendment was approved by a vote of 75 to 24 and was stated as a possible prelude to a balanced budget in five years without a tax increase by United States Secretary of the Treasury James Baker.

During the 1988 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Hollings endorsed Jesse Jackson.

In October 1989, Hollings announced from his Washington office that he would request the Government Accountability Office investigate efforts by the Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide timely assistance and funds to victims of Hurricane Hugo the previous month. Hollings charged FEMA with &quot;stonewalling, fretting and filling out forms&quot; and called on the federal government to become more active in trying to relieve areas devastated by Hurricane Hugo.

In April 1990, Hollings planned the compiling of the Senate Budget Committee to vote on a cut in the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, an idea initially forwarded at the end of the previous year by fellow Democratic senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan as a way of making Congress address what he considered to be a serious problem in the management of the Social Security trust funds. Hollings sought a revenue figure which reflected the $36billion tax cut through a rollback of Social Security payroll taxes increases that were scheduled to take effect January1 and confirmed he would ask his colleagues on the budget committee to remove the trust funds from the budget deficit calculation and vote on the 1991 budget including a $300billion deficit. Hollings&#x27;s plan included a five percent value-added tax on goods and services in addition to a ten percent oil import fee as well as an increase in the top income tax rate to thirty-three percent among wealthiest taxpayers. The goal was considered an uphill battle where Hollings could be outmaneuvered in committee with parliamentary tactics that would result in the precluding of a straight up-or-down vote on the Social Security tax cut. Acknowledging this, Hollings said, &quot;They may try to block me. But we will find a bill by God to cut Social Security taxes. There will be a vote.&quot;

In January 1991, Hollings joined most Democratic senators in voting against a resolution authorizing war against Iraq.

In 1993, Hollings told reporters he attended international summits because, &quot;Everybody likes to go to Geneva. I used to do it for the United States Convention on the Law of the Sea conferences and you&#x27;d find those potentates from down in Africa, you know, rather than eating each other, they&#x27;d just come up and get a good square meal in Geneva.&quot; Hollings had previously caused controversy when responding to Yoshio Sakurauchi&#x27;s commentary that Americans are lazy and illiterate. Hollings replied, &quot;You should draw a mushroom cloud and put underneath it, &#x27;Made in America by lazy and illiterate Americans and tested in Japan&#x27;.&quot;

Hollings remained very popular in South Carolina over the years, even as the state became increasingly friendly to Republicans at the national level. In his first three bids for a full term, he never dropped below sixty percent of the vote. In the 1992 election, however, he faced an unexpectedly close race against former Congressman Thomas F. Hartnett in what was otherwise a very good year for Democrats nationally. Hartnett had represented the Charleston area in Congress from 1981 to 1987, thus making him Hollings&#x27;s congressman. His appeal in the Lowcountrytraditionally a swing region at the state levelenabled him to hold Hollings to only fifty percent of the vote.

In his last Senate race in 1998, Hollings faced Republican congressman Bob Inglis. One of the more heated moments of the race was a newspaper interview in which Hollings referred to Inglis as a &quot;goddamn skunk&quot;. Hollings was re-elected by 75,139 votes. 

On January 7, 2003, Hollings introduced the controversial Universal National Service Act of 2006, which would require all men and women aged 18–26 (with some exceptions) to perform a year of military service.

By 2003, Hollings realized that no Democrat could win statewide office in South Carolina&#x27;s current political climate—not even as entrenched an incumbent as himself. On August 4, 2003, he announced that he would not run for re-election in November 2004. Republican Jim DeMint succeeded him.

In his later career, Hollings was moderate politically but was supportive of many civil rights bills. He voted for re-authorizing the Voting Rights Act in 1982. However, in 1967 he was one of the 11 senators who voted against the confirmation of Thurgood Marshall, the first black Supreme Court of the United States justice. Hollings later voted in favor of the unsuccessful nomination of Robert Bork and also for the successful nomination of Clarence Thomas.

On fiscal issues, he was generally conservative, and was one of the primary sponsors of the Gramm–Rudman–Hollings Balanced Act, an attempt to enforce limits on government spending.

Hollings and Howell Heflin of Alabama were the only two Democratic senators to vote against the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993.

==== Entertainment industry ====
As a senator, Hollings supported legislation in the interests of the established media distribution industry (such as the proposed &quot;Consumer Broadband and Digital Television Promotion Act&quot;). His hard-line support of various client-serve model computer restrictions such as Digital rights management and Trusted Computing led the Fritz chip (Trusted Platform Module, a microchip that enforces such restrictions) to be nicknamed after him. Hollings introduced the Consumer Broadband and Digital Television Promotion Act, a draft of the later CBDTPA, which would have mandated &quot;manufacturers of all electronic devices and software to embed government approved copy protection technology in their products&quot;. Hollings also sponsored the Online Personal Privacy Act. According to OpenSecrets, between 1997 and 2002, Hollings received more than $300,000 from the entertainment industry.

Hollings was referred to as the &quot;Senator from Disney&quot; for his lobbying on behalf of the entertainment industry, including industry groups like the Recording Industry Association of America and the Motion Picture Association.

==Post Senatorial life and death==

In retirement, Hollings wrote opinion editorials for newspapers in South Carolina and was a regular contributor to the &quot;HuffPost&quot;. His opinion editorials were also published every week in EconomyInCrisis.org, an independent protectionist news blog. In 2008, the University of South Carolina Press published &quot;Making Government Work&quot;, a book authored by Hollings with Washington, D.C., journalist Kirk Victor, imparting Hollings&#x27;s view on the changes needed in Washington. Among other things, the book recommended a dramatic decrease in the amount of campaign spending. It also attacked free trade policies as inherently destructive, suggesting that certain protectionist measures built the United States and that only a few parties actually benefited from free trade, such as large manufacturing corporations.

The Hollings Cancer Center at the Medical University of South Carolina, in Charleston, was established in 1993.

Hollings started the Hollings Scholarship in 2005. It gave more than a hundred undergraduates from around the country a ten-week internship with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and a monetary scholarship for the school year.

Hollings helped to establish the Hollings Center for International Dialogue, an organization that promotes dialogue between the United States and Turkey, the nations of the Middle East, North Africa, and Southwest Asia, and other countries with predominantly Muslim populations in order to open channels of communication, deepen cross-cultural understanding, expand people-to-people contacts, and generate new thinking on important international issues.

Hollings was also on the board of advisors as a distinguished visiting professor of Law with the Charleston School of Law. He delivered the commencement address to the first graduating class there on May 19, 2007.

In 2008, the University of South Carolina announced their new library would be named The Ernest F. Hollings Special Collections Library. The $18-million library was built behind the Thomas Cooper Library and is home to The Irvin Department of Rare Books &amp; Special Collections, South Carolina Political Collections, and Digital Collections. It is also home to the Dorothy B. Smith Reading Room.

On April 6, 2019, Hollings died at the age of 97 at his home in Isle of Palms, South Carolina, following a period of declining health. Future President Joe Biden delivered the eulogy at his funeral.

<doc id="46738" wikidata="Q192785" url="?curid=46738" title="Goliath">
<text>Goliath ( ) is a Philistine giant in the Book of Samuel. Descriptions of Goliath&#x27;s immense stature vary among biblical sources, with various texts describing him as either or tall. According to the text, Goliath issued a challenge to the Israelites, daring them to send forth a champion to engage him in single combat; he was ultimately defeated by the young shepherd David, employing a sling and stone as a weapon. The narrative signified King Saul&#x27;s unfitness to rule, as Saul himself should have fought for the Kingdom of Israel. 

Some modern scholars believe that the original slayer of Goliath may have been Elhanan, son of Jair, who features in 2 Samuel 21:19, in which Elhanan kills Goliath the Gittite, and that the authors of the Deuteronomistic history changed the original text to credit the victory to the more famous figure David.

The phrase &quot;David and Goliath&quot; has taken on a more popular meaning denoting an underdog situation, a contest wherein a smaller, weaker opponent faces a much bigger, stronger adversary.

==Biblical accounts==
In 1 Samuel 17, Saul and the Israelites are facing the Philistines in the Valley of Elah. Twice a day for 40 days, morning and evening, Goliath, the champion of the Philistines, comes out between the lines and challenges the Israelites to send out a champion of their own to decide the outcome in single combat, but Saul is afraid. David accepts the challenge. Saul reluctantly agrees and offers his armour, which David declines, taking only his staff, sling, and five stones from a brook.

David and Goliath confront each other, Goliath with his armor and javelin, David with his and sling. &quot;The Philistine cursed David by his gods&quot;, but David replies: 

David hurls a stone from his sling and hits Goliath in the center of his forehead, Goliath falls on his face to the ground, and David cuts off his head. The Philistines flee and are pursued by the Israelites &quot;as far as Gath and the gates of Ekron&quot;. David puts the armor of Goliath in his own tent and takes the head to Jerusalem, and Saul sends Abner to bring the boy to him. The king asks whose son he is, and David answers: 

==Composition of the Book of Samuel==
The Books of Samuel, together with the books of Joshua, Judges and Kings, make up a unified history of Israel which biblical scholars call the Deuteronomistic History. The first edition of the history was probably written at the court of Judah&#x27;s King Josiah (late 7th century BCE) and a revised second edition during the exile (6th century BCE), with further revisions in the post-exilic period. Traces of this can be seen in contradictions within the Goliath story, such as that between 1 Samuel 17:54, which says that David took Goliath&#x27;s head to Jerusalem, although according to 2 Samuel 5 Jerusalem at that time was still a Jebusite stronghold and was not captured until David became king.

==Structure of the David and Goliath narrative==
The Goliath story is made up of base-narrative with numerous additions made probably after the exile:

:&quot; Original story&quot;
* The Israelites and Philistines face each other; Goliath makes his challenge to single combat;
* David volunteers to fight Goliath;
* David selects five smooth stones from a creek-bed to be used in his sling;
* David&#x27;s courage strengthens others and eventually others defeat four other giants, possibly brothers, but relatives, reference 2 Samuel 21:15-22.
* David defeats Goliath, the Philistines flee the battlefield.

:&quot;Additions&quot;
* David is sent by his father to bring food to his brothers, hears the challenge, and expresses his desire to accept; 
* Details of the account of the battle;
* Saul asks who David is, and he is introduced to the king through Abner.

The oldest manuscripts, namely the Dead Sea Scrolls text of Samuel from the late 1st century BCE, the 1st-century CE historian Josephus, and the major Septuagint manuscripts, all give Goliath&#x27;s height as &quot;four cubits and a span&quot; (), whereas the Masoretic Text has &quot;six cubits and a span&quot; (). Many scholars have suggested that the smaller number grew in the course of transmission (only a few have suggested the reverse, that an original larger number was reduced), possibly when a scribe&#x27;s eye was drawn to the number six in line 17:7.

===Goliath and Saul===
The underlying purpose of the story of Goliath is to show that Saul is not fit to be king (but that David is). Saul was chosen to lead the Israelites against their enemies, but when faced with Goliath, he refuses to do so; Saul is a head taller than anyone else in all Israel (1 Samuel 9:2), which implies he was over tall and the obvious challenger for Goliath, yet David is the one who eventually defeated him. Also, Saul&#x27;s armour and weaponry are apparently no better than Goliath&#x27;s: 

David&#x27;s speech in 1 Samuel 17 can be interpreted as referring to both Saul and Goliath through its animal imagery. When this imagery is considered closely, David can be seen to function as the true king who manipulates wild beasts.

===Elhanan and Goliath===
In 2 Samuel 21, verse 19, the Hebrew Bible tells how Goliath the Gittite was killed by &quot;Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim, the Bethlehemite&quot;. The fourth-century BC 1 Chronicle 20:5 explains the second Goliath by saying that Elhanan &quot;slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath&quot;, constructing the name Lahmi from the last portion of the word &quot;Bethlehemite&quot; (&quot;beit-ha’lahmi&quot;), and the King James Bible adopted this into 2 Samuel 21:18–19, but the Hebrew text at Goliath&#x27;s name makes no mention of the word &quot;brother&quot;. Most scholars dismiss the later 1 Chronicles 20:5 material as &quot;an obvious harmonization&quot;.

===Goliath and the Greeks===
The armor described in 1 Samuel 17 appears typical of Greek armor of the sixth century BCE; narrative formulae such as the settlement of battle by single combat between champions has been thought characteristic of the Homeric epics (the &quot;Iliad&quot;) rather than of the ancient Near East. The designation of Goliath as a , &quot;man of the in-between&quot; (a longstanding difficulty in translating 1 Samuel 17) appears to be a borrowing from Greek &quot;man of the &quot;&quot; ()&quot;, i.e., the space between two opposite army camps where champion combat would take place. Other scholars argue the description is a trustworthy reflection of the armaments that a Philistine warrior would have worn in the tenth century BCE.

A story very similar to that of David and Goliath appears in the Iliad, written –710 BCE, where the young Nestor fights and conquers the giant Ereuthalion. Each giant wields a distinctive weapon—an iron club in Ereuthalion&#x27;s case, a massive bronze spear in Goliath&#x27;s; each giant, clad in armor, comes out of the enemy&#x27;s massed array to challenge all the warriors in the opposing army; in each case the seasoned warriors are afraid, and the challenge is taken up by a stripling, the youngest in his family (Nestor is the twelfth son of Neleus, David the seventh or eighth son of Jesse). In each case an older and more experienced father figure (Nestor&#x27;s own father, David&#x27;s patron Saul) tells the boy that he is too young and inexperienced, but in each case the young hero receives divine aid and the giant is left sprawling on the ground. Nestor, fighting on foot, then takes the chariot of his enemy, while David, on foot, takes the sword of Goliath. The enemy army then flees, the victors pursue and slaughter them and return with their bodies, and the boy-hero is acclaimed by the people.

===Goliath&#x27;s name===
Tell es-Safi, the biblical Gath and traditional home of Goliath, has been the subject of extensive excavations by Israel&#x27;s Bar-Ilan University. The archaeologists have established that this was one of the largest of the Philistine cities until it was destroyed in the ninth century BC, an event from which it never recovered. The Tell es-Safi inscription, a potsherd discovered at the site, and reliably dated to between the tenth to mid-ninth centuries BC, is inscribed with the two names &quot;ʾLWT&quot; and &quot;WLT&quot;. While the names are not directly connected with the biblical Goliath (, &quot;GLYT&quot;), they are etymologically related and demonstrate that the name fits with the context of the late tenth- to early ninth-century BC Philistine culture. The name &quot;Goliath&quot; itself is non-Semitic and has been linked with the Lydian king Alyattes, which also fits the Philistine context of the biblical Goliath story. A similar name, Uliat, is also attested in Carian inscriptions. Aren Maeir, director of the excavation, comments: &quot;Here we have very nice evidence [that] the name Goliath appearing in the Bible in the context of the story of David and Goliath… is not some later literary creation.&quot;

Based on the southwest Anatolian onomastic considerations, Roger D. Woodard proposed *&quot;Walwatta&quot; as a reconstruction of the form ancestral to both Hebrew Goliath and Lydian Alyattes. In this case, the original meaning of Goliath&#x27;s name would be &quot;Lion-man,&quot; thus placing him within the realm of Indo-European warrior-beast mythology.

The Babylonian Talmud explains the name &quot;Goliath, son of Gath&quot; through a reference to his mother&#x27;s promiscuity, based on the Aramaic גַּת (&quot;gat&quot;, winepress), as everyone threshed his mother as people do to grapes in a winepress (Sotah, 42b).

The name sometimes appears in English as Goliah.

==Later traditions==
===Judaism===

According to the Babylonian Talmud (Sotah 42b), Goliath was a son of Orpah, the sister-in-law of Ruth, David&#x27;s own great-grandmother (Ruth → Obed → Jesse → David). Ruth Rabbah, a haggadic and homiletic interpretation of the Book of Ruth, makes the blood relationship even closer, considering Orpah and Ruth to have been full sisters. Orpah was said to have made a pretense of accompanying Ruth but after forty paces left her. Thereafter she led a dissolute life. According to the Jerusalem Talmud, Goliath was born by polyspermy, and had about one hundred fathers.

The Talmud stresses Goliath&#x27;s ungodliness: his taunts before the Israelites included the boast that it was he who had captured the Ark of the Covenant and brought it to the temple of Dagon, and his challenges to combat were made at morning and evening to disturb the Israelites in their prayers. His armor weighed 60 tons, according to rabbi Hanina; 120, according to rabbi Abba bar Kahana; and his sword, which became the sword of David, had marvelous powers. On his death it was found that his heart carried the image of Dagon, who thereby also came to a shameful downfall.

In Pseudo-Philo, believed to have been composed between 135 BCE and 70 CE, David picks up seven stones and writes on them his father&#x27;s name, his own name, and the name of God, one name per stone; then, speaking to Goliath, he says: After David strikes Goliath with the stone he runs to Goliath before he dies, and Goliath says: &quot;Hurry and kill me and rejoice.&quot; David replies: &quot;Before you die, open your eyes and see your slayer.&quot; Goliath sees an angel and tells David that it is not he who has killed him but the angel. Pseudo-Philo then goes on to say that the angel of the Lord changes David&#x27;s appearance so that no one recognizes him, and thus Saul asks who he is.

===Islam===
Goliath appears in chapter 2 of the Quran (2: 247–252), in the narrative of David and Saul&#x27;s battle against the Philistines. Called in Arabic (), Goliath&#x27;s mention in the Quran is concise, although it remains a parallel to the account in the Hebrew Bible. Muslim scholars have tried to trace Goliath&#x27;s origins, most commonly with the Amalekites. Goliath, in early scholarly tradition, became a kind of byword or collective name for the oppressors of the Israelite nation before David. Muslim tradition sees the battle with Goliath as a prefiguration of Muhammad&#x27;s battle of Badr, and sees Goliath as parallel to the enemies that Muhammad faced.

==Modern usages of David and Goliath==
In modern usage, the phrase &quot;David and Goliath&quot; has taken on a secular meaning, denoting an underdog situation, a contest where a smaller, weaker opponent faces a much bigger, stronger adversary; if successful, the underdog may win in an unusual or surprising way.

Theology professor Leonard Greenspoon, in his essay, &quot;David vs. Goliath in the Sports Pages&quot;, explains that &quot;most writers use the story for its underdog overtones (the little guy wins) ... Less likely to show up in newsprint is the contrast that was most important to the biblical authors: David&#x27;s victory shows the power of his God, while Goliath&#x27;s defeat reveals the weakness of the Philistine deities.&quot;

The phrase is widely used in news media to succinctly characterize underdog situations in many contexts without religious overtones. Contemporary headlines include: sports (&quot;Haye relishes underdog role in &#x27;David and Goliath&#x27; fight with Nikolai Valuev&quot;—&quot;The Guardian&quot;); business (&quot;On Internet, David-and-Goliath Battle Over Instant Messages&quot;—&quot;The New York Times&quot;); science (&quot;David and Goliath: How a tiny spider catches much larger prey&quot;—&quot;ScienceDaily&quot;; politics (&quot;Dissent in Cuba: David and Goliath&quot;—&quot;The Economist&quot;); social justice (&quot;David-and-Goliath Saga Brings Cable to Skid Row&quot;—&quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;).

Aside from the above allegorical use of &quot;David and Goliath&quot;, there is also the use of &quot;Goliath&quot; for a particularly tall person. For example, basketball player Wilt Chamberlain was nicknamed &quot;Goliath&quot;, which he disliked.

==In popular culture==
American actor Ted Cassidy portrayed Goliath in the TV series &quot;Greatest Heroes of the Bible&quot; (1978). Italian actor Luigi Montefiori portrayed this -tall giant in Paramount&#x27;s 1985 live-action film &quot;King David&quot; as part of a flashback. This film includes the King of the Philistines saying: &quot;Goliath has challenged the Israelites six times and no one has responded.&quot; It is then on the seventh time that David meets his challenge.

Toho and Tsuburaya Productions collaborated on a film called &quot;Daigoro vs. Goliath&quot; (1972), which follows the story relatively closely but recasts the main characters as &quot;kaiju&quot;.

In 2005, Lightstone Studios released a direct-to-DVD movie musical titled &quot;One Smooth Stone&quot;, which was later changed to &quot;David and Goliath&quot;. It is part of the Liken the scriptures (now just Liken) series of movie musicals on DVD based on scripture stories. Thurl Bailey, a former NBA basketball player, was cast to play the part of Goliath in this film.

In 2009, NBC aired Kings, which has a narrative loosely based on the biblical story of King David, but set in a kingdom that culturally and technologically resembles the present-day United States. The part of Goliath is portrayed by a tank, which David destroys with a shoulder-fired rocket launcher.

In 1975, Kaveret recorded and released a humorous interpretation of the Goliath story, with several changes made such as Goliath being the &quot;Demon from Ashkelon&quot;, and David randomly meeting Goliath rather than dueling each other on a battlefield.

===Italian Goliath film series (1960–1964)===
The Italians used Goliath as an action superhero in a series of biblical adventure films (peplums) in the early 1960s. He possessed amazing strength, and the films were similar in theme to their Hercules and Maciste movies. After the classic &quot;Hercules&quot; (1958) became a blockbuster sensation in the film industry, the 1959 Steve Reeves film &quot;Terrore dei Barbari&quot; (&quot;Terror of the Barbarians&quot;) was retitled &quot;Goliath and the Barbarians&quot; in the United States, (after Joseph E. Levine claimed the sole right to the name of &quot;Hercules&quot;); the film was so successful at the box office, it inspired Italian filmmakers to do a series of four more films featuring a beefcake hero named Goliath, although the films were not really related to each other. Note that the Italian film &quot;David and Goliath&quot; (1960), starring Orson Welles, was not one of these, since that film was a straightforward adaptation of the biblical story.

The four titles in the Italian &quot;Goliath&quot; series were as follows:

* &quot;Goliath contro i giganti&quot;/&quot;Goliath Against the Giants&quot; (1960) starring Brad Harris
* &quot;Goliath e la schiava ribelle&quot;/&quot;Goliath and the Rebel Slave&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;The Tyrant of Lydia vs. The Son of Hercules&quot;) (1963) starring Gordon Scott
* &quot;Golia e il cavaliere mascherato&quot;/&quot;Goliath and the Masked Rider&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Hercules and the Masked Rider&quot;) (1964) starring Alan Steel
* &quot;Golia alla conquista di Bagdad&quot;/&quot;Goliath at the Conquest of Baghdad&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Goliath at the Conquest of Damascus&quot;, 1964) starring Peter Lupus

The name Goliath was later inserted into the film titles of three other Italian muscle man movies that were retitled for distribution in the United States in an attempt to cash in on the Goliath craze, but these films were not originally made as Goliath films in Italy.

Both &quot;Goliath and the Vampires&quot; (1961) and &quot;Goliath and the Sins of Babylon&quot; (1963) actually featured the famed superhero Maciste in the original Italian versions, but American distributors did not feel the name Maciste had any meaning to American audiences. &quot;Goliath and the Dragon&quot; (1960) was originally an Italian Hercules film called &quot;The Revenge of Hercules&quot;.

<doc id="46740" wikidata="Q204819" url="?curid=46740" title="Euler's identity">
<text>In mathematics, Euler&#x27;s identity (also known as Euler&#x27;s equation) is the equality
formula_1
where
:formula_2 is Euler&#x27;s number, the base of natural logarithms,
:formula_3 is the imaginary unit, which by definition satisfies formula_4, and
:formula_5 is pi, the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.
Euler&#x27;s identity is named after the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler. It is a special case of Euler&#x27;s formula formula_6 when evaluated for formula_7. Euler&#x27;s identity is considered an exemplar of mathematical beauty, as it shows a profound connection between the most fundamental numbers in mathematics. In addition, it is directly used in a proof that is transcendental, which implies the impossibility of squaring the circle.

==Mathematical beauty==
Euler&#x27;s identity is often cited as an example of deep mathematical beauty. Three of the basic arithmetic operations occur exactly once each: addition, multiplication, and exponentiation. The identity also links five fundamental mathematical constants:
* The number 0, the additive identity
* The number 1, the multiplicative identity
* The number ( = 3.14159...), the fundamental circle constant
* The number ( = 2.71828...), also known as Euler&#x27;s number, which occurs widely in mathematical analysis
* The number, the imaginary unit such that formula_8

The equation is often given in the form of an expression set equal to zero, which is common practice in several areas of mathematics.

Stanford University mathematics professor Keith Devlin has said, &quot;like a Shakespearean sonnet that captures the very essence of love, or a painting that brings out the beauty of the human form that is far more than just skin deep, Euler&#x27;s equation reaches down into the very depths of existence&quot;. Paul Nahin, a professor emeritus at the University of New Hampshire who wrote a book dedicated to Euler&#x27;s formula and its applications in Fourier analysis, said Euler&#x27;s identity is &quot;of exquisite beauty&quot;.

Mathematics writer Constance Reid has said that Euler&#x27;s identity is &quot;the most famous formula in all mathematics&quot;. Benjamin Peirce, a 19th-century American philosopher, mathematician, and professor at Harvard University, after proving Euler&#x27;s identity during a lecture, said that it &quot;is absolutely paradoxical; we cannot understand it, and we don&#x27;t know what it means, but we have proved it, and therefore we know it must be the truth&quot;.

A 1990 poll of readers by &quot;The Mathematical Intelligencer&quot; named Euler&#x27;s identity the &quot;most beautiful theorem in mathematics&quot;. In a 2004 poll of readers by &quot;Physics World&quot;, Euler&#x27;s identity tied with Maxwell&#x27;s equations (of electromagnetism) as the &quot;greatest equation ever&quot;.

At least three books in popular mathematics have been published about Euler&#x27;s identity:
*&quot;Dr. Euler&#x27;s Fabulous Formula: Cures Many Mathematical Ills&quot;, by Paul Nahin (2011)
*&quot;A Most Elegant Equation: Euler&#x27;s formula and the beauty of mathematics&quot;, by David Stipp (2017)
*&quot;Euler&#x27;s Pioneering Equation: The most beautiful theorem in mathematics&quot;, by Robin Wilson (2018).

==Explanations==
===Imaginary exponents===

Euler&#x27;s identity asserts that formula_9 is equal to −1. The expression formula_9 is a special case of the expression formula_11, where is any complex number. In general, formula_11 is defined for complex by extending one of the definitions of the exponential function from real exponents to complex exponents. For example, one common definition is:

:formula_13

Euler&#x27;s identity therefore states that the limit, as approaches infinity, of formula_14 is equal to −1. This limit is illustrated in the animation to the right.
Euler&#x27;s identity is a special case of Euler&#x27;s formula, which states that for any real number ,

: formula_6

where the inputs of the trigonometric functions sine and cosine are given in radians.

In particular, when ,

: formula_16

Since

:formula_17

and

:formula_18

it follows that

: formula_19

which yields Euler&#x27;s identity:

: formula_20

===Geometric interpretation===
Any complex number formula_21 can be represented by the point formula_22 on the complex plane. This point can also be represented in polar coordinates as formula_23, where is the absolute value of (distance from the origin), and formula_24 is the argument of (angle counterclockwise from the positive &quot;x&quot;-axis). By the definitions of sine and cosine, this point has cartesian coordinates of formula_25, implying that formula_26. According to Euler&#x27;s formula, this is equivalent to saying formula_27.

Euler&#x27;s identity says that formula_28. Since formula_9 is formula_30 for = 1 and formula_31, this can be interpreted as a fact about the number −1 on the complex plane: its distance from the origin is 1, and its angle from the positive &quot;x&quot;-axis is formula_5 radians.

Additionally, when any complex number is multiplied by formula_33, it has the effect of rotating formula_34 counterclockwise by an angle of formula_24 on the complex plane. Since multiplication by −1 reflects a point across the origin, Euler&#x27;s identity can be interpreted as saying that rotating any point formula_5 radians around the origin has the same effect as reflecting the point across the origin. Similarly, setting formula_24 equal to formula_38 yields the related equation formula_39 which can be interpreted as saying that rotating any point by one turn around the origin returns it to its original position.

==Generalizations==
Euler&#x27;s identity is also a special case of the more general identity that the th roots of unity, for , add up to 0:

:formula_40

Euler&#x27;s identity is the case where .

A similar identity also applies to quaternion exponential: let be the basis quaternions; then,
:formula_41

More generally, let be a quaternion with a zero real part and a norm equal to 1; that is, formula_42 with formula_43 Then one has
:formula_44

The same formula applies to octonions, with a zero real part and a norm equal to 1. These formulas are a direct generalization of Euler&#x27;s identity, since formula_3 and formula_46 are the only complex numbers with a zero real part and a norm (absolute value) equal to 1.

==History==
Euler&#x27;s identity is a direct result of Euler&#x27;s formula, published in his monumental 1748 work of mathematical analysis, &quot;Introductio in analysin infinitorum&quot;, but it is questionable whether the particular concept of linking five fundamental constants in a compact form can be attributed to Euler himself, as he may never have expressed it.

<text>Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML) is an XML dialect for creating natural language software agents.

== History ==
The XML dialect called AIML was developed by Richard Wallace and a worldwide free software community between 1995 and 2002. AIML formed the basis for what was initially a highly extended Eliza called &quot;A.L.I.C.E.&quot; (&quot;Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity&quot;), which won the annual Loebner Prize Competition in Artificial Intelligence three times, and was also the Chatterbox Challenge Champion in 2004.

Because the A.L.I.C.E. AIML set was released under the GPL, and because most AIML interpreters are offered under a free or open source license, many &quot;Alicebot clones&quot; have been created based upon the original implementation of the program and its AIML knowledge base. Free AIML sets in several languages have been developed and made available by the user community. There are AIML interpreters available in Java, Ruby, Python, C++, C#, Pascal, and other languages (see below ).
A semi-formal specification and a W3C XML Schema for AIML are available.

Since early 2013, The A.L.I.C.E foundation has been working on a draft specification for AIML 2.0.

== Elements of AIML ==
AIML contains several elements. The most important of these are described in further detail below.

=== Categories ===
Categories in AIML form the fundamental unit of knowledge. A category consists of at least two further elements: the pattern and template elements. Here is a simple category:
&lt;category&gt;
 &lt;pattern&gt;WHAT IS YOUR NAME&lt;/pattern&gt;
 &lt;template&gt;My name is Michael N.S Evanious.&lt;/template&gt;
&lt;/category&gt;
When this category is loaded, an AIML bot will respond to the input &quot;What is your name&quot; with the response &quot;My name is Michael N.S Evanious.&quot;

=== Patterns ===
A pattern is a string of characters intended to match one or more user inputs. A literal pattern like

 WHAT IS YOUR NAME

will match only one input, ignoring case: &quot;what is your name&quot;. But patterns may also contain wildcards, which match one or more words. A pattern like

 WHAT IS YOUR *

will match an infinite number of inputs, including &quot;what is your name&quot;, &quot;what is your shoe size&quot;, &quot;what is your purpose in life&quot;, etc.

The AIML pattern syntax is a very simple pattern language, substantially less complex than regular expressions and as such less than level 3 in the Chomsky hierarchy. 
To compensate for the simple pattern matching capabilities, AIML interpreters can provide preprocessing functions to expand abbreviations, remove misspellings, etc.

The AIML syntax itself is at least as complex as finite-state machines and as such at least of level 3 in the Chomsky hierarchy. This is because a state correlates to one topic. To implement that behavior, the topic should have a &quot;*&quot; Pattern to make sure, that the state is not left accidentally. A state transit is implemented with the Tag. This way, the bot will be able to &quot;remember&quot; the topic talked about or even user privileges, which are gained during the chat.

=== Templates ===
A template specifies the response to a matched pattern. A template may be as simple as some literal text, like

 My name is John.

A template may use variables, such as the example

 My name is &lt;bot name=&quot;name&quot;/&gt;.

which will substitute the bot&#x27;s name into the sentence, or

 You told me you are &lt;get name=&quot;user-age&quot;/&gt; years old.

which will substitute the user&#x27;s age (if known) into the sentence.

Template elements include basic text formatting, conditional response (if-then/else), and random responses.

Templates may also redirect to other patterns, using an element called (Symbolic Reduction in Artificial Intelligence). This can be used to implement synonymy, as in this example (where CDATA is used to avoid the need for XML escaping):

&lt;category&gt;
 &lt;pattern&gt;WHAT IS YOUR NAME&lt;/pattern&gt;
 &lt;template&gt;&lt;![CDATA[My name is &lt;bot name=&quot;name&quot;/&gt;.]]&gt;&lt;/template&gt;
&lt;/category&gt;
&lt;category&gt;
 &lt;pattern&gt;WHAT ARE YOU CALLED&lt;/pattern&gt;
 &lt;template&gt;
 &lt;srai&gt;what is your name&lt;/srai&gt;
 &lt;/template&gt;
&lt;/category&gt;
The first category simply answers an input &quot;what is your name&quot; with a statement of the bot&#x27;s name. The second category, however, says that the input &quot;what are you called&quot; should be redirected to the category that matches the input &quot;what is your name&quot;—in other words, it is saying that the two phrases are equivalent.

Templates can contain other types of content, which may be processed by whatever user interface the bot is talking through. So, for example, a template may use HTML tags for formatting, which can be ignored by clients that don&#x27;t support HTML.

<text>Heidelberg (; ) is the fifth-largest city in the German state of Baden-Württemberg, and with a population of about 163,000, of which roughly a quarter consists of students, it is Germany&#x27;s 51st-largest city. Located about south of Frankfurt, Heidelberg is part of the densely populated Rhine-Neckar Metropolitan Region which has its center in Mannheim.

Heidelberg is located on the Neckar River, at the point where it leaves its narrow valley between the Oden Forest and the Little Oden Forest, and enters the wide Upper Rhine Plain. The old town lies in the valley, the end of which is flanked by the Königstuhl in the south and the Heiligenberg in the north. The majority of the population lives in the districts west of the mountains in the Upper Rhine Plain, into which the city has expanded over time.

Heidelberg University, founded in 1386, is Germany&#x27;s oldest and one of Europe&#x27;s most reputable universities. Heidelberg is a scientific hub in Germany and home to several internationally renowned research facilities adjacent to its university, including the European Molecular Biology Laboratory and four Max Planck Institutes. The city has also been a hub for the arts, especially literature, throughout the centuries, and it was designated a &quot;City of Literature&quot; by the UNESCO Creative Cities Network.

Heidelberg was a seat of government of the former Electorate of the Palatinate and is a popular tourist destination due to its romantic cityscape, including Heidelberg Castle, the Philosophers&#x27; Walk, and the Baroque old town.

==Geography==
Heidelberg is located on the eastern edge of the Upper Rhine Plain (), at the place where the river Neckar leaves its narrow valley through the Odenwald mountains and begins the last leg of its journey across the plain towards Mannheim, where it merges into the Rhine about 20 kilometers downstream.

A part of Heidelberg, including the historical old town and the famous Heidelberg Castle, is located in the narrow Neckar valley. Other parts (mostly quarters from around the 19th century or newer, or originally independent, later incorporated villages) sprawl out into the Rhine Plain and along the Bergstraße (), the narrow strip of characteristic landscape along the sharp border between the plain and the Odenwald mountains.

The town is bordered by the Königstuhl (568 m), the Gaisberg (375 m), and the Heiligenberg (445 m) mountains.

Heidelberg is on European walking route E1 (Sweden-Umbria).
===Flora and fauna===
Heidelberg is among the warmest regions of Germany, and plants atypical of the central-European climate flourish there, including almond and fig trees, and many kinds of palm trees and olive trees. Alongside the on the opposite side of the Old Town, winegrowing was restarted in 2000.

There is a wild population of African rose-ringed parakeets, and a wild population of Siberian swan geese, which can be seen mainly on the islands in the Neckar near the district of Bergheim.

===Administrative structures===
Heidelberg is a unitary authority within the Regierungsbezirk Karlsruhe. The Rhein-Neckar-Kreis rural district surrounds it and has its seat in the town, although the town is not a part of the district. Heidelberg is a part of the Rhine-Neckar Metropolitan Region, often referred to as the Rhein-Neckar Triangle.

This region consists of the southern part of the State of Hessen, the southern part of the State of Rhineland-Palatinate (), the administrative districts of Mannheim and Heidelberg, and the municipalities of the Rhein-Neckar-Kreis. The Rhein-Neckar Triangle became a European metropolitan area in 2005.

Heidelberg consists of 15 districts distributed in six sectors of the town. In the central area are Altstadt (the Old Town), Bergheim and Weststadt; in the north, Neuenheim and Handschuhsheim; in the east, Ziegelhausen and Schlierbach; in the south, Südstadt, Rohrbach, Emmertsgrund, and Boxberg; in the southwest, Kirchheim; in the west, Pfaffengrund, Wieblingen, and a new district, named , is built on land in Weststadt and Wieblingen. The new district will have approximately 5,000–6,000 residents and employment for 7,000. Further, new residential space for 10,000–15,000 residents was made available in Patrick Henry Village following the departure of the US Armed Forces.

===Neighbouring communes===
The following towns and communes border the city of Heidelberg, beginning in the west and in a clockwise direction: Edingen-Neckarhausen, Dossenheim, Schriesheim, Wilhelmsfeld, Schönau, Neckargemünd, Bammental, Gaiberg, Leimen, Sandhausen, Oftersheim, Plankstadt, Eppelheim (all part of the Rhein-Neckar-Kreis), and Mannheim.

===Climate===
Heidelberg has an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;), defined by the protected valley between the Pfälzerwald and the Odenwald. The almost year round warm temperatures are usually determined by Atlantic air masses in the winter and increased influence from the western Mediterranean in summer.
In contrast to the nearby Upper Rhine Plain, Heidelberg&#x27;s position in the valley leads to more frequent easterly winds than average. The hillsides of the Odenwald favor clouding and precipitation.

Spring starts earlier than the average in Germany (usually mid February in the recent years). While the weather in spring is typically warm, it is also known to change far more often than in the summer.

Summer starts typically in June and stays until September. In this time the weather is typically stable, with single thunderstorms marking the only precipitation. Day temperatures of around 30 °C are typical, but can reach up to 40 °C during heat waves.

Autumn starts warm in September and cools down to typical winter temperatures for the region by the end of November. Precipitation levels begin to increase and, due to the decreasing sunlight, the region is affected by fog more frequently from the second part of October onwards.

Winters are mostly mild, though light nighttime frosts do occur in the coldest months. Snow is a rare event, and precipitation normally falls as rain. Winters are the wettest time of the year, with frequent western winds blowing from the Atlantic. Storms (&quot;Orkane&quot;) can create severe damage, and the Neckar is often affected by floods.

According to the German Meteorological Service, Heidelberg was the warmest place in Germany in 2009. 

==History==
===Early history===
Between 600,000 and 200,000 years ago, &quot;Heidelberg Man&quot; died at nearby Mauer. His jaw bone was discovered in 1907. Scientific dating determined his remains as the earliest evidence of human life in Europe. In the 5th century BC, a Celtic fortress of refuge and place of worship were built on the , or &quot;Holy Mountain&quot;. Both places can still be identified. In 40 AD, a fort was built and occupied by the 24th Roman cohort and the 2nd Cyrenaican cohort (CCG XXIIII and CCH II CYR). The late Roman Emperor Valentinian I, in 369 AD, built new and maintained older &quot;castra&quot; (permanent camps) and a signal tower on the bank of the Neckar. They built a wooden bridge based on stone pillars across it. The camp protected the first civilian settlements and was eventually captured by Germanic tribes. The local administrative center in Roman times was the nearby city of Lopodunum, today known as Ladenburg.

===Middle Ages===

Modern Heidelberg can trace its beginnings to the fifth century. The village is first mentioned for that period in documents dated to 769 AD. now lies in the middle of modern Heidelberg. The people gradually converted to Christianity. In 870 AD, the monastery of St. Michael was founded on the Heiligenberg inside the double rampart of the Celtic fortress. Around 1130, the Neuburg Monastery was founded in the Neckar valley. At the same time, the bishopric of Worms extended its influence into the valley, founding Schönau Abbey in 1142. Modern Heidelberg can trace its roots to this 12th-century monastery. The first reference to Heidelberg can be found in a document in Schönau Abbey dated to 1196. This is considered to be the town&#x27;s founding date. In 1156, Heidelberg castle and its neighboring settlement were taken over by the house of Hohenstaufen. Conrad of Hohenstaufen became Count Palatine of the Rhine (). In 1195, the Electorate of the Palatinate passed to the House of Welf through marriage. In 1214, Ludwig I, Duke of Bavaria acquired the Palatinate, as a consequence of which the castle came under his control. By 1303, another castle had been constructed for defense. In 1356, the Counts Palatine were granted far-reaching rights in the Golden Bull, in addition to becoming Electors. In 1386, Heidelberg University was founded by Rupert I, Elector Palatine.

===Modern history===
Heidelberg University played a leading part in Medieval Scholasticism, Renaissance humanism, the German Reformation, and in the subsequent conflict between Lutheranism and Calvinism during the 15th and 16th centuries. In April 1518, a few months after proclaiming his &quot;Ninety-five Theses&quot;, Martin Luther was received in Heidelberg, to defend them.

Heidelberg&#x27;s library, founded in 1421, is the oldest existing public library in Germany.

In 1537, the castle located higher up the mountain was destroyed by a gunpowder explosion. The duke&#x27;s palace was built at the site of the lower castle.
Elector Frederick III, sovereign of the Electoral Palatinate from 1559 to 1576, commissioned the composition of a new Catechism for his territory. While the catechism&#x27;s introduction credits the &quot;entire theological faculty here&quot; (at the University of Heidelberg) and &quot;all the superintendents and prominent servants of the church&quot; for the composition of the Catechism, Zacharius Ursinus is commonly regarded as the catechism&#x27;s principal author. Caspar Olevianus (1536–1587) was formerly asserted as a co-author of the document, though this theory has been largely discarded by modern scholarship. Johann Sylvan, Adam Neuser, Johannes Willing, Thomas Erastus, Michael Diller, Johannes Brunner, Tilemann Mumius, Petrus Macheropoeus, Johannes Eisenmenger, Immanuel Tremellius, and Pierre Boquin are all likely to have contributed to the Catechism in some way. Frederick himself wrote the preface to the Catechism and closely oversaw its composition and publication. Frederick, who was officially Lutheran but had strong Reformed leanings, wanted to even out the religious situation of his highly Lutheran territory within the primarily Catholic Holy Roman Empire. The Council of Trent had just concluded with its conclusions and decrees against the Protestant faiths, and the Peace of Augsburg had only granted toleration for Lutheranism within the empire where the ruler was Lutheran. One of the aims of the catechism was to counteract the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church as well as Anabaptists and &quot;strict&quot; Gnesio-Lutherans like Tilemann Heshusius and Matthias Flacius, who were resisting Frederick&#x27;s Reformed influences, particularly on the matter of Eucharist (the Lord&#x27;s Supper). The Catechism-based each of its statements on biblical proof-texts, and Frederick himself would defend it as biblical, not reformed, at the 1566 Diet of Augsburg when he was called to answer to charges of violating the Peace of Augsburg. This was the Heidelberg Catechism, officially called the ″Catechism, or Christian Instruction, according to the Usages of the Churches and Schools of the Electoral Palatinate.″

In November 1619, the Royal Crown of Bohemia was offered to the Elector, Frederick V. (He was married to Princess Elizabeth, eldest daughter of James VI and I of Scotland and England, respectively.) Frederick became known as the &quot;Winter King&quot;, as he reigned for only one winter before the Imperial House of Habsburg regained Bohemia by force. His overthrow in 1621 marked the beginning of the Thirty Years&#x27; War. In 1622, after a siege of two months, the armies of the Catholic League, commanded by Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly, captured the town. Tilly gave the famous &quot;Bibliotheca Palatina&quot; from the Church of the Holy Spirit to the Pope as a present. The Catholic and Bavarian House of Wittelsbach gained control over the Palatinate and the title of Prince-Elector.

In late 1634, after the Swedish army had conquered Heidelberg, imperial forces attempted to recapture the city. They quickly took the city, but were unable to take the castle. As they prepared to blow up its fortifications with gunpowder the French army arrived, 30,000 men strong, led by Urbain de Maillé-Brézé, who had fought in many battles and participated in the Siege of La Rochelle (1627–1628), and Jacques-Nompar de Caumont, duc de La Force. They broke the siege and drove off the Imperial forces.

In 1648, at the end of the war, Frederick V&#x27;s son Charles I Louis, Elector Palatine, was able to recover his titles and lands. To strengthen his dynasty, Charles I Louis arranged the marriage of his daughter Liselotte to Philip I, Duke of Orléans, brother of Louis XIV, King of France. In 1685, after the death of Charles Louis&#x27; son, Elector Charles II, King Louis XIV laid claim to his sister-in-law&#x27;s inheritance. The Germans rejected the claim, in part because of religious differences between local Protestants and the French Catholics, as the Protestant Reformation had divided the peoples of Europe. The War of the Grand Alliance ensued. In 1689, French troops took the town and castle, bringing nearly total destruction to the area in 1693. As a result of the destruction due to repeated French invasions related to the War of the Palatinate Succession coupled with severe winters, thousands of German Calvinist Palatines emigrated in the early 18th century. They fled to other European cities and especially to London (where the refugees were called &quot;the poor Palatines&quot;). In sympathy for the Protestants, in 1709–1710, Queen Anne&#x27;s government arranged transport for nearly 6,000 Palatines to New York. Others were transported to Pennsylvania, and to South Carolina. They worked their passage and later settled in the English colonies there.

In 1720, after assigning a major church for exclusively Catholic use, religious conflicts with the mostly Protestant inhabitants of Heidelberg caused the Roman Catholic Prince-Elector Charles III Philip to transfer his court to nearby Mannheim. The court remained there until the Elector Charles Theodore became Elector of Bavaria in 1777 and established his court in Munich. In 1742, Elector Charles Theodore began rebuilding the Palace. In 1764, a lightning bolt destroyed other palace buildings during reconstruction, causing the work to be discontinued.

===1803 to 1933===
Heidelberg fell to the Grand Duchy of Baden in 1803. Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Baden, re-founded the university, named &quot;Ruperto-Carola&quot; after its two founders. Notable scholars soon earned it a reputation as a &quot;royal residence of the intellect&quot;. In the 18th century, the town was rebuilt in the Baroque style on the old medieval layout.

In 1810 the French Revolution refugee Count Charles Graimberg began to preserve the palace ruins and establish a historical collection. In 1815, the Emperor of Austria, the Emperor of Russia and the King of Prussia formed the &quot;Holy Alliance&quot; in Heidelberg. In 1848, the German National Assembly was held there. In 1849, during the Palatinate-Baden rebellion of the 1848 Revolutions, Heidelberg was the headquarters of a revolutionary army. It was defeated by a Prussian army near Waghaeusel. The city was occupied by Prussian troops until 1850. Between 1920 and 1933, Heidelberg University became a center of notable physicians Czerny, Erb, and Krehl; and humanists Rohde, Weber, and Gandolf.

===Nazism and the World War II-period===
During the Nazi period (1933–1945), Heidelberg was a stronghold of the NSDAP/Nazi party (the National Socialist German Workers&#x27; Party), the strongest party in the elections before 1933 (the NSDAP obtained 30% at the communal elections of 1930). The NSDAP received 45.9% of the votes in the German federal election of March 1933 (the national average was 43.9%).
In 1934 and 1935 the and Heidelberg University students built the huge &quot;Thingstätte&quot; amphitheatre on the north of the town, for Nazi Party and SS events. A few months later, the inauguration of the huge Ehrenfriedhof memorial cemetery completed the second and last NSDAP project in Heidelberg. This cemetery is on the southern side of the old part of town, a little south of the Königstuhl hilltop, and faces west towards France. During World War II and after, Wehrmacht soldiers were buried there.

During the &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; on 9 November 1938, Nazis burned down synagogues at two locations in the city. The next day, they started the systematic deportation of Jews, sending 150 to Dachau concentration camp. On 22 October 1940, during the &quot;Wagner Buerckel event&quot;, the Nazis deported 6000 local Jews, including 281 from Heidelberg, to Camp Gurs concentration camp in France. Within a few months, as many as 1000 of them (201 from Heidelberg) died of hunger and disease. Among the deportees from Heidelberg, the poet Alfred Mombert (1872–1942) left the concentration camp in April 1941 thanks to the Swiss poet Hans Reinhart but died shortly thereafter due to illness he contracted while held prisoner. From 1942, the deportees who had survived internment in Gurs were deported to Eastern Europe, where most of them were murdered.

The U.S. 44th Infantry Division took part in combat in Western Europe throughout 1944 and early 1945, and the division&#x27;s artillery commander, Brigadier General William A. Beiderlinden, became the subject of international headlines in March 1945, when he helped save Heidelberg from bombing by persuading Nazi troops to withdraw. When his command was ordered to shell the city, Beiderlinden took the initiative to contact the burgomaster and attempt to persuade Nazi soldiers to abandon their positions. Though burgomasters were forbidden from conducting such talks, Heidelberg&#x27;s burgomaster ignored warnings from the local Nazi gauleiter and discussed the matter with Beiderlinden. The negotiations focused on the importance of sparing Heidelberg University and other historic and culturally significant sites. Beiderlinden and the burgomaster agreed to terms, and the Nazis spared the city by evacuating.

On 29 March 1945, German troops left the city after destroying three arches of the old bridge, Heidelberg&#x27;s treasured river crossing. They also destroyed the more modern bridge downstream. The U.S. Army (63rd Infantry, 7th Army) entered the town on 30 March 1945. The civilian population surrendered without resistance.

Heidelberg, unlike most German cities and towns, was spared from Allied bombing raids during the war. A popular belief is that Heidelberg escaped bombing because the U.S. Army wanted to use the city as a garrison after the war, but, as Heidelberg was neither an industrial center nor a transport hub, it did not present a tactical or strategic target. Other notable university towns, such as Tübingen and Göttingen, were spared bombing as well. Allied air raids focused extensively on the nearby industrial cities of Mannheim and Ludwigshafen.

The U.S. Army may have chosen Heidelberg as a garrison base because of its excellent infrastructure, including the Heidelberg–Mannheim Autobahn (motorway), which connected to the Mannheim–Darmstadt–Frankfurt Autobahn, and the U.S. Army installations in Mannheim and Frankfurt. The intact rail infrastructure was more important in the late 1940s and early 1950s when most heavy loads were still carried by train, not by truck. Heidelberg had the untouched Wehrmacht barracks, the &quot;Grossdeutschland Kaserne&quot; which the US Army occupied soon after, renaming it the Campbell Barracks.

===History after 1945===
In 1945, the university was reopened relatively quickly on the initiative of a small group of professors, among whom were the anti-Nazi economist Alfred Weber and the philosopher Karl Jaspers. The surgeon Karl Heinrich Bauer was nominated rector.

On 9 December 1945, US Army General George S. Patton was involved in a car accident in the adjacent city of Mannheim and died in the Heidelberg US Army hospital on 21 December 1945. His funeral ceremony was held at the Heidelberg-Weststadt , and he was buried in the 3rd Army cemetery in Luxembourg.

During the post-war military occupation, the U.S. Army used the for cultural and religious events. Civilian use started in the early to mid-1980s for occasional concerts and other cultural events. Today, the celebrations on , also called Walpurgis Night, the night of 30 April, are a regular &quot;underground&quot; fixture at the . Thousands of mostly young people congregate there to drum, to breathe fire, and to juggle. The event has gained fame throughout the region, as well as a certain notoriety due to the amount of litter left behind. Officially, this event is forbidden due to security concerns. The City declares it will fence the Thingstätte and prosecute any trespassers.

In 2022, a mass shooting occurred in the university, killing a woman and injuring three other people. The gunman then committed suicide.

==Population==

The population of the city of Heidelberg exceeded 100,000 for the first time in 1946. It is a city with an international population, including one of the largest American communities outside North America, but this is not analysed in the Heidelberg population statistics. At the end of December 2011, the city had 149,633 inhabitants with an official primary residence in Heidelberg (not including the soldiers and employees of the U.S. Army and their dependents, a total of about 20,000 people), a historic high.

The following table shows the number of inhabitants within the boundaries of the city at the time. To 1833 they are mostly estimates, then census results or official updates of the statistical offices of the time or the city administration. The data refer from 1843 to the &quot;local population&quot;, from 1925 to the resident population and since 1987 the &quot;population at the site of their main dwelling.&quot; Prior to 1843 the population was determined by non-uniform collection procedures.

Heidelberg has currently a population of about 160,000 and is the 5th largest city in Baden-Württemberg. About 37,000 (24% of the population) are students, which makes Heidelberg one of the largest university city in Germany. Heidelberg&#x27;s population has grown since 1945 (after the WWII) and has almost never declined due to its popularity of this city where many workers, students and entrepreneurs moved to Heidelberg.


With a fertility rate of 1.1 children per woman in the , Heidelberg had the lowest fertility rate in Baden-Württemberg in 2008.

==Politics==
Since 2006, the of Heidelberg has been the independent Eckart Würzner. From 1990 to 2006, the mayor was Beate Weber (SPD).

The council consists of 48 members with the mayor as chairman. The council is directly elected for a term of five years. The task of the council is to decide all the affairs of the city, with the mayor presiding. The council controls the city administration and oversees the enforcement of its decisions.

Heidelberg has always been a stronghold of The Greens. For the municipal elections in 2009, they split into the Green Alternative List and Alliance 90/The Greens and each ran their own lists. Together they gained 10 seats to become the strongest force for the first time. In September 2011, two members of the GAL Group joined the Alliance 90/The Greens, so that together with the members of , they formed the largest group in the council.

For elections to the Bundestag, the city is part of the Heidelberg constituency.

==Cityscape==
===The old town===


The &quot;old town&quot; (), on the south bank of the Neckar, is long and narrow. It is dominated by the ruins of Heidelberg Castle, 80 metres above the Neckar on the steep wooded slopes of the hill.
* The Main Street (), a mile-long pedestrian street, running the length of the old town.
* The old stone bridge was erected 1786–1788. A medieval bridge gate is on the side of the old town, and was originally part of the town wall. Baroque tower helmets were added as part of the erection of the stone bridge in 1788.
* The Church of the Holy Spirit (), a late Gothic church in the marketplace of the old town.
* The Karls&#x27; gate () is a triumphal arch in honour of the Prince Elector Karl Theodor, located at Heidelberg&#x27;s east side. It was built 1775–1781 and designed by Nicolas de Pigage.
* The house is one of the few buildings to survive the War of Succession. Standing across from the Church of the Holy Spirit, it was built in the style of the late Renaissance. It is named after the sculpture at the top.
* The , a 16th-century building on the Neckar that has served several purposes through its history. It is now a cafeteria for the university.

===Heidelberg Castle===


The castle is a mix of styles from Gothic to Renaissance. Prince Elector Ruprecht III (1398–1410) erected the first building in the inner courtyard as a royal residence. The building was divided into a ground floor made of stone and framework upper levels. Another royal building is located opposite the Ruprecht Building: the Fountain Hall. Prince Elector Philipp (1476–1508) is said to have arranged the transfer of the hall&#x27;s columns from a decayed palace of Charlemagne from Ingelheim to Heidelberg.

In the 16th and 17th centuries, the Prince Electors added two palace buildings and turned the fortress into a castle. The two dominant buildings at the eastern and northern side of the courtyard were erected during the rule of Ottheinrich (1556–1559) and Friedrich IV (1583–1610). Under Friedrich V (1613–1619), the main building of the west side was erected, the so-called &quot;English Building&quot;.

The castle and its garden were destroyed several times during the Thirty Years&#x27; War and the Palatine War of Succession. As Prince Elector Karl Theodor tried to restore the castle, lightning struck in 1764, and ended all attempts at rebuilding. Later on, the castle was misused as a quarry; stones from the castle were taken to build new houses in Heidelberg. This was stopped in 1800 by Count Charles de Graimberg, who then began the process of preserving the castle.

Although the interior is in Gothic style, the King&#x27;s Hall was not built until 1934. Today, the hall is used for festivities, e.g. dinner banquets, balls and theatre performances. During the Heidelberg Castle Festival in the summer, the courtyard is the site of open air musicals, operas, theatre performances, and classical concerts performed by the Heidelberg Philharmonics.

The castle is surrounded by a park, where the famous poet Johann von Goethe once walked. The Heidelberger Bergbahn funicular railway runs from Kornmakt to the summit of the Königstuhl via the castle.

The castle looks over the entire city of Heidelberg and the Neckar Valley.

===Philosophers&#x27; Walk===
On the northern side of the Neckar is located the Heiligenberg (&quot;Saints&#x27; Mountain&quot;), along the side of which runs the Philosophers&#x27; Walk (), with scenic views of the old town and castle. Traditionally, Heidelberg&#x27;s philosophers and university professors would walk and talk along the pathway. Farther up the mountain lie the ruined 11th-century Monastery of St. Michael, the smaller Monastery of St. Stephen, a Nazi-era amphitheater, the so-called Pagan&#x27;s hole and the remains of an earthen Celtic hill fort from the 4th century BC.

===Heidelberg churches===

There are many historical churches in Heidelberg and its surroundings. The Church of the Holy Spirit has been shared over the centuries since the Protestant Reformation by both Catholics and Protestants. It is one of the few buildings to survive the many wars during the past centuries. It was rebuilt after the French set fire to it in 1709 during the War of the Palatinian Succession. The church has remains of the tombs and epitaphs of the past Palatinate electors. This Church stands in the next to the seat of local government. In 1720, Karl III Philip, Elector Palatine came into conflict with the town&#x27;s Protestants as a result of giving the Church of the Holy Spirit exclusively to the Catholics for their use. It had previously been split by a partition and used by both congregations. Due to pressure by the mostly Protestant powers of Prussia, Holland, and Sweden, Prince Karl III Philip gave way and repartitioned the church for joint use. In 1936 the separating wall was removed. The church is now exclusively used by Protestants. Furthermore, there is the Catholic Church of the Jesuits. Its construction began in 1712. It was completed with the addition of a bell tower from 1866 to 1872. The church is also home to the Museum für sakrale Kunst und Liturgie (Museum of Ecclesiastical Arts). The oldest church in Heidelberg is the St. Peter&#x27;s Church (now Lutheran). It was built some time during the 12th century.

==Education==

===Universities and academia===

Heidelberg is known for its institutions of higher education. The most famous of those is Heidelberg University. Founded in 1386, it is one of Europe&#x27;s oldest institutions. In fact, Heidelberg is the oldest university town of today&#x27;s Germany. Among the prominent thinkers associated with the institution are Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Karl Jaspers, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Jürgen Habermas, Karl-Otto Apel, and Hannah Arendt. The campus is situated in two urban areas and several buildings. In numerous historical buildings in the old town there are the Faculties of the Humanities, the Social Science, and the Faculty of Law. The school of applied sciences is located in the &quot;Science Tower&quot; in Wieblingen. The Faculties of Medicine and Natural Science are settled on the Neuenheimer Feld Campus.

The campus of Heidelberg University has a total undergraduate enrollment of 30,898 as of 2014. The enrollment rate of this university is 16.3 percent. Less than 20 percent of the total student body is international. This university has many areas of study for national students such as; theology, law, philosophy, modern languages, economics, and social sciences. The university does not charge students for tuition. The school&#x27;s academic calendar is semester based, and the majority of the language for instruction is in German. For international students the academic calendar is based on a block schedule. The international students attend in block periods of 5 weeks. The University or &quot;Uni&quot; is spread across three campuses each containing different fields of study.

Since 1904 there has been a College of Educational Science, the ; since 1979 there has been a college of Jewish Studies, the . It comprises nine branches specializing in both religion and Jewish culture. The Schiller International University, a private American university is also represented with a campus in Heidelberg offering several undergraduate and graduate programs in the fields of International Business and International Relations and Diplomacy.

===Research===
In addition to the research centers and institutes of the university, there are numerous research institutions situated in the city of Heidelberg. Among them are the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO), the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Max Planck Institute for Medical Research, Max Planck Institute for Astronomy, Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics, Max Planck Institute for Comparative Public Law and International Law.

===Schools===
Heidelberg is home to 23 elementary schools. There are several institutions of secondary education, both public and private, representing all levels of the German school system. There are 14 Gymnasiums, with six of them private. With 52% of secondary students attending a Gymnasium, Heidelberg sits above the German average, perhaps because a large number of academics live in Heidelberg and its environs.

The gymnasiums include the , , Helmholtz-Gymnasium, Hölderlin-Gymnasium and Elisabeth-von-Thadden-Schule. Then there are seven Realschule, ten Hauptschule, and nine vocational schools (the so-called ). In addition, there are several folk high schools with different specialisations. Heidelberg International School serves the local expatriate community.

==Economy==
===Tourism===
In 2004, 81.8% of people worked for service industries, including tourism. As a relic of the period of Romanticism, Heidelberg has been labeled a &quot;Romantic town&quot;. This is used to attract more than 11.9 million visitors every year. Many events are organized to attract visitors. One of the biggest tourist attractions is the Christmas market during the winter time.

===Industry===
Only 18% of employment is provided by industry. Printing and publishing are important enterprises; nearby Walldorf is a center of the IT industry and SAP World Headquarters. Noted pen manufacturer Lamy has its headquarters and factory in Heidelberg-Wieblingen. Heidelberger Druckmaschinen has its headquarters here; its factory is located in Walldorf. Soft-drink company Wild-Werke, manufacturer of the Capri-Sonne (Capri-Sun in the U.S.) is located nearby in Eppelheim. Heidelberg is also home to the headquarters of HeidelbergCement, the world&#x27;s second largest cement producer. The company has its roots in the suburb of Leimen where one of its cement plants is still located. With its long Hauptstraße, Heidelberg is a shopping destination for people from the surrounding smaller towns.
===Roads===
The A 5 autobahn runs through the western outskirts of Heidelberg, connecting the region to Frankfurt am Main in the north and Karlsruhe to the south. The A 656 commences just west of the city, connecting Heidelberg with Mannheim. Both highways meet at Heidelberg autobahn intersection in the city of Heidelberg, and the A 656 connects to the A 6 at the Mannheim autobahn intersection, which connects to the east towards Stuttgart.

Furthermore, the B 3 (Frankfurt–Karlsruhe) runs north–south through the town, and the B 37 (Mannheim–Eberbach) runs east–west. Both meet in the city center at the Bismarckplatz. The B 535 begin in the south of Heidelberg and runs to Schwetzingen.

====Tourist roads====
Heidelberg is located on four tourist roads: Bergstraße, Bertha Benz Memorial Route, Castle Road, and Straße der Demokratie (Road of Democracy).

===Railways===
Heidelberg Central Station (Hauptbahnhof) is on the Rhine Valley Railway and is served by Intercity-Express, Euro City trains. This station is served by the RheinNeckar S-Bahn. There is also a station for intercity bus services outside the central station.

===Public transport===
The main transport hub of Heidelberg is the Bismarckplatz. Several main thoroughfares of the city intersect here and one of the longest pedestrian streets in Europe, the Hauptstraße (main street) runs from here through the entire old town of Heidelberg. Heidelberg Central Station was nearby for many years, which was a combined terminal and through station. In 1955, it was moved about 1.5 km further to the west, which removed the necessity for trains continuing north or south to reverse. The new central station became the second major transport hub of Heidelberg.

Heidelberg has had a public transport service since 1883, when horse-drawn trams were established. Due to the rapidly rising patronage it was decided on 20 December 1901 to convert the Heidelberg tramway network to electrical operation. On 16 March 1902, the first electric tram ran on Rohrbacher Straße, sharing use of the suburban tracks built by the in 1901 between Heidelberg and Wiesloch. Until the 1950s, the tram network was expanded a bit at a time. The rapidly growing popularity of car transport presented the operator of the trams with increasingly difficult problems and the tram network was gradually dismantled. It was not until 10 December 2006 that the network was extended again with the opening of a new tram line from Kirchheim. Tram and bus services are now operated by Rhein-Neckar-Verkehr (RNV). Since 1989, all fares are set under a uniform scheme by the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Neckar (Rhine-Neckar Transport Association, VRN). Carsharing increasingly provides a complement to public transport. More than 50 car-sharing stations are available to users in 12 of the 14 districts of Heidelberg offering a total of more than 100 cars.
Since 14 December 2003, Heidelberg has been connected to the network of the Rhine-Neckar S-Bahn, which opens up the entire Rhine-Neckar region, with lines connecting with the Palatinate, the Saarland, and southern Hesse.

The Heidelberger Bergbahn (Heidelberg Mountain Railway) has run since 2005 with new cars on the lower part from Kornmarkt to Molkenkur and historic cars built in 1907 on the upper section of the funicular from Molkenkur to Königstuhl. It is one of the most popular means to reach Heidelberg Castle. The first plans for the funicular were drawn up in 1873. Due to a lack of funds, the first section of the funicular was not opened until 1890. In 2004, the upper section of the funicular was listed as part of the heritage of the state of Baden-Württemberg.

===United States military installations===
During World War II, Heidelberg was one of the few major cities in Germany not significantly damaged by Allied bombing. Situated in the American Zone of Germany, Heidelberg became the headquarters of the American forces in Europe. The main military facilities were Campbell Barracks, the former Wehrmacht Grossdeutschland-Kaserne, which housed the US Army, Europe (USAREUR) and NATO&#x27;s Component Command-Land Headquarters. (Until 2004, this was designated Joint Headquarters Centre, and before that, LANDCENT).

Campbell Barracks and Mark Twain Village were both in Südstadt; Patton Barracks was in nearby Kirchheim. Nachrichten Kaserne in Rohrbach was home to the former Heidelberg Army Hospital, later designated the Heidelberg Health Center. Patrick Henry Village, the largest U.S. military housing area in the Heidelberg area, was west of Kirchheim. These installations, including Tompkins Barracks and Kilbourne Kaserne in nearby Schwetzingen, plus the Germersheim Depot, made up the U.S. Army Garrison Heidelberg. Tompkins Barracks was home to U.S. Army Installation Management Command Europe Region . The Heidelberg U.S. Army Air Field (Heidelberg AAF) was converted to an heliport (mostly Blackhawk Helicopters) after the NATO Kosovo campaign.

The children of United States Department of Defense employees based in Heidelberg attended on-base schools operated by the DODDS-E (Department of Defense Dependents Schools – Europe). There were three schools of this kind: Heidelberg High School in Mark Twain Village (Mark Twain Elementary School closed at the completion of the 2010–2011 school year), and Heidelberg Middle School and Patrick Henry Elementary in Patrick Henry Village.

On 19 October 2009, the U.S. Army announced that it would be building new headquarters for USAREUR in Wiesbaden. The move from Heidelberg took place in 2012 and 2013, and was completed in 2014. By 2015 all United States forces had left Heidelberg. The barracks and the housing areas were returned to the German state for conversion to civilian use.

==Culture==

===Events===
Several festivals and events hosted and organized in Heidelberg throughout the year. In February, the is arranged and Fasching, the equivalent of Mardi Gras or Carnival in some German regions, with a giant vampire-themed costume party at the local castle or city hall is celebrated.

The festival presents arthouse films of international newcomer directors and is held jointly by both of the cities. During Christmas there is a Christmas market throughout the oldest part of the city. A famous gift is the chocolate called Heidelberger .

===Cinemas===

The nationwide trend of cinema closures hit Heidelberg harder than many other places in Germany.

Recent years saw the low-point of this development, when in this city of over 150,000 people there were just three small cinemas left, with a total capacity of under 450 seats. The situation has slightly improved since late 2017, when Heidelberg got a new multiplex adjacent to the new Bahnstadt development, the &quot;Luxor Filmpalast&quot;.

Luxor shows mainly Blockbuster movies in German, but some showings in English are on offer for selected films.

The small 2-screen cinema &quot;Gloria/Gloriette&quot; (Old Town), together with the affiliated &quot;Kamera&quot; (Neuenheim) offers arthouse and independent films, with some showings being offered in the films original language, usually with German subtitles.

The non-profit &quot;Karlstorkino&quot; (at the far eastern edge of the Old Town, next to the river) offers international arthouse fare and the occasional documentary. The vast majority of non-German films at this cinema are shown in their original language with either English or German subtitles, depending on the film.

===Museums and exhibitions===
Among the most prominent museums of Heidelberg are for instance the Carl Bosch Museum which shows life and work of chemist and Nobel Prize-winner Carl Bosch. Then there is the Documentation and Culture Centre of German Sinti and Roma (Dokumentations- und Kulturzentrum Deutscher Sini und Roma) describing the Nazi genocide of the Sinti and Roma peoples. The German Packing Museum (Deutsches Verpackungsmuseum) gives an overview of the history of packing and wrapping goods, whereas the German Pharmacy Museum (Deutsches Apothekenmuseum) which is located in the castle illustrates the history of Pharmacy in Germany. The offers a great art collection and some Roman archeological artifacts from the region. In honour of Friedrich Ebert the President Friedrich Ebert Memorial, which commemorates the life of Germany&#x27;s first democratic head of state, was established. Besides, there are guided tours in most of the historical monuments of Heidelberg, as well as organized tourist tours through the city available in several languages.

===Heidelberg Romanticism===

Heidelberg was the centre of the epoch of (Romanticism) in Germany. The phase after Jena Romanticism is often called Heidelberg Romanticism (see also Berlin Romanticism). There was a famous circle of poets (the Heidelberg Romantics), such as Joseph von Eichendorff, Johann Joseph von Görres, Ludwig Achim von Arnim, and Clemens Brentano. A relic of Romanticism is the Philosophers&#x27; Walk (), a scenic walking path on the nearby Heiligenberg, overlooking Heidelberg.

The epoch of German philosophy and literature, was described as a movement against classical and realistic theories of literature, a contrast to the rationality of the Age of Enlightenment. It elevated medievalism and elements of art and narrative perceived to be from the medieval period. It also emphasized folk art, nature, and an epistemology based on nature, which included human activity conditioned by nature in the form of language, custom and usage.

===Old Heidelberg===

In 1901 Wilhelm Meyer-Förster wrote the play &quot;Old Heidelberg&quot; which was followed by a large number of film adaptations. It was the basis for Sigmund Romberg&#x27;s 1924 operetta &quot;The Student Prince&quot; which was itself turned into a film of the same title.

===I Lost My Heart in Heidelberg===

The 1925 song &quot;I Lost My Heart in Heidelberg&quot; composed by Fred Raymond was a major hit and inspired a stage musical and two films. It remains the theme song of Heidelberg.

<text>Elizabeth Angela Marguerite Bowes-Lyon (4 August 1900 – 30 March 2002) was Queen of the United Kingdom and the Dominions of the British Commonwealth from 11 December 1936 to 6 February 1952 as the wife of King George VI. She was also the last Empress of India from 1936 until the British Raj was dissolved on 15 August 1947. After her husband died, she was officially known as Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, to avoid confusion with her daughter Queen Elizabeth II.

Born into a family of British nobility, Elizabeth came to prominence in 1923 when she married Prince Albert, Duke of York, the second son of King George V and Queen Mary. The couple and their daughters, Elizabeth and Margaret, embodied traditional ideas of family and public service. The Duchess undertook a variety of public engagements and became known for her consistently cheerful countenance.

In 1936, Elizabeth&#x27;s husband unexpectedly ascended the throne as George VI when his older brother, Edward VIII, abdicated in order to marry American divorcée Wallis Simpson. Elizabeth then became queen consort. She accompanied her husband on diplomatic tours to France and North America before the start of the Second World War. During the war, her seemingly indomitable spirit provided moral support to the British public. After the war, her husband&#x27;s health deteriorated, and she was widowed at the age of 51. Her elder daughter, aged 25, became the new monarch.

After the death of Queen Mary in 1953, Elizabeth was viewed as the matriarch of the British royal family. In her later years, she was a consistently popular member of the family, even at times when other royals were suffering from low levels of public approval. She continued an active public life until just a few months before her death at the age of 101, seven weeks after the death of her younger daughter, Princess Margaret.

==Early life==

Elizabeth Angela Marguerite Bowes-Lyon was the youngest daughter and the ninth of ten children of Claude Bowes-Lyon, Lord Glamis (later the 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne in the Peerage of Scotland), and his wife, Cecilia Cavendish-Bentinck. Her mother was descended from British prime minister William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland, and Governor-General of India Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley, who was the elder brother of another prime minister, Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington.

The location of Elizabeth&#x27;s birth remains uncertain, but reputedly she was born either in her parents&#x27; Westminster home at Belgrave Mansions, Grosvenor Gardens, or in a horse-drawn ambulance on the way to a hospital. Other possible locations include Forbes House in Ham, London, the home of her maternal grandmother, Louisa Scott. Her birth was registered at Hitchin, Hertfordshire, near the Strathmores&#x27; English country house, St Paul&#x27;s Walden Bury, which was also given as her birthplace in the 1901 and 1911 censuses. She was christened there on 23 September 1900, in the local parish church, All Saints.

Elizabeth spent much of her childhood at St Paul&#x27;s Walden and at Glamis Castle, the Earl&#x27;s ancestral home in Scotland. She was educated at home by a governess until the age of eight, and was fond of field sports, ponies and dogs. When she started school in London, she astonished her teachers by precociously beginning an essay with two Greek words from Xenophon&#x27;s &quot;Anabasis&quot;. Her best subjects were literature and scripture. After returning to private education under a German Jewish governess, Käthe Kübler, she passed the Oxford Local Examination with distinction at age thirteen.
On Elizabeth&#x27;s fourteenth birthday, Britain declared war on Germany. Four of her brothers served in the army. Her elder brother Fergus, an officer in the Black Watch Regiment, was killed in action at the Battle of Loos in 1915. Another brother, Michael, was reported missing in action on 28 April 1917. Three weeks later, the family discovered he had been captured after being wounded. He remained in a prisoner of war camp for the rest of the war. Glamis was turned into a convalescent home for wounded soldiers, which Elizabeth helped to run. She was particularly instrumental in organising the rescue of the castle&#x27;s contents during a serious fire on 16 September 1916. One of the soldiers she treated wrote in her autograph book that she was to be &quot;Hung, drawn, &amp; quartered ... Hung in diamonds, drawn in a coach and four, and quartered in the best house in the land.&quot; On 5 November 1916, she was confirmed at St John&#x27;s Scottish Episcopal Church in Forfar.

==Marriage==
Prince Albert, Duke of York—&quot;Bertie&quot; to the family—was the second son of King George V and Queen Mary. He initially proposed to Elizabeth in 1921, but she turned him down, being &quot;afraid never, never again to be free to think, speak and act as I feel I really ought to&quot;. When he declared he would marry no other, Queen Mary visited Glamis to see for herself the girl who had stolen her son&#x27;s heart. She became convinced that Elizabeth was &quot;the one girl who could make Bertie happy&quot;, but refused to interfere. At the same time, Elizabeth was courted by James Stuart, Albert&#x27;s equerry, until he left the prince&#x27;s service for a better-paid job in the American oil business.

In February 1922, Elizabeth was a bridesmaid at the wedding of Albert&#x27;s sister, Princess Mary, to Viscount Lascelles. The following month, Albert proposed again, but she refused him once more. Eventually in January 1923, Elizabeth agreed to marry Albert, despite her misgivings about royal life. Albert&#x27;s freedom in choosing Elizabeth, not a member of a royal family, though the daughter of a peer, was considered a gesture in favour of political modernisation; previously, princes were expected to marry princesses from other royal families. They selected a platinum engagement ring featuring a Kashmir sapphire with two diamonds adorning its sides.

The couple married on 26 April 1923, at Westminster Abbey. Unexpectedly, Elizabeth laid her bouquet at the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior on her way into the abbey, in memory of her brother Fergus. Elizabeth became styled &quot;Her Royal Highness The Duchess of York&quot;. Following a wedding breakfast at Buckingham Palace prepared by chef Gabriel Tschumi, Elizabeth and Albert honeymooned at Polesden Lacey, a manor house in Surrey owned by the wealthy socialite and friend Margaret Greville. They then went to Scotland, where she caught &quot;unromantic&quot; whooping cough.

==Duchess of York==

After a successful royal visit to Northern Ireland in July 1924, the Labour government agreed that Albert and Elizabeth could tour East Africa from December 1924 to April 1925. The Labour government was defeated by the Conservatives in a general election in November (which Elizabeth described as &quot;marvellous&quot; to her mother) and the Governor-General of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, Sir Lee Stack, was assassinated three weeks later. Despite this, the tour went ahead, and they visited Aden, Kenya, Uganda, and Sudan, but Egypt was avoided because of political tensions.
Albert had a stammer, which affected his ability to deliver speeches, and after October 1925, Elizabeth assisted in helping him through the therapy devised by Lionel Logue, an episode portrayed in the 2010 film &quot;The King&#x27;s Speech&quot;. In 1926, the couple had their first child, Princess Elizabeth—&quot;Lilibet&quot; to the family—who would later become Queen Elizabeth II. Albert and Elizabeth, without their child, travelled to Australia to open Parliament House in Canberra in 1927. She was, in her own words, &quot;very miserable at leaving the baby&quot;. Their journey by sea took them via Jamaica, the Panama Canal and the Pacific; Elizabeth fretted constantly over her baby back in Britain, but their journey was a public relations success. She charmed the public in Fiji when, as she was shaking hands with a long line of official guests, a stray dog walked in on the ceremony and she shook its paw as well. In New Zealand she fell ill with a cold and missed some engagements, but enjoyed the local fishing in the Bay of Islands accompanied by Australian sports fisherman Harry Andreas. On the return journey, via Mauritius, the Suez Canal, Malta and Gibraltar, their transport, , caught fire and they prepared to abandon ship before the fire was brought under control.

The couple&#x27;s second daughter, Princess Margaret, was born at Glamis Castle in 1930. The couple initially lived at White Lodge, Richmond Park, before moving to 145 Piccadilly.

==Queen consort==

On 20 January 1936, George V died and his eldest son, Edward, Prince of Wales, became King Edward VIII. Elizabeth&#x27;s husband, Albert, became heir presumptive. Just months into Edward&#x27;s reign, the King&#x27;s decision to marry the American divorcée Wallis Simpson caused a constitutional crisis that resulted in his abdication. Albert reluctantly became king of the United Kingdom and emperor of India on 11 December 1936 under the regnal name of George VI. Elizabeth became queen and empress. Their coronation took place in Westminster Abbey on 12 May 1937, the date previously scheduled for Edward VIII&#x27;s coronation. Elizabeth&#x27;s crown was made of platinum and was set with the Koh-i-Noor diamond.

Edward married Wallis Simpson, and they became the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, but while Edward was a Royal Highness, George VI withheld the style from Wallis, a decision that Elizabeth supported. Elizabeth was later quoted as referring to Wallis as &quot;that woman&quot;, and Wallis referred to Elizabeth as &quot;Cookie&quot;, because of her supposed resemblance to a fat Scots cook. Claims that Elizabeth remained embittered towards Wallis were denied by her close friends; the Duke of Grafton wrote that she &quot;never said anything nasty about the Duchess of Windsor, except to say she really hadn&#x27;t got a clue what she was dealing with&quot;.

===Overseas visits===
In summer 1938, a state visit to France by the King and Queen was postponed for three weeks because of the death of Elizabeth&#x27;s mother. In two weeks, Norman Hartnell created an all-white trousseau for Elizabeth, who could not wear colours as she was still in mourning. The visit was designed to bolster Anglo-French solidarity in the face of aggression from Nazi Germany. The French press praised the demeanour and charm of the royal couple during the delayed but successful visit, augmented by Hartnell&#x27;s wardrobe.

Nevertheless, Nazi aggression continued, and the government prepared for war. After the Munich Agreement of 1938 appeared to forestall the advent of armed conflict, the British prime minister Neville Chamberlain was invited onto the balcony of Buckingham Palace with the King and Queen to receive acclamation from a crowd of well-wishers. While broadly popular among the general public, Chamberlain&#x27;s policy towards Hitler was the subject of some opposition in the House of Commons, which led historian John Grigg to describe George VI&#x27;s behaviour in associating himself so prominently with a politician as &quot;the most unconstitutional act by a British sovereign in the present century&quot;. However, historians argue that the King only ever followed ministerial advice and acted as he was constitutionally bound to do.
In May and June 1939, Elizabeth and her husband toured Canada from coast to coast and back, the first time a reigning monarch had toured Canada. They also visited the United States, spending time with President Franklin D. Roosevelt at the White House and his Hudson Valley estate. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt said that Elizabeth was &quot;perfect as a Queen, gracious, informed, saying the right thing &amp; kind but a little self-consciously regal&quot;. The tour was designed to bolster trans-Atlantic support in the event of war, and to affirm Canada&#x27;s status as an independent kingdom sharing with Britain the same person as monarch.

According to an often-told story, during one of the earliest of the royal couple&#x27;s repeated encounters with the crowds, a Boer War veteran asked Elizabeth, &quot;Are you Scots or are you English?&quot; She replied, &quot;I am a Canadian!&quot; Their reception by the Canadian and U.S. public was extremely enthusiastic, and largely dissipated any residual feeling that they were a lesser substitute for Edward VIII. Elizabeth told Canadian prime minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, &quot;that tour made us&quot;, and she returned to Canada frequently both on official tours and privately.

===Second World War===

During the Second World War, the royal couple became symbols of the fight against fascism. Shortly after the declaration of war, &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Book of the Red Cross&quot; was conceived. Fifty authors and artists contributed to the book, which was fronted by Cecil Beaton&#x27;s portrait of Elizabeth and was sold in aid of the Red Cross. She also broadcast to the nation in an attempt to comfort families during the evacuation of children and the mobilisation of fighting-age men. Elizabeth publicly refused to leave London or send the children to Canada, even during the Blitz, when the British Cabinet advised her to do so. She declared, &quot;The children won&#x27;t go without me. I won&#x27;t leave the King. And the King will never leave.&quot;

Elizabeth visited troops, hospitals, factories, and parts of Britain that were targeted by the German Luftwaffe, in particular the East End near London&#x27;s docks. Her visits initially provoked hostility; rubbish was thrown at her and the crowds jeered, in part because she wore expensive clothes that served to alienate her from people suffering the deprivations of war. She explained that if the public came to see her they would wear their best clothes, so she should reciprocate in kind; Norman Hartnell dressed her in gentle colours and avoided black to represent &quot;the rainbow of hope&quot;. When Buckingham Palace itself took several hits during the height of the bombing, Elizabeth said, &quot;I&#x27;m glad we&#x27;ve been bombed. It makes me feel I can look the East End in the face.&quot;
Though the King and Queen spent the working day at Buckingham Palace, partly for security and family reasons they stayed at night at Windsor Castle about west of central London with their daughters. The palace had lost much of its staff to the army, and most of the rooms were shut. The windows were shattered by bomb blasts, and had to be boarded up. During the &quot;Phoney War&quot; the Queen was given revolver training because of fears of imminent invasion.

French prime minister Édouard Daladier characterised Elizabeth as &quot;an excessively ambitious young woman who would be ready to sacrifice every other country in the world so that she may remain Queen.&quot; Adolf Hitler is said to have called her &quot;the most dangerous woman in Europe&quot; because he viewed her popularity as a threat to German interests. However, before the war both she and her husband, like most of Parliament and the British public, had supported appeasement and Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, believing after the experience of the First World War that war had to be avoided at all costs. After the resignation of Chamberlain, the King asked Winston Churchill to form a government. Although the King was initially suspicious of Churchill&#x27;s character and motives, in due course the royal couple came to respect and admire him.

===Post-war years===

In the 1945 British general election, Churchill&#x27;s Conservative Party was soundly defeated by the Labour Party of Clement Attlee. Elizabeth&#x27;s political views were rarely disclosed, but a letter she wrote in 1947 described Attlee&#x27;s &quot;high hopes of a socialist heaven on earth&quot; as fading and presumably describes those who voted for him as &quot;poor people, so many half-educated and bemused. I do love them.&quot; Woodrow Wyatt thought her &quot;much more pro-Conservative&quot; than other members of the royal family, but she later told him, &quot;I like the dear old Labour Party.&quot; She also told the Duchess of Grafton, &quot;I love communists.&quot;

During the 1947 royal tour of South Africa, Elizabeth&#x27;s serene public behaviour was broken, exceptionally, when she rose from the royal car to strike an admirer with her umbrella because she had mistaken his enthusiasm for hostility. The 1948 royal tour of Australia and New Zealand was postponed because of the King&#x27;s declining health. In March 1949, he had a successful operation to improve the circulation in his right leg. In summer 1951, Elizabeth and her daughters fulfilled the King&#x27;s public engagements in his place. In September, he was diagnosed with lung cancer. After a lung resection, he appeared to recover, but the delayed trip to Australia and New Zealand was altered so that Princess Elizabeth and her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, went in the King and Queen&#x27;s place in January 1952. George VI died in his sleep on 6 February 1952 while Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh were in Kenya on a Commonwealth tour, and with George&#x27;s death his daughter immediately became Queen Elizabeth II.

==Queen mother==
===Widowhood===

Shortly after George VI&#x27;s death, Elizabeth began to be styled as &quot;Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother&quot; because the normal style for the widow of a king, &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;, would have been too similar to the style of her elder daughter, Queen Elizabeth II. Popularly, she became the &quot;Queen Mother&quot; or the &quot;Queen Mum&quot;. She was devastated by her husband&#x27;s death and retired to Scotland. However, after a meeting with Prime Minister Winston Churchill, she broke her retirement and resumed her public duties. Eventually, she became just as busy as queen mother as she had been as queen consort. In July 1953, she undertook her first overseas visit since the funeral when she visited the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland with Princess Margaret. She laid the foundation stone of the University College of Rhodesia and Nyasaland—the current University of Zimbabwe. Upon her return to the region in 1957, Elizabeth was inaugurated as the college&#x27;s president, and attended other events that were deliberately designed to be multi-racial. During her daughter&#x27;s extensive tour of the Commonwealth over 1953–54, Elizabeth acted as a counsellor of state and looked after her grandchildren, Charles and Anne. In February 1959, she visited Kenya and Uganda.
Elizabeth oversaw the restoration of the remote Castle of Mey, on the north coast of Scotland, which she used to &quot;get away from everything&quot; for three weeks in August and ten days in October each year. She developed her interest in horse racing, particularly steeplechasing, which had been inspired by the amateur jockey Lord Mildmay of Flete in 1949. She owned the winners of approximately 500 races. Although (contrary to rumour) she never placed bets, she did have the racing commentaries piped direct to her London residence, Clarence House, so she could follow the races. As an art collector, she purchased works by Claude Monet, Augustus John and Peter Carl Fabergé, among others.

In February 1964, Elizabeth had an emergency appendectomy, which led to the postponement of a planned tour of Australia, New Zealand, and Fiji until 1966. She recuperated during a Caribbean cruise aboard the royal yacht, &quot;Britannia&quot;. In December 1966, she underwent an operation to remove a tumour, after she was diagnosed with colon cancer. Contrary to rumours which subsequently spread, she did not have a colostomy. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1984 and a lump was removed from her breast. Her bouts with cancer were never made public during her lifetime.
During her widowhood, Elizabeth continued to travel extensively, including on over forty official visits overseas. In 1975, she visited Iran at the invitation of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. The British ambassador and his wife, Anthony and Sheila Parsons, noted how the Iranians were bemused by her habit of speaking to everyone regardless of status or importance, and hoped the Shah&#x27;s entourage would learn from the visit to pay more attention to ordinary people. Between 1976 and 1984, she made annual summer visits to France, which were among 22 private trips to continental Europe between 1963 and 1992.

In 1982, Elizabeth was rushed to hospital when a fish bone became stuck in her throat, and had an operation to remove it. Being a keen angler, she calmly joked afterwards, &quot;The salmon have got their own back.&quot; Similar incidents occurred at Balmoral in August 1986, when she was hospitalised at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary overnight but no operation was needed, and in May 1993, when she was admitted to the Infirmary for surgery under general anaesthetic.

In 1987, Elizabeth was criticised when it emerged that two of her nieces, Nerissa and Katherine Bowes-Lyon, had been committed to a psychiatric hospital in Redhill, Surrey, in 1941 because they had severe learning disabilities. However, &quot;Burke&#x27;s Peerage&quot; had listed the sisters as dead, apparently because their mother, Fenella (Elizabeth&#x27;s sister-in-law), &quot;was &#x27;extremely vague&#x27; when it came to filling in forms and might not have completed the paperwork for the family entry correctly&quot;. When Nerissa died in 1986, her grave was originally marked with a plastic tag and a serial number. Elizabeth said that the news of their institutionalisation came as a surprise to her.

===Centenarian===

In her later years, Elizabeth became known for her longevity. Her 90th birthday—4 August 1990—was celebrated by a parade on 27 June that involved many of the 300 organisations of which she was a patron. In 1995, she attended events commemorating the end of the war fifty years before and had two operations: one to remove a cataract in her left eye and one to replace her right hip. In 1998, her left hip was replaced after it was broken when she slipped and fell during a visit to Sandringham stables.

Elizabeth&#x27;s 100th birthday was celebrated in a number of ways: a parade, with contributions from Sir Norman Wisdom and Sir John Mills, celebrated highlights of her life; the Royal Bank of Scotland issued a commemorative £20 note with her image; and she attended a lunch at the Guildhall, London, at which George Carey, the Archbishop of Canterbury, accidentally attempted to drink her glass of wine. Her quick admonition of &quot;That&#x27;s mine!&quot; caused widespread amusement. In November 2000, she broke her collarbone in a fall that kept her recuperating at home over Christmas and the New Year holiday.

On 1 August 2001, Elizabeth had a blood transfusion for anaemia after suffering from mild heat exhaustion, though she was well enough to make her traditional appearance outside Clarence House three days later to celebrate her 101st birthday. Her final public engagements included planting a cross at the Field of Remembrance on 8 November 2001; a reception at the Guildhall, London, for the reformation of the 600 Squadron, Royal Auxiliary Air Force on 15 November; and attending the re-commissioning of on 22 November.

In December 2001, aged 101, Elizabeth fractured her pelvis in a fall. Even so, she insisted on standing for the national anthem during the memorial service for her husband on 6 February the following year. Just three days later, their second daughter, Princess Margaret, died. On 13 February 2002, Elizabeth fell and cut her arm in her sitting room at Sandringham House; an ambulance and doctor were called, and the wound was dressed. She was still determined to attend Margaret&#x27;s funeral at St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle, two days later on the Friday of that week, even though the Queen and the rest of the royal family were concerned about the journey the Queen Mother would face to get from Norfolk to Windsor; she was also rumoured to be hardly eating. Nevertheless, she flew to Windsor by helicopter, and so that no photographs of her in a wheelchair (which she hated being seen in) could be taken—she insisted that she be shielded from the press—she travelled to the service in a people carrier with blacked-out windows, which had been previously used by Margaret.

On 5 March 2002, Elizabeth attended the luncheon of the annual lawn party of the Eton Beagles and watched the Cheltenham Races on television; however, her health began to deteriorate precipitously during her last weeks, after she retreated to Royal Lodge for the final time.

==Death==

On 30 March 2002, at 15:15 GMT, Elizabeth died at the Royal Lodge, Windsor, at the age of 101. Her surviving daughter, Queen Elizabeth II, was by her side. The Queen Mother had been suffering from a chest cold since Christmas 2001. At 101 years and 238 days old she was the first member of the British royal family to live past the age of 100. She was the longest-living member of the British royal family at the time of her death. Her surviving sister-in-law, Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester, exceeded that, dying at the age of 102 on 29 October 2004. She was one of the longest-lived members of any royal family.

Elizabeth grew camellias in each of her gardens, and before her flag-draped coffin was taken from Windsor to lie in state at Westminster Hall, an arrangement of camellias from her own gardens was placed on top. An estimated 200,000 people over three days filed past as she lay in state in Westminster Hall at the Palace of Westminster. Members of the Household Cavalry and other branches of the armed forces stood guard at the four corners of the catafalque. At one point, her four grandsons–Prince Charles, Prince Andrew, Prince Edward and Viscount Linley–mounted the guard as a mark of respect, an honour similar to the Vigil of the Princes at the lying in state of King George V.

On the day of Elizabeth&#x27;s funeral, 9 April, the governor general of Canada, Adrienne Clarkson, issued a proclamation asking Canadians to honour Elizabeth&#x27;s memory that day. In Australia, Governor-General Peter Hollingworth read the lesson at a memorial service held in St Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral, Sydney.

In London, more than a million people filled the area outside Westminster Abbey and along the route from central London to Elizabeth&#x27;s final resting place in the King George VI Memorial Chapel beside her husband and younger daughter in St George&#x27;s Chapel. At her request, after her funeral the wreath that had lain atop her coffin was placed on the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior, in a gesture that echoed her wedding-day tribute 79 years before.

==Legacy==
Known for her personal and public charm, Elizabeth was one of the most popular members of the royal family, and helped to stabilise the popularity of the monarchy as a whole.

Elizabeth&#x27;s critics included Kitty Kelley, who falsely alleged that she did not abide by the rationing regulations during the Second World War. This, however, was contradicted by the official records, and Eleanor Roosevelt during her wartime stay at Buckingham Palace reported expressly on the rationed food served in the Palace and the limited bathwater that was permitted. Claims that Elizabeth used racist slurs to refer to black people were strongly denied by Major Colin Burgess, the husband of Elizabeth Burgess, a mixed-race secretary who accused members of Prince Charles&#x27;s household of racial abuse. Elizabeth made no public comments on race, but according to Robert Rhodes James, in private she &quot;abhorred racial discrimination&quot; and decried apartheid as &quot;dreadful&quot;. Woodrow Wyatt records in his diary that when he expressed the view that non-white countries have nothing in common with &quot;us&quot;, she told him, &quot;I am very keen on the Commonwealth. They&#x27;re all like us.&quot; However, she did distrust Germans; she told Wyatt, &quot;Never trust them, never trust them.&quot; While she may have held such views, it has been argued that they were normal for British people of her generation and upbringing, who had experienced two vicious wars with Germany.
In his official biography, William Shawcross portrays Elizabeth as a person whose indomitable optimism, zest for life, good manners, mischievous sense of humour, and interest in people and subjects of all kinds contributed to her exceptional popularity and to her longevity. Sir Hugh Casson said Elizabeth was like &quot;a wave breaking on a rock, because although she is sweet and pretty and charming, she also has a basic streak of toughness and tenacity. ... when a wave breaks on a rock, it showers and sparkles with a brilliant play of foam and droplets in the sun, yet beneath is really hard, tough rock, fused, in her case, from strong principles, physical courage and a sense of duty.&quot; Sir Peter Ustinov described her during a student demonstration at the University of Dundee in 1968:

Elizabeth was well known for her dry witticisms. On hearing that Edwina Mountbatten was buried at sea, she said: &quot;Dear Edwina, she always liked to make a splash.&quot; Accompanied by the gay writer Sir Noël Coward at a gala, she mounted a staircase lined with guards. Noticing Coward&#x27;s eyes flicker momentarily across the soldiers, she murmured to him: &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t if I were you, Noël; they count them before they put them out.&quot;

After being advised by a Conservative minister in the 1970s not to employ homosexuals, Elizabeth observed that without them, &quot;we&#x27;d have to go self-service&quot;. On the fate of a gift of a nebuchadnezzar of champagne (20 bottles&#x27; worth) even if her family did not come for the holidays, she said, &quot;I&#x27;ll polish it off myself.&quot; Emine Saner of &quot;The Guardian&quot; suggests that with a gin and Dubonnet at noon, red wine with lunch, a port and martini at 6 pm and two glasses of champagne at dinner, &quot;a conservative estimate puts the number of alcohol units she drank at 70 a week&quot;. Her lifestyle amused journalists, particularly when it was revealed she had a multi-million pound overdraft with Coutts Bank.

Elizabeth&#x27;s habits were parodied by the satirical 1980s television programme &quot;Spitting Image&quot;. This was the first satirical depiction on television; the makers initially demurred from featuring her, fearing that it would be considered off-limits by most of the viewing public. In the end, she was portrayed as a perpetually tipsy Beryl Reid soundalike. She was portrayed by Juliet Aubrey in &quot;Bertie and Elizabeth&quot;, Sylvia Syms in &quot;The Queen&quot;, Natalie Dormer in &quot;W.E.&quot;, Olivia Colman in &quot;Hyde Park on Hudson&quot;, Victoria Hamilton (Seasons 1 and 2), Marion Bailey (Seasons 3 and 4) and Marcia Warren (Season 5 and 6) in &quot;The Crown&quot; and in &quot;The King&#x27;s Speech&quot; by Helena Bonham Carter, who was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress and won a BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for her portrayal.
The Cunard White Star Line&#x27;s was named after her. She launched the ship on 27 September 1938 in Clydebank, Scotland. Supposedly, the liner started to slide into the water before Elizabeth could officially launch her, and acting sharply, she managed to smash a bottle of Australian red over the liner&#x27;s bow just before it slid out of reach. In 1954, Elizabeth sailed to New York on her namesake.

A statue of Elizabeth by sculptor Philip Jackson was unveiled in front of the George VI Memorial, off The Mall, London, on 24 February 2009, creating the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Memorial.

In March 2011, Elizabeth&#x27;s eclectic musical taste was revealed when details of her small record collection kept at the Castle of Mey were made public. Her records included ska, local folk, Scottish reels and the musicals &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; and &quot;The King and I&quot;, and artists such as yodeller Montana Slim, Tony Hancock, The Goons and Noël Coward.

Eight years before her death, Elizabeth had reportedly placed two-thirds of her money (an estimated £19 million) into trusts, for the benefit of her great-grandchildren. In her lifetime, she received £643,000 a year from the Civil List, and spent an estimated £1–2 million annually to run her household. By the end of the 1990s, her overdraft was said to be around £4 million. She left the bulk of her estate, estimated to be worth between £50 and £70 million, including paintings, Fabergé eggs, jewellery, and horses, to her surviving daughter, Queen Elizabeth II. Under an agreement reached in 1993, property passing from monarch to monarch is exempt from inheritance tax, as is property passing from the consort of a former monarch to the current monarch, so a tax liability estimated at £28 million (40 percent of the value of the estate) was not incurred. The most important pieces of art were transferred to the Royal Collection by Elizabeth II. Following her death, the Queen successfully applied to the High Court so that details of her mother&#x27;s will would be kept secret. This brought criticism from Labour politicians and segments of the public, and the Queen eventually released the outlines of her mother&#x27;s will.

==Titles, honours and arms==

===Titles and styles===

Elizabeth held numerous titles starting with her birth, as the daughter of an earl and through her marriage to the-then Duke of York, who later became King-Emperor. She was the last person to be Empress of India, and was Queen Mother during widowhood.

===Arms===
Elizabeth&#x27;s coat of arms was the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom (in either the English or the Scottish version) impaled with the canting arms of her father, the Earl of Strathmore; the latter being: 1st and 4th quarters, Argent, a lion rampant Azure, armed and langued Gules, within a double tressure flory-counter-flory of the second (Lyon); 2nd and 3rd quarters, Ermine, three bows stringed paleways proper (Bowes). The shield is surmounted by the imperial crown, and supported by the crowned lion of England and a lion rampant per fess Or and Gules.

<text>The Mikado; or, The Town of Titipu is a comic opera in two acts, with music by Arthur Sullivan and libretto by W. S. Gilbert, their ninth of fourteen operatic collaborations. It opened on 14 March 1885, in London, where it ran at the Savoy Theatre for 672 performances, the second-longest run for any work of musical theatre and one of the longest runs of any theatre piece up to that time. By the end of 1885, it was estimated that, in Europe and America, at least 150 companies were producing the opera.

&quot;The Mikado&quot; is the most internationally successful Savoy opera and has been especially popular with amateur and school productions. The work has been translated into numerous languages and is one of the most frequently played musical theatre pieces in history. &quot;The Mikado&quot; is a satire of late 19th century British institutions, society and politics. By setting the opera in a fantasy Japan, an exotic locale far away from contemporary Britain, Gilbert was able to satirise British politics more freely and soften the impact of his criticisms of British social institutions, in a similar way that he used other &quot;foreign&quot; settings in &quot;Princess Ida&quot;, &quot;The Gondoliers&quot;, &quot;Utopia, Limited&quot; and &quot;The Grand Duke&quot;. Nevertheless, some 21st-century productions of the opera in the United States have drawn criticism for promoting stereotypes of East Asians.

==Origins==

Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s opera immediately preceding &quot;The Mikado&quot; was &quot;Princess Ida&quot; (1884), which ran for nine months, a short duration by Savoy opera standards. When ticket sales for &quot;Princess Ida&quot; showed early signs of flagging, the impresario Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte realised that, for the first time since 1877, no new Gilbert and Sullivan work would be ready when the old one closed. On 22 March 1884, Carte gave Gilbert and Sullivan contractual notice that a new opera would be required within six months. Sullivan&#x27;s close friend, the conductor Frederic Clay, had suffered a serious stroke in December 1883 that effectively ended his career. Reflecting on this, on his own precarious health, and on his desire to devote himself to more serious music, Sullivan replied to Carte that &quot;it is impossible for me to do another piece of the character of those already written by Gilbert and myself&quot;. Gilbert, who had already started work on a new libretto in which people fall in love against their wills after taking a magic lozenge, was surprised to hear of Sullivan&#x27;s hesitation. He wrote to Sullivan asking him to reconsider, but the composer replied on 2 April 1884 that he had &quot;come to the end of my tether&quot; with the operas:
Gilbert wrote that Sullivan&#x27;s letter caused him &quot;considerable pain&quot;. Sullivan responded that he could not set the &quot;lozenge plot&quot;, stating that it was too similar to the plot of their 1877 opera &quot;The Sorcerer&quot;. As April 1884 wore on, Gilbert tried to modify his plot, but he could not satisfy Sullivan. The parties were at a stalemate, and Gilbert wrote, &quot;And so ends a musical &amp; literary association of seven years&#x27; standing – an association of exceptional reputation – an association unequaled in its monetary results, and hitherto undisturbed by a single jarring or discordant element.&quot; But by 8 May 1884, Gilbert was ready to back down, writing: &quot;am I to understand that if I construct another plot in which no supernatural element occurs, you will undertake to set it? ... a consistent plot, free from anachronisms, constructed in perfect good faith &amp; to the best of my ability.&quot; The stalemate was broken, and on 20 May, Gilbert sent Sullivan a sketch of the plot to &quot;The Mikado&quot;. It would take another ten months for &quot;The Mikado&quot; to reach the stage. A revised version of &quot;The Sorcerer&quot; coupled with their one-act piece &quot;Trial by Jury&quot; (1875) played at the Savoy while Carte and their audiences awaited their next work. Gilbert eventually found a place for his &quot;lozenge plot&quot; in &quot;The Mountebanks&quot;, written with Alfred Cellier in 1892.
In 1914, Cellier and Bridgeman first recorded the familiar story of how Gilbert found his inspiration:
The story is an appealing one, but it is largely fictional. Gilbert was interviewed twice about his inspiration for &quot;The Mikado&quot;. In both interviews the sword was mentioned, and in one of them he said it was the inspiration for the opera, though he never said the sword had fallen. What puts the entire story in doubt is Cellier and Bridgeman&#x27;s error concerning the Japanese Village exhibition in Knightsbridge: it did not open until 10 January 1885, eight months after Gilbert sent the outline of the plot to Sullivan and almost two months after Gilbert had completed Act I. Gilbert scholar Brian Jones, in his article &quot;The Sword that Never Fell&quot;, notes that &quot;the further removed in time the writer is from the incident, the more graphically it is recalled.&quot; Leslie Baily, for instance, told it this way in 1952:

The story was dramatised in more or less this form in the 1999 film &quot;Topsy-Turvy&quot;. But although the 1885–87 Japanese exhibition in Knightsbridge had not opened when Gilbert conceived of &quot;The Mikado&quot;, European trade with Japan had increased in recent decades, and an English craze for all things Japanese had built through the 1860s and 1870s. This made the time ripe for an opera set in Japan. Gilbert told a journalist, &quot;I cannot give you a good reason for our ... piece being laid in Japan. It ... afforded scope for picturesque treatment, scenery and costume, and I think that the idea of a chief magistrate, who is ... judge and actual executioner in one, and yet would not hurt a worm, may perhaps please the public.&quot;

In an 1885 interview with the &quot;New-York Daily Tribune&quot;, Gilbert said that the short stature of Leonora Braham, Jessie Bond and Sybil Grey &quot;suggested the advisability of grouping them as three Japanese school-girls&quot;, the opera&#x27;s &quot;three little maids&quot;. He also recounted that a young Japanese lady, a tea server at the Japanese Village, came to rehearsals to coach the three women in Japanese dance. On 12 February 1885, one month before &quot;The Mikado&quot; opened, &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; wrote about the opening of the Japanese Village noting, among other things, that &quot;the graceful, fantastic dancing featured ... three little maids!&quot; In the &quot;Tribune&quot; interview, Gilbert also related that he and Sullivan had decided to cut the only solo sung by the opera&#x27;s title character (who appears only in Act II, played by Savoy veteran Richard Temple), but that members of the company and others who had witnessed the dress rehearsal &quot;came to us in a body and begged us to restore the excised &#x27;number&#x27;&quot;.

==Roles==

* The Mikado of Japan (bass or bass-baritone)
* Nanki-Poo, &quot;His Son, disguised as a wandering minstrel and in love with Yum-Yum&quot; (tenor)
* Ko-Ko, &quot;The Lord High Executioner of Titipu&quot; (comic baritone)
* Pooh-Bah, &quot;Lord High Everything Else&quot; (baritone)
* Pish-Tush, &quot;A Noble Lord&quot; (baritone)&lt;ref group=&quot;n&quot; name=&quot;Pish/Go&quot;&gt;The actor who originally played Pish-Tush proved unable satisfactorily to sing the low notes in the Act Two quartet, &quot;Brightly dawns our wedding day&quot;. The Pish-Tush line in this quartet lies lower than the rest of the role and ends on a bottom F. Therefore, an extra bass character, called Go-To, was introduced for this song and the dialogue scene leading into it. The D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company continued generally to bifurcate the role, but vocal scores generally do not mention it. Other companies, however, have generally eliminated the role of Go-To and restored the material to Pish-Tush, when the role is played by someone with a sufficient vocal range.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Go-To, &quot;A Noble Lord&quot; (bass-baritone)
* Yum-Yum, &quot;A Ward of Ko-Ko, also engaged to Ko-Ko&quot; (soprano)
* Pitti-Sing, &quot;A Ward of Ko-Ko&quot; (mezzo-soprano)
* Peep-Bo, &quot;A Ward of Ko-Ko&quot; (soprano or mezzo-soprano)
* Katisha, &quot;An Elderly lady, in love with Nanki-Poo&quot; (contralto)
* Chorus of School-Girls, Nobles, Guards and Coolies

==Synopsis==

===Act I===
;Courtyard of Ko-Ko&#x27;s Official Residence

Gentlemen of the fictitious Japanese town of Titipu are gathered (&quot;If you want to know who we are&quot;). A handsome but poor minstrel, Nanki-Poo, arrives and introduces himself (&quot;A wand&#x27;ring minstrel I&quot;). He inquires about his beloved, a schoolgirl called Yum-Yum, who is a ward of Ko-Ko (formerly a cheap tailor). One of the gentlemen, Pish-Tush, explains that when the Mikado decreed that flirting was a capital crime, the Titipu authorities frustrated the decree by appointing Ko-Ko, a prisoner condemned to death for flirting, to the post of Lord High Executioner (&quot;Our great Mikado, virtuous man&quot;). As Ko-Ko was the next prisoner scheduled to be decapitated, the town authorities reasoned that he could &quot;not cut off another&#x27;s head until he cut his own off&quot;, and since Ko-Ko was not likely to execute himself, no executions could take place. But all the town officials, except the haughty nobleman Pooh-Bah, proved too proud to serve under an ex-tailor and resigned. Pooh-Bah now holds all their posts and collects all their salaries. He informs Nanki-Poo that Yum-Yum is scheduled to marry Ko-Ko on the very day that he has returned (&quot;Young man, despair&quot;).

Ko-Ko enters (&quot;Behold the Lord High Executioner&quot;) and asserts himself by reading off a list of people &quot;who would not be missed&quot; if they were executed (&quot;As some day it may happen&quot;), such as people &quot;who eat peppermint and puff it in your face&quot;. Yum-Yum appears with Ko-Ko&#x27;s other two wards, Peep-Bo and Pitti-Sing (&quot;Comes a train of little ladies&quot;, &quot;Three little maids from school&quot;). Pooh-Bah does not think that the girls have shown him enough respect (&quot;So please you, sir&quot;). Nanki-Poo arrives and informs Ko-Ko of his love for Yum-Yum. Ko-Ko sends him away, but Nanki-Poo manages to meet with his beloved and reveals his secret to Yum-Yum: he is the son and heir of the Mikado, but travels in disguise to avoid the amorous advances of Katisha, an elderly lady of his father&#x27;s court. They lament that the law forbids them to flirt (&quot;Were you not to Ko-Ko plighted&quot;).

Ko-Ko and Pooh-Bah receive news that the Mikado has just decreed that unless an execution is carried out in Titipu within a month, the town will be reduced to the rank of a village, which would bring &quot;irretrievable ruin&quot;. Pooh-Bah and Pish-Tush point to Ko-Ko himself as the obvious choice for beheading, since he was already under sentence of death (&quot;I am so proud&quot;). But Ko-Ko argues that it would be &quot;extremely difficult, not to say dangerous&quot;, for someone to attempt to behead himself, and that suicide is a capital offence. Fortuitously, Ko-Ko discovers that Nanki-Poo, in despair over losing Yum-Yum, is preparing to commit suicide. After ascertaining that nothing would change Nanki-Poo&#x27;s mind, Ko-Ko makes a bargain with him: Nanki-Poo may marry Yum-Yum for one month if, at the end of that time, he allows himself to be executed. Ko-Ko would then marry the young widow.

Everyone arrives to celebrate Nanki-Poo and Yum-Yum&#x27;s union (&quot;With aspect stern and gloomy stride&quot;), but the festivities are interrupted by the arrival of Katisha, who has come to claim Nanki-Poo as her husband. But the townspeople are sympathetic to the young couple, and Katisha&#x27;s attempts to reveal Nanki-Poo&#x27;s secret are drowned out by their shouting. Outwitted but not defeated, Katisha makes clear that she intends to be avenged.

===Act II===
; Ko-Ko&#x27;s Garden
Yum-Yum&#x27;s friends are preparing her for her wedding (&quot;Braid the raven hair&quot;). She muses on her own beauty (&quot;The sun whose rays&quot;), but Pitti-Sing and Peep-Bo remind her of the limited duration of her approaching union with Nanki-Poo. Joined by Nanki-Poo and Pish-Tush, they try to keep their spirits up (&quot;Brightly dawns our wedding-day&quot;), but soon Ko-Ko and Pooh-Bah enter to inform them of a twist in the law that states that when a married man is beheaded for flirting, his wife must be buried alive (&quot;Here&#x27;s a how-de-do&quot;). Yum-Yum is unwilling to marry under these circumstances, and so Nanki-Poo challenges Ko-Ko to behead him on the spot. It turns out that the soft-hearted Ko-Ko has never executed anyone and cannot execute Nanki-Poo. Instead, he sends Nanki-Poo and Yum-Yum away to be wed (by Pooh-Bah, as Archbishop of Titipu), promising to present to the Mikado a false affidavit in evidence of the fictitious execution.
The Mikado and Katisha arrive in Titipu accompanied by a large procession (&quot;Mi-ya Sa-Ma&quot;, &quot;From Every Kind of Man&quot;). The Mikado describes his system of justice (&quot;A more humane Mikado&quot;). Ko-Ko assumes that the ruler has come to see whether an execution has been carried out. Aided by Pitti-Sing and Pooh-Bah, he graphically describes the supposed execution (&quot;The criminal cried&quot;) and hands the Mikado the certificate of death, signed and sworn to by Pooh-Bah as coroner. Ko-Ko notes slyly that most of the town&#x27;s important officers (that is, Pooh-Bah) were present at the ceremony. But the Mikado has come about an entirely different matter: he is searching for his son. When they hear that the Mikado&#x27;s son &quot;goes by the name of Nanki-Poo&quot;, the three panic, and Ko-Ko says that Nanki-Poo &quot;has gone abroad&quot;. Meanwhile, Katisha is reading the death certificate and notes with horror that the person executed was Nanki-Poo. The Mikado, though expressing understanding and sympathy (&quot;See How the Fates&quot;), discusses with Katisha the statutory punishment &quot;for compassing the death of the heir apparent&quot; to the Imperial throne – something lingering, &quot;with boiling oil ... or melted lead&quot;. With the three conspirators facing painful execution, Ko-Ko pleads with Nanki-Poo to reveal himself to his father. Nanki-Poo fears that Katisha will demand his execution if she finds he is alive, but he suggests that if Katisha could be persuaded to marry Ko-Ko, then Nanki-Poo could safely &quot;come to life again&quot;, as Katisha would have no claim on him (&quot;The flowers that bloom in the spring&quot;). Though Katisha is &quot;something appalling&quot;, Ko-Ko has no choice: it is marriage to Katisha or painful death for himself, Pitti-Sing and Pooh-Bah.

Ko-Ko finds Katisha mourning her loss (&quot;Alone, and yet alive&quot;) and throws himself on her mercy. He begs for her hand in marriage, saying that he has long harboured a passion for her. Katisha initially rebuffs him, but is soon moved by his story of a bird who died of heartbreak (&quot;Tit-willow&quot;). She agrees (&quot;There is beauty in the bellow of the blast&quot;) and, once the ceremony is performed (by Pooh-Bah, the Registrar), she begs for the Mikado&#x27;s mercy for him and his accomplices. Nanki-Poo and Yum-Yum then reappear, sparking Katisha&#x27;s fury. The Mikado is astonished that Nanki-Poo is alive, as the account of his execution had been given with such &quot;affecting particulars&quot;. Ko-Ko explains that when a royal command for an execution is given, the victim is, legally speaking, as good as dead, &quot;and if he &quot;is&quot; dead, why not say so?&quot; The Mikado deems that &quot;Nothing could possibly be more satisfactory&quot;, and everyone in Titipu celebrates (&quot;For he&#x27;s gone and married Yum-Yum&quot;).

==Productions==

&quot;The Mikado&quot; had the longest original run of the Savoy Operas. It also had the quickest revival: after Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s next work, &quot;Ruddigore&quot;, closed relatively quickly, three operas were revived to fill the interregnum until &quot;The Yeomen of the Guard&quot; was ready, including &quot;The Mikado&quot;, just 17 months after its first run closed. On 4 September 1891, D&#x27;Oyly Carte&#x27;s touring &quot;C&quot; company gave a Royal Command Performance of &quot;The Mikado&quot; at Balmoral Castle before Queen Victoria and the Royal Family. The original set design was by Hawes Craven, with men&#x27;s costumes by C. Wilhelm. The first provincial production of &quot;The Mikado&quot; opened on 27 July 1885 in Brighton, with several members of that company leaving in August to present the first authorised American production in New York. From then on, &quot;The Mikado&quot; was a constant presence on tour. From 1885 until the company&#x27;s closure in 1982, there was no year in which a D&#x27;Oyly Carte company (or several of them) was not presenting it.

&quot;The Mikado&quot; was revived again while &quot;The Grand Duke&quot; was in preparation. When it became clear that that opera was not a success, &quot;The Mikado&quot; was given at matinees, and the revival continued when &quot;The Grand Duke&quot; closed after just three months. In 1906–07, Helen Carte, the widow of Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte, mounted a repertory season at the Savoy, but &quot;The Mikado&quot; was not performed, as it was thought that visiting Japanese royalty might be offended by it. It was included, however, in Mrs. Carte&#x27;s second repertory season, in 1908–09. New costume designs were created by Charles Ricketts for the 1926 season and were used until 1982. Peter Goffin designed new sets in 1952.
In America, as had happened with &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;, the first productions were unauthorised, but once D&#x27;Oyly Carte&#x27;s American production opened in August 1885, it was a success, earning record profits, and Carte formed several companies to tour the show in North America. Burlesque and parody productions, including political parodies, were mounted. More than 150 unauthorised versions cropped up, and, as had been the case with &quot;Pinafore&quot;, Carte, Gilbert and Sullivan could do nothing to prevent them or to capture any license fees, since there was no international copyright treaty at the time. Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte tried various techniques for gaining an American copyright that would prevent unauthorised productions. The U.S. courts held, however, that the act of publication made the opera freely available for production by anyone. In Australia, &quot;The Mikado&quot;&#x27;s first authorised performance was on 14 November 1885 at the Theatre Royal, Sydney, produced by J. C. Williamson. During 1886, Carte was touring five Mikado companies in North America.

Carte toured the opera in 1886 and again in 1887 in Germany and elsewhere in Europe. In September 1886 Vienna&#x27;s leading critic, Eduard Hanslick, wrote that the opera&#x27;s &quot;unparalleled success&quot; was attributable not only to the libretto and the music, but also to &quot;the wholly original stage performance, unique of its kind, by Mr D&#x27;Oyly Carte&#x27;s artists ... riveting the eye and ear with its exotic allurement.&quot; &quot;The Mikado&quot; was performed more than 200 times in Berlin alone by 1891 and 100 times in Vienna, of just one of the translations available, by 1894; Sullivan went to Berlin in 1900 to conduct the opera at the Royal Opera as a command performance for Kaiser Wilhelm II. Productions continued in German-speaking countries, both authorised and unauthorised by D&#x27;Oyly Carte, and productions were also seen in France, Holland, Hungary, Spain, Belgium, Scandinavia, Russia and elsewhere. Thousands of amateur productions have been mounted throughout the English-speaking world and beyond since the 1880s. One production during World War I was given in the Ruhleben internment camp in Germany.

After the Gilbert copyrights expired in 1962, the Sadler&#x27;s Wells Opera mounted the first non-D&#x27;Oyly Carte professional production in England, with Clive Revill as Ko-Ko. Among the many professional revivals since then was an English National Opera production in 1986, with Eric Idle as Ko-Ko and Lesley Garrett as Yum-Yum, directed by Jonathan Miller. This production, which has been revived numerous times over three decades, is set in a swanky 1920s English seaside hotel, with sets and costumes in black and white &quot;as an homage to the Marx Brothers, Noël Coward, and Busby Berkeley&quot;. Canada&#x27;s Stratford Festival has produced &quot;The Mikado&quot; several times, first in 1963 and again in 1982 (revived in 1983 and 1984) and in 1993.

The following table shows the history of the D&#x27;Oyly Carte productions in Gilbert&#x27;s lifetime:

==Analysis and reception==

===Themes of death===

&quot;The Mikado&quot; is a comedy, yet it deals with themes of death and cruelty. This juxtaposition works because Gilbert treats these themes as trivial, even lighthearted issues. For instance, in the song &quot;Our great Mikado, virtuous man&quot;, Pish-Tush sings: &quot;The youth who winked a roving eye / Or breathed a non-connubial sigh / Was thereupon condemned to die – / He usually objected.&quot; The term for this rhetorical technique is meiosis, a drastic understatement of the situation. Other examples of this are when self-decapitation is described as &quot;an extremely difficult, not to say dangerous, thing to attempt&quot;, and also as merely &quot;awkward&quot;. When a discussion occurs of Nanki-Poo&#x27;s life being &quot;cut short in a month&quot;, the tone remains comic and only mock-melancholy. Burial alive is described as &quot;a stuffy death&quot;. Finally, execution by boiling oil or by melted lead is described by the Mikado as a &quot;humorous but lingering&quot; punishment.

Death is treated as a businesslike event in Gilbert&#x27;s topsy-turvy world. Pooh-Bah calls Ko-Ko, the Lord High Executioner, an &quot;industrious mechanic&quot;. Ko-Ko also treats his bloody office as a profession, saying, &quot;I can&#x27;t consent to embark on a professional operation unless I see my way to a successful result.&quot; Of course, joking about death does not originate with &quot;The Mikado&quot;. The plot conceit that Nanki-Poo may marry Yum-Yum if he agrees to die at the end of the month was used in &quot;A Wife for a Month&quot;, a 17th-century play by John Fletcher. Ko-Ko&#x27;s final speech affirms that death has been, throughout the opera, a fiction, a matter of words that can be dispelled with a phrase or two: being dead and being &quot;as good as dead&quot; are equated. In a review of the original production of &quot;The Mikado&quot;, after praising the show generally, the critic noted that the show&#x27;s humour nevertheless depends on &quot;unsparing exposure of human weaknesses and follies – things grave and even horrible invested with a ridiculous aspect – all the motives prompting our actions traced back to inexhaustible sources of selfishness and cowardice... Decapitation, disembowelment, immersion in boiling oil or molten lead are the eventualities upon which [the characters&#x27;] attention (and that of the audience) is kept fixed with gruesome persistence... [Gilbert] has unquestionably succeeded in imbuing society with his own quaint, scornful, inverted philosophy; and has thereby established a solid claim to rank amongst the foremost of those latter-day Englishmen who have exercised a distinct psychical influence upon their contemporaries.&quot;

===Japanese setting===

The opera is named after the Emperor of Japan using the term &quot;mikado&quot; (御門 or 帝 or みかど), literally meaning &quot;the honourable gate&quot; of the imperial palace, referring metaphorically to its occupant and to the palace itself. The term was commonly used by the English in the 19th century but became obsolete. To the extent that the opera portrays Japanese culture, style and government, it is a fictional version of Japan used to provide a picturesque setting and to capitalise on Japonism and the British fascination with Japan and the Far East in the 1880s. Gilbert wrote, &quot;The Mikado of the opera was an imaginary monarch of a remote period and cannot by any exercise of ingenuity be taken to be a slap on an existing institution.&quot; &quot;The Mikado&quot; &quot;was never a story about Japan but about the failings of the British government&quot;.

By setting the opera in a foreign land, Gilbert felt able to more sharply criticise British society and institutions. G. K. Chesterton compared the opera&#x27;s satire to that in Jonathan Swift&#x27;s &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;: &quot;Gilbert pursued and persecuted the evils of modern England till they had literally not a leg to stand on, exactly as Swift did. ... I doubt if there is a single joke in the whole play that fits the Japanese. But all the jokes in the play fit the English. ... About England, Pooh-bah is something more than a satire; he is the truth.&quot; The opera&#x27;s setting draws on Victorian notions of the far east, gleaned by Gilbert from the glimpses of Japanese fashion and art that immediately followed the beginning of trade between the two island empires, and during rehearsals Gilbert visited the popular Japanese exhibition in Knightsbridge, London. A critic wrote in 2016: &quot;It has been argued that the theatricality of the show was ... a tribute on the part of Gilbert and Sullivan to the growing British appreciation of the Japanese aesthetic [in the 1880s].&quot;

Gilbert sought authenticity in the Japanese setting, costumes, movements and gestures of the actors. To that end, he engaged some of the Japanese at the Knightsbridge village to advise on the production and to coach the actors. &quot;The Directors and Native Inhabitants&quot; of the village were thanked in the programme that was distributed on the first night. Sullivan inserted into his score, as &quot;Miya sama&quot;, a version of a Japanese military march song, called &quot;Ton-yare Bushi&quot;, composed in the Meiji era. Giacomo Puccini later incorporated the same song into &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; as the introduction to &quot;Yamadori, ancor le pene&quot;. The characters&#x27; names in the play are not Japanese names, but rather (in many cases) English baby-talk or simply dismissive exclamations. For instance, a pretty young thing is named &quot;Pitti-Sing&quot;; the beautiful heroine is named &quot;Yum-Yum&quot;; the pompous officials are &quot;Pooh-Bah&quot; and &quot;Pish-Tush&quot;; the hero is called &quot;Nanki-Poo&quot;, baby-talk for &quot;handkerchief&quot;. The headsman&#x27;s name, &quot;Ko-Ko&quot;, is similar to that of the scheming Ko-Ko-Ri-Ko in &quot;Ba-ta-clan&quot; by Jacques Offenbach.
The Japanese were ambivalent toward &quot;The Mikado&quot; for many years. Some Japanese critics saw the depiction of the title character as a disrespectful representation of the revered Meiji Emperor; Japanese theatre was prohibited from depicting the emperor on stage. Japanese Prince Komatsu Akihito, who saw an 1886 production in London, took no offence. When Prince Fushimi Sadanaru made a state visit in 1907, the British government banned performances of &quot;The Mikado&quot; from London for six weeks, fearing that the play might offend him – a manoeuvre that backfired when the prince complained that he had hoped to see &quot;The Mikado&quot; during his stay. A Japanese journalist covering the prince&#x27;s stay attended a proscribed performance and confessed himself &quot;deeply and pleasingly disappointed.&quot; Expecting &quot;real insults&quot; to his country, he had found only &quot;bright music and much fun.&quot;

After World War II, &quot;The Mikado&quot; was staged in Japan in a number of private performances. The first public production, given at three performances, was in 1946 in the Ernie Pyle Theatre in Tokyo, conducted by the pianist Jorge Bolet for the entertainment of American troops and Japanese audiences. The set and costumes were opulent, and the principal players were American, Canadian, and British, as were the women&#x27;s chorus, but the male chorus, the female dancing chorus and the orchestra were Japanese. General Douglas MacArthur banned a large-scale professional 1947 Tokyo production by an all-Japanese cast, but other productions have occurred in Japan. For example, the opera was performed at the Ernie Pyle Theatre in Tokyo in 1970, presented by the Eighth Army Special Service.

In 2001, the town of Chichibu (秩父), Japan, under the name of &quot;Tokyo Theatre Company&quot;, produced an adaptation of &quot;The Mikado&quot; in Japanese. Locals believe that Chichibu was the town Gilbert had in mind when he named his setting &quot;Titipu&quot;, but there is no contemporary evidence for this theory. Although the Hepburn system of transliteration (in which the name of the town appears as &quot;Chichibu&quot;) is usually found today, it was very common in the 19th century to use the Nihon-shiki system, in which the name 秩父 appears as &quot;Titibu&quot;. Thus, it is easy to surmise that &quot;Titibu&quot;, found in the London press of 1884, became &quot;Titipu&quot; in the opera. Japanese researchers speculate that Gilbert may have heard of Chichibu silk, an important export in the 19th century. The town&#x27;s Japanese-language adaptation of &quot;The Mikado&quot; has been revived several times throughout Japan and, in 2006, the &quot;Chichibu Mikado&quot; was performed at the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival in England.

====Criticism====
Since the 1990s, some productions of the opera in the United States have drawn criticism from the Asian-American community as promoting &quot;simplistic orientalist stereotypes&quot;. In 2014, after a production in Seattle, Washington, drew national attention to such criticism, the Gilbert biographer Andrew Crowther wrote that &quot;The Mikado&quot; &quot;does not portray any of the characters as being &#x27;racially inferior&#x27; or indeed fundamentally any different from British people. The point of the opera is to reflect British culture through the lens of an invented &#x27;other&#x27;, a fantasy Japan that has only the most superficial resemblance to reality.&quot; For example, the starting point for the plot of &quot;The Mikado&quot; is &quot;an invented &#x27;Japanese&#x27; law against flirting, which makes sense only as a reference to the sexual prudishness of British culture&quot;. Crowther noted that production design and other features of traditionally staged productions of the opera often &quot;do look somewhat insensitive, not to say insulting. ... It should [be possible] to avoid such things in the future, with a little sensitivity. ... G&amp;S is about silliness, and fun, and ... mocking the powerful, and accepting the fundamental absurdity of life&quot;. Some commentators dismissed the criticism as political correctness but a public discussion of the issue in Seattle a month later drew a large crowd who nearly all agreed that, although works like &quot;The Mikado&quot; should not be abandoned in their traditional form, there should be &quot;some kind of contextualizing apparatus to show that the producers and performers are at least thinking about the problems in the work&quot;.

In 2015 a planned production by the New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players was withdrawn after its publicity materials ignited a similar protest in the Asian-American blogosphere. A Tokyo-based writer who was sympathetic to Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s original setting of the opera later noted: &quot;While as a Japanese residing in Japan I am not offended by the production photos [that offended many Asian-Americans], it is not difficult to imagine how Asian-Americans found the racial cross-dressing unbearable, as it may have reminded them of painful incidents of discrimination that they face as a minority in America.&quot; The company redesigned its &quot;Mikado&quot; production and debuted the new concept in December 2016, receiving a warm review from &quot;The New York Times&quot;. After Lamplighters Music Theatre of San Francisco planned a 2016 production, objections by the Asian-American community prompted them to reset the opera in Renaissance-era Milan, eliminating all references to Japan. Reviewers felt that the change resolved the issue. Among other productions that have experimented with varying the original setting, a 2022 staging by Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Austin, titled &quot;The McAdo&quot;, relocated the action to Scotland. A reviewer from CTX Live Theater praised the adaptation, writing that &quot;The Mikado&quot;″s &quot;story is universalizing and could be set anywhere on the planet in any society&quot;.

===Modernised words and phrases===

Modern productions update some of the words and phrases in &quot;The Mikado&quot;. For example, two songs in the opera use the word &quot;nigger&quot;. In &quot;As some day it may happen&quot;, often called the &quot;list song&quot;, Ko-Ko names &quot;the nigger serenader and the others of his race&quot;. In the Mikado&#x27;s song, &quot;A more humane Mikado&quot;, the lady who modifies her appearance excessively is to be punished by being &quot;blacked like a nigger with permanent walnut juice&quot;. These references are to white performers in blackface minstrel shows, a popular entertainment in the Victorian era, rather than to dark-skinned people. Until well into the 20th century, British people did not consider the word &quot;nigger&quot; offensive. Audience members objected to the word during the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company&#x27;s 1948 American tour, however, and Rupert D&#x27;Oyly Carte asked A. P. Herbert to supply revised wording. These alterations have been incorporated into the opera&#x27;s libretto and score since then.

Also included in the little list song are &quot;the lady novelist&quot; (referring to writers of fluffy romantic novels; these had been lampooned earlier by George Eliot) and &quot;the lady from the provinces who dresses like a guy&quot;, where &quot;guy&quot; refers to the dummy that is part of Guy Fawkes Night, meaning a tasteless woman who dresses like a scarecrow. In the 1908 revival Gilbert allowed substitutions for &quot;the lady novelist&quot;. To avoid distracting the audience with references that have become offensive over time, lyrics are sometimes modified in modern productions. Changes are also often made, especially in the little list song, to take advantage of opportunities for topical jokes. Richard Suart, a singer well known in the role of Ko-Ko, published a book containing a history of rewrites of the little list song, including many of his own.

===Enduring popularity===

As soon as the opera premiered, Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte began to license numerous products that used the opera&#x27;s name, characters, lyrics, lines and designs, not just for licensing fees, but to drive ticket sales; the show &quot;was by far the most successful example [of merchandising] in the 19th century&quot;. &quot;Mikado&quot; trading cards were created that advertised various products. Other &quot;Mikado&quot; products included figurines, fabrics, jewelry, perfumes, puzzles, toothpaste, soap, games, wallpaper, corsets, sewing thread and stoves.

&quot;The Mikado&quot; became the most frequently performed Savoy Opera and has been translated into numerous languages. It is one of the most frequently played musical theatre pieces in history. A feature on Chicago Lyric Opera&#x27;s 2010 production noted that the opera &quot;has been in constant production for the past 125 years&quot;, citing its &quot;inherent humor and tunefulness&quot;.

&quot;The Mikado&quot; has been admired by other composers. Dame Ethel Smyth wrote of Sullivan, &quot;One day he presented me with a copy of the full score of &quot;The Golden Legend&quot;, adding: &#x27;I think this is the best thing I&#x27;ve done, don&#x27;t you?&#x27; and when truth compelled me to say that in my opinion &quot;The Mikado&quot; is his masterpiece, he cried out: &#x27;O you wretch!&#x27; But though he laughed, I could see he was disappointed.&quot;

==Recordings==

===Audio recordings===
&quot;The Mikado&quot; has been recorded more often than any other Gilbert and Sullivan opera. Of those by the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company, the 1926 recording is the best regarded. Of the modern recordings, the 1992 Mackerras/Telarc is admired.

===Films and videos===
A three-minute silent film of a scene from the opera was made in 1902. This was followed in 1906 by a silent film of the opera by Gaumont Film Company. Sound film versions of 12 of the musical numbers from &quot;The Mikado&quot; were produced in Britain and presented as programmes in 1907 titled &quot;Highlights from The Mikado&quot;. Another production was released the same year by the Walturdaw Company, starring George Thorne as Ko-Ko. Both of these programmes used the Cinematophone sound-on-disc system to synchronize phonograph recordings (Phonoscène) of the performers singing and speaking with the silent footage of the performance. The first full-length film of the opera, called &quot;Fan Fan&quot;, was a 1918 silent film with a cast of children; theatres could show the film with live musical accompaniment.

In 1926, the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company made a brief promotional film of excerpts from &quot;The Mikado&quot;. Some of the most famous Savoyards of the day are seen in this film, including Darrell Fancourt as The Mikado, Henry Lytton as Ko-Ko, Leo Sheffield as Pooh-Bah, Elsie Griffin as Yum-Yum, and Bertha Lewis as Katisha.

In 1939, Universal Pictures released a ninety-minute film adaptation of &quot;The Mikado&quot;. Made in Technicolor, the film stars Martyn Green as Ko-Ko, Sydney Granville as Pooh-Bah, the American singer Kenny Baker as Nanki-Poo and Jean Colin as Yum-Yum. Many of the other leads and choristers were or had been members of the D&#x27;Oyly Carte company. The music was conducted by Geoffrey Toye, a former D&#x27;Oyly Carte music director, who was also the producer and was credited with the adaptation, which involved a number of cuts, additions and re-ordered scenes. Victor Schertzinger directed, and William V. Skall received an Academy Award nomination for Best Cinematography. Art direction and costume designs were by Marcel Vertès. There were some revisions – &quot;The Sun Whose Rays Are All Ablaze&quot; is performed twice, first by Nanki-Poo in a new early scene in which he serenades Yum-Yum at her window, and later in the traditional spot. A new prologue which showed Nanki-Poo fleeing in disguise was also added, and much of the Act II music was cut.

In 1966, the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company made a film version of &quot;The Mikado&quot; that closely reflected their traditional staging, although there are some minor cuts. It was filmed on enlarged stage sets rather than on location, much like the 1965 Laurence Olivier &quot;Othello&quot;, and was directed by the same director, Stuart Burge. It stars John Reed, Kenneth Sandford, Valerie Masterson, Philip Potter, Donald Adams, Christene Palmer and Peggy Ann Jones and was conducted by Isidore Godfrey. &quot;The New York Times&quot; criticised the filming technique and the orchestra and noted, &quot;Knowing how fine this cast can be in its proper medium, one regrets the impression this &quot;Mikado&quot; will make on those not fortunate enough to have watched the company in the flesh. The cameras have captured everything about the company&#x27;s acting except its magic.&quot;

Video recordings of &quot;The Mikado&quot; include a 1972 offering from Gilbert and Sullivan for All; the 1982 Brent-Walker film; the well-regarded 1984 Stratford Festival video; and the 1986 English National Opera production (abridged). Opera Australia have released videos of their 1987 and 2011 productions. Since the 1990s, several professional productions have been recorded on video by the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival.

==Other adaptations==
&quot;The Mikado&quot; was adapted as a children&#x27;s book by W. S. Gilbert titled &quot;The Story of The Mikado&quot;, which was Gilbert&#x27;s last literary work. It is a retelling of &quot;The Mikado&quot; with various changes to simplify language or make it more suitable for children. For example, in the &quot;little list&quot; song, the phrase &quot;society offenders&quot; is changed to &quot;inconvenient people&quot;, and the second verse is largely rewritten.
The D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company controlled the copyrights to performances of &quot;The Mikado&quot; and the other Gilbert and Sullivan operas in the U.K. until 1961. It usually required authorised productions to present the music and libretto exactly as shown in the copyrighted editions. Since 1961, Gilbert and Sullivan works have been in the public domain and frequently are adapted and performed in new ways. Notable adaptations have included the following:
* Mikado March (1885) by John Philip Sousa
* &quot;The Jazz Mikado&quot; (1927, Berlin)
* &quot;The Swing Mikado&quot; was an adaptation of &quot;The Mikado&quot; by the Federal Theatre Project with an all-black cast, using swing music and set in the South Pacific, that premiered in Chicago in 1938 and transferred to Broadway.
* &quot;The Hot Mikado&quot; (1939) was a competing Broadway adaptation of &quot;The Mikado&quot; produced by Mike Todd, with an all-black cast, using jazz and swing music.
* Tennessee Ernie Ford, in 1959, broadcast a 30-minute adaptation on his television show; he played Ko-Ko.
* &quot;The Bell Telephone Hour&quot; version (1960) featured Groucho Marx as Ko-Ko, Stanley Holloway as Pooh-Bah, and Helen Traubel as Katisha. It was directed by Martyn Green.
* &quot;The Cool Mikado&quot; is a 1962 British musical film directed by Michael Winner that adapts &quot;The Mikado&quot; in 1960s pop music style and reset as a comic Japanese gangster story.
* &quot;The Black Mikado&quot; (1975) was a jazzy, sexy production set on a Caribbean island.
* The Chichibu production of &quot;The Mikado&quot; by the &quot;Tokyo Theatre Company&quot;
* &quot;Metropolitan Mikado&quot;, a political satire adapted by Ned Sherrin and Alistair Beaton, first performed at Queen Elizabeth Hall (1985) starring Louise Gold, Simon Butteriss, Rosemary Ashe, Robert Meadmore and Martin Smith, produced by Raymond Gubbay.
* &quot;Hot Mikado&quot; (1986) is a jazz and swing style adaptation that premiered in Washington, D.C. and has been played frequently since then.
* Essgee Entertainment produced an adapted version of &quot;The Mikado&quot; in 1995 in Australia and New Zealand.

==In popular culture==

A wide variety of popular media, including films, television, theatre, and advertising have referred to, parodied or pastiched &quot;The Mikado&quot; or its songs, and phrases from the libretto have entered popular usage in the English language. Some of the best-known of these cultural influences are described below.

Quotes from &quot;The Mikado&quot; were used in letters to the police by the Zodiac Killer, who murdered at least five people in the San Francisco Bay area in 1968 and 1969. A second-season (1998) episode of the TV show &quot;Millennium&quot;, titled &quot;The Mikado&quot;, is based on the Zodiac case. &quot;The Mikado&quot; is parodied in &quot;Sumo of the Opera&quot;, which credits Sullivan as the composer of most of its songs. The detective novel &quot;Death at the Opera&quot; (1934) by Gladys Mitchell is set against a background of a production of &quot;The Mikado&quot;. In 2007 the Asian American theatre company Lodestone Theatre Ensemble produced &quot;The Mikado Project&quot;, an original play by Doris Baizley and Ken Narasaki. It was a deconstruction of the opera premised on a fictional Asian American theatre company attempting to raise funds, while grappling with perceived racism in productions of &quot;The Mikado&quot;, by producing a revisionist version of the opera. This was adapted as a film in 2010.
Film and television references to &quot;The Mikado&quot; include the climax of the 1978 film &quot;Foul Play&quot;, which takes place during a performance of &quot;The Mikado&quot;. In the 2010 episode &quot;Robots Versus Wrestlers&quot; of the TV sitcom &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;, at a high-society party, Marshall strikes an antique Chinese gong. The host rebukes him: &quot;Young man, that gong is a 500-year-old relic that hasn&#x27;t been struck since W. S. Gilbert hit it at the London premiere of &quot;The Mikado&quot; in 1885!&quot; Marshall quips, &quot;His wife&#x27;s a 500-year-old relic that hasn&#x27;t been struck since W. S. Gilbert hit it at the London premiere&quot;.
&quot;The Mikado&quot; is a villainous vigilante in the comic book superhero series &quot;The Question&quot;, by Denny O&#x27;Neil and Denys Cowan. He dons a Japanese mask and kills malefactors in appropriate ways – letting &quot;the punishment fit the crime&quot;. In 1888, Ed J. Smith wrote a stage parody of &quot;The Mikado&quot; called &quot;The Capitalist; or, The City of Fort Worth&quot; to encourage capital investment in Fort Worth, Texas. The 2-8-2 railroad locomotive was renamed &quot;The Mikado&quot; when a U.S. production run of these locomotives was shipped to Japan in 1893. Fans even decorated &quot;Mikado&quot; rooms in their homes, &quot;Mikado&quot; clubs were established across America, and in 1886 a Michigan town took the name of the opera.

===Popular phrases from &quot;The Mikado&quot;===
The phrase &quot;A short, sharp shock&quot;, from the Act 1 song &quot;I am so proud&quot; has entered the English language, appearing in titles of books and songs, such as in samples of Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, as well as political manifestos. &quot;Let the punishment fit the crime&quot; is another often-used phrase from the Mikado&#x27;s Act II song and has been mentioned in the course of British political debates. Both concepts predate Gilbert. Examples of later use include episode 80 of the television series &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;, &quot;Let the Punishment Fit the Crime&quot;, which features bits of several songs from &quot;The Mikado&quot;. The phrase and the Mikado&#x27;s song also are featured in the &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; episode &quot;A Soldier&#x27;s Farewell&quot;. In &quot;The Parent Trap&quot; (1961), the camp director quotes the phrase before sentencing the twins to the isolation cabin together. In Season 5, Episode 20 of &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, George quotes the phrase to Jerry after he and his acquaintances saw George&#x27;s girlfriend, Jane, topless.

The name of the character Pooh-Bah to mean a person who holds many titles, often a pompous or self-important person. Pooh-Bah is mentioned in P. G. Wodehouse&#x27;s novel &quot;Something Fresh&quot; and in other, often political, contexts. In December 2009 BBC presenter James Naughtie, on Radio 4&#x27;s Today programme, compared UK cabinet member Peter Mandelson to Pooh-Bah because Mandelson held many offices of state, including Secretary of State for Business, First Secretary of State, Lord President of the Council, President of the Board of Trade, and Church Commissioner, and he sat on 35 cabinet committees and subcommittees. Mandelson replied, &quot;Who is Pooh-Bah?&quot; Mandelson was also described as &quot;the grand Pooh-Bah of British politics&quot; earlier the same week by the theatre critic Charles Spencer of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. In the U.S., particularly, the term has come to describe, mockingly, people who hold impressive titles but whose authority is limited. William Safire speculated that invention of Winnie-the-Pooh by the author A. A. Milne might have been influenced by the character. The term &quot;Grand Poobah&quot; has been used on television shows, including &quot;The Flintstones&quot; and &quot;Happy Days&quot;, and in other media, as the title of a high-ranking official in a men&#x27;s club, spoofing clubs like the Freemasons, the Shriners, and the Elks Club.

===References to songs in &quot;The Mikado&quot;===

Politicians often use phrases from songs in &quot;The Mikado&quot;. For example, Conservative Peter Lilley pastiched &quot;As Someday It May Happen&quot; to specify some groups to whom he objected, including &quot;sponging socialists&quot; and &quot;young ladies who get pregnant just to jump the housing queue&quot;. Comedian Allan Sherman also did a variant on the &quot;Little List&quot; song, presenting reasons one might want to seek psychiatric help, titled &quot;You Need an Analyst&quot;. In a &quot;Eureeka&#x27;s Castle&quot; Christmas special called &quot;Just Put it on the List&quot;, the twins, Bogg and Quagmire, describe what they&#x27;d like for Christmas to the tune of the song. A 2024 piece in &quot;The New Republic&quot; quoted the &quot;little list&quot; song from &quot;The Mikado&quot; and compared Ko-Ko&#x27;s little list to Kash Patel&#x27;s threats to use the F.B.I. and other U.S. government resources to &quot;persecute&quot; Donald Trump&#x27;s &quot;enemies&quot;. Richard Suart and A.S.H. Smyth released a book in 2008 called &quot;They&#x27;d none of &#x27;em be missed,&quot; about the history of &quot;The Mikado&quot; and the 20 years of little list parodies by Suart, the English National Opera&#x27;s usual Ko-Ko. In Isaac Asimov&#x27;s short story &quot;Runaround&quot; a robot recites some of the song.

Other songs in &quot;The Mikado&quot; have been referenced in films, television and other media. For example, the movie poster for &quot;The Little Shop of Horrors&quot; (pictured) parodies the song title &quot;The Flowers that Bloom in the Spring, Tra la!&quot;, changing the word &quot;bloom&quot; to &quot;kill&quot;. In &quot;The Producers&quot;, an auditioner for the musical &quot;Springtime for Hitler&quot; begins his audition with Nanki-Poo&#x27;s song, &quot;A wand&#x27;ring minstrel I&quot;. He is quickly dismissed. In the 2006 film &quot;Brick&quot;, femme fatale Laura (Nora Zehetner) performs a spoken-word version of &quot;The Sun Whose Rays are All Ablaze&quot; while playing piano. In the 1966 &quot;Batman&quot; episode &quot;The Minstrel&#x27;s Shakedown&quot;, the villain identifies himself as &quot;The Minstrel&quot; by singing to the tune of &quot;A wand&#x27;ring minstrel I&quot;. In the &quot;Top Cat&quot; episode &quot;All That Jazz&quot;, Officer Dibble woefully sings the same song. In &quot;Blackadder Goes Forth&quot; a recording of &quot;A Wand&#x27;ring Minstrel I&quot; is played on a gramophone at the beginning of the first episode, and a snatch of the song is also sung by Captain Blackadder in the episode involving &quot;Speckled Jim&quot;. &quot;There Is Beauty in the Bellow of the Blast&quot; is performed by Richard Thompson and Judith Owen on the album &quot;1000 Years of Popular Music&quot;.

The song &quot;Three Little Maids from School Are We&quot; is featured in the 1981 film &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;, where Harold Abrahams first sees his future wife dressed as one of the three little maids. Television programmes that have featured the song include the &quot;Cheers&quot; episode &quot;Simon Says&quot; (for which John Cleese won an Emmy Award), the &quot;Frasier&quot; episode &quot;Leapin&#x27; Lizards&quot;, the &quot;Angel&quot; episode &quot;Hole in the World&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Cape Feare&quot;, &quot;The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody&quot; episode &quot;Lost in Translation&quot;, and &quot;The Animaniacs Vol. 1&quot; episode &quot;Hello Nice Warners&quot;. The Capitol Steps performed a parody titled &quot;Three Little Kurds from School Are We&quot;. On the &quot;Dinah Shore Show&quot;, Shore sang the song with Joan Sutherland and Ella Fitzgerald in 1963.

References to &quot;Tit-Willow&quot; (&quot;On a tree by a river&quot;) have included Allan Sherman&#x27;s comedy song &quot;The Bronx Bird Watcher&quot;, about a Yiddish-accented bird whose beautiful singing leads to a sad end. On &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot;, Groucho Marx and Cavett sang the song. Groucho interrupted the song to quiz the audience on the meaning of the word &quot;obdurate&quot;. A Season 1 episode of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; (aired on 22 November 1976) featured Rowlf the Dog and Sam Eagle singing the song, with Sam clearly embarrassed at having to sing the word &#x27;tit&#x27; (also asking the meaning of &quot;obdurate&quot;). In the film &quot;Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?&quot;, Shelley Winters as the title character sings the song just before she is murdered. In John Betjeman&#x27;s documentary film &quot;Metro-Land&quot; (1973), the song is heard as Betjeman, looking over the lake at Grim&#x27;s Dyke, laments W. S. Gilbert&#x27;s sudden death in 1911.

<doc id="46750" wikidata="Q147267" url="?curid=46750" title="Virginia opossum">
<text>The Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana), also known as the North American opossum, is a member of the opossum family found from southern Canada to northern Costa Rica (making it the northernmost marsupial in the world). Commonly referred to simply as the possum, it is a solitary nocturnal animal about the size of a domestic cat, and a successful opportunist.

Opossums are familiar to many North Americans as they frequently inhabit settled areas near food sources like trash cans, pet food, compost piles, gardens or housemice. Their slow, nocturnal nature and their attraction to roadside carrion make opossums more likely to become roadkill.

==Name==
The Virginia opossum is the original animal named &quot;opossum&quot;, a word which comes from Algonquian &quot;wapathemwa&quot;, meaning &quot;white animal&quot;. Colloquially, the Virginia opossum is frequently just called a &quot;possum&quot;. The term is applied more generally to any of the other marsupials of the families Didelphidae and Caenolestidae. The generic name (&quot;Didelphis&quot;) is derived from Ancient Greek: , &quot;two&quot;, and , &quot;womb&quot;.

The possums of Australia, whose name derives from their similarity to the American species, are also marsupials, but of the order Diprotodontia.

The Virginia opossum is known in Mexico as &quot;tlacuache&quot;, &quot;tacuachi&quot;, and &quot;tlacuachi&quot;, from the Nahuatl word &quot;tlacuatzin&quot;.

==Range==

The Virginia opossum&#x27;s ancestors evolved in South America, but spread into North America as part of the Great American Interchange, which occurred mainly after the formation of the Isthmus of Panama about 3 million years ago. &quot;Didelphis&quot; was apparently one of the later migrants, entering North America about 0.8 million years ago. It is now found throughout Central America and North America from Costa Rica to southern Ontario and is expanding its range northward, northwesterly and northeasterly at a significant pace.

Its pre-European settlement range was generally as far north as Maryland; southern Ohio, Indiana and Illinois; Missouri and Kansas. The clearing of dense forests in these areas and further north by settlers allowed the opossum to move northward. Elimination of the opossum&#x27;s main predators in these areas also contributed to their expansion. Since 1900, it has expanded its range to include most of New England (including Maine); New York, extreme southwestern Quebec; most of southern and eastern Ontario; most of Michigan and Wisconsin; most of Minnesota, southeastern South Dakota and most of Nebraska.

Areas such as Rhode Island and Waterloo Region and Simcoe County in southern Ontario rarely had sightings of opossums in the 1960s, but now have them regularly; some speculate that this is likely due to global warming causing winters to be warmer. Some people speculate the expansion into Ontario mostly occurred by opossums accidentally being transferred across the St. Lawrence, Niagara, Detroit and St. Clair rivers by motor vehicles or trains they may have climbed upon. As the opossum is not adapted to colder winters or heavy snow, its population may be significantly reduced if a colder winter with heavier snow occurs in a particular northern region.

The Virginia opossum was not originally native to the West Coast of the United States. It was intentionally introduced into the West during the Great Depression, probably as a source of food, and now occupies much of the Pacific coast. Its range has been expanding steadily northward into British Columbia.

Small isolated populations of Opossums also occur in Eastern New Mexico and parts of Southern and Central Arizona, particularly around Tucson. It is unknown if these populations are native to these regions or were introduced at some point.

==Description==
Virginia opossums can vary considerably in size, with larger specimens found to the north of the opossum&#x27;s range and smaller specimens in the tropics. They measure long from their snout to the base of the tail, with the tail adding another . Males are slightly larger, with an average body length of with an average tail length of , while females are long with a tail. Weight for males ranges from and for females from .

Their coats are a dull grayish brown, other than on their faces, which are white. Opossums have long, hairless, prehensile tails, which can be used to grab branches and carry small objects. They also have hairless ears and a long, flat nose. Opossums have 50 teeth, more than any other North American land mammal, and opposable, clawless thumbs on their rear limbs. Opossums have 13 nipples, arranged in a circle of 12 with one in the middle.

The dental formula of an opossum is . No other mammal in North America has more than 6 upper incisors, but the Virginia opossum has 10.

Perhaps surprisingly for such a widespread and successful species, the Virginia opossum has one of the lowest encephalization quotients of any marsupial.
Its brain is one-fifth the size of a raccoon&#x27;s.

===Tracks===
Virginia opossum tracks generally show five finger-like toes in both the fore and hind prints. The hind tracks are unusual and distinctive due to the opossum&#x27;s opposable thumb, which generally prints at an angle of 90° or greater to the other fingers (sometimes near 180°). Individual adult tracks generally measure 1.9 in long by 2.0 in wide (4.8 × 5.1 cm) for the fore prints and 2.5 in long by 2.3 in wide (6.4 × 5.7 cm) for the hind prints. Opossums have claws on all fingers fore and hind except on the two thumbs (in the photograph, claw marks show as small holes just beyond the tip of each finger); these generally show in the tracks. In a soft medium, such as the mud in this photograph, the foot pads clearly show (these are the deep, darker areas where the fingers and toes meet the rest of the hand or foot, which have been filled with plant debris by wind due to the advanced age of the tracks).

The tracks in the photograph were made while the opossum was walking with its typical pacing gait. The four aligned toes on the hind print show the approximate direction of travel.

In a pacing gait, the limbs on one side of the body are moved simultaneously, just prior to moving both limbs on the other side of the body. This is illustrated in the pacing diagram, which explains why the left-fore and right-hind tracks are generally found together (and vice versa). If the opossum was not walking (perhaps running), the prints would fall in a different pattern. Other animals that generally employ a pacing gait are raccoons, bears, skunks, badgers, woodchucks, porcupines, and beavers.

When pacing, the opossum&#x27;s &#x27;stride&#x27; generally measures from 7 to 10 in, or 18 to 25 cm (in the pacing diagram the stride is 8.5 in, where one grid square is equal to 1 in2). To determine the stride of a pacing gait, measure from the tip (just beyond the fingers or toes in the direction of travel, disregarding claw marks) of one set of fore/hind tracks to the tip of the next set. By taking careful stride and track-size measurements, one can usually determine what species of animal created a set of tracks, even when individual track details are vague or obscured.

== Behavior ==
=== &quot;Playing possum&quot; ===
If threatened, an opossum will either flee or take a stand. To appear threatening, an opossum will first bare its 50 teeth, snap its jaw, hiss, drool, and stand its fur on end to look bigger. If this does not work, the Virginia opossum is noted for feigning death in response to extreme fear. This is the genesis of the term &quot;playing possum&quot;, which means pretending to be dead or injured with intent to deceive.

In this inactive state it lies limp and motionless on its side, mouth and eyes open, tongue hanging out, and feet clenched. Fear can also cause the opossum to release a green fluid from its anus with a putrid odor that repels predators. Heart rate drops by half, and breathing rate is so slow and shallow it is hardly detectable. Death feigning normally stops when the threat withdraws, and it can last for several hours. Besides discouraging animals that eat live prey, playing possum also convinces some large animals that the opossum is no threat to their young. &quot;Playing possum&quot; in response to threats from oncoming traffic often results in death.

=== Diet ===

Opossums are omnivorous (sometimes said to be insectivorous) and eat a wide range of plant-based food, as well as animal-based food like small invertebrates, carrion, eggs, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, small mammals, and other small animals.

Insects such as grasshoppers, crickets, and beetles make up the bulk of the animal foods eaten by opossums. It has been stated that opossums eat up to 95% of the ticks they encounter and may eat up to 5,000 ticks per season, helping to prevent the spread of tick-born illnesses, including Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. This interpretation has been challenged. A widely publicized 2009 study by the Cary Institute indicated that Virginia opossums in a laboratory setting could eat thousands of ticks per week grooming. However, subsequent studies of the stomach contents of wild Virginia opossums have not found any ticks in their diet.

Small animals include young rabbits, meadow voles, mice, rats, birds, snakes, lizards, frogs, fish, crayfish, gastropods, and earthworms. The Virginia opossum has been found to be very resistant to snake venom. Attracted to carrion on the side of the highway, opossums are at an increased risk of being hit by motor vehicles.

Plant foods are mainly eaten in late summer, autumn, and early winter. These include raspberries, blackberries, apples, acorns, beechnuts, seeds, grains, bulbs, and vegetables. Persimmons are one of the opossum&#x27;s favorite foods during the autumn. Opossums in urban areas scavenge from bird feeders, vegetable gardens, compost piles, garbage cans, and food dishes intended for dogs and cats.

Opossums in captivity are known to engage in cannibalism, though this is probably uncommon in the wild. Because of this, placing an injured opossum in a confined space with its healthy counterparts is inadvisable.

=== Seasonality ===
The Virginia opossum is most active during the spring and summer. It does not hibernate but reduces its activity during the winter. It may not leave its den for several days if the temperature drops below . Both males and females are at greater risk of injury during breeding season. Males extend their range in search of mates which puts them at greater risk of injury from motor vehicles and predators as they venture into unfamiliar territory. Females carrying young are slower moving and have to forage earlier in the evening and later into the night, also increasing their risk of injury from motor vehicles and predation.

===Reproduction===
The breeding season for the Virginia opossum can begin as early as December and continue through October with most young born between February and June. A female opossum may have one to three litters per year. During the mating season, the male attracts the female by making clicking sounds with his mouth. The female&#x27;s estrus cycle is 28 days and lasts 36 hours. Gestation lasts 11–13 days and the average litter size is 8–9 infants, although over 20 infants may be born. Opossums have a very high mortality rate of their young; only one in ten offspring survive to reproductive adulthood.

Newborns are the size of a honeybee. Once delivered through the median vagina or central birth canal, newborn opossums climb up into the female opossum&#x27;s pouch and latch onto one of her 13 teats. The young remain latched for two months and in the pouch for months. The young then climb onto the mother&#x27;s back, where she carries them for the remainder of their time together. It is during this time that the young learn survival skills. They leave their mother after about four or five months.

Like all female marsupials, the female&#x27;s reproductive system is bifid, with two lateral vaginae, uteri, and ovaries. The male&#x27;s penis is also bifid, with two heads, and as is common in New World marsupials, the sperm pair up in the testes and only separate as they come close to the egg. Males have three pairs of Cowper&#x27;s glands.

==Lifespan==
Compared to other mammals, including most other marsupials except dasyuromorphians, opossums have unusually short lifespans for their size and metabolic rate. The Virginia opossum has a maximal lifespan in the wild of only about two years. Even in captivity, opossums live only about four years. The rapid senescence of opossums is thought to reflect the fact that they have few defenses against predators; given that they would have little prospect of living very long regardless, they are not under selective pressure to develop biochemical mechanisms to enable a long lifespan. In support of this hypothesis, one population on Sapelo Island, off the coast of Georgia, which has been isolated for thousands of years without natural predators, was found by Dr. Steven Austad to have evolved lifespans up to 50% longer than those of mainland populations.

==Historical references==
An early description of the opossum comes from explorer John Smith, who wrote in &quot;Map of Virginia, with a Description of the Countrey, the Commodities, People, Government and Religion&quot; in 1608 that &quot;An Opassom hath an head like a Swine, and a taile like a Rat, and is of the bignes of a Cat. Under her belly she hath a bagge, wherein she lodgeth, carrieth, and sucketh her young.&quot;
The opossum was more formally described in 1698 in a published letter entitled &quot;&quot;Carigueya, Seu Marsupiale Americanum Masculum&quot;. Or, The Anatomy of a Male Opossum: In a Letter to Dr Edward Tyson&quot;, from Mr William Cowper, Chirurgeon, and Fellow of the Royal Society, London, by Edward Tyson, M.D. Fellow of the College of Physicians and of the Royal Society. The letter suggests even earlier descriptions.

==Relationship with humans==
Opossums are not considered dangerous to humans. Though their open-mouth hiss when frightened is often mistaken as rabid behavior, opossums are naturally resistant to rabies due to their low body temperature. Opossums can however host parasites and carry diseases such as tuberculosis, leptospirosis, and tularemia, among others. 

Like raccoons, opossums can be found in urban environments, where they eat pet food, rotten fruit, and human garbage. They also are considered a common predator of poultry farming in North America. Research suggests that proximity to humans causes an increase in body size for opossums living in or near urban environments. Though sometimes mistakenly considered to be rats, opossums are not closely related to rodents or any other placental mammals.

The opossum was once a favorite game animal in the United States, particularly in the southern regions which have a large body of recipes and folklore relating to it. Their past wide consumption in regions where present is evidenced by recipes available online and in books such as older editions of &quot;The Joy of Cooking&quot;. A traditional method of preparation is baking, sometimes in a pie or pastry, though at present &quot;possum pie&quot; most often refers to a sweet confection containing no meat of any kind.

Around the turn of the 20th century, the opossum was the subject of numerous songs, including &quot;Carve dat Possum&quot;, a minstrel song written in 1875 by Sam Lucas.

Although it is widely distributed in the United States, the Virginia opossum&#x27;s appearance in folklore and popularity as a food item has tied it closely to the American Southeast. In animation, it is often used to depict uncivilized characters or &quot;hillbillies&quot;. Not surprisingly, then, the Virginia opossum is featured in several episodes of the hit TV show &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;, such as the &quot;Possum Day&quot; episode in 1965. The title character in Walt Kelly&#x27;s long-running comic strip &quot;Pogo&quot; was an opossum. In an attempt to create another icon like the teddy bear, President William Howard Taft was tied to the character Billy Possum. The character did not do well, as public perception of the opossum led to its downfall. In December 2010, a cross-eyed Virginia opossum in Germany&#x27;s Leipzig Zoo named Heidi became an international celebrity. She appeared on a TV talk show to predict the 2011 Oscar winners, similar to the World Cup predictions made previously by Paul the Octopus, also in Germany.

The Perelman Building in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, an annex of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, was formerly the Fidelity Mutual Life Insurance Company Building. Built in the late 1920s its facade is decorated with polychrome sculptures of animals symbolizing various attributes of insurance, including a possum to represent &quot;protection&quot;.

<doc id="46752" wikidata="Q2551936" url="?curid=46752" title="Simon and Garfunkel's Greatest Hits">
<text>Simon and Garfunkel&#x27;s Greatest Hits is the first compilation album from Simon &amp; Garfunkel, which was released on June 14, 1972, two years after Simon &amp; Garfunkel had parted ways.

The album is currently available on CD under Legacy&#x27;s Playlist banner.

==Overview==
The album was a mix of original studio recordings and four previously unreleased live recordings. The album&#x27;s minimalist packaging does not specifically date the latter; however, the live versions of &quot;For Emily, Whenever I May Find Her&quot; and &quot;Kathy&#x27;s Song&quot; included on &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; were also included on the 2008 album &quot;Live 1969&quot;. The liner notes to &quot;Live 1969&quot; state that these two songs were both recorded at a November 1969 concert in St. Louis, Missouri. According to the liner notes from &quot;Collected Works&quot;, however, the version of &quot;Kathy&#x27;s Song&quot; was taken from a 1968 concert in Vermont.

In a 1975 BBC Radio 1 interview, Roy Halee identified this version of &quot;The 59th Street Bridge Song&quot; as being from Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#x27;s 1970 performance at Carnegie Hall, &quot;the last concert they did together&quot; (prior to their disbanding later in 1970). A live version of &quot;Homeward Bound&quot; was also included on the album.

The remaining ten studio songs comprise nine singles released between 1965 and 1972, &quot;America&quot; being issued as a single several years after its appearance as a track on the &quot;Bookends&quot; album, and one album track, &quot;Bookends&quot; (without its parent song &quot;Old Friends&quot;).

All the singles included, except &quot;America,&quot; &quot;El Condor Pasa (If I Could),&quot; and &quot;Scarborough Fair/Canticle&quot; made the Top Ten, with the last peaking at No. 11. &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot; topped the chart aided by its appearance in Mike Nichols&#x27; hit movie &quot;The Graduate&quot;. &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot; and &quot;Bridge over Troubled Water&quot; also peaked at No. 1 as singles in their studio versions, and &quot;The Boxer&quot; peaked as a single at No. 7.

==Reception==

&quot;Simon and Garfunkel&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot; peaked on the U.S. albums chart at No. 5. On the UK Album Chart, it was a No. 2 hit. The album has proven a long and durable seller, currently being certified for 14 million units sold in the U.S. alone. It is easily their best-selling album in the U.S., and holds the record in the U.S. for the best-selling album by a duo.

In 2003, the album was ranked No. 293 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.

<doc id="46754" wikidata="Q583915" url="?curid=46754" title="Sacred geometry">
<text>Sacred geometry ascribes symbolic and sacred meanings to certain geometric shapes and certain geometric proportions. It is associated with the belief of a divine creator of the universal geometer. The geometry used in the design and construction of religious structures such as churches, temples, mosques, religious monuments, altars, and tabernacles has sometimes been considered sacred. The concept applies also to sacred spaces such as temenoi, sacred groves, village greens, pagodas and holy wells, Mandala Gardens and the creation of religious and spiritual art.

==As worldview and cosmology==
The belief that a god created the universe according to a geometric plan has ancient origins. Plutarch attributed the belief to Plato, writing that &quot;Plato said God geometrizes continually&quot; (&quot;Convivialium disputationum&quot;, liber 8,2). In modern times, the mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss adapted this quote, saying &quot;God arithmetizes&quot;.

Johannes Kepler (1571–1630) believed in the geometric underpinnings of the cosmos. Harvard mathematician Shing-Tung Yau expressed a belief in the centrality of geometry in 2010:
&quot;Lest one conclude that geometry is little more than a well-calibrated ruler – and this is no knock against the ruler, which happens to be a technology I admire – geometry is one of the main avenues available to us for probing the universe. Physics and cosmology have been, almost by definition, absolutely crucial for making sense of the universe. Geometry&#x27;s role in this may be less obvious, but is equally vital. I would go so far as to say that geometry not only deserves a place at the table alongside physics and cosmology, but in many ways, it is the table.&quot;

==Natural forms==

According to Stephen Skinner, the study of sacred geometry has its roots in the study of nature, and the mathematical principles at work therein. Many forms observed in nature can be related to geometry; for example, the chambered nautilus grows at a constant rate and so its shell forms a logarithmic spiral to accommodate that growth without changing shape. Also, honeybees construct hexagonal cells to hold their honey. These and other correspondences are sometimes interpreted in terms of sacred geometry and considered to be further proof of the natural significance of geometric forms.

==Representations in art and architecture==
Geometric ratios, and geometric figures were often employed in the designs of ancient Egyptian, ancient Indian, Greek and Roman architecture. Medieval European cathedrals also incorporated symbolic geometry. Indian and Himalayan spiritual communities often constructed temples and fortifications on design plans of mandala and yantra. Mandala Vaatikas or Sacred Gardens were designed using the same principles.

Many of the sacred geometry principles of the human body and of ancient architecture were compiled into the Vitruvian Man drawing by Leonardo da Vinci. The latter drawing was itself based on the much older writings of the Roman architect Vitruvius.

=== In Buddhism ===

Mandalas are made up of a compilation of geometric shapes. In Buddhism, it is made up of concentric circles and squares that are equally placed from the center. Located within the geometric configurations are deities or suggestions of the deity, such as in the form of a symbol. This is because Buddhists believe that deities can actually manifest inside the mandala. Mandalas can be created with a variety of mediums. Tibetan Buddhists create mandalas out of sand that are then ritually destroyed. In order to create the mandala, two lines are first drawn on a predetermined grid. The lines, known as Brahman lines, must overlap at the precisely calculated center of the grid. The mandala is then divided into thirteen equal parts not by a mathematical calculation, but through trial and error. Next, monks purify the grid to prepare it for the constructing of the deities before sand is finally added. Tibetan Buddhists believe that anyone who looks at the mandala will receive positive energy and be blessed. Due to the Buddhist belief in impermanence, the mandala is eventually dismantled and is ritualistically released into the world.

=== In Chinese spiritual traditions ===
One of the cornerstones of Chinese folk religion is the relationship between man and nature. This is epitomized in feng shui, which are architectural principles outlining the design plans of buildings in order to optimize the harmony of man and nature through the movement of &quot;Chi&quot;, or “life-generating energy.” In order to maximize the flow of &quot;Chi&quot; throughout a building, its design plan must utilize specific shapes. Rectangles and squares are considered to be the best shapes to use in feng shui design. This is because other shapes may obstruct the flow of &quot;Chi&quot; from one room to the next due to what are considered to be unnatural angles. Room layout is also an important element, as doors should be proportional to one another and located at appropriate positions throughout the house. Typically, doors are not situated across from one another because it may cause &quot;Chi&quot; to flow too fast from one room to the next.

The Forbidden City is an example of a building that uses sacred geometry through the principles of feng shui in its design plan. It is laid out in the shape of a rectangle that measures over half a mile long and about half a mile wide. Furthermore, the Forbidden City constructed its most important buildings on a central axis. The Hall of Supreme Harmony, which was the Emperor’s throne room, is located at the midpoint or “epicenter” of the central axis. This was done intentionally, as it was meant to show that when the Emperor entered this room, he would be ceremonially transformed into the center of the universe.

===In Islam===

The geometric designs in Islamic art are often built on combinations of repeated squares and circles, which may be overlapped and interlaced, as can arabesques (with which they are often combined), to form intricate and complex patterns, including a wide variety of tessellations. These may constitute the entire decoration, may form a framework for floral or calligraphic embellishments, or may retreat into the background around other motifs. The complexity and variety of patterns used evolved from simple stars and lozenges in the ninth century, through a variety of 6- to 13-point patterns by the 13th century, and finally to include also 14- and 16-point stars in the sixteenth century.

Geometric patterns occur in a variety of forms in Islamic art and architecture including kilim carpets, Persian girih and Moroccan/Algerian zellige tilework, muqarnas decorative vaulting, jali pierced stone screens, ceramics, leather, stained glass, woodwork, and metalwork.

Islamic geometric patterns are used in the Quran, Mosques and even in the calligraphies.

===In Hinduism/Indic Religion===

The Agamas are a collection of Sanskrit, Tamil, and Grantha scriptures chiefly constituting the methods of temple construction and creation of idols, worship means of deities, philosophical doctrines, meditative practices, attainment of sixfold desires, and four kinds of yoga.

Elaborate rules are laid out in the Agamas for Shilpa (the art of sculpture) describing the quality requirements of such matters as the places where temples are to be built, the kinds of image to be installed, the materials from which they are to be made, their dimensions, proportions, air circulation, and lighting in the temple complex. The Manasara and Silpasara are works that deal with these rules. The rituals of daily worship at the temple also follow rules laid out in the Agamas.

Hindu temples, the symbolic representation of cosmic model is then projected onto Hindu temples using the &quot;Vastu Shastra&quot; principle of &quot;Sukha Darshan,&quot; which states that smaller parts of the temple should be self-similar and a replica of the whole. The repetition of these replication parts symbolizes the natural phenomena of fractal patterns found in nature. These patterns make up the exterior of Hindu temples. Each element and detail are proportional to each other, this occurrence is also known as the sacred geometry.
=== In Christianity ===
The construction of Medieval European cathedrals was often based on geometries intended to make the viewer see the world through mathematics, and through this understanding, gain a better understanding of the divine. These churches frequently featured a Latin Cross floor-plan.

At the beginning of the Renaissance in Europe, views shifted to favor simple and regular geometries. The circle in particular became a central and symbolic shape for the base of buildings, as it represented the perfection of nature and the centrality of man&#x27;s place in the universe. The use of the circle and other simple and symmetrical geometric shapes was solidified as a staple of Renaissance sacred architecture in Leon Battista Alberti&#x27;s architectural treatise, which described the ideal church in terms of spiritual geometry.

In the High Middle Ages, leading Christian philosophers explained the layout of the universe in terms of a microcosm analogy. In her book describing the divine visions she witnessed, Hildegard of Bingen explains that she saw an outstretched human figure located within a circular orb. When interpreted by theologians, the human figure was Christ and mankind showing the Earthly realm and the circumference of the circle was a representation of the universe. Some images also show above the universe a depiction of God. This is thought to later have inspired Da Vinci’s &quot;Vitruvian Man&quot;.

Dante uses circles to make up the nine layers of hell categorized in his book, &quot;The&quot; &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;. “Celestial spheres” are also utilized to make up the nine layers of Paradise. He further creates a cosmic order of circular forms that stretches from Jerusalem in the Earthly realm up to God in Heaven. This cosmology is believed to have been inspired by the ancient astronomer Ptolemy.

==Unanchored geometry==
Stephen Skinner criticizes the tendency of some writers to place a geometric diagram over virtually any image of a natural object or human created structure, find some lines intersecting the image and declare it based on sacred geometry. If the geometric diagram does not intersect major physical points in the image, the result is what Skinner calls &quot;unanchored geometry&quot;.

<text>George VI (Albert Frederick Arthur George; 14 December 1895 – 6 February 1952) was King of the United Kingdom and the Dominions of the British Commonwealth from 11 December 1936 until his death in 1952. He was also the last Emperor of India from 1936 until the British Raj was dissolved in August 1947, and the first head of the Commonwealth following the London Declaration of 1949.

The future George VI was born during the reign of his great-grandmother Queen Victoria; he was named Albert at birth after his great-grandfather Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and was known as &quot;Bertie&quot; to his family and close friends. His father ascended the throne as George V in 1910. As the second son of the king, Albert was not expected to inherit the throne. He spent his early life in the shadow of his elder brother, Edward, the heir apparent. Albert attended naval college as a teenager and served in the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force during the First World War. In 1920, he was made Duke of York. He married Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon in 1923, and they had two daughters, Elizabeth and Margaret. In the mid-1920s, he engaged speech therapist Lionel Logue to treat his stutter, which he learned to manage to some degree. His elder brother ascended the throne as Edward VIII after their father died in 1936, but Edward abdicated later that year to marry the twice-divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson. As heir presumptive to Edward VIII, Albert became king, taking the regnal name George VI.

In September 1939, the British Empire and most Commonwealth countries—but not Ireland—declared war on Nazi Germany, following the invasion of Poland. War with the Kingdom of Italy and the Empire of Japan followed in 1940 and 1941, respectively. George VI was seen as sharing the hardships of the common people and his popularity soared. Buckingham Palace was bombed during the Blitz while the King and Queen were there, and his younger brother the Duke of Kent was killed on active service. George became known as a symbol of British determination to win the war. Britain and its allies were victorious in 1945, but the British Empire declined. Ireland had largely broken away, followed by the independence of India and Pakistan in 1947. George relinquished the title of Emperor of India in June 1948 and instead adopted the new title of Head of the Commonwealth. He was beset by smoking-related health problems in the later years of his reign and died at Sandringham House, aged 56, of a coronary thrombosis. He was succeeded by his elder daughter, Elizabeth II.

==Early life==
Albert was born at York Cottage, on the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk, during the reign of his great-grandmother Queen Victoria. His father was Prince George, Duke of York (later King George V), the second and only surviving son of the Prince and Princess of Wales (later King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra). His mother, the Duchess of York (later Queen Mary), was the eldest child and only daughter of Francis, Duke of Teck, and Princess Mary Adelaide, Duchess of Teck. His birthday, 14 December 1895, was the 34th anniversary of the death of his great-grandfather Albert, Prince Consort. Uncertain of how the Prince Consort&#x27;s widow, Queen Victoria, would take the news of the birth, the Prince of Wales wrote to the Duke of York that the Queen had been &quot;rather distressed&quot;. Two days later, he wrote again: &quot;I really think it would gratify her if you yourself proposed the name &quot;Albert&quot; to her.&quot;

The Queen was mollified by the proposal to name the new baby Albert, and wrote to the Duchess of York: &quot;I am all impatience to see the one, born on such a sad day but rather more dear to me, especially as he will be called by that dear name which is a byword for all that is great and good.&quot; Consequently, he was baptised &quot;Albert Frederick Arthur George&quot; at St Mary Magdalene Church, Sandringham on 17 February 1896. Formally he was His Highness Prince Albert of York; within the royal family he was known informally as &quot;Bertie&quot;. The Duchess of Teck did not like the first name her grandson had been given, and she wrote prophetically that she hoped the last name &quot;may supplant the less favoured one&quot;. Albert was fourth in line to the throne at birth, after his grandfather, father and elder brother, Edward.

Albert was ill often and was described as &quot;easily frightened and somewhat prone to tears&quot;. His parents were generally removed from their children&#x27;s day-to-day upbringing, as was the norm in aristocratic families of that era. He had a stutter that lasted for many years. Although naturally left-handed, he was forced to write with his right hand, as was common practice at the time. He had chronic stomach problems as well as knock knees, for which he was forced to wear painful corrective splints.

Queen Victoria died on 22 January 1901, and the Prince of Wales succeeded her as King Edward VII. Prince Albert moved up to third in line to the throne, after his father and elder brother.

==Military career and education==
Beginning in 1909, Albert attended the Royal Naval College, Osborne, as a naval cadet. In 1911 he came bottom of the class in the final examination, but despite this he progressed to the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth. When his grandfather Edward VII died in 1910, his father became King George V. Prince Edward became Prince of Wales, with Albert second in line to the throne.

Albert spent the first six months of 1913 on the training ship in the West Indies and on the east coast of Canada. He was rated as a midshipman aboard on 15 September 1913. He spent three months in the Mediterranean, but never overcame his seasickness. Three weeks after the outbreak of World War I he was medically evacuated from the ship to Aberdeen, where his appendix was removed by John Marnoch. He was mentioned in dispatches for his actions as a turret officer aboard &quot;Collingwood&quot; in the Battle of Jutland (31 May – 1 June 1916), the great naval battle of the war. He did not see further combat, largely because of ill health caused by a duodenal ulcer, for which he had an operation in November 1917.

In February 1918 Albert was appointed Officer in Charge of Boys at the Royal Naval Air Service&#x27;s training establishment at Cranwell. With the establishment of the Royal Air Force Albert transferred from the Royal Navy to the Royal Air Force. He served as Officer Commanding Number 4 Squadron of the Boys&#x27; Wing at Cranwell until August 1918, before reporting for duty on the staff of the RAF&#x27;s Cadet Brigade at St Leonards-on-Sea and then at Shorncliffe. He completed a fortnight&#x27;s training and took command of a squadron on the Cadet Wing. He was the first member of the British royal family to be certified as a fully qualified pilot.

Albert wanted to serve on the Continent while the war was still in progress and welcomed a posting to General Trenchard&#x27;s staff in France. On 23 October, he flew across the Channel to Autigny. For the closing weeks of the war, he served on the staff of the RAF&#x27;s Independent Air Force at its headquarters in Nancy, France. Following the disbanding of the Independent Air Force in November 1918, he remained on the Continent for two months as an RAF staff officer until posted back to Britain. He accompanied King Albert I of Belgium on his triumphal re-entry into Brussels on 22 November. The prince qualified as an RAF pilot on 31 July 1919 and was promoted to squadron leader the following day.

In October 1919, Albert attended Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied history, economics and civics for a year, with the historian R. V. Laurence as his &quot;official mentor&quot;. On 4 June 1920 his father created him Duke of York, Earl of Inverness and Baron Killarney. He began to take on more royal duties. He represented his father and toured coal mines, factories, and railyards. Through such visits he acquired the nickname of the &quot;Industrial Prince&quot;. His stutter, and his embarrassment over it, together with a tendency to shyness, caused him to appear less confident in public than his older brother, Edward. However, he was physically active and enjoyed playing tennis. He played at Wimbledon in the Men&#x27;s Doubles with Louis Greig in 1926, losing in the first round. He developed an interest in working conditions, and was president of the Industrial Welfare Society. His series of annual summer camps for boys between 1921 and 1939 brought together boys from different social backgrounds.

==Marriage==
In a time when royalty were expected to marry fellow royalty, it was unusual that Albert had a great deal of freedom in choosing a prospective wife. An infatuation with the already-married Australian socialite Lady Loughborough came to an end in April 1920 when the King, with the promise of the dukedom of York, persuaded Albert to stop seeing her. That year, he met for the first time since childhood Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, the youngest daughter of the Earl and Countess of Strathmore. He became determined to marry her. Elizabeth rejected his proposal twice, in 1921 and 1922, reportedly because she was reluctant to make the sacrifices necessary to become a member of the royal family. In the words of Lady Strathmore, Albert would be &quot;made or marred&quot; by his choice of wife. After a protracted courtship, Elizabeth agreed to marry him.

Albert and Elizabeth were married on 26 April 1923 in Westminster Abbey. Albert&#x27;s marriage to someone not of royal birth was considered a modernising gesture. The newly formed British Broadcasting Company wished to record and broadcast the event on radio, but the Abbey Chapter vetoed the idea (although the Dean, Herbert Edward Ryle, was in favour).

From December 1924 to April 1925, the Duke and Duchess toured Kenya, Uganda, and the Sudan, travelling via the Suez Canal and Aden. During the trip, they both went big-game hunting.

Because of his stutter, Albert dreaded public speaking. After his closing speech at the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley on 31 October 1925, one which was an ordeal for both him and his listeners, he began to see Lionel Logue, an Australian-born speech therapist. The Duke and Logue practised breathing exercises, and the Duchess rehearsed with him patiently. Subsequently, he was able to speak with less hesitation. With his delivery improved, Albert opened the new Parliament House in Canberra, Australia, during a tour of the empire with his wife in 1927. Their journey by sea to Australia, New Zealand and Fiji took them via Jamaica, where Albert played doubles tennis partnered with a black man, Bertrand Clark, which was unusual at the time and taken locally as a display of equality between races.

The Duke and Duchess had two children: Elizabeth (the future Elizabeth II, called &quot;Lilibet&quot; by the family) who was born in 1926, and Margaret who was born in 1930. The close family lived at White Lodge, Richmond Park, and then at 145 Piccadilly, rather than one of the royal palaces. In 1931, the Canadian prime minister, R. B. Bennett, considered Albert for Governor General of Canada—a proposal that King George V rejected on the advice of the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, J. H. Thomas.

==Reign==
===Reluctant king===
King George V had severe reservations about Prince Edward, saying &quot;After I am dead, the boy will ruin himself in twelve months&quot; and &quot;I pray God that my eldest son will never marry and that nothing will come between Bertie and Lilibet and the throne.&quot; On 20 January 1936, George V died and Edward ascended the throne as King Edward VIII. In the Vigil of the Princes, Prince Albert and his three brothers (the new king, Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, and Prince George, Duke of Kent) took a shift standing guard over their father&#x27;s body as it lay in state, in a closed casket, in Westminster Hall.

As Edward was unmarried and had no children, Albert was the heir presumptive to the throne. Less than a year later, on 11 December 1936, Edward abdicated in order to marry Wallis Simpson, who was divorced from her first husband and divorcing her second. Edward had been advised by British prime minister Stanley Baldwin that he could not remain king and marry a divorced woman with two living ex-husbands. He abdicated and Albert, though he had been reluctant to accept the throne, became king. The day before the abdication, Albert went to London to see his mother, Queen Mary. He wrote in his diary, &quot;When I told her what had happened, I broke down and sobbed like a child.&quot;

On the day of Edward&#x27;s abdication, the Oireachtas, the parliament of the Irish Free State, removed all direct mention of the monarch from the Irish constitution. The next day, it passed the External Relations Act, which gave the monarch limited authority (strictly on the advice of the government) to appoint diplomatic representatives for Ireland and to be involved in the making of foreign treaties. The two acts made the Irish Free State a republic in essence without removing its links to the Commonwealth.

Across Britain, gossip spread that Albert was physically and psychologically incapable of being king. No evidence has been found to support the contemporaneous rumour that the government considered bypassing him, his children and his brother Prince Henry, in favour of their younger brother Prince George, Duke of Kent. This seems to have been suggested on the grounds that Prince George was at that time the only brother with a son.

===Early reign===
Albert assumed the regnal name &quot;George VI&quot; to emphasise continuity with his father and restore confidence in the monarchy. The beginning of George VI&#x27;s reign was taken up by questions surrounding his predecessor and brother, whose titles, style and position were uncertain. He had been introduced as &quot;His Royal Highness Prince Edward&quot; for the abdication broadcast, but George VI felt that by abdicating and renouncing the succession, Edward had lost the right to bear royal titles, including &quot;Royal Highness&quot;. In settling the issue, George&#x27;s first act as king was to confer upon Edward the title &quot;Duke of Windsor&quot; with the style &quot;Royal Highness&quot;, but the letters patent creating the dukedom prevented any wife or children from bearing royal styles. George VI was forced to buy from Edward the royal residences of Balmoral Castle and Sandringham House, as these were private properties and did not pass to him automatically. Three days after his accession, on his 41st birthday, he invested his wife, the new queen consort, with the Order of the Garter.

George VI&#x27;s coronation at Westminster Abbey took place on 12 May 1937, the date previously intended for Edward&#x27;s coronation. In a break with tradition, Queen Mary attended the ceremony in a show of support for her son. There was no Durbar held in Delhi for George VI, as had occurred for his father, as the cost would have been a burden to the Government of India. Rising Indian nationalism made the welcome that the royal party would have received likely to be muted at best, and a prolonged absence from Britain would have been undesirable in the tense period before the Second World War. Two overseas tours were undertaken, to France and to North America, both of which promised greater strategic advantages in the event of war.

The growing likelihood of war in Europe dominated the early reign of George VI. The King was constitutionally bound to support British prime minister Neville Chamberlain&#x27;s appeasement of Hitler. When the King and Queen greeted Chamberlain on his return from negotiating the Munich Agreement in 1938, they invited him to appear on the balcony of Buckingham Palace with them. This public association of the monarchy with a politician was exceptional, as balcony appearances were traditionally restricted to the royal family. While broadly popular among the general public, Chamberlain&#x27;s policy towards Hitler was the subject of some opposition in the House of Commons, which led historian and politician John Grigg to describe George&#x27;s behaviour in associating himself so prominently with a politician as &quot;the most unconstitutional act by a British sovereign in the present century&quot;.

In May and June 1939, the King and Queen toured Canada and the United States; it was the first visit of a reigning British monarch to North America, although George had been to Canada prior to his accession. From Ottawa, George and Elizabeth were accompanied by Canadian prime minister Mackenzie King, to present themselves in North America as King and Queen of Canada. Both Mackenzie King and the Canadian governor general, Lord Tweedsmuir, hoped that George&#x27;s presence in Canada would demonstrate the principles of the Statute of Westminster 1931, which gave full sovereignty to the British Dominions. On 19 May, George personally accepted and approved the letter of credence of the new U.S. ambassador to Canada, Daniel Calhoun Roper; gave royal assent to nine parliamentary bills; and ratified two international treaties with the Great Seal of Canada. The official royal tour historian, Gustave Lanctot, wrote &quot;the Statute of Westminster had assumed full reality&quot; and George gave a speech emphasising &quot;the free and equal association of the nations of the Commonwealth&quot;.

The trip was intended to soften the strong isolationist tendencies among the North American public with regard to the developing tensions in Europe. Although the aim of the tour was mainly political, to shore up Atlantic support for the United Kingdom in any future war, the King and Queen were enthusiastically received by the public. The fear that George would be compared unfavourably to his predecessor was dispelled. They visited the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair and stayed with President Franklin D. Roosevelt at the White House and at his private estate at Hyde Park, New York. A strong bond of friendship was forged between Roosevelt and the royal couple during the tour, which had major significance in the relations between the United States and the United Kingdom through the ensuing war years.

===Second World War===

Following the German invasion of Poland in September 1939, the United Kingdom and the self-governing Dominions other than Ireland declared war on Nazi Germany. The King and Queen resolved to stay in London, despite German bombing raids. They officially stayed in Buckingham Palace throughout the war, although they usually spent nights at Windsor Castle. The first night of the Blitz on London, on 7 September 1940, killed about one thousand civilians, mostly in the East End. On 13 September, the couple narrowly avoided death when two German bombs exploded in a courtyard at Buckingham Palace while they were there. In defiance, the Queen declared: &quot;I am glad we have been bombed. It makes me feel we can look the East End in the face.&quot; The royal family were portrayed as sharing the same dangers and deprivations as the rest of the country. They were subject to British rationing restrictions, and the U.S. first lady Eleanor Roosevelt remarked on the rationed food served and the limited bathwater that was permitted during a stay at the unheated and boarded-up Palace. In August 1942, the King&#x27;s brother, the Duke of Kent, was killed on active service.

In 1940, Winston Churchill replaced Neville Chamberlain as prime minister, though personally George would have preferred to appoint Lord Halifax. After the King&#x27;s initial dismay over Churchill&#x27;s appointment of Lord Beaverbrook to the Cabinet, he and Churchill developed &quot;the closest personal relationship in modern British history between a monarch and a Prime Minister&quot;. Every Tuesday for four and a half years from September 1940, the two men met privately for lunch to discuss the war in secret and with frankness. George related much of what the two discussed in his diary, which is the only extant first-hand account of these conversations.

Throughout the war, George and Elizabeth provided morale-boosting visits throughout the United Kingdom, visiting bomb sites, munitions factories, and troops. George visited military forces abroad in France in December 1939, North Africa and Malta in June 1943, Normandy in June 1944, southern Italy in July 1944, and the Low Countries in October 1944. Their high public profile and apparently indefatigable determination secured their place as symbols of national resistance. At a social function in 1944, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, Field Marshal Alan Brooke, revealed that every time he met Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, he thought Montgomery was after his job. George replied: &quot;You should worry, when I meet him, I always think he&#x27;s after mine!&quot;

In 1945, crowds shouted &quot;We want the King!&quot; in front of Buckingham Palace during the Victory in Europe Day celebrations. In an echo of Chamberlain&#x27;s appearance, the King invited Churchill to appear with the royal family on the balcony to public acclaim. In January 1946, George addressed the United Nations at its first assembly, which was held in London, and reaffirmed &quot;our faith in the equal rights of men and women and of nations great and small&quot;.

===Empire to Commonwealth===
George VI&#x27;s reign saw the acceleration of the dissolution of the British Empire. The Statute of Westminster 1931 had already acknowledged the evolution of the Dominions into separate sovereign states. The process of transformation from an empire to a voluntary association of independent states, known as the Commonwealth, gathered pace after the Second World War. During the ministry of Clement Attlee, British India became the two independent Dominions of India and Pakistan in August 1947. George relinquished the title of Emperor of India, and became King of India and King of Pakistan instead. In late April 1949, the Commonwealth leaders issued the London Declaration, which laid the foundation of the modern Commonwealth and recognised George as Head of the Commonwealth. In January 1950, he ceased to be King of India when it became a republic. He remained King of Pakistan until his death. Other countries left the Commonwealth, such as Burma in January 1948, Palestine (divided between Israel and the Arab states) in May 1948 and the Republic of Ireland in 1949.

In 1947, George and his family toured southern Africa. The prime minister of the Union of South Africa, Jan Smuts, was facing an election and hoped to make political capital out of the visit. George was appalled, however, when instructed by the South African government to shake hands only with whites, and referred to his South African bodyguards as &quot;the Gestapo&quot;. Despite the tour, Smuts lost the election the following year, and the new government instituted a strict policy of racial segregation.

==Illness and death==

The stress of the war had taken its toll on George&#x27;s health, made worse by his heavy smoking, and subsequent development of lung cancer among other ailments, including arteriosclerosis and Buerger&#x27;s disease. A planned tour of Australia and New Zealand was postponed after George developed an arterial blockage in his right leg, which threatened the loss of the leg and was treated with a right lumbar sympathectomy in March 1949. His elder daughter and heir presumptive, Elizabeth, took on more royal duties as her father&#x27;s health deteriorated. The delayed tour was re-organised, with Princess Elizabeth and her husband, Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, taking the place of the King and Queen.

George was well enough to open the Festival of Britain in May 1951, but on 4 June it was announced that he would need immediate and complete rest for the next four weeks, despite the arrival of Haakon VII of Norway the following afternoon for an official visit. On 23 September 1951, his left lung was removed in a surgical operation performed by Clement Price Thomas after a malignant tumour was found. In October 1951, Elizabeth and Philip went on a month-long tour of Canada; the trip had been delayed for a week due to George&#x27;s illness. At the State Opening of Parliament in November, the Lord Chancellor, Lord Simonds, read the King&#x27;s speech from the throne. The King&#x27;s Christmas broadcast of 1951 was recorded in sections, and then edited together.

On 31 January 1952, despite advice from those close to him, George went to London Airport to see Elizabeth and Philip off on their tour to Australia via Kenya. It was his last public appearance. Six days later, at 07:30 GMT on the morning of 6 February, he was found dead in bed at Sandringham House in Norfolk. He had died in the night from a coronary thrombosis at the age of 56. His daughter flew back to Britain from Kenya as Queen Elizabeth II.

From 9 February George&#x27;s coffin rested in St Mary Magdalene Church, Sandringham, before lying in state at Westminster Hall from 11 February. His funeral took place at St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle, on 15 February. He was interred initially in the Royal Vault until he was transferred to the King George VI Memorial Chapel inside St George&#x27;s on 26 March 1969. In 2002, fifty years after his death, the remains of his widow, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, and the ashes of his younger daughter, Princess Margaret, who both died that year, were interred in the chapel alongside him. In 2022, the remains of Queen Elizabeth II and her husband, Prince Philip, were also interred in the chapel.

==Legacy==
In the words of Labour Member of Parliament (MP) George Hardie, the abdication crisis of 1936 did &quot;more for republicanism than fifty years of propaganda&quot;. George VI wrote to his brother Edward that in the aftermath of the abdication he had reluctantly assumed &quot;a rocking throne&quot; and tried &quot;to make it steady again&quot;. He became king at a point when public faith in the monarchy was at a low ebb. During his reign, his people endured the hardships of war, and imperial power was eroded. However, as a dutiful family man and by showing personal courage, he succeeded in restoring the popularity of the monarchy.

The George Cross and the George Medal were founded at the King&#x27;s suggestion during the Second World War to recognise acts of exceptional civilian bravery. He bestowed the George Cross on the entire &quot;island fortress of Malta&quot; in 1943. He was posthumously awarded the Order of Liberation by the French government in 1960, one of only two people (the other being Churchill in 1958) to be awarded the medal after 1946.

Colin Firth won an Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance as George VI in the 2010 film &quot;The King&#x27;s Speech&quot;.
==Titles, honours and arms==

As Duke of York, Albert bore the royal arms of the United Kingdom differenced with a label of three points argent, the centre point bearing an anchor azure—a difference earlier awarded to his father, George V, when he was Duke of York, and then later awarded to his grandson Prince Andrew, Duke of York. As king he bore the royal arms undifferenced.

<doc id="46756" wikidata="Q3179979" url="?curid=46756" title="The Paul Simon Songbook">
<text>The Paul Simon Songbook is the debut solo studio album by Paul Simon. It was released in the UK in 1965. It was made available in the US as part of the LP box set &quot;Paul Simon: Collected Works&quot; (1981). The album was produced by Reginald Warburton and Stanley West as Columbia/CBS Records LP BPG 62579 in the UK; remastered CD Columbia/Legacy/SME CK 90281.

==Background==
&quot;The Paul Simon Songbook&quot; was recorded in London. Simon made several trips to England in 1964 and 1965, performing in small clubs and theaters. During 1965, he played in Paris, Haarlem, and Copenhagen, along with London and other locations in the UK. In 1964, Simon and Art Garfunkel had released the folk-inspired album &quot;Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.&quot; in the US. While Simon was touring and appearing on radio shows in England in 1965 (sometimes with Garfunkel), he began to receive attention from fans. At the time, &quot;Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.&quot; had not yet been released in Britain (and would not be until 1968). Simon&#x27;s other recordings then available in Britain consisted of three 45 rpm singles released on various labels, two of which were rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll-inspired recordings with Garfunkel, under the name Tom &amp; Jerry. The other was representative of his experiments in folk but had been released in 1964 under the pseudonym Paul Kane. He was still under contract to Columbia, so he could record for their British label, CBS Records, and therefore decided to record a set of tracks for release to his folk audience. &quot;The Paul Simon Songbook&quot; was the result.

==Recording and releases==
Simon recorded the album at Levy&#x27;s Recording Studio, 73 New Bond Street, London, over several dates in June 1965. Most of the songs required several takes. He only had one microphone for both his voice and his guitar. Two songs (&quot;The Sound of Silence&quot; and &quot;He Was My Brother&quot;) were re-recordings of songs originally found on &quot;Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.&quot;. Of the remaining songs, all but two (&quot;A Church Is Burning&quot; and &quot;The Side of a Hill&quot;) would be subsequently re-recorded in studio versions by Simon and Garfunkel. The lyrics to &quot;The Side of a Hill&quot; were later reworked by Garfunkel as &quot;Canticle&quot; and sung as counterpoint to &quot;Scarborough Fair&quot; on the duo&#x27;s third album &quot;Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme&quot;. The lyrics to both &quot;The Side of a Hill&quot; and &quot;Canticle&quot; are absent from his 2008 volume &quot;Lyrics 1964–2008&quot;.

The album was released along with the single &quot;I Am a Rock&quot; / &quot;Leaves That Are Green&quot;, CBS 201797.

==Artwork and notes==
Simon&#x27;s 1965 liner notes to the album comment on the songs that &quot;there are some I would not write today&quot;, but that they &quot;played a role in the transition&quot; to his position as a musician at that time.

The album cover shows Simon and his then-girlfriend, Kathy Chitty, sitting on &quot;narrow streets of cobblestone&quot; in London, the city Simon had adopted as his home, and holding wooden figurines. In the 1970s, the album art was altered: the picture of Simon and Chitty was flipped horizontally, and the red script-like lettering eliminated in favor of an album title in white block print at the top.

==Subsequent history==
The album was released in the US by Columbia very briefly in 1969, but was recalled within a few days when Simon objected. It was re-released in 1981 on a Columbia LP in the &quot;Collected Works&quot; boxed set, and in 2004 by Columbia/Legacy on CD. The CD features two bonus tracks, alternative versions of &quot;I Am a Rock&quot; and &quot;A Church Is Burning&quot; which were not part of the 1965 LP release. The mono version was released on CD.

The lyrics for the anti-war song &quot;The Side of a Hill&quot; were incorporated into the Simon &amp; Garfunkel arrangement of &quot;Scarborough Fair/Canticle&quot; on &quot;Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme&quot;.

Later in 1965 and in early 1966, following the success in the US of &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot; as a single, Simon &amp; Garfunkel re-recorded several of the songs featured on &quot;The Paul Simon Songbook&quot; and released them on their albums &quot;Sounds of Silence&quot; and &quot;Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme&quot;.

==Track listing==

* &quot;Paul Kane&quot; was a pseudonym used by Simon at this time, because of his fondness for the film &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;.

<doc id="46757" wikidata="Q252529" url="?curid=46757" title="Black Narcissus">
<text>Black Narcissus is a 1947 British psychological drama film jointly written, directed and produced by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, based on the 1939 novel by Rumer Godden. It stars Deborah Kerr, Sabu, David Farrar, and Flora Robson, and features Esmond Knight, Jean Simmons, and Kathleen Byron.

Set during the final years of British colonial rule in India, the film depicts the growing tensions within a small convent of Anglican sisters who are trying to establish a school and hospital in the old harem of an Indian Raja at the top of an isolated mountain in the Himalayas. The nuns have trouble adapting to the harsh climate and antagonistic population. They come to rely on the help and advice of the Raja&#x27;s British agent, a cynical Englishman whose attractiveness and panache become a source of temptation for the sisters.

&quot;Black Narcissus&quot; received acclaim for its technical mastery, with the cinematographer, Jack Cardiff, winning an Academy Award for Best Cinematography and a Golden Globe Award for Best Cinematography, and Alfred Junge winning an Academy Award for Best Art Direction.

According to film critic David Thomson, &quot;&quot;Black Narcissus&quot; is that rare thing, an erotic English film about the fantasies of nuns, startling whenever Kathleen Byron is involved&quot;.

==Plot==
General Toda Rai, the Rajput ruler of a princely state in the Himalayas, invites an order of Anglican nuns to establish a school and hospital at Mopu, a former harem situated on a high cliff. The ambitious Sister Clodagh is appointed Sister Superior and is sent to Mopu with four other nuns: Sister Philippa for gardening; Sister Briony for the infirmary; Sister Blanche, better known as &quot;Sister Honey&quot;, to teach lace-making; and the emotionally unstable Sister Ruth to teach English and maths. All five women are white Britons in an unfamiliar, colonial setting.

The general&#x27;s British agent, Mr Dean, is sceptical of the project, citing a variety of social and environmental difficulties. He predicts the nuns will leave as soon as the monsoon season ends. It is critical for Clodagh to manage the nuns&#x27; well-being, since the Congregation allows every nun to resign at the end of the year.

The sisters have difficulty adapting to the local population. The native caretaker, Angu Ayah, dislikes sharing the palace with the nuns. The general&#x27;s wealthy uncle has become a Hindu holy man and spends all his time meditating on a mountain within the monastery grounds, refusing to speak to anyone. The sisters agree to mentor Kanchi, a local girl with a reputation for erratic behaviour, but Ayah whips her for stealing.

Each convent member starts to experience ill-health and/or emotional problems caused by their surroundings. Clodagh recalls a failed romance which prompted her to leave Britain and join the order. Ruth grows jealous of Clodagh. Philippa loses herself in the environment and plants the vegetable garden with flowers. Honey&#x27;s attachment to the local children ends disastrously after she gives ineffective medication to a fatally ill baby. The nuns&#x27; failure to save the child&#x27;s life angers the locals, who abandon the mission. Mr Dean encourages Clodagh to leave, but she insists on staying.

The sisters also struggle with their vows of chastity. They are constantly tempted by the old harem&#x27;s erotic wall paintings. In addition, although the sisters planned to educate only girls, they feel compelled to make an exception for the general&#x27;s boy heir, who needs tutoring in Western culture. He soon falls in love with Kanchi. Ruth grows obsessed with the carnally handsome Mr Dean and orders an alluring, modern dress to charm him one day. Although Clodagh is irked by Mr Dean&#x27;s nonchalance and irreverence, she also finds herself increasingly attracted to him. Philippa requests a transfer to a new convent, complaining that to survive in the colonies, &quot;either you must live like Mr Dean, or like the holy man. Either ignore it or give yourself up to it.&quot;

Ruth resigns and announces her intent to go back to Britain. Clodagh visits Ruth to convince her to stay, as the convent is extremely shorthanded. Ruth, who has already changed out of her nun&#x27;s habit into her new dress, defiantly puts on lipstick in front of Clodagh to signal her personal liberation. She escapes the convent and visits Mr Dean&#x27;s house to declare her love, but he rebuffs her advances. Heartbroken, Ruth suffers a mental breakdown and returns to the mission, intent on killing Clodagh. When Clodagh rings the morning service bell, Ruth attempts to push her over the cliff edge. In the ensuing struggle, Ruth falls to her death.

Ruth&#x27;s death is the last straw for the Congregation, which closes the mission. The remaining nuns leave just as the monsoon season begins, even earlier than Mr Dean had originally predicted. Mr Dean meets the caravan to say goodbye. Clodagh and Mr Dean clasp hands and share a meaningful look, but Clodagh gathers herself and continues on her way. She gives him one final request, which he accepts: to tend to Ruth&#x27;s grave.

==Production==
===Development===

&quot;Black Narcissus&quot; was adapted from Rumer Godden&#x27;s 1939 novel of the same name. Michael Powell was introduced to the novel by actress Mary Morris, who had appeared in &quot;The Thief of Bagdad&quot; (1940) and an earlier film where Powell had collaborated with Pressburger, &quot;The Spy in Black&quot; (1939). Godden had adapted her novel for a stage production for Lee Strasberg in the United States, but allowed Pressburger to write his own screenplay adaptation with Powell.

===Casting===
Kathleen Byron was among the first to be cast in the film, in the role of the unstable Sister Ruth. Pressburger described Byron as having a &quot;dreamy voice and great eyes like a lynx&quot;, which he felt appropriate for the mentally disturbed character. Deborah Kerr was cast in the role of the leading Sister Superior, Sister Clodagh. Pressburger chose Kerr for the role despite the reservations of Powell, who felt she was too young for the part. At one point, Powell considered Greta Garbo for the part. Kerr was paid £16,000 for fifty-five days of work.

David Farrar was cast as Mr Dean, the virile British agent who becomes the object of Sister Ruth&#x27;s obsession. Farrar was paid £4,500 for forty-five days of shooting. Flora Robson appears as Sister Philippa, a gardener in the convent.

Of the three principal Indian roles, only the Young General was played by an ethnic Indian, Sabu; the roles of Kanchi, played by Jean Simmons, and the Old General, played by Esmond Knight, were performed by white actors in make-up. Kanchi, 17, is described by Godden as &quot;a basket of fruit, piled high and luscious and ready to eat. Though she looks shyly down, there is something steady and unabashed about her; the fruit is there to be eaten, she does not mean it to rot.&quot; Godden approved of Simmons&#x27;s casting, remarking that she &quot;perfectly fulfilled my description&quot;. The Indian extras were cast from workers at the docks in Rotherhithe.

===Filming===
Filming of &quot;Black Narcissus&quot; began on 16 May 1946, and was completed on 22 August. The film was shot primarily at Pinewood Studios but some scenes were shot in Leonardslee Gardens, West Sussex, the home of an Indian army retiree, which had appropriate trees and plants for the Indian setting. While Powell at the time had been known for his love of location shooting, with &quot;Black Narcissus&quot; he became fascinated with the idea of filming in the studio as much as possible.

The film is known for making extensive use of matte paintings and large-scale landscape paintings (credited to W. Percy Day) to suggest the mountainous environment of the Himalayas, as well as some scale models for motion shots of the convent. Powell said later: &quot;Our mountains were painted on glass. We decided to do the whole thing in the studio and that&#x27;s the way we managed to maintain colour control to the very end. Sometimes in a film its theme or its colour are more important than the plot.&quot;

For the costumes, Alfred Junge, the art director, had three main colour schemes. The sisters were always in the white habits that he designed from a medley of medieval types. These white robes of heavy material stressed the sisters&#x27; other-worldliness amid the exotic native surroundings. The chief native characters were robed in brilliant colours, particularly the generals in jewels and in rich silks. Other native characters brought into the film for &quot;atmosphere&quot; were clad in more sombre colours with the usual native dress of the Nepalese, Bhutanese and Tibetan peoples toned down to prevent overloading the eye with brilliance.

According to Robert Horton, Powell set the climactic sequence, a murder attempt on the cliffs of the cloister, to a pre-existing musical track, staging it as though it were a piece of visual choreography. There was some personal, behind-the-scenes tension, as Kerr was the director&#x27;s ex-lover and Byron his current one. &quot;It was a situation not uncommon in show business, I was told,&quot; Powell later wrote, &quot;but it was new to me.&quot;

The film was intended to end with an additional scene in which Sister Clodagh sobs and blames herself for the convent&#x27;s failure to Mother Dorothea. Mother Dorothea touches and speaks to Sister Clodagh welcomingly as the latter&#x27;s tears continue to fall. When they filmed the scene with the rainfall on the leaves in what was to have been the penultimate scene, Powell was so impressed with it that he decided to designate that as the last scene and to scrap the Mother Dorothea closing scene. It was filmed but it is not known whether it was printed.

==Release==
===Box office===
&quot;Black Narcissus&quot; had its world premiere at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on 24 April 1947 attended by Queen Mary, before opening to the public there the following day and being shown in 20 key cities in the UK within 10 days. According to trade papers, the film was a &quot;notable box office attraction&quot; at British cinemas in 1947. It premiered in the United States on 13 August 1947 in New York City at the Fulton Theatre.

In France, where it was released in 1949, the film sold 1,388,416 tickets. In Japan, it was the fifth top-grossing film of 1950, earning in theatrical rentals.

===Legion of Decency condemnation===
In the United States, the Catholic National Legion of Decency condemned the film as &quot;an affront to religion and religious life&quot; for characterising it as &quot;an escape for the abnormal, the neurotic and the frustrated&quot;. The version of the film originally shown in the United States had scenes depicting flashbacks of Sister Clodagh&#x27;s life before becoming a sister edited out at the behest of the Legion of Decency. The 10 cuts to the film, of about 900 feet of film, were supervised by Pressburger, who commented that the cuts were &quot;reasonable, fair and just&quot;, and that he made them to further the film&#x27;s distribution, as the only bookings it had while on the &quot;condemned&quot; list were in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco. After the cuts were made, the Legion of Decency removed the film from the list, and further bookings were possible.

===Critical response===
&quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; described the film as possessing &quot;good acting and skilfully built-up atmosphere&quot; and praised the cinematography. Philip Scheuer of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; gave the film high praise, deeming it an &quot;exquisite cinematic jewel&quot;, continuing: &quot;I can&#x27;t say how authentic &quot;Black Narcissus&quot; is, but the lotus land to which it carries us is uniquely unforgettable.&quot; Jane Corby of the &quot;Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot; described the film as a &quot;peculiar recital of religious life&quot; and praised the cinematography, but felt that the &quot;mixed atmosphere of religious seclusion and romantic vagaries is very confusing&quot;.

Thomas M. Pryor of &quot;The New York Times&quot; lauded the creative collaboration of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, the writer-director duo, for their notable artistic achievement in &quot;Black Narcissus&quot;. Pryor particularly highlighted the groundbreaking use of Technicolor in the movie, noting its exceptional realism and its ability to create a riveting dramatic impact. He further commended the film&#x27;s adept employment of miniature sets and process shots to authentically evoke the ambience of the Himalayan setting. Pryor found the presentation of the film&#x27;s dramatic elements to be exceptionally well-executed and praised the overall performance of the cast as commendable. Nevertheless, Pryor observed a subtle undercurrent of detachment and cynicism in the portrayal of the nuns within the narrative, acknowledging that this aspect might prove disconcerting to certain viewers.

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 100% based on 38 reviews, with an average rating of 9/10. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 86 based on 15 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Reviewing the film in 2005, Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave it five out of five stars, praising its direction, performances, and production design, and calling it &quot;an all-time top 10 favourite of mine&quot;. In another retrospective review, Tim Dirks of Filmsite called the film &quot;provocative, dazzling and rich-colored&quot;.

====Awards and honours====
===Home media===
The Criterion Collection, an American home media distribution company, released &quot;Black Narcissus&quot; on laserdisc in the early 1990s, and issued it on DVD in 2002. Noel Murray, writing for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, deemed the 2002 DVD as a &quot;crackerjack release&quot;, noting it was a direct copy of the old laserdisc.

In 2008, ITV, the corporate heir to the Rank Organisation&#x27;s General Film Distributors, released a restored version of the film on Blu-ray in the United Kingdom. The Criterion Collection subsequently issued the restored version on DVD and Blu-ray on 20 July 2010. Network Distributing, under licence from ITV, released another Blu-ray edition in the United Kingdom in 2014.

==Historical relevance==
&quot;Black Narcissus&quot; was released only a few months before India achieved independence from Britain in August 1947. Film critic Dave Kehr has suggested that the final images of the film, as the sisters abandon the Himalayas and proceed down the mountain, could have been interpreted by British viewers in 1947 as &quot;a last farewell to their fading empire&quot;; he suggests that for the film-makers, it is not an image of defeat &quot;but of a respectful, rational retreat from something that England never owned nor understood&quot;. The story in the film quite closely follows that of the book, which was published in 1939.

&quot;Black Narcissus&quot; achieved acclaim for its pioneering technical mastery and shocked audiences at the time of release with its vibrant colour and the themes of the film. Audiences gasped at some of the scenes, notably the shot of the pink flowers which, shown on the big screen, was a spectacle at the time. The film&#x27;s lighting and techniques have had a profound impact on later film makers, notably Martin Scorsese who used the extreme close-ups of the sisters as the inspiration for the treatment of Tom Cruise&#x27;s character around the pool table in &quot;The Color of Money&quot;. Scorsese has said that the film, particularly in its last quarter, is one of the earliest erotic films. The film was one of his favourites as a boy and one of the greatest experiences he has had with film is viewing &quot;Black Narcissus&quot; projected on a massive screen at the Directors Guild in 1983. In Michael Powell&#x27;s own view, this was the most erotic film he ever made. &quot;It is all done by suggestion, but eroticism is in every frame and image from beginning to end. It is a film full of wonderful performances and passion just below the surface, which finally, at the end of the film, erupts.&quot; The English film critic Peter Bradshaw, who put it on his list of the ten best films ever made, took Powell&#x27;s statement further, and said that it was the most erotic film he had ever seen.

In &quot;The Great British Picture Show&quot;, the writer George Perry stated, &quot;[Powell and Pressburger&#x27;s] films looked better than they were – the location photography in Technicolor by Jack Cardiff in &quot;Black Narcissus&quot; was a great deal better than the story and lifted the film above the threatening banality.&quot; In contrast, the critic Ian Christie wrote in the &quot;Radio Times&quot; in the 1980s that &quot;unusually for a British film from the emotionally frozen forties the melodrama works so well it almost seems as if Powell and Pressburger survived the slings and barbs of contemporary criticism to find their ideal audience in the 1980s&quot;. Marina Warner, introducing the film on BBC2 (on a nun-themed film evening, with &quot;Thérèse&quot;), called it a masterpiece.

The film&#x27;s resonance with populations exploring previously stifled sexual desires and expression extends beyond its contemporary milieu of women in the post-war era. &quot;Black Narcissus&quot; also influenced the themes and aesthetic of the ground-breaking gay experimental film &quot;Pink Narcissus&quot;, which portrays a series of pornographic vignettes in vivid colour as the fantasies of a prostitute between visits from his keeper. Although &quot;Pink Narcissus&quot; was lost in obscurity for some time, in recent years it has resurfaced as a cult classic, due in part to the vivid, fantastical aesthetic inspired by &quot;Black Narcissus&quot;.

The look and cinematography of the 2013 Disney film &quot;Frozen&quot; was influenced by &quot;Black Narcissus&quot;. While working on the look and nature of the film&#x27;s cinematography, &quot;Frozen&quot; art director Michael Giaimo was greatly influenced by Jack Cardiff&#x27;s work in &quot;Black Narcissus&quot;.

<text>Philip Edward Thomas (3 March 1878 – 9 April 1917) was a British writer of poetry and prose. He is sometimes considered a war poet, although few of his poems deal directly with his war experiences. He only started writing poetry at the age of 36, but by that time he had already been a prolific critic, biographer, nature writer and travel writer for two decades. In 1915, he enlisted in the British Army to fight in the First World War and was killed in action during the Battle of Arras in 1917, soon after he arrived in France.

==Life and career as a soldier==
===Background and early life===

Edward Thomas was the son of Mary Elizabeth Townsend and Philip Henry Thomas, a civil servant, author, preacher and local politician. He was born in Lambeth, an area of present-day south London, previously in Surrey. He was educated at Belleville School, Battersea Grammar School and St Paul&#x27;s School, all in London.

Thomas&#x27;s family were mostly Welsh. Of his six great-grandparents for whom information has been found, five were born in Wales, and one in Ilfracombe. All four of his grandparents had been born and brought up in Wales. Of these, his paternal grandparents lived in Tredegar. His grandmother, Rachel Phillips, had been born and brought up there, whilst his grandfather, Henry Thomas, who&#x27;d been born in Neath, worked there as a collier and then an engine fitter. Their son, Philip Henry, who was Edward Thomas&#x27;s father, had been born in Tredegar and spent his early years there.

Thomas&#x27;s maternal grandfather was Edward Thomas Townsend, the son of Margaret and Alderman William Townsend, a Newport merchant active in Liberal and Chartist politics. His maternal grandmother was Catherine Marendaz, from Margam, just outside Port Talbot, where her family had been tenant farmers since at least the late 1790s. Their daughter, Mary Elizabeth Townsend, married Philip Henry Thomas. Mary and Philip were Edward Thomas&#x27;s parents.

Although Edward Thomas&#x27;s father, Philip Henry Thomas, had left Tredegar for Swindon (and then London) in his early teens, “the Welsh connection was … enduring.” He continued throughout his life to visit his relatives in south Wales. His feelings for Wales were also manifest in other ways. There were frequent journeys to Merthyr to lecture on behalf of the Ethical Society, and even a visit in 1906 to a National Eisteddfod in north Wales. Philip Henry Thomas “cultivated his Welsh connections assiduously,” so much so that Edward Thomas and his brothers could even boast that their father knew Lloyd George.

Like his father before him, Edward Thomas continued throughout his life to visit his many relatives and friends in Ammanford, Newport, Swansea and Pontardulais. Thomas also enjoyed a twenty-year friendship with a distant cousin, the teacher, theologian and poet, John Jenkins (Gwili), of the Hendy, just across the county border from Pontardulais. Gwili’s elegy for Thomas describes the many walks they took together in the countryside around Pontardulais and Ammanford. Such was the family’s connection to this part of Wales that three of Edward Thomas&#x27;s brothers were sent to school at Watcyn Wyn’s Academy in Ammanford, where Gwili had become headmaster in 1908.

===From Oxford to Adlestrop===

Between 1898 and 1900, Thomas was a history scholar at Lincoln College, Oxford. In June 1899, he married Helen Berenice Noble (1877–1967) in Fulham, while still an undergraduate, and determined to live his life by the pen. He then worked as a book reviewer, reviewing up to 15 books every week. He was already a seasoned writer by the outbreak of war, having published widely as a literary critic and biographer as well as writing about the countryside. He also wrote a novel, &quot;The Happy-Go-Lucky Morgans&quot; (1913), a &quot;book of delightful disorder&quot;.

Thomas worked as literary critic for the &quot;Daily Chronicle&quot; in London and became a close friend of Welsh tramp poet W. H. Davies, whose career he almost single-handedly developed. From 1905 until 1906, Thomas lived with his wife Helen and their two children at Elses Farm near Sevenoaks, Kent. He rented a tiny cottage nearby to Davies, and nurtured his writing as best he could. On one occasion, Thomas arranged for the manufacture, by a local wheelwright, of a makeshift wooden leg for Davies.

In 1906 the family moved to Steep, East Hampshire, on the outskirts of the market town of Petersfield - attracted by the landscape, its links with London, and schooling at the innovative co-educational private school Bedales. They lived in and around Steep in three separate homes for ten years until 1916 when they moved to Essex following Thomas&#x27;s enlistment. Their third child, Myfanwy, was born in August 1910.

Even though Thomas thought that poetry was the highest form of literature and regularly reviewed it, he only became a poet himself at the end of 1914 when living at Steep, and initially published his poetry under the name Edward Eastaway. The American poet Robert Frost, who was living in England at the time, in particular encouraged Thomas (then more famous as a critic) to write poetry, and their friendship was so close that the two planned to reside side by side in the United States. Frost&#x27;s most famous poem, &quot;The Road Not Taken&quot;, was inspired by walks with Thomas and Thomas&#x27;s indecisiveness about which route to take.

By August 1914, the village of Dymock in Gloucestershire had become the residence of a number of literary figures, including Lascelles Abercrombie, Wilfrid Gibson and Robert Frost. Edward Thomas was a visitor at this time.

Thomas immortalised the (now-abandoned) railway station at Adlestrop in a poem of that name after his train made a stop at the Cotswolds station on 24 June 1914, shortly before the outbreak of the First World War.

===War service===

Thomas enlisted in the Artists Rifles in July 1915, despite being a mature married man who could have avoided enlisting. He was unintentionally influenced in this decision by his friend Frost, who had returned to the U.S. but sent Thomas an advance copy of &quot;The Road Not Taken&quot;. The poem was intended by Frost as a gentle mocking of indecision, particularly the indecision that Thomas had shown on their many walks together; however, most took the poem more seriously than Frost intended, and Thomas similarly took it seriously and personally, and it provided the last straw in Thomas&#x27;s decision to enlist.

Thomas&#x27;s training was at a temporary army camp at High Beach in Epping Forest. Despite the squalid conditions in the camp, he enjoyed the forest and in the following year moved with his family to a nearby cottage. One of his last poems, &quot;Out in the dark&quot;, was written at High Beach at Christmas 1916.

Thomas was promoted to corporal, and in November 1916 was commissioned into the Royal Garrison Artillery as a second lieutenant. He was killed in action soon after he arrived in France at Arras on Easter Monday, 9 April 1917. To spare the feelings of his widow Helen, she was told the fiction of a &quot;bloodless death&quot; i.e. that Thomas was killed by the concussive blast wave of one of the last shells fired as he stood to light his pipe and that there was no mark on his body. However, a letter from his commanding officer Franklin Lushington written in 1936 (and discovered many years later in an American archive) states that in reality the cause of Thomas&#x27;s death was being &quot;shot clean through the chest&quot;. W. H. Davies was devastated by the death and his commemorative poem &quot;Killed in Action (Edward Thomas)&quot; was included in Davies&#x27;s 1918 collection &quot;Raptures&quot;.

Thomas is buried in the Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery at Agny in France (Row C, Grave 43).

===Personal life===
Thomas and his wife Helen had three children: a son, Merfyn, and daughters Bronwen and Myfanwy. After the war, Helen wrote about her courtship and early married life with Edward in the autobiography &quot;As it Was&quot; (1926); a second volume, &quot;World Without End&quot; was published in 1931. Myfanwy later said that the books had been written by her mother as a form of therapy to help lift herself from the deep depression into which she had fallen following Thomas&#x27;s death.

Helen&#x27;s short memoir &quot;A Memory of W. H. Davies&quot; was published in 1973, after her own death. In 1988, Helen&#x27;s writings were gathered into a book published under the title &quot;Under Storm&#x27;s Wing&quot;, which included &quot;As It Was&quot; and &quot;World Without End&quot; as well as a selection of other short works by Helen and her daughter Myfanwy and six letters sent by Robert Frost to her husband. Myfanwy Thomas, only six when her father died, produced her own memoir of Edward and Helen, &quot;One of These Fine Days&quot;, in 1982.

==Poetry==

Thomas&#x27;s poems are written in a colloquial style and frequently feature the English countryside. The short poem &quot;In Memoriam&quot; exemplifies how his poetry blends the themes of war and the countryside. On 11 November 1985, Thomas was among 16 Great War poets commemorated on a slate stone unveiled in Westminster Abbey&#x27;s Poet&#x27;s Corner. The inscription, written by fellow poet Wilfred Owen, reads: &quot;My subject is War, and the pity of War. The Poetry is in the pity.&quot; Thomas was described by British Poet Laureate Ted Hughes as &quot;the father of us all.&quot; Poet Laureate Andrew Motion has said that Thomas occupies &quot;a crucial place in the development of twentieth-century poetry&quot; for introducing a modern sensibility, later found in the work of such poets as W. H. Auden and Ted Hughes, to the poetic subjects of Victorian and Georgian poetry.

At least nineteen of his poems were set to music by the Gloucester composer Ivor Gurney.

==Legacy==
===Commemorations===

Thomas is commemorated in Poets&#x27; Corner, Westminster Abbey, London, by memorial windows in the churches at Steep and at Eastbury in Berkshire, a blue plaque at 14 Lansdowne Gardens in Stockwell, south London, where he was born and a London County Council plaque at 61 Shelgate Road SW11. The Edward Thomas Fellowship was founded in 1980 and aims to perpetuate the memory of Edward Thomas and foster interest in his life and works.

A plaque is dedicated to him at 113 Cowley Road, Oxford, where he lodged before entering Lincoln College, as well as featuring on the memorial board in the JCR of Lincoln College.

East Hampshire District Council have created a &quot;literary walk&quot; at Shoulder of Mutton Hill in Steep dedicated to Thomas, which includes a memorial stone erected in 1935. The inscription includes the final line from one of his essays: &quot;And I rose up and knew I was tired and I continued my journey.&quot;

As &quot;Philip Edward Thomas poet-soldier&quot; he is commemorated, alongside &quot;Reginald Townsend Thomas actor-soldier died 1918&quot;, who is buried at the spot, and other family members, at the North East Surrey (Old Battersea) Cemetery.

A Study Centre dedicated to Edward Thomas, featuring more than 1,800 books by or about him collected by the late Tim Wilton-Steer, has been opened in Petersfield Museum. Access to the Study Centre is available by prior appointment.

===Writing about Thomas===
In 1918 W. H. Davies published his poem &quot;Killed in Action (Edward Thomas)&quot; to mark the personal loss of his close friend and mentor. Many poems about Thomas by other poets can be found in the books &quot;Elected Friends: Poems For and About Edward Thomas&quot;, (1997, Enitharmon Press) edited by Anne Harvey, and &quot;Branch-Lines: Edward Thomas and Contemporary Poetry&quot;, (2007, Enitharmon Press) edited by Guy Cuthbertson and Lucy Newlyn. Eleanor Farjeon was a close friend of Thomas and after his death remained close to his wife. From her correspondence she constructed her 1958 memoir &quot;Edward Thomas: The Last Four Years&quot;. Robert MacFarlane, in his 2012 book &quot;The Old Ways&quot;, critiques Thomas and his poetry in the context of his own explorations of paths and walking as an analogue of human consciousness. The last years of Thomas&#x27;s life are explored in &quot;A Conscious Englishman&quot;, a 2013 biographical novel by Margaret Keeping, published by StreetBooks. Thomas is the subject of the biographical play &quot;The Dark Earth and the Light Sky&quot; by Nick Dear (2012).

===Sculpture===

In December 2017 National Museum Cardiff displayed a sculptural installation by the Herefordshire artist Claire Malet depicting a holloway and incorporating a copy of Thomas&#x27;s &quot;Collected Poems&quot;, open at &#x27;Roads&#x27;:

:Crowding the solitude
:Of the loops over the downs,
:Hushing the roar of towns
:And their brief multitude.

<doc id="46760" wikidata="Q323750" url="?curid=46760" title="Terra Australis">
<text> (Latin: ) was a hypothetical continent first posited in antiquity and which appeared on maps between the 15th and 18th centuries. Its existence was not based on any survey or direct observation, but rather on the idea that continental land in the Northern Hemisphere should be balanced by land in the Southern Hemisphere. This theory of balancing land has been documented as early as the 5th century on maps by Macrobius, who used the term &quot;&quot; on his maps.

==Names==
Other names for the hypothetical continent have included &quot;Terra Australis Ignota&quot;, &quot;Terra Australis Incognita&quot; (&quot;the unknown land of the south&quot;) or &quot;Terra Australis Nondum Cognita&quot; (&quot;the southern land not yet known&quot;). Other names were &quot;Brasiliae Australis&quot; (&quot;the southern Brazil&quot;), and &quot;Magellanica&quot; (&quot;the land of Magellan&quot;). Matthias Ringmann called it the &quot;Ora antarctica&quot; (antarctic land) in 1505, and Franciscus Monachus called it the &quot;Australis orę&quot; (Austral country). In medieval times it was known as the Antipodes.

The French writer Guillaume Postel proposed the name &quot;Chasdia&quot;, after Noah&#x27;s grandson Cush, for the hypothetical continent on the basis of it having dark-skinned inhabitants (Cush&#x27;s traditional descendants).

==Change of name==
During the 18th century, today&#x27;s Australia was not conflated with &quot;Terra Australis&quot;, as it sometimes was in the 20th century. Captain Cook and his contemporaries knew that the sixth continent (today&#x27;s Australia), which they called &quot;New Holland&quot;, was entirely separate from the imagined (but still undiscovered) seventh continent (today&#x27;s Antarctica).

In the 19th century, the colonial authorities in Sydney re-allocated the name &quot;Australia&quot; to New Holland and its centuries-old Dutch name eventually disappeared. Meanwhile, having lost its name of &quot;Australia&quot;, the south polar continent was nameless for decades until &quot;Antarctica&quot; was coined in the 1890s.

In the early 19th century, British explorer Matthew Flinders popularized the naming of Australia after &quot;Terra Australis&quot;, giving his rationale that there was &quot;no probability&quot; of finding any significant land mass anywhere more south than Australia. The continent that would come to be named Antarctica would be explored decades after Flinders&#x27; 1814 book on Australia, which he had titled &quot;A Voyage to Terra Australis&quot;, and after his naming switch had gained popularity.

==History==

===Origins===

In the fourth century B.C. Aristotle hypothesized that the continents of the northern hemisphere must be balanced out by an unknown landmass in the southern hemisphere.

Ptolemy (2nd century AD) believed that the Indian Ocean was enclosed on the south by land, and that the lands of the Northern Hemisphere should be balanced by land in the south. Marcus Tullius Cicero used the term &quot;cingulus australis&quot; (&quot;southern zone&quot;) in referring to the Antipodes in &quot;Somnium Scipionis&quot; (&quot;Dream of Scipio&quot;). The land (&quot;terra&quot; in Latin) in this zone was the &quot;Terra Australis&quot;.


Legends of &quot;Terra Australis Incognita&quot;an &quot;unknown land of the South&quot;date back to Roman times and before, and were commonplace in medieval geography, although not based on any documented knowledge of the continent. Ptolemy&#x27;s maps, which became well known in Europe during the Renaissance, did not actually depict such a continent, but they did show an Africa which had no southern oceanic boundary (and which therefore might extend all the way to the South Pole), and also raised the possibility that the Indian Ocean was entirely enclosed by land. Christian thinkers did not discount the idea that there might be land beyond the southern seas, but the issue of whether it could be inhabited was controversial.

The first depiction of &quot;Terra Australis&quot; on a globe was probably on Johannes Schöner&#x27;s lost 1523 globe on which Oronce Fine is thought to have based his 1531 double cordiform (heart-shaped) map of the world. On this landmass he wrote &quot;recently discovered but not yet completely explored&quot;. The body of water beyond the tip of South America is called the &quot;Mare Magellanicum&quot;, one of the first uses of navigator Ferdinand Magellan&#x27;s name in such a context.

Schöner called the continent &quot;Brasiliae Australis&quot; in his 1533 tract, &quot;Opusculum geographicum&quot;. In it, he explained: Brasilia Australis is an immense region toward Antarcticum, newly discovered but not yet fully surveyed, which extends as far as Melacha and somewhat beyond. The inhabitants of this region lead good, honest lives and are not Anthropophagi [cannibals] like other barbarian nations; they have no letters, nor do they have kings, but they venerate their elders and offer them obedience; they give the name Thomas to their children [after St Thomas the Apostle]; close to this region lies the great island of Zanzibar at 102.00 degrees and 27.30 degrees South.

===Mapping the southern continent===

==== Medieval period ====
During medieval times &quot;Terra Australis&quot; was known by a different name, that being the Antipodes. First widely introduced to medieval western Europe by Isidore of Seville in his famous book the &quot;Etymologiae&quot;, the idea gained popularity across Europe, and most scholars did not question its existence, instead debating if it was habitable for other humans. It would later be included on some zonal Mappa mundi and intrigue medieval scholars for centuries.

====16th century====

Explorers of the Age of Discovery, from the late 15th century on, proved that Africa was almost entirely surrounded by sea, and that the Indian Ocean was accessible from both west and east. These discoveries reduced the area where the continent could be found; however, many cartographers held to Aristotle&#x27;s opinion. Scientists such as Gerardus Mercator (1569) and Alexander Dalrymple as late as 1767 argued for its existence, with such arguments as that there should be a large landmass in the south as a counterweight to the known landmasses in the Northern Hemisphere. As new lands were discovered, they were often assumed to be parts of the hypothetical continent.

The German cosmographer and mathematician Johannes Schöner (1477–1547) constructed a terrestrial globe in 1515, based on the world map and globe made by Martin Waldseemüller and his colleagues at St. Dié in Lorraine in 1507. Where Schöner departs most conspicuously from Waldseemüller is in his globe&#x27;s depiction of an Antarctic continent, called by him Brasilie Regio. His continent is based, however tenuously, on the report of an actual voyage: that of the Portuguese merchants Nuno Manuel and Cristóvão de Haro to the River Plate, and related in the &quot;Newe Zeytung auss Presillg Landt&quot; (&quot;New Tidings from the Land of Brazil&quot;) published in Augsburg in 1514. The &quot;Zeytung&quot; described the Portuguese voyagers passing through a strait between the southernmost point of America, or Brazil, and a land to the south west, referred to as &quot;vndtere Presill&quot; (or &quot;Brasilia inferior&quot;).

This supposed &quot;strait&quot; was in fact the Rio de la Plata (or the San Matias Gulf). By &quot;vndtere Presill&quot;, the Zeytung meant that part of Brazil in the lower latitudes, but Schöner mistook it to mean the land on the southern side of the &quot;strait&quot;, in higher latitudes, and so gave to it the opposite meaning. On this slender foundation he constructed his circum-Antarctic continent to which, for the reasons that he does not explain, he gave an annular, or ring shape. In an accompanying explanatory treatise, &quot;Luculentissima quaedam terrae totius descriptio&quot; (&quot;A Most Lucid Description of All Lands&quot;), he explained:The Portuguese, thus, sailed around this region, the Brasilie Regio, and discovered the passage very similar to that of our Europe (where we reside) and situated laterally between east and west. From one side the land on the other is visible; and the cape of this region about away, much as if one were sailing eastward through the Straits of Gibraltar or Seville and Barbary or Morocco in Africa, as our Globe shows toward the Antarctic Pole. Further, the distance is only moderate from this Region of Brazil to Malacca, where St. Thomas was crowned with martyrdom.

On this scrap of information, united with the concept of the Antipodes inherited from Graeco-Roman antiquity, Schöner constructed his representation of the southern continent. His strait served as inspiration for Ferdinand Magellan&#x27;s expedition to reach the Moluccas by a westward route.

He took Magellan&#x27;s discovery of Tierra del Fuego in 1520 as further confirmation of its existence, and on his globes of 1523 and 1533 he described it as &quot;terra australis recenter inventa sed nondum plene cognita&quot; (&quot;Terra Australis, recently discovered but not yet fully known&quot;). It was taken up by his followers, the French cosmographer Oronce Fine in his world map of 1531, and the Flemish cartographers Gerardus Mercator in 1538 and Abraham Ortelius in 1570. Schöner&#x27;s concepts influenced the Dieppe school of mapmakers, notably in their representation of Jave la Grande.

In 1539, the King of Spain, Charles V, created the Governorate of Terra Australis granted to Pedro Sancho de la Hoz, who in 1540 transferred the title to the conqueror Pedro de Valdivia and later was incorporated to Chile.
&quot;Terra Australis&quot; was depicted on the mid-16th-century Dieppe maps, where its coastline appeared just south of the islands of the East Indies; it was often elaborately charted, with a wealth of fictitious detail. There was much interest in &quot;Terra Australis&quot; among Norman and Breton merchants at that time. In 1566 and 1570, Francisque and André d&#x27;Albaigne presented Gaspard de Coligny, Admiral of France, with projects for establishing relations with the Austral lands. Although the Admiral gave favourable consideration to these initiatives, they came to nought when Coligny was killed in 1572.


Gerardus Mercator believed in the existence of a large Southern continent on the basis of cosmographic reasoning, set out in the abstract of his &quot;Atlas or Cosmographic Studies in Five Books,&quot; as related by his biographer, Walter Ghim, who said that even though Mercator was not ignorant that the Austral continent still lay hidden and unknown, he believed it could be &quot;demonstrated and proved by solid reasons and arguments to yield in its geometric proportions, size and weight, and importance to neither of the other two, nor possibly to be lesser or smaller, otherwise the constitution of the world could not hold together at its centre&quot;.

The Flemish geographer and cartographer, Cornelius Wytfliet, wrote concerning the &quot;Terra Australis&quot; in his 1597 book, &quot;Descriptionis Ptolemaicae Augmentum&quot;: 
The terra Australis is therefore the southernmost of all other lands, directly beneath the antarctic circle; extending beyond the tropic of Capricorn to the West, it ends almost at the equator itself, and separated by a narrow strait lies on the East opposite to New Guinea, only known so far by a few shores because after one voyage and another that route has been given up and unless sailors are forced and driven by stress of winds it is seldom visited. The terra Australis begins at two or three degrees below the equator and it is said by some to be of such magnitude that if at any time it is fully discovered they think it will be the fifth part of the world.

Adjoining Guinea on the right are the numerous and vast Solomon Islands which lately became famous by the voyage of Alvarus Mendanius.

Juan Fernandez, sailing from Chile in 1576, claimed he had discovered the Southern Continent. The &quot;Polus Antarcticus&quot; map of 1641 by Henricus Hondius, bears the inscription: &quot;&quot;Insulas esse a Nova Guinea usque ad Fretum Magellanicum affirmat Hernandus Galego, qui ad eas explorandas missus fuit a Rege Hispaniae Anno 1576&quot; (Hernando Gallego, who in the year 1576 was sent by the King of Spain to explore them, affirms that there are islands from New Guinea up to the Strait of Magellan)&quot;.

====17th century====
Luís Vaz de Torres, a Spanish navigator who commanded the &quot;San Pedro y San Pablo&quot;, the &quot;San Pedrico&quot; and the tender or yacht, &quot;Los Tres Reyes Magos&quot; during the 1605–1606 expedition led by Pedro Fernandes de Queiros in quest of the Southern Continent, proved the existence of a passage south of New Guinea, now known as Torres Strait. Commenting on this in 1622, the Dutch cartographer and publisher of Queiros&#x27; eighth memorial, Hessel Gerritsz, noted on his &quot;Map of the Pacific Ocean:&quot; &quot;Those who sailed with the yacht of Pedro Fernando de Quiros in the neighbourhood of New Guinea to 10 degrees westward through many islands and shoals and over for as many as 40 days, estimated that Nova Guinea does not extend beyond 10 degrees to the south; if this be so, then the land from 9 to 14 degrees would be a separate land&quot;.

Pedro Fernandes de Queirós, another Portuguese navigator sailing for the Spanish Crown, saw a large island south of New Guinea in 1606, which he named La Austrialia del Espiritu Santo. He represented this to the King of Spain as the Terra Australis incognita. In his 10th Memorial (1610), Queirós said: &quot;New Guinea is the top end of the Austral Land of which I treat [discuss], and that people, and customs, with all the rest referred to, resemble them&quot;.

Dutch father and son Isaac and Jacob Le Maire established the Australische Compagnie (Australian Company) in 1615 to trade with &quot;Terra Australis&quot;, which they called &quot;Australia&quot;.

The Dutch expedition to Valdivia of 1643 intended to round Cape Horn sailing through Le Maire Strait but strong winds made it instead drift south and east. The small fleet led by Hendrik Brouwer managed to enter the Pacific ocean sailing south of the island disproving earlier beliefs that it was part of &quot;Terra Australis&quot;.

The cartographic depictions of the southern continent in the 16th and early 17th centuries, as might be expected for a concept based on such abundant conjecture and minimal data, varied wildly from map to map; in general, the continent shrank as potential locations were reinterpreted. At its largest, the continent included Tierra del Fuego, separated from South America by a small strait; New Guinea; and what would come to be called Australia. In Ortelius&#x27;s atlas &quot;Theatrum Orbis Terrarum&quot;, published in 1570, &quot;Terra Australis&quot; extends north of the Tropic of Capricorn in the Pacific Ocean.

As long as it appeared on maps at all, the continent minimally included the unexplored lands around the South Pole, but generally much larger than the real Antarctica, spreading far north – especially in the Pacific Ocean. New Zealand, first seen by the Dutch explorer Abel Tasman in 1642, was regarded by some as a part of the continent.

A map with a &quot;Terra Australis&quot; stretching from New Guinea to the South Pole and beyond was included in the 1676 application by Vittorio Riccio, an Italian missionary in Manila, to be appointed Prefect Apostolic of &quot;Terra Australis&quot; in order to initiate missionary activity there. His appointment was approved in 1681 but he died in 1685.

====18th century====
Alexander Dalrymple, the Examiner of Sea Journals for the English East India Company, whilst translating some Spanish documents captured in the Philippines in 1762, found de Torres&#x27;s testimony. This discovery led Dalrymple to publish the &quot;Historical Collection of the Several Voyages and Discoveries in the South Pacific Ocean&quot; in 1770–1771. Dalrymple presented a beguiling tableau of the &quot;Terra Australis&quot;, or Southern Continent:
The number of inhabitants in the Southern Continent is probably more than 50 millions, considering the extent, from the eastern part discovered by Juan Fernandez, to the western coast seen by Tasman, is about 100 deg. of longitude, which in the latitude of 40 deg. amounts to 4596 geographic, or 5323 stature miles [8567 km]. This is a greater extent than the whole civilized part of Asia, from Turkey to the eastern extremity of China. There is at present no trade from Europe thither, though the scraps from this table would be sufficient to maintain the power, dominion, and sovereignty of Britain, by employing all its manufacturers and ships. Whoever considers the Peruvian empire, where arts and industry flourished under one of the wisest systems of government, which was founded by a stranger, must have very sanguine expectations of the southern continent, from whence it is more than probable Mango Capac, the first Inca, was derived, and must be convinced that the country, from whence Mango Capac introduced the comforts of civilized life, cannot fail of amply rewarding the fortunate people who shall bestow letters instead of quippos (quipus), and iron in place of more awkward substitutes.
Dalrymple&#x27;s claim of the existence of an unknown continent aroused widespread interest and prompted the British government in 1769 to order James Cook in HM Bark &quot;Endeavour&quot; to seek out the Southern Continent to the South and West of Tahiti, discovered in June 1767 by Samuel Wallis in and named by him King George Island. The London press reported in June 1768 that two ships would be sent to the newly discovered island and from there to &quot;attempt the Discovery of the Southern Continent&quot;. A subsequent press report stated: &quot;We are informed, that the Island which Captain Wallis has discovered in the South-Sea, and named George&#x27;s Land, is about fifteen hundred Leagues to the Westward and to Leeward of the Coast of Peru, and about five-and-thirty Leagues in circumference; that its principal and almost sole national Advantage is, its Situation for exploring the Terra Incognita of the Southern Hemisphere. The Endeavour, a North-Country Cat, is purchased by the Government, and commanded by a Lieutenant of the Navy; she is fitting out at Deptford for the South-Sea, thought to be intended for the newly-discovered Island&quot;. The aims of the expedition were revealed in days following: &quot;To-morrow morning Mr. Banks, Dr. Solano [sic], with Mr. Green, the Astronomer, will set out for Deal, to embark on board the Endeavour, Capt. Cook, for the South Seas, under the direction of the Royal Society, to observe the Transit of Venus next summer, and to make discoveries to the South and West of Cape Horn&quot;. The London &quot;Gazetteer&quot; was more explicit when it reported on 18 August 1768: &quot;The gentlemen, who are to sail in a few days for George&#x27;s Land, the new discovered island in the Pacific ocean, with an intention to observe the Transit of Venus, are likewise, we are credibly informed, to attempt some new discoveries in that vast unknown tract, above the latitude 40&quot;. The results of this first voyage of James Cook in respect of the quest for the Southern Continent were summed up by Cook himself. He wrote in his &quot;Journal&quot; on 31 March 1770 that the &quot;Endeavour&quot; voyage &quot;must be allowed to have set aside the most, if not all, the Arguments and proofs that have been advanced by different Authors to prove that there must be a Southern Continent; I mean to the Northward of 40 degrees South, for what may lie to the Southward of that Latitude I know not&quot;.

The second voyage of James Cook aboard explored the South Pacific for the landmass between 1772 and 1775 whilst also testing Larcum Kendall&#x27;s K1 chronometer as a method for measuring longitude.

==Decline of the idea==

Over the centuries the idea of &quot;Terra Australis&quot; gradually lost its hold. In 1616, Jacob Le Maire and Willem Schouten&#x27;s rounding of Cape Horn proved that Tierra del Fuego was a relatively small island, while in 1642 Abel Tasman&#x27;s first Pacific voyage proved that Australia was not part of the mythical southern continent. Much later, James Cook circumnavigated and charted New Zealand in 1770, showing that even it could not be part of a large continent. On his second voyage he circumnavigated the globe at a very high southern latitude, at some places even crossing the Antarctic Circle, showing that any possible southern continent must lie well within the cold polar areas. There could be no extension into regions with a temperate climate, as had been thought before. In 1814, Matthew Flinders published the book &quot;A Voyage to Terra Australis.&quot; Flinders had concluded that the &quot;Terra Australis&quot; as hypothesized by Aristotle and Ptolemy did not exist, so he wanted the name applied to what he saw as the next best thing: &quot;Australia&quot; (later the country), replacing the former name for the continent, New Holland. He wrote:
There is no probability, that any other detached body of land, of nearly equal extent, will ever be found in a more southern latitude; the name Terra Australis will, therefore, remain descriptive of the geographical importance of this country, and of its situation on the globe: it has antiquity to recommend it; and, having no reference to either of the two claiming nations, appears to be less objectionable than any other which could have been selected.
...with the accompanying note at the bottom of the page:
Had I permitted myself any innovation upon the original term, it would have been to convert it into AUSTRALIA; as being more agreeable to the ear, and an assimilation to the names of the other great portions of the earth.

With the discovery of Antarctica his conclusion would soon be revealed as a mistake, but by that time the name had stuck.
==The Province of Beach==
A land feature known as the &quot;Province of Beach&quot; or &quot;Boeach&quot; – from the Latin &quot;Provincia boëach&quot; – appears to have resulted from mistranscriptions of a name in Marco Polo&#x27;s &quot;Il Milione&quot; (Book III). Polo described his journey by sea from China to India by way of Champa (&quot;provincia ciamba&quot;; modern southern Vietnam), &quot;Java Major&quot;, &quot;Locach&quot; (modern Lop Buri), and Sumatra (&quot;Java Minor&quot;). In Cantonese, Lavo (an early name of Lop Buri) was pronounced &quot;Lo-huk&quot; 羅斛 and &quot;Locach&quot; was Marco Polo&#x27;s transcription of this name. According to Polo, Locach was a kingdom where gold was &quot;so plentiful that no one who did not see it could believe it&quot;. Polo&#x27;s narrative describes the route southward from Champa toward Sumatra, but by a slip of the pen the name &quot;Java&quot; (which Polo did not himself visit) was substituted for &quot;Champa&quot; as the point of departure, thereby mis-locating Sumatra and Locach south of Java (rather than Champa). Consequently, some geographers believed that Sumatra and Locach were near, or extensions of, &quot;Terra Australis&quot;.

In the German cursive script, &quot;Locach&quot; and &quot;Boeach&quot; look similar. A feature known as the &quot;Province of Beach&quot; or &quot;Boeach&quot; – from the Latin &quot;Provincia boëach&quot; – appears on European maps as early as the 15th century. On a map of the world published in Florence in 1489 by Henricus Martellus, the Latin name &quot;provincia boëach&quot; is given to a southern neighbour of Champa. In a 1532 edition of Marco Polo&#x27;s &quot;Travels&quot;, Locach was changed to &quot;Boëach&quot;, later shortened to &quot;Beach&quot;.

By the mid-16th century, according to Henry Yule, the editor of a modern (1921) edition of Polo&#x27;s &quot;Travels&quot;, some geographers and cartographers followed the error in older editions of Polo that &quot;placed ... the land of &quot;Boeach&quot; (or Locac)&quot; south-east of Java and &quot;introduced in their maps a continent in that situation&quot;. Gerard Mercator did just that on his 1541 globe, placing &quot;Beach provincia aurifera&quot; (&quot;Beach the gold-bearing province&quot;) in the northernmost part of the &quot;Terra Australis&quot; in accordance with the faulty text of Marco Polo&#x27;s &quot;Travels&quot;. The landmass of Beach remained in this location on Mercator&#x27;s world map of 1569, with the amplified description, quoting Marco Polo, &quot;Beach provincia aurifera quam pauci ex alienis regionibus adeunt propter gentis inhumanitatem&quot; (&quot;Beach the gold-bearing province, wither few go from other countries because of the inhumanity of its people&quot;) with &quot;Lucach regnum&quot; shown somewhat to its south west. Following Mercator, Abraham Ortelius also showed and in these locations on his world map of 1571.

The 1596 map by Jan Huygen van Linschoten showed and , projecting from the map&#x27;s southern edge as the northernmost parts of the &quot;Terra Australis&quot; long hypothesized by Europeans. An encounter by the Dutch vessel &quot;Eendracht&quot;, commanded by Dirk Hartog, with Shark Bay, Western Australia in 1616, appeared to confirm that land existed where the maps showed &quot;Beach&quot;; Hartog named the wider landmass &quot;Eendrachtsland&quot;, after his ship. In August 1642, the Council of the Dutch East India Company – evidently still relying on Linschoten&#x27;s map – despatched Abel Tasman and Frans Jacobszoon Visscher on a voyage of exploration, of which one of the objects was to obtain knowledge of &quot;all the totally unknown provinces of Beach&quot;.

==In fiction==

The unexplored southern continent was a frequent subject of fantastic fiction in the 17th and 18th centuries in the imaginary voyages genre. Among the works which dealt with imaginary visits to the continent (which at the time was still believed to be real) were:
* &quot;&quot; (1605), a satirical work by Joseph Hall, Bishop of Norwich;
* &quot;The Isle of Pines&quot; (1668) by the English politician Henry Neville;
* &quot;The Southern Land, Known&quot; (1676) by Gabriel de Foigny;
* &quot; (1675) by the French Huguenot writer Denis Vairasse d&#x27;Allais.
* &quot; (, incorrectly dated 1710) by Simon Tyssot de Patot;
* &quot;: The Fortunate Shipwreck, or a description of New Athens in Terra Australis incognita&quot; (1720) by the English dramatist Thomas Killigrew;
* &quot;Relation d&#x27;un voyage du Pole Arctique, au Pole Antarctique par le centre du monde&quot; (1721), anonymous;
* &quot;Relation du royaume des Féliciens&quot; (1727) by the Marquis de Lassay;
* &quot;Viaggi di Enrico Wanton alle Terre incognite Australi&quot; (1749) by Zaccaria Seriman;
* &quot;Voyage de Robertson, aux Terres Australes, traduit sur le manuscrit anglois&quot; (1767), anonymous;
* &quot;La découverte australe par un homme-volant&quot; (1781) by Restif de la Bretonne;
* The idea of &quot;Terra Australis&quot; was also used by Terry Pratchett in his &quot;Discworld&quot; series of novels (1983–2014) where the World is balanced by the strange and little-known Counterweight Continent.

<text>County Antrim (named after the town of Antrim, ) is one of the six counties of Northern Ireland, located within the historic province of Ulster. Adjoined to the north-east shore of Lough Neagh, the county covers an area of and has a population of 651,321, as of the 2021 census. County Antrim has a population density of 211 people per square kilometre or 546 people per square mile. It is also one of the thirty-two traditional counties of Ireland.

The Glens of Antrim offer isolated rugged landscapes, the Giant&#x27;s Causeway is a unique landscape and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Bushmills produces whiskey, and Portrush is a popular seaside resort and night-life area. The majority of Belfast, the capital city of Northern Ireland, is in County Antrim, with the remainder being in County Down.

According to the 2001, 2011, and 2021 censuses it is currently one of only two counties of the Island of Ireland in which a plurality or majority of the population are from a Protestant background. The other is County Down to the south.

==Geography==

A large portion of Antrim is hilly, especially in the east, where the highest elevations are attained. The range runs north and south, and, following this direction, the highest points are Knocklayd , Slieveanorra , Trostan , Slemish , Agnew&#x27;s Hill and Divis . The inland slope is gradual, but on the northern shore the range terminates in abrupt and almost perpendicular declivities, and here, consequently, some of the finest coast scenery in the world is found, widely differing, with its unbroken lines of cliffs, from the indented coast-line of the west. The most remarkable cliffs are those formed of perpendicular basaltic columns, extending for many miles, and most strikingly displayed in Fair Head and the celebrated Giant&#x27;s Causeway. From the eastern coast the hills rise instantly but less abruptly, and the indentations are wider and deeper. On both coasts there are several resort towns, including Portrush (with well-known golf links), Portballintrae and Ballycastle; on the east Cushendun, Cushendall and Waterfoot on Red Bay, Carnlough and Glenarm, Larne on the Sea of Moyle, and Whitehead on Belfast Lough. All are somewhat exposed to the easterly winds prevalent in spring. The only island of size is the L-shaped Rathlin Island, off Ballycastle, in total length by maximum breadth, from the coast, and of similar basaltic and limestone formation to that of the mainland. It is partially arable, and supports a small population. Islandmagee is a peninsula separating Larne Lough from the North Channel.

The valleys of the Bann and Lagan, with the intervening shores of Lough Neagh, form the fertile lowlands. These two rivers, both rising in County Down, are the only ones of importance. The latter flows to Belfast Lough, the former drains Lough Neagh, which is fed by a number of smaller streams. The fisheries of the Bann and of Lough Neagh (especially for salmon and eels) are of value both commercially and to sportsmen, the small town of Toome, at the outflow of the river, being the centre. Immediately below this point lies Lough Beg, the &quot;Small Lake&quot;, about lower than Lough Neagh.

==Transport==
County Antrim has a number of air, rail and sea links.

===Airports===
Northern Ireland&#x27;s main airport, Belfast International Airport, at Aldergrove, is in County Antrim. Belfast International shares its runways with 38 Brigade Flying Station Aldergrove, which otherwise has its own facilities. It is the fifth-largest regional air cargo centre in the UK. There are regular services to Great Britain, Europe and North America.

The region is also served by George Best Belfast City Airport, a mile east of Belfast city centre on the County Down side of the city, which was renamed in 2006 in honour of footballer George Best.

===Rail===
The main Translink Northern Ireland Railways routes are the major line between Belfast, Antrim, Ballymena, Coleraine and Derry, Belfast to Carrickfergus and Larne, the port for Stranraer in Scotland and Coleraine to Portrush.

===Sea===
Two of Northern Ireland&#x27;s main ports are in County Antrim, Larne and Belfast.

Ferries sail from Larne Harbour to destinations including Cairnryan in Scotland.

The Port of Belfast is Northern Ireland&#x27;s principal maritime gateway, serving the Northern Ireland economy and increasingly that of the Republic of Ireland. It is a major centre of industry and commerce and has become established as the focus of logistics activity for Northern Ireland. Around two-thirds of Northern Ireland&#x27;s seaborne trade, and a quarter of that for Ireland as a whole is handled at the port, which receives over 6,000 vessels each year.

==Demographics==
As of the 2021 census, County Antrim had a population of 651,321, making it the most populous county in Northern Ireland, and the second-largest county by population on the island of Ireland, second only to County Dublin.

=== Ethnicity ===
=== Country of birth ===
=== Community background and religion ===

A traditionally Protestant-majority county since the Plantation of Ulster by Scottish and English settlers, the 2021 census revealed that those of a Protestant and Other Christian community background were no longer a majority in Antrim, comprising 47.0% of the population, a sharp decline from 75.2% in 1861. This is largely attributable to the rapid increase of the Catholic population, particularly in the city of Belfast, where they now comprise a plurality of the population, and its surrounding metropolitan area, as well as immigration from other parts of the world following the end of The Troubles and increasing rates of irreligion.


=== National identity ===
===Irish language and Ulster Scots===
In the 2021 UK census in County Antrim:
* 12.77% claim to have some knowledge of the Irish language, whilst 3.64% claim to be able to speak, read, write and understand spoken Irish. 2.55% claim to use Irish daily. 0.46% claim that Irish is their main language.
* 12.09% claim to have some knowledge of Ulster Scots, whilst 1.39% claim to be able to speak, read, write and understand spoken Ulster Scots. 2.25% claim to use Ulster Scots daily.

Statistics for 2009–2010 show 1,832 students attending the twelve (Irish language primary schools) and one (Irish language secondary school).

==Administration==
The county was administered by Antrim County Council from 1899 until the abolition of county councils in Northern Ireland in 1973. The traditional county town is Antrim. More recently, Ballymena was the seat of county government. From 1973 Northern Ireland was split into districts, which were redrawn in 2015. County Antrim is part of the following districts:
* Antrim and Newtownabbey
* Belfast
* Causeway Coast and Glens
* Mid and East Antrim
* Lisburn and Castlereagh
* Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon

The county contains within it the whole of five parliamentary constituencies:
* Belfast North

==History==

At what date the county of Antrim was formed is not known, but it appears that a certain district bore this name before the reign of Edward II (early 14th century), and when the shiring of Ulster was undertaken by Sir John Perrot in the 16th century, Antrim and Down were already recognised divisions, in contradistinction to the remainder of the province. The earliest known inhabitants were Mesolithic hunter-gatherers of pre-Celtic origin, but the names of the townlands or subdivisions, supposed to have been made in the 13th century, are all of Celtic derivation.

In ancient times, Antrim was inhabited by a Celtic people called the Darini. In the early Middle Ages, southern County Antrim was part of the Kingdom of Ulidia, ruled by the Dál Fiatach clans Keenan and MacDonlevy/McDunlavey; the north was part of Dál Riada, which stretched into what is now western Scotland over the Irish Sea. Dál Riada was ruled by the O&#x27;Lynch clan, who were vassals of the Ulidians. Besides the Ulidians and Dál Riada, there were the Dál nAraide of lower County Antrim, and the Cruthin, who were pre-Gaelic Celts and probably related to the Picts of Britain. Between the 8th and 11th centuries Antrim was exposed to the inroads of the Vikings.

In the late 12th century Antrim became part of the Earldom of Ulster, conquered by Anglo-Norman invaders. A revival of Gaelic power followed the campaign of Edward Bruce in 1315, leaving Carrickfergus as the only significant English stronghold. In the late Middle Ages, Antrim was divided into three parts: northern Clandeboye, the Glynnes and the Route. The Cambro-Norman MacQuillans were powerful in the Route.

A branch of the O&#x27;Neills of Tirconnell (modern Tyrone) migrated to Clandeboye in the 14th century, and ruled it for a time from their castle on Lough Neagh. Their family was called Clandeboye O&#x27;Neills. Donald Balloch, who succeeded his father John Mor Macdonald, Lord of Dunyvaig and the Glens, married the daughter of Conn O&#x27;Neill of the Clandeboye O&#x27;Neills sometime after the Battle of Inverlochy. In 1433, Alexander of Islay, Lord of the Isles, joined with his cousin, Donald Balloch, Conn O&#x27;Neill of the Clandeboye O&#x27;Neills, and Eoghan O&#x27;Neill, king of Tirowen (modern Tyrone) to defend against an attack on Antrim by the O&#x27;Donnells of Tirconnell. Alexander Macdonald led the attack that was successful, so that the O&#x27;Donnells became subject to the O&#x27;Neills of Tirowen. A Gallowglass sept, the MacDonnells (they were &quot;Macdonalds&quot; in Scotland), became the most powerful in the Glens in the 15th century.

During the Tudor era (16th century) numerous adventurers from Britain attempted to colonise the region; many Scots settled in Antrim around this time. In 1588 the Antrim coast was the scene of one of the 24 wrecks of the Spanish Armada in Ireland. The Spanish vessel &quot;La Girona&quot; was wrecked off Lacana Point, Giant&#x27;s Causeway in 1588 with the loss of nearly 1,300 lives.

Antrim is divided into sixteen baronies. Lower Antrim, part of Lower Clandeboye, was settled by the sept O&#x27;Flynn/O&#x27;Lynn. Upper Antrim, part of Lower Clandeboye, was the home of the O&#x27;Keevans. Belfast was part of Lower Clandeboye and was held by the O&#x27;Neill-Clannaboys. Lower Belfast, Upper Belfast, and Carrickfergus were also part of Lower Clandeboye. Cary was part of the Glynnes; ruled originally by the O&#x27;Quinn sept, the MacDonnell galloglasses from Scotland took power here in the late Middle Ages and some of the O&#x27;Haras also migrated from Connaught. Upper and Lower Dunluce were part of the Route, and were ruled by the MacQuillans. Upper and Lower Glenarm was ruled by the O&#x27;Flynn/O&#x27;Lynn sept, considered part of the Glynns. In addition to that sept and that of O&#x27;Quinn, both of which were native, the Scottish Gallowglass septs of MacKeown, MacAlister, and MacGee, are found there. Kilconway was originally O&#x27;Flynn/O&#x27;Lynn territory, but was held by the MacQuillans as part of the Route, and later by the gallowglass sept of MacNeill. Lower Massereene was part of Lower Clandeboye and was ruled by the O&#x27;Flynns and the O&#x27;Heircs. Upper Massereene was part of Lower Clandeboye, ruled by the O&#x27;Heircs. Upper and Lower Toome, part of the Route, were O&#x27;Flynn/O&#x27;Lynn territory. Misc was first ruled by the MacQuillans. Later, the Scottish Gallowglass MacDonnells and MacAlisters invaded. The MacDonnells were a branch of the Scottish Clan MacDonald; the MacAlisters traced their origin back to the Irish Colla Uais, eldest of the Three Collas.

Islandmagee had, besides antiquarian remains, a notoriety as a home of witchcraft, and during the Irish Rebellion of 1641 was the scene of an act of reprisal (for the massacre of Protestants) against the Catholic population by the Scottish Covenanter soldiery of Carrickfergus.

In 1689 during the Williamite War in Ireland, County Antrim was a centre of Protestant resistance against the rule of the Catholic James II. During the developing crisis James&#x27; garrison at Carrickfergus successfully repulsed an attempt by local Protestants to storm it. After the advance of the Irish Army under Richard Hamilton, all of County Antrim was brought under Jacobite control. Later in the year a major expedition from England under Marshal Schomberg landed in Belfast Lough and successfully laid siege to Carrickfergus. Having captured most of the largest towns of the area, they then marched southwards towards Dundalk.

===Historic monuments===


The antiquities of the county consist of cairns, mounts or forts, remains of ecclesiastical and military structures, and round towers.

There are three round towers: one at Antrim, one at Armoy, and one on Ram&#x27;s Island in Lough Neagh, only that at Antrim being perfect. There are some remains of the ecclesiastic establishments at Bonamargy, where the earls of Antrim are buried, Kells, Glenarm, Glynn, Muckamore and Whiteabbey.

The castle at Carrickfergus, dating from the Norman invasion of Ireland, is one of the best preserved medieval structures in Ireland. There are, however, remains of other ancient castles, as Olderfleet, Cam&#x27;s, Shane&#x27;s, Glenarm, Garron Tower, Red Bay, and Dunluce Castle, notable for its dramatic location on a rocky outcrop.

The principal cairns are: one on Colin mountain, near Lisburn; one on Slieve True, near Carrickfergus; and two on Colinward. The cromlechs most worthy of notice are: one near Cairngrainey, to the north-east of the old road from Belfast to Templepatrick; the large cromlech at Mount Druid, near Ballintoy; and one at the northern extremity of Islandmagee. The mounts, forts and entrenchments are very numerous.

The natural rock formations of Giant&#x27;s Causeway on the Antrim coast are now designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

===Saint Patrick===
Slemish, about east of Ballymena, is notable as being the scene of St Patrick&#x27;s early life. According to tradition Saint Patrick was a slave for seven years, near the hill of Slemish, until he escaped back to Great Britain.

===Linen===
Linen manufacturing was previously an important industry in the county. At the time Ireland produced a large amount of flax. Cotton-spinning by jennies was first introduced to Belfast by industrialists Robert Joy and Thomas M&#x27;Cabe in 1777; and twenty-three years later it was estimated that more than 27,000 people were employed in the industry within of Belfast. Women were employed in the working of patterns on muslin.

<text>Alfred Marshall (26 July 1842 – 13 July 1924) was an English economist and one of the most influential economists of his time. His book &quot;Principles of Economics&quot; (1890) was the dominant economic textbook in England for many years. It brought the ideas of supply and demand, marginal utility, and costs of production into a coherent whole. He is known as one of the founders of neoclassical economics.

==Life and career==
Marshall was born at Bermondsey in London, second son of William Marshall (1812–1901), clerk and cashier at the Bank of England, and Rebecca (1817–1878), daughter of butcher Thomas Oliver, from whom, on her mother&#x27;s death, she inherited property. William Marshall was a devout strict Evangelical, &quot;author of an Evangelical epic in a sort of Anglo-Saxon language of his own invention which found some favour in its appropriate circles&quot; and of a tract titled &quot;Men&#x27;s Rights and Women&#x27;s Duties&quot;. There are scholars who note that this strict upbringing wielded strong influence on Marshall&#x27;s work such as how he favored the doctrines of philosophical idealism. 

Marshall had two brothers and two sisters; a cousin was the economist Ralph Hawtrey. The Marshalls were a West Country clerical family; Marshall&#x27;s great-great-grandfather was &quot;the Reverend William Marshall, half-legendary Herculean parson of Devonshire&quot;, famous for &quot;twisting horseshoes with his hands&quot; to scare &quot;local blacksmiths into fearing that they blew their bellows for the devil&quot;. Marshall grew up in Clapham and was educated at the Merchant Taylors&#x27; School and St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he demonstrated an aptitude in mathematics, achieving the rank of Second Wrangler in the 1865 Cambridge Mathematical Tripos. Marshall experienced a mental crisis that led him to abandon physics and switch to philosophy. He began with metaphysics, specifically &quot;the philosophical foundation of knowledge, especially in relation to theology&quot;. Metaphysics led Marshall to ethics, specifically a Sidgwickian version of utilitarianism; ethics, in turn, led him to economics, because economics played an essential role in providing the preconditions for the improvement of the working class.

He saw that the duty of economics was to improve material conditions, but such improvement would occur, Marshall believed, only in connection with social and political forces. His interest in Georgism, liberalism, socialism, trade unions, women&#x27;s education, poverty and progress reflect the influence of his early social philosophy on his later activities and writings.

Marshall was elected in 1865 to a fellowship at St John&#x27;s College at Cambridge, and became lecturer in the moral sciences in 1868. He taught Mary Paley who was became a lecturer at the then embryonic Newnham College, Cambridge; their marriage in 1877 obliged Marshall to resign his position as a Fellow of St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. This coincided with his appointment as the first principal at University College, Bristol, which later became the University of Bristol, where he lectured political economy and economics, alongside his wife, until he resigned in 1881. He returned as Professor of Political Economy in 1882, leaving Bristol for good in 1883 when he was appointed a tutorial fellow at Balliol College, University of Oxford.

In 1885 he was appointed professor of political economy at Cambridge University, where he remained until his retirement in 1908. Over the years he interacted with many British thinkers including Henry Sidgwick, W. K. Clifford, Benjamin Jowett, William Stanley Jevons, Francis Ysidro Edgeworth, John Neville Keynes and John Maynard Keynes. Marshall founded the Cambridge School which paid special attention to increasing returns, the theory of the firm, and welfare economics; after his retirement academic leadership of the Cambridge economists was taken up by Arthur Cecil Pigou and John Maynard Keynes.

==Contributions to economics==
Marshall desired to improve the mathematical rigour of economics and transform it into a more scientific profession. In the 1870s he wrote a small number of tracts on international trade and the problems of protectionism. In 1879, many of these works were compiled into a work entitled &quot;The Theory of Foreign Trade: The Pure Theory of Domestic Values&quot;. In the same year (1879) he published &quot;The Economics of Industry&quot; with his wife Mary Paley Marshall.

Although Marshall took economics to a more mathematically rigorous level, he did not want mathematics to overshadow economics and thus make economics irrelevant to the layman. Accordingly, Marshall tailored the text of his books to laymen and put the mathematical content in the footnotes and appendices for the professionals. In a letter to A. L. Bowley, he laid out the following system: 

Together, he and his wife completed &quot;Economics of Industry&quot; while at Bristol, and after publication it was adopted widely in England as an economic curriculum; its simple form stood upon sophisticated theoretical foundations. Marshall achieved a measure of fame from this work, and upon the death of William Jevons in 1882, Marshall became the leading British economist of the scientific school of his time.

Marshall returned to Cambridge as Professor of Political Economy in 1884 on the death of Henry Fawcett. At Cambridge he endeavoured to create a new tripos for economics, a goal which he would achieve only in 1903. Until that time, economics was taught under the Historical and Moral Sciences Triposes which failed to provide Marshall the kind of energetic and specialised students he desired.

Along with Pigou and Hawtrey, Marshall developed the quantity theory of money or the income version of the money theory. In 1917, Marshall introduced the Cambridge version of the quantity theory of money and this was refined further by Pigou, Hawtrey, and Robertson. It became known as the Cambridge equation.

===&quot;Principles of Economics&quot; (1890)===

Marshall began his economic work, the &quot;Principles of Economics&quot;, in 1881, and spent much of the next decade at work on the treatise. His plan for the work gradually extended to a two-volume compilation on the whole of economic thought. The first volume was published in 1890 to worldwide acclaim, establishing him as one of the leading economists of his time. The second volume, which was to address foreign trade, money, trade fluctuations, taxation, and collectivism, was never published.

&quot;Principles of Economics&quot; established his worldwide reputation. It appeared in eight editions, starting at 750 pages and growing to 870 pages. It decisively shaped the teaching of economics in English-speaking countries. Its main technical contribution was a masterful analysis of the issues of elasticity, consumer surplus, increasing and diminishing returns, short and long terms, and marginal utility. Many of the ideas were original with Marshall; others were improved versions of the ideas by W. S. Jevons and others.

In a broader sense Marshall hoped to reconcile the classical and modern theories of value. John Stuart Mill had examined the relationship between the value of commodities and their production costs, on the theory that value depends on the effort expended in manufacture. Jevons and the marginal utility theorists had elaborated a theory of value based on the idea of maximising utility, holding that value depends on demand. Marshall&#x27;s work used both these approaches, but he focused more on costs. He noted that, in the short run, supply cannot be changed and market value depends mainly on demand. In an intermediate time period, production can be expanded by existing facilities, such as buildings and machinery, but, since these do not require renewal within this intermediate period, their costs (called fixed, overhead, or supplementary costs) have little influence on the sale price of the product. Marshall pointed out that it is the prime or variable costs, which constantly recur, that influence the sale price most in this period. In a still longer period, machines and buildings wear out and have to be replaced, so that the sale price of the product must be high enough to cover such replacement costs. This classification of costs into fixed and variable and the emphasis given to the element of time probably represent one of Marshall&#x27;s chief contributions to economic theory. He was committed to partial equilibrium models over general equilibrium on the grounds that the inherently dynamical nature of economics made the former more practically useful.

Much of the success of Marshall&#x27;s teaching and &quot;Principles&quot; book derived from his effective use of diagrams, which were soon emulated by other teachers worldwide.

Alfred Marshall was the first to develop the standard supply and demand graph demonstrating a number of fundamentals regarding supply and demand including the supply and demand curves, market equilibrium, the relationship between quantity and price in regards to supply and demand, the law of marginal utility, the law of diminishing returns, and the ideas of consumer and producer surpluses. This model is now used by economists in various forms using different variables to demonstrate several other economic principles. Marshall&#x27;s model allowed a visual representation of complex economic fundamentals where before all the ideas and theories were only capable of being explained through words. These models are now critical throughout the study of economics because they allow a clear and concise representation of the fundamentals or theories being explained.

===Theoretical contributions===
Marshall is considered to be one of the most influential economists of his time, largely shaping mainstream economic thought for the next fifty years, and being one of the founders of the school of neoclassical economics. Although his economics was advertised as extensions and refinements of the work of Adam Smith, Thomas Robert Malthus and John Stuart Mill, he extended economics away from its classical focus on the market economy and instead popularised it as a study of human behaviour. He downplayed the contributions of certain other economists to his work, such as Léon Walras, Vilfredo Pareto and Jules Dupuit, and only grudgingly acknowledged the influence of Stanley Jevons himself.

Marshall was one of those who used utility analysis, but not as a theory of value. He used it as a part of the theory to explain demand curves and the principle of substitution. Marshall&#x27;s scissors analysis – which combined demand and supply, that is, utility and cost of production, as if in the two blades of a pair of scissors – effectively removed the theory of value from the center of analysis and replaced it with the theory of price. While the term &quot;value&quot; continued to be used, for most people it was a synonym for &quot;price&quot;. Prices no longer were thought to gravitate toward some ultimate and absolute basis of price; prices were existential, between the relationship of demand and supply.

Marshall&#x27;s influence on codifying economic thought is difficult to deny. He popularised the use of supply and demand functions as tools of price determination (previously discovered independently by Cournot); modern economists owe the linkage between price shifts and curve shifts to Marshall. Marshall was an important part of the &quot;marginalist revolution&quot;; the idea that consumers attempt to adjust consumption until marginal utility equals the price was another of his contributions. The price elasticity of demand was presented by Marshall as an extension of these ideas. Economic welfare, divided into producer surplus and consumer surplus, was contributed by Marshall, and indeed, the two are sometimes described eponymously as &#x27;Marshallian surplus.&#x27; He used this idea of surplus to rigorously analyse the effect of taxes and price shifts on market welfare. Marshall also identified quasi-rents.

Marshall&#x27;s brief references to the social and cultural relations in the &quot;industrial districts&quot; of England were used as a starting point for late twentieth-century work in economic geography and institutional economics on clustering and learning organisations.

Gary Becker (1930–2014), the 1992 Nobel prize winner in economics, has mentioned that Milton Friedman and Alfred Marshall were the two greatest influences on his work.

Another contribution that Marshall made was differentiating concepts of internal and external economies of scale. That is that when costs of input factors of production go down, it is a positive externality for all the firms in the market place, outside the control of any of the firms.

===The Marshallian industrial district===
A concept based on a pattern of organisation that was common in late nineteenth-century Britain in which firms concentrating on the manufacture of certain products were geographically clustered. Comments made by Marshall in Book 4, Chapter 10 of &quot;Principles of Economics&quot; have been used by economists and economic geographers to discuss this phenomenon.

The two dominant characteristics of a Marshallian industrial district are high degrees of vertical and horizontal specialisation and a very heavy reliance on market mechanism for exchange. Firms tend to be small and to focus on a single function in the production chain. Firms located in industrial districts are highly competitive in the neoclassical sense, and in many cases there is little product differentiation. The major advantages of Marshallian industrial districts arise from simple propinquity of firms, which allows easier recruitment of skilled labour and rapid exchanges of commercial and technical information through informal channels. They illustrate competitive capitalism at its most efficient, with transaction costs reduced to a practical minimum, but they are feasible only when economies of scale are limited.

==Later career==
Marshall served as president of the first day of the 1889 Co-operative Congress.

Over the next two decades he worked to complete the second volume of his &quot;Principles,&quot; but his unyielding attention to detail and ambition for completeness prevented him from mastering the work&#x27;s breadth. The work was never finished and many other, lesser works he had begun work on – a memorandum on trade policy for the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the 1890s, for instance – were left incomplete for the same reasons.

His health problems had gradually grown worse since the 1880s, and in 1908 he retired from the university. He hoped to continue work on his &quot;Principles&quot; but his health continued to deteriorate and the project had continued to grow with each further investigation. The outbreak of the First World War in 1914 prompted him to revise his examinations of the international economy and in 1919 he published &quot;Industry and Trade&quot; at the age of 77. This work was a more empirical treatise than the largely theoretical &quot;Principles&quot;, and for that reason it failed to attract as much acclaim from theoretical economists. In 1923, he published &quot;Money, Credit, and Commerce,&quot; a broad amalgam of previous economic ideas, published and unpublished, stretching back a half-century.

==Final years, death and legacy==

From 1890 to 1924 he was the respected father of the economic profession and to most economists for the half-century after his death, the venerable grandfather. He had shied away from controversy during his life in a way that previous leaders of the profession had not, although his even-handedness drew great respect and even reverence from fellow economists, and his home at Balliol Croft in Cambridge had no shortage of distinguished guests. His students at Cambridge became leading figures in economics, including John Maynard Keynes and Arthur Cecil Pigou. His most important legacy was creating a respected, academic, scientifically founded profession for economists in the future that set the tone of the field for the remainder of the 20th century.

Marshall died aged 81 at his home in Cambridge and is buried in the Ascension Parish Burial Ground. Keynes wrote an obituary for his former tutor which Joseph Schumpeter called &quot;the most brilliant life of a man of science I have ever read&quot;.

The library of the Department of Economics at Cambridge University (The Marshall Library of Economics), the Economics society at Cambridge (The Marshall Society) as well as the University of Bristol Economics department are named after him. His archive is available for consultation by appointment at the Marshall Library of Economics.

His home, Balliol Croft, was renamed Marshall House in 1991 in his honour when it was bought by Lucy Cavendish College, Cambridge.

Alfred Marshall&#x27;s wife was Mary Paley, an economist who was one of the first women students at Cambridge and a lecturer at Newnham College. She continued to live in Balliol Croft until her death in 1944; her ashes were scattered in the garden. The couple had no children.
