<text>Vaudeville (; ) is a theatrical genre of variety entertainment which began in France at the end of the 19th century. A Vaudeville was originally a comedy without psychological or moral intentions, based on a comical situation: a dramatic composition or light poetry, interspersed with songs and dances. It became popular in the United States and Canada from the early 1880s until the early 1930s, while changing over time.

In some ways analogous to music hall from Victorian Britain, a typical North American vaudeville performance was made up of a series of separate, unrelated acts grouped together on a common bill. Types of acts have included popular and classical musicians, singers, dancers, comedians, trained animals, magicians, ventriloquists, strongmen, female and male impersonators, acrobats, clowns, illustrated songs, jugglers, one-act plays or scenes from plays, athletes, lecturing celebrities, minstrels, and films. A vaudeville performer is often referred to as a &quot;vaudevillian&quot;.

Vaudeville developed from many sources, including the concert saloon, minstrelsy, freak shows, dime museums, and literary American burlesque. Called &quot;the heart of American show business&quot;, Vaudeville was one of the most popular types of entertainment in North America for several decades.

== Etymology ==
The origin of the term is obscure but often explained as being derived from the French expression &quot;voix de ville&quot; . A second hypothesis is that it comes from the 15th-century songs on satire by poet Olivier Basselin, &quot;Vau de Vire&quot;. In his &quot;Connections&quot; television series, science historian James Burke argues that the term is a corruption of the French , an area known for its bawdy drinking songs and where Basselin lived. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; also endorses the origin, a truncated form of . Around 1610, Jean le Houx collected these works as &quot;Le Livre des Chants nouveaux de Vaudevire&quot;, which is probably the direct origin of the word.

== Beginnings ==
With its first subtle appearances within the early 1860s, vaudeville was not initially a common form of entertainment. The form gradually evolved from the concert saloon and variety hall into its mature form throughout the 1870s and 1880s. This more gentle form was known as &quot;Polite Vaudeville&quot;.

In the years before the American Civil War, entertainment existed on a different scale. Similar variety theatre existed before 1860 in Europe and elsewhere. In the US, as early as the first decades of the 19th century, theatergoers could enjoy a performance consisting of Shakespeare plays, acrobatics, singing, dancing, and comedy. As the years progressed, people seeking diversified amusement found an increasing number of ways to be entertained. Vaudeville was characterized by traveling companies touring through cities and towns. A handful of circuses regularly toured the country; dime museums appealed to the curious; amusement parks, riverboats, and town halls often featured &quot;cleaner&quot; presentations of variety entertainment; compared to saloons, music halls, and burlesque houses, which catered to those with a taste for the &quot;risqué&quot;. In the 1840s, the minstrel show, another type of variety performance, and &quot;the first emanation of a pervasive and purely American mass culture&quot;, grew to enormous popularity and formed what Nick Tosches called &quot;the heart of 19th-century show business&quot;. A significant influence also came from &quot;Dutch&quot; (i.e., German or faux-German) minstrels and comedians. Medicine shows traveled the countryside offering programs of comedy, music, jugglers, and other novelties along with displays of tonics, salves, and miracle elixirs, while &quot;Wild West&quot; shows provided romantic vistas of the disappearing frontier, complete with trick riding, music and drama. Vaudeville incorporated these various itinerant amusements into a stable, institutionalized form centered in America&#x27;s growing urban hubs.

From the mid-1860s, impresario Tony Pastor, a former singing circus clown who had become a prominent variety theater performer and manager, capitalized on middle class sensibilities and spending power when he began to feature &quot;polite&quot; variety programs in his New York City theatres. Pastor opened his first &quot;Opera House&quot; on the Bowery in 1865, later moving his variety theater operation to Broadway and, finally, to Fourteenth Street near Union Square. He only began to use the term &quot;vaudeville&quot; in place of &quot;variety&quot; in early 1876. Hoping to draw a potential audience from female and family-based shopping traffic uptown, Pastor barred the sale of liquor in his theatres, eliminated bawdy material from his shows, and offered gifts of coal and hams to attendees. Pastor&#x27;s experiment proved successful, and other managers soon followed suit.

B. F. Keith took the next step, starting in Boston, where he built an empire of theatres and brought vaudeville to the United States and Canada. Later, E. F. Albee, adoptive grandfather of the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Edward Albee, managed the chain to its greatest success. Circuits such as those managed by Keith-Albee provided vaudeville&#x27;s greatest economic innovation and the principal source of its industrial strength. They enabled a chain of allied vaudeville houses that remedied the chaos of the single-theatre booking system by contracting acts for regional and national tours. These could easily be lengthened from a few weeks to two years.

Albee also gave national prominence to vaudeville&#x27;s trumpeting &quot;polite&quot; entertainment, a commitment to entertainment equally inoffensive to men, women and children. Acts that violated this ethos (e.g., those that used words such as &quot;hell&quot;) were admonished and threatened with expulsion from the week&#x27;s remaining performances or were canceled altogether. In spite of such threats, performers routinely flouted this censorship, often to the delight of the very audience members whose sensibilities were supposedly endangered. He eventually instituted a set of guidelines to be an audience member at his show, and these were reinforced by the ushers working in the theatre.

This &quot;polite entertainment&quot; also extended to Keith&#x27;s company members. He went to extreme measures to maintain this level of modesty. Keith even went as far as posting warnings backstage such as this: &quot;Don&#x27;t say &#x27;slob&#x27; or &#x27;son of a gun&#x27; or &#x27;hully gee&#x27; on the stage unless you want to be canceled peremptorily... if you are guilty of uttering anything sacrilegious or even suggestive you will be immediately closed and will never again be allowed in a theatre where Mr. Keith is in authority.&quot; Along these same lines of discipline, Keith&#x27;s theatre managers would occasionally send out blue envelopes with orders to omit certain suggestive lines of songs and possible substitutions for those words. If actors chose to ignore these orders or quit, they would get &quot;a black mark&quot; on their name and would never again be allowed to work on the Keith Circuit. Thus, actors learned to follow the instructions given to them by B. F. Keith for fear of losing their careers forever.

By the late 1890s, vaudeville had large circuits, houses (small and large) in almost every sizable location, standardized booking, broad pools of skilled acts, and a loyal national following. One of the biggest circuits was Martin Beck&#x27;s Orpheum Circuit. It incorporated in 1919 and brought together 45 vaudeville theatres in 36 cities throughout the United States and Canada and a large interest in two vaudeville circuits. Another major circuit was that of Alexander Pantages. In his heyday, Pantages owned more than 30 vaudeville theatres and controlled, through management contracts, perhaps 60 more in both the United States and Canada.
At its height, vaudeville played across multiple strata of economic class and auditorium size. On the vaudeville circuit, it was said that if an act would succeed in Peoria, Illinois, it would work anywhere. The question &quot;Will it play in Peoria?&quot; has now become a metaphor for whether something appeals to the American mainstream public. The three most common levels were the &quot;small time&quot; (lower-paying contracts for more frequent performances in rougher, often converted theatres), the &quot;medium time&quot; (moderate wages for two performances each day in purpose-built theatres), and the &quot;big time&quot; (possible remuneration of several thousand dollars per week in large, urban theatres largely patronized by the middle and upper-middle classes). As performers rose in renown and established regional and national followings, they worked their way into the less arduous working conditions and better pay of the big time. The capital of the big time was New York City&#x27;s Palace Theatre (or just &quot;The Palace&quot; in the slang of vaudevillians), built by Martin Beck in 1913 and operated by Keith. Featuring a bill stocked with inventive novelty acts, national celebrities, and acknowledged masters of vaudeville performance (such as comedian and trick roper Will Rogers), the Palace provided what many vaudevillians considered the apotheosis of remarkable careers. A standard show bill would begin with a sketch, follow with a single (an individual male or female performer); next would be an alley-oop (an acrobatic act); then another single, followed by yet another sketch such as a blackface comedy. The acts that followed these for the rest of the show would vary from musicals to jugglers to song-and-dance singles and end with a final extravaganza – either musical or drama – with the full company. These shows would feature such stars as ragtime and jazz pianist Eubie Blake, the famous and magical Harry Houdini, and child star Baby Rose Marie. In the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot;″s article about Vaudeville, it is said that at any given time, Vaudeville was employing over twelve thousand different people throughout its entire industry. Each entertainer would be on the road 42 weeks at a time while working a particular &quot;Circuit&quot; – or an individual theatre chain of a major company.

While the neighborhood character of vaudeville attendance had always promoted a tendency to tailor fare to specific audiences, mature vaudeville grew to feature houses and circuits specifically aimed at certain demographic groups. Black patrons, often segregated into the rear of the second gallery in white-oriented theatres, had their own smaller circuits, as did speakers of Italian and Yiddish (see below). This foreign addition combined with comedy produced such acts as &quot;minstrel shows of antebellum America&quot; and Yiddish theatre. Many ethnic families joined in on this entertainment business, and for them, this traveling lifestyle was simply a continuation of the circumstances that brought them to America. Through these acts, they were able to assimilate themselves into their new home while also bringing bits of their own culture into this new world. White-oriented regional circuits, such as New England&#x27;s &quot;Peanut Circuit&quot;, also provided essential training grounds for new artists while allowing established acts to experiment with and polish new material. At its height, vaudeville was rivaled only by churches and public schools among the nation&#x27;s premiere public gathering places.

Another slightly different aspect of Vaudeville was an increasing interest in the female figure. The previously mentioned ominous idea of &quot;the blue envelopes&quot; led to the phrase &quot;blue&quot; material, which described the provocative subject matter present in many Vaudeville acts of the time. Many managers even saw this scandalous material as a marketing strategy to attract many different audiences. As stated in Andrew Erdman&#x27;s book &quot;Blue Vaudeville&quot;, the Vaudeville stage was &quot;a highly sexualized space ... where unclad bodies, provocative dancers, and singers of &#x27;blue&#x27; lyrics all vied for attention.&quot; Such performances highlighted and objectified the female body as a &quot;sexual delight&quot;, but more than that, historians think that Vaudeville marked a time in which the female body became its own &quot;sexual spectacle&quot;. This sexual image began sprouting everywhere an American went: the shops, a restaurant, the grocery store, etc. The more this image brought in the highest revenue, the more Vaudeville focused on acts involving women. Even acts that were as innocent as a sister act were higher sellers than a good brother act. Consequently, Erdman adds that female Vaudeville performers such as Julie Mackey and Gibson&#x27;s Bathing Girls began to focus less on talent and more on physical appeal through their figure, tight gowns, and other revealing attire. It eventually came as a surprise to audience members when such beautiful women actually possessed talent in addition to their appealing looks. This element of surprise colored much of the reaction to the female entertainment of this time.

== Women == 
In the 1920s, announcements seeking all-girl bands for vaudeville performances appeared in industry publications like &quot;Billboard&quot;, &quot;Variety&quot; and in newspapers. Bands like The Ingenues and The Dixie Sweethearts were well-publicized, while other groups were simply described as &quot;all-girl Revue&quot;. According to Feminist Theory, similar trends in theater and film objectified women, an example of male gaze, as women&#x27;s role in public life was expanding. These expectations for women in the 19th century played a big role in the compelling aspects of vaudeville. Through vaudeville, many women were allowed to join their male counterparts on the stage and found success in their acts.

Leila Marie Koerber, later Marie Dressler, was a Canadian actress who specialized in vaudeville comedy, and eventually won an Academy Award for Best Actress later in her career. Being the daughter of a musician, she moved to the United States of America in her childhood. At just fourteen years old, she left home to begin her career, lying about her age and sending her mother half of her paycheck. Dressler found great success and was known for her comedic timing and physical comedy, like carrying her male co-stars. She eventually worked on Broadway, where she had a great desire to become a serious actress but was advised to remain in comedy. She went on to star in a few films but again returned to vaudeville, her original career.

Another famous vaudevillian actress was Trixie Friganza, originally born Delia O&#x27;Callaghan. She had a famous catchphrase: &quot;You know Trixie with her bag of tricks.&quot; She began her career in opera, performing to help provide for her family. The oldest of three daughters, she wanted to help her family financially but had to do it secretly, as female performers were frowned on at the time. She worked largely in comedy and gained acclaim and success due to her willingness to step into other&#x27;s roles who had fallen ill, and were otherwise unable to perform. In her acts, she often emphasized her plus-size figure, calling herself the &quot;perfect forty-six&quot;. Friganza was also a poet and writer. She used many of her performances as ways to raise money to support the poor or disenfranchised and went on record publicly numerous times to support these social causes. Friganza also spent much of her life fighting for women&#x27;s equality and pushing for self-acceptance for women, both publicly and within themselves, as well as their rights in comparison to men.

Betty Felsen was an American ballerina, vaudeville star, and teacher. She was born on 9 June 1905, in Chicago, IL Betty began taking lessons at a local Chicago ballet school when she was eight years old, and often performed solo dances in shows presented by that school. Just before her tenth birthday in 1916, her parents enrolled her as a ballet student with the Pavley-Oukrainsky Ballet School within the Chicago Opera Association. Then, in 1919 Betty was accepted to be a member of the Chicago Opera’s Pavley-Oukrainsky Ballet corps de ballet. From December 1920 until the fall of 1922 Betty was a ballerina soloist and performed with them throughout North America. Under the name Buddye Felsen, Betty landed a starring dancing role in a new show at Fred Mann’s Million Dollar Rainbo Room in the Rainbo Gardens. The show, &quot;Rainbo Trail&quot;, directed by Frank Westphal, opened on 15 December 1922, and ran until 1 March 1923. In the winter of 1923 Betty began a partnership with Jack Broderick. From then until the end of 927 Broderick &amp; Felsen performed on the B.F. Keith and Pantages vaudeville circuits throughout the U.S. and Canada. Their act evolved from a simple dance act to one with over twenty dancers, an orchestra, and elaborate costumes and sets. From 1925 to 1926 they played for 20 straight weeks at the huge Colony Theater on Broadway in New York City. In 1926 and 1927, they starred in two spectacular musical productions, touring across the United States and Canada, first for about three months in Emil Boreo’s &quot;Mirage de Paris&quot; followed by nine months in their own &quot;Ballet Caprice&quot;. After Jack quit the act near the end of 1927, Betty continued to manage the troupe and, with a new dance partner, toured throughout the northeastern United States for the next six months as Betty Felsen and Company. The final performance of &quot;Ballet Caprice&quot; was on 4 June 1928, at Broadway’s Palace Theater in New York City.

Another famous comedienne, one who brought in thousands of audience members with her signature improvisational skills, was May Irwin. She worked from about 1875 to 1914. Originally born Ada Campbell, she began her life on the stage at thirteen years old following the death of her father. She and her older sister created a singing act called the &quot;Irwin Sisters&quot;. Many years later, their act had taken off and with performances in both vaudeville and burlesque at famous music halls, until Irwin decided to continue her career on her own. She then changed her approach to vaudeville, performing African-American-influenced songs, even later writing her songs. She introduced her signature in vaudeville, &quot;The Bully Song&quot;, which was performed in a Broadway show. This is when she began experimenting with improvisational comedy and quickly found her unique success, even taking her performances global with acts in the U.K.

Sophie Tucker, a Russian Jewish immigrant, was told by promoter Chris Brown that she was not attractive enough to succeed in show business without doing Blackface, so she performed that way for the first two years onstage, until one day she decided to go without it, and achieved much greater success being herself from that point on, especially with her song &quot;Some of These Days&quot;.

Moms Mabley was a comedienne who got her start in Vaudeville and the Chitlin circuits in the 1920s, and ended up with mainstream success in the 20th century. Other 20th century women performers who started in Vaudeville included blues singers Ma Rainey, Ida Cox and Bessie Smith. Women-led touring companies like Black Patti&#x27;s Troubadours, the Whitman Sisters and the Hyers Sisters were popular acts. Other women worked the business side of Vaudeville, like Amanda Thorpe, a white woman who founded a black theater in Virginia, and the Griffin Sisters, who managed several theaters in their efforts to create a Black Vaudeville circuit.

==Black vaudeville==

Black performers and patrons participated in a racially segregated Vaudeville circuit. Though many popular acts like Lewis and Walker, Ernest Hogan, Irving Jones, and the Hyers Sisters played to both white and black audiences, early Vaudeville performances for white audiences were limited to one Black act per show, and performers faced discrimination in restaurants and lodging. Entertainers and entrepreneurs like The Whitman Sisters, Pat Chapelle and John Isham created and managed their own touring companies; others took on theater ownership and management and created Black Vaudeville circuits, as was the case for Sherman H. Dudley and the Griffin Sisters Later, in the 1920s, many bookings were managed by the Theatre Owners Booking Association.

African-Americans challenged the prevailing Blackface stereotypes played by white performers by bringing their own authenticity and style to the stage, composing music, comedy and dance routines and laying the groundwork for distinctly American cultural phenomena like blues, jazz, ragtime and tap dance. Notable Black entertainers in Vaudeville included comedians Bert Williams, and George Walker, dancer/choreographer Ada Overton Walker, and many others. Black songwriters and composers like Bob Cole, Ernest Hogan, Irving Jones, Rosamond Johnson, George Johnson, Tom Lemonier, Gussie L. Davis, and Chris Smith, wrote many of the songs that were popularized onstage by white singers, and paved the way for African-American musical theater.

== Immigrant America ==
In addition to vaudeville&#x27;s prominence as a form of American entertainment, it reflected the newly evolving urban inner-city culture and interaction of its operators and audience. Making up a large portion of immigration to the United States in the mid-19th century, Irish Americans interacted with established Americans, with the Irish becoming subject to discrimination due to their perceived ethnic, physical, and cultural characteristics. The ethnic stereotypes of Irish through their depiction alluded to their newly arrived status as immigrant Americans, with the stereotype portrayed in avenues of entertainment.

Following the Irish immigration wave were several waves in which new immigrants from different backgrounds came in contact with the Irish in America&#x27;s urban centers. Already settled and being native English speakers, Irish Americans took hold of these advantages and began to assert their positions in the immigrant racial hierarchy based on skin tone and assimilation status, cementing job positions that were previously unavailable to them as recently arrived immigrants. As a result, Irish Americans became prominent in vaudeville entertainment as curators and actors, creating a unique ethnic interplay between Irish American use of self-deprecation as humor and their diverse inner city surroundings.

The interactions between newly arrived immigrants and settled immigrants within the backdrop of the unknown American urban landscape allowed vaudeville to be utilized as an avenue for expression and understanding. The often hostile immigrant experience in their new country was now used for comic relief on the vaudeville stage, where stereotypes of different ethnic groups were perpetuated. The crude stereotypes that emerged were easily identifiable not only by their distinct ethnic cultural attributes, but how those attributes differed from the mainstream established American culture and identity.

Coupled with their historical presence on the English stage for comic relief, and as operators and actors of the vaudeville stage, Irish Americans became interpreters of immigrant cultural images in American popular culture. New arrivals found their ethnic group status defined within the immigrant population and in their new country as a whole by the Irish on stage. Unfortunately, the same interactions between ethnic groups within the close living conditions of cities also created racial tensions which were reflected in vaudeville. Conflict between Irish and African Americans saw the promotion of black-face minstrelsy on the stage, purposefully used to place African Americans beneath the Irish in the racial and social urban hierarchy.

Although the Irish had a strong Celtic presence in vaudeville and in the promotion of ethnic stereotypes, the ethnic groups that they were characterizing also utilized the same humor. As the Irish donned their ethnic costumes, groups such as the Chinese, Italians, Germans and Jews utilized ethnic caricatures to understand themselves as well as the Irish. The urban diversity within the vaudeville stage and audience also reflected their societal status, with the working class constituting two-thirds of the typical vaudeville audience.

The ethnic caricatures that now comprised American humor reflected the positive and negative interactions between ethnic groups in America&#x27;s cities. The caricatures served as a method of understanding different groups and their societal positions within their cities. The use of the greenhorn immigrant for comedic effect showcased how immigrants were viewed as new arrivals, but also what they could aspire to be. In addition to interpreting visual ethnic caricatures, the Irish American ideal of transitioning from the shanty to the lace curtain became a model of economic upward mobility for immigrant groups.

== Decline ==

The continued growth of the lower-priced cinema in the early 1910s dealt the heaviest blow to vaudeville. This was similar to the advent of free broadcast television&#x27;s diminishing the cultural and economic strength of the cinema. Cinema was first regularly commercially presented in the US in vaudeville halls. The first public showing of movies projected on a screen took place at Koster and Bial&#x27;s Music Hall in 1896. Lured by greater salaries and less arduous working conditions, many performers and personalities, such as Al Jolson, W. C. Fields, Mae West, Buster Keaton, the Marx Brothers, Jimmy Durante, Bill &quot;Bojangles&quot; Robinson, Edgar Bergen, Fanny Brice, Burns and Allen, and Eddie Cantor, used the prominence gained in live variety performance to vault into the new medium of cinema. In doing so, such performers often exhausted in a few moments of screen time the novelty of an act that might have kept them on tour for several years. Other performers who entered in vaudeville&#x27;s later years, including Jack Benny, Abbott and Costello, Kate Smith, Cary Grant, Bob Hope, Milton Berle, Judy Garland, Rose Marie, Sammy Davis Jr., Red Skelton, Larry Storch and The Three Stooges, used vaudeville only as a launching pad for later careers. They left live performance before achieving the national celebrity of earlier vaudeville stars, and found fame in new venues.

The line between live and filmed performances was blurred by the number of vaudeville entrepreneurs who made more or less successful forays into the movie business. For example, Alexander Pantages quickly realized the importance of motion pictures as a form of entertainment. He incorporated them in his shows as early as 1902. Later, he entered into a partnership with the Famous Players–Lasky, a major Hollywood production company and an affiliate of Paramount Pictures.

By the late 1920s, most vaudeville shows included a healthy selection of cinema. Earlier in the century, many vaudevillians, cognizant of the threat represented by cinema, held out hope that the silent nature of the &quot;flickering shadow sweethearts&quot; would prevent movies from ever overtaking vaudeville in popularity. However, with the introduction of talking pictures in 1926, the burgeoning film studios removed what had remained the chief difference in favor of live theatrical performance: spoken dialogue. Historian John Kenrick wrote:

Top vaudeville stars filmed their acts for one-time pay-offs, inadvertently helping to speed the death of vaudeville. After all, when &quot;small time&quot; theatres could offer &quot;big time&quot; performers on screen at a nickel a seat, who could ask audiences to pay higher amounts for less impressive live talent? The RKO studios took over the famed Orpheum vaudeville circuit and swiftly turned it into a chain of full-time movie theatres. The half-century tradition of vaudeville was effectively wiped out within less than four years.

Inevitably, managers further trimmed costs by eliminating the last of the live performances. Vaudeville also suffered due to the rise of broadcast radio following the greater availability of inexpensive receiver sets later in the decade. Even the hardiest in the vaudeville industry realized the form was in decline; the perceptive understood the condition to be terminal. The standardized film distribution and talking pictures of the 1930s confirmed the end of vaudeville. By 1930, the vast majority of formerly live theatres had been wired for sound, and none of the major studios were producing silent pictures. For a time, the most luxurious theatres continued to offer live entertainment, but most theatres were forced by the Great Depression to economize.

Some in the industry blamed cinema&#x27;s drain of talent from the vaudeville circuits for the medium&#x27;s demise. Others argued that vaudeville had allowed its performances to become too familiar to its famously loyal, now seemingly fickle audiences.

There was no abrupt end to vaudeville, though the form was clearly sagging by the late 1920s. Joseph Kennedy Sr. in a hostile buyout, acquired the Keith-Albee-Orpheum Theatres Corporation (KAO), which had more than 700 vaudeville theatres across the United States which had begun showing movies. The shift of New York City&#x27;s Palace Theatre, vaudeville&#x27;s center, to an exclusively cinema presentation on 16 November 1932, is often considered to have been the death knell of vaudeville.

Though talk of its resurrection was heard during the 1930s and later, the demise of the supporting apparatus of the circuits and the higher cost of live performance made any large-scale renewal of vaudeville unrealistic.

== Architecture ==
The most striking examples of Gilded Age theatre architecture were commissioned by the big time vaudeville magnates and stood as monuments of their wealth and ambition. Examples of such architecture are the theatres built by impresario Alexander Pantages. Pantages often used architect B. Marcus Priteca (1881–1971), who in turn regularly worked with muralist Anthony Heinsbergen. Priteca devised an exotic, neo-classical style that his employer called &quot;Pantages Greek&quot;.

Though classic vaudeville reached a zenith of capitalization and sophistication in urban areas dominated by national chains and commodious theatres, small-time vaudeville included countless more intimate and locally controlled houses. Small-time houses were often converted saloons, rough-hewn theatres, or multi-purpose halls, together catering to a wide range of clientele. Many small towns had purpose-built theatres. A small yet interesting example might include what is called Grange Halls in northern New England, still being used. These are old-fashioned, wooden buildings with creaky, dimly-lit, wooden stages, which were meant to offset the isolation of a farming lifestyle. These stages could offer anything from child performers to contra-dances to visits by Santa to local, musical talent, to homemade foods such as whoopee pies.

== Vaudeville&#x27;s cultural influence and legacy ==
Some of the most prominent vaudevillians successfully made the transition to cinema, though others were not as successful. Some performers such as Bert Lahr fashioned careers out of combining live performance with radio and film roles. Many others later appeared in the Catskill resorts that constituted the &quot;Borscht Belt&quot;.

Vaudeville was instrumental in the success of the newer media of film, radio, and television. Comedies of the new era adopted many of the dramatic and musical tropes of classic vaudeville acts. Film comedies of the 1920s through the 1940s used talent from the vaudeville stage and followed a vaudeville aesthetic of variety entertainment, both in Hollywood and in Asia, including China.

The rich repertoire of the vaudeville tradition was mined for prominent prime-time radio variety shows such as &quot;The Rudy Vallée Show&quot;. The structure of a single host introducing a series of acts became a popular television style and can be seen consistently in the development of television, from &quot;The Milton Berle Show&quot; in 1948 to &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; in the 1980s. The multi-act format had renewed success in shows such as &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot; with Sid Caesar and &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. Today, performers such as Bill Irwin, a MacArthur Fellow and Tony Award-winning actor, are frequently lauded as &quot;New Vaudevillians&quot;.

References to vaudeville and the use of its distinctive argot continue throughout North American popular culture. Words such as &quot;flop&quot; and &quot;gag&quot; were terms created from the vaudeville era and have entered the American idiom. Vaudevillian techniques can commonly be witnessed on television and in movies, remarkably in the recent, worldwide phenomenon of TV shows such as &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;.

In professional wrestling, there was a noted tag team, based in WWE, called The Vaudevillains.

In 2018, noted film director Christopher Annino, maker of a new silent feature film, &quot;Silent Times&quot;, founded Vaudeville Con, a gathering to celebrate the history of vaudeville. The first meeting was held in Pawcatuck, Connecticut.

<doc id="48236" wikidata="Q2420498" url="?curid=48236" title="Saunders Lewis">
<text>Saunders Lewis (born John Saunders Lewis; 15 October 1893 – 1 September 1985) was a Welsh politician, poet, dramatist, Medievalist, and literary critic. Born into a Welsh-speaking ministerial family in Greater Liverpool, Lewis studied in a public school growing up. He rediscovered the importance of both his heritage language and cultural roots while serving as a junior officer in the British Army during the trenches of the First World War. As a vocal supporter of Welsh nationalism, Lewis believed, however, that heritage language revival, cultural nationalism, the dramatic arts, and culture needed to precede Welsh devolution or political independence. If the excessive Anglophilia and colonial mentality traditionally known as Dic Siôn Dafydd was never challenged or defeated, Lewis predicted in 1918, &quot;the Welsh Parliament would [only] be an enlarged County Council.&quot;

Lewis accordingly became a co-founder of Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru (The National Party of Wales), now the Welsh nationalist political party known as Plaid Cymru, at a covert meeting with fellow nationalists during the 1925 National Eisteddfod of Wales. Lewis has been described by Jan Morris as, &quot;the most passionate of twentieth century Welsh patriots&quot;, and as being, &quot;one of the few twentieth century writers in Welsh with a European reputation, but for many Welshmen [he was] chiefly the keeper of the national conscience.&quot; Lewis is usually acknowledged as one of the most vitally important figures in 20th-century Welsh-language literature. He is also widely credited, through his 1962 radio address &quot;Tynged yr Iaith&quot; (&quot;The Fate of the Language&quot;), with almost singlehandedly bringing Welsh back from the brink of language death. 

In 1970, Lewis was nominated for a Nobel Prize in Literature and was appointed as a Knight Commander of the Order of St Gregory by Pope Paul VI. Saunders Lewis&#x27; traditionalist Catholic and distributist beliefs gave him a simultaneously anti-Marxist and anti-colonialist interpretation of Welsh history and a similar vision, influenced by his study of what had he considered to have worked in Irish nationalism, for the future of the Welsh people. In the 21st century, he continues, for this reason to be the target of posthumous attacks by far left politicians from the very party he helped to found. Even so, Lewis was overwhelmingly voted the tenth greatest Welsh hero in the &#x27;100 Welsh Heroes&#x27; poll, released on St. David&#x27;s Day 2004.

==Early life==
John Saunders Lewis was born into a Welsh-speaking family in Wallasey in the Wirral, Cheshire, in the north-west of England, on 15 October 1893. He was the second of three sons of Lodwig Lewis (1859–1933), a Calvinistic Methodist minister, and his wife Mary Margaret (née Thomas, 1862–1900). When he was only six years old, Lewis&#x27;s mother died and his unmarried maternal &quot;Aunt Ellen&quot; (Ellen Elizabeth Thomas) moved into the manse and helped to raise him.

Jan Morris has described Liverpool as the closest there is to a metropolis for the people of North Wales. During a television interview with Aneirin Talfan Davies, Lewis later recalled that this was also true during his childhood, as in and around Liverpool, &quot;there were around about a hundred thousand Welsh-speaking Welsh people... So I was not born in English-speaking England... but into a society that was completely Welsh and Welsh-speaking.&quot;

Even though his father was a scholar, &quot;who liked solitude and study&quot;, and possessed a very large library of Welsh literature, the only Welsh-language books that Saunders Lewis read while growing up were Bishop Morgan&#x27;s Bible, the hymnbook, and Sunday school commentaries.

Lewis attended prestigious English-speaking Liscard High School for Boys where he was bullied at first, due to the fact that what little English he could speak, &quot;was full of Welsh words.&quot; In time, however, Lewis became, &quot;a typical product of the English education system.&quot; He became editor of &quot;The Liscard High School Magazine&quot; and often visited the Wallasey Public Library, where he read contemporary English literature and, as a teenager, was enthusiastic when he discovered the recent mythopoeic poetry and prose reimaginings of Irish folklore and mythology by Irish nationalists William Butler Yeats, John Millington Synge, and Padraic Colum.

Lewis later recalled that through these writers, &quot;I came for the first time to understand what patriotism meant and the spirit of the nation meant. And I soon began to think that things like those , which had seized hold of them in Ireland, were the things I should seize hold of in Wales.&quot;

Lewis&#x27; earliest attempts at writing poems were in English and were inspired by William Wordsworth, Walter Pater, John Wesley and the King James Bible.

==Personal life==
After entering Liverpool University to study English literature in 1911, Lewis is believed to have first met fellow student Margaret Gilcriest, a Roman Catholic from County Wicklow and staunch believer in Irish political and cultural nationalism, in December 1913. Lewis and Gilcriest shared an enthusiasm for literature and in their subsequent courtship by letters, all of which have since been published, there are references to the writings of Dora Sigerson, Katherine Tynan, James Clarence Mangan, Alice Meynell, Emily Lawless, Thomas Kettle, Daniel Corkery, and James Joyce.

After his aunt Ellen persuaded his father &quot;to accept the inevitable&quot;, Lewis and Margaret Gilcriest (1891-1984) were married at Our Lady and St Michael Roman Catholic Church in Workington, Cumberland, on 31 July 1924. They had one child, a daughter.

==First World War==
When the First World War broke out, an idealistic Lewis, feeling inspired by the Aesthete philosophy of Walter Pater to, &quot;savour this experience of life-energy at the utmost&quot;, enlisted in the 3rd Battalion, King&#x27;s Liverpool Regiment on 4 September 1914. British Army records describe Lewis at the time as five-feet and three inches in height, weighing just over seven and a half stone, and as having red hair and grey eyes.

In April 1915, Lewis applied for a commission with the South Wales Borderers and was promoted to full lieutenant in February 1916. The following summer, he was deployed to active service on the Western Front.

During the war, Lewis read the trilogy of novels &quot;The Cult of the Self&quot; (French: &quot;Le Culte du moi&quot;) by the French writer Maurice Barrès. Barrès, a French nationalist, had called since the 1890s, alongside Paul Claudel and Paul Bourget, for, &quot;a &#x27;return&#x27; to national values and traditions.&quot; This volume heavily influenced Lewis&#x27; growing sense of his own Welsh identity and belief in the vital importance of cultural nationalism. 

Furthermore, according to Jelle Krol, Lewis, was amazed to see how his own father&#x27;s recent words of advice were echoed by Barrès, who wrote, &quot;the only way to cultivate your personality as an artist and to develop your own resources, is to go back to your roots&quot;. Lewis accordingly, &quot;discovered the importance of his Welsh roots during his service in France.&quot;

In April 1917, Lewis was severely wounded in action in the left leg and thigh near Gonnelieu, with, &quot;the calf of the leg nearly blown away&quot;, as part of the Battle of Cambrai. Afterwards, Lewis needed more than a year to convalesce, during which his younger brother, Ludwig Lewis, was killed in action on 7 July 1917. Although Lewis desperately wanted to visit and help comfort their grieving father at Swansea, his own battlefield injuries were still far too severe to permit him to travel.

In a 23 July 1918 letter to &quot;The Cambria Daily Leader&quot;, Lewis, as he would do for the remainder of his life, explained why he felt cultural nationalism needed to precede political decolonisation, &quot;In Wales, if we gave ourselves less to party politics and more to the development of our own education and culture, we should make Wales more fitted to have an independent life of her own under Home Rule. And Home Rule, before we have a real national spirit, would mean simply that the Welsh Parliament would be an enlarged County Council.&quot;

== Return to Wales ==
After his return from the trenches, Lewis entered the literary field by arguing that three conditions needed to be met for Welsh literature to become truly meaningful. Firstly, &quot;a more professional attitude to Welsh drama&quot;. Secondly, the reestablishment of a direct link between Welsh culture with that of mainland Europe, and particularly with French culture, and, lastly, a more continual religious and cultural exploration of pre-Reformation Wales by Welsh writers and intellectuals.

In a 22 October 1919 letter to &quot;The Cambria Daily Leader&quot;, called for a revival of drama in the Welsh language, beginning with the improvement of dramas set in the villages, &quot;All the plays we have seen so far describe, and rather idyllically describe, village manners. But village life is more than &#x27;manners&#x27;. It includes memories and traditions and song and even dance and mummery. Village and peasant drama, if it should tell the round truth, must include romance, the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;, the monastery, witchcraft, fairyland, and all the ancient playgrounds of men. Let us widen our field.&quot;

In a letter of 25 October 1919 to the same newspaper, Lewis urged Welsh-language playwrights and the theatre going public to both, &quot;take note of the dramatic history of Europe.&quot; Lewis continued, &quot;And so it seems to me we should begin anew with translation. We should translate into Welsh the plays of the acknowledged masters, of Euripides, of Corneille, of Racine, of Moliere, of Ibsen, of the Spaniards, and we should act them continually; we should learn the classics.&quot;

In 1922, he was appointed as lecturer in Welsh literature at the University College of Wales, Swansea. During his time at Swansea he produced some of his most significant works of literary criticism: &quot;A School of Welsh Augustans&quot; (1924), &quot;Williams Pantycelyn&quot; (1927), and &quot;&quot; (An outline history of Welsh literature) (1932). He continued in this post until his dismissal for a political act of arson at Penyberth, Gwynedd, in 1936.

==Founding Plaid Cymru==
Discussions of the need for a &quot;Welsh party&quot; had been conducted since the 19th century. With the generation or so before 1922 there &quot;had been a marked growth in the constitutional recognition of the Welsh nation&quot;, wrote historian John Davies. By 1924 there were people in Wales &quot;eager to make their nationality the focus of Welsh politics&quot;. Lewis&#x27;s experiences in World War I, and his sympathy for the cause of Irish independence, brought him to Welsh nationalism. He was an advocate for Welsh independence.

In 1924, Lewis founded &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Welsh Movement&quot;) with a small group of fellow nationalists. The group met secretly for the first time in Penarth on 7 January 1924. The group continued to meet in secret throughout 1924 and began drawing up a set of aims and policies intended to &quot;rescue Wales from political and cultural oblivion&quot;.

At around the same time as Lewis formed &#x27;, another group of nationalists formed &#x27; (&quot;The Welsh Home Rule Army&quot;) in Caernarfon. The group was led by Huw Robert Jones, who made contact with Lewis in early 1925 and proposed to form a new political party. 
Lewis met with Jones, Lewis Valentine, Moses Griffith, Fred Jones and D. Edmund Williams in a café called Maes Gwyn during the 1925 National Eisteddfod in Pwllheli, Gwynedd, with the aim of establishing a &quot;Welsh party&quot;. They founded &quot;&quot; (&quot;National Party of Wales&quot;), on 5 August 1925. The principal aim of the party would be to foster a Welsh-speaking Wales. To this end it was agreed that party business be conducted in Welsh, and that members sever all links with other British parties. Lewis insisted on these principles before he would agree to the Pwllheli conference.

According to the 1911 census, out of a population of just under 2.5 million, 43.5% of the total population of Wales spoke Welsh as a primary language. This was a decrease from the 1891 census with 54.4% speaking Welsh out of a population of 1.5 million. With these pre-requisites, Lewis condemned Welsh nationalism&#x27; as it had hitherto existed, a nationalism characterized by inter-party conferences, an obsession with Westminster and a willingness to accept a subservient position for the Welsh language&quot;, wrote Davies. It may be because of these strict positions that the party failed to attract politicians of experience in its early years. However, the party&#x27;s members believed its founding was an achievement in itself; &quot;merely by existing, the party was a declaration of the distinctiveness of Wales&quot;, wrote Davies.

==The Lewis Doctrine 1926–1939==
During the inter-war years, &quot;Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru&quot; was most successful as a social and educational pressure group rather than as a political party. For Saunders Lewis, party president 1926 to 1939, &quot;the chief aim of the party [is] to &#x27;take away from the Welsh their sense of inferiority ... to remove from our beloved country the mark and shame of conquest. Lewis sought to cast &quot;Welshness&quot; into a new context, wrote Davies.

Lewis wished to demonstrate how Welsh heritage was linked as one of the &#x27;founders&#x27; of European civilization. Lewis, a self-described &quot;strong monarchist&quot;, wrote &quot;Civilization is more than an abstraction. It must have a local habitation and name. Here its name is Wales.&quot; Additionally, Lewis strove for the stability, educational and cultural advancement, and economic prosperity of local communities in Y Fro Gymraeg. He also denounced both laissez faire capitalism and Marxism, and instead promoted what he called &quot;&quot;: (lit. &quot;distributing property among the masses&quot;), based on Catholic social teaching, Distributism, and Christian democracy.

==Broadcasting==

Saunders Lewis perceived the early development of BBC radio broadcasting in Wales (which was almost entirely in English) as serious threat to his aim of arresting the decline of the Welsh language (then down to 36%) and turning Wales back into a 100% Welsh-speaking nation. At the same time he also recognised that if he could exert influence and pressure on the BBC, the Corporation could become a useful tool to serve Plaid Cymru&#x27;s political ends. In 1929 he declared it would soon be necessary to arrange for &quot;thousands of Welshmen to be prosecuted for refusing to pay for English programmes&quot;. The following year Lewis was commissioned by E.R. Appleton, Director of the BBC&#x27;s Cardiff radio station, (who had banned broadcasting in Welsh) to broadcast a talk which would &quot;explain Welsh Nationalism&quot;. On vetting the script, which advocated political nationalism in preference to &quot;cultural nationalism&quot;, Appleton decided it was too controversial and inflammatory to be broadcast. In October 1933 the University of Wales Council, which had been lobbying for more Welsh-language broadcasting, appointed a ten-man council to press the case with the BBC. It included David Lloyd George, William George, W. J. Gruffydd and Saunders Lewis – who was continuing to incense the BBC by publicly alleging it was &quot;seeking the destruction of the Welsh language&quot;. The University Committee, which was described by BBC Director General John Reith as &quot;the most unpleasant and unreliable people with whom it has been my misfortune to deal&quot; gained ever more influence on the BBC in Wales not least in the selection of BBC staff – a function delegated to the committee by the corporation. As newspapers of the time noted, appointees seemed primarily drawn from the families of the Welsh-speaking elite including &quot;the son of a professor of Welsh and the offspring of three archdruids&quot;. Saunders Lewis&#x27;s assiduous campaigning over the years was to succeed in cementing an ongoing Plaid Cymru influence within the BBC. When the BBC&#x27;s Welsh Advisory Council was eventually established in 1946, although half its members were Labour, several Plaid Cymru supporters were appointed including Saunders Lewis&#x27;s successor as Plaid Cymru president, Gwynfor Evans.

==&quot;&quot; 1936==

Welsh nationalism was ignited in 1936 when the UK Government settled on establishing an RAF training camp and aerodrome at Penyberth on the Llŷn Peninsula in Gwynedd. The events surrounding the protest, known as &#x27; (&quot;Fire in Llŷn&quot;), helped define &#x27;. The UK Government settled on Llŷn as the site for its training camp after similar proposed sites in Northumberland and Dorset met with protests.

However, Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin refused to hear the case against building this &quot;bombing school&quot; in Wales, despite a deputation representing 500,000 Welsh protesters. Protest against the project was summed up by Lewis when he wrote that the UK Government was intent upon turning one of the &quot;essential homes of Welsh culture, idiom, and literature&quot; into a place for promoting a &quot;barbaric&quot; method of warfare. Construction of this military academy began exactly 400 years after the passage of the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542.

On 8 September 1936, the building was set on fire and in the investigations which followed Saunders Lewis, Lewis Valentine, and D. J. Williams claimed responsibility. They were tried at Caernarfon, where the jury failed to agree on a verdict. The case was then sent to be retried at the Old Bailey in London, where &quot;the Three&quot; were convicted, and sentenced to nine months imprisonment. On their release from Wormwood Scrubs, they were greeted as heroes by 15,000 Welsh people at a pavilion in Caernarfon.

Many Welsh people were angered by the judge&#x27;s scornful treatment of the Welsh language, by the decision to move the trial to London, and by the decision of University College, Swansea, to dismiss Lewis from his post before he had been found guilty. Dafydd Glyn Jones wrote of the fire that it was &quot;the first time in five centuries that Wales struck back at England with a measure of violence... To the Welsh people, who had long ceased to believe that they had it in them, it was a profound shock.&quot;

However, despite the acclaim the events of &#x27; generated, by 1938 Lewis&#x27;s concept of &#x27; (&quot;home ownership&quot;) had been firmly rejected as &quot;not&quot; a fundamental tenet of the party. In 1939 Lewis resigned as &quot;&quot; president, saying that Wales was not ready to accept the leadership of a Roman Catholic.

Although Lewis was the son and grandson of prominent Welsh Calvinistic Methodist ministers, he had converted to Roman Catholicism in 1932.

==Second World War==
Lewis maintained a strict neutrality in his writings through his column &#x27; in &#x27;. It was his attempt at an unbiased interpretation of the causes and events of the war.

Outside of the party&#x27;s initial position on the war, party members were free to choose for themselves their level of support for the war effort. &quot;&quot; was officially neutral regarding involvement the Second World War, which Lewis and other leaders considered a continuation of the First World War. Central to the neutrality policy was the idea that Wales, as a nation, had the right to decide independently on its attitude towards war, along with opposition towards the UK government&#x27;s decision to involve Wales in the conflict. With this challenging and revolutionary policy Lewis hoped a significant number of Welshmen would refuse to join the armed forces.

Lewis and other party members were attempting to strengthen loyalty to the Welsh nation &quot;over the loyalty to the British State&quot;. Lewis argued &quot;The only proof that the Welsh nation exists is that there are some who act as if it did exist.&quot;

However, most party members who claimed conscientious objection status did so in the context of their moral and religious beliefs, rather than on political policy. Of these almost all were exempt from military service. About 24 party members made politics their sole grounds for exemption, of whom 12 received prison sentences. For Lewis, those who objected proved that the assimilation of Wales was &quot;being withstood, even under the most extreme pressures&quot;.

==University of Wales by-election, 1943==
Prior to 1950, universities could elect and return representatives to the House of Commons. The University of Wales seat had become vacant when the constituency&#x27;s Liberal Member of Parliament, Ernest Evans, had been appointed a county court judge in 1942. Lewis was selected to contest the seat for Plaid Cymru in the ensuing 1943 University of Wales by-election.

His opponent was former Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru Deputy Vice-president William John Gruffydd. Gruffydd had been voicing doubts about Lewis&#x27;s ideas since 1933, and by 1943 he had left Plaid Cymru and joined the Liberal Party. His other opponent, independent candidate Alun Talfan Davies, was another former member of Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru who would later become Chairman of the Welsh Liberal Party.

The &quot;brilliant but wayward&quot; Gruffydd was a favorite with Welsh-speaking intellectuals and drew 52.3% of the vote, to Lewis&#x27;s 22.5%.

The election effectively split the Welsh-speaking intelligentsia, and left Lewis embittered with politics, leading him to retreat from direct political involvement. However the experience proved invaluable for Plaid Cymru, as &quot;for the first time they were taken seriously as a political force.&quot; The by-election campaign led directly to &quot;considerable growth&quot; in the party&#x27;s membership.

==&quot; and the 1961 census==
In 1962 Lewis gave a radio speech entitled &quot; (&quot;The Fate of the Language&quot;) in which he predicted the complete extinction of the Welsh language by 2000 unless immediate action was taken.

Lewis&#x27;s radio speech was in response to the 1961 census, which showed a decrease in the percentage of Welsh speakers from 36% in 1931 to 26%, of the population of about 2.5 million. In the census the counties of Merionethshire (Meirionnydd), Anglesey (Ynys Môn), Carmarthenshire (Sir Gaerfyrddin), and Caernarfonshire averaged a 75% proportion of Welsh speakers, with the most significant decreases in the counties of Glamorgan, Flint, and Pembroke.

Assuming, &quot;a gloomy sepulchral tone&quot;, Lewis argued that the Welsh language was, &quot;driven into a corner, ready to be thrown, like a worthless rag, on the dung heap.&quot; The responsibility for this lay, according to Lewis, less in the hands of the British civil service bureaucracy than with the timidity and indifference of the Welsh-speaking people themselves. As he had fully intended it to do, Lewis&#x27; lecture immediately touched a raw nerve.

While Lewis&#x27; had wished to shame Plaid Cymru into more direct action promoting a Welsh language revival, his speech instead led to the formation of &quot;Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg&quot; (&quot;Welsh Language Society&quot;) later that year at a Plaid Cymru summer school held in Pontardawe in Glamorgan. The foundation of &quot;&quot; allowed Plaid Cymru to focus on electoral politics, while the Cymdeithas launched a campaign of civil disobedience aimed at the State&#x27;s policy of coercive Anglicisation.

According to Marcus Tanner, &quot;For the first time, the British government was forced to recognise the existence of a substantial non-Anglophone culture, and to rethink attitudes that had been set in stone since Henry VIII&#x27;s so-called Acts of Union. The new, more conciliatory attitude began under Labour, but continued under the Conservatives.&quot;

Responding to escalating demands for devolution in the United Kingdom, in 1964 the Labour Government established the Welsh Office () and the post of Secretary of State for Wales. The Welsh Language Bill of 1967 granted Welsh equal status to English in the legal system. Further legislation belatedly granted century-old demands for Welsh-medium education.

==Later life and death==
In 1970, Lewis was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature. 

In March 1983, at the age of 89, Saunders Lewis was made an honorary Doctor of Letters of the University of Wales at a ceremony specially conducted at his home in Penarth. The &quot;Catholic Herald&quot;, reporting the honour, noted that in the previous year Lewis had made a plea for the restoration to the Catholic Church in Wales of the Tridentine Mass in Ecclesiastical Latin, rather than the Mass of Paul VI in the &quot;foreign language of English&quot;, which he pointed out was &quot;a later arrival&quot;.

Lewis died at St Winifred&#x27;s Hospital in Cardiff, on 1 September 1985. Lewis&#x27; final request for a Tridentine Requiem Mass in Ecclesiastical Latin was denied by Bishop Daniel Mullins, who personally offered the Mass of Paul VI instead. Following the Funeral Mass, Lewis was buried in the same grave as his wife Margaret in St. Joseph&#x27;s Roman Catholic cemetery in Penarth. Lewis&#x27;s medal as a Knight Commander of the Order of St Gregory, to which he had been appointed by Pope Paul VI, was laid on Lewis&#x27; casket during the funeral ceremony and then buried with him.

==Literary legacy==
His literary works include stage plays, poetry, novels and essays. He wrote mostly in Welsh, but he also wrote some works in English. By the time of his death in 1985 some rated him as amongst the most celebrated of Welsh writers.

Lewis was above all a dramatist. His notable plays include &#x27; (The woman of flowers) (1923–25, revised 1948), &#x27; (The life of St. Germain) (radio play, 1936), &#x27; (1956), &#x27; (Will you have a cigarette?) (1956), &#x27; (Treachery) (1958), &quot;Esther&quot; (1960), and &#x27; (Tomorrow&#x27;s Wales) (1967). His plays drew upon a wide range of material and covered a range of subject matter including Welsh mythology and history, as well as the Christian Bible, although he also wrote plays set in contemporary Wales.

Lewis also translated Samuel Beckett&#x27;s &quot;&quot; from French into Welsh. 

Lewis&#x27; use of poetic forms in the Welsh language included both the use of the traditional 24 strict metres in cynghanedd such as cywyddau and awdlau as well as the Sicilian School&#x27;s sonnet form, &quot;a variety of other rhyming stanzas&quot;, and &quot;full breathed free verse&quot;, which were derived from poetry in other languages.

Following his conversion to the Catholic Church, Lewis also wrote many works of Christian poetry inspired by his new faith. These included poems about the Real Presence in the Blessed Sacrament, a poem that sympathetically describes Saint Joseph&#x27;s crisis of faith, about the traumatic but purgatorial sense of loss experienced by Saint Mary Magdalen after the Crucifixion of Jesus Christ, and about attending the Tridentine Mass on Christmas Day.

Lewis wrote the libretto for Arwel Hughes&#x27;s opera &#x27; (Love&#x27;s the doctor), based on Molière&#x27;s &#x27; (first performance 1960 by Welsh National Opera).

He published two novels, &quot;Monica&quot; (1930) and &#x27; (The daughter of Gwern Hywel) (1964) and two collections of poems as well as numerous articles and essays in various newspapers, magazines and journals. These articles have been collected into volumes including: &#x27; (Following Arthur) (1938), &#x27; (Wednesday essays) (1945), &#x27; (Masters of the centuries) (1973), &#x27; (Masters and their craft) (1981) and &#x27; (Go to it, young men) (1986).

==Political and cultural legacy==
Lewis&#x27;s legacy remains a controversial one and his simultaneously anti-Marxist and anti-colonialist interpretation of Welsh history and distributist vision for the nation&#x27;s future have often been the target of attacks from both the Far Left and the Far Right.

Particularly controversial was his belief, as expressed in &quot;Braslun o Hanes Llenyddiaeth Gymraeg&quot;, a 1932 outline of the history of Welsh-language literature, that the Edwardian conquest of Wales was less damaging to Welsh culture and literature in the long run than the Protestant Reformation, which began under King Henry VIII with the destruction of the independence of the Catholic Church in Wales from control by the State. This was because, according to Lewis, King Henry&#x27;s legacy ensured that subsequent Welsh literature was cut off by religious persecution and government censorship of the bardic profession from their own religious past and from their previously close links to the rest of Europe. 

This was why Lewis urged Welsh-language writers as early as 1919 to read, translate, and draw influence from literature in many other European languages, rather than, as he and many others before him had once done, only reading and emulating literature in English. This is also why he particularly recommended translating into the Welsh-language and arranging regular performances in the theatres of the best French poets and playwrights of the Counter-Reformation and the Baroque era. Despite his own Francophilia, Lewis had also mentioned the importance of combatting the Black Legend by exposing the Welsh people to the literary canon of Spanish Golden Age theatre, whose greatest playwrights included Miguel de Cervantes, Lope de Vega, and Pedro Calderón de la Barca. 

Without mentioning Pope Gregory XI or his 1373 &quot;règle d&#x27;idiom&quot;, command for the Catholic clergy to both learn and communicate with their flocks in the local vernacular, Lewis believed that the coercive Anglicisation of the Welsh people began with the Acts of Union passed under King Henry VIII following his break with the Holy See and commented, &quot;it was this materialistic and pagan triumph that destroyed our Wales.&quot; 

Explaining his preference for the era before King Henry VIII, Lewis wrote, &quot;There was one law and one civilisation throughout Europe, but that law, that civilisation took on many forms and many colours. It did not occur to the rulers of a country to destroy another land&#x27;s civilisation, even when they conquered that land... Despite being conquered, being oppressed, too, and quite cruelly, it (Welsh civilisation) grew upright and without losing the innate qualities of its culture. No doubt Wales often yearned for freedom, but did not fear losing its heritage, nor did it. Because there was one law and one authority throughout Europe, Welsh civilisation was safe, and the Welsh language and the special Welsh way of life and society.&quot; 

For example, historian John Davies writes that, &quot;in a notable article&quot;, Saunders Lewis argued that the Welsh bards of the Medieval era, &quot;were expressing in their poetry a love for a stable, deep-rooted civilization.&quot; Lewis added that the bards &quot;were the leading upholders of the belief that a hierarchical social structure, &#x27;the heritage and tradition of an ancient aristocracy&#x27;, were the necessary precondition of civilized life and that there were deep philosophical roots to this belief.&quot;

Unlike Marxist historians and politicians, Lewis&#x27; intense hostility to the Welsh nobility was not for existing at all, but for abandoning &quot;noblesse oblige&quot; and their traditional duties between the 16th and 18th centuries. Instead of acting, as their ancestors had done, as the Welsh people&#x27;s natural leaders and patrons of Welsh-language literature and the arts, the gentry completely assimilating into the British upper class between the 16th and 18th centuries. Even worse, in Lewis&#x27;s eyes, and was the Welsh gentry of the era&#x27;s widespread practices of rackrenting and political bossism enforced by evicting the families of tenants who voted independently of how they were ordered. A disgusted Lewis wrote about the era, &quot;The gentry betrayed their birthright, behaved like rich bourgeois and denied... the civilisation which they boasted they were cherishing.&quot; 

Despite his many statements to the contrary, Lewis&#x27; allegedly &quot;condescending attitude towards some aspects of the Nonconformist, radical and pacifist traditions of Wales&quot;, also drew extremely harsh criticism from fellow Welsh nationalists such as D. J. Davies, a Marxist Plaid Cymru member. 

Lewis, however, always insisted that his conversion to Catholicism did not keep him from understanding the sensibilities or appreciating the role played in Welsh culture by the Nonconformists. For example, he praised Methodism and Calvinism for preserving the uniqueness of Welsh-language literature and culture against the Anglophilia and linguistic imperialism favoured by the Victorian era Welsh gentry, the Government in Westminster, and the Established Church. 

Along with his careful study of what had worked and what had failed in Irish nationalism, these were the real roots of Lewis&#x27; beliefs that Welsh cultural and language revival, Christian democracy, rural landscape conservation, and an Irish-style Land War -- meaning direct action tactics intended to reduce rents and coerce an Irish-style breakup and sale of the gentry&#x27;s estates to their tenants -- were preferable causes for the Welsh nationalist movement to embrace than Socialism and which have attracted such extreme criticism, both during Lewis&#x27; lifetime and since his death.

In particular, Marxist D.J. Davies denounced Lewis&#x27; calls for Welsh language revival and cultural nationalism. Davies called instead for engaging the English-speaking South Wales valleys. Davies also pointed towards Left Wing political parties in Scandinavia as a model for Plaid Cymru to emulate, and was accordingly far more interested in the &quot;economic implications&quot; of Welsh self-determination.

Left wing historian Geraint H. Jenkins has written, &quot;Lewis was a cold fish. His reedy voice, bow tie, cerebral style and aristocratic contempt for the proletariat were hardly endearing qualities in a political leader, and his conversion to Catholicism lost him the sympathy of fervent Nonconformists. Heavily influenced by the discourse of right-wing French theorists, this profoundly authoritarian figure developed a grand strategy, such as it was, based on the deindustrialization of Wales. Such a scheme was both impractical and unpopular. It caused grave embarrassment to his socialist colleague D. J. Davies, a progressive economist who, writing with force and passion, showed a much better grasp of the economic realities of the time and greater sensitivity towards the plight of working people.

A further source of continuing Left Wing nationalist opposition to Lewis was rooted his expressions of support during the 1930s for Engelbert Dollfuss in the Federal State of Austria, António de Oliveira Salazar in Portugal, and for the Nationalist faction during the Spanish Civil War. Even though Lewis&#x27; support for the latter was rooted in his horror over both the religious persecution of the Catholic Church in Spain and the Red Terror by the Second Spanish Republic, the Far Left political leadership of Plaid Cymru, reportedly, &quot;have never forgiven him.&quot; 

For these reasons, while it was Lewis&#x27;s &quot;brilliance and charismatic appeal&quot; which was firmly associated with &quot;&quot; in the 1930s, it was D. J. Davies&#x27;s Leftist ideology which was adopted by Plaid Cymru after the Second World War. For the remainder of his life, however, Saunders Lewis continued to fight for the causes he cared most deeply about and remained an ideological thorn in the side of the Far Left leadership of the very political party he had helped to found. 

During the post-World War II battles between Plaid Cymru and the Labour Party over political control of South Wales, a hostile 1946 portrait mocked Saunders Lewis for thinking himself to be the &quot;Masaryk of Wales&quot; and that both the United Kingdom and the very concept of Britishness would one day to collapse similarly to the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918. The same writer then sarcastically feigned sympathy for Plaid Cymru, a political party which was allegedly burdened by, &quot;bitterness and hate and the (possibly unintentional) air of physical superiority with which only too many of its members have regarded the bulk of their countrymen.&quot;

During the 1990s, in the midst of a debate over the &quot;Government of Wales Act 1998&quot;, Saunders Lewis was also accused in the House of Commons of having praised Adolf Hitler in 1936 with the words, &quot;At once he fulfilled his promise — a promise which was greatly mocked by the London papers months before that — to completely abolish the financial strength of the Jews in the economic life of Germany.&quot;

In 2001, former Plaid Cymru President Dafydd Elis-Thomas accused Saunders Lewis during a television documentary of being, &quot;lousy as a politician, lousy as a writer, but a good Catholic&quot;.

In contrast, however, Marcus Tanner, while researching in his 2004 book &quot;The Last of the Celts&quot; visited the decaying English-speaking industrial towns, which D.J. Davies once saw as Plaid Cymru&#x27;s future. Pointing out that they were both dominated for decades by Far Left political machines, leading to Soviet-inspired concrete architecture, political corruption, and skyrocketing unemployment, Tanner compared South Wales to the many similarly decaying and disillusioned industrial towns behind the former Iron Curtain after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.

In the same book, Tanner credited the famous 1962 radio lecture by Saunders Lewis with being the primary reason why the Welsh language was, as of 2004, the only one of the Celtic languages that was neither dead or critically endangered.

According to Tanner, &quot;Welsh is more visible than ever before. The moment I drove across the Severn Bridge, signs written in a different language proclaimed that I had entered a different land. It was not like Scotland, where Gaelic bilingual signs were limited to a few Highland areas. As for the Bretons in France, they can only dream of such symbols of recognition. You can live your life in Welsh now, at least in theory. The officials of the North Western Railway, who fired workers on the line from Holyhead to Chester for their inability or unwillingness to speak English in the 1890s, would have a tough time of it now. It is the English-speaking monoglot who faces a problem in trying to work in the public sector, and the language sections of universities do a booming trade in teaching basic Welsh to English professionals who have taken up such posts. Saunders Lewis saved more than most people though possible by his stirring radio address back in 1962.&quot;

Lewis&#x27; legacy is further reflected by the fact that, even in decaying and traditionally English-speaking Welsh colliery and industrial towns and cities, Welsh-medium education is increasingly used as a means of both heritage language learning and reasserting national identity.

For this and many other reasons, Saunders Lewis was overwhelmingly voted by the Welsh people as their 10th greatest national hero in the &#x27;100 Welsh Heroes&#x27; poll, the results of which was released on St. David&#x27;s Day, 2004.

<doc id="48239" wikidata="Q12134" url="?curid=48239" title="Celestial sphere">
<text>In astronomy and navigation, the celestial sphere is an abstract sphere that has an arbitrarily large radius and is concentric to Earth. All objects in the sky can be conceived as being projected upon the inner surface of the celestial sphere, which may be centered on Earth or the observer. If centered on the observer, half of the sphere would resemble a hemispherical screen over the observing location.

The celestial sphere is a conceptual tool used in spherical astronomy to specify the position of an object in the sky without consideration of its linear distance from the observer. The celestial equator divides the celestial sphere into northern and southern hemispheres.

==Description==
Because astronomical objects are at such remote distances, casual observation of the sky offers no information on their actual distances. All celestial objects seem equally far away, as if fixed onto the inside of a sphere with a large but unknown radius, which appears to rotate westward overhead; meanwhile, Earth underfoot seems to remain still. For purposes of spherical astronomy, which is concerned only with the directions to celestial objects, it makes no difference if this is actually the case or if it is Earth that is rotating while the celestial sphere is stationary.

The celestial sphere can be considered to be infinite in radius. This means any point within it, including that occupied by the observer, can be considered the center. It also means that all parallel lines, be they millimetres apart or across the Solar System from each other, will seem to intersect the sphere at a single point, analogous to the vanishing point of graphical perspective. All parallel planes will seem to intersect the sphere in a coincident great circle (a &quot;vanishing circle&quot;).

Conversely, observers looking toward the same point on an infinite-radius celestial sphere will be looking along parallel lines, and observers looking toward the same great circle, along parallel planes. On an infinite-radius celestial sphere, all observers see the same things in the same direction.

For some objects, this is over-simplified. Objects which are relatively near to the observer (for instance, the Moon) will seem to change position against the distant celestial sphere if the observer moves far enough, say, from one side of planet Earth to the other. This effect, known as parallax, can be represented as a small offset from a mean position. The celestial sphere can be considered to be centered at the Earth&#x27;s center, the Sun&#x27;s center, or any other convenient location, and offsets from positions referred to these centers can be calculated.

In this way, astronomers can predict geocentric or heliocentric positions of objects on the celestial sphere, without the need to calculate the individual geometry of any particular observer, and the utility of the celestial sphere is maintained. Individual observers can work out their own small offsets from the mean positions, if necessary. In many cases in astronomy, the offsets are insignificant.

=== Determining location of objects ===
The celestial sphere can thus be thought of as a kind of astronomical shorthand, and is applied very frequently by astronomers. For instance, the &quot;Astronomical Almanac&quot; for 2010 lists the apparent geocentric position of the Moon on January 1 at 00:00:00.00 Terrestrial Time, in equatorial coordinates, as right ascension 6h 57m 48.86s, declination +23° 30&#x27; 05.5&quot;. Implied in this position is that it is as projected onto the celestial sphere; any observer at any location looking in that direction would see the &quot;geocentric Moon&quot; in the same place against the stars. For many rough uses (e.g. calculating an approximate phase of the Moon), this position, as seen from the Earth&#x27;s center, is adequate.

For applications requiring precision (e.g. calculating the shadow path of an eclipse), the &quot;Almanac&quot; gives formulae and methods for calculating the &quot;topocentric&quot; coordinates, that is, as seen from a particular place on the Earth&#x27;s surface, based on the geocentric position. This greatly abbreviates the amount of detail necessary in such almanacs, as each observer can handle their own specific circumstances.

== Greek history on celestial spheres ==
Celestial spheres (or celestial orbs) were envisioned to be perfect and divine entities initially from Greek astronomers such as Aristotle. He composed a set of principles called Aristotelian physics that outlined the natural order and structure of the world. Like other Greek astronomers, Aristotle also thought the &quot;...celestial sphere as the frame of reference for their geometric theories of the motions of the heavenly bodies&quot;. With his adoption of Eudoxus of Cnidus&#x27; theory, Aristotle had described celestial bodies within the Celestial sphere to be filled with pureness, perfect and quintessence (the fifth element that was known to be divine and purity according to Aristotle). Aristotle deemed the Sun, Moon, planets and the fixed stars to be perfectly concentric spheres in a superlunary region above the sublunary sphere. Aristotle had asserted that these bodies (in the superlunary region) are perfect and cannot be corrupted by any of the classical elements: fire, water, air, and earth. Corruptible elements were only contained in the sublunary region and incorruptible elements were in the superlunary region of Aristotle&#x27;s geocentric model. Aristotle had the notion that celestial orbs must exhibit celestial motion (a perfect circular motion) that goes on for eternity. He also argued that the behavior and property follows strictly to a principle of natural place where the quintessential element moves freely of divine will, while other elements, fire, air, water and earth, are corruptible, subject to change and imperfection. Aristotle&#x27;s key concepts rely on the nature of the five elements distinguishing the Earth and the Heavens in the astronomical reality, taking Eudoxus&#x27;s model of separate spheres.

Numerous discoveries from Aristotle and Eudoxus (approximately 395 B.C. to 337 B.C.) have sparked differences in both of their models and sharing similar properties simultaneously. Aristotle and Eudoxus claimed two different counts of spheres in the heavens. According to Eudoxus, there were only 27 spheres in the heavens, while there are 55 spheres in Aristotle&#x27;s model. Eudoxus attempted to construct his model mathematically from a treatise known as &quot;On Speeds&quot; () and asserted the shape of the hippopede or lemniscate was associated with planetary retrogression. Aristotle emphasized that the speed of the celestial orbs is unchanging, like the heavens, while Eudoxus emphasized that the orbs are in a perfect geometrical shape. Eudoxus&#x27;s spheres would produce undesirable motions to the lower region of the planets, while Aristotle introduced unrollers between each set of active spheres to counteract the motions of the outer set, or else the outer motions will be transferred to the outer planets. Aristotle would later observe &quot;...the motions of the planets by using the combinations of nested spheres and circular motions in creative ways, but further observations kept undoing their work&quot;.

Aside from Aristotle and Eudoxus, Empedocles gave an explanation that the motion of the heavens, moving about it at divine (relatively high) speed, puts the Earth in a stationary position due to the circular motion preventing the downward movement from natural causes. Aristotle criticized Empedocles&#x27;s model, arguing that all heavy objects go towards the Earth and not the whirl itself coming to Earth. He ridiculed it and claimed that Empedocles&#x27;s statement was extremely absurd. Anything that defied the motion of natural place and the unchanging heavens (including the celestial spheres) was criticized immediately by Aristotle.

==Celestial coordinate systems==
These concepts are important for understanding celestial coordinate systems, frameworks for measuring the positions of objects in the sky. Certain reference lines and planes on Earth, when projected onto the celestial sphere, form the bases of the reference systems. These include the Earth&#x27;s equator, axis, and orbit. At their intersections with the celestial sphere, these form the celestial equator, the north and south celestial poles, and the ecliptic, respectively. As the celestial sphere is considered arbitrary or infinite in radius, all observers see the celestial equator, celestial poles, and ecliptic at the same place against the background stars.

From these bases, directions toward objects in the sky can be quantified by constructing celestial coordinate systems. Similar to geographic longitude and latitude, the equatorial coordinate system specifies positions relative to the celestial equator and celestial poles, using right ascension and declination. The ecliptic coordinate system specifies positions relative to the ecliptic (Earth&#x27;s orbit), using ecliptic longitude and latitude. Besides the equatorial and ecliptic systems, some other celestial coordinate systems, like the galactic coordinate system, are more appropriate for particular purposes.

==History==
The ancient Greeks assumed the literal truth of stars attached to a celestial sphere, revolving about the Earth in one day, and a fixed Earth. 
The Eudoxan planetary model, on which the Aristotelian and Ptolemaic models were based, was the first geometric explanation for the &quot;wandering&quot; of the classical planets. The outermost of these &quot;crystal spheres&quot; was thought to carry the fixed stars. Eudoxus used 27 concentric spherical solids to answer Plato&#x27;s challenge: &quot;By the assumption of what uniform and orderly motions can the apparent motions of the planets be accounted for?&quot;
Anaxagoras in the mid 5th century BC was the first known philosopher to suggest that the stars were &quot;fiery stones&quot; too far away for their heat to be felt. Similar ideas were expressed by Aristarchus of Samos. However, they did not enter mainstream European and Islamic astronomy of the late ancient and medieval period.
Copernican heliocentrism did away with the planetary spheres, but it did not necessarily preclude the existence of a sphere for the fixed stars. The first astronomer of the European Renaissance to suggest that the stars were distant suns was Giordano Bruno in his &quot;De l&#x27;infinito universo et mondi&quot; (1584). This idea was among the charges, albeit not in a prominent position, brought against him by the Inquisition.
The idea became mainstream in the later 17th century, especially following the publication of &quot;Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds&quot; by Bernard Le Bovier de Fontenelle (1686), and by the early 18th century it was the default working assumptions in stellar astronomy.

==Star globe==
A celestial sphere can also refer to a physical model of the celestial sphere or celestial globe.
Such globes map the constellations on the &quot;outside&quot; of a sphere, resulting in a mirror image of the constellations as seen from Earth. The oldest surviving example of such an artifact is the globe of the Farnese Atlas sculpture, a 2nd-century copy of an older (Hellenistic period, ca. 120 BCE) work.

==Bodies other than Earth==

Observers on other worlds would, of course, see objects in that sky under much the same conditions – as if projected onto a dome. Coordinate systems based on the sky of that world could be constructed. These could be based on the equivalent &quot;ecliptic&quot;, poles and equator, although the reasons for building a system that way are as much historic as technical.

<text>Raphael Aloysius &quot;R. A.&quot; Lafferty (November 7, 1914March 18, 2002) was an American science fiction and fantasy writer known for his original use of language, metaphor, and narrative structure. Lafferty also wrote a set of four autobiographical novels, a history book, and several novels of historical fiction.

==Biography==

Lafferty was born on November 7, 1914, in Neola, Iowa to devoutly Catholic parents, Hugh David Lafferty, a broker dealing in oil leases and royalties, and Julia Mary ( Burke), a teacher. He was born the youngest of five siblings. His first name, Raphael, derived from the day on which he was expected to be born (the Feast of St. Raphael). When he was 4, his family moved to Perry, Oklahoma. 

He graduated from Cascia Hall, and came of age in the early years of the Great Depression. He later attended night school at the University of Tulsa for two years starting in 1933, mostly studying Math and German, but left before graduating. He then began to work for Clark Electric Co. in Tulsa and, during this period (1939–42), he attended the International Correspondence School.

Lafferty lived most of his life in Tulsa with his sister, Anna Lafferty. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1942. After training in Texas, North Carolina, Florida, and California, he was sent to the South Pacific Area, serving in Australia, New Guinea, Morotai, and the Philippines. When he left the Army in 1946, he had become a 1st Sergeant serving as a staff sergeant and had received an Asiatic–Pacific Campaign Medal. He never married.

Lafferty did not begin writing until the 1950s, but he wrote thirty-two novels and more than two hundred short stories, most of them at least nominally science fiction. His first published story was &quot;The Wagons&quot; in the &quot;New Mexico Quarterly Review&quot; in 1959. His first published science fiction story was &quot;Day of the Glacier&quot;, in &quot;The Original Science Fiction Stories&quot; in 1960, and his first published novel was &quot;Past Master&quot; in 1968.

Until 1971, Lafferty worked as an electrical engineer. After that, he spent his time writing until around 1980, when his output declined due to a stroke. He stopped writing regularly in 1984. 

In 1994, he suffered an even more severe stroke. He died on March 18, 2002, aged 87 in a nursing home in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma. His collected papers, artifacts, and ephemera were donated to the University of Tulsa&#x27;s McFarlin Library, Department of Special Collections and University Archives. Other manuscripts are housed in the University of Iowa&#x27;s Library special collections department.

Lafferty&#x27;s funeral took place at Christ the King Catholic Church in Tulsa, where he regularly attended daily Mass. He is buried at St. Rose Catholic Cemetery in Perry.

==Selected works==

Lafferty&#x27;s quirky prose drew from traditional storytelling styles, largely from the Irish and Native American, and his shaggy-dog characters and tall tales are unique in science fiction. Little of Lafferty&#x27;s writing is considered typical of the genre. His stories are closer to tall tales than traditional science fiction and are deeply influenced by his Catholic beliefs; &quot;Fourth Mansions&quot;, for example, draws on &quot;The Interior Mansions&quot; of Teresa of Ávila.

His writings, both topically and stylistically, are not easy to categorize. Plot is frequently secondary to other elements of Lafferty&#x27;s writing. While this style has resulted in a loyal cult following, it causes some readers to give up reading his work. Not all of Lafferty&#x27;s work was science fiction or fantasy. His novel &quot;Okla Hannali&quot; (1972), published by University of Oklahoma Press, tells the story of the Choctaw in Mississippi, and after the Trail of Tears, in Oklahoma, through an account of the larger-than-life character Hannali and his large family. This novel was thought of highly by the novelist Dee Brown, author of &quot;Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee&quot; (1970), who on the back cover of the edition published by the University of Oklahoma Press, writes &quot;The history of the Choctaw Indians has been told before and is still being told, but it has never been told in the way Lafferty tells it ... Hannali is a buffalo bull of a man who should become one of the enduring characters in the literature of the American Indian.&quot; He also wrote, &quot;It is art applied to history so that the legend of the Choctaws, their great and small men, their splendid humor, and their tragedies are filled with life and breath.&quot;

Lafferty&#x27;s work is represented by Virginia Kidd Literary Agency, which holds a cache of his unpublished manuscripts. This includes over a dozen novels, such as &quot;In The Akrokeraunian Mountains&quot; and &quot;Iron Tongue of Midnight&quot;, as well as about eighty short stories and a handful of essays.

==Awards and recognition==
Lafferty received Hugo Award nominations for &quot;Past Master&quot;, &quot;Continued on Next Rock&quot;, &quot;Sky&quot;, and &quot;Eurema&#x27;s Dam&quot;, the last of which won the Best Short Story Hugo in 1973 (shared with Frederik Pohl and Cyril M. Kornbluth&#x27;s &quot;The Meeting&quot;).

He received Nebula Award nominations for &quot;In Our Block&quot;, &quot;Slow Tuesday Night&quot;, &quot;Past Master&quot;, &quot;Fourth Mansions&quot;, &quot;Continued on Next Rock&quot;, &quot;Entire And Perfect Chrysolite&quot;, and &quot;The Devil is Dead&quot;. He never received a Nebula award.

His collection &quot;Lafferty in Orbit&quot; was nominated for a World Fantasy Award, and in 1990, Lafferty received a World Fantasy Lifetime Achievement Award. His 1992 collection &quot;Iron Tears&quot; was also a finalist for the Philip K. Dick Award. In 2002, he received the Cordwainer Smith Foundation&#x27;s Rediscovery award.

The Oklahoma Department of Libraries granted him the Arrell Gibson Lifetime Achievement Award in 1995.

&quot;Fourth Mansions&quot; was also named by David Pringle as one of his selections for &quot;Modern Fantasy: The 100 Best Novels&quot;.

==Writing style==
&quot;[Once a] French publisher nervously asked whether Lafferty minded being compared to G. K. Chesterton (another Catholic author), and there was a terrifying silence that went on and on. Was the great man hideously offended? Eventually, very slowly, he said: &#x27;You&#x27;re on the right track, kid,&#x27; and wandered away.&quot;

In his 2006 short story collection &quot;Fragile Things&quot;, Neil Gaiman includes a short story called &quot;Sunbird&quot; written in the style of Lafferty. In the introduction, he says this about Lafferty: There was a writer from Tulsa, Oklahoma (he died in 2002), who was, for a little while in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the best short story writer in the world. His name was R. A. Lafferty, and his stories were unclassifiable and odd and inimitable -- you knew you were reading a Lafferty story within a sentence. When I was young I wrote to him, and he wrote back.&lt;br&gt;&quot;Sunbird&quot; was my attempt to write a Lafferty story, and it taught me a number of things, mostly how much harder they are than they look...

Gaiman and Lafferty had corresponded for several years during Gaiman&#x27;s adolescence; he remembered Lafferty&#x27;s letters as &quot;filled with typical cock-eyed Lafferty humour and observations, wise and funny and sober all at once.&quot;

Per &quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot;: He has fairly been described as a writer of tall tales, as a cartoonist, as an author whose tone was fundamentally oral; his conservative Catholicism has been seen as permeating every word he wrote (or has been ignored); he has been seen as a ransacker of old Mythologies, and as a flippant generator of new ones; he clearly delighted in a vision of the world as being irradiated by conspiracies both godly and devilish, but at times paid scant attention to the niceties of plotting; he has been understood by some as essentially light-hearted and by others as a solitary, stringent moralist; he was technically inventive, but lunged constantly into a slapdash sublime only skittishly evocative, and only occasionally, of anything like the traditional Sense of Wonder; his skill in the deploying of various rhetorical narrative voices was manifest, but these voices were sometimes choked in baroque flamboyance... He and Gene Wolfe have more than a shared faith in common.

==Archives==
In March 2011, it was announced in &quot;Locus&quot; that the copyrights to 29 Lafferty novels and 225 short stories were up for sale. The literary estate was soon thereafter purchased by the magazine&#x27;s nonprofit foundation, under the auspices of board member Neil Gaiman.

<text>In mathematics, specifically in group theory, the concept of a semidirect product is a generalization of a direct product. It is usually denoted with the symbol . There are two closely related concepts of semidirect product: 
* an &quot;inner&quot; semidirect product is a particular way in which a group can be made up of two subgroups, one of which is a normal subgroup. 
* an &quot;outer&quot; semidirect product is a way to construct a new group from two given groups by using the Cartesian product as a set and a particular multiplication operation. 
As with direct products, there is a natural equivalence between inner and outer semidirect products, and both are commonly referred to simply as &quot;semidirect products&quot;.

For finite groups, the Schur–Zassenhaus theorem provides a sufficient condition for the existence of a decomposition as a semidirect product (also known as splitting extension).

== Inner semidirect product definitions ==

Given a group with identity element , a subgroup , and a normal subgroup formula_1, the following statements are equivalent:
* is the product of subgroups, , and these subgroups have trivial intersection: .
* For every , there are unique and such that .
* The composition of the natural embedding with the natural projection is an isomorphism between and the quotient group .
* There exists a homomorphism that is the identity on and whose kernel is . In other words, there is a split exact sequence formula_2 of groups (which is also known as a split extension of formula_3 by formula_4).
If any of these statements holds (and hence all of them hold, by their equivalence), we say is the semidirect product of and , written
: formula_5 or formula_6
or that &quot;splits&quot; over ; one also says that is a semidirect product of acting on , or even a semidirect product of and . To avoid ambiguity, it is advisable to specify which is the normal subgroup.

If formula_5, then there is a group homomorphism formula_8 given by formula_9, and for formula_10, we have formula_11.

== Inner and outer semidirect products ==

===Inner semidirect product===
Let us first consider the inner semidirect product. In this case, for a group formula_12, consider a normal subgroup and another subgroup (not necessarily normal). Assume that the
conditions on the list above hold. Let formula_13 denote the group of all automorphisms of , which is a group under composition. Construct a group homomorphism formula_14 defined by conjugation, 
: formula_15, for all in and in . 
In this way we can construct a group formula_16 with group operation defined as 
: formula_17 for in and in . 
The subgroups and determine up to isomorphism, as we will show later. In this way, we can construct the group from its subgroups. This kind of construction is called an inner semidirect product (also known as internal semidirect product).

===Outer semidirect product===
Let us now consider the outer semidirect product. Given any two groups and and a group homomorphism , we can construct a new group , called the outer semidirect product of and with respect to , defined as follows:
This defines a group in which the identity element is and the inverse of the element is . Pairs form a normal subgroup isomorphic to , while pairs form a subgroup isomorphic to . The full group is a semidirect product of those two subgroups in the sense given earlier.

Conversely, suppose that we are given a group with a normal subgroup and a subgroup , such that every element of may be written uniquely in the form where lies in and lies in . Let be the homomorphism (written ) given by
: formula_15
for all .

Then is isomorphic to the semidirect product . The isomorphism is well defined
by due to the uniqueness of the decomposition .

In , we have 
: formula_19
Thus, for and we obtain
: formula_20
which proves that is a homomorphism. Since is obviously an epimorphism and monomorphism, then it is indeed an isomorphism. This also explains the definition of the multiplication rule in .

The direct product is a special case of the semidirect product. To see this, let be the trivial homomorphism (i.e., sending every element of to the identity automorphism of ) then is the direct product .

A version of the splitting lemma for groups states that a group is isomorphic to a semidirect product of the two groups and if and only if there exists a short exact sequence
: formula_21
and a group homomorphism such that , the identity map on . In this case, is given by , where
:formula_22

== Examples ==

=== Dihedral group ===
The dihedral group with elements is isomorphic to a semidirect product of the cyclic groups and . Here, the non-identity element of acts on by inverting elements; this is an automorphism since is abelian. The presentation for this group is:
:formula_23

==== Cyclic groups ====
More generally, a semidirect product of any two cyclic groups with generator and with generator is given by one extra relation, , with and coprime, and formula_24; that is, the presentation:
: formula_25

If and are coprime, is a generator of and , hence the presentation:
: formula_26
gives a group isomorphic to the previous one.

=== Holomorph of a group ===
One canonical example of a group expressed as a semidirect product is the holomorph of a group. This is defined asformula_27where formula_28 is the automorphism group of a group formula_12 and the structure map formula_30 comes from the right action of formula_28 on formula_12. In terms of multiplying elements, this gives the group structureformula_33

=== Fundamental group of the Klein bottle ===
The fundamental group of the Klein bottle can be presented in the form
: formula_34
and is therefore a semidirect product of the group of integers with addition, formula_35, with formula_35. The corresponding homomorphism is given by .

=== Upper triangular matrices ===
The group formula_37 of upper triangular matrices with non-zero determinant in an arbitrary field, that is with non-zero entries on the diagonal, has a decomposition into the semidirect product
formula_38 where formula_39 is the subgroup of matrices with only formula_40s on the diagonal, which is called the upper unitriangular matrix group, and formula_41 is the subgroup of diagonal matrices.
The group action of formula_41 on formula_39 is induced by matrix multiplication. If we set
: formula_44
and
: formula_45
then their matrix product is
: formula_46
This gives the induced group action formula_47
: formula_48
A matrix in formula_37 can be represented by matrices in formula_39 and formula_41. Hence formula_38.

=== Group of isometries on the plane ===
The Euclidean group of all rigid motions (isometries) of the plane (maps such that the Euclidean distance between and equals the distance between and for all and in formula_53) is isomorphic to a semidirect product of the abelian group formula_53 (which describes translations) and the group of orthogonal matrices (which describes rotations and reflections that keep the origin fixed). Applying a translation and then a rotation or reflection has the same effect as applying the rotation or reflection first and then a translation by the rotated or reflected translation vector (i.e. applying the conjugate of the original translation). This shows that the group of translations is a normal subgroup of the Euclidean group, that the Euclidean group is a semidirect product of the translation group and , and that the corresponding homomorphism is given by matrix multiplication: .

=== Orthogonal group O(&quot;n&quot;) ===
The orthogonal group of all orthogonal real matrices (intuitively the set of all rotations and reflections of -dimensional space that keep the origin fixed) is isomorphic to a semidirect product of the group (consisting of all orthogonal matrices with determinant , intuitively the rotations of -dimensional space) and . If we represent as the multiplicative group of matrices , where is a reflection of -dimensional space that keeps the origin fixed (i.e., an orthogonal matrix with determinant representing an involution), then is given by for all &quot;H&quot; in and in . In the non-trivial case ( is not the identity) this means that is conjugation of operations by the reflection (in 3-dimensional space a rotation axis and the direction of rotation are replaced by their &quot;mirror image&quot;).

=== Semi-linear transformations ===
The group of semilinear transformations on a vector space over a field formula_55, often denoted , is isomorphic to a semidirect product of the linear group (a normal subgroup of ), and the automorphism group of formula_55.

=== Crystallographic groups ===
In crystallography, the space group of a crystal splits as the semidirect product of the point group and the translation group if and only if the space group is . Non-symmorphic space groups have point groups that are not even contained as subset of the space group, which is responsible for much of the complication in their analysis.

== Non-examples ==
Of course, no simple group can be expressed as a semidirect product (because they do not have nontrivial normal subgroups), but there are a few common counterexamples of groups containing a non-trivial normal subgroup that nonetheless cannot be expressed as a semidirect product. Note that although not every group formula_12 can be expressed as a split extension of formula_3 by formula_59, it turns out that such a group can be embedded into the wreath product formula_60 by the universal embedding theorem.

=== Z4 ===
The cyclic group formula_61 is not a simple group since it has a subgroup of order 2, namely formula_62 is a subgroup and their quotient is formula_63, so there is an extension formula_64If instead this extension is split, then the group formula_12 informula_66would be isomorphic to formula_67.

=== Q8 ===
The group of the eight quaternions formula_68 where formula_69 and formula_70, is another example of a group which has non-trivial normal subgroups yet is still not split. For example, the subgroup generated by formula_71 is isomorphic to formula_61 and is normal. It also has a subgroup of order formula_73 generated by formula_74. This would mean formula_75 would have to be a split extension in the following &quot;hypothetical&quot; exact sequence of groups: formula_76, but such an exact sequence does not exist. This can be shown by computing the first group cohomology group of formula_63 with coefficients in formula_61, so formula_79 and noting the two groups in these extensions are formula_80 and the dihedral group formula_81. But, as neither of these groups is isomorphic with formula_75, the quaternion group is not split. This non-existence of isomorphisms can be checked by noting the trivial extension is abelian while formula_75 is non-abelian, and noting the only normal subgroups are formula_63 and formula_61, but formula_75 has three subgroups isomorphic to formula_61.

== Properties ==
If is the semidirect product of the normal subgroup and the subgroup , and both and are finite, then the order of equals the product of the orders of and . This follows from the fact that is of the same order as the outer semidirect product of and , whose underlying set is the Cartesian product .

=== Relation to direct products ===
Suppose is a semidirect product of the normal subgroup and the subgroup . If is also normal in , or equivalently, if there exists a homomorphism that is the identity on with kernel , then is the direct product of and .

The direct product of two groups and can be thought of as the semidirect product of and with respect to for all in .

Note that in a direct product, the order of the factors is not important, since is isomorphic to . This is not the case for semidirect products, as the two factors play different roles.

Furthermore, the result of a (proper) semidirect product by means of a non-trivial homomorphism is never an abelian group, even if the factor groups are abelian.

=== Non-uniqueness of semidirect products (and further examples) ===
As opposed to the case with the direct product, a semidirect product of two groups is not, in general, unique; if and are two groups that both contain isomorphic copies of as a normal subgroup and as a subgroup, and both are a semidirect product of and , then it does &quot;not&quot; follow that and are isomorphic because the semidirect product also depends on the choice of an action of on .

For example, there are four non-isomorphic groups of order 16 that are semidirect products of and ; in this case, is necessarily a normal subgroup because it has index 2. One of these four semidirect products is the direct product, while the other three are non-abelian groups:
* the dihedral group of order 16
* the quasidihedral group of order 16
* the Iwasawa group of order 16

If a given group is a semidirect product, then there is no guarantee that this decomposition is unique. For example, there is a group of order 24 (the only one containing six elements of order 4 and six elements of order 6) that can be expressed as semidirect product in the following ways: .

=== Existence ===

In general, there is no known characterization (i.e., a necessary and sufficient condition) for the existence of semidirect products in groups. However, some sufficient conditions are known, which guarantee existence in certain cases. For finite groups, the Schur–Zassenhaus theorem guarantees existence of a semidirect product when the order of the normal subgroup is coprime to the order of the quotient group.

For example, the Schur–Zassenhaus theorem implies the existence of a semidirect product among groups of order 6; there are two such products, one of which is a direct product, and the other a dihedral group. In contrast, the Schur–Zassenhaus theorem does not say anything about groups of order 4 or groups of order 8 for instance.

== Generalizations ==

Within group theory, the construction of semidirect products can be pushed much further. The Zappa–Szép product of groups is a generalization that, in its internal version, does not assume that either subgroup is normal. 

There is also a construction in ring theory, the crossed product of rings. This is constructed in the natural way from the group ring for a semidirect product of groups. The ring-theoretic approach can be further generalized to the semidirect sum of Lie algebras. 

For geometry, there is also a crossed product for group actions on a topological space; unfortunately, it is in general non-commutative even if the group is abelian. In this context, the semidirect product is the &quot;space of orbits&quot; of the group action. The latter approach has been championed by Alain Connes as a substitute for approaches by conventional topological techniques; c.f. noncommutative geometry. 

The semidirect product is a special case of the Grothendieck construction in category theory. Specifically, an action of formula_3 on formula_4 (respecting the group, or even just monoid structure) is the same thing as a functor
: formula_90
from the groupoid formula_91 associated to &quot;H&quot; (having a single object *, whose endomorphisms are &quot;H&quot;) to the category of categories such that the unique object in formula_91 is mapped to formula_93. The Grothendieck construction of this functor is equivalent to formula_94, the (groupoid associated to) semidirect product.

=== Groupoids ===

Another generalization is for groupoids. This occurs in topology because if a group acts on a space it also acts on the fundamental groupoid of the space. The semidirect product is then relevant to finding the fundamental groupoid of the orbit space . For full details see Chapter 11 of the book referenced below, and also some details in semidirect product in ncatlab.

=== Abelian categories ===
Non-trivial semidirect products do &quot;not&quot; arise in abelian categories, such as the category of modules. In this case, the splitting lemma shows that every semidirect product is a direct product. Thus the existence of semidirect products reflects a failure of the category to be abelian.

== Notation ==

Usually the semidirect product of a group acting on a group (in most cases by conjugation as subgroups of a common group) is denoted by or . However, some sources may use this symbol with the opposite meaning. In case the action should be made explicit, one also writes . One way of thinking about the symbol is as a combination of the symbol for normal subgroup () and the symbol for the product (). Barry Simon, in his book on group representation theory, employs the unusual notation formula_95 for the semidirect product.

Unicode lists four variants:

Here the Unicode description of the rtimes symbol says &quot;right normal factor&quot;, in contrast to its usual meaning in mathematical practice.

In LaTeX, the commands \rtimes and \ltimes produce the corresponding characters. With the AMS symbols package loaded, \leftthreetimes produces ⋋ and \rightthreetimes produces ⋌.

<text>Fractal art is a form of algorithmic art created by calculating fractal objects and representing the calculation results as still digital images, animations, and media. Fractal art developed from the mid-1980s onwards. It is a genre of computer art and digital art which are part of new media art. The mathematical beauty of fractals lies at the intersection of generative art and computer art. They combine to produce a type of abstract art.

Fractal art (especially in the western world) is rarely drawn or painted by hand. It is usually created indirectly with the assistance of fractal-generating software, iterating through three phases: setting parameters of appropriate fractal software; executing the possibly lengthy calculation; and evaluating the product. In some cases, other graphics programs are used to further modify the images produced. This is called post-processing. Non-fractal imagery may also be integrated into the artwork. The Julia set and Mandelbrot sets can be considered as icons of fractal art.

It was assumed that fractal art could not have developed without computers because of the calculative capabilities they provide. Fractals are generated by applying iterative methods to solving non-linear equations or polynomial equations. Fractals are any of various extremely irregular curves or shapes for which any suitably chosen part is similar in shape to a given larger or smaller part when magnified or reduced to the same size.

==Types==

There are many different kinds of fractal images. They can be subdivided into several groups. 
* Fractals derived from standard geometry by using iterative transformations on an initial common figure like a straight line (the Cantor dust or the von Koch curve), a triangle (the Sierpinski triangle), or a cube (the Menger sponge). The first fractal figures invented near the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries belong to this group.
* IFS (iterated function systems)
* Strange attractors
* Fractal flame
* L-system fractals
* Fractals created by the iteration of complex polynomials.
* Newton fractals, including Nova fractals
* Fractals generated over quaternions and other Cayley-Dickson algebras
* Fractal terrains generated by random fractal processes
* Mandelbulbs are a form of three dimensional fractal.

Fractal Expressionism is a term used to differentiate traditional visual art that incorporates fractal elements such as self-similarity for example. Perhaps the best example of fractal expressionism is found in Jackson Pollock&#x27;s dripped patterns. They have been analysed and found to contain a fractal dimension which has been attributed to his technique.

==Techniques==
Fractals of all kinds have been used as the basis for digital art and animation. High resolution color graphics became increasingly available at scientific research labs in the mid-1980s. Scientific forms of art, including fractal art, have developed separately from mainstream culture. Starting with 2-dimensional details of fractals, such as the Mandelbrot Set, fractals have found artistic application in fields as varied as texture generation, plant growth simulation, and landscape generation.

Fractals are sometimes combined with evolutionary algorithms, either by iteratively choosing good-looking specimens in a set of random variations of a fractal artwork and producing new variations, to avoid dealing with cumbersome or unpredictable parameters, or collectively, as in the Electric Sheep project, where people use fractal flames rendered with distributed computing as their screensaver and &quot;rate&quot; the flame they are viewing, influencing the server, which reduces the traits of the undesirables, and increases those of the desirables to produce a computer-generated, community-created piece of art.

Many fractal images are admired because of their perceived harmony. This is typically achieved by the patterns which emerge from the balance of order and chaos. Similar qualities have been described in Chinese painting and miniature trees and rockeries.

==Landscapes==
The first fractal image that was intended to be a work of art was probably the famous one on the cover of &quot;Scientific American&quot;, August 1985. This image showed a landscape formed from the potential function on the domain outside the (usual) Mandelbrot set. However, as the potential function grows fast near the boundary of the Mandelbrot set, it was necessary for the creator to let the landscape grow downwards, so that it looked as if the Mandelbrot set was a plateau atop a mountain with steep sides. The same technique was used a year after in some images in &quot;The Beauty of Fractals&quot; by Heinz-Otto Peitgen and Michael M. Richter. They provide a formula to estimate the distance from a point outside the Mandelbrot set to the boundary of the Mandelbrot set (and a similar formula for the Julia sets). Landscapes can, for example, be formed from the distance function for a family of iterations of the form formula_1.

==Artists==
Notable fractal artists include Desmond Paul Henry, Hamid Naderi Yeganeh, and musician Bruno Degazio. British artists include William Latham, who has used fractal geometry and other computer graphics techniques in his works. and Vienna Forrester who creates flame fractal art using data extracted from her photographs. Greg Sams has used fractal designs in postcards, T-shirts, and textiles. American Vicky Brago-Mitchell has created fractal art which has appeared in exhibitions and on magazine covers. Scott Draves is credited with inventing flame fractals. Carlos Ginzburg has explored fractal art and developed a concept called &quot;homo fractalus&quot; which is based around the idea that the human is the ultimate fractal. Merrin Parkers from New Zealand specialises in fractal art. 
Kerry Mitchell wrote a &quot;Fractal Art Manifesto&quot;, claiming that. In Italy, the artist Giorgio Orefice wrote the &quot;Fractalism&quot; manifesto, founding a Fractalism cultural mouvement in 1999.

According to Mitchell, fractal art is not computerized art, lacking in rules, unpredictable, nor something that any person with access to a computer can do well. Instead, fractal art is expressive, creative, and requires input, effort, and intelligence. Most importantly, &quot;fractal art is simply that which is created by Fractal Artists: ART.&quot;

American artist Hal Tenny was hired to design environment in the 2017 film &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2&quot;. There has also been a surge in fractal art distributed via Non-fungible tokens - such as work listed by Fractal_Dimensions, spectral.haus, and NetMetropolis.

==Exhibits==

Fractal art has been exhibited at major international art galleries. One of the first exhibitions of fractal art was &quot;Map Art&quot;, a travelling exhibition of works from researchers at the University of Bremen. Mathematicians Heinz-Otto Peitgen and Michael M. Richter discovered that the public not only found the images aesthetically pleasing but that they also wanted to understand the scientific background to the images.

In 1989, fractals were part of the subject matter for an art show called &quot;Strange Attractors: Signs of Chaos&quot; at the New Museum of Contemporary Art. The show consisted of photographs, installations and sculptures designed to provide greater scientific discourse to the field which had already captured the public&#x27;s attention through colourful and intricate computer imagery.

In 2014, emerging British fractal artist Vienna Forrester created an exhibition held at the I-node of the Planetary Collegium, Kefalonia, entitled &quot;IO. Fragmented Myths and Memories: A Fractal Exploration of Kefalonia&quot;, part of the 2013–14 international arts festival &quot;Stone Kingdom Kefalonia&quot; commemorating the devastating 1953 Ionian earthquake. Her works were created by using geographical coordinates and photographs from parts of the island which still bear the scars.

== Artworks ==
&quot;Global Forest&quot; artwork is based on a study highlighting the aesthetic and physiological impacts of fractal patterns. Fractals, patterns found universally in nature, repeat self-similarly across scales, with the complexity and aesthetic perception determined by their recursion and dimension rate. Notably, these patterns are featured in art across various cultures, including Jackson Pollock&#x27;s paintings, eliciting strong aesthetic reactions. Moreover, incorporating fractals in architectural designs can mitigate visual strain and discomfort caused by Euclidean spaces and even reduce stress, resonating with the biophilic idea of humans&#x27; innate connection to nature. The ScienceDesignLab collaborated with the Mohawk Group to integrate these findings, producing award-winning &quot;Relaxing Floors&quot; that use fractal patterns, hypothesizing their therapeutic effects stem from nature&#x27;s soothing visuals.

<text>The concept of a random sequence is essential in probability theory and statistics. The concept generally relies on the notion of a sequence of random variables and many statistical discussions begin with the words &quot;let &quot;X&quot;1...,&quot;Xn&quot; be independent random variables...&quot;. Yet as D. H. Lehmer stated in 1951: &quot;A random sequence is a vague notion... in which each term is unpredictable to the uninitiated and whose digits pass a certain number of tests traditional with statisticians&quot;.

Axiomatic probability theory &quot;deliberately&quot; avoids a definition of a random sequence. Traditional probability theory does not state if a specific sequence is random, but generally proceeds to discuss the properties of random variables and stochastic sequences assuming some definition of randomness. The Bourbaki school considered the statement &quot;let us consider a random sequence&quot; an abuse of language. 

==Early history==
Émile Borel was one of the first mathematicians to formally address randomness in 1909. In 1919 Richard von Mises gave the first definition of algorithmic randomness, which was inspired by the law of large numbers, although he used the term &quot;collective&quot; rather than random sequence. Using the concept of the impossibility of a gambling system, von Mises defined an infinite sequence of zeros and ones as random if it is not biased by having the &quot;frequency stability property&quot; i.e. the frequency of zeros goes to 1/2 and every sub-sequence we can select from it by a &quot;proper&quot; method of selection is also not biased.

The sub-sequence selection criterion imposed by von Mises is important, because although 0101010101... is not biased, by selecting the odd positions, we get 000000... which is not random. Von Mises never totally formalized his definition of a proper selection rule for sub-sequences, but in 1940 Alonzo Church defined it as any recursive function which having read the first N elements of the sequence decides if it wants to select element number &quot;N&quot; + 1. Church was a pioneer in the field of computable functions, and the definition he made relied on the Church Turing Thesis for computability. This definition is often called &quot;Mises–Church randomness&quot;.

==Modern approaches==
During the 20th century various technical approaches to defining random sequences were developed and now three distinct paradigms can be identified. In the mid 1960s, A. N. Kolmogorov and D. W. Loveland independently proposed a more permissive selection rule. In their view Church&#x27;s recursive function definition was too restrictive in that it read the elements in order. Instead they proposed a rule based on a partially computable process which having read &quot;any&quot; &quot;N&quot; elements of the sequence, decides if it wants to select another element which has not been read yet. This definition is often called &quot;Kolmogorov–Loveland stochasticity&quot;. But this method was considered too weak by Alexander Shen who showed that there is a Kolmogorov–Loveland stochastic sequence which does not conform to the general notion of randomness.

In 1966 Per Martin-Löf introduced a new notion which is now generally considered the most satisfactory notion of algorithmic randomness. His original definition involved measure theory, but it was later shown that it can be expressed in terms of Kolmogorov complexity. Kolmogorov&#x27;s definition of a random string was that it is random if it has no description shorter than itself via a universal Turing machine.

Three basic paradigms for dealing with random sequences have now emerged:

:* The &quot;frequency / measure-theoretic&quot; approach. This approach started with the work of Richard von Mises and Alonzo Church. In the 1960s Per Martin-Löf noticed that the sets coding such frequency-based stochastic properties are a special kind of measure zero sets, and that a more general and smooth definition can be obtained by considering all effectively measure zero sets.

:* The &quot;complexity / compressibility&quot; approach. This paradigm was championed by A. N. Kolmogorov along with contributions from Leonid Levin and Gregory Chaitin. For finite sequences, Kolmogorov defines randomness of a binary string of length &quot;n&quot; as the entropy (or Kolmogorov complexity) normalized by the length &quot;n&quot;. In other words, if the Kolmogorov complexity of the string is close to &quot;n&quot;, it is very random; if the complexity is far below &quot;n&quot;, it is not so random. The dual concept of randomness is compressibility ‒ the more random a sequence is, the less compressible, and vice versa.

:* The &quot;predictability&quot; approach. This paradigm is due to Claus P. Schnorr and uses a slightly different definition of constructive martingales than martingales used in traditional probability theory. Schnorr showed how the existence of a selective betting strategy implied the existence of a selection rule for a biased sub-sequence. If one only requires a recursive martingale to succeed on a sequence instead of constructively succeed on a sequence, then one gets the concept of recursive randomness. Yongge Wang showed that recursive randomness concept is different from Schnorr&#x27;s randomness concept.

In most cases, theorems relating the three paradigms (often equivalence) have been proven.

<text>Fredric Brown (October 29, 1906 – March 11, 1972) was an American science fiction, fantasy, and mystery writer. 
He is known for his use of humor and for his mastery of the &quot;short short&quot; form—stories of one to three pages, often with ingenious plotting devices and surprise endings. Humor and a postmodern outlook carried over into his novels as well. One of his stories, &quot;Arena&quot;, was adapted to a 1967 episode of the American television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

==Life and works==
Fredric Brown was born in Cincinnati. He spent a year at Hanover College, Indiana, before returning to Cincinnati. In 1929 he married and relocated to Milwaukee, working various jobs before settling into a career as a proofreader.

According to his wife, Brown hated to write, and did whatever he could to put it off: play his flute, challenge a friend to a game of chess, or tease Ming Tah, his Siamese cat. When Brown would have trouble with a certain story, he would take a long bus trip in order to sit and think for days on end. When he would finally return home to sit himself in front of the typewriter, he produced work in a variety of genres: mystery, science fiction, short fantasy, black comedy.

Many of his books make use of the threat of the supernatural or occult before the &quot;straight&quot; explanation comes at the end. For example, &quot;Night of the Jabberwock&quot; is a humorous narrative of an extraordinary day in the life of a small-town newspaper editor.

Brown began to sell mystery short stories to American magazines in 1936. His first science fiction story, &quot;Not Yet the End&quot;, was published in the Winter 1941 issue of &quot;Captain Future&quot; magazine.

The 1944 short story &quot;Arena&quot; bore similarities to the episode of the same name in the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series. In order to avoid legal problems, it was agreed that Brown would receive payment and a story credit. 

It was also adapted in 1973 for issue 4 of the Marvel Comics title &quot;Worlds Unknown.&quot;

Brown&#x27;s first mystery novel, 1947&#x27;s &quot;The Fabulous Clipjoint&quot;, began a series starring Ed and Ambrose Hunter depicting how a young man gradually ripens into a detective under the tutelage of his uncle, an ex–private eye now working as a carnival concessionaire.

His science fiction novel &quot;What Mad Universe&quot; (1949) is a parody of pulp science fiction story conventions.

&quot;The Lights in the Sky Are Stars&quot; (1952) tells the story of an aging astronaut who is trying to get his beloved space program back on track after Congress has cut its funding.

The short story &quot;Answer&quot; (1954) is thought to be the earliest representation of the &quot;Yes, &quot;now&quot; there is a God&quot; science fiction trope of a supercomputer that releases itself from human control. The story was originally published in &quot;Angels and Spaceships&quot; and the entire collection was later re-published as &quot;Star Shine&quot; for paperback adaptation&quot;.&quot;

&quot;Martians, Go Home&quot; (1955) is both a broad farce and a satire on human frailties as seen through the eyes of a billion jeering, invulnerable Martians who arrive not to conquer the world but to drive it crazy.

== Popularity and influence ==
Brown&#x27;s first mystery novel, &quot;The Fabulous Clipjoint&quot;, won the Edgar Award for outstanding first mystery novel. His short story &quot;Arena&quot; was voted by Science Fiction Writers of America as one of the top 20 science fiction stories written before 1965.

His 1945 short story &quot;The Waveries&quot; was described by Philip K. Dick as &quot;what may be the most significant—startlingly so—story sci-fi has yet produced&quot;. Brown was one of three dedicatees of Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s 1961 novel &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; (the other two being Robert Cornog and Philip José Farmer). Philosopher and novelist Umberto Eco in his book &quot;On Ugliness&quot; describes Brown&#x27;s short story &quot;Sentry&quot; as, &quot;one of the finest short stories produced by contemporary science fiction&quot; and uses its twist ending as an example of how ugliness and aesthetics are relative to different cultures.

In &quot;The Annotated Alice&quot; (1960), Martin Gardner refers to Brown&#x27;s &quot;Night of the Jabberwock&quot; as a &quot;magnificently funny mystery novel ... an outstanding work of fiction that has close ties to the &quot;Alice&quot; books.&quot;

In his non-fiction book &quot;Danse Macabre&quot; (1981), a survey of the horror genre since 1950, writer Stephen King includes an appendix of &quot;roughly one hundred&quot; influential books of the period: Fredric Brown&#x27;s short-story collection &quot;Nightmares and Geezenstacks&quot; is included, and is, moreover, asterisked as being among those select works King regards as &quot;particularly important&quot;.

Brown&#x27;s 1943 short story, &quot;Madman&#x27;s Holiday&quot;, was adapted into the 1946 RKO film &quot;Crack-Up&quot;. His novel &quot;The Screaming Mimi&quot; became a 1958 film starring Anita Ekberg and Gypsy Rose Lee and directed by Gerd Oswald.

Brown&#x27;s 1950 short story, &quot;The Last Martian&quot;, was adapted as &quot;Human Interest Story&quot;, a 1959 episode of &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;. In Spain, his 1961 short story &quot;Nightmare in Yellow&quot; was adapted as &quot;El cumpleaños&quot; (The Birthday), the 1966 debut episode of &quot;Historias para no dormir&quot;. Another shorty story, 1954&#x27;s &quot;Naturally&quot;, was adapted as &quot;Geometria&quot;, a 1987 short film by director Guillermo del Toro. 

In the third episode of the third season of Amazon&#x27;s adaptation of Philip K. Dick&#x27;s &quot;The Man In The High Castle&quot; Oberstgruppenführer Smith remarks, when told of the possibility of travel between worlds, that &quot;this is like something out of Fredric Brown&quot;, implying that Brown&#x27;s work is known in the German-occupied areas of the former United States.

His novel &quot;The Lights in the Sky Are Stars&quot; gives its name to the final episode of 2007 anime &quot;Gurren Lagann&quot;. It is also referred to in Taishi Tsutsui&#x27;s manga &quot;We Never Learn&quot;, at the end of Chapter 39.

Celebrated crime novelist Lawrence Block published &quot;The Burglar Who Met Fredric Brown&quot; in 2022.

<text>In mathematical analysis and related areas of mathematics, a set is called bounded if all of its points are within a certain distance of each other. Conversely, a set which is not bounded is called unbounded. The word &quot;bounded&quot; makes no sense in a general topological space without a corresponding metric.

&quot;Boundary&quot; is a distinct concept; for example, a circle (not to be confused with a disk) in isolation is a boundaryless bounded set, while the half plane is unbounded yet has a boundary.

A bounded set is not necessarily a closed set and vice versa. For example, a subset &quot;S&quot; of a 2-dimensional real space R&quot;2&quot; constrained by two parabolic curves &quot;x&quot;2 + 1 and &quot;x&quot;2 - 1 defined in a Cartesian coordinate system is closed by the curves but not bounded (so unbounded).

== Definition in the real numbers ==

A set &quot;S&quot; of real numbers is called &quot;bounded from above&quot; if there exists some real number &quot;k&quot; (not necessarily in &quot;S&quot;) such that &quot;k&quot; ≥ &quot; s&quot; for all &quot;s&quot; in &quot;S&quot;. The number &quot;k&quot; is called an upper bound of &quot;S&quot;. The terms &quot;bounded from below&quot; and lower bound are similarly defined.

A set &quot;S&quot; is bounded if it has both upper and lower bounds. Therefore, a set of real numbers is bounded if it is contained in a finite interval.

== Definition in a metric space ==

A subset &quot;S&quot; of a metric space (&quot;M&quot;, &quot;d&quot;) is bounded if there exists &quot;r&quot; &gt; 0 such that for all &quot;s&quot; and &quot;t&quot; in &quot;S&quot;, we have &quot;d(s&quot;, &quot;t&quot;) &lt; &quot;r&quot;. The metric space (&quot;M&quot;, &quot;d&quot;) is a &quot;bounded&quot; metric space (or &quot;d&quot; is a &quot;bounded&quot; metric) if &quot;M&quot; is bounded as a subset of itself.

*Total boundedness implies boundedness. For subsets of R&quot;n&quot; the two are equivalent.
*A metric space is compact if and only if it is complete and totally bounded.
*A subset of Euclidean space R&quot;n&quot; is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. This is also called the Heine-Borel theorem.

== Boundedness in topological vector spaces ==

In topological vector spaces, a different definition for bounded sets exists which is sometimes called von Neumann boundedness. If the topology of the topological vector space is induced by a metric which is homogeneous, as in the case of a metric induced by the norm of normed vector spaces, then the two definitions coincide.

==Boundedness in order theory==

A set of real numbers is bounded if and only if it has an upper and lower bound. This definition is extendable to subsets of any partially ordered set. Note that this more general concept of boundedness does not correspond to a notion of &quot;size&quot;. 

A subset &quot;S&quot; of a partially ordered set &quot;P&quot; is called bounded above if there is an element &quot;k&quot; in &quot;P&quot; such that &quot;k&quot; ≥ &quot;s&quot; for all &quot;s&quot; in &quot;S&quot;. The element &quot;k&quot; is called an upper bound of &quot;S&quot;. The concepts of bounded below and lower bound are defined similarly. (See also upper and lower bounds.)

A subset &quot;S&quot; of a partially ordered set &quot;P&quot; is called bounded if it has both an upper and a lower bound, or equivalently, if it is contained in an interval. Note that this is not just a property of the set &quot;S&quot; but also one of the set &quot;S&quot; as subset of &quot;P&quot;.

A bounded poset &quot;P&quot; (that is, by itself, not as subset) is one that has a least element and a greatest element. Note that this concept of boundedness has nothing to do with finite size, and that a subset &quot;S&quot; of a bounded poset &quot;P&quot; with as order the restriction of the order on &quot;P&quot; is not necessarily a bounded poset.

A subset &quot;S&quot; of R&quot;n&quot; is bounded with respect to the Euclidean distance if and only if it bounded as subset of R&quot;n&quot; with the product order. However, &quot;S&quot; may be bounded as subset of R&quot;n&quot; with the lexicographical order, but not with respect to the Euclidean distance.

A class of ordinal numbers is said to be unbounded, or cofinal, when given any ordinal, there is always some element of the class greater than it. Thus in this case &quot;unbounded&quot; does not mean unbounded by itself but unbounded as a subclass of the class of all ordinal numbers.

<text>In mathematics, a monotonic function (or monotone function) is a function between ordered sets that preserves or reverses the given order. This concept first arose in calculus, and was later generalized to the more abstract setting of order theory.

== In calculus and analysis ==
In calculus, a function formula_1 defined on a subset of the real numbers with real values is called &quot;monotonic&quot; if it is either entirely non-decreasing, or entirely non-increasing. That is, as per Fig. 1, a function that increases monotonically does not exclusively have to increase, it simply must not decrease.

A function is termed &quot;monotonically increasing&quot; (also &quot;increasing&quot; or &quot;non-decreasing&quot;) if for all formula_2 and formula_3 such that formula_4 one has formula_5, so formula_1 preserves the order (see Figure 1). Likewise, a function is called &quot;monotonically decreasing&quot; (also &quot;decreasing&quot; or &quot;non-increasing&quot;) if, whenever formula_4, then formula_8, so it &quot;reverses&quot; the order (see Figure 2).

If the order formula_9 in the definition of monotonicity is replaced by the strict order formula_10, one obtains a stronger requirement. A function with this property is called &quot;strictly increasing&quot; (also &quot;increasing&quot;). Again, by inverting the order symbol, one finds a corresponding concept called &quot;strictly decreasing&quot; (also &quot;decreasing&quot;). A function with either property is called &quot;strictly monotone&quot;. Functions that are strictly monotone are one-to-one (because for formula_2 not equal to formula_3, either formula_13 or formula_14 and so, by monotonicity, either formula_15 or formula_16, thus formula_17.)

To avoid ambiguity, the terms &quot;weakly monotone&quot;, &quot;weakly increasing&quot; and &quot;weakly decreasing&quot; are often used to refer to non-strict monotonicity.

The terms &quot;non-decreasing&quot; and &quot;non-increasing&quot; should not be confused with the (much weaker) negative qualifications &quot;not decreasing&quot; and &quot;not increasing&quot;. For example, the non-monotonic function shown in figure 3 first falls, then rises, then falls again. It is therefore not decreasing and not increasing, but it is neither non-decreasing nor non-increasing.

A function formula_1 is said to be &quot;absolutely monotonic&quot; over an interval formula_19 if the derivatives of all orders of formula_1 are nonnegative or all nonpositive at all points on the interval.

=== Inverse of function ===

All strictly monotonic functions are invertible because they are guaranteed to have a one-to-one mapping from their range to their domain.

However, functions that are only weakly monotone are not invertible because they are constant on some interval (and therefore are not one-to-one).

A function may be strictly monotonic over a limited a range of values and thus have an inverse on that range even though it is not strictly monotonic everywhere. For example, if formula_21 is strictly increasing on the range formula_22, then it has an inverse formula_23 on the range formula_24.

The term &quot;monotonic&quot; is sometimes used in place of &quot;strictly monotonic&quot;, so a source may state that all monotonic functions are invertible when they really mean that all strictly monotonic functions are invertible.

=== Monotonic transformation ===

The term &quot;monotonic transformation&quot; (or &quot;monotone transformation&quot;) may also cause confusion because it refers to a transformation by a strictly increasing function. This is the case in economics with respect to the ordinal properties of a utility function being preserved across a monotonic transform (see also monotone preferences). In this context, the term &quot;monotonic transformation&quot; refers to a positive monotonic transformation and is intended to distinguish it from a &quot;negative monotonic transformation,&quot; which reverses the order of the numbers.

=== Some basic applications and results ===
The following properties are true for a monotonic function formula_25:
*formula_1 has limits from the right and from the left at every point of its domain;
*formula_1 has a limit at positive or negative infinity (formula_28) of either a real number, formula_29, or formula_30.
*formula_1 can only have jump discontinuities;
*formula_1 can only have countably many discontinuities in its domain. The discontinuities, however, do not necessarily consist of isolated points and may even be dense in an interval (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;). For example, for any summable sequence formula_33 of positive numbers and any enumeration formula_34 of the rational numbers, the monotonically increasing function formula_35 is continuous exactly at every irrational number (cf. picture). It is the cumulative distribution function of the discrete measure on the rational numbers, where formula_36 is the weight of formula_37.
*If formula_1 is differentiable at formula_39 and formula_40, then there is a non-degenerate interval &quot;I&quot; such that formula_41 and formula_1 is increasing on &quot;I&quot;. As a partial converse, if &quot;f&quot; is differentiable and increasing on an interval, &quot;I&quot;, then its derivative is positive at every point in &quot;I&quot;.

These properties are the reason why monotonic functions are useful in technical work in analysis. Other important properties of these functions include:
*if formula_1 is a monotonic function defined on an interval formula_44, then formula_1 is differentiable almost everywhere on formula_44; i.e. the set of numbers formula_2 in formula_44 such that formula_1 is not differentiable in formula_2 has Lebesgue measure zero. In addition, this result cannot be improved to countable: see Cantor function.
*if this set is countable, then formula_1 is absolutely continuous
*if formula_1 is a monotonic function defined on an interval formula_53, then formula_1 is Riemann integrable.

An important application of monotonic functions is in probability theory. If formula_55 is a random variable, its cumulative distribution function formula_56 is a monotonically increasing function.

A function is &quot;unimodal&quot; if it is monotonically increasing up to some point (the &quot;mode&quot;) and then monotonically decreasing.

When formula_1 is a &quot;strictly monotonic&quot; function, then formula_1 is injective on its domain, and if formula_59 is the range of formula_1, then there is an inverse function on formula_59 for formula_1. In contrast, each constant function is monotonic, but not injective, and hence cannot have an inverse.

The graphic shows six monotonic functions. Their simplest forms are shown in the plot area and the expressions used to create them are shown on the &quot;y&quot;-axis.

==In topology==
A map formula_63 is said to be &quot;monotone&quot; if each of its fibers is connected; that is, for each element formula_64 the (possibly empty) set formula_65 is a connected subspace of formula_66

== In functional analysis ==

In functional analysis on a topological vector space formula_55, a (possibly non-linear) operator formula_68 is said to be a &quot;monotone operator&quot; if

formula_69
Kachurovskii&#x27;s theorem shows that convex functions on Banach spaces have monotonic operators as their derivatives.

A subset formula_70 of formula_71 is said to be a &quot;monotone set&quot; if for every pair formula_72 and formula_73 in formula_70,

formula_75
formula_70 is said to be &quot;maximal monotone&quot; if it is maximal among all monotone sets in the sense of set inclusion. The graph of a monotone operator formula_77 is a monotone set. A monotone operator is said to be &quot;maximal monotone&quot; if its graph is a &quot;maximal monotone set&quot;.

== In order theory ==

Order theory deals with arbitrary partially ordered sets and preordered sets as a generalization of real numbers. The above definition of monotonicity is relevant in these cases as well. However, the terms &quot;increasing&quot; and &quot;decreasing&quot; are avoided, since their conventional pictorial representation does not apply to orders that are not total. Furthermore, the strict relations formula_10 and formula_79 are of little use in many non-total orders and hence no additional terminology is introduced for them.

Letting formula_9 denote the partial order relation of any partially ordered set, a &quot;monotone&quot; function, also called &quot;isotone&quot;, or &quot;&quot;, satisfies the property

formula_81

for all and in its domain. The composite of two monotone mappings is also monotone.

The dual notion is often called &quot;antitone&quot;, &quot;anti-monotone&quot;, or &quot;order-reversing&quot;. Hence, an antitone function satisfies the property

formula_82

for all and in its domain.

A constant function is both monotone and antitone; conversely, if is both monotone and antitone, and if the domain of is a lattice, then must be constant.

Monotone functions are central in order theory. They appear in most articles on the subject and examples from special applications are found in these places. Some notable special monotone functions are order embeddings (functions for which formula_4 if and only if formula_84 and order isomorphisms (surjective order embeddings).

== In the context of search algorithms ==
In the context of search algorithms monotonicity (also called consistency) is a condition applied to heuristic functions. A heuristic formula_85 is monotonic if, for every node and every successor of generated by any action , the estimated cost of reaching the goal from is no greater than the step cost of getting to plus the estimated cost of reaching the goal from ,

formula_86

This is a form of triangle inequality, with , , and the goal closest to . Because every monotonic heuristic is also admissible, monotonicity is a stricter requirement than admissibility. Some heuristic algorithms such as A* can be proven optimal provided that the heuristic they use is monotonic.

== In Boolean functions ==
In Boolean algebra, a monotonic function is one such that for all and in , if , , ..., (i.e. the Cartesian product is ordered coordinatewise), then . In other words, a Boolean function is monotonic if, for every combination of inputs, switching one of the inputs from false to true can only cause the output to switch from false to true and not from true to false. Graphically, this means that an -ary Boolean function is monotonic when its representation as an -cube labelled with truth values has no upward edge from &quot;true&quot; to &quot;false&quot;. (This labelled Hasse diagram is the dual of the function&#x27;s labelled Venn diagram, which is the more common representation for .)

The monotonic Boolean functions are precisely those that can be defined by an expression combining the inputs (which may appear more than once) using only the operators &quot;and&quot; and &quot;or&quot; (in particular &quot;not&quot; is forbidden). For instance &quot;at least two of , , hold&quot; is a monotonic function of , , , since it can be written for instance as (( and ) or ( and ) or ( and )).

The number of such functions on variables is known as the Dedekind number of .

SAT solving, generally an NP-hard task, can be achieved efficiently when all involved functions and predicates are monotonic and Boolean.

<doc id="48261" wikidata="Q193857" url="?curid=48261" title="Ben Jonson">
<text>Benjamin Jonson ( 11 June 1572 – ) was an English playwright and poet. Jonson&#x27;s artistry exerted a lasting influence on English poetry and stage comedy. He popularised the comedy of humours; he is best known for the satirical plays &quot;Every Man in His Humour&quot; (1598), &quot;Volpone, or The Fox&quot; (), &quot;The Alchemist&quot; (1610) and &quot;Bartholomew Fair&quot; (1614) and for his lyric and epigrammatic poetry. He is regarded as &quot;the second most important English dramatist, after William Shakespeare, during the reign of James I.&quot;

Jonson was a classically educated, well-read and cultured man of the English Renaissance with an appetite for controversy (personal and political, artistic and intellectual) whose cultural influence was of unparalleled breadth upon the playwrights and the poets of the Jacobean era (1603–1625) and of the Caroline era (1625–1642).

==Early life==

Jonson was born in June 1572—possibly on the 11th—in or near London. In midlife, Jonson said his paternal grandfather, who &quot;served King Henry and was a gentleman&quot;, was a member of the extended Johnston family of Annandale in the Dumfries and Galloway, a genealogy that is attested by the three spindles (rhombi) in the Jonson family coat of arms: one spindle is a diamond-shaped heraldic device used by the Johnston family. His ancestors spelt the family name with a letter &quot;t&quot; (Johnstone or Johnstoun). While the spelling had eventually changed to the more common &quot;Johnson&quot;, the playwright&#x27;s own particular preference became &quot;Jonson&quot;.

Jonson&#x27;s father lost his property, was imprisoned, and, as a Protestant, suffered forfeiture under Queen Mary. Becoming a clergyman upon his release, he died a month before his son&#x27;s birth. His widow married a master bricklayer two years later. Jonson attended school in St Martin&#x27;s Lane in London. Later, a family friend paid for his studies at Westminster School, where the antiquarian, historian, topographer and officer of arms William Camden (1551–1623) was one of his masters. The pupil and master became friends, and the intellectual influence of Camden&#x27;s broad-ranging scholarship upon Jonson&#x27;s art and literary style remained notable, until Camden&#x27;s death in 1623. At Westminster School he met the Welsh poet Hugh Holland, with whom he established an &quot;enduring relationship&quot;. Both of them would write preliminary poems for William Shakespeare&#x27;s First Folio (1623).

On leaving Westminster School in 1589, Jonson attended St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, to continue his book learning. However, because of his unwilled apprenticeship to his bricklayer stepfather, he returned after a month. According to the churchman and historian Thomas Fuller (1608–61), Jonson at this time built a garden wall in Lincoln&#x27;s Inn. After having been an apprentice bricklayer, Jonson went to the Netherlands and volunteered to soldier with the English regiments of Sir Francis Vere (1560–1609) in Flanders. England was allied with the Dutch in their fight for independence as well as the ongoing war with Spain.

The &quot;Hawthornden Manuscripts&quot; (1619), of the conversations between Ben Jonson and the poet William Drummond of Hawthornden (1585–1649), report that, when in Flanders, Jonson engaged, fought and killed an enemy soldier in single combat, and took for trophies the weapons of the vanquished soldier. 

Jonson is reputed to have visited the antiquary Sir Robert Cotton at a residence of his in Chester early in the 17th century.

After his military activity on the Continent, Jonson returned to England and worked as an actor and as a playwright. As an actor, he was the protagonist &quot;Hieronimo&quot; (Geronimo) in the play &quot;The Spanish Tragedy&quot; (), by Thomas Kyd (1558–94), the first revenge tragedy in English literature. By 1597, he was a working playwright employed by Philip Henslowe, the leading producer for the English public theatre; by the next year, the production of &quot;Every Man in His Humour&quot; (1598) had established Jonson&#x27;s reputation as a dramatist.

Jonson described his wife to William Drummond as &quot;a shrew, yet honest&quot;. The identity of Jonson&#x27;s wife is obscure, though she sometimes is identified as &quot;Ann Lewis&quot;, the woman who married a Benjamin Jonson in 1594, at the church of St Magnus-the-Martyr, near London Bridge.

The registers of St Martin-in-the-Fields record that Mary Jonson, their eldest daughter, died in November 1593, at six months of age. A decade later, in 1603, Benjamin Jonson, their eldest son, died of bubonic plague when he was seven years old, upon which Jonson wrote the elegiac &quot;On My First Sonne&quot; (1603). A second son, also named Benjamin Jonson, died in 1635.

During that period, Jonson and his wife lived separate lives for five years; Jonson enjoyed the residential hospitality of his patrons, Esme Stuart, 3rd Duke of Lennox and 7th Seigneur d&#x27;Aubigny and Sir Robert Townshend.

==Career==
By summer 1597, Jonson had a fixed engagement in the Admiral&#x27;s Men, then performing under Philip Henslowe&#x27;s management at The Rose. John Aubrey reports, on uncertain authority, that Jonson was not successful as an actor; whatever his skills as an actor, he was more valuable to the company as a writer.

By this time Jonson had begun to write original plays for the Admiral&#x27;s Men; in 1598 he was mentioned by Francis Meres in his &quot;Palladis Tamia&quot; as one of &quot;the best for tragedy.&quot; None of his early tragedies survive, however. An undated comedy, &quot;The Case is Altered&quot;, may be his earliest surviving play.

In 1597, a play which he co-wrote with Thomas Nashe, &quot;The Isle of Dogs&quot;, was suppressed after causing great offence. Arrest warrants for Jonson and Nashe were issued by Queen Elizabeth I&#x27;s so-called interrogator, Richard Topcliffe. Jonson was jailed in Marshalsea Prison and charged with &quot;Leude and mutynous behaviour&quot;, while Nashe managed to escape to Great Yarmouth. Two of the actors, Gabriel Spenser and Robert Shaw, were also imprisoned. A year later, Jonson was again briefly imprisoned, this time in Newgate Prison, for killing Gabriel Spenser in a duel on 22 September 1598 in Hogsden Fields (today part of Hoxton). Tried on a charge of manslaughter, Jonson pleaded guilty but was released by benefit of clergy, a legal ploy through which he gained leniency by reciting a brief Bible verse (the neck-verse), forfeiting his &quot;goods and chattels&quot; and being branded with the so-called Tyburn T on his left thumb.

While in jail Jonson converted to Catholicism, possibly through the influence of fellow-prisoner Father Thomas Wright, a Jesuit priest.

In 1598 Jonson produced his first great success, &quot;Every Man in His Humour&quot;, capitalising on the vogue for humorous plays which George Chapman had begun with &quot;An Humorous Day&#x27;s Mirth&quot;. William Shakespeare was among the first actors to be cast. Jonson followed this in 1599 with &quot;Every Man out of His Humour&quot;, a pedantic attempt to imitate Aristophanes. It is not known whether this was a success on stage, but when published it proved popular and went through several editions.

Jonson&#x27;s other work for the theatre in the last years of Elizabeth I&#x27;s reign was marked by fighting and controversy. &quot;Cynthia&#x27;s Revels&quot; was produced by the Children of the Chapel Royal at Blackfriars Theatre in 1600. It satirised both John Marston, who Jonson believed had accused him of lustfulness in &quot;Histriomastix&quot;, and Thomas Dekker. Jonson attacked the two poets again in &quot;Poetaster&quot; (1601). Dekker responded with &quot;Satiromastix&quot;, subtitled &quot;the untrussing of the humorous poet&quot;. The final scene of this play, while certainly not to be taken at face value as a portrait of Jonson, offers a caricature that is recognisable from Drummond&#x27;s report – boasting about himself and condemning other poets, criticising performances of his plays and calling attention to himself in any available way.

This &quot;War of the Theatres&quot; appears to have ended with reconciliation on all sides. Jonson collaborated with Dekker on a pageant welcoming James I to England in 1603 although Drummond reports that Jonson called Dekker a rogue. Marston dedicated &quot;The Malcontent&quot; to Jonson and the two collaborated with Chapman on &quot;Eastward Ho!&quot;, a 1605 play whose anti-Scottish sentiment briefly landed both Jonson and Chapman in jail.

==Royal patronage==
At the beginning of the English reign of James VI and I in 1603 Jonson joined other poets and playwrights in welcoming the new king. Jonson quickly adapted himself to the additional demand for masques and entertainments introduced with the new reign and fostered by both the king and his consort Anne of Denmark. In addition to his popularity on the public stage and in the royal hall, he enjoyed the patronage of aristocrats such as Elizabeth Sidney (daughter of Sir Philip Sidney) and Lady Mary Wroth. This connection with the Sidney family provided the impetus for one of Jonson&#x27;s most famous lyrics, the country house poem &quot;To Penshurst&quot;.

In February 1603 John Manningham reported that Jonson was living on Robert Townsend, son of Sir Roger Townshend, and &quot;scorns the world.&quot; Perhaps this explains why his trouble with English authorities continued. That same year he was questioned by the Privy Council about &quot;Sejanus&quot;, a politically themed play about corruption in the Roman Empire. He was again in trouble for topical allusions in a play, now lost, in which he took part. Shortly after his release from a brief spell of imprisonment imposed to mark the authorities&#x27; displeasure at the work, in the second week of October 1605, he was present at a supper party attended by most of the Gunpowder Plot conspirators. After the plot&#x27;s discovery, he appears to have avoided further imprisonment; he volunteered what he knew of the affair to the investigator Robert Cecil and the Privy Council. Father Thomas Wright, who heard Fawkes&#x27;s confession, was known to Jonson from prison in 1598 and Cecil may have directed him to bring the priest before the council, as a witness.

At the same time, Jonson pursued a more prestigious career, writing masques for James&#x27;s court. &quot;The Satyr&quot; (1603) and &quot;The Masque of Blackness&quot; (1605) are two of about two dozen masques which Jonson wrote for James or for Queen Anne, some of them performed at Apethorpe Palace when the King was in residence. &quot;The Masque of Blackness&quot; was praised by Algernon Charles Swinburne as the consummate example of this now-extinct genre, which mingled speech, dancing and spectacle.

On many of these projects, he collaborated, not always peacefully, with designer Inigo Jones. For example, Jones designed the scenery for Jonson&#x27;s masque &quot;Oberon, the Faery Prince&quot; performed at Whitehall on 1 January 1611 in which Prince Henry, eldest son of James I, appeared in the title role. Perhaps partly as a result of this new career, Jonson gave up writing plays for the public theatres for a decade. He later told Drummond that he had made less than two hundred pounds on all his plays together.

In 1616 Jonson received a yearly pension of 100 marks (about £60), leading some to identify him as England&#x27;s first Poet Laureate. This sign of royal favour may have encouraged him to publish the first volume of the folio-collected edition of his works that year. Other volumes followed in 1640–41 and 1692. (See: Ben Jonson folios)

On 8 July 1618 Jonson set out from Bishopsgate in London to walk to Edinburgh, arriving in Scotland&#x27;s capital on 17 September. For the most part he followed the Great North Road, and was treated to lavish and enthusiastic welcomes in both towns and country houses. On his arrival he lodged initially with John Stuart, a cousin of King James, in Leith, and was made an honorary burgess of Edinburgh at a dinner laid on by the city on 26 September. He stayed in Scotland until late January 1619, and the best-remembered hospitality he enjoyed was that of the Scottish poet, William Drummond of Hawthornden, sited on the River Esk. Drummond undertook to record as much of Jonson&#x27;s conversation as he could in his diary, and thus recorded aspects of Jonson&#x27;s personality that would otherwise have been less clearly seen. Jonson delivers his opinions, in Drummond&#x27;s terse reporting, in an expansive and even magisterial mood. Drummond noted he was &quot;a great lover and praiser of himself, a contemner and scorner of others&quot;.

On returning to England, he was awarded an honorary Master of Arts degree from Oxford University.

The period between 1605 and 1620 may be viewed as Jonson&#x27;s heyday. By 1616 he had produced all the plays on which his present reputation as a dramatist is based, including the tragedy &quot;Catiline&quot; (acted and printed 1611), which achieved limited success and the comedies &quot;Volpone&quot; (acted 1605 and printed in 1607), &quot;Epicoene, or the Silent Woman&quot; (1609), &quot;The Alchemist&quot; (1610), &quot;Bartholomew Fair&quot; (1614) and &quot;The Devil Is an Ass&quot; (1616). &quot;The Alchemist&quot; and &quot;Volpone&quot; were immediately successful. Of &quot;Epicoene&quot;, Jonson told Drummond of a satirical verse which reported that the play&#x27;s subtitle was appropriate since its audience had refused to applaud the play (i.e., remained silent). Yet &quot;Epicoene&quot;, along with &quot;Bartholomew Fair&quot; and (to a lesser extent) &quot;The Devil is an Ass&quot; have in modern times achieved a certain degree of recognition. While his life during this period was apparently more settled than it had been in the 1590s, his financial security was still not assured.

==Religion==
Jonson recounted that his father had been a prosperous Protestant landowner until the reign of &quot;Bloody Mary&quot; and had suffered imprisonment and the forfeiture of his wealth during that monarch&#x27;s attempt to restore England to Catholicism. On Elizabeth&#x27;s accession, he had been freed and had been able to travel to London to become a clergyman. (All that is known of Jonson&#x27;s father, who died a month before his son was born, comes from the poet&#x27;s own narrative.) Jonson&#x27;s elementary education was in a small church school attached to St Martin-in-the-Fields parish, and at the age of about seven he secured a place at Westminster School, then part of Westminster Abbey.

Notwithstanding this emphatically Protestant grounding, Jonson maintained an interest in Catholic doctrine throughout his adult life and, at a particularly perilous time while a religious war with Spain was widely expected and persecution of Catholics was intensifying, he converted to the faith. This took place in October 1598, while Jonson was on remand in Newgate Gaol charged with manslaughter. Jonson&#x27;s biographer Ian Donaldson is among those who suggest that the conversion was instigated by Father Thomas Wright, a Jesuit priest who had resigned from the order over his acceptance of Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s right to rule in England. Wright, although placed under house arrest on the orders of Lord Burghley, was permitted to minister to the inmates of London prisons. It may have been that Jonson, fearing that his trial would go against him, was seeking the unequivocal absolution that Catholicism could offer if he were sentenced to death. Alternatively, he could have been looking to personal advantage from accepting conversion since Father Wright&#x27;s protector, the Earl of Essex, was among those who might hope to rise to influence after the succession of a new monarch. Jonson&#x27;s conversion came at a weighty time in affairs of state; the royal succession, from the childless Elizabeth, had not been settled and Essex&#x27;s Catholic allies were hopeful that a sympathetic ruler might attain the throne.

Conviction, and certainly not expedience alone, sustained Jonson&#x27;s faith during the troublesome twelve years he remained a Catholic. His stance received attention beyond the low-level intolerance to which most followers of that faith were exposed. The first draft of his play &quot;Sejanus His Fall&quot; was banned for &quot;popery&quot;, and did not re-appear until some offending passages were cut. In January 1606 he (with Anne, his wife) appeared before the Consistory Court in London to answer a charge of recusancy, with Jonson alone additionally accused of allowing his fame as a Catholic to &quot;seduce&quot; citizens to the cause. This was a serious matter (the Gunpowder Plot was still fresh in people&#x27;s minds) but he explained that his failure to take communion was only because he had not found sound theological endorsement for the practice, and by paying a fine of thirteen shillings (156 pence) he escaped the more serious penalties at the authorities&#x27; disposal. His habit was to slip outside during the sacrament, a common routine at the time—indeed it was one followed by the royal consort, Queen Anne of Denmark, herself—to show political loyalty while not offending the conscience. Leading church figures, including John Overall, Dean of St Paul&#x27;s, were tasked with winning Jonson back to Protestantism, but these overtures were resisted.

In May 1610 Henry IV of France was assassinated, purportedly in the name of the Pope; he had been a Catholic monarch respected in England for tolerance towards Protestants, and his murder seems to have been the immediate cause of Jonson&#x27;s decision to rejoin the Church of England. He did this in flamboyant style, pointedly drinking a full chalice of communion wine at the eucharist to demonstrate his renunciation of the Catholic rite, in which the priest alone drinks the wine. The exact date of the ceremony is unknown. However, his interest in Catholic belief and practice remained with him until his death.

==Decline and death==
Jonson&#x27;s productivity began to decline in the 1620s, but he remained well-known. In that time, the Sons of Ben or the &quot;Tribe of Ben&quot;, those younger poets such as Robert Herrick, Richard Lovelace, and Sir John Suckling who took their bearing in verse from Jonson, rose to prominence. However, a series of setbacks drained his strength and damaged his reputation. He resumed writing regular plays in the 1620s, but these are not considered among his best. They are of significant interest, however, for their portrayal of Charles I&#x27;s England. &quot;The Staple of News&quot;, for example, offers a remarkable look at the earliest stage of English journalism. The lukewarm reception given that play was, however, nothing compared to the dismal failure of &quot;The New Inn&quot;; the cold reception given this play prompted Jonson to write a poem condemning his audience (&quot;An Ode to Himself&quot;), which in turn prompted Thomas Carew, one of the &quot;Tribe of Ben&quot;, to respond in a poem that asks Jonson to recognise his own decline.

The principal factor in Jonson&#x27;s partial eclipse was, however, the death of James and the accession of King Charles I in 1625. Jonson felt neglected by the new court. A decisive quarrel with Jones harmed his career as a writer of court masques, although he continued to entertain the court on an irregular basis. For his part, Charles displayed a certain degree of care for the great poet of his father&#x27;s day: he increased Jonson&#x27;s annual pension to £100 and included a tierce of wine and beer.

Despite the strokes that he suffered in the 1620s, Jonson continued to write. At his death in 1637 he seems to have been working on another play, &quot;The Sad Shepherd&quot;. Though only two acts are extant, this represents a remarkable new direction for Jonson: a move into pastoral drama. During the early 1630s, he also conducted a correspondence with James Howell, who warned him about disfavour at court in the wake of his dispute with Jones.

According to a contemporary letter written by Edward Thelwall of Gray&#x27;s Inn, Jonson died on 18 August 1637 (O.S. 6 August). He died in London. His funeral was held the next day. It was attended by &quot;all or the greatest part of the nobility then in town&quot;. He is buried in the north aisle of the nave in Westminster Abbey, with the inscription &quot;O Rare Ben Johnson [&quot;sic&quot;]&quot; set in the slab over his grave. John Aubrey, in a more meticulous record than usual, notes that a passer-by, John Young of Great Milton, Oxfordshire, saw the bare grave marker and on impulse paid a workman eighteen pence to make the inscription. Another theory suggests that the tribute came from William Davenant, Jonson&#x27;s successor as Poet Laureate (and card-playing companion of Young), as the same phrase appears on Davenant&#x27;s nearby gravestone, but essayist Leigh Hunt contends that Davenant&#x27;s wording represented no more than Young&#x27;s coinage, cheaply re-used. The fact that Jonson was buried in an upright position was an indication of his reduced circumstances at the time of his death, although it has also been written that he asked for a grave exactly 18 inches square from the monarch and received an upright grave to fit in the requested space.

It has been pointed out that the inscription could be read &quot;Orare Ben Jonson&quot; (pray for Ben Jonson), possibly in an allusion to Jonson&#x27;s acceptance of Catholic doctrine during his lifetime (although he had returned to the Church of England); the carving shows a distinct space between &quot;O&quot; and &quot;rare&quot;.

A monument to Jonson was erected in about 1723 by the Earl of Oxford and is in the eastern aisle of Westminster Abbey&#x27;s Poets&#x27; Corner. It includes a portrait medallion and the same inscription as on the gravestone. It seems Jonson was to have had a monument erected by subscription soon after his death but the English Civil War intervened.

==His work==
===Drama===
Apart from two tragedies, &quot;Sejanus&quot; and &quot;&quot;, that largely failed to impress Renaissance audiences, Jonson&#x27;s work for the public theatres was in comedy. These plays vary in some respects. The minor early plays, particularly those written for boy players, present somewhat looser plots and less-developed characters than those written later, for adult companies. Already in the plays which were his salvos in the Poets&#x27; War, he displays the keen eye for absurdity and hypocrisy that marks his best-known plays; in these early efforts, however, the plot mostly takes second place to a variety of incident and comic set-pieces. They are, also, notably ill-tempered. Thomas Davies called &quot;Poetaster&quot; &quot;a contemptible mixture of the serio-comic, where the names of Augustus Caesar, Maecenas, Virgil, Horace, Ovid and Tibullus, are all sacrificed upon the altar of private resentment&quot;. Another early comedy in a different vein, &quot;The Case is Altered&quot;, is markedly similar to Shakespeare&#x27;s romantic comedies in its foreign setting, emphasis on genial wit and love-plot. Henslowe&#x27;s diary indicates that Jonson had a hand in numerous other plays, including many in genres such as English history with which he is not otherwise associated.

The comedies of his middle career, from &quot;Eastward Hoe&quot; to &quot;The Devil Is an Ass&quot; are for the most part city comedy, with a London setting, themes of trickery and money, and a distinct moral ambiguity, despite Jonson&#x27;s professed aim in the Prologue to &quot;Volpone&quot; to &quot;mix profit with your pleasure&quot;. His late plays or &quot;&quot;, particularly &quot;The Magnetic Lady&quot; and &quot;The Sad Shepherd&quot;, exhibit signs of an accommodation with the romantic tendencies of Elizabethan comedy.

Within this general progression, however, Jonson&#x27;s comic style remained constant and easily recognisable. He announces his programme in the prologue to the folio version of &quot;Every Man in His Humour&quot;: he promises to represent &quot;deeds, and language, such as men do use&quot;. He planned to write comedies that revived the classical premises of Elizabethan dramatic theory—or rather, since all but the loosest English comedies could claim some descent from Plautus and Terence, he intended to apply those premises with rigour. This commitment entailed negations: after &quot;The Case is Altered&quot;, Jonson eschewed distant locations, noble characters, romantic plots and other staples of Elizabethan comedy, focusing instead on the satiric and realistic inheritance of new comedy. He set his plays in contemporary settings, peopled them with recognisable types, and set them to actions that, if not strictly realistic, involved everyday motives such as greed and jealousy. In accordance with the temper of his age, he was often so broad in his characterisation that many of his most famous scenes border on the farcical (as William Congreve, for example, judged &quot;Epicoene&quot;). He was more diligent in adhering to the classical unities than many of his peers—although as Margaret Cavendish noted, the unity of action in the major comedies was rather compromised by Jonson&#x27;s abundance of incident. To this classical model, Jonson applied the two features of his style which save his classical imitations from mere pedantry: the vividness with which he depicted the lives of his characters and the intricacy of his plots. Coleridge, for instance, claimed that &quot;The Alchemist&quot; had one of the three most perfect plots in literature.

===Poetry===

Jonson&#x27;s poetry, like his drama, is informed by his classical learning. Some of his better-known poems are close translations of Greek or Roman models; all display the careful attention to form and style that often came naturally to those trained in classics in the humanist manner. Jonson largely avoided the debates about rhyme and meter that had consumed Elizabethan classicists such as Thomas Campion and Gabriel Harvey. Accepting both rhyme and stress, Jonson used them to mimic the classical qualities of simplicity, restraint and precision.

&quot;Epigrams&quot; (published in the 1616 folio) is an entry in a genre that was popular among late-Elizabethan and Jacobean audiences, although Jonson was perhaps the only poet of his time to work in its full classical range. The epigrams explore various attitudes, most from the satiric stock of the day: complaints against women, courtiers and spies abound. The condemnatory poems are short and anonymous; Jonson&#x27;s epigrams of praise, including a famous poem to Camden and lines to Lucy Harington, are longer and are mostly addressed to specific individuals. Although it is included among the epigrams, &quot;On My First Sonne&quot; is neither satirical nor very short; the poem, intensely personal and deeply felt, typifies a genre that would come to be called &quot;lyric poetry.&quot; It is possible that the spelling of &#x27;son&#x27; as &#x27;Sonne&#x27; is meant to allude to the sonnet form, with which it shares some features. A few other so-called epigrams share this quality. Jonson&#x27;s poems of &quot;The Forest&quot; also appeared in the first folio. Most of the fifteen poems are addressed to Jonson&#x27;s aristocratic supporters, but the most famous are his country-house poem &quot;To Penshurst&quot; and the poem &quot;To Celia&quot; (&quot;Come, my Celia, let us prove&quot;) that appears also in &quot;Volpone&quot;.

&quot;Underwood&quot;, published in the expanded folio of 1640, is a larger and more heterogeneous group of poems. It contains &quot;A Celebration of Charis&quot;, Jonson&#x27;s most extended effort at love poetry; various religious pieces; encomiastic poems including the poem to Shakespeare and a sonnet on Mary Wroth; the &quot;Execration against Vulcan&quot; and others. The 1640 volume also contains three elegies which have often been ascribed to Donne (one of them appeared in Donne&#x27;s posthumous collected poems).

==Relationship with Shakespeare==
There are many legends about Jonson&#x27;s rivalry with Shakespeare. William Drummond reports that during their conversation, Jonson scoffed at two apparent absurdities in Shakespeare&#x27;s plays: a nonsensical line in &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; and the setting of &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; on the non-existent seacoast of Bohemia. Drummond also reported Jonson as saying that Shakespeare &quot;wanted art&quot; (i.e., lacked skill).

In in &quot;Timber&quot;, which was published posthumously and reflects his lifetime of practical experience, Jonson offers a fuller and more conciliatory comment. He recalls being told by certain actors that Shakespeare never blotted (i.e., crossed out) a line when he wrote. His own claimed response was &quot;Would he had blotted a thousand!&quot; However, Jonson explains, &quot;Hee was (indeed) honest, and of an open, and free nature: had an excellent &quot;Phantsie&quot;; brave notions and gentle expressions: wherein hee flow&#x27;d with that facility, that sometime it was necessary he should be stopp&#x27;d&quot;. Jonson concludes that &quot;there was ever more in him to be praised than to be pardoned.&quot; When Shakespeare died, he said, &quot;He was not of an age, but for all time.&quot;

Thomas Fuller relates stories of Jonson and Shakespeare engaging in debates in the Mermaid Tavern; Fuller imagines conversations in which Shakespeare would run rings around the more learned but more ponderous Jonson. That the two men knew each other personally is beyond doubt, not only because of the tone of Jonson&#x27;s references to him but because Shakespeare&#x27;s company produced a number of Jonson&#x27;s plays, at least two of which (&quot;Every Man in His Humour&quot; and &quot;Sejanus His Fall&quot;) Shakespeare certainly acted in. However, it is now impossible to tell how much personal communication they had, and tales of their friendship cannot be substantiated.

Jonson&#x27;s most influential and revealing commentary on Shakespeare is the second of the two poems that he contributed to the prefatory verse that opens Shakespeare&#x27;s First Folio. This poem, , did a good deal to create the traditional view of Shakespeare as a poet who, despite &quot;small Latine, and lesse Greeke&quot;, had a natural genius. The poem has traditionally been thought to exemplify the contrast which Jonson perceived between himself, the disciplined and erudite classicist, scornful of ignorance and sceptical of the masses, and Shakespeare, represented in the poem as a kind of natural wonder whose genius was not subject to any rules except those of the audiences for which he wrote. But the poem itself qualifies this view:
:Yet must I not give Nature all: Thy Art,
:My gentle Shakespeare, must enjoy a part.

Some view this elegy as a conventional exercise, but others see it as a heartfelt tribute to the &quot;Sweet Swan of Avon&quot;, the &quot;Soul of the Age!&quot; It has been argued that Jonson helped to edit the First Folio, and he may have been inspired to write this poem by reading his fellow playwright&#x27;s works, a number of which had been previously either unpublished or available in less satisfactory versions, in a relatively complete form.

==Reception and influence==
Jonson was a towering literary figure, and his influence was enormous for he has been described as &quot;One of the most vigorous minds that ever added to the strength of English literature&quot;. Before the English Civil War, the &quot;Tribe of Ben&quot; touted his importance, and during the Restoration Jonson&#x27;s satirical comedies and his theory and practice of &quot;humour characters&quot; (which are often misunderstood; see William Congreve&#x27;s letters for clarification) was extremely influential, providing the blueprint for many Restoration comedies. John Aubrey wrote of Jonson in &quot;Brief Lives&quot;. By 1700, Jonson&#x27;s status began to decline. In the Romantic era, Jonson suffered the fate of being unfairly compared and contrasted to Shakespeare, as the taste for Jonson&#x27;s type of satirical comedy decreased. Jonson was at times greatly appreciated by the Romantics, but overall he was denigrated for not writing in a Shakespearean vein.

In 2012, after more than two decades of research, Cambridge University Press published the first new edition of Jonson&#x27;s complete works for 60 years.

===Drama===
As G. E. Bentley notes in &quot;Shakespeare and Jonson: Their Reputations in the Seventeenth Century Compared&quot;, Jonson&#x27;s reputation was in some respects equal to Shakespeare&#x27;s in the 17th century. After the English theatres were reopened on the Restoration of Charles II, Jonson&#x27;s work, along with Shakespeare&#x27;s and Fletcher&#x27;s, formed the initial core of the Restoration repertory. It was not until after 1710 that Shakespeare&#x27;s plays (ordinarily in heavily revised forms) were more frequently performed than those of his Renaissance contemporaries. Many critics since the 18th century have ranked Jonson below only Shakespeare among English Renaissance dramatists. Critical judgment has tended to emphasise the very qualities that Jonson himself lauds in his prefaces, in &quot;Timber&quot;, and in his scattered prefaces and dedications: the realism and propriety of his language, the bite of his satire, and the care with which he plotted his comedies.

For some critics, the temptation to contrast Jonson (representing art or craft) with Shakespeare (representing nature, or untutored genius) has seemed natural; Jonson himself may be said to have initiated this interpretation in the second folio, and Samuel Butler drew the same comparison in his commonplace book later in the century.

At the Restoration, this sensed difference became a kind of critical dogma. Charles de Saint-Évremond placed Jonson&#x27;s comedies above all else in English drama, and Charles Gildon called Jonson the father of English comedy. John Dryden offered a more common assessment in the &quot;Essay of Dramatic Poesie,&quot; in which his Avatar Neander compares Shakespeare to Homer and Jonson to Virgil: the former represented profound creativity, the latter polished artifice. But &quot;artifice&quot; was in the 17th century almost synonymous with &quot;art&quot;; Jonson, for instance, used &quot;artificer&quot; as a synonym for &quot;artist&quot; (&quot;Discoveries,&quot; 33). For Lewis Theobald, too, Jonson &quot;ow[ed] all his Excellence to his Art,&quot; in contrast to Shakespeare, the natural genius. Nicholas Rowe, to whom may be traced the legend that Jonson owed the production of &quot;Every Man in his Humour&quot; to Shakespeare&#x27;s intercession, likewise attributed Jonson&#x27;s excellence to learning, which did not raise him quite to the level of genius. A consensus formed: Jonson was the first English poet to understand classical precepts with any accuracy, and he was the first to apply those precepts successfully to contemporary life. But there were also more negative spins on Jonson&#x27;s learned art; for instance, in the 1750s, Edward Young casually remarked on the way in which Jonson&#x27;s learning worked, like Samson&#x27;s strength, to his own detriment. Earlier, Aphra Behn, writing in defence of female playwrights, had pointed to Jonson as a writer whose learning did not make him popular; unsurprisingly, she compares him unfavourably to Shakespeare. Particularly in the tragedies, with their lengthy speeches abstracted from Sallust and Cicero, Augustan critics saw a writer whose learning had swamped his aesthetic judgment.

In this period, Alexander Pope is exceptional in that he noted the tendency to exaggeration in these competing critical portraits: &quot;It is ever the nature of Parties to be in extremes; and nothing is so probable, as that because Ben Jonson had much the most learning, it was said on the one hand that Shakespear had none at all; and because Shakespear had much the most wit and fancy, it was retorted on the other, that Jonson wanted both.&quot; For the most part, the 18th century consensus remained committed to the division that Pope doubted; as late as the 1750s, Sarah Fielding could put a brief recapitulation of this analysis in the mouth of a &quot;man of sense&quot; encountered by David Simple.

Though his stature declined during the 18th century, Jonson was still read and commented on throughout the century, generally in the kind of comparative and dismissive terms just described. Heinrich Wilhelm von Gerstenberg translated parts of Peter Whalley&#x27;s edition into German in 1765. Shortly before the Romantic revolution, Edward Capell offered an almost unqualified rejection of Jonson as a dramatic poet, who (he writes) &quot;has very poor pretensions to the high place he holds among the English Bards, as there is no original manner to distinguish him and the tedious sameness visible in his plots indicates a defect of Genius.&quot; The disastrous failures of productions of &quot;Volpone&quot; and &quot;Epicoene&quot; in the early 1770s no doubt bolstered a widespread sense that Jonson had at last grown too antiquated for the contemporary public; if he still attracted enthusiasts such as Earl Camden and William Gifford, he all but disappeared from the stage in the last quarter of the century.

The romantic revolution in criticism brought about an overall decline in the critical estimation of Jonson. Hazlitt refers dismissively to Jonson&#x27;s &quot;laborious caution.&quot; Coleridge, while more respectful, describes Jonson as psychologically superficial: &quot;He was a very accurately observing man; but he cared only to observe what was open to, and likely to impress, the senses.&quot; Coleridge placed Jonson second only to Shakespeare; other romantic critics were less approving. The early 19th century was the great age for recovering Renaissance drama. Jonson, whose reputation had survived, appears to have been less interesting to some readers than writers such as Thomas Middleton or John Heywood, who were in some senses &quot;discoveries&quot; of the 19th century. Moreover, the emphasis which the romantic writers placed on imagination, and their concomitant tendency to distrust studied art, lowered Jonson&#x27;s status, if it also sharpened their awareness of the difference traditionally noted between Jonson and Shakespeare. This trend was by no means universal, however; William Gifford, Jonson&#x27;s first editor of the 19th century, did a great deal to defend Jonson&#x27;s reputation during this period of general decline. In the next era, Swinburne, who was more interested in Jonson than most Victorians, wrote, &quot;The flowers of his growing have every quality but one which belongs to the rarest and finest among flowers: they have colour, form, variety, fertility, vigour: the one thing they want is fragrance&quot; – by &quot;fragrance,&quot; Swinburne means spontaneity.

In the 20th century, Jonson&#x27;s body of work has been subject to a more varied set of analyses, broadly consistent with the interests and programmes of modern literary criticism. In an essay printed in &quot;The Sacred Wood&quot;, T. S. Eliot attempted to repudiate the charge that Jonson was an arid classicist by analysing the role of imagination in his dialogue. Eliot was appreciative of Jonson&#x27;s overall conception and his &quot;surface&quot;, a view consonant with the modernist reaction against Romantic criticism, which tended to denigrate playwrights who did not concentrate on representations of psychological depth. Around mid-century, a number of critics and scholars followed Eliot&#x27;s lead, producing detailed studies of Jonson&#x27;s verbal style. At the same time, study of Elizabethan themes and conventions, such as those by E. E. Stoll and M. C. Bradbrook, provided a more vivid sense of how Jonson&#x27;s work was shaped by the expectations of his time.

The proliferation of new critical perspectives after mid-century touched on Jonson inconsistently. Jonas Barish was the leading figure among critics who appreciated Jonson&#x27;s artistry. On the other hand, Jonson received less attention from the new critics than did some other playwrights and his work was not of programmatic interest to psychoanalytic critics. But Jonson&#x27;s career eventually made him a focal point for the revived sociopolitical criticism. Jonson&#x27;s works, particularly his masques and pageants, offer significant information regarding the relations of literary production and political power, as do his contacts with and poems for aristocratic patrons; moreover, his career at the centre of London&#x27;s emerging literary world has been seen as exemplifying the development of a fully commodified literary culture. In this respect he is seen as a transitional figure, an author whose skills and ambition led him to a leading role both in the declining culture of patronage and in the rising culture of mass media.

===Poetry===
Jonson has been called &quot;the first poet laureate&quot;. If Jonson&#x27;s reputation as a playwright has traditionally been linked to Shakespeare, his reputation as a poet has, since the early 20th century, been linked to that of John Donne. In this comparison, Jonson represents the cavalier strain of poetry, emphasising grace and clarity of expression; Donne, by contrast, epitomised the metaphysical school of poetry, with its reliance on strained, baroque metaphors and often vague phrasing. Since the critics who made this comparison (Herbert Grierson for example), were to varying extents rediscovering Donne, this comparison often worked to the detriment of Jonson&#x27;s reputation.

In his time Jonson was at least as influential as Donne. In 1623, historian Edmund Bolton named him the best and most polished English poet. That this judgment was widely shared is indicated by the admitted influence he had on younger poets. The grounds for describing Jonson as the &quot;father&quot; of cavalier poets are clear: many of the cavalier poets described themselves as his &quot;sons&quot; or his &quot;tribe&quot;. For some of this tribe, the connection was as much social as poetic; Herrick described meetings at &quot;the Sun, the Dog, the Triple Tunne&quot;. All of them, including those like Herrick whose accomplishments in verse are generally regarded as superior to Jonson&#x27;s, took inspiration from Jonson&#x27;s revival of classical forms and themes, his subtle melodies, and his disciplined use of wit. In these respects, Jonson may be regarded as among the most important figures in the prehistory of English neoclassicism.
Popular Culture - His &quot;Queen and Huntress&quot; was used, in slightly amended form, by Mike Oldfield on side 4 of his multi Album set, Incantations.The lyrics can be found on his website, confirming its the same poem. 

The best of Jonson&#x27;s lyrics have remained current since his time; periodically, they experience a brief vogue, as after the publication of Peter Whalley&#x27;s edition of 1756. Jonson&#x27;s poetry continues to interest scholars for the light which it sheds on English literary history, such as politics, systems of patronage and intellectual attitudes. For the general reader, Jonson&#x27;s reputation rests on a few lyrics that, though brief, are surpassed for grace and precision by very few Renaissance poems: &quot;On My First Sonne&quot;; &quot;To Celia&quot;; &quot;To Penshurst&quot;; and the epitaph on Salomon Pavy, a boy player abducted from his parents who acted in Jonson&#x27;s plays.

* &quot;To Celia&quot; &quot;(Drink to Me Only With Thine Eyes)&quot;, poem

It is in Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Timber, or Discoveries...&quot; that he famously quipped on the manner in which language became a measure of the speaker or writer:

As with other English Renaissance dramatists, a portion of Ben Jonson&#x27;s literary output has not survived. In addition to &quot;The Isle of Dogs&quot; (1597), the records suggest these lost plays as wholly or partially Jonson&#x27;s work: &quot;Richard Crookback&quot; (1602); &quot;Hot Anger Soon Cold&quot; (1598), with Porter and Henry Chettle; &quot;Page of Plymouth&quot; (1599), with Dekker; and &quot;Robert II, King of Scots&quot; (1599), with Chettle and Dekker. Several of Jonson&#x27;s masques and entertainments also are not extant: &quot;The Entertainment at Merchant Taylors&quot; (1607); &quot;The Entertainment at Salisbury House for James I&quot; (1608); and &quot;The May Lord&quot; (1613–19).

Finally, there are questionable or borderline attributions. Jonson may have had a hand in &quot;Rollo, Duke of Normandy, or The Bloody Brother&quot;, a play in the canon of John Fletcher and his collaborators. The comedy &quot;The Widow&quot; was printed in 1652 as the work of Thomas Middleton, Fletcher and Jonson, though scholars have been intensely sceptical about Jonson&#x27;s presence in the play. A few attributions of anonymous plays, such as &quot;The London Prodigal&quot;, have been ventured by individual researchers, but have met with cool responses.

<text>Representative money or receipt money is any medium of exchange, physical or digital, that represents something of value, but has little or no value of its own (intrinsic value). Unlike some forms of fiat money (which may have no commodity backing), genuine representative money must have something of intrinsic value supporting the face value.

More specifically, the term &quot;representative money&quot; has been used variously to mean:
* A claim on a commodity, for example gold and silver certificates. In this sense it may be called &quot;commodity-backed money&quot;.
* Any type of money that has face value greater than its value as material substance. Used in this sense, most types of fiat money are a type of representative money.

There is no concrete evidence that the clay tokens used as an accounting tool to keep track of warehouse stores in ancient Mesopotamia were also used as representative money.
 However, the idea has been suggested.

In 1895 economist Joseph Shield Nicholson wrote that credit expansion and contraction was in fact the expansion and contraction of representative money.

In 1934 economist William Howard Steiner wrote that the term was used &quot;at one time to signify that a certain amount of bullion was stored in the Treasury while the equivalent paper in circulation&quot; represented the bullion.

<text>Howard Spring (10 February 1889 – 3 May 1965) was a Welsh author and journalist. He began his writing career as a journalist but from 1934 produced a series of best-selling novels for adults and children. The most successful was &quot;Fame Is the Spur&quot; (1940), which was later adapted into a film starring Michael Redgrave, and later still a BBC TV series (1982) starring Tim Pigott-Smith and David Hayman.

==Biography==
Howard Spring was born in Cardiff, the son of a jobbing gardener. He was forced to leave school at the age of twelve, when his father died, to start work as an errand boy. He later became an office boy at a firm of chartered accountants in Cardiff Docks and then a messenger at the offices of the &quot;South Wales Daily News&quot;. He was keen to train as a reporter, and spent his leisure time learning shorthand and taking evening classes at Cardiff University, where he studied English, French, Latin, mathematics and history. He graduated to be a reporter on both the morning and evening editions of the &quot;South Wales Daily News&quot;.

In 1911 he joined the &quot;Yorkshire Observer&quot; in Bradford before moving in 1915 to the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot;, but was there only a few months before he was called up for the Royal Army Service Corps as a shorthand typist.

After the war, he returned to the &quot;Guardian&quot;, where he worked as a reporter. C. P. Scott, the editor, apparently regarded Spring&#x27;s reporting skills highly; he wrote of Spring that: &quot;Nobody does a better &#x27;descriptive&#x27; or a better condensation of a difficult address.&quot; Whilst working for the &quot;Guardian&quot;, Spring lived in the suburb of Didsbury. In 1931, after reporting on a political meeting at which Lord Beaverbrook was the speaker, Beaverbrook was so impressed by Spring&#x27;s piece (Spring described Beaverbrook as &quot;a pedlar of dreams&quot;, which took Beaverbrook&#x27;s fancy) that he arranged for him to be offered a post with the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; in London as a book reviewer. Spring described the offer as &quot;irresistible&quot;, and the appointment proved successful.

At the same time, Spring was developing his ambitions as a writer; his first book, &quot;Darkie and Co.&quot;, a children&#x27;s story, came out in 1932, followed by his first novel, &quot;Shabby Tiger&quot;, which was set in Manchester, published by William Collins, Sons in 1934. &quot;Shabby Tiger&quot; was adapted as a television series of the same title produced by Granada Television in 1973. It starred John Nolan as Nick and Prunella Gee as Anna, with Sharon Maughan making her TV debut as the glamorous and ambitious Rachel Rosing. A sequel to the novel followed a year later, &quot;Rachel Rosing&quot; (Collins, 1935). Both were published in the US in 1936.

The children&#x27;s story &quot;Sampson&#x27;s Circus&quot;, illustrated by Steven Spurrier and published by Faber &amp; Faber in 1936, was one of two commended runners up for the Library Association&#x27;s inaugural Carnegie Medal, recognising the year&#x27;s outstanding contribution to children&#x27;s literature by a British subject.

His first major success in the adult market came with &quot;My Son, My Son&quot; (1937), originally titled &quot;O Absalom&quot;. It gained success in America, listed as a national fiction best seller in &quot;The English Journal&quot; for eight consecutive months, starting in July 1948. The novel was adapted as the American 1940 film &quot;My Son, My Son!&quot; and later made for television by the BBC in 1977. WorldCat libraries report editions in Chinese, German, Hebrew and four other languages.

In 1939 Spring moved to Mylor in Cornwall to become a full-time writer. (His wife Marion&#x27;s father had a house at St Mawes.) In 1940, his best-known work appeared: &quot;Fame Is the Spur&quot;, the story of a Labour leader&#x27;s rise to power. During the war years Spring wrote two other novels, &quot;Hard Facts&quot; (1944) and &quot;Dunkerley&#x27;s&quot; (1946).

In 1947 Spring and his wife moved to Falmouth, The White Cottage in Fenwick Road, and in the post-war period he published &quot;There Is No Armour&quot; (1948), &quot;The Houses in Between&quot; (1951), &quot;A Sunset Touch&quot; (1953), &quot;These Lovers Fled Away&quot; (1955), &quot;Time and the Hour&quot; (1957), &quot;All the Day Long &quot; (1959), &quot;I Met a Lady&quot; (1961), and his last book was &quot;Winds of the Day&quot; (1964). Spring also produced three volumes of autobiography: &quot;Heaven Lies About Us, A Fragment of Infancy&quot; (1939); &quot;In the Meantime&quot; (1942); and &quot;And Another Thing&quot; (1946), later published in one volume as &quot;The Autobiography of Howard Spring&quot; (Collins, 1972).

During this period Spring served eight years as President of the prestigious Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society and as a Director of the Falmouth School of Art and President of the Cornish Drama League. The last was well known for producing plays at the open-air Minack Theatre on the cliffs near Land&#x27;s End.

Spring was a successful writer, who combined a wide understanding of human character with technical skill as a novelist. His method of composition was painstaking. Each morning he would shut himself in his room and write a thousand words, steadily building up to novels of around 150,000 words. He rarely made major alterations to his writings.

Howard Spring died of a stroke. In 1967, his widow, Marion Spring, wrote an affectionate story of their life together, called &quot;Howard&quot;, with a foreword by A. L. Rowse. It was published by Collins.

<doc id="48272" wikidata="Q1869884" url="?curid=48272" title="Khalil el-Moumni">
<text>Khalil el-Moumni (; 1 July 1941 – 21 November 2020, Oujda, Morocco) was a Moroccan imam who preached at the An-Nasr Mosque in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. He was a center of controversy for his views on homosexuality, which brought him into open conflict with the Dutch politician Pim Fortuyn.

==Biography==
He was born in Bni Mansour. In Morocco he was banned several times for speaking about &quot;injustice&quot; in society.

On 3 May 2001, he appeared on the Dutch television program &quot;Nova&quot; to discuss the rising incidence of anti-homosexual violence by Moroccan youths. He said that &quot;if the sickness of homosexuality spreads itself, everyone can become infected&quot;. &quot;That&#x27;s what we are afraid of... Who will still make children if men marry among themselves and women too?&quot;.

Later, various sources reported statements from sermons of his that were published in Arabic in 1998. He said: &quot;The western civilisation is a civilisation without morals. In the Netherlands it is permitted for homosexuals to marry each other. The Europeans stand lower than dogs and pigs&quot;.

Forty-nine individuals and organizations filed official complaints about his statements on the Nova program, under Dutch anti-discrimination laws. However a drawn-out period of reconciliation followed, involving supporters of el-Moumni, Dutch politicians, homosexuals and religious groups, in which he was gradually moved to apologize. He said that some of the Arabic statements were mistranslated.

In December 2001, the justice ministry decided to prosecute him anyway. On 4 April 2002 a court in Rotterdam announced its verdict: although in principle his statements had been discriminatory against homosexuals, they were permitted on grounds of freedom of religious expression, since they were based on the Qur&#x27;an and other Muslim documents. The justice ministry appealed the decision but lost again on 18 November 2002.

Just before reaching the age of 65, el-Moumni ended his 46-year career with a last service in the An-Nasr Mosque on 23 June 2006. In this service el-Moumni called on believers to use the mosque not only for prayer, but also for civil activities.

On 21 November 2020, el-Moumni died from COVID-19 at the age of 79.

<doc id="48274" wikidata="Q29303" url="?curid=48274" title="Canterbury">
<text>Canterbury (, ) is a city and UNESCO World Heritage Site, in the county of Kent, England; it was a county borough until 1974. It lies on the River Stour. The city has a mild oceanic climate.

Canterbury is a popular tourist destination, with the city&#x27;s economy heavily reliant upon tourism, alongside higher education and retail. As of 2011, the city&#x27;s population was over 55,000, including a substantial number of students and one of the highest student-to-permanent-resident ratios in Britain.

The site of the city has been occupied since Paleolithic times and served as the capital of the Celtic Cantiaci and Jute Kingdom of Kent. Many historical structures fill the area, including a city wall founded in Roman times and rebuilt in the 14th century, the Westgate Towers museum, the ruins of St Augustine&#x27;s Abbey, the Norman Canterbury Castle, and the oldest extant school in the world, the King&#x27;s School. Modern additions include the Marlowe Theatre and Kent County Cricket Club&#x27;s St Lawrence Ground. Canterbury Cathedral is known for its architecture, its music, and for being the seat of the Archbishop of Canterbury; it receives a million visitors per year.

== History ==

=== Name ===

The Roman settlement of &quot;Durovernum Cantiacorum&quot; (&quot;Kentish Durovernum&quot;) occupied the location of an earlier British town whose ancient British name has been reconstructed as *&quot;Durou̯ernon&quot; (&quot;stronghold by the alder grove&quot;), although the name is sometimes supposed to have derived from various British names for the Stour. Medieval variants of the Roman name include &quot;Dorobernia&quot; and &quot;Dorovernia&quot;. In Sub-Roman Britain, it was known in Old Welsh as &quot;Cair Ceint&quot; (&quot;stronghold of Kent&quot;). Occupied by the Jutes, it became known in Old English as &quot;Cantwareburh&quot; (&quot;stronghold of the Kentish men&quot;).

=== Early history ===

The Canterbury area has been inhabited since prehistoric times. Lower Paleolithic axes, and Neolithic and Bronze Age pots have been found in the area. Canterbury was first recorded as the main settlement of the Celtic tribe of the Cantiaci, which inhabited most of modern-day Kent. In the 1st century AD, the Romans captured the settlement and named it Durovernum Cantiacorum. The Romans rebuilt the city, with new streets in a grid pattern, a theatre, a temple, a forum, and public baths. Although they did not maintain a major military garrison, its position on Watling Street relative to the major Kentish ports of Rutupiae (Richborough), Dubrae (Dover), and Lemanae (Lymne) gave it considerable strategic importance. In the late 3rd century, to defend against attack from barbarians, the Romans built an earth bank around the city and a wall with seven gates, which enclosed an area of .

Despite being counted as one of the 28 cities of Sub-Roman Britain, it seems that after the Romans left Britain in 410 Durovernum Cantiacorum was abandoned for around 100 years, except by a few farmers and gradually decayed. Over the next 100 years, an Anglo-Saxon community formed within the city walls, as Jutish refugees arrived, possibly intermarrying with the locals. The town&#x27;s new importance led to its revival, and trades developed in pottery, textiles, and leather. By 630, gold coins were being struck at the Canterbury mint. In 842 and 851, Canterbury suffered great loss of life during Danish raids. 

=== 11th–16th centuries ===
The siege of Canterbury saw a large Viking army besiege Canterbury in 1011, culminating in the city being pillaged. Remembering the destruction caused by the Danes, the inhabitants of Canterbury did not resist William the Conqueror&#x27;s invasion in 1066. William immediately ordered a wooden motte-and-bailey castle to be built by the Roman city wall. In the early 12th century, the castle was rebuilt with stone. Canterbury Castle was captured by the French Prince Louis during his 1215 invasion of England, before the death of John caused his English supporters to desert his cause and support the young Henry III.

Black Death reached Canterbury in 1348. At 10,000, Canterbury had the 10th largest population in England; by the early 16th century, the population had fallen to 3,000. In 1363, during the Hundred Years&#x27; War, a Commission of Inquiry found disrepair, stone-robbing and ditch-filling had led to the Roman wall becoming eroded. Between 1378 and 1402, the wall was virtually rebuilt, and new wall towers were added. In 1381, during Wat Tyler&#x27;s Peasants&#x27; Revolt, the castle and Archbishop&#x27;s Palace were sacked, and Archbishop Sudbury was beheaded in London. In 1413, Henry IV became the only sovereign to be buried at the cathedral. In 1448 Canterbury was granted a city charter, which gave it a mayor and a high sheriff; the city still has a Lord Mayor and Sheriff.

In 1519 a public cage for talkative women and other wrongdoers was set up next to the town&#x27;s pillory at the Bullstake, now the Buttermarket. In 1522 a stone cross with gilt lead stars was erected at the same place, and painted with bice and gilded by Florence the painter.

=== History of Huguenot refugees ===

In the mid-16th century many Huguenots, experiencing persecution and conflict in the Low Countries, fled and resettled in Reformed regions such as England. Canterbury hosted the first congregation of so-called &#x27;refugee strangers&#x27; in the country. This first Huguenot church in Canterbury was founded around 1548, in part by Jan Utenhove who relocated from Strasbourg, alongside Valérand Poullain and François de la Rivière. When Utenhove travelled to London in 1549, Francois de la Rivière remained to lead the congregation. With the accession of Mary I, the Huguenot residents of Canterbury were compelled to flee in 1553–4 alongside the English Marian exiles to Emden, Wesel, Zürich, Strasbourg, Frankfurt, and later Basel, Geneva, and Aarau.

After the accession of Elizabeth I, a small number of Huguenots returned to London, including Jan Utenhove in 1559. In 1561, a number of Huguenots in London were sent to Sandwich, a settlement which began to grow rapidly with new refugees arriving from Artois and Flanders. This settlement, in June 1575, almost entirely relocated to Canterbury, which had in the previous year gained a small Huguenot population. A number of refugees also arrived around this time from the temporary Huguenot settlements at Rye and Winchelsea. In 1575, the Huguenot population of Canterbury were granted use of the church of St Alphedge but in the following year had begun to use the crypt of Canterbury Cathedral as their church. The Church of the Crypt swiftly became the nucleus of the Huguenot community in Canterbury. 

By the 17th century, French-speaking Huguenots comprised two-fifths of Canterbury&#x27;s population. The Huguenots had a large influence on the economy of Canterbury, and introduced silk weaving into the city which had outstripped wool weaving by 1676. 

=== 17th century–present ===
Canterbury remained an important city in the 17th century. Charles I and Henrietta Maria visited in 1625; musicians played whilst the couple entered the city under a velvet canopy supported by six men holding poles. In 1647, during the English Civil War, riots broke out. The riots became known as the &quot;Plum Pudding Riots&quot;. The rioters&#x27; trial the following year led to a Kent revolt against Parliamentarian forces, contributing to the start of the second phase of the war. However, Canterbury surrendered peacefully to Parliamentarians at the Battle of Maidstone.

By 1770, the castle had fallen into disrepair, and many parts of it were demolished during the late 18th century and early 19th century. In 1787 all the gates in the city wall, except for Westgate—the city jail—were demolished as a result of a commission that found them impeding to new coach travel. Canterbury Prison opened in 1808 just outside the city boundary. By 1820 the silk weaving in the city had been supplanted by imported Indian muslins and trade carried out was thereafter largely of hops and wheat. The Canterbury &amp; Whitstable Railway (The Crab and Winkle Way), the world&#x27;s first passenger railway, was opened in 1830; bankrupt by 1844, it was purchased by the South Eastern Railway, which connected the city to its larger network in 1846. The London, Chatham &amp; Dover Railway arrived in 1860; the competition and cost-cutting between the lines was resolved by merging them as the South Eastern &amp; Chatham in 1899. Between 1830 and 1900, the city&#x27;s population grew from 15,000 to 24,000.

During the First World War, barracks and voluntary hospitals were set up around the city. In 1917 a German bomber crash-landed near Broad Oak Road. Mahatma Gandhi visited Canterbury in October 1931.
During the Second World War, 10,445 bombs dropped during 135 separate raids destroyed 731 homes and 296 other buildings in the city, including the missionary college and Simon Langton Girls&#x27; Grammar School. 119 civilian people died through enemy action in the borough. The most devastating raid was on 1 June 1942 during the Baedeker Blitz. Before the end of the war, the architect Charles Holden drew up plans to redevelop the city centre, but locals were so opposed that the Citizens&#x27; Defence Association was formed; it swept to power in the 1945 municipal elections. Rebuilding of the city centre eventually began 10 years after the war. A ring road was constructed in stages outside the city walls to alleviate growing traffic problems in the city centre, which was later pedestrianised. The biggest expansion of the city occurred in the 1960s, with the arrival of the University of Kent at Canterbury and Christ Church College.

The 1980s saw visits from Queen Elizabeth II, and the beginning of the annual Canterbury Festival. Between 1999 and 2005, the Whitefriars Shopping Centre underwent major redevelopment. In 2000, during the redevelopment, a major archaeological project was undertaken by the Canterbury Archaeological Trust, known as the Big Dig, which was supported by Channel Four&#x27;s &quot;Time Team&quot;.

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===

Canterbury experiences an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;), similar to almost all of the United Kingdom. Canterbury enjoys mild temperatures all year round, being between 1.8 °C (35.2 °F) and 22.8 °C (73 °F). There is relatively little rainfall throughout the year.

=== Demography ===

At the 2001 UK census, the total population of the city itself was 43,432, and 135,278 within the Canterbury district. In 2011, the total district population was counted as 151,200, with an 11.7% increase from 2001, and the population of the city had grown to over 55,000. By 2015, Canterbury&#x27;s student population, including the University of Kent and Canterbury Christ Church University, and the smaller University for the Creative Arts, was almost 40,000.

=== Physical ===

Canterbury is in east Kent, about east-southeast of London. The coastal towns of Herne Bay and Whitstable are to the north, and Faversham is to the northwest. The city is on the River Stour or Great Stour. The river is navigable on the tidal section to Fordwich, although above this point canoes and other small craft can be used. The geology of the area consists mainly of brickearth overlying chalk. Tertiary sands overlain by London clay form St. Thomas&#x27;s Hill and St. Stephen&#x27;s Hill about a mile northwest of the city centre.

Canterbury is a medieval city, with Canterbury Cathedral inside the ring of the city walls, forming the historic centre. Of the defensive structures, a section of the medieval walls remains to the south, near Canterbury Castle, while to the northwest, the Westgate survives as the Westgate Towers museum. Immediately outside the Westgate is the River Stour which crosses the city from southwest to northeast. A road runs straight across the city from the Westgate, forming the High Street (including St George&#x27;s Street) and part of the North Downs Way. St Augustine&#x27;s Abbey lies just outside the city walls.

=== Political ===

The city became a county borough under the Local Government Act 1888. In 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, the city came under the control of Kent County Council. Canterbury, along with Whitstable and Herne Bay, is now in the City of Canterbury local government district. The city&#x27;s urban area consists of the six electoral wards of Barton, Blean Forest, Northgate, St Stephens, Westgate, and Wincheap. These wards have eleven of the fifty seats on the Canterbury City Council, which governs the city.

The former Holy Cross Church building was officially re-opened by the Prince of Wales as the new Canterbury Guildhall and meeting place of the City Council on 9 November 1978.

The Member of Parliament for the Canterbury constituency, which includes Whitstable, is Rosie Duffield formerly of the Labour Party but now sits as an independent.

=== Economic ===

Canterbury district retained approximately 4,761 businesses, up to 60,000 full and part-time employees and was worth £1.3 billion in 2001. This made the district the second largest economy in Kent. Today, the three primary sectors are tourism, higher education and retail.

In 2015, the value of tourism to the city of Canterbury was over £450 million; 7.2 million people visited that year, making it one of the most-visited cities in England. A full 9,378 jobs were supported by tourism, an increase of 6% over the previous year. The two universities provided an even greater benefit. In 2014/2015, the University of Kent and Canterbury Christ Church University were worth £909m to city&#x27;s economy and accounted for 16% of all jobs.

Unemployment in the city dropped 0.6 percentage points to 1.7% from 2001 to 2007. The registered unemployment rate as of September 2011 stood at 5.7%. By May 2018, the rate had dropped to 1.8%; in fact, Kent in general had a moderate unemployment rate of 2%. This data considers only people claiming either Jobseekers Allowance or Universal Credit principally for the reason of being unemployed. It does not include those without access to such benefits. At the time, the national rate was 4.2%.

A report in 2023 by the Poverty Working Group of the Canterbury Sustainable Development Goals Forum evidenced increasing poverty in the city using, for example, life expectancy figures and the number of meals provided by the city food banks, as well as interviews with organisations and individuals attempting to help those in danger of and in poverty. This supports earlier findings on poverty in the city.

== Culture ==

=== Landmarks ===

The 17th century, double jettied, half-timbered Crooked House bookshop operated by the Catching Lives homelessness charity at the end of Palace Street, opposite Kings School is frequently photographed for its quirky, slanted appearance. Canterbury Roman Museum houses an &quot;in situ&quot; mosaic pavement dating from around 300 AD. Other surviving Roman structures in the city include Queningate, a blocked gate in the city wall, and the Dane John Mound, once part of a Roman cemetery. The Dane John Gardens were built beside the mound in the 18th century, and a memorial placed on the mound&#x27;s summit.

Westgate Towers is a museum narrating its earlier use as a jail. The medieval church of St Alphege is used by the King&#x27;s School. The Old Synagogue, now the King&#x27;s School Music Room, is one of only two Egyptian Revival synagogues still standing. The city centre contains many timber-framed 16th and 17th century houses but others were destroyed, particularly in the Second World War Baedeker Blitz. Survivors include the Huguenot &quot;Old Weaver&#x27;s House&quot;. St Martin&#x27;s Mill is the only surviving mill out of the six known to have stood in Canterbury. It was built in 1817 and worked until 1890 but is now a residence.

=== Theatres ===

The Marlowe Theatre is named after Christopher Marlowe, who was born in the city. It was formerly located in St Margaret&#x27;s Street but moved to the present location in 1984. It was completely rebuilt in 2011 with a main 1,200-seat auditorium and secondary performance space. Its modern structure is a landmark across the city.
The University of Kent&#x27;s Gulbenkian Theatre serves the city, and incorporates a cinema and café. Other theatrical performances take place at Canterbury Cathedral and St Augustine&#x27;s Abbey. The oldest surviving theatre building in Canterbury is The Shakespeare bar which had been a playhouse in the Tudor period. Theatre companies in Canterbury include The Canterbury Players.

=== Music ===

In common with many English towns and cities in the Middle Ages, Canterbury employed a band of waits. There are records of payments to the waits from 1402, though they probably existed earlier. The waits were disbanded by the city authorities in 1641 for &#x27;misdemeanors&#x27; but reinstated in 1660 when they played for the visit of King Charles II on his return from exile. Civic waits were ultimately abolished nationally by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 but a modern, early music group called The Canterbury Waits has revived the name.

Canterbury&#x27;s Catch Club was a musical and social club which met in the city between 1779 and 1865. Its male club members met weekly in the winter and employed an orchestra to assist in performances for the first half of their evening. After an interval, the members sang catches and glees from the club&#x27;s extensive music library which is now deposited at Canterbury Cathedral&#x27;s archives.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s the Canterbury Scene emerged comprising progressive rock, avant-garde and jazz musicians established within the city. Members included Soft Machine, Caravan, Matching Mole, Egg, Hatfield and the North, National Health, Gilgamesh, Soft Heap, Khan and In Cahoots. Ian Dury, front man of 1970s rock band Ian Dury and the Blockheads, taught Fine Art at Canterbury College of Art and early incarnations of his band Kilburn and the High Roads performed in the city. Canterbury Choral Society give regular concerts in Canterbury Cathedral, typically large-scale classical choral works. The Canterbury Orchestra, founded in 1953, perform major works from the symphonic repertoire. Other local musical groups include the Canterbury Singers, founded in 1953; Cantemus; and the City of Canterbury Chamber Choir.

The Canterbury Festival takes place over two weeks in October including musical events ranging from opera and symphony concerts to world music, jazz and folk. From 2006 to 2015 the July Lounge On The Farm music festival presented rock, indie and dance artists near Canterbury.

=== Sport ===

Cricket

Canterbury is the home of Kent County Cricket Club, with the St Lawrence Ground hosting many of the team&#x27;s matches. It has also been used for several One Day Internationals, including an England match during the 1999 Cricket World Cup.
The St Lawrence Ground is notable for being one of only two grounds used regularly for first-class cricket that have had a tree within the boundary, the other being the City Oval in Pietermaritzburg.
American Football

There have been multiple American football teams based in Canterbury since the game was popularised in the UK. Currently, the city is the home of the East Kent Mavericks, 2023 BAFA National Leagues Southern Football Conference 2 Champions, as well as teams from both universities.

== Education ==

=== Universities ===

Canterbury hosts some 31,000 students and has the highest student to permanent resident ratio in the UK. They attend three universities, and other higher education institutions. The University of Kent&#x27;s main campus extends to and is situated on Saint Stephen&#x27;s Hill, a mile north of Canterbury city centre. In 2014, it enrolled around 20,000 students. Canterbury Christ Church University was founded as a teacher training college in 1962 by the Church of England; in 2005 it became a university. In 2024, it had around 30,000 students. The Franciscan International Study Centre is close to the University of Kent campus.

=== Schools ===
King&#x27;s School is the oldest secondary school in the United Kingdom. St. Augustine established it shortly after his 597 arrival in Canterbury though documented history of it only began after dissolution of the monasteries in the 16th century, when it took the present name in honour of Henry VIII.

The city&#x27;s secondary grammar schools are Barton Court Grammar School, Simon Langton Grammar School for Boys and Simon Langton Girls&#x27; Grammar School, all of which in 2008 had over 93% of their pupils gain five or more GCSEs at grades A* to C including English and maths.

== Transport ==

=== Rail ===

The pioneering Canterbury &amp; Whitstable Railway, known locally as the &quot;Crab and Winkle line&quot;, had a terminus at North Lane station. It ran from 3 May 1830 to 1953 and was the first regular passenger steam railway in the world. Canterbury South railway station was sited on the Elham Valley Railway. The station opened in 1889 and closed, along with the rest of the railway, in 1947.

Canterbury West railway station is operated by Southeastern. 
Canterbury East railway station, (Canterbury&#x27;s other station) is also operated by Southeastern. There is no direct interchange between Canterbury West and Canterbury East stations because the two railways into the city were built by rival companies. Canterbury Parkway railway station has been proposed as an additional station outside of the city, with links to both lines.

=== Bus ===

Stagecoach run local bus routes in Canterbury, as well as long-distance services. Its bio fuel &#x27;Unibus&#x27; service operates between the city centre and University of Kent. Canterbury has two operational park and ride sites at Wincheap and New Dover Road, both intended for visitors arriving from the south by road.

=== Cycling ===

National Cycle Routes 1 runs through Canterbury from Dover and Sandwich to Whitstable. National Cycle Route 18 runs from Canterbury to Ashford.

== Local media ==

=== Newspapers ===
Canterbury&#x27;s first newspaper was the &quot;Kentish Post&quot;, founded in 1717. It merged with newly founded &quot;Kentish Gazette&quot; in 1768 which is still being published, claiming to be the country&#x27;s second oldest surviving newspaper. It is currently produced as a paid-for newspaper by KM Group in Whitstable with a 25,000 circulation across East Kent.

Three free weekly newspapers provide local news. The Daily Mail and General Trust&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Times&quot; has a circulation of 55,000. Similar circulation &quot;Canterbury Extra&quot; is owned by KM Group. &quot;yourcanterbury&quot; is published by KOS Media, which also prints Kent on Sunday.

===Radio===
Local radio stations are BBC Radio Kent on 104.2FM, Heart South on 102.8FM and KMFM Canterbury on 106FM. KMFM Canterbury was formerly KMFM106, and from foundation in 1997 until KM Group took control CTFM, a reference to Canterbury&#x27;s CT postcode. KMFM&#x27;s studio moved from the city to Ashford in 2008. Canterbury Hospital Radio serves Kent and Canterbury Hospital, and SBSLive&#x27;s coverage is limited to the Simon Langton Boys School grounds.

From 2007 to 2020 Canterbury was also served by the country&#x27;s first student led community radio station CSR 97.4FM. CSR means &quot;Canterbury Student Radio&quot; but it was a radio station catering to the students of the University of Kent and Canterbury Christ Church University, other educational establishments and the wider community being a collaboration of the two university&#x27;s and broadcasting from studios at both. It replaced the student radio stations that served both university&#x27;s being UKCR and C4 Radio respectively. In 2020 due to the COVID pandemic the station management decided to hand back the FM licence to OFCOM due to rising costs and has been broadcasting online since. There are plans for CSR to go on the recently awarded digital radio multiplex when it launches in the near future.

===Television===
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC South East and ITV Meridian from the Dover TV transmitter.

== Notable people ==

Composer Orlando Gibbons (1583–1625) died in Canterbury and is commemorated by a marble bust and memorial tablet in the cathedral.

* Certaldo, Italy, since 1997
* Vladimir, Russia, since 1997
* Mölndal, Sweden, since 1997
* Tournai, Belgium, since 1999
* Bloomington, Illinois, United States

== Religion ==

In 597, Pope Gregory the Great sent Augustine to convert its King Æthelberht to Christianity. After the conversion, Canterbury, being a Roman town, was chosen by Augustine as the centre for his episcopal see in Kent, and an abbey and cathedral were built. Augustine thus became the first Archbishop of Canterbury. In 672, the Synod of Hertford gave the see of Canterbury authority over the entire English Church. In 978, Archbishop Dunstan refounded the abbey built by Augustine, and named it St Augustine&#x27;s Abbey. In 1504 the cathedral&#x27;s main tower, the Bell Harry Tower, was completed, ending 400 years of building. Cardinal Wolsey visited in June 1518 and was given a present of fruit, nuts, and marchpane. During the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the city&#x27;s priory, nunnery and three friaries were closed. St Augustine&#x27;s Abbey, the 14th richest in England at the time, was surrendered to the Crown, and its church and cloister were levelled. The rest of the abbey was dismantled over the next 15 years, although part of the site was converted to a palace.

After the murder of the Archbishop Thomas Becket at the cathedral in 1170, Canterbury became one of the most notable towns in Europe, as pilgrims from all parts of Christendom came to visit his shrine. This pilgrimage provided the framework for Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s 14th-century collection of stories, &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;. Thomas Becket&#x27;s shrine in the cathedral was demolished in 1538 by King Henry VIII, all the gold, silver, and jewels were removed to the Tower of London, and Becket&#x27;s images, name and feasts were obliterated throughout the kingdom, ending the pilgrimages. In 1620, Robert Cushman negotiated the lease of the &quot;Mayflower&quot; at 59 Palace Street for the purpose of transporting the Pilgrims to America. In 1647, during the English Civil War, riots broke out when Canterbury&#x27;s puritan mayor banned church services on Christmas Day. In 1848, St Augustine&#x27;s Abbey was refurbished for use as a missionary college for the Church of England&#x27;s representatives in the British colonies. The extensive restoration of the cathedral that was underway in mid 2018 was part of a 2016–2021 schedule that includes replacement of the nave roof, improved landscaping and accessibility, new visitor facilities and a general external restoration. The so-called Canterbury Journey project was expected to cost nearly £25 million.

Canterbury Cathedral is Mother Church of the Anglican Communion and seat of the Archbishop of Canterbury. Founded in 597 AD by Augustine, it forms a World Heritage Site, along with Saxon St. Martin&#x27;s Church and the ruins of St Augustine&#x27;s Abbey. The cathedral receives a million visitors annually and is one of the most visited places in the country. Services are held three or more times a day.

St Thomas of Canterbury Church is the only Roman Catholic church in the city and contains relics of Thomas Becket.


==In popular culture==
Chaucer’s text became the inspiration for the 1944 British film, &quot;A Canterbury Tale&quot; by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, starring Eric Portman, Sheila Sim, Dennis Price and Sgt. John Sweet, filmed in the city in the aftermath of the destruction caused by German bombing during World War Two.

In more recent popular culture, Canterbury appeared in Russell Hoban’s 1980 post apocalyptic novel &quot;Riddley Walker,&quot; renamed &quot;Cambry&quot;.

<doc id="48276" wikidata="Q13405535" url="?curid=48276" title="History of the State of Palestine">
<text>The history of the State of Palestine describes the creation and evolution of the State of Palestine in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. During the British mandate period, numerous plans of partition of Palestine were proposed but without the agreement of all parties. In 1947, the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine was voted for. The leaders of the Jewish Agency for Palestine accepted parts of the plan, while Arab leaders refused it. This triggered the 1947–1949 Palestine war and led, in 1948, to the establishment of the state of Israel on a part of Mandate Palestine as the Mandate came to an end. 

The Gaza Strip came under Egyptian occupation, and the West Bank was ruled by Jordan, before both territories were occupied by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War. Since then there have been proposals to establish a Palestinian state. In 1969, for example, the PLO proposed the establishment of a binational state over the whole of the former British Mandate territory. This proposal was rejected by Israel, as it would have amounted to the disbanding of the state of Israel. The basis of the current proposals is for a two-state solution on either a portion of or the entirety of the Palestinian territories—the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, which have been occupied by Israel since 1967.

==Background==

=== From prehistory to the Ottoman era ===
===British mandate period===
The rise of Zionism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries saw a growing stream of Jewish immigration into Palestine. In 1917, during World War I, the British Government issued the Balfour Declaration which declared British support for the creation in Palestine of a &quot;national home for the Jewish people&quot;. The declaration was enthusiastically received by many Jews worldwide, but was opposed by Palestinian and Arab leaders, who later claimed that the objective was a breach of promises made to the Sharif of Mecca in 1915, in exchange for Arabs helping to fight the Ottoman Empire during the war.

The defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War I resulted in the dismantling of their rule. In 1920, the League of Nations granted Britain the mandate to govern Palestine, leading to the subsequent period of British administration. 

Many different proposals have been made and continue to be made to resolve the dilemma of the competing objectives, including an Arab state, with or without a significant Jewish population, a Jewish state, with or without a significant Arab population, a single bi-national state, with or without some degree of cantonization, two states, one bi-national and one Arab, with or without some form of federation, and two states, one Jewish and one Arab, with or without some form of federation.

At the same times, many Arab leaders maintained that Palestine should join a larger Arab state covering the imprecise region of the Levant. These hopes were expressed in the Faisal–Weizmann Agreement, which was signed by soon-to-be Iraqi ruler Faisal I and the Zionist leader Chaim Weizmann. Despite this, the promise of a Pan-Arab state including Palestine were dashed as Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan declared independence from their European rulers, while western Palestine festered in the developing Arab-Jewish conflict.

In light of these developments, Arabs began calling for both their own state in the British Mandate of Palestine and an end to the British support of the Jewish homeland&#x27;s creation and to Jewish immigration. The movement gained steam through the 1920s and 1930s as Jewish immigration picked up. Under pressure from the arising nationalist movement, the British enforced the White Papers, a series of laws greatly restricting Jewish immigration and the sale of lands to Jews. The laws, passed in 1922, 1930, and 1939, varied in severity, but all attempted to find a balance between British sympathies with the Jews and the Arabs.

====McMahon–Hussein Correspondence (1915–16)====
In the early years of World War I, negotiations took place between the British High Commissioner in Egypt Henry McMahon and Sharif of Mecca Husayn bin Ali for an alliance of sorts between the Allies and the Arabs in the Near East against the Ottomans. On 24 October 1915, McMahon sent to Hussein a note which the Arabs came to regard as their &quot;Declaration of Independence&quot;. In McMahon&#x27;s letter, part of the McMahon–Hussein Correspondence, McMahon declared Britain&#x27;s willingness to recognise the independence of the Arabs, both in the Levant and the Hejaz, subject to certain exemptions. It stated on behalf of the Government of Great Britain that:

The two districts of Mersina and Alexandretta and portions of Syria lying to the west of the districts of Damascus, Homs, Hama and Aleppo cannot be said to be purely Arab, and should be excluded from the limits demanded.
With the above modification, and without prejudice of our existing treaties with Arab chiefs, we accept those limits.
As for those regions lying within those frontiers wherein Great Britain is free to act without detriment to the interest of her ally, France, I am empowered in the name of the Government of Great Britain to give the following assurances and make the following reply to your letter:
# Subject to the above modifications, Great Britain is prepared to recognize and support the independence of the Arabs in all the regions within the limits demanded by the Sherif of Mecca.
The exemptions from Arab control of certain areas set out in the McMahon note were to seriously complicate the problems of peace in the Near East. At the time, the Arab portions of the Ottoman Empire were divided into administrative units called &quot;vilayets&quot; and &quot;sanjaks&quot;. Palestine was divided into the &quot;sanjuks&quot; of Acre and Nablus, both of which were a part of the vilayet of Beirut, and an independent &quot;sanjak&quot; of Jerusalem. The areas exempted from Arab control by the McMahon note included &quot;Syria lying to the west of the districts of Damascus, Homs, Hama, and Aleppo.&quot; Between 1916 and 1920, the British government interpreted these commitments as including Palestine in the Arab area. However, in the Churchill White Paper they argued instead that &quot;Damascus&quot; meant the &quot;vilayet&quot; and not the city of Damascus, and accordingly virtually all of Palestine was excluded from Arab control. The British entered into the secret Sykes–Picot Agreement on 16 May 1916 and the commitment of the Balfour Declaration, for example, on that understanding.

The Arabs, however, insisted at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference at the end of the war that &quot;Damascus&quot; meant the city of Damascus – which left Palestine in their hands. However, in 1915, these problems of interpretation did not occur to Hussein, who agreed to the British wording.

Despite Arab objections based in part on the Arab interpretation of the McMahon correspondence noted above, Britain was given the League of Nations Mandate for Palestine. The Mandate was administered as two territories: Palestine and Transjordan, with the Jordan River being the boundary between them. The boundaries under the Mandate also did not follow those sought by the Jewish community, which sought the inclusion of the east bank of the Jordan into the Palestinian territory, to which the objective of the Mandate for a homeland for the Jewish people would apply. It was made clear from before the commencement of the Mandate, and a clause to that effect was inserted in the Mandate, that the objective set out in the Mandate would not apply to Transjordan following the passing of the Transjordan memorandum. Transjordan was destined for early independence. The objective of the Mandate was to apply only to territory west of the Jordan, which was commonly referred to as Palestine by the British administration, and as Eretz Israel by the Hebrew-speaking Jewish population.

====Peel Commission (1936–37)====
During the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine the British government formed the Peel Commission, which recommended the formation of a Jewish and an Arab state. It called for a small Jewish state in the Galilee and maritime strip, a British enclave stretching from Jerusalem to Jaffa, and an Arab state covering the rest. The Commission recommended the creation of a small Jewish state in a region less than 1/5 of the total area of Palestine. The Arab area was to be joined to Transjordan. The Arab population in the Jewish areas was to be removed, by force if necessary, and vice versa, although this would mean the movement of far more Arabs than Jews. The Zionist Congress rejected the proposal, while allowing the leadership to continue negotiating with the British. The Arab leadership rejected the proposal outright. It all came to nothing, as the British government shelved the proposal altogether by the middle of 1938.

In February 1939, the St. James Conference convened in London, but the Arab delegation refused to formally meet with its Jewish counterpart or to recognize them. The Conference ended on March 17, 1939, without making any progress. On May 17, 1939, the British government issued the White Paper of 1939, in which the idea of partitioning the Mandate was abandoned in favor of Jews and Arabs sharing one government and put strict quotas on further Jewish immigration. Because of impending World War II and the opposition from all sides, the plan was dropped.

World War II (1939–1945) gave a boost to the Jewish nationalism, as the Holocaust reaffirmed their call for a Jewish homeland. At the same time, many Arab leaders had even supported Nazi Germany, a fact which could not play well with the British. As a result, Britain pooled its energy into winning over Arab opinions by abandoning the Balfour Declaration and the terms of the League of Nations mandate which had been entrusted to it in order to create a &quot;Jewish National Home&quot;. Britain did this by issuing the 1939 white paper which officially allowed a further 75,000 Jews to move over five years (10,000 a year plus an additional 25,000) which was to be followed by Arab majority independence. The British would later claim that that quota had already been fulfilled by those who had entered without its approval.

====The Arab League and the Arab Higher Committee (1945)====
The framers of the Arab League sought to include the Palestinian Arabs within the framework of the League from its inception. An annex to the League Pact declared:
Even though Palestine was not able to control her own destiny, it was on the basis of the recognition of her independence that the Covenant of the League of Nations determined a system of government for her. Her existence and her independence among the nations can, therefore, no more be questioned &quot;de jure&quot; than the independence of any of the other Arab States... Therefore, the States signatory to the Pact of the Arab League consider that in view of Palestine&#x27;s special circumstances, the Council of the League should designate an Arab delegate from Palestine to participate in its work until this country enjoys actual independence.

In November 1945, the Arab League reconstituted the Arab Higher Committee comprising twelve members as the supreme executive body of Palestinian Arabs in the territory of the British Mandate of Palestine. The committee was dominated by the Palestine Arab Party and was immediately recognised by Arab League countries. The Mandate government recognised the new Committee two months later. The Constitution of the League of Arab States says the existence and independence of Palestine cannot be questioned &quot;de jure&quot; even though the outward signs of this independence have remained veiled as a result of &quot;force majeure&quot;.

In 1946, Jewish leaders – including Nahum Goldmann, Rabbi Abba Silver, Moshe Shertok, and David Ben-Gurion – proposed a union between Arab Palestine and Transjordan. Also in 1946, leaders of the Zionist movement in the U.S. sought the postponement of a determination of the application by Transjordan for United Nations membership until the status of Mandate Palestine as a whole was determined. However, at its final session the League of Nations recognized the independence of Transjordan, with the agreement of Britain.

In April 1947, during the activity of the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine, the Arab Higher Committee articulated its demands in the solution for the Question of Palestine:
# A complete cessation of the Jewish migration to Palestine.
# A total halt to the sale of land to Jews
# Cancelation of the British Mandate in Palestine and the Balfour Declaration.
# Recognition of the right of Arabs to their land and recognition of the independence of Palestine as a sovereign state, like all other Arab states, with a promise to provide minority rights to the Jews according to the rules of Democracy.

====1947 UN Partition Plan====

In 1947, the United Nations created the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP) to find an immediate solution to the Palestine question, which the British had handed over to the UN. The report indicated that the Arab state would be forced to call for financial assistance &quot;from international institutions in the way of loans for expansion of education, public health and other vital social services of a non-self-supporting nature.&quot; A technical note from the Secretariat explained that without some redistribution of customs from the Jewish state, Arab Palestine would not be economically viable. The committee was satisfied that the proposed Jewish State and the City of Jerusalem would be viable. The majority of the members of UNSCOP proposed certain recommendations for the UN General Assembly which on 29 November 1947 adopted a resolution recommending the adoption and implementation of the Partition Plan, based substantially on those proposals as Resolution 181(II). PART I: Future constitution and government of Palestine: A. Clause 3. provided as follows:- &quot;Independent Arab and Jewish States and the Special International Regime for the City of Jerusalem, set forth in part III of this plan, shall come into existence in Palestine two months after the evacuation of the armed forces of the mandatory Power has been completed but in any case not later than 1 October 1948&quot;. The resolution noted Britain&#x27;s planned termination of the British Mandate for Palestine and recommended the partition of Palestine into two states, one Arab and one Jewish, with the Jerusalem-Bethlehem area being under special international protection, administered by the United Nations. The resolution included a highly detailed description of the recommended boundaries for each proposed state. The resolution also contained a plan for an economic union between the proposed states, and a plan for the protection of religious and minority rights. The resolution sought to address the conflicting objectives and claims to the Mandate territory of two competing nationalist movements, Zionism (Jewish nationalism) and Arab nationalism, as well as to resolve the plight of Jews displaced as a result of the Holocaust. The resolution called for the withdrawal of British forces and termination of the Mandate by 1 August 1948, and establishment of the new independent states by 1 October 1948.

The leaders of the Jewish Agency for Palestine accepted the plan, while Arab leaders refused it.

In the October 1947 Arab League conference in Aley, the Arab states rejected the option of establishing an interim Palestinian Arab government and the Lebanese prime minister Riad Al Solh in particular told Hajj Amin al-Husseini that if a Palestinian Arab government will be established, he couldn&#x27;t be part of it. Abdul Rahman Hassan Azzam wanted the Arab League to manage the Arab struggle in Palestine.

King Abdullah I of Jordan met with a delegation headed by Golda Meir (who later became Prime Minister of Israel in 1968) to negotiate terms for accepting the partition plan, but rejected its proposal that Jordan remain neutral. Indeed, the king knew that the nascent Palestinian state would soon be absorbed by its Arab neighbors, and therefore had a vested interest in being party to the imminent war.

====Civil war 1947–48====
Soon after the UN resolution, less than half a year prior to the expiration of the British Mandate, large-scale fighting broke out between the Arab and Jewish communities in Palestine. By the time Israel declared its independence on 14 May 1948, the result of these five and a half months of fighting was, according to historian Benny Morris, a &quot;decisive Jewish victory&quot;. On one side, the &quot;Palestinian Arab military power was crushed&quot; and most of the Arab population in the combat zones was fleeing or had been driven out. On the other side, the &quot;Haganah transformed from a militia into an army&quot; and succeeded &quot;in consolidating its hold on a continuous strip of territory embracing the Coastal Plain, the Jezreel Valley, and the Jordan Valley&quot;. The Yishuv (the Jewish community and its &quot;state-in-waiting&quot;-type organisations) proved it had the capability to defend itself, persuading the United States and the remainder of the world to support it and the &quot;victory over the Palestinian Arabs gave the Haganah the experience and self-confidence [...] to confront [...] the invading armies of the Arab states.&quot;

On 12 April 1948, the Arab League announced:The Arab armies shall enter Palestine to rescue it. His Majesty (King Farouk, representing the League) would like to make it clearly understood that such measures should be looked upon as temporary and devoid of any character of the occupation or partition of Palestine, and that after completion of its liberation, that country would be handed over to its owners to rule in the way they like.

===1948 war until 1988===
====Arab–Israeli War (1948)====

On May 14, 1948, at the end of the British Mandate, the Jewish People&#x27;s Council gathered in Tel Aviv and the chairman of the Jewish Agency for Palestine, declared &quot;the establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz-Israel, to be known as the State of Israel.&quot; U.S. President Harry Truman recognised the State of Israel &quot;de facto&quot; the following day. The Arab countries declared war on the newly formed State of Israel heralding the start of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.

Armies of the neighbouring Arab states entered the former Mandate territories the next day starting the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. But some of the leaders of these countries had plans of their own for Palestine. As the Palestinian writer Hisham Sharabi would observe, Palestine had &quot;disappeared from the map&quot;.

As a result of the war, Egypt occupied the Gaza Strip, and in September 1948, formed the All-Palestine Government in Gaza, partly as an Arab League move to limit the influence of Jordan over the Palestinian issue. The former mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini, was appointed president. On October 1 of that year, the All-Palestine government declared an independent Palestinian state in all of Palestine region with Jerusalem as its capital. This government was recognised by Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen, but not by Jordan or any non-Arab country. However, it was little more than a facade under Egyptian control and had negligible influence or funding. Egypt did not permit unrestricted entry of Palestinians from Gaza into Egypt proper, and vice versa. In 1959, Gamal Abdel Nasser, president of Egypt, dissolved the All-Palestine government to rule the Gaza Strip directly.

King Abdullah I of Jordan sent the Arab Legion into the West Bank with no intention of withdrawing it following the war. Jordan annexed the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, granting citizenship to the Arab refugees and residents living in the West Bank against the objection of many Arab leaders who still hoped to establish an Arab state of Palestine. The country&#x27;s name was changed in 1949 from Transjordan to Jordan and Palestinians were given seats in the Jordanian Parliament. A royal decree in March 1949 forbade the use of the term &quot;Palestine&quot; in legal documents, and other measures were designed to emphasize that there would not be an independent Palestine. He also banned any opinion contrary to unification of the two territories and outlawed all All-Palestine Government activity within territories under his control.

After the war, which the Israelis call the War of Independence and the Palestinians call the Catastrophe, the 1949 Armistice Agreements established the separation lines between the combatants, leaving Israel in control of some of the areas which had been designated for the Arab state under the Partition Plan, Transjordan in control of the West Bank, Egypt in control of the Gaza Strip and Syria in control of the Himmah Area. The Arab League &quot;supervised&quot; the Egyptian trusteeship of the Palestinian government in Gaza after and secured assurances from Jordan that the 1950 Act of Union was &quot;without prejudice to the final settlement&quot;.

====Jordanian West Bank====
King Abdullah I of Jordan annexed the West Bank, granting citizenship to the Arab refugees and residents against the wishes of many Arab leaders who still hoped to establish an Arab state. Under Abdullah&#x27;s leadership, Arab hopes of independence were dealt a severe blow. In March he issued a royal decree forbidding the use of the term &quot;Palestine&quot; in any legal documents, and pursued other measures designed to make the fact that there would not be an independent Palestine clear and certain.

During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Transjordan occupied the area of Cisjordan, now called the West Bank (including East Jerusalem), which it continued to control in accordance with the 1949 Armistice Agreements and a political union formed in December 1948. Military Proclamation Number 2 of 1948 provided for the application in the West Bank of laws that were applicable in Palestine on the eve of the termination of the Mandate. On 2 November 1948, the military rule was replaced by a civilian administration by virtue of the Law Amending Public Administration Law in Palestine. Military Proclamation Number 17 of 1949, Section 2, vested the King of Jordan with all the powers that were enjoyed by the King of England, his ministers and the High Commissioner of Palestine by the Palestine Order-in-Council, 1922. Section 5 of this law confirmed that all laws, regulations and orders that were applicable in Palestine until the termination of the Mandate would remain in force until repealed or amended.

The Second Arab-Palestinian Congress was held in Jericho on 1 December 1948 at the end of the war. The delegates proclaimed Abdullah King of Palestine and called for a union of Arab Palestine with the Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan. Avi Plascov says that Abdullah contacted the Nashashibi opposition, local mayors, mukhars, those opposed to the Husaynis, and opposition members of the AHC. Plascov said that the Palestinian Congresses were conducted in accordance with prevailing Arab custom. He also said that contrary to the widely held belief outside Jordan the representatives did reflect the feelings of a large segment of the population.

The Transjordanian Government agreed to the unification on 7 December 1948, and on 13 December the Transjordanian parliament approved the creation of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. The change of status was reflected by the adoption of this new official name on 21 January 1949. Unification was ratified by a joint Jordanian National Assembly on 24 April 1950 which comprised twenty representatives each from the East and West Bank. The Act of Union contained a protective clause which preserved Arab rights in Palestine &quot;without prejudice to any final settlement&quot;.

Many legal scholars say the declaration of the Arab League and the Act of Union implied that Jordan&#x27;s claim of sovereignty was provisional, because it had always been subject to the emergence of the Palestinian state. A political union was legally established by the series of proclamations, decrees, and parliamentary acts in December 1948. Abdullah thereupon took the title King of Jordan, and he officially changed the country&#x27;s name to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in April 1949. The 1950 Act of Union confirmed and ratified King Abdullah&#x27;s actions. Following the annexation of the West Bank, only two countries formally recognized the union: Britain and Pakistan. Thomas Kuttner notes that de facto recognition was granted to the regime, most clearly evidenced by the maintaining of consulates in East Jerusalem by several countries, including the United States. Joseph Weiler agreed, and said that other states had engaged in activities, statements, and resolutions that would be inconsistent with non-recognition. Joseph Massad said that the members of the Arab League granted &quot;de facto&quot; recognition and that the United States had formally recognized the annexation, except for Jerusalem. The policy of the U.S. Department, was stated in a paper on the subject prepared for the Foreign Ministers meetings in London in May was in favor of the incorporation of Central Palestine into Jordan, but desired that it be done gradually and not by sudden proclamation. Once the annexation took place, the department approved of the action &quot;in the sense that it represents a logical development of the situation which took place as a result of a free expression of the will of the people... The United States continued to wish to avoid a public expression of approval of the union.&quot;

The United States government extended &quot;de jure&quot; recognition to the Government of Transjordan and the Government of Israel on the same day, 31 January 1949. U.S. President Truman told King Abdullah that the policy of the U.S. as regards a final territorial settlement in Palestine had been stated in the General Assembly on 30 November 1948 by the American representative. The U.S. supported Israeli claims to the boundaries set forth in the UN General Assembly resolution of 29 November 1947, but believed that if Israel sought to retain additional territory in Palestine allotted to the Arabs, it should give the Arabs territorial compensation. Clea Bunch said that &quot;President Truman crafted a balanced policy between Israel and its moderate Hashemite neighbours when he simultaneously extended formal recognition to the newly created state of Israel and the Kingdom of Transjordan. These two nations were inevitably linked in the President&#x27;s mind as twin emergent states: one serving the needs of the refugee Jew, the other absorbing recently displaced Palestinian Arabs. Truman was aware of the private agreements that existed between Jewish Agency leaders and King Abdullah I of Jordan. Thus, it made perfect sense to Truman to favour both states with &quot;de jure&quot; recognition.&quot;

Sandra Berliant Kadosh analyzed U.S. policy toward the West Bank in 1948, based largely on the Foreign Relations Documents of the United States. She noted that the U.S. government believed that the most satisfactory solution regarding the disposition of the greater part of Arab Palestine would be incorporation in Transjordan and that the State Department approved the Principle underlying the Jericho resolutions. Kadosh said that the delegates claimed to represent 90 percent of the population, and that they ridiculed the Gaza government. They asserted that it represented only its eighty-odd members.

====All-Palestine====

In Gaza, the All-Palestine Government was formed prior to the war&#x27;s end in September 1948. The government, under the leadership of the Mufti of Jerusalem Mohammad Amin al-Husayni, declared the independence of the Palestinian state, with Jerusalem as its capital. The All-Palestine Government would go on to be recognized by Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen, while Jordan and the other Arab states refused to recognize it.

Egypt supervised the government of Palestine in Gaza as a trustee on behalf of the Arab League. An Egyptian Ministerial order dated 1 June 1948 declared that all laws in force during the Mandate would continue to be in force in the Gaza Strip. Another order issued on 8 August 1948 vested an Egyptian Administrator-General with the powers of the High Commissioner. The All-Palestine Government had very limited power however, as Egypt maintained control over Gaza&#x27;s administration. The All-Palestine Government was under official Egyptian protection, but on the other hand it had no executive role, but rather mostly political and symbolic. Its importance gradually declined, especially with the government seat relocation from Gaza to Cairo in December 1948.

Shortly thereafter, the Jericho Conference named King Abdullah I of Transjordan, &quot;King of Arab Palestine&quot;. The Congress called for the union of Arab Palestine and Transjordan and Abdullah announced his intention to annex the West Bank. The other Arab League member states opposed Abdullah&#x27;s plan.

The U.S. advised the Arab states that the U.S. attitude regarding Israel had been clearly stated in the UN by Dr. Jessup on 20 November 1949. He said that the U.S. supported Israeli claims to the boundaries set forth in the UN General Assembly resolution. However, the U.S. believed that if Israel sought to retain additional territory in Palestine it should give the Arabs other territory as compensation. The Israelis agreed that the boundaries were negotiable, but did not agree to the principle of compensation as a precondition. Israel&#x27;s Foreign Minister Eban stressed that it was undesirable to undermine what had already been accomplished by the armistice agreements, and maintained that Israel held no territory wrongfully, since her occupation of the areas had been sanctioned by the armistice agreements, as had the occupation of the territory in Palestine held by the Arab states.

In late 1949, under the auspices of the UNCCP, their subsidiary Economic Survey Mission for the Middle East, headed by Gordon R. Clapp, recommended four development projects, involving the Wadi Zerqa basin in Jordan, the Wadi Qelt watershed and stream bed in Arab Palestine, the Litani River in Lebanon, and the Ghab valley in Syria. The World Bank considered the mission&#x27;s plans positive, and U.S. President Harry Truman subsequently announced that the Foreign Economic Assistance Act of 1950 contained an appropriation of US$27 million for the development projects recommended by the Clapp Mission and to assist Palestinian refugees.

In a diplomatic conversation held on 5 June 1950 between Stuart W. Rockwell of the State Department&#x27;s Office of African and Near Eastern Affairs and Abdel Monem Rifai, a Counselor of the Jordan Legation. Rifai asked when the U.S. was going to recognize the union of Arab Palestine and Jordan. Rockwell explained the Department&#x27;s position, stating that it was not the custom of the U.S. to issue formal statements of recognition every time a foreign country changed its territorial area. The union of Arab Palestine and Jordan had been brought about as a result of the will of the people and the U.S. accepted the fact that Jordanian sovereignty had been extended to the new area. Rifai said he had not realized this and that he was very pleased to learn that the U.S. did in fact recognize the union. The U.S. State Department published this memorandum of conversation in 1978.

In 1957, the Basic Law of Gaza established a Legislative Council that could pass laws which were given to the High Administrator-General for approval. In 1959, Egyptian president Gamal Abdul Nasser ordered the dismantling of the All-Palestine Protectorate for good. In March 1962, a Constitution for the Gaza Strip was issued confirming the role of the Legislative Council. The All-Palestine Protectorate is regarded by some as the first attempt to establish an independent Palestinian state, whilst most just saw it as an Egyptian puppet, only to be annulled a few years after its creation by no less than President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt.

====Six-Day War (1967)====

In June 1967, Israel captured and occupied the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, from Jordan, the Gaza Strip and Sinai Peninsula from Egypt, and the area of Golan Heights from Syria as a result of the Six-Day War. Israel, which was ordered to withdraw from territories occupied during the war in exchange for Arab recognition and the negotiation of final borders by United Nations Security Council Resolution 242, unilaterally annexed East Jerusalem and later applied Israeli civil law to the Golan Heights. On 9 June 1967, Israeli Foreign Minister Eban assured the U.S. that it was not seeking territorial aggrandizement and had no &quot;colonial&quot; aspirations. U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk stressed to Israel that no settlement with Jordan would be accepted by the global community unless it gave Jordan some special position in the Old City of Jerusalem. The U.S. also assumed Jordan would receive the bulk of the West Bank as that was regarded as Jordanian territory.

The international community considers the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, held under military occupation by Israel subject to the Fourth Geneva Convention. Israel does not accept that the Fourth Geneva Convention applies &quot;de jure&quot;, but has stated that on humanitarian issues it will govern itself &quot;de facto&quot; by its provisions, without specifying which these are. The Gaza Strip is still considered to be occupied by the United Nations, international human rights organisations, and the majority of governments and legal commentators, despite the 2005 Israeli disengagement from Gaza.

On 3 November 1967, U.S. Ambassador Goldberg called on King Hussein of Jordan, saying that the U.S. was committed to the principle of political independence and territorial integrity and was ready to reaffirm it bilaterally and publicly in the Security Council resolution. According to Goldberg, the U.S. believed in territorial integrity, withdrawal, and recognition of secure boundaries. Goldberg said the principle of territorial integrity has two important sub-principles, there must be a withdrawal to recognized and secure frontiers for all countries, not necessarily the old armistice lines, and there must be mutuality in adjustments.

The U.S. President&#x27;s Special Assistant, Walt Rostow, told Israeli ambassador Harmon that he had already stressed to Foreign Minister Eban that the U.S. expected the thrust of the settlement would be toward security and demilitarisation arrangements rather than toward major changes in the armistice lines. Harmon said the Israeli position was that Jerusalem should be an open city under unified administration, but that the Jordanian interest in Jerusalem could be met through arrangements including &quot;sovereignty&quot;. Rostow said the U.S. government assumed (and Harman confirmed) that despite public statements to the contrary, the Government of Israel position on Jerusalem was that which Eban, Harman, and Evron had given several times, that Jerusalem was negotiable.

Following the outbreak of fighting in Jordan in September 1970 between the Jordanian army and Palestinian guerilla, the US government began considering the creation of a separate Palestinian political entity. However, a Palestinian state was the least considered alternative. A State Department memo of 1970 stated in that regard:

such a state would presumably have to be limited to the West Bank and Gaza, it would probably not be economically viable without the injection of large-scale outside financial assistance. Its political viability is also doubtful, since a large number of Palestinians would remain outside its borders and it would tend to be dominated by a larger and more powerful Israel.
====PLO and the binational state solution====
Before the Six-Day War, the movement for an independent Palestine received a boost in 1964 when the Palestine Liberation Organization was established. Its goal, as stated in the Palestinian National Covenant was to create a Palestinian state in the whole British Mandate, a statement which nullified Israel&#x27;s right to exist. The PLO would become the leading force in the Palestinian national movement politically, and its leader, Egyptian-born Yassir Arafat, would become regarded as the leader of the Palestinian people.

In 1969, the Fatah movement, accepting as a &quot;fait accompli&quot; the presence in Palestine of a large number of Jews, declared that it was not fighting against Jews, but against Israel as a racist and theocratic entity. The fifth national council of the Palestine Liberation Organisation in February 1969 passed a resolution confirming that the PLO&#x27;s objective was &quot;to establish a free and democratic society in Palestine for all Palestinians whether they are Muslims, Christians or Jews&quot;. The PLO was not successful in building support for the binational solution within Israeli society, however, which lay the groundwork for an eventual re-scoping of the PLO&#x27;s aim toward partition into two states.

====Rift between Jordan and Palestinian leadership (1970)====
After the events of Black September in Jordan, the rift between the Palestinian leadership and the Kingdom of Jordan continued to widen. The Arab League affirmed the right of the Palestinian people to &quot;self-determination&quot; and called on all the Arab states, including Jordan, to undertake to defend Palestinian national unity and not to interfere in internal Palestinian affairs. The Arab League also &#x27;affirmed the right of the Palestinian people to establish an independent national authority under the command of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people in any Palestinian territory that is liberated.&#x27; King Ḥussein dissolved the Jordanian parliament. Half of its members had been West Bank representatives. He renounced Jordanian claims to the West Bank, and allowed the PLO to assume responsibility as the Provisional Government of Palestine. The Kingdom of Jordan, Egypt, and Syria no longer act as the legitimate representatives of the Palestinian people, or their territory.

====Ten Point Program====
In 1974, the PLO adopted the &quot;Ten Point Program&quot;, which called for the establishment of an Israeli-Palestinian democratic, binational state (a one state solution). It also called for the establishment of Palestinian rule on &quot;any part&quot; of its liberated territory, as a step towards &quot;completing the liberation of all Palestinian territory, and as a step along the road to comprehensive Arab unity.&quot; While this was not seen by Israel as a significant moderation of PLO policy, the phrasing was extremely controversial within the PLO itself, where it was widely regarded as a move towards a two-state solution. The adoption of the program, under pressure from Arafat&#x27;s Fatah faction and some minor groups (e.g. DFLP, al-Sa&#x27;iqa) led many hard-line groups to break away from the Arafat and the mainstream PLO members, forming the Rejectionist Front. To some extent, this split is still evident today. Declassified diplomatic documents reveal that in 1974, on the eve of the UN debate that granted the PLO an observer status, some parts of the PLO leadership were considering to proclaim the formation of a Palestinian government in exile at some point. This plan, however, was not carried out.

At the Rabat summit conference in 1974, Jordan and the other members of the Arab League declared that the Palestine Liberation Organization was the &quot;sole legitimate representative of the [Arab] Palestinian people&quot;, thereby relinquishing to that organization its role as representative of the West Bank.

During the 1978 Camp David negotiations between Israel and Egypt Anwar Sadat proposed the creation of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza. Israel refused.

In a speech delivered on 1 September 1982, U.S. President Ronald Reagan called for a settlement freeze and continued to support full Palestinian autonomy in political union with Jordan. He also said that &quot;It is the United States&#x27; position that – in return for peace – the withdrawal provision of Resolution 242 applies to all fronts, including the West Bank and Gaza.&quot;

The Amman Agreement of 11 February 1985, declared that the PLO and Jordan would pursue a proposed confederation between the state of Jordan and a Palestinian state. In 1988, King Hussein dissolved the Jordanian parliament and renounced Jordanian claims to the West Bank. The PLO assumed responsibility as the Provisional Government of Palestine and an independent state was declared.

==Timeline==
===Declaration of the state in 1988===
The declaration of a State of Palestine () took place in Algiers on November 15, 1988, by the Palestinian National Council, the legislative body of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). It was approved by the Palestinian National Council (PNC) by a vote of 253 in favour, 46 against and 10 abstentions. It was read by Yasser Arafat at the closing session of the 19th PNC to a standing ovation. Upon completing the reading of the declaration, Arafat, as Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization assumed the title of &quot;President of Palestine&quot;. By the 1988 declaration, the PNC empowered its central council to form a government-in-exile when appropriate, and called upon its executive committee to perform the duties of the government-in-exile until its establishment.

The borders of the state were not specified. Jordan extended recognition to the state and ceded its claim to the West Bank to the Palestinian Liberation Organisation, which had been previously designated by the Arab League as the &quot;sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people&quot;.

The Palestinian National Authority (PNA), the United States, the European Union, and the Arab League, envision the establishment of a State of Palestine to include all or part of the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem, living in peace with Israel under a democratically elected and transparent government. The PNA, however, does not claim sovereignty over any territory and therefore is not the government of the State of Palestine proclaimed in 1988.
Referring to &quot;the historical injustice inflicted on the Palestinian Arab people resulting in their dispersion and depriving them of their right to self-determination,&quot; the declaration recalled the Treaty of Lausanne (1923) and UN General Assembly Resolution 181 (1947 Partition Plan) as supporting the rights of Palestinians and Palestine. The declaration then proclaims a &quot;State of Palestine on our Palestinian territory with its capital Jerusalem&quot;. The borders of the declared State of Palestine were not specified. The population of the state was referred to by the statement: &quot;The State of Palestine is the state of Palestinians wherever they may be&quot;. The state was defined as an Arab country by the statement: &quot;The State of Palestine is an Arab state, an integral and indivisible part of the Arab nation&quot;. The declaration was accompanied by a PNC call for multilateral negotiations on the basis of UN Security Council Resolution 242. This call was later termed &quot;the Historic Compromise&quot;, as it implied acceptance of the &quot;two-state solution&quot;, namely that it no longer questioned the legitimacy of the State of Israel. The PNC&#x27;s political communiqué accompanying the declaration called only for withdrawal from &quot;Arab Jerusalem&quot; and the other &quot;Arab territories occupied.&quot; Arafat&#x27;s statements in Geneva a month later were accepted by the United States as sufficient to remove the ambiguities it saw in the declaration and to fulfill the longheld conditions for open dialogue with the United States.

As a result of the declaration, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) convened, inviting Arafat, Chairman of the PLO to give an address. An UNGA resolution was adopted &quot;acknowledging the proclamation of the State of Palestine by the Palestine National Council on 15 November 1988,&quot; and it was further decided that &quot;the designation &#x27;Palestine&#x27; should be used in place of the designation &#x27;Palestine Liberation Organization&#x27; in the United Nations system,&quot; and it delegate was assigned a seated in the UN General Assembly immediately after non-member states, and before all other observers. One hundred and four states voted for this resolution, forty-four abstained, and two – the United States and Israel – voted against. By mid-December, seventy-five states had recognized Palestine, rising to eighty-nine states by February 1989.

The declaration is generally interpreted to be a major step on the path to Israel&#x27;s recognition by the Palestinians. Just as in Israel&#x27;s declaration of independence, it partly bases its claims on UN GA 181. By reference to &quot;resolutions of Arab Summits&quot; and &quot;UN resolutions since 1947&quot; (like SC 242) it implicitly and perhaps ambiguously restricted its immediate claims to the Palestinian territories and Jerusalem. It was accompanied by a political statement that explicitly mentioned SC 242 and other UN resolutions and called only for withdrawal from &quot;Arab Jerusalem&quot; and the other &quot;Arab territories occupied.&quot; Yasser Arafat&#x27;s statements in Geneva a month later were accepted by the United States as sufficient to remove the ambiguities it saw in the declaration and to fulfill the longheld conditions for open dialogue with the United States.

===Palestinian Authority (1994)===
Under the terms of the Oslo Accords signed between Israel and the PLO, the latter assumed control over the Jericho area of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip on 17 May 1994. On 28 September 1995, following the signing of the Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement on the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Israeli military forces withdrew from the West Bank towns of Nablus, Ramallah, Jericho, Jenin, Tulkarem, Qalqilya and Bethlehem. In December 1995, the PLO also assumed responsibility for civil administration in 17 areas in Hebron. While the PLO assumed these responsibilities as a result of Oslo, a new temporary interim administrative body was set up as a result of the Accords to carry out these functions on the ground: the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).

According to Omar Dajani, the relationship between the PLO and PNA (or PA) in light of the interim arrangements of Oslo Accords may be stating as &quot;Palestine may best be described as a transitional association between the PA and the PLO.&quot; He goes on to explain that this transitional association accords the PA responsibility for local government and the PLO responsibility for representation of the Palestinian people in the international arena, while prohibiting it from concluding international agreements that affect the status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. This situation is said to be accepted by the Palestinian population insofar as it is viewed as a temporary arrangement.

In 2005, following the implementation of Israel&#x27;s unilateral disengagement plan, PNA gained full control of the Gaza Strip with the exception of its borders, airspace, and territorial waters. This increased the percentage of land in the Gaza strip nominally governed by the PA from 60 percent to 100 percent.

The West Bank and Gaza Strip continued to be considered by the international community to be Occupied Palestinian Territory, notwithstanding the 1988 declaration of Palestinian independence, the limited self-government accorded to the Palestinian Authority as a result of the 1993 Oslo Accords, and Israel&#x27;s withdrawal from Gaza as part of the Israel&#x27;s unilateral disengagement plan of 2005, which saw the dismantlement of four Israeli settlements in the West Bank and all settlements in the Gaza Strip.

In March 2008, it was reported that the PA was working to increase the number of countries that recognize Palestine and that a PA representative had signed a bilateral agreement between the State of Palestine and Costa Rica. An Al-Haq position paper (2009) said the reality is that the PA has entered into various agreements with international organizations and states. These instances of foreign relations undertaken by the PA signify that the Interim Agreement is part of a larger on-going peace process, and that the restrictions on the foreign policy operations of the PA conflict with the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, now a norm with a nature of jus cogens, which includes a right to engage in international relations with other peoples. Israeli government and many experts consider such actions as violation of the Oslo Accords.

When the PA is exercising the power that is granted to them by the Oslo Accords, they&#x27;re acting in the capacity of an agency whose authority is based on an agreement between Israel and the PLO and not as a state.

====Split of Fatah and Hamas====

In 2007, after Hamas&#x27;s legislative victories, the Fatah and Hamas engaged into a violent conflict, taking place mainly in the Gaza Strip, leading to effective collapse of the Palestinian national unity government. After the takeover in Gaza by Hamas on 14 June 2007, Palestinian Authority Chairman Abbas dismissed the Hamas-led government and appointed Salam Fayyad as Prime Minister. Though the new government&#x27;s authority is claimed to extend to all Palestinian territories, in effect it became limited to the West Bank, as Hamas hasn&#x27;t recognized the move and continued to rule the Gaza Strip. While PNA budget comes mainly from various aid programs and support of the Arab League, the Hamas Government in Gaza became dependent mainly on Iran until the eruption of the Arab Spring.

===Palestine in the United Nations===
====2011 United Nations membership application====

After a two-year impasse in negotiations with Israel, the Palestinian Authority sought to gain recognition as a state according to its 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital from the UN General Assembly in September 2011. A successful application for membership in the UN would require approval from the UN Security Council and a two-thirds majority in the UN General Assembly.

On the prospect of this being successful, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice alluded to a potential U.S. government withdrawal of UN funding: &quot;This would be exceedingly politically damaging in our domestic context, as you can well imagine. And I cannot frankly think of a greater threat to our ability to maintain financial and political support for the United Nations in Congress than such an outcome.&quot; On 28 June, the U.S. Senate passed calling on U.S. President Barack Obama to veto the motion and threatening a withdrawal of aid to the West Bank if the Palestinians followed through on their plans. At the likely prospect of a veto, Palestinian leaders signalled they might opt instead for a more limited upgrade to &quot;non-member state&quot; status, which requires only the approval of the UN General Assembly.

Mahmoud Abbas stated he would accept a return to negotiations and abandon the decision if the Israelis agree to the 1967 borders and the right of return for Palestinian refugees. Israel labelled the plan as a unilateral step, to which Foreign Minister Erekat replied,&quot;We are not going [to the UN] for a unilateral declaration of the Palestinian state. We declared our state in 1988 and we have embassies in more than 130 countries and more countries are recognising our state on the 1967 borders. The recognition of the Palestinian state is a sovereignty decision by the countries and it doesn&#x27;t need to happen through the UN.&quot; The Arab League formally backed the plan in May, and was officially confirmed by the PLO on 26 June.

On 11 July, the Quartet on the Middle East met to discuss a return to negotiations, but the meeting produced no result. On 13 July, in an interview with &quot;Haaretz&quot;, Palestinian Ambassador to the United Nations Riyad Mansour claimed that 122 states had so far extended formal recognition to the Palestinian state. On the following day, the Arab League released a draft statement which declared a consensus to &quot;go to the United Nations to request the recognition of the State of Palestine with Al Quds as its capital and to move ahead and request a full membership.&quot; The league&#x27;s secretary-general, Nabil al-Arabi, confirmed the statement and said that the application for membership will be submitted by the Arab League. On 18 July, Syria announced that it had formally recognised the State of Palestine, the last Arab state to do so. The decision was welcomed by the league, but met with criticism from some, including former Lebanese prime minister Selim al-Hoss: &quot;Syria has always been calling for the liberation of Palestine from Israeli occupation and ambitions. The latest stance, however, shows that [Syria] has given up on a national policy that has spanned several decades. ... Why this abandonment of a national principle, and what is the motive behind it? There is no motive except to satisfy international powers that seek to appease Israel&quot;.

On 23 September, Abbas delivered to the UN Secretary-General the official application for recognition of a Palestinian state by the UN and a membership in the same organization. On 11 November a report was approved by the Security Council which concluded that the council had been unable &quot;to make a unanimous recommendation&quot; on membership for Palestine.

====2011 UNESCO membership====
The PLO was accorded observer status at UNESCO in 1974. In 1989, an application for the admission of Palestine as a member state was submitted by a group of seven states during the 131st session of UNESCO&#x27;s executive board. The board postponed a decision until the next session, and the item was included on each session&#x27;s agenda thereafter, being repeatedly deferred. During the board&#x27;s 187th session in September 2011, a draft resolution was presented by 24 states requesting that the application be considered and Palestine be granted membership in the organisation. Following consultations between the representatives of the 58-member board, the draft resolution was put for voting on 5 October. The board voted in favour of recommending the application, winning the approval of 40 states. The resolution to admit Palestine as the agency&#x27;s 195th member state was adopted at the 36th General Conference on 31 October. Of the 185 dues-paying members eligible for voting, 107 were in favour, 14 were against, 52 abstained and 12 were absent. The resolution was submitted by a total of 43 states. Its membership was ratified on 23 November.

====Non-member Observer State status in the UN (2012)====
By September 2012, with their application for full membership stalled, Palestinian representatives had decided to pursue an upgrade in status from &quot;observer entity&quot; to &quot;non-member observer state&quot;. On November 27 it was announced that the appeal had been officially made, and would be put to a vote in the General Assembly on November 29, where their status upgrade was expected to be supported by a majority of states. In addition to granting Palestine &quot;non-member observer state status&quot;, the draft resolution &quot;expresses the hope that the Security Council will consider favorably the application submitted on 23 September 2011 by the State of Palestine for admission to full membership in the United Nations, endorses the two state solution based on the pre-1967 borders, and stresses the need for an immediate resumption of negotiations between the two parties.&quot;

On Thursday, November 29, 2012, in a 138–9 vote (with 41 abstentions and 5 absences), General Assembly resolution 67/19 was adopted, upgrading Palestine to &quot;non-member observer state&quot; status in the United Nations. The new status equates Palestine&#x27;s with that of the Holy See. Switzerland was also a non-member observer state until 2002. The change in status was described by &quot;The Independent&quot; as &quot;&quot;de facto&quot; recognition of the sovereign state of Palestine&quot;.

The vote was a historic benchmark for the recognition of the State of Palestine, whilst it was widely considered a diplomatic setback for Israel and the United States. Status as an observer state in the UN allows the State of Palestine to participate in general debate at the General Assembly, to co-sponsor resolutions, to join treaties and specialized UN agencies. Even as a nonmember state, the Palestinians could join influential international bodies such as the World Trade Organization, the World Health Organization, the World Intellectual Property Organization, the World Bank and the International Criminal Court, where Palestinian Authority tried to have alleged Israeli war crimes in Gaza (2008-2009) investigated. However, in April 2012 prosecutors refused to open the investigation, saying it was not clear if the Palestinians were qualified as a state - as only states can recognize the court&#x27;s jurisdiction. But the prosecutor confirmed explicitly in 2014 that the upgrade of November 2012 qualified the state of Palestine to join the Rome statute. On 31 December 2014 Palestinian President Abbas signed a declaration in which Palestine recognized the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court for any crimes committed in the Palestinian territory since 13 June 2014.

The UN now can also help to affirm the borders of the Palestinian territories that Israel occupied in 1967. Theoretically Palestine could even claim legal rights over its territorial waters and air space as a sovereign state recognised by the UN.

The UN has, after the resolution was passed, permitted Palestine to title its representative office to the UN as &#x27;The Permanent Observer Mission of the &quot;State of&quot; Palestine to the United Nations&#x27;, seen by many as a reflexion of the UN&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; recognition of the State of Palestine&#x27;s sovereignty, and Palestine has started to re-title its name accordingly on postal stamps, official documents and passports. The Palestinian authorities have also instructed its diplomats to officially represent &#x27;The State of Palestine&#x27;, as opposed to the &#x27;Palestine National Authority&#x27;. On 17 December 2012, UN Chief of Protocol Yeocheol Yoon decided that &#x27;the designation of &quot;State of Palestine&quot; shall be used by the Secretariat in all official United Nations documents&#x27;. In January 2013, by an official decree of the Palestinian Authority President Mahmud Abbas, the Palestinian Authority has officially transformed all of its designations into the State of Palestine.

===2013 State of Palestine decree===
Following the successful passage of the 2012 United Nations status resolution which changed Palestine&#x27;s status at the UN to that of observer state, on 3 January 2013, Abbas signed a presidential decree 1/2013 officially changing the name of the &#x27;Palestinian Authority&#x27; to the &#x27;State of Palestine&#x27;. The decree stated that &quot;Official documents, seals, signs and letterheads of the Palestinian National Authority official and national institutions shall be amended by replacing the name ‘Palestinian National Authority’ whenever it appears by the name ‘State of Palestine’ and by adopting the emblem of the State of Palestine.&quot; According to international lawyer John V. Whitbeck the decree results in absorbing of the Palestinian Authority into the State of Palestine. On 8 January 2013 the Minister of Communication Safa Nassereddin, said that because issuing new stamps requires Israeli approval to print them and bring them into the country, it was decided that the new stamps will be printed in Bahrain and the first of these stamps will be used by Palestinian embassies and other diplomatic missions abroad.

On 5 January 2013 Abbas ordered all Palestinian embassies to change any official reference to the Palestinian Authority into State of Palestine. Missions in countries that voted &quot;against&quot; UNGA resolution 67/19 of 2012 are ordered to consult the foreign ministry. Three days later, Omar Awadallah, a foreign ministry official, said that those missions should also use the new name. Some of the countries themselves, such as Norway, Sweden and Spain, stick to the Palestinian Authority term even though they voted &quot;in favor&quot; of the UNGA resolution.

On 6 January 2013, Abbas ordered his cabinet of ministers to prepare regulations to issue new Palestinian passports, official signs and postage stamps in the name of the &#x27;State of Palestine&#x27;. Two days later, following a negative reaction by Israel, it was announced that the change will not apply to documents used at Israel checkpoints in the West Bank and Israeli crossings, unless there is a further decision by Abbas. Saeb Erekat then said the new emblem will be used in correspondence with countries that have recognized a state of Palestine.

For the time being the governments of the renamed Authority established in 1994 and of the State established in 1988 remain distinct. On 5 January 2013 it was announced that it is expected the PLO Central Council would take over the functions of the Palestinian Authority&#x27;s government and parliament. On the following day, Saeb Erekat, head of the PLO negotiations department, said that the authority should draft a new constitution.

Following the change in name, Turkey became the first state to recognize this change, and on 15 April 2013, the Turkish Consul-General in East Jerusalem Şakir Torunlar presented his credentials as first Turkish Ambassador to the State of Palestine to Palestinian President in Ramallah.

==Peace process==

===Oslo accords===
In the 1990s, outstanding steps were taken which formally began a process the goal of which was to solve the Arab–Israeli conflict through a two-state solution. Beginning with the Madrid Conference of 1991 and culminating in the 1993 Oslo Peace Accords between Palestinians and Israelis, the peace process has laid the framework for Palestinian autonomy in the West Bank and in Gaza. According to the Oslo Accords, signed by Yassir Arafat and then Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in Washington, Israel would pull out of the Gaza Strip and cities in the West Bank. East Jerusalem, which had been annexed by Israel in 1980 was not mentioned in any of the agreements.

Following the landmark accords, the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) was established to govern those areas from which Israel was to pull out. The PNA was granted limited autonomy over a non-contiguous area, though it does govern most Palestinian population centers.

The process stalled with the collapse of the Camp David 2000 Summit between Palestinians and Israel, after which the second Intifada broke out.

Israel ceased acting in cooperation with the PNA. In the shadow of the rising death toll from the violence, the United States initiated the Road Map for Peace (published on June 24, 2002), which was intended to end the Intifada by disarming the Palestinian terror groups and creating an independent Palestinian state. The Road Map has stalled awaiting the implementation of the step required by the first phase of that plan with then Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon stating within weeks of the release of the final text that a settlement freeze, one of Israel&#x27;s main requirements, would be &quot;impossible&quot; because of the need for settlers to build new houses and start families. It remains stalled because of Israel&#x27;s continuing refusal to comply with the requirement to freeze settlement expansion and the civil war between Hamas and Fatah, except that on April 27, 2011, it was announced that Hamas and Fatah had reached a reconciliation agreement in a pact which was brokered by Egypt. Hamas, Fatah, and the other Palestinian political factions signed the reconciliation agreement in the official signing ceremony of that agreement which took place on May 4, 2011.

In 2005, Israel unilaterally withdrew from the Gaza Strip as part of the Disengagement Plan.

In 2008, U.S.-brokered negotiations were ongoing between Palestinian Chairman Mahmoud Abbas and the outgoing Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Olmert.

In 2011, Al Jazeera published thousands of classified documents that it had received from sources close to negotiators in the 2008 negotiation talks between Israeli Prime Minister Olmert and Palestinian Chairman Mahmoud Abbas. The documents, dubbed the Palestine Papers, showed that in private the Palestinians had made major concessions on issues that had scuttled previous negotiations. Olmert also presented his ideas for the borders for a Palestinian state, dubbed the &quot;Napkin Map&quot; because of Abbas having to sketch the map on a napkin because Olmert refused to allow Abbas to keep a copy for further consideration. Olmert&#x27;s proposal largely followed the route of the Israeli West Bank barrier, and placed all of the Israeli settlement blocs and East Jerusalem Jewish neighbourhoods under Israeli sovereignty. Israel would retain around 10% of the West Bank and in return the Palestinians would receive around 5% of Israeli territory adjacent to the southern West Bank and lands adjacent to the Gaza Strip.

===Direct talks in 2010===

In early September 2010 the first peace talks since the Gaza war in 2009 were held in Washington DC between Israeli prime-minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas. The pace of the talks were assessed by the US as &quot;break through&quot;. However, on 25 September Netanyahu did not renew a 10-month moratorium on settlement construction in the West Bank, which brought him severe criticism from the United States, Europe and the United Nations. Abbas stated that Netanyahu could not be trusted as a &#x27;true&#x27; peace negotiator if the freeze was not extended. Netanyahu&#x27;s failure to uphold the commitments he made just a few weeks earlier &quot;to reaching a comprehensive peace agreement with Palestinians&quot; through extending the term of moratorium has caused a &quot;de facto&quot; halt of peace negotiations.

On 28 September 2010, Israeli foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman, leader of the ultra-nationalist Yisrael Beiteinu party, presented to the UN a ″peace plan″ according to which ″parts of Israel&#x27;s territory populated predominantly by Israeli Arabs would be transferred to a newly created Palestinian state, in return for annexation of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and/or population swap″. The statement came about while Israeli prime-minister Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Abbas were holding peace talks mediated by the United States. In the press conference on 28 September Netanyahu stated &quot;Israel, Palestinians can reach Middle-East peace in a year&quot;. However, Liberman&#x27;s controversial proposal means that &quot;the conflict will not be solved within a year and that implementation of the peace agreement will take generations&quot;. Lieberman&#x27;s proposal was viewed as undermining Netanyahu&#x27;s credibility in the discussions and causing embarrassment for the Israeli government. According to a New York Jewish leader &quot;Every time when Lieberman voices skepticism for peace talks, he gives Abu Mazen [Abbas] and the Arab League an opportunity to reinforce their claim that Netanyahu isn&#x27;t serious.&quot; On 29 September, while commenting on the Lieberman proposal Netanyahu said that &quot;I didn&#x27;t see [the] speech beforehand, but I don&#x27;t reject the idea.&quot;

The proposal also caused wide &#x27;outrage&#x27; among Israelis and US Jews. Seymour Reich, a former president of the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations stated that &quot;If Lieberman can&#x27;t keep his personal opinions to himself, he ought to resign from the cabinet.&quot;

===Positions===

The 2013 position of the Palestinian Authority was that all of the West Bank and Gaza Strip should form the basis of a future &quot;State of Palestine&quot;. For additional discussion, see Palestinian territories. Israeli governments have maintained that the area involved is subject to future negotiations, and within territorial dispute. However, the position of the Islamic&lt;ref name=&quot;islamist/islamic&quot;&gt;* &quot;Hamas is a radical Islamic fundamentalist organization that has stated that its highest priority is a Jihad (holy war) for the liberation of Palestine ...&quot; &quot;Peace and War: The Arab–Israeli Military Balance Enters the 21st Century&quot;, by Anthony H.

* &lt;/ref&gt; Hamas faction of the PA, as stated in its founding Covenant, is that Palestine (meaning all of Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip) is rightfully an Islamic state.

The main discussion since 1993 has focused on turning most or all of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank into an independent Palestinian state. This was the basis for the Oslo accords, and it is, as a matter of official policy, favoured by the U.S. The status of Israel within the 1949 Armistice lines has not been the subject of international negotiations. Some members of the PLO recognize Israel&#x27;s right to exist within these boundaries; others hold that Israel must eventually be destroyed. Consequently, some Israelis hold that Palestinian statehood is impossible with the current PLO as a basis, and needs to be delayed.

Israel declares that its security demands that a &quot;Palestinian entity&quot; would not have all attributes of a state, at least initially, so that in case things go wrong, Israel would not have to face a dangerous and nearby enemy. Israel may be therefore said to agree (as of now) not to a complete and independent Palestinian state, but rather to a self-administering entity, with partial but not full sovereignty over its borders and its citizens.

The central Palestinian position is that they have already compromised greatly by accepting a state covering only the areas of the West Bank and Gaza. These areas are significantly less territory than allocated to the Arab state in UN Resolution 181. They feel that it is unacceptable for an agreement to impose additional restrictions (such as level of militarization, see below) which, they declare, makes a viable state impossible. In particular, they are angered by significant increases in the population of Israeli settlements and communities in the West Bank and Gaza Strip during the interim period of the Oslo accords. Palestinians claim that they have already waited long enough, and that Israel&#x27;s interests do not justify depriving their state of those rights that they consider important. The Palestinians have been unwilling to accept a territorially disjointed state.

==Parties which recognise a Palestinian entity separate from Israel==

* There are conflicting reports about the number of countries that extended their recognition to the proclaimed State of Palestine. In Annex 2 of the Request for the Admission of the State of Palestine to UNESCO from 12 May 1982, several Arab and African countries provided a list of 92 countries allegedly having extended such recognition. In the same document (Corrigendum 1), it is requested that Austria be removed from the list. Namibia is listed even though it was not independent at the time. The list also includes a considerable number of states that ceased to exist during the 1990s, most notably the German Democratic Republic, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Democratic Yemen, People&#x27;s Republic of Kampuchea (today: Cambodia) and Zaire (today: Democratic Republic of the Congo). On 13 February 2008, The Palestinian Authorities&#x27; Minister of Foreign Affairs announced he could provide documents for the recognition of 67 countries in the proclaimed State of Palestine. The existing countries that are known to have extended such recognition include most Arab League nations, most African nations, and several Asian nations, including China and India.
*Many countries, including European countries, the United States and Israel recognize the Palestinian Authority established in 1994, as per the Oslo Accords, as an autonomous geopolitical entity without extending recognition to the 1988 proclaimed State of Palestine.
*Since the 1996 Summer Olympics, the International Olympic Committee have recognized a separate Palestine Olympic Committee and Palestinian team. Two track &amp; field athletes, Majdi Abu Marahil and Ihab Salama, competed for the inaugural Palestinian team.
*Since 1998, football&#x27;s world governing body FIFA have recognized the Palestine national football team as a separate entity. On 26 October 2008 Palestine played their first match at home, a 1–1 draw against Jordan in the West Bank.
*In December 2010-January 2011 Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Bolivia and Paraguay recognized a Palestinian state.
*On January 18, 2011, Russia reiterated (first time 1988) its support and recognition of the state of Palestine.
*In January 2011, Ireland upgraded the Palestinian delegation in Dublin to the status of a mission.
*In July 2011, the Sheikh Jarrah Solidarity Movement organized a protest march in East Jerusalem, with approximately 3,000 people participating, carrying Palestinian flags and repeating slogans in favor of a unilateral declaration of independence by the Palestinian Authority.

<text>Jerzy (Georg) Daniel Schultz known also as Daniel Schultz the Younger ( – 1683) was a prominent painter of the Baroque era, born and active in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. He painted many Polish and Lithuanian nobles, members of the royal family, local Patricians, such as the astronomer Johannes Hevelius; animals, and hunts. His work can be found at the Wawel Castle State Art Collections, the National Museum in Warsaw, the Stockholm National Museum, the Hermitage Museum, and at the Gdańsk National Museum.

==Life and professional career==
Born somewhere around 1615 in Gdańsk (Danzig), in Pomeranian Voivodeship, Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, Schultz learned the art of painting from his uncle, Daniel Schultz the Elder, another important painter, working in his workshop for about five years. After his uncle&#x27;s death he travelled to France and the Netherlands to continue his studies for about three years.

Schultz became the leading artist at the Warsaw court of the Polish kings in the second half of the 17th century. In 1649 he became a private painter to the Polish king John II Casimir Vasa, and then to successor kings Michael Wiśniowiecki and John III Sobieski. Schultz returned to his hometown around 1660, yet from time to time worked on royal commissions in Warsaw, often in the Wilanów Palace. His great portraits of Polish kings and nobles are among the best examples of Baroque art in Poland. The most notable of his works &quot;Crimean Falconer of King John II Casimir with his Family &quot; (also known as &quot;The Family Portrait&quot;, today in the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg) was painted in 1664. It depicts Crimean Agha Dedesh (or Dedis) with his sons and servants. The eldest son of Agha was entitled &quot;Royal Falconer&quot; in reward for his father&#x27;s support during the Polish war with Russia (1654–1667). This work was painted during Agha&#x27;s visit to Warsaw after successful invasion of the Left-bank Ukraine (1663–1664). Rich color variations of cerise, dark green and orange create an ideal composition with silver-brown tone of the painting. Some of the portraits of John II are also well known - &quot;en pied&quot; propaganda portrait in Polish costume, when he was leading the Berestechko expedition and so-called &quot;Bielany portrait&quot; in armour with black glow of burning Kraków in background.

His greatest activity occurred during the reign of John II. At that time Schultz painted many portraits and religious paintings. For the abdicating king he painted Saint Casimir, which was later displayed in the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés in Paris (missing). After the king&#x27;s death, he painted his coffin portrait (now at the Royal Castle in Warsaw), that was later placed in the Marble Room at the Royal Castle among preserved 22 effigies of the Polish monarchs by Peter Danckerts de Rij. The inspirations of Rembrandt and Philippe de Champaigne are visible in his works. During his career at the court he probably had contact with some of Rembrandt&#x27;s works, as king John II was a passionate collector of Dutch paintings and by his agent in Amsterdam, Gerrit van Uylenburgh, he purchased many of his works (&quot;The bath of Diana&quot;, &quot;Actaeon&quot; among others).

Schultz lived in Gdańsk at the same time as the engraver Jeremias Falck (–1664), who often engraved portraits after Schultz&#x27;s paintings.

<doc id="48294" wikidata="Q838296" url="?curid=48294" title="International auxiliary language">
<text>An international auxiliary language (sometimes acronymized as IAL or contracted as auxlang) is a language meant for communication between people from different nations, who do not share a common first language. An auxiliary language is primarily a foreign language and often a constructed language. The concept is related to but separate from the idea of a &quot;lingua franca&quot; (or dominant language) that people must use to communicate. The study of international auxiliary languages is interlinguistics.

The term &quot;auxiliary&quot; implies that it is intended to be an additional language for communication between the people of the world, rather than to replace their native languages. Often, the term is used specifically to refer to planned or constructed languages proposed to ease international communication, such as Esperanto, Ido and Interlingua. It usually takes words from widely spoken languages. However, it can also refer to the concept of such a language being determined by international consensus, including even a standardized natural language (e.g., International English), and has also been connected to the project of constructing a universal language.

Languages of dominant societies over the centuries have served as lingua francas that have sometimes approached the international level. Latin, Greek, Sanskrit, Persian, Tamil, and the Mediterranean Lingua Franca were used in the past. In recent times, Standard Arabic, Standard Chinese, English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish have been used as such in many parts of the world. However, as lingua francas are traditionally associated with the very dominance—cultural, political, and economic—that made them popular, they are often also met with resistance. For this and other reasons, some have turned to the idea of promoting a constructed language as a possible solution, by way of an &quot;auxiliary&quot; language, one example of which being Esperanto.

== History ==

The use of an intermediary auxiliary language (also called a &quot;working language&quot;, &quot;bridge language&quot;, &quot;vehicular language&quot;, or &quot;unifying language&quot;) to make communication possible between people not sharing a first language, in particular when it is a third language, distinct from both mother tongues, may be almost as old as language itself. Certainly they have existed since antiquity. Latin and Greek (or Koine Greek) were the intermediary language of all areas of the Mediterranean; Akkadian, and then Aramaic, remained the common languages of a large part of Western Asia through several earlier empires. Such natural languages used for communication between people not sharing the same mother tongue are called &quot;lingua francas&quot;.

=== &quot;Lingua francas&quot; (natural international languages) ===
Lingua francas have arisen around the globe throughout human history, sometimes for commercial reasons (so-called &quot;trade languages&quot;) but also for diplomatic and administrative convenience, and as a means of exchanging information between scientists and other scholars of different nationalities. The term originates with one such language, Mediterranean Lingua Franca, a pidgin language used as a trade language in the Mediterranean area from the 11th to the 19th century. Examples of lingua francas remain numerous, and exist on every continent. The most obvious example as of the early 21st century is English. Moreover, a special case of English is that of Basic English, a simplified version of English which shares the same grammar (though simplified) and a reduced vocabulary of only 1,000 words, with the intention that anyone with a basic knowledge of English should be able to understand even quite complex texts.

===Constructed languages===
Since all natural languages display a number of irregularities in grammar that make them more difficult to learn, and they are also associated with the national and cultural dominance of the nation that speaks it as its mother tongue, attention began to focus on the idea of creating an artificial or constructed language as a possible solution. The concept of simplifying an existing language to make it an auxiliary language was already in the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; of the 18th century, where Joachim Faiguet de Villeneuve, in the article on &quot;Langue&quot;, wrote a short proposition of a &quot;laconic&quot; or regularized grammar of French.

Some of the philosophical languages of the 17th–18th centuries could be regarded as proto-auxlangs, as they were intended by their creators to serve as bridges among people of different languages as well as to disambiguate and clarify thought. However, most or all of these languages were, as far as can be told from the surviving publications about them, too incomplete and unfinished to serve as auxlangs (or for any other practical purpose). The first fully developed constructed languages we know of, as well as the first constructed languages devised primarily as auxlangs, originated in the 19th century; Solresol by François Sudre, a language based on musical notes, was the first to gain widespread attention although not, apparently, fluent speakers.

====Volapük====

During the 19th century, a bewildering variety of such constructed international auxiliary languages (IALs) were proposed, so Louis Couturat and Léopold Leau in &quot;Histoire de la langue universelle&quot; (1903) reviewed 38 projects.

Volapük, first described in an article in 1879 by Johann Martin Schleyer and in book form the following year, was the first to garner a widespread international speaker community. Three major Volapük conventions were held, in 1884, 1887, and 1889; the last of them used Volapük as its working language. André Cherpillod writes of the third Volapük convention,
However, not long after, the Volapük speaker community broke up due to various factors including controversies between Schleyer and other prominent Volapük speakers, and the appearance of newer, easier-to-learn constructed languages, primarily Esperanto.

Answering the needs of the first successful artificial language community, the Volapükists established the regulatory body of their language, under the name International Volapük Academy (&quot;Kadem bevünetik volapüka&quot;) at the second Volapük congress in Munich in August 1887. The Academy was set up to conserve and perfect the auxiliary language Volapük, but soon conflicts arose between conservative Volapükists and those who wanted to reform Volapük to make it a more naturalistic language based on the grammar and vocabulary of major world languages. In 1890 Schleyer himself left the original Academy and created a new Volapük Academy with the same name, from people completely loyal to him, which continues to this day.

Under Waldemar Rosenberger, who became the director in 1892, the original Academy began to make considerable changes in the grammar and vocabulary of Volapük. The vocabulary and the grammatical forms unfamiliar to Western Europeans were completely discarded, so that the changes effectively resulted in the creation of a new language, which was named &quot;Idiom Neutral&quot;. The name of the Academy was changed to &quot;Akademi Internasional de Lingu Universal&quot; in 1898 and the circulars of the Academy were written in the new language from that year.

In 1903, the mathematician Giuseppe Peano published his completely new approach to language construction. Inspired by the idea of philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, instead of inventing schematic structures and an &quot;a priori&quot; language, he chose to simplify an existing and once widely used international language, Latin. This simplified Latin, devoid of inflections and declensions, was named &quot;Interlingua&quot; by Peano but is usually referred to as &quot;Latino sine flexione&quot;.

Impressed by Peano&#x27;s Interlingua, the &quot;Akademi Internasional de Lingu Universal&quot; effectively chose to abandon Idiom Neutral in favor of Peano&#x27;s Interlingua in 1908, and it elected Peano as its director. The name of the group was subsequently changed to &quot;Academia pro Interlingua&quot; (where &quot;Interlingua&quot; stands for Peano&#x27;s language). The &quot;Academia pro Interlingua&quot; survived until about 1939. It was Peano&#x27;s Interlingua that partly inspired the better-known Interlingua presented in 1951 by the International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA).

====Esperanto====
After the emergence of Volapük, a wide variety of other auxiliary languages were devised and proposed in the 1880s–1900s, but none except Esperanto gathered a significant speaker community. Esperanto was developed from about 1873–1887 (a first version was ready in 1878), and finally published in 1887, by L. L. Zamenhof, as a primarily schematic language; the word-stems are borrowed from Romance, West Germanic and Slavic languages. The key to the relative success of Esperanto was probably the highly productive and elastic system of derivational word formation which allowed speakers to derive hundreds of other words by learning one word root. Moreover, Esperanto is quicker to learn than other languages, usually in a third up to a fifth of the time. From early on, Esperantists created their own culture which helped to form the Esperanto language community.

Within a few years this language had thousands of fluent speakers, primarily in eastern Europe. In 1905 its first world convention was held in Boulogne-sur-Mer. Since then world congresses have been held in different countries every year, except during the two World Wars. Esperanto has become &quot;the most outlandishly successful invented language ever&quot; and the most widely spoken constructed international auxiliary language. Esperanto is probably among the fifty languages which are most used internationally.

In 1922 a proposal by Iran and several other countries in the League of Nations to have Esperanto taught in member nations&#x27; schools failed. Esperanto speakers were subject to persecution under Stalin&#x27;s regime. In Germany under Hitler, in Spain under Franco for about a decade, in Portugal under Salazar, in Romania under Ceaușescu, and in half a dozen Eastern European countries during the late forties and part of the fifties, Esperanto activities and the formation of Esperanto associations were forbidden. In spite of these factors more people continued to learn Esperanto, and significant literary work (both poetry and novels) appeared in Esperanto in the period between the World Wars and after them. Esperanto is spoken today in a growing number of countries and it has multiple generations of native speakers, although it is primarily used as a second language. Of the various constructed language projects, it is Esperanto that has so far come closest to becoming an officially recognized international auxiliary language; China publishes daily news in Esperanto.

====Ido and the Esperantidos====

The Delegation for the Adoption of an International Auxiliary Language was founded in 1900 by Louis Couturat and others; it tried to get the International Association of Academies to take up the question of an international auxiliary language, study the existing ones and pick one or design a new one. However, when the meta-academy declined to do so, the Delegation decided to do the job itself. Among Esperanto speakers there was a general impression that the Delegation would of course choose Esperanto, as it was the only auxlang with a sizable speaker community at the time; it was felt as a betrayal by many Esperanto speakers when in 1907 the Delegation came up with its own reformed version of Esperanto, Ido. Ido drew a significant number of speakers away from Esperanto in the short term, but in the longer term most of these either returned to Esperanto or moved on to other new auxlangs. Besides Ido, a great number of simplified Esperantos, called Esperantidos, emerged as concurrent language projects; still, Ido remains today one of the more widely spoken auxlangs.

====Interlingue (Occidental)====

Edgar de Wahl&#x27;s Occidental of 1922 was in reaction against the perceived artificiality of some earlier auxlangs, particularly Esperanto. Inspired by Idiom Neutral and Latino sine flexione, de Wahl created a language whose words, including compound words, would have a high degree of recognizability for those who already know a Romance language. However, this design criterion was in conflict with the ease of coining new compound or derived words on the fly while speaking. Occidental was most active from the 1920s to the 1950s, and supported some 80 publications by the 1930s, but had almost entirely died out by the 1980s. Its name was officially changed to Interlingue in 1949. More recently Interlingue has been revived on the Internet.

====Novial====

In 1928 Ido&#x27;s major intellectual supporter, the Danish linguist Otto Jespersen, abandoned Ido, and published his own planned language, Novial. It was mostly inspired by Idiom Neutral and Occidental, yet it attempted a derivational formalism and schematism sought by Esperanto and Ido. The notability of its creator helped the growth of this auxiliary language, but a reform of the language was proposed by Jespersen in 1934 and not long after this Europe entered World War II, and its creator died in 1943 before Europe was at peace again.

====Interlingua====

The International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA) was founded in 1924 by Alice Vanderbilt Morris; like the earlier &quot;Delegation for the Adoption of an International Auxiliary Language&quot;, its mission was to study language problems and the existing auxlangs and proposals for auxlangs, and to negotiate some consensus between the supporters of various auxlangs. However, like the Delegation, it finally decided to create its own auxlang. Interlingua, published in 1951, was primarily the work of Alexander Gode, though he built on preliminary work by earlier IALA linguists including André Martinet, and relied on elements from previous naturalistic auxlang projects, like Peano&#x27;s Interlingua (Latino sine flexione), Jespersen&#x27;s Novial, de Wahl&#x27;s Interlingue, and the Academy&#x27;s Idiom Neutral. Like Interlingue, Interlingua was designed to have words recognizable at sight by those who already know a Romance language or a language like English with much vocabulary borrowed from Romance languages; to attain this end the IALA accepted a degree of grammatical and orthographic complexity considerably greater than in Esperanto or Interlingue, though still less than in any natural language.

The theory underlying Interlingua posits an &quot;international vocabulary&quot;, a large number of words and affixes that are present in a wide range of languages. This already existing international vocabulary was shaped by social forces, science and technology, to &quot;all corners of the world&quot;. The goal of the International Auxiliary Language Association was to accept into Interlingua every widely international word in whatever languages it occurred. They conducted studies to identify &quot;the most generally international vocabulary possible&quot;, while still maintaining the unity of the language. This scientific approach of generating a language from selected source languages (called &quot;control languages&quot;) resulted in a vocabulary and grammar that can be called the highest common factor of each major European language.

Interlingua gained a significant speaker community, perhaps roughly the same size as that of Ido (considerably less than the size of Esperanto). Interlingua&#x27;s success can be explained by the fact that it is the most widely &quot;understood&quot; international auxiliary language by virtue of its naturalistic (as opposed to schematic) grammar and vocabulary, allowing those familiar with a Romance language, and educated speakers of English, to read and understand it without prior study. Interlingua has some active speakers currently on all continents, and the language is propagated by the Union Mundial pro Interlingua (UMI), and Interlingua is presented on CDs, radio, and television.

After the creation of Interlingua, the enthusiasm for constructed languages gradually decreased in the years between 1960 and 1990.

===Internet age===
All of the auxlangs with a surviving speaker community seem to have benefited from the advent of the Internet, Esperanto more than most. The CONLANG mailing list was founded in 1991; in its early years discussion focused on international auxiliary languages. As people interested in artistic languages and engineered languages grew to be the majority of the list members, and flame-wars between proponents of particular auxlangs irritated these members, a separate AUXLANG mailing list was created in 1997, which has been the primary venue for discussion of auxlangs since then. Besides giving the existing auxlangs with speaker communities a chance to interact rapidly online as well as slowly through postal mail or more rarely in personal meetings, the Internet has also made it easier to publicize new auxlang projects, and a handful of these have gained a small speaker community, including Kotava (published in 1978), Lingua Franca Nova (1998), Slovio (1999), Interslavic (2006), Pandunia (2007), Sambahsa (2007), Lingwa de Planeta (2010), and Globasa (2019).

===Zonal auxiliary languages===
Not every international auxiliary language is necessarily intended to be used on a global scale. A special subgroup are languages created to facilitate communication between speakers of related languages. The oldest known example is a Pan-Slavic language written in 1665 by the Croatian priest Juraj Križanić. He named this language Ruski jezik (&quot;Russian language&quot;), although in reality it was a mixture of the Russian edition of Church Slavonic, his own Southern Chakavian dialect of Serbo-Croatian, and, to a lesser degree, Polish.

Most zonal auxiliary languages were created during the period of romantic nationalism at the end of the 19th century; some were created later. Particularly numerous are the Pan-Slavic language projects. However, similar efforts at creating umbrella languages have been made for other language families as well: Tutonish (1902), Folkspraak (1995) and other pan-Germanic languages for the Germanic languages; Romanid (1956) and several other pan-Romance languages for the Romance languages; and Afrihili (1973) for the African continent.

Notable among modern examples is Interslavic, a project first published in 2006 as Slovianski and then established in its current form in 2011 after the merger of several other projects. In 2012 it was reported to have several hundred users.

== Scholarly study ==

In the early 1900s auxlangs were already becoming a subject of academic study. Louis Couturat et al. described the controversy in the preface to their book &quot;International Language and Science&quot;:

:The question of a so-called world-language, or better expressed, an international auxiliary language, was during the now past Volapük period, and is still in the present Esperanto movement, so much in the hands of Utopians, fanatics and enthusiasts, that it is difficult to form an unbiased opinion concerning it, although a good idea lies at its basis. (1910, p. v).

Leopold Pfaundler wrote that an IAL was needed for more effective communication among scientists:

:All who are occupied with the reading or writing of scientific literature have assuredly very often felt the want of a common scientific language, and regretted the great loss of time and trouble caused by the multiplicity of languages employed in scientific literature.

For Couturat et al., Volapükists and Esperantists confounded the linguistic aspect of the question with many side issues, and they considered this a main reason why discussion about the idea of an international auxiliary language has appeared unpractical.

Some contemporaries of Couturat, notably Edward Sapir, saw the challenge of an auxiliary language not as much as that of identifying a descriptive linguistic answer (of grammar and vocabulary) to global communicative concerns, but rather as one of promoting the notion of a linguistic platform for lasting international understanding. Though interest among scholars, and linguists in particular, waned greatly throughout the 20th century, such differences of approach persist today. Some scholars and interested laymen make concrete language proposals. By contrast, Mario Pei and others place the broader societal issue first. Yet others argue in favor of a particular language while seeking to establish its social integration.
==Writing systems==

Whilst most IALs use the Latin script, some of them, also offer an alternative in the Cyrillic script.

===Latin script===
The vast majority of IALs use the Latin script. Several sounds, e.g. /n/, /m/, /t/, /f/ are written with the same letter as in IPA.

Some consonant sounds found in several Latin-script IAL alphabets are not represented by an ISO 646 letter in IPA. Three have a single letter in IPA, one has a widespread alternative taken from ISO 646:
* /ʃ/ (U+0283, IPA 134)
* /ʒ/ (U+0292, IPA 135)
* /ɡ/ (U+0261, IPA 110, single storey g) = g (U+0067, double storey g)
Four are affricates, each represented in IPA by two letters and a combining marker. They are often written decomposed:
* /t͡s/ = /ts/
* /t͡ʃ/ = /tʃ/; Note: Polish distinguishes between them
* /d͡z/ = /dz/
* /d͡ʒ/ = /dʒ/

That means that two sounds that are one character in IPA and are not ISO 646, also have no common alternative in ISO 646: ʃ, ʒ.

==Classification==

The following classification of auxiliary languages was developed by Pierre Janton in 1993:

* &quot;A priori&quot; languages are characterized by largely artificial morphemes (not borrowed from natural languages), schematic derivation, simple phonology, grammar, and morphology. Some &quot;a priori&quot; languages are called philosophical languages, referring to their basis in philosophical ideas about thought and language. These include some of the earliest efforts at auxiliary language in the 17th century. Some more specific subcategories:
** Taxonomic languages form their words using a taxonomic hierarchy, with each phoneme of a word helping specify its position in a semantic hierarchy of some kind; for example, Solresol.
** Pasigraphies are purely written languages without a spoken form, or with a spoken form left at the discretion of the reader; many of the 17th–18th century philosophical languages and auxlangs were pasigraphies. This set historically tends to overlap with taxonomic languages, though there is no inherent reason a pasigraphy needs to be taxonomic.
* &quot;A posteriori&quot; languages are based on existing natural languages. Nearly all the auxiliary languages with fluent speakers are in this category. Most of the &quot;a posteriori&quot; auxiliary languages borrow their vocabulary primarily or solely from European languages, and base their grammar more or less on European models. (Sometimes these European-based languages are referred to as &quot;euroclones&quot;, although this term has negative connotations and is not used in the academic literature.) Interlingua was drawn originally from international scientific vocabulary, in turn based primarily on Greek and Latin roots. Glosa did likewise, with a stronger dependence of Greek roots. Although &quot;a posteriori&quot; languages have been based on most of the families of European languages, the most successful of these (notably Esperanto, Ido, and Interlingua) have been based largely on Romance elements.
** Schematic (or &quot;mixed&quot;) languages have some &quot;a priori&quot; qualities. Some have ethnic morphemes but alter them significantly to fit a simplified phonotactic pattern (e.g., Volapük) or both artificial and natural morphemes (e.g., Perio). Partly schematic languages have partly schematic and partly naturalistic derivation (e.g. Esperanto and Ido). Natural morphemes of languages in this group are rarely altered greatly from their source-language form, but compound and derived words are generally not recognizable at sight by people familiar with the source languages.
** Naturalistic languages resemble existing natural languages. For example, Interlingue, Interlingua, and Lingua Franca Nova were developed so that not only the root words but their compounds and derivations will often be immediately recognized by large numbers of people. Some naturalistic languages do have a limited number of artificial morphemes or invented grammatical devices (e.g. Novial).
** Simplified, or controlled versions of natural languages reduce the full extent of the vocabulary and partially regularize the grammar of a natural language (e.g. Basic English and Special English).

===Comparison of sample texts===

Some examples of the best known international auxiliary languages are shown below for comparative purposes, using the Lord&#x27;s Prayer (a core Christian prayer, the translated text of which is regularly used for linguistic comparisons).

As a reference for comparison, one can find the Latin, English, French, and Spanish versions here:

==Methods of propagation==

As has been pointed out, the issue of an international language is not so much which, but how. Several approaches exist toward the eventual full expansion and consolidation of an international auxiliary language.
# Laissez-faire. This approach is taken in the belief that one language will eventually and inevitably &quot;win out&quot; as a world auxiliary language (e.g. International English) without any need for specific action.
# Institutional sponsorship and grass-roots promotion of language programs. This approach has taken various forms, depending on the language and language type, ranging from government promotion of a particular language to one-on-one encouragement to learn the language to instructional or marketing programs.
# National legislation. This approach seeks to have individual countries (or even localities) progressively endorse a given language as an official language (or to promote the concept of international legislation).
# International legislation. This approach involves promotion of the future holding of a binding international convention (perhaps to be under the auspices of such international organizations as the United Nations or Inter-Parliamentary Union) to formally agree upon an official international auxiliary language which would then be taught in all schools around the world, beginning at the primary level. This approach, an official principle of the Baháʼí Faith, seeks to put a combination of international opinion, linguistic expertise, and law behind a to-be-selected language and thus expand or consolidate it as a full official world language, to be used in addition to local languages. This approach could either give more credibility to a natural language already serving this purpose to a certain degree (e.g. if English were chosen) or to give a greatly enhanced chance for a constructed language to take root. For constructed languages particularly, this approach has been seen by various individuals in the IAL movement as holding the most promise of ensuring that promotion of studies in the language would not be met with skepticism at its practicality by its would-be learners.

==Pictorial languages==

In the Sinosphere, Literary Chinese was a written lingua franca for bureaucracy and communications. Literary Chinese writing facilitated communication between speakers of Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, and different Chinese dialects.

There have been a number of proposals for using pictures, ideograms, diagrams, and other pictorial representations for international communications. Examples range from the original Characteristica Universalis proposed by the philosopher Leibniz in the 17th century, to suggestions for the adoption of Chinese writing, to recent inventions such as Blissymbol, first published in 1949.

Within the scientific community, there is already considerable agreement in the form of the schematics used to represent electronic circuits, chemical symbols, mathematical symbols, and the Energy Systems Language of systems ecology. We can also see the international efforts at regularizing symbols used to regulate traffic, to indicate resources for tourists, and in maps. Some symbols have become nearly universal through their consistent use in computers and on the Internet.

==Sign languages==

An international auxiliary sign language has been developed by deaf people who meet regularly at international forums such as sporting events or in political organisations. Previously referred to as Gestuno but now more commonly known simply as &#x27;international sign&#x27;, the language has continued to develop since the first signs were standardised in 1973, and it is now in widespread use. International sign is distinct in many ways from spoken IALs; many signs are iconic, and signers tend to insert these signs into the grammar of their own sign language, with an emphasis on visually intuitive gestures and mime. A simple sign language called Plains Indian Sign Language was used by indigenous peoples of the Americas.

Gestuno is not to be confused with the separate and unrelated sign language Signuno, which is essentially a Signed Exact Esperanto. Signuno is not in any significant use, and is based on the Esperanto community rather than based on the international Deaf community.

==Criticism==
There has been considerable criticism of international auxiliary languages, both in terms of individual proposals, types of proposals, and in more general terms.

Much criticism has been focused either on the artificiality of international auxiliary languages, or on the argumentativeness of proponents and their failure to agree on one language, or even on objective criteria by which to judge them. However, probably the most common criticism is that a constructed auxlang is unnecessary because natural languages such as English are already in wide use as auxlangs.

One criticism already prevalent in the late 19th century, and still sometimes heard today, is that an international language might hasten the extinction of minority languages.

Although referred to as &quot;international&quot; languages, most of these languages have historically been constructed on the basis of Western European languages. Esperanto and other languages such as Interlingua and Ido have been criticized for being too European and not global enough. The term &quot;Euroclone&quot; was coined to refer to such languages in contrast to &quot;worldlangs&quot; with global vocabulary sources.

<doc id="48295" wikidata="Q54041" url="?curid=48295" title="Michał Korybut Wiśniowiecki">
<text>Michael I (, ; 31 May 1640 – 10 November 1673) was the ruler of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth as King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania from 29 September 1669 until his death in 1673.

Michael was chosen partly because of the merit of his father, prince Jeremi Wiśniowiecki, a powerful border magnate who had helped suppress the rebellious Cossacks during the Khmelnytsky Uprising. After Michael&#x27;s early death, these setbacks were reversed at the Battle of Khotyn in 1673 by his successor, John III Sobieski, who defeated an Austrian candidate in the election.

In 1670 Michael I was married to Eleonora Maria of Austria (1653–1697), daughter of Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor, by his third wife Eleonora Gonzaga.

== Biography ==

Michael was the son of Jeremi Wiśniowiecki and his wife Gryzelda Konstancja Zamoyska. His parents likely met each other in September 1637 in Warsaw during the crowning of Cecilia Renata of Austria, the Queen of Poland and consort to Władysław IV. They were engaged on 13 February 1638, over a month after the death of Gryzelda&#x27;s father, Tomasz Zamoyski.

The wedding took place in Zamość on 27 February 1639, and over a year later, on 31 May 1640, Michael Korybut was most likely born in the village of Biały Kamień as Michał Tomasz Wiśniowiecki. The infant was then taken to Zamość, where he spent first two years of his life under care of his grandmother Katarzyna Zamoyska (née Ostrogska). In 1642, Michał was taken by his mother to Lubny. During the Khmelnytsky Uprising, he fled Left-bank Ukraine with his family and first settled in Wiśniowiec in Volhynia, before arriving in Zamość in autumn 1648.

Jeremi Wiśniowiecki died in 1651, when most of his enormous estate remained under Cossack or Russian control. From 1651 – 1655, young Michał was under the care of Karol Ferdynand Vasa, the bishop of Wrocław and Płock. The boy stayed at the residence of the Bishops of Płock, in the town of Brok. After the death of Bishop Vasa on 9 May 1655, he was taken in by his wealthy uncle, Jan Zamoyski, Voivode of Sandomierz, who funded his education. Sometime in mid-1655, Michał found himself at the court of King John II Casimir.

Following the Swedish invasion of Poland, Michael, together with the royal court, fled to Głogówek in Upper Silesia. On 18 November 1655, following the request of the king, he went to Nysa, to study at the Jesuit College Carolinum and stayed there until March 1656.

In mid-1656, thanks to the support of Queen Marie Louise Gonzaga, Michał Korybut began studying at Charles University in Prague. He returned to Poland in June 1660, but soon afterwards, headed to Dresden and Vienna to meet Empress Eleonora Gonzaga. There he saw his future wife Eleanor of Austria, who was a child at that time, for the first time. On this trip, Michael improved his knowledge of languages; he spoke Latin, German, Italian, French and also likely Tatar and Turkish as well.

In 1663, Michel took part in the Russo-Polish War, and during the Lubomirski Rebellion, he loyally supported the king.

=== Election ===
On 16 September 1668, John II Casimir abdicated the Polish throne and left the country to live in France, making a new election necessary. The Bishop of Chełmno, Andrzej Olszowski, suggested that Michał Korybut should be listed as one of candidates for the throne. Wiśniowiecki was supported by the Polish nobility, who sensed that a poor and inexperienced prince would not pose a threat to their rights enshrined in the &quot;Golden Liberty&quot;.

The Free election of 1669 took place in May and June of that year. Michał Korybut Wiśniowiecki was elected King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania on 19 June and became known as Michael I. Most of the gathered nobility voted for him as they wished to choose a native, Polish candidate (the so-called &quot;Piast&quot;), over foreign candidates. Wiśniowiecki won 11,271 votes and was crowned on 29 September 1669 in Kraków.

His election was immediately opposed by the pro-French camp, led by Primate of Poland Mikołaj Prazmowski and Crown Hetman John Sobieski.

On 27 February 1670 Michael I married Austrian princess Eleanor, and the ceremony was celebrated by Papal Nuncio, Cardinal Galeazzo Marescotti, as Primate Prazmowski refused to attend. The reception took place at the Denhoff Palace in Kruszyna.

=== Internal conflicts ===

Following the 1669 election, the Commonwealth was divided between two camps – pro-French, and royal. The pro-French camp had several influential members, including Primate Prazmowski, Hetman Sobieski, Andrzej Morsztyn, Voivode of Kraków Aleksander Michał Lubomirski, Voivode of Ruthenia Stanisław Jan Jabłonowski, Voivode of Poznań Krzysztof Grzymultowski, and Bishop of Kraków Andrzej Trzebicki.

In November 1669, the French camp broke the Coronation Sejm, hoping to dethrone Michael and elect Count Charles-Paris d&#x27;Orléans-Longueville. In 1670, the internal struggle moved to the local sejmiks, during which the nobility demanded to bring a Sejm lawsuit against Hetman Sobieski. To defend their commander, Sobieski&#x27;s soldiers formed a Confederation near Trembowla.

To make matters worse, the divided Commonwealth was under constant Turkish threat. In 1671, the king supported a rebellion of a unit of Stanisław Wyżycki, who, against the explicit order of Sobieski, abandoned Volhynia, leaving the province defenceless. King Michael ordered Wyżycki and his men to spend the winter of 1671/72 in the wealthy &quot;starostwo&quot; of Sambor, and paid them their salaries, while Sobieski and his soldiers did not receive any money.
In 1672, the Ottoman Empire declared war on the Commonwealth, and the Polish–Ottoman War of 1672–76 began. Despite this, the situation in the Polish Crown was still chaotic, with the danger of a civil war. The nobility formed a confederation near Gołąb, demanding the removal of Primate Prazmowski. Its members looted real estate owned by Hetman Sobieski and his family. On 22 November 1672 Lithuanian soldiers formed their own confederation in Kobryń, declaring their support for the Gołąb confederation. In response, soldiers under Sobieski formed a confederation in Szczebrzeszyn. John Sobieski, together with his troops, headed to Łowicz, to meet Primate Prazmowski.

Negotiations between the two factions were carried out by Papal Nuncio Francesco Buonvisi and Bishop of Kraków Andrzej Trzebicki. Furthermore, Sultan Mehmed IV of the Ottoman Empire sent an offensive letter to Warsaw, demanding complete subordination of the Commonwealth. This greatly enraged the Poles but due to chaotic internal situation of the Commonwealth, both sides of the conflict reached an agreement in March 1672.

=== War with the Ottoman Empire ===
In June 1672, a 100,000-strong Ottoman army, under Mehmed IV, besieged the city of Kamieniec Podolski, which capitulated after 26 days. The invaders then approached Lwów, which paid a ransom. Mounted Crimean Tatar units penetrated as far as Hrubieszów, Jasło and Biecz.

In October 1672, Hetman John Sobieski, upon request of the senators, tried to stop the invaders, defeating them in the Battle of Niemirów, Battle of Komarno, and Battle of Petranka. Meanwhile, the Treaty of Buchach was signed on 18 October, in which the king ceded Podolia to the Ottomans and agreed to pay a yearly tribute. Under these terms, the once mighty Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was humbled by the Turks.

Soon afterwards, Michael I began preparation for a new military campaign against the Ottomans. On 8 October 1673 at Skwarzawa near Złoczów, some 40,000 Polish soldiers concentrated, with 50 cannons. Due to poor health, the king handed the command of the army to Sobieski, and the Poles marched southwards, to Chocim.

=== Death, funeral, and legacy ===

King Michael I Korybut died in the Palace of the Archbishops of Lwów, on 10 November 1673. His early demise seems to have been brought about by a severe case of food poisoning, although rumours persisted that he had been murdered by traitorous generals angered at the declining power of the Commonwealth.

The day after his death, John Sobieski won the Battle of Chocim, which reversed some of the losses under Michael I&#x27;s reign. On 19 May 1674 Hetman John Sobieski was elected the new monarch after the Free election of 1674.

After the funeral, the heart of the king was buried at a Camedule Monastery in the Bielany district of Warsaw. The bowels were placed in a wall of the Latin Cathedral in Lwów, while the body was buried in Wawel Cathedral in Kraków on 31 January 1676, the same day that John Sobieski was crowned as John III.

Michael&#x27;s reign was considered to be less than successful as his ability to be a capable monarch were greatly hurt by Poland&#x27;s quarrelling factions. His father&#x27;s military fame notwithstanding, Michael lost the first phase of the Polish–Ottoman War of 1672–1676.

<text>Marburg (; ) is a university town in the German federal state () of Hesse, capital of the Marburg-Biedenkopf district (). The town area spreads along the valley of the river Lahn and has a population of approximately 76,000.

Having been awarded town privileges in 1222, Marburg served as capital of the landgraviate of Hessen-Marburg during periods of the 15th to 17th centuries. The University of Marburg was founded in 1527 and dominates the public life in the town to this day.

Marburg is a historic centre of the pharmaceutical industry in Germany, and there is a plant in the town (by BioNTech) to produce vaccines to tackle Covid-19.

== History ==
=== Founding and early history ===
Like many settlements, Marburg developed at the crossroads of two important early medieval highways: the trade route linking Cologne and Prague and the trade route from the North Sea to the Alps and on to Italy, the former crossing the river Lahn here. A first mention of the settlement dates from 822 in the &quot;Reinhardsbrunner Chronik&quot;. The settlement was protected and customs were raised by a small castle built during the ninth or tenth century by the Giso. Marburg has been a town since 1140, as proven by coins. From the Gisos, it fell around that time to the Landgraves of Thuringia, residing on the Wartburg above Eisenach.

=== St. Elizabeth of Hungary ===
In 1228, the widowed princess-landgravine of Thuringia, Elizabeth of Hungary, chose Marburg as her dowager seat, as she did not get along well with her brother-in-law, the new landgrave. The countess dedicated her life to the sick and would become after her early death in 1231, aged 24, one of the most prominent female saints of the era. She was canonized in 1235.

=== Capital of Hessen ===
In 1264, St Elizabeth&#x27;s daughter Sophie of Brabant, succeeded in winning the Landgraviate of Hessen, hitherto connected to Thuringia, for her son Henry. Marburg (alongside Kassel) was one of the capitals of Hessen from that time until about 1540. Following the first division of the landgraviate, it was the capital of Hessen-Marburg from 1485 to 1500 and again between 1567 and 1605. Hessen was one of the more powerful second-tier principalities in Germany. Its &quot;old enemy&quot; was the Archbishopric of Mainz, the seat of one of the prince-electors, who competed with Hessen in many wars and conflicts for coveted territory, stretching over several centuries.
After 1605, Marburg became just another provincial town, known mostly for the University of Marburg. It became a virtual backwater for two centuries after the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–48), when it was fought over by Hessen-Darmstadt and Hesse-Kassel. The Hessian territory around Marburg lost more than two-thirds of its population, which was more than in any later wars (including World War I and World War II) combined.

=== Reformation ===
Marburg is the seat of the oldest existing Protestant-founded university in the world, the University of Marburg (Philipps-Universität-Marburg), founded in 1527. It is one of the smaller &quot;university towns&quot; in Germany. These include Greifswald, Erlangen, Jena, and Tübingen, as well as the city of Gießen, which is located 30 km south of Marburg.

In 1529, Philipp I of Hesse arranged the Marburg Colloquy, to propitiate Martin Luther and Huldrych Zwingli.

=== Romanticism ===
Owing to its neglect during the entire 18th century, Marburg – like Rye or Chartres – survived as a relatively intact Gothic town, simply because there was no money spent on any new architecture or expansion. When Romanticism became the dominant cultural and artistic paradigm in Germany, Marburg became a centre of activities once again, and many of the leaders of the movement lived, taught, or studied in Marburg. They formed a circle of friends that was of great importance, especially in literature, philology, folklore, and law.

The group included Friedrich Carl von Savigny, the most important jurist of his day and father of the Roman Law adaptation in Germany, as well as the poets, writers, and social activists Achim von Arnim, Clemens Brentano, and especially Bettina von Arnim, Clemens Brentano&#x27;s sister, who became Achim von Arnim&#x27;s wife. Most famous internationally, however, were the Brothers Grimm, who collected many of their fairy tales here. The best-known illustrations for the fairy tale editions are by the painter Otto Ubbelohde, who also lived in and near Marburg. The original building inspiring his drawing &quot;Rapunzel&#x27;s Tower&quot; stands in Amönau near Marburg. Across the Lahn hills, in the area called Schwalm, the costumes of little girls included a red hood.

=== Prussian town ===
In the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, the Prince-elector of Hessen had backed Austria. Prussia won and took the opportunity to invade and annex the Electorate of Hessen (as well as Hanover, the city of Frankfurt, and other territories) north of the Main River. However, the pro-Austrian Hesse-Darmstadt remained independent. For Marburg, this turn of events was very positive, because Prussia decided to make Marburg its main administrative centre in this part of the new province Hessen-Nassau and to turn the University of Marburg into the regional academic centre. Thus, Marburg&#x27;s rise as an administrative and university city began. As the Prussian university system was one of the best in the world at the time, Marburg attracted many respected scholars. However, there was hardly any industry to speak of, so students, professors, and civil servants – who generally had enough but not much money and paid very little in taxes – dominated the town.

=== Early 20th century ===

Franz von Papen, vice-chancellor of Germany in 1934, delivered an anti-Nazi speech at the University of Marburg on 17 June.

From 1942 to 1945, the whole city of Marburg was turned into a hospital, with schools and government buildings turned into wards to augment the existing hospitals. By the spring of 1945, there were over 20,000 patients – mostly wounded German soldiers. As a result of its designation as a hospital city, and because of a lack of important industrial sites, there was not much damage from bombings except along the railroad tracks.

In May 1945, the Monuments men officer Walker Hancock set up the first so-called Central Collecting Point in the Marburg State Archives. But since the capacity of the archive building was not sufficient to store the many objects and since other collecting points, for example in Munich, had been set up in the American occupation zone in the meantime, the Marburg facility was closed after more than a year in favor of the Wiesbaden Collecting Point. With the relocation of the sarcophagus of Field Marshal and President Paul von Hindenburg (1847-1934) to the Elisabethkirche in August 1946 the project ended. Milton Mayer&#x27;s 1955 book &quot;They Thought They Were Free&quot;, which attempted to gage how ordinary German citizens felt about Nazi Germany, used interviews of ten men from Marburg (which it called &quot;Kronenberg&quot;) as its case study.

=== Marburg from 1945 ===
Post-war developments included population growth at first due to war refugees, then to increasing significance of the pharmaceutical industry based in Marburg, and an increase in staff and students for the university. The historic town was in danger of thorough decay, but was renovated from 1972. The university now has about 21,000 students (2023).

==Geography==
Marburg lies on the river Lahn, 25 km north of Gießen. The federal road Bundesstraße 3 connects it with Gießen and Kassel. It is served by Marburg (Lahn) station (long-distance and local trains) and Marburg Süd station (local trains).

The city is divided into the following 25 boroughs (&quot;Ortsbezirke&quot;):

* Altstadt
* Bauerbach
* Bortshausen
* Campusviertel
* Cappel
* Cyriaxweimar
* Dagobertshausen
* Dilschhausen
* Elnhausen
* Ginseldorf
* Gisselberg
* Haddamshausen
* Hermershausen
* Marbach
* Michelbach
* Moischt
* Ockershausen
* Richtsberg
* Ronhausen
* Schröck
* Südviertel
* Waldtal
* Wehrda
* Wehrshausen
* Weidenhausen
== Politics ==
As a larger mid-sized city, Marburg, like six other such cities in Hessen, has a special status as compared to the other municipalities in the district. This means that the city takes on tasks more usually performed by the district so that in many ways it is comparable to an urban district (&quot;kreisfreie Stadt&quot;). Before 1974, the city was a district-free city.

The mayor of Marburg, Thomas Spies, in office since December 2015, and his predecessor Egon Vaupel (directly elected in January 2005), are members of the Social Democratic Party of Germany. His deputy, the head of the building and youth departments, Nadine Bernshausen, is from Alliance &#x27;90/The Greens. Following the city parliament elections of March 2021, the majority in the 59-seat city parliament is held by a coalition of Green party (15 seats), SPD (14 seats) and Klimaliste (4 seats) members. Also represented are the factions of the Christian Democratic Union (13 seats), The Left (7 seats), the Free Democratic Party (2 seats), a CDU splinter group MBL (&quot;Marburger Bürgerliste&quot; – 2 seats), the BfM (&quot;Bürger für Marburg&quot; – 2 seats), Alternative für Deutschland (1 seat), and the Pirate Party (1 seat).

Among the left wing groups are ATTAC, the Worldshop movement, an autonomist-anarchist scene, and a few groups engaged in ecological or human-rights concerns.

The city of Marburg, similar to the cities of Heidelberg, Tübingen and Göttingen, has a rich history of student fraternities or &quot;Verbindungen&quot; of various sorts, including Corps, Landsmannschaften, Burschenschaften, Turnierschaften, etc.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Marburg is twinned with:

* Poitiers, France (1961)
* Maribor, Slovenia (1969)
* Sfax, Tunisia (1971)
* Eisenach, Germany (1988)
* Northampton, England, UK (1992)
* Sibiu, Romania (2005)
==Coat of arms==

Marburg&#x27;s coat of arms shows a Hessian landgrave riding a white horse with a flag and a shield on a red background. The shield shows the red-and-white-striped Hessian lion, also to be seen on Hessen&#x27;s state arms, and the flag shows a stylized M, blue on gold (or yellow). The arms are also the source of the city flag&#x27;s colors. The flag has three horizontal stripes colored, from top to bottom, red (from the background), white (from the horse) and blue (from the shield).

The coat of arms, which was designed in the late nineteenth century, is based on a landgrave seal on a municipal document. It is an example of a very prevalent practice of replacing forgotten coats of arms, or ones deemed not to be representative enough, with motifs taken from seals.

== Marburg virus ==

The city&#x27;s name is connected to a filovirus, the Marburg virus, because this disease, a viral hemorrhagic fever resembling ebola, was first recognized and described during an outbreak in the city. In 1967, workers were accidentally exposed to infected green monkey tissue at the city&#x27;s former industrial plant, the Behring-Werke, then part of Hoechst and today of CSL Behring, founded by Marburg citizen and first Nobel Prize in Medicine winner, Emil Adolf von Behring. During the outbreak, 31 people became infected and seven of them died. The virus is named after the city following the custom of naming viruses after the location of their first recorded outbreak.

== Green city ==
Many homes have solar panels and in 2008 a law was passed to make the installation of solar systems on new buildings or as part of renovation projects mandatory. 20 percent of heating system requirements ought to have been covered by solar energy in new buildings. Anyone who fails to install solar panels would have been fined €1,000. The new law, approved on 20 June 2008, should have taken effect in October 2008, however, this law was stopped by the Regierungspräsidium Giessen in September 2008.

==Landmarks==

Marburg remains a relatively unspoilt, spire-dominated, castle-crowned Gothic or Renaissance city on a hill partly because it was isolated between 1600 and 1850. Architecturally, it is famous both for its castle Marburger Schloss and its medieval churches. The Elisabethkirche, as one of the two or three first purely Gothic churches north of the Alps outside France, is an archetype of Gothic architecture in Germany.

Much of the physical attractiveness of Marburg is due to Hanno Drechsler who was Lord Mayor between 1970 and 1992. He promoted urban renewal and the restoration of the Oberstadt (upper town) and established one of the first pedestrian zones in Germany. Marburg&#x27;s &quot;Altstadtsanierung&quot; (since 1972) has received many awards and prizes.

Parks in the town include the Old Botanical Garden, as well as the new Botanical Garden outside the town proper.

The Marktplatz is the heart of Marburg&#x27;s old town. In the center is a fountain dedicated to St George, a popular meeting place for young people. To the south is the old town hall and the path running north leads to the palace overlooking the town.

The University of Marburg, founded in 1527, is one of Germany&#x27;s oldest. It is spread over two campuses: Firmanei in the centre of Marburg and Lahnberge to the east of the town near the Botanischer Garten (Botanical Garden).

<text>John III Sobieski ( (); (); () 17 August 1629 – 17 June 1696) was King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania from 1674 until his death in 1696.

Born into Polish nobility, Sobieski was educated at the Jagiellonian University and toured Europe in his youth. As a soldier and later commander, he fought in the Khmelnytsky Uprising, the Russo-Polish War and during the Swedish invasion known as the Deluge. Sobieski demonstrated his military prowess during the war against the Ottoman Empire and established himself as a leading figure in Poland and Lithuania. In 1674, he was elected monarch of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth following the sudden and unexpected death of King Michael.

Sobieski&#x27;s 22-year reign marked a period of the Commonwealth&#x27;s stabilization, much needed after the turmoil of previous conflicts. Popular among his subjects, he was an able military leader, most famously for his victory over the Ottoman Empire at the Battle of Vienna in 1683. The defeated Ottomans named Sobieski the &quot;Lion of Lechistan&quot;, and the Pope hailed him as the saviour of Western Christendom. Suffering from poor health and obesity in later life, Sobieski died in 1696 and was buried at Wawel Cathedral in Kraków. He was succeeded by Augustus II of Poland and Saxony.

== Biography ==
=== Youth ===
John Sobieski was born on 17 August 1629, in Olesko, now in Ukraine, then part of the Ruthenian Voivodeship in the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth to a renowned noble family de Sobieszyn Sobieski of Janina coat of arms. His father, Jakub Sobieski, was the Voivode of Ruthenia and Castellan of Kraków; his mother, Zofia Teofillia Daniłowicz was a granddaughter of Hetman Stanisław Żółkiewski. John Sobieski spent his childhood in Żółkiew. After graduating from Bartłomiej Nowodworski College in Kraków in 1643, young John Sobieski then graduated from the philosophical faculty of the University of Kraków in 1646. After finishing his studies, John and his brother Marek Sobieski left for western Europe, where he spent more than two years travelling. They visited Leipzig, Antwerp, Paris, London, Leiden, and The Hague. During that time, he met influential contemporary figures such as Louis II de Bourbon, Charles II of England and William II, Prince of Orange, and learned French, German, and Italian, in addition to Latin.

Both brothers returned to the Commonwealth in 1648. Upon receiving the news of the death of king Władysław IV Vasa and the hostilities of the Khmelnytsky Uprising, they volunteered for the army. They both fought in the siege of Zamość. They founded and commanded their own banners (&quot;chorągiew&quot;) of cavalry (one light, &quot;cossack&quot;, and one heavy, of Polish hussars). Soon, the fortunes of war separated the brothers. In 1649, Jakub fought in the Battle of Zboriv. In 1652, Marek died in Tatar captivity after his capture at the Battle of Batih. John was promoted to the rank of &quot;pułkownik&quot; and fought with distinction in the Battle of Berestechko. In 1653, he voluntarily spent time as a hostage in the Crimean Tatar capital of Bakhchysarai. A promising commander, John was sent by King John II Casimir as one of the envoys in the diplomatic mission of Mikołaj Bieganowski to the Ottoman Empire. There, Sobieski learned the Tatar language and the Turkish language and studied Ottoman military traditions and tactics. It is likely he participated as part of the briefly allied Polish-Tatar forces in the 1655 Battle of Okhmativ.

After the start of the Swedish invasion of Poland known as &quot;The Deluge&quot;, John Sobieski was among the Greater Polish regiments led by Krzysztof Opaliński, Palatine of Poznań which capitulated at Ujście, and swore allegiance to King Charles X Gustav of Sweden. However, around late March 1656, he abandoned their side, returning to the side of Polish king John II Casimir Vasa, enlisting under the command of hetmans Stefan Czarniecki and Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski.

=== Commander ===
By 26 May 1656, he received the position of the &quot;chorąży koronny&quot; (Standard-bearer of the Crown). During the three-day-long battle of Warsaw of 1656, Sobieski commanded a 2,000-man strong regiment of Tatar cavalry. He took part in a number of engagements over the next two years, including the Siege of Toruń in 1658. In 1659, he was elected a deputy to the Sejm (Polish parliament), and was one of the Polish negotiators of the Treaty of Hadiach with the Cossacks. In 1660, he took part in the last offensive against the Swedes in Prussia, and was rewarded with the office of &quot;starost&quot; of Stryj. Soon afterward he took part in the war against the Russians, participating in the Battle of Slobodyshche and Battle of Lyubar, and later that year he again was one of the negotiators of a new treaty with the Cossacks (the Treaty of Cudnów).

Through personal connections, he became a strong supporter of the French faction in the Polish royal court, represented by Queen Marie Louise Gonzaga. His pro-French allegiance was reinforced in 1665, when he married Marie Casimire Louise de la Grange d&#x27;Arquien and was promoted to the rank of the Crown Grand Marshal.

In 1662, he was again elected a deputy to the Sejm, and took part in the work on reforming the military. He was also a member of the Sejm in 1664 and 1665. In between he participated in the Russian campaign of 1663. Sobieski remained loyal to the King during the Lubomirski Rebellion of 1665–66, though it was a difficult decision for him. He participated in the Sejm of 1665, and after some delays, accepted the prestigious office of the Marshal of the Crown on 18 May that year. Around late April or early May 1666 he received another high office of the Commonwealth, that of the Field Crown Hetman. Soon afterward, he was defeated at the Battle of Mątwy, and signed the Agreement of Łęgonice on 21 July, which ended the Lubomirski Rebellion.

In October 1667, he achieved another victory over the Cossacks of Petro Doroshenko and their Crimean Tatar allies in the Battle of Podhajce during the Polish–Cossack–Tatar War (1666–71). This allowed him to regain his image as a skilled military leader. Later that year, in November, his first child, James Louis Sobieski was born in Paris. On 5 February 1668, he achieved the rank of Grand Hetman of the Crown, the highest military rank in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and thereby the &quot;de facto&quot; commander-in-chief of the entire Polish Army. Later that year he supported the French candidacy of Louis, Grand Condé for the Polish throne, and after this candidacy fell apart, Philip William, Elector Palatine. Following the election of Michał Korybut Wiśniowiecki he joined the opposition faction; he and his allies helped veto several sejms (including the coronation ones), and his attitude once again resulted in him losing popularity among the regular &quot;szlachta&quot;. While his pro-French stance in politics alienated some, his military victories against invading Tatars in 1671 helped him gain other allies. 

The year 1672 saw internal politics destabilizing the Commonwealth, as the pro-French faction of Sobieski and pro-court faction of King Michał formed two confederations, which despite major Ottoman incursions in the south seemed more concerned with one another than with uniting to defend the country. The court faction called openly for confiscation of his estates and dismissal from office, and declared him an &quot;enemy of the state&quot;. This division culminated in the humiliating Treaty of Buchach, where the Commonwealth was forced to cede territories to the Ottomans, but promise an annual tribute. Sobieski eventually succeeded in balancing politics and national defense, and a combination of his military victories over the invaders, and successful negotiations at the Sejm in April 1673, led to a compromise in which the court faction dropped its demands and challenges against him.

In the year 1672, the Polish-Lithuanian Tatars rose up in open rebellion against the Commonwealth. This was the widely remembered Lipka rebellion. Thanks to the efforts of Sobieski, who was held in great esteem by the Tatar soldiers, many of the Lipkas seeking asylum and service in the Ottoman Army returned to his command.

On 11 November 1673, Sobieski added a major victory to his list, this time defeating the Ottomans in the Battle of Khotyn and capturing the fortress located there. The news of the battle coincided with the death of King Michal the day before the battle. This made Sobieski one of the leading figures of the state, so on 19 May the following year, he was elected monarch of the Commonwealth. His candidacy was almost universally supported, with only a dozen or so members of the diet opposing him (mainly centered around magnates of the Lithuanian Pac family). In light of the war, requiring Sobieski to be on the front lines, the coronation ceremony was significantly delayed – he was crowned John III almost two years later, on 2 February 1676.

=== King of Poland ===
Though Poland-Lithuania was at that time the largest and one of the most populous states of Europe, Sobieski became a king of a country devastated by almost half a century of constant war. The treasury was almost empty and the court had little to offer the powerful magnates, who often allied themselves with foreign courts rather than the state.

Sobieski had a number of long-term plans, including establishing his own dynasty in the Commonwealth, regaining lost territories, and strengthening the country through various reforms. One of his ambitions was to unify Christian Europe in a crusade to drive the Turks out of Europe. At the beginning of his reign, however, the Polish state was in dire fiscal straits and faced military threats to the north. King Louis XIV of France promised to mediate a truce between the Ottomans and Poland so that Sobieski could focus his attentions on Prussia. The negotiations ended in failure and Sobieski&#x27;s Baltic goals had to be tempered by the immediate reality of the Ottoman threat to the south.
In the autumn of 1674, he recommenced the war against the Ottomans and managed to recapture a number of cities and fortresses including Bratslav, Mogilev, and Bar, which re-established a strongly fortified line defending Poland&#x27;s southern border in Ukraine. In 1675, Sobieski defeated a Turkish and Tatar offensive aiming at Lviv. In 1676, the Tatars began a counter-offensive and crossed the Dneper, but could not retake the strategic town of Żórawno, and a peace treaty (the Treaty of Żurawno) was signed soon afterwards. Although Kamieniec Podolski and much of Podolia remained a part of the Ottoman Empire, Poland gained the return of the towns of Bila Tserkva and Pavoloch.

The treaty with the Ottomans began a period of peace that was much needed for the repair of the country and strengthening of the royal authority. Sobieski managed to reform the Polish army completely. The army was reorganised into regiments, the infantry finally dropped pikes, replacing them with battle-axes, and the Polish cavalry adopted hussar and dragoon formations. Sobieski also greatly increased the number of cannon and introduced new artillery tactics.

Sobieski wanted to conquer Prussia with Swedish troops and French support. Regaining control of this autonomous province was in the Commonwealth&#x27;s best interest, and Sobieski also hoped for it to become part of his family domain. To this end he made the secret Treaty of Jaworów (1675), but he achieved nothing. The wars with the Ottoman Empire were not decisively won by the Commonwealth, the ruler of Brandenburg-Prussia made treaties with France, Prussia defeated the Swedish invasion, and Sobieski&#x27;s plans for the Commonwealth&#x27;s own military campaign against Prussia was opposed by Commonwealth magnates, many of them taking the Prussian side. Backed by Brandenburg and Austria, internal enemies of Sobieski even planned to dethrone him and elect Charles of Lorraine.
The French-Prussian treaty of 1679 meant that Sobieski lost the major foreign ally for his planned campaign against Prussia; consequently, he started to distance himself from the pro-French faction, which, in turn, resulted in the cooling down of the Polish-French relations. During the Sejm of 1683, the French ambassador was expelled for involvement with a plan to dethrone Sobieski, which definitely marked the end of the Polish-French alliance. At the same time Sobieski made peace with the pro-Habsburg faction and started to gravitate towards an alliance with Austria. This did not end the existence of strong internal opposition to Sobieski; however, it changed a number of allegiances, and further opposition was temporarily weakened through the king&#x27;s successful political maneuvering, including granting the Grand Hetman office to one of the opposition&#x27;s chief leaders, Stanisław Jan Jabłonowski.
Conscious that Poland lacked allies and risked war against most of its neighbours (a situation similar to the Deluge), Sobieski allied himself by 1683 with Leopold I, of the Holy Roman Empire. Both sides promised to come to one&#x27;s another aid if their capitals were threatened. The alliance was signed by royal representatives on 31 March 1683 and ratified by the Emperor and Polish parliament within weeks. Although aimed directly against the Ottomans and indirectly against France, it had the advantage of gaining internal support for the defense of Poland&#x27;s southern borders. This was a beginning of what would become the Holy League, championed by Pope Innocent XI to preserve Christendom.

Meantime, in the spring of 1683, royal spies uncovered Ottoman preparations for a military campaign. Sobieski feared that the target might be the Polish cities of Lwów and Kraków. To counteract the threat, Sobieski began the fortification of the cities and ordered universal military conscription. In July, the Austrian envoy asked for Polish assistance. Soon afterward, the Polish army started massing for an expedition against the Ottomans, and in August was joined by Bavarians and Saxon allies under Charles of Lorraine.

=== Battle of Vienna ===

Sobieski&#x27;s greatest success came in 1683, with his victory at the Battle of Vienna, in joint command of Polish, Austrian and German troops, against the invading Ottomans under Kara Mustafa. Upon reaching Vienna on 12 September, with the Ottoman Army close to breaching the walls, Sobieski ordered a full attack. In the early morning, the united army of about 65,000–76,000 men (including 22,000,–27,000 Poles) attacked a Turkish force of about 143,000 men. At about 5:00 pm, after observing the infantry battle from the Kahlenberg hilltop, Sobieski led the Polish cavalry along with Austrians and Germans in a massive charge down the hillside. Soon, the Ottoman battle line was broken and the Ottoman forces scattered in disarray. At 5:30 pm, Sobieski entered the deserted tent of Kara Mustafa and the Battle of Vienna ended.

The Pope and other foreign dignitaries hailed Sobieski as the &quot;Savior of Vienna and Western European civilization.&quot; In a letter to his wife, he wrote, &quot;All the common people kissed my hands, my feet, my clothes; others only touched me, saying: &#x27;Ah, let us kiss so valiant a hand!&#x27;&quot;

The war against the Ottomans was not yet over, and Sobieski continued the campaign with the Battle of Párkány on 7–9 October. After early victories, the Polish found themselves a junior partner in the Holy League, gaining no lasting territorial or political rewards. The prolonged and indecisive war also weakened Sobieski&#x27;s position at home. For the next four years Poland would blockade the key fortress at Kamenets, and Ottoman Tatars would raid the borderlands. In 1691, Sobieski undertook another expedition to Moldavia, with slightly better results, but still with no decisive victories.

=== Later years and death ===
Although the King spent much time on the battlefields, which could suggest a good state of health, towards the end of his life he became seriously and increasingly ill.

King John III Sobieski died in Wilanów, Poland on 17 June 1696 from a sudden heart attack. His wife, Marie Casimire Louise, died in 1716 in Blois, France, and her body was returned to Poland. They are interred together in Wawel Cathedral, Kraków, although his heart is interred separately in the Church of the Transfiguration in Warsaw, Poland. He was succeeded by Augustus II.

== Legacy and significance ==
Sobieski is remembered in Poland as a &quot;hero king&quot;, victor at Vienna who defeated the Ottoman threat, an image that became particularly well recognized after his story was told in many works of 19th-century literature. In the &quot;Polish Biographical Dictionary&quot; he is described as &quot;an individual above his contemporaries, but still one of them&quot;; an oligarch and a magnate, interested in personal wealth and power. His ambitions for the most part were instilled in him by his beloved wife, whom he undoubtedly loved more than any throne (when being forced to divorce her and marry the former Queen as a condition to gain the throne, he immediately refused the throne) and tended to obey, at times blindly.

He failed to reform the ailing Commonwealth, and to secure the throne for his heir. At the same time, he displayed high military prowess, he was well educated and literate, and a patron of science and arts. He supported the astronomer Johannes Hevelius, mathematician Adam Adamandy Kochański and the historian and poet Wespazjan Kochowski. His Wilanów Palace became the first of many palaces that would dot the lands of the Commonwealth over the next two centuries.

<doc id="48308" wikidata="Q1166802" url="?curid=48308" title="Dartmouth Dam">
<text>Dartmouth Dam is a large rock-fill embankment dam with an uncontrolled chute spillway across the Mitta Mitta, Gibbo and Dart rivers, the Morass Creek and a number of small tributaries. The dam is located near Mount Bogong in the north-east of the Australian state of Victoria. The dam&#x27;s purpose includes irrigation, the generation of hydro-electric power, water supply and conservation. The impounded reservoir is called Dartmouth Reservoir, sometimes called Lake Dartmouth. The Dartmouth Power Station, a hydro-electric power station that generates power to the national grid, is located near the dam wall.

A smaller pond, called the Dartmouth Dam Regulating Pond or Banimboola Pondage, approximately downstream of the main dam, also across the Mitta Mitta River, is located adjacent the Banimboola Hydroelectric Power Station and forms part of the Dartmouth Dam complex of facilities.

==Location and features==
Designed by the State Rivers &amp; Water Supply Commission of Victoria, construction commenced in 1973 and was completed in 1979 by Thiess Brothers, at a cost of A$179 million. The embankment dam wall is constructed with an earth core and rock fill, rising to a height of from the lowest part of the foundation to the roadway across the top of the dam, making the dam wall the highest in Australia. 

The core component materials of the wall include of rock, of filter material made from crushed quarried rock, and of earth for the core. The reservoir has a capacity of , or approximately 6.7 times the capacity of Sydney Harbour; and can release a maximum outflow of approximately per day in normal operation.

The crest of the uncontrolled spillway is and is approximately long. When full, flood flows spill over the crest and down an concrete chute. The water then returns to the river via an open rock cascade which gradually widens to at river level. Once Dartmouth Reservoir reaches 99% capacity, it is considered to be &#x27;operationally full&#x27;. Releases are then set to pass inflows downstream to prevent the level rising further.

Releases are passed through the outlet works and power station whenever possible. Water will only flow over the spillway if significant flood inflows enter from upstream when the storage is close to full. This approach reduces the chance of downstream flooding, maximises operating flexibility for hydro-power generation, and protects the spillway.

The Dartmouth Dam stores water from the Victorian High Country&#x27;s snow fields for summer release into the Mitta Mitta, and the downstream Lake Hume, and into the greater Murray River for irrigation. The reservoir&#x27;s inflow and outflow capacity is quite small considering its size, meaning that its levels vary little compared with some other dams on the Murray and their tributaries.

The reservoir is a popular recreational trout fishery, being regularly restocked by the Victorian Department of Primary Industries.

==Hydro-electric power generation==
Designed by the State Electricity Commission of Victoria, and constructed by Lewis Constructions, and commissioned in January 1981, Dartmouth Power Station has one Francis turbine-generator, with a generating capacity of , the largest single installed hydroelectric turbine in Australia. It is owned and operated by AGL Energy.

===Power station damage===
On 2 May 1990, the 180 MW Francis turbine-generator running at full speed was instantaneously stopped by a foreign body left in the penstock following maintenance. The installation shifted about 2 m within the base of the earth and rock fill gravity dam wall of the 3,906 GL reservoir. After initial consternation regarding the integrity of the wall, declared safe after lengthy assessment), the hydro installation was repaired/replaced, but was off-line for several years. 

A breach of the wall would have obliterated a couple of small towns and a sparsely settled agricultural area in the relatively narrow 120 km Mitta Mitta valley below the dam. More significantly, it would have resulted in the over-topping and probable failure of the earthen walls of the , 3,038 GL Lake Hume, 200 km downstream on the Murray River. This is immediately upstream of the regional cities of Albury and Wodonga, and a much more intensively settled irrigation area, and consequences would have been disastrous.

In May 1990, the turbine casing and concrete machine block surrounding the power station were destroyed, when two steel beams entered the turbine. The resulting force ruined the power station and the dam&#x27;s control systems, making it impossible to gradually release water from the near-capacity dam by conventional means. An improvised system, placing large pipes over the spillway to siphon water over it, was soon installed. The inflow from an unusually wet spring meant that the dam would have overflowed anyway, leading to a spectacular cascade over the huge rock steps, formed when the rock used for the dam was quarried from the valley walls. The station was re-built and recommissioned in 1993.

===Pondage expansion===
In 2003, the capacity of the regulating pondage was increased to further optimise the power station&#x27;s generation flexibility. The station is connected to the electricity grid via a 220 kV transmission line to Mount Beauty, away.

==Ecological impact on the Murray–Darling Basin==
The construction and operation of Dartmouth Dam has caused significant changes to the flow patterns and ecology of the Mitta Mitta and Murray rivers. In particular, the unnaturally cold water released from the dam, up to 10 degrees C (18 degrees F) colder than it naturally should be, contributed directly to the disappearance of the Murray cod, trout cod and Macquarie perch from the Mitta Mitta River within the first few years of the start of the dam&#x27;s existence. Cold water pollution caused by Dartmouth Dam is also considered to have contributed to the disappearance of the freshwater catfish from the upper reaches of the Murray River.

==Climate==

Climate data for the region are sourced at the bottom of the dam wall, in a relatively sheltered spot at above sea level. Rainfall records began in 1918. Temperature records began in 1975. Winter is twice as wet as summer, and occasionally it may snow.

<doc id="48309" wikidata="Q738653" url="?curid=48309" title="Algebraic notation (chess)">
<text>Algebraic notation is the standard method of chess notation, used for recording and describing moves. It is based on a system of coordinates to uniquely identify each square on the board. It is now almost universally used by books, magazines, newspapers and software, and is the only form of notation recognized by FIDE, the international chess governing body.

An early form of algebraic notation was invented by the Syrian player Philip Stamma in the 18th century. In the 19th century, it came into general use in German chess literature, and was subsequently adopted in Russian chess literature. Descriptive notation, based on abbreviated natural language, was generally used in English language chess publications until the 1980s. Similar descriptive systems were in use in Spain and France. A few players still use descriptive notation, but it is no longer recognized by FIDE, and may not be used as evidence in the event of a dispute.

The term &quot;algebraic notation&quot; may be considered a misnomer, as the system is unrelated to algebra.

==Naming the squares==
Each square of the board is identified by a unique coordinate pair—a letter and a number—from White&#x27;s point of view. The vertical columns of squares, called &#x27;, are labeled &quot;a&quot; through &quot;h&quot; from White&#x27;s left (the ) to right (the ). The horizontal rows of squares, called &#x27;, are numbered &quot;1&quot; to &quot;8&quot; starting from White&#x27;s side of the board. Thus each square has a unique identification of file letter followed by rank number. For example, the initial square of White&#x27;s king is designated as &quot;e1&quot;.

==Naming the pieces==

Each piece type (other than pawns) is identified by an uppercase letter. English-speaking players use the letters &quot;K&quot; for king, &quot;Q&quot; for queen, &quot;R&quot; for rook, &quot;B&quot; for bishop and &quot;N&quot; for knight. Different initial letters are used by other languages.

In modern chess literature, especially that intended for an international audience, the language-specific letters are usually replaced by universally recognized piece symbols; for example, ♞c6 in place of Nc6. This style is known as &quot;figurine algebraic notation&quot;. The Unicode Miscellaneous Symbols set includes all the symbols necessary for figurine algebraic notation.

==Notation for moves==
In standard (or short form) algebraic notation, each move of a piece is indicated by the piece&#x27;s uppercase letter, plus the coordinates of the destination square. For example, Be5 (bishop moves to e5), Nf3 (knight moves to f3). For pawn moves, a letter indicating pawn is not used, only the destination square is given. For example, c5 (pawn moves to c5).

===Captures ===
When a piece makes a , an &quot;x&quot; is inserted immediately before the destination square. For example, Bxe5 (bishop captures the piece on e5). When a pawn makes a capture, the from which the pawn departed is used to identify the pawn. For example, exd5 (pawn on the e-file captures the piece on d5).

&quot;En passant&quot; captures are indicated by specifying the capturing pawn&#x27;s file of departure, the &quot;x&quot;, the destination square (not the square of the captured pawn), and (optionally) the suffix &quot;e.p.&quot; indicating the capture was &quot;en passant&quot;. For example, exd6 e.p.

Sometimes a multiplication sign (×) or a colon (:) is used instead of &quot;x&quot;, either in the middle (B:e5) or at the end (Be5:). Some publications, such as the &quot;Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings&quot; (&quot;ECO&quot;), omit any indication that a capture has been made; for example, Be5 instead of Bxe5; ed6 instead of exd6 or exd6 e.p.

When it is unambiguous to do so, a pawn capture is sometimes described by specifying only the files involved (exd or even ed). These shortened forms are sometimes called &quot;abbreviated algebraic notation&quot; or &quot;minimal algebraic notation&quot;.

===Disambiguating moves===
When two (or more) identical pieces can move to the same square, the moving piece is uniquely identified by specifying the piece&#x27;s letter, followed by (in descending order of preference):
# the file of departure (if they differ)
# the rank of departure (if the files are the same but the ranks differ)

If neither file nor rank alone is sufficient to identify the piece (such as when three or more pieces of the same type can move to the same square), then both are specified (double disambiguation).

In the diagram, both black rooks could legally move to f8, so the move of the d8-rook to f8 is disambiguated as Rdf8. For the white rooks on the a-file which could both move to a3, it is necessary to provide the of the moving piece, i.e., R1a3.

In the case of the white queen on h4 moving to e1, neither the rank nor file alone are sufficient to disambiguate from the other white queens. As such, this move is written Qh4e1.

As above, an &quot;x&quot; can be inserted to indicate a capture; for example, if the final case were a capture, it would be written as Qh4xe1.

===Pawn promotion===
When a pawn promotes, the piece promoted to is indicated at the end. For example, a pawn on e7 promoting to a queen on e8 may be variously rendered as e8Q, e8=Q, e8(Q), e8/Q etc.

===Castling ===
Castling is indicated by the special notations 0-0 (for castling) and 0-0-0 ( castling). O-O and O-O-O (letter O rather than digit 0) are also commonly used.

===Check === 
A move that places the opponent&#x27;s king in check usually has the symbol &quot;+&quot; appended. Alternatively, sometimes a dagger (†) or the abbreviation &quot;ch&quot; is used. Some publications indicate a discovered check with an abbreviation such as &quot;dis ch&quot;, or with a specific symbol. Double check is usually indicated the same as check, but is sometimes represented specifically as &quot;dbl ch&quot; or &quot;++&quot;, particularly in older chess literature. Some publications such as &quot;ECO&quot; omit any indication of check.

===Checkmate ===
Checkmate at the completion of moves is represented by the symbol &quot;#&quot; in standard FIDE notation and PGN. The word &quot;mate&quot; is commonly used instead; occasionally a double dagger () or a double plus sign (++) is used, although the double plus sign is also used to represent &quot;double check&quot; when a king is under attack by two enemy pieces simultaneously. A checkmate is represented by &quot;&quot; (the not equal sign) in the macOS chess application. In Russian and ex-USSR publications, where captures are indicated by &quot;:&quot;, checkmate can also be represented by &quot;X&quot; or &quot;x&quot;.

===Draw offer ===
FIDE specifies draw offers to be recorded by an equals sign with parentheses &quot;(=)&quot; after the move on the . This is not usually included in published game scores.

===End of game ===
The notation 1–0 at the completion of moves indicates that White won, 0–1 indicates that Black won and ½–½ indicates a draw. In case of , the scores 0–0, ½–0 and 0–½ are also possible. If player(s) lost by default, results are +/−, −/+ or −/−.

Except in the case of checkmate, there is no information in the notation regarding the circumstance of the final result. Simply 1–0 or 0–1 is written whether a player resigned, lost due to time control or forfeited; in the case of a draw simply ½–½ is written whether the draw was decided by mutual agreement, repetition, stalemate, 50-move rule or dead position. Sometimes direct information is given by words such as &quot;resigns&quot;, &quot;draw agreed&quot; etc, but this is not considered part of the notation, rather a part of the narrative text.

==Similar notations==
Besides standard (or short form) algebraic notation already described, several similar systems have been used.

===Long algebraic notation===
In long algebraic notation, also known as fully expanded algebraic notation, both the starting and ending squares are specified, for example: e2e4. Sometimes these are separated by a hyphen, e.g. Nb1-c3, while captures are indicated by an &quot;x&quot;, e.g. Rd3xd7. Long algebraic notation takes more space and is no longer commonly used in print; however, it has the advantage of clarity. Both short and long algebraic notation are acceptable for keeping a record of the moves on a scoresheet, as is required in FIDE rated games.

A form of long algebraic notation (without piece names) is also used by the Universal Chess Interface (UCI) standard, which is a common way for graphical chess programs to communicate with chess engines, e.g. e2e4, e1g1 (castling), e7e8q (promotion).

===ICCF numeric notation===
In international correspondence chess the use of algebraic notation may cause confusion, since different languages employ different names (and therefore different initial letters) for the pieces, and some players may be unfamiliar with the Latin alphabet. Hence, the standard for transmitting moves by post or email is ICCF numeric notation, which identifies squares using numerical coordinates, and identifies both the departure and destination squares. For example, the move 1.e4 is rendered as 1.5254. In recent years, the majority of correspondence games have been played on on-line servers rather than by email or post, leading to a decline in the use of ICCF numeric notation.

===PGN===
Portable Game Notation (PGN) is a text-based file format for storing chess games, which uses standard English algebraic notation and a small amount of markup. PGN can be processed by almost all chess software, as well as being easily readable by humans. For example, the Game of the Century could be represented as follows in PGN:

==Formatting==

A game or series of moves is generally written in one of two ways; in two columns, as White/Black pairs, preceded by the move number and a period:
:1. e4 e5
:2. Nf3 Nc6
:3. Bb5 a6
or horizontally:
:1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6
Moves may be interspersed with commentary, called &quot;&quot;. When the resumes with a Black move, an ellipsis (...) fills the position of the White move, for example:
:1. e4 e5 2. Nf3
::White attacks the black e-pawn.
:2... Nc6
::Black defends and develops simultaneously.
:3. Bb5
::White plays the Ruy Lopez.
:3... a6
::Black elects Morphy&#x27;s Defense.

==Annotation symbols==

Though not technically a part of algebraic notation, the following are some symbols commonly used by annotators, for example in publications &quot;Chess Informant&quot; and &quot;Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings&quot;, to give editorial comment on a move or position.

The symbol chosen is simply appended to the end of the move notation, for example, in the Soller Gambit: 1.d4 e5?! 2.dxe5 f6 3.e4! Nc6 4.Bc4+/−

==History==
Descriptive notation was usual in the Middle Ages in Europe. A form of algebraic chess notation that seems to have been borrowed from Muslim chess, however, appeared in Europe in a 12th-century manuscript referred to as &quot;MS. Paris Fr. 1173 (PP.)&quot;. The files run from &quot;a&quot; to &quot;h&quot;, just as they do in the current standard algebraic notation. The ranks, however, are also designated by letters, with the exception of the 8th rank which is distinct because it has no letter. The ranks are lettered in reverse – from the 7th to the 1st: &quot;k&quot;, &quot;l&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, &quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;.

Another system of notation using only letters appears in a book of Mediaeval chess, Rechenmeister Jacob Köbel&#x27;s &quot;Schachzabel Spiel&quot; of 1520.

Algebraic notation exists in various forms and languages and is based on a system developed by Philipp Stamma in the 1730s. Stamma used the modern names of the squares (and may have been the first to number the ranks), but he used &quot;p&quot; for pawn moves and the capital original of a piece (&quot;A&quot; through &quot;H&quot;) instead of the initial letter of the piece name as used now. Piece letters were introduced in the 1780s by Moses Hirschel, and Johann Allgaier with Aaron Alexandre developed the modern castling notation in the 1810s.

Algebraic notation was described in 1847 by Howard Staunton in his book &quot;The Chess-Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot;. Staunton credits the idea to German authors, and in particular to &quot;Alexandre, Jaenisch, and the &quot;Handbuch&quot; &quot;. While algebraic notation has been used in German and Russian chess literature since the 19th century, the Anglosphere was slow to adopt it, using descriptive notation for much of the 20th century. Beginning in the 1970s, algebraic notation gradually became more common in English language publications, and by 1980 it had become the prevalent notation. In 1981, FIDE stopped recognizing descriptive notation, and algebraic notation became the accepted international standard.

==Piece names in various languages==
The table contains names for all the pieces as well as the words for , and in several languages. Several languages use the Arabic loanword &quot;alfil&quot; for the piece called &quot;bishop&quot; in English; in this context it is a chess-specific term which no longer has its original meaning of &quot;elephant&quot;.

<doc id="48310" wikidata="Q1750272" url="?curid=48310" title="Milk bar">
<text>In Australia, a milk bar is a suburban local general store which can include delicatessens or &quot;delis&quot; and corner shops or corner stores. Similar, but not identical, establishments include tuck shops. Milk bars are traditionally a place where people buy newspapers, and fast-food items such as fish and chips, hamburgers, milkshakes, and snacks. They are essentially a smaller-scale suburban form of the convenience store but are more likely to be &quot;mum and dad&quot; small businesses rather than larger franchised operations. The term is also found in New Zealand, alongside the more local term dairy.

==History==

The first business using the name &quot;milk bar&quot; was started in India in 1930 by an Englishman, James Meadow Charles when he opened Lake View Milk Bar at Bangalore. The concept soon spread to the United Kingdom, where it was encouraged by the Temperance Society as a morally acceptable alternative to the pub, and over 1,000 milk bars had opened nationally by the end of 1936. Milk bars were known in the United States at least as early as 1940 as evidenced by contemporary radio recordings.

By the late 1940s, milk bars had evolved to not only sell groceries, but were also places where young people could buy ready-made food and non-alcoholic drinks, and could socialise. Milk bars often had jukeboxes and pinball machines (later upgraded to video games), with tables and chairs to encourage patrons to linger and spend more money.

The milk bar as a social venue was gradually replaced by fast food franchises, such as McDonald&#x27;s, and shopping malls. Much of the elaborate decor has disappeared from the remaining milk bars. They are still found in many areas, often serving as convenience stores.

==Modern era==
===Australia===

Milk bars in Australia today almost universally sell ice creams, lollies, chocolate bars, soft drinks, newspapers, bread, cigarettes and occasionally fast food. Most generally serve milk (in cartons or bottles) or other dairy related products. Although there are far fewer milk bars than there were during the 1970s and 80s due to changing shopping habits, most people living in suburban areas still have a milk bar within walking distance or a short drive of their home.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, the National Milk Bar franchise was founded in 1933 by Robert William Griffiths as an ordinary café/restaurant chain which is related to the original milk bars in name only. Once numbering around 20 outlets, which were located in Wales and in England near the Welsh border, now only one remains. In the UK, corner shops serve a similar function to milk bars in modern Australia, providing everyday groceries, sweets, newspapers and such.

There is a campaign in the United Kingdom to encourage schoolchildren to consume more dairy products, by installing &#x27;milk bars&#x27; in schools. The idea is that if the dairy products are attractively presented and properly stored, the children will be more willing to buy them. The organisers behind the project work to develop links with school caterers, so that the handling of milk and dairy produce can be improved, and they promote milk consumption and encourage milk drinking to become a habit that will be carried into adulthood. The milk bar project has been extremely successful in Scotland for 18 years, and it is currently being extended across England and Wales.

==Similar establishments==
A &quot;dairy bar&quot; is the term for a similar restaurant/store common in the Northeastern United States, especially upstate New York, which is a large producer of dairy products. A &quot;malt shop&quot; (named for the ingredient in a malted milkshake) is very similar to a milk or dairy bar, serving milkshakes and soft drinks as well as limited foods, such as hamburgers and sandwiches. Although there are still a few around, these have largely fallen out of fashion in favor of fast food.

The term dairy is also used for these establishments in some places, particularly in New Zealand.

The term bar mleczny () in Poland is used to describe popular and cheap cafeterias from the communist era that still exist today. They provide a wide range of government-subsidised meals. In 2011, however, the Polish government began to withdraw their subsidies, and this led to protests by people opposed to their closure.

<doc id="48312" wikidata="Q36332" url="?curid=48312" title="Iguazu Falls">
<text>Iguazú Falls or Iguaçu Falls ( , ; ) are waterfalls of the Iguazu River on the border of the Argentine province of Misiones and the Brazilian state of Paraná. Together, they make up the largest waterfall system in the world. The falls divide the river into the upper and lower Iguazu. The Iguazu River rises near the heart of the city of Curitiba. For most of its course, the river flows through Brazil; however, most of the falls are on the Argentine side. Below its confluence with the San Antonio River, the Iguazu River forms the border between Argentina and Brazil.

The name &quot;Iguazú&quot; comes from the Guarani or Tupi words &quot;y&quot; , meaning &quot;water&quot;, and &quot;ûasú&quot; , meaning &quot;big&quot;. Legend has it that a deity planned to marry a beautiful woman named Naipí, who fled with her mortal lover Tarobá in a canoe. In a rage, the deity sliced the river, creating the waterfalls and condemning the lovers to an eternal fall. The first European to record the existence of the falls was the Spanish Conquistador Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca in 1541. It was inscribed into the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2013.

==Geology and geography==

The staircase character of the falls consists of a two-step waterfall formed by three layers of basalt. The steps are in height. The columnar basalt rock sequences are part of the Serra Geral formation within the Paleozoic-Mesozoic Paraná Basin. The tops of these sequences are characterized by of highly resistant vesicular basalt and the contact between these layers controls the shape of the falls. Headwater erosion rates are estimated at . Numerous islands along the edge divide the falls into many separate waterfalls and cataracts, varying between high. The number of these smaller waterfalls fluctuates from 150 to 300, depending on the water level. About half of the river&#x27;s flow falls into a long and narrow chasm called the Devil&#x27;s Throat ( in Spanish or in Portuguese).

The Devil&#x27;s Throat canyon is wide and deep. Left of this canyon, another part of the river forms 160–200 individual falls, which merge into a single front during the flood stage. The largest falls are named San Martín, Adam and Eva, Penoni, and Bergano.

About of the length does not have water flowing over it. The water of the lower Iguazu collects in a canyon that drains into the Paraná River, a short distance downstream from the Itaipu Dam. The junction of the water flows marks the border between Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay. Some points in the cities of Foz do Iguaçu, Brazil, Puerto Iguazú, Argentina, and Ciudad del Este, Paraguay, have access to the Iguazu River, where the borders of all three nations may be seen, a popular tourist attraction for visitors to the three cities.

The Iguazu Falls are arranged in a way that resembles a reversed letter &quot;J&quot;. The Argentina–Brazil border runs through the Devil&#x27;s Throat. On the right bank is the Brazilian territory, which is home to more than 95% of the Iguazu River basin but has just over 20% of the jumps of these falls, and the left side jumps are Argentine, which make up almost 80% of the falls.

==Tourism==
Aerolíneas Argentinas has direct flights from Buenos Aires to Iguazu International Airport. Azul, GOL, and LATAM Brasil offer services from main Brazilian cities to Foz do Iguaçu.

==Access==

The falls may be reached from two main towns, with one on either side of the falls: Foz do Iguaçu in Brazil and Puerto Iguazú in Argentina, as well as from Ciudad del Este, Paraguay, on the other side of the Paraná River from Foz do Iguaçu, each of those three cities having commercial airports. The falls are shared by the Iguazú National Park (Argentina) and Iguaçu National Park (Brazil). The two parks were designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1984 and 1986, respectively.

The first proposal for a Brazilian national park aimed at providing a pristine environment to &quot;future generations&quot;, just as &quot;it had been created by God&quot; and endowed with &quot;all possible preservation, from the beautiful to the sublime, from the picturesque to the awesome&quot; and &quot;an unmatched flora&quot; located in the &quot;magnificent Iguaçu waterfalls&quot;. These were the words used by André Rebouças, an engineer, in his book &quot;Provinces of Paraná, Railways to Mato Grosso and Bolivia&quot;, which started up the campaign aimed at preserving the Iguaçu Falls in 1876. At this time, Yellowstone National Park in the US, the first national park in the world, was four years old.

On the Brazilian side, a walkway along the canyon has an extension to the lower base of Devil&#x27;s Throat. Helicopter rides offering aerial views of the falls have been available from Brazil, but Argentina has prohibited such helicopter tours because of the adverse environmental impact on the flora and fauna of the falls. From Foz do Iguaçu airport, the park may be reached by taking a taxi or bus to the entrance of the park. Their park has an entrance fee on both sides. Once inside, free and frequent buses are provided to various points within the park. The town of Foz do Iguaçu is about away, and the airport is between the park and the town.

The Argentine access, across the forest, is by a Rainforest Ecological Train very similar to the one in Disney&#x27;s Animal Kingdom. The train brings visitors to the entrance of Devil&#x27;s Throat, as well as the upper and lower trails. The &quot;Paseo Garganta del Diablo&quot; is a trail that brings visitors directly over the falls of Devil&#x27;s Throat, the highest and deepest of the falls. Other walkways allow access to the elongated stretch of falls across the forest on the Argentine side and to the boats that connect to San Martin Island. Also on the Argentine side, inflatable boat services take visitors very close to the falls.

The Brazilian transportation system aims at allowing an increase in the number of visitors, while reducing the adverse environmental impact, through an increase in the average number of passengers per vehicle inside the park. The new transportation system has a 72-passenger capacity and panoramic-view, double-deck buses.

==Comparisons to other notable falls==

Upon seeing Iguazu, the United States First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt reportedly exclaimed, &quot;Poor Niagara!&quot; (which, at 50 m or 165 feet, are a third shorter). Often, Iguazu also is compared with Victoria Falls in Southern Africa, which separates Zambia and Zimbabwe. Iguazu is wider but is split into roughly 275 distinct falls and large islands, whereas Victoria has the largest curtain of water in the world, at more than wide and over in height (in low flow, Victoria is split into five by islands but in high flow, it may be uninterrupted). The only wider falls are extremely large rapid-like falls, such as the Boyoma Falls (Stanley Falls).

With the flooding of the Guaíra Falls in 1982, Iguazu currently has the sixth-greatest average annual flow of any waterfall in the world, following number five Niagara, with an average rate of . Its maximum recorded flow was on 9 June 2014. By comparison, the average flow of Niagara Falls is , with a maximum recorded flow of . The average flow at Victoria Falls is , with a maximum recorded flow of .


==Climate==

The Iguazu Falls experience a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;, according to the Köppen climate classification) with abundant precipitation and high temperatures year-round. During the summer of 2006, a severe drought caused the Iguazu River to become diminished, reducing the amount of water flowing over the falls to until early December. This was unusual, as dry periods normally last only a few weeks. The period with the greatest volume of water flowing over the falls is usually December to February, coinciding with one of the periods of greatest rainfall.
==Popular culture==

Iguazu Falls has been featured in several TV shows and films, including:

<text>Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport – also known as Thurgood Marshall Airport, Baltimore/Washington International Airport, and simply as BWI Airport – is an international airport in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, located south of downtown Baltimore and northeast of Washington, D.C.

BWI is one of three major airports that serve the Washington–Baltimore metropolitan area. Dulles International Airport (IAD), in Dulles, Virginia, and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA), in Crystal City, Virginia, are the other two.

The airport serves as one of 12 U.S.-based operating bases for Southwest Airlines. In 2023, BWI recorded 12,849,636 passenger enplanements, making it the busiest airport in the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area, ranked at #23 in passenger enplanements in the U.S., followed by Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (#24) and Washington/Dulles Int&#x27;l Airport (#26).

In 2005, the airport was named in honor of Thurgood Marshall, a Baltimore native and the first African American to serve as a U.S. Supreme Court justice.

==History==
===20th century===

Planning for a new airport on to serve the Baltimore–Washington metropolitan area began in 1944, just prior to the end of World War II, when the Baltimore Aviation Commission announced its decision that the best location to build a new airport would be on a tract of land near Linthicum Heights, Maryland. The cost of building the airport was estimated at $9 million.

The site was chosen because it was a 15-minute drive from Downtown Baltimore, close to the Pennsylvania Railroad line, the Baltimore and Annapolis Railroad line, and the proposed Baltimore–Washington Parkway, and visibility at the site was generally good. An alternate site along Gov. Ritchie Highway at Furnace Branch was rejected by the United States Department of War, and another possible site at Lipin&#x27;s Corner was deemed too far from Baltimore. The State Aviation Commission approved of the Linthicum Heights site in 1946.

Much of the land was purchased from Friendship Methodist Church in 1946, and ground was broken on May 2, 1947. Friendship Methodist Church held its last service on Easter Sunday in 1948. Friendship Methodist Church was razed to make room for the new airport. In addition, several pieces of land were bought, and 170 bodies buried in a cemetery were moved. Baltimore–Fort Meade Road was moved to the west to make way for the airport&#x27;s construction.

Friendship International Airport was dedicated on June 24, 1950, by President Harry S. Truman. Truman arrived in a Douglas DC-6, then the official presidential airplane, from nearby Washington National Airport. Accompanying Truman were the Governor of Maryland, William Preston Lane Jr., and Baltimore Mayor Thomas D&#x27;Alesandro Jr., who was taking his first aircraft flight. The cost to construct the airport totaled $15 million. The following month, the airlines moved to the new airport from the old Baltimore Municipal Airport at Harbor Field in southeast Baltimore at . Eastern Airlines flew the first scheduled flight, a DC-3, into the airport at 12:01 am on July 23, 1950. Seven minutes later, the same plane was also the first flight to depart from the airport. Three hundred spectators came to watch the first flights arrive and depart.

The &quot;Official Airline Guide&quot; reports 52 weekday departures from the airport as of April 1957: 19 Eastern, 12 Capital, 8 American, four National, three TWA, three United, two Delta, and one Allegheny. The departures included a couple nonstop flights to Miami, but westward nonstop flights did not reach beyond Ohio. The airport&#x27;s reach expanded when jet service started. The early Boeing 707s and Douglas DC-8s could not use Washington National Airport, and Dulles International Airport, which opened in 1962, had not yet opened, so Baltimore became Washington, D.C.&#x27;s jet airport from May 1959 to June 1959, when American and TWA began transcontinental 707 flights. By 1963, Friendship Int&#x27;l Airport was equipped with a 9,450 foot (2,880 m) runway, which could handle any commercial jet aircraft at that time.

In 1972, the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT) purchased Friendship International Airport from the City of Baltimore for $36 million. Under MDOT, the Maryland State Aviation Administration took over airfield operations, and the airport grew from three employees to more than 200. Plans to upgrade, improve, and modernize all Maryland airport facilities were announced almost immediately by Harry Hughes, then Maryland Secretary of Transportation and later Governor of Maryland.

On November 16, 1973, in an effort to attract passengers from the Washington metropolitan area, particularly Montgomery and Prince George&#x27;s counties in suburban Maryland, the airport was renamed Baltimore/Washington International Airport. Its IATA code, originally BAL, was changed to BWI by the International Air Transport Association on April 20, 1980, and the change became official six months later, on October 26. The BWI code had previously been used by an airport in Bewani, Papua New Guinea.

In 1974, the first phase of the airport&#x27;s modernization was completed at a cost of $30 million. Upgrades included improved instrument landing capabilities and runway systems, and construction of three new air cargo terminals, expanding the airport&#x27;s freight capacity to .

In 1979, the terminal renovation program was completed, representing the most dramatic work of the airport&#x27;s modernization, which was designed by DMJM along with Peterson &amp; Brickbauer. The renovations more than doubled the size of BWI&#x27;s terminal to , and the number of gates increased from 20 to 27. The total cost was $70 million. To continue the work, the BWI Development Council was established to support initiatives for airport development.

In 1980, the BWI Rail Station opened, providing a connection for passengers on the Northeast Corridor through Amtrak. BWI was the first airport in the U.S. with a dedicated intercity rail station. The station provided rail transit access to Washington, D.C., something that Dulles International Airport did not achieve until late 2022.

In 1997, a new international terminal (Concourse E), designed by STV Group and William Nicholas Bodouva &amp; Associates, was added, though Dulles continues to hold the lion&#x27;s share of the region&#x27;s international flights, and BWI has not attracted many long-haul international carriers.

The first transatlantic nonstops were on World Airways about 1981; British Airways arrived at BWI a few years later. Aer Lingus, Air Jamaica, Air Aruba, Air Greenland, El Al, Icelandair, KLM, Air Canada, Ladeco, and Mexicana previously flew to BWI. Space-A flights operated by the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s Air Mobility Command have a significant presence at BWI.

Over the first half of the 1990s, runway 15L/33R was extended from to its current length of , allowing it to be used by small passenger jets like the Boeing 737.

Beginning in the 1980s and for much of the 1990s, BWI was a hub for Piedmont Airlines and successor US Airways, but that airline&#x27;s financial problems in the wake of the dot-com bust, the September 11 attacks, and low fare competition forced it to cut back. The airport has been a haven for low-cost flights in the Baltimore/Washington Metropolitan Area since Southwest Airlines&#x27; arrival in September 1993 and subsequent expansion in the early 2000s. Southwest is the airport&#x27;s largest carrier, accounting for 56.12% of the airport&#x27;s passengers in 2011. Southwest Airlines currently serves on average 245 daily departures to the U.S., Mexico, and the Caribbean.

===21st century===

In July 2000, Ghana Airways began service from BWI to Accra. The airline operated the flight with McDonnell Douglas DC-10s and sought to serve the many people of West African origin residing in the region.

Four years later, in July 2004, the U.S. federal government prohibited Ghana Airways from flying to the U.S. According to officials, the company was operating on an expired license and had disobeyed orders to stop flying an unsafe plane.

In 2005, to accommodate Southwest&#x27;s extensive presence at the airport, Concourses A and B were expanded, renovated, and integrated with one another to house all of that airline&#x27;s operations there for their major operating base. The new facility, designed by URS Corporation, opened on May 22, 2005. On October 1 of that year, the airport was renamed Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport, to honor former U.S. Supreme Court justice Thurgood Marshall, a native of Baltimore.

In June 2006, North American Airlines introduced a link to Accra via Banjul, The Gambia, marking the restoration of direct flights between Baltimore and Africa. The carrier employed Boeing 767s on the route. Afterward, it made the Accra flight nonstop and added a route to Lagos. North American ended all scheduled service in May 2008.

In 2008, &quot;Health&quot; magazine named BWI the second-healthiest airport in the United States. In 2009 the airport had a six percent increase in air travelers due to the proliferation of discount flights. In a 2009 survey of airport service quality by Airports Council International, BWI was the world&#x27;s top ranking airport in the 15-to-25-million-passenger category. BWI also ranked seventh, in medium-sized airports, based on customer satisfaction conducted by J.D. Power and Associates.

On August 5, 2014, the airport&#x27;s little-used runway, 04–22, was permanently closed. It was long and used primarily when the main runways needed to be closed for repairs. The last operation on the runway was a Southwest Airlines flight from Chicago Midway Airport, which arrived at 4:18 AM.

In 2015, Norwegian Air Shuttle announced it would begin flights from the airport to Guadeloupe and Martinique. In an interview with &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;, Norwegian Air Shuttle CEO Bjorn Kjos said, &quot;Baltimore is high on the list for long-haul destinations&quot;, hinting at further expansion into Europe. In mid-2018, however, the airline ceased all flights out of Baltimore, attributing the cessation to heavy financial losses.

In early 2016, a partnership between the airport and Towson University&#x27;s WTMD radio station was announced, including a new concert series that takes place at the terminal&#x27;s baggage claim on the lower level. Local bands included Wye Oak and others. The new series followed the release event of Animal Collective&#x27;s new album &quot;Painting With&quot; on November 25, 2015, where the new album was streamed throughout the airport.

In late 2018, construction began on a $60 million, five-gate expansion of terminal A for Southwest Airlines. The new expansion began operations in 2021. 2018 also marked a new annual record for passenger traffic at BWI Marshall Airport with over 27.1 million passengers.

In 2021, commuter airline Southern Airways Express ended its hub at BWI and switched its East Coast hub to Washington Dulles International Airport. In addition, the airport&#x27;s international growth continued with the addition of a twice-weekly flight by Air Senegal to Blaise Diagne International Airport in Dakar, Senegal, via a stop in Kennedy International Airport in Queens, New York City. However, in January 2023, Air Senegal ceased the New York City to Baltimore portion of this route, dropping Baltimore back down to only two year-round transatlantic flights. In 2022, Play Airlines began daily nonstop flights from Baltimore to Reykjavík, Iceland, which was quickly followed a few weeks later by Icelandair also resuming flights from BWI to Reykjavík.

On January 26, 2023, Copa Airlines announced they would start operating direct flights to Panama City, making it the first Central America-based airline to operate out of the airport. The flights began as scheduled in late June 2023.

In August 2024, Icelandair announced that they would be partnering with Southwest Airlines to better connect their customers, and that the initial North American gateway between the airlines would be BWI.

==== Renovations and expansion ====
In October 2022, a proposed renovation and expansion to BWI Airport was announced. It has been described as the &quot;largest capital project in the history of BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport&quot;. This project includes major upgrades to the airports&#x27; Baggage Handling System as well as a renovation and expansion to the airports&#x27; A/B Connector, which will provide passengers with a direct connection between concourses A and B.

The project (according to airport management as well as Clark Construction, the company hired for the project) is expected to &quot;transform the customer experience by adding a direct connection between concourses, expanding airline hold rooms, creating new food and retail concession spaces, enhancing restrooms, and introducing a new, fully in-line baggage handling system for Southwest.&quot; The project is estimated to cost $425 million and is expected to be fully completed in summer 2026.

==Facilities==
=== Runways ===

==== Current runways ====
BWI Airport covers of land and has three active runways:

* Runway 10/28: . Runway 28 is the main takeoff runway, unless wind conditions require takeoffs from Runway 15R. Runway 10 is equipped with ILS category IIIB, and runway 28 is equipped with ILS category I.
* Runway 15R/33L: : Runway 33L is the main landing runway, unless wind or fog conditions require landings on Runway 10 with its higher ILS rating. The Thomas A. Dixon Aircraft Observation Area at Friendship Park overlooks Runway 33L. Equipped with ILS category I in both directions.
* Runway 15L/33R: . Main runway for general aviation and smaller commercial aircraft. Originally , it was extended in the 1990s and is able to handle emergency landings by Boeing 737 aircraft, by far the most popular plane at the airport. Equipped with ILS category I in both directions.

==== Former runways ====
* Runway 4/22 (defunct): . Closed in 2014, this runway is now part of taxiways and aprons.

===Terminal===

Baltimore/Washington International Airport has five concourses with 78 gates. Of these, 14 are international (all 11 gates in Concourse E are international gates, five of E&#x27;s gates are arrival-only, and three gates in Concourse D are also international gates).

*Concourse A/B has 30 gates. Both are of exclusive use for Southwest.
*Concourse C has 14 gates. Used by Southwest, American and Contour.
*Concourse D has 23 gates. Used by all non-Southwest and American domestic flights.
*Concourse E has 11 gates. Used for all international flights 
*Cargo Concourse The airport&#x27;s cargo concourse covers a area. Its facilities include a cargo building in the Midfield Cargo Complex, including a 200,000 square feet warehouse used for Amazon Air, a foreign trade zone, a air cargo ramp, and ramp parking for 17 aircraft with direct nose-in access for eight freighters.

===Ground transportation===

BWI was ranked one of the &quot;Top 10 Easiest U.S. Airports to Get to&quot; by Aviation.com in 2007.

BWI is located at the southeast terminus of Interstate 195, a spur route providing connections to the Baltimore–Washington Parkway and Interstate 95. The airport has a variety of parking options, ranging from a garage within walking distance to the concourses to remote parking lots that require shuttles to access.

A light rail station, with service to downtown Baltimore and other locations via Baltimore Light RailLink, is located next to Concourse E.

Amtrak and MARC trains regularly serve the BWI Rail Station, located on airport grounds but about a mile from the terminal, with free shuttle bus service connecting the destinations. Trains on Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor, Acela, and MARC&#x27;s Penn Line stop at the station and proceed to destinations including Union Station in Washington, D.C. and Penn Station in Baltimore.

Local buses that stop at the airport terminal include the Maryland Transit Administration&#x27;s 75 route to Patapsco station on Light RailLink and Arundel Mills Mall, as well as route 201, which connects the airport to Shady Grove station on the Washington Metro.

Passenger van service to and from the Eastern Shore and Western Maryland is available through BayRunner Shuttle with services to and from BWI to Kent Island, Easton, Cambridge, Salisbury, Ocean Pines, and Ocean City (for the Eastern Shore) and Grantsville, Frostburg, Cumberland, Hancock, Hagerstown, and Frederick (for Western Maryland). There are also numerous private car, rental car, and cab services, as well as shuttles that go to and from BWI to local hotels; Baltimore and Washington and their suburbs; and Central and Western Maryland.

Some former ground transportation services have been discontinued, including bicycle-sharing system from the Boston-based company Zagster and the Washington Metro&#x27;s B30 bus, which was an express service to Greenbelt station.

===Other facilities===

In 1985, the BWI Business District was established as a way to formalize businesses and hotels operating adjacent to the airport. The district comprises two smaller districts located to the north (West Nursery Hotel District) and west (Stoney Run District) of the airport. Numerous traveler resources and employment centers are located within both districts, such as the BWI Rail Station and BWI Rental Car Facility in the Stoney Run District, and the BWI Business District Light Rail Station, the NSA Friendship Annex, and dozens of hotel facilities in the West Nursery District.

A U.S. Department of Homeland Security facility is located in the lower level of the main terminal, near the international arrivals area / Concourse E Baggage Claim. This facility also includes a Global Entry Enrollment Center, as well as a TSA PreCheck enrollment facility.

In the early 1990s, BWI Airport opened the Thomas A. Dixon Aircraft Observation Area at Friendship Park. The observation plaza features a playground and a terrace overlooking the southern approach to the airport&#x27;s 15R-33L runway. From this vantage point, several planes can be viewed simultaneously as they prepare for landing. The southern loop of the 13.3 mile BWI Trail travels through the park, providing cyclist and pedestrian access to the park.

In addition to the Thomas A. Dixon Aircraft Observation Area, which provides spotters with views of aircraft landing on runway 33L, spotters can use one of several parking garages to view arrivals to runway 15R, with some arrivals appearing to be below the spotter.

The Maryland Aviation Administration has its headquarters on the third floor of the terminal building.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On March 25, 1953, a USAF North American B-25 Mitchell, aircraft serial # 44–29864, crashed 3 miles SE of Glen Burnie, Maryland on approach to then Friendship Int&#x27;l Airport because of weather factors. All three occupants on board were killed. This was the first fatal accident at or near the airport since its opening in July 1950.
* On January 2, 1973, a Piedmont Airlines NAMC YS-11 (registration unknown) with 4 occupants on board was intended to be hijacked. One passenger remained on board after landing at BWI and demanded to be taken to Canada. A Roman Catholic cardinal and an FBI agent talked the individual into surrendering. There were no injuries or fatalities.
* On February 22, 1974, Samuel Byck entered BWI, shot and killed an aviation police officer and stormed onto Delta Air Lines Flight 523. He killed the first officer and severely wounded the captain. He intended to hijack the plane and crash it into the White House. A gunfight ensued, and Byck was mortally wounded by a police officer from outside the aircraft. Byck killed himself before police stormed the aircraft. The attempted hijacking was later portrayed in the 2004 film, &quot;The Assassination of Richard Nixon&quot;, with Sean Penn and Naomi Watts.
* On January 9, 1985, a Westinghouse Electric Corporation North American Sabreliner on short final nosed down into the displaced threshold of runway 33L, causing the aircraft to bounce and collapsing the landing gear after settling on the runway. Both occupants survived, but the aircraft was substantially damaged.
* On December 10, 1992, a Volpar Turboliner operated by Connie Kalitta Services crashed west of BWI in Elkridge due to a shift in cargo in the aircraft during final approach. The sole occupant, the pilot, was killed.
* On May 6, 2009, a World Airways DC-10-30 with registration N139WA operating as Flight 8535 from Leipzig, Germany for the Military Airlift Command experienced a hard landing at BWI. As a result of the captain&#x27;s response to the hard landing, the plane&#x27;s nose wheel struck the runway hard two times. The aircraft blew one of its front tires and had to execute a go-around before landing successfully. Several passengers were injured, including the first officer, who suffered back trauma. The age of the aircraft (29 years 11 months at the time of the accident) and the extent of damage to the front landing gear and fuselage resulted in the aircraft being written off. The aircraft was parted out and is now used on-site for fire/rescue training and practice purposes.
* On December 12, 2014, Southwest Airlines Flight 3118, a Boeing 737-700, encountered multiple bird strikes while on approach to BWI. There were no injuries to the 145 passengers and crew, but the aircraft was substantially damaged. There was damage to the 178 forward pressure bulkhead and left wing fixed leading edge main rib. The plane was repaired and placed back into service.
* On August 4, 2016, Southwest Airlines Flight 149, a Boeing 737-300 bound for Atlanta Int&#x27;l Airport, suffered a failure of the nose landing gear during pushback at BWI because of the tug operators excessive speed during pushback. The nose gear collapsed in a forward direction, causing severe damage to the gear structure, the nose gear wheel and crushing the forward bulkhead. There were no injuries among the 6 crew and 129 passengers but the aircraft, which was 23 years old at the time of the incident, was substantially damaged and written off.
* On February 7, 2020, a Mountain Air Cargo Cessna 208 Caravan, operating for FedEx, was conducting an instrument landing system (ILS) approach in night meteorological conditions to runway 10 at BWI. After landing safely, it was discovered the pilot struck four separate approach light towers as well as a localizer antenna, causing substantial damage to the plane&#x27;s empennage, right horizontal stabilizer, right wing strut, and front cargo pod. A piece of an approach light was also caught on the plane&#x27;s right landing gear. The aircraft was substantially damaged, but repaired and placed back into service.
* On September 14, 2024, a Piper PA-32 Cherokee Six crashed just off the departure end of runway 15L, the general aviation runway at BWI. The pilot and two passengers on board did not sustain any major injuries, but the aircraft did sustain substantial damage.

==In popular culture==
BWI has been a backdrop in six films, &quot;Goldfinger&quot; (1964), &quot;Broadcast News&quot; (1987), &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; (1991), &quot;Company Business&quot; (1991), &quot;Home for the Holidays&quot; (1995), and &quot;Twelve Monkeys&quot; (1995).

It was also featured in the reality TV series &quot;Airline&quot; (2004–2005), an episode of the TV series &quot;House of Cards&quot;, and the TV documentaries &quot;Honor Flight&quot; (2007) and &quot;Eatin&#x27; Crabs Chesapeake Style&quot; (2009).

<text>Hans Holbein the Elder ( , ; ; – 1524) was a German painter.

==Life==
Holbein was born in the free imperial city of Augsburg (Germany), and died in Issenheim, Alsace (now France). He belonged to a celebrated family of painters; his father was Michael Holbein; his brother was Sigmund Holbein (died 1540). He had two sons, both artists and printmakers: Ambrosius Holbein (c. 1494 – c. 1519) and Hans Holbein the Younger (c. 1497 – 1543), who both had their first painting lessons from their father.

The date of Holbein&#x27;s birth is unknown. His name appears in the Augsburg tax books in 1494, superseding that of his father. As early as 1493, Holbein had a following, and he worked that year at the abbey at Weingarten, creating the wings of an altarpiece representing Joachim&#x27;s Offering, the Nativity of the Virgin Mary&#x27;s Presentation in the Temple, and the Presentation of Christ. Today they hang in separate panels in the cathedral of Augsburg.
Holbein painted richly colored religious works. His later paintings show how he pioneered and led the transformation of German art from the (Late) International Gothic to the Renaissance style. In addition to the altar paintings that are his principal works, he also designed church windows and woodcuts. The surviving prints that can be attributed to him are few and a new one has recently been added to the group, an &quot;Annunciation to the Virgin&quot; in the collection of the Universitätbibliothek in Erlangen. He also made a number of portrait drawings that foreshadow the work of his famous son, Hans Holbein the Younger.

Holbein first appears at Augsburg, partnered with his brother Sigismund (who died in 1540 at Bern, Switzerland). Augsburg, at the time of Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, cultivated art with a Flemish style, and felt the influence of the schools of Bruges and Brussels, even though it was near Italy, with close commercial connections to Venice. Sigismund was also a painter, but Hans had the lead of the partnership and signed all the works they produced. 

In 1514 his sons left Augsburg and eventually both settled in Basel. After 1516 Holbein was declared a tax defaulter in Augsburg, which forced him to accept commissions abroad. He had worked in Alsace in 1509, and he seemed to have maintained some contacts there. At Issenheim in Alsace, where Matthias Grünewald was employed at the time, Holbein found patrons and was contracted to complete an altarpiece. His brother Sigismund and others sued him in Augsburg for unpaid debts. Pursued by Augsburg authorities, he fled Issenheim, abandoning his work and equipment, and went to Basel. He died two years later at an unknown location. After 1524 his name no longer appeared on the register of the Augsburg guild.

Holbein the Elder portrayed himself and his two sons in the left-hand panel of the 1504 altar-piece triptych the Basilica of St. Paul.

<text>Ambrosius Holbein (c. 1494 – c. 1519) was a German and later a Swiss artist in painting, drawing, and printmaking. He was the elder brother, by about three years, of Hans Holbein the Younger, but he appears to have died in his mid-twenties, leaving behind only a small body of work.

==Biography==
Like his younger brother, he was born in Augsburg (which today is in Bavaria, but then was a free imperial city), a center of art, culture, and trade at that time. His father Hans Holbein the Elder was a pioneer and leader in the transformation of German art from the Gothic to the Renaissance style. In his studio, both his sons, Ambrosius and Hans, received their first painting lessons as well as an introduction to the crafts of the goldsmith, jeweller, and printmaker.

The young Holbein, alongside his brother and his father, is pictured in the left-hand panel of Holbein the Elder&#x27;s 1504 altarpiece triptych the &quot;Basilica of St. Paul&quot;, which is displayed at the Staatsgalerie in Augsberg.

In 1515, Ambrosius is assumed to have lived in the Swiss town of Stein am Rhein, where he helped a painter from Schaffhausen named Thomas Schmid with the murals in the main hall of the St. George monastery. The next year saw Ambrosius, as well as his brother Hans, in Basel, where he initially worked as a journeyman in Hans Herbster&#x27;s studio. In 1517 he registered as a member of the Basel painters&#x27; guild, and on 6 June 1518 he was naturalized as a citizen of Basel. The goldsmith Jörg Schweiger, whom Holbein had portrayed before, was his guarantor. However, he disappears from records soon after and is assumed to have died around 1519. Franny Moyle writes, &quot;There is no record of Ambrosius&#x27;s death, but the abrupt cessation of his work in a year [1519] where so many were falling prey to sickness suggests that he either caught the disease that began with a headache, or the plague that came in its wake, and died. Another alternative is that his financial worries had pressed him into mercenary service ... though with the Italian Wars in momentary pause, this seems unlikely.&quot;

The &quot;Portrait of a Boy with Blond Hair&quot; and its companion, the &quot;Portrait of a Boy with Brown Hair&quot;, are among Ambrosius’ best works of this period. Both are now in the Basel Kunstmuseum.

Ambrosius Holbein ranks among the most important of Basel&#x27;s illustrators and prominent &quot;small format&quot; artists.

Also, Krannert Art Museum in Illinois has a painting labelled &quot;Portrait of girl&quot; by Ambrosius Holbein. The painting used to be a part of Austrian Imperial connection, and given the outfit of the young woman is an example of very early 16th century Spanish fashion, closely resembling tomb of Queen Juana I of Castille, it might be an unidentified portrait of her.

<doc id="48317" wikidata="Q25401" url="?curid=48317" title="Lagomorpha">
<text>The lagomorphs () are the members of the taxonomic order Lagomorpha, of which there are two living families: the Leporidae (rabbits and hares) and the Ochotonidae (pikas). There are 110 recent species of lagomorph, of which only 109 species in twelve genera are extant, including ten genera of rabbits (42 species); one genus of hare (33 species) and one genus of pika (34 species). The name of the order is derived from the Ancient Greek &quot;lagos&quot; (λαγώς, &quot;hare&quot;) + &quot;morphē&quot; (μορφή, &quot;form&quot;).

== Taxonomy and evolutionary history ==
Other names used for this order, now considered synonymous, include: &quot;Duplicidentata&quot; (Illiger, 1811); &quot;Leporida&quot; (Averianov, 1999); &quot;Neolagomorpha&quot; (Averianov, 1999); &quot;Ochotonida&quot; (Averianov, 1999); and &quot;Palarodentia&quot; (Haeckel, 1895; Lilian, 2016).

The evolutionary history of the lagomorphs is still not well understood. In the late 20th century, it was generally agreed that &quot;Eurymylus&quot;, which lived in eastern Asia and dates back to the late Paleocene or early Eocene, was an ancestor of the lagomorphs. Examination of the fossil evidence in the 21st century suggested that the lagomorphs may have instead descended from mimotonids, mammals present in Asia during the Paleogene with similar body size and dental structure to early European rabbits such as &quot;Megalagus turgidus&quot;, while &quot;Eurymylus&quot; was more closely related to rodents (although not a direct ancestor). The leporids first appeared in the late Eocene and rapidly spread throughout the Northern Hemisphere; they show a trend towards increasingly long hind limbs as the modern leaping gait developed. The pikas appeared somewhat later in the Oligocene of eastern Asia.

Lagomorphs were certainly more diverse in the past than in the present, with around 75 genera and over 230 species represented in the fossil record and many more species in a single biome. This is evidence that lagomorph lineages are declining.

A 2008 study suggests an Indian origin for the order, having possibly evolved in isolation when India was an island continent in the Paleocene.

== Characteristics ==
Lagomorphs are similar to other mammals in that they all have hair, four limbs (i.e., they are tetrapods), and mammary glands and are endotherms. Lagomorphs possess a moderately fused postorbital process to the cranium, unlike other small mammals. They differ in that they have a mixture of &quot;basal&quot; and &quot;derived&quot; physical traits.

=== Differences between lagomorphs and other mammals ===
Lagomorphs and rodents form the clade or grandorder Glires. Despite the evolutionary relationship between lagomorphs and rodents, the two orders have some major differences.

Lagomorphs have four incisors in the upper jaw (smaller peg teeth behind larger incisors), whereas rodents only have two. They are similar to rodents in that their incisors grow continuously, thus necessitating constant chewing on fibrous food to prevent the teeth from growing too long. In addition, all lagomorph teeth grow continuously, while for most rodents, only the incisors grow continuously. Lagomorph and rodent incisors are structured differently. Lagomorphs have more cheek teeth than rodents. Both have a large diastema.

Lagomorphs are almost strictly herbivorous, unlike rodents, many of which will eat both meat and vegetable matter. Lagomorphs have no paw pads; instead, the bottoms of their paws are entirely covered with fur, a trait they share with red pandas. Similar to the rodents, bats, and some mammalian insectivores, they have a smooth-surfaced cerebrum. Lagomorphs are unusual among terrestrial mammals in that the females are larger than males.

=== Differences between families of lagomorphs ===
Rabbits and hares move by jumping, pushing off with their strong hind legs and using their forelimbs to soften the impact on landing. Pikas lack certain skeletal modifications present in leporids, such as a highly arched skull, an upright posture of the head, strong hind limbs and pelvic girdle, and long limbs. Also, pikas have a short nasal region and entirely lack a supraorbital foramen, while leporids have prominent supraorbital foramina and nasal regions.

=== Pikas ===
Pikas, also known as conies, are entirely represented by the family Ochotonidae and are small mammals native to mountainous regions of western North America and Central Asia. They are mostly about long and have greyish-brown, silky fur, small rounded ears, and almost no tail. Their four legs are nearly equal in length. Some species live in scree, making their homes in the crevices between broken rocks, while others construct burrows in upland areas. The rock-dwelling species are typically long-lived and solitary, having one or two small litters each year contributing to stable populations. The burrowing species, in contrast, are short-lived, and have multiple large litters during the year. These species tend to have large swings in population size. The gestation period of the pika is around one month long, and the newborns are altricial (eyes and ears closed, no fur). The social behaviour of the two groups also differs: the rock dwellers aggressively maintain scent-marked territories, while the burrowers live in family groups, they interact vocally with each other and defend a mutual territory. Pikas are diurnal and are active early and late in the day during hot weather. They feed on all sorts of plant material. As they do not hibernate, they make &quot;haypiles&quot; of dried vegetation which they collect and carry back to their homes to store for use during winter.

=== Hares ===

Hares, members of genus &quot;Lepus&quot; of family Leporidae, are medium size mammals native to Europe, Asia, Africa, and North America. North American jackrabbits are actually hares. Species vary in size from in length and have long powerful back legs, and ears up to in length. Although usually greyish-brown, some species turn white in the winter. They are solitary animals. Newborns are precocial (eyes and ears open, fully furred). Several litters are born during the year in a form (a nest above ground, usually under a bush). They are preyed upon by large mammalian carnivores and birds of prey.

=== Rabbits ===

Rabbits, members of the Leporidae family (excluding &quot;Lepus&quot; (hares)) are generally much smaller than hares and include the rock hares and the hispid hare. They are native to Europe, parts of Africa, Central and Southern Asia, North America and much of South America. They inhabit both grassland and arid regions. They vary in size from and have long, powerful hind legs, shorter forelegs and a tiny tail. The colour is some shade of brown, buff or grey and there is one black species and two striped ones. Domestic rabbits come in a wider variety of colours. Newborn rabbits are altricial (eyes and ears closed, no fur). Although most species live in burrows, the cottontails and hispid hares have forms (nests above ground, usually under a bush). Most of the burrowing species are colonial, and feed together in small groups. Rabbits play an important part in the terrestrial food chain, eating a wide range of forbs, grasses, and herbs, and being part of the staple diet of many carnivorous species. Domestic rabbits can be litter box trained, and—assuming they are given sufficient room to run and a good diet—can live long lives as house pets.

== Distribution ==
Lagomorphs are widespread around the world and inhabit every continent except Antarctica. However, they are not found in most of the southern cone of South America, in the West Indies, Indonesia or Madagascar, nor on many islands. Although they are not native to Australia, humans have introduced them there and they have successfully colonized many parts of the country and caused disruption to native species.

== Biology ==
=== Digestion ===
Easily digestible food is processed in the gastrointestinal tract and expelled as regular feces. But in order to get nutrients out of hard to digest fiber, lagomorphs ferment fiber in the cecum (in the GI tract) and then expel the contents as cecotropes, which are reingested (cecotrophy). The cecotropes are then absorbed in the small intestine to utilize the nutrients.

Like rodents, they are not able to vomit.

=== Birth and early life ===
Many lagomorphs breed several times a year and produce large litters. This is particularly the case in species that live in underground, protective environments, such as burrows. The young of rabbits and pikas (called kits) are born after a short gestation period and the mother can become pregnant again almost immediately after giving birth. The mothers are able to leave these young safely and go off to feed, returning at intervals to feed them with their unusually rich milk. In some species, the mother only visits and feeds the litter once a day but the young grow rapidly and are usually weaned within a month. 

Hare young are called leverets. Adults have a strategy to prevent predators from tracking down their litter by following the adults&#x27; scent. They approach and depart from the nesting site in a series of immense bounds, sometimes moving at right angles to their previous direction. Each litter of hares have a small number of young and are born after a longer gestation period.

=== Sociality and safety ===
Many species of lagomorphs, particularly the rabbits and the pikas, are gregarious and live in colonies, whereas hares are generally solitary species, although many hares travel and forage in groups of two, three, or four. Many rabbits and pikas rely on their burrows as places of safety when danger threatens, but hares rely on their long legs, great speed and jinking gait to escape from predators.

<text>Columbia is a planned community in Howard County, Maryland, United States, consisting of 10 self-contained villages. With a population of 104,681 at the 2020 census, it is the second-most-populous community in Maryland, after Baltimore. Columbia, located between Baltimore and Washington, D.C., is part of the Baltimore metropolitan area and is tracked by the United States Census Bureau as a census-designated place. Columbia proper consists only of territory governed by the Columbia Association, a not-for-profit management company. The United States Postal Service also uses the name for other communities that predate Columbia, including Simpsonville and Atholton; the Census Bureau also counts part of Clarksville as Columbia.

Developer James Rouse founded Columbia in 1967, aiming to create a community that would avoid the inconveniences of then-current subdivision design; eliminate racial, religious and class segregation; and reduce leapfrog and spot zoning development.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
Before European colonization in the 1600s, the area that is now Columbia served as farming and hunting grounds for indigenous peoples including the Piscataway and Susquehannock peoples. Columbia was founded by James W. Rouse (1914–1996), a native of Easton, Maryland. In 1935, Rouse obtained a job in Baltimore with the Federal Housing Administration, a New Deal agency whose purpose was to promote home ownership and home construction. This position exposed Rouse to all phases of the housing industry. Later in the 1930s he co-founded a Baltimore mortgage banking business, the Moss-Rouse Company. In the 1950s his company, by then known as James W. Rouse and Company, branched out into developing shopping centers and malls. In 1957, Rouse formed Community Research and Development, Inc. (CRD) for the purpose of building, owning and operating shopping centers throughout the country. Community Research and Development, Inc., which was managed by James W. Rouse and Company, became a publicly traded company in 1961. In 1966, Community Research and Development, Inc. changed its name to The Rouse Company, after it had acquired James W. Rouse and Company in exchange for company stock.

By the early 1950s Rouse was also active in organizations whose goals were to combat blight and promote urban renewal. Along the way, he came to recognize the importance of comprehensive planning and action to address housing issues. A talented public speaker, Rouse&#x27;s speeches on housing matters attracted media attention. By the mid-1950s he was espousing his belief that in order to be successful, cities had to be places where people succeeded. In a 1959 speech he declared that the purpose of cities is for people, and that the objective of city planning should be to make a city into neighborhoods where men, women, and their families can live and work, and, most importantly, grow in character, personality, religious fulfillment, brotherhood, and the capacity for joyous living.

In the early 1960s, Rouse decided to develop a new model city. Rouse&#x27;s ideas about what a new model city should be like were informed by a number of factors, including his personal Christian faith as well as the goal for his company to earn a profit, influences that he did not consider to be incompatible with one another. After exploring possible new city locations near Atlanta, Georgia, and Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina, Rouse focused his attention between Baltimore and Washington, D.C., in Howard County, Maryland.

=== Howard County land acquisition ===
In April 1962, Mel Berman, a longtime Howard County resident who was also a member of the CRD&#x27;s Board of Directors, saw a sign on Cedar Lane in Howard County advertising for sale. Berman reported the option to the CRD and a decision was made to purchase the land. This was the first of 165 land purchases made by Rouse over the next year-and-a-half. In order to keep land costs low, Jack Jones, an attorney from Rouse&#x27;s firm of Piper Marbury, set up a grid system to secretly buy land through dummy corporations like the &quot;Alaska Iron Mines Company&quot;. Some of these straw purchasers included Columbia Industrial Development Corporation, 95-32 Corporation, 95-216 Corporation, Premble, Inc., Columbia Mall, Inc., Oakland Ridge Industrial Development Corporation, and Columbia Development Corporation. Robert Moxley&#x27;s firm Security Realty Company (now Security Development Group Inc), negotiated many of the land deals for Jones, becoming his best client. CRD accumulated , 10 percent of Howard County, from 140 separate owners. Rouse was turned down in financing from David Rockefeller, who had recently cancelled a planned Rouse &quot;Village&quot; concept called Pocantico Hills. The $19,122,622 acquisition was then funded by Rouse&#x27;s former employer Connecticut General Life Insurance in October 1962 at an average price of $1,500 per acre ($0.37/m2). The town center land of Oakland Manor was purchased from Isadore Guldesky who was turned down from building high-rises on the site by Rob Moxley&#x27;s brother, County Commissioner and land developer Norman E. Moxley. Sensing that he had a key property, he requested $5 million for his , signing an agreement by hand on a land plat. The competition between Rouse and Guldesky carried over to the competing Tysons Corner Center and Tysons Galleria projects, with each hiring their competitor&#x27;s employees.

By late 1962, citizens had elected an all-Republican three-member council. J. Hubert Black, Charles E. Miller, and David W. Force who campaigned on a low-density growth ballot, but later approved the Columbia project. The Howard County Planning Commission Chairman Wilmer Sanner declared, &quot;if this adds to the orderly development of the county, that&#x27;s what we are looking for.&quot; That July, Sanner sold the majority of his Simpsonville farm to Howard Research prior to the public announcement. In October 1963, the acquisition was revealed to the residents of Howard County, putting to rest rumors about the mysterious purchases. These had included theories that the site was to become a medical research laboratory or a giant compost heap. Despite the moniker of being a &quot;planned city&quot;, the planning for the city occupied Rouse officials for most of 1964 after the announcement while marketing director Scott Ditch was brought from Baltimore&#x27;s Cross Keys development to promote the project to community groups. 
In December 1964 the zoning was rejected by planning director Tom Harris Jr. for handing nearly all planning control to the developer. A media push was instituted to approve the zoning by Dorris Thompson of &quot;The Howard County Times&quot;, Seymour Barondes of the Howard County Civic Association, and Anita Iribe of the League of Women Voters. In June 1965 zoning was approved for the project, and Howard Research and Development entered into a $37.5 million construction deed backed by the property. Development was temporarily stalled in October 1965 when James and Anna Hepding of Simpsonville sued the planning board, stating New Town zoning was a form of spot zoning benefiting a sole property owner. The case was dropped when developer Homer Gudelsky purchased the estate. Ten years later, former Councilman Charles E. Miller stated that if he could do it over again, he wouldn&#x27;t have voted to approve Columbia. He felt exploited and felt the subsidized housing would become a problem for the rest of the county. Miller had been defeated in the November 1974 Howard County Council elections, in part as a result of the changed political landscape that Columbia&#x27;s development brought. In early 1976, a &quot;Columbia Flier&quot; editorial charged that Miller was a fear-mongering reactionary who had a personal vendetta against Columbia, Rouse and Columbia residents.

=== Unveiling and growth ===

At the unveiling on June 21, 1967, James Rouse described Columbia as a planned new city which would avoid the leap-frog and spot-zoning development threatening the county. The new city would be complete with jobs, schools, shopping, and medical services, and a range of housing choices. Property taxes from commercial development would cover the additional services with which housing would burden the county. The urban planning process for Columbia included not only planners, but also a convened panel of nationally recognized experts in the social sciences, known as the Work Group. The fourteen member group of men and one woman, Antonia Handler Chayes, met for two days, twice a month, for half a year starting in 1963. The Work Group suggested innovations for planners in education, recreation, religion, and health care, as well as ways of improving social interactions. Columbia&#x27;s open classrooms, interfaith centers, and the then-novel idea of a health maintenance organization (HMO) with a group practice of medical doctors (the Columbia Medical Plan) sprung from these meetings. The community&#x27;s physical plan, with neighborhood and village centers, was also decided. Columbia&#x27;s &quot;New Town District&quot; zoning ordinance gave developers great flexibility about what to put where, without requiring county approval for each specific project.
In 1968, vice-presidential candidate Spiro Agnew referenced Columbia to reporters, saying, &quot;Government should act as a catalyst to encourage the local governments to encourage industry and business to move next to a planned community,&quot; and &quot;I want to lessen the density in the ghettos, and concurrently rebuild the ghetto areas.&quot; In 1969, County Executive Omar J. Jones felt that the increase in tax base was lagging behind the need for infrastructure as the operating budget doubled to $15 million in three years. Crime rates shot up around the county by 30–50% a year, with hot spots around the development. By 1970, the project required additional financing to continue, borrowing $30 million from Connecticut General, Manufacturers Hanover Trust, and Morgan Guaranty. In 1972, amendments to New Town zoning proposing to place a maximum height for buildings and maintain the original density limit of 2.2 units per acre were opposed by Rouse allies including the Columbia Association, the Ellicott City Businessman&#x27;s Association and the Columbia Democratic Club. By 1974, the amount owed reached $100,000 million, prompting partner Connecticut General to consider bankruptcy. An effort to create a special taxing district in 1978 and an effort to incorporate with a mayor in 1979 failed. In 1985 Cigna (Connecticut General) divested itself of the project for $120 million. By 1990 Howard Research and Development owed $125,162,689. In 2004 the project was sold to General Growth Properties, which went bankrupt in 2008. General Growth Properties submitted a plan for increasing density throughout Columbia in 2004 which was unanimously voted down. Ownership of the project fell to the previous Rouse subsidiary the Howard Hughes Corporation. Howard Hughes submitted a new plan to increase density in 2010 under the Ulman administration that passed unanimously.

Columbia has never incorporated; some governance, however, is provided by the non-profit Columbia Association, which manages common areas and functions as a homeowner association with regard to private property. The first boards were filled entirely with Rouse Company appointees. The first manager of the Columbia Association was John Estabrook Slayton (d. 1967). For Slayton&#x27;s contributions to the early planning of Columbia, the community center in the Wilde Lake village, Slayton House, was named for him. Wilde Lake was the first village area to be developed in Columbia; accordingly, the town&#x27;s first high school was Wilde Lake High School, which opened in 1971 as a &quot;model school for the nation&quot;. Constructed in the open classroom style, it was razed in 1994 and reconstructed on the same site, reopening in 1996.

=== Master plan ===
To achieve the goals set forth by the Work Group, Columbia&#x27;s Master Plan called for a series of ten self-contained villages, around which day-to-day life would revolve. The centerpiece of Columbia would be The Mall in Columbia and man-made Lake Kittamaqundi.

==== Villages and neighborhoods ====

The village concept aimed to provide Columbia a small-town feel (like Easton, Maryland, where James Rouse grew up). Each village comprises several neighborhoods. The village center may contain middle and high schools. All villages have a shopping center, recreational facilities, a community center, a system of bike/walking paths, and homes. Four of the villages have interfaith centers, common worship facilities which are owned and jointly operated by a variety of religious congregations working together.

Most of Columbia&#x27;s neighborhoods contain single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and apartments, though some are more exclusive than others. The original plan, following the neighborhood concept of Clarence Perry, would have had all the children of a neighborhood attend the same school, melding neighborhoods into a community and ensuring that all of Columbia&#x27;s children get the same high-quality education. Rouse marketed the city as being &quot;color blind&quot; as a proponent of Senator Clark&#x27;s fair housing legislation. If a neighborhood was filled with too many purchasers of a single race, houses would be blocked until the desired ratio was met.
* Village – Neighborhoods (in order of residential opening)

Columbia takes its street names from famous works of art and literature: for example, the neighborhood of Hobbit&#x27;s Glen takes its street names from the work of J. R. R. Tolkien; Running Brook, from the poetry of Robert Frost; and Clemens Crossing, from the work of Mark Twain. The book &quot;Oh, You Must Live in Columbia!&quot; chronicles the artistic, poetic, and historical origins of the street and place names in Columbia.

=== Further expansion ===
&quot;The Downtown Columbia Plan&quot; is a 2010 amendment to the county&#x27;s General Plan of expansion. It is a framework for the revitalization of Downtown Columbia over the next thirty years. Development plans for downtown projects in the years ahead will include details for that project such as neighborhood design guidelines, environmental restoration, public amenities and infrastructure. These development plans must adhere to the framework of the Downtown Columbia Plan as required by the zoning legislation. Over the life of the Downtown Columbia development project, as much as 13 million square feet of retail, commercial, residential, hotel and cultural development is planned.

To be accomplished in three phases, the plan calls for the formation of the non-profit Columbia Downtown Housing Corporation to build an additional 5,500 units of low income housing placed downtown in exchange for increased zoning density for other projects. Additional development includes 4.3 million square feet of commercial office space, 1.25 million square feet of retail space, 640 hotel rooms, Merriweather Post Pavilion redevelopment and a multi-modal transportation system.

Columbia&#x27;s master developer, the Howard Hughes Corporation, is heading up the expansion project. The project is projected to cost $90 million and will outline development in the community for the next 40 years.

== Geography ==

Because Columbia is unincorporated, there is confusion over its exact boundaries. In the strictest definition, Columbia comprises only the land governed under covenants by the Columbia Association. This is a considerably smaller area than the census-designated place (CDP) as defined by the United States Census Bureau. The CDP has a total area of , of which are land and , or 0.80%, are water. The CDP includes a number of older communities which do not lie within the CA&#x27;s purview, including the Holiday Hills, Diamondback, and Allview subdivisions and the former town of Simpsonville, as well as some land on the east side of Clarksville. These areas are not part of the &quot;new town&quot;, and are not directly served by its amenities. Some of these areas are included in Columbia ZIP codes by the post office, and some are not.

Columbia is located in central Maryland, southwest of Baltimore, northeast of Washington, D.C., and northwest of Annapolis. The community lies in the Piedmont region of Maryland, with its eastern edge at the fall line. The climate tends to hot, humid summers and cool to cold and wet winters. There are occasional large amounts of snowfall that happen every year.

The primary landforms in Columbia are rolling hills and stream valleys; Columbia&#x27;s road network is laid out to follow the terrain, with many winding streets and cul-de-sacs. Elevations range from about above sea level. Most of Columbia is drained by the Middle Patuxent and Little Patuxent rivers. There are three artificial lakes, created by damming of tributary streams during community construction. In 1965, the Rouse Company leased of farmland staged for development, and earmarked of oak forest for timber harvesting. The company developed a sapling planter to replant sections of cleared land that would use Columbia&#x27;s W.R. Grace-developed fertilizers. An outer ring of greenspace was abandoned early in the project because the combination with the already required river buffers would have reduced profitable land available for building. Along with Symphony Woods, many other stands of mature trees have been temporarily maintained in Columbia, including the large Middle Patuxent Environmental Area in the western part of the community between Harper&#x27;s Choice and River Hill villages, protecting much of the river valley from development.

=== Climate ===
Columbia has a humid subtropical climate, with cool winters and hot, muggy summers.

== Demographics ==
=== 2020 census ===
=== 2010 census ===
The 2009-2013 census estimates report the median income for a household in the CDP was $99,877. The per capita income for the CDP was $46,374. About 4.1% of families and 6.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including 8.8% of those under age 18 and 6.4% of those age 65 or over.

=== 2000 census ===
As of the census of 2000, there were 88,254 people, 34,199 households, and 23,118 families residing in the CDP. The population density was . There were 35,281 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the CDP was 66.52% White, 21.47% Black or African American, 0.26% Native American, 7.30% Asian, 0.05% Pacific Islander, 1.63% from other races, and 2.76% from two or more races. 4.12% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race. 14% of Columbia&#x27;s residents were German, 11% Irish, 10% English, 5% Italian, 4% Polish, 2% Russian, 2% Scottish, 2% Indian, 2% Chinese, 2% Korean, 2% Sub-Saharan African, 2% French, and 2% West Indian.

There were 34,199 households, out of which 35.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 53.4% were married couples living together, 11.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 32.4% were non-families. 25.6% of all households were made up of individuals, and 5.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.54 and the average family size was 3.09.

In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 26.3% under the age of 18, 6.7% from 18 to 24, 34.1% from 25 to 44, 25.5% from 45 to 64, and 7.5% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 36 years. For every 100 females, there were 93.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 88.7 males.

== Economy ==
James Rouse conceived of a city, not a suburban bedroom community, and a large area on the eastern edge was allocated for industrial purposes. The centerpiece of this aspect of the development was a General Electric appliance plant on a site previously operated as a cattle farm. After an injunction attempt was blocked in 1969, the plant began operations in 1972, peaking at 2,300 of the predicted 12,000 jobs. It was closed in 1990, with all but of the property being sold back to Howard Research and Development. One section of the property was subsequently redeveloped for big box retail; the remainder became the large Gateway Commerce office complex, still being expanded. In 1968, Bendix Field Engineering moved to a new facility on the historic Woodlawn Plantation where it was used for engineering activity. Howard County purchased the vacant facility creating the Maryland Center for Entrepreneurship in 2011, which relocated to the vacant Patuxent Publishing building in 2014. There is still a smaller industrial area to the south of this, but by and large East Columbia is dominated by commercial real estate—office, retail, and wholesale—in contrast to the original plan, which saw the Town Center area as the commercial center of Columbia.

The U.S. federal government is the source of many jobs for Columbians. Several large U.S. Department of Defense installations and R&amp;D facilities surround Columbia, the largest being the National Security Agency at Fort George G. Meade, and the Applied Physics Laboratory south of Columbia, both pre-dating the establishment of Columbia. Companies which have had research facilities in the area include W.R. Grace and Company. Further afield, many Columbians commute to government and government contractor jobs in the Baltimore and Washington, D.C. area.

Companies based in Columbia include W.R. Grace and Company, Sourcefire, PetMeds, MICROS Systems, Martek Biosciences, Integral Systems, GP Strategies Corporation, Corporate Office Properties Trust, and the consumer research company Nielsen Audio (formerly Arbitron). When MaggieMoo&#x27;s was an independent company, its headquarters was in Columbia.

=== Shopping ===
The Mall in Columbia, located in Town Center, is a large regional shopping mall with three anchor department stores, a multiplex movie theater, and more than 200 stores and restaurants.

There are several other major competing shopping centers in East Columbia, including Dobbin Center strip mall opened in 1983, Snowden Square big box retail on the remainder of the GE industrial site, Columbia Crossing I and II big box retail started in 1997, and Gateway Overlook.

Columbia&#x27;s nine &quot;village centers&quot; provide residents with nearby shopping as well, often including supermarkets, filling stations, liquor stores, dry cleaners, restaurants, and hair salons. The village centers are laid out so that individual stores are not visible from the road, unlike traditional strip malls. The arrangement is criticized because it makes it difficult for newcomers and non-residents to know what shopping is available; it is praised for eliminating much of the garishness of roadside America.

The village centers have evolved over time. Oakland Mills Village Center in Oakland Mills had a traditional layout—stores located off a central corridor—until its demolition in the late 1990s. The Rouse Company abandoned the village center concept in 2002, selling off the assets to Kimco Realty for $120 million. The Kings Contrivance Village Center in Kings Contrivance underwent major construction in 2007 and 2008 when a new supermarket was added to the center, but maintained the original character of stores around a central corridor and plaza. Owen Brown village center is now managed by GFS Realty, and the Long Reach Village center was declared blighted and purchased by Howard County for resale in 2014.

== Arts and culture ==
=== Entertainment and performing arts ===
Merriweather Post Pavilion, a well-known outdoor concert venue, attracts many prominent performers. In addition, there are several performing arts organizations that present professional theater, including Toby&#x27;s Dinner Theatre, Columbia Center for Theatrical Arts and the Young Columbians which have produced the area premieres of several musicals.

Columbia also offers chamber music concerts, children&#x27;s programs, community outreach programs, master classes, and pre-concert lectures and discussions through the Candlelight Concert Society, a non-profit organization formed by Columbia residents to provide chamber music concerts since 1972.

=== Howard County Library System ===
Howard County Library System (HCLS) is consistently top rated among the nation&#x27;s public library systems according to Hennen&#x27;s American Public Library Ratings (HAPLR). Two of the six branches of the Howard County Library System are in Columbia, including the Central Branch in Town Center and the East Columbia Branch in Owen Brown.

=== Historic sites ===
There are four historic National Register of Historic Places sites in Columbia: Christ Church Guilford, Dorsey Hall, Woodlawn, and the Oakland Mills Blacksmith House and Shop. Most historic buildings, mills and plantations within Columbia that qualified for the register, such as Oakland Manor, were not submitted by Rouse company affiliates.

=== Religion ===
Rouse, a devout Episcopalian, commissioned a study concerning how places of worship would be integrated into plans for the new town. Dr. Stanley Hallet advised this 1964 work group to economically abandon &quot;The extravagance of church life&quot; in favor of ecumenical establishments that focused resources on retreat centers and non-profit religious corporations. The Rouse Company discouraged individual congregations from purchasing land from the company. In 1966, the Columbia Religious Facilities Corporation was founded to lease interfaith centers to congregations. On June 22, 1969, $2.5 million in church donations applied to the CFRC to purchase Columbia land and build an interfaith facility in the village of Wilde Lake. The organization formed the Interfaith Housing Corporation (now the Columbia Housing Corporation) to purchase 300 units of low and moderate income housing in the development with Federal Housing Authority funding. 

== Parks and recreation ==
Columbia has numerous recreation centers. The homeowners association, the Columbia Association, known to many in Howard County as &quot;CA&quot;, builds, operates and maintains most of these facilities. CA operates a variety of recreational facilities, including 23 outdoor swimming pools, five indoor pools, two water slides, ice and roller skating rinks, an equestrian center, a sports park with miniature golf, a skateboard park, batting cages, picnic pavilions, clubhouse and playground, three athletic clubs, numerous indoor and outdoor tennis, basketball, volleyball, squash, pickleball, and racquetball courts, and running tracks.

There are three lakes (Lake Kittamaqundi, Lake Elkhorn, and Wilde Lake) surrounded by parkland for sailing, fishing, and boating; of paths for jogging, strolling and biking; and 148 tot lots and play areas.

Nine village centers, 15 neighborhood centers, and four senior centers provide space for a large variety of community activities. There are a variety of fairs and celebrations throughout the year, including entertainment on the lakefront of Lake Kittamaqundi during the summer and the Columbia Festival of the Arts.

Columbia also has garden plots for rent, under the guidance of the Columbia Gardeners, which has been in existence since the 1970s. There are about 350 garden plots at three sites in Columbia.

Chiara D&#x27;Amore&#x27;s Community Ecology Institute&#x27;s Freetown Farm, founded in 2016, uses hands-on gardening to educate people and cultivates communities where people thrive together. Freetown farm was built on the site of Columbia&#x27;s last working farm. The name &quot;Freetown farm&quot; refers to the area&#x27;s historical name and its ties to the Underground Railroad. It features an NAACP garden and donates much of the food that is raise to local food banks.

== Education ==

Columbia&#x27;s public schools are operated by the Howard County Public School System. As of the 2007–2008 school year, the following high schools served some part of Columbia:
*Atholton
*Centennial
*Hammond
*Howard
*Long Reach
*Oakland Mills
*River Hill
*Wilde Lake

Most of these schools also serve students from outside Columbia, as is also the case with some of the middle and elementary schools.

=== Colleges and universities ===
There are no conventional four-year colleges or universities in Columbia, but several college-level programs have facilities there. Howard Community College is located near the town center, while the University of Phoenix, Lincoln College of Technology, Loyola University Maryland, University of Maryland, Baltimore County, Maryland University of Integrative Health, and Johns Hopkins University have facilities on the east side of town at Columbia Gateway Business Park. In addition to its original campus in Columbia, HCC also has satellite campuses in Mount Airy, Laurel, and East Columbia, in the Columbia Gateway Business Park.

== Infrastructure ==
=== Transportation ===
==== Public transit ====
Columbia&#x27;s initial plan called for a minibus system connecting the village centers on a distinct right-of-way that allowed denser development along the route. The routes were not constructed, though minibuses were operated by the Columbia Association under the name &quot;ColumBus&quot;. These were eventually taken over by Howard County. Six Howard Transit bus routes served Columbia and connected it with its neighboring areas (such as Ellicott City and the BWI Airport) until they were replaced by Regional Transportation Agency of Central Maryland (RTA) in 2014. Several Maryland Transit Administration (MTA) routes provide access to and from both Washington and Baltimore; MTA weekday commuter bus service connects Columbia to the Washington Metro system. There are no rail stations within Columbia, although the Dorsey MARC Train station is served by RTA buses.

==== Roads ====

Columbia has a number of roadways that serve the community (see below). All of these highways allow Columbia access to nearby Baltimore, Washington, D.C. and Annapolis.
*U.S. Route 29 Columbia Pike, runs north–south connecting Columbia to Ellicott City and Washington, D.C.
*Interstate 95, runs north–south connecting Columbia to Baltimore and Washington, D.C.
*MD 32 Patuxent Freeway, runs east–west connecting Columbia to Sykesville and Annapolis.
*MD 100 Paul T. Pitcher Memorial Highway, runs east from U.S. Route 29 connecting Columbia to Glen Burnie.
*MD 175 Rouse Parkway, a central artery that runs east–west from the Town Center to Jessup.
*MD 108 Clarksville Pike-Waterloo Road, forms the northern boundary of the community by running east–west from Clarksville to Ellicott City.

=== Healthcare ===
Medical care is available at Howard County General Hospital, affiliated with Baltimore&#x27;s Johns Hopkins Hospital. The Columbia Medical Plan was founded in 1967 as a health maintenance organization (HMO) available to citizens of Columbia. In more recent years, however, this plan has divided into separate medical groups that simply share the Twin Knolls buildings. Today, there is a Kaiser Permanente facility located in the Columbia Gateway industrial park. There are also a number of clinics, such as the Righttime Medical Care center and Patient First.

== In popular culture ==
Columbia is mentioned in the novel, &quot;Butchers Hill&quot;, by Laura Lippman. The novel is largely set in Baltimore City and describes Columbia as a utopian experiment with huge homes and affluent residents. The residents are portrayed as racially homogeneous and largely white. The novel was written in 1998 and Lippman herself lived in Columbia in the 1970s.

== Sister cities ==
Columbia is a sister city to Cergy-Pontoise, France, Tres Cantos, Spain, Tema, Ghana, Cap-Haïtien, Haiti, and Liyang, China. The Columbia Association International and Multicultural Programs Advisory Committee organizes a summer exchange program for French and Spanish students enrolled in Howard County Public Schools. In 2013, CA announced its new sister city relationship with Tema, a port city in Ghana. The occasion was marked with a Ghana Fest on November 17, 2013, and the official agreement was signed in 2014. In 2016, Cap-Haïtien, Haiti became a sister city followed by Liyang, China in 2018.

<text>Andrew Marvell (; 31 March 1621 – 16 August 1678) was an English metaphysical poet, satirist and politician who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1659 and 1678. During the Commonwealth period he was a colleague and friend of John Milton. His poems range from the love-song &quot;To His Coy Mistress&quot;, to evocations of an aristocratic country house and garden in &quot;Upon Appleton House&quot; and &quot;The Garden&quot;, the political address &quot;An Horatian Ode upon Cromwell&#x27;s Return from Ireland&quot;, and the later personal and political satires &quot;Flecknoe&quot; and &quot;The Character of Holland&quot;.

==Early life==

Marvell was born in Winestead, East Riding of Yorkshire on 31 March 1621. He was the son of a Church of England clergyman also named Andrew Marvell. The family moved to Hull when his father was appointed Lecturer at Holy Trinity Church, and Marvell was educated at Hull Grammar School.
Aged 13, Marvell attended Trinity College, Cambridge and eventually received a BA degree. A portrait of Marvell, attributed to Godfrey Kneller, hangs in Trinity College&#x27;s collection.

From the middle of 1642 onwards, Marvell probably travelled in continental Europe. He may well have served as a tutor for an aristocrat on the Grand Tour, but the facts are not clear on this point. While England was embroiled in the civil war, Marvell seems to have remained on the continent until 1647. During his visit to Rome in 1645, he probably met the Villiers brothers, Lord Francis and the 2nd Duke of Buckingham, as well as Richard Flecknoe. He later wrote a satirical poem about Flecknoe. His travel route is unclear, except that Milton later reported that Marvell had mastered four languages, including French, Italian and Spanish.

==First poems and Marvell&#x27;s time at Nun Appleton==
Marvell&#x27;s first poems, which were written in Latin and Greek and published when he was still at Cambridge, lamented a visitation of the plague and celebrated the birth of a child to King Charles I and Queen Henrietta Maria. He belatedly became sympathetic to the successive regimes during the Interregnum after Charles I&#x27;s execution on 30 January 1649. His &quot;Horatian Ode&quot;, a political poem dated to 1650, responds with sadness to the regicide, despite the overall praise towards Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s return from Ireland.

Circa 1650–52, Marvell served as tutor to the daughter, Marry, of Lord General Fairfax Thomas Fairfax, who had recently relinquished command of the Parliamentary army to Cromwell. During this period, Marvell lived at Nun Appleton Hall, near York, where he continued to write poetry. One poem, &quot;Upon Appleton House, To My Lord Fairfax&quot;, uses a description of the estate as a way of exploring Fairfax&#x27;s and Marvell&#x27;s own social situation in a time of war and political change. Probably the best-known poem he wrote at this time is &quot;To His Coy Mistress&quot;.

==Anglo-Dutch War and employment as Latin secretary==
During the period of increasing tensions leading up to the First Anglo-Dutch War of 1652, Marvell wrote the satirical &quot;Character of Holland&quot;. It repeated the contemporary stereotype of the Dutch as &quot;drunken and profane&quot;: &quot;This indigested vomit of the Sea,/ Fell to the Dutch by Just Propriety.&quot;

He became a tutor to Cromwell&#x27;s ward, William Dutton, in 1653, and moved to live with his pupil at John Oxenbridge&#x27;s house in Eton. Oxenbridge previously made two trips to Bermuda, this most-likely inspired Marvell to write his poem &quot;Bermudas&quot;. He also wrote several poems praising Cromwell, who was Lord Protector of England at that point. In 1656 Marvell and Dutton travelled to France, to visit the Protestant Academy of Saumur.

In 1657, Marvell joined Milton (who was now blind) in service as Latin secretary to Cromwell&#x27;s Council of State at a salary of £200 a year. This was enough for decent financial security. Oliver Cromwell died in 1658 and was succeeded as Lord Protector by his son Richard. In 1659 Marvell was elected Member of Parliament for Kingston upon Hull in the Third Protectorate Parliament. He was paid a rate of 6 shillings, 8 pence per day during sittings of parliament, a financial support derived from the contributions of his constituency. He was re-elected MP for Hull in 1660 for the Convention Parliament.

==After the Restoration==

The monarchy was restored in England in 1660 with Charles II as king. Marvell avoided punishment for his own co-operation with Cromwell and republicanism more broadly. Furthermore, he helped to convince the King not to execute John Milton for his anti-monarchical writings and revolutionary activities. The closeness of the relationship between the two former colleagues is indicated by the fact that Marvell contributed an eloquent prefatory poem, entitled &quot;On Mr. Milton&#x27;s Paradise Lost&quot;, to the second edition of Milton&#x27;s epic &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;. According to a biographer: &quot;Skilled in the arts of self-preservation, he was not a toady.&quot;

In 1661 Marvell was re-elected MP for Hull in the Cavalier Parliament. He eventually came to write several long and bitterly satirical verses against the corruption of the court. This work was mostly circulated in less public manuscript form, however some was anonymously published in print. The verses were too politically sensitive and too dangerous to be published under his name until well after the writer&#x27;s death. Marvell took up opposition to the &#x27;court party&#x27;, and satirised them as his main target. In his longest verse of satire, &quot;Last Instructions to a Painter&quot;, written in 1667, Marvell responded to the political corruption that had contributed to English failures during the Second Anglo-Dutch War. The poem was only published in print after the Revolution of 1688–9. The poem instructs an imaginary painter on how to portray the state without a proper navy to defend them. The state is led by men without intelligence or courage, a corrupt and dissolute court, and dishonest officials. Of another such satire, Samuel Pepys, himself a government official, commented in his diary, &quot;Here I met with a fourth Advice to a Painter upon the coming in of the Dutch and the End of the War, that made my heart ake to read, it being too sharp and so true.&quot;

From 1659 until his death in 1678, Marvell served as London agent for the Hull Trinity House shipmasters&#x27; guild. He went on two missions to the continent; one to the Dutch Republic, and the other encompassing Russia, Sweden, and Denmark. He spent some time living in a cottage on Highgate Hill in north London. His stay there is now recorded by a bronze plaque that bears the following inscription:Four feet below this spot is the stone step, formerly the entrance to the cottage in which lived Andrew Marvell, poet, wit, and satirist; colleague with John Milton in the foreign or Latin secretaryship during the Commonwealth; and for about twenty years M.P. for Hull. Born at Winestead, Yorkshire, 31st March, 1621, died in London, 18th August, 1678, and buried in the church of St. Giles-in-the-Fields. This memorial is placed here by the London County Council, December, 1898. A floral sundial in the nearby Lauderdale House bears an inscription quoting lines from his poem &quot;The Garden&quot;.

Andrew Marvell died suddenly in 1678, while attending a popular meeting of his old constituents at Hull. His health had been remarkably good; and some people theorised of his poisoning by his political or clerical enemies. This is unproven. Marvell was buried in the church of St Giles in the Fields in central London. His monument, erected by a very grateful constituency, bears the following inscription:Near this place lyeth the body of Andrew Marvell, Esq., a man so endowed by Nature, so improved by Education, Study, and Travel, so consummated by Experience, that, joining the peculiar graces of Wit and Learning, with a singular penetration and strength of judgment; and exercising all these in the whole course of his life, with an unutterable steadiness in the ways of Virtue, he became the ornament and example of his age, beloved by good men, feared by bad, admired by all, though imitated by few; and scarce paralleled by any. But a Tombstone can neither contain his character, nor is Marble necessary to transmit it to posterity; it is engraved in the minds of this generation, and will be always legible in his inimitable writings, nevertheless. He having served twenty years successfully in Parliament, and that with such Wisdom, Dexterity, and Courage, as becomes a true Patriot, the town of Kingston-upon-Hull, from whence he was deputed to that Assembly, lamenting in his death the public loss, have erected this Monument of their Grief and their Gratitude, 1688.

==Prose ==
Marvell also wrote anonymous prose satires: criticizing the monarchy and Roman Catholicism, defending Puritan dissenters, and denouncing censorship.

&quot;The Rehearsal Transpros&#x27;d&quot;, an attack on Samuel Parker, was published in two parts in 1672 and 1673.

&quot;Mr. Smirke; or The Divine in Mode&quot;, (1676) criticised Church of England intolerance, and was published together with a &quot;Short Historical Essay, concerning General Councils, Creeds, and Impositions, in matters of Religion.&quot;

Marvell&#x27;s pamphlet &quot;An Account of the Growth of Popery and Arbitrary Government in England&quot;, published in late 1677, alleged that: &quot;There has now for diverse Years, a design been carried on, to change the Lawfull Government of &quot;England&quot; into an Absolute Tyranny, and to convert the established Protestant Religion into down-right Popery&quot;. John Kenyon described it as &quot;one of the most influential pamphlets of the decade&quot; and G. M. Trevelyan called it: &quot;A fine pamphlet, which throws light on causes provocative of the formation of the Whig party&quot;.

A 1678 work published anonymously (&quot;by a Protestant&quot;) in defense of John Howe against the attack of his fellow-dissenter, the severe Calvinist Thomas Danson, is also probably by Marvell. Its full title is &quot;Remarks upon a late disingenuous discourse, writ by one T.D. under the pretence de causa Dei, and of answering Mr. John Howe&#x27;s letter and postscript of God&#x27;s prescience, &amp;c., affirming, as the Protestant doctrine, that God doth by efficacious influence universally move and determine men to all their actions, even to those that are most wicked&quot;.

==Views==
Although Marvell became a Parliamentarian and was opposed to episcopacy, he was not a Puritan. Later in life especially, he seems to have been a conforming Anglican. Marvell positively identifies himself as &quot;a Protestant&quot; in pamphlets. He had flirted briefly with Catholicism as a youth, and was described in his thirties (on the Saumur visit) as &quot;a notable English Italo-Machiavellian&quot;.

His strong Biblical influence is clear in poems such as &quot;The Garden&quot;, the &quot;Coronet&quot; and &quot;The Bermudas&quot;.

Vincent Palmieri noted that Marvell is sometimes known as the &quot;British Aristides&quot; for his incorruptible integrity in life and poverty at death. Many of his poems were not published until 1681, three years after his death, from a collection owned by Mary Palmer, his housekeeper. After Marvell&#x27;s death she laid dubious claim to having been his wife, from the time of a secret marriage in 1667.

==Marvell&#x27;s poetic style==
Marvell is said to have adhered to the established stylized forms of his contemporary neoclassical tradition. These include the carpe diem lyric tradition which also forms the basis of his famous lyric &quot;To His Coy Mistress&quot;. He adopted familiar forms and infused them with his unique conceits, analogies, reflections and preoccupations with larger questions about life and death. T.S. Eliot wrote of Marvell&#x27;s style that &quot;It is more than a technical accomplishment, or the vocabulary and syntax of an epoch; it is, what we have designated tentatively as wit, a tough reasonableness beneath the slight lyric grace&quot;. He also identified Marvell and the metaphysical school with the &quot;dissociation of sensibility&quot; that occurred in 17th-century English literature; Eliot described this trend as &quot;something which ... happened to the mind of England...it is the difference between the i ntellectual poet and the reflective poet&quot;. Poets increasingly developed a self-conscious relationship to tradition, which took the form of a new emphasis on craftsmanship of expression and an idiosyncratic freedom in allusions to Classical and Biblical sources.

&quot;To His Coy Mistress&quot;, Marvell&#x27;s most celebrated poem, combines an old poetic conceit (the persuasion of the speaker&#x27;s lover by means of a carpe diem philosophy) with Marvell&#x27;s typically vibrant imagery and easy command of rhyming couplets. Other works incorporate topical satire and religious themes.

==Legacy==
A secondary school in Hull, the Andrew Marvell Business and Enterprise College, is named after him.
