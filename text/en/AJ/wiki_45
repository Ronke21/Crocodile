<text>Las Vegas, colloquially referred to as Vegas, is the most populous city in the U.S. state of Nevada and the seat of Clark County. The Las Vegas Valley metropolitan area is the largest within the greater Mojave Desert, and second-largest in the Southwestern United States. Las Vegas is an internationally renowned major resort city, known primarily for its gambling, shopping, fine dining, entertainment, and nightlife, with most venues centered on downtown Las Vegas and more to the Las Vegas Strip just outside city limits in unincorporated Winchester and Paradise. The Las Vegas Valley as a whole serves as the leading financial, commercial, and cultural center in Nevada. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city had 641,903 residents in 2020, with a metropolitan population of 2,227,053, making it the 24th-most populous city in the United States.

The city bills itself as the Entertainment Capital of the World, and is famous for its luxurious and extremely large casino-hotels. With over 40.8 million visitors annually as of 2023, Las Vegas is one of the most visited cities in the United States. It is the third most popular U.S. destination for business conventions and a global leader in the hospitality industry. The city is also host to more AAA Five Diamond hotels than any other city in the world. Las Vegas annually ranks as one of the world&#x27;s most visited tourist destinations. The city&#x27;s tolerance for numerous forms of adult entertainment has earned it the nickname &quot;Sin City,&quot; and has made it a popular setting for literature, films, television programs, commercials and music videos.

Las Vegas was settled in 1905 and officially incorporated in 1911. At the close of the 20th century, it was the most populated North American city founded within that century (a similar distinction was earned by Chicago in the 19th century). Population growth has accelerated since the 1960s and into the 21st century, and between 1990 and 2000 the population nearly doubled, increasing by 85.2%.

Although the city of Las Vegas shares the same history and cultural identity, the Las Vegas Strip is not inside the city limits of Las Vegas; it is instead part of the unincorporated towns of Paradise and Winchester.

==Toponymy==
In 1829, Mexican trader and explorer Antonio Armijo led a group consisting of 60 men and 100 mules along the Old Spanish Trail from modern day New Mexico to California. Along the way, the group stopped in what would become Las Vegas and noted its natural water sources, now referred to as the Las Vegas Springs, which supported extensive vegetation such as grasses and mesquite trees. The springs were a significant natural feature in the valley, with streams that supported a meadow ecosystem. This region served as the winter residence for the Southern Paiute people, who utilized the area&#x27;s resources before moving to higher elevations during the summer months. The Spanish &quot;las vegas&quot; or &quot;the meadows&quot; (more precisely, lower land near a river) in English, was applied to describe the fertile lowlands near the springs. Over time, the name began to refer to the populated settlement.

== History ==

Nomadic Paleo-Indians traveled to the Las Vegas area 10,000 years ago, leaving behind petroglyphs. Ancient Puebloan and Paiute tribes followed at least 2,000 years ago.

A young Mexican scout named Rafael Rivera is credited as the first non-Native American to encounter the valley, in 1829. Trader Antonio Armijo led a 60-man party along the Spanish Trail to Los Angeles, California, in 1829. In 1844, John C. Frémont arrived, and his writings helped lure pioneers to the area. Downtown Las Vegas&#x27;s Fremont Street is named after him.

Eleven years later, members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints chose Las Vegas as the site to build a fort halfway between Salt Lake City and Los Angeles, where they would travel to gather supplies. The fort was abandoned several years afterward. The remainder of this Old Mormon Fort can still be seen at the intersection of Las Vegas Boulevard and Washington Avenue.

Las Vegas was founded as a city in 1905, when of land adjacent to the Union Pacific Railroad tracks were auctioned in what would become the downtown area. In 1911, Las Vegas was incorporated as a city.
The year 1931 was pivotal for Las Vegas. At that time, Nevada legalized casino gambling and reduced residency requirements for divorce to six weeks. This year also witnessed the beginning of construction of the tunnels of nearby Hoover Dam. The influx of construction workers and their families helped Las Vegas avoid economic calamity during the Great Depression. The construction work was completed in 1935.

In late 1941, Las Vegas Army Airfield was established. Renamed Nellis Air Force Base in 1950, it is now home to the United States Air Force Thunderbirds aerobatic team.

Following World War II, lavishly decorated hotels, gambling casinos, and big-name entertainment became synonymous with Las Vegas.

In 1951, nuclear weapons testing began at the Nevada Test Site, northwest of Las Vegas. During this time, the city was nicknamed the &quot;Atomic City.&quot; Residents and visitors were able to witness the mushroom clouds (and were exposed to the fallout) until 1963 when the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty required that nuclear tests be moved underground.

In 1955, the Moulin Rouge Hotel opened and became the first racially integrated casino-hotel in Las Vegas.
During the 1960s, corporations and business tycoons such as Howard Hughes were building and buying hotel-casino properties. Gambling was referred to as &quot;gaming,&quot; which transitioned it into a legitimate business. &quot;Learning from Las Vegas&quot;, published during this era, asked architects to take inspiration from the city&#x27;s highly decorated buildings, helping to start the postmodern architecture movement.

In 1995, the Fremont Street Experience opened in Las Vegas&#x27;s downtown area. This canopied five-block area features 12.5 million LED lights and 550,000 watts of sound from dusk until midnight during shows held at the top of each hour.

Due to the realization of many revitalization efforts, 2012 was dubbed &quot;The Year of Downtown.&quot; Projects worth hundreds of millions of dollars made their debut at this time, including the Smith Center for the Performing Arts, the Discovery Children&#x27;s Museum, the Mob Museum, the Neon Museum, a new City Hall complex, and renovations for a new Zappos.com corporate headquarters in the old City Hall building.

==Geography==

Las Vegas is the county seat of Clark County, in a basin on the floor of the Mojave Desert, and is surrounded by mountain ranges.

According to a 2004 study, Las Vegas has one of the highest divorce rates. The city&#x27;s high divorce rate is not wholly due to Las Vegans themselves getting divorced. Compared to other states, Nevada&#x27;s nonrestrictive requirements for divorce result in many couples temporarily moving to Las Vegas in order to get divorced.

==Economy==
The primary drivers of the Las Vegas economy are tourism, gaming, and conventions, which in turn feed the retail and restaurant industries.

===Tourism===

The major attractions in Las Vegas are the casinos and the hotels, although in recent years other new attractions have begun to emerge.

Most casinos in the downtown area are on Fremont Street, with The STRAT Hotel, Casino &amp; Skypod as one of the few exceptions. Fremont East, adjacent to the Fremont Street Experience, was granted variances to allow bars to be closer together, similar to the Gaslamp Quarter of San Diego, the goal being to attract a different demographic than the Strip attracts.

====Downtown casinos====

The Golden Gate Hotel and Casino, downtown along the Fremont Street Experience, is the oldest continuously operating hotel and casino in Las Vegas; it opened in 1906 as the Hotel Nevada.

In 1931, the Northern Club (now the La Bayou) opened. The most notable of the early casinos may have been Binion&#x27;s Horseshoe (now Binion&#x27;s Gambling Hall and Hotel) while it was run by Benny Binion.

Boyd Gaming has a major presence downtown operating the California Hotel &amp; Casino, the Fremont Hotel &amp; Casino, and the Main Street Casino. The Four Queens also operates downtown along the Fremont Street Experience.

====Las Vegas Strip====
The center of the gambling and entertainment industry is the Las Vegas Strip, outside the city limits in the surrounding unincorporated communities of Paradise and Winchester in Clark County. Some of the largest casinos and buildings are there.

====Welcome signs====

In 1929, the city installed a welcome arch over Fremont Street, at the corner of Main Street. It remained in place until 1931.

In 1959, the Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign was installed at the south end of the Las Vegas Strip. A replica welcome sign, standing nearly tall, was installed within city limits in 2002, at Las Vegas Boulevard and Fourth Street. The replica was destroyed in 2016, when a pickup truck crashed into it.

In 2018, the city approved plans for a new gateway landmark in the form of neon arches. It was built within city limits, in front of the Strat resort and north of Sahara Avenue. The project, built by YESCO, cost $6.5 million and stands high. Officially known as the Gateway Arches, the project was completed in 2020. The steel arches are blue during the day, and light up in a variety of colors at night.

Also located just north of the Strat are a pair of giant neon showgirls, initially added in 2018 as part of a $400,000 welcome display. The original showgirls were tall, but were replaced by new ones in 2022, rising . The originals were refurbished following weather damage and installed at the Las Vegas Arts District.

===Development===

When The Mirage opened in 1989, it started a trend of major resort development on the Las Vegas Strip outside of the city. This resulted in a drop in tourism in the downtown area, but many recent projects have increased the number of visitors to downtown.

An effort has been made by city officials to diversify the economy by attracting health-related, high-tech and other commercial interests. No state tax for individuals or corporations, as well as a lack of other forms of business-related taxes, have aided the success of these efforts.

The Fremont Street Experience was built in an effort to draw tourists back to the area and has been popular since its startup in 1995.

The city conducted a land-swap deal in 2000 with Lehman Brothers, acquiring of property near downtown Las Vegas in exchange for of the Las Vegas Technology Center. In 2004, Las Vegas Mayor Oscar Goodman announced that the area would become home to Symphony Park (originally called &quot;Union Park&quot;), a mixed-use development. The development is home to the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health, The Smith Center for the Performing Arts, the Discovery Children&#x27;s Museum, the Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce, and four residential projects totaling 600 residential units as of 2024.

Projects funded include Las Vegas&#x27;s first independent bookstore, The Writer&#x27;s Block.

===Other industries===

A number of new industries have moved to Las Vegas in recent decades. Zappos.com (now an Amazon subsidiary) was founded in San Francisco but by 2013 had moved its headquarters to downtown Las Vegas. Allegiant Air, a low-cost air carrier, launched in 1997 with its first hub at Harry Reid International Airport and headquarters in nearby Summerlin.

Planet 13 Holdings, a cannabis company, opened the world&#x27;s largest cannabis dispensary in Las Vegas at .

=== Effects of growth on water supply ===
A growing population means the Las Vegas Valley used more water in 2014 than in 2011. Although water conservation efforts implemented in the wake of a 2002 drought have had some success, local water consumption remains 30 percent greater than in Los Angeles, and over three times that of San Francisco metropolitan area residents. The Southern Nevada Water Authority is building a $1.4 billion tunnel and pumping station to bring water from Lake Mead, has purchased water rights throughout Nevada, and has planned a controversial $3.2 billion pipeline across half the state. By law, the Las Vegas Water Service District &quot;may deny any request for a water commitment or request for a water connection if the District has an inadequate supply of water.&quot; But limiting growth on the basis of an inadequate water supply has been unpopular with the casino and building industries.

Las Vegas averaged 1.63 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8 per household.

With some exceptions, including Las Vegas Boulevard, Boulder Highway (SR 582) and Rancho Drive (SR 599), the majority of surface streets in Las Vegas are laid out in a grid along Public Land Survey System section lines. Many are maintained by the Nevada Department of Transportation as state highways. The street numbering system is divided by the following streets:
* Westcliff Drive, US 95 Expressway, Fremont Street and Charleston Boulevard divide the north–south block numbers from west to east.
* Las Vegas Boulevard divides the east–west streets from the Las Vegas Strip to near the Stratosphere, then Main Street becomes the dividing line from the Stratosphere to the North Las Vegas border, after which the Goldfield Street alignment divides east and west.
* On the east side of Las Vegas, block numbers between Charleston Boulevard and Washington Avenue are different along Nellis Boulevard, which is the eastern border of the city limits.

Interstates 15, 11, and US 95 lead out of the city in four directions. Two major freeways – Interstate 15 and Interstate 11/U.S. Route 95 – cross in downtown Las Vegas. I-15 connects Las Vegas to Los Angeles, and heads northeast to and beyond Salt Lake City. I-11 goes northwest to the Las Vegas Paiute Indian Reservation and southeast to Henderson and to the Mike O&#x27;Callaghan–Pat Tillman Memorial Bridge, where from this point I-11 will eventually continue along US 93 towards Phoenix, Arizona. US 95 (and eventually I-11) connects the city to northwestern Nevada, including Carson City and Reno. US 93 splits from I-15 northeast of Las Vegas and goes north through the eastern part of the state, serving Ely and Wells. US 95 heads south from US 93 near Henderson through far eastern California. A partial beltway has been built, consisting of Interstate 215 on the south and Clark County 215 on the west and north. Other radial routes include Blue Diamond Road (SR 160) to Pahrump and Lake Mead Boulevard (SR 147) to Lake Mead.

<text>The Brooklyn Bridge is a cable-stayed suspension bridge in New York City, spanning the East River between the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn. Opened on May 24, 1883, the Brooklyn Bridge was the first fixed crossing of the East River. It was also the longest suspension bridge in the world at the time of its opening, with a main span of and a deck above Mean High Water. The span was originally called the New York and Brooklyn Bridge or the East River Bridge but was officially renamed the Brooklyn Bridge in 1915.

Proposals for a bridge connecting Manhattan and Brooklyn were first made in the early 19th century, which eventually led to the construction of the current span, designed by John A. Roebling. The project&#x27;s chief engineer, his son Washington Roebling, contributed further design work, assisted by the latter&#x27;s wife, Emily Warren Roebling. Construction started in 1870 and was overseen by the New York Bridge Company, which in turn was controlled by the Tammany Hall political machine. Numerous controversies and the novelty of the design prolonged the project over thirteen years. After opening, the Brooklyn Bridge underwent several reconfigurations, having carried horse-drawn vehicles and elevated railway lines until 1950. To alleviate increasing traffic flows, additional bridges and tunnels were built across the East River. Following gradual deterioration, the Brooklyn Bridge was renovated several times, including in the 1950s, 1980s, and 2010s.

The Brooklyn Bridge is the southernmost of four vehicular bridges directly connecting Manhattan Island and Long Island, with the Manhattan Bridge, the Williamsburg Bridge, and the Queensboro Bridge to the north. Only passenger vehicles and pedestrian and bicycle traffic are permitted. A major tourist attraction since its opening, the Brooklyn Bridge has become an icon of New York City. Over the years, the bridge has been used as the location of various stunts and performances, as well as several crimes, attacks and vandalism. The Brooklyn Bridge is designated a National Historic Landmark, a New York City landmark, and a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark.

== Description ==
The Brooklyn Bridge, an early example of a steel-wire suspension bridge, uses a hybrid design combining elements of cable-stayed and suspension bridges, with both vertical and diagonal suspender cables. Its stone towers are neo-Gothic, with characteristic pointed arches. The New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT), which maintains the bridge, says that its original paint scheme was &quot;Brooklyn Bridge Tan&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot;, but other accounts state that it was originally entirely &quot;Rawlins Red&quot;.

=== Deck ===

To provide sufficient clearance for shipping in the East River, the Brooklyn Bridge incorporates long approach viaducts on either end to raise it from low ground on both shores. Including approaches, the Brooklyn Bridge is a total of long when measured between the curbs at Park Row in Manhattan and Sands Street in Brooklyn. A separate measurement of is sometimes given; this is the distance from the curb at Centre Street in Manhattan.

==== Suspension span ====
The main span between the two suspension towers is long and wide. The bridge &quot;elongates and contracts between the extremes of temperature from 14 to 16 inches&quot;. Navigational clearance is above Mean High Water (MHW). A 1909 &quot;Engineering Magazine&quot; article said that, at the center of the span, the height above MHW could fluctuate by more than due to temperature and traffic loads, while more rigid spans had a lower maximum deflection.

The side spans, between each suspension tower and each side&#x27;s suspension anchorages, are long. At the time of construction, engineers had not yet discovered the aerodynamics of bridge construction, and bridge designs were not tested in wind tunnels. John Roebling designed the Brooklyn Bridge&#x27;s truss system to be six to eight times as strong as he thought it needed to be. As such, the open truss structure supporting the deck is, by its nature, subject to fewer aerodynamic problems. However, due to a supplier&#x27;s fraudulent substitution of inferior-quality wire in the initial construction, the bridge was reappraised at the time as being only four times as strong as necessary.

The main span and side spans are supported by a structure containing trusses that run parallel to the roadway, each of which is deep. Originally there were six trusses, but two were removed during a late-1940s renovation. The trusses allow the Brooklyn Bridge to hold a total load of , a design consideration from when it originally carried heavier elevated trains. These trusses are held up by suspender ropes, which hang downward from each of the four main cables. Crossbeams run between the trusses at the top, and diagonal and vertical stiffening beams run on the outside and inside of each roadway.

An elevated pedestrian-only promenade runs in between the two roadways and above them. It typically runs below the level of the crossbeams, except at the areas surrounding each tower. Here, the promenade rises to just above the level of the crossbeams, connecting to a balcony that slightly overhangs the two roadways. The path is generally wide. The iron railings were produced by Janes &amp; Kirtland, a Bronx iron foundry that also made the United States Capitol dome and the Bow Bridge in Central Park.

==== Approaches ====
Each of the side spans is reached by an approach ramp. The approach ramp from the Brooklyn side is shorter than the approach ramp from the Manhattan side. The approaches are supported by Renaissance-style arches made of masonry; the arch openings themselves were filled with brick walls, with small windows within. The approach ramp contains nine arch or iron-girder bridges across side streets in Manhattan and Brooklyn.

Underneath the Manhattan approach, a series of brick slopes or &quot;banks&quot; was developed into a skate park, the Brooklyn Banks, in the late 1980s. The park uses the approach&#x27;s support pillars as obstacles. In the mid-2010s, the Brooklyn Banks were closed to the public because the area was being used as a storage site during the bridge&#x27;s renovation. The skateboarding community has attempted to save the banks on multiple occasions; after the city destroyed the smaller banks in the 2000s, the city government agreed to keep the larger banks for skateboarding. When the NYCDOT removed the bricks from the banks in 2020, skateboarders started an online petition. In the 2020s, local resident Rosa Chang advocated for the space under the Manhattan approach to be converted into a recreational area known as Gotham Park. Some of the space under the Manhattan approach reopened in May 2023 as a park called the Arches; this was followed in November 2024 by another section of parkland.

=== Cables ===

The Brooklyn Bridge contains four main cables, which descend from the tops of the suspension towers and help support the deck. Two are located to the outside of the bridge&#x27;s roadways, while two are in the median of the roadways. Each main cable measures in diameter and contains 5,282 parallel, galvanized steel wires wrapped closely together in a cylindrical shape. These wires are bundled in 19 individual strands, with 278 wires to a strand. This was the first use of bundling in a suspension bridge and took several months for workers to tie together. Since the 2000s, the main cables have also supported a series of 24-watt LED lighting fixtures, referred to as &quot;necklace lights&quot; due to their shape.

In addition, either 1,088, 1,096, or 1,520 galvanized steel wire suspender cables hang downward from the main cables. Another 400 cable extend diagonally from the towers. The vertical suspender cables and diagonal cable stays hold up the truss structure around the bridge deck. The bridge&#x27;s suspenders originally used wire rope, which was replaced in the 1980s with galvanized steel made by Bethlehem Steel. The vertical suspender cables measure long, and the diagonal stays measure long.

==== Anchorages ====
Each side of the bridge contains an anchorage for the main cables. The anchorages are trapezoidal limestone structures located slightly inland of the shore, measuring at the base and at the top. Each anchorage weighs . The Manhattan anchorage rests on a foundation of bedrock while the Brooklyn anchorage rests on clay.

The anchorages both have four anchor plates, one for each of the main cables, which are located near ground level and parallel to the ground. The anchor plates measure , with a thickness of and weigh each. Each anchor plate is connected to the respective main cable by two sets of nine eyebars, each of which is about long and up to thick. The chains of eyebars curve downward from the cables toward the anchor plates, and the eyebars vary in size depending on their position.

The anchorages also contain numerous passageways and compartments. Starting in 1876, in order to fund the bridge&#x27;s maintenance, the New York City government made the large vaults under the bridge&#x27;s Manhattan anchorage available for rent, and they were in constant use during the early 20th century. The vaults were used to store wine, as they were kept at a consistent temperature due to a lack of air circulation. The Manhattan vault was called the &quot;Blue Grotto&quot; because of a shrine to the Virgin Mary next to an opening at the entrance. The vaults were closed for public use in the late 1910s and 1920s during World War I and Prohibition but were reopened thereafter. When &quot;New York&quot; magazine visited one of the cellars in 1978, it discovered a &quot;fading inscription&quot; on a wall reading: &quot;Who loveth not wine, women and song, he remaineth a fool his whole life long.&quot; Leaks found within the vault&#x27;s spaces necessitated repairs during the late 1980s and early 1990s. By the late 1990s, the chambers were being used to store maintenance equipment.

=== Towers ===

The bridge&#x27;s two suspension towers are tall with a footprint of at the high water line. They are built of limestone, granite, and Rosendale cement. The limestone was quarried at the Clark Quarry in Essex County, New York. The granite blocks were quarried and shaped on Vinalhaven Island, Maine, under a contract with the Bodwell Granite Company, and delivered from Maine to New York by schooner. The Manhattan tower contains of masonry, while the Brooklyn tower has of masonry. There are 56 LED lamps mounted onto the towers.

Each tower contains a pair of Gothic Revival pointed arches, through which the roadways run. The arch openings are tall and wide. The tops of the towers are located above the floor of each arch opening, while the floors of the openings are above mean water level, giving the towers a total height of above mean high water.

====Caissons====
The towers rest on underwater caissons made of southern yellow pine and filled with cement. Inside both caissons were spaces for construction workers. The Manhattan side&#x27;s caisson is slightly larger, measuring and located below high water, while the Brooklyn side&#x27;s caisson measures and is located below high water. The caissons were designed to hold at least the weight of the towers which would exert a pressure of when fully built, but the caissons were over-engineered for safety. During an accident on the Brooklyn side, when air pressure was lost and the partially-built towers dropped full-force down, the caisson sustained an estimated pressure of with only minor damage. Most of the timber used in the bridge&#x27;s construction, including in the caissons, came from mills at Gascoigne Bluff on St. Simons Island, Georgia.

The Brooklyn side&#x27;s caisson, which was built first, originally had a height of and a ceiling composed of five layers of timber, each layer tall. Ten more layers of timber were later added atop the ceiling, and the entire caisson was wrapped in tin and wood for further protection against flooding. The thickness of the caisson&#x27;s sides was at both the bottom and the top. The caisson had six chambers: two each for dredging, supply shafts, and airlocks.

The caisson on the Manhattan side was slightly different because it had to be installed at a greater depth. To protect against the increased air pressure at that depth, the Manhattan caisson had 22 layers of timber on its roof, seven more than its Brooklyn counterpart had. The Manhattan caisson also had fifty pipes for sand removal, a fireproof iron-boilerplate interior, and different airlocks and communication systems.

== History ==

=== Planning ===
Proposals for a bridge between the then-separate cities of Brooklyn and New York had been suggested as early as 1800. At the time, the only travel between the two cities was by a number of ferry lines. Engineers presented various designs, such as chain or link bridges, though these were never built because of the difficulties of constructing a high enough fixed-span bridge across the extremely busy East River. There were also proposals for tunnels under the East River, but these were considered prohibitively expensive. German immigrant engineer John Augustus Roebling proposed building a suspension bridge over the East River in 1857. He had previously designed and constructed shorter suspension bridges, such as Roebling&#x27;s Delaware Aqueduct in Lackawaxen, Pennsylvania, and the Niagara Suspension Bridge. In 1867, Roebling erected what became the John A. Roebling Suspension Bridge over the Ohio River between Cincinnati, Ohio, and Covington, Kentucky.

In February 1867, the New York State Senate passed a bill that allowed the construction of a suspension bridge from Brooklyn to Manhattan. Two months later, the New York and Brooklyn Bridge Company was incorporated with a board of directors (later converted to a board of trustees). There were twenty trustees in total: eight each appointed by the mayors of New York and Brooklyn, as well as the mayors of each city and the auditor and comptroller of Brooklyn. The company was tasked with constructing what was then known as the New York and Brooklyn Bridge. Alternatively, the span was just referred to as the &quot;Brooklyn Bridge&quot;, a name originating in a January 25, 1867, letter to the editor sent to the &quot;Brooklyn Daily Eagle.&quot; The act of incorporation, which became law on April 16, 1867, authorized the cities of New York (now Manhattan) and Brooklyn to subscribe to $5 million in capital stock, which would fund the bridge&#x27;s construction.
Roebling was subsequently named the chief engineer of the work and, by September 1867, had presented a master plan. According to the plan, the bridge would be longer and taller than any suspension bridge previously built. It would incorporate roadways and elevated rail tracks, whose tolls and fares would provide the means to pay for the bridge&#x27;s construction. It would also include a raised promenade that served as a leisurely pathway. The proposal received much acclaim in both cities, and residents predicted that the New York and Brooklyn Bridge&#x27;s opening would have as much of an impact as the Suez Canal, the first transatlantic telegraph cable or the first transcontinental railroad. By early 1869, however, some individuals started to criticize the project, saying either that the bridge was too expensive, or that the construction process was too difficult.

To allay concerns about the design of the New York and Brooklyn Bridge, Roebling set up a &quot;Bridge Party&quot; in March 1869, where he invited engineers and members of U.S. Congress to see his other spans. Following the bridge party in April, Roebling and several engineers conducted final surveys. During the process, it was determined that the main span would have to be raised from above MHW, requiring several changes to the overall design. In June 1869, while conducting these surveys, Roebling sustained a crush injury to his foot when a ferry pinned it against a piling. After amputation of his crushed toes, he developed a tetanus infection that left him incapacitated and resulted in his death the following month. Washington Roebling, John Roebling&#x27;s 32-year-old son, was then hired to fill his father&#x27;s role. Tammany Hall leader William M. Tweed also became involved in the bridge&#x27;s construction because, as a major landowner in New York City, he had an interest in the project&#x27;s completion. The New York and Brooklyn Bridge Company—later known simply as the New York Bridge Company—was actually overseen by Tammany Hall, and it approved Roebling&#x27;s plans and designated him as chief engineer of the project.

===Construction===

==== Caissons ====

Construction of the Brooklyn Bridge began on January 2, 1870. The first work entailed the construction of two caissons, upon which the suspension towers would be built. The Brooklyn side&#x27;s caisson was built at the Webb &amp; Bell shipyard in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, and was launched into the river on March 19, 1870. Compressed air was pumped into the caisson, and workers entered the space to dig the sediment until it sank to the bedrock. As one sixteen-year-old from Ireland, Frank Harris, described the fearful experience:The six of us were working naked to the waist in the small iron chamber with the temperature of about 80 degrees Fahrenheit: In five minutes the sweat was pouring from us, and all the while we were standing in icy water that was only kept from rising by the terrific pressure. No wonder the headaches were blinding. Once the caisson had reached the desired depth, it was to be filled in with vertical brick piers and concrete. However, due to the unexpectedly high concentration of large boulders atop the riverbed, the Brooklyn caisson took several months to sink to the desired depth. Furthermore, in December 1870, its timber roof caught fire, delaying construction further. The &quot;Great Blowout&quot;, as the fire was called, delayed construction for several months, since the holes in the caisson had to be repaired. On March 6, 1871, the repairs were finished, and the caisson had reached its final depth of ; it was filled with concrete five days later. Overall, about 264 individuals were estimated to have worked in the caisson every day, but because of high worker turnover, the final total was thought to be about 2,500 men in total. In spite of this, only a few workers were paralyzed. At its final depth, the caisson&#x27;s air pressure was .

The Manhattan side&#x27;s caisson was the next structure to be built. To ensure that it would not catch fire like its counterpart had, the Manhattan caisson was lined with fireproof plate iron. It was launched from Webb &amp; Bell&#x27;s shipyard on May 11, 1871, and maneuvered into place that September. Due to the extreme underwater air pressure inside the much deeper Manhattan caisson, many workers became sick with &quot;the bends&quot;—decompression sickness—during this work, despite the incorporation of airlocks (which were believed to help with decompression sickness at the time). This condition was unknown at the time and was first called &quot;caisson disease&quot; by the project physician, Andrew Smith. Between January 25 and May 31, 1872, Smith treated 110 cases of decompression sickness, while three workers died from the disease. When iron probes underneath the Manhattan caisson found the bedrock to be even deeper than expected, Washington Roebling halted construction due to the increased risk of decompression sickness. After the Manhattan caisson reached a depth of with an air pressure of , Washington deemed the sandy subsoil overlying the bedrock beneath to be sufficiently firm, and subsequently infilled the caisson with concrete in July 1872.

Washington Roebling himself suffered a paralyzing injury as a result of caisson disease shortly after ground was broken for the Brooklyn tower foundation. His debilitating condition left him unable to supervise the construction in person, so he designed the caissons and other equipment from his apartment, directing &quot;the completion of the bridge through a telescope from his bedroom.&quot; His wife, Emily Warren Roebling, not only provided written communications between her husband and the engineers on site, but also understood mathematics, calculations of catenary curves, strengths of materials, bridge specifications, and the intricacies of cable construction. She spent the next 11 years helping supervise the bridge&#x27;s construction, taking over much of the chief engineer&#x27;s duties, including day-to-day supervision and project management.

==== Towers ====

After the caissons were completed, piers were constructed on top of each of them upon which masonry towers would be built. The towers&#x27; construction was a complex process that took four years. Since the masonry blocks were heavy, the builders transported them to the base of the towers using a pulley system with a continuous -diameter steel wire rope, operated by steam engines at ground level. The blocks were then carried up on a timber track alongside each tower and maneuvered into the proper position using a derrick atop the towers. The blocks sometimes vibrated the ropes because of their weight, but only once did a block fall.

Construction on the suspension towers started in mid-1872, and by the time work was halted for the winter in late 1872, parts of each tower had already been built. By mid-1873, there was substantial progress on the towers&#x27; construction. The Brooklyn side&#x27;s tower had reached a height of above mean high water (MHW), while the tower on the Manhattan side had reached above MHW. The arches of the Brooklyn tower were completed by August 1874. The tower was substantially finished by December 1874 with the erection of saddle plates for the main cables at the top of the tower. However, the ornamentation on the Brooklyn tower could not be completed until the Manhattan tower was finished. The last stone on the Brooklyn tower was raised in June 1875 and the Manhattan tower was completed in July 1876. The saddle plates atop both towers were also raised in July 1876. The work was dangerous: by 1876, three workers had died having fallen from the towers, while nine other workers were killed in other accidents.
In 1875, while the towers were being constructed, the project had depleted its original $5 million budget. Two bridge commissioners, one each from Brooklyn and Manhattan, petitioned New York state lawmakers to allot another $8 million for construction. Ultimately, the legislators passed a law authorizing the allotment with the condition that the cities would buy the stock of Brooklyn Bridge&#x27;s private stockholders.

Work proceeded concurrently on the anchorages on each side. The Brooklyn anchorage broke ground in January 1873 and was subsequently substantially completed in August 1875. The Manhattan anchorage was built in less time, having started in May 1875, it was mostly completed in July 1876. The anchorages could not be fully completed until the main cables were spun, at which point another would be added to the height of each anchorage.

====Cables====
The first temporary wire was stretched between the towers on August 15, 1876, using chrome steel provided by the Chrome Steel Company of Brooklyn. The wire was then stretched back across the river, and the two ends were spliced to form a traveler, a lengthy loop of wire connecting the towers, which was driven by a steam hoisting engine at ground level. The wire was one of two that were used to create a temporary footbridge for workers while cable spinning was ongoing. The next step was to send an engineer across the completed traveler wire in a boatswain&#x27;s chair slung from the wire, to ensure it was safe enough. The bridge&#x27;s master mechanic, E.F. Farrington, was selected for this task, and an estimated crowd of 10,000 people on both shores watched him cross. A second traveler wire was then stretched across the span, a task that was completed by August 30. The temporary footbridge, located some above the elevation of the future deck, was completed in February 1877.

By December 1876, a steel contract for the permanent cables still had not been awarded. There was disagreement over whether the bridge&#x27;s cables should use the as-yet-untested Bessemer steel or the well-proven crucible steel. Until a permanent contract was awarded, the builders ordered of wire in the interim, 10 tons each from three companies, including Washington Roebling&#x27;s own steel mill in Brooklyn. In the end, it was decided to use number 8 Birmingham gauge (approximately 4 mm or 0.165 inches in diameter) crucible steel, and a request for bids was distributed, to which eight companies responded. In January 1877, a contract for crucible steel was awarded to J. Lloyd Haigh, who was associated with bridge trustee Abram Hewitt, whom Roebling distrusted.

The spinning of the wires required the manufacture of large coils of it which were galvanized but not oiled when they left the factory. The coils were delivered to a yard near the Brooklyn anchorage. There they were dipped in linseed oil, hoisted to the top of the anchorage, dried out and spliced into a single wire, and finally coated with red zinc for further galvanizing. There were thirty-two drums at the anchorage yard, eight for each of the four main cables. Each drum had a capacity of of wire. The first experimental wire for the main cables was stretched between the towers on May 29, 1877, and spinning began two weeks later. All four main cables were being strung by that July. During that time, the temporary footbridge was unofficially opened to members of the public, who could receive a visitor&#x27;s pass; by August 1877 several thousand visitors from around the world had used the footbridge. The visitor passes ceased that September after a visitor had an epileptic seizure and nearly fell off.

As the wires were being spun, work also commenced on the demolition of buildings on either side of the river for the Brooklyn Bridge&#x27;s approaches; this work was mostly complete by September 1877. The following month, initial contracts were awarded for the suspender wires, which would hang down from the main cables and support the deck. By May 1878, the main cables were more than two-thirds complete. However, the following month, one of the wires slipped, killing two people and injuring three others. In 1877, Hewitt wrote a letter urging against the use of Bessemer steel in the bridge&#x27;s construction. Bids had been submitted for both crucible steel and Bessemer steel; John A. Roebling&#x27;s Sons submitted the lowest bid for Bessemer steel, but at Hewitt&#x27;s direction, the contract was awarded to Haigh.

A subsequent investigation discovered that Haigh had substituted inferior quality wire in the cables. Of eighty rings of wire that were tested, only five met standards, and it was estimated that Haigh had earned $300,000 from the deception. At this point, it was too late to replace the cables that had already been constructed. Roebling determined that the poorer wire would leave the bridge only four times as strong as necessary, rather than six to eight times as strong. The inferior-quality wire was allowed to remain and 150 extra wires were added to each cable. To avoid public controversy, Haigh was not fired, but instead was required to personally pay for higher-quality wire. The contract for the remaining wire was awarded to the John A. Roebling&#x27;s Sons, and by October 5, 1878, the last of the main cables&#x27; wires went over the river.

==== Nearing completion ====

After the suspender wires had been placed, workers began erecting steel crossbeams to support the roadway as part of the bridge&#x27;s overall superstructure. Construction on the bridge&#x27;s superstructure started in March 1879, but, as with the cables, the trustees initially disagreed on whether the steel superstructure should be made of Bessemer or crucible steel. That July, the trustees decided to award a contract for of Bessemer steel to the Edgemoor (or Edge Moor) Iron Works, based in Philadelphia, to be delivered by 1880. The trustees later passed another resolution for another of Bessemer steel. However, by February 1880 the steel deliveries had not started. That October, the bridge trustees questioned Edgemoor&#x27;s president about the delay in steel deliveries. Despite Edgemoor&#x27;s assurances that the contract would be fulfilled, the deliveries still had not been completed by November 1881. Brooklyn mayor Seth Low, who became part of the board of trustees in 1882, became the chairman of a committee tasked to investigate Edgemoor&#x27;s failure to fulfill the contract. When questioned, Edgemoor&#x27;s president stated that the delays were the fault of another contractor, the Cambria Iron Company, who was manufacturing the eyebars for the bridge trusses; at that point, the contract was supposed to be complete by October 1882.

Further complicating the situation, Washington Roebling had failed to appear at the trustees&#x27; meeting in June 1882, since he had gone to Newport, Rhode Island. After the news media discovered this, most of the newspapers called for Roebling to be fired as chief engineer, except for the &quot;Daily State Gazette&quot; of Trenton, New Jersey, and the &quot;Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot;. Some of the longstanding trustees, including Henry C. Murphy, James S. T. Stranahan, and William C. Kingsley, were willing to vouch for Roebling, since construction progress on the Brooklyn Bridge was still ongoing. However, Roebling&#x27;s behavior was considered suspect among the younger trustees who had joined the board more recently.

Construction on the bridge itself was noted in formal reports that Murphy presented each month to the mayors of New York and Brooklyn. For example, Murphy&#x27;s report in August 1882 noted that the month&#x27;s progress included 114 intermediate cords erected within a week, as well as 72 diagonal stays, 60 posts, and numerous floor beams, bridging trusses, and stay bars. By early 1883, the Brooklyn Bridge was considered mostly completed and was projected to open that June. Contracts for bridge lighting were awarded by February 1883, and a toll scheme was approved that March.

====Opposition====

There was substantial opposition to the bridge&#x27;s construction from shipbuilders and merchants located to the north, who argued that the bridge would not provide sufficient clearance underneath for ships. In May 1876, these groups, led by Abraham Miller, filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the cities of New York and Brooklyn.

In 1879, an Assembly Sub-Committee on Commerce and Navigation began an investigation into the Brooklyn Bridge. A seaman who had been hired to determine the height of the span, testified to the committee about the difficulties that ship masters would experience in bringing their ships under the bridge when it was completed. Another witness, Edward Wellman Serrell, a civil engineer, said that the calculations of the bridge&#x27;s assumed strength were incorrect. The Supreme Court decided in 1883 that the Brooklyn Bridge was a lawful structure.

=== Opening ===

The New York and Brooklyn Bridge was opened for use on May 24, 1883. Thousands of people attended the opening ceremony, and many ships were present in the East River for the occasion. Officially, Emily Warren Roebling was the first to cross the bridge. The bridge opening was also attended by U.S. president Chester A. Arthur and New York mayor Franklin Edson, who crossed the bridge and shook hands with Brooklyn mayor Seth Low at the Brooklyn end. Abram Hewitt gave the principal address.

Though Washington Roebling was unable to attend the ceremony (and rarely visited the site again), he held a celebratory banquet at his house on the day of the bridge opening. Further festivity included the performance by a band, gunfire from ships, and a fireworks display. On that first day, a total of 1,800 vehicles and 150,300 people crossed the span. Less than a week after the Brooklyn Bridge opened, ferry crews reported a sharp drop in patronage, while the bridge&#x27;s toll operators were processing over a hundred people a minute. However, cross-river ferries continued to operate until 1942.

The bridge had cost in 1883 dollars (about US$ in ) to build, of which Brooklyn paid two-thirds. The bonds to fund the construction would not be paid off until 1956. An estimated 27 men died during its construction. Since the New York and Brooklyn Bridge was the only bridge across the East River at that time, it was also called the East River Bridge. Until the construction of the nearby Williamsburg Bridge in 1903, the New York and Brooklyn Bridge was the longest suspension bridge in the world, 20% longer than any built previously.

At the time of opening, the Brooklyn Bridge was not complete; the proposed public transit across the bridge was still being tested, while the Brooklyn approach was being completed. On May 30, 1883, six days after the opening, a woman falling down a stairway at the Brooklyn approach caused a stampede which resulted in at least twelve people being crushed and killed. In subsequent lawsuits, the Brooklyn Bridge Company was acquitted of negligence. However, the company did install emergency phone boxes and additional railings, and the trustees approved a fireproofing plan for the bridge. Public transit service began with the opening of the New York and Brooklyn Bridge Railway, a cable car service, on September 25, 1883. On May 17, 1884, one of the circus master P. T. Barnum&#x27;s most famous attractions, Jumbo the elephant, led a parade of 21 elephants over the Brooklyn Bridge. This helped to lessen doubts about the bridge&#x27;s stability while also promoting Barnum&#x27;s circus.

=== 1880s to 1900s ===
Patronage across the Brooklyn Bridge increased in the years after it opened; a million people paid to cross in the first six months. The bridge carried 8.5 million people in 1884, its first full year of operation; this number doubled to 17 million in 1885 and again to 34 million in 1889. Many of these people were cable car passengers. Additionally, about 4.5 million pedestrians a year were crossing the bridge for free by 1892.

The first proposal to make changes to the bridge was sent in only two and a half years after it opened, when Linda Gilbert suggested glass steam-powered elevators and an observatory be added to the bridge and a fee charged for use, which would in part fund the bridge&#x27;s upkeep and in part fund her prison reform charity. This proposal was considered but not acted upon. Numerous other proposals were made during the first fifty years of the bridge&#x27;s life. Trolley tracks were added in the center lanes of both roadways in 1898, allowing trolleys to use the bridge as well. That year, the formerly separate City of Brooklyn was unified with New York City, and the Brooklyn Bridge fell under city control.

Concerns about the Brooklyn Bridge&#x27;s safety were raised during the turn of the century. In 1898, traffic backups due to a dead horse caused one of the truss cords to buckle. There were more significant worries after twelve suspender cables snapped in 1901, though a thorough investigation found no other defects. After the 1901 incident, five inspectors were hired to examine the bridge each day, a service that cost $250,000 a year. The Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company, which operated routes across the Brooklyn Bridge, issued a notice in 1905 saying that the bridge had reached its transit capacity.

By 1890, due to the popularity of the Brooklyn Bridge, there were proposals to construct other bridges across the East River between Manhattan and Long Island. Although a second deck for the Brooklyn Bridge was proposed, it was thought to be infeasible because doing so would overload the bridge&#x27;s structural capacity. The first new bridge across the East River, the Williamsburg Bridge, opened upstream in 1903 and connected Williamsburg, Brooklyn, with the Lower East Side of Manhattan. This was followed by the Queensboro Bridge between Queens and Manhattan in March 1909, and the Manhattan Bridge between Brooklyn and Manhattan in December 1909. Several subway, railroad, and road tunnels were also constructed, which helped to accelerate the development of Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens.

=== 1910s to 1940s ===
Tolls on the bridge were abolished in 1911. In addition, the city government passed a bill to officially name the structure the &quot;Brooklyn Bridge&quot; in January 1915.

Ostensibly in an attempt to reduce traffic on nearby city streets, Grover Whalen, the commissioner of Plant and Structures, banned motor vehicles from the Brooklyn Bridge on July 6, 1922. The real reason for the ban was an incident the same year where two cables slipped due to high traffic loads. Both Whalen and Roebling called for the renovation of the Brooklyn Bridge and the construction of a parallel bridge, though the parallel bridge was never built. Whalen&#x27;s successor William Wirt Mills announced in 1924 that a new wood-block pavement would be installed, permitting motor vehicles to use the bridge again; motor traffic was again allowed on the bridge starting on May 12, 1925.

As part of an experiment, starting in November 1946, the Manhattan-bound roadway carried Brooklyn-bound traffic during the evening rush hours. The experiment ended after two months due to complaints about congestion.

=== Mid- to late 20th century ===

==== Upgrades ====

The first major upgrade to the Brooklyn Bridge commenced in 1948, when a contract to entirely reconstruct the approach ramps was awarded to David B. Steinman. The renovation was expected to double the capacity of the bridge&#x27;s roadways to nearly 6,000 cars per hour, at a projected cost of $7 million. The renovation included the demolition of both the elevated and the trolley tracks on the roadways, the removal of trusses separating the inner elevated tracks from the existing vehicle lanes and the widening of each roadway from two to three lanes, as well as the construction of a new steel-and-concrete floor. In addition, new ramps were added to Adams Street, Cadman Plaza, and the Brooklyn Queens Expressway (BQE) on the Brooklyn side, and to Park Row on the Manhattan side. The bridge was briefly closed to all traffic for the first time ever in January 1950, and the trolley tracks closed that March to allow the widening work to occur. During the construction project, one roadway at a time was closed, allowing reduced traffic flows to cross the bridge in one direction only.

The widened south roadway was completed in May 1951, followed by the north roadway in October 1953. The restoration was finished in May 1954 with the completion of the reconstructed elevated promenade. While the rebuilding of the span was ongoing, a fallout shelter was constructed beneath the Manhattan approach in anticipation of the Cold War. The abandoned space in one of the masonry arches was stocked with emergency survival supplies for a potential nuclear attack by the Soviet Union; these supplies remained in place half a century later. In addition, defensive barriers were added to the bridge as a safeguard against sabotage.

Simultaneous with the rebuilding of the Brooklyn Bridge, a double-decked viaduct for the BQE was being built through an existing steel overpass of the bridge&#x27;s Brooklyn approach ramp. The segment of the BQE from Brooklyn Bridge south to Atlantic Avenue opened in June 1954, but the direct ramp from the northbound BQE to the Manhattan-bound Brooklyn Bridge did not open until 1959. The city also widened the Adams Street approach in Brooklyn, between the bridge and Fulton Street, from between 1954 and 1955. Subsequently, Boerum Place from Fulton Street south to Atlantic Avenue was also widened. This required the demolition of the old Kings County courthouse. The towers were cleaned in 1958 and the Brooklyn anchorage was repaired the next year.

On the Manhattan side, the city approved a controversial rebuilding of the Manhattan entrance plaza in 1953. The project, which would add a grade-separated junction over Park Row, was hotly contested because it would require the demolition of 21 structures, including the old New York World Building. The reconstruction also necessitated the relocation of 410 families on Park Row. In December 1956, the city started a two-year renovation of the plaza. This required the closure of one roadway at a time, as was done during the rebuilding of the bridge itself. Work on redeveloping the area around the Manhattan approach started in the mid-1960s. At the same time, plans were announced for direct ramps to the elevated FDR Drive to alleviate congestion at the approach. The ramp from FDR Drive to the Brooklyn Bridge was opened in 1968, followed by the ramp from the bridge to FDR Drive the next year. A single ramp from the Manhattan-bound Brooklyn Bridge to northbound Park Row was constructed in 1970. A repainting of the bridge was announced two years later in advance of its 90th anniversary.

==== Deterioration and late-20th century repair ====

The Brooklyn Bridge gradually deteriorated due to age and neglect. While it had 200 full-time dedicated maintenance workers before World War II, that number dropped to five by the late 20th century, and the city as a whole only had 160 bridge maintenance workers. In 1974, heavy vehicles such as vans and buses were banned from the bridge to prevent further erosion of the concrete roadway. A report in &quot;The New York Times&quot; four years later noted that the cables were visibly fraying and the pedestrian promenade had holes in it. The city began planning to replace all the Brooklyn Bridge&#x27;s cables at a cost of $115 million, as part of a larger project to renovate the Brooklyn, Manhattan, Williamsburg, and Queensboro bridges. By 1980, the Brooklyn Bridge was in such dire condition that it faced imminent closure. In some places, half of the strands in the cables were broken.

In June 1981, two of the diagonal stay cables snapped, killing a pedestrian. Subsequently, the anchorages were found to have developed rust, and an emergency cable repair was necessitated less than a month later after another cable developed slack. Following the incident, the city accelerated the timetable of its proposed cable replacement, and it commenced a $153 million rehabilitation of the Brooklyn Bridge in advance of the 100th anniversary. As part of the project, the bridge&#x27;s original suspender cables installed by J. Lloyd Haigh were replaced by Bethlehem Steel in 1986, marking the cables&#x27; first replacement since construction. In addition, the staircase at Washington Street in Brooklyn was renovated, the stairs from Tillary and Adams Streets were replaced with a ramp, and the short flights of steps from the promenade to each tower&#x27;s balcony were removed. In a smaller project, the bridge was floodlit at night starting in 1982 to highlight its architectural features.

Additional problems persisted, and in 1993, high levels of lead were discovered near the bridge&#x27;s towers. Further emergency repairs were undertaken in mid-1999 after small concrete shards began falling from the bridge into the East River. The concrete deck had been installed during the 1950s renovations and had a lifespan of about 60 years. The Park Row exit from the bridge&#x27;s westbound lanes was closed as a safety measure after the September 11, 2001, attacks on the nearby World Trade Center. That section of Park Row had been closed off since it ran right underneath 1 Police Plaza, the headquarters of the New York City Police Department (NYPD). In early 2003, to save money on electricity, the NYCDOT turned off the bridge&#x27;s &quot;necklace lights&quot; at night. They were turned back on later that year after several private entities made donations to fund the lights.

=== 21st century ===
After the 2007 collapse of the I-35W bridge in Minneapolis, public attention focused on the condition of bridges across the U.S. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the Brooklyn Bridge approach ramps had received a &quot;poor&quot; rating during an inspection in 2007. However, a NYCDOT spokesman said that the poor rating did not indicate a dangerous state but rather implied it required renovation. In 2010, the NYCDOT began renovating the approaches and deck, as well as repainting the suspension span. Work included widening two approach ramps from one to two lanes by re-striping a new prefabricated ramp; raising clearance over the eastbound BQE at York Street; seismic retrofitting; replacement of rusted railings and safety barriers; and road deck resurfacing. The work necessitated detours for four years. At the time, the project was scheduled to be completed in 2014; but completion was later delayed to 2015, then again to 2017. The project&#x27;s cost also increased from $508 million in 2010 to $811 million in 2016.

In August 2016, the NYCDOT announced that it would conduct a seven-month, $370,000 study to verify if the bridge could support a heavier upper deck that consisted of an expanded bicycle and pedestrian path. By then, about 10,000 pedestrians and 3,500 cyclists used the pathway on an average weekday. Work on the pedestrian entrance on the Brooklyn side was underway by 2017. The NYCDOT also indicated in 2016 that it planned to reinforce the Brooklyn Bridge&#x27;s foundations to prevent it from sinking, as well as repair the masonry arches on the approach ramps, which had been damaged by Hurricane Sandy four years earlier. In July 2018, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission approved a further renovation of the Brooklyn Bridge&#x27;s suspension towers and approach ramps. That December, the federal government gave the city $25 million in funding, which would pay for a $337 million rehabilitation of the bridge approaches and the suspension towers. Work started in late 2019 and was scheduled to be completed in four years. This restoration included removing bricks from the arches and putting fresh concrete behind them, using mortar from the same upstate quarries as the original mortar. The granite arches were also cleaned, revealing the original gray color of the stone, which had long been hidden by grime. Additionally, 56 LED lamps were installed on the bridge at a cost of $2.4 million.

In early 2020, City Council speaker Corey Johnson and the nonprofit Van Alen Institute hosted an international contest to solicit plans for the redesign of the bridge&#x27;s walkway. Ultimately, in January 2021, the city decided to install a two-way protected bike path on the Manhattan-bound roadway, replacing the leftmost vehicular lane. The bike lane would allow the existing promenade to be used exclusively by pedestrians. Work on the bike lane started in June 2021, and the new path was completed on September 14, 2021. Despite the addition of the bike path, the bridge&#x27;s walkway was still frequently overcrowded, prompting the city to propose in mid-2023 that street vendors be banned from the bridge and others citywide. All vendors were banned from the bridge at the beginning of January 2024. The same month, the bridge&#x27;s new LED lights were illuminated for the first time.

== Usage ==
===Vehicular traffic===
Horse-drawn carriages have been allowed to use the Brooklyn Bridge&#x27;s roadways since its opening. Originally, each of the two roadways carried two lanes of a different direction of traffic. The lanes were relatively narrow at only wide. In July 1922, motor vehicles were banned from the bridge; the ban lasted until May 1925.

After 1950, the main roadway carried six lanes of automobile traffic, three in each direction. It was then reduced to five lanes with the addition of a two-way bike lane on the Manhattan-bound side in 2021. Because of the roadway&#x27;s posted height restriction of and weight restriction of , commercial vehicles and buses are prohibited from using the Brooklyn Bridge. The weight restrictions prohibit heavy passenger vehicles such as pickup trucks and SUVs from using the bridge, though this is not often enforced in practice.

On the Brooklyn side, vehicles can enter the bridge from Tillary/Adams Streets to the south, Sands/Pearl Streets to the west, and exit 28B of the eastbound Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. In Manhattan, cars can enter from both the northbound and southbound FDR Drive, as well as Park Row to the west, Chambers/Centre Streets to the north, and Pearl Street to the south. However, the exit from the bridge to northbound Park Row was closed after the September 11 attacks because of increased security concerns: that section of Park Row ran under One Police Plaza, the NYPD headquarters.

====Exit list====
Vehicular access to the bridge is provided by a complex series of ramps on both sides of the bridge. There are two entrances to the bridge&#x27;s pedestrian promenade on either side. The current configuration, including the closed ramp from the bridge to the northbound Park Row, was constructed from the mid-1950s until the early 1970s.



=== Rail traffic ===
Formerly, rail traffic operated on the Brooklyn Bridge as well. Cable cars and elevated railroads used the bridge until 1944, while trolleys ran until 1950.

==== Cable cars and elevated railroads ====

The New York and Brooklyn Bridge Railway, a cable car service, began operating on September 25, 1883; it ran on the inner lanes of the bridge, between terminals at the Manhattan and Brooklyn ends. Since Washington Roebling believed that steam locomotives would put excessive loads upon the structure of the Brooklyn Bridge, the cable car line was designed as a steam/cable-hauled hybrid. They were powered from a generating station under the Brooklyn approach. The cable cars could not only regulate their speed on the % upward and downward approaches, but also maintain a constant interval between each other. There were 24 cable cars in total.

Initially, the service ran with single-car trains, but patronage soon grew so much that by October 1883, two-car trains were in use. The line carried three million people in the first six months, nine million in 1884, and nearly 20 million in 1885 following the opening of the Brooklyn Union Elevated Railroad. Accordingly, the track layout was rearranged and more trains were ordered. At the same time, there were highly controversial plans to extend the elevated railroads onto the Brooklyn Bridge, under the pretext of extending the bridge itself. After disputes, the trustees agreed to build two elevated routes to the bridge on the Brooklyn side. Patronage continued to increase, and in 1888, the tracks were lengthened and even more cars were constructed to allow for four-car cable car trains. Electric wires for the trolleys were added by 1895, allowing for the potential future decommissioning of the steam/cable system. The terminals were rebuilt once more in July 1895, and, following the implementation of new electric cars in late 1896, the steam engines were dismantled and sold.

Following the unification of the cities of New York and Brooklyn in 1898, the New York and Brooklyn Bridge Railway ceased to be a separate entity that June and the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT) assumed control of the line. The BRT started running through-services of elevated trains, which ran from Park Row Terminal in Manhattan to points in Brooklyn via the Sands Street station on the Brooklyn side. Before reaching Sands Street (at Tillary Street for Fulton Street Line trains, and at Bridge Street for Fifth Avenue Line and Myrtle Avenue Line trains), elevated trains bound for Manhattan were uncoupled from their steam locomotives. The elevated trains were then coupled to the cable cars, which would pull the passenger carriages across the bridge.

The BRT did not run any elevated train through services from 1899 to 1901. Due to increased patronage after the opening of the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT)&#x27;s first subway line, the Park Row station was rebuilt in 1906. In the early 20th century, there were plans for Brooklyn Bridge elevated trains to run underground to the BRT&#x27;s proposed Chambers Street station in Manhattan, though the connection was never opened. The overpass across William Street was closed in 1913 to make way for the proposed connection. In 1929, the overpass was reopened after it became clear that the connection would not be built.

After the IRT&#x27;s Joralemon Street Tunnel and the Williamsburg Bridge tracks opened in 1908, the Brooklyn Bridge no longer held a monopoly on rail service between Manhattan and Brooklyn, and cable service ceased. New subway lines from the IRT and from the BRT&#x27;s successor Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT), built in the 1910s and 1920s, posed significant competition to the Brooklyn Bridge rail services. With the opening of the Independent Subway System in 1932 and the subsequent unification of all three companies into a single entity in 1940, the elevated services started to decline, and the Park Row and Sands Street stations were greatly reduced in size. The Fifth Avenue and Fulton Street services across the Brooklyn Bridge were discontinued in 1940 and 1941 respectively, and the elevated tracks were abandoned permanently with the withdrawal of Myrtle Avenue services in 1944.

==== Trolleys ====
A plan for trolley service across the Brooklyn Bridge was presented in 1895. Two years later, the Brooklyn Bridge trustees agreed to a plan where trolleys could run across the bridge under ten-year contracts. Trolley service, which began in 1898, ran on what are now the two middle lanes of each roadway (shared with other traffic). Brooklyn Bridge Local trolley service between the two ends of the bridge was introduced in January 1908. The cable cars were discontinued immediately afterward, and the shuttle was also eliminated. After cable service was withdrawn, the trolley tracks on the Brooklyn side were rebuilt to alleviate congestion. Trolley service on the middle lanes continued until the elevated lines stopped using the bridge in 1944, when they moved to the protected center tracks. On March 5, 1950, the streetcars also stopped running, and the bridge was redesigned exclusively for automobile traffic.

===Walkway===


The Brooklyn Bridge has an elevated promenade open to pedestrians in the center of the bridge, located above the automobile lanes. The promenade is usually located below the height of the girders, except at the approach ramps leading to each tower&#x27;s balcony. The path is generally wide, though this is constrained by obstacles such as protruding cables, benches, and stairways, which create &quot;pinch points&quot; at certain locations. The path narrows to at the locations where the main cables descend to the level of the promenade. Further exacerbating the situation, these &quot;pinch points&quot; are some of the most popular places to take pictures. As a result, in 2016, the NYCDOT announced that it planned to double the promenade&#x27;s width.

A center line was painted to separate cyclists from pedestrians in 1971, creating one of the city&#x27;s first dedicated bike lanes. Initially, the northern side of the promenade was used by pedestrians and the southern side by cyclists. In 2000, these were swapped, with cyclists taking the northern side and pedestrians taking the southern side. On September 14, 2021, the NYCDOT closed off the left-side car lane on the Manhattan-bound side with protective barriers and fencing to create a new bike path, and cyclists were banned from the upper pedestrian lane.

Pedestrian access to the bridge from the Brooklyn side is from either the median of Adams Street at its intersection with Tillary Street or a staircase near Prospect Street between Cadman Plaza East and West. In Manhattan, the pedestrian walkway is accessible from crosswalks at the intersection of the bridge and Centre Street, or through a staircase leading to Park Row.

====Emergency use====
While the bridge has always permitted the passage of pedestrians, the promenade facilitates movement when other means of crossing the East River have become unavailable. During transit strikes by the Transport Workers Union in 1980 and 2005, people commuting to work used the bridge; they were joined by Mayors Ed Koch and Michael Bloomberg, who crossed as a gesture to the affected public. Pedestrians also walked across the bridge as an alternative to suspended subway services following the 1965, 1977, and 2003 blackouts, and after the September 11 attacks.

During the 2003 blackouts, many crossing the bridge reported a swaying motion. The higher-than-usual pedestrian load caused this swaying, which was amplified by the tendency of pedestrians to synchronize their footfalls with a sway. Several engineers expressed concern about how this would affect the bridge, although others noted that the bridge did withstand the event and that the redundancies in its design—the inclusion of the three support systems (suspension system, diagonal stay system, and stiffening truss)—make it &quot;probably the best secured bridge against such movements going out of control&quot;. In designing the bridge, John Roebling had stated that the bridge would sag but not fall, even if one of these structural systems were to fail altogether.

==Tolls==

The Brooklyn Bridge was initially a toll bridge. Though carriages and cable-car customers had paid tolls ever since the bridge&#x27;s opening, pedestrians were spared from the tolls originally. By the first decade of the 20th century, pedestrians were also paying tolls. Tolls on all four bridges across the East River—the Brooklyn Bridge, as well as the Manhattan, Williamsburg, and Queensboro bridges to the north—were abolished in July 1911 as part of a populist policy initiative headed by New York City mayor William Jay Gaynor. 

In 1970, the federal government enacted the Clean Air Act, a series of federal air pollution regulations. As part of a plan by mayor John Lindsay and the federal Environmental Protection Agency, the city government considered implementing tolls on the four free East River bridges, including the Brooklyn Bridge, in the early 1970s. The plan would have raised money for New York City&#x27;s transit system and allowed the city to meet the Clean Air Act. Abraham Beame, who became mayor in 1974, refused to implement the tolls, and the United States Congress subsequently moved to forbid tolls on the free East River bridges. The United States Department of Transportation determined that several of these bridges were built partially with federal funds and, under federal law, could not be tolled.

A plan for congestion pricing in New York City was approved in mid-2023, allowing the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to toll drivers who enter Manhattan south of 60th Street. Congestion pricing was implemented in January 2025. Most traffic between the Brooklyn Bridge and FDR Drive is exempt from the toll, but all other Manhattan-bound drivers pay a toll, which varies based on the time of day. Although no toll is charged upon exiting the congestion zone, Brooklyn-bound drivers must pay a toll to access streets leading to the bridge, unless they use the FDR Drive.

== Notable events ==
=== Stunts ===

There have been several notable jumpers from the Brooklyn Bridge. The first person was Robert Emmet Odlum, brother of women&#x27;s rights activist Charlotte Odlum Smith, on May 19, 1885. He struck the water at an angle and died shortly afterwards from internal injuries. Steve Brodie supposedly dropped from underneath the bridge in July 1886 and was briefly arrested for it, though there is some doubt about whether he actually jumped. Larry Donovan made a slightly higher jump from the railing a month afterward. The first known person to jump from the bridge with the intention of suicide was Francis McCarey in 1892. A lesser known early jumper was James Duffy of County Cavan, Ireland, who on April 15, 1895, asked several men to watch him jump from the bridge. Duffy jumped and was not seen again. Additionally, the cartoonist Otto Eppers jumped and survived in 1910, and was then tried and acquitted for attempted suicide. The Brooklyn Bridge has since developed a reputation as a suicide bridge due to the number of jumpers who do so intending to kill themselves, though exact statistics are difficult to find.

Other notable feats have taken place on or near the bridge. In 1919, Giorgio Pessi piloted what was then one of the world&#x27;s largest airplanes, the Caproni Ca.5, under the bridge. In 1993, bridge jumper Thierry Devaux illegally performed eight acrobatic bungee jumps above the East River close to the Brooklyn tower.

=== Crimes and terrorism ===

On March 1, 1994, Lebanese-born Rashid Baz opened fire on a van carrying members of the Chabad-Lubavitch Orthodox Jewish Movement, striking 16-year-old student Ari Halberstam and three others traveling on the bridge. Halberstam died five days later from his wounds, and Baz was later convicted of murder. He was apparently acting out of revenge for the Hebron massacre of Palestinian Muslims a few days prior to the incident. After initially classifying the killing as one committed out of road rage, the Justice Department reclassified the case in 2000 as a terrorist attack. The entrance ramp to the bridge on the Manhattan side was dedicated as the Ari Halberstam Memorial Ramp in 1995.

Several potential attacks or disasters have also been averted. In 1979, police disarmed a stick of dynamite placed under the Brooklyn approach, and an artist in Manhattan was arrested that year after another bombing attempt. In 2003, truck driver Iyman Faris was sentenced to about 20 years in prison for providing material support to Al-Qaeda, after an earlier plot to destroy the bridge by cutting through its support wires with blowtorches was thwarted.

===Arrests===

At 9:00 a.m. on May 19, 1977, artist Jack Bashkow climbed one of the towers for &quot;Bridging&quot;, a &quot;media sculpture&quot; by the performance group Art Corporation of America Inc. Seven artists climbed the largest bridges connected to Manhattan &quot;to replace violence and fear in mass media for one day&quot;. When each of the artists had reached the tops of the bridges, they ignited bright-yellow flares at the same moment, resulting in rush hour traffic disruption, media attention, and the arrest of the climbers, though the charges were later dropped. Called &quot;the first social-sculpture to use mass-media as art&quot; by conceptual artist Joseph Beuys, the event was on the cover of the &quot;New York Post&quot;, received international attention, and received ABC Eyewitness News&#x27; &quot;1977 Best News of the Year&quot; award. John Halpern documented the incident in the film &quot;Bridging, 1977&quot;. Halpern attempted another &quot;bridging&quot; &quot;social sculpture&quot; in 1979, when he planted a radio receiver, gunpowder and fireworks in a bucket atop one of the towers. The piece was later discovered by police, leading to his arrest for possessing a bomb.

On October 1, 2011, more than 700 protesters with the Occupy Wall Street movement were arrested while attempting to march across the bridge on the roadway. Protesters disputed the police account of the events and claimed that the arrests were the result of being trapped on the bridge by the NYPD. The majority of the arrests were subsequently dismissed.

On July 22, 2014, the two American flags on the flagpoles atop each tower were found to have been replaced by bleached-white American flags. Initially, cannabis activism was suspected as a motive, but on August 12, 2014, two Berlin artists claimed responsibility for hoisting the two white flags, having switched out the original flags with their replicas. The artists said that the flags were meant to celebrate &quot;the beauty of public space&quot; and the anniversary of the death of German-born John Roebling, and they denied that it was an &quot;anti-American statement&quot;.

===Anniversary celebrations===

The 50th-anniversary celebrations on May 24, 1933, included a ceremony featuring an airplane show, ships, and fireworks, as well as a banquet. During the centennial celebrations on May 24, 1983, a flotilla of ships visited the harbor, officials held parades, and Grucci Fireworks held a fireworks display that evening. For the centennial, the Brooklyn Museum exhibited a selection of the original drawings made for the bridge&#x27;s construction, including those by Washington Roebling. Media coverage of the centennial was declared &quot;the public relations triumph of 1983&quot; by &quot;Inc.&quot;

The 125th anniversary of the bridge&#x27;s opening was celebrated by a five-day event on May 22–26, 2008, which included a live performance by the Brooklyn Philharmonic, a special lighting of the bridge&#x27;s towers, and a fireworks display. Other events included a film series, historical walking tours, information tents, a series of lectures and readings, a bicycle tour of Brooklyn, a miniature golf course featuring Brooklyn icons, and other musical and dance performances. Just before the anniversary celebrations, artist Paul St George installed the Telectroscope, a video link on the Brooklyn side of the bridge that connected to a matching device on London&#x27;s Tower Bridge. A renovated pedestrian connection to Dumbo, Brooklyn, was also reopened before the anniversary celebrations.

== Impact ==
At the time of construction, contemporaries marveled at what technology was capable of, and the bridge became a symbol of the era&#x27;s optimism. John Perry Barlow wrote in the late 20th century of the &quot;literal and genuinely religious leap of faith&quot; embodied in the bridge&#x27;s construction, saying that the &quot;Brooklyn Bridge required of its builders faith in their ability to control technology&quot;.

===Historical designations and plaques===

The Brooklyn Bridge has been listed as a National Historic Landmark since January 29, 1964, and was subsequently added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. The bridge has also been a New York City designated landmark since August 24, 1967, and was designated a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1972. In addition, it was placed on UNESCO&#x27;s list of tentative World Heritage Sites in 2017.

A bronze plaque is attached to the Manhattan anchorage, which was constructed on the site of the Samuel Osgood House at 1 Cherry Street in Manhattan. Named after Samuel Osgood, a Massachusetts politician and lawyer, it was built in 1770 and served as the first U.S. presidential mansion. The Osgood House was demolished in 1856.

Another plaque on the Manhattan side of the pedestrian promenade, installed by the city in 1975, indicates the bridge&#x27;s status as a city landmark.

===Culture===
The Brooklyn Bridge has had an impact on idiomatic American English. For example, references to &quot;selling the Brooklyn Bridge&quot; are frequent in American culture, sometimes presented as a historical reality but more often as an expression meaning an idea that strains credulity. George C. Parker and William McCloundy were two early 20th-century con men who may have perpetrated this scam successfully, particularly on new immigrants, although the author of &quot;The Brooklyn Bridge: A Cultural History&quot; wrote, &quot;No evidence exists that the bridge has ever been sold to a &#x27;gullible outlander&#x27;&quot;.

As a tourist attraction, the Brooklyn Bridge is a popular site for clusters of love locks, wherein a couple inscribes a date and their initials onto a lock, attach it to the bridge, and throw the key into the water as a sign of their love. The practice is illegal in New York City and the NYPD can give violators a $100 fine. NYCDOT workers periodically remove the love locks from the bridge at a cost of $100,000 per year.

To highlight the Brooklyn Bridge&#x27;s cultural status, the city proposed building a Brooklyn Bridge museum near the bridge&#x27;s Brooklyn end in the 1970s. Though the museum was ultimately not constructed, as many as 10,000 drawings and documents relating to it were found in a carpenter shop in Williamsburg in 1976. These documents were given to the New York City Municipal Archives, where they are normally located, though a selection of them were displayed at the Whitney Museum of American Art when they were discovered.

===Media===

The bridge is often featured in wide shots of the New York City skyline in television and film and has been depicted in numerous works of art. Fictional works have used the Brooklyn Bridge as a setting; for instance, the dedication of a portion of the bridge, and the bridge itself, were key components in the 2001 film &quot;Kate &amp; Leopold&quot;. Furthermore, the Brooklyn Bridge has also served as an icon of America, with mentions in numerous songs, books, and poems. Among the most notable of these works is that of American Modernist poet Hart Crane, who used the Brooklyn Bridge as a central metaphor and organizing structure for his second book of poetry, &quot;The Bridge&quot; (1930).

The Brooklyn Bridge has also been lauded for its architecture. One of the first positive reviews was &quot;The Bridge As A Monument&quot;, a &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; piece written by architecture critic Montgomery Schuyler and published a week after the bridge&#x27;s opening. In the piece, Schuyler wrote: &quot;It so happens that the work which is likely to be our most durable monument, and to convey some knowledge of us to the most remote posterity, is a work of bare utility; not a shrine, not a fortress, not a palace, but a bridge.&quot; Architecture critic Lewis Mumford cited the piece as the impetus for serious architectural criticism in the U.S. He wrote that in the 1920s the bridge was a source of &quot;joy and inspiration&quot; in his childhood, and that it was a profound influence in his adolescence. Later critics would regard the Brooklyn Bridge as a work of art, as opposed to an engineering feat or a means of transport. Not all critics appreciated the bridge, however. Henry James, writing in the early 20th century, cited the bridge as an ominous symbol of the city&#x27;s transformation into a &quot;steel-souled machine room&quot;.

The construction of the Brooklyn Bridge is detailed in numerous media sources, including David McCullough&#x27;s 1972 book &quot;The Great Bridge&quot; and Ken Burns&#x27;s 1981 documentary &quot;Brooklyn Bridge&quot;. It is also described in &quot;Seven Wonders of the Industrial World&quot;, a BBC docudrama series with an accompanying book, as well as &quot;Chief Engineer: Washington Roebling, The Man Who Built the Brooklyn Bridge&quot;, a biography published in 2017.

<text>Land for peace is a legalistic interpretation of UN Security Council Resolution 242 which has been used as the basis of subsequent Arab–Israeli peace making. The name &quot;Land for Peace&quot; is derived from the wording of the resolution&#x27;s first operative paragraph which affirms that peace should include the application of two principles: Withdrawal of Israeli forces (Giving Up Land), and Termination of all claims or states of belligerency (Making Peace). Since the resolution stipulates that both principles should apply, they can be viewed jointly as giving up land for peace, referred to more concisely as &quot;land for peace&quot;.

This interpretation is widely contested because it implies that Israeli withdrawal is linked to its neighbours&#x27; willingness to formally make peace. Competing interpretations of the resolution regard Israel as being obligated to withdraw unilaterally from all territories captured in 1967. Operative paragraph 1 of Resolution 242 reads as follows:

:1. Affirms that the fulfillment of Charter principles requires the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East which should include the application of both the following principles:
::: (i) Withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict;

::: (ii) Termination of all claims or states of belligerency and respect for and acknowledgement of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force;

In 1976, when Lord Caradon was asked about the concessions the Arab states would have to make to Israel as part of an overall settlement, he said &quot;Well, that&#x27;s perfectly obvious if you read again the principles of 242, which have been accepted by Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Saudi Arabia, and in effect by Israel. The provision is that if there is an adequate withdrawal, all states in the area must be free to live within secure and recognized boundaries, free from force and threat of force. So it is an acceptance that Israel has a right to exist, just as they would have a right to their homeland, and have a right to exist. This is the essential bargain that we are proposing. It&#x27;s not a new thing, it&#x27;s been going since 1967.

==Peace treaties==

On 19 June 1967, shortly after the Six-Day War, the Israeli government voted to return the Sinai to Egypt and the Golan Heights to Syria in exchange for a permanent peace settlement and a demilitarization of the returned territories. This decision was not made public at the time, nor was it conveyed to any Arab state. Israeli Foreign Minister Abba Eban has said that it had been conveyed, but there seems to be no solid evidence to corroborate his claim; no formal peace proposal was made either directly or indirectly by Israel. The Americans, who were briefed of the Cabinet&#x27;s decision by Eban, were not asked to convey it to Cairo and Damascus as official peace proposals, nor were they given indications that Israel expected a reply. Eban rejected the prospect of a mediated peace, insisting on the need for direct negotiations with the Arab governments.

The Arab position, as it emerged in September 1967 at the Khartoum Arab Summit, was to reject any peaceful settlement with the State of Israel. The eight participating states—Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, Algeria, Kuwait, and Sudan—passed a resolution that would later become known as the &quot;three no&#x27;s&quot;: there would be no peace, no recognition and no negotiation with Israel. Prior to that, King Hussein of Jordan had stated that he could not rule out a possibility of a &quot;real, permanent peace&quot; between Israel and the Arab states.

The first application of the land for peace formula was Israel&#x27;s peace treaty with Egypt in 1979, under which Israel withdrew from the Sinai as part of a comprehensive peace agreement facilitated by economic assistance to both sides from the United States.

In 1994 a similar comprehensive agreement invoking resolution 242 formed the basis of the Israel Jordan peace treaty whereby both sides redeployed to their respective sides of the agreed international boundary.

<doc id="47751" wikidata="Q23165" url="?curid=47751" title="Gloucestershire">
<text>Gloucestershire ( , ; abbreviated Glos.) is a ceremonial county in South West England. It is bordered by Herefordshire to the north-west, Worcestershire to the north, Warwickshire to the north-east, Oxfordshire to the east, Wiltshire to the south, Bristol and Somerset to the south-west, and the Welsh county of Monmouthshire to the west. The city of Gloucester is the largest settlement and the county town.

The county is predominantly rural, with an area of and a population of 916,212. After Gloucester (118,555) the largest distinct settlements are Cheltenham (115,940), Stroud (26,080), and Yate (28,350). In the south of the county, the areas around Filton and Kingswood are densely populated and part of Bristol built-up area. For local government purposes Gloucestershire comprises a non-metropolitan county, with six districts, and the unitary authority area of South Gloucestershire. South Gloucestershire Council is a member of the West of England Combined Authority.

Gloucestershire is bisected by the river River Severn, which enters the county near Tewkesbury and forms a wide valley down its centre before broadening into a large tidal estuary. The hills to the east form the majority of the Cotswolds AONB, and the uplands to the west are part of the Forest of Dean and the Wye Valley AONB, which stretches into Wales.

Gloucestershire was likely established in the tenth century, and expanded to approximately its current borders in the eleventh. The county was relatively settled during the late Middle Ages, and contained several wealthy monasteries such as Tewkesbury, Gloucester, Hailes, and Cirencester; the Forest of Dean was also a major iron-producing region in this period. The city of Bristol became an independent county in 1373, by which point it was the third-largest city in England. Gloucestershire was not heavily industrialised during the Industrial Revolution, but the Port of Gloucester was expanded with new docks and the small Forest of Dean coalfield was exploited.

==History==
Gloucestershire is a historic county mentioned in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; in the 10th century, though the areas of Winchcombe and the Forest of Dean were not added until the late 11th century.

Gloucestershire originally included Bristol, then a small town. Members of local rural communities moved to the port city (as Bristol was to become), and Bristol&#x27;s population growth accelerated during the industrial revolution. Bristol became a county in its own right, separate from Gloucestershire and Somerset, in 1373. It later became part of the administrative County of Avon from 1974 to 1996. Some northern parts of the county, including Long Marston and Welford-on-Avon, were transferred to Warwickshire in 1931.

Upon the abolition of Avon in 1996, the region north of Bristol became a unitary authority area of South Gloucestershire and is now part of the ceremonial county of Gloucestershire.

In July 2007, Gloucestershire was subject to some of the worst flooding in recorded British history, with tens of thousands of residents affected. The RAF conducted the largest peacetime domestic operation in its history to rescue over 120 residents from flood-affected areas. The damage was estimated at over £2 billion.

== Geography and environment==
Gloucestershire has three main landscape areas, a large part of the Cotswolds, the Royal Forest of Dean and the Severn Vale. The Cotswolds take up a large portion of the east and south of the county, The Forest of Dean taking up the west, with the Severn and its valley running between these features. The Daffodil Way in the Leadon Valley, on the border of Gloucestershire and Herefordshire surrounding the village of Dymock, is known for its many spring flowers, orchards, and woodland, which attracts many walkers. In the west, the Wye valley borders Wales.

==Governance==
Gloucestershire is a ceremonial county in South West England. Gloucestershire County Council&#x27;s 53 seats are majority-controlled by the Conservatives, though the Liberal Democrats have a sizeable presence on the council. The Council Leader is Mark Hawthorne. The County Council shares responsibility with six district councils: Tewkesbury, Forest of Dean, City of Gloucester, Cheltenham, Stroud and Cotswold.

The southernmost part of the county, South Gloucestershire is governed by South Gloucestershire Council, which is a unitary authority council independent of the county council but the unitary authority is still part of the ceremonial county. Previously, the area of South Gloucestershire was part of the county of Avon. Although Avon was abolished in 1996, some services in South Gloucestershire are still provided in conjunction with other former parts of Avon county, such as the Avon Fire and Rescue Service. Since 2017, South Gloucestershire has been part of the West of England Combined Authority, which is under the directly elected mayor Dan Norris.

There are six parliamentary constituencies in Gloucestershire, all of which are Conservative controlled as of the 2019 general election. Due to the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, Gloucestershire will be combined with Wiltshire for parliamentary boundary purposes, allowing cross-county electoral divisions.

==Economy==
This is a chart of trend of regional gross value added of Gloucestershire at current basic prices published (pp. 240–253) by &quot;Office for National Statistics&quot; with figures in millions of Pounds Sterling.
The following is a chart of Gloucestershire&#x27;s gross value added total in millions of Pounds Sterling from 1997 to 2009 based upon the Office for National Statistics figures

The 2009 estimation of £11,452 million GVA can be compared to the South West regional average of £7,927 million.

==Education==
===Secondary schools===
Gloucestershire has mainly comprehensive schools with seven selective grammar schools; two are in Stroud, Stroud High School for girls and Marling School for boys, one in Cheltenham, Pate&#x27;s Grammar, and four in Gloucester, Sir Thomas Rich&#x27;s for boys (aged 11–18) and girls (aged 16–18, in the sixth form), and Denmark Road High School and Ribston Hall for girls and The Crypt which is mixed. There are 42 state secondary schools, not including sixth form colleges, and 12 independent schools, including Cheltenham Ladies&#x27; College, Cheltenham College and Dean Close School. All but about two schools in each district have a sixth form, but the Forest of Dean only has two schools with sixth forms. All schools in South Gloucestershire have sixth forms.

===Higher and further education===

Gloucestershire has two universities, the University of Gloucestershire and the Royal Agricultural University, and four higher and further education colleges, Gloucestershire College, Cirencester College, South Gloucestershire and Stroud College and the Royal Forest of Dean College. Each has campuses at multiple locations throughout the county.

The University of the West of England also has three locations in Gloucestershire; an associate faculty (Hartpury College) specialising in animal behaviour and welfare, agricultural and sports-related courses in Hartpury, Gloucestershire; a regional centre at the Gloucester Docks, Alexandra Warehouse, specialising in Adult and Mental Health Nursing; and Frenchay Campus in South Gloucestershire.

==Towns and cities==

=== Green belt ===

The county has two green belt areas, the first covers the southern area in the South Gloucestershire district, to protect outlying villages and towns between Thornbury and Chipping Sodbury from the urban sprawl of the Bristol conurbation. The second belt lies around Gloucester, Cheltenham, and Bishop&#x27;s Cleeve, to afford those areas and villages in between a protection from urban sprawl and further convergence. Both belts intersect with the boundaries of the Cotswolds AONB.

==Transport==
===Railways===
Gloucestershire once had a much larger railway network than it does now with over 100 stations in the county, the vast majority of which were closed during the Beeching cuts. Nowadays, only 15 remain within the county, mostly concentrated on the CrossCountry NE-SW route and around the North Fringe of Bristol. Some stations have been re-opened in recent years; Cam and Dursley railway station opened in 1994, with Ashchurch for Tewkesbury opening three years later in 1997. Local campaign groups are also seeking to reopen several disused stations, including Charfield railway station in South Gloucestershire.

==Antiquities==
There are a number of Roman remains scattered across the county, including the Eastgate Viewing Chamber in Gloucester and Chedworth Roman Villa.

There are a variety of religious buildings across the county, notably the cathedral of Gloucester, the abbey church of Tewkesbury (which is over 500 years old and has the tallest Norman tower in England), and the church of Cirencester. Of the abbey of Hailes near Winchcombe, founded by Richard, Earl of Cornwall, in 1246, little more than the foundations are left, but these have been excavated and fragments have been brought to light.
Most of the old market towns have parish churches. At Deerhurst near Tewkesbury and Bishop&#x27;s Cleeve near Cheltenham, there are churches of special interest on account of the pre-Norman work they retain. There is also a Perpendicular church in Lechlade, and that at Fairford was built (), according to tradition, to contain a series of stained-glass windows which are said to have been brought from the Netherlands. These are, however, adjudged to be of English workmanship.

Other notable buildings include Calcot Barn in Calcot, a relic of Kingswood Abbey. Thornbury Castle is a Tudor country house, the pretensions of which evoked the jealousy of Cardinal Wolsey against its builder, Edward Stafford, duke of Buckingham, who was beheaded in 1521. Near Cheltenham is the 15th-century mansion of Southam de la Bere, of timber and stone. Memorials of the de la Bere family appear in the church at Cleeve. The mansion contains a tiled floor from Hailes Abbey. At Great Badminton is the mansion and vast domain of the Beauforts (formerly of the Botelers and others), on the south-eastern boundary of the county. Berkeley Castle at over 800 years old and the ruins of Witcombe Roman Villa at Great Witcombe are also notable heritage features.

There are several royal residences in Gloucestershire, including Highgrove House, Gatcombe Park, and (formerly) Nether Lypiatt Manor.

An annual &quot;cheese-rolling&quot; event takes place at Cooper&#x27;s Hill, near Brockworth and the Cotswold Games occurred within the county.

There are also several community radio stations including Gloucester FM, Radio Winchcombe, Forest of Dean Radio, North Cotswold Community Radio, and Severn FM.

Local TV for the county is provided by BBC West and ITV West Country from Bristol, although in the northern extremes of Gloucestershire, BBC Midlands and ITV Central (West) from Birmingham covers this area. Some eastern parts of the county (Cirencester and parts of the Cotswolds) receive BBC South and ITV Meridian from Oxford.

==In popular culture==

There are two well-known accounts of childhood in rural Gloucestershire in the early 20th century, Laurie Lee&#x27;s &quot;Cider With Rosie&quot; and Winifred Foley&#x27;s &quot;A Child in the Forest&quot;. Part of Mrs. Craik&#x27;s novel &quot;John Halifax, Gentleman&quot; is set in Enderley, a thinly disguised Amberley, where she lived at the time of writing. Most of the book is set in Nortonbury, easily recognisable as Tewkesbury.

The county has also been the setting for a number of high-profile movies and TV series, including &quot;Die Another Day&quot;, the Harry Potter films and the BBC TV series &quot;Butterflies&quot;.

&quot;A Girl&#x27;s Best Friend&quot;, the pilot for the proposed &quot;Doctor Who&quot; spin-off &quot;K-9 and Company&quot;, was filmed in Gloucestershire. The setting is the fictional town of Moreton Harwood. The fictional town of Leadworth in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; is in Gloucestershire. It is the home of companions Amy Pond, Rory Williams and River Song in their childhoods and young adulthoods. Additionally, the 2020 episode &quot;Fugitive of the Judoon&quot; was set and filmed at Gloucester Cathedral.

A fictional Brimpsfield was the village, home of Peter and Abby Grant, in the 1970s BBC TV series &quot;Survivors&quot;, with a railway connection to London.

Witcombe Festival is an annual music festival held in Brockworth. As well as music, the three-day festival has it roots deep in cider. The festival consists of four stages and has been headlined by Dizzee Rascal, Plan B, Sigma, Ella Eyre, Example, Wiley, Heather Small, Lethal Bizzle and Tinchy Stryder.

The Romano/Celtic temple ruins in Lydney Park contributed to J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s description of The Shire in his Middle-earth Legendarium.

==Animals==

The famous Gloucestershire Old Spots pig is named for Gloucestershire and is historically associated with the county. Sheep roam widely in the Forest of Dean. The Forest of Dean and the Wye Valley also have wild boar.

Gloucester cattle, a rare breed, can still be found in and around Gloucestershire. They can be recognised by the white stripe that runs down the centre of their backs to the tip of their tails. The cattle are famous for producing milk for both Single Gloucester and Double Gloucester cheeses.

<text>Domesday Book ( ; the Middle English spelling of &quot;Doomsday Book&quot;) is a manuscript record of the Great Survey of much of England and parts of Wales completed in 1086 at the behest of King William the Conqueror. The manuscript was originally known by the Latin name , meaning &quot;Book of Winchester&quot;, where it was originally kept in the royal treasury. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; states that in 1085 the king sent his agents to survey every shire in England, to list his holdings and dues owed to him.

Written in Medieval Latin, it was highly abbreviated and included some vernacular native terms without Latin equivalents. The survey&#x27;s main purpose was to record the annual value of every piece of landed property to its lord, and the resources in land, labour force, and livestock from which the value derived.

The name &quot;Domesday Book&quot; came into use in the 12th century. Richard FitzNeal wrote in the ( 1179) that the book was so called because its decisions were unalterable, like those of the Last Judgment, and its sentence could not be quashed.

The manuscript is held at the National Archives at Kew, London. Domesday was first printed in full in 1783, and in 2011 the Open Domesday site made the manuscript available online.

The book is an invaluable primary source for modern historians, especially economic historians. No survey approaching the scope and extent of Domesday Book was attempted again in Britain until the 1873 Return of Owners of Land (sometimes termed the &quot;Modern Domesday&quot;) which presented the first complete, post-Domesday picture of the distribution of landed property in the United Kingdom.

==Content and organisation==

Domesday Book encompasses two independent works (originally in two physical volumes): &quot;Little Domesday&quot; (covering Norfolk, Suffolk, and Essex), and &quot;Great Domesday&quot; (covering much of the remainder of England – except for lands in the north that later became Westmorland, Cumberland, Northumberland, and the County Palatine of Durham – and parts of Wales bordering and included within English counties). Space was left in Great Domesday for a record of the City of London and Winchester, but they were never written up. Other areas of modern London were then in Middlesex, Surrey, Kent, and Essex and have their place in Domesday Book&#x27;s treatment of those counties. Most of Cumberland, Westmorland, and the entirety of the County Palatine of Durham and Northumberland were omitted. They did not pay the national land tax called the geld, and the framework for Domesday Book was geld assessment lists.

&quot;Little Domesday&quot;, so named because its format is physically smaller than its companion&#x27;s, is more detailed than Great Domesday. In particular, it includes the numbers of livestock on the home farms (demesnes) of lords, but not peasant livestock. It represents an earlier stage in processing the results of the Domesday Survey before the drastic abbreviation and rearrangement undertaken by the scribe of Great Domesday Book.

Both volumes are organised into a series of chapters (literally &quot;headings&quot;, from Latin &quot;caput&quot;, &quot;a head&quot;) listing the manors held by each named tenant-in-chief directly from the king. Tenants-in-chief included bishops, abbots and abbesses, barons from Normandy, Brittany, and Flanders, minor French serjeants, and English thegns. The richest magnates held several hundred manors typically spread across England, though some large estates were highly concentrated. For example, Baldwin the Sheriff had one hundred and seventy-six manors in Devon and four nearby in Somerset and Dorset. Tenants-in-chief held variable proportions of their manors in demesne, and had subinfeudated to others, whether their own knights (often tenants from Normandy), other tenants-in-chief of their own rank, or members of local English families. Manors were generally listed within each chapter by the hundred or wapentake (in eastern England), the second tier of local government under the counties, in which they lay.
Each county&#x27;s list opened with the king&#x27;s demesne, which had possibly been the subject of separate inquiry. Under the feudal system, the king was the only true &quot;owner&quot; of land in England by virtue of his allodial title. He was thus the ultimate overlord, and even the greatest magnate could do no more than &quot;hold&quot; land from him as a tenant (from the Latin verb &quot;tenere&quot;, &quot;to hold&quot;) under one of the various contracts of feudal land tenure. Holdings of bishops followed, then of abbeys and religious houses, then of lay tenants-in-chief, and lastly the king&#x27;s serjeants (&quot;servientes&quot;) and thegns.

In some counties, one or more principal boroughs formed the subject of a separate section. A few have separate lists of disputed titles to land called &quot;clamores&quot; (claims). The equivalent sections in Little Domesday are called &quot;Inuasiones&quot; (annexations).

In total, 268,984 people are tallied in the Domesday Book, each of whom was the head of a household. Some households, such as urban dwellers, were excluded from the count, but the exact parameters remain a subject of historical debate. Sir Michael Postan, for instance, contends that these may not represent all rural households, but only full peasant tenancies, thus excluding landless men and some subtenants (potentially a third of the country&#x27;s population). H. C. Darby, when factoring in the excluded households and using various different criteria for those excluded (as well as varying sizes for the average household), concludes that the 268,984 households listed most likely indicate a total English population between 1.2 and 1.6 million.

Domesday names a total of 13,418 places. Apart from the wholly rural portions, which constitute its bulk, Domesday contains entries of interest concerning most towns, which were probably made because of their bearing on the fiscal rights of the crown therein. These include fragments of custumals (older customary agreements), records of the military service due, markets, mints, and so forth. From the towns, from the counties as wholes, and from many of its ancient lordships, the crown was entitled to archaic dues in kind, such as honey.

The Domesday Book lists 5,624 mills in the country, which is considered a low estimate since the book is incomplete. For comparison, fewer than 100 mills were recorded in the country a century earlier. Georges Duby indicates this means a mill for every forty-six peasant households and implies a great increase in the consumption of baked bread in place of boiled and unground porridge. The book also lists 28,000 slaves, a smaller number than had been enumerated in 1066.

In the Domesday Book, scribes&#x27; orthography was heavily geared towards French, most lacking k and w, regulated forms for sounds and and ending many hard consonant words with e as they were accustomed to do with most dialects of French at the time.

==Similar works==
In a parallel development, around 1100, the Normans in southern Italy completed their &quot;Catalogus Baronum&quot; based on Domesday Book. The original manuscript was destroyed in the Second World War, but the text survives in printed editions.

==Name==
The manuscripts do not carry a formal title. The work is referred to internally as a &quot;descriptio&quot; (enrolling), and in other early administrative contexts as the king&#x27;s &quot;brevia&quot; ((short) writings). From about 1100, references appear to the &quot;liber&quot; (book) or &quot;carta&quot; (charter) of Winchester, its usual place of custody; and from the mid-12th to early 13th centuries to the Winchester or king&#x27;s &quot;rotulus&quot; (roll).

To the English, who held the book in awe, it became known as &quot;Domesday Book&quot;, in allusion to the Last Judgment and in specific reference to the definitive character of the record. The word &quot;doom&quot; was the usual Old English term for a law or judgment; it did not carry the modern overtones of . Richard FitzNeal, treasurer of England under Henry II, explained the name&#x27;s connotations in detail in the (1179):

The name &quot;Domesday&quot; was subsequently adopted by the book&#x27;s custodians, being first found in an official document in 1221.

Either through false etymology or deliberate word play, the name also came to be associated with the Latin phrase &quot;Domus Dei&quot; (&quot;House of God&quot;). Such a reference is found as early as the late 13th century, in the writings of Adam of Damerham; and in the 16th and 17th centuries, antiquaries such as John Stow and Sir Richard Baker believed this was the name&#x27;s origin, alluding to the church in Winchester in which the book had been kept. As a result, the alternative spelling &quot;Domesdei&quot; became popular for a while.

The usual modern scholarly convention is to refer to the work as &quot;Domesday Book&quot; (or simply as &quot;Domesday&quot;), without a definite article. However, the form &quot;the Domesday Book&quot; is also found in both academic and non-academic contexts.

==Survey==

The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; states that planning for the survey was conducted in 1085, and the book&#x27;s colophon states the survey was completed in 1086. It is not known when exactly Domesday Book was compiled, but the entire copy of Great Domesday appears to have been copied out by one person on parchment (prepared sheepskin), although six scribes seem to have been used for Little Domesday. Writing in 2000, David Roffe argued that the inquest (survey) and the construction of the book were two distinct exercises. He believes the latter was completed, if not started, by William II following his accession to the English throne; William II quashed a rebellion that followed and was based on, though not consequence of, the findings of the inquest.

Most shires were visited by a group of royal officers (&quot;legati&quot;) who held a public inquiry, probably in the great assembly known as the shire court. These were attended by representatives of every township as well as of the local lords. The unit of inquiry was the Hundred (a subdivision of the county, which then was an administrative entity). The return for each Hundred was sworn to by 12 local jurors, half of them English and half of them Norman.

What is believed to be a full transcript of these original returns is preserved for several of the Cambridgeshire Hundreds – the Cambridge Inquisition – and is of great illustrative importance. The &quot;Inquisitio Eliensis&quot; is a record of the lands of Ely Abbey. The &quot;Exon Domesday&quot; (named because the volume was held at Exeter) covers Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Somerset, and one manor of Wiltshire. Parts of Devon, Dorset, and Somerset are also missing. Otherwise, this contains the full details supplied by the original returns.

Through comparison of what details are recorded in which counties, six Great Domesday &quot;circuits&quot; can be determined (plus a seventh circuit for the Little Domesday shires).

# Berkshire, Hampshire, Kent, Surrey, Sussex
# Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Somerset, Wiltshire
# Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Cambridgeshire, Hertfordshire, Middlesex
# Leicestershire, Northamptonshire, Oxfordshire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire
# Cheshire, the land &quot;Inter Ripam et Mersham&quot; (&quot;between Ribble and Mersey&quot;, now much of south Lancashire), Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, Shropshire, Worcestershire – the Marches
# Derbyshire, Huntingdonshire, Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, Rutland, Yorkshire

==Purpose==
Three sources discuss the goal of the survey:
* The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; tells why it was ordered:

After this had the king a large meeting, and very deep consultation with his council, about this land; how it was occupied, and by what sort of men. Then sent he his men over all England into each shire; commissioning them to find out &#x27;How many hundreds of hides were in the shire, what land the king himself had, and what stock upon the land; or, what dues he ought to have by the year from the shire.&#x27; Also he commissioned them to record in writing, &#x27;How much land his archbishops had, and his diocesan bishops, and his abbots, and his earls;&#x27; and though I may be prolix and tedious, &#x27;What, or how much, each man had, who was an occupier of land in England, either in land or in stock, and how much money it was worth.&#x27; So very narrowly, indeed, did he commission them to trace it out, that there was not one single hide, nor a yard of land, nay, moreover (it is shameful to tell, though he thought it no shame to do it), not even an ox, nor a cow, nor a swine was there left, that was not set down in his writ. And all the recorded particulars were afterwards brought to him.
* The list of questions asked of the jurors was recorded in the &quot;Inquisitio Eliensis&quot;.
* The contents of Domesday Book and the allied records mentioned above.

The primary purpose of the survey was to ascertain and record the fiscal rights of the king. These were mainly:
* the national land-tax (&quot;geldum&quot;), paid on a fixed assessment;
* certain miscellaneous dues; and
* the proceeds of the crown lands.

After a great political convulsion such as the Norman Conquest, and the following wholesale confiscation of landed estates, William needed to reassert that the rights of the Crown, which he claimed to have inherited, had not suffered in the process. His Norman followers tended to evade the liabilities of their English predecessors. Historians believe the survey was to aid William in establishing certainty and a definitive reference point as to property holdings across the nation, in case such evidence was needed in disputes over Crown ownership.

The Domesday survey, therefore, recorded the names of the new holders of lands and the assessments on which their tax was to be paid. But it did more than this; by the king&#x27;s instructions, it endeavoured to make a national valuation list, estimating the annual value of all the land in the country, (1) at the time of Edward the Confessor&#x27;s death, (2) when the new owners received it, (3) at the time of the survey, and further, it reckoned, by command, the potential value as well. It is evident that William desired to know the financial resources of his kingdom, and it is probable that he wished to compare them with the existing assessment, which was one of considerable antiquity, though there are traces that it had been occasionally modified. The great bulk of Domesday Book is devoted to the somewhat arid details of the assessment and valuation of rural estates, which were as yet the only important source of national wealth. After stating the assessment of the manor, the record sets forth the amount of arable land, and the number of plough teams (each reckoned at eight oxen) available for working it, with the additional number (if any) that might be employed; then the river-meadows, woodland, pasture, fisheries (i.e. fishing weirs), water-mills, salt-pans (if by the sea), and other subsidiary sources of revenue; the peasants are enumerated in their several classes; and finally the annual value of the whole, past and present, is roughly estimated.

The organisation of the returns on a feudal basis, enabled the Conqueror and his officers to see the extent of a baron&#x27;s possessions; and it also showed to what extent he had under-tenants and the identities of the under-tenants. This was of great importance to William, not only for military reasons but also because of his resolve to command the personal loyalty of the under-tenants (though the &quot;men&quot; of their lords) by making them swear allegiance to him. As Domesday Book normally records only the Christian name of an under-tenant, it is not possible to search for the surnames of families claiming a Norman origin. Scholars, however, have worked to identify the under-tenants, most of whom have foreign Christian names.

The survey provided the King with information on potential sources of funds when he needed to raise money. It includes sources of income but not expenses, such as castles, unless they needed to be included to explain discrepancies between pre-and post-Conquest holdings of individuals. Typically, this happened in a town, where separately-recorded properties had been demolished to make way for a castle.

Early British authors thought that the motivation behind the Survey was to put into William&#x27;s power the lands, so that all private property in land came only from the grant of King William, by lawful forfeiture. The use of the word &quot;antecessor&quot; in the Domesday Book is used for the former holders of the lands under Edward, and who had been dispossessed by their new owners.

==Subsequent history==
===Custodial history===
Domesday Book was preserved from the late 11th to the beginning of the 13th centuries in the royal Treasury at Winchester (the Norman kings&#x27; capital). It was often referred to as the &quot;Book&quot; or &quot;Roll&quot; of Winchester. When the Treasury moved to the Palace of Westminster, probably under King John, the book went with it.

The two volumes (Great Domesday and Little Domesday) remained in Westminster, save for temporary releases, until the 19th century. They were held originally in various offices of the Exchequer: the Chapel of the Pyx of Westminster Abbey; the Treasury of Receipts; and the Tally Court. However, on several occasions they were taken around the country with the Chancellor of the Exchequer: to York and Lincoln in 1300, to York in 1303 and 1319, to Hertford in the 1580s or 1590s, and to Nonsuch Palace, Surrey, in 1666 for a time after the Great Fire of London.

From the 1740s onwards, they were held, with other Exchequer records, in the chapter house of Westminster Abbey. In 1859, they were transferred to the new Public Record Office, London. They are now held at the National Archives at Kew. The chest in which they were stowed in the 17th and 18th centuries is also at Kew.

In modern times, the books have been removed from the London area only rarely. In 1861–1863, they were sent to Southampton for photozincographic reproduction. In 1918–19, prompted by the threat of German bombing during the First World War, they were evacuated (with other Public Record Office documents) to Bodmin Prison, Cornwall. Likewise, in 1939–1945, during the Second World War, they were evacuated to Shepton Mallet Prison, Somerset.

===Binding===
The volumes have been rebound on several occasions. Little Domesday was rebound in 1320, its older oak boards being re-used. At a later date (probably in the Tudor period) both volumes were given new covers. They were rebound twice in the 19th century, in 1819 and 1869 – on the second occasion, by the binder Robert Riviere and his assistant, James Kew. In the 20th century, they were rebound in 1952, when their physical makeup was examined in greater detail; and yet again in 1986, for the survey&#x27;s ninth centenary. On this last occasion Great Domesday was divided into two physical volumes, and Little Domesday into three volumes.

===Publication===

The project to publish Domesday was begun by the government in 1773, and the book appeared in two volumes in 1783, set in &quot;record type&quot; to produce a partial-facsimile of the manuscript. In 1811, a volume of indexes was added. In 1816, a supplementary volume, separately indexed, was published containing
# The &quot;Exon Domesday&quot; – for the south-western counties
# The &quot;Inquisitio Eliensis&quot;
# The &quot;Liber Winton&quot; – surveys of Winchester late in the 12th century.
# The &quot;Boldon Buke (Book)&quot; – a survey of the bishopric of Durham a century later than Domesday

Photographic facsimiles of Domesday Book, for each county separately, were published in 1861–1863, also by the government. Today, Domesday Book is available in numerous editions, usually separated by county and available with other local history resources.

In 1986, the BBC released the &quot;BBC Domesday Project,&quot; the results of a project to create a survey to mark the 900th anniversary of the original Domesday Book. In August 2006, the contents of Domesday went online, with an English translation of the book&#x27;s Latin. Visitors to the website are able to look up a place name and see the index entry made for the manor, town, city or village. They can also, for a fee, download the relevant page.

===Continuing legal use===
In the Middle Ages, the Book&#x27;s evidence was frequently invoked in the law courts. In 1960, it was among citations for a real manor which helps to evidence legal use rights on and anchorage into the Crown&#x27;s foreshore; in 2010, as to proving a manor, adding weight of years to sporting rights (deer and foxhunting); and a market in 2019.

==Importance==

As H. C. Darby noted, anyone who uses Domesday Book

can have nothing but admiration for what is the oldest &#x27;public record&#x27; in England and probably the most remarkable statistical document in the history of Europe. The continent has no document to compare with this detailed description covering so great a stretch of territory. And the geographer, as he turns over the folios, with their details of population and of arable, woodland, meadow and other resources, cannot but be excited at the vast amount of information that passes before his eyes.

The author of the article on the book in the eleventh edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; noted, &quot;To the topographer, as to the genealogist, its evidence is of primary importance, as it not only contains the earliest survey of each township or manor, but affords, in the majority of cases, a clue to its subsequent descent.&quot;

Darby also notes the inconsistencies, saying that &quot;when this great wealth of data is examined more closely, perplexities and difficulties arise.&quot; One problem is that the clerks who compiled this document &quot;were but human; they were frequently forgetful or confused.&quot; The use of Roman numerals also led to countless mistakes. Darby states, &quot;Anyone who attempts an arithmetical exercise in Roman numerals soon sees something of the difficulties that faced the clerks.&quot; But more important are the numerous obvious omissions, and ambiguities in presentation. Darby first cites F. W. Maitland&#x27;s comment following his compilation of a table of statistics from material taken from the Domesday Book survey, &quot;it will be remembered that, as matters now stand, two men not unskilled in Domesday might add up the number of hides in a county and arrive at very different results because they would hold different opinions as to the meanings of certain formulas which are not uncommon.&quot; Darby says that &quot;it would be more correct to speak not of &#x27;the Domesday geography of England&#x27;, but of &#x27;the geography of Domesday Book&#x27;. The two may not be quite the same thing, and how near the record was to reality we can never know.&quot;

<doc id="47754" wikidata="Q229279" url="?curid=47754" title="Philippa of Hainault">
<text>Philippa of Hainault (sometimes spelled Hainaut; Middle French: &quot;Philippe de Hainaut&quot;; 24 June 1310 (or 1315) – 15 August 1369) was Queen of England as the wife and political adviser of King Edward III. She acted as regent in 1346, when her husband was away for the Hundred Years&#x27; War.

Daughter of William I, Count of Hainaut and French princess Joan of Valois, Philippa was engaged to Edward, Prince of Wales, in 1326. Their marriage was celebrated in York Minster on 24 January 1328, some months after Edward&#x27;s accession to the throne of England and Isabella of France&#x27;s infamous invasion. After her husband reclaimed the throne, Philippa influenced King Edward to take interest in the nation&#x27;s commercial expansion, was part of the successful Battle of Neville&#x27;s Cross, and often went on expeditions to Scotland and France. She won much popularity with the English people for her compassion in 1347, when she successfully persuaded the King to spare the lives of the Burghers of Calais. This popularity helped maintain peace in England throughout their long reign.

==Childhood==

Philippa was born on 24 June c.1310/15, in Valenciennes, Low Countries. She was one of eight children and the second of five daughters born from William I, Count of Hainaut, and Joan of Valois, granddaughter of King Philip III of France. The Royal House of Valois was a cadet branch of the Capetian dynasty, also known as the House of France.

King Edward II decided that an alliance with Flanders would benefit England and sent Bishop Stapledon of Exeter on the Continent as an ambassador. On his journey, he crossed into the county of Hainaut to inspect the daughters of Count William of Hainaut, to determine which daughter would be the most suitable as an eventual bride for young Prince Edward. The bishop&#x27;s report to the King describes one of the Count&#x27;s daughters in detail. A later annotation says it describes Philippa as a child, but historian Ian Mortimer argues that it is actually an account of her older sister Margaret. The description runs:
Growing up in the Low Countries in the period when this region was growing into a major trading centre, Philippa was well versed in finances and diplomacy. Her older sister Margaret succeeded their brother William II, Count of Hainaut, upon his death in battle. The counties of Holland, Zeeland and the seigniory of Frisia were devolved to Margaret after agreement between the sisters.

Four years later, in the summer of 1326, Isabella of France, the Queen of England, arrived at the court of Hainaut to seek aid from Count William in order to depose her husband, Edward II, from the throne. Prince Edward had accompanied his mother to Hainaut, where she arranged the betrothal to 13-year-old Philippa in exchange for assistance. As the couple were second cousins (as great-grandchildren of Philip III of France), a papal dispensation was required; and sent from Pope John XXII at Avignon in September 1327. Philippa&#x27;s retinue arrived in England in December, escorted by her uncle John of Hainaut. On 23 December, she reached London where a &quot;rousing reception was accorded her&quot;.

==Queen of England==
===First years===
In October 1327, Philippa married Edward by proxy through the Bishop of Coventry in Valenciennes. The official marriage was at York Minster on 24 January 1328, eleven months after Edward&#x27;s accession to the English throne; although the de facto rulers were Queen Mother Isabella and her lover, Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March, who jointly acted as his regents. Soon after their marriage, the couple retired to live at Woodstock Palace in Oxfordshire. Unlike many of her predecessors, Philippa did not alienate the English people by retaining her foreign retinue or bringing large numbers of foreigners to the English court. In August, her dower was fixed. She became a patron of the chronicler Jean Froissart and owned several illuminated manuscripts, one of which currently is housed in the national library in Paris. Froissart began to describe her as &quot;The most gentle Queen, most liberal, and most courteous that ever was Queen in her days.&quot;

As Isabella did not wish to relinquish her own status, Philippa&#x27;s coronation was postponed for two years. She was crowned queen on 18 February 1330 at Westminster Abbey, when she was almost five months pregnant. She gave birth to her first son, Edward, the following June. In October 1330, King Edward commenced his personal rule by staging a coup and ordering the arrest of the regents. Shortly afterward, Mortimer was executed for treason and then the Queen Mother was sent to Castle Rising in Norfolk, where she spent a number of years under house arrest but with her privileges and freedom of movement eventually restored.

She was invested as a Lady of the Order of the Garter (LG) in 1358.

===Political influence===

Philippa proved to be the model of a queen and worked tirelessly for the crown, maintaining balance between royal and familial duties admired in tumultuous times. She was widely loved and respected as a queen who managed to have a successful marriage with Edward.

As the financial demands of the recent Hundred Years&#x27; War were enormous, Philippa wisely advised the King to take interest in the nation&#x27;s commercial expansion as a different method of covering the expenses. She established the textile industry in Norwich by encouraging Flemish weavers to settle there and promoted coal mining in Tynedale.

She was appointed to serve as regent in 1346, while her husband was away for the Hundred Years&#x27; War.

In 1364 or 1365, Edward III demanded the return of Hainaut and other inheritances which had been given over to the dukes of Bavaria–Straubing in the name of Philippa, but he was unsuccessful as the custom in those regions favoured male heirs.

===Military campaigns===

Philippa served as regent of England during the absence of her spouse in 1346. Facing a Scottish invasion, she gathered the English army, fought the Scots at the Battle of Neville&#x27;s Cross near Durham, and rallied the English soldiers on horse before them prior to the battle. This event resulted in an English victory and the Scottish King David II being taken prisoner, and held captive for eleven years.

Philippa accompanied her husband on expeditions to Scotland and the rest of Europe in the early campaigns of the Hundred Years War, where she won acclaim for her gentle nature and compassion. She was also remembered for persuading her husband to spare the lives of the Burghers of Calais, whom he had planned to execute as an example to the townspeople following his successful siege of that port.

==Death and burial==

On 15 August 1369, Queen Philippa died of an illness similar to oedema in Windsor Castle. She was given a state funeral six months later on 9 January 1370 and was interred at Westminster Abbey. Her alabaster effigy was executed by sculptor Jean de Liège. Her tomb was placed on the northeast side of the Chapel of Edward the Confessor and on the opposite side of her husband&#x27;s grandparents, Edward I and Eleanor of Castile. Eight years later, Edward III died and was buried next to Philippa. By all accounts, their forty-year marriage had been happy.

The Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford was founded by her chaplain Robert de Eglesfield in her honour.

==Issue==

Philippa and Edward had thirteen children, including five sons who lived into adulthood. Three of their children died of the Black Death in 1348. The rivalry of their numerous descendants would bring about the long-running and bloody dynastic wars known as the Wars of the Roses in the 15th century.

==In popular culture==
Philippa is a character in &quot;The Accursed Kings&quot;, a series of French historical novels by Maurice Druon. She was portrayed by Françoise Burgi in the 1972 French miniseries adaptation of the series, and by Marie de Villepin in the 2005 adaptation.

In 2003, she was voted as 5th on the list of 100 Great Black Britons. However, the decision to include her on the list has been criticised, with many historians noting that there was no evidence that suggested Philippa has any African ancestry.

<text>The following list in mathematics contains the finite groups of small order up to group isomorphism.

== Counts ==
For &quot;n&quot; = 1, 2, … the number of nonisomorphic groups of order &quot;n&quot; is
: 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 5, 2, 2, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 14, 1, 5, 1, 5, ... 
For labeled groups, see .

== Glossary ==
Each group is named by Small Groups library as G&quot;o&quot;&quot;i&quot;, where &quot;o&quot; is the order of the group, and &quot;i&quot; is the index used to label the group within that order.

Common group names:
* Z&quot;n&quot;: the cyclic group of order &quot;n&quot; (the notation C&quot;n&quot; is also used; it is isomorphic to the additive group of Z/&quot;n&quot;Z)
* Dih&quot;n&quot;: the dihedral group of order 2&quot;n&quot; (often the notation D&quot;n&quot; or D2&quot;n&quot; is used)
** K4: the Klein four-group of order 4, same as and Dih2
* D2&quot;n&quot;: the dihedral group of order 2&quot;n&quot;, the same as Dih&quot;n&quot; (notation used in section List of small non-abelian groups)
* S&quot;n&quot;: the symmetric group of degree &quot;n&quot;, containing the &quot;n&quot;! permutations of &quot;n&quot; elements
* A&quot;n&quot;: the alternating group of degree &quot;n&quot;, containing the even permutations of &quot;n&quot; elements, of order 1 for , and order &quot;n&quot;!/2 otherwise
* Dic&quot;n&quot; or Q4&quot;n&quot;: the dicyclic group of order 4&quot;n&quot;
** Q8: the quaternion group of order 8, also Dic2

The notations Z&quot;n&quot; and Dih&quot;n&quot; have the advantage that point groups in three dimensions C&quot;n&quot; and D&quot;n&quot; do not have the same notation. There are more isometry groups than these two, of the same abstract group type.

The notation denotes the direct product of the two groups; &quot;G&quot;&quot;n&quot; denotes the direct product of a group with itself &quot;n&quot; times. &quot;G&quot; ⋊ &quot;H&quot; denotes a semidirect product where &quot;H&quot; acts on &quot;G&quot;; this may also depend on the choice of action of &quot;H&quot; on &quot;G&quot;.

Abelian and simple groups are noted. (For groups of order , the simple groups are precisely the cyclic groups Z&quot;n&quot;, for prime &quot;n&quot;.) The equality sign (&quot;=&quot;) denotes isomorphism.

The identity element in the cycle graphs is represented by the black circle. The lowest order for which the cycle graph does not uniquely represent a group is order 16.

In the lists of subgroups, the trivial group and the group itself are not listed. Where there are several isomorphic subgroups, the number of such subgroups is indicated in parentheses.

Angle brackets &lt;relations&gt; show the presentation of a group.

== List of small abelian groups ==
The finite abelian groups are either cyclic groups, or direct products thereof; see Abelian group. The numbers of nonisomorphic abelian groups of orders &quot;n&quot; = 1, 2, ... are
: 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 2, ... 
For labeled abelian groups, see .

== List of small non-abelian groups==
The numbers of non-abelian groups, by order, are counted by . However, many orders have no non-abelian groups. The orders for which a non-abelian group exists are
: 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, 26, 27, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 39, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, ... 

==Classifying groups of small order==

Small groups of prime power order &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot; are given as follows:
*Order &quot;p&quot;: The only group is cyclic.
*Order &quot;p&quot;2: There are just two groups, both abelian.
*Order &quot;p&quot;3: There are three abelian groups, and two non-abelian groups. One of the non-abelian groups is the semidirect product of a normal cyclic subgroup of order &quot;p&quot;2 by a cyclic group of order &quot;p&quot;. The other is the quaternion group for and a group of exponent &quot;p&quot; for . 
*Order &quot;p&quot;4: The classification is complicated, and gets much harder as the exponent of &quot;p&quot; increases.

Most groups of small order have a Sylow &quot;p&quot; subgroup &quot;P&quot; with a normal &quot;p&quot;-complement &quot;N&quot; for some prime &quot;p&quot; dividing the order, so can be classified in terms of the possible primes &quot;p&quot;, &quot;p&quot;-groups &quot;P&quot;, groups &quot;N&quot;, and actions of &quot;P&quot; on &quot;N&quot;. In some sense this reduces the classification of these groups to the classification of &quot;p&quot;-groups. Some of the small groups that do not have a normal &quot;p&quot;-complement include:
*Order 24: The symmetric group S4
*Order 48: The binary octahedral group and the product 
*Order 60: The alternating group A5.

The smallest order for which it is &quot;not&quot; known how many nonisomorphic groups there are is 2048 = 211.

==Small Groups Library==
The GAP computer algebra system contains a package called the &quot;Small Groups library,&quot; which provides access to descriptions of small order groups. The groups are listed up to isomorphism. At present, the library contains the following groups:
* those of order at most 2000 except for order 1024 ( groups in the library; the ones of order 1024 had to be skipped, as there are additional nonisomorphic 2-groups of order 1024);
* those of cubefree order at most 50000 (395 703 groups);
* those of squarefree order;
* those of order &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot; for &quot;n&quot; at most 6 and &quot;p&quot; prime;
* those of order &quot;p&quot;7 for &quot;p&quot; = 3, 5, 7, 11 (907 489 groups);
* those of order &quot;pq&quot;&quot;n&quot; where &quot;q&quot;&quot;n&quot; divides 28, 36, 55 or 74 and &quot;p&quot; is an arbitrary prime which differs from &quot;q&quot;;
* those whose orders factorise into at most 3 primes (not necessarily distinct).

It contains explicit descriptions of the available groups in computer readable format.

The smallest order for which the Small Groups library does not have information is 1024.

<text>Hitchhiking (also known as thumbing, autostop or hitching) is a means of transportation that is gained by asking individuals, usually strangers, for a ride in their car or other vehicle. The ride is usually, but not always, free.

==Signaling methods==

Hitchhikers use a variety of signals to indicate they need a ride. Indicators can be physical gestures or displays including written signs. The physical gestures, e.g., hand signals, hitchhikers use differ around the world: 
*In some African countries, the hitchhiker&#x27;s hand is held with the palm facing upwards.
*In most of Europe, North America, South America and Australia, most hitchhikers stand with their back facing the direction of travel. The hitchhiker typically extends their arm towards the road with the thumb of the closed hand pointing upward or in the direction of vehicle travel. 

==Legal status==

Hitchhiking is historically a common practice worldwide and hence there are very few places in the world where laws exist to restrict it. However, a minority of countries have laws that restrict hitchhiking at certain locations. In the United States, for example, some local governments have laws outlawing hitchhiking, on the basis of drivers&#x27; and hitchhikers&#x27; safety. In Canada, several highways have restrictions on hitchhiking, particularly in British Columbia and the 400-series highways in Ontario. In all countries in Europe, it is legal to hitchhike and in some places even encouraged. However, worldwide, even where hitchhiking is permitted, laws forbid hitchhiking where pedestrians are banned, such as the Autobahn (Germany), Autostrade (Italy), motorways (United Kingdom and continental Europe, with the exception of, at least, Lithuania) or interstate highways (United States), although hitchhikers often obtain rides at entrances and truck stops where it is legal at least throughout Europe with the exception of Italy.

==Community==
In recent years, hitchhikers have started efforts to strengthen their community. Examples include the annual Hitchgathering, an event organized by hitchhikers, for hitchhikers, and websites such as hitchwiki, which are platforms for hitchhikers to share tips and provide a way of looking up good hitchhiking spots around the world.

==Decline==
In 2011, &quot;Freakonomics Radio&quot; reviewed sparse data about hitchhiking, and identified a steady decline in hitchhiking in the US since the 1970s, which it attributed to a number of factors, including a greater lack of trust of strangers, lower air travel costs due to deregulation, the presence of more money in the economy to pay for travel and more numerous and more reliable cars. A marked increase in fear of hitchhiking is thought to have been spurred by movies such as &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; (1974), &quot;The Hitcher&quot; (1986), and a few real incidents involving imperiled hitchhikers, including the kidnapping of Colleen Stan in California. See , below.

Some British researchers discuss reasons for hitchhiking&#x27;s decline in the UK, and possible means of reviving it in safer and more-organized forms.

==Public policy support==
Since the mid-2010s, local authorities in rural areas in Germany have started to support hitchhiking, and this has spread to Austria and the German-speaking region of Belgium. The objectives are both social and environmental: as ride sharing improves mobility for local residents (particularly young and old people without their own cars) in places where public transport is inadequate, thus improving networking among local communities in an environmentally friendly way. This support typically takes the form of providing hitchhiking benches (in German &quot;Mitfahrbänke&quot;) where people hoping for a ride can wait for cars. These benches are usually brightly coloured and located at the exit from a village, sometimes at an existing bus stop lay-by where vehicles can pull in safely. Some are even provided with large fold-out or slide-out signs with place names allowing hitchers to clearly signal where they want to go. Some &quot;Mitfahrbänke&quot; have been installed with the help of the EU&#x27;s LEADER programme for rural local development

In Austria, &quot;Mitfahrbänke&quot; are especially common in Lower Austria and Tyrol, and are promoted by the Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Regions and Tourism under its &quot;klimaaktiv&quot; climate protection initiative. In 2018 the Tyrolean &quot;MobilitäterInnen&quot; network published a &quot;Manual for the Successful Introduction of Hitch-hiking Benches&quot;.

==Safety==
Limited data is available regarding the safety of hitchhiking. Compiling good safety data requires counting hitchhikers, counting rides, and counting problems, all difficult tasks.

Two studies on the topic include a 1974 California Highway Patrol study and a 1989 German federal police (Bundeskriminalamt Wiesbaden) study. The California study found that hitchhikers were not disproportionately likely to be victims of crime. The German study concluded that the actual risk is much lower than the publicly perceived risk; the authors did not advise against hitchhiking in general. They found that in some cases there were verbal disputes or inappropriate comments, but physical attacks were very rare.

Recommended safety practices include:
* Asking for rides at gas stations instead of signaling at the roadside
* Refusing rides from alcohol impaired drivers
* Hitchhiking during daylight hours
* Trusting one&#x27;s instincts
* Traveling with another hitchhiker; this measure decreases the likelihood of harm by a factor of six.

In the UK, The Scout Association specifically lists hitchhiking as an activity not permitted at any scouting event.

==Around the world==
===Cuba===
In Cuba, picking up hitchhikers is mandatory for government vehicles, if passenger space is available. Hitchhiking is encouraged, as Cuba has few cars, and hitchhikers use designated spots. Drivers pick up waiting riders on a first come, first served basis.

===Israel===

In Israel, hitchhiking is commonplace at designated locations called ( in Hebrew, derived from the German ). Travelers soliciting rides, called , wait at , typically junctions of highways or main roads outside of a city.

===Poland===
Hitchhiking in Poland has a long history and is still popular. It was legalised and formalised in 1957 so hitchhikers could buy booklets including coupons from travel agencies. These coupons were given to drivers who took hitchhikers. By the end of each season drivers who collected the highest number of coupons could exchange them for prizes, and others took part in a lottery. This so-called &quot;Akcja Autostop&quot; was popular till the end of the 1970s, but the sale of the booklet was discontinued in 1995.

===United States===
Hitchhiking became a common method of traveling during the Great Depression and during the 
counterculture of the 1960s.

Warnings of the potential dangers of picking up hitchhikers were publicized to drivers, who were advised that some hitchhikers would rob drivers and, in some cases, sexually assault or murder them. Other warnings were publicized to the hitchhikers themselves, alerting them to the same types of crimes being carried out by drivers. Still, hitchhiking was part of the American psyche and many people continued to stick out their thumbs, even in states where the practice had been outlawed.

Today, hitchhiking is legal in 44 of the 50 states, provided that the hitchhiker is not standing in the roadway or otherwise hindering the normal flow of traffic. Even in states where hitchhiking is illegal, hitchhikers are rarely ticketed. For example, the Wyoming Highway Patrol approached 524 hitchhikers in 2010, but only eight of them were cited (hitchhiking was subsequently legalized in Wyoming in 2013).

<doc id="47762" wikidata="Q580513" url="?curid=47762" title="Oliver Hazard Perry">
<text>Oliver Hazard Perry (August 23, 1785 – August 23, 1819) was a United States Navy officer from South Kingstown, Rhode Island. A prominent member of the Perry family naval dynasty, he was the son of Sarah Wallace Alexander and Captain Christopher Raymond Perry, and older brother of Commodore Matthew C. Perry.

Perry served in the West Indies during the Quasi War of 1798–1800 against France, in the Mediterranean during the Barbary Wars of 1801–1815, and in the Caribbean fighting piracy and the slave trade, but is most noted for his role in the War of 1812 during the 1813 Battle of Lake Erie. During the war against Britain, Perry supervised the building of a fleet at Erie, Pennsylvania. He earned the title &quot;Hero of Lake Erie&quot; for leading American forces in a decisive naval victory at the Battle of Lake Erie, receiving a Congressional Gold Medal and the Thanks of Congress.

His leadership materially aided the successful outcomes of all nine Lake Erie military campaign victories, and the victory was a turning point in the battle for the west in the war. He is remembered for the words on his battle flag, &quot;Dont Give Up the Ship&quot;, which was a tribute to the dying command of his colleague Captain James Lawrence of USS &quot;Chesapeake&quot;. He is also known for his message to General William Henry Harrison which reads in part, &quot;We have met the enemy and they are ours; ...&quot;

Perry became embroiled in a long-standing and bitter controversy with the commander of , Captain Jesse Elliott, over their conduct in the Battle of Lake Erie, and both were the subject of official charges. In 1815, he successfully commanded in the Mediterranean during the Second Barbary War. So seminal was his career that he was lionized in the press (being the subject of scores of books and articles). He has been frequently memorialized, and many places, ships and persons have been named in his honor.

==Childhood and early life==
Perry was the oldest of five boys born to Christopher (1761–1818) and Sarah Wallace Perry (née Alexander) (1763–1830). As a boy, Perry lived in Tower Hill, Rhode Island, sailing ships in anticipation of his future career as an officer in the United States Navy. Perry came from a long line of naval men from both sides of his family. His mother taught Perry and his younger brothers to read and write and had them attend Trinity Episcopal Church regularly, where he was baptized by Reverend William Smith on April 1, 1794, at the age of nine. Reverend Theodore Dehon, rector of the church from 1797 to 1810, had a significant influence on the young Perry. He was educated in Newport, Rhode Island. His earliest ancestor to the Americas was Edward Perry, who came from Devon, England, and settled in Sandwich, Massachusetts, around 1650 with his wife, Mary Freeman.

==Early naval career==
Through his father&#x27;s influence, Perry was appointed a midshipman in the United States Navy, at the age of thirteen, on April 7, 1799. Perry sailed aboard , of which his father was commanding officer, on her maiden voyage in June 1799. The ship made its first stop in Cuba, charged with receiving American merchant ships and providing escort from Havana to the United States. Perry&#x27;s service aboard &quot;General Greene&quot; continued during the Quasi-War with France. He first experienced combat on February 9, 1800, off the coast of the French colony of Haiti, which was in a state of rebellion.

During the First Barbary War, he served aboard and later was first lieutenant (second in command) of . He then served under Captain John Rodgers on and USS &quot;Essex&quot;. He was placed in charge of the construction of gunboats in Newport and Westerly, Rhode Island

Beginning in April 1809, he commanded the sloop , engaging in patrol duties to enforce the Embargo Act, as well as a successful raid to regain an American ship held in Spanish territory in Florida. On January 9, 1811, &quot;Revenge&quot; ran aground off Rhode Island and was lost. &quot;Seeing fairly quickly that he could not save the vessel, [Perry] turned his attention to saving the crew, and after helping them down the ropes over the vessel&#x27;s stern, he was the last to leave the vessel.&quot; The subsequent court-martial exonerated Perry, placing blame on the ship&#x27;s pilot. In January 2011, a team of divers claimed to have discovered the remains of &quot;Revenge&quot;, nearly 200 years to the day after it sank. Cannons from &quot;Revenge&quot; were salvaged by the U.S. Navy in 2017.

Following the court-martial, Perry was given a leave of absence from the Navy. On May 5, 1811, he married Elizabeth Champlin Mason of Newport, Rhode Island, whom he had met at a dance in 1807. They enjoyed an extended honeymoon touring New England. The couple would eventually have five children, with one dying in infancy.

==War of 1812==

At the beginning of the War of 1812, the British Royal Navy controlled the Great Lakes, except for Lake Huron. The United States Navy controlled Lake Champlain. The American naval forces were very small, allowing the British to make many advances in the Great Lakes and northern New York waterways. The roles played by commanders like Perry, at Lake Erie and Isaac Chauncey at Lake Ontario and Thomas Macdonough at Lake Champlain all proved vital to the naval effort.

Naval historian E. B. Potter noted that &quot;all naval officers of the day made a special study of Nelson&#x27;s battles.&quot; Oliver Perry was no exception.
At his request, he was given command of the American naval forces on Lake Erie during the war. Secretary of the Navy Paul Hamilton had charged prominent merchant seaman Daniel Dobbins with building the American fleet on Presque Isle Bay at Erie, Pennsylvania, and Perry was named chief naval officer.

Perry knew battle was coming, and he &quot;consciously followed Nelson&#x27;s example in describing his battle plans to his captains.&quot; Perry&#x27;s instructions were:

===Hero of Lake Erie===
On September 10, 1813, Perry&#x27;s command fought a successful fleet action against a squadron of the Royal Navy in the Battle of Lake Erie. It was at the outset of this battle that Perry famously said, &quot;If a victory is to be gained, I will gain it.&quot; Initially, the exchange of gunfire favored the British. Perry&#x27;s flagship, , was so severely disabled in the encounter that the British commander, Robert Heriot Barclay, thought that Perry would surrender it, and sent a small boat to request that the American vessel pull down its flag.

Faithful to the words of his battle flag, &quot;DONT GIVE UP THE SHIP&quot;, a paraphrase of the dying words of Captain James Lawrence, the ship&#x27;s namesake and Perry&#x27;s friend, Perry, with &quot;Lawrence&quot;″s chaplain and purser as the remaining able crew, personally fired the final salvo. He then had his men row him a half-mile (0.8 km) through heavy gunfire to transfer his command to . Once aboard, Perry dispatched &quot;Niagara&quot; commander, Captain Jesse Elliott, to bring the other schooners into closer action while he steered &quot;Niagara&quot; toward the damaged British ships. Like Nelson&#x27;s at Trafalgar, &quot;Niagara&quot; broke the opposing line.

Perry&#x27;s force pounded Barclay&#x27;s ships until they could offer no effective resistance and surrendered. Although he had won the battle aboard &quot;Niagara&quot;, he received the British surrender on the deck of the recaptured &quot;Lawrence&quot; to allow the British to see the terrible price his men had paid. Perry&#x27;s battle report to General William Henry Harrison was famously brief: &quot;We have met the enemy and they are ours; two ships, two brigs, one schooner and one sloop.&quot; The six captured ships were successfully returned to Presque Isle.

Although the engagement was small compared to Napoleonic naval battles such as the Battle of Trafalgar, the victory had disproportionate strategic importance, opening Canada up to possible invasion, while simultaneously protecting the entire Ohio Valley. The loss of the British squadron directly led to the critical Battle of the Thames, the rout of British and Indian forces by Harrison&#x27;s army, the deaths of Tecumseh and Roundhead, and the breakup of his indigenous alliance. Along with the Battle of Plattsburgh, it was one of only two significant fleet victories of the war.

Perry was involved in nine battles that led to and followed the Battle of Lake Erie, and they all had a seminal impact. &quot;What is often overlooked when studying Perry is how his physical participation and brilliant strategic leadership influenced the outcomes of all nine Lake Erie military campaign victories:

 Capturing Fort George, Ontario in the Battle of Fort George; Destroying the British munitions at Olde Fort Erie (see Capture of Fort Erie); Rescuing five vessels from Black Rock; Building the Erie fleet; Getting the ships over the sandbar; Blocking British supplies for a month prior to battle; Planning the Thames invasion with General Harrison; Winning the Battle of Lake Erie; and Winning the Battle of Thames.

===The Battle Flag===

&quot;Dont give up the ship!&quot; became the battle cry of Oliver Hazard Perry. The phrase was uttered by Captain James Lawrence as he died after being wounded by enemy fire aboard the &quot;Chesapeake&quot; on June 1, 1813. Perry learned of Lawrence&#x27;s demise at Presque Isle. He honored Lawrence with the name of a brig, called &quot;Lawrence&quot;. A battle flag was needed, and the words of Perry&#x27;s good friend were suited for the coming days.

Margaret Forster Steuart was enlisted to make the battle flag. She was a resident of Erie Pennsylvania, wife of Army Captain Thomas Steuart and sister to Thomas Forster, both friends of Perry&#x27;s. Forster was the commander of the Erie Light Infantry that had guarded the fleet. With the help of her two daughters, three nieces, and a cousin, she had the flag ready for Perry within just a few days. As of July 2009, Perry&#x27;s flag, Steuart&#x27;s work, and Lawrence&#x27;s dying words can be seen today, with the flag on display in Bancroft Hall&#x27;s Memorial Hall at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis.

===Perry–Elliott controversy===

While Nelson had Collingwood, Perry had Jesse Elliott, and was considerably less well served. Elliott, while serving with Isaac Chauncey at Lake Ontario, was tasked to augment Perry&#x27;s squadron with 11 officers and 91 men, &quot;and none were sent but the worst.&quot; Subsequently, detailed by Chauncey to command &quot;Niagara,&quot; Elliott stated &quot;that if he could have foreseen that he himself should be sent to Lake Erie, his selections would have been different.&quot; Elliott then appropriated the &quot;best of the worst&quot; for &quot;Niagara&quot;; and Perry &quot;in the interest of harmony&quot; accepted the situation, though with growing ill-will.

In his initial post-action report, Perry had praised Captain Elliott&#x27;s role in the American victory at Lake Erie; and as news of the battle spread, Perry and Elliott were both celebrated as national heroes. Soon after, however, several junior officers publicly criticized Elliott&#x27;s performance during the battle, charging that Elliott allowed &quot;Lawrence&quot; to suffer the brunt of the British fire while holding &quot;Niagara&quot; back from the fight. William Vigneron Taylor, Perry&#x27;s sailing master, in a letter to Taylor&#x27;s wife, put it thus:

The meeting between Elliott and Perry on the deck of &quot;Niagara&quot; was terse. Elliott inquired how the day was going. Perry replied, &quot;Badly.&quot; Elliott then volunteered to take Perry&#x27;s small boat and rally the schooners, and Perry acquiesced. As Perry turned &quot;Niagara&quot; into the battle, Elliott was not aboard. Elliott&#x27;s rejoinder to history&#x27;s criticism of inaction was that there had been a lack of effective signaling. Charges were filed, but not officially acted upon. Attempting to restore his honor, Elliott and his supporters began a 30-year campaign that would outlive both men and ultimately leave his reputation in tatters.

In Perry&#x27;s report to Secretary of the Navy William Jones, written three days after the battle, he mentioned Elliott in what, at first, seem to be complimentary terms, but, when read carefully, betray his disdain for Elliott. Perry wrote, &quot;In this action he evinced his characteristic bravery and judgement; and, since the close of the action, has given me the most able and essential assistance.&quot;

===Congressional Gold Medal===

On January 6, 1814, Perry was honored with a Congressional Gold Medal, the Thanks of Congress, and a promotion to the rank of Captain. This was one of 27 Gold Medals authorized by Congress arising from the War of 1812.

:(Valor finds or makes a way. Between the Fleets of America and Britain September 10, 1813.)

Elliott was also recognized with a Congressional Gold Medal and the Thanks of Congress for his actions in the battle. This recognition would prove to fan the flames of resentment on both sides of the Elliott–Perry controversy.

In recognition of his victory at Lake Erie, in 1813 Perry was elected as an honorary member of the New York Society of the Cincinnati.

==Later commands and controversies==
In May 1814, Perry took command of a squadron of seven gunboats based in Newport. He held this command for only two months as in July he was placed in command of , a 44-gun frigate which was under construction in Baltimore. While overseeing the outfitting of &quot;Java&quot;, Perry participated in the defenses of Baltimore and Washington, D.C., during the British invasion of the Chesapeake Bay. In a twist of irony, these land battles would be the last time the career naval officer saw combat. The Treaty of Ghent was signed before &quot;Java&quot; could be put to sea.

For Perry, the post-war years were marred by controversies. In 1815, he commanded &quot;Java&quot; in the Mediterranean during the Second Barbary War. While moored in Naples, Perry slapped the commander of the ship&#x27;s Marines, Captain John Heath, whom Perry charged with &quot;disrespectful, insolent, and contemptuous conduct to me his superior officer&quot;. The ensuing court-martial found both men guilty, but levied only mild reprimands. After the crew returned home, Heath challenged Perry to a pistol duel, which was fought on October 19, 1817, on the same field in Weehawken, New Jersey where Aaron Burr shot and killed Alexander Hamilton. Heath fired first and missed. Perry declined to return fire, satisfying the Marine&#x27;s honor.

Perry&#x27;s return from the Mediterranean also reignited the feud with Elliott. After an exchange of angry letters, Elliott challenged Perry to a duel, which Perry refused. (While it was normally considered cowardly to refuse a duel, Perry&#x27;s stature as a hero was such that no one doubted his physical courage and few felt that Perry had wrongly offended Elliott&#x27;s honor.) He instead, on August 8, 1818, filed formal court-martial charges against Elliott. Perry filed a total of six charges and twenty-one specifications including &quot;conduct unbecoming an officer,&quot; and failure to &quot;do his utmost to take or destroy the vessel of the enemy which it was his duty to encounter.&quot;

Wishing to avoid a scandal between two decorated naval heroes, Secretary of the Navy Smith Thompson and President James Monroe suppressed the matter by offering Perry a diplomatic mission to South America in exchange for dropping his charges. This put an official end to the controversy, though it would continue to be debated for another quarter century.

==Mission to Venezuela and death==

In 1818 Perry purchased a large house on Washington Square in Newport which was built in 1750 for merchant Peter Buloid. The house remained in the Perry family until 1865 and now serves as an antique bookstore.


In 1819, Perry sailed for the Orinoco River, Venezuela, aboard of the frigate with the frigate and the schooner , arriving on July 15 to discourage piracy, while still maintaining friendly relations with Republic of Venezuela and the Republic of Buenos Aires. Shifting his flag to USS &quot;Nonsuch&quot;, due to its shallower draft, Perry sailed upriver to Angostura to negotiate an anti-piracy agreement with President Simón Bolívar. A favorable treaty was signed on August 11 with Vice-President Francisco Antonio Zea in the absence of Bolivar (who was engaged in the liberation of New Granada), but when the schooner started downriver, many of her crew, including Perry, had been stricken with yellow fever.

Despite the crew&#x27;s efforts to reach Trinidad for medical assistance, the commodore died on board USS &quot;Nonsuch&quot; on August 23, 1819, his 34th birthday, as the ship entered the Gulf of Paria and was nearing Port of Spain. He was buried in Port of Spain with great honors while the &quot;Nonsuch&quot;″s crew acted as honor guard.

His remains were later taken back to the United States in 1826 and interred in Newport, Rhode Island. Originally interred in the Old Common Burial Ground, his body was eventually moved to Newport&#x27;s Island Cemetery.

Perry Street in Savannah, Georgia, is named in his honor.

==Family==


Perry married Elizabeth Champlin Mason in 1811. They had five children, four of whom lived to maturity. They were:

# Brigadier General Christopher Grant Champlin Perry, RIM (April 2, 1812 – April 5, 1854), commander of the Artillery Company of Newport from 1845 to 1854, m. Murial Frances Sergeant of Philadelphia (great-granddaughter of Benjamin Franklin); their daughter Margaret Mason Perry married the artist John LaFarge;
# Oliver Hazard Perry II (February 23, 1813 – March 4, 1814), died in infancy;
# Lieutenant Oliver Hazard Perry, Jr., USN (February 23, 1815 – August 20, 1878), m. 1) Elizabeth Ann Randolph (1816–1847) (Virginia Randolph family) and m. 2) Mary Ann Moseley;
# First Lieutenant Christopher Raymond Perry, USA (June 29, 1816 – October 8, 1848), never married;
# Elizabeth Mason Perry, m., as his 2nd wife, the Reverend Francis Vinton, rector of Trinity Episcopal Church in Newport.

Perry&#x27;s son Christopher Grant Champlin Perry was a physician, and served as commander of the Artillery Company of Newport from April 1848 until his death in 1854. In May 1849 he was commissioned as a brigadier general in the Rhode Island Militia and given command of the 1st Brigade encompassing Newport and Bristol Counties.

Perry&#x27;s son Oliver Hazard Perry, Jr. entered the Navy as a midshipman in 1829, rose to the rank of lieutenant and resigned in 1849. He served on the United States Exploring Expedition under Captain Charles Wilkes from 1839 to 1842. Although he is buried in the same cemetery as his parents, for unknown reasons, he is not buried in the same plot with his parents.

Perry&#x27;s son Christopher Raymond Perry graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1842. He served during the Mexican War and fought at the Battle of Palo Alto on May 8, 1846, and at the Battle of Resaca-de‑la‑Palma on May 9, 1846. He died on active duty as a 1st lieutenant in 1848.

==Dates of rank==

* Midshipman – April 7, 1799
* Lieutenant – January 15, 1807
* Master Commandant – August 28, 1812
* Captain – September 10, 1813

Although Perry is often referred to as &quot;Commodore Perry,&quot; it should be kept in mind that, prior to the American Civil War, commodore was not a rank in the U.S. Navy but, rather, the title of an officer in command of a squadron of two or more ships. Perry first held the title of commodore when he took command of the Lake Erie squadron in 1813.

<doc id="47763" wikidata="Q753291" url="?curid=47763" title="Environmental economics">
<text>Environmental economics is a sub-field of economics concerned with environmental issues. It has become a widely studied subject due to growing environmental concerns in the twenty-first century. Environmental economics &quot;undertakes theoretical or empirical studies of the economic effects of national or local environmental policies around the world. ... Particular issues include the costs and benefits of alternative environmental policies to deal with air pollution, water quality, toxic substances, solid waste, and global warming.&quot;

Environmental economics is distinguished from ecological economics in that ecological economics emphasizes the economy as a subsystem of the ecosystem with its focus upon preserving natural capital. One survey of German economists found that ecological and environmental economics are different schools of economic thought, with ecological economists emphasizing &quot;strong&quot; sustainability and rejecting the proposition that human-made (&quot;physical&quot;) capital can substitute for natural capital.

== History ==
The modern field of environmental economics has been traced to the 1960s with significant contribution from Post-Keynesian economist Paul Davidson, who had just completed a management position with the Continental Oil Company.

== Topics and concepts ==
=== Market failure ===

Central to environmental economics is the concept of market failure. Market failure means that markets fail to allocate resources efficiently. As stated by Hanley, Shogren, and White (2007): &quot;A market failure occurs when the market does not allocate scarce resources to generate the greatest social welfare. A wedge exists between what a private person does given market prices and what society might want him or her to do to protect the environment. Such a wedge implies wastefulness or economic inefficiency; resources can be reallocated to make at least one person better off without making anyone else worse off.&quot; This results in a inefficient market that needs to be corrected through avenues such as government intervention. Common forms of market failure include externalities, non-excludability and non-rivalry.

=== Externality ===
An externality exists when a person makes a choice that affects other people in a way that is not accounted for in the market price. An externality can be positive or negative but is usually associated with negative externalities in environmental economics. For instance, water seepage in residential buildings occurring in upper floors affect the lower floors. Another example concerns how the sale of Amazon timber disregards the amount of carbon dioxide released in the cutting. Or a firm emitting pollution will typically not take into account the costs that its pollution imposes on others. As a result, pollution may occur in excess of the &#x27;socially efficient&#x27; level, which is the level that would exist if the market was required to account for the pollution. A classic definition influenced by Kenneth Arrow and James Meade is provided by Heller and Starrett (1976), who define an externality as &quot;a situation in which the private economy lacks sufficient incentives to create a potential market in some good and the nonexistence of this market results in losses of Pareto efficiency&quot;. In economic terminology, externalities are examples of market failures, in which the unfettered market does not lead to an efficient outcome.

=== Common goods and public goods ===
When it is too costly to exclude some people from access to an environmental resource, the resource is either called a common property resource (when there is rivalry for the resource, such that one person&#x27;s use of the resource reduces others&#x27; opportunity to use the resource) or a public good (when use of the resource is non-rivalrous). In either case of non-exclusion, market allocation is likely to be inefficient.

These challenges have long been recognized. Hardin&#x27;s (1968) concept of the tragedy of the commons popularized the challenges involved in non-exclusion and common property. &quot;Commons&quot; refers to the environmental asset itself, &quot;common property resource&quot; or &quot;common pool resource&quot; refers to a property right regime that allows for some collective body to devise schemes to exclude others, thereby allowing the capture of future benefit streams; and &quot;open-access&quot; implies no ownership in the sense that property everyone owns nobody owns.

The basic problem is that if people ignore the scarcity value of the commons, they can end up expending too much effort, over harvesting a resource (e.g., a fishery). Hardin theorizes that in the absence of restrictions, users of an open-access resource will use it more than if they had to pay for it and had exclusive rights, leading to environmental degradation. See, however, Ostrom&#x27;s (1990) work on how people using real common property resources have worked to establish self-governing rules to reduce the risk of the tragedy of the commons.

The mitigation of climate change effects is an example of a public good, where the social benefits are not reflected completely in the market price. Because the personal marginal benefits are less than the social benefits the market under-provides climate change mitigation. This is a public good since the risks of climate change are both non-rival and non-excludable. Such efforts are non-rival since climate mitigation provided to one does not reduce the level of mitigation that anyone else enjoys. They are non-excludable actions as they will have global consequences from which no one can be excluded. A country&#x27;s incentive to invest in carbon abatement is reduced because it can &quot;free ride&quot; off the efforts of other countries. Over a century ago, Swedish economist Knut Wicksell (1896) first discussed how public goods can be under-provided by the market because people might conceal their preferences for the good, but still enjoy the benefits without paying for them.
=== Valuation ===
Assessing the economic value of the environment is a major topic within the field. The values of natural resources often are not reflected in prices that markets set and, in fact, many of them are available at no monetary charge. This mismatch frequently causes distortions in pricing of natural assets: both overuse of them and underinvestment in them. Economic value or tangible benefits of ecosystem services and, more generally, of natural resources, include both use and indirect (see the nature section of ecological economics). Non-use values include existence, option, and bequest values. For example, some people may value the existence of a diverse set of species, regardless of the effect of the loss of a species on ecosystem services. The existence of these species may have an option value, as there may be the possibility of using it for some human purpose. For example, certain plants may be researched for drugs. Individuals may value the ability to leave a pristine environment for their children.

Use and indirect use values can often be inferred from revealed behavior, such as the cost of taking recreational trips or using hedonic methods in which values are estimated based on observed prices. Non-use values are usually estimated using stated preference methods such as contingent valuation or choice modelling. Contingent valuation typically takes the form of surveys in which people are asked how much they would pay to observe and recreate in the environment (willingness to pay) or their willingness to accept (WTA) compensation for the destruction of the environmental good. Hedonic pricing examines the effect the environment has on economic decisions through housing prices, traveling expenses, and payments to visit parks.

=== State subsidy ===
Almost all governments and states magnify environmental harm by providing various types of subsidies that have the effect of paying companies and other economic actors more to exploit natural resources than to protect them. The damage to nature of such public subsidies has been conservatively estimated at $4-$6 trillion U.S. dollars per year.

== Solutions ==
Solutions advocated to correct such externalities include:

* &quot;Environmental regulations&quot;. Under this plan, the economic impact has to be estimated by the regulator. Usually, this is done using cost–benefit analysis. There is a growing realization that regulations (also known as &quot;command and control&quot; instruments) are not so distinct from economic instruments as is commonly asserted by proponents of environmental economics. E.g.1 regulations are enforced by fines, which operate as a form of tax if pollution rises above the threshold prescribed. E.g.2 pollution must be monitored and laws enforced, whether under a pollution tax regime or a regulatory regime. The main difference an environmental economist would argue exists between the two methods, however, is the total cost of the regulation. &quot;Command and control&quot; regulation often applies uniform emissions limits on polluters, even though each firm has different costs for emissions reductions, i.e., some firms, in this system, can abate pollution inexpensively, while others can only abate it at high cost. Because of this, the total abatement in the system comprises some expensive and some inexpensive efforts. Consequently, modern &quot;Command and control&quot; regulations are oftentimes designed in a way that addresses these issues by incorporating utility parameters. For instance, CO2 emission standards for specific manufacturers in the automotive industry are either linked to the average vehicle footprint (US system) or average vehicle weight (EU system) of their entire vehicle fleet. Environmental economic regulations find the cheapest emission abatement efforts first, and then move on to the more expensive methods. E.g. as said earlier, trading, in the quota system, means a firm only abates pollution if doing so would cost less than paying someone else to make the same reduction. This leads to a lower cost for the total abatement effort as a whole.
* &quot;Quotas on pollution&quot;. Often it is advocated that pollution reductions should be achieved by way of tradeable emissions permits, which if freely traded may ensure that reductions in pollution are achieved at least cost. In theory, if such tradeable quotas are allowed, then a firm would reduce its own pollution load only if doing so would cost less than paying someone else to make the same reduction, i.e., only if buying tradeable permits from another firm(s) is costlier. In practice, tradeable permits approaches have had some success, such as the U.S.&#x27;s sulphur dioxide trading program or the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, and interest in its application is spreading to other environmental problems.
* &quot;Taxes and tariffs on pollution&quot;. Increasing the costs of polluting will discourage polluting, and will provide a &quot;dynamic incentive&quot;, that is, the disincentive continues to operate even as pollution levels fall. A pollution tax that reduces pollution to the socially &quot;optimal&quot; level would be set at such a level that pollution occurs only if the benefits to society (for example, in form of greater production) exceeds the costs. This concept was introduced by Arthur Pigou, a British economist active in the late nineteenth through the mid-twentieth century. He showed that these externalities occur when markets fail, meaning they do not naturally produce the socially optimal amount of a good or service. He argued that “a tax on the production of paint would encourage the [polluting] factory to reduce production to the amount best for society as a whole.” These taxes are known amongst economists as Pigouvian Taxes, and they regularly implemented where negative externalities are present. Some advocate a major shift from taxation from income and sales taxes to tax on pollution – the so-called &quot;green tax shift&quot;.
* &quot;Better defined property rights&quot;. The Coase Theorem states that assigning property rights will lead to an optimal solution, regardless of who receives them, if transaction costs are trivial and the number of parties negotiating is limited. For example, if people living near a factory had a right to clean air and water, or the factory had the right to pollute, then either the factory could pay those affected by the pollution or the people could pay the factory not to pollute. Or, citizens could take action themselves as they would if other property rights were violated. The US River Keepers Law of the 1880s was an early example, giving citizens downstream the right to end pollution upstream themselves if the government itself did not act (an early example of bioregional democracy). Many markets for &quot;pollution rights&quot; have been created in the late twentieth century—see emissions trading. According to the Coase Theorem, the involved parties will bargain with each other, which results in an efficient solution. However, modern economic theory has shown that the presence of asymmetric information may lead to inefficient bargaining outcomes. Specifically, Rob (1989) has shown that pollution claim settlements will not lead to the socially optimal outcome when the individuals that will be affected by pollution have learned private information about their disutility already before the negotiations take place. Goldlücke and Schmitz (2018) have shown that inefficiencies may also result if the parties learn their private information only after the negotiations, provided that the feasible transfer payments are bounded. Using cooperative game theory, Gonzalez, Marciano and Solal (2019) have shown that in social cost problems involving more than three agents, the Coase theorem suffers from many counterexamples and that only two types of property rights lead to an optimal solution.
* &quot;Accounting for environmental externalities in the final price&quot;. In fact, the world&#x27;s largest industries burn about $7.3 trillion of free natural capital per year. Thus, the world&#x27;s largest industries would hardly be profitable if they had to pay for this destruction of natural capital. Trucost has assessed over 100 direct environmental impacts and condensed them into 6 key environmental performance indicators (EKPIs). The assessment of environmental impacts is derived from different sources (academic journals, governments, studies, etc.) due to the lack of market prices. The table below gives an overview of the 5 regional sectors per EKPI with the highest impact on the overall EKPI:

If companies are allowed to include some of these externalities in their final prices, this could undermine the Jevons paradox and provide enough revenue to help companies innovate.

== Relationship to other fields ==
Environmental economics is related to ecological economics but there are differences. Most environmental economists have been trained as economists. They apply the tools of economics to address environmental problems, many of which are related to so-called market failures—circumstances wherein the &quot;invisible hand&quot; of economics is unreliable. Most ecological economists have been trained as ecologists, but have expanded the scope of their work to consider the impacts of humans and their economic activity on ecological systems and services, and vice versa. This field takes as its premise that economics is a strict subfield of ecology. Ecological economics is sometimes described as taking a more pluralistic approach to environmental problems and focuses more explicitly on long-term environmental sustainability and issues of scale.

Environmental economics is viewed as more idealistic in a price system; ecological economics as more realistic in its attempts to integrate elements outside of the price system as primary arbiters of decisions. These two groups of specialisms sometimes have conflicting views which may be traced to the different philosophical underpinnings.

Another context in which externalities apply is when globalization permits one player in a market who is unconcerned with biodiversity to undercut prices of another who is – creating a race to the bottom in regulations and conservation. This, in turn, may cause loss of natural capital with consequent erosion, water purity problems, diseases, desertification, and other outcomes that are not efficient in an economic sense. This concern is related to the subfield of sustainable development and its political relation, the anti-globalization movement.

Environmental economics was once distinct from resource economics. Natural resource economics as a subfield began when the main concern of researchers was the optimal commercial exploitation of natural resource stocks. But resource managers and policy-makers eventually began to pay attention to the broader importance of natural resources (e.g. values of fish and trees beyond just their commercial exploitation). It is now difficult to distinguish &quot;environmental&quot; and &quot;natural resource&quot; economics as separate fields as the two became associated with sustainability. Many of the more radical green economists split off to work on an alternate political economy.

Environmental economics was a major influence on the theories of natural capitalism and environmental finance, which could be said to be two sub-branches of environmental economics concerned with resource conservation in production, and the value of biodiversity to humans, respectively. The theory of natural capitalism (Hawken, Lovins, Lovins) goes further than traditional environmental economics by envisioning a world where natural services are considered on par with physical capital.

The more radical green economists reject neoclassical economics in favour of a new political economy beyond capitalism or communism that gives a greater emphasis to the interaction of the human economy and the natural environment, acknowledging that &quot;economy is three-fifths of ecology&quot;. This political group is a proponent of a transition to renewable energy.

These more radical approaches would imply changes to money supply and likely also a bioregional democracy so that political, economic, and ecological &quot;environmental limits&quot; were all aligned, and not subject to the arbitrage normally possible under capitalism.

An emerging sub-field of environmental economics studies its intersection with development economics. Dubbed &quot;envirodevonomics&quot; by Michael Greenstone and B. Kelsey Jack in their paper &quot;Envirodevonomics: A Research Agenda for a Young Field&quot;, the sub-field is primarily interested in studying &quot;why environmental quality [is] so poor in developing countries.&quot; A strategy for better understanding this correlation between a country&#x27;s GDP and its environmental quality involves analyzing how many of the central concepts of environmental economics, including market failures, externalities, and willingness to pay, may be complicated by the particular problems facing developing countries, such as political issues, lack of infrastructure, or inadequate financing tools, among many others.

In the field of law and economics, environmental law is studied from an economic perspective. The economic analysis of environmental law studies instruments such as zoning, expropriation, licensing, third party liability, safety regulation, mandatory insurance, and criminal sanctions. A book by Michael Faure (2003) surveys this literature.

<text>In computer science CDR coding is a compressed data representation for Lisp linked lists. It was developed and patented by the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and implemented in computer hardware in a number of Lisp machines derived from the MIT CADR.

CDR coding is in fact a fairly general idea; whenever a data object &quot;A&quot; ends in a reference to another data structure &quot;B&quot;, we can instead place the structure &quot;B&quot; itself there, overlapping and running off the end of &quot;A&quot;. By doing this we free the space required by the reference, which can add up if done many times, and also improve locality of reference, enhancing performance on modern machines. The transformation is especially effective for the cons-based lists it was created for; we free about half of the space for each node we perform this transformation on.

It is not always possible to perform this substitution, because there might not be a large enough chunk of free space beyond the end of A. Thus, some objects will end in a real reference, and some with the referenced object, and the machine must be able to tell by reading the final cell which one it is. This can be accomplished with some inefficiency in software by the use of tagged pointers, which allow a pointer in a final position to be specifically tagged as such, but is best done in hardware.

In the presence of mutable objects, CDR coding becomes more complex. If a reference is updated to point to another object, but currently has an object stored in that field, the object must be relocated, along with any other pointers to it. Not only are such moves typically expensive or impossible, but over time they cause fragmentation of the store. This problem is typically avoided by using CDR coding only on immutable data structures.

<text>In computer science, threaded code is a programming technique where the code has a form that essentially consists entirely of calls to subroutines. It is often used in compilers, which may generate code in that form or be implemented in that form themselves. The code may be processed by an interpreter or it may simply be a sequence of machine code call instructions.

Threaded code has better density than code generated by alternative generation techniques and by alternative calling conventions. In cached architectures, it may execute slightly slower. However, a program that is small enough to fit in a computer processor&#x27;s cache may run faster than a larger program that suffers many cache misses. Small programs may also be faster at thread switching, when other programs have filled the cache.

Threaded code is best known for its use in many compilers of programming languages, such as Forth, many implementations of BASIC, some implementations of COBOL, early versions of B, and other languages for small minicomputers and for amateur radio satellites.

==History==

The common way to make computer programs is to use a compiler to translate source code (written in some symbolic language) to machine code. The resulting executable is typically fast but, because it is specific to a hardware platform, it isn&#x27;t portable. A different approach is to generate instructions for a virtual machine and to use an interpreter on each hardware platform. The interpreter instantiates the virtual machine environment and executes the instructions. Thus the interpreter, compiled to machine code, provides an abstraction layer for &quot;interpreted languages&quot; that only need little compilation to conform to that layer (compilation may be confined to generating an Abstract Syntax Tree) or even need no compilation at all (if the layer is designed to consume raw source code.)

Early computers had relatively little memory. For example, most Data General Nova, IBM 1130, and many of the first microcomputers had only 4 kB of RAM installed. Consequently, a lot of time was spent trying to find ways to reduce a program&#x27;s size, to fit in the available memory.

One solution is to use an interpreter which reads the symbolic language a bit at a time, and calls functions to perform the actions. As the source code is typically much denser than the resulting machine code, this can reduce overall memory use. This was the reason Microsoft BASIC is an interpreter: its own code had to share the 4 kB memory of machines like the Altair 8800 with the user&#x27;s source code. A compiler translates from a source language to machine code, so the compiler, source, and output must all be in memory at the same time. In an interpreter, there is no output. 

Threaded code is a formatting style for compiled code that minimizes memory use. Instead of writing out every step of an operation at its every occurrence in the program, as was common in macro assemblers for instance, the compiler writes each common bit of code into a subroutine. Thus, each bit exists in only one place in memory (see &quot;Don&#x27;t repeat yourself&quot;). The top-level application in these programs may consist of nothing but subroutine calls. Many of these subroutines, in turn, also consist of nothing but lower-level subroutine calls.

Mainframes and some early microprocessors such as the RCA 1802 required several instructions to call a subroutine. In the top-level application and in many subroutines, that sequence is constantly repeated, with only the subroutine address changing from one call to the next. This means that a program consisting of many function calls may have considerable amounts of repeated code as well.

To address this, threaded code systems used pseudo-code to represent function calls in a single operator. At run time, a tiny &quot;interpreter&quot; would scan over the top-level code, extract the subroutine&#x27;s address in memory, and call it. In other systems, this same basic concept is implemented as a branch table, dispatch table, or virtual method table, all of which consist of a table of subroutine addresses.

During the 1970s, hardware designers spent considerable effort to make subroutine calls faster and simpler. On the improved designs, only a single instruction is expended to call a subroutine, so the use of a pseudo-instruction saves no room. Additionally, the performance of these calls is almost free of additional overhead. Today, though almost all programming languages focus on isolating code into subroutines, they do so for code clarity and maintainability, not to save space.

Threaded code systems save room by replacing that list of function calls, where only the subroutine address changes from one call to the next, with a list of execution tokens, which are essentially function calls with the call opcode(s) stripped off, leaving behind only a list of addresses.

Over the years, programmers have created many variations on that &quot;interpreter&quot; or &quot;small selector&quot;. The particular address in the list of addresses may be extracted using an index, general-purpose register or pointer. The addresses may be direct or indirect, contiguous or non-contiguous (linked by pointers), relative or absolute, resolved at compile time or dynamically built. No single variation is &quot;best&quot; for all situations.

==Development==
To save space, programmers squeezed the lists of subroutine calls into simple lists of subroutine addresses, and used a small loop to call each subroutine in turn. For example, the following pseudocode uses this technique to add two numbers A and B. In the example, the list is labeled thread and a variable ip (Instruction Pointer) tracks our place within the list. Another variable sp (Stack Pointer) contains an address elsewhere in memory that is available to hold a value temporarily.
start:
 ip = &amp;thread // points to the address &#x27;&amp;pushA&#x27;, not the textual label &#x27;thread&#x27;
top:
 jump *ip++ // follow ip to address in thread, follow that address to subroutine, advance ip
thread:
 &amp;pushA
 &amp;pushB
 &amp;add
pushA:
 *sp++ = A // follow sp to available memory, store A there, advance sp to next 
 jump top
pushB:
 *sp++ = B
 jump top
add:
 addend1 = *--sp // Pop the top value off the stack
 addend2 = *--sp // Pop second value off the stack
 *sp++ = addend1 + addend2 // Add the two values together and store the result on the top of the stack
 jump top


The calling loop at codice_1 is so simple that it can be repeated inline at the end of each subroutine. Control now jumps once, from the end of a subroutine to the start of another, instead of jumping twice via codice_1. For example:
start:
 ip = &amp;thread // ip points to &amp;pushA (which points to the first instruction of pushA)
 jump *ip++ // send control to first instruction of pushA and advance ip to &amp;pushB
thread:
 &amp;pushA
 &amp;pushB
 &amp;add
pushA:
 *sp++ = A // follow sp to available memory, store A there, advance sp to next 
 jump *ip++ // send control where ip says to (i.e. to pushB) and advance ip
pushB:
 *sp++ = B
 jump *ip++
add:
 addend1 = *--sp // Pop the top value off the stack
 addend2 = *--sp // Pop second value off the stack
 *sp++ = addend1 + addend2 // Add the two values together and store the result on top of the stack
 jump *ip++
This is called direct threaded code (DTC). Although the technique is older, the first widely circulated use of the term &quot;threaded code&quot; is probably James R. Bell&#x27;s 1973 article &quot;Threaded Code&quot;.

In 1970, Charles H. Moore invented a more compact arrangement, indirect threaded code (ITC), for his Forth virtual machine. Moore arrived at this arrangement because Nova minicomputers had an indirection bit in every address, which made ITC easy and fast. Later, he said that he found it so convenient that he propagated it into all later Forth designs.

Today, some Forth compilers generate direct-threaded code while others generate indirect-threaded code. The executables act the same either way.

==Threading models==
Practically all executable threaded code uses one or another of these methods for invoking subroutines (each method is called a &quot;threading model&quot;).

===Direct threading===
Addresses in the thread are the addresses of machine language. This form is simple, but may have overheads because the thread consists only of machine addresses, so all further parameters must be loaded indirectly from memory. Some Forth systems produce direct-threaded code. On many machines direct-threading is faster than subroutine threading (see reference below).

An example of a stack machine might execute the sequence &quot;push A, push B, add&quot;. That might be translated to the following thread and routines, where codice_3 is initialized to the address labeled codice_4 (i.e., the address where codice_5 is stored).
#define PUSH(x) (*sp++ = (x))
#define POP() (*--sp)
start:
 ip = &amp;thread // ip points to &amp;pushA (which points to the first instruction of pushA)
 jump *ip++ // send control to first instruction of pushA and advance ip to &amp;pushB
thread:
 &amp;pushA
 &amp;pushB
 &amp;add
pushA:
 PUSH(A)
 jump *ip++ // send control where ip says to (i.e. to pushB) and advance ip
pushB:
 PUSH(B)
 jump *ip++
add:
 result = POP() + POP()
 PUSH(result)
 jump *ip++
Alternatively, operands may be included in the thread. This can remove some indirection needed above, but makes the thread larger:
#define PUSH(x) (*sp++ = (x))
#define POP() (*--sp)
start:
 ip = &amp;thread
 jump *ip++
thread:
 &amp;push
 &amp;A // address where A is stored, not literal A
 &amp;push
 &amp;B
 &amp;add
push:
 variable_address = *ip++ // must move ip past operand address, since it is not a subroutine address
 PUSH(*variable_address) // Read value from variable and push on stack
 jump *ip++
add:
 result = POP() + POP()
 PUSH(result)
 jump *ip++
===Indirect threading===
Indirect threading uses pointers to locations that in turn point to machine code. The indirect pointer may be followed by operands which are stored in the indirect &quot;block&quot; rather than storing them repeatedly in the thread. Thus, indirect code is often more compact than direct-threaded code. The indirection typically makes it slower, though usually still faster than bytecode interpreters. Where the handler operands include both values and types, the space savings over direct-threaded code may be significant. Older FORTH systems typically produce indirect-threaded code.

For example, if the goal is to execute &quot;push A, push B, add&quot;, the following might be used. Here, codice_3 is initialized to address codice_7, each code fragment (codice_8, codice_9) is found by double-indirecting through codice_3 and an indirect block; and any operands to the fragment are found in the indirect block following the fragment&#x27;s address. This requires keeping the &quot;current&quot; subroutine in codice_3, unlike all previous examples where it contained the &quot;next&quot; subroutine to be called.
start:
 ip = &amp;thread // points to &#x27;&amp;i_pushA&#x27;
 jump *(*ip) // follow pointers to 1st instruction of &#x27;push&#x27;, DO NOT advance ip yet
thread:
 &amp;i_pushA
 &amp;i_pushB
 &amp;i_add
i_pushA:
 &amp;push
 &amp;A
i_pushB:
 &amp;push
 &amp;B
i_add:
 &amp;add
push:
 *sp++ = *(*ip + 1) // look 1 past start of indirect block for operand address
 jump *(*++ip) // advance ip in thread, jump through next indirect block to next subroutine
add:
 addend1 = *--sp
 addend2 = *--sp
 *sp++ = addend1 + addend2
 jump *(*++ip)
===Subroutine threading===
So-called &quot;subroutine-threaded code&quot; (also &quot;call-threaded code&quot;) consists of a series of machine-language &quot;call&quot; instructions (or addresses of functions to &quot;call&quot;, as opposed to direct threading&#x27;s use of &quot;jump&quot;). Early compilers for ALGOL, Fortran, Cobol and some Forth systems often produced subroutine-threaded code. The code in many of these systems operated on a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack of operands, for which compiler theory was well-developed. Most modern processors have special hardware support for subroutine &quot;call&quot; and &quot;return&quot; instructions, so the overhead of one extra machine instruction per dispatch is somewhat diminished.

Anton Ertl, the Gforth compiler&#x27;s co-creator, stated that &quot;in contrast to popular myths, subroutine threading is usually slower than direct threading&quot;. However, Ertl&#x27;s most recent tests show that subroutine threading is faster than direct threading in 15 out of 25 test cases. More specifically, he found that direct threading is the fastest threading model on Xeon, Opteron, and Athlon processors, indirect threading is fastest on Pentium M processors, and subroutine threading is fastest on Pentium 4, Pentium III, and PPC processors.

As an example of call threading for &quot;push A, push B, add&quot;:
thread:
 call pushA
 call pushB
 call add
 ret
pushA:
 *sp++ = A
 ret
pushB:
 *sp++ = B
 ret
add:
 addend1 = *--sp
 addend2 = *--sp
 *sp++ = addend1 + addend2
 ret
===Token threading===
Token-threaded code implements the thread as a list of indices into a table of operations; the index width is naturally chosen to be as small as possible for density and efficiency. 1 byte / 8-bits is the natural choice for ease of programming, but smaller sizes like 4-bits, or larger like 12 or 16 bits, can be used depending on the number of operations supported. As long as the index width is chosen to be narrower than a machine pointer, it will naturally be more compact than the other threading types without much special effort by the programmer. It is usually half to three-fourths the size of other threadings, which are themselves a quarter to an eighth the size of non-threaded code. The table&#x27;s pointers can either be indirect or direct. Some Forth compilers produce token-threaded code. Some programmers consider the &quot;p-code&quot; generated by some Pascal compilers, as well as the bytecodes used by .NET, Java, BASIC and some C compilers, to be token-threading.

A common approach, historically, is bytecode, which typically uses 8-bit opcodes with a stack-based virtual machine. The archetypal bytecode interpreter is known as a &quot;decode and dispatch interpreter&quot; and follows the form:
start:
 vpc = &amp;thread
dispatch:
 addr = decode(&amp;vpc) // Convert the next bytecode operation to a pointer to machine code that implements it
 // Any inter-instruction operations are performed here (e.g. updating global state, event processing, etc)
 jump addr
CODE_PTR decode(BYTE_CODE **p) {
 // In a more complex encoding, there may be multiple tables to choose between or control/mode flags
 return table[*(*p)++];
thread: /* Contains bytecode, not machine addresses. Hence it is more compact. */
 1 /*pushA*/
 2 /*pushB*/
 0 /*add*/
table:
 &amp;add /* table[0] = address of machine code that implements bytecode 0 */
 &amp;pushA /* table[1] ... */
 &amp;pushB /* table[2] ... */
pushA:
 *sp++ = A
 jump dispatch
pushB:
 *sp++ = B
 jump dispatch
add:
 addend1 = *--sp
 addend2 = *--sp
 *sp++ = addend1 + addend2
 jump dispatch
If the virtual machine uses only byte-size instructions, codice_12 is simply a fetch from codice_4, but often there are commonly used 1-byte instructions plus some less-common multibyte instructions (see complex instruction set computer), in which case codice_12 is more complex. The decoding of single byte opcodes can be very simply and efficiently handled by a branch table using the opcode directly as an index.

For instructions where the individual operations are simple, such as &quot;push&quot; and &quot;add&quot;, the overhead involved in deciding what to execute is larger than the cost of actually executing it, so such interpreters are often much slower than machine code. However, for more complex (&quot;compound&quot;) instructions, the overhead percentage is proportionally less significant.

There are times when token-threaded code can sometimes run faster than the equivalent machine code when that machine code ends up being too large to fit in the physical CPU&#x27;s L1 instruction cache. The higher code density of threaded code, especially token-threaded code, can allow it to fit entirely in the L1 cache when it otherwise would not have, thereby avoiding cache thrashing. However, threaded code consumes both instruction cache (for the implementation of each operation) as well as data cache (for the bytecode and tables) unlike machine code which only consumes instruction cache; this means threaded code will eat into the budget for the amount of data that can be held for processing by the CPU at any given time. In any case, if the problem being computed involves applying a large number of operations to a small amount of data then using threaded code may be an ideal optimization.
===Huffman threading===
Huffman threaded code consists of lists of tokens stored as Huffman codes. A Huffman code is a variable-length string of bits that identifies a unique token. A Huffman-threaded interpreter locates subroutines using an index table or a tree of pointers that can be navigated by the Huffman code. Huffman-threaded code is one of the most compact representations known for a computer program. The index and codes are chosen by measuring the frequency of calls to each subroutine in the code. Frequent calls are given the shortest codes. Operations with approximately equal frequencies are given codes with nearly equal bit-lengths. Most Huffman-threaded systems have been implemented as direct-threaded Forth systems, and used to pack large amounts of slow-running code into small, cheap microcontrollers. Most published uses have been in smart cards, toys, calculators, and watches. The bit-oriented tokenized code used in PBASIC can be seen as a kind of Huffman-threaded code.

===Lesser-used threading===
An example is string threading, in which operations are identified by strings, usually looked up by a hash table. This was used in Charles H. Moore&#x27;s earliest Forth implementations and in the University of Illinois&#x27;s experimental hardware-interpreted computer language. It is also used in Bashforth.

===RPL===
HP&#x27;s RPL, first introduced in the HP-18C calculator in 1986, is a type of proprietary hybrid (direct-threaded and indirect-threaded) &quot;threaded interpretive language&quot; (TIL) that, unlike other TILs, allows embedding of RPL &quot;objects&quot; into the &quot;runstream&quot;, i.e. the stream of addresses through which the interpreter pointer advances. An RPL &quot;object&quot; can be thought of as a special data type whose in-memory structure contains an address to an &quot;object prolog&quot; at the start of the object, and then data or executable code follows. The object prolog determines how the object&#x27;s body should be executed or processed. Using the &quot;RPL inner loop&quot;, which was invented and patented by William C. Wickes in 1986 and published in 1988, execution follows like so:

# Dereference the IP (instruction pointer) and store it into O (current object pointer)
# Increment the IP by the length of one address pointer
# Dereference O and store its address in O_1 (this is the second level of indirection)
# Transfer control to next pointer or embedded object by setting the PC (program counter) to O_1 plus one address pointer
# Go back to step 1

This can be represented more precisely by:

Where above, O is the current object pointer, I is the interpreter pointer, Δ is the length of one address word and the &quot;[]&quot; operator stands for &quot;dereference&quot;.

When control is transferred to an object pointer or an embedded object, execution continues as follows:

On HP&#x27;s Saturn microprocessors that use RPL, there is a third level of indirection made possible by an architectural / programming trick which allows faster execution.

==Branches==
In all interpreters, a branch simply changes the thread pointer (codice_3) to a different address in the thread. A conditional jump-if-zero branch that jumps only if the top-of-stack value is zero could be implemented as shown below. This example uses the embedded parameter version of direct threading so the codice_16 line is the destination of where to jump if the condition is true, so it must be skipped (codice_17) over if the branch is not taken.
thread:
 &amp;brz
 &amp;thread[123]
brz:
 when_true_ip = *ip++ // Get destination address for branch
 if (*--sp == 0) // Pop/Consume top of stack and check if it&#x27;s zero
 ip = when_true_ip
 jump *ip++
==Common amenities==
Separating the data and return stacks in a machine eliminates a great deal of stack management code, substantially reducing the size of the threaded code. The dual-stack principle originated three times independently: for Burroughs large systems, Forth, and PostScript. It is used in some Java virtual machines.

Three registers are often present in a threaded virtual machine. Another one exists for passing data between subroutines (&#x27;words&#x27;). These are:
* ip or i (instruction pointer) of the virtual machine (not to be confused with the program counter of the underlying hardware implementing the VM)
* w (work pointer)
* rp or r (return stack pointer)
* sp or s (parameter stack pointer for passing parameters between words)

Often, threaded virtual machines, such as implementations of Forth, have a simple virtual machine at heart, consisting of three &quot;primitives&quot;. Those are:
# &quot;nest&quot;, also called &quot;docol&quot;
# &quot;unnest&quot;, or &quot;semi_s&quot; (;s)
# &quot;next&quot;

In an indirect-threaded virtual machine, the one given here, the operations are:

 next:
 *ip++ -&gt; w
 jump **w++
 nest:
 ip -&gt; *rp++
 w -&gt; ip
 next
 unnest:
 *--rp -&gt; ip
 next

<text>Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) is an American multinational semiconductor company headquartered in Dallas, Texas. It is one of the top 10 semiconductor companies worldwide based on sales volume. The company&#x27;s focus is on developing analog chips and embedded processors, which account for more than 80% of its revenue. TI also produces digital light processing (DLP) technology and education technology products including calculators, microcontrollers, and multi-core processors.

Texas Instruments emerged in 1951 after a reorganization of Geophysical Service Incorporated, a company founded in 1930 that manufactured equipment for use in the seismic industry, as well as defense electronics. TI produced the world&#x27;s first commercial silicon transistor in 1954, and the same year designed and manufactured the first transistor radio. Jack Kilby invented the integrated circuit in 1958 while working at TI&#x27;s Central Research Labs. TI also invented the hand-held calculator in 1967, and introduced the first single-chip microcontroller in 1970, which combined all the elements of computing onto one piece of silicon.

In 1987, TI invented the digital light processing device (also known as the DLP chip), which serves as the foundation for the company&#x27;s DLP technology and DLP Cinema. TI released the popular TI-81 calculator in 1990, which made it a leader in the graphing calculator industry. Its defense business was sold to Raytheon Company in 1997; this allowed TI to strengthen its focus on digital solutions. After the acquisition of National Semiconductor in 2011, the company had a combined portfolio of 45,000 analog products and customer design tools. In the stock market, Texas Instruments is often regarded as an indicator for the semiconductor and electronics industry as a whole, since the company sells to more than 100,000 customers. 

==History==
Texas Instruments was founded by Cecil H. Green, J. Erik Jonsson, Eugene McDermott, and Patrick E. Haggerty in 1951. McDermott was one of the original founders of Geophysical Service Inc. (GSI) in 1930. McDermott, Green, and Jonsson were GSI employees who purchased the company in 1941. In November 1945, Patrick Haggerty was hired as general manager of the Laboratory and Manufacturing (L&amp;M) division, which focused on electronic equipment. By 1951, the L&amp;M division, with its defense contracts, was growing faster than GSI&#x27;s geophysical division. The company was reorganized and initially renamed General Instruments Inc. Because a firm named General Instrument already existed, the company was renamed Texas Instruments that same year. From 1956 to 1961, Fred Agnich of Dallas, later a Republican member of the Texas House of Representatives, was the Texas Instruments president. Geophysical Service, Inc. became a subsidiary of Texas Instruments. Early in 1988, most of GSI was sold to the Halliburton Company.

===Geophysical Service Incorporated===
In 1930, J. Clarence Karcher and Eugene McDermott founded Geophysical Service, an early provider of seismic exploration services to the petroleum industry. In 1939, the company reorganized as Coronado Corp, an oil company with Geophysical Service Inc (GSI), now as a subsidiary. On December 6, 1941, McDermott along with three other GSI employees, J. Erik Jonsson, Cecil H. Green, and H. B. Peacock purchased GSI. During World War II, GSI expanded its services to include electronics for the U.S. Army, Army Signal Corps, and U.S. Navy. In 1951, the company changed its name to Texas Instruments, spun off to build seismographs for oil explorations and with GSI becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the new company.

An early success came for TI-GSI in 1965, when GSI was able (under a Top Secret government contract) to monitor the Soviet Union&#x27;s underground nuclear weapons testing under the ocean in Vela Uniform, a subset of Project Vela, to verify compliance of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.

Texas Instruments also continued to manufacture equipment for use in the seismic industry, and GSI continued to provide seismic services. After selling (and repurchasing) GSI, TI finally sold the company to Halliburton in 1988, after which sale GSI ceased to exist as a separate entity.

===Semiconductors===
In early 1952, Texas Instruments purchased a patent license to produce germanium transistors from Western Electric, the manufacturing arm of AT&amp;T, for US$25,000, beginning production by the end of the year. Haggerty brought Gordon Teal to the company due to his expertise in growing semiconductor crystals while at Bell Telephone Laboratories. Teal&#x27;s first assignment was to direct TI&#x27;s research laboratory. At the end of 1952, Texas Instruments announced that it had expanded to 2,000 employees and $17 million in sales.

Among his new hires was Willis Adcock, who joined TI early in 1953. Adcock, who like Teal was a physical chemist, began leading a small research group focused on the task of fabricating grown-junction, silicon, single-crystal, small-signal transistors. Adcock later became the first TI Principal Fellow.

====First silicon transistor and integrated circuits====
In January 1954, Morris Tanenbaum at Bell Telephone Laboratories created the first workable silicon transistor. This work was reported in the spring of 1954, at the IRE off-the-record conference on solid-state devices, and was later published in the &quot;Journal of Applied Physics&quot;. Working independently in April 1954, Gordon Teal at TI created the first commercial silicon transistor and tested it on April 14, 1954. On May 10, 1954, at the Institute of Radio Engineers National Conference on Airborne Electronics in Dayton, Ohio, Teal presented a paper: &quot;Some Recent Developments in Silicon and Germanium Materials and Devices&quot;.

In 1954, Texas Instruments designed and manufactured the first transistor radio. The Regency TR-1 used germanium transistors, as silicon transistors were much more expensive at the time. This was an effort by Haggerty to increase market demand for transistors.

Jack Kilby, an employee at TI, invented the integrated circuit in 1958. Kilby recorded his initial ideas concerning the integrated circuit in July 1958, and successfully demonstrated the world&#x27;s first working integrated circuit on September 12, 1958. Six months later, Robert Noyce of Fairchild Semiconductor (who went on to co-found Intel) independently developed the integrated circuit with integrated interconnect, and is also considered an inventor of the integrated circuit. In 1969, Kilby was awarded the National Medal of Science, and in 1982 he was inducted into the National Inventor&#x27;s Hall of Fame. Kilby also won the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physics for his part of the invention of the integrated circuit. Noyce&#x27;s chip, made at Fairchild, was made of silicon, while Kilby&#x27;s chip was made of germanium. In 2008, TI named its new development laboratory &quot;Kilby Labs&quot; after Jack Kilby.

====Standard TTL====


The 7400 series of transistor-transistor logic chips, developed by Texas Instruments in the 1960s, popularized the use of integrated circuits in computer logic. The military-grade version of this was the 5400 series.

====Microprocessor====
Texas Instruments invented the hand-held calculator (a prototype called &quot;Cal Tech&quot;) in 1967 and the single-chip microcomputer in 1971, was assigned the first patent on a single-chip microprocessor (invented by Gary Boone) on September 4, 1973. This was disputed by Gilbert Hyatt, formerly of the Micro Computer Company, in August 1990, when he was awarded a patent superseding TI&#x27;s. This was overturned on June 19, 1996, in favor of TI (note: Intel is usually given credit with Texas Instruments for the almost-simultaneous invention of the microprocessor).

====First speech synthesis chip====
In 1978, Texas Instruments introduced the first single-chip linear predictive coding speech synthesizer. In 1976, TI began a feasibility study of memory-intensive applications for bubble memory then being developed. They soon focused on speech applications. This resulted in the development of the TMC0280 one-chip linear predictive coding speech synthesizer, which was the first time a single silicon chip had electronically replicated the human voice. This was used in several TI commercial products beginning with Speak &amp; Spell, which was introduced at the Summer Consumer Electronics Show in June 1978. In 2001, TI left the speech synthesis business, selling it to Sensory Inc. of Santa Clara, California.

===Consumer electronics and computers===
In May 1954, Texas Instruments designed and built a prototype of the world&#x27;s first transistor radio, and, through a partnership with Industrial Development Engineering Associates of Indianapolis, Indiana, the 100% solid-state radio was sold to the public beginning in October of that year.

In the 1960s, company president Pat Haggerty had a team that included Jack Kilby to work on a handheld calculator project. Kilby and two other colleagues created the Cal-Tech, a three-pound battery-powered calculator that could do basic math and fit six-digit numbers on its display. This 4.25 x 6.15 x 1.75 inch calculator&#x27;s processor would originate the vast majority of Texas Instruments’ revenue.

In 1973, the handheld calculator SR-10 (named after slide rule) and in 1974, the handheld scientific calculator SR-50 were issued by TI. Both had red LED-segments numeric displays. The optical design of the SR-50 is somewhat similar to the HP-35 edited by Hewlett-Packard before in early 1972, but buttons for the operations &quot;+&quot;, &quot;–&quot;, ... are in the right of the number block and the decimal point lies between two neighboring digits.

TI continued to be active in the consumer electronics market through the 1970s and 1980s. Early on, this also included two digital clock models – one for desk and the other a bedside alarm. From this sprang what became the Time Products Division, which made LED watches. Though these LED watches enjoyed early commercial success due to excellent quality, it was short-lived due to poor battery life. LEDs were replaced with LCD watches for a short time, but these could not compete because of styling issues, excessive makes and models, and price points. The watches were manufactured in Dallas and then Lubbock, Texas. Several spin-offs of the Speak &amp; Spell, such as the Speak &amp; Read and Speak &amp; Math, were introduced soon thereafter.

In 1979, TI entered the home computer market with the TI-99/4, a competitor to computers such as the Apple II, TRS-80, and the later Atari 400/800 and VIC-20. By late 1982, TI was dominating the U.S. home computer market, shipping 5,000 computers a day from their factory in Lubbock. It discontinued the TI-99/4A (1981), the sequel to the 99/4, in late 1983 amid an intense price war waged primarily against Commodore. At the 1983 Winter CES, TI showed models 99/2 and the Compact Computer 40, the latter aimed at professional users. The TI Professional (1983) ultimately joined the ranks of the many unsuccessful MS-DOS and x86-based—but non-compatible—competitors to the IBM PC (the founders of Compaq, an early leader in PC compatibles, all came from TI). The company for years successfully made and sold PC-compatible laptops before withdrawing from the market and selling its product line to Acer in 1998.

===Defense electronics===
TI entered the defense electronics market in 1942 with submarine detection equipment, based on the seismic exploration technology previously developed for the oil industry. The division responsible for these products was known at different times as the Laboratory &amp; Manufacturing Division, the Apparatus Division, the Equipment Group, and the Defense Systems &amp; Electronics Group (DSEG).

During the early 1980s, TI instituted a quality program which included Juran training, as well as promoting statistical process control, Taguchi methods, and Design for Six Sigma. In the late 1980s, the company, along with Eastman Kodak and Allied Signal, began involvement with Motorola, institutionalizing Motorola&#x27;s Six Sigma methodology. Motorola, which originally developed the Six Sigma methodology, began this work in 1982. In 1992, the DSEG division of Texas Instruments&#x27; quality-improvement efforts were rewarded by winning the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award for manufacturing.

====Infrared and radar systems====

TI developed the AAA-4 infrared search and track device in the late 1950s and early 1960s for the F-4B Phantom for passive scanning of jet-engine emissions, but it possessed limited capabilities and was eliminated on F-4Ds and later models.

In 1956, TI began research on infrared technology that led to several line scanner contracts and with the addition of a second scan mirror the invention of the first forward looking infrared (FLIR) in 1963 with production beginning in 1966. In 1972, TI invented the common module FLIR concept, greatly reducing cost and allowing reuse of common components.

TI went on to produce side-looking radar systems, the first terrain-following radar and surveillance radar systems for both the military and FAA. TI demonstrated the first solid-state radar called Molecular Electronics for Radar Applications. In 1976, TI developed a microwave landing system prototype. In 1984, TI developed the first inverse synthetic aperture radar. The first single-chip gallium arsenide radar module was developed. In 1991, the military microwave integrated circuit program was initiated—a joint effort with Raytheon.

====Missiles and laser-guided bombs====

In 1961, TI won the guidance and control system contract for the defense suppression AGM-45 Shrike antiradiation missile. This led later to the prime on the high-speed antiradiation missile (AGM-88 HARM) development contract in 1974 and production in 1981.

In 1964, TI began development of the first laser guidance system for precision-guided munitions, leading to the Paveway series of laser-guided bombs (LGBs). The first LGB was the BOLT-117.

In 1969, TI won the Harpoon (missile) Seeker contract. In 1986, TI won the Army FGM-148 Javelin fire-and-forget man portable antitank guided missile in a joint venture with Martin Marietta. In 1991, TI was awarded the contract for the AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon.

In 1988, TI paid the U.S. government $5.2 million &quot;to settle allegations one of its divisions overcharged the government on contracts for guided missiles sold to the Navy&quot;.

====Military computers====
Because of TI&#x27;s research and development of military temperature-range silicon transistors and integrated circuits (ICs), TI won contracts for the first IC-based computer for the U.S. Air Force in 1961 (molecular electronic computer) and for ICs for the Minuteman Missile the following year. In 1968, TI developed the data systems for Mariner Program. In 1991 TI won the F-22 Radar and Computer development contract.

====Divestiture to Raytheon====

As the defense industry consolidated, TI sold its defense business to the Raytheon Company in 1997 for $2.95 billion. The Department of Justice required that Raytheon divest the TI Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit (MMIC) operations after closing the transaction. The TI MMIC business accounted for less than $40 million in 1996 revenues, or roughly 2% of the $1.8 billion in total TI defense revenues, and was sold to TriQuint Semiconductor, Inc. Raytheon retained its own existing MMIC capabilities and has the right to license TI&#x27;s MMIC technology for use in future product applications from TriQuint.

Shortly after Raytheon acquired TI DSEG, Raytheon then acquired Hughes Aircraft from General Motors. Raytheon then owned TI&#x27;s mercury cadmium telluride detector business and infrared (IR) systems group. In California, it also had Hughes infrared detector and an IR systems business. When again the US government forced Raytheon to divest itself of a duplicate capability, the company kept the TI IR systems business and the Hughes detector business. As a result of these acquisitions, these former arch rivals of TI systems and Hughes detectors work together.

Immediately after acquisition, DSEG was known as Raytheon TI Systems (RTIS). It is now fully integrated into Raytheon and this designation no longer exists.

===Artificial intelligence===
TI was active in the area of artificial intelligence in the 1980s. In addition to ongoing developments in speech and signal processing and recognition, it developed and sold the Explorer computer family of Lisp machines. For the Explorer, a special 32-bit Lisp microprocessor was developed, which was used in the Explorer II and the TI MicroExplorer (a Lisp Machine on a NuBus board for the Apple Macintosh). AI application software developed by TI for the Explorer included the gate assignment system for Northwest Airlines and United Airlines, described as &quot;an artificial intelligence program that captures the combined experience and knowledge of a half-dozen United operations experts.&quot; In software for the PC, they introduced &quot;Personal Consultant&quot;, a rule-based expert system development tool and runtime engine, followed by &quot;Personal Consultant Plus&quot; written in the Lisp-like language from MIT known as Scheme, and the natural language menu system NLMenu.

===Sensors and controls===
TI was a major original-equipment manufacturer of sensor, control, protection, and RFID products for the automotive, appliance, aircraft, and other industries. The Sensors &amp; Controls division was headquartered in Attleboro, Massachusetts.

By the mid-1980s, industrial computers known as PLC&#x27;s (programmable logic controllers) were separated from Sensors &amp; Controls as the Industrial Systems Division, which was sold in the early 1990s to Siemens.

In 2006, Bain Capital LLC, a private equity firm, purchased the Sensors &amp; Controls division for $3.0 billion in cash. The RFID portion of the division remained part of TI, transferring to the Application Specific Products business unit of the Semiconductor division, with the newly formed independent company based in Attleboro taking the name Sensata Technologies.

===Software===

In 1997, TI sold its software division, along with its main products such as the CA Gen, to Sterling Software, which is now part of Computer Associates. However, TI still owns small pieces of software, such as the software for calculators such as the TI Interactive!. TI also creates a significant amount of target software for its digital signal processors, along with host-based tools for creating DSP applications.

== Finances ==
For the fiscal year 2017, Texas Instruments reported earnings of $3.682 billion, with an annual revenue of $14.961 billion, an increase of 11.9% over the previous fiscal cycle. TI shares traded at over $82 per share, and its market capitalization was valued at over $88.0 billion in October 2018. As of 2018, TI ranked 192nd on the Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by revenue.

==Divisions==
As of 2016, TI is made up of four divisions: analog products, embedded processors, digital light processing, and educational technology.

As of January 2021, the industrial market accounts for 41 percent of TI&#x27;s annual revenue, and the automotive market accounts for 21 percent.

===Other businesses===
TI&#x27;s remaining businesses consisting of DLP products (primarily used in projectors to create high-definition images), calculators and certain custom semiconductors known as application-specific integrated circuits.

====DLP Products====

Texas Instruments sells DLP technology for TVs, video projectors, and digital cinema. On February 2, 2000, Philippe Binant, technical manager of Digital Cinema Project at Gaumont in France, realized the first digital cinema projection in Europe with the DLP Cinema technology developed by TI DLP technology enables a diverse range of display and advanced light control applications spanning industrial, enterprise, automotive, and consumer market segments.

;Custom application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs)

The ASICs business develops more complex integrated-circuit solutions for clients on a custom basis.
====Educational technology====
TI has produced educational toys for children, including the Little Professor in 1976 and Dataman in 1977.

TI produces a range of calculators, with the TI-30 being one of the most popular early calculators. TI has also developed a line of graphing calculators, the first being the TI-81, and most popular being the TI-83 Plus (with the TI-84 Plus being an updated equivalent).

Many TI calculators are still sold without graphing capabilities. The TI-30 has been replaced by the TI-30X IIS. Also, some financial calculators are for sale on the TI website.

In 2007, TI released the TI-Nspire family of calculators and computer software that has similar capabilities to the calculators.

Less than 3% of Texas Instruments’ overall revenue comes from calculators, part of the $1.43 billion revenue in the &quot;Other&quot; section in the company&#x27;s 2018 annual report. Nevertheless, the calculators are a lucrative product. For example, estimates have a $15 to $20 cost to produce TI-84 Plus which likely has a profit margin of at least 50%.

Throughout the 1980s, Texas Instruments worked closely with National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) to develop a calculator to become the educational standard. In 1986, Connecticut School Board became the first to require a graphing calculator on state-mandated exams. Chicago Public Schools gave a free calculator to every student, beginning in the fourth grade, in 1988. New York required the calculator in 1992 for its Regents exams after first allowing it the previous year. The College Board required calculators on the Advanced Placement tests in 1993 and allowed calculators on the SAT a year later. Texas Instruments provides free services to the College Board, which administers AP tests and the SAT, and also has a group called Teachers Teaching for Technology (T3), which educates teachers on how to use its calculators.

====TI calculator community====
In the 1990s, with the advent of TI&#x27;s graphing calculator series, programming became popular among some students. The TI-8x series of calculators (beginning with the TI-81) came with a built-in BASIC interpreter, through which simple programs could be created. The TI-83 was the first in the series to receive native assembly. Around the same time that these programs were first being written, programmers began creating websites to host their work, along with tutorials and other calculator-relevant information. This led to the formation of TI calculator webrings and eventually a few large communities, including ticalc.org.

The TI community reached the height of its popularity in the early 2000s, with many new websites and programming groups being started. In fact, the aforementioned community sites were exploding with activity, with close to 100 programs being uploaded daily by users of the sites. Also, a competition existed between both sites to be the top site in the community, which helped increase interest and activity in the community.

One of the common unifying forces that has united the community over the years has been the rather contentious relationship with TI regarding control over its graphing calculators. TI graphing calculators generally fall into two distinct groups—the older ones powered by the Zilog Z80 and the newer ones running on the Motorola 68000 series. Both lines of calculators are locked by TI with checks in the hardware and through the signing of software to disable use of custom operating systems. However, users discovered the keys and published them in 2009. TI responded by sending invalid DMCA takedown notices, causing the Texas Instruments signing key controversy.

<text>Transistor–transistor logic (TTL) is a logic family built from bipolar junction transistors. Its name signifies that transistors perform both the logic function (the first &quot;transistor&quot;) and the amplifying function (the second &quot;transistor&quot;), as opposed to earlier resistor–transistor logic (RTL) and diode–transistor logic (DTL).

TTL integrated circuits (ICs) were widely used in applications such as computers, industrial controls, test equipment and instrumentation, consumer electronics, and synthesizers.

After their introduction in integrated circuit form in 1963 by Sylvania Electric Products, TTL integrated circuits were manufactured by several semiconductor companies. The 7400 series by Texas Instruments became particularly popular. TTL manufacturers offered a wide range of logic gates, flip-flops, counters, and other circuits. Variations of the original TTL circuit design offered higher speed or lower power dissipation to allow design optimization. TTL devices were originally made in ceramic and plastic dual in-line package(s) and in flat-pack form. Some TTL chips are now also made in surface-mount technology packages.

TTL became the foundation of computers and other digital electronics. Even after Very-Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) CMOS integrated circuit microprocessors made multiple-chip processors obsolete, TTL devices still found extensive use as glue logic interfacing between more densely integrated components.

==History==
TTL was invented in 1961 by James L. Buie of TRW, which declared it &quot;particularly suited to the newly developing integrated circuit design technology.&quot; The original name for TTL was &quot;transistor-coupled transistor logic&quot; (TCTL). The first commercial integrated-circuit TTL devices were manufactured by Sylvania in 1963, called the Sylvania Universal High-Level Logic family (SUHL). The Sylvania parts were used in the controls of the Phoenix missile. TTL became popular with electronic systems designers after Texas Instruments introduced the 5400 series of ICs, with military temperature range, in 1964 and the later 7400 series, specified over a narrower range and with inexpensive plastic packages, in 1966.

The Texas Instruments 7400 family became an industry standard. Compatible parts were made by Motorola, AMD, Fairchild, Intel, Intersil, Signetics, Mullard, Siemens, SGS-Thomson, Rifa, National Semiconductor, and many other companies, even in the Eastern Bloc (Soviet Union, GDR, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania — for details see 7400 series). Not only did others make compatible TTL parts, but compatible parts were made using many other circuit technologies as well. At least one manufacturer, IBM, produced non-compatible TTL circuits for its own use; IBM used the technology in the IBM System/38, IBM 4300, and IBM 3081.

The term &quot;TTL&quot; is applied to many successive generations of bipolar logic, with gradual improvements in speed and power consumption over about two decades. The most recently introduced family 74Fxx is still sold today (as of 2019), and was widely used into the late 90s. 74AS/ALS Advanced Schottky was introduced in 1985. As of 2008, Texas Instruments continues to supply the more general-purpose chips in numerous obsolete technology families, albeit at increased prices. Typically, TTL chips integrate no more than a few hundred transistors each. Functions within a single package generally range from a few logic gates to a microprocessor bit-slice. TTL also became important because its low cost made digital techniques economically practical for tasks previously done by analog methods.

The Kenbak-1, ancestor of the first personal computers, used TTL for its CPU instead of a microprocessor chip, which was not available in 1971. The Datapoint 2200 from 1970 used TTL components for its CPU and was the basis for the 8008 and later the x86 instruction set. The 1973 Xerox Alto and 1981 Star workstations, which introduced the graphical user interface, used TTL circuits integrated at the level of arithmetic logic units (ALUs) and bitslices, respectively. Most computers used TTL-compatible &quot;glue logic&quot; between larger chips well into the 1990s. Until the advent of programmable logic, discrete bipolar logic was used to prototype and emulate microarchitectures under development.

== Implementation ==

=== Fundamental TTL gate ===
TTL inputs are the emitters of bipolar transistors. In the case of NAND inputs, the inputs are the emitters of multiple-emitter transistors, functionally equivalent to multiple transistors where the bases and collectors are tied together. The output is buffered by a common emitter amplifier.

Inputs both logical ones. When all the inputs are held at high voltage, the base–emitter junctions of the multiple-emitter transistor are reverse-biased. Unlike DTL, a small “collector” current (approximately 10 μA) is drawn by each of the inputs. This is because the transistor is in reverse-active mode. An approximately constant current flows from the positive rail, through the resistor and into the base of the multiple emitter transistor. This current passes through the base–emitter junction of the output transistor, allowing it to conduct and pulling the output voltage low (logical zero).

An input logical zero. Note that the base–collector junction of the multiple-emitter transistor and the base–emitter junction of the output transistor are in series between the bottom of the resistor and ground. If one input voltage becomes zero, the corresponding base–emitter junction of the multiple-emitter transistor is in parallel with these two junctions. A phenomenon called current steering means that when two voltage-stable elements with different threshold voltages are connected in parallel, the current flows through the path with the smaller threshold voltage. That is, current flows out of this input and into the zero (low) voltage source. As a result, no current flows through the base of the output transistor, causing it to stop conducting and the output voltage becomes high (logical one). During the transition the input transistor is briefly in its active region; so it draws a large current away from the base of the output transistor and thus quickly discharges its base. This is a critical advantage of TTL over DTL that speeds up the transition over a diode input structure.

The main disadvantage of TTL with a simple output stage is the relatively high output resistance at output logical &quot;1&quot; that is completely determined by the output collector resistor. It limits the number of inputs that can be connected (the fanout). Some advantage of the simple output stage is the high voltage level (up to VCC) of the output logical &quot;1&quot; when the output is not loaded.

=== Open collector wired logic ===

A common variation omits the collector resistor of the output transistor, making an open-collector output. This allows the designer to fabricate wired logic by connecting the open-collector outputs of several logic gates together and providing a single external pull-up resistor. If any of the logic gates becomes logic low (transistor conducting), the combined output will be low. Examples of this type of gate are the 7401 and 7403 series. Open-collector outputs of some gates have a higher maximum voltage, such as 15 V for the 7426, useful when driving non-TTL loads.

=== TTL with a &quot;totem-pole&quot; output stage ===
To solve the problem with the high output resistance of the simple output stage the second schematic adds to this a &quot;totem-pole&quot; (&quot;push–pull&quot;) output. It consists of the two n-p-n transistors V3 and V4, the &quot;lifting&quot; diode V5 and the current-limiting resistor R3 (see the figure on the right). It is driven by applying the same &quot;current steering&quot; idea as above.

When V2 is &quot;off&quot;, V4 is &quot;off&quot; as well and V3 operates in active region as a voltage follower producing high output voltage (logical &quot;1&quot;).

When V2 is &quot;on&quot;, it activates V4, driving low voltage (logical &quot;0&quot;) to the output. Again there is a current-steering effect: the series combination of V2&#x27;s C-E junction and V4&#x27;s B-E junction is in parallel with the series of V3 B-E, V5&#x27;s anode-cathode junction, and V4 C-E. The second series combination has the higher threshold voltage, so no current flows through it, i.e. V3 base current is deprived. Transistor V3 turns &quot;off&quot; and it does not impact on the output.

In the middle of the transition, the resistor R3 limits the current flowing directly through the series connected transistor V3, diode V5 and transistor V4 that are all conducting. It also limits the output current in the case of output logical &quot;1&quot; and short connection to the ground. The strength of the gate may be increased without proportionally affecting the power consumption by removing the pull-up and pull-down resistors from the output stage.

The main advantage of TTL with a &quot;totem-pole&quot; output stage is the low output resistance at output logical &quot;1&quot;. It is determined by the upper output transistor V3 operating in active region as an emitter follower. The resistor R3 does not increase the output resistance since it is connected in the V3 collector and its influence is compensated by the negative feedback. A disadvantage of the &quot;totem-pole&quot; output stage is the decreased voltage level (no more than 3.5 V) of the output logical &quot;1&quot; (even if the output is unloaded). The reasons for this reduction are the voltage drops across the V3 base–emitter and V5 anode–cathode junctions.

== Interfacing considerations ==
Like DTL, TTL is a &quot;current-sinking logic&quot; since a current must be drawn from inputs to bring them to a logic 0 voltage level. The driving stage must absorb up to 1.6 mA from a standard TTL input while not allowing the voltage to rise to more than 0.4 volts. The output stage of the most common TTL gates is specified to function correctly when driving up to 10 standard input stages (a fanout of 10). TTL inputs are sometimes simply left floating to provide a logical &quot;1&quot;, though this usage is not recommended.

Standard TTL circuits operate with a 5-volt power supply. A TTL input signal is defined as &quot;low&quot; when between 0 V and 0.8 V with respect to the ground terminal, and &quot;high&quot; when between 2 V and VCC (5 V), and if a voltage signal ranging between 0.8 V and 2.0 V is sent into the input of a TTL gate, there is no certain response from the gate and therefore it is considered &quot;uncertain&quot; (precise logic levels vary slightly between sub-types and by temperature). TTL outputs are typically restricted to narrower limits of between 0.0 V and 0.4 V for a &quot;low&quot; and between 2.4 V and VCC for a &quot;high&quot;, providing at least 0.4 V of noise immunity. Standardization of the TTL levels is so ubiquitous that complex circuit boards often contain TTL chips made by many different manufacturers selected for availability and cost, compatibility being assured. Two circuit board units off the same assembly line on different successive days or weeks might have a different mix of brands of chips in the same positions on the board; repair is possible with chips manufactured years later than original components. Within usefully broad limits, logic gates can be treated as ideal Boolean devices without concern for electrical limitations. The 0.4 V noise margins are adequate because of the low output impedance of the driver stage, that is, a large amount of noise power superimposed on the output is needed to drive an input into an undefined region.

In some cases (e.g., when the output of a TTL logic gate needs to be used for driving the input of a CMOS gate), the voltage level of the &quot;totem-pole&quot; output stage at output logical &quot;1&quot; can be increased closer to VCC by connecting an external resistor between the V4 collector and the positive rail. It pulls up the V5 cathode and cuts-off the diode. However, this technique actually converts the sophisticated &quot;totem-pole&quot; output into a simple output stage having significant output resistance when driving a high level (determined by the external resistor).

==Packaging==
Like most integrated circuits of the period 1963–1990, commercial TTL devices are usually packaged in dual in-line packages (DIPs), usually with 14 to 24 pins, for through-hole or socket mounting. Epoxy plastic (PDIP) packages were often used for commercial temperature range components, while ceramic packages (CDIP) were used for military temperature range parts.

Beam-lead chip dies without packages were made for assembly into larger arrays as hybrid integrated circuits. Parts for military and aerospace applications were packaged in flatpacks, a form of surface-mount package, with leads suitable for welding or soldering to printed circuit boards. Today, many TTL-compatible devices are available in surface-mount packages, which are available in a wider array of types than through-hole packages.

TTL is particularly well suited to bipolar integrated circuits because additional inputs to a gate merely required additional emitters on a shared base region of the input transistor. If individually packaged transistors were used, the cost of all the transistors would discourage one from using such an input structure. But in an integrated circuit, the additional emitters for extra gate inputs add only a small area.

At least one computer manufacturer, IBM, built its own flip chip integrated circuits with TTL; these chips were mounted on ceramic multi-chip modules.

==Comparison with other logic families==
TTL devices consume substantially more power than equivalent CMOS devices at rest, but power consumption does not increase with clock speed as rapidly as for CMOS devices. Compared to contemporary ECL circuits, TTL uses less power and has easier design rules but is substantially slower. Designers can combine ECL and TTL devices in the same system to achieve best overall performance and economy, but level-shifting devices are required between the two logic families. TTL is less sensitive to damage from electrostatic discharge than early CMOS devices.

Due to the output structure of TTL devices, the output impedance is asymmetrical between the high and low state, making them unsuitable for driving transmission lines. This drawback is usually overcome by buffering the outputs with special line-driver devices where signals need to be sent through cables. ECL, by virtue of its symmetric low-impedance output structure, does not have this drawback.

The TTL &quot;totem-pole&quot; output structure often has a momentary overlap when both the upper and lower transistors are conducting, resulting in a substantial pulse of current drawn from the power supply. These pulses can couple in unexpected ways between multiple integrated circuit packages, resulting in reduced noise margin and lower performance. TTL systems usually have a decoupling capacitor for every one or two IC packages, so that a current pulse from one TTL chip does not momentarily reduce the supply voltage to another.

Since the mid 1980s, several manufacturers supply CMOS logic equivalents with TTL-compatible input and output levels, usually bearing part numbers similar to the equivalent TTL component and with the same pinouts. For example, the 74HCT00 series provides many drop-in replacements for bipolar 7400 series parts, but uses CMOS technology. (The &quot;T&quot; in &quot;HCT&quot; stands for &quot;TTL-compatible&quot;. The related 74HC00 series also uses CMOS technology but is not TTL-compatible.)

==Sub-types==
Successive generations of technology produced compatible parts with improved power consumption or switching speed, or both. Although vendors uniformly marketed these various product lines as TTL with Schottky diodes, some of the underlying circuits, such as used in the LS family, could rather be considered DTL.

Variations of and successors to the basic TTL family, which has a typical gate propagation delay of 10ns and a power dissipation of 10 mW per gate, for a power–delay product (PDP) or switching energy of about 100 pJ, include:

* Low-power TTL (L), which traded switching speed (33ns) for a reduction in power consumption (1 mW) (now essentially replaced by CMOS logic)
* High-speed TTL (H), with faster switching than standard TTL (6ns) but significantly higher power dissipation (22 mW)
* Schottky TTL (S), introduced in 1969, which used Schottky diode clamps at gate inputs to prevent charge storage and improve switching time. These gates operated more quickly (3ns) but had higher power dissipation (19 mW)
* Low-power Schottky TTL (LS) – used the higher resistance values of low-power TTL and the Schottky diodes to provide a good combination of speed (9.5 ns) and reduced power consumption (2 mW), and PDP of about 20 pJ. Probably the most common type of TTL, these were used as glue logic in microcomputers, essentially replacing the former H, L, and S sub-families.
* Fast (F) and Advanced-Schottky (AS) variants of LS from Fairchild and TI, respectively, circa 1985, with &quot;Miller-killer&quot; circuits to speed up the low-to-high transition. These families achieved PDPs of 10 pJ and 4 pJ, respectively, the lowest of all the TTL families.
* Low-voltage TTL (LVTTL) for 3.3-volt power supplies and memory interfacing.

Most manufacturers offer commercial and extended temperature ranges: for example Texas Instruments 7400 series parts are rated from 0 to 70 °C, and 5400 series devices over the military-specification temperature range of −55 to +125 °C.

Special quality levels and high-reliability parts are available for military and aerospace applications.

Radiation-hardened devices (for example from the SNJ54 series) are offered for space applications.

==Applications==
Before the advent of VLSI devices, TTL integrated circuits were a standard method of construction for the processors of minicomputer and midrange mainframe computers, such as the DEC VAX and Data General Eclipse; however some computer families were based on proprietary components (e.g. Fairchild CTL) while supercomputers and high-end mainframes used emitter-coupled logic. They were also used for equipment such as machine tool numerical controls, printers and video display terminals, and as microprocessors became more functional for &quot;glue logic&quot; applications, such as address decoders and bus drivers, which tie together the function blocks realized in VLSI elements. The Gigatron TTL is a more recent (2018) example of a processor built entirely with TTL integrated circuits.

=== Analog applications ===
While originally designed to handle logic-level digital signals, a TTL inverter can be biased as an analog amplifier. Connecting a resistor between the output and the input biases the TTL element as a negative feedback amplifier. Such amplifiers may be useful to convert analog signals to the digital domain but would not ordinarily be used where analog amplification is the primary purpose. TTL inverters can also be used in crystal oscillators where their analog amplification ability is significant.

A TTL gate may operate inadvertently as an analog amplifier if the input is connected to a slowly changing input signal that traverses the unspecified region from 0.8 V to 2 V. The output can be erratic when the input is in this range. A slowly changing input like this can also cause excess power dissipation in the output circuit. If such an analog input must be used, there are specialized TTL parts with Schmitt trigger inputs available that will reliably convert the analog input to a digital value, effectively operating as a one bit A to D converter.

=== Serial signaling ===
TTL serial refers to single-ended serial communication using raw transistor voltage levels: &quot;low&quot; for 0 and &quot;high&quot; for 1. UART over TTL serial is a common debug interface for embedded devices. Handheld devices such as graphing calculators and GPS receivers and fishfinders also commonly use UART with TTL. TTL serial is only a &quot;de facto&quot; standard: there are no strict electrical guidelines. Driver–receiver modules interface between TTL and longer-range serial standards: one example is the MAX232, which converts from and to RS-232.

Differential TTL is TTL serial carried over a differential pair with complement levels, providing much enhanced noise tolerance. Both RS-422 and RS-485 signals can be produced using TTL levels.

ccTalk is based on TTL voltage levels.

<text>In computer science, an instruction set architecture (ISA) is an abstract model that generally defines how software controls the CPU in a computer or a family of computers. A device or program that executes instructions described by that ISA, such as a central processing unit (CPU), is called an &quot;implementation&quot; of that ISA.

In general, an ISA defines the supported instructions, data types, registers, the hardware support for managing main memory, fundamental features (such as the memory consistency, addressing modes, virtual memory), and the input/output model of implementations of the ISA.

An ISA specifies the behavior of machine code running on implementations of that ISA in a fashion that does not depend on the characteristics of that implementation, providing binary compatibility between implementations. This enables multiple implementations of an ISA that differ in characteristics such as performance, physical size, and monetary cost (among other things), but that are capable of running the same machine code, so that a lower-performance, lower-cost machine can be replaced with a higher-cost, higher-performance machine without having to replace software. It also enables the evolution of the microarchitectures of the implementations of that ISA, so that a newer, higher-performance implementation of an ISA can run software that runs on previous generations of implementations.

If an operating system maintains a standard and compatible application binary interface (ABI) for a particular ISA, machine code will run on future implementations of that ISA and operating system. However, if an ISA supports running multiple operating systems, it does not guarantee that machine code for one operating system will run on another operating system, unless the first operating system supports running machine code built for the other operating system.

An ISA can be extended by adding instructions or other capabilities, or adding support for larger addresses and data values; an implementation of the extended ISA will still be able to execute machine code for versions of the ISA without those extensions. Machine code using those extensions will only run on implementations that support those extensions.

The binary compatibility that they provide makes ISAs one of the most fundamental abstractions in computing.

==Overview==
An instruction set architecture is distinguished from a microarchitecture, which is the set of processor design techniques used, in a particular processor, to implement the instruction set. Processors with different microarchitectures can share a common instruction set. For example, the Intel Pentium and the AMD Athlon implement nearly identical versions of the x86 instruction set, but they have radically different internal designs.

The concept of an &quot;architecture&quot;, distinct from the design of a specific machine, was developed by Fred Brooks at IBM during the design phase of System/360. 

Some virtual machines that support bytecode as their ISA such as Smalltalk, the Java virtual machine, and Microsoft&#x27;s Common Language Runtime, implement this by translating the bytecode for commonly used code paths into native machine code. In addition, these virtual machines execute less frequently used code paths by interpretation (see: Just-in-time compilation). Transmeta implemented the x86 instruction set atop VLIW processors in this fashion.

==Classification of ISAs==
An ISA may be classified in a number of different ways. A common classification is by architectural &quot;complexity&quot;. A complex instruction set computer (CISC) has many specialized instructions, some of which may only be rarely used in practical programs. A reduced instruction set computer (RISC) simplifies the processor by efficiently implementing only the instructions that are frequently used in programs, while the less common operations are implemented as subroutines, having their resulting additional processor execution time offset by infrequent use.

Other types include very long instruction word (VLIW) architectures, and the closely related and &quot;explicitly parallel instruction computing&quot; (EPIC) architectures. These architectures seek to exploit instruction-level parallelism with less hardware than RISC and CISC by making the compiler responsible for instruction issue and scheduling.

Architectures with even less complexity have been studied, such as the minimal instruction set computer (MISC) and one-instruction set computer (OISC). These are theoretically important types, but have not been commercialized.

==Instructions==
Machine language is built up from discrete &quot;statements&quot; or &quot;instructions&quot;. On the processing architecture, a given instruction may specify:
*opcode (the instruction to be performed) e.g. add, copy, test
*any explicit operands:
::registers
::literal/constant values
::addressing modes used to access memory
More complex operations are built up by combining these simple instructions, which are executed sequentially, or as otherwise directed by control flow instructions.

===Instruction types===
Examples of operations common to many instruction sets include:

====Data handling and memory operations====
*&quot;Set&quot; a register to a fixed constant value.
*&quot;Copy&quot; data from a memory location or a register to a memory location or a register (a machine instruction is often called &quot;move&quot;; however, the term is misleading). They are used to store the contents of a register, the contents of another memory location or the result of a computation, or to retrieve stored data to perform a computation on it later. They are often called &quot;load&quot; or &quot;store&quot; operations.
*&quot;Read&quot; or &quot;write&quot; data from hardware devices.

====Arithmetic and logic operations====
*&quot;Add&quot;, &quot;subtract&quot;, &quot;multiply&quot;, or &quot;divide&quot; the values of two registers, placing the result in a register, possibly setting one or more condition codes in a status register.
**&#x27;, &#x27; in some ISAs, saving operand fetch in trivial cases.
*Perform bitwise operations, e.g., taking the &quot;conjunction&quot; and &quot;disjunction&quot; of corresponding bits in a pair of registers, taking the &quot;negation&quot; of each bit in a register.
*&quot;Compare&quot; two values in registers (for example, to see if one is less, or if they are equal).
*&quot;s&quot; for arithmetic on floating-point numbers.

====Control flow operations====
*&quot;Branch&quot; to another location in the program and execute instructions there.
*&quot;Conditionally branch&quot; to another location if a certain condition holds.
*&quot;Indirectly branch&quot; to another location.
*&quot;Call&quot; another block of code, while saving the location of the next instruction as a point to return to.

====Coprocessor instructions====
*Load/store data to and from a coprocessor or exchanging with CPU registers.
*Perform coprocessor operations.

===Complex instructions===
Processors may include &quot;complex&quot; instructions in their instruction set. A single &quot;complex&quot; instruction does something that may take many instructions on other computers. Such instructions are typified by instructions that take multiple steps, control multiple functional units, or otherwise appear on a larger scale than the bulk of simple instructions implemented by the given processor. Some examples of &quot;complex&quot; instructions include:

*transferring multiple registers to or from memory (especially the stack) at once
*moving large blocks of memory (e.g. string copy or DMA transfer)
*complicated integer and floating-point arithmetic (e.g. square root, or transcendental functions such as logarithm, sine, cosine, etc.)
*&quot;s&quot;, a single instruction performing an operation on many homogeneous values in parallel, possibly in dedicated SIMD registers
*performing an atomic test-and-set instruction or other read–modify–write atomic instruction
*instructions that perform ALU operations with an operand from memory rather than a register

Complex instructions are more common in CISC instruction sets than in RISC instruction sets, but RISC instruction sets may include them as well. RISC instruction sets generally do not include ALU operations with memory operands, or instructions to move large blocks of memory, but most RISC instruction sets include SIMD or vector instructions that perform the same arithmetic operation on multiple pieces of data at the same time. SIMD instructions have the ability of manipulating large vectors and matrices in minimal time. SIMD instructions allow easy parallelization of algorithms commonly involved in sound, image, and video processing. Various SIMD implementations have been brought to market under trade names such as MMX, 3DNow!, and AltiVec.

===Instruction encoding===
On traditional architectures, an instruction includes an opcode that specifies the operation to perform, such as &quot;add contents of memory to register&quot;—and zero or more operand specifiers, which may specify registers, memory locations, or literal data. The operand specifiers may have addressing modes determining their meaning or may be in fixed fields. In very long instruction word (VLIW) architectures, which include many microcode architectures, multiple simultaneous opcodes and operands are specified in a single instruction.

Some exotic instruction sets do not have an opcode field, such as transport triggered architectures (TTA), only operand(s).

Most stack machines have &quot;0-operand&quot; instruction sets in which arithmetic and logical operations lack any operand specifier fields; only instructions that push operands onto the evaluation stack or that pop operands from the stack into variables have operand specifiers. The instruction set carries out most ALU actions with postfix (reverse Polish notation) operations that work only on the expression stack, not on data registers or arbitrary main memory cells. This can be very convenient for compiling high-level languages, because most arithmetic expressions can be easily translated into postfix notation.
Conditional instructions often have a predicate field—a few bits that encode the specific condition to cause an operation to be performed rather than not performed. For example, a conditional branch instruction will transfer control if the condition is true, so that execution proceeds to a different part of the program, and not transfer control if the condition is false, so that execution continues sequentially. Some instruction sets also have conditional moves, so that the move will be executed, and the data stored in the target location, if the condition is true, and not executed, and the target location not modified, if the condition is false. Similarly, IBM z/Architecture has a conditional store instruction. A few instruction sets include a predicate field in every instruction.

====Number of operands====
Instruction sets may be categorized by the maximum number of operands &quot;explicitly&quot; specified in instructions.

(In the examples that follow, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;c&quot; are (direct or calculated) addresses referring to memory cells, while &quot;reg1&quot; and so on refer to machine registers.)

 C = A+B

*0-operand (&quot;zero-address machines&quot;), so called stack machines: All arithmetic operations take place using the top one or two positions on the stack: codice_1, codice_2, codice_3, codice_4.
**codice_5 needs &quot;four instructions&quot;. For stack machines, the terms &quot;0-operand&quot; and &quot;zero-address&quot; apply to arithmetic instructions, but not to all instructions, as 1-operand push and pop instructions are used to access memory.
*1-operand (&quot;one-address machines&quot;), so called accumulator machines, include early computers and many small microcontrollers: most instructions specify a single right operand (that is, constant, a register, or a memory location), with the implicit accumulator as the left operand (and the destination if there is one): codice_6, codice_7, codice_8.
**codice_5 needs &quot;three instructions&quot;.
*2-operand — many CISC and RISC machines fall under this category:
**CISC — codice_10 to &quot;C&quot;; then codice_11 to &quot;C&quot;.
***codice_5 needs &quot;two instructions&quot;. This effectively &#x27;stores&#x27; the result without an explicit &quot;store&quot; instruction.
**CISC — Often machines are limited to one memory operand per instruction: codice_13; codice_14; codice_15; This requires a load/store pair for any memory movement regardless of whether the codice_3 result is an augmentation stored to a different place, as in codice_5, or the same memory location: codice_18.
***codice_5 needs &quot;three instructions&quot;.
**RISC — Requiring explicit memory loads, the instructions would be: codice_13; codice_21; codice_22; codice_23.
***codice_5 needs &quot;four instructions&quot;.
*3-operand, allowing better reuse of data:
**CISC — It becomes either a single instruction: codice_25
***codice_5 needs &quot;one instruction&quot;.
**CISC — Or, on machines limited to two memory operands per instruction, codice_27; codice_28;

*more operands—some CISC machines permit a variety of addressing modes that allow more than 3 operands (registers or memory accesses), such as the VAX &quot;POLY&quot; polynomial evaluation instruction.

Due to the large number of bits needed to encode the three registers of a 3-operand instruction, RISC architectures that have 16-bit instructions are invariably 2-operand designs, such as the Atmel AVR, TI MSP430, and some versions of ARM Thumb. RISC architectures that have 32-bit instructions are usually 3-operand designs, such as the ARM, AVR32, MIPS, Power ISA, and SPARC architectures.

Each instruction specifies some number of operands (registers, memory locations, or immediate values) &quot;explicitly&quot;. Some instructions give one or both operands implicitly, such as by being stored on top of the stack or in an implicit register. If some of the operands are given implicitly, fewer operands need be specified in the instruction. When a &quot;destination operand&quot; explicitly specifies the destination, an additional operand must be supplied. Consequently, the number of operands encoded in an instruction may differ from the mathematically necessary number of arguments for a logical or arithmetic operation (the arity). Operands are either encoded in the &quot;opcode&quot; representation of the instruction, or else are given as values or addresses following the opcode.

===Register pressure===
&quot;Register pressure&quot; measures the availability of free registers at any point in time during the program execution. Register pressure is high when a large number of the available registers are in use; thus, the higher the register pressure, the more often the register contents must be spilled into memory. Increasing the number of registers in an architecture decreases register pressure but increases the cost.

While embedded instruction sets such as Thumb suffer from extremely high register pressure because they have small register sets, general-purpose RISC ISAs like MIPS and Alpha enjoy low register pressure. CISC ISAs like x86-64 offer low register pressure despite having smaller register sets. This is due to the many addressing modes and optimizations (such as sub-register addressing, memory operands in ALU instructions, absolute addressing, PC-relative addressing, and register-to-register spills) that CISC ISAs offer.

===Instruction length===
The size or length of an instruction varies widely, from as little as four bits in some microcontrollers to many hundreds of bits in some VLIW systems. Processors used in personal computers, mainframes, and supercomputers have minimum instruction sizes between 8 and 64 bits. The longest possible instruction on x86 is 15 bytes (120 bits). Within an instruction set, different instructions may have different lengths. In some architectures, notably most reduced instruction set computers (RISC), , typically corresponding with that architecture&#x27;s word size. In other architectures, instructions have variable length, typically integral multiples of a byte or a halfword. Some, such as the ARM with &quot;Thumb-extension&quot; have &quot;mixed&quot; variable encoding, that is two fixed, usually 32-bit and 16-bit encodings, where instructions cannot be mixed freely but must be switched between on a branch (or exception boundary in ARMv8).

Fixed-length instructions are less complicated to handle than variable-length instructions for several reasons (not having to check whether an instruction straddles a cache line or virtual memory page boundary, for instance), and are therefore somewhat easier to optimize for speed.

===Code density===
In early 1960s computers, main memory was expensive and very limited, even on mainframes. Minimizing the size of a program to make sure it would fit in the limited memory was often central. Thus the size of the instructions needed to perform a particular task, the &quot;code density&quot;, was an important characteristic of any instruction set. It remained important on the initially-tiny memories of minicomputers and then microprocessors. Density remains important today, for smartphone applications, applications downloaded into browsers over slow Internet connections, and in ROMs for embedded applications. A more general advantage of increased density is improved effectiveness of caches and instruction prefetch. 

Computers with high code density often have complex instructions for procedure entry, parameterized returns, loops, etc. (therefore retroactively named &quot;Complex Instruction Set Computers&quot;, CISC). However, more typical, or frequent, &quot;CISC&quot; instructions merely combine a basic ALU operation, such as &quot;add&quot;, with the access of one or more operands in memory (using addressing modes such as direct, indirect, indexed, etc.). Certain architectures may allow two or three operands (including the result) directly in memory or may be able to perform functions such as automatic pointer increment, etc. Software-implemented instruction sets may have even more complex and powerful instructions.

&quot;Reduced instruction-set computers&quot;, RISC, were first widely implemented during a period of rapidly growing memory subsystems. They sacrifice code density to simplify implementation circuitry, and try to increase performance via higher clock frequencies and more registers. A single RISC instruction typically performs only a single operation, such as an &quot;add&quot; of registers or a &quot;load&quot; from a memory location into a register. A RISC instruction set normally has a fixed instruction length, whereas a typical CISC instruction set has instructions of widely varying length. However, as RISC computers normally require more and often longer instructions to implement a given task, they inherently make less optimal use of bus bandwidth and cache memories.

Certain embedded RISC ISAs like Thumb and AVR32 typically exhibit very high density owing to a technique called code compression. This technique packs two 16-bit instructions into one 32-bit word, which is then unpacked at the decode stage and executed as two instructions.

Minimal instruction set computers (MISC) are commonly a form of stack machine, where there are few separate instructions (8–32), so that multiple instructions can be fit into a single machine word. These types of cores often take little silicon to implement, so they can be easily realized in an FPGA or in a multi-core form. The code density of MISC is similar to the code density of RISC; the increased instruction density is offset by requiring more of the primitive instructions to do a task.
There has been research into executable compression as a mechanism for improving code density. The mathematics of Kolmogorov complexity describes the challenges and limits of this.

In practice, code density is also dependent on the compiler. Most optimizing compilers have options that control whether to optimize code generation for execution speed or for code density. For instance GCC has the option codice_35 to optimize for small machine code size, and codice_36 to optimize for execution speed at the cost of larger machine code.

===Representation===
The instructions constituting a program are rarely specified using their internal, numeric form (machine code); they may be specified by programmers using an assembly language or, more commonly, may be generated from high-level programming languages by compilers.

==Design==
The design of instruction sets is a complex issue. There were two stages in history for the microprocessor. The first was the CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer), which had many different instructions. In the 1970s, however, places like IBM did research and found that many instructions in the set could be eliminated. The result was the RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer), an architecture that uses a smaller set of instructions. A simpler instruction set may offer the potential for higher speeds, reduced processor size, and reduced power consumption. However, a more complex set may optimize common operations, improve memory and cache efficiency, or simplify programming.

Some instruction set designers reserve one or more opcodes for some kind of system call or software interrupt. For example, MOS Technology 6502 uses 00H, Zilog Z80 uses the eight codes C7,CF,D7,DF,E7,EF,F7,FFH while Motorola 68000 use codes in the range A000..AFFFH. 

Fast virtual machines are much easier to implement if an instruction set meets the Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements.

The NOP slide used in immunity-aware programming is much easier to implement if the &quot;unprogrammed&quot; state of the memory is interpreted as a NOP.

On systems with multiple processors, non-blocking synchronization algorithms are much easier to implement if the instruction set includes support for something such as &quot;fetch-and-add&quot;, &quot;load-link/store-conditional&quot; (LL/SC), or &quot;atomic compare-and-swap&quot;.

==Instruction set implementation==

A given instruction set can be implemented in a variety of ways. All ways of implementing a particular instruction set provide the same programming model, and all implementations of that instruction set are able to run the same executables. The various ways of implementing an instruction set give different tradeoffs between cost, performance, power consumption, size, etc.

When designing the microarchitecture of a processor, engineers use blocks of &quot;hard-wired&quot; electronic circuitry (often designed separately) such as adders, multiplexers, counters, registers, ALUs, etc. Some kind of register transfer language is then often used to describe the decoding and sequencing of each instruction of an ISA using this physical microarchitecture.
There are two basic ways to build a control unit to implement this description (although many designs use middle ways or compromises):

# Some computer designs &quot;hardwire&quot; the complete instruction set decoding and sequencing (just like the rest of the microarchitecture).
# Other designs employ microcode routines or tables (or both) to do this, using ROMs or writable RAMs (writable control store), PLAs, or both.

Some microcoded CPU designs with a writable control store use it to allow the instruction set to be changed (for example, the Rekursiv processor and the Imsys Cjip).

CPUs designed for reconfigurable computing may use field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).

An ISA can also be emulated in software by an interpreter. Naturally, due to the interpretation overhead, this is slower than directly running programs on the emulated hardware, unless the hardware running the emulator is an order of magnitude faster. Today, it is common practice for vendors of new ISAs or microarchitectures to make software emulators available to software developers before the hardware implementation is ready.

Often the details of the implementation have a strong influence on the particular instructions selected for the instruction set. For example, many implementations of the instruction pipeline only allow a single memory load or memory store per instruction, leading to a load–store architecture (RISC). For another example, some early ways of implementing the instruction pipeline led to a delay slot.

The demands of high-speed digital signal processing have pushed in the opposite direction—forcing instructions to be implemented in a particular way. For example, to perform digital filters fast enough, the MAC instruction in a typical digital signal processor (DSP) must use a kind of Harvard architecture that can fetch an instruction and two data words simultaneously, and it requires a single-cycle multiply–accumulate multiplier.

<text>Maclisp (or MACLISP, sometimes styled MacLisp or MacLISP) is a programming language, a dialect of the language Lisp. It originated at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology&#x27;s (MIT) Project MAC (from which it derived its prefix) in the late 1960s and was based on Lisp 1.5. Richard Greenblatt was the main developer of the original codebase for the PDP-6; Jon L. White was responsible for its later maintenance and development. The name &quot;Maclisp&quot; began being used in the early 1970s to distinguish it from other forks of PDP-6 Lisp, notably BBN Lisp.

==History==
Maclisp is a descendant of Lisp 1.5. Maclisp departs from Lisp 1.5 by using a &quot;value cell&quot; to access and store the dynamic values of variables; Lisp 1.5 used a linear search of an association list to determine a variable&#x27;s value. The Maclisp variable evaluation is faster but has different variable semantics. Maclisp also employed reader macros to make more readable &quot;input&quot; and &quot;output&quot;, termed input/output (I/O). Instead of entering codice_1, one could enter codice_2 to get the same s-expression. Although both implementations put functions on the property list, Maclisp uses different syntax to define functions. Maclisp also has a load-on-demand feature.

Maclisp began on Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-6 and PDP-10 computers running the Incompatible Timesharing System (ITS); later it was ported to all other PDP-10 operating systems, for example, &quot;Timesharing / Total Operating System&quot;, TOPS-10 and TOPS-20. The original implementation was in assembly language, but a later implementation on Multics used PL/I. Maclisp developed considerably in its lifetime. Major features were added which in other language systems would typically correspond to major release numbers.

Maclisp was used to implement the Macsyma computer algebra system (CAS) or symbolic algebra program. Macsyma&#x27;s development also drove several features in Maclisp. The SHRDLU blocks-world program was written in Maclisp, and so the language was in widespread use in the artificial intelligence (AI) research community through the early 1980s. It was also used to implement other programming languages, such as Planner and Scheme. Multics Maclisp was used to implement the first Lisp-based Emacs.

Maclisp was an influential Lisp implementation, but is no longer maintained actively. It now runs on PDP-10 emulators and can be used for experimenting with early AI programs.

==Characteristics==
Maclisp began with a small, fixed number of data types: cons cell, atom (later termed &quot;symbol&quot;), integer, and floating-point number. Later additions included: arrays, which were never first-class data types; arbitrary-precision integers (bignums); strings; and tuples. All objects (except inums) were implemented as pointers, and their data type was determined by the block of memory into which it pointed, with a special case for small numbers (inums).

Programs could be &quot;interpreted&quot; or &quot;compiled&quot;. Compiled behavior was the same as interpreted except that local variables were lexical by default in compiled code, unless declared SPECIAL, and no error checking was done for inline operations such as CAR and CDR. The Ncomplr compiler (mid-1970s) introduced fast numeric support to Lisp languages, generating machine code (instructions) for arithmetic rather than calling interpretive routines which dispatched on data type. This made Lisp arithmetic comparable in speed to Fortran for scalar operations (though Fortran array and loop implementation remained much faster).

The original version was limited by the 18-bit word memory address of the PDP-10, and considerable effort was expended in keeping the implementation lean and simple. Multics Maclisp had a far larger address space, but was costly to use. When the memory and processing power of the PDP-10 were exceeded, the Lisp Machine was invented: Lisp Machine Lisp is the direct descendant of Maclisp. Several other Lisp dialects were also in use, and the need to unify the community resulted in the modern Common Lisp language.

==Name==
Maclisp was named for Project MAC, and is unrelated to Apple&#x27;s Macintosh (Mac) computer, which it predates by decades or to John McCarthy. The various Lisp systems for the Macintosh have no particular similarity to Maclisp.

<text>Lisp Machine Lisp is a programming language, a dialect of the language Lisp. A direct descendant of Maclisp, it was initially developed in the mid to late 1970s as the system programming language for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Lisp machines. Lisp Machine Lisp was also the Lisp dialect with the most influence on the design of Common Lisp.

Lisp Machine Lisp branched into three dialects. Symbolics named their variant ZetaLisp. Lisp Machines, Inc. and later Texas Instruments (with the TI Explorer) would share a common code base, but their dialect of Lisp Machine Lisp would differ from the version maintained at the MIT AI Lab by Richard Stallman and others.

==Manual==
The Lisp Machine Manual describes the Lisp Machine Lisp language in detail. The manual was popularly termed the &quot;Chine Nual&quot;, because the full title was printed across the front and back covers such that only those letters appeared on the front. This name is sometimes further abbreviated by blending the two words into &quot;Chinual&quot;.

==Traits==
Lisp Machine Lisp features include:
* Support for object-oriented programming via an object system named Flavors
* Uses dynamic binding, but supports closures with a special construct
* Integer numbers were read and printed in octal (base 8) by default
* Dividing floating point numbers returned decimals, dividing integers returned rational numbers (fractions)

<text>Pohnpei (formerly known as Ponape or Ascension, from Pohnpeian: &quot;upon (&quot;pohn&quot;) a stone altar (&quot;pei&quot;)&quot;) is an island of the Senyavin Islands which are part of the larger Caroline Islands group. It belongs to Pohnpei State, one of the four states in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM). Major population centers on Pohnpei include Palikir, the FSM&#x27;s capital, and Kolonia, the capital of Pohnpei State. Pohnpei is the largest island in the FSM, with an area of , and a highest point of , the most populous with 36,832 people, and the most developed single island in the FSM.

Pohnpei is home to the megaliths and ruined city of Nan Madol, built of artificial islands off the island&#x27;s eastern shore beginning in the 8th or 9th century. An important archaeological site, it was declared a national historic site in 1985.

Pohnpei contains a wealth of biodiversity. It is one of the wettest places on Earth with annual recorded rainfall exceeding each year in certain mountainous locations. It is home to the ka tree (&quot;Terminalia carolinensis&quot;) found only in Pohnpei and Kosrae.

==Name==
The name &quot;Pohnpei&quot; comes from the Pohnpeian language, literally meaning &quot;upon a stone altar&quot;. It derives from a Proto-Chuukic-Pohnpeic phrase &quot;*fawo ni pei&quot; of the same meaning. Cognates in other Micronesian languages include Mokilese &quot;Pohnpei&quot; and Chuukese &quot;Fóónupi&quot;.

==History==
The natives of Pohnpei, especially the &#x27;older&#x27; generations, often refer to events in their past as having occurred, e.g., in &quot;German times&quot; or &quot;before the Spaniards,&quot; which identifies the historical periods:

===Pre-colonial history===

The earliest settlers were probably Lapita culture people from the Southeast Solomon Islands or the Vanuatu archipelago. Pre-colonial history is divided into three eras: &quot;Mwehin Kawa&quot; or &quot;Mwehin Aramas&quot; (Period of Building, or Period of Peopling, before ); &quot;Mwehin Sau Deleur&quot; (Period of the Lord of Deleur, to ); and &quot;Mwehin Nahnmwarki&quot; (Period of the Nahnmwarki, to ). Pohnpeian legend recounts that the Saudeleur rulers, the first to bring government to Pohnpei, were of foreign origin. The Saudeleur centralized form of absolute rule is characterized in Pohnpeian legend as becoming increasingly oppressive over several generations. Arbitrary and onerous demands, as well as a reputation for offending Pohnpeian deities, sowed resentment among Pohnpeians. The Saudeleur Dynasty ended with the invasion of Isokelekel, another semi-mythical foreigner, who replaced the Saudeleur rule with the more decentralized &quot;nahnmwarki&quot; system in existence today.

Pohnpeian historic society was highly structured into five tribes, various clans and sub-clans; each tribe headed by two principal chiefs. The tribes were organized on a feudal basis. In theory, &quot;all land belonged to the chiefs, who received regular tribute and whose rule was absolute.&quot; Punishments administered by chiefs included death and banishment. Tribal wars included looting, destruction of houses and canoes and killing of prisoners. Pre-Spanish population estimates are deemed unreliable.

===Earliest European contacts===
Pohnpei&#x27;s first European visitor was Spanish navigator Álvaro de Saavedra on 14 September 1529 shortly before his death, when trying to find the way back to New Spain. He charted it as &quot;San Bartolomé&quot; and called this one and the surrounding islands as &quot;Los Pintados&quot; (literally, &quot;the painted ones&quot; in Spanish) because the natives were frequently tattooed. It was later visited by the navigator Pedro Fernandes de Queirós, commanding the Spanish ship &quot;San Jeronimo&quot;. on 23 December 1595; his description is brief, he made no attempt to land.

===19th-century visitors===
There is good documentation about Australian sailor John Henry Rowe, who arrived in his barque &quot;John Bull&quot; on 10 September 1825, though he did not land as his vessel was chased off by native canoes. The first lengthy description of the island and its inhabitants is presented by the Russian explorer Fyodor Litke, whose ship &quot;Senyavin&quot; gave the island group of Pohnpei, Ant and Pakin its name. From 14 to 19 January 1828, his boats attempted to land but could not due to the hostility shown by the islanders, but natives then came aboard his ship, &quot;some trading occurred, a short vocabulary was compiled, and a map made.&quot; F.H. von Kittlitz, a member of the Litke expedition made a further descriptive account, including the offshore ruins of Nan Madol, and the two reports together provided the first real knowledge of Pohnpei. It is not clear who the next visitors were; however, when Capt. J.H. Eagleston of the barque &quot;Peru&quot; sighted the island on 3 January 1832, it was already on his charts as &quot;Ascension Island.&quot; Riesenberg writes that it is uncertain who first called it Ascension Island, but the name became established until the Spanish period.

===Miscreants and missionaries===
From this time onward, whaling and trading vessels came in increasing numbers. Very soon a &quot;large colony of beachcombers, escaped convicts, and ship&#x27;s deserters became established ashore,&quot; identified as &quot;chiefly bad characters,&quot; according to the log of the Swedish frigate &quot;Eugenie&quot;. The first missionary to arrive was Father Louis Désiré Maigret, a Roman Catholic priest. He had sailed from Honolulu on the schooner &quot;Notre Dame de Paix&quot; and began his efforts in December 1837, but he departed on 29 July 1838 for Valparaíso after seven unsuccessful months. In his company were &quot;several Mangarevans and Tahitians,&quot; some of whom remained on Pohnpei and left descendants. Ten years later Maigret returned to the Hawaiian kingdom as Bishop of Honolulu. A group of Protestant missionaries from New England established themselves permanently on Pohnpei in 1852. Their letters and journals contain a wealth of information about the island and are preserved at Harvard University.

A drastic population decline occurred after 1854, due to a smallpox epidemic.

During the American Civil War, to counteract the United States blockade of their ports, Confederate States Navy ships hunted Yankee merchant shipping. On 1 April 1865, the &quot;CSS Shenandoah&quot; surprised four United States whalers at Ascension Island (Pohnpei) and destroyed them all. The local king, Nananierikie, was delighted to receive much of the spoils from this action.

===Spanish rule===
By 1886 the Spaniards claimed the Caroline Islands which were part of the Manila-based Spanish East Indies and began to exert political authority. They founded the city &quot;Santiago de la Ascensión&quot; in what today is &quot;Kolonia&quot; (from Spanish &quot;colonia&quot; or colony). The Spanish built several government buildings, a fort, a church and a school. Spanish Capuchin friars were also sent from Manila to Pohnpei to preach the Catholic faith. After the 1898 Spanish–American War, the German Empire purchased the Caroline island group from Spain in 1899 together with the Marianas (except Guam) and four years later the Marshall Islands for 17 million goldmark.

===German rule and land reform===
During the German administration a fundamental change in land ownership was implemented on Pohnpei and throughout the Carolines. Beginning in 1907, the feudal system, in which all land is held in fief, was gradually replaced with the issuance of individual deeds to land. The chief&#x27;s economic advantages were thus reduced, and only force of tradition granted a first harvest tribute to chiefs.

With land holding, taxes came due and new owners, in lieu of payment, were obliged to work 15 days per year on public projects, such as wharf construction, road building, etc. One such work for taxes engagement sparked the Sokehs Rebellion. It began as an insubordination event during road construction on Sokehs Island, then escalated into the murder of nine people, the subsequent apprehension and trial of 36 Sokehs rebels, the execution of 15 insurgents, and banishment for others to Babelthuap in the German Palau Islands.

The German census of 1911–12 shows 3,190 Pohnpeians, 585 Central Carolinians and 279 Melanesians. Many of the outer islands were resettled (mainly on Sokehs Island) as a consequence of destructive typhoons in their home islands.

A special census conducted in late 1947 shows a total population of 5,628, of which 4,451 were Pohnpeians, and 1,177 were natives of other Pacific islands. By 1963, the population had grown to nearly 10,000.

===Japanese rule===

With the Treaty of Versailles, Japan as mandatory power assumed control of all German colonial possessions north of the equator, having occupied Pohnpei along with the rest of the Carolines, the Marshalls, the Marianas (except for American-owned Guam) and Kiautschou Bay during World War I. In subsequent years and during World War II the Japanese garrison strength was composed of about 2,000 men of the IJN under Captain Jun Naito and 5,984 IJA men under Lieutenant General Masao Watanabe. However, Pohnpei was bypassed by the United States Navy during the island-hopping amphibious campaigns of 1943–1945.

The island was shelled on several occasions, including by the battleships USS &quot;Massachusetts&quot;, USS &quot;Alabama&quot;, and , as well as air attacks launched from USS &quot;Cowpens&quot;. Japan surrendered in 1945, and the Pohnpei was turned over to the United States without a battle. After the war, Japanese nationals were repatriated to Japan by the US Navy. The people on Pohnpei would be in a United Nations trusteeship to determine their own fate.

===United States administration, under United Nations oversight===

The Federated States of Micronesia achieved independence in 1986 after being administered by the United States under UN auspices since 1947 as part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. Pohnpei is an island part of Federated States of Micronesia, which is recognized by the United Nations. It has maintained a defense and aid agreement with the United States after becoming independent.

==Geography==

The highest point of the island is Mount Nanlaud at 772 or 782 metres. Pohnpei is home to several dozen bird species including four endemic species, the Pohnpei lorikeet, the Pohnpei fantail, the Pohnpei flycatcher and the long-billed white-eye. A fifth endemic, the Pohnpei starling, is thought to have recently gone extinct.

The only land reptiles are a few species of lizard. Originally the only mammals were bats. Pigs, rats and dogs were introduced; pigs have become feral. The lagoons are rich in fish, molluscs, turtles and other marine fauna.

===Climate===

Pohnpei belongs to the tropical rainforest climate zone (Köppen: &quot;Af&quot;). It is one of the wettest places on Earth with an average annual recorded rainfall of in towns along the coast and about each year in certain mountainous locations.
==Demographics==
The population of the state in 2010 was approximately 36,196. While the majority of the population consider themselves ethnic Pohnpeians, Pohnpei is more ethnically diverse than any other island in the FSM. This is largely due to more than a century of foreign colonial occupation, bringing in Spanish, German, Japanese, Chamorro, Filipino, US, Australian, other western Europeans, and it being home to the capital of the national government, which employs hundreds of people from the other three FSM States (Yap, Chuuk, Kosrae) having distinct ethnic and cultural origins. The indigenous makeup also includes the multiple regional ethnicities of the outer islands within Pohnpei State, resulting in a mix of Australasian Pacific Islanders and hence making Pohnpei Island the FSM&#x27;s melting pot.

===Languages===
The Pohnpeian language (formerly called &quot;Ponapean&quot;) and its dialects are the indigenous languages of Pohnpei. The Federated States of Micronesia government also uses Pohnpeian as a regional language.
English and Spanish are spoken in the island.

==Administrative divisions==
The municipalities on the island of Pohnpei are:

* Kitti, southwest. Includes Ant Atoll
* Kolonia, north
* Madolenihmw, east
* Nett (main island, north/center, formerly including state capital Kolonia on the north coast)
* Sokehs, northwest. Also includes Pakin Atoll and Palikir, the national capital
* U, northeast

==Transportation==
Pohnpei International Airport (IATA code PNI) is located near Kolonia, on a small island named Deketik off the northern coast of the main island.

==Sport==
The FSM is part of the international Olympic movement, originally the work of James Tobin, who now sits on the IOC Executive Board, sending teams to the summer games beginning in 2000 with the Sydney games and continuing every four years to the present with athletes participating in track and field, swimming and weightlifting. The most notable Pohnpeian athlete is marathon runner Elias Rodriguez who ran for the FSM at the Sydney Olympics. Rodriguez finished last in the marathon but was cheered on by tens of thousands of spectators and watched by millions of television viewers as he entered the Olympic stadium for a final lap immediately prior to the closing ceremony which was delayed to allow his finish.

Pohnpei&#x27;s state football team were coached by the world&#x27;s youngest national football coach, the Englishman Paul Watson, who led the team on a tour of nearby Guam, winning one match against a local team. The annual Micronesian Futsal Cup has been established on the island, also the work of Watson.

==Pohnpei in fiction==
Pohnpei (as Ponape) plays a role in several stories of the Cthulhu Mythos by H. P. Lovecraft and others. Its role in &quot;Out of the Aeons&quot;, by Lovecraft and Hazel Heald, was inspired by the ruins of Nan Madol (see above), which had already been used as the setting for a lost race story by Abraham Merritt, &quot;The Moon Pool&quot;, in which the islands are called Nan-Matal.

Pohnpei is a central location in &quot;South Sea Adventure&quot; (1952), the second of Willard Price&#x27;s Young Adult Adventure Series books featuring Hal and Roger Hunt.

Pohnpei, or &quot;Ponape&quot; as it is spelled, is stated as the home island of &quot;Mike&quot; on the popular blog &quot;Dunce Upon A Time&quot;, authored by BC Woods.

<text>Białystok is the largest city in northeastern Poland and the capital of the Podlaskie Voivodeship. It is the tenth-largest city in Poland, second in terms of population density, and thirteenth in area.

Białystok is located in the Białystok Uplands of the Podlachian Plain on the banks of the Biała River, 200 km (124 mi) northeast of Warsaw. It has historically attracted migrants from elsewhere in Poland and beyond, particularly from Central and Eastern Europe. This is facilitated by the nearby border with Belarus also being the eastern border of the European Union, as well as the Schengen Area. The city and its adjacent municipalities constitute Metropolitan Białystok. The city has a warm summer continental climate, characterized by warm summers and long frosty winters. Forests are an important part of Białystok&#x27;s character and occupy around (18% of the administrative area of the city) which places it as the fifth-most forested city in Poland.

The first settlers arrived in the 14th century. The town grew and received its municipal charter in 1692. Białystok has traditionally been one of the leading centers of academic, cultural, and artistic life in Podlachia, and the most important economic center in northeastern Poland. Białystok was once an important center for light industry, which was the reason for the substantial growth of the city&#x27;s population. The city continues to reshape itself into a modern middle-sized city. Białystok, in 2010, was on the short-list, but ultimately lost the competition, to become a finalist for European Capital of Culture in 2016.

==Etymology==
Although nowadays &quot;stok&quot; is translated as &quot;slope&quot;, the initial name of the settlement came from the river flowing through it. In old Polish, &quot;biały stok&quot; was white river (&quot;biały&quot; - white, &quot;stok&quot; - stream; river that &quot;slides&quot; down the slope). So inconspicuous today, the Biała River (usually called Białka), flowing through the city center, gave it its name.

Due to changing borders and demographics over the centuries, the city has been known as (&quot;Byelastok&quot;?, &quot;Biełastok&quot;? ), (&quot;Byalistok&quot;, &quot;Bjalistok&quot;), , and (&quot;Belostok&quot;, &quot;Byelostok&quot;).

==History==
===Early history===
Archaeological discoveries show that the first settlements in the area of present-day Białystok occurred during the Stone Age. Tombs of ancient settlers can be found in the district of Dojlidy. In the early Iron Age, people settled in the area producing kurgans, the tombs of the chiefs in the area located in the current village of Rostołty. Since then, the Białystok area has been at the crossroads of cultures. Trade routes linking the Baltic to the Black Sea favored the development of settlements with Yotvingia-Ruthenian-Polish cultural characteristics.

The city of Białystok has existed for five centuries and during this time the fate of the city has been affected by various political and economic forces.

Surviving documents attest that around 1437 a representative of the Raczków family, Jakub Tabutowicz of the coat of arms Łabędź, received from Michael Žygimantaitis, son of the Grand Duke of Lithuania Sigismund Kęstutaitis, a wilderness area along the river Biała that marked the beginning of Białystok as a settlement. Thereafter, Białystok was part of Lithuania for 132 years until the Union of Lublin in 1569, when it was restored to Poland but remained very close to its border with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania until the last partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795. Białystok was administratively part of the Podlaskie Voivodeship, after 1569 also part of the Lesser Poland Province of the Kingdom of Poland.

From 1547, the settlement was owned by the Wiesiołowski family, which founded the first school. The first brick church and a castle were built between 1617 and 1826. The two-floor castle, designed on a rectangular plan in the Gothic-Renaissance style, was the work of . Extension of the castle was continued by Krzysztof Wiesiołowski, starost of Tykocin, Grand Marshal of Lithuania since 1635, and husband of Aleksandra Marianna Sobieska. In 1637 he died childless, and as a result, Białystok came under the management of his widow. After her death in 1645 the Wiesiołowski estate, including Białystok, passed to the Crown to cover the costs of maintaining Tykocin Castle. In the years 1645–1659 Białystok was managed by the starosts of Tykocin.

===Flourishing aristocratic residential city===

In 1661 it was given to Stefan Czarniecki as a reward for his service in the victory over the Swedes during the Deluge. Four years later, it was given as a dowry of his daughter Aleksandra, who married Marshal of the Crown Court Jan Klemens Branicki, thus passing into the hands of the Branicki family. In 1692, , the son of Jan Klemens Branicki, obtained city rights for Białystok from King John III Sobieski. He constructed the Branicki Palace on the foundations of the castle of the Wiesiołowski family. In the first half of the eighteenth century the ownership of the city was inherited by Field Crown Hetman Jan Klemens Branicki. It was he who transformed the palace built by his father into a magnificent residence of a great noble, which was frequently visited by Polish kings and poets. In 1745 the first military technical school in Poland was founded in Białystok, and in 1748, one of the oldest theaters in Poland, the &quot;Komedialnia&quot;, was founded in the city. New schools were established, including a ballet school in connection with the foundation of the theater. In 1749, King Augustus III of Poland extended the city limits. In 1770, under the auspices of Izabella Poniatowska, a midwifery school was founded, based on which the Institute of Obstetrics was established in 1805. Białystok was a regional brewing center with 33 breweries as of 1771, with the Podlachian Beer now listed as a protected traditional beverage by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of Poland.

The end of the eighteenth century saw the division of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, in three partitions, among Poland&#x27;s neighboring states. The Kingdom of Prussia subjugated Białystok and the surrounding region during the third partition. The city became the capital of the New East Prussia province in 1795. Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s victory in the War of the Fourth Coalition freed the territory but as a result in the Treaties of Tilsit in 1807 the area was transferred to the Russian Empire, which organized the region into the Belostok Oblast, with the city as the regional center. Schooling and higher learning in Białystok, which was intensively developed in the 18th century, was stopped as a result of partitions.

===Industrial growth===

Białystok received city rights the latest from all of Podlasie&#x27;s cities, but at the end of the 19th century it outgrown all the surrounding cities. The rapid development in the 19th century is related to two historical events: the creation of a customs border between the Russian Empire and the Congress Kingdom of Poland, and the opening in 1862 of the Warsaw Saint Petersburg railway line, connecting Białystok with Warsaw, Grodno, Vilnius and Saint Petersburg. Very convenient communication conditions influenced the development and concentration of Białystok&#x27;s production plants at that time. Along with the administrative function, Białystok received many economic institutions. In the second half of the 19th century, Białystok grew into a significant center of the textile industry, the largest after Łódź in then-partitioned Poland. Białystok was the largest industrial center between Warsaw and Łódź in the west, Saint Petersburg in the north and Moscow in the east, and was nicknamed &quot;Manchester of the North&quot;. After the failed November and January uprisings, Russification policies and anti-Polish repressions intensified, and after 1870 a ban on the use of Polish in public places was introduced. In 1912, a Tsarist prison was built, which also served as a transit prison for Poles deported to Siberia.

At the end of the nineteenth century, as a result of the influx due to Russian discriminatory regulations, the majority of the city&#x27;s population was Jewish. According to Russian census of 1897, out of the total population of 66,000, Jews constituted 41,900 (so around 63% percent). This heritage can be seen on the Jewish Heritage Trail in Białystok. The Białystok pogrom occurred between 14 and 16 June 1906 with some 81 to 88 Jews killed by the Russians, and about 80 wounded.
The first anarchist groups to attract a significant following of Russian workers or peasants were the anarcho-communist Chernoe-Znamia groups, founded in Białystok in 1903.

During World War I the Bialystok-Grodno District was the administrative division of German-controlled territory of Ober-Ost. It comprised the city, as the capital, and the surrounding Podlaskie region, roughly corresponding to the territory of the earlier Belostok Oblast. At the end of World War I the city became part of the newly independent Second Polish Republic, as the capital of the Białystok Voivodeship. Białystok and the surroundings areas regained independence only on 19 February 1919, three months after the rest of Poland, due to delay in the departure of the German Army from the city. During the 1919–1920 Polish–Soviet War, possession of the city by the Red Army and the Provisional Polish Revolutionary Committee occurred during the lead up to the Battle of Warsaw. During the resultant counteroffensive, the city returned to Polish control after the Battle of Białystok.

After the wars and the reestablishment of independent Poland, Polish education in Białystok was restored and the textile industry was revived. A municipal public library was established, sports clubs were founded, including Jagiellonia Białystok, and in the 1930s a drama theater was built.

===World War II===
With the beginning of World War II, Poland was invaded by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. City president Seweryn Nowakowski established the Citizens&#x27; Guard. Due to the need to evacuate the police forces, the Guard took over its duties after September 11. In addition to the Police, a group of officials left along with selected archives. However, most of the residents of Białystok remained in the city. Initially Białystok was briefly occupied by Germany, and the German &quot;Einsatzgruppe IV&quot; entered the city on 20–21 September 1939 to commit crimes against the population. After occupying Białystok, the Germans established the Military City Command, which ordered the surrender of weapons and ammunition and the disbandment of the Citizens&#x27; Guard. On September 20, a brutal murder was committed in the courtyard of Primary School No. 1, where a transit camp for prisoners had been set up earlier. Wehrmacht soldiers murdered 8 people &quot;for disobedience&quot;. The next day, German troops began to withdraw from the city, where they were replaced by Red Army units, as a result of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact.

Under Soviet occupation, it was incorporated into the Byelorussian SSR from 1939 to 1941 as the capital of Belastok Region. Polish people were subject to deportations deep into the USSR (Siberia, Kazakhstan, Far North). Pre-war mayor Seweryn Nowakowski was arrested by the NKVD in October 1939 and probably also deported to the USSR, however his fate remains unknown. The NKVD took over the local prison. The Polish resistance movement was active in the city, which was the seat of one of the six main commands of the Union of Armed Struggle in occupied Poland (alongside Warsaw, Kraków, Poznań, Toruń and Lwów). Białystok native and future President of Poland in exile Ryszard Kaczorowski was a member of the local Polish resistance and was arrested in the city by the NKVD in 1940. Initially the Soviets sentenced him to death, but eventually he was sentenced to 10 years in forced labor camps and deported to Kolyma, from where he was released in 1942, when he joined the Anders&#x27; Army.

In the course of the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, Białystok was occupied by the German Army on 27 June 1941, during the Battle of Białystok–Minsk, and the city became the capital of Bezirk Białystok, a separate region in German occupied Poland, until 1944. The Great Synagogue was burnt down by Germans on 27 June 1941, with an estimated number of 2,000 Jews inside. From the very beginning, the Nazis pursued a ruthless policy of pillage and removal of the non-German population. The Germans operated a Nazi prison in the city, and a forced labour camp for Jewish men. Since 1943, the &quot;Sicherheitspolizei&quot; carried out deportations of Poles including teenage boys from the local prison to the Stutthof concentration camp. The 56,000 Jewish residents of the town were confined in a ghetto. On 15 August 1943, the Białystok Ghetto Uprising began, and several hundred Polish Jews and members of the Anti-Fascist Military Organisation () started an armed struggle against the German troops who were carrying out the planned liquidation of the ghetto with deportations to the Treblinka extermination camp. Ultimately the ghetto was liquidated, and the vast majority of its remaining 40,000 occupants including men, woman and children, were murdered by the Nazis and their collaborators, primarily at the Treblinka death camp.

The city fell under the control of the Red Army on 27 July 1944. The Soviets carried out mass arrests of Polish resistance members in the city and region, and imprisoned them in Białystok. On 20 September 1944 the city was transferred back to Poland, although with a Soviet-installed communist regime, which stayed in power until the Fall of Communism in the 1980s, and the Soviet NKVD and SMERSH continued the persecution of the Polish resistance in the following months. From November 1944 to January 1945, the Russians deported nearly 5,000 Poles from the local prison to the Soviet Union. Later on, the Soviet-appointed communists held political prisoners and other members of the Polish resistance in the local prison, and until 1956, they also carried out burials of executed Polish resistance members there.

===Post-war period===
After the war, the city became capital of the initial Białystok Voivodeship of the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland. After the 1975 administrative reform, the city was the capital of the now smaller Białystok Voivodeship. Since 1999 it has been the capital of the Podlaskie Voivodeship, Republic of Poland. 

From the European Regional Development Fund, contracted within the framework of the Integrated Regional Development Operational Programme (ZPORR), Białystok received approximately PLN 43 million for a project to improve the quality of the transport system. The implementation of Part I of the project allowed for the purchase of 43 new buses for public transport in 2005-2006, and new streets were built in Bacieczki district. The Białystok Waterworks implemented a project to improve water quality. Cycle paths in Białystok were expanded and a path to Supraśl was built.

==Geography==
Białystok is situated in the Białystok Uplands () of the Podlaskie Plain (), part of what is known collectively as the &quot;Green Lungs of Poland&quot;. It is situated by road northeast of Warsaw. It is the biggest Polish city close to Belarus and Lithuania. The Biała River, a left tributary of the Supraśl River, passes through the city. The landscape of the Białystok Upland is diverse, with high moraine hills and kame in excess of above sea level. Vast areas of outwash, a glacial plain formed of sediments deposited by meltwater at the terminus of a glacier, are covered by forests.

The highest point of the city lies at a height of on the Pietrasze Forest. The lowest point lies at a height of on the river valley of the Biała. A characteristic element of the relief of the city area are clear depressions in the surface of the moraine plateau, which are used by the rivers Biała, Horodnianka, and Czaplinianka.

Forests are an important part of the city character, they currently occupy approximately (18% of the administrative area of the city) which places it as the fifth most &quot;wooded&quot; city in Poland; behind Katowice (38%), Bydgoszcz (30%), Toruń (22.9%) and Gdańsk (17.6%).

There are a total of 9 parks in the city (on municipal plots), of which 5 are historic parks with a total area of about 59.06 ha, entered into the municipal register of monuments, and 4 are city parks with an area of about 21.68 ha.

Part of Knyszyn Forest is preserved within the city limits by two nature reserves—a total area of . The Zwierzyniecki Forest Nature Reserve, which is contained within the city limits, is a fragment, , of the riparian forest with a dominant assemblage of oak and hornbeam. The Antoniuk Nature Reserve () is a park in the city that preserves the natural state of a forest fragment characteristic of the Białystok Upland, with a dominant mixed forest of hazel and spruce.

The of forests lying in the vicinity of the Dojlidy Ponds] are administered by the Białystok Central Sports and Recreation Center ( – BOSiR). The Dojlidy Ponds recreation area includes a public beach, walking trails, birdwatching and fishing.

===Climate===
The city has a warm-summer humid continental or hemiboreal climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;) according to the Köppen climate classification system under the isotherm for the average temperature of the coldest month, or an oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) if the isotherm is used. The city would have been classified as being in the &quot;Dfb&quot; zone regardless of the accepted isotherm for climatological normals as recent as 1981–2010, but as a consequence of climate change, the winters have warmed up so that the climate in the city may be classified as oceanic. Białystok is one of the coldest cities in Poland by annual temperature and one with the climate having the most continental characteristics, as is the case for much of north-eastern Poland, with the mean yearly temperature of and the length of the growing season amounting to 205 days, shorter than elsewhere in Poland.

While winters are rather mild compared to other cities on the similar latitude, such as Samara, Barnaul, or Edmonton, they are colder than in Western Europe (in cities like Bremen and Dublin). Winters usually have little sunshine, with weather patterns changing from those influenced by the low-pressure systems generated by the Icelandic Low (when the weather is often cloudy, cool, damp, rainy and/or snowy) to the occasional intrusions of cold air masses from Siberia or the Arctic (Siberian High), which, due to the city&#x27;s northeasterly location, are more frequent than in other parts of Poland. Winters thus tend to be several degrees colder than elsewhere in Poland. Freezing conditions below are possible in winter but are rare. Snow cover is present on the ground for more than half of winter. Summers tend to be warm, sunny and pleasant and are occasionally hot, but they are still a little cooler than in most of Poland. More rain falls in summer months than in any other period of the year.

The centre of Białystok, as most urban areas, experiences the urban heat island effect, therefore for most of the time, the city is warmer than the surrounding countryside. The temperatures in the city centre are, on average, higher than in the surrounding villages, with greater differences at night and during the warmer half of the year, particularly in spring.



===Urban layout===

Białystok is roughly circular, centered around the Central market square and Branicki Palace. The decisive influence on the development of the city was exerted by natural and human factors - the course of roads, the Biała and its tributaries and the layout of railway lines. The choice of land for the construction of the factory was also determined by the price of the plot. The layout of the city, in accordance with the 18th century palace and park layout, emphasizing the magnificence of the residence, hindered the development of the city in width. Two railway lines: Białystok-Suwałki and Białystok-Słonim, separated its northern and eastern parts from the rest of the city: Dziesięciny, Wygoda, Zacisze, Pieczurki. Originally, the city&#x27;s territory was about 50 hectares. In its early days Białystok was located at the intersection of two local roads and had two most important monuments: a church (with the current brick church from 1626) with an accompanying market square and a Gothic castle owned by the noble Wiesiołowski family, the former owners of the town. The project which was aimed at rebuilding the layout of the city was initiated by Stefan Mikołaj Branicki at the end of the 17th and early 18th centuries. He established a new market () (part of the western side of Kosciuszki Square with the town hall, located on the western side of Sienkiewicza Street). The route leading towards Suraż was moved to a new location (today&#x27;s Suraska Street) forming straight road section ending in the southern corner of the market square and creating a new viewing corridor. This design decision made it possible to erect new buildings so that the old part of the settlement and the Jewish quarter were no longer visible. The second viewing corridor was created by shifting the existing route leading towards Choroszcz to the northern corner of the market square.

The communication system serving the entire city was made of streets radiating out from the central market square. An inventory plan made by Becker in 1799 was needed by the Prussian authorities in connection with the negotiations on the acquisition of Białystok for a royal residence. The plan is of fundamental importance as it shows the development of the city in the first period of its creation. The area of the city did not exceed 1.5 km2, and the population was approx. 3.5 thousand. The entire urban area was closed with 6 loose-fitting gates and buildings situated on regular plots. Compact buildings were found only in the market square, the frontages of which were 1- 2-storey buildings with brick front elevations. Choroska and Zamkowa Streets were built up with only brick houses. The city was dominated by the palace complex, which, together with the park, covered a substantial area. The residence palace was designed on a European scale and created new development opportunities for Białystok. Following the handover of the city from the Prussian Kingdom to the Russian Empire in the early 19th century, the city began growing in a very fast pace as a result of intensive industrialization, losing its original Baroque composition.

After the First World War, the first attempts were made to organize the city, which had so far developed without plans - between the palace grounds and arable land. At the request of the Association of Polish Cities, in the years 1938-1939 a general urban concept of the city was created by Ignacy Tłoczek. The plan called for the creation of new communication routes, relieve the center, demolish the Chanajki district, create a housing estate and connect with it the unique green areas around the city with new tree plantings. The Second World War prevented the comprehensive implementation of this plan. In addition, in 1919 the city&#x27;s territory was significantly expanded, incorporating the surrounding villages with plans of expanding the city.

The average height of buildings in the city is not high. The center is dominated by buildings not exceeding 25 meters in height, and the outskirts of the city are mainly occupied by low-rise single-family houses. Taller buildings dominate in some residential districts such as the districts of Piasta I and II (located to the south of the city center), Dziesięciny I and II estates (located to the northwest of the city center) as well as Wysoki Stoczek and Słoneczny Stok. Dominants in Białystok are located mainly in the center and they are also there located two most important city icons: the St. Roch&#x27;s Church and the Białystok Cathedral, which are on one axis. Each of the districts also has its dominant, which is usually a church or an Orthodox church. The most important space in the city is Kościuszko Square - the main square in the shape of a triangle. The space is delimited by two axes, one is part of the axis connecting the two largest churches, and the other runs towards the west of the Center district along Suraska Street and ends at Młynowa Street. An important spatial arrangement in Białystok is the Branicki Palace complex. The Baroque layout of the palace complex is symmetrically shaped according to one compositional axis with a coherent garden layout.

Throughout the years it expanded to include nearby villages: In the mid-eighteenth century Bojary which was located on the right bank of the Biala River was incorporated to it. On 10 May 1919, in accordance with the decision of the Sejm, Bialostoczek, Horodniany, Zwierzyniec-Letnisko, Starosielce, Słoboda (which was founded at the end of the 17th century, between the current Pogodna and Świerkowa Streets), Ogrodniki, Pieczurki, Wysoki Stoczek were incorporated also, as well as two mill villages Marczuk and Antoniuk. By the onset of World War II the city&#x27;s territory amounted to 40 km2. The reconstruction of the city following the end of World War II and establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland saw further expansion: the villages Bacieczki, Bacieczki Kolonia, Korycin and part of the village Klepacze, Krupniki, Fasty, Zaścianki and Zawady were incorporated into the city. The 70s saw another wave of expansion with the villages of Bagnówka, area of Zakłady Silikatowe, areas of state forests, Dojlidy Ponds and the orthodox cemetery at Dojlidy. At the onset of the millennium, in 2002, the village Zawady was included in the city&#x27;s limits and at the last enlargement, in 2006, the villages Dojlidy Górne, Zagórki and Kolonia Halickie were incorporated and the city reached its current territory of 102 km2.

==Districts==
The city of Białystok is divided into 29 administrative units, known in Polish as &quot;osiedla&quot;. The first 27 of these were created on 25 October 2004. The 28th, Dojlidy Górne, was created by on 23 October 2006, out of three settlements which had been incorporated into the city: Dojlidy Górne, Kolonia Halickie, and Zagórki. A new district called Bagnówka was created at the beginning of 2021.

The center of the city, Osiedle Centrum, surrounds Lipowa Street, the main street of the city. Lipowa Street extends from Rynek Kościuszki (the corner of Spółdzielcza Street) to Plac Niepodległości im. Romana Dmowskiego (the corner of Krakowska Street). Over the centuries the name of this street has taken on a number of different names; Choroska, Nowolipie, Lipowa, Józef Piłsudski, Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin, once again, to return, after the end of World War II, to its original name – Lipowa Street.

The city covers of which is agricultural land, is urbanized areas, is surface waters and is wasteland. The composition of the districts vary from residential near the city center, with a combination of multi-story apartment buildings and individual houses on small parcels, to industrial and agricultural at the city edges.

==Metropolitan Białystok==

Metropolitan Białystok was designated by the Voivodeship of the Regulation No. 52/05 of 16 May 2005 to help develop the region economically. In 2006, the metropolitan area population was 450,254 inhabitants. The municipalities adjacent to Białystok are slowly losing their agricultural character, becoming residential suburban neighborhoods with single-family housing and small businesses.

==Demographics==
In June 2020, the population of the city was 296,958. Among the cities of Poland, Białystok is second in terms of population density, tenth in population, and thirteenth in area. 
Historically, Białystok has been a destination for internal and foreign immigration, especially from Central and Eastern Europe. In addition to the Polish minority, there was formerly a Jewish majority in Białystok. The Jewish share in the population of Białystok grew from 22.4% (761) in 1765 to 66.6% (6,000) in 1808 and 76% (47,783) in 1895. According to the Russian census of 1897, out of the total population of 66,000, Jews constituted 41,900 (around 63% percent). According to the German census of 1916, Jews comprised about 72% of the inhabitants (no less than 40,000). The demographic situation changed due to the influx of Polish repatriants, intelligentsia and civil servants, and the enlargement of the city after the World War I. According to the 1931 census, the population of Białystok totalled 91,101: 45.5% (41,493) Roman Catholics, 43% (39,165) Jews (by religion), and 8.2% (7,502) Eastern Orthodox believers.

In 1936, Białystok had a population of 99,722, of whom: 50.9% (50,758) were Poles, 42.6% (42,482) Jews, 2.1% (2,094) Germans and 0.4% (359) Russians; 46.6% (45,474) adhered to the Catholic religion, 43% (42,880) to Judaism, 8.2% (8,177) to Eastern Orthodoxy and 2.9% (2,892) to Evangelicalism. World War II changed all of this: in 1939, around 107,000 people lived in Białystok, but by 1946, the population had dropped to 56,759, with much less ethnic diversity than it had had previously, due primarily to the murder of its large Jewish population. Currently the city&#x27;s population is 97% Polish, 2.5% Belarusian and 0.5% of a number of minorities including Russians, Lithuanians, and Ukrainians. Most of the modern-day population growth is based on internal migration within Poland and urbanization of surrounding areas.

These include Ryszard Kaczorowski, last émigré President of the Republic of Poland, L. L. Zamenhof, the creator of Esperanto, Albert Sabin, co-developer of the polio vaccine, Izabella Scorupco, actress, Max Weber, painter. Tomasz Bagiński illustrator, animator and director Oscar nominee in 2002 for &quot;The Cathedral&quot;. Leo Melamed pioneered creation of the International Monetary Market and financial futures.

<doc id="47785" wikidata="Q1198580" url="?curid=47785" title="Dr. Mario">
<text>is a 1990 puzzle video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy. It was produced by Gunpei Yokoi and designed by Takahiro Harada. The soundtrack was composed by Hirokazu Tanaka.

It is a falling block puzzle game, in which the player&#x27;s objective is to destroy the viruses populating the on-screen playing field by using colored vitamin capsules that are automatically tossed into the field by Dr. Mario. The player manipulates the falling capsules, to align the same colors, which destroys viruses. The player progresses through the game by eliminating all the viruses on the screen in each level.

&quot;Dr. Mario&quot; was a commercial success, with more than copies sold worldwide across all platforms. It received generally positive reviews, appearing on several lists of &quot;Best Nintendo Games of All Time&quot;. It has been ported, remade, or had a sequel on every Nintendo home console since the NES, and on most portable consoles, including a re-release in 2004 on the Game Boy Advance in the &quot;Classic NES Series&quot;. It was modified into minigames in &quot;WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgames!&quot;, &quot;Brain Age 2: More Training in Minutes a Day!&quot;, and &quot;Brain Age: Concentration Training&quot;. &quot;Dr. Luigi&quot; is a spin-off for Wii U, released on December 31, 2013, as part of the Year of Luigi celebration.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Dr. Mario&quot; is a falling block tile-matching video game. Mario assumes the role of a doctor, tossing two-colored medical capsules into a medicine bottle representing the playing field. This area is populated by viruses of three colors — red, yellow, and blue — which stay in their starting positions until removed. In a style similar to &quot;Tetris&quot;, the player manipulates each capsule as it vertically falls, able to move it left or right and rotate it 90 degrees clockwise or counter-clockwise. When matching colors of capsule halves and viruses touch sequentially 4-in-a-row, they disappear. Any remaining half or whole capsules which are not supported will fall to the bottom of the playing field or until hitting another supported object, and any new 4-in-a-row alignments also disappear. The main objective is to eliminate all viruses from the playing field, finishing each level. A game over occurs if capsules fill the playing field in a way that obstructs the bottle&#x27;s narrow neck. After each 5th level is completed on Medium or High difficulty, up to level 20, a cutscene shows the virus trio sitting on a tree as music plays and an object flies across the screen.

The options screen configures the starting level, game speed, and music. The player chooses a starting level between 0 and 20 that determines the number of viruses to clear, and one of three speeds of the falling capsules. The player&#x27;s score is based on the elimination of viruses and the chosen game speed, with bonus points for clearing more than 1 in a single line. &quot;Dr. Mario&quot; offers a multiplayer gaming mode in which two players compete in separate playing fields. Each player&#x27;s goal is to clear the private playing field of viruses first. Eliminating multiple viruses or initiating chain reactions can add capsules to the opponent&#x27;s playing field. A player wins a single game upon eliminating all the viruses or upon the other player&#x27;s bottle filling. The first player to win three games wins overall.

==Development==

&quot;Dr. Mario&quot; was produced by Gunpei Yokoi, creator of the Game Boy and Game &amp; Watch handheld systems. Takahiro Harada, producer of the &quot;Metroid&quot; series, was its designer. Its music was composed by Hirokazu Tanaka, and has been re-used and arranged such as in the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series.

===Re-releases===
&quot;Dr. Mario&quot; spawned several remakes and ports that were released on various Nintendo consoles. The original version&#x27;s multiplayer portion was ported to two Nintendo arcade systems: the Nintendo VS. System (as &quot;Vs. Dr. Mario&quot;) and the PlayChoice-10. &quot;Vs. Dr. Mario&quot; was first shown at Nintendo&#x27;s Seventh Annual Distributor Meeting in San Diego, and both versions were released simultaneously in August 1990. An enhanced remake of &quot;Dr. Mario&quot; was paired with &quot;Tetris&quot; in the Super Nintendo Entertainment System compilation game &quot;Tetris &amp; Dr. Mario&quot;, released on 30 December 1994. This was re-released in Japan on 30 March 1997, as a downloadable game for the Super Famicom&#x27;s Satellaview peripheral, with the name &quot;Dr. Mario BS Version.&quot; It was re-released again in Japan for the Super Famicom&#x27;s and Game Boy&#x27;s downloadable Nintendo Power cartridges.

The NES version was ported twice to the Game Boy Advance: first in 2004 as one of thirty games in the &quot;Classic NES Series&quot; (&quot;Famicom Mini Series&quot; in Japan), then bundled with a version of the &quot;Puzzle League&quot; series in 2005 as &quot;Dr. Mario &amp; Puzzle League&quot;, with updated graphics and new music. &quot;Nintendo Puzzle Collection&quot; and the &quot;Nintendo GameCube Preview Disc&quot;, both released in 2003 for the GameCube, can copy the NES version of &quot;Dr. Mario&quot; to the Game Boy Advance using the Nintendo GameCube – Game Boy Advance link cable. The NES version was released on the Wii U Virtual Console in 2014 and was one of the launch games for Nintendo Switch Online on September 19, 2018. The original Game Boy version was re-released on the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console in 2011 and 2012, and on the Nintendo Switch Online service on March 12, 2024.

==Reception==
&quot;Dr. Mario&quot; received generally positive reviews, although some parents were critical of the premise of medicine in a children&#x27;s game. The Game Boy version received positive reviews from &quot;Joystick&quot; and &quot;Zero&quot; magazines, the latter comparing it favorably with &quot;Tetris&quot; and Connect Four while stating it is &quot;easy to play and impossible to master&quot;. &quot;ACE&quot; criticized the uninspiring graphics, repetitive play, and &quot;plagiarism&quot; while comparing it unfavorably with &quot;Tetris&quot; and Connect Four.

&quot;GamePro&quot; reviewed the &quot;Tetris &amp; Dr. Mario&quot; compilation very positively. They praised the Mixed Match mode and the SNES enhanced graphics and sounds, and concluded &quot;Sharp controls and absorbing action are what make these two classics even better as a pair than they were alone.&quot; &quot;Next Generation&quot;, in contrast, said the compilation was only significant as the SNES debut of &quot;Tetris&quot;, summarizing that &quot;Yeah, it&#x27;s great, but chances are you own a copy of one or both of these games already.&quot; They did, however, praise Nintendo for having the &quot;cojones&quot; to package its &quot;Tetris&quot;-inspired game with &quot;Tetris&quot;.

In Japan, copies were sold for the Game Boy, for the Famicom, and 248,045 for the Game Boy Advance, for a total of 3,858,045 cartridges sold in Japan. In North America, copies were sold within six weeks of release. Worldwide, copies were sold for the Game Boy and for the Nintendo Entertainment System, for a total of cartridges sold worldwide across all platforms.

===Retrospective reception===

&quot;Allgame&quot; praised the NES version, stating that on its release, &quot;when puzzle games were flooding the market, &quot;Dr. Mario&quot; stands out as one of the best, combining a smooth learning curve, playful graphics and memorable tunes&quot; and &quot;fundamental concepts may be simple, but the addictive gameplay becomes progressively more complex as the speed increases and additional viruses are added.&quot;

&quot;Dr. Mario&quot; was rated the 134th best game on a Nintendo system in &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;″s Top 200 Games list, the 7th best &quot;Mario&quot; game of all time on &quot;ScrewAttack&#x27;s Top 10&quot;, and the 51st best NES game of all time by &quot;IGN&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; also rated the soundtrack, composed by Hirokazu Tanaka, as seventh in its list of the top ten greatest 8-bit soundtracks. &quot;GamesRadar&quot; ranked it the 13th best NES game ever made, calling it &quot;one of the most celebrated of the [puzzle] genre&quot;. &quot;Game Informer&quot;″s Ben Reeves called it the seventh best Game Boy game. In 2019, &quot;PC Magazine&quot; included Dr. Mario on their &quot;The 10 Best Game Boy Games&quot;.

The Game Boy Advance re-release in the &quot;Classic NES series&quot; is rated 66/100 on Metacritic based on 10 reviews. Most reviews pointed out the game&#x27;s addictiveness and praise the addition of wireless multiplayer, but some questioned the relevance of the standalone re-release. &quot;Eurogamer&quot; said the game was &quot;still as playable, addictive, and maddening as it was back in 1990&quot; but criticized Nintendo for re-releasing classic games as standalone games in the &quot;Classic NES Series&quot; instead of as a compilation, like Atari&#x27;s &quot;Atari Anthology&quot; or Midway&#x27;s &quot;Midway Arcade Treasures&quot;.

Craig Harris of &quot;IGN&quot; sarcastically expressed unease over the game&#x27;s use of medicine. He enjoyed the addictive gameplay, but criticized the black-and-white manual which made it difficult to understand the colored gameplay mechanics. &quot;1UP.com&quot; noted that the game&#x27;s &quot;color-matching action is more engrossing than &quot;Mario Bros.&quot;&#x27; turtle-punching platform hopping&quot;, but strongly questioned whether this re-release is worth its sale price by itself when a version of &quot;Dr. Mario&quot; was included in another Game Boy Advance game, &quot;WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgames!&quot;.

Henk Rogers of the Tetris Company spoke negatively about the game in an interview published in 2018, saying he &quot;was pissed off about that game, &quot;Dr. Mario&quot; was a blatant attempt to come up with a &quot;Tetris&quot; replacement and I thought they did it in a cheesy way.&quot;

===Legacy===

After the commercial success of &quot;Dr. Mario&quot;, Nintendo released several follow-up games. &quot;Dr. Mario 64&quot;, released in 2001 for the Nintendo 64, features Wario and several &quot;Wario Land 3&quot; characters, and offers numerous game modes, including a story-focused single-player mode. The game supports simultaneous multiplayer for up to four players. &quot;Dr. Mario 64&quot; was subsequently released in Japan in &quot;Nintendo Puzzle Collection&quot; for the GameCube. &quot;Dr. Mario Online Rx&quot;, released in 2008 on WiiWare, offers online multiplayer via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. &quot;Dr. Mario Express&quot;, released in 2009 for the Nintendo DSi, does not support multiplayer gameplay. &quot;Dr. Luigi&quot; was released in 2013 with Luigi as a playable character, all the modes in &quot;Dr. Mario Online Rx&quot;, and a new mode with L-shaped capsules. The latest installment, &quot;Dr. Mario: Miracle Cure&quot;, was released in 2015 and introduced power-ups to the series. &quot;Dr. Mario World&quot; is a mobile game. Various games in the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series have remixed musical tracks from &quot;Dr. Mario&quot;, or Dr. Mario as an unlockable playable character. &quot;Dr. Wario&quot; replaces Mario with Wario, as an unlockable minigame in &quot;WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgames!&quot;. A simplified version of &quot;Dr. Mario&quot; is in &quot;Brain Age 2: More Training in Minutes a Day!&quot; as the &quot;Virus Buster&quot; minigame, using the touch screen to drag the capsules around the playing field. The viruses are enemies in &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga&quot; and &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi: Dream Team&quot;. They change colors when attacked, and are all defeated when they are all the same color. In 2018 the Classic Tetris World Championship featured a Dr. Mario championship as a &#x27;side event.&#x27;

<text>Environmental finance is a field within finance that employs market-based environmental policy instruments to improve the ecological impact of investment strategies. The primary objective of environmental finance is to regress the negative impacts of climate change through pricing and trading schemes. The field of environmental finance was established in response to the poor management of economic crises by governmental bodies globally. Environmental finance aims to reallocate business resources to improve the sustainability of investments whilst also retaining profit margins.

==History==

In 1992, Richard L. Sandor proposed a new course outlining emission markets at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, that would later be known as the course, &quot;Environmental Finance&quot;. Sandor anticipated a social shift in perspectives on the effects of global warming and wanted to be on the frontier of new research.

Prior to this in 1990, Sandor had been involved with the passing of the Clean Air Act Amendment for the Chicago Board of Trade, which aimed to reduce high sulfur dioxide levels following WW2. Inspired by the theory of social cost, Sandor focused on cap-and-trade strategies such as emission trading schemes and more flexible mechanisms including taxes and subsidies to manage environmental crisis. The implementation of cap-and-trade mechanisms was a contributing factor to the success of the Clean Air Act Amendment.

Following the Clean Air Act in 1990, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development approached the Chicago Board of Trade in 1991, to enquire about how the market-based instruments used to combat high atmospheric sulfur dioxide concentrations could be applied to the increasing levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Sandor created a framework consisting of four characteristics which could be used to describe the carbon market:

* Standardisation 
* Unit Trading
* Price Basis
* Delivery

In 1997 the Kyoto Protocol was enacted and later enforced in 2005 by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Included nations agreed to focus on reducing global greenhouse gas emissions through the market-based mechanism of emissions trading. Reductions averaged approximately 5% by 2012 which equates to almost 30% in reduction of total emissions. Some nations made significant progress under the Kyoto protocol, however as it only became law in 2005, nations such as the United States and China reported increased emissions, substantially offsetting progress made by other regions.

In 1999, the Dow Jones Sustainability Index was introduced to evaluate the ecological and social impact of stocks so shareholders could invest more sustainably. The index acts as an incentive for firms to improve their environmental footprint to attract more shareholders.

Later in 2000, the United Nations introduced the Millennium Development Goal scheme which sought to promote a sustainable framework for large multinational corporations and countries to follow to improve the environmental impact of financial investments. This framework facilitated the development of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal scheme in 2015, which aimed to increase funding environmentally responsible investments in developing nations. Funding was targeted to improve areas such as primary education, gender equality, maternal health, and nutrition, with the overall goal of creating beneficial national relationships to decrease the ecological footprint of developing economies&quot;.&quot; Implementation of these frameworks has promoted greater participation and accountability of corporate environmental sustainability, with over 230 of the largest global firms reporting their sustainability metrics to the United Nations.

The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) has had a detailed history in providing infrastructure to improve the environmental effects of financial investments. In 2004, the institute provided training on responsible environmental credit budgeting and management for Eastern European nations. Following the Global Financial Crisis beginning in 2007, the UNEP provided substantial support for future sustainable investment choices for economies such as Greece which were impacted severely. The Portfolio Decarbonisation Coalition established in 2014 is a significantly notable initiative in the history of environmental finance as it aims to establish an economy that is not dependent on investments with large carbon footprints. This goal is achieved through large-scale stakeholder reinvestment and securing long-term, responsible, investment commitments. Most recently, the UNEP has recommended OECD nations to align investment strategies alongside the objectives of the Paris Agreement, to improve long-term investments with significant ecological effects.

In 2008 the Climate Change Act enacted by the UK Government established a framework to limit greenhouse gasses and carbon emissions through a budgeting scheme, which motivated firms and businesses to reduce their carbon output for a financial reward. Specifically, by 2050 it seeks to reduce carbon emissions by 80% compared to levels in 1980. The Act seeks to achieve this goal by reviewing carbon budgeting schemes such emission trading credits, every 5 years to continually reassess and recalibrate relevant policies. The cost of reaching the 2050 goal has been estimated at approximately 1.5% of GDP, although the positive environmental impact of reducing carbon footprint and increased in investment into the renewable energy sector will offset this cost. A further implicated cost in the pursuit of the Act is a predicted £100 increase in annual household energy costs, however this price increase is set to be outweighed by an improved energy efficiency which will decrease fuel costs.    

The 2010 cap and trade scheme introduced in the metropolitan regions of Tokyo was mandatory for businesses heavily dependent on fuel and electricity, who accounted for almost 20% of total carbon emissions in the area.  The scheme aimed to reduce emissions by 17% by the end of 2019.  

In 2011 the Clean Energy Act was enacted by the Australian Government. The act introduced the Carbon Tax which aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emission by charging large firms for their carbon tonnage. The Clean Energy Act facilitated the transition to an emissions trading scheme in 2014&quot;.&quot; The scheme also aims to fulfill the Australian Government&#x27;s obligations in respect to the Kyoto Protocol and the Climate Change Convention. Additionally, the Act seeks to reduce emissions in a manner that will foster economic growth through increased market competition and investment into renewable energy sources. The Australian National Registry of Emissions Units regulates and monitors the use of emission credits utilised by the Act. Firms must enroll in the registry to buy and sell credits to compensate for their relevant reduction or over-consumption of carbon emissions.

The Republic of Korea&#x27;s 2015 emission trading scheme aims to reduce carbon emissions by 37% by 2030. It strives to achieve this through allocating a quota of carbon emission to the largest carbon emitting businesses, resetting at the beginning of the schemes 3 separate phases.

In 2017 the National Mitigation Plan was passed by the Irish Government which aimed to regress climate change by decreasing emission levels through revised investment strategies and frameworks for power generation, agriculture, and transport The plan involves 106 separate guidelines for short and long term climate change mitigation.

The European Union Emission Trading Scheme concluding at the end of 2020 is the longest single global carbon pricing scheme, which has been improved over its three 5-year phases. Current improvements include a centralised emission credit trading system, auctioning of credits, addressing a broader range of green house gasses and the introduction of a European-wide credit cap instead of national caps.

== Strategies ==

Societal shifts from fossil fuels to renewable energy caused by an increased awareness of climate change has made government bodies and firms re-evaluate investment strategies to avoid irreparable ecological damage. Shifts away from fossil fuels also increase demand into alternate energy sources which requires revised investment strategies.

The initial stage to mitigate climate change through financial tools involves ecological and economic forecasting to model future impacts of current investment methodologies on the environment. This allows for an approximate estimation of future environments; however, the impacts of continued harmful business trends need to be observed under a non-linear perspective.

Cap-and-trade mechanisms limit the total amount of emissions a particular region or country can emit. Firms are issued with tradeable permits which they can buy or sell. This acts as a financial incentive to reduce emissions and as a disincentive to exceed emission caps.

In 2005, the European Union Emission Trading Scheme was established and is now the largest emission trading scheme globally.

In 2013, the Québec Cap-and-trade scheme was established and is currently the primary mitigation strategy for the area.

Direct foreign investment into developing nations provide more efficient and sustainable energy sources.

In 2006, the Clean Development Mechanism was formed under the Kyoto Protocol, providing solar power and new technologies to developing nations. Countries who invest into developing nations can receive emission reduction credits as a reward.  

Removal of atmospheric carbon dioxide has been proposed as a solution to mitigate climate change, by increasing tree densities to absorb carbon dioxide. Other methods involve new technologies which are still in research development stages.

Research in environmental finance has sought how to strategically invest in clean technologies. When paired with international legislation, such as the case of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, environmentally based investments have stimulated emerging industries and reduced the consequences of climate change. The international collaboration would ultimately lead to the changes that repaired the hole in the ozone layer.

== Impact ==

The European Union Emission Trading Scheme from 2008-2012 was responsible for a 7% reduction in emissions for the states within the scheme. In 2013, allowances were reviewed to accommodate for new emission reduction targets. The new annual recommended target was a reduction of 1.72%. It is estimated that reducing the amount of quoted credits was restricted more tightly, emissions could have been reduced by a total of 25%. Nations such as Romania, Poland and Sweden experienced significant revenue, benefiting from selling credits.  Despite successfully reducing emissions, the European Union Emission Trading Scheme has been critiqued for its lack of flexibility to accommodate to major shifts in the economic landscape and reassess currents contexts to provide a revised cap on trading credits, potentially undermining the original objective of the scheme.

The New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme of 2008 was modelled to increase annual household energy expenditure to 0.8% and increase fuel prices by approximately 6%. The price of agricultural products such as beef and dairy were modelled to decrease by almost 1%. Price increases in carbon intensive sectors such as foresting and mining were also expected, incentivising a shift towards renewable energy system and improved investment strategies with a less harmful environmental impact.

In 2016, the Québec Cap-and-trade scheme was responsible for an 11% reduction in emissions compared to 1990 emission levels&quot;.&quot; Due to the associated increased energy costs, fuel prices rose 2-3 cents per litre over the duration of the cap and trade scheme.

In 2014, the Clean Development Mechanism was responsible for a 1% reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions.  The Clean Development Mechanism has been responsible for removing 7 billion tons of greenhouse gasses from the atmosphere through the efforts of almost 8000 individual projects. Despite this success, as the economies of developing nations participating in Clean Development Mechanisms improves, the financial payout to the country supplying such infrastructure increases at a greater rate than economic growth, thus leading to an unoptimised and counterproductive system.

<text>Quality of life (QOL) is defined by the World Health Organization as &quot;an individual&#x27;s perception of their position in life in the context of the culture and value systems in which they live and in relation to their goals, expectations, standards and concerns&quot;. 

Standard indicators of the quality of life include wealth, employment, the environment, physical and mental health, education, recreation and leisure time, social belonging, religious beliefs, safety, security and freedom. QOL has a wide range of contexts, including the fields of international development, healthcare, politics and employment. Health related QOL (HRQOL) is an evaluation of QOL and its relationship with health.

== Engaged theory ==
One approach, called the engaged theory, outlined in the journal of &quot;Applied Research in the Quality of Life&quot;, posits four domains in assessing quality of life: ecology, economics, politics and culture. In the domain of culture, for example, it includes the following subdomains of quality of life:
* Beliefs and ideas
* Creativity and recreation
* Enquiry and learning
* Gender and generations
* Identity and engagement
* Memory and projection
* Well-being and health

Under this conception, other frequently related concepts include freedom, human rights, and happiness. However, since happiness is subjective and difficult to measure, other measures are generally given priority. It has also been shown that happiness, as much as it can be measured, does not necessarily increase correspondingly with the comfort that results from increasing income. As a result, standard of living should not be taken to be a measure of happiness. Also, sometimes considered related is the concept of human security, though the latter may be considered at a more basic level and for all people.

==Quantitative measurement==
Unlike &quot;per capita&quot; GDP or standard of living, both of which can be measured in financial terms, it is harder to make objective or long-term measurements of the quality of life experienced by nations or other groups of people. Researchers have begun in recent times to distinguish two aspects of personal well-being: &quot;Emotional well-being&quot;, in which respondents are asked about the quality of their everyday emotional experiencesthe frequency and intensity of their experiences of, for example, joy, stress, sadness, anger and affectionand &quot;life evaluation&quot;, in which respondents are asked to think about their life in general and evaluate it against a scale. Such and other systems and scales of measurement have been in use for some time. Research has attempted to examine the relationship between quality of life and productivity. 

There are many different methods of measuring quality of life in terms of health care, wealth, and materialistic goods. However, it is much more difficult to measure meaningful expression of one&#x27;s desires. One way to do so is to evaluate the scope of how individuals have fulfilled their own ideals. Quality of life can simply mean happiness, which is the subjective state of mind. By using that mentality, citizens of a developing country appreciate more since they are content with the basic necessities of health care, education and child protection.

According to ecological economist Robert Costanza:

===Human Development Index===

Perhaps the most commonly used international measure of development is the Human Development Index (HDI), which combines measures of life expectancy, education, and standard of living, in an attempt to quantify the options available to individuals within a given society. The HDI is used by the United Nations Development Programme in their Human Development Report. However, since 2010, The Human Development Report introduced an Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI). While the original HDI remains useful, it stated that &quot;the IHDI is the actual level of human development (accounting for inequality), while the original HDI can be viewed as an index of &#x27;potential&#x27; human development (or the maximum level of HDI) that could be achieved if there was no inequality.&quot;

===World Happiness Report===
The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey on the state of global happiness. It ranks 156 countries by their happiness levels, reflecting growing global interest in using happiness and substantial well-being as an indicator of the quality of human development. Its growing purpose has allowed governments, communities and organizations to use appropriate data to record happiness in order to enable policies to provide better lives. The reports review the state of happiness in the world today and show how the science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness. 

Developed again by the United Nations and published recently along with the HDI, this report combines both objective and subjective measures to rank countries by happiness, which is deemed as the ultimate outcome of a high quality of life. It uses surveys from Gallup, real GDP per capita, healthy life expectancy, having someone to count on, perceived freedom to make life choices, freedom from corruption, and generosity to derive the final score. Happiness is already recognized as an important concept in global public policy. The World Happiness Report indicates that some regions have in recent years been experiencing progressive inequality of happiness.

===Other measures===
The Physical Quality of Life Index (PQLI) is a measure developed by sociologist M. D. Morris in the 1970s, based on basic literacy, infant mortality, and life expectancy. Although not as complex as other measures, and now essentially replaced by the Human Development Index, the PQLI is notable for Morris&#x27;s attempt to show a &quot;less fatalistic pessimistic picture&quot; by focusing on three areas where global quality of life was generally improving at the time, while ignoring gross national product and other possible indicators that were not improving.

The Happy Planet Index, introduced in 2006, is unique among quality of life measures in that, in addition to standard determinants of well-being, it uses each country&#x27;s ecological footprint as an indicator. As a result, European and North American nations do not dominate this measure. The 2012 list is instead topped by Costa Rica, Vietnam and Colombia.

In 2010, Gallup researchers trying to find the world&#x27;s happiest countries found Denmark to be at the top of the list. For the period 2014–2016, Norway surpasses Denmark to be at the top of the list.

A 2010 study by two Princeton University professors looked at 1,000 randomly selected U.S. residents over an extended period. It concludes that their &quot;life evaluations&quot; – that is, their considered evaluations of their life against a stated scale of one to ten – rise steadily with income. On the other hand, their reported quality of &quot;emotional daily experiences&quot; (their reported experiences of joy, affection, stress, sadness, or anger) levels off after a certain income level (approximately $75,000 per year in 2010); income above $75,000 does not lead to more experiences of happiness nor to further relief of unhappiness or stress. Below this income level, respondents reported decreasing happiness and increasing sadness and stress, implying the pain of life&#x27;s misfortunes, including disease, divorce, and being alone, is exacerbated by poverty.

Gross national happiness and other subjective measures of happiness are being used by the governments of Bhutan and the United Kingdom. The World Happiness report, issued by Columbia University is a meta-analysis of happiness globally and provides an overview of countries and grassroots activists using GNH. The OECD issued a guide for the use of subjective well-being metrics in 2013. In the U.S., cities and communities are using a GNH metric at a grassroots level.

The Social Progress Index measures the extent to which countries provide for the social and environmental needs of their citizens. Fifty-two indicators in the areas of basic human needs, foundations of wellbeing, and opportunity show the relative performance of nations. The index uses outcome measures when there is sufficient data available or the closest possible proxies.

Day-Reconstruction Method was another way of measuring happiness, in which researchers asked their subjects to recall various things they did on the previous day and describe their mood during each activity. Being simple and approachable, this method required memory and the experiments have confirmed that the answers that people give are similar to those who repeatedly recalled each subject. The method eventually declined as it called for more effort and thoughtful responses, which often included interpretations and outcomes that do not occur to people who are asked to record every action in their daily lives.

The Digital Quality of Life Index - a yearly study on digital well-being across 121 countries created by Surfshark. It indexes each country according to five pillars that impact a population&#x27;s digital quality of life: internet affordability, internet quality, electronic infrastructure, electronic security, and electronic government.

===Livability===
The term &quot;quality of life&quot; is also used by politicians and economists to measure the livability of a given city or nation. Two widely known measures of livability are the Economist Intelligence Unit&#x27;s Where-to-be-born Index and Mercer&#x27;s Quality of Living Reports. These two measures calculate the livability of countries and cities around the world, respectively, through a combination of subjective life-satisfaction surveys and objective determinants of quality of life such as divorce rates, safety, and infrastructure. Such measures relate more broadly to the population of a city, state, or country, not to individual quality of life. Livability has a long history and tradition in urban design, and neighborhoods design standards such as LEED-ND are often used in an attempt to influence livability. 

====Crimes====
Some crimes against property (e.g., graffiti and vandalism) and some &quot;victimless crimes&quot; have been referred to as &quot;quality-of-life crimes&quot;. American sociologist James Q. Wilson encapsulated this argument as the broken windows theory, which asserts that relatively minor problems left unattended (such as litter, graffiti, or public urination by homeless individuals) send a subliminal message that disorder, in general, is being tolerated, and as a result, more serious crimes will end up being committed (the analogy being that a broken window left broken shows an image of general dilapidation).

Wilson&#x27;s theories have been used to justify the implementation of zero tolerance policies by many prominent American mayors, most notably Oscar Goodman in Las Vegas, Richard Riordan in Los Angeles, Rudolph Giuliani in New York City and Gavin Newsom in San Francisco. Such policies refuse to tolerate even minor crimes; proponents argue that this will improve the quality of life of local residents. However, critics of zero tolerance policies believe that such policies neglect investigation on a case-by-case basis and may lead to unreasonably harsh penalties for crimes.

==In healthcare==

Within the field of healthcare, quality of life is often regarded in terms of how a certain ailment affects a patient on an individual level. This may be a debilitating weakness that is not life-threatening; life-threatening illness that is not terminal; terminal illness; the predictable, natural decline in the health of an elder; an unforeseen mental/physical decline of a loved one; or chronic, end-stage disease processes. Researchers at the University of Toronto&#x27;s Quality of Life Research Unit define quality of life as &quot;The degree to which a person enjoys the important possibilities of his or her life&quot; (UofT). Their Quality of Life Model is based on the categories &quot;being&quot;, &quot;belonging&quot;, and &quot;becoming&quot;; respectively who one is, how one is connected to one&#x27;s environment, and whether one achieves one&#x27;s personal goals, hopes, and aspirations.

Experience sampling studies show substantial between-person variability in within-person associations between somatic symptoms and quality of life. Hecht and Shiel measure quality of life as &quot;the patient&#x27;s ability to enjoy normal life activities&quot; since life quality is strongly related to wellbeing without suffering from sickness and treatment.

==In international development==
Quality of life has been deemed an important concept in the field of international development because it allows development to be analyzed on a measure that is generally accepted as more comprehensive than standard of living. Within development theory, however, there are varying ideas concerning what constitutes desirable change for a particular society. The different ways that quality of life is defined by institutions, therefore, shape how these organizations work for its improvement as a whole.

Organisations such as the World Bank, for example, declare a goal of &quot;working for a world free of poverty&quot;, with poverty defined as a lack of basic human needs, such as food, water, shelter, freedom, access to education, healthcare, or employment. In other words, poverty is defined as a low quality of life. Using this definition, the World Bank works towards improving quality of life through the stated goal of lowering poverty and helping people afford a better quality of life.

Other organizations, however, may also work towards improved global quality of life using a slightly different definition and substantially different methods. Many NGOs do not focus at all on reducing poverty on a national or international scale, but rather attempt to improve the quality of life for individuals or communities. One example would be sponsorship programs that provide material aid for specific individuals. Although many organizations of this type may still talk about fighting poverty, the methods are significantly different.

Improving quality of life involves action not only by NGOs but also by governments. Global health has the potential to achieve greater political presence if governments were to incorporate aspects of human security into foreign policy. Stressing individuals&#x27; basic rights to health, food, shelter, and freedom addresses prominent inter-sectoral problems negatively impacting today&#x27;s society, and may lead to greater action and resources. Integration of global health concerns into foreign policy may be hampered by approaches that are shaped by the overarching roles of defense and diplomacy.

<text>The Mars program was a series of uncrewed spacecraft launched by the Soviet Union between 1960 and 1973. The spacecraft were intended to explore Mars, and included flyby probes, landers and orbiters.

Early Mars spacecraft were small, and launched by Molniya rockets. Starting with two failures in 1969, the heavier Proton-K rocket was used to launch larger 5 tonne spacecraft, consisting of an orbiter and a lander to Mars. The orbiter bus design was likely somewhat rushed into service and immature, considering that it performed very unreliably in the Venera variant after 1975. This reliability problem was common to much Soviet space hardware from the late 1960s and early 1970s and was largely corrected with a deliberate policy, implemented in the mid-1970s, of consolidating (or &quot;debugging&quot;) existing designs rather than introducing new ones. The names of the &quot;Mars&quot; missions do not need to be translated, as the word &quot;Mars&quot; is spelled and pronounced approximately the same way in English and Russian.

In addition to the Mars program, the Soviet Union also sent a probe to Mars as part of the Zond program; Zond 2, however it failed en route. Two more spacecraft were sent during the Phobos program; both failed. In 1996, Russia launched Mars 96, its first interplanetary mission since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, however it failed to depart Earth orbit.

==Spacecraft==

===Mars 1M===
The first Soviet attempts to send a probe to Mars were the two Mars 1M spacecraft, which each had a mass of about 650 kg. Both were launched in 1960 and failed to achieve orbit. The spacecraft were dubbed &quot;Marsnik&quot; by the Western media.

===Mars 2MV===
Mars 1 was launched in 1962 but failed en route to Mars. Two other Soviet launches at around the same time, Mars 2MV-4 No.1 and Mars 2MV-3 No.1 were spacecraft, however both failed to leave Earth orbit due to problems with the upper stages of their carrier rockets.

===Mars 2M===
Mars 2M No.521 and Mars 2M No.522, known in the West as Mars 1969A and B, were heavier spacecraft with masses of . They were launched by Proton-K rockets, and consisted of orbiters. Both were destroyed during launch.

===Mars 4M===

The Mars 4M spacecraft; Mars 2 and Mars 3 missions consisted of identical spacecraft, each with an orbiter and an attached lander, which became the first spacecraft to reach the surface of Mars.

The orbiters&#x27; primary scientific objectives were to image the Martian surface and clouds, determine the temperature on Mars, study the topography, composition and physical properties of the surface, measure properties of the atmosphere, monitor the solar wind and the interplanetary and Martian magnetic fields, and act as communications relays to send signals from the landers to Earth.

Both landers had a small Mars rover, PrOP-M, on board, which would move across the surface on skis while connected to the lander with a 15-meter umbilical. Two small metal rods were used for autonomous obstacle avoidance, as radio signals from Earth would take too long to drive the rovers using remote control. Each rover had both a densitometer and a dynamic penetrometer, to test the density and the bearing strength of the soil. Because of the demise of the landers, neither rover saw action.

The Mars 2 and 3 orbiters sent back a large volume of data covering the period from December 1971 to March 1972, although transmissions continued through August. It was announced that Mars 2 and 3 had completed their missions by August 22, 1972, after 362 orbits completed by Mars 2 and 20 orbits by Mars 3. The probes sent back a total of 60 pictures. The images and data enabled creation of surface relief maps, and gave information on the Martian gravity and magnetic fields.

===Mars 3MS===

The Mars 3MS were orbiter-only spacecraft launched three times between 1971 and 1973. The first of which,
Kosmos 419, was intended to become the first spacecraft to orbit Mars, beating NASA&#x27;s Mariner 8 and Mariner 9, however it failed to leave low Earth orbit. Two additional 3MS missions, Mars 4 and Mars 5, were launched in 1973 to act as communications relay for Mars 6 and 7.

===Mars 3MP===

In 1973 the speed required to place a spacecraft in an interplanetary trajectory had to be increased. Thus the Proton could not deliver spacecraft with an orbiter and an attached lander to the necessary trajectory to reach Mars, as had been possible in 1971. To resolve this problem, four spacecraft were launched. The Mars 4 and 5 orbiters, which had been launched separately, were used to relay communications, and to complete mission objectives which would have been completed by landers. Two landers were launched with orbiter type buses (Mars 6 and 7), but without fuel to enter orbit of the Mars satellite.

===Mars 4NM and 5NM===

The Mars 4NM and Mars 5NM projects would have seen heavier spacecraft launched by N1 rockets. They would have deployed heavy Marsokhod rovers onto the surface, and conducted sample return missions. The N1 failed on all four of its test flights, and was never used to launch any Mars spacecraft.

===Mars 5M===

Mars 5M (Mars 79) was a sample return mission developed in 1977 to be double launched in 1979 by Proton launchers and then docked in Earth orbit for a joint flight of orbital and return modules to Mars. The project was canceled due to the low reliability of the Igla automatic docking system.

<text>The Voyager program is an American scientific program that employs two interstellar probes, &quot;Voyager 1&quot; and &quot;Voyager 2&quot;. They were launched in 1977 to take advantage of a favorable planetary alignment to explore the two gas giants Jupiter and Saturn and potentially also the ice giants, Uranus and Neptune - to fly near them while collecting data for transmission back to Earth. After &quot;Voyager 1&quot; successfully completed its flyby of Saturn and its moon Titan, it was decided to send &quot;Voyager 2&quot; on flybys of Uranus and Neptune. 

After the planetary flybys were complete, decisions were made to keep the probes in operation to explore interstellar space and the outer regions of the solar system. On 25 August 2012, data from &quot;Voyager 1&quot; indicated that it had entered interstellar space. On 5 November 2019, data from &quot;Voyager 2&quot; indicated that it also had entered interstellar space. On 4 November 2019, scientists reported that on 5 November 2018, the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; probe had officially reached the interstellar medium (ISM), a region of outer space beyond the influence of the solar wind, as did &quot;Voyager 1&quot; in 2012. In August 2018, NASA confirmed, based on results by the &quot;New Horizons&quot; spacecraft, the existence of a &quot;hydrogen wall&quot; at the outer edges of the Solar System that was first detected in 1992 by the two Voyager spacecraft.

 the Voyagers are still in operation beyond the outer boundary of the heliosphere in interstellar space. &quot;Voyager 1&quot; is moving with a velocity of , or 17 km/s, (10.5 miles/second) relative to the Sun, and is from the Sun reaching a distance of from Earth as of May 25, 2024. , &quot;Voyager 2&quot; is moving with a velocity of , or 15 km/s, relative to the Sun, and is from the Sun reaching a distance of from Earth as of May 25, 2024. 

The two &quot;Voyagers&quot; are the only human-made objects to date that have passed into interstellar space — a record they will hold until at least the 2040s — and &quot;Voyager 1&quot; is the farthest human-made object from Earth.

==History==
=== Mariner Jupiter-Saturn ===

The two Voyager space probes were originally conceived as part of the Planetary Grand Tour planned during the late 1960s and early 70s that aimed to explore Jupiter, Saturn, Saturn&#x27;s moon, Titan, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. The mission originated from the Grand Tour program, conceptualized by Gary Flandro, an aerospace engineer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in 1964, which leveraged a rare planetary alignment occurring once every 175 years. This alignment allowed a craft to reach all outer planets using gravitational assists. The mission was to send several pairs of probes and gained momentum in 1966 when it was endorsed by NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. However, in December 1971, the Grand Tour mission was canceled when funding was redirected to the Space Shuttle program.

In 1972, a scaled-down (four planets, two identical spacecraft) mission was proposed, utilizing a spacecraft derived from the Mariner series, initially intended to be Mariner 11 and Mariner 12. The gravity-assist technique, successfully demonstrated by Mariner 10, would be used to achieve significant velocity changes by maneuvering through an intermediate planet&#x27;s gravitational field to minimize time towards Saturn. The spacecrafts were then moved into a separate program named Mariner Jupiter-Saturn (also Mariner Jupiter-Saturn-Uranus, MJS, or MJSU), part of the Mariner program, later renamed because it was thought that the design of the two space probes had progressed sufficiently beyond that of the Mariner family to merit a separate name.

=== Voyager probes ===
On March 4, 1977, NASA announced a competition to rename the mission, believing the existing name was not appropriate as the mission had differed significantly from previous Mariner missions. &quot;Voyager&quot; was chosen as the new name, referencing an earlier suggestion by William Pickering, who had proposed the name &quot;Navigator&quot;. Due to the name change occurring close to launch, the probes were still occasionally referred to as Mariner 11 and Mariner 12, or even Voyager 11 and Voyager 12.

Two mission trajectories were established: JST aimed at Jupiter, Saturn, and enhancing a Titan flyby, while JSX served as a contingency plan. JST focused on a Titan flyby, while JSX provided a flexible mission plan. If JST succeeded, JSX could proceed with the Grand Tour, but in case of failure, JSX could be redirected for a separate Titan flyby, forfeiting the Grand Tour opportunity. The second probe, now Voyager 2, followed the JSX trajectory, granting it the option to continue on to Uranus and Neptune. Upon Voyager 1 completing its main objectives at Saturn, Voyager 2 received a mission extension, enabling it to proceed to Uranus and Neptune. This allowed Voyager 2 to diverge from the originally planned JST trajectory.

The probes would be launched in August or September 1977, with their main objective being to compare the characteristics of Jupiter and Saturn, such as their atmospheres, magnetic fields, particle environments, ring systems, and moons. They would fly by planets and moons in either a JST or JSX trajectory. After completing their flybys, the probes would communicate with Earth, relaying vital data using their magnetometers, spectrometers, and other instruments to detect interstellar, solar, and cosmic radiation. Their radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) would limit the maximum communication time with the probes to roughly a decade. Following their primary missions, the probes would continue to drift into interstellar space.

&quot;Voyager 2&quot; was the first to be launched. Its trajectory was designed to allow flybys of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. &quot;Voyager 1&quot; was launched after &quot;Voyager 2&quot;, but along a shorter and faster trajectory that was designed to provide an optimal flyby of Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan, which was known to be quite large and to possess a dense atmosphere. This encounter sent &quot;Voyager 1&quot; out of the plane of the ecliptic, ending its planetary science mission. Had &quot;Voyager 1&quot; been unable to perform the Titan flyby, the trajectory of &quot;Voyager 2&quot; could have been altered to explore Titan, forgoing any visit to Uranus and Neptune. &quot;Voyager 1&quot; was not launched on a trajectory that would have allowed it to continue to Uranus and Neptune, but could have continued from Saturn to Pluto without exploring Titan.

During the 1990s, &quot;Voyager 1&quot; overtook the slower deep-space probes Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 to become the most distant human-made object from Earth, a record that it will keep for the foreseeable future. The &quot;New Horizons&quot; probe, which had a higher launch velocity than &quot;Voyager 1&quot;, is travelling more slowly due to the extra speed &quot;Voyager 1&quot; gained from its flybys of Jupiter and Saturn. &quot;Voyager 1&quot; and Pioneer 10 are the most widely separated human-made objects anywhere since they are travelling in roughly opposite directions from the Solar System.

In December 2004, &quot;Voyager 1&quot; crossed the termination shock, where the solar wind is slowed to subsonic speed, and entered the heliosheath, where the solar wind is compressed and made turbulent due to interactions with the interstellar medium. On 10 December 2007, &quot;Voyager 2&quot; also reached the termination shock, about closer to the Sun than from where &quot;Voyager 1&quot; first crossed it, indicating that the Solar System is asymmetrical.

In 2010 &quot;Voyager 1&quot; reported that the outward velocity of the solar wind had dropped to zero, and scientists predicted it was nearing interstellar space. In 2011, data from the Voyagers determined that the heliosheath is not smooth, but filled with giant magnetic bubbles, theorized to form when the magnetic field of the Sun becomes warped at the edge of the Solar System.

In June 2012, Scientists at NASA reported that &quot;Voyager 1&quot; was very close to entering interstellar space, indicated by a sharp rise in high-energy particles from outside the Solar System. In September 2013, NASA announced that &quot;Voyager 1&quot; had crossed the heliopause on 25 August 2012, making it the first spacecraft to enter interstellar space.

In December 2018, NASA announced that &quot;Voyager 2&quot; had crossed the heliopause on 5 November 2018, making it the second spacecraft to enter interstellar space.

 &quot;Voyager 1&quot; and &quot;Voyager 2&quot; continue to monitor conditions in the outer expanses of the Solar System. The Voyager spacecraft are expected to be able to operate science instruments through 2020, when limited power will require instruments to be deactivated one by one. Sometime around 2025, there will no longer be sufficient power to operate any science instruments.

In July 2019, a revised power management plan was implemented to better manage the two probes&#x27; dwindling power supply.

==Spacecraft design==
The Voyager spacecraft each weighed at launch, but after fuel usage are now about . Of this weight, each spacecraft carries of scientific instruments. The identical Voyager spacecraft use three-axis-stabilized guidance systems that use gyroscopic and accelerometer inputs to their attitude control computers to point their high-gain antennas towards the Earth and their scientific instruments towards their targets, sometimes with the help of a movable instrument platform for the smaller instruments and the electronic photography system.

The diagram shows the high-gain antenna (HGA) with a diameter dish attached to the hollow decagonal electronics container. There is also a spherical tank that contains the hydrazine monopropellant fuel.

The Voyager Golden Record is attached to one of the bus sides. The angled square panel to the right is the optical calibration target and excess heat radiator. The three radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) are mounted end-to-end on the lower boom.

The scan platform comprises: the Infrared Interferometer Spectrometer (IRIS) (largest camera at top right); the Ultraviolet Spectrometer (UVS) just above the IRIS; the two Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) vidicon cameras to the left of the UVS; and the Photopolarimeter System (PPS) under the ISS.

Only five investigation teams are still supported, though data is collected for two additional instruments.
The Flight Data Subsystem (FDS) and a single eight-track digital tape recorder (DTR) provide the data handling functions.

The FDS configures each instrument and controls instrument operations. It also collects engineering and science data and formats the data for transmission. The DTR is used to record high-rate Plasma Wave Subsystem (PWS) data, which is played back every six months.

The Imaging Science Subsystem made up of a wide-angle and a narrow-angle camera is a modified version of the slow scan vidicon camera designs that were used in the earlier Mariner flights. The Imaging Science Subsystem consists of two television-type cameras, each with eight filters in a commandable filter wheel mounted in front of the vidicons. One has a low resolution focal length wide-angle lens with an aperture of f/3 (the wide-angle camera), while the other uses a higher resolution narrow-angle f/8.5 lens (the narrow-angle camera).

Three spacecraft were built, &quot;Voyager 1&quot; (VGR 77-1), &quot;Voyager 2&quot; (VGR 77-3), and test spare model (VGR 77-2).

=== Scientific instruments ===


=== Computers and data processing ===
There are three different computer types on the Voyager spacecraft, two of each kind, sometimes used for redundancy. They are proprietary, custom-built computers built from CMOS and TTL medium-scale CMOS integrated circuits and discrete components, mostly from the 7400 series of Texas Instruments. Total number of words among the six computers is about 32K. Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 have identical computer systems.

The Computer Command System (CCS), the central controller of the spacecraft, has two 18-bit word, interrupt-type processors with 4096 words each of non-volatile plated-wire memory. During most of the Voyager mission the two CCS computers on each spacecraft were used non-redundantly to increase the command and processing capability of the spacecraft. The CCS is nearly identical to the system flown on the Viking spacecraft.

The Flight Data System (FDS) is two 16-bit word machines with modular memories and 8198 words each.

The Attitude and Articulation Control System (AACS) is two 18-bit word machines with 4096 words each.

Unlike the other on-board instruments, the operation of the cameras for visible light is not autonomous, but rather it is controlled by an imaging parameter table contained in one of the on-board digital computers, the Flight Data Subsystem (FDS). More recent space probes, since about 1990, usually have completely autonomous cameras.

The computer command subsystem (CCS) controls the cameras. The CCS contains fixed computer programs such as command decoding, fault detection, and correction routines, antenna-pointing routines, and spacecraft sequencing routines. This computer is an improved version of the one that was used in the &quot;Viking&quot; orbiter. The hardware in both custom-built CCS subsystems in the Voyagers is identical. There is only a minor software modification for one of them that has a scientific subsystem that the other lacks.

According to Guinness Book of Records, CCS holds record of &quot;longest period of continual operation for a computer&quot;. It has been running continuously since 20 August 1977.

The Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS) controls the spacecraft orientation (its attitude). It keeps the high-gain antenna pointing towards the Earth, controls attitude changes, and points the scan platform. The custom-built AACS systems on both craft are identical.

It has been erroneously reported on the Internet that the Voyager space probes were controlled by a version of the RCA 1802 (RCA CDP1802 &quot;COSMAC&quot; microprocessor), but such claims are not supported by the primary design documents. The CDP1802 microprocessor was used later in the &quot;Galileo&quot; space probe, which was designed and built years later. The digital control electronics of the Voyagers were not based on a microprocessor integrated-circuit chip.

===Communications===
The uplink communications are executed via S-band microwave communications. The downlink communications are carried out by an X-band microwave transmitter on board the spacecraft, with an S-band transmitter as a back-up. All long-range communications to and from the two Voyagers have been carried out using their high-gain antennas. The high-gain antenna has a beamwidth of 0.5° for X-band, and 2.3° for S-band. (The low-gain antenna has a 7 dB gain and 60° beamwidth.)

Because of the inverse-square law in radio communications, the digital data rates used in the downlinks from the Voyagers have been continually decreasing the farther that they get from the Earth. For example, the data rate used from Jupiter was about 115,000 bits per second. That was halved at the distance of Saturn, and it has gone down continually since then. Some measures were taken on the ground along the way to reduce the effects of the inverse-square law. In between 1982 and 1985, the diameters of the three main parabolic dish antennas of the Deep Space Network were increased from dramatically increasing their areas for gathering weak microwave signals.

Whilst the craft were between Saturn and Uranus the onboard software was upgraded to do a degree of image compression and to use a more efficient Reed-Solomon error-correcting encoding.

Then between 1986 and 1989, new techniques were brought into play to combine the signals from multiple antennas on the ground into one, more powerful signal, in a kind of an antenna array. This was done at Goldstone, California, Canberra (Australia), and Madrid (Spain) using the additional dish antennas available there. Also, in Australia, the Parkes Radio Telescope was brought into the array in time for the fly-by of Neptune in 1989. In the United States, the Very Large Array in New Mexico was brought into temporary use along with the antennas of the Deep Space Network at Goldstone. Using this new technology of antenna arrays helped to compensate for the immense radio distance from Neptune to the Earth.

===Power===

Electrical power is supplied by three MHW-RTG radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs). They are powered by plutonium-238 (distinct from the Pu-239 isotope used in nuclear weapons) and provided approximately 470 W at 30 volts DC when the spacecraft was launched. Plutonium-238 decays with a half-life of 87.74 years, so RTGs using Pu-238 will lose a factor of 1−0.5(1/87.74) = 0.79% of their power output per year.

In 2011, 34 years after launch, the thermal power generated by such an RTG would be reduced to (1/2)(34/87.74) ≈ 76% of its initial power. The RTG thermocouples, which convert thermal power into electricity, also degrade over time reducing available electric power below this calculated level.

By 7 October 2011 the power generated by &quot;Voyager 1&quot; and &quot;Voyager 2&quot; had dropped to 267.9 W and 269.2 W respectively, about 57% of the power at launch. The level of power output was better than pre-launch predictions based on a conservative thermocouple degradation model. As the electrical power decreases, spacecraft loads must be turned off, eliminating some capabilities. There may be insufficient power for communications by 2032.
== Voyager Interstellar Mission ==

The Voyager primary mission was completed in 1989, with the close flyby of Neptune by &quot;Voyager 2&quot;. The Voyager Interstellar Mission (VIM) is a mission extension, which began when the two spacecraft had already been in flight for over 12 years. The Heliophysics Division of the NASA Science Mission Directorate conducted a Heliophysics Senior Review in 2008. The panel found that the VIM &quot;is a mission that is absolutely imperative to continue&quot; and that VIM &quot;funding near the optimal level and increased DSN (Deep Space Network) support is warranted.&quot;

The main objective of the VIM was to extend the exploration of the Solar System beyond the outer planets to the heliopause (the farthest extent at which the Sun&#x27;s radiation predominates over interstellar winds) and if possible even beyond. Voyager 1 crossed the heliopause boundary in 2012, followed by Voyager 2 in 2018. Passing through the heliopause boundary has allowed both spacecraft to make measurements of the interstellar fields, particles and waves unaffected by the solar wind. Two significant findings so far have been the discovery of a region of magnetic bubbles and no indication of an expected shift in the Solar magnetic field.

The entire &quot;Voyager 2&quot; scan platform, including all of the platform instruments, was switched off in 1998. All platform instruments on &quot;Voyager 1&quot;, except for the ultraviolet spectrometer (UVS) have also been switched off.

The &quot;Voyager 1&quot; scan platform was scheduled to go off-line in late 2000 but has been left on to investigate UV emission from the upwind direction.
UVS data are still captured but scans are no longer possible.

Gyro operations ended in 2016 for &quot;Voyager 2&quot; and in 2017 for &quot;Voyager 1&quot;. Gyro operations are used to rotate the probe 360 degrees six times per year to measure the magnetic field of the spacecraft, which is then subtracted from the magnetometer science data.

The two spacecraft continue to operate, with some loss in subsystem redundancy but retain the capability to return scientific data from a full complement of Voyager Interstellar Mission (VIM) science instruments.

Both spacecraft also have adequate electrical power and attitude control propellant to continue operating until around 2025, after which there may not be electrical power to support science instrument operation; science data return and spacecraft operations will cease.

=== Mission details ===

By the start of VIM, &quot;Voyager 1&quot; was at a distance of 40 AU from the Earth, while &quot;Voyager 2&quot; was at 31 AU. VIM is in three phases: termination shock, heliosheath exploration, and interstellar exploration phase. The spacecraft began VIM in an environment controlled by the Sun&#x27;s magnetic field, with the plasma particles being dominated by those contained in the expanding supersonic solar wind. This is the characteristic environment of the termination shock phase. At some distance from the Sun, the supersonic solar wind will be held back from further expansion by the interstellar wind. The first feature encountered by a spacecraft as a result of this interaction – between interstellar wind and solar wind – was the termination shock, where the solar wind slows to subsonic speed, and large changes in plasma flow direction and magnetic field orientation occur. &quot;Voyager 1&quot; completed the phase of termination shock in December 2004 at a distance of 94 AU, while &quot;Voyager 2&quot; completed it in August 2007 at a distance of 84 AU. After entering into the heliosheath, the spacecraft were in an area that is dominated by the Sun&#x27;s magnetic field and solar wind particles. After passing through the heliosheath, the two Voyagers began the phase of interstellar exploration. The outer boundary of the heliosheath is called the heliopause. This is the region where the Sun&#x27;s influence begins to decrease and interstellar space can be detected. 

&quot;Voyager 1&quot; is escaping the Solar System at the speed of 3.6 AU per year 35° north of the ecliptic in the general direction of the solar apex in Hercules, while &quot;Voyager 2&quot;″s speed is about 3.3 AU per year, heading 48° south of the ecliptic. The Voyager spacecraft will eventually go on to the stars. In about 40,000 years, &quot;Voyager 1&quot; will be within 1.6 light years (ly) of AC+79 3888, also known as Gliese 445, which is approaching the Sun. In 40,000 years &quot;Voyager 2&quot; will be within 1.7 ly of Ross 248 (another star which is approaching the Sun), and in 296,000 years it will pass within 4.6 ly of Sirius, which is the brightest star in the night-sky. The spacecraft are not expected to collide with a star for 1 sextillion (1020) years.

In October 2020, astronomers reported a significant unexpected increase in density in the space beyond the Solar System, as detected by the Voyager space probes. According to the researchers, this implies that &quot;the density gradient is a large-scale feature of the VLISM (very local interstellar medium) in the general direction of the heliospheric nose&quot;.

==Voyager Golden Record==
Both spacecraft carry a golden phonograph record that contains pictures and sounds of Earth, symbolic directions on the cover for playing the record, and data detailing the location of Earth. The record is intended as a combination time capsule and an interstellar message to any civilization, alien or far-future human, that may recover either of the Voyagers. The contents of this record were selected by a committee that included Timothy Ferris and was chaired by Carl Sagan.

== &quot;Pale Blue Dot&quot; ==
&quot;Pale Blue Dot&quot; is a photograph of Earth taken on February 14, 1990, by the &quot;Voyager 1&quot; space probe from a distance of approximately kilometers ( miles, 40.5 AU), as part of that day&#x27;s &quot;Family Portrait&quot; series of images of the Solar System.
The Voyager program&#x27;s discoveries during the primary phase of its mission, including new close-up color photos of the major planets, were regularly documented by print and electronic media outlets. Among the best-known of these is an image of the Earth as a &quot;Pale Blue Dot&quot;, taken in 1990 by &quot;Voyager 1&quot;, and popularized by Carl Sagan,

<text>Patience, or , is the ability to endure difficult or undesired long-term circumstances. Patience involves perseverance or tolerance in the face of delay, provocation, or stress without responding negatively, such as reacting with disrespect or anger. Patience is also used to refer to the character trait of being disciplined and steadfast. Antonyms of patience include impatience, , and .

== Scientific perspectives ==
In psychology and in cognitive neuroscience, patience is studied as a decision-making problem, involving the choice of either a small reward in the short-term, versus a more valuable reward in the long-term.

In a 2005 study, common marmosets and cottontop tamarins chose between taking an immediate small reward and waiting a variable amount of time for a large reward. Under these conditions, marmosets waited significantly longer for food than tamarins. This difference cannot be explained by life history, social behaviour, or brain size. It can, however, be explained by feeding ecology: marmosets rely on gum, a food product acquired by waiting for exudate to flow from trees, whereas tamarins feed on insects, a food product requiring impulsive action. Foraging ecology, therefore, may provide a selective pressure for the evolution of self-control.

Patience of human users in the online world has been a subject of research. In a 2012 study of tens of millions of users who watched videos on the Internet, Krishnan and Sitaraman showed that users lose patience in as little as two seconds while waiting for their chosen video to start playing. Users who connect to the Internet at faster speeds are less patient than their counterparts at slower speeds, demonstrating a link between the human expectation of speed and human patience. These and other studies of patience led commentators to conclude that the rapid pace of technology is rewiring humans to be less patient.

== Religious perspectives ==
=== Judaism ===
Patience and fortitude are prominent themes in Judaism. The Talmud extols patience as an important personal trait. The story of Micah, for example, is that he suffers many challenging conditions and yet endures, saying &quot;I will wait for the God who saves me.&quot; Patience in God, it is said, will aid believers in finding the strength to be delivered from the evils that are inherent in the physical life.

In the Hebrew Torah, patience is referred to in several proverbs, such as &quot;The patient man shows much good sense, but the quick-tempered man displays folly at its height&quot; (); &quot;An ill-tempered man stirs up strife, but a patient man allays discord.&quot; (); and &quot;A patient man is better than a warrior, and he who rules his temper, than he who takes a city.&quot; (). Patience is also discussed in other sections, such as Ecclesiastes: &quot;Better is the patient spirit than the lofty spirit. Do not in spirit become quickly discontented, for discontent lodges in the bosom of a fool.&quot; ().

=== Christianity ===
In the Christian religion, patience is one of the most valuable virtues. The Holy Ghost increases patience in the Christian who has accepted the gift of salvation. While patience is not one of the traditional biblical three theological virtues or one of the traditional cardinal virtues, it is part of the fruit of the Holy Spirit, according to the Apostle Paul in his Epistle to the Galatians. Patience was included in later formulations of the seven virtues.

In the Christian Bible, patience is referred to in several sections. The Book of Proverbs notes that &quot;through patience a ruler can be persuaded, and a gentle tongue can break a bone&quot; (, NIV); Ecclesiastes points out that the &quot;end of a matter is better than its beginning, and patience is better than pride&quot; (, NIV); and 1 Thessalonians states that we should &quot;be patient with all. See that no one returns evil for evil; rather, always seek what is good for each other and for all&quot; (, NAB). In the Epistle of James, the Bible urges Christians to be patient, and &quot;see how the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth... until it receives the early and the late rains.&quot; (, NAB). In Galatians, patience is listed as part of the &quot;fruit of the Spirit&quot;: &quot;love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. Against such things there is no law&quot; (, NIV). In Timothy, the Bible states that &quot;Jesus might display his unlimited patience as an example for those who would believe on him and receive eternal life&quot; ( NIV).

=== Islam ===
Patience with steadfast belief in Allah is called (), one of the best virtues in Islam. Through , a Muslim believes that an individual can grow closer to God and thus attain true peace. Islam stresses that Allah is with those who are patient, more specifically during calamity and suffering. Several verses in Quran urge Muslims to seek Allah&#x27;s help when faced with fear and loss, with patient prayers and perseverance for Allah. For example:

Similarly, patience is mentioned in hadith Sahih Bukhari:

In Islamic tradition, Job (Arabic: , romanized: ) demonstrated patience and steadfast belief in Allah. Ibn Kathir narrates the story in this manner: Job was a very rich person with much land, and many animals and children — all of which were lost and soon he was struck with disease as a test from Allah. He remained steadfast and patient in his prayers to Allah, so Allah eventually relieved him of the disease, gave him double the money he lost, and raised to life twice the number of children who had died before him.

=== Buddhism ===
In Buddhism, patience (Skt.: ; Pali: ) is one of the &quot;perfections&quot; () that a bodhisattva trains in and practices to realize perfect enlightenment (). The Buddhist concept of patience is distinct from the English definition of the word. In Buddhism, patience refers to not returning harm, rather than merely enduring a difficult situation. It is the ability to control one&#x27;s emotions even when being criticized or attacked. Verse 184 of the Dhammapada says &quot;enduring patience is the highest austerity&quot;.

Tibetan Buddhist Thubten Zopa recommended that people train in forbearance by taking advantage of encounters with difficult people:

=== Hinduism ===
Patience/forbearance is considered an essential virtue in Hinduism. In ancient literature of Hinduism, the concept of patience is referred to with the word (patience and forbearance, Sanskrit: ), and several other words such as (patient toleration, Sanskrit: ), (forbearance, Sanskrit: ), or (suffer with patience, Sanskrit: , ) and several others.

Patience, in Hindu philosophy, is the cheerful endurance of trying conditions and the consequence of one&#x27;s action and deeds (karma). It is also the capacity to wait, to endure opposites—such as pain and pleasure, cold and heat, sorrows and joys—calmly, without anxiety, and without a desire to seek revenge. In interpersonal relationships, virtuous means that if someone attacks or insults without cause, one must endure it without feeling enmity, anger, resentment, or anxiety. Patience is explained as being more than trust, as a value that reflects the state of one&#x27;s body and mind. The term is sometimes also translated as test or exam, in other contexts. Some of these concepts have been carried into the spiritual understanding of yoga. Sandilya Upanishad of Hinduism identifies ten sources of patience and forbearance. In each of these ten forbearances, the virtuous implicit belief is that our current spirit and the future for everyone, including oneself, will be stronger if these forbearances are one&#x27;s guide. The ten are:
The classical literature of Hinduism exists in many Indian languages. For example, &quot;Tirukkuṛaḷ&quot; written between and , and sometimes called the Tamil Veda, is one of the most cherished classics on Hinduism written in a South Indian language. It too discusses patience and forbearance, dedicating Chapter 16 of Book 1 to that topic. &quot;Tirukkuṛaḷ&quot; suggests &quot;patience&quot; is necessary for an ethical life and for one&#x27;s long term happiness, even if patience is sometimes difficult in the short term. Excerpts from this book include: &quot;our conduct must always foster forbearance&quot;; &quot;one must patiently endure rude remarks, because it delivers us to purity&quot;; &quot;if we are unjustly wronged by others, it is best to conquer our hurt with patience, accept suffering, and refrain from unrighteous retaliation&quot;; &quot;it is good to patiently endure injuries done to you, but to forget them is even better&quot;; &quot;just as the Earth bears those who dig into her, one must with patience bear with those who despise us&quot;, and so on.

=== Meher Baba ===
The spiritual teacher Meher Baba stated that &quot;[O]ne of the first requirements of the [spiritual] aspirant is that he should combine &quot;unfailing enthusiasm with unyielding patience&quot;... Spiritual effort demands not only physical endurance and courage, but also unshrinking forbearance and unassailable moral courage.&quot;

== Philosophical perspectives ==

In his 1878 book &quot;Human, All Too Human&quot;, philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche argued that &quot;being able to wait is so hard that the greatest poets did not disdain to make the inability to wait the theme of their poetry&quot;. He notes that &quot;Passion will not wait&quot;, and gives the example of cases of duels, in which the &quot;advising friends have to determine whether the parties involved might be able to wait a while longer. If they cannot, then a duel is reasonable [because]... to wait would be to continue suffering the horrible torture of offended honor...&quot;.

<text>The trogons and [[quetzal]]s are birds in the order Trogoniformes which contains only one family, the Trogonidae. The family Trogonidae contains 46 species in seven genera. The fossil record of the trogons dates back 49 million years to the Early Eocene. They might constitute a member of the basal radiation of the order Coraciiformes and order Passeriformes or be closely related to mousebirds and owls. The word &quot;trogon&quot; is Greek for &quot;nibbling&quot; and refers to the fact that these birds gnaw holes in trees to make their nests.

Trogons are residents of tropical forests worldwide. The greatest diversity is in the Neotropics, where four genera, containing 24 species, occur. The genus &quot;Apaloderma&quot; contains the three African species. The genera &quot;Harpactes&quot; and &quot;Apalharpactes&quot;, containing twelve species, are found in southeast Asia.

They feed on insects and fruit, and their broad bills and weak legs reflect their diet and arboreal habits. Although their flight is fast, they are reluctant to fly any distance. Trogons are generally not migratory, although some species undertake partial local movements. Trogons have soft, often colourful, feathers with distinctive male and female plumage. They are the only type of animal with a heterodactyl toe arrangement. They nest in holes dug into trees or termite nests, laying 2–4 white or pastel-coloured eggs.

==Evolution and taxonomy==

The position of the trogons within the class Aves has been a long-standing mystery. A variety of relations have been suggested, including the parrots, cuckoos, toucans, jacamars and puffbirds, rollers, owls and nightjars. More recent morphological and molecular evidence has suggested a relationship with the Coliiformes. The unique arrangement of the toes on the foot (see morphology and flight) has led many to consider the trogons to have no close relatives; to place them in their own order, possibly with the similarly atypical mousebirds as their closest relatives.

The earliest formally described fossil specimen is a cranium from the Fur Formation Lower Eocene in Denmark (54 mya). Other trogoniform fossils have been found in the Messel pit deposits from the mid-Eocene in Germany (49 mya), and in Oligocene and Miocene deposits from Switzerland and France respectively. The oldest New World fossil of a trogon is from the comparatively recent Pleistocene (less than 2.588 mya).

The family had been thought to have an Old World origin notwithstanding the current richness of the family, which is more diverse in the Neotropical New World. DNA evidence seemed to support an African origin for the trogons, with the African genus &quot;Apaloderma&quot; seemingly basal in the family, and the other two lineages, the Asian and American, breaking off 20–36 million years ago. More recent studies show that the DNA evidence gives contradictory results concerning the basal phylogenetic relationships; so it is currently unknown if all extant trogons are descended from an African ancestor, an American ancestor or neither.

The trogons are split into three subfamilies, each reflecting one of these splits. Aplodermatinae is the African subfamily and contains a single genus, &quot;Apaloderma&quot;. Harpactinae is the Asian subfamily and contains two genera, &quot;Harpactes&quot; and &quot;Apalharpactes&quot;. &quot;Apalharpactes&quot;, consisting of two species in Java and Sumatra, has only recently been accepted as a separate genus from &quot;Harpactes&quot;. The remaining subfamily, the Neotropical Trogoninae, contains the remaining four genera, &quot;Trogon&quot;, &quot;Priotelus&quot;, &quot;Pharomachrus&quot; and &quot;Euptilotis&quot;.
 The two Caribbean species of &quot;Priotelus&quot; were formerly different ones (&quot;Temnotrogon&quot; on Hispaniola), and are extremely ancient. The two quetzal genera, &quot;Pharomachrus&quot; and &quot;Euptilotis&quot; are possibly derived from the final and most numerous genus of trogons in the Neotropics, &quot;Trogon&quot;. A 2008 study of the genetics of &quot;Trogon&quot; suggested the genus originated in Central America and radiated into South America after the formation of the Isthmus of Panama (as part of the Great American Interchange), thus making trogons relatively recent arrivals in South America.

==Distribution and habitat==

The majority of trogons are birds of tropical and subtropical forests. They have a cosmopolitan distribution in the worlds wet tropics, being found in the Americas, Africa and Asia. A few species are distributed into the temperate zone, with one species, the elegant trogon, reaching the south of the United States, specifically southern Arizona and the surrounding area. The Narina trogon of Africa is slightly exceptional in that it utilises a wider range of habitats than any other trogon, ranging from dense forest to fairly open savannah, and from the Equator to southern South Africa. It is the most widespread and successful of all the trogons. The eared quetzal of Mexico is also able to use more xeric habitats, but preferentially inhabits forests. Most other species are more restricted in their habitat, with several species being restricted to undisturbed primary forest. Within forests they tend to be found in the mid-story, occasionally in the canopy.

Some species, particularly the quetzals, are adapted to cooler montane forest. There are a number of insular species; these include a number of species found in the Greater Sundas, one species in the Philippines as well as two species endemic to Cuba and Hispaniola respectively. Outside of South East Asia and the Caribbean, however, trogons are generally absent from islands, especially oceanic ones.

Trogons are generally sedentary, with no species known to undertake long migrations. A small number of species are known to make smaller migratory movements, particularly montane species which move to lower altitudes during different seasons. This has been demonstrated using radio tracking in the resplendent quetzal in Costa Rica and evidence has been accumulated for a number of other species. The Narina trogon of Africa is thought to undertake some localised short-distance migrations over parts of its range, for example birds of Zimbabwe&#x27;s plateau savannah depart after the breeding season. A complete picture of these movements is however lacking. Trogons are difficult to study as their thick tarsi (feet bones) make ringing studies difficult.

==Morphology and flight==

The trogons as a family are fairly uniform in appearance, having compact bodies and long tails (very long in the case of the quetzals), and short necks. Trogons range in size from the , scarlet-rumped trogon to the , resplendent quetzal (not including the male quetzal&#x27;s tail streamers). Their legs and feet are weak and short, and trogons are essentially unable to walk beyond a very occasional shuffle along a branch. They are even incapable of turning around on a branch without using their wings. The ratio of leg muscle to body weight in trogons is only 3%, the lowest known ratio of any bird. The arrangement of toes on the feet of trogons is also unique among birds, although essentially resembling the zygodactyl&#x27;s two forward two backward arrangement of parrots and other near-passerines, the actual toes are arranged with usually inner hallux being the outer hind toe, an arrangement that is referred to as heterodactylous. The strong bill is short and the gape wide, particularly in the fruit eating quetzals, with a slight hook at the end. There is also a notch at the end of the bill and many species have slight serrations in the mandibles. The skin is exceptionally tender, making preparation of study skins difficult for museum curators. The skeletons of trogons are surprisingly slender, particularly the skulls which are very thin. The plumage of many species is iridescent, although not in most of the Asian species. The African trogons are generally green on the back with red bellies. The New World trogons similarly have green or deep blue upperparts but are more varied in their lowerparts. The Asian species tend towards red underparts and brown backs.

The wings are short but strong, with the wing muscle ratio being around 22% of the body weight. In spite of the strength of their flight, trogons do not fly often or for great distances, generally flying no more than a few hundred metres at a time. Only the montane species tend to make long-distance flights. Shorter flights tend to be direct and swift, but longer flights are slightly undulating. Their flight can be surprisingly silent (for observers), although that of a few species is reportedly quite noisy.

===Calls===
The calls of trogons are generally loud and uncomplex, consisting of monosyllabic hoots and whistles delivered in varying patterns and sequences. The calls of the quetzals and the two Caribbean genera are the most complex. Among the Asian genera the Sumatran trogon (&quot;Apalharpactes&quot;) has the most atypical call of any trogon, research has not yet established whether the closely related Javan trogon has a similar call. The calls of the other Asian genus, &quot;Harpactes&quot;, are remarkably uniform. In addition to the territorial and breeding calls given by males and females during the breeding seasons, trogons have been recorded as having aggression calls given by competing males and alarm calls.

==Behaviour==
Trogons are generally inactive outside of infrequent feeding flights. Among birdwatchers and biologists it has been noted that &quot;[a]part from their great beauty [they] are notorious ... for their lack of other immediately engaging qualities&quot;. Their lack of activity is possibly a defence against predation; trogons on all continents have been reported to shift about on branches to always keep their less brightly coloured backs turned towards observers, while their heads, which like owls can turn through 180 degrees, keep a watch on the watcher. Trogons have reportedly been preyed upon by hawks and predatory mammals; one report was of a resplendent quetzal taken while brooding young by a margay.

===Diet and feeding===
Trogons feed principally on insects, other arthropods, and fruit; to a lesser extent some small vertebrates such as lizards are taken. Among the insect prey taken one of the more important types are caterpillars; along with cuckoos, trogons are one of the few birds groups to regularly prey upon them. Some caterpillars are known to be poisonous to trogons though, like &quot;Arsenura armida. &quot;The extent to which each food type is taken varies depending on geography and species. The three African trogons are exclusively insectivorous, whereas the Asian and American genera consume varying amounts of fruit. Diet is somewhat correlated with size, with larger species feeding more on fruit and smaller species focusing on insects.

Prey is almost always obtained on the wing. The most commonly employed foraging technique is a sally-glean flight, where a trogon flies from an observation perch to a target on another branch or in foliage. Once there the birds hovers or stalls and snatches the item before returning to its perch to consume the item. This type of foraging is commonly used by some types of bird to obtain insect prey; in trogons and quetzals it is also used to pluck fruit from trees. Insect prey may also be taken on the wing, with the trogon pursuing flying insects in a similar manner to drongos and Old World flycatchers. Frogs, lizards and large insects on the ground may also be pounced on from the air. More rarely some trogons may shuffle along a branch to obtain insects, insect eggs and very occasionally nestling birds. Violaceous trogons will consume wasps and wasp larvae encountered while digging nests.

===Breeding===

Trogons are territorial and monogamous. Males will respond quickly to playbacks of their calls and will repel other members of the same species and even other hole-nesting species from around their nesting sites. Males attract females by singing, and, in the case of the resplendent quetzal, undertaking display flights. Some species have been observed in small flocks of 3–12 individuals prior to and sometimes during the breeding season, calling and chasing each other, but the function of these flocks is unclear.

Trogons are cavity nesters. Nests are dug into rotting wood or termite nests, with one species, the violaceous trogon, nesting in wasp nests. Nest cavities can either be deep upward slanting tubes that lead to fully enclosed chambers, or much shallower open niches (from which the bird is visible). Nests are dug with the beak, incidentally giving the family its name. Nest digging may be undertaken by the male alone or by both sexes. In the case of nests dug into tree trunks, the wood must be strong enough not to collapse but soft enough to dig out. Trogons have been observed landing on dead tree trunks and slapping the wood with their tails, presumably to test the firmness.

The nests of trogons are thought to usually be unlined. Between two and four eggs are laid in a nesting attempt. These are round and generally glossy white or lightly coloured (buff, grey, blue or green), although they get increasingly dirty during incubation. Both parents incubate the eggs (except in the case of the bare-cheeked trogon, where apparently the male takes no part), with the male taking one long incubation stint a day and the female incubating the rest of the time. Incubation seems to begin after the last egg is laid. The incubation period varies by species, usually lasting between 16–19 days. On hatching the chicks are altricial, blind and naked. The chicks acquire feathers rapidly in some of the montane species, in the case of the mountain trogon in a week, but more slowly in lowland species like the black-headed trogon, which may take twice as long. The nestling period varies by species and size, with smaller species generally taking 16 to 17 days to fledge, whereas larger species may take as long as 30 days, although 23–25 days is more typical.

==Relationship with humans==
Trogons and quetzals are considered to be &quot;among the most beautiful of birds&quot;, yet they are also often reclusive and seldom seen. Little is known about much of their biology, and much of what is known about them comes from the research of neotropical species by the ornithologist Alexander Skutch. Trogons are nevertheless popular birds with birdwatchers, and there is a modest ecotourism industry in particular to view quetzals in Central America.

<text>H.M.S. Pinafore; or, The Lass That Loved a Sailor is a comic opera in two acts, with music by Arthur Sullivan and a libretto by W. S. Gilbert. It opened at the Opera Comique in London on 25 May 1878, and ran for 571 performances, which was the second-longest run of any musical theatre piece up to that time. &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; was Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s fourth operatic collaboration and their first international sensation.

The story takes place aboard the Royal Navy ship HMS &quot;Pinafore&quot;. The captain&#x27;s daughter, Josephine, is in love with a lower-class sailor, Ralph Rackstraw, although her father intends her to marry Sir Joseph Porter, the First Lord of the Admiralty. She abides by her father&#x27;s wishes at first, but Sir Joseph&#x27;s advocacy of the equality of humankind encourages Ralph and Josephine to overturn conventional social order. They declare their love for each other and eventually plan to elope. The Captain discovers this plan, but, as in many of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, a surprise disclosure changes things dramatically near the end of the story.

Drawing on several of his earlier &quot;Bab Ballad&quot; poems, Gilbert imbued this plot with mirth and absurdity. The opera&#x27;s humour focuses on love between members of different social classes and lampoons the British class system in general. &quot;Pinafore&quot; also pokes good-natured fun at patriotism, party politics, the Royal Navy, and the rise of unqualified people to positions of authority. The title of the piece comically applies the name of a garment for girls and women, a pinafore, to the fearsome symbol of a warship.

&quot;Pinafore&quot;″s extraordinary popularity in Britain, America and elsewhere was followed by the similar success of a series of Gilbert and Sullivan works, including &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; and &quot;The Mikado&quot;. Their works, later known as the Savoy operas, dominated the musical stage on both sides of the Atlantic for more than a decade and continue to be performed today. The structure and style of these operas, particularly &quot;Pinafore&quot;, were much copied and contributed significantly to the development of modern musical theatre.

==Background==
In 1875, Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte, who was then managing the Royalty Theatre for Selina Dolaro, brought Gilbert and Sullivan together to write their second show, a one-act opera entitled &quot;Trial by Jury&quot;. This proved a success, and in 1876 D&#x27;Oyly Carte assembled a group of financial backers to establish the Comedy Opera Company, which was devoted to the production and promotion of family-friendly English comic opera. With this theatre company, Carte finally had the financial resources, after many failed attempts, to produce a new full-length Gilbert and Sullivan opera. This next opera was &quot;The Sorcerer&quot;, which opened in November 1877. It too was successful, running for 178 performances. Sheet music from the show sold well, and street musicians played the melodies.

Instead of writing a piece for production by a theatre proprietor, as was usual in Victorian theatres, Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte produced the show with their own financial support. They were therefore able to choose their own cast of performers, rather than being obliged to use the actors already engaged at the theatre. They chose talented actors, most of whom were not well-known stars and did not command high fees, and to whom they could teach a more naturalistic style of performance than was commonly used at the time. They then tailored their work to the particular abilities of these performers. The skill with which Gilbert and Sullivan used their performers had an effect on the audience; as critic Herman Klein wrote: &quot;we secretly marvelled at the naturalness and ease with which [the Gilbertian quips and absurdities] were said and done. For until then no living soul had seen upon the stage such weird, eccentric, yet intensely human beings. ... [They] conjured into existence a hitherto unknown comic world of sheer delight.&quot;
The success of &quot;The Sorcerer&quot; paved the way for another collaboration by Gilbert and Sullivan. Carte agreed on terms for a new opera with the Comedy Opera Company, and Gilbert began work on &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; before the end of 1877. Gilbert&#x27;s father had been a naval surgeon, and the nautical theme of the opera appealed to him. He drew on several of his earlier &quot;Bab Ballad&quot; poems (many of which also have nautical themes), including &quot;Captain Reece&quot; (1868) and &quot;General John&quot; (1867). Some of the characters also have prototypes in the ballads: Dick Deadeye is based on a character in &quot;Woman&#x27;s Gratitude&quot; (1869); an early version of Ralph Rackstraw can be seen in &quot;Joe Go-Lightly&quot; (1867), with its sailor madly in love with the daughter of someone who far outranks him; and Little Buttercup is taken almost wholesale from &quot;The Bumboat Woman&#x27;s Story&quot; (1870). On 27 December 1877, while Sullivan was on holiday on the French Riviera, Gilbert sent him a plot sketch accompanied by the following note:
Despite Gilbert&#x27;s disclaimer, audiences, critics and even the Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli, identified Sir Joseph Porter with W. H. Smith, a politician who had recently been appointed First Lord of the Admiralty despite having neither military nor nautical experience. Sullivan was delighted with the sketch, and Gilbert read a first draft of the plot to Carte in mid-January.

Following the example of his mentor, T. W. Robertson, Gilbert strove to ensure that the costumes and sets were as realistic as possible. When preparing the sets for &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;, Gilbert and Sullivan visited Portsmouth in April 1878 to inspect ships. Gilbert made sketches of H.M.S. &quot;Victory&quot; and H.M.S. &quot;St Vincent&quot; and created a model set for the carpenters to work from. This was far from standard procedure in Victorian drama, in which naturalism was still a relatively new concept, and in which most authors had very little influence on how their plays and libretti were staged. This attention to detail was typical of Gilbert&#x27;s stage management and would be repeated in all of his Savoy operas. Gilbert&#x27;s focus on visual accuracy provided a &quot;right-side-up for topsy-turvydom&quot;, that is, a realistic point of reference that serves to heighten the whimsicality and absurdity of the situations. Sullivan was &quot;in the full swing&quot; of work on the piece by the middle of April 1878. The bright and cheerful music of &quot;Pinafore&quot; was composed during a time when Sullivan suffered from excruciating pain from a kidney stone. The cast began music rehearsals on 24 April, and at the beginning of May 1878, the two collaborators worked closely together at Sullivan&#x27;s flat to finalise the piece.

In &quot;Pinafore&quot;, Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte used several of the principal cast members whom they had assembled for &quot;The Sorcerer&quot;. As Gilbert had suggested to Sullivan in December 1877, &quot;Mrs. Cripps [Little Buttercup] will be a capital part for Everard ... Barrington will be a capital captain, and Grossmith a first-rate First Lord.&quot; However, Mrs Howard Paul, who had played Lady Sangazure in &quot;The Sorcerer&quot;, was declining vocally. She was under contract to play the role of Cousin Hebe in &quot;Pinafore&quot;. Gilbert made an effort to write an amusing part for her despite Sullivan&#x27;s reluctance to use her, but by mid-May 1878, both Gilbert and Sullivan wanted her out of the cast; unhappy with the role, she left. With only a week to go before opening night, Carte hired a concert singer, Jessie Bond, to play Cousin Hebe. Since Bond had little experience as an actress, Gilbert and Sullivan cut the dialogue out of the role, except for a few lines in the last scene, which they turned into recitative. Other new cast members were Emma Howson and George Power in the romantic roles, who were improvements on the romantic soprano and tenor in &quot;The Sorcerer&quot;.

Gilbert acted as stage director for his own plays and operas. He sought realism in acting, just as he strove for realistic visual elements. He deprecated self-conscious interaction with the audience and insisted on a style of portrayal in which the characters were never aware of their own absurdity but were coherent internal wholes. Sullivan conducted the music rehearsals. As was to be his usual practice in his later operas, Sullivan left the overture for the last moment, sketching it out and entrusting it to the company&#x27;s music director, in this case Alfred Cellier, to complete. &quot;Pinafore&quot; opened on 25 May 1878 at the Opera Comique.

==Synopsis==
===Act I===
The British warship H.M.S. &quot;Pinafore&quot; is at anchor off Portsmouth. The sailors are on the quarterdeck, proudly &quot;cleaning brasswork, splicing rope, etc.&quot;

Little Buttercup, a Portsmouth &quot;bumboat woman&quot; (dockside vendor) – who is the rosiest, roundest, and &quot;reddest beauty in all Spithead&quot; – comes on board to sell her wares to the crew. She hints that she may be hiding a dark secret under her &quot;gay and frivolous exterior&quot;. Ralph Rackstraw, &quot;the smartest lad in all the fleet&quot;, enters, declaring his love for the Captain&#x27;s daughter, Josephine. His fellow sailors (excepting Dick Deadeye, the grim and ugly realist of the crew) offer their sympathies, but they can give Ralph little hope that his love will ever be returned.
The gentlemanly and popular Captain Corcoran greets his &quot;gallant crew&quot; and compliments them on their politeness, saying that he returns the favour by never (&quot;well, hardly ever&quot;) using bad language, such as &quot;a big, big D&quot;. After the sailors leave, the Captain confesses to Little Buttercup that Josephine is reluctant to consider a marriage proposal from Sir Joseph Porter, the First Lord of the Admiralty. Buttercup says that she knows how it feels to love in vain. As she leaves, the Captain remarks that she is &quot;a plump and pleasing person&quot;. Josephine enters and reveals to her father that she loves a humble sailor in his crew, but she assures him that she is a dutiful daughter and will never reveal her love to this sailor.

Sir Joseph comes on board, accompanied by his &quot;admiring crowd of sisters, cousins, and aunts&quot;. He recounts how he rose from humble beginnings to be &quot;ruler of the Queen&#x27;s Navee&quot; through persistence, although he has no naval qualifications. He then delivers a humiliating lesson in etiquette, telling the Captain that he must always say &quot;if you please&quot; after giving an order; for &quot;A British sailor is any man&#x27;s equal&quot; – excepting Sir Joseph&#x27;s. Sir Joseph has composed a song to illustrate that point, and he gives a copy of it to Ralph. Shortly afterwards, elated by Sir Joseph&#x27;s views on equality, Ralph decides that he will declare his love to Josephine. This delights his shipmates, except Dick Deadeye, who contends that &quot;when people have to obey other people&#x27;s orders, equality&#x27;s out of the question&quot;. Shocked by his words, the other sailors force Dick to listen to Sir Joseph&#x27;s song before they exit, leaving Ralph alone on deck. Josephine now enters, and Ralph confesses his love in terms surprisingly eloquent for a &quot;common sailor&quot;. Josephine is touched, but although she has found Sir Joseph&#x27;s attentions nauseating, she knows that it is her duty to marry Sir Joseph instead of Ralph. Disguising her true feelings, she &quot;haughtily rejects&quot; Ralph&#x27;s &quot;proffered love&quot;.

Ralph summons his shipmates (Sir Joseph&#x27;s female relatives also arrive) and tells them that he is bent on suicide. The crew expresses sympathy, except for Dick, who provides a stark counterpoint of dissent. Ralph puts a pistol to his head, but as he is about to pull the trigger, Josephine enters, admitting that she loves him after all. Ralph and Josephine plan to sneak ashore to elope that night. Dick Deadeye warns them to &quot;forbear, nor carry out the scheme&quot;, but the joyous ship&#x27;s company ignores him.

===Act II===
Later that night, under a full moon, Captain Corcoran reviews his concerns: his &quot;kindly crew rebels&quot;, his &quot;daughter to a tar is partial&quot;, his friends seem to desert him, and Sir Joseph has threatened a court-martial. Little Buttercup offers sympathy. He tells her that, if it were not for the difference in their social standing, he would have returned her affection. She prophesies that things are not all as they seem and that &quot;a change&quot; is in store for him, but he does not understand her cryptic warning.

Sir Joseph enters and complains that Josephine has not yet agreed to marry him. The Captain speculates that she is probably dazzled by his &quot;exalted rank&quot; and that if Sir Joseph can persuade her that &quot;love levels all ranks&quot;, she will accept his proposal. They withdraw, and Josephine enters, still feeling guilty about her planned elopement with Ralph and fearful of giving up a life of luxury. When Sir Joseph makes the argument that &quot;love levels all ranks&quot;, a delighted Josephine says that she &quot;will hesitate no longer&quot;. The Captain and Sir Joseph rejoice, but Josephine is now more determined than ever to marry Ralph.

Dick Deadeye intercepts the Captain and tells him of the lovers&#x27; plans to elope. The Captain confronts Ralph and Josephine as they try to leave the ship. The pair declare their love, justifying their actions because &quot;He is an Englishman!&quot; The furious Captain is unmoved and blurts out, &quot;Why, damme, it&#x27;s too bad!&quot; Sir Joseph and his relatives, who have overheard this oath, are shocked to hear swearing on board a ship, and Sir Joseph orders the Captain confined to his cabin.

When Sir Joseph asks what had provoked the usually polite officer&#x27;s outburst, Ralph replies that it was his declaration of love for Josephine. Furious in his turn at this revelation, and ignoring Josephine&#x27;s plea to spare Ralph, Sir Joseph has the sailor &quot;loaded with chains&quot; and taken to the ship&#x27;s brig. Little Buttercup now comes forward to reveal her long-held secret. Many years ago, when she &quot;practised baby-farming&quot;, she had cared for two babies, one &quot;of low condition&quot;, the other &quot;a regular patrician&quot;. She confesses that she &quot;mixed those children up. ... The wellborn babe was Ralph; your Captain was the other.&quot;

Sir Joseph now realises that Ralph should have been the Captain, and the Captain should have been Ralph. He summons both, and they emerge wearing each other&#x27;s uniforms: Ralph as Captain, in command of the &quot;Pinafore&quot;, and Corcoran as a common sailor. Sir Joseph&#x27;s marriage with Josephine is now &quot;out of the question&quot; in his eyes: &quot;love levels all ranks ... to a considerable extent, but it does not level them as much as that.&quot; He hands her to Captain Rackstraw. The former Captain&#x27;s now-humble social rank leaves him free to marry Buttercup. Sir Joseph settles for his cousin Hebe, and all ends in general rejoicing.

==Productions==

&quot;Pinafore&quot; opened on 25 May 1878 at the Opera Comique, before an enthusiastic audience, with Sullivan conducting. Soon, however, the piece suffered from weak ticket sales, generally ascribed to a heat wave that made the Opera Comique particularly uncomfortable. The historian Michael Ainger questions this explanation, at least in part, stating that the heat waves in the summer of 1878 were short and transient. By mid-August, Sullivan wrote to his mother that cooler weather had arrived, which was good for the show. In the meantime, the four partners of the Comedy Opera Company lost confidence in the opera&#x27;s viability and posted closing notices. Carte publicised the piece by presenting a matinee concert performance on 6 July 1878 at the enormous Crystal Palace.

In late August 1878, Sullivan used some of the &quot;Pinafore&quot; music, arranged by his assistant Hamilton Clarke, during several successful promenade concerts at Covent Garden that generated interest and stimulated ticket sales. By September, &quot;Pinafore&quot; was playing to full houses at the Opera Comique. The piano score sold 10,000 copies, and Carte soon sent two additional companies out to tour in the provinces.

Carte, Gilbert and Sullivan now had the financial resources to produce shows themselves, without outside backers. Carte persuaded the author and composer that a business partnership among the three would be to their advantage, and they hatched a plan to separate themselves from the directors of the Comedy Opera Company. The contract between Gilbert and Sullivan and the Comedy Opera Company gave the latter the right to present &quot;Pinafore&quot; for the duration of the initial run. The Opera Comique was obliged to close for drain and sewer repairs, and it was renovated by E. W. Bradwell, from Christmas 1878 to the end of January 1879. Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte believed that this break ended the initial run, and, therefore, ended the company&#x27;s rights. Carte put the matter beyond doubt by taking a six-month personal lease of the theatre beginning on 1 February 1879, the date of its re-opening, when &quot;Pinafore&quot; resumed. At the end of the six months, Carte planned to give notice to the Comedy Opera Company that its rights in the show and the theatre had ended.

Meanwhile, numerous versions of &quot;Pinafore&quot;, unauthorised by its creators, began playing in America with great success, beginning with a production in Boston that opened on 25 November 1878. &quot;Pinafore&quot; became a source of popular quotations on both sides of the Atlantic, such as the exchange:

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;&quot;What, never?&quot;
&quot;No, never!&quot;
&quot;What, &quot;never?&quot;&quot;
&quot;Well, hardly ever!&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;
In February 1879, &quot;Pinafore&quot; resumed operations at the Opera Comique. The opera also resumed touring in April, with two companies crisscrossing the British provinces by June, one starring Richard Mansfield as Sir Joseph, the other W. S. Penley in the role. Hoping to join in on the profits to be made in America from &quot;Pinafore&quot;, Carte left in June for New York to make arrangements for an &quot;authentic&quot; production there to be rehearsed personally by the author and composer. He arranged to rent a theatre and auditioned chorus members for the American production of &quot;Pinafore&quot; and a new Gilbert and Sullivan opera to be premiered in New York, and for tours.

Sullivan, as had been arranged with Carte and Gilbert, gave notice to the partners of the Comedy Opera Company in early July 1879 that he, Gilbert and Carte would not be renewing the contract to produce &quot;Pinafore&quot; with them and that he would be withdrawing his music from the Comedy Opera Company on 31 July. In return, the Comedy Opera Company gave notice that they intended to play &quot;Pinafore&quot; at another theatre and brought a legal action against Carte and company. They offered the London and touring casts of &quot;Pinafore&quot; more money to play in their production, and although some choristers accepted their offer, only one principal player, Aeneas Joseph Dymott, accepted. They engaged the Imperial Theatre but had no scenery. On 31 July, they sent a group of thugs to seize the scenery and props during Act II of the evening performance at the Opera Comique. Gilbert was away, and Sullivan was recovering from an operation for kidney stones. Stagehands and cast members managed to ward off their backstage attackers and protect the scenery, although the stage manager, Richard Barker, and others, were injured. The cast went on with the show until someone shouted &quot;Fire!&quot; George Grossmith, playing Sir Joseph, went before the curtain to calm the panicked audience. The police arrived to restore order, and the show continued. Gilbert sued to stop the Comedy Opera Company from staging their rival production of &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;. The court permitted the production to go on at the Imperial, beginning on 1 August 1879, and it transferred to the Olympic Theatre in September. Pauline Rita was one of a series of Josephines. The production received good notices and initially sold well but was withdrawn in October after 91 performances. The matter was eventually settled in court, where a judge ruled in Carte&#x27;s favour about two years later.

After his return to London, Carte formed a new partnership with Gilbert and Sullivan to divide profits equally after the expenses of each of their shows. Meanwhile, &quot;Pinafore&quot; continued to play strongly. On 20 February 1880, &quot;Pinafore&quot; completed its initial run of 571 performances. Only one other work of musical theatre in the world had ever run longer, Robert Planquette&#x27;s operetta &quot;Les cloches de Corneville&quot;.

===Taking &quot;Pinafore&quot; to the United States===

Approximately 150 unauthorised productions of &quot;Pinafore&quot; sprang up in the United States in 1878 and 1879, and none of these paid royalties to the authors. Gilbert and Sullivan called them &quot;pirated&quot;, although the creators did not have any international copyright protection. The first of these productions, opening at the Boston Museum on 25 November 1878, made such a splash that the piece was quickly produced in major cities and on tour by dozens of companies throughout the country. Boston alone saw at least a dozen productions, including a juvenile version described by Louisa May Alcott in her 1879 story, &quot;Jimmy&#x27;s Cruise in the Pinafore&quot;. In New York, different productions of the piece played simultaneously in eight theatres within five blocks of each other and in six theatres in Philadelphia. A production by Gorman&#x27;s Philadelphia Church Choir Company, orchestrated by John Philip Sousa and starring Louis De Lange as Sir Joseph, played on Broadway and toured in the U.S. throughout 1879; Sousa&#x27;s orchestration was also used in Australasia.

These unauthorised performances took many forms, including burlesques, productions with men playing women&#x27;s roles and vice versa, spoofs, variety acts, Minstrel show versions, all-black and Catholic productions, German, Yiddish and other foreign-language versions, performances on boats or by church choirs, and productions starring casts of children. Few purported to play the opera as written. Sheet music arrangements were popular, there were &quot;Pinafore&quot;-themed dolls and household items, and references to the opera were common in advertising, news and other media. Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte brought lawsuits in the U.S. and tried for many years to control the American performance copyrights over their operas, or at least to claim some royalties, without success. They made a special effort to claim American rights for their next work after &quot;Pinafore&quot;, &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;, by giving the official premiere in New York.

Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte met by 24 April 1879 to make plans for a production of &quot;Pinafore&quot; in America. Carte travelled to New York in the summer of 1879 and made arrangements with theatre manager John T. Ford to present, at the Fifth Avenue Theatre, the first authorised American production of &quot;Pinafore&quot;. In November, Carte returned to America with Gilbert, Sullivan and a company of strong singers, including J. H. Ryley as Sir Joseph, Blanche Roosevelt as Josephine, Alice Barnett as Little Buttercup, Furneaux Cook as Dick Deadeye, Hugh Talbot as Ralph Rackstraw and Jessie Bond as Cousin Hebe. To these, he added some American singers, including Signor Brocolini as Captain Corcoran. Alfred Cellier came to assist Sullivan, while his brother François remained in London to conduct &quot;Pinafore&quot; there.

&quot;Pinafore&quot; opened in New York on 1 December 1879 (with Gilbert onstage in the chorus) and ran for the rest of December. After a reasonably strong first week, audiences quickly fell off, since most New Yorkers had already seen local productions of &quot;Pinafore&quot;. In the meantime, Gilbert and Sullivan raced to complete and rehearse their new opera, &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;, which premiered with much success on 31 December. Shortly thereafter, Carte sent three touring companies around the United States East Coast and Midwest, playing &quot;Pinafore&quot; alongside &quot;Pirates&quot;.

===Children&#x27;s production===

The unauthorised juvenile productions of &quot;Pinafore&quot; were so popular that Carte mounted his own children&#x27;s version, played at matinees at the Opera Comique beginning on 16 December 1879. François Cellier, who had taken over from his brother as Carte&#x27;s music director in London, adapted the score for children&#x27;s voices. Between its two Christmas seasons in London, the children&#x27;s production went on a provincial tour from 2 August 1880 to 11 December 1880.

Carte&#x27;s children&#x27;s production earned enthusiastic reviews from the critic Clement Scott and the other London critics, as well as the audiences, including children. However, Captain Corcoran&#x27;s curse &quot;Damme!&quot; was uncensored, shocking such prominent audience members as Lewis Carroll, who later wrote: &quot;a bevy of sweet innocent-looking girls sing, with bright and happy looks, the chorus &#x27;He said, Damn me! He said, Damn me!&#x27; I cannot find words to convey to the reader the pain I felt in seeing those dear children taught to utter such words to amuse ears grown callous to their ghastly meaning ... How Mr. Gilbert could have stooped to write, or Sir Arthur Sullivan could have prostituted his noble art to set to music, such vile trash, it passes my skill to understand&quot;.

===Subsequent productions===
After the opera became successful in London, Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte quickly sent touring companies into the British provinces. At least one D&#x27;Oyly Carte company, and sometimes as many as three, played &quot;Pinafore&quot; under Carte&#x27;s aegis every year between 1878 and 1888, including its first London revival in 1887. The opera was then given a rest, returning to the touring repertory between 1894 and 1900 and again for most of the time between 1903 and 1940. Gilbert directed all the revivals during his lifetime, and after his death, the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company had exclusive performing rights to the Savoy operas until 1962. It continued to hew closely to Gilbert&#x27;s directions throughout that period, as recorded in Gilbert&#x27;s prompt books, and it also required its licensees to follow them closely.
Until 1908, revivals of the opera were given in contemporary dress, with ladies&#x27; costumes executed by couture houses such as Redfern. After that, designers such as Percy Anderson, George Sheringham and Peter Goffin created Victorian costume designs. The 1887 set was designed by Hawes Craven. In the winter of 1940–41, the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company&#x27;s scenery and costumes for &quot;Pinafore&quot; and three other operas were destroyed by German bombs during World War II. The opera was revived in London in the summer of 1947. It was then included in the D&#x27;Oyly Carte repertory in every season from then on, until the company&#x27;s closure in 1982. The D&#x27;Oyly Carte company performed &quot;Pinafore&quot; before Queen Elizabeth II and the royal family at Windsor Castle on 16 June 1977, during the queen&#x27;s Silver Jubilee year, the first royal command performance of a Gilbert and Sullivan opera since 1891.

The D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company did not allow any other professional company to present the Savoy operas in Britain and the Commonwealth until the copyrights expired at the end of 1961, although it licensed many amateur and school societies to do so, beginning in the 19th century. Other professional productions since the copyrights expired have included Tyrone Guthrie&#x27;s 1960 production from Stratford, Ontario, seen on Broadway in 1960 and in London in 1962 and a New Sadler&#x27;s Wells Opera Company production first seen on 4 June 1984 at Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre, which was seen also in New York. Scottish Opera, Welsh National Opera and many of the other British opera companies have mounted productions, as did the reconstituted D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company between 1990 and its closure in 2003. In recent decades, the Carl Rosa Opera Company has produced &quot;Pinafore&quot; several times, including in 2009, Opera della Luna has toured it repeatedly, English National Opera presented it in 2021, it is regularly given by the National Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Opera Company, and other British companies continue to mount the piece.

The extraordinary initial success of &quot;Pinafore&quot; in America was seen first-hand by J. C. Williamson. He soon made arrangements with D&#x27;Oyly Carte to present the opera&#x27;s first authorised production in Australia, opening on 15 November 1879 at the Theatre Royal, Sydney. Thereafter, his opera company played frequent seasons of the work (and the subsequent Savoy operas) until at least 1963. In the U.S., the piece never lost popularity. The Internet Broadway Database links to a non-exhaustive list of 29 productions on Broadway alone. Among the professional repertory companies continuing to present &quot;Pinafore&quot; regularly in the U.S. are Opera a la Carte, based in California, Ohio Light Opera and the New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players, which tours the opera annually and often includes it in its New York seasons. &quot;Pinafore&quot; is still performed around the world by opera companies such as the Royal Theatre, Copenhagen; Australian Opera (and Essgee Entertainment and others in Australia); in Kassel, Germany; and even Samarkand, Uzbekistan.

The following table shows the history of the D&#x27;Oyly Carte productions (excluding tours) in Gilbert&#x27;s lifetime:

==Reception==

===Initial critical reception===
The early reviews were mostly favourable. &quot;The Era&quot; wrote:
&quot;The Era&quot; also lavishly praised Emma Howson as Josephine. &quot;The Entr&#x27;acte and Limelight&quot; commented that the opera was reminiscent of &quot;Trial by Jury&quot; and &quot;Sorcerer&quot; but found it diverting and called the music &quot;very charming. To hear so-called grand opera imitated through the medium of the most trifling lyrics, is funny&quot;. The paper praised Grossmith as Sir Joseph, noting with amusement that he was made up to look like portraits of Horatio Nelson, &quot;and his good introductory song seems levelled at&quot; W. H. Smith. It opined, further, that &quot;He Is an Englishman&quot; is &quot;an excellent satire on the proposition that a man must necessarily be virtuous to be English&quot;. It found the piece, as a whole, well presented and predicted that it would have a long run.
Similarly, &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; concluded that the production was a success and that the plot, though slight, served as a good vehicle for Gilbert&#x27;s &quot;caustic humour and quaint satire&quot;. It found that there was &quot;much to call forth hearty laughter in the occasional satirical hits. ... Dr. Sullivan&#x27;s music is as lively as the text to which it is set, with here and there a touch of sentimental expression ... The piece is well performed throughout.&quot; The &quot;Daily News&quot;, &quot;The Globe&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot; (which particularly praised Grossmith, Barrington and Everard) and &quot;The Standard&quot; concurred, the last commenting favourably on the chorus acting, which, it said, &quot;adds to the reality of the illusion&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; also noted that the piece was an early attempt at the establishment of a &quot;national musical stage&quot; with a libretto free from risqué French &quot;improprieties&quot; and without the &quot;aid&quot; of Italian and German musical models.

&quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and the &quot;Athenaeum&quot;, however, greeted the opera with only mixed praise. &quot;The Musical Times&quot; complained that the ongoing collaboration between Gilbert and Sullivan was &quot;detrimental to the art-progress of either&quot; because, although it was popular with audiences, &quot;something higher is demanded for what is understood as &#x27;comic opera&#x27;&quot;. The paper commented that Sullivan had &quot;the true elements of an artist, which would be successfully developed were a carefully framed libretto presented to him for composition&quot;. It concluded, however, by saying how much it enjoyed the opera: &quot;Having thus conscientiously discharged our duties as art-critics, let us at once proceed to say that &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; is an amusing piece of extravagance, and that the music floats it on merrily to the end&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; and several of the other papers agreed that, while the piece was entertaining, Sullivan was capable of higher art. Only &quot;The Figaro&quot; was actively hostile to the new piece. Upon the publication of the vocal score, a review by &quot;The Academy&quot; joined the chorus of regret that Sullivan had sunk so low as to compose music for &quot;Pinafore&quot; and hoped that he would turn to projects &quot;more worthy of his great ability&quot;. This criticism would follow Sullivan throughout his career.

The many unauthorised American productions of 1878–79 were of widely varying quality, and many of them were adaptations of the opera. One of the more &quot;authentic&quot; ones was the production by the Boston Ideal Opera Company, which was first formed to produce &quot;Pinafore&quot;. It engaged well-regarded concert singers and opened on 14 April 1879 at the 3,000-seat Boston Theatre. The critics agreed that the company fulfilled its goals of presenting an &quot;ideal&quot; production. The &quot;Boston Journal&quot; reported that the audience was &quot;wrought up by the entertainment to a point of absolute approval&quot;. The paper observed that it is a mistake to consider &quot;Pinafore&quot; a burlesque, &quot;for while irresistibly comical it is not &quot;bouffe&quot; and requires to be handled with great care lest its delicate proportions be marred and its subtle quality of humor be lost&quot;. The &quot;Journal&quot; described the opera as &quot;classical&quot; in method and wrote that its &quot;most exquisite satire&quot; lay in its &quot;imitation of the absurdities&quot; of grand opera. The company went on to become one of the most successful touring companies in America. The first children&#x27;s version in Boston became a sensation with both children and adult audiences, extending its run through the summer of 1879. The &quot;Boston Herald&quot; wrote that &quot;the large audience of children and their elders went fairly wild with delight ... shrieks of laughter were repeatedly heard&quot;.

===Subsequent reception===
When &quot;Pinafore&quot; was first revived in London in 1887, it was already treated as a classic. &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; observed that the opera had not been updated with new dialogue, jokes and songs, but concluded that this was for the best, as the public would have missed the &quot;time-honoured jokes, such as &#x27;Hardly Ever.&#x27; The Savoy has once more got a brilliant success.&quot; &quot;The Theatre&quot; concurred, stating that since the opera &quot;has been heard in almost every part of this habitable globe and been enjoyed everywhere, there is not much occasion to descant&quot;. It called the revival a &quot;most brilliant&quot; success and predicted another long run.
Reviewing the 1899 revival, &quot;The Athenaeum&quot; managed to praise the piece while joining in the musical establishment&#x27;s critique of Sullivan. On the one hand, &quot;The &quot;Pinafore&quot; ... sounds fresher than ever. The musical world has become serious – very serious – and it is indeed refreshing to hear a merry, humorous piece, and music, unassuming in character ... it is delicately scored, and in many ways displays ability of a high order&quot;. On the other hand, it wrote that if Sullivan had pursued the path of composing more serious music, like his symphony, &quot;he would have produced still higher results; in like manner &quot;Pinafore&quot; set us wondering what the composer would have accomplished with a libretto of somewhat similar kind, but one giving him larger scope for the exercise of his gifts&quot;.

In 1911, H. L. Mencken wrote: &quot;No other comic opera ever written – no other stage play, indeed, of any sort – was ever so popular. ... &quot;Pinafore&quot; ... has been given, and with great success, wherever there are theaters – from Moscow to Buenos Aires, from Cape Town to Shanghai; in Madrid, Ottawa and Melbourne; even in Paris, Rome, Vienna and Berlin.&quot; After the deaths of Gilbert and Sullivan, the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company retained exclusive rights to perform their operas in Great Britain until 1962, touring throughout Britain for most of the year and, beginning in 1919, often performing in London for a season of about four months. &quot;The Times&quot; gave the company&#x27;s 1920 London production an enthusiastic review, saying that the audience was &quot;enraptured&quot;, and regretting that &quot;Pinafore&quot; would be played for only two weeks. It praised the cast, singling out Leo Sheffield as the Captain, Henry Lytton as Sir Joseph, Elsie Griffin as Josephine, James Hay as Ralph, Bertha Lewis as Little Buttercup and the &quot;splendid&quot; choral tone. It concluded that the opera made a &quot;rollicking climax to the season&quot;. Two years later, it gave an even more glowing report of that season&#x27;s performances, calling Derek Oldham an &quot;ideal hero&quot; as Ralph, noting that Sydney Granville &quot;fairly brought down the house&quot; with his song, that Darrell Fancourt&#x27;s Deadeye was &quot;an admirably sustained piece of caricature&quot; and that it was a &quot;great pleasure&quot; to hear the returning principals. A 1961 review of the company&#x27;s &quot;Pinafore&quot; is much the same.

In 1879, J. C. Williamson acquired the exclusive performing rights to &quot;Pinafore&quot; in Australia and New Zealand. His first production earned public and critical acclaim. Williamson played Sir Joseph, and his wife, Maggie Moore played Josephine. Praising the production, Williamson, Moore and the other performers, the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; noted that the production, though &quot;abounding in fun&quot;, was dignified and precise, especially compared with a previous &quot;boisterous&quot; unauthorized production, and that many numbers were encored and the laughter and applause from the &quot;immense audience ... was liberally bestowed&quot;. Williamson&#x27;s company continued to produce &quot;Pinafore&quot; in Australia, New Zealand and on tour into the 1960s with much success. Williamson said, &quot;If you need money, then put on G&amp;S&quot;. Meanwhile, &quot;Pinafore&quot; continued to garner praise outside Britain. The 1950s Danish version in Copenhagen, for example, was revived repeatedly, playing for well over 100 performances to &quot;packed houses&quot;. Translations into German, Yiddish and many other languages, and professional productions in places as remote as Samarkand in Uzbekistan have been successful.

In the U.S., where Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s performance copyright was never in force, &quot;Pinafore&quot; continued to be produced continuously by both professional and amateur companies. &quot;The New York Times&quot;, in a 1914 review, called a large-scale production at the 6,000-seat New York Hippodrome a &quot;royal entertainment [that] comes up smiling&quot;. The opera had been turned into a &quot;mammoth spectacle&quot; with a chorus of hundreds and the famous Hippodrome tank providing a realistic harbour. Buttercup made her entrance by rowing over to the three-masted &quot;Pinafore&quot;, and Dick Deadeye was later thrown overboard with a real splash. The critic praised the hearty singing but noted that some subtlety is lost when the dialogue needs to be &quot;shouted&quot;. The production took some liberties, including interpolated music from other Sullivan works. The paper concluded, &quot;the mild satire of &quot;Pinafore&quot; is entertaining because it is universal&quot;. The same newspaper deemed Winthrop Ames&#x27; popular Broadway productions of &quot;Pinafore&quot; in the 1920s and 1930s &quot;spectacular&quot;. Modern productions in America continue to be generally well received. &quot;The New York Times&quot; review of the New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players&#x27; 2008 season at New York City Center commented, &quot;Gilbert&#x27;s themes of class inequality, overbearing nationalism and incompetent authorities remain relevant, however absurdly treated. But the lasting appeal of &quot;Pinafore&quot; and its ilk is more a matter of his unmatched linguistic genius and Sullivan&#x27;s generous supply of addictive melodies.&quot;

With the expiry of the copyrights, companies around the world have been free to produce Gilbert and Sullivan works and to adapt them as they please for almost 50 years. Productions of &quot;Pinafore&quot;, both amateur and professional, range from the traditional, in the D&#x27;Oyly Carte vein, to the broadly adapted, such as that of the very successful Essgee Entertainment (formed by Simon Gallaher) in Australia and Opera della Luna in Britain. Since its original production, &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; has remained one of Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s most popular comic operas. Productions continue in large numbers around the world. In 2003 alone, The D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company rented 224 sets of orchestra parts, mostly for productions of &quot;Pinafore&quot;, &quot;Pirates&quot; and &quot;Mikado&quot;. This does not take into account other rental companies and the theatre companies that borrow scores or have their own, or that use only one or two pianos instead of an orchestra. Hundreds of productions of &quot;Pinafore&quot; are presented every year worldwide.

==Analysis==
Theatre historian John Bush Jones wrote that &quot;Pinafore&quot; has &quot;everything a musical theatregoer could ask for. An engaging and even relatively suspenseful story is populated with varied and well-drawn characters who speak and sing witty, literate, and often outrageously funny dialogue and lyrics [and] has a score that ... has plenty of tunes for the audience to go away humming&quot;. George Power, the tenor who created the role of Ralph Rackstraw, opined in later life that the secret of the success of the Savoy operas is the way in which &quot;Sullivan entered into the spirit of Gilbert&#x27;s topsy-turvy humour, and was pompous when Gilbert was sprightly, or, when Gilbert&#x27;s satire was keenest and most acid, consciously wallowed in sentiment.&quot; Another commentator has suggested that the opera&#x27;s enduring success lies in its focus on &quot;mirth and silliness&quot;. Even the title of the piece is silly, applying the name of a little girl&#x27;s garment, a pinafore, to the fearsome symbol of a naval warship, which usually bore names like &quot;Victory&quot;, &quot;Goliath&quot;, &quot;Audacious&quot; and &quot;Minotaur&quot;.

===Satiric and comic themes===
Gilbert&#x27;s biographer Jane Stedman wrote that &quot;Pinafore&quot; is &quot;satirically far more complex&quot; than &quot;The Sorcerer&quot;. She commented that Gilbert uses several ideas and themes from his Bab Ballads, including the idea of gentlemanly behaviour of a captain towards his crew from &quot;Captain Reece&quot; (1868) and the exchange of ranks due to exchange at birth from &quot;General John&quot; (1867). Dick Deadeye, based on a character in &quot;Woman&#x27;s Gratitude&quot; (1869), represents another of Gilbert&#x27;s favorite (and semi-autobiographical) satiric themes: the misshapen misanthrope whose forbidding &quot;face and form&quot; makes him unpopular although he represents the voice of reason and common sense. Gilbert also borrows from his 1870 opera, &quot;The Gentleman in Black&quot; which includes the device of baby-switching.
Historian H. M. Walbrook wrote in 1921 that &quot;Pinafore&quot; &quot;satirizes the type of nautical drama of which Douglas Jerrold&#x27;s &quot;Black-Eyed Susan&quot; is a typical instance, and the &#x27;God&#x27;s Englishman&#x27; sort of patriotism which consists in shouting a platitude, striking an attitude, and doing little or nothing to help one&#x27;s country&quot;. G. K. Chesterton agreed that the satire is pointed at the selfishness of &quot;being proud of yourself for being a citizen&quot; of one&#x27;s country, which requires no virtuous effort of will to resist the &quot;temptations to belong to other nations&quot; but is merely an excuse for pride. In 2005, Australian opera director Stuart Maunder noted the juxtaposition of satire and nationalism in the opera, saying, &quot;they all sing &#x27;He is an Englishman&#x27;, and you know damn well they&#x27;re sending it up, but the music is so military ... that you can&#x27;t help but be swept up in that whole jingoism that is the British Empire.&quot; In addition, he argued that the song ties this theme into the main satire of class distinctions in the opera: &quot;&quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; is basically a satire on ... the British love of the class system. ... [O]f course [Ralph] can marry [the Captain&#x27;s] daughter, because he&#x27;s British, and therefore he&#x27;s great&#x27;&quot;. Jacobs notes that Gilbert is lampooning the tradition of nautical melodrama in which the sailor&#x27;s &quot;patriotism guarantees his virtue&quot;.

One of Gilbert&#x27;s favourite comic themes is the elevation of an unqualified person to a position of high responsibility. In &quot;The Happy Land&quot; (1873), for example, Gilbert describes a world in which government offices are awarded to the person who has the least qualification to hold each position. In particular, the one who has never heard of a ship is appointed to the cabinet post of First Lord of the Admiralty. In &quot;Pinafore&quot;, Gilbert revisits this theme in the character of Sir Joseph, who rises to the same position by &quot;never go[ing] to sea&quot;. In later Gilbert and Sullivan operas, the characters Major-General Stanley in &quot;Pirates&quot;, and Ko-Ko in &quot;The Mikado&quot;, are similarly appointed to high office though lacking the necessary qualifications. Gilbert also pokes fun at party politics, implying that when Sir Joseph &quot;always voted at [his] party&#x27;s call&quot;, he sacrificed his personal integrity. The &quot;commercial middle class&quot; (which was Gilbert&#x27;s main audience) is treated as satirically as are social climbers and the great unwashed. In addition, the apparent age difference between Ralph and the Captain, even though they were babies nursed together, satirises the variable age of Thaddeus in &quot;The Bohemian Girl&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; wrote, in reviewing the 1929 production, that &quot;Pinafore&quot; was quintessentially Gilbertian in that the absurdities of a &quot;paternal&quot; Captain and the &quot;ethics ... of all romanticism&quot; are accepted &quot;unflinchingly&quot; and taken to their logical conclusion: &quot;It is the reference to actuality that is essential; without it, the absurdity will not stand starkly out&quot;.
A theme that pervades the opera is the treatment of love across different social ranks. In the previous Gilbert and Sullivan opera, &quot;The Sorcerer&quot;, a love potion causes trouble by inducing the villagers and wedding guests to fall in love with people of different social classes. In &quot;Pinafore&quot;, the captain&#x27;s daughter, Josephine, loves and is loved by a common sailor, but she dutifully tells him, &quot;your proffered love I haughtily reject&quot;. He expresses his devotion to her in a poetic and moving speech that ends with &quot;I am a British sailor, and I love you&quot;. It finally turns out that he is of a higher rank than she. This is a parody of the Victorian &quot;equality&quot; drama, such as Lord Lytton&#x27;s &quot;The Lady of Lyons&quot; (1838), where the heroine rejects a virtuous peasant who makes a similarly moving speech, ending with &quot;I am a peasant!&quot; It then turns out that he has become her social superior. Furthermore, in &quot;Pinafore&quot;, Sir Joseph assures Josephine that &quot;love levels all ranks&quot;. In Tom Taylor&#x27;s &quot;The Serf&quot;, the heroine again loves a worthy peasant who turns out to be of high rank, and she declares happily at the end that &quot;love levels all&quot;. In a satire of the libertarian traditions of nautical melodrama, Sir Joseph tells the crew of the Pinafore that they are &quot;any man&#x27;s equal&quot; (excepting his), and he writes a song for them that glorifies the British sailor. Conversely, he brings the proud captain down a notch by making him &quot;dance a hornpipe on the cabin table&quot;. Jones notes that the union between Ralph and Josephine &quot;becomes acceptable only through the absurd second-act revelation of Buttercup&#x27;s inadvertent switching of the infants&quot; and concludes that Gilbert is a &quot;conservative satirist [who] ultimately advocated preserving the status quo ... [and] set out to show [that] love definitely &quot;does not&quot; level all ranks&quot;.

There is a divide among Gilbert and Sullivan scholars as to whether Gilbert is, as Jones argues, a supporter of the status quo whose focus is merely to entertain or, on the other hand, predominantly to satirise and protest &quot;against the follies of his age&quot;. The Gilbert scholar Andrew Crowther posits that this disagreement arises from Gilbert&#x27;s &quot;techniques of inversion – with irony and topsyturvydom&quot;, which lead to &quot;the surface meaning of his writings&quot; being &quot;the opposite of their underlying meaning&quot;. Crowther argues that Gilbert desires to &quot;celebrate&quot; society&#x27;s norms while, at the same time, satirising these conventions. In &quot;Pinafore&quot;, which established many patterns for the later Savoy operas, Gilbert found a way to express his own conflict that &quot;also had tremendous appeal to the general public&quot;. He creates &quot;a highly intelligent parody of nautical melodrama ... [though] controlled by the conventions it mocks&quot;. While nautical melodrama exalts the common sailor, in &quot;Pinafore&quot; Gilbert makes the proponent of equality, Sir Joseph, a pompous and misguided member of the ruling class who, hypocritically, cannot apply the idea of equality to himself. The hero, Ralph, is convinced of his equality by Sir Joseph&#x27;s foolish pronouncements and declares his love for his Captain&#x27;s daughter, throwing over the accepted &quot;fabric of social order&quot;. At this point, Crowther suggests, the logic of Gilbert&#x27;s satiric argument should result in Ralph&#x27;s arrest. But to satisfy convention, Gilbert creates an obvious absurdity: the captain and Ralph were switched as babies. By an &quot;accident of birth&quot;, Ralph is suddenly an appropriate husband for Josephine, and both the social order and the desire for a romantic happy ending are satisfied at once. Crowther concludes, &quot;We have an opera which uses all the conventions of melodrama and ridicules them; but in the end it is difficult to see which has won out, the conventions or the ridicule.&quot; Thus, &quot;Pinafore&quot; found broadbased success by appealing to the intellectual theatregoer seeking satire, the middle-class theatre-goer looking for a comfortable confirmation of the &quot;existing social order&quot; and the working-class audience who saw a satisfying melodramatic victory for the common man.

===Songs and musical analysis===
According to musicologist Arthur Jacobs, Gilbert&#x27;s plot &quot;admirably sparked off Sullivan&#x27;s genius&quot;. Sullivan embraces the nautical setting; in &quot;We Sail the Ocean Blue&quot;, for example, he &quot;presents his twist on a traditional sea shanty&quot;. In the Captain&#x27;s opening song, &quot;I am the Captain of the Pinafore&quot;, he admits that his gentlemanliness &quot;never ... well, hardly ever&quot; gives way to swearing at his men, and although he has experience at sea, he &quot;hardly ever&quot; suffers from seasickness. Sullivan &quot;unerringly found the right musical setting for the key phrase &#x27;What never?&#x27; ... cunningly sharpened ... through the chromatic touch on the bassoon.&quot; Audrey Williamson argued that the music of &quot;Pinafore&quot; is quintessentially English and free of European influences throughout most of the score, from the &quot;glee&quot; for Ralph, the Boatswain and the Carpenter, to &quot;For He Is an Englishman&quot;.
The best-known songs from the opera include &quot;I&#x27;m called Little Buttercup&quot;, a waltz tune introducing the character, which Sullivan repeats in the entr&#x27;acte and in the Act II finale to imprint the melody on the mind of the audience; and &quot;A British tar&quot; (a glee for three men describing the ideal sailor), composed by Sir Joseph &quot;to encourage independent thought and action in the lower branches of the service, and to teach the principle that a British sailor is any man&#x27;s equal, excepting mine&quot;. Sullivan&#x27;s voicing advances the satiric lyric, which mocks the &quot;equality&quot; plays while underlining the hypocrisy of Sir Joseph. Another popular number is Sir Joseph&#x27;s song &quot;When I was a Lad&quot;, recounting the meteoric rise of his career, which bears similarities to that of W. H. Smith, the civilian news entrepreneur who had risen to the position of First Lord of the Admiralty in 1877.

In &quot;Pinafore&quot;, Sullivan exploits minor keys for comic effect, for instance in &quot;Kind Captain, I&#x27;ve important information&quot;. Further, he achieves a musical surprise when he uses the subdominant minor in &quot;Sorry her lot&quot;. The musicologist Gervase Hughes was impressed with the introduction to the opening chorus which includes &quot;a rousing nautical tune ... in a key of no nonsense, C major ... a modulation to the mediant minor, where to our surprise a plaintive oboe gives us the first verse of &quot;Sorry her lot&quot; in 2/4 [time]. After this closes on the local dominant B major the violins (still in 2/4) introduce us to Little Buttercup ... meeting her under these conditions one would hardly expect her to blossom out later as a queen of the waltz.&quot; He continues, &quot;the bassoon and basses ... assert vigorously who is the Captain of the Pinafore ... in the improbable key of A flat minor. ... Buttercup makes a last despairing attempt to make herself heard in D flat minor, but the others have never known that such an outlandish key existed. So in a flash they all go back to C major on a good old 6/4&quot;.

According to Jacobs, &quot;Ralph, Captain Corcoran, Sir Joseph and Josephine all live in their interactive music (particularly &#x27;Never mind the why and wherefore&#x27;), and almost as much musical resource is lavished on two characters parodied from opera or melodrama, Little Buttercup with &#x27;gypsy blood in her veins&#x27; and the heavy-treading Dick Deadeye.&quot; Jacobs also opined that the leading tone that begins &quot;Never mind the why and wherefore&quot; &quot;serves to emphasize the phrase like a Johann Strauss-ian grace-note&quot;. The Sullivan scholar David Russell Hulme noted Sullivan&#x27;s parody of operatic styles, &quot;particularly the Handelian recitatives and the elopement scene (evocative of so many nocturnal operatic conspiracies), but best of all is the travesty of the patriotic tune in &#x27;For he is an Englishman!&#x27;&quot; Buttercup&#x27;s Act II song, in which she reveals the dark secret of the baby-switching is preceded by a quote from Franz Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Erlkönig&quot; and also parodies the opera &quot;Il trovatore&quot;. Jacobs notes that Sullivan also adds his own humorous touches to the music by setting commonplace expressions in &quot;Donizettian recitative&quot;. But on the serious side, he enhances the moments of true emotional climax, as in Josephine&#x27;s Act II aria, and added musical interest to concerted numbers by &quot;subtly shifting the rhythms and bar groupings.&quot;

==Revisions and cut material==

===Ballad for Captain Corcoran, &quot;Reflect, my child&quot;===
During rehearsals for the original production, Gilbert added a ballad for Captain Corcoran in which he urged his daughter to forget the common sailor with whom she is in love, because &quot;at every step, he would commit solecisms that society would never pardon.&quot; The ballad was meant to be sung between No. 5 and No. 6 of the current score, but it was cut before opening night. The words survive in the libretto that was deposited with the Lord Chamberlain for licensing. Before 1999, all that was known to survive of Sullivan&#x27;s setting was a copy of the leader violin part.

In April 1999, Sullivan scholars Bruce I. Miller and Helga J. Perry announced that they had discovered a nearly complete orchestration – lacking only the second violin part – in a private collection of early band parts. These materials, with a conjectural reconstruction of the partially lost vocal lines and second violin part, were later published and professionally recorded. This piece has now been performed a number of times by amateur and professional companies, although it has not become a standard addition to the traditional scores or recordings.

===Dialogue for Cousin Hebe===

In the licensing copy of the libretto, Sir Joseph&#x27;s cousin Hebe had lines of dialogue in several scenes in Act II. In the scene that follows No. 14 (&quot;Things are seldom what they seem&quot;), she accompanied Sir Joseph onstage and echoed the First Lord&#x27;s dissatisfaction with Josephine. After several interruptions, Sir Joseph urged her to be quiet, eliciting the response &quot;Crushed again!&quot; Gilbert would later re-use this passage for Lady Jane in &quot;Patience&quot;. Hebe was also assigned several lines of dialogue after No. 18 (&quot;Carefully on tiptoe stealing&quot;) and again after No. 19 (&quot;Farewell, my own&quot;).

Late in rehearsals for the original production, Jessie Bond assumed the role of Hebe, replacing Mrs Howard Paul. Bond, who at this point in her career was known primarily as a concert singer and had little experience as an actress, did not feel capable of performing dialogue, and these passages were revised to cut Hebe&#x27;s dialogue. Hebe&#x27;s cut dialogue is occasionally restored in modern performances.

===Recitative preceding the Act II finale===
The dialogue preceding the Act II finale, starting with &quot;Here, take her sir, and mind you treat her kindly&quot;, was originally recitative. The music for this passage was printed in the first edition of the vocal score as No. 20a. Shortly after opening night, the recitative was dropped, and the lines thereafter were performed as spoken dialogue. In modern productions, the recitative is occasionally restored in place of the dialogue.

==Recordings==
There have been numerous recordings of &quot;Pinafore&quot; since 1907. Ian Bradley counted seventeen recordings of the opera available on CD in 2005.
The 1930 recording is notable for preserving the performances of the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company stars of the era. The 1960 D&#x27;Oyly Carte recording, which contains all the dialogue, has been repeatedly praised by reviewers. The 1994 Mackerras recording, featuring grand opera singers in the principal roles, is musically well regarded. The 2000 D&#x27;Oyly Carte recording also contains complete dialogue and the first recording of the &quot;lost&quot; ballad for Captain Corcoran, &quot;Reflect, my child&quot;, as a bonus track. A 1957 Danish-language recording of the opera is one of the few foreign-language professional recordings of Gilbert and Sullivan.

In 1939, &quot;Pinafore&quot; was chosen by NBC as one of the earliest operas ever broadcast on American television, but no recording is known to have been saved. The 1973 D&#x27;Oyly Carte video recording, directed by Michael Heyland, features the company&#x27;s staging of the period, but some reviewers find it dull. It is, however, one of only three video or film recordings of a Gilbert and Sullivan opera by the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company. In 1982, Brent Walker Productions produced &quot;Pinafore&quot; as part of its series of Gilbert and Sullivan television films. According to discographer Marc Shepherd, the &quot;Pinafore&quot; video &quot;is widely considered one of the worst&quot; in the series. More recent professional productions have been recorded on video by the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival.

==Adaptations==

&quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; has been adapted many times. W. S. Gilbert wrote a 1909 children&#x27;s book called &quot;The Pinafore Picture Book&quot;, illustrated by Alice Woodward, which retells the story of &quot;Pinafore&quot;, giving considerable backstory details not found in the libretto. Many other children&#x27;s books have since been written retelling the story of &quot;Pinafore&quot; or adapting characters or events from &quot;Pinafore&quot;.

Many musical theatre adaptations have been produced since the original opera. Notable examples include a 1945 Broadway musical adapted by George S. Kaufman, called &quot;Hollywood Pinafore&quot;, using Sullivan&#x27;s music. This was revived several times, including in London in 1998. Another 1945 Broadway musical adaptation, &quot;Memphis Bound&quot;, was written by Don Walker and starred Bill Robinson and an all-black cast. In 1940, the American Negro Light Opera Association produced the first of several productions set in the Caribbean Sea, &quot;Tropical Pinafore&quot;. An early Yiddish adaptation of &quot;Pinafore&quot;, called &quot;Der Shirtz&quot; (Yiddish for &quot;apron&quot;) was written by Miriam Walowit in 1949 for a Brooklyn Hadassah group; they toured the adaptation, and they recorded 12 of the songs. In the 1970s, Al Grand was inspired by this recording and urged the Gilbert and Sullivan Long Island Light Opera Company to perform these songs. He later translated the missing songs and dialogue, with Bob Tartell, and the show has been toured widely under the name &quot;Der Yiddisher Pinafore&quot;. The group have continued to produce this adaptation for over two decades, in which &quot;He is an Englishman&quot; becomes &quot;Er Iz a Guter Yid&quot; (&quot;He is a good Jew&quot;).

Essgee Entertainment produced an adapted version of &quot;Pinafore&quot; in 1997 in Australia and New Zealand that has been much revived. Another musical adaptation is &quot;Pinafore! (A Saucy, Sexy, Ship-Shape New Musical)&quot;, adapted by Mark Savage. It was first performed at the Celebration Theater in Los Angeles on 7 September 2001, directed by Savage, where it ran with great success for nine months. It then played in Chicago and New York in 2003. In this adaptation, only one character is female, and all but one of the male characters are gay. An original cast recording was issued in 2002 by Belva Records. &quot;Pinafore Swing&quot; is a musical with music arranged by Sarah Travis. It premiered at the Watermill Theatre in England in 2004 in a production directed by John Doyle. The adaptation, set in 1944, changes the characters into members of a band entertaining the sailors on a World War II troop ship in the Atlantic. The reduced-size acting cast also serve as the orchestra for the singing roles, and the music is infused with swing rhythms. Numerous productions in recent decades have been set to parody &quot;Star Trek&quot; or &quot;Star Wars&quot;. An adaptation titled &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore, or Dauntless Dick Deadeye&quot;, was produced in 2005 at the Regent&#x27;s Park Open Air Theatre; extensive additional Gilbert-style dialogue by Herbert Appleman makes &quot;raconteur&quot; Deadeye the central character. Ian Talbot directed, and Gary Wilmot starred as Deadeye, with Scarlett Strallen as Josephine, Desmond Barrit as Sir Joseph and Leslie Nichol as Buttercup. Both the production and Strallen were nominated for 2006 Olivier Awards.

==Cultural impact==
===Development of the modern musical===

Among its other influences on popular culture, &quot;Pinafore&quot; had perhaps its most profound influence on the development of musical theatre. According to theatre historian John Kenrick, &quot;Pinafore&quot; &quot;became an international sensation, reshaping the commercial theater in both England and the United States.&quot; The music writer Andrew Lamb notes, &quot;The success of &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; in 1879 established British comic opera alongside French opéra bouffe throughout the English-speaking world&quot;. The historian John Bush Jones opines that &quot;Pinafore&quot; and the other Savoy operas demonstrate that musical theatre &quot;can address contemporary social and political issues without sacrificing entertainment value&quot; and that &quot;Pinafore&quot; created the model for a new kind of musical theatre, the &quot;integrated&quot; musical, where &quot;book, lyrics, and music combined to form an integral whole&quot;. He adds that its &quot;unprecedented ... popularity fostered an American audience for musical theatre, while the show itself became a model for form, content, and even intention of ... musicals ever since, especially socially relevant musicals.&quot; Its popularity also led to the musical theatre adaptations of &quot;Pinafore&quot; described above, musicals in which the story line involves a production of &quot;Pinafore&quot; and other musicals that parody the opera or that use or adapt its music. The first such parody was a short-lived burlesque presented at the Opera Comique in 1882, called &quot;The Wreck of the Pinafore&quot; by William Horace Lingard and Luscombe Searelle; the opera&#x27;s characters are shipwrecked on a desert island. It was described by &quot;The Era&quot; as &quot;chiefly remarkable for its impudence&quot;.

===Literary and political references===

The opera&#x27;s popularity has led to the widespread parody and pastiche of its songs in comedy routines, literature and other media. Many comedians have used &quot;Pinafore&quot; songs for comic and satiric effect. For example, in his comedy album &quot;My Son, the Celebrity&quot;, Allan Sherman parodies &quot;When I Was a Lad&quot; from the point of view of a young man who goes to an Ivy League school and then rises to prominence in business. At the end of the song, he &quot;thanks old Yale&quot;, &quot;thanks the Lord&quot; and thanks his father, &quot;who is chairman of the board&quot;. Literary references to &quot;Pinafore&quot; songs include Harris&#x27;s attempt to sing &quot;When I Was a Lad&quot; in Jerome K. Jerome&#x27;s &quot;Three Men in a Boat&quot;. Another is found in the story &quot;Runaround&quot; from &quot;I, Robot&quot; by Isaac Asimov, where a robot sings part of &quot;I&#x27;m Called Little Buttercup&quot;. &quot;Pinafore&quot; and its songs have been performed by rock musicians such as Todd Rundgren, Taj Mahal and Michele Gray Rundgren, who performed &quot;Never Mind the Why and Wherefore&quot; on &quot;Night Music&quot; (&quot;Sunday Night&quot;) in 1989.

Political references include a 1996 satiric pastiche of &quot;When I Was a Lad&quot; aimed at Tony Blair by Virginia Bottomley, heritage secretary under John Major. Sporting references include a racehorse named &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;. &quot;Pinafore&quot; songs and images have been used extensively in advertising. According to Jones, &quot;&quot;Pinafore&quot; launched the first media blitz in the United States&quot; beginning in 1879, and recent ads include a television campaign for Terry&#x27;s Chocolate Orange featuring a pastiche of &quot;When I Was a Lad&quot;. &quot;Pinafore&quot;-themed merchandise includes trading cards that were created in the 1880s.

===Film and television references===
Songs from &quot;Pinafore&quot; have been used to give period flavor to such films as the 1981 historical film &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;, in which the protagonist, Harold Abrahams, and others from Cambridge University, sing &quot;He Is an Englishman&quot;. This song also features at the end of the 1983 BBC drama &quot;An Englishman Abroad&quot;. In the 2003 movie &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, the Darling family sings &quot;When I Was a Lad&quot;. In &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot; (1994), the famed lawman meets his future wife when he sees her playing in an early production of &quot;Pinafore&quot;. A 1953 biopic, &quot;The Story of Gilbert and Sullivan&quot;, uses music from &quot;Pinafore&quot;.

Characters also sing songs from &quot;Pinafore&quot; in such popular films as &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981) and &quot;Star Trek: Insurrection&quot; (1998), where Captain Picard and Lt. Commander Worf sing part of &quot;A British Tar&quot; to distract a malfunctioning Lt. Commander Data. &quot;The Good Shepherd&quot; (2006) depicts an all-male version of &quot;Pinafore&quot; at Yale University in 1939; Matt Damon&#x27;s character plays Little Buttercup, singing in falsetto. Judy Garland sings &quot;I Am the Monarch of the Sea&quot; in the 1963 film &quot;I Could Go On Singing&quot;. The soundtrack of the 1992 thriller &quot;The Hand that Rocks the Cradle&quot; prominently features songs and music from &quot;Pinafore&quot;, and the father and daughter characters sing &quot;I Am the Captain of the Pinafore&quot; together. The 1976 animated film by Ronald Searle called &quot;Dick Deadeye, or Duty Done&quot; is based on the character and songs from &quot;Pinafore&quot;. In the 1988 drama &quot;Permanent Record&quot;, a high school class performs &quot;Pinafore&quot;.

Television series that include substantial &quot;Pinafore&quot; references include &quot;The West Wing&quot;, for example in the 2000 episode &quot;And It&#x27;s Surely to Their Credit&quot;, where &quot;He Is an Englishman&quot; is used throughout and quoted (or paraphrased) in the episode&#x27;s title. Among other notable examples of the use of songs from &quot;Pinafore&quot; on television are several popular animated shows. In the &quot;Cape Feare&quot; episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, Bart stalls his would-be killer Sideshow Bob with a &quot;final request&quot; that Bob sing him the entire score of &quot;Pinafore&quot;. Similarly, the 1993 &quot;HMS Yakko&quot; episode of &quot;Animaniacs&quot; consists of pastiches of songs from &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; and &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;. In a &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode, &quot;The Thin White Line&quot; (2001), Stewie sings a pastiche of &quot;My Gallant Crew&quot;. Stewie also sings &quot;I Am the Monarch of the Sea&quot; (including the ladies&#x27; part, in falsetto) in &quot;Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story&quot;. A 1986 &quot;Mr. Belvedere&quot; episode, &quot;The Play&quot;, concerns a production of &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;, and several of the songs are performed. In 1955, NBC broadcast a variety special including a 20-minute compressed jazz version, &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore in Jazz&quot;, produced and directed by Max Liebman, starring Perry Como, Buddy Hackett, Kitty Kallen, Bill Hayes, Pat Carroll and Herb Shriner.

<doc id="47805" wikidata="Q612536" url="?curid=47805" title="Vector quantization">
<text>Vector quantization (VQ) is a classical quantization technique from signal processing that allows the modeling of probability density functions by the distribution of prototype vectors. Developed in the early 1980s by Robert M. Gray, it was originally used for data compression. It works by dividing a large set of points (vectors) into groups having approximately the same number of points closest to them. Each group is represented by its centroid point, as in k-means and some other clustering algorithms. In simpler terms, vector quantization chooses a set of points to represent a larger set of points.

The density matching property of vector quantization is powerful, especially for identifying the density of large and high-dimensional data. Since data points are represented by the index of their closest centroid, commonly occurring data have low error, and rare data high error. This is why VQ is suitable for lossy data compression. It can also be used for lossy data correction and density estimation.

Vector quantization is based on the competitive learning paradigm, so it is closely related to the self-organizing map model and to sparse coding models used in deep learning algorithms such as autoencoder.

== Training ==
The simplest training algorithm for vector quantization is:
# Pick a sample point at random
# Move the nearest quantization vector centroid towards this sample point, by a small fraction of the distance
# Repeat

A more sophisticated algorithm reduces the bias in the density matching estimation, and ensures that all points are used, by including an extra sensitivity parameter :
# Increase each centroid&#x27;s sensitivity formula_1 by a small amount
# Pick a sample point formula_2 at random
# For each quantization vector centroid formula_3, let formula_4 denote the distance of formula_2 and formula_3
# Find the centroid formula_3 for which formula_8 is the smallest
# Move formula_3 towards formula_2 by a small fraction of the distance
# Set formula_1 to zero
# Repeat

It is desirable to use a cooling schedule to produce convergence: see Simulated annealing. Another (simpler) method is LBG which is based on K-Means.

The algorithm can be iteratively updated with &#x27;live&#x27; data, rather than by picking random points from a data set, but this will introduce some bias if the data are temporally correlated over many samples.

== Applications ==

Vector quantization is used for lossy data compression, lossy data correction, pattern recognition, density estimation and clustering.

Lossy data correction, or prediction, is used to recover data missing from some dimensions. It is done by finding the nearest group with the data dimensions available, then predicting the result based on the values for the missing dimensions, assuming that they will have the same value as the group&#x27;s centroid.

For density estimation, the area/volume that is closer to a particular centroid than to any other is inversely proportional to the density (due to the density matching property of the algorithm).

=== Use in data compression ===

Vector quantization, also called &quot;block quantization&quot; or &quot;pattern matching quantization&quot; is often used in lossy data compression. It works by encoding values from a multidimensional vector space into a finite set of values from a discrete subspace of lower dimension. A lower-space vector requires less storage space, so the data is compressed. Due to the density matching property of vector quantization, the compressed data has errors that are inversely proportional to density.

The transformation is usually done by projection or by using a codebook. In some cases, a codebook can be also used to entropy code the discrete value in the same step, by generating a prefix coded variable-length encoded value as its output.

The set of discrete amplitude levels is quantized jointly rather than each sample being quantized separately. Consider a &quot;k&quot;-dimensional vector formula_12 of amplitude levels. It is compressed by choosing the nearest matching vector from a set of &quot;n&quot;-dimensional vectors formula_13, with &quot;n&quot; &lt; &quot;k&quot;.

All possible combinations of the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional vector formula_13 form the vector space to which all the quantized vectors belong.
Only the index of the codeword in the codebook is sent instead of the quantized values. This conserves space and achieves more compression.

Twin vector quantization (VQF) is part of the MPEG-4 standard dealing with time domain weighted interleaved vector quantization.

=== Video codecs based on vector quantization ===

* Bink video
* Cinepak
* Daala is transform-based but uses pyramid vector quantization on transformed coefficients
* Digital Video Interactive: Production-Level Video and Real-Time Video
* Indeo
* Microsoft Video 1
* QuickTime: Apple Video (RPZA) and Graphics Codec (SMC)
* Sorenson SVQ1 and SVQ3
* Smacker video
* VQA format, used in many games
The usage of video codecs based on vector quantization has declined significantly in favor of those based on motion compensated prediction combined with transform coding, e.g. those defined in MPEG standards, as the low decoding complexity of vector quantization has become less relevant.

=== Audio codecs based on vector quantization ===

* AMR-WB+
* CELP
* CELT (now part of Opus) is transform-based but uses pyramid vector quantization on transformed coefficients
* Codec 2
* DTS
* G.729
* iLBC
* Ogg Vorbis
* TwinVQ

=== Use in pattern recognition ===
VQ was also used in the eighties for speech and speaker recognition.
Recently it has also been used for efficient nearest neighbor search 

and on-line signature recognition. 
In pattern recognition applications, one codebook is constructed for each class (each class being a user in biometric applications) using acoustic vectors of this user. In the testing phase the quantization distortion of a testing signal is worked out with the whole set of codebooks obtained in the training phase. The codebook that provides the smallest vector quantization distortion indicates the identified user.

The main advantage of VQ in pattern recognition is its low computational burden when compared with other techniques such as dynamic time warping (DTW) and hidden Markov model (HMM). The main drawback when compared to DTW and HMM is that it does not take into account the temporal evolution of the signals (speech, signature, etc.) because all the vectors are mixed up. In order to overcome this problem a multi-section codebook approach has been proposed. The multi-section approach consists of modelling the signal with several sections (for instance, one codebook for the initial part, another one for the center and a last codebook for the ending part).

=== Use as clustering algorithm ===
As VQ is seeking for centroids as density points of nearby lying samples, it can be also directly used as a prototype-based clustering method: each centroid is then associated with one prototype. 
By aiming to minimize the expected squared quantization error and introducing a decreasing learning gain fulfilling the Robbins-Monro conditions, multiple iterations over the whole data set with a concrete but fixed number of prototypes converges to the solution of k-means clustering algorithm in an incremental manner.

=== Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) ===
VQ has been used to quantize a feature representation layer in the discriminator of Generative adversarial networks. The feature quantization (FQ) technique performs implicit feature matching. It improves the GAN training, and yields an improved performance on a variety of popular GAN models: BigGAN for image generation, StyleGAN for face synthesis, and U-GAT-IT for unsupervised image-to-image translation.
