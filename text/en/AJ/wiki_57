<text>A war crime is a violation of the laws of war that gives rise to individual criminal responsibility for actions by combatants in action, such as intentionally killing civilians or intentionally killing prisoners of war, torture, taking hostages, unnecessarily destroying civilian property, deception by perfidy, wartime sexual violence, pillaging, and for any individual that is part of the command structure who orders any attempt to committing mass killings including genocide or ethnic cleansing, the granting of no quarter despite surrender, the conscription of children in the military and flouting the legal distinctions of proportionality and military necessity.

The formal concept of war crimes emerged from the codification of the customary international law that applied to warfare between sovereign states, such as the Lieber Code (1863) of the Union Army in the American Civil War and the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 for international war. In the aftermath of the Second World War, the war-crime trials of the leaders of the Axis powers established the Nuremberg principles of law, such as that international criminal law defines what is a war crime. In 1949, the Geneva Conventions legally defined new war crimes and established that states could exercise universal jurisdiction over war criminals. In the late 20th century and early 21st century, international courts extrapolated and defined additional categories of war crimes applicable to a civil war.

==History==

===Early examples===
In 1474, the first trial for a war crime was that of Peter von Hagenbach, realised by an ad hoc tribunal of the Holy Roman Empire, for his command responsibility for the actions of his soldiers, because &quot;he, as a knight, was deemed to have a duty to prevent&quot; criminal behaviour by a military force. Despite having argued that he had obeyed superior orders, von Hagenbach was convicted, condemned to death, and beheaded.

===Hague Conventions===
The Hague Conventions were international treaties negotiated at the First and Second Peace Conferences at The Hague, Netherlands, in 1899 and 1907, respectively, and were, along with the Geneva Conventions, among the first formal statements of the laws of war and war crimes in the nascent body of secular international law.

===Lieber Code===
The Lieber Code was written early in the American Civil War and President Abraham Lincoln issued as General Order 100 on April 24, 1863, just months after the military executions at Mankato, Minnesota. General Order 100, &quot;Instructions for the Government of the Armies of the United States in the Field&quot; (Lieber Code) was written by Franz Lieber, a German lawyer, political philosopher, and veteran of the Napoleonic Wars. Lincoln made the Code military law for all wartime conduct of the Union Army. It defined command responsibility for war crimes and crimes against humanity as well as stated the military responsibilities of the Union soldier fighting the Confederate States of America.

===Geneva Conventions===
The Geneva Conventions are four related treaties adopted and continuously expanded from 1864 to 1949 that represent a legal basis and framework for the conduct of war under international law. Every single member state of the United Nations has currently ratified the conventions, which are universally accepted as customary international law, applicable to every situation of armed conflict in the world. The Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions adopted in 1977 containing the most pertinent, detailed and comprehensive protections of international humanitarian law for persons and objects in modern warfare are still not ratified by several states continuously engaged in armed conflicts, namely the United States, Israel, India, Pakistan, Iraq, Iran, and others. Accordingly, states retain different codes and values about wartime conduct. Some signatories have routinely violated the Geneva Conventions in a way that either uses the ambiguities of law or political maneuvering to sidestep the laws&#x27; formalities and principles.

The first three conventions have been revised and expanded, with the fourth one added in 1949:
* The First Geneva Convention &quot;for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field&quot; was adopted in 1864 and then significantly revised and replaced by the 1906 version, the 1929 version, and later the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949.
* The Second Geneva Convention &quot;for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea&quot; was adopted in 1906 and then significantly revised and replaced by the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949.
* The Third Geneva Convention &quot;relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War&quot; was adopted in 1929 and then significantly revised and replaced by the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949.
* The Fourth Geneva Convention &quot;relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War&quot; was first adopted in 1949, based on parts of the 1907 Hague Convention IV.

Two Additional Protocols were adopted in 1977 with the third one added in 2005, completing and updating the Geneva Conventions:
* Protocol I (1977) &quot;relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts.&quot;
* Protocol II (1977) &quot;relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts.&quot;
* Protocol III (2005) &quot;relating to the Adoption of an Additional Distinctive Emblem.&quot;

===Leipzig trials===

Just after WWI, world governments started to try and systematically create a code for how war crimes would be defined. Their first outline of a law was &quot;Instructions for the Government of Armies of the United States in the Field&quot;—also known as the &quot;Lieber Code.&quot; A small number of German military personnel of the First World War were tried in 1921 by the German Supreme Court for alleged war crimes.

=== London Charter/Nuremberg trials 1945 ===

The modern concept of war crime was further developed under the auspices of the Nuremberg trials based on the definition in the London Charter that was published on August 8, 1945 (see Nuremberg principles). Along with war crimes the charter also defined crimes against peace and crimes against humanity, which are often committed during wars and in concert with war crimes.

=== International Military Tribunal for the Far East 1946 ===
Also known as the Tokyo Trial, the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal or simply as the Tribunal, it was convened on May 3, 1946, to try the leaders of the Empire of Japan for three types of crimes: &quot;Class A&quot; (crimes against peace), &quot;Class B&quot; (war crimes), and &quot;Class C&quot; (crimes against humanity), committed during World War II.

=== Formation of the International Criminal Court ===

On July 1, 2002, the International Criminal Court (ICC), a treaty-based court located in The Hague, came into being for the prosecution of war crimes committed on or after that date. Several nations, most notably the United States, China, Russia, and Israel, have criticized the court. The United States still participates as an observer. Article 12 of the Rome Statute provides jurisdiction over the citizens of non-contracting states if they are accused of committing crimes in the territory of one of the state parties.

The ICC only has jurisdiction over these crimes when they are &quot;part of a plan or policy or as part of a large-scale commission of such crimes&quot;.

==Prominent indictees==
===Heads of state and government===
To date, the present and former heads of state and heads of government that have been charged with war crimes include:
* Russian President Vladimir Putin, for his contribution in the illegal abduction of children from Ukraine and deportation into Russia during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. 
* Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been accused of war crimes in the Israel-Hamas War including starvation. Both he and his former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant have been said to use “starvation as a method of warfare.” Netanyahu responded that “there is nothing more than just war the Israel has been waging in Gaza.” The ICC also issued a warrant for Mohammed Deif, the head of Hamas’ armed wing for the October 7th Attacks on Israel for murder, rape, torture, and for taking hostages. The warrants were issued unanimously. 
* German Großadmiral and President Karl Dönitz and Japanese Prime Ministers and Generals Hideki Tōjō and Kuniaki Koiso in the aftermath of World War II.
* Former Serbian President Slobodan Milošević was brought to trial charged with genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes in three republics. This pertained to superior command responsibility for the Bosnia and Croatia indictments, and individual responsibility for the Kosovo indictment. His legal motion to be acquitted was denied in 2004, and he died in custody in 2006, before the trial ended.
* Former Liberian President Charles G. Taylor was also brought to The Hague charged with war crimes; his trial stretched from 2007 to March 2011. He was convicted in April 2012 of aiding and abetting crimes against humanity.
* Former Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadžić was arrested in Belgrade on July 18, 2008, and brought before Belgrade&#x27;s War Crimes Court a few days later. He was extradited to the Netherlands, and is currently in The Hague, in the custody of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. The trial began in 2010. On March 24, 2016, he was found guilty of genocide in Srebrenica, war crimes and crimes against humanity, 10 of the 11 charges in total, and sentenced to 40 years&#x27; imprisonment. He was sentenced to life on appeal.
* Omar al-Bashir, former head of state of Sudan, is charged with three counts of genocide, crimes against humanity and other war crimes regarding the war in the Darfur region of Sudan.
* Former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi was indicted for allegedly ordering the killings of protesters and civilians and crimes against humanity, during the 2011 Libyan civil war, and was killed in October 2011 before he could stand trial.
* Former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori was charged with several counts of human rights violations committed by his government and affiliated death squads during his regime.

==Definition==

War crimes are serious violations of the rules of customary and treaty law concerning international humanitarian law, criminal offenses for which there is individual responsibility.

Colloquial definitions of &quot;war crime&quot; include violations of established protections of the &quot;laws of war&quot;, but also include failures to adhere to norms of procedure and rules of battle, such as attacking those displaying a peaceful flag of truce, or using that same flag as a ruse to mount an attack on enemy troops. The use of chemical and biological weapons in warfare are also prohibited by numerous chemical arms control agreements and the Biological Weapons Convention. Wearing enemy uniforms or civilian clothes to infiltrate enemy lines for espionage or sabotage missions is a legitimate ruse of war, though fighting in combat or assassinating individuals behind enemy lines while so disguised is not, as it constitutes unlawful perfidy. Attacking enemy troops while they are being deployed by way of a parachute is not a war crime. Protocol I, Article 42 of the Geneva Conventions explicitly forbids attacking parachutists who eject from disabled aircraft and surrendering parachutists once landed. Article 30 of the 1907 Hague Convention &quot;IV – The Laws and Customs of War on Land&quot; explicitly forbids belligerents to punish enemy spies without previous trial.

The rule of war, also known as the Law of Armed Conflict, permits belligerents to engage in combat. A war crime occurs when superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering is inflicted upon an enemy.

War crimes also include such acts as mistreatment of prisoners of war or civilians. War crimes are sometimes part of instances of mass murder and genocide though these crimes are more broadly covered under international humanitarian law described as crimes against humanity. In 2008, the U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution 1820, which noted that &quot;rape and other forms of sexual violence can constitute war crimes, crimes against humanity or a constitutive act with respect to genocide&quot;; see also wartime sexual violence. In 2016, the International Criminal Court convicted someone of sexual violence for the first time; specifically, they added rape to a war crimes conviction of Congo Vice President Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo.

War crimes also included deliberate attacks on citizens and property of neutral states, such as the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. As the attack on Pearl Harbor happened while the U.S. and Japan were at peace and without a just cause for self-defense, the attack was declared by the Tokyo Trials to go beyond justification of military necessity and therefore constituted a war crime.

War crimes are significant in international humanitarian law because it is an area where international tribunals such as the Nuremberg Trials and Tokyo Trials have been convened. Recent examples are the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, which were established by the UN Security Council acting under Chapter VIII of the UN Charter.

Under the Nuremberg Principles, &quot;war crimes&quot; are different from crimes against peace. Crimes against peace include planning, preparing, initiating, or waging a war of aggression, or a war in violation of international treaties, agreements, or assurances. Because the definition of a state of &quot;war&quot; may be debated, the term &quot;war crime&quot; itself has seen different usage under different systems of international and military law. It has some degree of application outside of what some may consider being a state of &quot;war&quot;, but in areas where conflicts persist enough to constitute social instability.

The legalities of war have sometimes been accused of containing favoritism toward the winners (&quot;Victor&#x27;s justice&quot;), as some controversies have not been ruled as war crimes. Some examples include the Allies&#x27; destruction of Axis cities during World War II, such as the firebombing of Dresden, the &quot;Operation Meetinghouse&quot; raid on Tokyo (the most destructive single bombing raid in history), and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In regard to the strategic bombing during World War II, there was no international treaty or instrument protecting a civilian population specifically from attack by aircraft, therefore the aerial attacks on civilians were not officially war crimes. The Allies at the trials in Nuremberg and Tokyo never prosecuted the Germans, including Luftwaffe commander-in-chief Hermann Göring, for the bombing raids on Warsaw, Rotterdam, and British cities during the Blitz as well as the indiscriminate attacks on Allied cities with V-1 flying bombs and V-2 rockets, nor the Japanese for the aerial attacks on crowded Chinese cities.

Controversy arose when the Allies re-designated German POWs (under the protection of the 1929 Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War) as Disarmed Enemy Forces (allegedly unprotected by the 1929 Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War), many of which were then used for forced labor such as clearing minefields. By December 1945, six months after the war had ended, it was estimated by French authorities that 2,000 German prisoners were still being killed or maimed each month in mine-clearing accidents. The wording of the 1949 Third Geneva Convention was intentionally altered from that of the 1929 convention so that soldiers who &quot;fall into the power&quot; following surrender or mass capitulation of an enemy are now protected as well as those taken prisoner in the course of fighting.

=== United Nations ===
The United Nations defines war crimes as described in Article 8 of the Rome statute, the treaty that established the International Criminal Court:
# Grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, namely, any of the following acts against persons or property protected under the provisions of the relevant Geneva Convention:
# Other serious violations of the laws and customs applicable in international armed conflict, within the established framework of international law...
# In the case of an armed conflict not of an international character, serious violations of article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949...
# Other serious violations of the laws and customs applicable in armed conflicts not of an international character, within the established framework of international law...
== Legality of civilian casualties ==
Under the law of armed conflict (LOAC), the death of non-combatants is not necessarily a violation; there are many things to take into account. Civilians &quot;cannot&quot; be made the object of an attack, but the death/injury of civilians while conducting an attack on a military objective are governed under principles such as of proportionality and military necessity and can be permissible. Military necessity &quot;permits the destruction of life of ... persons whose destruction is incidentally unavoidable by the armed conflicts of the war; ... it does not permit the killing of innocent inhabitants for purposes of revenge or the satisfaction of a lust to kill. The destruction of property to be lawful must be imperatively demanded by the necessities of war.&quot;

For example, conducting an operation on an ammunition depot or a terrorist training camp would not be prohibited because a farmer is plowing a field in the area; the farmer is not the object of attack and the operations would adhere to proportionality and military necessity. On the other hand, an extraordinary military advantage would be necessary to justify an operation posing risks of collateral death or injury to thousands of civilians. In &quot;grayer&quot; cases the legal question of whether the expected incidental harm is excessive may be very subjective. For this reason, States have chosen to apply a &quot;clearly excessive&quot; standard for determining whether a criminal violation has occurred.

When there is no justification for military action, such as civilians being made the object of attack, a proportionality analysis is unnecessary to conclude that the attack is unlawful.

=== International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ===
For aerial strikes, pilots generally have to rely on information supplied by external sources (headquarters, ground troops) that a specific position is in fact a military target. In the case of former Yugoslavia, NATO pilots hit a civilian object (the Chinese embassy in Belgrade) that was of no military significance, but the pilots had no idea of determining it aside from their orders. The committee ruled that &quot;the aircrew involved in the attack should not be assigned any responsibility for the fact they were given the wrong target and that it is inappropriate to attempt to assign criminal responsibility for the incident to senior leaders because they were provided with wrong information by officials of another agency&quot;. The report also notes that &quot;Much of the material submitted to the OTP consisted of reports that civilians had been killed, often inviting the conclusion to be drawn that crimes had therefore been committed. Collateral casualties to civilians and collateral damage to civilian objects can occur for a variety of reasons.&quot;

=== Rendulic Rule ===
The Rendulic Rule is a standard by which commanders are judged.

German General Lothar Rendulic was charged for ordering extensive destruction of civilian buildings and lands while retreating from a suspected enemy attack in what is called scorched earth policy for the military purpose of denying the use of ground for the enemy. The German troops retreating from Finnish Lapland believed Finland would be occupied by Soviet troops and destroyed many settlements while retreating to Norway under the command of Rendulic. He overestimated the perceived risk but argued that Hague IV authorized the destruction because it was necessary to war. He was acquitted of that charge.

Under the &quot;Rendulic Rule&quot; persons must assess the military necessity of an action based on the information available to them at that time; they cannot be judged based on information that subsequently comes to light.

<text>In number theory, a Gaussian integer is a complex number whose real and imaginary parts are both integers. The Gaussian integers, with ordinary addition and multiplication of complex numbers, form an integral domain, usually written as formula_1 or formula_2 

Gaussian integers share many properties with integers: they form a Euclidean domain, and thus have a Euclidean division and a Euclidean algorithm; this implies unique factorization and many related properties. However, Gaussian integers do not have a total ordering that respects arithmetic. 

Gaussian integers are algebraic integers and form the simplest ring of quadratic integers.

Gaussian integers are named after the German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss.

==Basic definitions==
The Gaussian integers are the set
:formula_3

In other words, a Gaussian integer is a complex number such that its real and imaginary parts are both integers.
Since the Gaussian integers are closed under addition and multiplication, they form a commutative ring, which is a subring of the field of complex numbers. It is thus an integral domain.

When considered within the complex plane, the Gaussian integers constitute the -dimensional integer lattice.

The &quot;conjugate&quot; of a Gaussian integer is the Gaussian integer .

The &quot;norm&quot; of a Gaussian integer is its product with its conjugate.
:formula_4

The norm of a Gaussian integer is thus the square of its absolute value as a complex number. The norm of a Gaussian integer is a nonnegative integer, which is a sum of two squares. Thus a norm cannot be of the form , with integer.

The norm is multiplicative, that is, one has
:formula_5
for every pair of Gaussian integers . This can be shown directly, or by using the multiplicative property of the modulus of complex numbers.

The units of the ring of Gaussian integers (that is the Gaussian integers whose multiplicative inverse is also a Gaussian integer) are precisely the Gaussian integers with norm 1, that is, 1, –1, and .

==Euclidean division==
Gaussian integers have a Euclidean division (division with remainder) similar to that of integers and polynomials. This makes the Gaussian integers a Euclidean domain, and implies that Gaussian integers share with integers and polynomials many important properties such as the existence of a Euclidean algorithm for computing greatest common divisors, Bézout&#x27;s identity, the principal ideal property, Euclid&#x27;s lemma, the unique factorization theorem, and the Chinese remainder theorem, all of which can be proved using only Euclidean division.

A Euclidean division algorithm takes, in the ring of Gaussian integers, a dividend and divisor , and produces a quotient and remainder such that
:formula_6
In fact, one may make the remainder smaller:
:formula_7
Even with this better inequality, the quotient and the remainder are not necessarily unique, but one may refine the choice to ensure uniqueness.

To prove this, one may consider the complex number quotient . There are unique integers and such that and , and thus . Taking , one has
:formula_8
with
:formula_9
and
:formula_10
The choice of and in a semi-open interval is required for uniqueness.
This definition of Euclidean division may be interpreted geometrically in the complex plane (see the figure), by remarking that the distance from a complex number to the closest Gaussian integer is at most .

==Principal ideals==
Since the ring of Gaussian integers is a Euclidean domain, is a principal ideal domain, which means that every ideal of is principal. Explicitly, an ideal is a subset of a ring such that every sum of elements of and every product of an element of by an element of belong to . An ideal is principal if it consists of all multiples of a single element , that is, it has the form
:formula_11
In this case, one says that the ideal is &quot;generated&quot; by or that is a &quot;generator&quot; of the ideal.

Every ideal in the ring of the Gaussian integers is principal, because, if one chooses in a nonzero element of minimal norm, for every element of , the remainder of Euclidean division of by belongs also to and has a norm that is smaller than that of ; because of the choice of , this norm is zero, and thus the remainder is also zero. That is, one has , where is the quotient.

For any , the ideal generated by is also generated by any &quot;associate&quot; of , that is, ; no other element generates the same ideal. As all the generators of an ideal have the same norm, the &quot;norm of an ideal&quot; is the norm of any of its generators.

In some circumstances, it is useful to choose, once for all, a generator for each ideal. There are two classical ways for doing that, both considering first the ideals of odd norm. If the has an odd norm , then one of and is odd, and the other is even. Thus has exactly one associate with a real part that is odd and positive. In his original paper, Gauss made another choice, by choosing the unique associate such that the remainder of its division by is one. In fact, as , the norm of the remainder is not greater than 4. As this norm is odd, and 3 is not the norm of a Gaussian integer, the norm of the remainder is one, that is, the remainder is a unit. Multiplying by the inverse of this unit, one finds an associate that has one as a remainder, when divided by .

If the norm of is even, then either or , where is a positive integer, and is odd. Thus, one chooses the associate of for getting a which fits the choice of the associates for elements of odd norm.

==Gaussian primes==
As the Gaussian integers form a principal ideal domain, they also form a unique factorization domain. This implies that a Gaussian integer is irreducible (that is, it is not the product of two non-units) if and only if it is prime (that is, it generates a prime ideal).

The prime elements of are also known as Gaussian primes. An associate of a Gaussian prime is also a Gaussian prime. The conjugate of a Gaussian prime is also a Gaussian prime (this implies that Gaussian primes are symmetric about the real and imaginary axes).

A positive integer is a Gaussian prime if and only if it is a prime number that is congruent to 3 modulo 4 (that is, it may be written , with a nonnegative integer) . The other prime numbers are not Gaussian primes, but each is the product of two conjugate Gaussian primes.

A Gaussian integer is a Gaussian prime if and only if either:
*one of is zero and the absolute value of the other is a prime number of the form (with a nonnegative integer), or
*both are nonzero and is a prime number (which will &quot;not&quot; be of the form ).

In other words, a Gaussian integer is a Gaussian prime if and only if either its norm is a prime number, or is the product of a unit () and a prime number of the form .

It follows that there are three cases for the factorization of a prime natural number in the Gaussian integers:
*If is congruent to 3 modulo 4, then it is a Gaussian prime; in the language of algebraic number theory, is said to be inert in the Gaussian integers.
*If is congruent to 1 modulo 4, then it is the product of a Gaussian prime by its conjugate, both of which are non-associated Gaussian primes (neither is the product of the other by a unit); is said to be a decomposed prime in the Gaussian integers. For example, and .
*If , we have ; that is, 2 is the product of the square of a Gaussian prime by a unit; it is the unique ramified prime in the Gaussian integers.

==Unique factorization==
As for every unique factorization domain, every Gaussian integer may be factored as a product of a unit and Gaussian primes, and this factorization is unique up to the order of the factors, and the replacement of any prime by any of its associates (together with a corresponding change of the unit factor).

If one chooses, once for all, a fixed Gaussian prime for each equivalence class of associated primes, and if one takes only these selected primes in the factorization, then one obtains a prime factorization which is unique up to the order of the factors. With the choices described above, the resulting unique factorization has the form
:formula_12
where is a unit (that is, ), and are nonnegative integers, are positive integers, and are distinct Gaussian primes such that, depending on the choice of selected associates,
*either with odd and positive, and even,
*or the remainder of the Euclidean division of by equals 1 (this is Gauss&#x27;s original choice).
An advantage of the second choice is that the selected associates behave well under products for Gaussian integers of odd norm. On the other hand, the selected associate for the real Gaussian primes are negative integers. For example, the factorization of 231 in the integers, and with the first choice of associates is , while it is with the second choice.

==Gaussian rationals==
The field of Gaussian rationals is the field of fractions of the ring of Gaussian integers. It consists of the complex numbers whose real and imaginary part are both rational.

The ring of Gaussian integers is the integral closure of the integers in the Gaussian rationals.

This implies that Gaussian integers are quadratic integers and that a Gaussian rational is a Gaussian integer, if and only if it is a solution of an equation
:formula_13
with and integers. In fact is solution of the equation
:formula_14
and this equation has integer coefficients if and only if and are both integers.

==Greatest common divisor==
As for any unique factorization domain, a &quot;greatest common divisor (gcd)&quot; of two Gaussian integers is a Gaussian integer that is a common divisor of and , which has all common divisors of and as divisor. That is (where denotes the divisibility relation),

* and , and
* and implies .
Thus, &quot;greatest&quot; is meant relatively to the divisibility relation, and not for an ordering of the ring (for integers, both meanings of &quot;greatest&quot; coincide).

More technically, a greatest common divisor of and is a generator of the ideal generated by and (this characterization is valid for principal ideal domains, but not, in general, for unique factorization domains).

The greatest common divisor of two Gaussian integers is not unique, but is defined up to the multiplication by a unit. That is, given a greatest common divisor of and , the greatest common divisors of and are , and .

There are several ways for computing a greatest common divisor of two Gaussian integers and . When one knows the prime factorizations of and ,
:formula_15
where the primes are pairwise non associated, and the exponents non-associated, a greatest common divisor is
:formula_16
with
:formula_17

Unfortunately, except in simple cases, the prime factorization is difficult to compute, and Euclidean algorithm leads to a much easier (and faster) computation. This algorithm consists of replacing of the input by , where is the remainder of the Euclidean division of by , and repeating this operation until getting a zero remainder, that is a pair . This process terminates, because, at each step, the norm of the second Gaussian integer decreases. The resulting is a greatest common divisor, because (at each step) and have the same divisors as and , and thus the same greatest common divisor.

This method of computation works always, but is not as simple as for integers because Euclidean division is more complicated. Therefore, a third method is often preferred for hand-written computations. It consists in remarking that the norm of the greatest common divisor of and is a common divisor of , , and . When the greatest common divisor of these three integers has few factors, then it is easy to test, for common divisor, all Gaussian integers with a norm dividing .

For example, if , and , one has , , and . As the greatest common divisor of the three norms is 2, the greatest common divisor of and has 1 or 2 as a norm. As a gaussian integer of norm 2 is necessary associated to , and as divides and , then the greatest common divisor is .

If is replaced by its conjugate , then the greatest common divisor of the three norms is 34, the norm of , thus one may guess that the greatest common divisor is , that is, that . In fact, one has .

==Congruences and residue classes==
Given a Gaussian integer , called a &quot;modulus&quot;, two Gaussian integers are &quot;congruent modulo&quot; , if their difference is a multiple of , that is if there exists a Gaussian integer such that . In other words, two Gaussian integers are congruent modulo , if their difference belongs to the ideal generated by . This is denoted as .

The congruence modulo is an equivalence relation (also called a congruence relation), which defines a partition of the Gaussian integers into equivalence classes, called here congruence classes or &quot;residue classes&quot;. The set of the residue classes is usually denoted , or , or simply .

The residue class of a Gaussian integer is the set
:formula_18
of all Gaussian integers that are congruent to . It follows that if and only if .

Addition and multiplication are compatible with congruences. This means that and imply and .
This defines well-defined operations (that is independent of the choice of representatives) on the residue classes:
:formula_19
With these operations, the residue classes form a commutative ring, the quotient ring of the Gaussian integers by the ideal generated by , which is also traditionally called the &quot;residue class ring modulo&quot;  (for more details, see Quotient ring).

===Examples===

*There are exactly two residue classes for the modulus , namely (all multiples of ), and , which form a checkerboard pattern in the complex plane. These two classes form thus a ring with two elements, which is, in fact, a field, the unique (up to an isomorphism) field with two elements, and may thus be identified with the integers modulo 2. These two classes may be considered as a generalization of the partition of integers into even and odd integers. Thus one may speak of &quot;even&quot; and &quot;odd&quot; Gaussian integers (Gauss divided further even Gaussian integers into &quot;even&quot;, that is divisible by 2, and &quot;half-even&quot;).
*For the modulus 2 there are four residue classes, namely . These form a ring with four elements, in which for every . Thus this ring is not isomorphic with the ring of integers modulo 4, another ring with four elements. One has , and thus this ring is not the finite field with four elements, nor the direct product of two copies of the ring of integers modulo 2.
*For the modulus there are eight residue classes, namely , whereof four contain only even Gaussian integers and four contain only odd Gaussian integers.

===Describing residue classes===
Given a modulus , all elements of a residue class have the same remainder for the Euclidean division by , provided one uses the division with unique quotient and remainder, which is described above. Thus enumerating the residue classes is equivalent with enumerating the possible remainders. This can be done geometrically in the following way.

In the complex plane, one may consider a square grid, whose squares are delimited by the two lines
:formula_20

with and integers (blue lines in the figure). These divide the plane in semi-open squares (where and are integers)
:formula_21

The semi-open intervals that occur in the definition of have been chosen in order that every complex number belong to exactly one square; that is, the squares form a partition of the complex plane. One has
:formula_22

This implies that every Gaussian integer is congruent modulo to a unique Gaussian integer in (the green square in the figure), which its remainder for the division by . In other words, every residue class contains exactly one element in .

The Gaussian integers in (or in its boundary) are sometimes called &quot;minimal residues&quot; because their norm are not greater than the norm of any other Gaussian integer in the same residue class (Gauss called them &quot;absolutely smallest residues&quot;).

From this one can deduce by geometrical considerations, that the number of residue classes modulo a Gaussian integer equals its norm (see below for a proof; similarly, for integers, the number of residue classes modulo is its absolute value ).

===Residue class fields===
The residue class ring modulo a Gaussian integer is a field if and only if formula_23 is a Gaussian prime.

If is a decomposed prime or the ramified prime (that is, if its norm is a prime number, which is either 2 or a prime congruent to 1 modulo 4), then the residue class field has a prime number of elements (that is, ). It is thus isomorphic to the field of the integers modulo .

If, on the other hand, is an inert prime (that is, is the square of a prime number, which is congruent to 3 modulo 4), then the residue class field has elements, and it is an extension of degree 2 (unique, up to an isomorphism) of the prime field with elements (the integers modulo ).

==Primitive residue class group and Euler&#x27;s totient function==
Many theorems (and their proofs) for moduli of integers can be directly transferred to moduli of Gaussian integers, if one replaces the absolute value of the modulus by the norm. This holds especially for the &quot;primitive residue class group&quot; (also called multiplicative group of integers modulo) and Euler&#x27;s totient function. The primitive residue class group of a modulus is defined as the subset of its residue classes, which contains all residue classes that are coprime to , i.e. . Obviously, this system builds a multiplicative group. The number of its elements shall be denoted by (analogously to Euler&#x27;s totient function for integers ).

For Gaussian primes it immediately follows that and for arbitrary composite Gaussian integers
:formula_24
Euler&#x27;s product formula can be derived as
:formula_25
where the product is to build over all prime divisors of (with ). Also the important theorem of Euler can be directly transferred:
: For all with , it holds that .

==Historical background==
The ring of Gaussian integers was introduced by Carl Friedrich Gauss in his second monograph on quartic reciprocity (1832). The theorem of quadratic reciprocity (which he had first succeeded in proving in 1796) relates the solvability of the congruence to that of . Similarly, cubic reciprocity relates the solvability of to that of , and biquadratic (or quartic) reciprocity is a relation between and . Gauss discovered that the law of biquadratic reciprocity and its supplements were more easily stated and proved as statements about &quot;whole complex numbers&quot; (i.e. the Gaussian integers) than they are as statements about ordinary whole numbers (i.e. the integers).

In a footnote he notes that the Eisenstein integers are the natural domain for stating and proving results on cubic reciprocity and indicates that similar extensions of the integers are the appropriate domains for studying higher reciprocity laws.

This paper not only introduced the Gaussian integers and proved they are a unique factorization domain, it also introduced the terms norm, unit, primary, and associate, which are now standard in algebraic number theory.

==Unsolved problems==
Most of the unsolved problems are related to distribution of Gaussian primes in the plane.

*Gauss&#x27;s circle problem does not deal with the Gaussian integers per se, but instead asks for the number of lattice points inside a circle of a given radius centered at the origin. This is equivalent to determining the number of Gaussian integers with norm less than a given value.

There are also conjectures and unsolved problems about the Gaussian primes. Two of them are:
*The real and imaginary axes have the infinite set of Gaussian primes 3, 7, 11, 19, ... and their associates. Are there any other lines that have infinitely many Gaussian primes on them? In particular, are there infinitely many Gaussian primes of the form ?
*Is it possible to walk to infinity using the Gaussian primes as stepping stones and taking steps of a uniformly bounded length? This is known as the Gaussian moat problem; it was posed in 1962 by Basil Gordon and remains unsolved.

<text>In topology and related branches of mathematics, a normal space is a topological space &quot;X&quot; that satisfies Axiom T4: every two disjoint closed sets of &quot;X&quot; have disjoint open neighborhoods. A normal Hausdorff space is also called a T4 space. These conditions are examples of separation axioms and their further strengthenings define completely normal Hausdorff spaces, or T5 spaces, and perfectly normal Hausdorff spaces, or T6 spaces.

== Definitions ==

A topological space &quot;X&quot; is a normal space if, given any disjoint closed sets &quot;E&quot; and &quot;F&quot;, there are neighbourhoods &quot;U&quot; of &quot;E&quot; and &quot;V&quot; of &quot;F&quot; that are also disjoint. More intuitively, this condition says that &quot;E&quot; and &quot;F&quot; can be separated by neighbourhoods.

A T4 space is a T1 space &quot;X&quot; that is normal; this is equivalent to &quot;X&quot; being normal and Hausdorff.

A completely normal space, or , is a topological space &quot;X&quot; such that every subspace of &quot;X&quot; is a normal space. It turns out that &quot;X&quot; is completely normal if and only if every two separated sets can be separated by neighbourhoods. Also, &quot;X&quot; is completely normal if and only if every open subset of &quot;X&quot; is normal with the subspace topology.

A T5 space, or completely T4 space, is a completely normal T1 space &quot;X&quot;, which implies that &quot;X&quot; is Hausdorff; equivalently, every subspace of &quot;X&quot; must be a T4 space.

A perfectly normal space is a topological space formula_1 in which every two disjoint closed sets formula_2 and formula_3 can be precisely separated by a function, in the sense that there is a continuous function formula_4 from formula_1 to the interval formula_6 such that formula_7 and formula_8. This is a stronger separation property than normality, as by Urysohn&#x27;s lemma disjoint closed sets in a normal space can be separated by a function, in the sense of formula_9 and formula_10, but not precisely separated in general. It turns out that &quot;X&quot; is perfectly normal if and only if &quot;X&quot; is normal and every closed set is a Gδ set. Equivalently, &quot;X&quot; is perfectly normal if and only if every closed set is the zero set of a continuous function. The equivalence between these three characterizations is called Vedenissoff&#x27;s theorem. Every perfectly normal space is completely normal, because perfect normality is a hereditary property.

A T6 space, or perfectly T4 space, is a perfectly normal Hausdorff space.

Note that the terms &quot;normal space&quot; and &quot;T4&quot; and derived concepts occasionally have a different meaning. (Nonetheless, &quot;T5&quot; always means the same as &quot;completely T4&quot;, whatever the meaning of T4 may be.) The definitions given here are the ones usually used today. For more on this issue, see History of the separation axioms.

Terms like &quot;normal regular space&quot; and &quot;normal Hausdorff space&quot; also turn up in the literature—they simply mean that the space both is normal and satisfies the other condition mentioned. In particular, a normal Hausdorff space is the same thing as a T4 space. Given the historical confusion of the meaning of the terms, verbal descriptions when applicable are helpful, that is, &quot;normal Hausdorff&quot; instead of &quot;T4&quot;, or &quot;completely normal Hausdorff&quot; instead of &quot;T5&quot;.

Fully normal spaces and fully T4 spaces are discussed elsewhere; they are related to paracompactness.

A locally normal space is a topological space where every point has an open neighbourhood that is normal. Every normal space is locally normal, but the converse is not true. A classical example of a completely regular locally normal space that is not normal is the Nemytskii plane.

== Examples of normal spaces ==
Most spaces encountered in mathematical analysis are normal Hausdorff spaces, or at least normal regular spaces:
* All metric spaces (and hence all metrizable spaces) are perfectly normal Hausdorff;
* All pseudometric spaces (and hence all pseudometrisable spaces) are perfectly normal regular, although not in general Hausdorff;
* All compact Hausdorff spaces are normal;
* In particular, the Stone–Čech compactification of a Tychonoff space is normal Hausdorff;
* Generalizing the above examples, all paracompact Hausdorff spaces are normal, and all paracompact regular spaces are normal;
* All paracompact topological manifolds are perfectly normal Hausdorff. However, there exist non-paracompact manifolds that are not even normal.
* All order topologies on totally ordered sets are hereditarily normal and Hausdorff.
* Every regular second-countable space is completely normal, and every regular Lindelöf space is normal.

Also, all fully normal spaces are normal (even if not regular). Sierpiński space is an example of a normal space that is not regular.

== Examples of non-normal spaces ==
An important example of a non-normal topology is given by the Zariski topology on an algebraic variety or on the spectrum of a ring, which is used in algebraic geometry.

A non-normal space of some relevance to analysis is the topological vector space of all functions from the real line R to itself, with the topology of pointwise convergence.
More generally, a theorem of Arthur Harold Stone states that the product of uncountably many non-compact metric spaces is never normal.

== Properties ==
Every closed subset of a normal space is normal. The continuous and closed image of a normal space is normal.

The main significance of normal spaces lies in the fact that they admit &quot;enough&quot; continuous real-valued functions, as expressed by the following theorems valid for any normal space &quot;X&quot;.

Urysohn&#x27;s lemma:
If &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are two disjoint closed subsets of &quot;X&quot;, then there exists a continuous function &quot;f&quot; from &quot;X&quot; to the real line R such that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = 0 for all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;A&quot; and &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = 1 for all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;B&quot;.
In fact, we can take the values of &quot;f&quot; to be entirely within the unit interval [0,1]. In fancier terms, disjoint closed sets are not only separated by neighbourhoods, but also separated by a function.

More generally, the Tietze extension theorem:
If &quot;A&quot; is a closed subset of &quot;X&quot; and &quot;f&quot; is a continuous function from &quot;A&quot; to R, then there exists a continuous function &quot;F&quot;: &quot;X&quot; → R that extends &quot;f&quot; in the sense that &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) for all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;A&quot;.

The map &quot;formula_11&quot; has the lifting property with respect to a map from a certain finite topological space with five points (two open and three closed) to the space with one open and two closed points.

If U is a locally finite open cover of a normal space &quot;X&quot;, then there is a partition of unity precisely subordinate to U. This shows the relationship of normal spaces to paracompactness.

In fact, any space that satisfies any one of these three conditions must be normal.

A product of normal spaces is not necessarily normal. This fact was first proved by Robert Sorgenfrey. An example of this phenomenon is the Sorgenfrey plane. In fact, since there exist spaces which are Dowker, a product of a normal space and [0, 1] need not to be normal. Also, a subset of a normal space need not be normal (i.e. not every normal Hausdorff space is a completely normal Hausdorff space), since every Tychonoff space is a subset of its Stone–Čech compactification (which is normal Hausdorff). A more explicit example is the Tychonoff plank. The only large class of product spaces of normal spaces known to be normal are the products of compact Hausdorff spaces, since both compactness (Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem) and the T2 axiom are preserved under arbitrary products.

== Relationships to other separation axioms ==
If a normal space is R0, then it is in fact completely regular.
Thus, anything from &quot;normal R0&quot; to &quot;normal completely regular&quot; is the same as what we usually call &quot;normal regular&quot;.
Taking Kolmogorov quotients, we see that all normal T1 spaces are Tychonoff.
These are what we usually call &quot;normal Hausdorff&quot; spaces.

A topological space is said to be pseudonormal if given two disjoint closed sets in it, one of which is countable, there are disjoint open sets containing them. Every normal space is pseudonormal, but not vice versa.

Counterexamples to some variations on these statements can be found in the lists above.
Specifically, Sierpiński space is normal but not regular, while the space of functions from R to itself is Tychonoff but not normal.

<text>The year 2014 was marked by the surge of the West African Ebola epidemic, which began in 2013, becoming the most widespread outbreak of the Ebola virus in human history, resulting in 28,646 confirmed infections and 11,323 confirmed deaths according to the World Health Organization, who declared it a Public Health Emergency in August. The virus caused major socioeconomic disruption in the region, primarily in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Other notable health concerns in 2014 included a significant increase in polio cases in Pakistan.

The rise of ISIS became a major geopolitical crisis in 2014 after the group declared a global caliphate and launched devastating offensives in Iraq and Syria. The Camp Speicher massacre in which the Islamic State murdered 1,566 Shia Iraqi Air Force cadets and the Fall of Mosul, Iraq&#x27;s second-largest city, prompted a U.S led military intervention, which would later become a global effort. The Islamic State committed numerous atrocities, including mass beheadings, mass executions of civilians, and the genocide and persecution of religious minorities like the Yazidis, Christians and Shia Muslims. ISIS would attract thousands of foreign fighters from across the world to join their military, drawn by their ideology and promises of establishing a global Islamic state. ISIS led to a massive displacement of people in Iraq and Syria, creating a major humanitarian crisis for millions of peoples. Another notable conflict was the 2014 Gaza War, which Israel began 26 days after three Israeli teenagers were murdered in the West Bank by Hamas-affiliated Palestinian militants, the large-scale military operation, codenamed &quot;Operation Protective Edge&quot; saw intense fighting, with Israeli airstrikes and ground incursions into Gaza, killing 2,310 and wounding 10,626 Palestinians. The conflict would end on August 26, 2014, after a ceasefire agreement brokered by Egypt went into effect.

The Euromaidan protests, a series of demonstrations in Ukraine, were triggered by President Viktor Yanukovych&#x27;s sudden decision to pursue closer economic ties with Russia and his refusal to sign the European Union–Ukraine Association Agreement, which culminated in the Revolution of Dignity in February. Following this, a disputed referendum led to Russia occupying and annexing crimea from Ukraine, subsequent pro-Russian unrest led to Russian backed seperatist forces in eastern Ukraine seizing control of key areas, leading to the War in Donbas in April. The war escalated after Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 was shot down by Russian-backed forces while flying in Eastern Ukraine.

Political crises continued across the globe, with Thailand experiencing a military coup in May as the Royal Thai Army overthrew the caretaker government. Three main airplane disasters happened, the mysterious disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over eastern Ukraine, and the crash of Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501, collectively claiming over 700 lives. Civil unrest emerged in Ferguson, Missouri in the United States due to the killing of Michael Brown and in Hong Kong, during the 2014 Hong Kong protests. Despite all these challenges, scientific achievement provided hope as India became the first Asian nation to reach Mars with its Mangalyaan mission, and the Rosetta spacecraft&#x27;s Philae probe completed humanity&#x27;s first landing on a comet.

2014 was designated as:
*International Year of Crystallography
*International Year of Family Farming
*International Year of Small Island Developing States
*International Year of Solidarity with the Palestinian People

<text>In mathematics, a paracompact space is a topological space in which every open cover has an open refinement that is locally finite. These spaces were introduced by . Every compact space is paracompact. Every paracompact Hausdorff space is normal, and a Hausdorff space is paracompact if and only if it admits partitions of unity subordinate to any open cover. Sometimes paracompact spaces are defined so as to always be Hausdorff.

Every closed subspace of a paracompact space is paracompact. While compact subsets of Hausdorff spaces are always closed, this is not true for paracompact subsets. A space such that every subspace of it is a paracompact space is called hereditarily paracompact. This is equivalent to requiring that every open subspace be paracompact.

The notion of paracompact space is also studied in pointless topology, where it is more well-behaved. For example, the product of any number of paracompact locales is a paracompact locale, but the product of two paracompact spaces may not be paracompact. Compare this to Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem, which states that the product of any collection of compact topological spaces is compact. However, the product of a paracompact space and a compact space is always paracompact.

Every metric space is paracompact. A topological space is metrizable if and only if it is a paracompact and locally metrizable Hausdorff space.

== Definition ==

A &quot;cover&quot; of a set formula_1 is a collection of subsets of formula_1 whose union contains formula_1. In symbols, if formula_4 is an indexed family of subsets of formula_1, then formula_6 is a cover of formula_1 if

: formula_8

A cover of a topological space formula_1 is &quot;open&quot; if all its members are open sets. A &quot;refinement&quot; of a cover of a space formula_1 is a new cover of the same space such that every set in the new cover is a subset of some set in the old cover. In symbols, the cover formula_11 is a refinement of the cover formula_4 if and only if, for every formula_13 in formula_14, there exists some formula_15 in formula_6 such that formula_17.

An open cover of a space formula_1 is &quot;locally finite&quot; if every point of the space has a neighborhood that intersects only finitely many sets in the cover. In symbols, formula_4 is locally finite if and only if, for any formula_20 in formula_1, there exists some neighbourhood formula_14 of formula_20 such that the set

: formula_24

is finite. A topological space formula_1 is now said to be paracompact if every open cover has a locally finite open refinement.

This definition extends verbatim to locales, with the exception of locally finite: an open cover formula_6 of formula_1 is locally finite iff the set of opens formula_14 that intersect only finitely many opens in formula_6 also form a cover of formula_1. Note that an open cover on a topological space is locally finite iff its a locally finite cover of the underlying locale.

== Examples ==

* Every compact space is paracompact.
* Every regular Lindelöf space is paracompact, by Michael&#x27;s theorem in the Hausdorff case. In particular, every locally compact Hausdorff second-countable space is paracompact.
* The Sorgenfrey line is paracompact, even though it is neither compact, locally compact, second countable, nor metrizable.
* Every CW complex is paracompact.
* (Theorem of A. H. Stone) Every metric space is paracompact. Early proofs were somewhat involved, but an elementary one was found by M. E. Rudin. Existing proofs of this require the axiom of choice for the non-separable case. It has been shown that ZF theory is not sufficient to prove it, even after the weaker axiom of dependent choice is added.
*A Hausdorff space admitting an exhaustion by compact sets is paracompact.

Some examples of spaces that are not paracompact include:

* The most famous counterexample is the long line, which is a nonparacompact topological manifold. (The long line is locally compact, but not second countable.)
* Another counterexample is a product of uncountably many copies of an infinite discrete space. Any infinite set carrying the particular point topology is not paracompact; in fact it is not even metacompact.
* The Prüfer manifold &quot;P&quot; is a non-paracompact surface. (It is easy to find an uncountable open cover of &quot;P&quot; with no refinement of any kind.)
* The bagpipe theorem shows that there are 2ℵ1 topological equivalence classes of non-paracompact surfaces.
* The Sorgenfrey plane is not paracompact despite being a product of two paracompact spaces.

== Properties ==

Paracompactness is weakly hereditary, i.e. every closed subspace of a paracompact space is paracompact. This can be extended to F-sigma subspaces as well.

* (Michael&#x27;s theorem) A regular space is paracompact if every open cover admits a locally finite refinement, not necessarily open. In particular, every regular Lindelöf space is paracompact.
* (Smirnov metrization theorem) A topological space is metrizable if and only if it is paracompact, Hausdorff, and locally metrizable.
* Michael selection theorem states that lower semicontinuous multifunctions from &quot;X&quot; into nonempty closed convex subsets of Banach spaces admit continuous selection iff &quot;X&quot; is paracompact.

Although a product of paracompact spaces need not be paracompact, the following are true:

* The product of a paracompact space and a compact space is paracompact.
* The product of a metacompact space and a compact space is metacompact.

Both these results can be proved by the tube lemma which is used in the proof that a product of &quot;finitely many&quot; compact spaces is compact.

== Paracompact Hausdorff spaces ==

Paracompact spaces are sometimes required to also be Hausdorff to extend their properties.

* (Theorem of Jean Dieudonné) Every paracompact Hausdorff space is normal.
* Every paracompact Hausdorff space is a shrinking space, that is, every open cover of a paracompact Hausdorff space has a shrinking: another open cover indexed by the same set such that the closure of every set in the new cover lies inside the corresponding set in the old cover.
* On paracompact Hausdorff spaces, sheaf cohomology and Čech cohomology are equal.

=== Partitions of unity ===

The most important feature of paracompact Hausdorff spaces is that they admit partitions of unity subordinate to any open cover. This means the following: if &quot;X&quot; is a paracompact Hausdorff space with a given open cover, then there exists a collection of continuous functions on &quot;X&quot; with values in the unit interval [0, 1] such that:

* for every function &quot;f&quot;: &quot;X&quot; → R from the collection, there is an open set &quot;U&quot; from the cover such that the support of &quot;f&quot; is contained in &quot;U&quot;;
* for every point &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot;, there is a neighborhood &quot;V&quot; of &quot;x&quot; such that all but finitely many of the functions in the collection are identically 0 in &quot;V&quot; and the sum of the nonzero functions is identically 1 in &quot;V&quot;.

In fact, a T1 space is Hausdorff and paracompact if and only if it admits partitions of unity subordinate to any open cover (see below). This property is sometimes used to define paracompact spaces (at least in the Hausdorff case).

Partitions of unity are useful because they often allow one to extend local constructions to the whole space. For instance, the integral of differential forms on paracompact manifolds is first defined locally (where the manifold looks like Euclidean space and the integral is well known), and this definition is then extended to the whole space via a partition of unity.

==== Proof that paracompact Hausdorff spaces admit partitions of unity ====

\subseteq U\,&lt;/math&gt; and formula_31 is a locally finite refinement.

: Lemma 2: If formula_32 is a locally finite open cover, then there are continuous functions formula_33 such that formula_34 and such that formula_35 is a continuous function which is always non-zero and finite.

: Theorem: In a paracompact Hausdorff space formula_36, if formula_32 is an open cover, then there exists a partition of unity subordinate to it.

: Proof (Lemma 1): 
:Let formula_38 be the collection of open sets meeting only finitely many sets in formula_32, and whose closure is contained in a set in formula_40. One can check as an exercise that this provides an open refinement, since paracompact Hausdorff spaces are regular, and since formula_32 is locally finite. Now replace formula_38 by a locally finite open refinement. One can easily check that each set in this refinement has the same property as that which characterised the original cover.

: Now we define formula_43. The property of formula_38 guarantees that every formula_45 is contained in some formula_46. Therefore formula_31 is an open refinement of formula_32. Since we have formula_49, this cover is immediately locally finite.
: Now we want to show that each formula_50. For every formula_51, we will prove that formula_52. Since we chose formula_53 to be locally finite, there is a neighbourhood formula_54 of formula_55 such that only finitely many sets in formula_53 have non-empty intersection with formula_54, and we note formula_58 those in the definition of formula_59. Therefore we can decompose formula_59 in two parts: formula_61 who intersect formula_54, and the rest formula_63 who don&#x27;t, which means that they are contained in the closed set formula_64. We now have formula_65. Since formula_66 and formula_67, we have formula_68 for every formula_69. And since formula_70 is the complement of a neighbourhood of formula_55, formula_55 is also not in formula_70. Therefore we have formula_52.
: Proof (Lemma 2): 
:Applying Lemma 1, let formula_33 be continuous maps with formula_76 and formula_34 (by Urysohn&#x27;s lemma for disjoint closed sets in normal spaces, which a paracompact Hausdorff space is). Note by the support of a function, we here mean the points not mapping to zero (and not the closure of this set). To show that formula_78 is always finite and non-zero, take formula_79, and let formula_80 a neighbourhood of formula_81 meeting only finitely many sets in formula_32; thus formula_81 belongs to only finitely many sets in formula_32; thus formula_85 for all but finitely many formula_86; moreover formula_87 for some formula_86, thus formula_89; so formula_90 is finite and formula_91. To establish continuity, take formula_92 as before, and let formula_93, which is finite; then formula_94, which is a continuous function; hence the preimage under formula_95 of a neighbourhood of formula_90 will be a neighbourhood of formula_81.
: Proof (Theorem): 
:Take formula_98 a locally finite subcover of the refinement cover: formula_99. Applying Lemma 2, we obtain continuous functions formula_100 with formula_101 (thus the usual closed version of the support is contained in some formula_102, for each formula_103; for which their sum constitutes a &quot;continuous&quot; function which is always finite non-zero (hence formula_104 is continuous positive, finite-valued). So replacing each formula_105 by formula_106, we have now — all things remaining the same — that their sum is everywhere formula_107. Finally for formula_79, letting formula_80 be a neighbourhood of formula_81 meeting only finitely many sets in formula_98, we have formula_112 for all but finitely many formula_103 since each formula_101. Thus we have a partition of unity subordinate to the original open cover.

== Relationship with compactness ==

There is a similarity between the definitions of compactness and paracompactness:
For paracompactness, &quot;subcover&quot; is replaced by &quot;open refinement&quot; and &quot;finite&quot; by is replaced by &quot;locally finite&quot;. Both of these changes are significant: if we take the definition of paracompact and change &quot;open refinement&quot; back to &quot;subcover&quot;, or &quot;locally finite&quot; back to &quot;finite&quot;, we end up with the compact spaces in both cases.

Paracompactness has little to do with the notion of compactness, but rather more to do with breaking up topological space entities into manageable pieces.

=== Comparison of properties with compactness ===

Paracompactness is similar to compactness in the following respects:

* Every closed subset of a paracompact space is paracompact.
* Every paracompact Hausdorff space is normal.

It is different in these respects:

* A paracompact subset of a Hausdorff space need not be closed. In fact, for metric spaces, all subsets are paracompact.
* A product of paracompact spaces need not be paracompact. The square of the real line R in the lower limit topology is a classical example for this.

== Variations ==

There are several variations of the notion of paracompactness. To define them, we first need to extend the list of terms above:

A topological space is:

* metacompact if every open cover has an open point-finite refinement.
* orthocompact if every open cover has an open refinement such that the intersection of all the open sets about any point in this refinement is open.
* fully normal if every open cover has an open star refinement, and fully T4 if it is fully normal and T1 (see separation axioms).

The adverb &quot;countably&quot; can be added to any of the adjectives &quot;paracompact&quot;, &quot;metacompact&quot;, and &quot;fully normal&quot; to make the requirement apply only to countable open covers.

Every paracompact space is metacompact, and every metacompact space is orthocompact.

=== Definition of relevant terms for the variations ===

* Given a cover and a point, the &quot;star&quot; of the point in the cover is the union of all the sets in the cover that contain the point. In symbols, the star of &quot;x&quot; in U = {&quot;U&quot;α : α in &quot;A&quot;} is

: formula_115

: The notation for the star is not standardised in the literature, and this is just one possibility.
* A &quot;star refinement&quot; of a cover of a space &quot;X&quot; is a cover of the same space such that, given any point in the space, the star of the point in the new cover is a subset of some set in the old cover. In symbols, V is a star refinement of U = {&quot;U&quot;α : α in &quot;A&quot;} if for any &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot;, there exists a &quot;U&quot;α in &quot;U&quot; such that V*(&quot;x&quot;) is contained in &quot;U&quot;α.
* A cover of a space &quot;X&quot; is &quot;point-finite&quot; (or &quot;point finite&quot;) if every point of the space belongs to only finitely many sets in the cover. In symbols, U is point finite if for any &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot;, the set formula_116 is finite.

As the names imply, a fully normal space is normal and a fully T4 space is T4. Every fully T4 space is paracompact. In fact, for Hausdorff spaces, paracompactness and full normality are equivalent. Thus, a fully T4 space is the same thing as a paracompact Hausdorff space.

Without the Hausdorff property, paracompact spaces are not necessarily fully normal. Any compact space that is not regular provides an example.

A historical note: fully normal spaces were defined before paracompact spaces, in 1940, by John W. Tukey. 
The proof that all metrizable spaces are fully normal is easy. When it was proved by A.H. Stone that for Hausdorff spaces full normality and paracompactness are equivalent, he implicitly proved that all metrizable spaces are paracompact. Later Ernest Michael 
gave a direct proof of the latter fact and
M.E. Rudin gave another, elementary, proof.

<text>In topology and related branches of mathematics, a topological space is called locally compact if, roughly speaking, each small portion of the space looks like a small portion of a compact space. More precisely, it is a topological space in which every point has a compact neighborhood. 

When locally compact spaces are Hausdorff they are called locally compact Hausdorff, which are of particular interest in mathematical analysis.

==Formal definition==
Let &quot;X&quot; be a topological space. Most commonly &quot;X&quot; is called locally compact if every point &quot;x&quot; of &quot;X&quot; has a compact neighbourhood, i.e., there exists an open set &quot;U&quot; and a compact set &quot;K&quot;, such that formula_1.

There are other common definitions: They are all equivalent if &quot;X&quot; is a Hausdorff space (or preregular). But they are not equivalent in general:
:1. every point of &quot;X&quot; has a compact neighbourhood.
:2. every point of &quot;X&quot; has a closed compact neighbourhood.
:2′. every point of &quot;X&quot; has a relatively compact neighbourhood.
:2″. every point of &quot;X&quot; has a local base of relatively compact neighbourhoods.
:3. every point of &quot;X&quot; has a local base of compact neighbourhoods.
:4. every point of &quot;X&quot; has a local base of closed compact neighbourhoods.
:5. &quot;X&quot; is Hausdorff and satisfies any (or equivalently, all) of the previous conditions.

Logical relations among the conditions:
* Each condition implies (1).
* Conditions (2), (2′), (2″) are equivalent.
* Neither of conditions (2), (3) implies the other.
* Condition (4) implies (2) and (3).
* Compactness implies conditions (1) and (2), but not (3) or (4).

Condition (1) is probably the most commonly used definition, since it is the least restrictive and the others are equivalent to it when &quot;X&quot; is Hausdorff. This equivalence is a consequence of the facts that compact subsets of Hausdorff spaces are closed, and closed subsets of compact spaces are compact. Spaces satisfying (1) are also called , as they satisfy the weakest of the conditions here.

As they are defined in terms of relatively compact sets, spaces satisfying (2), (2&#x27;), (2&quot;) can more specifically be called locally relatively compact. Steen &amp; Seebach calls (2), (2&#x27;), (2&quot;) strongly locally compact to contrast with property (1), which they call &quot;locally compact&quot;.

Spaces satisfying condition (4) are exactly the spaces. Indeed, such a space is regular, as every point has a local base of closed neighbourhoods. Conversely, in a regular locally compact space suppose a point formula_2 has a compact neighbourhood formula_3. By regularity, given an arbitrary neighbourhood formula_4 of formula_2, there is a closed neighbourhood formula_6 of formula_2 contained in formula_8 and formula_6 is compact as a closed set in a compact set.

Condition (5) is used, for example, in Bourbaki. Any space that is locally compact (in the sense of condition (1)) and also Hausdorff automatically satisfies all the conditions above. Since in most applications locally compact spaces are also Hausdorff, these locally compact Hausdorff spaces will thus be the spaces that this article is primarily concerned with.

== Examples and counterexamples ==

=== Compact Hausdorff spaces ===
Every compact Hausdorff space is also locally compact, and many examples of compact spaces may be found in the article compact space.
Here we mention only:
* the unit interval [0,1];
* the Cantor set;
* the Hilbert cube.

=== Locally compact Hausdorff spaces that are not compact ===
*The Euclidean spaces Rn (and in particular the real line R) are locally compact as a consequence of the Heine–Borel theorem.
*Topological manifolds share the local properties of Euclidean spaces and are therefore also all locally compact. This even includes nonparacompact manifolds such as the long line.
*All discrete spaces are locally compact and Hausdorff (they are just the zero-dimensional manifolds). These are compact only if they are finite.
*All open or closed subsets of a locally compact Hausdorff space are locally compact in the subspace topology. This provides several examples of locally compact subsets of Euclidean spaces, such as the unit disc (either the open or closed version).
*The space Q&quot;p&quot; of &quot;p&quot;-adic numbers is locally compact, because it is homeomorphic to the Cantor set minus one point. Thus locally compact spaces are as useful in &quot;p&quot;-adic analysis as in classical analysis.

=== Hausdorff spaces that are not locally compact ===
As mentioned in the following section, if a Hausdorff space is locally compact, then it is also a Tychonoff space. For this reason, examples of Hausdorff spaces that fail to be locally compact because they are not Tychonoff spaces can be found in the article dedicated to Tychonoff spaces.
But there are also examples of Tychonoff spaces that fail to be locally compact, such as:

* the space Q of rational numbers (endowed with the topology from R), since any neighborhood contains a Cauchy sequence corresponding to an irrational number, which has no convergent subsequence in Q;
* the subspace formula_10 of formula_11, since the origin does not have a compact neighborhood;
* the lower limit topology or upper limit topology on the set R of real numbers (useful in the study of one-sided limits);
* any T0, hence Hausdorff, topological vector space that is infinite-dimensional, such as an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space.

The first two examples show that a subset of a locally compact space need not be locally compact, which contrasts with the open and closed subsets in the previous section.
The last example contrasts with the Euclidean spaces in the previous section; to be more specific, a Hausdorff topological vector space is locally compact if and only if it is finite-dimensional (in which case it is a Euclidean space).
This example also contrasts with the Hilbert cube as an example of a compact space; there is no contradiction because the cube cannot be a neighbourhood of any point in Hilbert space.

===Non-Hausdorff examples===
* The one-point compactification of the rational numbers Q is compact and therefore locally compact in senses (1) and (2) but it is not locally compact in senses (3) or (4).
* The particular point topology on any infinite set is locally compact in senses (1) and (3) but not in senses (2) or (4), because the closure of any neighborhood is the entire space, which is non-compact.
* The disjoint union of the above two examples is locally compact in sense (1) but not in senses (2), (3) or (4).
* The right order topology on the real line is locally compact in senses (1) and (3) but not in senses (2) or (4), because the closure of any neighborhood is the entire non-compact space.
* The Sierpiński space is locally compact in senses (1), (2) and (3), and compact as well, but it is not Hausdorff or regular (or even preregular) so it is not locally compact in senses (4) or (5). The disjoint union of countably many copies of Sierpiński space is a non-compact space which is still locally compact in senses (1), (2) and (3), but not (4) or (5).
* More generally, the excluded point topology is locally compact in senses (1), (2) and (3), and compact, but not locally compact in senses (4) or (5).
* The cofinite topology on an infinite set is locally compact in senses (1), (2), and (3), and compact as well, but it is not Hausdorff or regular so it is not locally compact in senses (4) or (5).
* The indiscrete topology on a set with at least two elements is locally compact in senses (1), (2), (3), and (4), and compact as well, but it is not Hausdorff so it is not locally compact in sense (5).

===General classes of examples===
* Every space with an Alexandrov topology is locally compact in senses (1) and (3).

== Properties ==
Every locally compact preregular space is, in fact, completely regular. It follows that every locally compact Hausdorff space is a Tychonoff space. Since straight regularity is a more familiar condition than either preregularity (which is usually weaker) or complete regularity (which is usually stronger), locally compact preregular spaces are normally referred to in the mathematical literature as &quot;locally compact regular spaces&quot;. Similarly locally compact Tychonoff spaces are usually just referred to as &quot;locally compact Hausdorff spaces&quot;.

Every locally compact regular space, in particular every locally compact Hausdorff space, is a Baire space.
That is, the conclusion of the Baire category theorem holds: the interior of every countable union of nowhere dense subsets is empty.

A subspace &quot;X&quot; of a locally compact Hausdorff space &quot;Y&quot; is locally compact if and only if &quot;X&quot; is locally closed in &quot;Y&quot; (that is, &quot;X&quot; can be written as the set-theoretic difference of two closed subsets of &quot;Y&quot;). In particular, every closed set and every open set in a locally compact Hausdorff space is locally compact. Also, as a corollary, a dense subspace &quot;X&quot; of a locally compact Hausdorff space &quot;Y&quot; is locally compact if and only if &quot;X&quot; is open in &quot;Y&quot;. Furthermore, if a subspace &quot;X&quot; of &quot;any&quot; Hausdorff space &quot;Y&quot; is locally compact, then &quot;X&quot; still must be locally closed in &quot;Y&quot;, although the converse does not hold in general.

Without the Hausdorff hypothesis, some of these results break down with weaker notions of locally compact. Every closed set in a weakly locally compact space (= condition (1) in the definitions above) is weakly locally compact. But not every open set in a weakly locally compact space is weakly locally compact. For example, the one-point compactification formula_12 of the rational numbers formula_13 is compact, and hence weakly locally compact. But it contains formula_13 as an open set which is not weakly locally compact.

Quotient spaces of locally compact Hausdorff spaces are compactly generated.
Conversely, every compactly generated Hausdorff space is a quotient of some locally compact Hausdorff space.

For functions defined on a locally compact space, local uniform convergence is the same as compact convergence.

=== The point at infinity ===
This section explores compactifications of locally compact spaces. Every compact space is its own compactification. So to avoid trivialities it is assumed below that the space &quot;X&quot; is not compact.

Since every locally compact Hausdorff space &quot;X&quot; is Tychonoff, it can be embedded in a compact Hausdorff space formula_15 using the Stone–Čech compactification.
But in fact, there is a simpler method available in the locally compact case; the one-point compactification will embed &quot;X&quot; in a compact Hausdorff space formula_16 with just one extra point.
(The one-point compactification can be applied to other spaces, but formula_16 will be Hausdorff if and only if &quot;X&quot; is locally compact and Hausdorff.)
The locally compact Hausdorff spaces can thus be characterised as the open subsets of compact Hausdorff spaces.

Intuitively, the extra point in formula_16 can be thought of as a point at infinity.
The point at infinity should be thought of as lying outside every compact subset of &quot;X&quot;.
Many intuitive notions about tendency towards infinity can be formulated in locally compact Hausdorff spaces using this idea.
For example, a continuous real or complex valued function &quot;f&quot; with domain &quot;X&quot; is said to &quot;vanish at infinity&quot; if, given any positive number &quot;e&quot;, there is a compact subset &quot;K&quot; of &quot;X&quot; such that formula_19 whenever the point &quot;x&quot; lies outside of &quot;K&quot;. This definition makes sense for any topological space &quot;X&quot;. If &quot;X&quot; is locally compact and Hausdorff, such functions are precisely those extendable to a continuous function &quot;g&quot; on its one-point compactification formula_20 where formula_21

=== Gelfand representation ===
For a locally compact Hausdorff space &quot;X,&quot; the set formula_22 of all continuous complex-valued functions on &quot;X&quot; that vanish at infinity is a commutative C*-algebra. In fact, every commutative C*-algebra is isomorphic to formula_22 for some unique (up to homeomorphism) locally compact Hausdorff space &quot;X&quot;. This is shown using the Gelfand representation. 

=== Locally compact groups ===
The notion of local compactness is important in the study of topological groups mainly because every Hausdorff locally compact group &quot;G&quot; carries natural measures called the Haar measures which allow one to integrate measurable functions defined on &quot;G&quot;.
The Lebesgue measure on the real line formula_24 is a special case of this.

The Pontryagin dual of a topological abelian group &quot;A&quot; is locally compact if and only if &quot;A&quot; is locally compact.
More precisely, Pontryagin duality defines a self-duality of the category of locally compact abelian groups.
The study of locally compact abelian groups is the foundation of harmonic analysis, a field that has since spread to non-abelian locally compact groups.

<text>The Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Photography is one of the American Pulitzer Prizes annually awarded for journalism. From 2000 it has used the &quot;breaking news&quot; name but it is considered a continuation of the Pulitzer Prize for Spot News Photography, which was awarded from 1968 to 1999. Prior to 1968, a single Prize was awarded for photojournalism, the Pulitzer Prize for Photography, which was replaced in that year by Pulitzer Prize for Spot News Photography and Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography.

<text>In mathematics, a subset of a topological space is called nowhere dense or rare if its closure has empty interior. In a very loose sense, it is a set whose elements are not tightly clustered (as defined by the topology on the space) anywhere. For example, the integers are nowhere dense among the reals, whereas the interval (0, 1) is not nowhere dense.

A countable union of nowhere dense sets is called a meagre set. Meagre sets play an important role in the formulation of the Baire category theorem, which is used in the proof of several fundamental results of functional analysis.

== Definition ==

Density nowhere can be characterized in different (but equivalent) ways. The simplest definition is the one from density:
A subset formula_1 of a topological space formula_2 is said to be dense in another set formula_3 if the intersection formula_4 is a dense subset of formula_5 formula_1 is &#x27; or &#x27; in formula_2 if formula_1 is not dense in any nonempty open subset formula_3 of formula_10 
Expanding out the negation of density, it is equivalent that each nonempty open set formula_3 contains a nonempty open subset disjoint from formula_12 It suffices to check either condition on a base for the topology on formula_10 In particular, density nowhere in formula_14 is often described as being dense in no open interval.

=== Definition by closure ===

The second definition above is equivalent to requiring that the closure, formula_15 cannot contain any nonempty open set. This is the same as saying that the interior of the closure of formula_1 is empty; that is,formula_17 Alternatively, the complement of the closure formula_18 must be a dense subset of formula_19 in other words, the exterior of formula_1 is dense in formula_10

== Properties ==

The notion of &quot;nowhere dense set&quot; is always relative to a given surrounding space. Suppose formula_22 where formula_23 has the subspace topology induced from formula_10 The set formula_25 may be nowhere dense in formula_26 but not nowhere dense in formula_27 Notably, a set is always dense in its own subspace topology. So if formula_25 is nonempty, it will not be nowhere dense as a subset of itself. However the following results hold:
* If formula_25 is nowhere dense in formula_30 then formula_25 is nowhere dense in formula_10
* If formula_23 is open in formula_2, then formula_25 is nowhere dense in formula_23 if and only if formula_25 is nowhere dense in formula_10
* If formula_23 is dense in formula_2, then formula_25 is nowhere dense in formula_23 if and only if formula_25 is nowhere dense in formula_10

A set is nowhere dense if and only if its closure is.

Every subset of a nowhere dense set is nowhere dense, and a finite union of nowhere dense sets is nowhere dense. Thus the nowhere dense sets form an ideal of sets, a suitable notion of negligible set. In general they do not form a 𝜎-ideal, as meager sets, which are the countable unions of nowhere dense sets, need not be nowhere dense. For example, the set formula_45 is not nowhere dense in formula_46

The boundary of every open set and of every closed set is closed and nowhere dense. A closed set is nowhere dense if and only if it is equal to its boundary, if and only if it is equal to the boundary of some open set (for example the open set can be taken as the complement of the set). An arbitrary set formula_47 is nowhere dense if and only if it is a subset of the boundary of some open set (for example the open set can be taken as the exterior of formula_25).

== Examples ==

* The set formula_49 and its closure formula_50 are nowhere dense in formula_51 since the closure has empty interior.
* The Cantor set is an uncountable nowhere dense set in formula_46
* formula_14 viewed as the horizontal axis in the Euclidean plane is nowhere dense in formula_54
* formula_55 is nowhere dense in formula_14 but the rationals formula_45 are not (they are dense everywhere).
* formula_58 is nowhere dense in formula_14: it is dense in the open interval formula_60 and in particular the interior of its closure is formula_61
* The empty set is nowhere dense. In a discrete space, the empty set is the nowhere dense set.
* In a T1 space, any singleton set that is not an isolated point is nowhere dense.
* A vector subspace of a topological vector space is either dense or nowhere dense.

== Nowhere dense sets with positive measure ==

A nowhere dense set is not necessarily negligible in every sense. For example, if formula_2 is the unit interval formula_63 not only is it possible to have a dense set of Lebesgue measure zero (such as the set of rationals), but it is also possible to have a nowhere dense set with positive measure. One such example is the Smith–Volterra–Cantor set.

For another example (a variant of the Cantor set), remove from formula_64 all dyadic fractions, i.e. fractions of the form formula_65 in lowest terms for positive integers formula_66 and the intervals around them: formula_67 
Since for each formula_68 this removes intervals adding up to at most formula_69 the nowhere dense set remaining after all such intervals have been removed has measure of at least formula_70 (in fact just over formula_71 because of overlaps) and so in a sense represents the majority of the ambient space formula_72 
This set is nowhere dense, as it is closed and has an empty interior: any interval formula_73 is not contained in the set since the dyadic fractions in formula_73 have been removed.

Generalizing this method, one can construct in the unit interval nowhere dense sets of any measure less than formula_75 although the measure cannot be exactly 1 (because otherwise the complement of its closure would be a nonempty open set with measure zero, which is impossible).

For another simpler example, if formula_3 is any dense open subset of formula_14 having finite Lebesgue measure then formula_78 is necessarily a closed subset of formula_14 having infinite Lebesgue measure that is also nowhere dense in formula_14 (because its topological interior is empty). Such a dense open subset formula_3 of finite Lebesgue measure is commonly constructed when proving that the Lebesgue measure of the rational numbers formula_45 is formula_83 This may be done by choosing any bijection formula_84 (it actually suffices for formula_84 to merely be a surjection) and for every formula_86 letting 
formula_87
(here, the Minkowski sum notation formula_88 was used to simplify the description of the intervals). 
The open subset formula_89 is dense in formula_14 because this is true of its subset formula_45 and its Lebesgue measure is no greater than formula_92 
Taking the union of closed, rather than open, intervals produces the F-subset
formula_93
that satisfies formula_94 Because formula_95 is a subset of the nowhere dense set formula_96 it is also nowhere dense in formula_46 
Because formula_14 is a Baire space, the set
formula_99
is a dense subset of formula_14 (which means that like its subset formula_101 formula_102 cannot possibly be nowhere dense in formula_14) with formula_104 Lebesgue measure that is also a nonmeager subset of formula_14 (that is, formula_102 is of the second category in formula_14), which makes formula_108 a comeager subset of formula_14 whose interior in formula_14 is also empty; however, formula_108 is nowhere dense in formula_14 if and only if its in formula_14 has empty interior. 
The subset formula_45 in this example can be replaced by any countable dense subset of formula_14 and furthermore, even the set formula_14 can be replaced by formula_117 for any integer formula_118

<doc id="48636" wikidata="Q191690" url="?curid=48636" title="Partition of unity">
<text>In mathematics, a partition of unity of a topological space is a set of continuous functions from to the unit interval [0,1] such that for every point formula_1:
* there is a neighbourhood of where all but a finite number of the functions of are 0, and
* the sum of all the function values at is 1, i.e., formula_2

Partitions of unity are useful because they often allow one to extend local constructions to the whole space. They are also important in the interpolation of data, in signal processing, and the theory of spline functions.

== Existence ==
The existence of partitions of unity assumes two distinct forms:

# Given any open cover formula_3 of a space, there exists a partition formula_4 indexed &quot;over the same set&quot; such that supp formula_5 Such a partition is said to be subordinate to the open cover formula_6
# If the space is locally-compact, given any open cover formula_3 of a space, there exists a partition formula_8 indexed over a possibly distinct index set such that each has compact support and for each , supp formula_9 for some .

Thus one chooses either to have the supports indexed by the open cover, or compact supports. If the space is compact, then there exist partitions satisfying both requirements.

A finite open cover always has a continuous partition of unity subordinated to it, provided the space is locally compact and Hausdorff. 
Paracompactness of the space is a necessary condition to guarantee the existence of a partition of unity subordinate to any open cover. Depending on the category to which the space belongs, it may also be a sufficient condition. The construction uses mollifiers (bump functions), which exist in continuous and smooth manifolds, but not in analytic manifolds. Thus for an open cover of an analytic manifold, an analytic partition of unity subordinate to that open cover generally does not exist. &quot;See&quot; analytic continuation.

If and are partitions of unity for spaces and , respectively, then the set of all pairs formula_10 is a partition of unity for the cartesian product space . The tensor product of functions act as formula_11

== Example ==
We can construct a partition of unity on formula_12 by looking at a chart on the complement of a point formula_13 sending formula_14 to formula_15 with center formula_16. Now, let formula_17 be a bump function on formula_15 defined by formula_19 then, both this function and formula_20 can be extended uniquely onto formula_12 by setting formula_22. Then, the set formula_23 forms a partition of unity over formula_12.

==Variant definitions==
Sometimes a less restrictive definition is used: the sum of all the function values at a particular point is only required to be positive, rather than 1, for each point in the space. However, given such a set of functions formula_25 one can obtain a partition of unity in the strict sense by dividing by the sum; the partition becomes formula_26 where formula_27, which is well defined since at each point only a finite number of terms are nonzero. Even further, some authors drop the requirement that the supports be locally finite, requiring only that formula_28 for all formula_29.

In the field of operator algebras, a partition of unity is composed of projections formula_30. In the case of formula_31-algebras, it can be shown that the entries are pairwise-orthogonal:
formula_32
Note it is &quot;not&quot; the case that in a general *-algebra that the entries of a partition of unity are pairwise-orthogonal.
If formula_33 is a normal element of a unital formula_31-algebra formula_35, and has finite spectrum formula_36, then the projections in the spectral decomposition:
formula_37
form a partition of unity.

In the field of compact quantum groups, the rows and columns of the fundamental representation formula_38 of a quantum permutation group formula_39 form partitions of unity.

==Applications==
A partition of unity can be used to define the integral (with respect to a volume form) of a function defined over a manifold: one first defines the integral of a function whose support is contained in a single coordinate patch of the manifold; then one uses a partition of unity to define the integral of an arbitrary function; finally one shows that the definition is independent of the chosen partition of unity.

A partition of unity can be used to show the existence of a Riemannian metric on an arbitrary manifold.

Method of steepest descent employs a partition of unity to construct asymptotics of integrals.

Linkwitz–Riley filter is an example of practical implementation of partition of unity to separate input signal into two output signals containing only high- or low-frequency components.

The Bernstein polynomials of a fixed degree &quot;m&quot; are a family of &quot;m&quot;+1 linearly independent single-variable polynomials that are a partition of unity for the unit interval formula_40.

The weak Hilbert Nullstellensatz asserts that if formula_41 are polynomials with no common vanishing points in formula_42, then there are polynomials formula_43 with formula_44. That is, formula_45 form a polynomial partition of unity subordinate to the Zariski-open cover formula_46. 

Partitions of unity are used to establish global smooth approximations for Sobolev functions in bounded domains.

<text>The Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Reporting is a Pulitzer Prize awarded for a distinguished example of breaking news, local reporting on news of the moment. It has been awarded since 1953 under several names:

*From 1953 to 1963: Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting, Edition Time
*From 1964 to 1984: Pulitzer Prize for Local General or [[Breaking news|Spot News]] Reporting
*From 1985 to 1990: Pulitzer Prize for General News Reporting
*From 1991 to 1997: Pulitzer Prize for Spot News Reporting
*From 1998 to present: Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Reporting

Prior to 1953, a Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting combined both breaking and investigative reporting under one category. The Pulitzer Committee issues an official citation explaining the reasons for the award.

Hitherto confined to local coverage, the Breaking News Reporting category was expanded to encompass state and national reporting in 2017.

<doc id="48640" wikidata="Q928801" url="?curid=48640" title="Universal jurisdiction">
<text>Universal jurisdiction is a legal principle that allows states or international organizations to prosecute individuals for serious crimes, such as genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, regardless of where the crime was committed and irrespective of the accused&#x27;s nationality or residence. Rooted in the belief that certain offenses are universally morally reprehensible and that they threaten the international community as a whole, universal jurisdiction holds that such acts are beyond the scope of any single nation&#x27;s laws. Instead, these crimes are considered to violate norms owed to the global community (&quot;erga omnes&quot;) and fundamental principles of international law (&quot;jus cogens&quot;), making them prosecutable in any court that invokes this principle.

While universal jurisdiction has been championed by organizations such as Amnesty International for ensuring that perpetrators of grave crimes find no refuge, it remains controversial. Critics, like former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, argue that it undermines national sovereignty and risks turning judicial proceedings into politically motivated trials. The principle gained prominence following the Nuremberg trials after World War II, which prosecuted Nazi officials for crimes against humanity, even when such acts were legal under German law at the time. Since then, it has been invoked in various international tribunals and national courts to address impunity for crimes committed in conflict zones or under repressive regimes.

Notably, universal jurisdiction has been applied in cases like Israel’s prosecution of Adolf Eichmann in 1961, the trials of Rwandan genocide perpetrators, and the prosecution of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. The establishment of the International Criminal Court (ICC) further strengthened this concept, though its use remains contentious, often constrained by political considerations and the practical challenges of enforcing extraterritorial justice.

==History==

The &quot;Institutes of Justinian&quot;, echoing the &quot;Commentaries&quot; of Gaius, says that &quot;All nations ... are governed partly by their own particular laws, and partly by those laws which are common to all, [those that] natural Reason appoints for all mankind.&quot; Expanding on the classical understanding of universal law accessible by reason, in the seventeenth century, the Dutch jurist Grotius laid the foundations for universal jurisdiction in modern international law, promulgating in his &quot;De Jure Praedae&quot; (&quot;Of the Law of Captures&quot;) and later &quot;Dē jūre bellī ac pācis&quot; (&quot;Of the Law of War and Peace&quot;) the Enlightenment view that there are universal principles of right and wrong.

According to Henry Kissinger, at about the same time, international law came to recognize the analogous concept of &quot;hostēs hūmānī generis&quot; (&quot;enemies of the human race&quot;) applying to pirates or hijackers whose crimes took place outside of nation-state territories, while universal jurisdiction subjecting senior officials or heads of states as criminal subjects was new. 

From these premises, representing the Enlightenment belief in trans-territorial, trans-cultural standards of right and wrong, derives universal jurisdiction.

Perhaps the most notable and influential precedent for universal jurisdiction were the mid-20th century Nuremberg Trials. U.S. Justice Robert H. Jackson then chief prosecutor, famously stated that an International Military Tribunal enforcing universal principles of right and wrong could prosecute acts without a particular geographic location, Nazi &quot;crimes against the peace of the world&quot;—even if the acts were perfectly legal at the time in Fascist Germany. Indeed, one charge was Nazi law itself became a crime, law distorted into a bludgeon of oppression. The Nuremberg trials supposed universal standards by which one nation&#x27;s laws, and acts of its officials, can be judged; an international rule of law unbound by national borders.

On the other hand, even at the time, the Nuremberg trials were criticized as victor&#x27;s justice, revenge papered over with legal simulacra. US Supreme Court Chief Justice Harlan Fiske Stone remarked that his colleague Justice Jackson acting as Nuremberg Chief prosecutor was &quot;conducting his high-grade lynching party in Nuremberg. I don&#x27;t mind what he does to the Nazis, but I hate to see the pretense that he is running a court and proceeding according to common law. This is a little too sanctimonious a fraud to meet my old-fashioned ideas.&quot;

Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch, argues that universal jurisdiction allowed Israel to try Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem in 1961. Roth also argues that clauses in treaties such as the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and the United Nations Convention Against Torture of 1984, which requires signatory states to pass municipal laws that are based on the concept of universal jurisdiction, indicate widespread international acceptance of the concept.

==Theory of universal jurisdiction application==
Amongst the vast spread of literature surrounding the theory, application, and history of Universal Jurisdiction, there are two approaches: the &quot;global enforcer&quot; and the &quot;no safe haven&quot;. &quot;Global enforcer&quot; refers to the usage of Universal Jurisdiction as an active way of preventing and punishing international crimes committed anywhere while &quot;no safe haven&quot; takes on a more passive tone, referring to the usage of this principle to ensure that the specific country is not a territorial refuge for any suspects of international crimes.

==Universal distinct from extraterritorial jurisdiction==
Universal jurisdiction differs from a state&#x27;s prosecuting crimes under its own laws, whether on its own territory (territorial jurisdiction) or abroad (extraterritorial jurisdiction). As an example, the United States asserts jurisdiction over stateless vessels carrying illicit drugs on international waters—but here the US reaches across national borders to enforce its own law, rather than invoking universal jurisdiction and trans-national standards of right and wrong.

States attempting to police acts committed by foreign nationals on foreign territory tends to be more controversial than a state prosecuting its own citizens wherever they may be found. Bases on which a state might exercise jurisdiction in this way include the following:

* A state can exercise jurisdiction over acts that affect the fundamental interests of the state, such as spying, even if the act was committed by foreign nationals on foreign territory. For example, the Indian Information Technology Act 2000 largely supports the extraterritoriality of the said Act. The law states that a contravention of the Act that affects any computer or computer network situated in India will be punishable by India irrespective of the culprit&#x27;s location and nationality.
* A state may try its own nationals for crimes committed abroad. France and some other nations will refuse to extradite their own citizens as a matter of law, but will instead try them on their own territory for crimes committed abroad.
* More controversial is the exercise of jurisdiction where the victim of the crime is a national of the state exercising jurisdiction. In the past some states have claimed this jurisdiction (e.g., Mexico, &quot;Cutting Case&quot; (1887)), while others have been strongly opposed to it (e.g., the United States, except in cases in which an American citizen is a victim: &quot;US v Yunis&quot; (1988)). In more recent years, however, a broad global consensus has emerged in permitting its use in the case of torture, &quot;forced disappearances&quot; or terrorist offences (due in part to it being permitted by the various United Nations conventions on terrorism); but its application in other areas is still highly controversial. For example, former dictator of Chile Augusto Pinochet was arrested in London in 1998, on Spanish judge Baltazar Garzon&#x27;s demand, on charges of human rights abuses, not on the grounds of universal jurisdiction but rather on the grounds that some of the victims of the abuses committed in Chile were Spanish citizens. Spain then sought his extradition from Britain, again, not on the grounds of universal jurisdiction, but by invoking the law of the European Union regarding extradition; and he was finally released on grounds of health. Argentinian Alfredo Astiz&#x27;s sentence is part of this juridical frame.

==International tribunals invoking universal jurisdiction==

Established in The Hague in 2002, the International Criminal Court (ICC) is an international tribunal of general jurisdiction (defined by treaty) to prosecute state-members&#x27; citizens for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression, as specified by several international agreements, most prominently the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court signed in 1998. A serious international crime is outlined in Article 7 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal court as a serious criminal act committed as part of a &quot;widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack&quot;, including murder, rape, slavery, persecution, extermination, and torture. Universal jurisdiction over the crimes enumerated in the Rome Statute was rejected by the signing parties, however universal jurisdiction is what allows the United Nations Security Council to refer specific situations to the ICC. This has only happened with Darfur (2005) and Libya (2011).

In addition the United Nations has set up geographically specific courts to investigate and prosecute crimes against humanity under a theory of universal jurisdiction, such as the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (1994), and the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (1993).

The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia investigates war crimes that took place in the Balkans in the 1990s. It convicted former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadžić on 10 charges relating to directing murders, purges and other abuses against civilians, including genocide in connection with the 1995 massacre of 8,000 Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica; he was sentenced to 40 years in prison.

==Particular states invoking universal jurisdiction==
Universal jurisdiction may be asserted by a particular nation as well as by an international tribunal. The result is the same: individuals become answerable for crimes defined and prosecuted regardless of where they live, or where the conduct occurred; crimes said to be so grievous as to be universally condemned.

Amnesty International argues that since the end of the Second World War over fifteen states have conducted investigations, commenced prosecutions and completed trials based on universal jurisdiction for the crimes or arrested people with a view to extraditing the persons to a state seeking to prosecute them. These states include: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Israel, Mexico, Netherlands, Senegal, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. Amnesty writes:
 All states parties to the Convention against Torture and the Inter-American Convention are obliged whenever a person suspected of torture is found in their territory to submit the case to their prosecuting authorities for the purposes of prosecution, or to extradite that person. In addition, it is now widely recognized that states, even those that are not states parties to these treaties, may exercise universal jurisdiction over torture under customary international law.

Examples of particular states invoking universal jurisdiction are Israel&#x27;s prosecution of Eichmann in 1961 (see below) and Spain&#x27;s prosecution of South American dictators and torturers (see below). More recently, the Center for Constitutional Rights tried first in Switzerland and then in Canada to prosecute former U.S. President George W. Bush on behalf of persons tortured in US detention camps, invoking the universal jurisdiction doctrine. Bush cancelled his trip to Switzerland after news of the planned prosecution came to light. Bush has traveled to Canada but the Canadian government shut down the prosecution in advance of his arrest. The center has filed a grievance with the United Nations for Canada&#x27;s failure to invoke universal jurisdiction to enforce the Convention Against Torture, a petition on which action is pending.

==Immunity for state officials==
On 14 February 2002, the International Court of Justice in the &quot;ICJ Arrest Warrant Case&quot; concluded that state officials may have immunity under international law while serving in office. The court stated that immunity was not granted to state officials for their own benefit, but instead to ensure the effective performance of their functions on behalf of their respective states. The court also stated that when abroad, state officials may enjoy immunity from arrest in another state on criminal charges, including charges of war crimes or crimes against humanity. But the ICJ qualified its conclusions, saying that state officers &quot;may be subject to criminal proceedings before certain international criminal courts, where they have jurisdiction. Examples include the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda ..., and the future International Criminal Court.&quot;

In 2003, Charles Taylor, the former president of Liberia, was served with an arrest warrant by the Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL) that was set up under the auspices of a treaty that binds only the United Nations and the Government of Sierra Leone. Taylor contested the Special Court&#x27;s jurisdiction, claiming immunity, but the Special Court for Sierra Leone concluded in 2004 that &quot;the sovereign equality of states does not prevent a head of state from being prosecuted before an international criminal tribunal or court&quot;. The Special Court convicted Taylor in 2012 and sentenced him to fifty years&#x27; imprisonment, making him the first head of state since the Nuremberg trials after World War II to be tried and convicted by an international court. In sum, the question whether a former head of state might have immunity depends on which international court or tribunal endeavors to try him, how the court is constituted, and how it interprets its own mandate.

==Universal jurisdiction enforcement around the world==

===Argentina===
On 14 February 2025, a court in Argentina, acting on a petition from the Burmese Rohingya Organisation UK and citing universal jurisdiction, issued arrest warrants against several officials in Myanmar, including junta leader Min Aung Hlaing, former president Htin Kyaw, and former state counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi on charges of &quot;genocide and crimes against humanity&quot; against the Rohingyas.

===Australia===
The High Court of Australia confirmed the authority of the Australian Parliament, under the Australian Constitution, to exercise universal jurisdiction over war crimes in the &quot;Polyukhovich v Commonwealth&quot; case of 1991.

===Belgium===

In 1993, Belgium&#x27;s Parliament passed a &quot;law of universal jurisdiction&quot; (sometimes referred to as &quot;Belgium&#x27;s genocide law&quot;), allowing the state to prosecute people accused of war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide. In 2001, four Rwandan citizens were convicted and given sentences from 12 to 20 years&#x27; imprisonment for their involvement in 1994 Rwandan genocide. There was a rapid succession of cases:
* Prime Minister Ariel Sharon was accused of involvement in the 1982 Sabra and Shatila massacre in Lebanon, conducted by a Christian militia;
* Israelis filed a case against Yasser Arafat on grounds of responsibility for terrorist activity;
* In 2003, Iraqi victims of a 1991 Baghdad bombing pressed charges against George H. W. Bush, Colin Powell, and Dick Cheney.

Confronted with this sharp increase in cases, Belgium established the condition that the accused person must be Belgian or present in Belgium. An arrest warrant issued in 2000 under this law, against the then Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Abdoulaye Yerodia Ndombasi, was challenged before the International Court of Justice in the case entitled &quot;ICJ Arrest Warrant Case&quot;. The ICJ&#x27;s decision issued on 14 February 2002 found that it did not have jurisdiction to consider the question of universal jurisdiction, instead deciding the question on the basis of immunity of high-ranking state officials. However, the matter was addressed in separate and dissenting opinions, such as that of President Guillaume who concluded that universal jurisdiction exists only in relation to piracy; and the dissenting opinion of Judge Oda who recognised piracy, hijacking, terrorism and genocide as crimes subject to universal jurisdiction.

On 1 August 2003, Belgium repealed the law on universal jurisdiction, and introduced a new law on extraterritorial jurisdiction similar to or more restrictive than that of most other European countries. However, some cases that had already started continued. These included those concerning the Rwandan genocide, and complaints filed against the Chadian ex-President Hissène Habré (dubbed the &quot;African Pinochet&quot;). In September 2005, Habré was indicted for crimes against humanity, torture, war crimes and other human rights violations by a Belgian court. Arrested in Senegal following requests from Senegalese courts, he was tried and convicted for war crimes by the Special Tribunal in Senegal in 2016 and sentenced to life in prison.

===Canada===
To implement the Rome Statute, Canada passed the Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act. Michael Byers, a University of British Columbia law professor, has argued that these laws go further than the Rome Statute, providing Canadian courts with jurisdiction over acts pre-dating the ICC and occurring in territories outside of ICC member-states; &quot;as a result, anyone who is present in Canada and alleged to have committed genocide, torture ... anywhere, at any time, can be prosecuted [in Canada]&quot;.

===Finland===
François Bazaramba was sentenced to life imprisonment in Finland in 2010 for participation in the Rwandan genocide of 1994.

In 2021 a trial for Gibril Massaquoi, charged with murder, aggravated war crimes and aggravated crimes against humanity in Liberia, started in Finland, with part of the hearings of witnesses to take place in Liberia and Sierra Leone.

===France===

The article 689 of the &quot;code de procédure pénale&quot; states the infractions that can be judged in France when they were committed outside French territory either by French citizens or foreigners. The following infractions may be prosecuted:
* Torture
* Terrorism
* Nuclear smuggling
* Naval piracy
* Airplane hijacking

In February 2019, Abdulhamid Chaban, a former soldier of the Syrian Army, was arrested and indicted for complicity in crimes against humanity during the Syrian civil war, whereas Majdi Nema, a former spokesperson for Jaysh al-Islam, was arrested and indicted for war crimes and torture, respectively. In May 2023, the French Court of Cassation ruled that French universal jurisdiction allows for a trial of said individuals, and that it was not obligatory that &quot;the offences of crime against humanity or war crime be identically described by the laws of the foreign country&quot;, in this case Syria.

On 15 November 2023, France issued international arrest warrants for Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad and three other Syrian officials for war crimes perpetrated during the 2013 Ghouta chemical attack and the 2018 Douma chemical attack.

On 21 May 2024, a Paris Criminal Court started a trial &quot;in absentia&quot; of Ali Mamlouk, former head of the National Security Bureau, Jamil Hassan, former director of the Air Force intelligence service, and Abdel Salam Mahmoud, former head of investigations for the service, for the deaths of two French-Syrian citizens during the Syrian civil war.

===Germany===
Under the German legal system, international crimes are offenses that require public prosecution () and are not dependent on the victims&#x27; individual criminal complaints to initiate the prosecution.

Nikola Jorgić on 26 September 1997 was convicted of genocide in Germany and sentenced to four terms of life imprisonment for his involvement in the Bosnian genocide. His appeal following his conviction was rejected by the German Federal Court of Justice, Germany&#x27;s highest court of appeal for criminal matters, on 30 April 1999. The court stated that genocide is a crime which all nations must prosecute.

Since then Germany has implemented the principle of universal jurisdiction for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes into its criminal law through the or VStGB (&quot;international criminal code&quot;, literally &quot;book of the criminal law of peoples&quot;), which implemented the treaty creating the International Criminal Court into domestic law. The law was passed in 2002 and up to 2014. It has been used once, in the trial of Rwandan rebel leader Ignace Murwanashyaka. In 2015 he was found guilty and sentenced to 13 years in prison. Furthermore, section 7(2) of German Criminal Code (stGB) establishes the principle of , stating that German criminal law applies to offenses committed abroad by foreign nationals who currently reside in Germany if there is no criminal law jurisdiction in the foreign country or when no extradition request was made.

===Ireland===
===Israel===
The moral philosopher Peter Singer, along with Kenneth Roth, has cited Israel&#x27;s prosecution of Adolf Eichmann in 1961 as an assertion of universal jurisdiction. He claims that while Israel did invoke a statute specific to Nazi crimes against Jews, its Supreme Court claimed universal jurisdiction over crimes against humanity.

Eichmann&#x27;s defense lawyer argued that Israel did not have jurisdiction on account of Israel not having come into existence until 1948. The Genocide Convention also did not come into effect until 1951, and the Genocide Convention does not automatically provide for universal jurisdiction. It is also argued that Israeli agents obtained Eichmann illegally, violating international law when they seized and kidnapped Eichmann, and brought him to Israel to stand trial. The Argentinian government settled the dispute diplomatically with Israel.

Israel argued universal jurisdiction based on the &quot;universal character of the crimes in question&quot; and that the crimes committed by Eichmann were not only in violation of Israel law, but were considered &quot;grave offenses against the law of nations itself&quot;. It also asserted that the crime of genocide is covered under international customary law. As a supplemental form of jurisdiction, a further argument is made on the basis of protective jurisdiction. Protective jurisdiction is a principle that &quot;provides that states may exercise jurisdiction over aliens who have committed an act abroad which is deemed prejudicial to the security of the particular state concerned&quot;.

===Malaysia===
In November 2011, the Kuala Lumpur War Crimes Commission (KLWCC), created in 2007 by former Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad as a private institution (without the support of any government), exercised what it viewed as universal jurisdiction to try and convict &quot;in absentia&quot; former US President George W. Bush and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair for the invasion of Iraq. In May 2012, the tribunal again under what it saw as universal jurisdiction took testimony from victims of torture at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo, and convicted &quot;in absentia&quot; former President Bush, former Vice President Dick Cheney, former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, former Deputy Assistant Attorneys General John Yoo and Jay Bybee, former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, and former counselors David Addington and William Haynes II for conspiracy to commit war crimes. The tribunal referred its findings to the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court in The Hague.

The Malaysian human rights group SUARAM expressed concern about the KLWCC&#x27;s procedures, and former United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers, Param Cumaraswamy, described the KLWCC as having no legal basis, and was sceptical about fair trials taking place &quot;in absentia&quot;.

===Netherlands===
In January 2024, Mustafa A., a member of Liwa al-Quds, was convicted in the Netherlands for war crimes and crimes against humanity carried out during the Syrian civil war while fighting on the side of Syrian government forces. He was sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment.

===Senegal===
A case against the former dictator of Chad, Hissène Habré, started in 2015 in Senegal.

===Spain===
Spanish law recognizes the principle of universal jurisdiction. Article 23.4 of the Judicial Power Organization Act (LOPJ), enacted on 1 July 1985, establishes that Spanish courts have jurisdiction over crimes committed by Spaniards or foreign citizens outside Spain when such crimes can be described according to Spanish criminal law as genocide, terrorism, or some other, as well as any other crime that, according to international treaties or conventions, must be prosecuted in Spain. On 25 July 2009, the Spanish Congress passed a law that limits the competence of the Audiencia Nacional under Article 23.4 to cases in which Spaniards are victims, there is a relevant link to Spain, or the alleged perpetrators are in Spain. The law still has to pass the Senate, the high chamber, but passage is expected because it is supported by both major parties.

In 1999, Nobel Peace Prize winner Rigoberta Menchú brought a case against the Guatemalan military leadership in a Spanish Court. Six officials, among them Efraín Ríos Montt and Óscar Humberto Mejía, were formally charged on 7 July 2006 to appear in the Spanish National Court after Spain&#x27;s Constitutional Court ruled in September 2005, the Spanish Constitutional Court declaration that the &quot;principle of universal jurisdiction prevails over the existence of national interests&quot;, following the Menchu suit brought against the officials for atrocities committed in the Guatemalan Civil War.

In June 2003, Spanish judge Baltasar Garzón jailed Ricardo Miguel Cavallo, a former Argentine naval officer, who was extradited from Mexico to Spain pending his trial on charges of genocide and terrorism relating to the years of Argentina&#x27;s military dictatorship.

On 11 January 2006, the Spanish High Court agreed to investigate a case in which seven former Chinese officials, including the former Communist Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin and former Premier Li Peng were alleged to have participated in a genocide in Tibet. This investigation follows a Spanish Constitutional Court (26 September 2005) ruling that Spanish courts could try genocide cases even if they did not involve Spanish nationals. China denounced the investigation as an interference in its internal affairs and dismissed the allegations as &quot;sheer fabrication&quot;. The case was shelved in 2010, because of a law passed in 2009 that restricted High Court investigations to those &quot;involving Spanish victims, suspects who are in Spain, or some other obvious link with Spain&quot;.

Complaints were lodged against former Israeli Defense Forces chief of General Staff Lt.-Gen. (res.) Dan Halutz and six other senior Israeli political and military officials by pro-Palestinian organizations, who sought to prosecute them in Spain under the principle of universal jurisdiction. On 29 January 2009, Fernando Andreu, a judge of the Audiencia Nacional, opened preliminary investigations into claims that a targeted killing attack in Gaza in 2002 warranted the prosecution of Halutz, the former Israeli defence minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, the former defence chief-of-staff Moshe Ya&#x27;alon, and four others, for crimes against humanity. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu strongly criticized the decision, and Israeli officials refused to provide information requested by the Spanish court. The attack killed the founder and leader of the military wing of the Islamic militant organisation Hamas, Salah Shehade, who Israel said was responsible for hundreds of civilian deaths. The attack also killed 14 others (including his wife and 9 children). It had targeted the building where Shahade hid in Gaza City. It also wounded some 150 Palestinians, according to the complaint (or 50, according to other reports). The Israeli chief of operations and prime minister apologized officially, saying they were unaware, due to faulty intelligence, that civilians were in the house. The investigation in the case was halted on 30 June 2009 by a decision of a panel of 18 judges of the Audiencia Nacional. The Spanish Court of Appeals rejected the lower court&#x27;s decision, and on appeal in April 2010 the Supreme Court of Spain upheld the Court of Appeals decision against conducting an official inquiry into the IDF&#x27;s targeted killing of Shehadeh.

===Sweden===
Universal jurisdiction was used in Sweden for the trial of Hamid Nouri for involvement in the 1988 executions of Iranian political prisoners. In 2022, Nouri was sentenced to a life in prison.

In April 2024, a Swedish court started a trial of Syrian Brigadier general Mohammed Hamo for indiscriminate attacks against civilians in Homs during the Syrian civil war.

===Switzerland===
On 18 June 2021, former ULIMO commander Alieu Kosiah was sentenced to 20 years in prison for committing war crimes in Liberia during the country&#x27;s first civil war. This was the first time that a Liberian national was tried for war crimes in relation to the Liberian Civil Wars, and the first time that the Swiss Federal Criminal Court held a war crimes trial.

On 18 April 2023, the Swiss Attorney General declared that Ousman Sonko, a former Interior Minister of the Gambia, had been charged with crimes against humanity. He was accused of &quot;having supported, participated in and failed to prevent &#x27;systematic and generalised attacks&#x27; as part of a repressive campaign by security forces against Jammeh&#x27;s opponents&quot;.

===Turkey===
In January 2022, when filing a criminal case in the Istanbul Prosecutor&#x27;s Office against Chinese officials for torture, rape, crimes against humanity and genocide against Uyghurs, lawyer Gulden Sonmez stated that Turkish legislation recognises universal jurisdiction for these offences.

===United Kingdom===

An offence is generally only triable in the jurisdiction where the offence took place, unless a specific statute enables the UK to exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction. This is the case, &quot;inter alia&quot;, for:
* Torture (s. 134 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988)
* Sexual offences against children (s. 72 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003, formerly Sexual Offences Act 1956)
* Fraud and dishonesty (Criminal Justice Act 1993 Part 1)
* Terrorism (ss. 59, 62–63 of the Terrorism Act 2000)
* Bribery (was s. 109 of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001, now s. 12 of the Bribery Act 2010)
* Human trafficking and sexual exploitation (s. 2 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015, ss. 52–54 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003, and several earlier acts)

In December 2009, Westminster Magistrates&#x27; Court issued an arrest warrant for Tzipi Livni in connection with accusations of war crimes in the Gaza Strip during Operation Cast Lead (2008–2009). The warrant was issued on 12 December and revoked on 14 December 2009 after it was revealed that Livni had not entered British territory. The warrant was later denounced as &quot;cynical&quot; by the Israeli foreign ministry, while Livni&#x27;s office said she was &quot;proud of all her decisions in Operation Cast Lead&quot;. Livni herself called the arrest warrant &quot;an abuse of the British legal system&quot;. Similarly a January visit to Britain by a team of Israel Defense Forces (IDF) was cancelled over concerns that arrest warrants would be sought by pro-Palestinian advocates in connection with allegations of war crimes under laws of universal jurisdiction.

In January 2013, Nepalese Colonel Kumar Lama was charged in the UK with torture under universal jurisdiction. He was acquitted in September 2016, with the jury finding him not guilty on one count, and failing to reach a verdict on the other.

===United States===
The United States has no formal statute to authorize it. In some cases, however, the federal government has exercised self-help in the apprehension or killing persons who are suspected of conspiring to commit crimes within the United States from outside of the country or committing crimes against American officials outside of the United States. This has occurred even when the suspect is not a United States person, has never been to the United States, and even when the person has never conspired or assisted in the commission of a crime within the United States, there is a functioning government which could try the person for the crime committed there, and notwithstanding the existence of a proper treaty of extradition between that country and the United States, ignoring the provisions of the treaty and capturing or killing the person directly.

In 1985, the Mexican national Humberto Alvarez-Machain allegedly assisted in the torture and murder of a United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent in Mexico. Mexico declined to extradite a Mexican national for the alleged crime committed in Mexico, despite having a treaty of extradition. The United States then hired a private citizen and some Mexican nationals as mercenaries to kidnap Alvarez-Machain and take him to the United States for trial. The trial court ruled that his arrest was unlawful because it violated the extradition treaty. On appeal, in &quot;United States v. Alvarez-Machain&quot;, 504 U.S. 655 (1992), the Supreme Court held that, notwithstanding the existence of an extradition treaty with Mexico, it was still legal for the federal government of the United States to exercise self-help by forcibly abducting him on a street in Mexico and bringing him to the United States to stand trial. In Alvarez-Machain&#x27;s subsequent criminal trial, he was acquitted; he later lost a lawsuit against the American government on the grounds of wrongful apprehension and imprisonment.

== By event ==
===2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine===

Universal jurisdiction investigations of war crimes in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine were started under universal jurisdiction legislation of several individual states. States that started investigations included Germany, Lithuania, Spain and Sweden.

== Critiques ==
=== Accessibility of witnesses ===
One of the major logistical issues a court may run into during an application of universal jurisdiction is the accessibility of witnesses. States do not have the legal authority to summon witnesses who currently reside abroad to appear before their national courts, nor do they always have access to the necessary witnesses or evidence needed to implicate a foreign national of crimes against humanity.

<doc id="48644" wikidata="Q8080" url="?curid=48644" title="1896 Summer Olympics">
<text>The 1896 Summer Olympics (), officially known as the Games of the I Olympiad () and commonly known as Athens 1896 (), were the first international Olympic Games held in modern history. Organised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which had been created by French aristocrat Pierre de Coubertin, the event was held in Athens, Greece, from 6 to 15 April 1896.

Fourteen nations (according to the IOC, though the number is subject to interpretation) and 241 athletes (all males; this number is also disputed) took part in the games. Participants were all European or living in Europe, with the exception of the United States team, and over 65% of the competing athletes were Greek. Winners were given a silver medal, while runners-up received a copper medal. Retroactively, the IOC has converted these to gold and silver, respectively, and awarded bronze medals to third-placed athletes. Ten of the 14 participating nations earned medals. On April 6, 1896, American James Connolly became the first Olympic medalist in more than 1,500 years, competing in the triple jump. The United States won the most gold medals, 11, while host nation Greece won the most medals overall, 47. The highlight for the Greeks was the marathon victory by their compatriot Spyridon Louis. The most successful competitor was German wrestler and gymnast Carl Schuhmann, who won four events.

Athens had been unanimously chosen to stage the inaugural modern Games during a congress organised by Coubertin in Paris on 23 June 1894 (during which the IOC was also created) because Greece was the birthplace of the Ancient Olympic Games. The main venue was the Panathenaic Stadium, where athletics and wrestling took place; other venues included the Neo Phaliron Velodrome for cycling and the Zappeion for fencing. The opening ceremony was held in the Panathenaic Stadium on 6 April, during which most of the competing athletes were aligned on the infield, grouped by nation. After a speech by the president of the organising committee, Crown Prince Constantine, his father officially opened the Games. Afterwards, nine bands and 150 choir singers performed an Olympic Hymn, composed by Spyridon Samaras and written by Kostis Palamas.

The 1896 Olympics were regarded as a great success. The Games had the largest international participation of any sporting event to that date. The Panathenaic Stadium overflowed with the largest crowd ever to watch a sporting event. After the Games, Coubertin and the IOC were petitioned by several prominent figures, including Greece&#x27;s King George and some of the American competitors in Athens, to hold all the following Games in Athens. However, the 1900 Summer Olympics were already planned for Paris, and, with the exception of the Intercalated Games of 1906, the Olympics did not return to Greece until the 2004 Summer Olympics, 108 years later.

== Reviving the Games ==

During the 19th century, several small-scale sports festivals across Europe were named after the Ancient Olympic Games. The 1870 Olympics at the Panathenaic stadium, which had been refurbished for the occasion, had an audience of 30,000 people. Pierre de Coubertin, a French pedagogue and historian, adopted William Penny Brookes&#x27; idea to establish a multi-national and multi-sport event—the ancient games only allowed male athletes of Greek origin to participate. In 1890, Coubertin wrote an article in &quot;La Revue Athlétique&quot;, which espoused the importance of Much Wenlock, a rural market town in the English county of Shropshire. It was here that, in October 1850, the local physician William Penny Brookes founded the Wenlock Olympian Games, a festival of sports and recreations that included athletics and team sports, such as cricket, football and quoits. Coubertin also took inspiration from the earlier Greek games organised under the name of Olympics by businessman and philanthropist Evangelis Zappas in 1859, 1870 and 1875. The 1896 Athens Games were funded by the legacies of Evangelis Zappas and his cousin Konstantinos Zappas and by George Averoff who had been specifically requested by the Greek government, through crown prince Constantine, to sponsor the second refurbishment of the Panathenaic Stadium. The Greek government did this despite the cost of refurbishing the stadium in marble already being funded in full by Evangelis Zappas forty years earlier.

On 18 June 1894, Coubertin organised a congress at the Sorbonne, Paris, to present his plans to representatives of sports societies from 11 countries. Following his proposal&#x27;s acceptance by the congress, a date for the first modern Olympic Games needed to be chosen. Coubertin suggested that the Games be held concurrently with the 1900 Universal Exposition of Paris. Concerned that a six-year waiting period might lessen public interest, congress members opted instead to hold the inaugural Games in 1896. With a date established, members of the congress turned their attention to the selection of a host city. It remains a mystery how Athens was finally chosen to host the inaugural Games. In the following years, both Coubertin and Demetrius Vikelas would offer recollections of the selection process that contradicted the official minutes of the congress. Most accounts hold that several congressmen first proposed London as the location, but Coubertin dissented. After a brief discussion with Vikelas, who represented Greece, Coubertin suggested Athens. Vikelas made the Athens proposal official on 23 June, and since Greece had been the original home of the Olympics, the congress unanimously approved the decision. Vikelas was then elected the first president of the newly established International Olympic Committee (IOC).

== Organization ==

News that the Olympic Games would return to Greece was well received by the Greek public, media, and royal family. According to Coubertin, &quot;the Crown Prince Constantine learned with great pleasure that the Games will be inaugurated in Athens.&quot; Coubertin went on to confirm that, &quot;the King and the Crown Prince will confer their patronage on the holding of these games.&quot; Constantine later conferred more than that; he eagerly assumed the presidency of the 1896 organising committee.

However, the country had financial troubles and was in political turmoil. The job of prime minister alternated between Charilaos Trikoupis and Theodoros Deligiannis frequently during the last years of the 19th century. Because of this financial and political instability, both prime minister Trikoupis and Stephanos Dragoumis, the president of the Zappas Olympic Committee, which had attempted to organise a series of national Olympiads, believed that Greece could not host the event. In late 1894, the organising committee under Stephanos Skouloudis presented a report that the cost of the Games would be three times higher than originally estimated by Coubertin. They concluded the Games could not be held and offered their resignation. The total cost of the Games was 3,740,000 gold drachmas.

With the prospect of reviving the Olympic games very much in doubt, Coubertin and Vikelas commenced a campaign to keep the Olympic movement alive. Their efforts culminated on 7 January 1895 when Vikelas announced that crown prince Constantine would assume the presidency of the organising committee. His first responsibility was to raise the funds necessary to host the Games. He relied on the patriotism of the Greek people to motivate them to provide the required finances. Constantine&#x27;s enthusiasm sparked a wave of contributions from the Greek public. This grassroots effort raised 330,000 drachmas. A special set of postage stamps was commissioned; the sale of which raised 400,000 drachmas. Ticket sales added 200,000 drachmas. At the request of Constantine, businessman George Averoff agreed to pay for the restoration of the Panathenaic Stadium. Averoff would donate 920,000 drachmas to this project. As a tribute to his generosity, a statue of Averoff was constructed and unveiled on 5 April 1896 outside the stadium. It stands there to this day.

Some of the athletes would take part in the Games because they happened to be in Athens at the time the Games were held, either on holiday or for work (e.g., some of the British competitors worked for the British embassy). A designated Olympic Village for the athletes did not appear until the 1932 Summer Olympics. Consequently, the athletes had to provide their own lodging.

The first regulation voted on by the new IOC in 1894 was to allow only amateur athletes to participate in the Olympic Games. The various contests were thus held under amateur regulations with the exception of fencing matches. The rules and regulations were not uniform, so the Organising Committee had to choose among the codes of the various national athletic associations. The jury, the referees and the game director bore the same names as in antiquity (&quot;Ephor&quot;, &quot;Helanodic&quot; and &quot;Alitarc&quot;). Prince George acted as final referee; according to Coubertin, &quot;his presence gave weight and authority to the decisions of the ephors&quot;.

Women were not entitled to compete at the 1896 Summer Olympics, because de Coubertin felt that their inclusion would be &quot;impractical, uninteresting, unaesthetic and incorrect&quot;.

== Venues ==
Seven venues were used for the 1896 Summer Olympics. Panathenaic Stadium was the main venue, hosting four of the nine sports contested. The town of Marathon served as host to the marathon event and the individual road race events. Swimming was held in the Bay of Zea, fencing at the Zappeion, sport shooting at Kallithea, and tennis at the Athens Lawn Tennis Club. Tennis was a sport unfamiliar to Greeks at the time of the 1896 Games.

The Bay of Zea is a seaport and marina in the Athens area; it was used as the swimming venue because the organizers of the Games wanted to avoid spending money on constructing a special purpose swimming venue.

Four of the 1896 venues were reused as competition venues for the 2004 Games. The velodrome would be renovated into a football stadium in 1964 and was known as Karaiskakis Stadium. This venue was renovated in 2003 for use as a football venue for the 2004 Games. During the 2004 Games, Panathinaiko Stadium served as host for archery competitions and was the finish line for the athletic marathon event. The city of Marathon itself served as the starting point for both marathon events during the 2004 Games. The Zappeion served as the first home of the organizing committee (ATHOC) for the 2004 Games from 1998 to 1999, and served as the main communications center during those Games.

&lt;section end=&quot;Calendar&quot;/&gt;

== Opening ceremony ==

On Easter Monday 6 April (25 March according to the Julian calendar used in Greece until 1923), the games of the First Olympiad were officially opened. The Panathenaic Stadium was filled with an estimated 80,000 spectators, including King George I of Greece, his wife Olga, and their sons. Most of the competing athletes were aligned on the infield, grouped by nation. After a speech by the president of the organising committee, Crown Prince Constantine, his father officially opened the Games with the words (in Greek):

Afterwards, nine bands and 150 choir singers performed an Olympic Hymn, composed by Spyridon Samaras, with words by poet Kostis Palamas. Thereafter, a variety of musical offerings provided the backgrounds to the Opening Ceremonies until 1960, since which time the Samaras/Palamas composition has become the official Olympic Anthem (decision taken by the IOC Session in 1958). Other elements of current Olympic opening ceremonies were initiated later: the Olympic flame was first lit in 1928, the first athletes&#x27; oath was sworn at the 1920 Summer Olympics, and the first officials&#x27; oath was taken at the 1972 Olympic Games.

== Events ==
At the 1894 Sorbonne Congress, a large roster of sports was suggested for the program in Athens. 

The first official announcements regarding the sporting events to be held featured sports such as football and cricket, but these plans were not finalised, and these sports did not make the final program for the Games. Rowing and sailing events were also scheduled but were cancelled on the planned days of competition: sailing due to a lack of special boats in Greece and no foreign entries, and rowing due to poor weather. 

As a result, the 1896 Summer Olympics programme featured 9 sports encompassing 10 disciplines and 43 events. The number of events in each discipline is noted in parentheses.

=== Athletics ===
The athletics events had the most international field of any of the sports. The major highlight was the marathon, held for the first time in international competition. Spyridon Louis, a previously unrecognised water carrier, won the event to become the only Greek athletics champion and a national hero. Although Greece had been favoured to win the discus and the shot put, the best Greek athletes finished just behind the American Robert Garrett in both events.

No world records were set, as few top international competitors had elected to compete. In addition, the curves of the track were very tight, making fast times in the running events virtually impossible. Despite this, Thomas Burke, of the United States, won the 100-meter race in 12.0 seconds and the 400-meter race in 54.2 seconds. Burke was the only one who used the &quot;crouch start&quot; (putting his knee on soil), confusing the jury. Eventually, he was allowed to start from this &quot;uncomfortable position&quot;.



Chile claims one athlete, Luis Subercaseaux, who competed for the nation at the 1896 Summer Olympics. This makes Chile one of the 14 nations to appear at the inaugural Summer Olympic Games. Subercaseaux&#x27;s results are not listed in the official report, though that report typically includes only winners and Subercaseaux won no medals. Some sources claim that he was entered to compete in the 100m, 400m and 800m events but did not start. An appraisal of a famous photo of series 2 of the 100 meters sprint, performed by facial recognition experts of the Chilean forensic police, concluded that Subercaseaux was one of the participants.

The day after the official marathon, Stamata Revithi ran the 40-kilometer course in 5 hours 30 minutes, finishing outside Panathinaiko Stadium. However, some of the authors, who believe that &quot;Melpomene&quot; and Revithi are the same person, attribute to the latter the more favorable time of  hours. She was denied entry into the official race as the 1896 Olympics excluded women from competition.

=== Cycling ===
The rules of the International Cycling Association were used for the cycling competitions. The track cycling events were held at the newly built Neo Phaliron Velodrome. Only one road event was held, a race from Athens to Marathon and back (87 kilometres).

In the track events, the best cyclist was Frenchman Paul Masson, who won the one lap time trial, the sprint event, and the 10,000 meters. In the 100 kilometres event, Masson entered as a pacemaker for his compatriot Léon Flameng. Flameng won the event, after a fall, and after stopping to wait for his Greek opponent Georgios Kolettis to fix a mechanical problem. The Austrian fencer Adolf Schmal won the 12-hour race, which was completed by only two cyclists, while the road race event was won by Aristidis Konstantinidis.

=== Fencing ===
The fencing events were held in the Zappeion, which, built with money Evangelis Zappas had given to revive the ancient Olympic Games, had never seen any athletic contests before. Unlike other sports (in which only amateurs were allowed to take part at the Olympics), professionals were authorised to compete in fencing, though in a separate event. These professionals were considered gentlemen athletes, just like the amateurs.

Four events were scheduled, but the épée event was cancelled for unknown reasons. The foil event was won by a Frenchman, Eugène-Henri Gravelotte, who beat his countryman, Henri Callot, in the final. The other two events, the sabre and the masters foil, were won by Greek fencers. Leonidas Pyrgos, who won the latter event, became the first Greek Olympic champion in the modern era.

=== Gymnastics ===
The gymnastics competition was carried out on the infield of the Panathinaiko Stadium. Germany sent an 11-man team, which won five of the eight events, including both team events: in the team event on the horizontal bar, the German team was the only entry.

Three Germans added individual titles: Hermann Weingärtner won the horizontal bar event, Alfred Flatow won the parallel bars, and Carl Schuhmann, who also won the wrestling event, won the vault. Louis Zutter, a Swiss gymnast, won the pommel horse, while Greeks Ioannis Mitropoulos and Nikolaos Andriakopoulos were victorious in the rings and rope climbing events, respectively.

=== Sailing and rowing ===

A regatta of sailing boats was on the program of the Games of the First Olympiad for 31 March 1896 (Julian calendar). However this event had to be given up.

The official English report states:

The German version states:

Rowing races were scheduled for the next day, 1 April 1896 (Julian); however, poor weather forced their cancellation.

The official English report states:

The German rower, Berthold Küttner, wrote several articles about the 1896 Games that were published in his Berlin rowing club&#x27;s magazine in 1936 and reprinted in the Journal of Olympic History in 2012. He stated that he and Adolf Jäger had lined up for the start of the double sculls event. He further wrote that &quot;The double scull would be the first to start because the wind had become much stronger. On a fishing boat we took our double scull to the starting line. We already had problems getting into the double scull because of the swells. From our opponents no one had appeared – although both Greeks and Italians had applied. Because a longer wait for them seemed pointless, the starter told us to sail without competition.

&quot;After the official salutation and presentation in the Court Loge, where many of the attendees could not hide a laugh about my clothing, Prince George, President of the Committee, praised me for our appearance at the racing track and presented me with the winners medal in bronze. At the same time he also gave me one for &quot;Bundesbruder&quot; Jäger. The commemorative medal, which each of the participants received, had already been presented to us earlier.&quot;

He went on to state that the single sculls and race for naval boats were postponed until the following day, then ultimately cancelled when the weather worsened. The International Olympic Committee does not recognize any of this.

=== Shooting ===
Held at a range at Kallithea, the shooting competition consisted of five events—two using a rifle and three with the pistol. The first event, the military rifle, was won by Pantelis Karasevdas, the only competitor to hit the target with all of his shots. The second event, for military pistols, was dominated by two American brothers: John and Sumner Paine. They became the first siblings to finish first and second in the same event. To avoid embarrassing their hosts, the brothers decided that only one of them would compete in the next pistol event, the free pistol. Sumner Paine won that event, thereby becoming the first relative of an Olympic champion to become Olympic champion himself.

The Paine brothers did not compete in the 25-meter pistol event, as the event judges determined that their weapons were not of the required calibre. In their absence, Ioannis Phrangoudis won. The final event, the free rifle, began on the same day. However, the event could not be completed due to darkness and was finalised the next morning, when Georgios Orphanidis was crowned the champion.

=== Swimming ===


The swimming competition was held in the open sea because the organizers had refused to spend the money necessary for a specially constructed stadium. Nearly 20,000 spectators lined the Bay of Zea off the Piraeus coast to watch the events. The water in the bay was cold, and the competitors suffered during their races. There were three open events (men&#x27;s 100-metre freestyle, men&#x27;s 500-metre freestyle, and men&#x27;s 1200 metre freestyle), in addition to a special event open only to Greek sailors, all of which were held on the same day (11 April).

For Alfréd Hajós of Hungary, this meant he could only compete in two of the events, as they were held too close together, which made it impossible for him to adequately recuperate. Nevertheless, he won the two events in which he swam, the 100 and 1200 meter freestyle. Hajós later became one of only two Olympians to win a medal in both the athletic and artistic competitions, when he won a silver medal for architecture in 1924. The 500-meter freestyle was won by Austrian swimmer Paul Neumann, who defeated his opponents by more than a minute and a half.

=== Tennis ===
Although tennis was already a major sport by the end of the 19th century, none of the top players turned up for the tournament in Athens. The competition was held at the courts of the Athens Lawn Tennis Club, and the infield of the velodrome used for the cycling events. John Pius Boland, who won the event, had been entered in the competition by a fellow-student of his at Oxford; the Greek, Konstantinos Manos. As a member of the Athens Lawn Tennis sub-committee, Manos had been trying, with the assistance of Boland, to recruit competitors for the Athens Games from among the sporting circles of Oxford University. In the first round, Boland defeated Friedrich Traun, a promising tennis player from Hamburg, who had been eliminated in the 100-meter sprint competition. Boland and Traun decided to team up for the doubles event, in which they reached the final and defeated their Greek opponents after losing the first set.

=== Weightlifting ===


The sport of weightlifting was still young in 1896, and the rules differed from those in use today. Competitions were held outdoors, in the infield of the main stadium, and there were no weight limits. The first event was held in a style now known as the &quot;clean and jerk&quot;. Two competitors stood out: Briton Launceston Elliot and Viggo Jensen of Denmark. Both of them lifted the same weight, but the jury, with Prince George as the chairman, ruled that Jensen had done so in a better style. The British delegation, unfamiliar with this tie-breaking rule, lodged a protest. The lifters were eventually allowed to make further attempts, but neither lifter improved, and Jensen was declared the champion.

Elliot got his revenge in the one hand lift event, which was held immediately after the two-handed one. Jensen had been slightly injured during his last two-handed attempt and was no match for Elliot, who won the competition easily. The Greek audience was charmed by the British victor, whom they considered very attractive. A curious incident occurred during the weightlifting event: a servant was ordered to remove the weights, which appeared to be a difficult task for him. Prince George came to his assistance; he picked up the weight and threw it a considerable distance with ease, to the delight of the crowd.

=== Wrestling ===


No weight classes existed for the wrestling competition, held in the Panathenaic Stadium, which meant that there would only be one winner among competitors of all sizes. The rules used were similar to modern Greco-Roman wrestling, although there was no time limit, and not all leg holds were forbidden (in contrast to current rules).

Apart from the two Greek contestants, all the competitors had previously been active in other sports. Weightlifting champion Launceston Elliot faced gymnastics champion Carl Schuhmann. The latter won and advanced into the final, where he met Georgios Tsitas, who had previously defeated Stephanos Christopoulos. Darkness forced the final match to be suspended after 40 minutes; it was continued the following day, when Schuhmann needed only fifteen minutes to finish the bout.
== Closing ceremony ==

On the morning of Sunday 12 April (or 31 March, according to the Julian calendar then used in Greece), King George organised a banquet for officials and athletes (even though some competitions had not yet been held). During his speech, he made clear that, as far as he was concerned, the Olympics should be held in Athens permanently. The official closing ceremony was held the following Wednesday after being postponed from Tuesday due to rain. Again, the royal family attended the ceremony, which was opened by the national anthem of Greece and an ode composed in ancient Greek by George S. Robertson, a British athlete and scholar.

Afterwards, the king awarded prizes to the winners. Unlike today, the first-place winners received a silver medal, an olive branch and a diploma, while runners-up received a copper medal, a laurel branch and a diploma. Third place winners did not receive a prize.

Some winners also received additional prizes, such as Spyridon Louis, who received a cup from Michel Bréal, a friend of Coubertin, who had conceived the marathon event. Louis then led the medalists on a lap of honour around the stadium, while the Olympic Hymn was played again. The King then formally announced that the first Olympiad was at an end and left the Stadium, while the band played the Greek national hymn and the crowd cheered.

Like the Greek king, many others supported the idea of holding the next Games in Athens; most of the American competitors signed a letter to the Crown Prince expressing this wish. Coubertin, however, was heavily opposed to this idea, as he envisioned international rotation as one of the cornerstones of the modern Olympics. According to his wish, the next Games were held in Paris, although they would be somewhat overshadowed by the concurrent Universal Exposition.

== Participating nations ==


The concept of national teams was not a major part of the Olympic movement until the Intercalated Games 10 years later, though many sources list the nationality of competitors in 1896 and give medal counts. There are significant conflicts with regard to which nations competed. The International Olympic Committee gives a figure of 14, but does not list them. The following 14 are most likely the ones recognised by the IOC. Olympedia lists 13, excluding Chile; other sources list 12, excluding Chile and Bulgaria; others list 13, including those two but excluding Italy. Egypt is also sometimes included because of the participation of Dimitrios Kasdaglis, a Greek national who resided in Alexandria after living in Great Britain for years. Belgium and Russia had entered the names of competitors but withdrew.
===Number of athletes by National Olympic Committees===

National Olympic Committees did not yet exist. Over 65% of all athletes were Greek.

== Medal count ==

Ten of the 14 participating nations earned medals, in addition to two medals won by mixed teams (teams made up of athletes from multiple nations). The IOC has retroactively assigned gold, silver and bronze medals to the three best placed athletes in each event to comport with more recent traditions. In this regard, five of the bronze medalists at the Games are unknown: two in swimming and three in gymnastics.

The United States won the most gold medals (11), while host nation Greece won the most medals overall (47), as well as the most silver (18) and bronze (19) medals, finishing with one fewer gold medal than the United States, though having 155 athletes more than the U.S.

===Podium sweeps===
== Notes ==
* The number of countries, given by the International Olympic Committee, is open to interpretation and could be between 10 and 15. There are numerous reasons for the disparity: national teams hardly existed at the time, with most athletes representing themselves or their clubs, and countries were not always as well-defined as they are today. The number of countries here reflects the number used by most modern sources, including the International Olympic Committee website. See the relevant section for further details.
* The number of competitors given according to the International Olympic Committee. Mallon &amp; Widlund give a total of 245 athletes, while De Wael gives 246. The identities of 179 athletes at the Games are known.

<text>Thai, or Central Thai (historically Siamese; ), is a Tai language of the Kra–Dai language family spoken by the Central Thai, Mon, Lao Wiang, Phuan people in Central Thailand and the vast majority of Thai Chinese enclaves throughout the country. It is the sole official language of Thailand.

Thai is the most spoken of over 60 languages of Thailand by both number of native and overall speakers. Over half of its vocabulary is derived from or borrowed from Pali, Sanskrit, Mon and Old Khmer. It is a tonal and analytic language. Thai has a complex orthography and system of relational markers. Spoken Thai, depending on standard sociolinguistic factors such as age, gender, class, spatial proximity, and the urban/rural divide, is partly mutually intelligible with Lao, Isan, and some fellow Thai topolects. These languages are written with slightly different scripts, but are linguistically similar and effectively form a dialect continuum.

Thai language is spoken by over 69 million people (2020). Moreover, most Thais in the northern (Lanna) and the northeastern (Isan) parts of the country today are bilingual speakers of Central Thai and their respective regional dialects because Central Thai is the language of television, education, news reporting, and all forms of media. A recent research found that the speakers of the Northern Thai language (also known as Phasa Mueang or Kham Mueang) have become so few, as most people in northern Thailand now invariably speak Standard Thai, so that they are now using mostly Central Thai words and only seasoning their speech with the &quot;Kham Mueang&quot; accent. Standard Thai is based on the register of the educated classes by Central Thai and ethnic minorities in the area along the ring surrounding the Metropolis.

In addition to Central Thai, Thailand is home to other related Tai languages. Although most linguists classify these dialects as related but distinct languages, native speakers often identify them as regional variants or dialects of the &quot;same&quot; Thai language, or as &quot;different kinds of Thai&quot;. As a dominant language in all aspects of society in Thailand, Thai initially saw gradual and later widespread adoption as a second language among the country&#x27;s minority ethnic groups from the mid-late Ayutthaya period onward. Ethnic minorities today are predominantly bilingual, speaking Thai alongside their native language or dialect.

== Classification ==

Standard Thai is classified as one of the Chiang Saen languages—others being Northern Thai, Southern Thai and numerous smaller languages, which together with the Northwestern Tai and Lao-Phutai languages, form the Southwestern branch of Tai languages. The Tai languages are a branch of the Kra–Dai language family, which encompasses a large number of indigenous languages spoken in an arc from Hainan and Guangxi south through Laos and Northern Vietnam to the Cambodian border.

Standard Thai is the principal language of education and government and spoken throughout Thailand. The standard is based on the dialect of the central Thai people, and it is written in the Thai script.

== History ==

Thai has undergone various historical sound changes. Some of the most significant changes occurred during the evolution from Old Thai to modern Thai. The Thai writing system has an eight-century history and many of these changes, especially in consonants and tones, are evidenced in the modern orthography.

===Early spread===
According to a Chinese source, during the Ming dynasty, Yingya Shenglan (1405–1433), Ma Huan reported on the language of the Xiānluó (暹羅) or Ayutthaya Kingdom, saying that it somewhat resembled the local patois as pronounced in Guangdong Ayutthaya, the old capital of Thailand from 1351 - 1767 A.D., was from the beginning a bilingual society, speaking Thai and Khmer. Bilingualism must have been strengthened and maintained for some time by the great number of Khmer-speaking captives the Thais took from Angkor Thom after their victories in 1369, 1388 and 1431. Gradually toward the end of the period, a language shift took place. Khmer fell out of use. Both Thai and Khmer descendants whose great-grand parents or earlier ancestors were bilingual came to use only Thai. In the process of language shift, an abundance of Khmer elements were transferred into Thai and permeated all aspects of the language. Consequently, the Thai of the late Ayutthaya Period which later became Ratanakosin or Bangkok Thai, was a thorough mixture of Thai and Khmer. There were more Khmer words in use than Tai cognates. Khmer grammatical rules were used actively to coin new disyllabic and polysyllabic words and phrases. Khmer expressions, sayings, and proverbs were expressed in Thai through transference.

Thais borrowed both the Royal vocabulary and rules to enlarge the vocabulary from Khmer. The Thais later developed the royal vocabulary according to their immediate environment. Thai and Pali, the latter from Theravada Buddhism, were added to the vocabulary. An investigation of the Ayutthaya Rajasap reveals that three languages, Thai, Khmer and Khmero-Indic were at work closely both in formulaic expressions and in normal discourse. In fact, Khmero-Indic may be classified in the same category as Khmer because Indic had been adapted to the Khmer system first before the Thai borrowed.

===Old Thai===

Old Thai had a three-way tone distinction on &quot;live syllables&quot; (those not ending in a stop), with no possible distinction on &quot;dead syllables&quot; (those ending in a stop, i.e. either or the glottal stop that automatically closes syllables otherwise ending in a short vowel).

There was a two-way voiced vs. voiceless distinction among all fricative and sonorant consonants, and up to a four-way distinction among stops and affricates. The maximal four-way occurred in labials () and denti-alveolars (); the three-way distinction among velars () and palatals (), with the glottalized member of each set apparently missing.

The major change between old and modern Thai was due to voicing distinction losses and the concomitant tone split. This may have happened between about 1300 and 1600 CE, possibly occurring at different times in different parts of the Thai-speaking area. All voiced–voiceless pairs of consonants lost the voicing distinction:
*Plain voiced stops () became voiceless aspirated stops ().
*Voiced fricatives became voiceless.
*Voiceless sonorants became voiced.
However, in the process of these mergers, the former distinction of voice was transferred into a new set of tonal distinctions. In essence, every tone in Old Thai split into two new tones, with a lower-pitched tone corresponding to a syllable that formerly began with a voiced consonant, and a higher-pitched tone corresponding to a syllable that formerly began with a voiceless consonant (including glottalized stops). An additional complication is that formerly voiceless unaspirated stops/affricates (original ) also caused original tone 1 to lower, but had no such effect on original tones 2 or 3.

The above consonant mergers and tone splits account for the complex relationship between spelling and sound in modern Thai. Modern &quot;low&quot;-class consonants were voiced in Old Thai, and the terminology &quot;low&quot; reflects the lower tone variants that resulted. Modern &quot;mid&quot;-class consonants were voiceless unaspirated stops or affricates in Old Thai—precisely the class that triggered lowering in original tone 1 but not tones 2 or 3. Modern &quot;high&quot;-class consonants were the remaining voiceless consonants in Old Thai (voiceless fricatives, voiceless sonorants, voiceless aspirated stops). The three most common tone &quot;marks&quot; (the lack of any tone mark, as well as the two marks termed &quot;mai ek&quot; and &quot;mai tho&quot;) represent the three tones of Old Thai, and the complex relationship between tone mark and actual tone is due to the various tonal changes since then. Since the tone split, the tones have changed in actual representation to the point that the former relationship between lower and higher tonal variants has been completely obscured. Furthermore, the six tones that resulted after the three tones of Old Thai were split have since merged into five in standard Thai, with the lower variant of former tone 2 merging with the higher variant of former tone 3, becoming the modern &quot;falling&quot; tone.

==== Old Thai (Sukhothai) consonant inventory ====
==== Historical Sukhothai pronuncation ====
==== Early Old Thai ====

Early Old Thai also apparently had velar fricatives as distinct phonemes. These were represented by the now-obsolete letters ฃ &quot;kho khuat&quot; and ฅ &quot;kho khon&quot;, respectively. During the Old Thai period, these sounds merged into the corresponding stops , and as a result the use of these letters became unstable.

At some point in the history of Thai, an alveolo-palatal nasal phoneme also existed, inherited from Proto-Tai. A letter ญ &quot;yo ying&quot; also exists, which is used to represent an alveolo-palatal nasal in words borrowed from Sanskrit and Pali, and is currently pronounced at the beginning of a syllable but at the end of a syllable. Most native Thai words that are reconstructed as beginning with are also pronounced in modern Thai, but generally spelled with ย &quot;yo yak&quot;, which consistently represents . This suggests that &gt; in native words occurred in the pre-literary period. It is unclear whether Sanskrit and Pali words beginning with were borrowed directly with a , or whether a was re-introduced, followed by a second change &gt; . The northeastern Thai dialect Isan and the Lao language still preserve the phoneme /ɲ/, which is represented in the Lao script by ຍ, such as in the word ຍຸງ (, &quot;mosquito&quot;). This letter is distinct from the phoneme and its Lao letter ຢ, such as in the word ຢາ (, &quot;medicine&quot;). The distinction in writing has been lost in the informal writing of the Isan language with the Thai script and both sounds are represented by ย (See: Comparison of Lao and Isan).

Proto-Tai also had a glottalized palatal sound, reconstructed as in Li Fang-Kuei (1977). Corresponding Thai words are generally spelled หย, which implies an Old Thai pronunciation of (or ), but a few such words are spelled อย, which implies a pronunciation of and suggests that the glottalization may have persisted through to the early literary period.

=== Vowel developments ===
The vowel system of modern Thai contains nine pure vowels and three centering diphthongs, each of which can occur short or long. According to Li (1977), however, many Thai dialects have only one such short–long pair (), and in general it is difficult or impossible to find minimal short–long pairs in Thai that involve vowels other than and where both members have frequent correspondences throughout the Tai languages. More specifically, he notes the following facts about Thai:
*In open syllables, only long vowels occur. (This assumes that all apparent cases of short open syllables are better described as ending in a glottal stop. This makes sense from the lack of tonal distinctions in such syllables, and the glottal stop is also reconstructible across the Tai languages.)
*In closed syllables, the long high vowels are rare, and cases that do exist typically have diphthongs in other Tai languages.
*In closed syllables, both short and long mid and low do occur. However, generally, only words with short and long are reconstructible back to Proto-Tai.
*Both of the mid back unrounded vowels are rare, and words with such sounds generally cannot be reconstructed back to Proto-Tai.
Furthermore, the vowel that corresponds to short Thai has a different and often higher quality in many of the Tai languages compared with the vowel corresponding to Thai .

This leads Li to posit the following:
#Proto-Tai had a system of nine pure vowels with no length distinction, and possessing approximately the same qualities as in modern Thai: high , mid , low .
#All Proto-Tai vowels were lengthened in open syllables, and low vowels were also lengthened in closed syllables.
#Modern Thai largely preserved the original lengths and qualities, but lowered to , which became short in closed syllables and created a phonemic length distinction . Eventually, length in all other vowels became phonemic as well and a new (both short and long) was introduced, through a combination of borrowing and sound change. Li believes that the development of long from diphthongs, and the lowering of to to create a length distinction , had occurred by the time of Proto-Southwestern-Tai, but the other missing modern Thai vowels had not yet developed.

Not all researchers agree with Li. Pittayaporn (2009), for example, reconstructs a similar system for Proto-Southwestern-Tai, but believes that there was also a mid back unrounded vowel (which he describes as ), occurring only before final velar . He also seems to believe that the Proto-Southwestern-Tai vowel length distinctions can be reconstructed back to similar distinctions in Proto-Tai.

== Phonology ==
=== Consonants ===

==== Initials ====
Standard Thai distinguishes three voice-onset times among plosive and affricate consonants:
*voiced
*tenuis (unvoiced, unaspirated)
*aspirated

Where English makes a distinction between voiced and unvoiced aspirated , Thai distinguishes a third sound – the unvoiced, unaspirated that occurs in English only as an allophone of , for example after an as in the sound of the &quot;p&quot; in &quot;spin&quot;. There is similarly a laminal denti-alveolar , , triplet in Thai. In the velar series there is a , pair and in the postalveolar series a , pair, without the corresponding voiced sounds and . (In loanwords from English, English and are borrowed as the tenuis stops and .)

In each cell below, the first line indicates (IPA), the second indicates the Thai characters in initial position (several letters appearing in the same box have identical pronunciation). The letter ห, one of the two &quot;h&quot; letters, is also used to help write certain tones (described below).

==== Finals ====
Although the overall 44 Thai consonant letters provide 21 sounds in case of initials, the case for finals is different. For finals, only eight sounds, as well as no sound, called &quot;mātrā&quot; () are used. To demonstrate, at the end of a syllable, บ () and ด () are devoiced, becoming pronounced as and respectively. Additionally, all plosive sounds are unreleased. Hence, final , , and sounds are pronounced as , , and respectively.

Of the consonant letters, excluding the disused ฃ and ฅ, six (ฉ ผ ฝ ห อ ฮ) cannot be used as a final and the other 36 are grouped as following.

==== Clusters ====
In Thai, each syllable in a word is articulated independently, so consonants from adjacent syllables (i.e. heterosyllabic) show no sign of articulation as a cluster. Thai has specific phonotactical patterns that describe its syllable structure, including tautosyllabic consonant clusters, and vowel sequences. In core Thai words (i.e. excluding loanwords), only clusters of two consonants occur, of which there are 11 combinations:
* (กร), (กล), (กว)
* (ขร, คร), (ขล, คล), (ขว, คว)
* (ปร), (ปล)
* (พร), (ผล, พล)
* (ตร)

The number of clusters increases in loanwords such as (ทร) in (, from Sanskrit &quot;indrā&quot;) or (ฟร) in (, from English &quot;free&quot;); however, these usually only occur in initial position, with either , , or as the second consonant sound and not more than two sounds at a time.

=== Vowels ===
The vowel nuclei of the Thai language are given in the following table. The top entry in every cell is the symbol from the , the second entry gives the spelling in the Thai script, where a dash (–) indicates the position of the initial consonant after which the vowel is pronounced. A second dash indicates that a final consonant follows.

Each vowel quality occurs in long-short pairs: these are distinct phonemes forming distinct words in Thai.

The long-short pairs are as follows:

There are also opening and closing diphthongs in Thai, which analyze as and . For purposes of determining tone, those marked with an asterisk are sometimes classified as long:

Additionally, there are three triphthongs. For purposes of determining tone, those marked with an asterisk are sometimes classified as long:

=== Tones ===

There are five phonemic tones: mid, low, falling, high, and rising, sometimes referred to in older reference works as &quot;rectus, gravis, circumflexus, altus,&quot; and &quot;demissus,&quot; respectively. The table shows an example of both the phonemic tones and their phonetic realization, in the IPA. Moren &amp; Zsiga (2006) and Zsiga &amp; Nitisaroj (2007) provide phonetic and phonological analyses of Thai tone realization.

Notes:
#Five-level tone value: Mid [33], Low [21], Falling [41], High [45], Rising [214]. Traditionally, the high tone was recorded as either [44] or [45]. This remains true for the older generation, but the high tone is changing to [334] among youngsters.
#For the diachronic changes of tone value, see Pittayaporn (2007).
#The full complement of tones exists only in so-called &quot;live syllables&quot;, those that end in a long vowel or a sonorant ().
#For &quot;dead syllables&quot;, those that end in a plosive () or in a short vowel, only three tonal distinctions are possible: low, high, and falling. Because syllables analyzed as ending in a short vowel may have a final glottal stop (especially in slower speech), all &quot;dead syllables&quot; are phonetically checked, and have the reduced tonal inventory characteristic of checked syllables.

==== Unchecked syllables ====
==== Checked syllables ====
In some English loanwords, closed syllables with a long vowel ending in an obstruent sound have a high tone, and closed syllables with a short vowel ending in an obstruent sound have a falling tone.
== Grammar ==
From the perspective of linguistic typology, Thai can be considered to be an analytic language. The word order is subject–verb–object, although the subject is often omitted. Additionally, Thai is an isolating language lacking any form of inflectional morphology whatsoever. Thai pronouns are selected according to the gender and relative status of speaker and audience.

=== Adjectives and adverbs ===
There is no morphological distinction between adverbs and adjectives. Many words can be used in either function. They follow the word they modify, which may be a noun, verb, or another adjective or adverb.

Comparatives take the form &quot;A X B&quot; (, ), &#x27;A is more X than B&#x27;. The superlative is expressed as &quot;A X &quot; (, ), &#x27;A is most X&#x27;.

Adjectives in Thai can be used as complete predicates. Because of this, many words used to indicate tense in verbs (see Verbs:Tense below) may be used to describe adjectives.



:* Remark mostly means &#x27;I am hungry right now&#x27; because normally, () marks the change of a state, but has many other uses as well. For example, in the sentence, (): &#x27;So where are you going?&#x27;, () is used as a discourse particle.

=== Verbs ===
Verbs do not inflect. They do not change with person, tense, voice, mood, or number; nor are there any participles. The language being analytic and case-less, the relationship between subject, direct and indirect object is conveyed through word order and auxiliary verbs. Transitive verbs follow the pattern &quot;subject-verb-object&quot;.

In order to convey tense, aspect and mood (TAM), the Thai verbal system employs auxiliaries and verb serialization. TAM markers are however not obligatory and often left out in colloquial use. In such cases, the precise meaning is determined through context. This results in sentences lacking both TAM markers and overt context being ambiguous and subject to various interpretations.



The sentence can thus be interpreted as &#x27;I am eating there&#x27;, &#x27;I eat there habitually&#x27;, &#x27;I will eat there&#x27; or &#x27;I ate there&#x27;. Aspect markers in Thai have been divided into four distinct groups based on their usage. These markers could appear either before or after the verb. The following list describes some of the most commonly used aspect markers. A number of these aspect markers are also full verbs on their own and carry a distinct meaning. For example () as a full verb means &#x27;to stay, to live or to remain at&#x27;. However, as an auxiliary it can be described as a &quot;temporary aspect&quot; or &quot;continuative marker&quot;.

* Imperfective
** 
** 
* Perfective
* Perfect
** 
* Prospective/Future

The imperfective aspect marker (, , currently) is used before the verb to denote an ongoing action (similar to the &quot;-ing&quot; suffix in English). is commonly interpreted as a progressive aspect marker. Similarly, (, ) is a post-verbal aspect marker which corresponds to the continuative or temporary aspect.

Comparably (, , still) which is used in an incompleted action, and usually cognates in phrase with () or any second marker in common use.

The marker (, ) is usually analyzed as a past tense marker when it occurs before the verb. As a full verb, means &#x27;to get or receive&#x27;. However, when used after a verb, takes on a meaning of potentiality or successful outcome of the main verb.

 (, ; &#x27;already&#x27;) is treated as a marker indicating the perfect aspect. That is to say, marks the event as being completed at the time of reference. has two other meanings in addition to its use as a TAM marker. can either be a conjunction for sequential actions or an archaic word for &#x27;to finish&#x27;.



Future can be indicated by (, ; &#x27;will&#x27;) before the verb or by a time expression indicating the future. For example:

Dative marker (, ; &#x27;give&#x27;) often used in a sentence as prepositional or double objects.



The passive voice is indicated by the insertion of (, ) before the verb. For example:
::This describes an action that is out of the receiver&#x27;s control and, thus, conveys suffering.

Negation is indicated by placing (, ; not) before the verb.
* , () &#x27;He is not hitting&#x27; or &#x27;He doesn&#x27;t hit&#x27;.

Thai exhibits serial verb constructions, where verbs are strung together. Some word combinations are common and may be considered set phrases.



=== Nouns ===
Nouns are uninflected and have no gender; there are no articles. Thai nouns are bare nouns and can be interpreted as singular, plural, definite or indefinite. Some specific nouns are reduplicated to form collectives: (, &#x27;child&#x27;) is often repeated as () to refer to a group of children. The word (, ) may be used as a prefix of a noun or pronoun as a collective to pluralize or emphasise the following word. (, , , &#x27;we&#x27;, masculine; , , emphasised &#x27;we&#x27;; , &#x27;(the) dogs&#x27;). Plurals are expressed by adding classifiers, used as measure words (), in the form of noun-number-classifier:

While in English, such classifiers are usually absent (&quot;four chairs&quot;) or optional (&quot;two bottles of beer&quot; &quot;or&quot; &quot;two beers&quot;), a classifier is almost always used in Thai (hence &quot;chair four item&quot; and &quot;beer two bottle&quot;).

Possession in Thai is indicated by adding the word () in front of the noun or pronoun, but it may often be omitted. For example:


==== Nominal phrases ====
Nominal phrases in Thai often use a special class of words classifiers. As previously mentioned, these classifiers are obligatory for noun phrases containing numerals e.g.

Unlike any numeral, (&#x27;one&#x27;) can mark on both positions of classifier, but in different functions. The post-head one potentially marks a referent as indefinite article.


In the previous example () acts as the classifier in the nominal phrase. This follows the form of noun-cardinal-classifier mentioned above. Classifiers are also required to form quantified noun phrases in Thai with some quantifiers such as (&#x27;all&#x27;), (&#x27;some&#x27;). The examples below are demonstrated using the classifier , which is used for people.


However, classifiers are not utilized for negative quantification. Negative quantification is expressed by the pattern (, ) + NOUN.

=== Demonstratives ===
Thai has three of its distinctions. &quot;Proximal&quot; (, ; &#x27;this/these&#x27;), &quot;medial&quot; (, ; &#x27;that/those&#x27;), and &quot;distal&quot; (, ; &#x27;that/those over there&#x27;) which is rarely used.

It also has different usage of distinguishing the demonstratives by changing tones. In which the pronoun itself used for &quot; (, )&quot;; while &quot; (, )&quot; refers to be modifier placed after the noun, prepositions, classifiers, etc. For example:

Following the word (, ) which plays role as interrogative determiner or pronoun.




The syntax for demonstrative phrases, however, differ from that of cardinals and follow the pattern &quot;noun-classifier-demonstrative&quot;. For example, the noun phrase &quot;this dog&quot; would be expressed in Thai as (literally &#x27;dog (classifier) this&#x27;).

=== Pronouns ===
Subject pronouns are often omitted, with nicknames used where English would use a pronoun. See Thai name#Nicknames for more details. Pronouns, when used, are ranked in honorific registers, and may also make a T–V distinction in relation to kinship and social status. Specialised pronouns are used for royalty, and for Buddhist monks. The following are appropriate for conversational use:

The reflexive pronoun is (), which can mean any of: myself, yourself, ourselves, himself, herself, themselves. This can be mixed with another pronoun to create an intensive pronoun, such as (, lit: I myself) or (, lit: you yourself). Thai also does not have a separate possessive pronoun. Instead, possession is indicated by the particle (). For example, &quot;my mother&quot; is (, lit: mother of I). This particle is often implicit, so the phrase is shortened to (). Plural pronouns can be easily constructed by adding the word () in front of a singular pronoun as in () meaning &#x27;they&#x27; or () meaning the plural sense of &#x27;you&#x27;. The only exception to this is (), which can be used as singular (informal) or plural, but can also be used in the form of (), which is only plural.

Thai has many more pronouns than those listed above. Their usage is full of nuances. For example:

* &quot;&quot; all translate to &quot;I&quot;, but each expresses a different gender, age, politeness, status, or relationship between speaker and listener.
* () can be first person (I), second person (you), or both (we), depending on the context.
* Children or younger female could use or being referred by word () when talking with older person. The word could be both feminine first person (I) and feminine second person (you) and also neuter first and neuter second person for children.
** commonly means rat or mouse, though it also refers to small creatures in general.
* The second person pronoun () (lit: you) is semi-feminine. It is used only when the speaker or the listener (or both) are female. Males usually do not address each other by this pronoun.
* Both () and () are polite neuter second person pronouns. However, () is a feminine derogative third person.
* Instead of a second person pronoun such as (&#x27;you&#x27;), it is much more common for unrelated strangers to call each other or (brother, sister, aunt, uncle, granny).
* To express deference, the second person pronoun is sometimes replaced by a profession, similar to how, in English, presiding judges are always addressed as &quot;your honor&quot; rather than &quot;you&quot;. In Thai, students always address their teachers by , or (each meaning &#x27;teacher&#x27;) rather than (&#x27;you&#x27;). Teachers, monks, and doctors are almost always addressed this way.

=== Particles ===
The particles are often untranslatable words added to the end of a sentence to indicate respect, a request, encouragement or other moods (similar to the use of intonation in English), as well as varying the level of formality. They are not used in elegant (written) Thai. The most common particles indicating respect are (, , with a high tone) when the speaker is a man, and (, , with a falling tone) when the speaker is a woman. Used in a question or a request, the particle (falling tone) is changed to a (high tone).

Other common particles are:

== Register ==
Central Thai is composed of several distinct registers, forms for different social contexts:
* Street or Common Thai (, , spoken Thai): informal, without polite terms of address, as used between close relatives and friends.
* Elegant or Formal Thai (, , written Thai): official and written version, includes respectful terms of address; used in simplified form in newspapers.
* Rhetorical Thai: used for public speaking.
* Religious Thai: (heavily influenced by Sanskrit and Pāli) used when discussing Buddhism or addressing monks.
* Royal Thai (, ): influenced by Khmer, this is used when addressing members of the royal family or describing their activities. (See .)

Most Thais can speak and understand all of these contexts. Street and Elegant Thai are the basis of all conversations. Rhetorical, religious, and royal Thai are taught in schools as part of the national curriculum.

As noted above, Thai has several registers, each having certain usages, such as colloquial, formal, literary, and poetic. Thus, the word &#x27;eat&#x27; can be (; common), (; vulgar), (; vulgar), (; formal), (; formal), (; religious), or (; royal), as illustrated below:

Thailand also uses the distinctive Thai six-hour clock in addition to the 24-hour clock.

== Vocabulary ==

Other than compound words and words of foreign origin, most words are monosyllabic.

Chinese-language influence was strong until the 13th century when the use of Chinese characters was abandoned, and replaced by Sanskrit and Pali scripts. However, the vocabulary of Thai retains many words borrowed from Middle Chinese.

Khmer was used as a prestige language in the early days of the Thai kingdoms which are believed to have been bilingual societies proficient in Thai and Khmer. There are over 2,500 Thai words derived from Khmer, surpassing the number of Tai cognates. These Khmer words span across all semantic fields. Thai scholar Uraisi Varasarin classified them into over 200 sub-categories. As a result, it is impossible for Thais, past and present, to engage in a conversation without incorporating Khmer loanwords in any given topic. The influence is particularly preponderant in regard to royal court terminology.

Later, most vocabulary was borrowed from Sanskrit and Pāli; Buddhist terminology is particularly indebted to these. Indic words have a more formal register, and may be compared to Latin and French borrowings in English. Since the beginning of the 20th century, however, the English language has had the greatest influence, especially for scientific, technical, international, and other modern terms.
=== Arabic-origin ===
=== Chinese-origin ===
From Middle Chinese or Teochew Chinese.
=== English-origin ===
=== French-origin ===
=== Japanese-origin ===
=== Khmer-origin ===
From Old Khmer
=== Malay-origin ===
=== Persian-origin ===
=== Portuguese-origin ===
The Portuguese were the first Western nation to arrive in what is modern-day Thailand in the 16th century during the Ayutthaya period. Their influence in trade, especially weaponry, allowed them to establish a community just outside the capital and practise their faith, as well as exposing and converting the locals to Christianity. Thus, Portuguese words involving trade and religion were introduced and used by the locals.
=== Tamil-origin ===
== Writing system ==
Thai is written in the Thai script, an abugida written from left to right. The language and its script are closely related to the Lao language and script. Most literate Lao are able to read and understand Thai, as more than half of the Thai vocabulary, grammar, intonation, vowels and so forth are common with the Lao language.

The Thais adopted and modified the Khmer script to create their own writing system. While in Thai the pronunciation can largely be inferred from the script, the orthography is complex, with silent letters to preserve original spellings and many letters representing the same sound. While the oldest known inscription in the Khmer language dates from 611 CE, inscriptions in Thai writing began to appear around 1292 CE. Notable features include:

#It is an abugida script, in which the implicit vowel is a short in a syllable without final consonant and a short in a syllable with final consonant.
#Tone markers, if present, are placed above the final onset consonant of the syllable.
#Vowels sounding after an initial consonant can be located before, after, above or below the consonant, or in a combination of these positions.

=== Transcription ===

There is no universally applied method for transcribing Thai into the Latin alphabet. For example, the name of the main airport is transcribed variably as Suvarnabhumi, Suwannaphum, or Suwunnapoom. Guide books, textbooks and dictionaries follow different systems. For this reason, many language courses recommend that learners master the Thai script.

Official standards are the Royal Thai General System of Transcription (RTGS), published by the Royal Institute of Thailand, and the almost identical defined by the International Organization for Standardization. The RTGS system is increasingly used in Thailand by central and local governments, especially for road signs. Its main drawback is that it does not indicate tone or vowel length. As the system is based on pronunciation, not orthography, reconstruction of Thai spelling from RTGS romanisation is not possible.

=== Transliteration ===
The ISO published an international standard for the transliteration of Thai into Roman script in September 2005 (ISO 11940). By adding diacritics to the Latin letters it makes the transcription reversible, making it a true transliteration. Notably, this system is used by Google Translate, although it does not seem to appear in many other contexts, such as textbooks and other instructional media.

<text>Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone is a fantasy novel written by British author J. K. Rowling. It is the first novel in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series and was Rowling&#x27;s début novel. It follows Harry Potter, a young wizard who discovers his magical heritage on his eleventh birthday when he receives a letter of acceptance to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry makes close friends and a few enemies during his first year at the school. With the help of his friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, he faces an attempted comeback by the dark wizard Lord Voldemort, who killed Harry&#x27;s parents but failed to kill Harry when he was just 15 months old.

The book was first published in the United Kingdom on 26 June 1997 by Bloomsbury. It was published in the United States the following year by Scholastic Corporation under the title Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#x27;s Stone. It won most of the British book awards that were judged by children and other awards in the US. The book reached the top of the &quot;New York Times&quot; list of best-selling fiction in August 1999, and stayed near the top of that list for much of 1999 and 2000. It has been translated into at least 73 other languages and made into a feature-length film of the same name, as have all six of its sequels. The novel has sold in excess of 120 million copies, making it the fourth best-selling book of all time.

Most reviews were very favourable, commenting on Rowling&#x27;s imagination, humour, simple, direct style and clever plot construction, although a few complained that the final chapters seemed rushed. The writing has been compared to that of Jane Austen, one of Rowling&#x27;s favourite authors; Roald Dahl, whose works dominated children&#x27;s stories before the appearance of Harry Potter; and the ancient Greek story-teller Homer. While some commentators thought the book looked backward to Victorian and Edwardian boarding school stories, others thought it placed the genre firmly in the modern world by featuring contemporary ethical and social issues, as well as showing overcoming obstacles like bullying.

The &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series has been used as a source of object lessons in educational techniques, sociological analysis, and marketing.

==Plot==
Harry Potter lives with his abusive uncle and aunt, Vernon and Petunia Dursley, and their bullying, spoiled son, Dudley. On Harry&#x27;s eleventh birthday, he learns that he is a wizard. A man named Rubeus Hagrid tells him that he can attend Hogwarts, a school of magic. Hagrid explains that when Harry was an infant, a Dark wizard named Voldemort murdered his parents and tried to kill him as well. However, Voldemort&#x27;s killing curse rebounded and seemingly destroyed him, leaving a lightning bolt-shaped scar on Harry&#x27;s forehead. Unbeknownst to Harry, this event made him famous among wizards.

Hagrid takes Harry to Diagon Alley, where he buys a wand and other school supplies. A month later, Harry takes the Hogwarts Express to Hogwarts. During the journey, he befriends Ron Weasley, a fellow first-year student. The two boys also meet Hermione Granger and have a confrontation with Draco Malfoy. At Hogwarts, a magical Sorting Hat assigns each first-year student to a House. Harry, Ron and Hermione are assigned to Gryffindor, although the Hat considers putting Harry in Slytherin. 

Harry&#x27;s broomstick flying ability earns him a place on the Gryffindor Quidditch team as the Seeker. He develops a dislike for the Potions professor Severus Snape, who seems to hate Harry. One night, Harry and Ron discover a gigantic three-headed dog guarding a trapdoor. The two boys later save Hermione from a troll, after which they begin a friendship with her. During Harry&#x27;s first Quidditch match, his broomstick attempts to throw him off. Snape&#x27;s strange behaviour during the match convinces Hermione that he jinxed Harry&#x27;s broom. On Christmas, Harry receives an anonymous gift – his father&#x27;s invisibility cloak. While using the cloak to explore the school undisturbed, he discovers the Mirror of Erised, which shows the viewer what they most desire. Harry sees his family in the mirror.

Harry, Ron and Hermione learn that the three-headed dog is guarding a magical object called the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone, which grants its user immortality. A centaur named Firenze warns Harry that Voldemort is plotting to steal the Stone to restore his body. When Dumbledore is lured away from Hogwarts, Harry and his friends fear the theft is imminent and descend through the trapdoor to retrieve the artefact. Various obstacles force Ron and Hermione to remain behind while Harry proceeds towards the Stone. He encounters Professor Quirrell, the Defence Against the Dark Arts professor, who explains that he serves Voldemort and that it was he who jinxed Harry&#x27;s broom. Quirrell attempts to retrieve the Stone from the Mirror of Erised, but cannot figure out how. When Harry looks in the Mirror, he feels the Stone drop into his pocket. Quirrell then reveals that Voldemort has possessed his body, and shows Harry Voldemort&#x27;s face on the back of his head. Quirrell attempts to seize the Stone, but his flesh burns upon contact with Harry. As Harry and Quirrell struggle, Harry&#x27;s scar begins hurting and he passes out.

Harry awakens in the school&#x27;s infirmary. The headmaster, Albus Dumbledore, explains that Harry survived because he is protected by a magical charm that was created when his mother died trying to protect him. Quirrell&#x27;s hatred and greed caused him to burn upon contact with Harry, and Voldemort abandoned him to die. Dumbledore also reveals that the Stone has been destroyed. During the school&#x27;s year-end feast, Gryffindor is awarded the House Cup. Harry then returns to the home of the Dursleys for the summer.

== Characters ==

* Harry Potter is an orphan whom Rowling imagined as a &quot;scrawny, black-haired, green eyed and bespectacled boy who didn&#x27;t know he was a wizard.&quot; She developed the series&#x27; story and characters to explain how Harry came to be in this situation and how his life unfolded from there. Apart from the first chapter, the events of this book take place just before and in the year following Harry&#x27;s eleventh birthday. Voldemort&#x27;s attack left a lightning bolt-shaped scar on Harry&#x27;s forehead, which produces stabbing pains whenever Voldemort is present. Harry has a natural talent for Quidditch and became the first person in a century to get on their team in their first year.
* Ron Weasley is Harry&#x27;s age, and Rowling describes him as the ultimate best friend &quot;always there when you need him&quot;. He is freckled, red-haired, and quite tall. He grew up in a fairly large pure-blood family as the sixth born of seven children. Although his family is quite poor, they still live comfortably and happily. His loyalty and bravery in the face of a game of Wizard Chess plays a vital part in finding the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone.
* Hermione Granger, the daughter of an all-Muggle family, is a bossy girl who has apparently memorised most of the textbooks before the start of term. Rowling described Hermione as a &quot;very logical, upright, and good&quot; character with &quot;a lot of insecurity and a great fear of failure beneath her swottiness&quot;. Despite her nagging efforts to keep Harry and Ron out of trouble, she becomes a close friend of the two boys after they save her from a troll and her magical and analytical skills play an important role in finding the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone. She has bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth.
* Neville Longbottom is a plump, diffident boy, so forgetful that his grandmother gives him a Remembrall, to remind him if he forgets something. Neville&#x27;s magical abilities are weak and appeared just in time to save his life when he was eight. Despite his timidity, Neville will fight anyone after some encouragement or if he thinks it is right and important.
* Rubeus Hagrid, a half-giant nearly tall, with tangled black hair and beard, who was expelled from Hogwarts and his wand was snapped in half (resulting in him never to use a wand again), though Professor Dumbledore let him stay on as the school&#x27;s gamekeeper, a job which enables him to give lavish affection, care and even pet names (such as Norbert the dragon) on even the most dangerous of magical creatures. Hagrid is fiercely loyal to Dumbledore and quickly becomes a close friend of Harry, Ron and, later, Hermione, but his carelessness makes him unreliable.
* Professor Albus Dumbledore, a tall, thin man who wears half-moon spectacles and has silver hair and a beard that tucks into his belt, is the headmaster of Hogwarts, and thought to be the only wizard Voldemort fears. Dumbledore, while renowned for his achievements in magic, shrugs off praise, though he is aware of his own brilliance. Rowling described him as the &quot;epitome of goodness&quot;.
* Professor Minerva McGonagall, a tall, severe-looking woman with black hair tied in a tight bun, teaches Transfiguration and is able to transform herself into a cat. She is Deputy Headmistress and Head of Gryffindor House.
* Petunia Dursley, the sister of Harry&#x27;s mother Lily, is a thin woman with a long neck that she uses for spying on the neighbours. As a Muggle, she regards her magical sister as a freak and tries to pretend that she never existed.
* Vernon Dursley, the husband of Petunia Dursley, is a heavily built man whose irascible bluster covers a narrow mind and a fear of anything unusual.
* Dudley Dursley is an overweight, spoilt bully and Harry&#x27;s cousin.
* Draco Malfoy is a slim, pale boy who speaks in a bored drawl. He is arrogant about his skill in Quidditch, and despises anyone who is not a pure-blood wizard and wizards who do not share his views. His parents had supported Voldemort, but changed sides after the dark wizard&#x27;s disappearance, claiming they had been bewitched. Draco avoids direct confrontations and tries to get Harry and his friends into trouble.
* Oliver Wood is Harry&#x27;s Quidditch captain and keeper for the Gryffindor Quidditch team.
* Professor Quirrell is a twitching, stammering, and nervous man who teaches Defence Against the Dark Arts. Reputedly he was a brilliant scholar, but his nerve was shattered by an encounter with vampires. Quirrell wears a turban to conceal the fact that he is voluntarily possessed by Voldemort, whose face appears on the back of Quirrell&#x27;s head.
* Professor Severus Snape, who has a hooked nose, sallow complexion, and greasy black hair, teaches Potions, but would prefer to teach Defence Against the Dark Arts. Snape favours pupils in Slytherin, his own House and seizes every opportunity to humiliate others, especially Harry. Several incidents, beginning with the shooting pain in Harry&#x27;s scar during the start-of-term feast, lead Harry and his friends to think Snape is aiding Voldemort.
* Argus Filch, the school caretaker who knows the school&#x27;s secret passages better than anyone else except, perhaps, the Weasley twins. His cat, Mrs. Norris, aids his constant hunt for misbehaving pupils.

Other members of staff include: the dumpy Herbology teacher and Head of Hufflepuff House Professor Sprout, Professor Flitwick, the tiny and excitable Charms teacher and Head of Ravenclaw House, the soporific History of magic teacher, Professor Binns, a ghost who does not seem to have noticed his own death, and Madam Hooch, the Quidditch coach, who is strict, but a considerate and methodical teacher. The poltergeist Peeves wanders around the castle causing trouble wherever he can.

In the book, Rowling introduces an eclectic cast of characters. The first character to be introduced is Vernon Dursley, Harry&#x27;s uncle. Most of the actions centre on the eponymous hero, Harry Potter, an orphan who escapes his miserable childhood with the Dursley family. Rowling imagined him as a &quot;scrawny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who didn&#x27;t know he was a wizard&quot; and says she transferred part of her pain about losing her mother to him. During the book, Harry makes two close friends, Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger. Ron is described by Rowling as the ultimate best friend, &quot;always there when you need him&quot;. Rowling has described Hermione as a &quot;very logical, upright and good&quot; character with &quot;a lot of insecurity and a great fear of failure beneath her swottiness&quot;.

Rowling also imagined a supporting cast of adults. The headmaster of Hogwarts is the powerful, but kind wizard Albus Dumbledore, who becomes Harry&#x27;s confidant. Rowling described him as &quot;the epitome of goodness&quot;. His right hand is severe Minerva McGonagall, the friendly half-giant Rubeus Hagrid, who saved Harry from the Dursley family and the sinister Severus Snape. Professor Quirrell is also featured in the novel.

The main antagonists are Draco Malfoy, an elitist, bullying classmate, and Lord Voldemort, the most powerful evil wizard who becomes disembodied when he tries to kill baby Harry. According to a 1999 interview with Rowling, the character of Voldemort was created as a literary foil for Harry and his backstory was intentionally not fleshed-out at first:

== Development, publication and reception ==
=== Development ===
The book, which was Rowling&#x27;s debut novel, was written between approximately June 1990 and some time in 1995. In 1990, Jo Rowling, as she preferred to be known, wanted to move with her boyfriend to a flat in Manchester and in her words, &quot;One weekend after flat hunting, I took the train back to London on my own and the idea for Harry Potter fell into my head... A scrawny, little, black-haired, bespectacled boy became more and more of a wizard to me... I began to write &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; that very evening. Although, the first couple of pages look nothing like the finished product.&quot; Then, Rowling&#x27;s mother died and, to cope with her pain, Rowling transferred her own anguish to the orphan Harry. Rowling spent six years working on &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; and after it was accepted by Bloomsbury, she obtained a grant of £8,000 from the Scottish Arts Council, which enabled her to plan the sequels. She sent the book to a literary agent and a publisher and then the second agent she approached spent a year trying to sell the book to publishers, most of whom thought it was too long at about 90,000 words. Barry Cunningham, who was building a portfolio of distinctive fantasies by new authors for Bloomsbury Children&#x27;s Books, recommended accepting the book and the eight-year-old daughter of Bloomsbury&#x27;s chief executive said it was &quot;so much better than anything else&quot;.

=== Publication and reception in the United Kingdom ===
Bloomsbury accepted the book, paying Rowling a £2,500 advance and Cunningham sent proof copies to carefully chosen authors, critics and booksellers in order to obtain comments that could be quoted when the book was launched. He was less concerned about the book&#x27;s length than about its author&#x27;s name, since the title sounded like a boys&#x27; book to him and he believed boys preferred books by male authors. Rowling therefore adopted the pen name J. K. Rowling just before publication.

In June 1997, Bloomsbury published &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; with an initial print run of 500 copies in hardback, three hundred of which were distributed to libraries. Her original name, &quot;Joanne Rowling&quot;, can be found on the copyright page of all British editions until September 1999. (The 1998 first American edition would remove reference to &quot;Joanne&quot; completely.) The short initial print run was standard for first novels and Cunningham hoped booksellers would read the book and recommend it to customers. Examples from this initial print run have sold for as much as US$471,000 in a 2021 Heritage auction. Thomas Taylor created the cover for the first edition.

Lindsey Fraser, who had previously supplied one of the blurb comments, wrote what is thought to be the first published review, in &quot;The Scotsman&quot; on 28 June 1997. She described &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; as &quot;a hugely entertaining thriller&quot; and Rowling as &quot;a first-rate writer for children&quot;. Another early review, in &quot;The Herald&quot;, said: &quot;I have yet to find a child who can put it down.&quot; Newspapers outside Scotland started to notice the book, with glowing reviews in &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; and in September 1997 &quot;Books for Keeps&quot;, a magazine that specialised in children&#x27;s books, gave the novel four stars out of five. &quot;Sunday Times&quot; said: &quot;comparisons to Dahl are, this time, justified&quot;, while &quot;The Guardian&quot; called it &quot;a richly textured novel given lift-off by an inventive wit&quot; and &quot;The Scotsman&quot; said it had &quot;all the makings of a classic&quot;.

In 1997 the UK edition won a National Book Award and a gold medal in the 9- to 11-year-olds category of the Nestlé Smarties Book Prize. The &quot;Smarties&quot; award, which is voted for by children, made the book well known within six months of publication, while most children&#x27;s books have to wait for years. The following year, &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; won almost all the other major British awards that were decided by children. It was also shortlisted for children&#x27;s books awards adjudicated by adults, but did not win. Sandra Beckett commented that books that were popular with children were regarded as undemanding and as not of the highest literary standards – for example, the literary establishment disdained the works of Dahl, an overwhelming favourite of children before the appearance of Rowling&#x27;s books. In 2003, the novel was listed at number 22 on the BBC&#x27;s survey The Big Read.

&quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; won two publishing industry awards given for sales rather than literary merit, the British Book Awards Children&#x27;s Book of the Year and the Booksellers&#x27; Association / &quot;Bookseller&quot; Author of the Year. By March 1999 UK editions had sold just over 300,000 copies and the story was still the UK&#x27;s best-selling title in December 2001. A Braille edition was published in May 1998 by the Scottish Braille Press.

Platform , from which the Hogwarts Express left London, was commemorated in the real-life King&#x27;s Cross railway station with a sign and a trolley apparently passing through the wall.
===US publication and reception===

Scholastic Corporation bought the US rights at the Bologna Book Fair in April 1997 for US$105,000, an unusually high sum for a children&#x27;s book. Scholastic&#x27;s Arthur Levine thought that &quot;philosopher&quot; sounded too archaic for readers and after some discussion (including the proposed title &quot;Harry Potter and the School of Magic&quot;), the American edition was published in September 1998 under the title Rowling suggested, &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#x27;s Stone&quot;. Rowling later said that she regretted this change and would have fought it if she had been in a stronger position at the time. Philip Nel has pointed out that the change lost the connection with alchemy and some other changes lost the meaning of other terms changed in translation, for example from &quot;crumpet&quot; to &quot;muffin&quot;. While Rowling accepted the change from both the British English &quot;mum&quot; and Seamus Finnigan&#x27;s Irish variant &quot;mam&quot; to the American variant &quot;mom&quot; in &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#x27;s Stone&quot;, she vetoed this change in the later books, which was then reversed in later editions of &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;. However, Nel considered that Scholastic&#x27;s translations were considerably more sensitive than most of those imposed on British English books of the time and that some other changes could be regarded as useful copyedits. Since the UK editions of early titles in the series were published months prior to the American versions, some American readers became familiar with the British English versions owing to having bought them from online retailers.
On &quot;BookBrowse&quot;, a site that aggregates book reviews such as media reviews, the book received a from &quot;Critics&#x27; Opinion&quot;. At first the most prestigious reviewers ignored the book, leaving it to book trade and library publications such as &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; and &quot;Booklist&quot;, which examined it only by the entertainment-oriented criteria of children&#x27;s fiction. However, more penetrating specialist reviews (such as one by &quot;Cooperative Children&#x27;s Book Center Choices&quot;, which noted complexity, depth and consistency in the world that Rowling had built) attracted the attention of reviewers in major newspapers. Although &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; and Michael Winerip in &quot;The New York Times&quot; complained that the final chapters were the weakest part of the book, they and most other American reviewers gave glowing praise.
A year later, the US edition was selected as an American Library Association Notable Book, a &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; Best Book of 1998 and a New York Public Library 1998 Best Book of the Year and won &quot;Parenting Magazine&quot; Book of the Year Award for 1998, the &quot;School Library Journal&quot; Best Book of the Year and the American Library Association Best Book for Young Adults. In 2012 it was ranked number 3 on a list of the top 100 children&#x27;s novels published by &quot;School Library Journal&quot;.

In August 1999, &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#x27;s Stone&quot; topped the &quot;New York Times&quot; list of best-selling fiction and stayed near the top of the list for much of 1999 and 2000, until the &quot;New York Times&quot; split its list into children&#x27;s and adult sections under pressure from other publishers who were eager to see their books given higher placings. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; report in December 2001 on cumulative sales of children&#x27;s fiction placed &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#x27;s Stone&quot; 19th among hardbacks (over 5 million copies) and 7th among paperbacks (over 6.6 million copies).

In May 2008, Scholastic announced the creation of a 10th Anniversary Edition of the book that was released on 1 October 2008 to mark the tenth anniversary of the original American release. For the fifteenth anniversary of the books, Scholastic re-released &quot;Sorcerer&#x27;s Stone&quot;, along with the other six novels in the series, with new cover art by Kazu Kibuishi in 2013.

=== Translations ===
By mid-2008, official translations of the book had been published in 67 languages. By November 2017, the book had been translated into 80 languages, the 80th being Lowland Scots. Bloomsbury have published translations in Latin and in Ancient Greek, with the latter being described as &quot;one of the most important pieces of Ancient Greek prose written in many centuries&quot;.

==Style and themes==
Philip Nel highlighted the influence of Jane Austen, whom Rowling has greatly admired since the age of twelve. Both novelists greatly encourage re-reading, because details that look insignificant foreshadow important events or characters much later in the story-line – for example Sirius Black is briefly mentioned near the beginning of &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;, and then becomes a major character in the third to fifth books. Like Austen&#x27;s heroines, Harry often has to re-examine his ideas near the ends of books. Some social behaviour in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books is reminiscent of Austen, for example the excited communal reading of letters. Both authors satirise social behaviour and give characters names that express their personalities. However, in Nel&#x27;s opinion Rowling&#x27;s humour is more based on caricature and the names she invents are more like those found in Charles Dickens&#x27;s stories, and Amanda Cockrell noted that many of these express their owners&#x27; traits through allusions that run from ancient Roman mythology to eighteenth-century German literature. Rowling, like the Narnia series&#x27; author C. S. Lewis, thinks there is no rigid distinction between stories for children and for adults. Nel also noted that, like many good writers for children, Rowling combines literary genresfantasy, young adult fiction, boarding school stories, &quot;Bildungsroman&quot; and many others.

Some reviewers compared &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; to the stories of Roald Dahl, who died in 1990. Many writers since the 1970s had been hailed as his successor, but none had attained anything near his popularity with children and, in a poll conducted shortly after the launch of &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;, seven of the ten most popular children&#x27;s books were by Dahl, including the one in top place. The only other really popular children&#x27;s author of the late 1990s was an American, R. L. Stine. Some of the story elements in &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; resembled parts of Dahl&#x27;s stories. For example, the hero of &quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot; lost his parents and had to live with a pair of unpleasant auntsone fat and one thin rather like Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, who treated Harry as a servant. However Harry Potter was a distinctive creation, able to take on the responsibilities of an adult while remaining a child inside.

Librarian Nancy Knapp and marketing professor Stephen Brown noted the liveliness and detail of descriptions, especially of shop scenes such as Diagon Alley. Tad Brennan commented that Rowling&#x27;s writing resembles that of Homer: &quot;rapid, plain, and direct in expression&quot;. Stephen King admired &quot;the sort of playful details of which only British fantasists seem capable&quot; and concluded that they worked because Rowling enjoys a quick giggle and then moves briskly forward.

Nicholas Tucker described the early &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books as looking back to Victorian and Edwardian children&#x27;s stories: Hogwarts was an old-style boarding school in which the teachers addressed pupils formally by their surnames and were most concerned with the reputations of the houses with which they were associated; characters&#x27; personalities were plainly shown by their appearances, starting with the Dursleys; evil or malicious characters were to be crushed rather than reformed, including Argus Filch&#x27;s cat Mrs Norris; and the hero, a mistreated orphan who found his true place in life, was charismatic and good at sports, but considerate and protective towards the weak. Several other commentators have stated that the books present a highly stratified society including many social stereotypes. However Karin Westerman drew parallels with 1990s Britain: a class system that was breaking down but defended by those whose power and status it upheld; the multi-ethnic composition of Hogwarts&#x27; students; the racial tensions between the various intelligent species; and school bullying.

Susan Hall wrote that there is no rule of law in the books, as the actions of Ministry of Magic officials are unconstrained by laws, accountability or any kind of legal challenge. This provides an opportunity for Voldemort to offer his own horrific version of order. As a side-effect Harry and Hermione, who were brought up in the highly regulated Muggle world, find solutions by thinking in ways unfamiliar to wizards. For example, Hermione notes that one obstacle to finding the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone is a test of logic rather than magical power, and that most wizards have no chance of solving it.

Nel suggested that the unflattering characterisation of the extremely conventional, status-conscious, materialistic Dursleys was Rowling&#x27;s reaction to the family policies of the British government in the early 1990s, which treated the married heterosexual couple as the &quot;preferred norm&quot;, while the author was a single mother. Harry&#x27;s relationships with adult and juvenile wizards are based on affection and loyalty. This is reflected in his happiness whenever he is a temporary member of the Weasley family throughout the series, and in his treatment of first Rubeus Hagrid and later Remus Lupin and Sirius Black as father-figures.

== Legacy ==
=== Sequels ===
The second book, &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot;, was originally published in the UK on 2 July 1998 and later, in the US on 2 June 1999. &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; was then published a year later in the UK on 8 July 1999 and in the US on 8 September 1999. &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; was published on 8 July 2000 at the same time by Bloomsbury and Scholastic. &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot; is the longest book in the series at 766 pages in the UK version and 870 pages in the US version. It was published worldwide in English on 21 June 2003. &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot; was published on 16 July 2005 and sold 11 million copies in the first 24 hours of its worldwide release. The seventh and final novel, &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot;, was published on 21 July 2007. The book sold 11 million copies within 24 hours of its release: 2.7 million copies in the UK and 8.3 million in the US.

=== Illustrated version ===
An illustrated version of &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; was released on 6 October 2015, with illustrations by Jim Kay. The book carries over 100 illustrations and will be followed by illustrated versions of all seven books from the series by the same artist.

=== Podcast version ===
In May 2020, a reading podcast by Spotify was created and entitled &quot;Harry Potter at Home: Readings&quot;. Each chapter is narrated by a celebrity guest from the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; and &quot;Wizarding World&quot; franchises.

=== Film adaptation ===
In 1999, Rowling sold the film rights of the first two &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books to Warner Bros. for a reported £1 million. Rowling demanded that the principal cast be kept strictly British, but allowed for the casting of Irish actors such as Richard Harris as Dumbledore and of foreign actors as characters of the same nationalities in later books. After extensive casting, filming began in September 2000 at Leavesden Film Studios and in London, with production ending in July 2001. &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; was released in London on 14 November 2001. Reviewers&#x27; comments were positive, as reflected by an 81% Fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes and by a score of 65% at Metacritic, representing &quot;generally favourable reviews&quot;.

=== Video games ===
Five unique video games by different developers were released between 2001 and 2003 by Electronic Arts, that were loosely based on the film and book:

=== Uses in education and business ===
Writers on education and business subjects have used the book as an . Writing about clinical teaching in medical schools, Jennifer Conn contrasted Snape&#x27;s technical expertise with his intimidating behaviour towards students. Quidditch coach Madam Hooch on the other hand illustrated useful techniques in the teaching of physical skills, including breaking down complex actions into sequences of simple ones and helping students to avoid common errors. Joyce Fields wrote that the books illustrate four of the five main topics in a typical first-year sociology class: &quot;sociological concepts including culture, society, and socialisation; stratification and social inequality; social institutions; and social theory&quot;.

Stephen Brown noted that the early &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books, especially &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;, were a runaway success despite inadequate and poorly organised marketing. Brown advised marketing executives to be less preoccupied with rigorous statistical analyses and the &quot;analysis, planning, implementation, and control&quot; model of management. Instead he recommended that they should treat the stories as &quot;a marketing masterclass&quot;, full of enticing products and brand names. For example, a real-world analogue of Bertie Bott&#x27;s Every Flavour Beans was introduced under licence in 2000 by toymaker Hasbro.

<text>Fritigern (fl. 370s) was a Thervingian Gothic chieftain whose decisive victory at Adrianople during the Gothic War (376–382) led to favourable terms for the Goths when peace was made with Gratian and Theodosius I in 382.

==Name==
&quot;Fritigern&quot; appears in the Latinized form &quot;Fritigernus&quot;.
The Gothic name is reconstructed as *&quot;Frithugairns&quot; &quot;desiring peace&quot;.
The Germanized name under which Fritigern is honored in the Walhalla temple (1842) is &quot;Friediger&quot;.

==Conflicts against Athanaric==

The earliest references to Fritigern concern the period between 
the attack on the Thervingi by Valens (367/9) and 
the Hunnic raids on the Thervingi (ca. 376). 
In this time, a civil war may have broken out between Fritigern and Athanaric, a prominent Therving ruler. 
The conflict between Fritigern and Athanaric is mentioned by 
Socrates Scholasticus, Sozomen, and Zosimus, but not by Ammianus Marcellinus and Philostorgius.
Before or during this civil war, Fritigern converted to Arian Christianity. 
Athanaric&#x27;s persecution of Christians mentioned by Sozomen, falls into this period.
Athanaric seems to have won this war, as he later led the Thervingi in battle against the Huns in 376.

According to Socrates, Fritigern and Athanaric were rival leaders of the (Therving) Goths. As this rivalry grew into warfare, Athanaric gained the advantage, and Fritigern asked for Roman aid. The Emperor Valens and the Thracian field army intervened, Valens and Fritigern defeated Athanaric, and Fritigern converted to Christianity, following the same teachings as Valens. Sozomen follows Socrates&#x27; account.
According to Zosimus, Athanaric (Athomaricus) was the king of the Goths (Scythians). Sometime after their victory at Adrianople, and after the accession of Theodosius, Fritigern, Alatheus, and Saphrax moved north of the Danube and defeated Athanaric, before returning south of the Danube.

==Danube crossing==
In 376, the Thervings came under increasing pressure from the Huns, who had already conquered their kinsmen, the Greuthungi. 
Fritigern asked Valens to allow the Thervingi to cross the northern Roman border and settle in Moesia or Thracia, with the Danube River and Roman frontier forts protecting them from the Huns. 
Valens agreed to permit Fritigern&#x27;s followers to enter the empire. In return, they would be subject to military service, but would be treated the same as other Roman subjects. As it turned out, neither happened.
Meanwhile, Athanaric and many of his followers retreated to Caucaland (&quot;the Highlands&quot;, presumably the Eastern Carpathians and Transylvania).

During the autumn of 376, the Romans helped Alavivus and Fritigern&#x27;s people cross the Danube and settle in the province of Moesia. In the winter of 376/7, a famine hit the areas settled by the Thervingi and their appeals for help went unanswered. 
The Roman governors of the area, Lupicinus and Maximus, treated them badly. They sold them food only at extremely high prices, which forced many Goths to sell their children as slaves. 
They invited several Thervingi leaders to a feast, in which they killed some and took others hostage. 
Alavivus most likely remained a hostage, but Fritigern was able to escape and he became leader of the Thervingi. Soon he declared war on the Roman Empire.

==War against Valens==

Fritigern decisively defeated Lupicinus at the Battle of Marcianople in 376. 
The Goths went on to pillage Moesia, and by 377 had gained control over most of the neighboring, richer province of Thracia. 
Valens, recognizing the severity of the situation, sent his general Traianus and asked for the aid 
of Western emperor Gratian, who sent Richomeres
and Frigeridus to contain the Goths east of the Haemus.
At the Battle of the Willows, combined troops of the Western and Eastern Empire barely withstood a larger number of Goths, forcing Fritigern to withdraw into a wagon fort to recuperate. 
Valens now sent Saturninus to support Traianus.
Saturninus and Traianus built a number of fortifications to contain the Gothic camp, hoping to starve them out during the winter of 377/8 and to force them into an open field battle. Fritigern refused to abandon his fort, and instead managed to enlist the support of Hunnic and Alanic cavalry.
Saturninus could no longer maintain his blockade and was forced to retreat, returning freedom of movement to Fritigern who again took to pillaging the countryside. 
In the summer of 377, the Goths had regained access to the Hellespont and the Black Sea. They sacked Dibaltum
and Augusta Trajana, forcing Frigiderus to retreat to Illyria.
The Goths now threatened Constantinople itself, 
and Valens was forced to extract significant forces from the Persian front, granting considerable concessions to the Sassanids.
According to Socrates Scholasticus, the citizens of the capital accused Valens of neglecting their defense, urging him to confront the invaders.
Valens moved his army to Melantias on 12 June, and sent 
Sebastianus with an advance force to engage Gothic raiding parties.
Sebastianus successfully destroyed a number of raiding parties, forcing Fritigern to consolidate his forces in the area of Cabyle.
Gratian was detained in the north in his campaign against the Alemanni (Battle of Argentovaria), and unable to support Valens, who had been waiting to engage the Goths throughout June and July. When Valens heard that the Goths were moving towards Adrianople, 
he decamped and marched to meet them. 
Around 7 August, Richomeres returned from the Western campaign with the message that Gratian was now approaching.
According to Ammianus, Victor cautioned Valens to wait for Gratian, while Sebastianus urged for an immediate assault.
Fritigern sent envoys with two letters on the night of 8 August.
The first letter offered peace and a military alliance in exchange for territory in Thrace. The second letter, addressed privately to Valens, assured that he wished for peace, but asked Valens to remain mobilized so that he, Fritigern, could convince his own people of maintaining the peace.
Valens rejected the proposal and marched to engage the Goths on the following day. Fritigern won a respite by further peace negotiations allowing his allied Greuthungi cavalry to draw near.
In the ensuing Battle of Adrianople, the Goths won a decisive victory.
The Roman army was routed and suffered heavy losses. Valens himself was killed in the aftermath of the battle.
Fritigern besieged the city of Adrianople itself, without success.

The Goths retook control of much of the Balkan peninsula in the aftermath of the battle. The Eastern empire, now without an emperor, feared that the Gothic populations would ally themselves with Fritigern leading to widespread insurgence. Julius, successor to Lupicinus, 
ordered the massacre of all Goths living near the frontier.
By 379, word of the massacres reached the Goths living in the interior provinces, leading to riots in Asia Minor. The Romans reacted by massacring the Goths in the interior provinces as well.

Fritigern continued the war for two years, with mixed success. Theodosius I succeeded Valens as emperor on 19 January 379. Gratian did acknowledge Theodosius as his co-emperor and granted him control over the imperial dioceses of Dacia and Macedonia, but he promptly returned to his northern front to deal with the Alemanni, leaving Theodosius to deal with the Gothic problem.

Theodosius drafted a new army from farmers and mercenaries.
Many attempted to avoid the draft, some mutilating their own thumbs to avoid military service, and Theodosius responded with harsh punishments for deserters, forcing even those who had mutilated themselves into service.
Theodosius&#x27; general Modares, a Goth himself, won a minor victory against Fritigern.

It appears that at this point, the Greuthungi split off the Gothic army and went to Illyricum. The Thervingi under Fritigern moved towards Greece, into Macedonia and Thessaly. Theodosius moved to intercept them, but his army disintegrated from desertions at Thessalonica, many of the barbarian mercenaries joining Fritigern.
At this point, Gratian was once again willing to come to aid, and his generals 
Arbogast and Bauto successfully drove the Gothis back into Thrace by the summer of 381. 
Peace negotiations were opened, with 
Richomeres and Saturninus conducting the negotiations for the Romans.
Peace was declared on 3 October 382.
Fritigern is not mentioned again in any source after 381, and his fate is uncertain, he may have been killed in the Greek campaign, or he may have been deposed as a condition for peace.

<text>Victor Lustig (; January 4, 1890 – March 11, 1947) was a con artist from Austria-Hungary, who undertook a criminal career that involved conducting scams across Europe and the United States during the early 20th century. Lustig is widely regarded as one of the most notorious con artists of his time, and is infamous for being &quot;the man who sold the Eiffel Tower twice&quot; and for conducting the &quot;Rumanian Box&quot; scam.

==Early life==
Lustig was born in Hostinné, Bohemia, Austria-Hungary. He learned easily throughout his youth, becoming a quick-study, which also proved to be a source of trouble. At the age of 19, while taking a break from his studies in Paris, Lustig took to gambling. During this time he also sustained a defining scar on the left side of his face from the jealous boyfriend of a woman he consorted with. Upon leaving school, Lustig applied both his quick wit and sizing up of a situation and his fluency in several languages to embark on a life of crime, eventually focusing on conducting a variety of scams and cons that provided him with property and money, and which transformed him into a professional con man.

==Career==
Many of Lustig&#x27;s initial cons were committed on ocean liners sailing between the Atlantic ports of France and New York City. He would pose as a musical producer seeking investors in a non-existent Broadway production. When the services of Trans-Atlantic liners were suspended in the wake of World War I, Lustig found himself in search of new territory to make an income from and opted to travel to the United States. 

In May 1922, Lustig posed as Robert Duval and visited a bank in Springfield, Missouri. He purchased some land from the bank and overpaid with Liberty bonds. His change amounted to $10,000 in the bank&#x27;s cash, and before leaving Lustig also pocketed his bonds. He was arrested in New York City and extradited by Governor Nathan L. Miller. Around this time, Lustig&#x27;s infamy was growing among law enforcement.

==Eiffel Tower scam==
In 1925, Lustig traveled back to France. While staying in Paris, he chanced upon a newspaper article discussing the problems faced with maintaining the Eiffel Tower, which gave him inspiration for a new con. The monument had begun falling into disrepair, and the city was finding it increasingly expensive to maintain and repaint it. Part of the article made a passing comment that overall public opinion on the monument would move towards calls for its removal, which was the key to convincing Lustig that using it as part of his next con would be lucrative. After researching what he needed to help him utilize the information from the article, Lustig set to work preparing the scam, which included hiring a forger to produce fake government stationery for him.

Once he was ready, Lustig invited a small group of scrap metal dealers to a confidential meeting at an expensive hotel, whereupon he identified himself to them as the Deputy Director-General of the Ministère de Postes et Télégraphes (Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs). In the meeting, he convinced the men that the upkeep of the Eiffel Tower was becoming too much for Paris and that the French government wished to sell it for scrap, but that because such a deal would be controversial and likely spark public outcry, nothing could be disclosed until all the details were thought out. Lustig revealed that he was in charge of selecting the dealer who would receive ownership of the structure, claiming that the group had been selected carefully because of their reputations as &quot;honest businessmen&quot;. His speech included genuine insight about the monument&#x27;s place in the city and how it did not fit in with the city&#x27;s other great monuments like the Gothic cathedrals or the Arc de Triomphe.

During his time with the dealers, Lustig kept watch on who would be the most likely to fall for his scam and found his mark in André Poisson—an insecure man who wished to rise up amongst the inner circles of the Parisian business community. As Poisson showed the keenest interest in purchasing the monument, Lustig decided to focus on him once the dealers sent their bids to him. Arranging a private meeting with Poisson, Lustig convinced him that he was a corrupt official, claiming that his government position did not give him a generous salary for the lifestyle he wished to enjoy. Believing the sale of the Eiffel Tower would secure him a place amongst the top businessmen, Poisson agreed to pay a large bribe to secure ownership of the Eiffel Tower. However, once Lustig received his bribe and the funds for the monument&#x27;s &quot;sale&quot; (around 70,000 francs), he soon fled to Austria.

Lustig suspected that when Poisson found out he had been conned, he would be too ashamed and embarrassed to inform the French police of what he had been caught up in, yet despite this belief, he maintained a check on newspapers while in Austria. His suspicions soon proved to be correct when he could find no reference of his con within their pages, and thus he decided to return to Paris later that year to pull off the scheme once more. However, when Lustig attempted to con another group of dealers and had managed to find a mark among them willing to buy the Eiffel Tower, the police were informed about the scam and he fled to the U.S. to evade arrest.

==Rumanian Box scam==
One of Lustig&#x27;s most notable scams was known as the &quot;money box&quot; or &quot;Rumanian Box&quot;. It involved selling unsuspecting marks a machine that could duplicate any currency that was inserted into it. The only catch being that the device needed six hours to print a copy. The machine was actually a specially designed mahogany box, roughly the size of a steamer trunk. The box featured two small slots to take in the money and the printing paper. It also held a fake mechanism with dummy levers.

Lustig would demonstrate the machine by asking the mark for a specific bill (e.g. $100). He would insert it and the blank paper, then wait with the mark for the machine to work. Lustig had already stocked the machine with a genuine bill to match the one the mark inserted. When the planted bill was produced, Lustig would take the mark to a bank to authenticate the note. Once the mark was convinced, Lustig would sell the money box for an exorbitant sum.

Lustig once sold a money box to a Texas sheriff for thousands of dollars. Upon realizing he had been tricked, the sheriff pursued Lustig to Chicago. The cornered Lustig conned the sheriff into believing that he was not operating the device correctly. Lustig gave him a large sum of cash as compensation, but the bills were counterfeit. This counterfeiting would eventually lead to Lustig&#x27;s arrest by American law enforcement officers.

==Later years==
On July 5, 1929, Lustig and William McSherry were arrested in Paris. Lustig was traveling as &quot;Robert Miller&quot;, and both men had a variety of forged identification documents and letters of credit. They also had a money box with them. Upon his arrest, Lustig claimed to be an associate of Al Capone. Chicago police were unfamiliar with Lustig, however.

When the Great Depression hit, Lustig concocted a risky scam aimed at Capone, knowing that he faced certain death if his mark realized he was being conned. For Lustig, the scam was not a straight-out con, but one designed to get his target to part with a relatively small amount of cash. Lustig asked Capone to invest $50,000 in a crooked scheme, then kept the money given to him in a safe deposit box for two months before returning it, claiming the deal had fallen through. Capone got the impression that he was dealing with an honest man. At this point, Lustig told Capone that the failure of the deal meant he had lost all means of supporting himself. He then convinced Capone to give him $5,000 ($1,000, according to other sources) to &quot;tide him over&quot;, as Lustig had originally planned.

In 1930, Lustig went into a partnership with two men from Nebraska—pharmacist William Watts and chemist Tom Shaw—to conduct a large scale counterfeiting operation. Watts and Shaw engraved the plates that would be used to print the counterfeit dollar bills, while Lustig organised a ring of couriers to distribute the forgeries, ensuring that they were kept in the dark regarding the production of the counterfeits. The operation managed to inject thousands of dollars of counterfeit money (nicknamed &quot;Lustig money&quot;) to the U.S. economy each month for the next five years, though the increasing amount entering circulation eventually drew the attention of federal agents.

==Capture==
When Lustig&#x27;s mistress, Billy May, learned that he was betraying her for a younger woman, she decided to take revenge and placed an anonymous phone call to the federal authorities. On 10 May 1935, Lustig was arrested in New York and charged with counterfeiting. Although he openly admitted to his partners&#x27; involvement in the operation, he himself feigned ignorance in the matter. However, Lustig&#x27;s refusal to disclose information on a key found in his possession proved to be his undoing, as it was later found to open a locker in the Times Square subway station containing $51,000 in counterfeit bills and the plates with which they had been printed.

The day before his trial, Lustig managed to escape from the Federal House of Detention, The Tombs, in New York City by faking illness and using a specially made rope to climb out of the building, but he was recaptured 27 days later in Pittsburgh. Lustig pleaded guilty at his trial and was sentenced to fifteen years in prison on Alcatraz Island, California for his original charge, with a further five years for his prison escape.

==Death==
On 9 March 1947, Lustig contracted pneumonia and died two days later at 8:30pm at the Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield, Missouri. On his death certificate his occupation was listed as apprentice salesman and counterfeiter.

==Ten Commandments==
A set of instructions known as the &quot;Ten Commandments for Con Men&quot; has been attributed to Lustig:

These commandments are elaborated on in David Maurer&#x27;s &quot;The Big Con&quot; by two ropers.

<text>Albert Abrams (December 8, 1863 – January 13, 1924) was a fraudulent American physician, well known during his life for inventing machines, such as the &quot;Oscilloclast&quot; and the &quot;Radioclast&quot;, which he falsely claimed could diagnose and cure almost any disease. These claims were challenged from the outset. Towards the end of his life, and again shortly after his death, many of his machines and conclusions were demonstrated to be intentionally deceptive or false.

==Biography==
Albert Abrams was born in San Francisco on December 8, 1863, to Marcus Abrams and Rachel Leavey, although other dates have also been reported. On October 8, 1878, he inscribed at Medical College of the Pacific, worked as an assistant of Prof. Douglass and Prof. Hirschfelder, and got a medical degree on October 30, 1881. Then he went to Heidelberg, Germany, and graduated there in November 1882
before undertaking further studies in London, Berlin, Vienna, and Paris.

According to Wilson, Abrams was awarded an M.D. by the Cooper College in 1883. He served on the teaching staff of the College for a total of fourteen years: five years (1885–1889) as Demonstrator of Pathology; four years (1890–1893) as Adjunct to the Chair of Clinical Medicine and Demonstrator of Pathology; and five years (1894–1898) as Professor of Pathology.

He was described by one Jewish newspaper as “our talented young professor.” He was elected vice-president of the California State Medical Society in 1889 and was made president of the San Francisco Medico-Chirurgical Society in 1893. In the beginning of the 1900s he had become a respected expert in neurology. From 1904 he was president of the Emanuel Polyclinic in San Francisco.

Abrams published numerous books from 1891 to 1923.

He died January 13, 1924, from a broncho-pneumonia in San Francisco.

==Practice==
===Heidelberg doctorate claim===
Abrams was accused of fraudulently claiming a medical qualification from the University of Heidelberg; however, documents from Archive of University Heidelberg confirm that Albert Abrams received a medical degree there on 21 November 1882.

In Abrams&#x27; view, American medicine was dominated by physicians with excessive admiration for German doctors and researchers. In earlier writings, he insulted physicians by calling them &quot;Dr. Hades&quot; or &quot;Dr. Inferior&quot;, by comparing their looks to typhoid and other germs, and by making fun of various abstruse therapies that at the time were considered &quot;scientific&quot; by the medical establishment. In a poem that he wrote on balloon therapy, for instance, the doctors take their patients up in the air but do not know how to bring the balloon down again. The poem ends with the lines: &quot;But they never came back. That&#x27;s why we confess / Aëronautic therapy is not a success.&quot;

===Spondylotherapy===
Abrams developed a medical technique called spondylotherapy, which was inspired by chiropractic and osteopathic ideas. The basic principle is the stimulation of nerves originating from the spinal cord, which can trigger reflex actions on viscera or inner organs. The stimulation is performed by controlled concussion with a plexor / pleximeter combination directly on the spinous processes, by sinusoidal electric currents or by application of ice. Abrams published the book &quot;Spondylotherapy&quot; in several editions between 1910 and 1918. A simplified version of spondylotherapy was first published by Alva Emeey Gregory, M.D. in 1914.

==Electronic Reactions of Abrams==
Abrams promoted an idea that electrons were the basic element of all life. He called this ERA, for Electronic Reactions of Abrams, and introduced a number of different machines which he claimed were based on these principles.

===The machines===
The Dynomizer looked something like a radio, and Abrams claimed it could diagnose any known disease from a single drop of blood or alternatively the subject&#x27;s handwriting. He performed diagnoses on dried blood samples sent to him on pieces of paper in envelopes through the mail. Apparently Abrams even claimed he could conduct medical practice over the telephone with his machines, and that he could determine characteristics.

The Dynomizer was big business; by 1918, courses in spondylotherapy and ERA cost $200 (about the same purchasing power as $3,150 in 2014); equipment was leased at about $200 with a monthly $5 charge thereafter. The lessee had to sign a contract stating the device would never be opened. Abrams explained that this would disrupt their delicate adjustment, but the rule also served to prevent the Abrams devices from being examined. He then widened his claims to treating the diagnosed diseases. Abrams came up with new and even more impressive gadgets, the &quot;Oscilloclast&quot; and the &quot;Radioclast&quot;, which came with tables of frequencies that were designed to &quot;attack&quot; specific diseases. Clients were told cures required repeated treatments.

Dynomizer operators tended to give alarming diagnoses, involving combinations of such maladies as cancer, diabetes and syphilis. Abrams often included a disease called &quot;bovine syphilis&quot;, unknown to other medical practitioners. He claimed the Oscilloclast was capable of defeating most of these diseases, most of the time.

By 1921, there were claimed to be 3,500 practitioners using ERA technology. Conventional medical practitioners were extremely suspicious. When people opened Abrams&#x27;s boxes, they found &quot;simple wiring, a few resistors, a small motor that only made a humming noise, and nothing that could in any way perform a diagnosis or &#x27;broadcast&#x27; or even produce radio waves.&quot;

In the 1970s, Bob DeVries, a product designer for Hewlett-Packard, had a chance to repair an old Oscilloclast (1934). It was owned by a lady whose father had been a president of Abrams&#x27; Electronic Medical Foundation and improver of their devices; she had several such devices and believed that electric therapy to be beneficial, from her own experience. DeVries not only restored the old oscilloclast to working order, but also developed a transistorized version for his client, which they called a &quot;Pulsed Oscillator&quot;.

==Investigation==
The dispute between Abrams and his followers and the American Medical Association (AMA) was intensified. Defenders included American radical author Upton Sinclair and the famously credulous Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes. Resolution of the dispute through the intervention of a scientifically respected third party was pursued. &quot;Scientific American&quot; magazine decided to investigate Dr. Abrams&#x27; claims. &quot;Scientific American&quot; was interested in the matter as readers were writing letters to the editor saying that Abrams&#x27; revolutionary machines were one of the greatest inventions of the century and so needed to be discussed in the pages of the magazine.

&quot;Scientific American&quot; assembled a team of investigators who worked with a senior Abrams associate given the pseudonym &quot;Doctor X&quot;. The investigators developed a series of tests and the magazine asked readers to suggest their own tests. The investigators asked Doctor X to identify six vials containing unknown pathogens. It seems likely that Doctor X honestly believed in his Abrams machines; in fact, he allowed the &quot;Scientific American&quot; investigators to observe his procedure. Doctor X got the contents of all six vials completely wrong. He examined the vials and pointed out that they had labels in red ink, which produced vibrations that confounded the instruments. The investigators gave him the vials again with less offensive labels, and he got the contents wrong again.

The results were published in &quot;Scientific American&quot;, and investigators continued their work. Abrams offered to &quot;cooperate&quot; with the investigators, but always failed to do so on various pretexts. Abrams never actually participated in the investigation, and in ERA publications asserted he was a victim of unjust persecution.

===Debunking===
An AMA member sent a blood sample to an Abrams practitioner, and got back a diagnosis that the patient had malaria, diabetes, cancer and syphilis. The blood sample was in fact from a Plymouth Rock rooster.

Similar samples were sent to other Abrams practitioners, and a few found themselves facing fraud charges in court. In a case in Jonesboro, Arkansas, Abrams was called to be a witness, but he died of pneumonia at age 60 shortly before the trial began in January 1924. After his death, investigators with the Food and Drug Administration opened some of the doctor&#x27;s boxes. One produced a magnetic field, similar to a doorbell; another was a low-powered radio wave transmitter.

Psychologist Donovan Rawcliffe claimed that Abrams&#x27; devices had no scientific validity but his successors had &quot;founded a good many special clinics in the United States and their number has by no means diminished in the ensuing years.&quot;

<text>A fuzzy control system is a control system based on fuzzy logic – a mathematical system that analyzes analog input values in terms of logical variables that take on continuous values between 0 and 1, in contrast to classical or digital logic, which operates on discrete values of either 1 or 0 (true or false, respectively).

Fuzzy logic is widely used in machine control. The term &quot;fuzzy&quot; refers to the fact that the logic involved can deal with concepts that cannot be expressed as the &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot; but rather as &quot;partially true&quot;. Although alternative approaches such as genetic algorithms and neural networks can perform just as well as fuzzy logic in many cases, fuzzy logic has the advantage that the solution to the problem can be cast in terms that human operators can understand, such that that their experience can be used in the design of the controller. This makes it easier to mechanize tasks that are already successfully performed by humans.

== History and applications ==
Fuzzy logic was proposed by Lotfi A. Zadeh of the University of California at Berkeley in a 1965 paper. He elaborated on his ideas in a 1973 paper that introduced the concept of &quot;linguistic variables&quot;, which in this article equates to a variable defined as a fuzzy set. Other research followed, with the first industrial application, a cement kiln built in Denmark, coming on line in 1976.

Fuzzy systems were initially implemented in Japan.

* Interest in fuzzy systems was sparked by Seiji Yasunobu and Soji Miyamoto of Hitachi, who in 1985 provided simulations that demonstrated the feasibility of fuzzy control systems for the Sendai Subway. Their ideas were adopted, and fuzzy systems were used to control accelerating, braking, and stopping when the Namboku Line opened in 1987.
* In 1987, Takeshi Yamakawa demonstrated the use of fuzzy control, through a set of simple dedicated fuzzy logic chips, in an &quot;inverted pendulum&quot; experiment. This is a classic control problem, in which a vehicle tries to keep a pole mounted on its top by a hinge upright by moving back and forth. Yamakawa subsequently made the demonstration more sophisticated by mounting a wine glass containing water and even a live mouse to the top of the pendulum: the system maintained stability in both cases. Yamakawa eventually went on to organize his own fuzzy-systems research lab to help exploit his patents in the field.
* Japanese engineers subsequently developed a wide range of fuzzy systems for both industrial and consumer applications. In 1988 Japan established the Laboratory for International Fuzzy Engineering (LIFE), a cooperative arrangement between 48 companies to pursue fuzzy research. The automotive company Volkswagen was the only foreign corporate member of LIFE, dispatching a researcher for a duration of three years.
* Japanese consumer goods often incorporate fuzzy systems. Matsushita vacuum cleaners use microcontrollers running fuzzy algorithms to interrogate dust sensors and adjust suction power accordingly. Hitachi washing machines use fuzzy controllers to load-weight, fabric-mix, and dirt sensors and automatically set the wash cycle for the best use of power, water, and detergent.
* Canon developed an autofocusing camera that uses a charge-coupled device (CCD) to measure the clarity of the image in six regions of its field of view and use the information provided to determine if the image is in focus. It also tracks the rate of change of lens movement during focusing, and controls its speed to prevent overshoot. The camera&#x27;s fuzzy control system uses 12 inputs: 6 to obtain the current clarity data provided by the CCD and 6 to measure the rate of change of lens movement. The output is the position of the lens. The fuzzy control system uses 13 rules and requires 1.1 kilobytes of memory.
*An industrial air conditioner designed by Mitsubishi uses 25 heating rules and 25 cooling rules. A temperature sensor provides input, with control outputs fed to an inverter, a compressor valve, and a fan motor. Compared to the previous design, the fuzzy controller heats and cools five times faster, reduces power consumption by 24%, increases temperature stability by a factor of two, and uses fewer sensors.
* Other applications investigated or implemented include: character and handwriting recognition; optical fuzzy systems; robots, including one for making Japanese flower arrangements; voice-controlled robot helicopters (hovering is a &quot;balancing act&quot; rather similar to the inverted pendulum problem); rehabilitation robotics to provide patient-specific solutions (e.g. to control heart rate and blood pressure ); control of flow of powders in film manufacture; elevator systems; and so on.

Work on fuzzy systems is also proceeding in North America and Europe, although on a less extensive scale than in Japan.

* The US Environmental Protection Agency has investigated fuzzy control for energy-efficient motors, and NASA has studied fuzzy control for automated space docking: simulations show that a fuzzy control system can greatly reduce fuel consumption.
* Firms such as Boeing, General Motors, Allen-Bradley, Chrysler, Eaton, and Whirlpool have worked on fuzzy logic for use in low-power refrigerators, improved automotive transmissions, and energy-efficient electric motors.
* In 1995 Maytag introduced an &quot;intelligent&quot; dishwasher based on a fuzzy controller and a &quot;one-stop sensing module&quot; that combines a thermistor, for temperature measurement; a conductivity sensor, to measure detergent level from the ions present in the wash; a turbidity sensor that measures scattered and transmitted light to measure the soiling of the wash; and a magnetostrictive sensor to read spin rate. The system determines the optimum wash cycle for any load to obtain the best results with the least amount of energy, detergent, and water. It even adjusts for dried-on foods by tracking the last time the door was opened, and estimates the number of dishes by the number of times the door was opened.
* Xiera Technologies Inc. has developed the first auto-tuner for the fuzzy logic controller&#x27;s knowledge base known as edeX. This technology was tested by Mohawk College and was able to solve non-linear 2x2 and 3x3 multi-input multi-output problems.

Research and development is also continuing on fuzzy applications in software, as opposed to firmware, design, including fuzzy expert systems and integration of fuzzy logic with neural-network and so-called adaptive &quot;genetic&quot; software systems, with the ultimate goal of building &quot;self-learning&quot; fuzzy-control systems. These systems can be employed to control complex, nonlinear dynamic plants, for example, human body.

== Fuzzy sets ==

The input variables in a fuzzy control system are in general mapped by sets of membership functions similar to this, known as &quot;fuzzy sets&quot;. The process of converting a crisp input value to a fuzzy value is called &quot;fuzzification&quot;. The fuzzy logic based approach had been considered by designing two fuzzy systems, one for error heading angle and the other for velocity control.

A control system may also have various types of switch, or &quot;ON-OFF&quot;, inputs along with its analog inputs, and such switch inputs of course will always have a truth value equal to either 1 or 0, but the scheme can deal with them as simplified fuzzy functions that happen to be either one value or another.

Given &quot;mappings&quot; of input variables into membership functions and truth values, the microcontroller then makes decisions for what action to take, based on a set of &quot;rules&quot;, each of the form:

 IF brake temperature IS warm AND speed IS not very fast 
 THEN brake pressure IS slightly decreased.

In this example, the two input variables are &quot;brake temperature&quot; and &quot;speed&quot; that have values defined as fuzzy sets. The output variable, &quot;brake pressure&quot; is also defined by a fuzzy set that can have values like &quot;static&quot; or &quot;slightly increased&quot; or &quot;slightly decreased&quot; etc.

=== Fuzzy control in detail ===
Fuzzy controllers are very simple conceptually. They consist of an input stage, a processing stage, and an output stage. The input stage maps sensor or other inputs, such as switches, thumbwheels, and so on, to the appropriate membership functions and truth values. The processing stage invokes each appropriate rule and generates a result for each, then combines the results of the rules. Finally, the output stage converts the combined result back into a specific control output value.

The most common shape of membership functions is triangular, although trapezoidal and bell curves are also used, but the shape is generally less important than the number of curves and their placement. From three to seven curves are generally appropriate to cover the required range of an input value, or the &quot;universe of discourse&quot; in fuzzy jargon.

As discussed earlier, the processing stage is based on a collection of logic rules in the form of IF-THEN statements, where the IF part is called the &quot;antecedent&quot; and the THEN part is called the &quot;consequent&quot;. Typical fuzzy control systems have dozens of rules.

Consider a rule for a thermostat:

 IF (temperature is &quot;cold&quot;) THEN turn (heater is &quot;high&quot;)

This rule uses the truth value of the &quot;temperature&quot; input, which is some truth value of &quot;cold&quot;, to generate a result in the fuzzy set for the &quot;heater&quot; output, which is some value of &quot;high&quot;. This result is used with the results of other rules to finally generate the crisp composite output. Obviously, the greater the truth value of &quot;cold&quot;, the higher the truth value of &quot;high&quot;, though this does not necessarily mean that the output itself will be set to &quot;high&quot; since this is only one rule among many. 
In some cases, the membership functions can be modified by &quot;hedges&quot; that are equivalent to adverbs. Common hedges include &quot;about&quot;, &quot;near&quot;, &quot;close to&quot;, &quot;approximately&quot;, &quot;very&quot;, &quot;slightly&quot;, &quot;too&quot;, &quot;extremely&quot;, and &quot;somewhat&quot;. These operations may have precise definitions, though the definitions can vary considerably between different implementations. &quot;Very&quot;, for one example, squares membership functions; since the membership values are always less than 1, this narrows the membership function. &quot;Extremely&quot; cubes the values to give greater narrowing, while &quot;somewhat&quot; broadens the function by taking the square root.

In practice, the fuzzy rule sets usually have several antecedents that are combined using fuzzy operators, such as AND, OR, and NOT, though again the definitions tend to vary: AND, in one popular definition, simply uses the minimum weight of all the antecedents, while OR uses the maximum value. There is also a NOT operator that subtracts a membership function from 1 to give the &quot;complementary&quot; function.

There are several ways to define the result of a rule, but one of the most common and simplest is the &quot;max-min&quot; inference method, in which the output membership function is given the truth value generated by the premise.

Rules can be solved in parallel in hardware, or sequentially in software. The results of all the rules that have fired are &quot;defuzzified&quot; to a crisp value by one of several methods. There are dozens, in theory, each with various advantages or drawbacks.

The &quot;centroid&quot; method is very popular, in which the &quot;center of mass&quot; of the result provides the crisp value. Another approach is the &quot;height&quot; method, which takes the value of the biggest contributor. The centroid method favors the rule with the output of greatest area, while the height method obviously favors the rule with the greatest output value.

The diagram below demonstrates max-min inferencing and centroid defuzzification for a system with input variables &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot; and an output variable &quot;n&quot;. Note that &quot;mu&quot; is standard fuzzy-logic nomenclature for &quot;truth value&quot;:

Notice how each rule provides a result as a truth value of a particular membership function for the output variable. In centroid defuzzification the values are OR&#x27;d, that is, the maximum value is used and values are not added, and the results are then combined using a centroid calculation.

Fuzzy control system design is based on empirical methods, basically a methodical approach to trial-and-error. The general process is as follows:

* Document the system&#x27;s operational specifications and inputs and outputs.
* Document the fuzzy sets for the inputs.
* Document the rule set.
* Determine the defuzzification method.
* Run through test suite to validate system, adjust details as required.
* Complete document and release to production.

As a general example, consider the design of a fuzzy controller for a steam turbine. The block diagram of this control system appears as follows:

The input and output variables map into the following fuzzy set:

—where:

 N3: Large negative.
 N2: Medium negative.
 N1: Small negative.
 Z: Zero.
 P1: Small positive.
 P2: Medium positive.
 P3: Large positive.

The rule set includes such rules as:

 rule 1: IF temperature IS cool AND pressure IS weak, 
 THEN throttle is P3.

 rule 2: IF temperature IS cool AND pressure IS low, 
 THEN throttle is P2.

 rule 3: IF temperature IS cool AND pressure IS ok, 
 THEN throttle is Z.

 rule 4: IF temperature IS cool AND pressure IS strong, 
 THEN throttle is N2.

In practice, the controller accepts the inputs and maps them into their membership functions and truth values. These mappings are then fed into the rules. If the rule specifies an AND relationship between the mappings of the two input variables, as the examples above do, the minimum of the two is used as the combined truth value; if an OR is specified, the maximum is used. The appropriate output state is selected and assigned a membership value at the truth level of the premise. The truth values are then defuzzified. 
For example, assume the temperature is in the &quot;cool&quot; state, and the pressure is in the &quot;low&quot; and &quot;ok&quot; states. The pressure values ensure that only rules 2 and 3 fire:

The two outputs are then defuzzified through centroid defuzzification: 
The output value will adjust the throttle and then the control cycle will begin again to generate the next value.

=== Building a fuzzy controller ===
Consider implementing with a microcontroller chip a simple feedback controller:

A fuzzy set is defined for the input error variable &quot;e&quot;, and the derived change in error, &quot;delta&quot;, as well as the &quot;output&quot;, as follows:

 LP: large positive
 SP: small positive
 ZE: zero
 SN: small negative
 LN: large negative

If the error ranges from -1 to +1, with the analog-to-digital converter used having a resolution of 0.25, then the input variable&#x27;s fuzzy set (which, in this case, also applies to the output variable) can be described very simply as a table, with the error / delta / output values in the top row and the truth values for each membership function arranged in rows beneath:

 _______________________________________________________________________
 -1 -0.75 -0.5 -0.25 0 0.25 0.5 0.75 1
 _______________________________________________________________________
 mu(LP) 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.3 0.7 1
 mu(SP) 0 0 0 0 0.3 0.7 1 0.7 0.3
 mu(ZE) 0 0 0.3 0.7 1 0.7 0.3 0 0
 mu(SN) 0.3 0.7 1 0.7 0.3 0 0 0 0
 mu(LN) 1 0.7 0.3 0 0 0 0 0 0
 _______________________________________________________________________ —or, in graphical form (where each &quot;X&quot; has a value of 0.1):

 LN SN ZE SP LP
 | |
 -1.0 | XXXXXXXXXX XXX : : : |
 -0.75 | XXXXXXX XXXXXXX : : : |
 -0.5 | XXX XXXXXXXXXX XXX : : |
 -0.25 | : XXXXXXX XXXXXXX : : |
 0.0 | : XXX XXXXXXXXXX XXX : |
 0.25 | : : XXXXXXX XXXXXXX : |
 0.5 | : : XXX XXXXXXXXXX XXX |
 0.75 | : : : XXXXXXX XXXXXXX |
 1.0 | : : : XXX XXXXXXXXXX |
 +------------------------------------------------------------------+

Suppose this fuzzy system has the following rule base:

 rule 1: IF e = ZE AND delta = ZE THEN output = ZE
 rule 2: IF e = ZE AND delta = SP THEN output = SN
 rule 3: IF e = SN AND delta = SN THEN output = LP
 rule 4: IF e = LP OR delta = LP THEN output = LN

These rules are typical for control applications in that the antecedents consist of the logical combination of the error and error-delta signals, while the consequent is a control command output. 
The rule outputs can be defuzzified using a discrete centroid computation:

 SUM( I = 1 TO 4 OF ( mu(I) * output(I) ) ) / SUM( I = 1 TO 4 OF mu(I) )

Now, suppose that at a given time: 
 e = 0.25
 delta = 0.5

Then this gives:

 ________________________
 e delta
 ________________________
 mu(LP) 0 0.3
 mu(SP) 0.7 1
 mu(ZE) 0.7 0.3
 mu(SN) 0 0
 mu(LN) 0 0
 ________________________

Plugging this into rule 1 gives:

 rule 1: IF e = ZE AND delta = ZE THEN output = ZE
 mu(1) = MIN( 0.7, 0.3 ) = 0.3
 output(1) = 0

-- where:

* mu(1): Truth value of the result membership function for rule 1. In terms of a centroid calculation, this is the &quot;mass&quot; of this result for this discrete case.
* output(1): Value (for rule 1) where the result membership function (ZE) is maximum over the output variable fuzzy set range. That is, in terms of a centroid calculation, the location of the &quot;center of mass&quot; for this individual result. This value is independent of the value of &quot;mu&quot;. It simply identifies the location of ZE along the output range.

The other rules give:

 rule 2: IF e = ZE AND delta = SP THEN output = SN
 mu(2) = MIN( 0.7, 1 ) = 0.7 
 output(2) = -0.5

 rule 3: IF e = SN AND delta = SN THEN output = LP
 mu(3) = MIN( 0.0, 0.0 ) = 0
 output(3) = 1

 rule 4: IF e = LP OR delta = LP THEN output = LN
 mu(4) = MAX( 0.0, 0.3 ) = 0.3
 output(4) = -1

The centroid computation yields:

 formula_1
 formula_2
 formula_3—for the final control output. Simple. Of course the hard part is figuring out what rules actually work correctly in practice.

If you have problems figuring out the centroid equation, remember that a centroid is defined by summing all the moments (location times mass) around the center of gravity and equating the sum to zero. So if formula_4 is the center of gravity, formula_5 is the location of each mass, and formula_6 is each mass, this gives:

 formula_7
 formula_8
 formula_9
 formula_10

In our example, the values of mu correspond to the masses, and the values of X to location of the masses 
(mu, however, only &#x27;corresponds to the masses&#x27; if the initial &#x27;mass&#x27; of the output functions are all the same/equivalent. If they are not the same, i.e. some are narrow triangles, while others maybe wide trapezoids or shouldered triangles, then the mass or area of the output function must be known or calculated. It is this mass that is then scaled by mu and multiplied by its location X_i).

This system can be implemented on a standard microprocessor, but dedicated fuzzy chips are now available. For example, Adaptive Logic INC of San Jose, California, sells a &quot;fuzzy chip&quot;, the AL220, that can accept four analog inputs and generate four analog outputs. A block diagram of the chip is shown below:

== Antilock brakes ==
As an example, consider an anti-lock braking system, directed by a microcontroller chip. The microcontroller has to make decisions based on brake temperature, speed, and other variables in the system.

The variable &quot;temperature&quot; in this system can be subdivided into a range of &quot;states&quot;: &quot;cold&quot;, &quot;cool&quot;, &quot;moderate&quot;, &quot;warm&quot;, &quot;hot&quot;, &quot;very hot&quot;. The transition from one state to the next is hard to define.

An arbitrary static threshold might be set to divide &quot;warm&quot; from &quot;hot&quot;. For example, at exactly 90 degrees, warm ends and hot begins. But this would result in a discontinuous change when the input value passed over that threshold. The transition wouldn&#x27;t be smooth, as would be required in braking situations.

The way around this is to make the states &quot;fuzzy&quot;. That is, allow them to change gradually from one state to the next. In order to do this, there must be a dynamic relationship established between different factors.

Start by defining the input temperature states using &quot;membership functions&quot;:

With this scheme, the input variable&#x27;s state no longer jumps abruptly from one state to the next. Instead, as the temperature changes, it loses value in one membership function while gaining value in the next. In other words, its ranking in the category of cold decreases as it becomes more highly ranked in the warmer category.

At any sampled timeframe, the &quot;truth value&quot; of the brake temperature will almost always be in some degree part of two membership functions: i.e.: &#x27;0.6 nominal and 0.4 warm&#x27;, or &#x27;0.7 nominal and 0.3 cool&#x27;, and so on.

The above example demonstrates a simple application, using the abstraction of values from multiple values. This only represents one kind of data, however, in this case, temperature.

Adding additional sophistication to this braking system, could be done by additional factors such as traction, speed, inertia, set up in dynamic functions, according to the designed fuzzy system.

==Logical interpretation of fuzzy control==
In spite of the appearance there are several difficulties to give a rigorous logical interpretation of the &quot;IF-THEN&quot; rules. As an example, interpret a rule as &quot;IF (temperature is &quot;cold&quot;) THEN (heater is &quot;high&quot;)&quot; by the first order formula &quot;Cold(x)→High(y)&quot; and assume that r is an input such that &quot;Cold(r)&quot; is false. Then the formula &quot;Cold(r)→High(t)&quot; is true for any &quot;t&quot; and therefore any &quot;t&quot; gives a correct control given &quot;r&quot;. A rigorous logical justification of fuzzy control is given in Hájek&#x27;s book (see Chapter 7) where fuzzy control is represented as a theory of Hájek&#x27;s basic logic.

In Gerla 2005 another logical approach to fuzzy control is proposed based on fuzzy logic programming: Denote by &quot;f&quot; the fuzzy function arising of an IF-THEN systems of rules. Then this system can be translated into a fuzzy program P containing a series of rules whose head is &quot;Good(x,y)&quot;. The interpretation of this predicate in the least fuzzy Herbrand model of P coincides with f. This gives further useful tools to fuzzy control.

==Fuzzy qualitative simulation==
Before an Artificial Intelligence system is able to plan the action sequence, some kind of model is needed. For video games, the model is equal to the game rules. From the programming perspective, the game rules are implemented as a Physics engine which accepts an action from a player and calculates, if the action is valid. After the action was executed, the game is in follow up state. If the aim isn&#x27;t only to play mathematical games but determine the actions for real world applications, the most obvious bottleneck is, that no game rules are available. The first step is to model the domain. System identification can be realized with precise mathematical equations or with Fuzzy rules.

Using Fuzzy logic and ANFIS systems (Adaptive network based fuzzy inference system) for creating the forward model for a domain has many disadvantages. A qualitative simulation isn&#x27;t able to determine the correct follow up state, but the system will only guess what will happen if the action was taken. The Fuzzy qualitative simulation can&#x27;t predict the exact numerical values, but it&#x27;s using imprecise natural language to speculate about the future. It takes the current situation plus the actions from the past and generates the expected follow up state of the game.

The output of the ANFIS system isn&#x27;t providing correct information, but only a Fuzzy set notation, for example [0,0.2,0.4,0]. After converting the set notation back into numerical values the accuracy get worse. This makes Fuzzy qualitative simulation a bad choice for practical applications.

== Applications ==
Fuzzy control systems are suitable when the process complexity is high including uncertainty and nonlinear behavior, and there are no precise mathematical models available.

<text>A statistician is a person who works with theoretical or applied statistics. The profession exists in both the private and public sectors. 

It is common to combine statistical knowledge with expertise in other subjects, and statisticians may work as employees or as statistical consultants.

==Overview==
According to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of 2014, 26,970 jobs were classified as &quot;statistician&quot; in the United States. Of these people, approximately 30 percent worked for governments (federal, state, or local). As of October 2021, the median pay for statisticians in the United States was $92,270. 

Additionally, there is a substantial number of people who use statistics and data analysis in their work but have job titles other than &quot;statistician&quot;, such as actuaries, applied mathematicians, economists, data scientists, data analysts (predictive analytics), financial analysts, psychometricians, sociologists, epidemiologists, and quantitative psychologists. Statisticians are included with the professions in various national and international occupational classifications. 

In many countries, including the United States, employment in the field requires either a master&#x27;s degree in statistics or a related field or a PhD. 

According to one industry professional, &quot;Typical work includes collaborating with scientists, providing mathematical modeling, simulations, designing randomized experiments and randomized sampling plans, analyzing experimental or survey results, and forecasting future events (such as sales of a product).&quot;

According to the BLS, &quot;Overall employment grow 33% from 2016 to 2026, much faster than average for all occupations. Businesses will need these workers to analyze the increasing volume of digital and electronic data.&quot; In October 2021, the CNBC rated it the fastest growing job in science and technology of the next decade, with a projected growth rate of 35.40%.

<doc id="48662" wikidata="Q110427073" url="?curid=48662" title="Computer number format">
<text>A computer number format is the internal representation of numeric values in digital device hardware and software, such as in programmable computers and calculators. Numerical values are stored as groupings of bits, such as bytes and words. The encoding between numerical values and bit patterns is chosen for convenience of the operation of the computer; the encoding used by the computer&#x27;s instruction set generally requires conversion for external use, such as for printing and display. Different types of processors may have different internal representations of numerical values and different conventions are used for integer and real numbers. Most calculations are carried out with number formats that fit into a processor register, but some software systems allow representation of arbitrarily large numbers using multiple words of memory.

==Binary number representation==

Computers represent data in sets of binary digits. The representation is composed of bits, which in turn are grouped into larger sets such as bytes.

A &quot;bit&quot; is a binary digit that represents one of two states. The concept of a bit can be understood as a value of either &quot;1&quot; or &quot;0&quot;, &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot;, &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;, &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;, or encoded by a switch or toggle of some kind.

While a single bit, on its own, is able to represent only two values, a string of bits may be used to represent larger values. For example, a string of three bits can represent up to eight distinct values as illustrated in Table 1.

As the number of bits composing a string increases, the number of possible &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot; combinations increases exponentially. A single bit allows only two value-combinations, two bits combined can make four separate values, three bits for eight, and so on, increasing with the formula 2n. The amount of possible combinations doubles with each binary digit added as illustrated in Table 2.

Groupings with a specific number of bits are used to represent varying things and have specific names.

A &quot;byte&quot; is a bit string containing the number of bits needed to represent a character. On most modern computers, this is an eight bit string. Because the definition of a byte is related to the number of bits composing a character, some older computers have used a different bit length for their byte. In many computer architectures, the byte is the smallest addressable unit, the atom of addressability, say. For example, even though 64-bit processors may address memory sixty-four bits at a time, they may still split that memory into eight-bit pieces. This is called byte-addressable memory. Historically, many CPUs read data in some multiple of eight bits. Because the byte size of eight bits is so common, but the definition is not standardized, the term octet is sometimes used to explicitly describe an eight bit sequence.

A &quot;nibble&quot; (sometimes &quot;nybble&quot;), is a number composed of four bits. Being a half-byte, the nibble was named as a play on words. A person may need several nibbles for one bite from something; similarly, a nybble is a part of a byte. Because four bits allow for sixteen values, a nibble is sometimes known as a hexadecimal digit.

==Octal and hexadecimal number display==

Octal and hexadecimal encoding are convenient ways to represent binary numbers, as used by computers. Computer engineers often need to write out binary quantities, but in practice writing out a binary number such as 1001001101010001 is tedious and prone to errors. Therefore, binary quantities are written in a base-8, or &quot;octal&quot;, or, much more commonly, a base-16, &quot;hexadecimal&quot; (&quot;hex&quot;), number format. In the decimal system, there are 10 digits, 0 through 9, which combine to form numbers. In an octal system, there are only 8 digits, 0 through 7. That is, the value of an octal &quot;10&quot; is the same as a decimal &quot;8&quot;, an octal &quot;20&quot; is a decimal &quot;16&quot;, and so on. In a hexadecimal system, there are 16 digits, 0 through 9 followed, by convention, with A through F. That is, a hexadecimal &quot;10&quot; is the same as a decimal &quot;16&quot; and a hexadecimal &quot;20&quot; is the same as a decimal &quot;32&quot;. An example and comparison of numbers in different bases is described in the chart below.

When typing numbers, formatting characters are used to describe the number system, for example 000_0000B or 0b000_00000 for binary and 0F8H or 0xf8 for hexadecimal numbers.
===Converting between bases===

Each of these number systems is a positional system, but while decimal weights are powers of 10, the octal weights are powers of 8 and the hexadecimal weights are powers of 16. To convert from hexadecimal or octal to decimal, for each digit one multiplies the value of the digit by the value of its position and then adds the results. For example:

: formula_1

==Representing fractions in binary==

===Fixed-point numbers===

Fixed-point formatting can be useful to represent fractions in binary.

The number of bits needed for the precision and range desired must be chosen to store the fractional and integer parts of a number. For instance, using a 32-bit format, 16 bits may be used for the integer and 16 for the fraction.

The eight&#x27;s bit is followed by the four&#x27;s bit, then the two&#x27;s bit, then the one&#x27;s bit. The fractional bits continue the pattern set by the integer bits. The next bit is the half&#x27;s bit, then the quarter&#x27;s bit, then the eighth&#x27;s bit, and so on. For example:

This form of encoding cannot represent some values in binary. For example, the fraction , 0.2 in decimal, the closest approximations would be as follows:
Even if more digits are used, an exact representation is impossible. The number , written in decimal as 0.333333333..., continues indefinitely. If prematurely terminated, the value would not represent precisely.

===Floating-point numbers===
While both unsigned and signed integers are used in digital systems, even a 32-bit integer is not enough to handle all the range of numbers a calculator can handle, and that&#x27;s not even including fractions. To approximate the greater range and precision of real numbers, we have to abandon signed integers and fixed-point numbers and go to a &quot;floating-point&quot; format.

In the decimal system, we are familiar with floating-point numbers of the form (scientific notation):

: 1.1030402 × 105 = 1.1030402 × 100000 = 110304.02

or, more compactly:

: 1.1030402E5

which means &quot;1.1030402 times 1 followed by 5 zeroes&quot;. We have a certain numeric value (1.1030402) known as a &quot;significand&quot;, multiplied by a power of 10 (E5, meaning 105 or 100,000), known as an &quot;exponent&quot;. If we have a negative exponent, that means the number is multiplied by a 1 that many places to the right of the decimal point. For example:

: 2.3434E−6 = 2.3434 × 10−6 = 2.3434 × 0.000001 = 0.0000023434

The advantage of this scheme is that by using the exponent we can get a much wider range of numbers, even if the number of digits in the significand, or the &quot;numeric precision&quot;, is much smaller than the range. Similar binary floating-point formats can be defined for computers. There is a number of such schemes, the most popular has been defined by Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). The IEEE 754-2008 standard specification defines a 64 bit floating-point format with:

* an 11-bit binary exponent, using &quot;excess-1023&quot; format. Excess-1023 means the exponent appears as an unsigned binary integer from 0 to 2047; subtracting 1023 gives the actual signed value
* a 52-bit significand, also an unsigned binary number, defining a fractional value with a leading implied &quot;1&quot;
* a sign bit, giving the sign of the number.

With the bits stored in 8 bytes of memory:

where &quot;S&quot; denotes the sign bit, &quot;x&quot; denotes an exponent bit, and &quot;m&quot; denotes a significand bit. Once the bits here have been extracted, they are converted with the computation:

: &lt;sign&gt; × (1 + &lt;fractional significand&gt;) × 2&lt;exponent&gt; − 1023

This scheme provides numbers valid out to about 15 decimal digits, with the following range of numbers:
The specification also defines several special values that are not defined numbers, and are known as &quot;NaNs&quot;, for &quot;Not A Number&quot;. These are used by programs to designate invalid operations and the like. 
Some programs also use 32-bit floating-point numbers. The most common scheme uses a 23-bit significand with a sign bit, plus an 8-bit exponent in &quot;excess-127&quot; format, giving seven valid decimal digits.
The bits are converted to a numeric value with the computation:

: &lt;sign&gt; × (1 + &lt;fractional significand&gt;) × 2&lt;exponent&gt; − 127

leading to the following range of numbers:
Such floating-point numbers are known as &quot;reals&quot; or &quot;floats&quot; in general, but with a number of variations:

A 32-bit float value is sometimes called a &quot;real32&quot; or a &quot;single&quot;, meaning &quot;single-precision floating-point value&quot;.

A 64-bit float is sometimes called a &quot;real64&quot; or a &quot;double&quot;, meaning &quot;double-precision floating-point value&quot;.

The relation between numbers and bit patterns is chosen for convenience in computer manipulation; eight bytes stored in computer memory may represent a 64-bit real, two 32-bit reals, or four signed or unsigned integers, or some other kind of data that fits into eight bytes. The only difference is how the computer interprets them. If the computer stored four unsigned integers and then read them back from memory as a 64-bit real, it almost always would be a perfectly valid real number, though it would be junk data.

Only a finite range of real numbers can be represented with a given number of bits. Arithmetic operations can overflow or underflow, producing a value too large or too small to be represented.

The representation has a limited precision. For example, only 15 decimal digits can be represented with a 64-bit real. If a very small floating-point number is added to a large one, the result is just the large one. The small number was too small to even show up in 15 or 16 digits of resolution, and the computer effectively discards it. Analyzing the effect of limited precision is a well-studied problem. Estimates of the magnitude of round-off errors and methods to limit their effect on large calculations are part of any large computation project. The precision limit is different from the range limit, as it affects the significand, not the exponent.

The significand is a binary fraction that doesn&#x27;t necessarily perfectly match a decimal fraction. In many cases a sum of reciprocal powers of 2 does not match a specific decimal fraction, and the results of computations will be slightly off. For example, the decimal fraction &quot;0.1&quot; is equivalent to an infinitely repeating binary fraction: 0.000110011 ...

==Numbers in programming languages==
Programming in assembly language requires the programmer to keep track of the representation of numbers. Where the processor does not support a required mathematical operation, the programmer must work out a suitable algorithm and instruction sequence to carry out the operation; on some microprocessors, even integer multiplication must be done in software.

High-level programming languages such as Ruby and Python offer an abstract number that may be an expanded type such as &quot;rational&quot;, &quot;bignum&quot;, or &quot;complex&quot;. Mathematical operations are carried out by library routines provided by the implementation of the language. A given mathematical symbol in the source code, by operator overloading, will invoke different object code appropriate to the representation of the numerical type; mathematical operations on any number—whether signed, unsigned, rational, floating-point, fixed-point, integral, or complex—are written exactly the same way.

Some languages, such as REXX and Java, provide decimal floating-points operations, which provide rounding errors of a different form.

<doc id="48664" wikidata="Q180402" url="?curid=48664" title="Yosemite National Park">
<text>Yosemite National Park ( ) is a national park of the United States in California. It is bordered on the southeast by Sierra National Forest and on the northwest by Stanislaus National Forest. The park is managed by the National Park Service and covers in four countiescentered in Tuolumne and Mariposa, extending north and east to Mono and south to Madera. Designated a World Heritage Site in 1984, Yosemite is internationally recognized for its granite cliffs, waterfalls, clear streams, groves of giant sequoia, lakes, mountains, meadows, glaciers, and biological diversity. Almost 95 percent of the park is designated wilderness. Yosemite is one of the largest and least fragmented habitat blocks in the Sierra Nevada.

Its geology is characterized by granite and remnants of older rock. About 10 million years ago, the Sierra Nevada was uplifted and tilted to form its unique slopes, which increased the steepness of stream and river beds, forming deep, narrow canyons. About one million years ago glaciers formed at higher elevations. They moved downslope, cutting and sculpting the U-shaped Yosemite Valley.

European American settlers first entered the valley in 1851. Other travelers entered earlier, but James D. Savage is credited with discovering the area that became Yosemite National Park. Native Americans had inhabited the region for nearly 4,000 years, although humans may have first visited as long as 8,000 to 10,000 years ago.

Yosemite was critical to the development of the concept of national parks. Galen Clark and others lobbied to protect Yosemite Valley from development, ultimately leading to President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s signing of the Yosemite Grant of 1864 that declared Yosemite as federally preserved land. In 1890, John Muir led a successful movement to motivate Congress to establish Yosemite Valley and its surrounding areas as a National Park. This helped pave the way for the National Park System. Yosemite draws about four million visitors annually. Most visitors spend the majority of their time in the valley&#x27;s . The park set a visitation record in 2016, surpassing five million visitors for the first time. In 2023, the park saw nearly four million visitors.

==Toponym==
The word &quot;Yosemite&quot; (derived from &quot;yohhe&#x27;meti,&quot; &quot;they are killers&quot; in Miwok) historically referred to the name that the Miwok gave to the Ahwahneechee People, the resident indigenous tribe. Previously, the region had been called &quot;Ahwahnee&quot; (&quot;big mouth&quot;) by its only indigenous inhabitants, the Ahwahneechee. The term &quot;Yosemite&quot; in Miwok is easily confused with a similar term for &quot;grizzly bear&quot;, and is still a common misconception.

==History==
===Ahwahneechee and the Mariposa Wars===
The indigenous natives of Yosemite called themselves the Ahwahneechee, meaning &quot;dwellers&quot; in Ahwahnee. The Ahwahneechee People were the only tribe that lived within the park boundaries, but other tribes lived in surrounding areas. Together they formed a larger Indigenous population in California, called the Southern Sierra Miwok. They are related to the Northern Paiute and Mono tribes. Other tribes like the Central Sierra Miwoks and the Yokuts, who both lived in the San Joaquin Valley and central California, visited Yosemite to trade and intermarry. This resulted in a blending of culture that helped preserve their presence in Yosemite after early American settlements and urban development threatened their survival. Vegetation and game in the region were similar to modern times; acorns were a dietary staple, as well as other seeds and plants, salmon and deer.

The 1848–1855 California Gold Rush was a major event impacting the native population. It drew more than 90,000 European Americans to the area in 1849, causing competition for resources between gold miners and residents. About 70 years before the Gold Rush, the indigenous population was estimated to be 300,000, quickly dropping to 150,000, and just ten years later, only about 50,000 remained. The reasons for such a decline included disease, birth rate decreases, starvation, and conflict. The conflict in Yosemite, which is known as the Mariposa War, was part of the California genocide, which was the systemic killing of indigenous peoples throughout the State between the 1840s and 1870s. It started in December 1850 when California funded a state militia to drive Native people from contested territory to suppress Native American resistance to the European American influx.

Yosemite tribes often stole from settlers and miners, sometimes killing them, in retribution for the extermination/domestication of their people, and loss of their lands and resources. The War and formation of the Mariposa Battalion was partially the result of a single incident involving James Savage, a Fresno trader whose trading post was attacked in December, 1850. After the incident, Savage rallied other miners and gained the support of local officials to pursue a war against the Natives. He was appointed United States Army Major and leader of the Mariposa Battalion in the beginning of 1851. He and Captain John Boling were responsible for pursuing the Ahwahneechee people, led by Chief Tenaya and driving them west, and out of Yosemite. In March 1851 under Savage&#x27;s command, the Mariposa Battalion captured about 70 Ahwahneechee and planned to take them to a reservation in Fresno, but they escaped. Later in May, under the command of Boling, the battalion captured 35 Ahwahneechee, including Chief Tenaya, and marched them to the reservation. Most were allowed to eventually leave and the rest escaped. Tenaya and others fled across the Sierra Nevada and settled with the Mono Lake Paiutes. Tenaya and some of his companions were ultimately killed in 1853 either over stealing horses or a gambling conflict. The survivors of Tenaya&#x27;s group and other Ahwahneechee were absorbed into the Mono Lake Paiute tribe.

Accounts from this battalion were the first well-documented reports of European Americans entering Yosemite Valley. Attached to Savage&#x27;s unit was Doctor Lafayette Bunnell, who later wrote about his awestruck impressions of the valley in &quot;The Discovery of the Yosemite&quot;. Bunnell is credited with naming Yosemite Valley, based on his interviews with Chief Tenaya. Bunnell wrote that Chief Tenaya was the founder of the Ahwahnee colony. Bunnell falsely believed that the word &quot;Yosemite&quot; meant &quot;full-grown grizzly bear&quot;.

===Indigenous peoples&#x27; continuing presence ===

After the Mariposa War, Native Americans continued to live in the Yosemite area in reduced numbers. The remaining Yosemite Ahwahneechee tribe members there were forced to relocate to a village constructed in 1851 by the state government. They learned to live within this camp and their limited rights, adapting to the changed environment by entering the tourism industry through employment and small businesses, manufacturing and selling goods and providing services. In 1953, the National Park Service banned all non-employee Natives from residing in the Park and evicted the non-employees who had residence. In 1969, with only a few families left in the Park, the National Park Service evicted the remaining Native people living within the Park (all Park employees and their families) to a government housing area for park employees and destroyed the village as part of a fire-fighting exercise. A reconstructed &quot;Indian Village of Ahwahnee&quot; sits behind the Yosemite Museum, located next to the Yosemite Valley Visitor Center.

By the late 19th century, the population of all native inhabitants in Yosemite was difficult to determine, estimates ranged from thirty to several hundred. The Ahwahneechee people and their descendants were hard to identify. The last full-blooded Ahwahneechee died in 1931. Her name was Totuya, or Maria Lebrado. She was the granddaughter of Chief Tenaya and one of many forced out of her ancestral homelands. The Ahwahneechee live through the memory of their descendants, their fellow Yosemite Natives, and through the Yosemite exhibit in the Smithsonian and the Yosemite Museum. As a method of self-preservation and resilience, the Indigenous people of California proposed treaties in 1851 and 1852 that would have established land reservations for them, but Congress refused to ratify them. The Southern Sierra Miwuk Nation is seeking tribal sovereignty and federal recognition. The National Park Service created policies to protect sacred sites and allow Native People to return to their homelands and use National Park resources.

===Early tourists===
In 1855, entrepreneur James Mason Hutchings, artist Thomas Ayres and two others were the first tourists to visit. Hutchings and Ayres were responsible for much of Yosemite&#x27;s earliest publicity, writing articles and special issues about the valley. Ayres&#x27; style was detailed with exaggerated angularity. His works and written accounts were distributed nationally, and an exhibition of his drawings was held in New York City. Hutchings&#x27; publicity efforts between 1855 and 1860 increased tourism to Yosemite. Natives supported the growing tourism industry by working as laborers or maids. Later, they performed dances for tourists, acted as guides, and sold handcrafted goods, notably woven baskets. The Indian village and its peoples fascinated visitors, especially James Hutchings who advocated for Yosemite tourism. He and others considered the indigenous presence to be one of Yosemite&#x27;s greatest attractions.

Wawona was an early Indian encampment for Nuchu and Ahwahneechee people who were captured and relocated to a reservation on the Fresno River by Savage and the Mariposa Battalion in March 1851. Galen Clark discovered the Mariposa Grove of giant sequoia in Wawona in 1857. He had simple lodgings and roads built. In 1879, the Wawona Hotel was built to serve tourists visiting Mariposa Grove. As tourism increased, so did the number of trails and hotels to build on it.

The Wawona Tree, also known as the Tunnel Tree, was a giant sequoia that grew in the Mariposa Grove. It was tall, and was in circumference. When a carriage-wide tunnel was cut through the tree in 1881, it became even more popular as a tourist photo attraction. Carriages and automobiles traversed the road that passed through the tree. The tree was permanently weakened by the tunnel, and it fell in 1969 under a heavy load of snow. It was estimated to have been 2,100 years old.

Yosemite&#x27;s first concession was established in 1884 when John Degnan and his wife established a bakery and store. In 1916, the National Park Service granted a 20-year concession to the Desmond Park Service Company. It bought out or built hotels, stores, camps, a dairy, a garage, and other park facilities. The Hotel Del Portal was completed in 1908 by a subsidiary of the Yosemite Valley Railroad. It was located at El Portal, California just outside of Yosemite.

The Curry Company started in 1899, led by David and Jennie Curry to provide concessions. They founded Camp Curry, now Curry Village.

Park service administrators felt that limiting the number of concessionaires in the park would be more financially sound. The Curry Company and its rival, the Yosemite National Park Company, were forced to merge in 1925 to form the Yosemite Park &amp; Curry Company (YP&amp;CC). The company built the Ahwahnee Hotel in 1926–27.

===Yosemite Grant===

Concerned by the impact of commercial interests, citizens including Galen Clark and Senator John Conness advocated protection for the area. The 38th United States Congress passed legislation that was signed by President Abraham Lincoln on June 30, 1864, creating the Yosemite Grant. This is the first time land was set aside specifically for preservation and public use by the U.S. government, and set a precedent for the 1872 creation of Yellowstone national park, the nation&#x27;s first. Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove were ceded to California as a state park, and a board of commissioners was established two years later.

Galen Clark was appointed by the commission as the Grant&#x27;s first guardian, but neither Clark nor the commissioners had the authority to evict homesteaders (which included Hutchings). The issue was not settled until 1872 when the homesteader land holdings were invalidated by the U.S. Supreme Court. Clark and the commissioners were ousted in a dispute that reached the Supreme Court in 1880. The two Supreme Court decisions affecting management of the Yosemite Grant are considered precedents in land management law. Hutchings became the new park guardian.

Tourist access to the park improved, and conditions in the Valley became more hospitable. Tourism significantly increased after the first transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869, while the long horseback ride to reach the area was a deterrent. Three stagecoach roads were built in the mid-1870s to provide better access for the growing number of visitors.

John Muir was a Scottish-born American naturalist and explorer. Muir&#x27;s leadership ensured that many National Parks were left untouched, including Yosemite.

Muir wrote articles popularizing the area and increasing scientific interest in it. Muir was one of the first to theorize that the major landforms in Yosemite Valley were created by alpine glaciers, bucking established scientists such as Josiah Whitney. Muir wrote scientific papers on the area&#x27;s biology. Landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted emphasized the importance of conservation of Yosemite Valley.

===Increased protection efforts===
Overgrazing of meadows (especially by sheep), logging of giant sequoia, and other damage led Muir to become an advocate for further protection. Muir convinced prominent guests of the importance of putting the area under federal protection. One such guest was Robert Underwood Johnson, editor of &quot;Century Magazine&quot;. Muir and Johnson lobbied Congress for the Act that created Yosemite National Park on October 1, 1890. The State of California, however, retained control of Yosemite Valley and Mariposa Grove. Muir&#x27;s writings raised awareness about the damage caused by sheep grazing, and he actively campaigned to virtually eliminate grazing from the Yosemite&#x27;s high-country.

The newly created national park came under the jurisdiction of the United States Army&#x27;s Troop I of the 4th Cavalry on May 19, 1891, which set up camp in Wawona with Captain Abram Epperson Wood as acting superintendent. By the late 1890s, sheep grazing was no longer a problem, and the Army made other improvements. However, the cavalry could not intervene to ease the worsening conditions. From 1899 to 1913, cavalry regiments of the Western Department, including the all Black 9th Cavalry (known as the &quot;Buffalo Soldiers&quot;) and the 1st Cavalry, stationed two troops at Yosemite.
Muir and his Sierra Club continued to lobby the government and influential people for the creation of a unified Yosemite National Park. In May 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt camped with Muir near Glacier Point for three days. On that trip, Muir convinced Roosevelt to take control of Yosemite Valley and Mariposa Grove away from California and return it to the federal government. In 1906, Roosevelt signed a bill that shifted control.

===National Park Service===
The National Park Service (NPS) was formed in 1916, and Yosemite was transferred to that agency&#x27;s jurisdiction. Tuolumne Meadows Lodge, Tioga Pass Road, and campgrounds at Tenaya and Merced lakes were also completed in 1916. Automobiles started to enter the park in ever-increasing numbers following the opening of all-weather highways to the park. The Yosemite Museum was founded in 1926 through the efforts of Ansel Franklin Hall. In the 1920s, the museum featured Native Americans practicing traditional crafts, and many Southern Sierra Miwok continued to live in Yosemite Valley until they were evicted from the park in the 1960s. Although the NPS helped create a museum that included Native American culture, its early actions and organizational values were dismissive of Yosemite Natives and the Ahwahneechee. NPS in the early 20th century criticized and restricted the expression of indigenous culture and behavior. For example, park officials penalized Natives for playing games and drinking during the Indian Field Days of 1924. In 1929, Park Superintendent Charles G. Thomson concluded that the Indian village was aesthetically unpleasant and was limiting white settler development and ordered the camp to be burned down. In 1969, many Native residents left in search of work as a result of the decline in tourism. NPS demolished their empty houses, evicted the remaining residents, and destroyed the entire village. This was the last Indigenous settlement within the park.

In 1903, a dam in Hetch Hetchy Valley in the northwestern region of the park was proposed. Its purpose was to provide water and hydroelectric power to San Francisco. Muir and the Sierra Club opposed the project, while others, including Gifford Pinchot, supported it. In 1913, the O&#x27;Shaughnessy Dam was approved via passage of the Raker Act.

In 1918, Clare Marie Hodges was hired as the first female Park Ranger in Yosemite. Following Hodges in 1921, Enid Michael was hired as a seasonal Park Ranger and continued to serve in that position for 20 years.
In 1937, conservationist Rosalie Edge, head of the Emergency Conservation Committee (ECC), successfully lobbied Congress to purchase about of old-growth sugar pines on the perimeter of Yosemite National Park that were to be logged.

By 1968, traffic congestion and parking in Yosemite Valley during the summer months has become a concern. NPS reduced artificial inducements to visit the park, such as the &quot;Firefall&quot;, in which red-hot embers were pushed off a cliff near Glacier Point at night.

In 1984, preservationists persuaded Congress to designate , or about 89 percent of the park, as the Yosemite Wilderness. As a wilderness area, it would be preserved in its natural state with humans being only temporary visitors.

In 2016, The Trust for Public Land (TPL) purchased Ackerson Meadow, a on the western edge of the park for $2.3 million. Ackerson Meadow was originally included in the proposed 1890 park boundary, but never acquired by the federal government. The purchase and donation of the meadow was made possible through a cooperative effort by TPL, NPS, and Yosemite Conservancy. On September 7, 2016, NPS accepted the donation of the land, making the meadow the largest addition to Yosemite since 1949. With extensive erosion from years of cattle ranching , the land is being transformed back into a healthy meadow.

==Geography==
Yosemite National Park is located in the central Sierra Nevada. Three wilderness areas are adjacent to Yosemite: the Ansel Adams Wilderness to the southeast, the Hoover Wilderness to the northeast, and the Emigrant Wilderness to the north.

The park contains thousands of lakes and ponds, of streams, of hiking trails, and of roads. Two federally designated Wild and Scenic Rivers, the Merced and the Tuolumne, begin within Yosemite&#x27;s borders and flow westward through the Sierra foothills into the Central Valley of California.

===Rocks and erosion===

Almost all of the landforms are cut from the granitic rock of the Sierra Nevada Batholith (a batholith is a large mass of intrusive igneous rock that formed deep below the surface). About five percent of the park&#x27;s landforms (mostly in its eastern margin near Mount Dana) are metamorphosed volcanic and sedimentary rocks. These roof pendants once formed the roof over the underlying granitic magma.

Erosion acting upon different types of uplift-generated joint and fracture systems is responsible for producing the valleys, canyons, domes, and other features. These joints and fracture systems do not move, and are therefore not faults. Spacing between joints is controlled by the amount of silica in the granite and granodiorite rocks; more silica tends to form a more resistant rock, resulting in larger spaces between joints and fractures.

Pillars and columns, such as Washington Column and Lost Arrow, are generated by cross joints. Erosion acting on master joints is responsible for shaping valleys and later canyons. The single most erosive force over the last few million years has been large alpine glaciers, which turned the previously V-shaped river-cut valleys into U-shaped glacial-cut canyons (such as Yosemite Valley and Hetch Hetchy Valley). Exfoliation (caused by the tendency of crystals in plutonic rocks to expand at the surface) acting on granitic rock with widely spaced joints is responsible for producing domes such as Half Dome and North Dome and inset arches like Royal Arches.

===Popular features===

Yosemite Valley represents only one percent of the park area. The Tunnel View gives a view of the valley. El Capitan is a prominent granite cliff that looms over the valley, and is a rock climbing favorite because of its sheer size, diverse climbing routes, and year-round accessibility. Granite domes such as Sentinel Dome and Half Dome rise , respectively, above the valley floor. The park contains dozens of other granite domes.

The high country of Yosemite contains other important features such as Tuolumne Meadows, Dana Meadows, the Clark Range, the Cathedral Range, and the Kuna Crest. The Sierra Crest and the Pacific Crest Trail run through Yosemite. Mount Dana and Mount Gibbs are peaks of red metamorphic rock. Granite peaks include Mount Conness, Cathedral Peak, and Matterhorn Peak. Mount Lyell is the highest point in the park, standing at . The Lyell Glacier is the largest glacier in the park and one of the few remaining in the Sierra.

The park has three groves of ancient giant sequoia (&quot;Sequoiadendron giganteum&quot;) trees; the Mariposa Grove (200 trees), the Tuolumne Grove (25 trees), and the Merced Grove (20 trees). This species grows larger in volume than any other and is one of the tallest and longest-lived.

===Water and ice===

The Tuolumne and Merced River systems originate along the crest of the Sierra in the park and have carved river canyons deep. The Tuolumne River drains the entire northern portion of the park, an area of approximately . The Merced River begins in the park&#x27;s southern peaks, primarily the Cathedral and Clark Ranges, and drains an area of approximately .

Hydrologic processes, including glaciation, flooding, and fluvial geomorphic response, have been fundamental in creating park landforms. The park contains approximately 3,200 lakes (greater than 100 m2), two reservoirs, and of streams. Wetlands flourish in valley bottoms throughout the park, and are often hydrologically linked to nearby lakes and rivers through seasonal flooding and groundwater. Meadow habitats, distributed at elevations from in the park, are generally wetlands, as are the riparian habitats found on the banks of Yosemite&#x27;s watercourses.
Yosemite is famous for its high concentration of waterfalls in a small area. Numerous sheer drops, glacial steps and hanging valleys in the park feature spectacular cascades, especially during April, May, and June (as the snow melts). Located in Yosemite Valley, Yosemite Falls is the fourth tallest waterfall in North America at according to the World Waterfall Database. Also in the valley is the much lower volume Ribbon Falls, which has the highest single vertical drop, . Perhaps the most prominent of the valley waterfalls is Bridalveil Fall. Wapama Falls in Hetch Hetchy Valley is another notable waterfall. Hundreds of ephemeral waterfalls become active in the park after heavy rains or melting snowpack.

Park glaciers are relatively small and occupy areas that are in almost permanent shade, such as north- and northeast-facing cirques. Lyell Glacier is the largest glacier in Yosemite (the Palisades Glaciers are the largest in the Sierra Nevada) and covers . None of the Yosemite glaciers are a remnant of the Ice Age alpine glaciers responsible for sculpting the Yosemite landscape. Instead, they were formed during one of the neoglacial episodes that have occurred since the thawing of the Ice Age (such as the Little Ice Age). Many Yosemite glaciers have disappeared, such as the Black Mountain Glacier that was marked in 1871 and had gone by the mid-1980s. Yosemite&#x27;s final two glaciers – the Lyell and Maclure glaciers – have receded over the last 100 years and are expected to disappear as a result of climate change.

===Climate===

Yosemite has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Csa&quot;), meaning most precipitation falls during the mild winter, and the other seasons are nearly dry (less than three percent of precipitation falls during the long, hot summers). Because of orographic lift, precipitation increases with elevation up to where it slowly decreases to the crest. Precipitation amounts vary from at elevation to at . Snow does not typically accumulate until November in the high country. It deepens into March or early April.

Mean daily temperatures range from to at Tuolumne Meadows at . At the Wawona Entrance (elevation ), mean daily temperature ranges from . At the lower elevations below , temperatures are hotter; the mean daily high temperature at Yosemite Valley (elevation ) varies from . At elevations above , the hot, dry summer temperatures are moderated by frequent summer thunderstorms, along with snow that can persist into July. The combination of dry vegetation, low relative humidity, and thunderstorms results in frequent lightning-caused fires as well.

At park headquarters (elevation ), January averages , while July averages . In summer the nights are much cooler than the days. An average of 45.5 days have highs of or higher and an average of 105.6 nights with freezing temperatures. Freezing temperatures have been recorded in every month of the year. The record high temperature was on July 22 and July 24, 1915, while the record low temperature was on January 1, 2009. Average annual precipitation is nearly , falling on 67 days. The wettest year was 1983 with and the driest year was 1976 with . The most precipitation in one month was in December 1955 and the most in one day was on December 23, 1955. Average annual snowfall is . The snowiest winter was 1948–1949 with . The most snow in one month was in January 1993.

==Geology==
===Tectonic and volcanic activity===

The location of the park was a passive continental margin during the Precambrian and early Paleozoic. Sediment was derived from continental sources and was deposited in shallow water. These rocks became deformed and metamorphosed.

Heat generated from the Farallon Plate subducting below the North American Plate led to the creation of an island arc of volcanoes on the west coast of proto-North America between the late Devonian and Permian periods. Material accreted onto the western edge of North America, and mountains were raised to the east in Nevada.

The first phase of regional plutonism started 210 million years ago in the late Triassic and continued throughout the Jurassic to about 150 million years before present (BP), which led to the creation of the Sierra Nevada Batholith. The resulting rocks were mostly granitic in composition and lay about below the surface. Around the same time, the Nevadan orogeny built the Nevadan mountain range (also called the Ancestral Sierra Nevada) to a height of .

The second major pluton emplacement phase lasted from about 120 million to 80 million years ago during the Cretaceous. This was part of the Sevier orogeny.

Starting 20 million years ago (in the Cenozoic) and lasting until 5 million years ago, a now-extinct extension of Cascade Range volcanoes erupted, bringing large amounts of igneous material in the area. These igneous deposits blanketed the region north of the Yosemite region. Volcanic activity persisted past 5 million years BP east of the current park borders in the Mono Lake and Long Valley areas.

===Uplift and erosion===

Starting 10 million years ago, vertical movement along the Sierra fault started to uplift the Sierra Nevada. Subsequent tilting of the Sierra block and the resulting accelerated uplift of the Sierra Nevada increased the gradient of western-flowing streams. The streams consequently ran faster and thus cut their valleys more quickly. Additional uplift occurred when major faults developed to the east, forming Owens Valley from Basin and Range-associated extensional forces. Sierra uplift accelerated again about two million years ago during the Pleistocene.

The uplifting and increased erosion exposed granitic rocks to surface pressures, resulting in exfoliation (responsible for the rounded shape of the many domes in the park) and mass wasting following the numerous fracture joint planes (cracks; especially vertical ones) in the now solidified plutons. Pleistocene glaciers further accelerated this process, while glacial meltwater transported the resulting talus and till from valley floors.

Numerous vertical joint planes controlled where and how fast erosion took place. Most of these long, linear and very deep cracks trend northeast or northwest and form parallel, often regularly spaced sets.

===Glacial sculpting===

A series of glaciations further modified the region starting about 2 to 3 million years ago and ending sometime around 10,000 BP. At least four major glaciations occurred in the Sierra, locally called the Sherwin (also called the pre-Tahoe), Tahoe, Tenaya, and Tioga. The Sherwin glaciers were the largest, filling Yosemite and other valleys, while later stages produced much smaller glaciers. A Sherwin-age glacier was almost surely responsible for the major excavation and shaping of Yosemite Valley and other canyons in the area.

Glacial systems reached depths of up to and left their marks. The longest glacier ran down the Grand Canyon of the Tuolumne River for , passing well beyond Hetch Hetchy Valley. Merced Glacier flowed out of Yosemite Valley and into the Merced River Gorge. Lee Vining Glacier carved Lee Vining Canyon and emptied into Lake Russel (the much-enlarged ice age version of Mono Lake). Only the highest peaks, such as Mount Dana and Mount Conness, were not covered by glaciers. Retreating glaciers often left recessional moraines that impounded lakes such as the long Lake Yosemite (a shallow lake that periodically covered much of the floor of Yosemite Valley).

==Ecology==
===Habitats===

The park has an elevation range from and contains five major vegetation zones: chaparral and oak woodland, lower montane forest, upper montane forest, subalpine zone, and alpine. Of California&#x27;s 7,000 plant species, approximately 50 percent occur in the Sierra Nevada and more than 20 percent within the park. The park contains suitable habitat for more than 160 rare plants, with rare local geologic formations and unique soils characterizing the restricted ranges many of these plants occupy.

With its scrubby sun-baked chaparral, stately groves of pine, fir, and sequoia, and expanses of alpine woodlands and meadows, Yosemite National Park preserves a Sierra landscape as it prevailed before Euro-American settlement. In contrast to surrounding lands, which have been significantly altered by logging, the park contains some of old-growth forest. Taken together, the park&#x27;s varied habitats support over 250 species of vertebrates, which include fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals.

Yosemite&#x27;s western boundary has habitats dominated by mixed coniferous forests of ponderosa pine, sugar pine, incense cedar, white fir, Douglas fir, and a few stands of giant sequoia, interspersed by areas of black oak and canyon live oak. These habitats support relatively high wildlife diversity. Wildlife include black bear, coyote, raccoon, mountain kingsnake, Gilbert&#x27;s skink, white-headed woodpecker, bobcat, river otter, gray fox, red fox, brown creeper, two species of skunk, cougar, spotted owl, and bats.

At higher elevation, the coniferous forests become purer stands of red fir, western white pine, Jeffrey pine, lodgepole pine, and the occasional foxtail pine. Fewer wildlife species tend to be found in these habitats, because of their higher elevation and lower complexity. Animals include golden-mantled ground squirrel, chickaree, fisher, Steller&#x27;s jay, hermit thrush, and American goshawk. Reptiles are not common, but include rubber boa, western fence lizard, and northern alligator lizard.
As the landscape rises, trees become smaller and more sparse, with stands broken by areas of exposed granite. These include lodgepole pine, whitebark pine, and mountain hemlock that, at highest elevations, give way to vast expanses of granite as treeline is reached. The climate in these habitats is harsh and the growing season is short, but species such as pika, yellow-bellied marmot, white-tailed jackrabbit, Clark&#x27;s nutcracker, and black rosy finch are adapted to these conditions. Treeless alpine habitats are favored by Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep. This species is found in the Yosemite area only around Tioga Pass, where a small, reintroduced population exists.

At a variety of elevations, meadows provide important habitat. Animals come to feed on the green grasses and use the flowing and standing water found in many meadows. Predators follow these animals. The interface between meadow and forest is favored by many animal species because of the proximity of open areas for foraging and cover for protection. Species that are highly dependent upon meadow habitat include great grey owl, willow flycatcher, Yosemite toad, and mountain beaver.

===Management issues===

The black bears of Yosemite were once famous for breaking into parked cars to steal food. They were an encouraged tourist sight for many years at the park&#x27;s garbage dumps, where they congregated to eat garbage, and tourists gathered to photograph them. Increasing bear/human encounters and increasing property damage led to an aggressive campaign to discourage bears from interacting with people and their stuff. The open-air dumps were closed; trash receptacles were replaced with bear-proof receptacles; campgrounds were equipped with bear-proof food lockers so that people would not leave food in their vehicles. Because bears who show aggression towards people usually are destroyed, park personnel have come up with innovative ways to lead bears to associate humans and their property with experiences such as getting hit with a rubber bullet. , about 30 bears a year were captured and ear-tagged and their DNA sampled so that, when bear damage occurs, rangers can ascertain which bear was causing the problem.

Despite the richness of high-quality habitats in Yosemite, the brown bear, California condor, and least Bell&#x27;s vireo have become extinct in the park within historical time, and another 37 species currently have special status under either California or federal endangered species legislation. The most serious current threats include loss of a natural fire regime, exotic species, air pollution, habitat fragmentation, and climate change. On a more local basis, factors such as road kills and the availability of human food have affected some wildlife species.
Yosemite National Park has documented the presence of more than 130 non-native plant species within park boundaries. They were introduced into Yosemite following the migration of early Euro-American settlers in the late 1850s. Natural and human-caused disturbances, such as wildland fires and construction activities, have contributed to a rapid increase in the spread of non-native plants. Some of these species invade and displace the native plant communities, impacting park resources. Non-native plants can bring about significant ecosystem changes by altering native plant communities and the processes that support them. Some non-native species may cause an increase in fire frequency or increase the available soil nitrogen that allow other non-native plants to establish. Many non-native species, such as yellow star thistle (&quot;Centaurea solstitialis&quot;), are able to produce a long tap root that allows them to out-compete the native plants for available water.

Bull thistle (&quot;Cirsium vulgare&quot;), common mullein (&quot;Verbascum thapsus&quot;), and Klamath weed (&quot;Hypericum perforatum&quot;) have been identified as noxious pests in Yosemite since the 1940s. More recently recognized species are yellow star thistle (&quot;Centaurea solstitialis&quot;), sweet clover (&quot;Melilot&quot; spp.), Himalayan blackberry (&quot;Rubus armeniacus&quot;), cut-leaved blackberry (&quot;Rubus laciniatus&quot;) and large periwinkle (&quot;Vinca major&quot;).

Increasing ozone pollution causes tissue damage to sequoia trees, making them more vulnerable to insect infestation and disease. Since the cones of these trees require fire-touched soil to germinate, historic fire suppression has reduced their ability to reproduce. Planned prescribed fires may help the germination issue.

===Wildfires ===

Indigenous residents intentionally set small fires in the early 1860s and before to clear the ground of brush as part as their farming practices. These fires are comparable to contemporary practices such as controlled burns that are done by the U.S. Forest Service and others. Although it was not their primary reason, Yosemite Natives helped preserve biodiversity and resilience by lighting these small fires. Native Americans used fire as an early wildlife management tool to keep certain lands clear, resulting in more food for large animals and decreasing the chance of large forest fires which that now devastate forest ecosystems. Some early uncontrolled forest fires were set accidentally by the militia group led by Major John Savage when the group burned down the Ahwahneechee camp in an attempt to expel them. The house fires eventually spread to a large section of the forest and the militia group ended up having to abandon their raid to save their own camp from the conflagration.

Forest fires clear the park of dead vegetation, making way for new growth. Small fires damage the income generated by tourism. During late July and early August, 2018, the Valley and other sections of the park, temporarily closed due to the Ferguson Fire at its western boundary. The closing was the largest in almost thirty years.

==Activities==

===Public access===
Yosemite National Park is open year-round, though certain roads close during snowy months, usually from November through May or June. Certain trails also close during winter, including The 4-Mile Trail and part of The Mist Trail.

Traffic congestion in the valley is heavy during peak summer season (June to August) and a free shuttle bus system operates in the valley. Parking in the valley during the summer is often full. Transit options are available from Fresno and Merced.

The natural and cultural history of Yosemite Valley is presented at the Yosemite Valley Visitor Center, the adjoining Yosemite Museum, and the Nature Center at Happy Isles. The parks&#x27; two National Historic Landmarks are the Sierra Club&#x27;s LeConte Memorial Lodge (Yosemite&#x27;s first public visitor center), and the Ahwahnee Hotel. Camp 4 is on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Hiking===

Over of trails are available to hikers—everything from an easy stroll to a challenging mountain hike, or backpacking trips. The popular Half Dome hike to the summit of Half Dome requires a permit whenever the cables are up (usually from Memorial Day weekend to Columbus Day). A maximum of 300 hikers, selected by lottery, are permitted to advance beyond the base of the subdome each day, including 225 day hikers and 75 backpackers.

The park can be divided into five sections—Yosemite Valley, Wawona/Mariposa Grove/Glacier Point, Tuolumne Meadows, Hetch Hetchy, and Crane Flat/White Wolf. Numerous books describe park trails, while the National Park Service provides free information.

Between late spring and early fall, much of the park can be accessed for backpacking trips. All overnight trips into the back country require a wilderness permit and most require approved bear-resistant food storage.

===Driving===

While some locations in Yosemite are accessible only on foot, other locations can be reached via road. The most famous road is Tioga Road.

Bicycles are allowed on the roads, but only of paved off-road trails are available in Yosemite Valley itself; mountain biking is not allowed.

===Climbing===

Rock climbing is an important part of Yosemite. In particular the valley is surrounded by summits such as Half Dome and El Capitan. Camp 4 is a walk-in campground in the Valley that was instrumental in the development of rock climbing as a sport, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Climbers can generally be spotted in the snow-free months on anything from ten-foot-high (3 m) boulders to the face of El Capitan. Classes on rock climbing are offered there.

Tuolumne Meadows is well known for rock and mountain climbing.

===Winter activities===

Away from the Valley, the park is snowed in during the winter months, with many roads closed. Downhill skiing is available at the Badger Pass Ski Area—the oldest downhill skiing area in California, operating from mid-December through early April. Much of the park is open to cross-country skiing and snowshoeing, and backcountry ski huts are available. Wilderness permits are required for backcountry overnight ski trips.

The Bracebridge dinner is an annual holiday event, held since 1927 at the Ahwahnee Hotel, inspired by Washington Irving&#x27;s descriptions of Squire Bracebridge and English Christmas traditions of the 18th century in his &quot;Sketch Book&quot;. Between 1929 and 1973, the show was organized by Ansel Adams.

===Other===
Yosemite has 13 official campgrounds.

Bicycle rentals are available from spring through fall. Over of paved bike paths are available in Yosemite Valley. In addition, bicyclists can ride on roads. Helmets are required for children under 18 years of age. Off-trail riding and mountain biking are not permitted in the park.

Water activities are plentiful during warmer months. Rafting can be done through the valley on the Merced River from late May to July. Swimming pools are available at Yosemite Lodge and Curry Village.

===Horsetail Fall===
Horsetail Fall flows over the eastern edge of El Capitan. This small waterfall usually flows only during winter and is easy to miss. On rare occasions during mid- to late February, it can glow orange when backlit by sunset. This unique lighting effect happens only on evenings with a clear sky. Minor haze or cloudiness can spoil the effect. Although entirely natural, the phenomenon is reminiscent of the human-caused Firefall that historically occurred from Glacier Point.

==In popular culture==

The opening scenes of &quot;Star Trek V: The Final Frontier&quot; (1989) were filmed in Yosemite National Park. Films such as &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; (1920) and &quot;Maverick&quot; (1994) have also been shot there. The 2014 documentary &quot;Valley Uprising&quot; is centered around Yosemite Valley and its history with an emphasis on climbing culture. The Academy Award-winning 2018 documentary &quot;Free Solo&quot; was filmed in Yosemite. &quot;The Dawn Wall,&quot; a 2017 documentary, was filmed there.

<doc id="48666" wikidata="Q156054" url="?curid=48666" title="Tocantins River">
<text>The Tocantins River ( , Parkatêjê: &quot;Pyti&quot; [pɨˈti]) is a river in Brazil, the central fluvial artery of the country. In the Tupi language, its name means &quot;toucan&#x27;s beak&quot; (&quot;Tukã&quot; for &quot;toucan&quot; and &quot;Ti&quot; for &quot;beak&quot;). It runs from south to north for about . While sometimes included in definitions of the Amazon basin, the Tocantins is not a branch of the Amazon River, since its waters flow into the Atlantic Ocean via an eastern channel of the Amazon Delta, alongside those of the Amazon proper. It flows through four Brazilian states (Goiás, Tocantins, Maranhão, and Pará) and gives its name to one of Brazil&#x27;s newest states, formed in 1988 from what was until then the northern portion of Goiás.

The Tocantins is one of the largest clearwater rivers in South America.

== Course ==
It rises in the mountainous district known as the Pireneus, west of the Federal District, but its western tributary, the Araguaia River, has its extreme southern headwaters on the slopes of the Serra dos Caiapós. The Araguaia flows before its confluence with the Tocantins, to which it is almost equal in volume. Besides its main tributary, the Rio das Mortes, the Araguaia has twenty smaller branches, offering many miles of canoe navigation. In finding its way to the lowlands, it breaks frequently into waterfalls and rapids, or winds violently through rocky gorges, until, at a point about above its junction with the Tocantins, it saws its way across a rocky dyke for in roaring cataracts.

Two other tributaries, called the Maranhão and Paranatinga, collect an immense volume of water from the highlands which surround them, especially on the south and south-east. Between the latter and the confluence with the Araguaia, the Tocantins is occasionally obstructed by rocky barriers which cross it almost at a right angle.

==Fauna==

The Tocantins basin (which includes the Araguaia River) is the home of several large aquatic mammals such as Amazonian manatee, Araguaian river dolphin and tucuxi, and larger reptiles such as black caiman, spectacled caiman and yellow-spotted river turtle.

The Tocantins River Basin has a high richness of fish species, although it is relatively low by Amazon basin standards. More than 350 fish species have been registered, including more than 175 endemics. The most species rich families are Characidae (tetras and allies), Loricariidae (pleco catfish and allies) and Rivulidae (South American killifish). While most species essentially are of Amazonian origin, there are also some showing a connection with the Paraná and São Francisco rivers. The Tocantins and these two rivers flow in different directions, but all have their source in the Brazilian Plateau in a region where a low watershed allows some exchange between them. There are several fish species that migrate along the Tocantins to spawn, but this has been restricted by the dams. Following the construction of the massive Tucuruí Dam, the flow of the river changed. Some species have been adversely affected and there has been a substantial reduction in species richness in parts of the river.

The São Domingos karst in the upper Tocantins basin is home to an unusually high number of cavefish species (more than any other region in the Americas): &quot;Ancistrus cryptophthalmus&quot;, several &quot;Ituglanis&quot; species, &quot;Pimelodella spelaea&quot;, &quot;Aspidoras mephisto&quot;, an undescribed &quot;Cetopsorhamdia&quot; species and &quot;Eigenmannia vicentespelaea&quot;. The last is the only known cave-adapted knifefish and one of only two known non-catfish in caves of the South American mainland (the other is the characid &quot;Stygichthys typhlops&quot;).

In its lower reaches, the Tocantins separates the Tocantins–Araguaia–Maranhão moist forests ecoregion to the east from the Xingu–Tocantins–Araguaia moist forests ecoregion to the west. It acts as a barrier that prevents dispersal of flora and fauna between these ecoregions.

== Dams ==
Downstream from the Araguaia confluence, in the state of Pará, the river used to have many cataracts and rapids, but they were flooded in the early 1980s by the artificial lake created by the Tucuruí Dam, one of the world&#x27;s largest. When the second phase of the Tucuruí project was completed on November 30, 2010, a system of locks called Eclusas do Tucuruí was established with the goal of making a long extension of the river navigable.

In total there are seven dams on the river (Serra da Mesa dam, Cana Brava dam, São Salvador dam, Peixe Angical dam, Luiz Eduardo Magalhães (Lajeado) dam, Estreito dam, and Tucuruí dam), of which the largest are the Tucuruí and the Serra da Mesa dam.

== Geology ==
The flat, broad valleys, composed of sand and clay, of both the Tocantins and its Araguaia branch are overlooked by steep bluffs. They are the margins of the great sandstone plateaus, from elevation above sea-level, through which the rivers have eroded their deep beds. Around the estuary of the Tocantins the great plateau has disappeared, having been replaced by a part of the forest-covered, half submerged alluvial plain, which extends far to the north-east and west. The Pará River, generally called one of the mouths of the Amazon, is only the lower reach of the Tocantins. If any portion of the waters of the Amazon runs round the southern side of the large island of Marajó into the river Para, it is only through tortuous, natural canals, which are in no sense outflow channels of the Amazon.

== Discharge ==
The Tocantins River records a mean discharge rate of and a specific discharge rate of . The sub-basins have the following specific discharge rates: Tocantins (), Araguaia (), Pará () and Guamá ().

<doc id="48668" wikidata="Q655819" url="?curid=48668" title="Perlite">
<text>Perlite is an amorphous volcanic glass that has a relatively high water content, typically formed by the hydration of obsidian. It occurs naturally and has the unusual property of greatly expanding when heated sufficiently. It is an industrial mineral, suitable &quot;as ceramic flux to lower the sintering temperature&quot;, and a commercial product useful for its low density after processing.

==Properties==

Perlite softens when it reaches temperatures of . Water trapped in the structure of the material vaporises and escapes, and this causes the expansion of the material to 7–16 times its original volume. The expanded material is a brilliant white, due to the reflectivity of the trapped bubbles. Unexpanded (&quot;raw&quot;) perlite has a bulk density around 1100 kg/m3 (1.1 g/cm3), while typical expanded perlite has a bulk density of about 30–150 kg/m3 (0.03–0.150 g/cm3).

==Typical analysis==
*70–75% silicon dioxide: SiO2
*12–15% aluminium oxide: Al2O3
*3–4% sodium oxide: Na2O
*3–5% potassium oxide: K2O
*0.5-2% iron oxide: Fe2O3
*0.2–0.7% magnesium oxide: MgO
*0.5–1.5% calcium oxide: CaO
*3–5% loss on ignition (chemical / combined water)
==Sources and production==

Perlite is a non-renewable resource. The world reserves of perlite are estimated at 700 million tonnes.

The confirmed resources of perlite existing in Armenia amount to 150 million m3, whereas the total amount of projected resources reaches up to 3 billion m3. Considering specific density of 1.1 ton/m3 confirmed reserves in Armenia amount to 165 million tons.

Other reported reserves are: Greece - 120 million tonnes, Turkey, USA and Hungary - about 49-57 million tonnes.

Perlite world production, led by China, Turkey, Greece, USA, Armenia and Hungary, summed up to 4.6 million tonnes in 2018.

Osham hills of Patanvav, Gujarat, India are the only source of mineral Perlite in India.

== Uses ==
Because of its low density and relatively low price (about US$150 per tonne of unexpanded perlite), many commercial applications for perlite have been developed.

=== Construction and manufacturing ===
In the construction and manufacturing fields, it is used in lightweight plasters, concrete and mortar, insulation and ceiling tiles. It may also be used to build composite materials that are sandwich-structured or to create syntactic foam.

Perlite filters are fairly common in filtering beer before it is bottled.

Small quantities of perlite are also used in foundries, cryogenic insulation, and ceramics (as a clay additive). It is also used by the explosives industry.

=== Aquatic filtration ===
Perlite is currently used in commercial pool filtration technology, as a replacement to diatomaceous earth filters. Perlite is an excellent filtration aid and is used extensively as an alternative to diatomaceous earth. The popularity of perlite usage as a filter medium is growing considerably worldwide. Several products exist in the market to provide perlite based filtration. Several perlite filters and perlite media have met NSF-50 approval (Aquify PMF Series and AquaPerl), which standardizes water quality and technology safety and performance. Perlite can be safely disposed of through existing sewage systems, although some pool operators choose to separate the perlite using settling tanks or screening systems to be disposed of separately.

=== Biotechnology ===
Due to thermal and mechanical stability, non-toxicity, and high resistance against microbial attacks and organic solvents, perlite is widely used in biotechnological applications. Perlite was found to be an excellent support for immobilization of biocatalysts such as enzymes for bioremediation and sensing applications.

=== Agriculture ===

In horticulture, perlite can be used as a soil amendment or alone as a medium for hydroponics or for starting cuttings. When used as an amendment, it has high permeability and low water retention and helps prevent soil compaction.

=== Cosmetics ===
Perlite is used in cosmetics as an absorbent and mechanical exfoliant. 


===Substitutes===
Perlite can be replaced for all of its uses. Substitutes include:
*Diatomite, used for filter-aids
*Expanded clay, an alternative lightweight filler for building materials
*Shale
*Pumice
*Slag
*Vermiculite - many expanders of perlite are also exfoliating vermiculite and belong to both trade associations

== Occupational safety ==
As perlite contains silicon dioxide, goggles and silica filtering masks are recommended when handling large quantities.

=== United States ===
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for perlite exposure in the workplace as 15 mg/m3 total exposure and 5 mg/m3 respiratory exposure over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 10 mg/m3 total exposure and 5 mg/m3 respiratory exposure over an 8-hour workday.

<doc id="48671" wikidata="Q181461" url="?curid=48671" title="Downing College, Cambridge">
<text>Downing College is a constituent college of the University of Cambridge and currently has around 950 students. Founded in 1800, it was the only college to be added to Cambridge University between 1596 and 1869, and is often described as the oldest of the new colleges and the newest of the old. Downing College was formed &quot;for the encouragement of the study of Law and Medicine and of the cognate subjects of Moral and Natural Science&quot;, and has developed a reputation amongst Cambridge colleges for Law and Medicine.

In 2012, Downing was named one of the two most eco-friendly Cambridge colleges.

== History ==

Upon the death of Sir George Downing, 3rd Baronet in 1749, the wealth left by his grandfather, Sir George Downing, 1st Baronet, who served both Cromwell and Charles II and built 10 Downing Street (a door formerly from Number 10 is in use in the college), was applied by his will. Under this will, as he had no direct issue (he was legally separated from his wife), the family fortune was left to his cousin, Sir Jacob Downing, 4th Baronet, and if he died without heir, to three cousins in succession. If they all died without issue, the estates were to be used to found a college at Cambridge called Downing.

Sir Jacob died in 1764, and as the other named heirs had also died, the college should have come into existence then, but Sir Jacob&#x27;s widow, Margaret, refused to give up the estates and the various relatives who were Sir George&#x27;s legal heirs had to take costly and prolonged action in the Court of Chancery to compel her to do so. She died in 1778 but her second husband and the son of her sister continued to resist the heirs-at-law&#x27;s action until 1800 when the court decided in favour of Sir George&#x27;s will and George III granted Downing a royal charter, marking the official foundation of the college.

==Buildings==
The architect William Wilkins was commissioned by the trustees of the Downing estate, who included the Master of Clare College and St John&#x27;s College and the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, to design the plan for the college. Wilkins, a disciple of the neo-classical architectural style, designed the first wholly campus-based college plan in the world based on a magnificent entrance on Downing Street reaching back to form the largest court in Cambridge, extending to Lensfield Road. But this was not to be.

The estate was much reduced by the suit in Chancery, and the grand plans failed. Much of the north side of what was then the Pembroke Leys was sold to the university and is now home to scientific buildings (&quot;The Downing Site&quot;). In fact, only limited East and West ranges were initially built, with the plans for a library and chapel on the south face of the college shelved.
The third side of the square was only completed in 1951 with the building of the college chapel. Where the fourth side would have been is now a large paddock (known simply as &quot;The Paddock&quot;), with many trees. Though not fully enclosed, the court formed before the Downing College is perhaps largest in Cambridge or Oxford (a title contested with Trinity College&#x27;s Great Court). An urban legend amongst Cambridge students claims that Trinity pays an undisclosed sum to the college annually with the condition that it will never build the fourth side of the square, so that Trinity may maintain the distinction of having the largest enclosed court of all colleges of Cambridge.

The most recent building additions are the Howard Lodge accommodation, the Howard Building, and most recent of all the Howard Theatre which opened in 2010. These were sponsored by the Howard Foundation, and are located behind the main court around their own small garden. These facilities are used for conference and businesses gatherings outside the student term.

=== Heong Gallery ===

The Heong Gallery, opened in February 2016, is a modern and contemporary art gallery at Downing. It is named for Alwyn Heong, an alumnus of the college, who is a supporter of the visual arts. The conversion of a stables building by Caruso St John won a RIBA regional award.

==Student life==

Downing students remain prominent in the university world; in the past few years Cambridge Union Presidents, Blues captains, Law and Economic Society Presidents and more have hailed from the college. Downing has a particular reputation for law.

&quot;The Griffin&quot; has been the undergraduate student magazine for over 100 years.
===Sport===

The college fields teams in a range of sports including, men&#x27;s football, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s rugby, tennis and ultimate.

Downing College Rugby Union Football Club is one of Cambridge’s top teams, having secured victory in both the 2019 Cuppers and 2022 Shield competitions. The rise of Downing has also included a win in the Plate competition during the 2017/18 season.

Downing College Boat Club is successful too, with the Women&#x27;s first boat gaining Lents Headship of the river in 2004 and most recently in 2020, and the Mays Headship in the 2014 and 2015 May Bumps. The men&#x27;s first boat has held the headship several times in the 1980s and 1990s (for example in 1994 to 1996) while gaining the Mays headship in 1996
and the Lents Headship in 2014, on each occasion recognising the tradition of &quot;burning the boat&quot; (using an old wooden 8 oared boat), while the rowers of the winning boat jump the flames. They both currently hold positions at or near the top in both University bumps races [Lents and Mays].

==Gallery==
==People associated with Downing==
The college is renowned for its strong legal tradition, being built up by Clive Parry, his pupil and successor John Hopkins and Graham Virgo. Legal notables who have been honorary fellows of the college include the late Sir John Smith, the pre-eminent criminal lawyer of his generation; Lord Collins of Mapesbury, the first solicitor to be appointed to the Court of Appeal and House of Lords; and Sir Robert Jennings, former President of the International Court of Justice.

<doc id="48672" wikidata="Q38511" url="?curid=48672" title="Turku">
<text>Turku ( ; ; , ) is a city in Finland and the regional capital of Southwest Finland. It is located on the southwestern coast of the country at the mouth of the River Aura. The population of Turku is approximately , while the metropolitan area has a population of approximately . It is the most populous municipality in Finland, and the third most populous urban area in the country after Helsinki and Tampere.

Turku is Finland&#x27;s oldest city. It is not known when Turku was granted city status. Pope Gregory IX first mentioned the town of &quot;Aboa&quot; in his &quot;Bulla&quot; in 1229, and this year is now used as the founding year of the city. Turku was the most important city in the eastern part of the Kingdom of Sweden (today&#x27;s Finland). After the Finnish War, Finland became an autonomous Grand Duchy of the Russian Empire in 1809, and Turku became the capital of the Grand Duchy. However, Turku lost its status as capital only three years later in 1812, when Tsar Alexander I of Russia decided to move the capital to Helsinki. It was only after the last great fire in 1827 that most government institutions were moved to Helsinki along with the Royal Academy of Turku, founded in 1640, which later became the University of Helsinki, thus consolidating Helsinki&#x27;s position as the new capital. Turku was Finland&#x27;s most populous city until the late 1840s and remains the regional capital, an important business and cultural centre, and a port.

Due to its long history, Turku has been the site of many important events and, as a former capital, has had a major influence on Finnish history. Together with Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, Turku was named European Capital of Culture for 2011. In 1996, the city of Turku was declared the &quot;Christmas City&quot; of Finland. Turku has also been officially declared the Food Capital of Finland, as it is home to some of Finland&#x27;s oldest and highest quality restaurants, as well as a historically famous fish market held twice a year. Turku&#x27;s canteen and café culture has often been compared to French food culture, which is why Turku is also known as the &quot;Paris of Finland&quot;, hence the Swedish saying: &quot;Varför Paris, vi har ju Åbo!&quot; (&quot;Why Paris, we have Turku!&quot;).

Turku is a bilingual municipality with Finnish and Swedish as its official languages. The population consists of Finnish speakers, Swedish speakers, and speakers of other languages, which is well above the national average.

Due to its location, the Port of Turku is an important commercial and passenger seaport, with over three million passengers travelling to Stockholm and Mariehamn each year.

==Names and etymology==

The Finnish name &quot;Turku&quot; originates from an Old East Slavic word, &quot;&quot;, which in modern Russian means market place, haggling or trading. The word was also borrowed into Swedish as , &quot;market&quot;, but it likely entered Finnish directly, rather than via Swedish. Over time, the original meaning faded, and by the Middle Ages, &quot;&quot; had become synonymous with the town&#x27;s name. Today the word is rarely used outside idiomatic expressions.

The Swedish name &quot;Åbo&quot; may be a simple combination of &quot;å&quot; (&quot;river; creek; large stream&quot;) and &quot;bo&quot; (&quot;dwelling&quot;). There is however an old legal term called &quot;&quot; (meaning roughly &quot;right to live at&quot;), which gave citizens (called &quot;åbo&quot;) the inheritable right to live at land owned by the crown (&quot;å&quot; meant &quot;at&quot; or &quot;on&quot; in old Swedish, now &quot;på&quot;).

In Finnish, the genitive of &quot;Turku&quot; is Turun, meaning &quot;of Turku&quot;. The Finnish names of organizations and institutes of Turku often begin with this word, as in &quot;Turun yliopisto&quot; for the University of Turku.

==History==

Turku has a long history as Finland&#x27;s largest city and occasionally as the administrative center of the country, but for the last two hundred years has been surpassed by Helsinki. The city&#x27;s identity stems from its status as the oldest city in Finland and the country&#x27;s first capital. Originally, the word &quot;Finland&quot; referred only to the area around Turku (hence the title, &quot;Finland Proper&quot; for the region).

===Early history===

Settlement in the Turku area is relatively recent, as the Southwestern Finland remained below sea level for an extended period due to the Ice Age. Due to tectonic uplift, the Turku region transformed from an outlying archipelago to a shoreline during 3000-2000 BCE. The area was densely populated during the Iron Age as it was the most important agricultural region in the region. Ancient cemeteries dating from 550 to 1150 have been discovered in the region. Some cemeteries were utilized during the initial migratory phase, while some were solely utilized during the Viking Age, and others were established in the 12th century. There are also remains of houses and villages and old forts from the late Iron Age.

According to legend, the English bishop Henry baptised the first Finns into Christianity in 1150. However, the first Christian graves date from the 10th and 11th centuries, and the first archaeological evidence of a church dates from the 12th century. In the 11th century, the Turku region began to develop as a port. The oldest known road, Hämeen härkätie, connected to region and the Old Castle of Lieto to Tavastia in the 9th century at the latest. Early literary sources such as Al-Idrisi&#x27;s world map from 1154 mentions Turku.

===Swedish era===

According to the permission granted by Pope Gregory IX on 23 January 1229, the episcopal seat was moved from Nousiainen to Koroinen, which is located near the current center of Turku. There is nothing to suggest that the actual city of Turku still existed at this point; however, the city was not founded on uninhabited land, but there were fields and probably also a peasant village. Since no reliable document has survived about the year of the city&#x27;s founding, it has also been speculated that the city was founded in the 1280s or 1290s by the joint initiative of the king, the bishop, and the , which itself was founded in 1249.

Turku Cathedral was consecrated in 1300. During the Middle Ages, Turku was the seat of the Bishop of Turku (a title later upgraded to Archbishop of Turku), covering then the eastern half of the Kingdom of Sweden (most of the present-day Finland) until the 17th century. Even if Turku had no official capital status, it was for a long time the most important city in Finland as part of the trade and shipping of the Hanseatic League. In the 14th century, two-thirds of the city&#x27;s burghers were German, but gradually the proportion of domestic burghers increased. In addition to the ecclesiastical authority, the only lawspeakers in Finland operated in Turku, and from the 15th century to the 16th century, the court exercising the country&#x27;s highest judicial power, the , met in the city.

At the beginning of the 16th century, in connection with the disputes of the Kalmar Union, the Danes destroyed the city twice, in 1509 under the leadership of Admiral Otte Rud and in 1522 under the leadership of Admiral Søren Norby, until Erik Fleming&#x27;s troops expelled the Danes from Finland in 1523. After the beginning of peace, Gustav Vasa, who had just become king, thoroughly got to know different parts of his kingdom, the center of the king&#x27;s first visit to Finland being Turku Castle, where he lived during his visit. The new king also brought with him the religious reformation, and the first to preach the new doctrine was Petrus Särkilahti. Särkilahti&#x27;s student Mikael Agricola, who is known as the &quot;father of Finnish literary language&quot;, continued the religious reform first as the headmaster of the cathedral school and later as the Bishop of Turku. Duke John (later John III), the son of Gustav Vasa, received the title of Duke of Finland and ruled his territory from Turku Castle before becoming next king of Sweden after his brother, Eric XIV.

In the aftermath of the War against Sigismund, the city was the site of the Åbo Bloodbath. After that, the 17th century began as more peaceful period for Turku, when the focus was mainly on emphasizing Turku&#x27;s position as the center of a wide area by establishing numerous new administrative and school institutions. In 1640, the first university in Finland, the Royal Academy of Turku, was founded in Turku by order of Queen Christina. This project was also supported by Count Per Brahe, the Governor General of Finland, and Isaacus Rothovius, the Bishop of Turku. Turku was also the meeting place for the States of Finland in 1676.

===Russian era===

After the Finnish War, Sweden ceded Finland to Imperial Russia at the Treaty of Fredrikshamn in 1809. There was no resistance of any kind in Turku when the Russians marched into the city in October 1809 in connection with the Finnish War. Despite the occupation, life in Turku continued peacefully. The Court of Appeal of Turku continued its session when the Russians arrived, and later in the spring Jacob Tengström, the Archbishop of Turku and Finland, and the teaching staff of the Turku Academy swore an oath of loyalty to their new ruler.

Turku became briefly the official capital, but soon lost the status to Helsinki, as Emperor Alexander I felt that Turku was too far from Russia and too aligned with Sweden to serve as the capital of the Grand Duchy of Finland. The change officially took place in 1812. The government offices that remained in Turku were finally moved to the new capital after the Great Fire of Turku, which destroyed a large portion of the city in 1827. After the fire, a new and safer city plan was drawn up by German architect Carl Ludvig Engel, who had also designed the new capital, Helsinki. The new city plan, based on a regular grid plan, was more spacious and fire-safe than before, and after the reconstruction, Turku was one of the most unified architecture in Europe. Turku remained the largest city in Finland for another twenty years.

In the middle of the 19th century, Turku was, after Helsinki, the most important craft city in Finland, but the Industrial Revolution with steam and electric machines was experienced in Turku only around 1900. The First World War provided a boost to the city&#x27;s industry, as the export difficulties affected the wood industry, which Turku didn&#x27;t have much of, and it was easy to get much-needed raw materials from neutral Sweden.

===After independence===

In 1918, a new university, the Åbo Akademi – the only Swedish-language university in Finland – was founded in Turku. Two years later, the Finnish-language University of Turku was founded alongside it. These two universities are the second and third to be founded in Finland, both by private donations.

In the 20th century, Turku was called &quot;Finland&#x27;s gateway to the West&quot; by historians such as . The city enjoyed good connections with other Western European countries and cities, especially since the 1940s with Stockholm across the Gulf of Bothnia. In the 1960s, Turku became the first Western city to sign a twinning agreement with Leningrad in the Soviet Union, leading to greater inter-cultural exchange and providing a new meaning to the city&#x27;s &#x27;gateway&#x27; function. After the fall of communism in Russia, many prominent Soviets came to Turku to study Western business practices, among them Vladimir Putin, then Leningrad&#x27;s deputy mayor.
As for architecture in the city, both the body of architectural styles as well as the prevalent way of living have experienced significant changes in the 20th century. While having survived relatively intact throughout the years of war 1939–1945, the city faced increasing changes in the 1950s and 1960s due to rising demands for apartments, the eagerness to rebuild, and most of all the new development of infrastructure (especially increased automobile traffic). The wooden one- to two-story houses that were the dominant mode of building in the city were mostly demolished in the 1950s and 1960s to both enable more efficient building and to ease vehicle traffic. This resulted in the destruction of buildings that were, in later decades, seen as beautiful and worth saving. Some individual buildings remain controversial to this day when it comes to their demolition in the decades after the war. For example, the building of that stood on corner of the Market Square was torn down to make way for a large, multistory apartment building in 1959. The building was significant both for its location and history: having stood on one of the most valuable lots in the city center since 1878, the building had, for example, served as the first main building of the University of Turku. Other buildings whose demolition was seen as scandalous, either already at the time of action or proved to be so in later years, include (subject of the very first photograph ever taken in Finland) and the building of Old Hotel Börs which was built in jugendstil in 1909 by .

==Geography==

Situated at the mouth of the Aura River in the south-western corner of Finland, Turku covers an area of on both banks of the river. The eastern side, where Turku Cathedral is located, is the older and original centre. It is popularly known as &quot;täl pual jokke&quot; (&quot;this side of the river&quot;). The western side, where Turku Castle is located, is the newer part. It is called &quot;tois pual jokke&quot; (&quot;the other side of the river&quot;). In modern times, both banks of the Aura River are equally the centre of the city.

There are ten bridges over the Aura river in Turku. The oldest of the current bridges is , which was constructed in 1904. The newest bridge is (&#x27;library bridge&#x27;), a pedestrian-only bridge built in 2013. The &quot;Föri&quot;, a small ferry that transports pedestrians and bicycles across the river without payment, is a well known feature of the city.

===Administrative subdivisions===
The city is divided into 78 districts and nine wards. These do not operate as units of local government. However, some social programmes are district-based, especially in the eastern part of the city, where unemployment is high in some areas. The largest populated districts are Varissuo and Runosmäki. By area, Kakskerta and Paattinen are the largest districts.

As many of the small neighbouring municipalities from the north and south of the city were annexed during the mid-20th century, Turku is today shaped like an elongated pear. The city centre and most of the suburban areas lie in the middle, separated from the less densely populated northern rural areas by the Turku bypass, that forms part of European route E18. Islands such as Ruissalo, Hirvensalo and Kakskerta, forming the southern part of the city, are also sparsely populated and mostly contain summer residences, with the exception of some districts in Hirvensalo which are currently growing into upper-middle-class suburbs.

===Climate===

Situated by the Baltic Sea and sheltered by the islands of the Archipelago Sea, Turku has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;). Like much of southern Finland, the city experiences warm summers, with temperatures ranging up to 30 °C (86 °F), and relatively cold winters with frequent snowfall. The warmest month of the year is July, with an average temperature of , whereas the coldest month is February. The average year-round temperature is around . Winter usually starts in early December, and spring in late March.

=== Medieval buildings ===
According to archaeological evidence, Turku started to get built in the late 13th Century. However, only a few of its medieval buildings have survived to the present day. The primary factor was the Great Fire in 1827, which decimated three quarters of the city. Turku Cathedral, constructed in the 13th century, is one of the oldest still-functioning buildings. It is also Finland&#x27;s only medieval basilica church. Another surviving edifice from the medieval era is Turku Castle, which was established in the 1280s and underwent several expansions in the 15th century. Only the ruins remain of the bishop&#x27;s church in Koroistenniemi, Koroinen, but the white cross serves as a reminder of the bishop&#x27;s castle that existed centuries ago. Qwensel House, the oldest wooden house in Turku dating back to the 18th century, has been converted into a museum. No other medieval buildings have survived to the present day.

=== Museums ===
Most of Turku&#x27;s museums are situated beside the Aura River. The Turku Art Museum is housed in a granite castle, with exhibits of both classical and contemporary art. Turku Cathedral and its museum, located on the banks of the Aura River, provide information about the history and artifacts of the church. Adjacent to the cathedral, Ett Hem, a 19th-century bourgeois residence, and the Sibelius Museum, which displays a collection of musical instruments, can be found. Aboa Vetus &amp; Ars Nova presents a fusion of medieval ruins and modern art. On Vartiovuori, lies the Luostarinmäki Craftsman Museum, which represents a wooden housing locality dating back to the 18th century.

The Pharmacy Museum and Qwensel House hold the distinction of being Turku&#x27;s earliest wooden abode, offering a glimpse into the bourgeois life of the 18th century and a 19th-century drugstore. The contemporary art museum, WAM, is named after Turku&#x27;s sculptor, Wäinö Aaltonen. Additionally, the Biological Museum serves as a diorama museum covering Finnish wildlife and fauna. Forum Marinum is a maritime museum of exhibits and museum vessels, including the frigate &quot;Suomen Joutsen&quot; and the last commercial steam ship in Scandinavia &quot;MS Bore&quot;. Turku Castle is an attraction with over 700 years of history.

=== Theatres ===
There are half a dozen theatres situated in Turku, with the largest being the Turku City Theatre. Located in the city centre on the banks of the River Aura, it offers a varied programme of classical and contemporary drama. Other theatres in Turku include , Åbo Svenska Teater, TEHDAS and Turun Nuori Teatteri, in addition to smaller establishments such as the puppet theatre, Aura of Puppets, and the summer theatres, Samppalinna and Vartiovuori.

=== Music ===

Established in 1957, &quot;Turkuseura-Åbosamfundet ry&quot; is a bilingual, politically neutral historical society with 2,200 members. Its main focus is to cherish Turku&#x27;s culture and dialect, and to preserve local history and traditions. The society strives to promote and enhance Turku&#x27;s positive image.

Turku and Tampere are two cities in Finland that exhibit a cordial rivalry through humorous banter. Humorous topics include Tampere&#x27;s traditional dish, &quot;mustamakkara&quot;, Turku&#x27;s Aura River, and distinct regional accents. Both cities boast excellent culinary scenes, which attract food lovers. Since 1997, students from Tampere have annually visited Turku to participate in the custom of leaping on the market square. This lively event is thought to nudge the city towards the Baltic Sea and counteract post-glacial rebound.

==Sports==

Turku has two major football teams: FC Inter, playing in the top national league, &quot;Veikkausliiga&quot;, and TPS in &quot;Ykkönen&quot;, one level below. Both teams are based at Veritas Stadion in Kupittaa.

Finnish tennis player Jarkko Nieminen, from the nearby county of Masku, is among the most accomplished players in Finland.

==Government and politics==

Minna Arve has been the mayor of Turku since 2017. Since August 2021 her role as the mayor has been an elected office instead of a hired position.

==Transport==


For a city of its size, Turku has a moderate public transport network of bus routes, which is comparable to the bus network of similar-sized Tampere. The bus network is managed and supervised by the &quot;Turku City Region&#x27;s Public Transport Committee&quot; (FÖLI) (, ), and is operated mainly by private companies. Bus traffic to and in the neighbouring municipalities of Kaarina, Lieto, Naantali, Raisio and Rusko are also handled by FÖLI. The bus rates are the same when traveling within these municipalities.

Rail traffic to and from Turku is handled by the Finnish national carrier, VR. The number of services has fallen and only the railways towards Tampere and Helsinki are now in use. The railway stations currently used for passenger traffic are the Turku Central railway station in Pohjola, and two smaller stations in Kupittaa and the Port of Turku.

There is no local rail traffic at the moment, as the city&#x27;s popular tram services were discontinued in 1972, and the various local railway lines to neighbouring towns and municipalities were all abolished during the late 20th century. However, there are plans for a light rail system in the Turku region in the near future. According to the current estimate the tramway&#x27;s construction will start in 2026 and finish in 2031. The first route will be constructed between Turku Port−City Centre−Varissuo residential area. Route&#x27;s estimated length is 11 kilometers (6.8 miles) with 17 stops.

The first outdoor inclined elevator, the Funicular, is located in Turku. The elevator offers unimpeded access to Kakolanmäki hill where is no other public transport. The Funicular has two stations and travelling time between the stations is approximately one minute. It is possible to hop on and off at both stations and travelling is free of charge. The elevator&#x27;s rail is about 130 meters long and height difference between two stations about 30 meters.

The State of Finland has announced plans to support Espoo with 30% of full expenses on a new metro rail, the Regional Council of Southwest Finland is going to use this as a test case for a new light rail network in Turku.

The Turku Bus Station and the Turku Central railway station are currently located in different places. The City of Turku is planning to combine these two in a new greater station complex in the near future. This new travel center will consist of a hotel and several shopping estates. This center will connect all public transportation from commuter trains to long-distance buses.

Turku&#x27;s most significant highways for traffic are Highway 1 leading to Helsinki; Highway 10 leading to Hämeenlinna; Highway 9 leading to Tampere, Jyväskylä, Kuopio and Joensuu; Highway 8 leading to Pori, Vaasa and Oulu; and the Turku Ring Road, which protrudes circumferentially from Turku.

Turku Airport is located to the north of the city centre, partly in the neighbouring municipality of Rusko. The airport is served by six passenger airlines, including airBaltic and SAS Scandinavian, and one cargo airline.

There are also daily ferry services from the Port of Turku to Sweden and Åland, operated by Silja Line and Viking Line. These are something of a Finnish cultural tradition (see ruotsinlaiva), and people often travel long distances across Finland to Turku just to take a cruise across the Gulf of Bothnia.

The Archipelago Sea boat traffic is handled by, among others, SS Ukkopekka, an old steamship that cruises on the route Turku-Naantali-Turku.

Turku is the only city in Finland to have three long-distance railway stations: Turku Central, Port of Turku, and Kupittaa.

==Education==
Turku has a longer educational history than any other Finnish city – the first school in the city, the Cathedral School, was founded along with Turku Cathedral in the late 13th century. The first university in Finland, the Royal Academy of Turku (now University of Helsinki), was established in the city in 1640. In 1820, the first school in Finland conforming to the Bell-Lancaster method was founded in Turku with the aim of making primary education more inclusive to the lower classes.

Turku is home to about 40 000 higher education students. There are two universities and several &quot;polytechnics&quot; in the town.

The Finnish University of Turku is the fourth largest university in Finland (22,300 students in 2022), as measured by student enrollment, and one of the oldest as well, having been founded in 1920. Approximately 9% of all students are international students. Åbo Akademi, founded 1918 as the second university of Finland, is one of Finland&#x27;s two Swedish-language universities. Turku School of Economics merged with The University of Turku in 2010, and Åbo handelshögskola, its Swedish counterpart, with Åbo Akademi 1980. The central hospital of Turku, Turku University Hospital, is affiliated with the university and it is used as a teaching hospital.

Turku University of Applied Sciences (TUAS) is the second largest polytechnic in Finland (12,000 students in 2022) after Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. TUAS consists of six campus buildings in Turku and one separate campus in town of Salo. Bachelors of Business Administration, Social Services and Health Care Nursing study at Salo IoT Campus. TUAS offers Bachelor and Master studies in over 70 fields of education.

Also Novia University of Applied Sciences and Diaconia University of Applied Sciences have campuses in the town.

Turku is one of only two cities in Finland to have an established international school (the other city being Helsinki). Turku International School, located in the eastern district of Varissuo, has been operating since 2003. By an agreement signed between the city of Turku and the University of Turku, Turun normaalikoulu takes care of the teaching in the international school.

==Media==

The most widely read newspaper of Turku, and the area around it, is the daily regional morning newspaper &quot;Turun Sanomat&quot;, with a readership of over 70% of the population every day. &quot;Åbo Underrättelser&quot;, a Swedish-language newspaper published in Turku, is the oldest newspaper in Finland, having been published since 1824. The free-of-charge &quot;Turkulainen&quot; newspaper was also among the most popular newspapers, together with the local edition of &quot;Metro International&quot; and the national evening tabloid &quot;Ilta-Sanomat&quot;. Turkulainen was founded in 1958 but the newspaper has been on publishing break since 2020. There are also a number of local newspapers such as &quot;Kulmakunta&quot; (for the eastern suburbs of Turku, including Varissuo and Lauste), and &quot;Rannikkoseutu&quot; (for the area around the neighbouring cities of Raisio and Naantali).

The first Finnish newspaper &quot;Tidningar Utgifne Af et Sällskap i Åbo&quot;, in Swedish, was started in Turku in 1771, as well as the first Finnish-language newspaper &quot;Suomenkieliset Tieto-Sanomat&quot; which was started in 1775.

The newspaper &quot;Turun Sanomat&quot; also operated a regional television station, called &quot;Turku-TV,&quot; but station stopped operating in 2012. The Finnish national broadcaster &quot;Yleisradio&quot; screens local news, daily from Monday to Friday, for the Southwest Finland (including the regions of Southwest Finland and Satakunta) residents. All Finnish national TV channels are viewable and national radio channels audible in the Turku area. In addition, a number of local radio stations, e.g. &quot;Auran Aallot&quot;, &quot;Radio Sata&quot; and &quot;Radio Robin Hood&quot; are operational. Local public service radio stations are &quot;Yle Turun Radio&quot; broadcasting in Finnish (the regional version of Yle Radio Suomi) and &quot;Yle Vega Åboland&quot; broadcasting in Swedish (the regional version of Yle Vega).

<text>Calvert County is a county located in the U.S. state of Maryland. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 92,783. Its county seat is Prince Frederick. The county&#x27;s name is derived from the family name of the Barons of Baltimore, the proprietors of the English Colony of Maryland. Calvert County is included in the Washington–Arlington–Alexandria, DC–VA–MD–WV Metropolitan Statistical Area. It occupies the Calvert Peninsula, which is bordered on the east by Chesapeake Bay and on the west by the Patuxent River. The county has one of the highest median household incomes in the United States. It is one of the older counties in Maryland, after St. Mary&#x27;s, Kent County and Anne Arundel counties. The county is part of the Southern Maryland region of the state.

==History==
===Early history===
In 1608, Captain John Smith was the first European to sail past Calvert County while exploring the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay. On his map, he accurately represented the Patuxent River as well as several Native-American villages. The area was described as wooded and had been occupied by the Patuxent people who were overall peaceful to the early Europeans. Their diet was composed of fish from the river and corn cultivated in man-made clearings with a supplement of game from the forests. These clearings were very desirable and conflict occurred when the settlers attempted to seize these areas from the Native Americans. Leonard Calvert, the first Governor of the Maryland, organized troops of armed men in 1639 to protect the settlers.

The first written mention of European settlers on the northern shore of the Patuxent River is found in the records of the Maryland Assembly in 1642. A Henry Bishop &quot;stood up in the Assembly and exhibited himself as a Burgess of St. Leonard&#x27;s and pleaded that it be acknowledged as a Hundred&quot; near St. Leonard&#x27;s Creek. This shows that European settlement along the river and its tributaries had been taking place for several years already.

By 1646, the colonists had spread all along the Patuxent River and up the Bay side of Calvert County. Most of the transportation of goods and people took place on the water as the land was occupied by dense forests. Large creeks were navigated by sailing boats and plantations used their wharves to ship good. Ferry services were setup across the river and the bay with rates fixed by law.

===Creation of Charles County===
The county was originally named Charles County (much larger and unrelated to the present-day Charles County) in 1650 when Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore established it with Robert Brooke as its &quot;Commander&quot;. It was named after Charles I of England. At the time, the new county included the current area of Calvert County as well as the southern and western shores of the Patuxent River up to its headwaters. The county seat was called Calverton (sometimes called Battle Town) and was located on the north shore at the mouth of Battle Creek until 1725. In 1658, the county was renamed Calvert County. It also included all of Prince George&#x27;s County and parts of Montgomery County.

Puritans coming from Virginia had settled in Anne Arundel County and overflowed into Calvert County. All new settlers in Maryland were required to take an oath of allegiance to Lord Baltimore per the &quot;Conditions of Plantation&quot;. This was a major point of tension between the Puritan settlers and Lord Baltimore. The civil war was ongoing in Britain where the Puritans had gained control. Oliver Cromwell dismissed Parliament there and assumed the role of Lord Protector. In 1652, he sent a force of 750 men to subdue the plantations of the Chesapeake Bay under the new government. Virginia and Maryland surrendered to the Puritans and Robert Brooke cooperated with the Puritans.

On July 3, 1654, Lord Baltimore abolished Charles County and removed all authority from Brooke. He re-established the county as Calvert County with the same territory. However, the Puritan Assembly was in power and changed the name to Patuxent County on October 20, 1654, after the Patuxent River and to remove any connection with the Calvert family. The county kept this name under the Puritan regime until 1658 when the name of Calvert County was restored.

According to the local &quot;Trail of Souls Project&quot;, in 1860 there were 4,609 enslaved people, 1,841 free people of color for a total county population of 10,000 people.

Once made up primarily of farms and tobacco fields, the county&#x27;s agriculture transformed in the mid-1990s. The prices for tobacco were declining. The State of Maryland instituted the Tobacco Buyout program which offered farmers to transition to different crops and away from tobacco. 195 contracts were signed between Calvert county farmers and property owners and The Southern Maryland Agricultural Development Commission. The funds were used for infrastructure and equipment upgrades. Today the county produces fruits, vegetables, meat as well as other crops.

The county has become a fast-growing exurban neighbor of Washington. Many home prices have nearly quadrupled in the past decade, with many four-bedroom homes in the northern half of the county averaging over $1,000,000. The popular weekend resort towns of Solomons, Chesapeake Beach, and North Beach are notable.

The county has numerous properties on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Politics and government==
===County government===
Calvert County is governed by a Board composed of five elected County Commissioners, the traditional form of county government in the State of Maryland. They meet in Prince Frederick, the county seat.

===Emergency services===
Calvert County Fire, Rescue, EMS Stations include: 

* Co. 1 - North Beach Volunteer Fire Department
* Co. 2 - Prince Frederick Volunteer Fire Department
* Co. 3 - Solomons Volunteer Rescue Squad and Fire Department  
* Co. 4 - Prince Frederick Volunteer Rescue Squad
* Co.5 - Dunkirk Volunteer Fire Department and Rescue Squad
* Co. 6 - Huntingtown Volunteer Fire Department and Rescue Squad
* Co. 7 - St. Leonard Volunteer Fire Department and Rescue Squad
* Co. 10 - Calvert Advanced Life Support
* Co. 12 - Calvert Rescue Dive Team

Until 2018, Calvert County was the only county in Maryland that still had a 100% all-volunteer Fire, Rescue, and EMS service. However, on January 20, 2018, the Calvert County Board of County Commissioners approved a phased-in approach of hiring paramedics, starting in fiscal year 2019.

===National Politics===













In the early 19th Century, in the contests between the Hamiltonian Federalist and Jeffersonian Democratic-Republican parties of the First Party System, it backed the Federalists four out of seven times, only going for the Democratic-Republicans in their greatest landslides of 1804 and 1816 as well as the 1820 election in which President James Monroe ran effectively unopposed.

In the 1824 election which began the second party system, the people of Calvert County voted for John Quincy Adams over Andrew Jackson, who would go on to help found the Democratic Party before the 1828 election. Up until the Civil War, Calvert County voted only for the candidates of the Whig Party, the Democrat&#x27;s primary opposition. After that party&#x27;s dissolution in the early 1850s, it supported the Nativist Know-Nothing party in 1856 and the largely Whiggish Constitutional Union party in 1860.

In the Civil War election of 1864, Calvert swung sharply along with the rest of southern Maryland to give over 90% of the vote to Democratic challenger George McClellan, and again to the Democratic standard-bearer Horatio Seymour four years later. The brief Democratic era was likely due to strong Confederate sympathy in Southern Maryland.

In Presidential elections, Calvert County has historically and at present leaned strongly towards the Republican Party. It was won by that party in every election from 1884 to 1936 – with the sequence broken in 1940 due to local support for Franklin Delano Roosevelt&#x27;s efforts at helping Britain in World War II – and in modern times no Democratic presidential nominee has won Calvert County since Jimmy Carter did so in 1976.

Since then, Calvert County has remained mostly aligned with the Republican Party. It briefly turned in favor of the Democrats in the dealigned 1960s and 70s, after which it became a Republican stronghold in the 1980s. In modern elections, it leans Republican though Democrats have gained votes. President Joe Biden came only 5% from winning the county in 2020, the closest any Democrat has come since Jimmy Carter carried it in 1976.

It is part of the 5th Congressional District, along with much of Southern Maryland. The current representative is Democratic former House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (38%) is water. It is the smallest county in Maryland by land area and third-smallest by total area. The county also includes five islands: Solomons Island, Broomes Island, Buzzard Island, Hog Island, and Molly&#x27;s Leg.

The county&#x27;s coast along the Chesapeake Bay is a long, relatively smooth bight, a feature that is unique in the Chesapeake Bay.

===Geology===
A geological formation spanning across Maryland, Virginia, and Delaware is named after the county: the Calvert Formation. It is visible within the Calvert Cliffs State Park where it is exposed in cliffs. Located on the western shore of the county, Calvert Cliffs are famous for their fossil deposits and are a popular collecting location of marine vertebrates, shark teeth, birds as well as fresh water and marine turtles and tortoises. Some crocodile teeth have also been found which indicates that they may have been nesting in the sands at the time the formation was created.

The county landscape is composed of three platforms: the Talbot Terrace, the Wicomico Terrace, and the Sunderland Terrace (also known as the Ridge). These terraces correspond to three periods where the water level rose and later fell, leaving sand deposits. The oldest was created during the Miocene Age when the entire county peninsula found itself underwater. Marine deposits, clay, and mud containing sea shells and fossils were left behind leading to what we see at Calvert Cliffs today after the sea receded and the waves started erroring the deposit. These three terraces are visible in various parts of the county and are most obvious on the Bay side of the county where they rise to a height of 100 feet.

===Climate===
Calvert County lies in the humid subtropical climate zone (&quot;Cfa&quot;) in the Köppen climate classification, with hot, humid summers and mild to chilly winters with plentiful precipitation year-round. In the Trewartha climate classification the county is classified as oceanic (&quot;Do&quot;) except in the extreme south which is &quot;Cf&quot;. Its proximity to the Chesapeake Bay has a moderating effect on temperatures compared with locales further inland. Average monthly temperatures in Prince Frederick range from 35.9 °F in January to 77.9 °F in July.

==Education==
Calvert County is served by Calvert County Public Schools. The county&#x27;s education system consists of 13 elementary schools, six middle schools, four high schools, a vocational education center, and a variety of other facilities.

There is also one private K-12 school, The Calverton School. Additionally, there is a private Catholic Pre-K-8 school-Cardinal Hickey Academy- located in Owings.

==Transportation==

The main artery serving Calvert County is Maryland Route 4 (which begins in Washington, D.C. as Pennsylvania Avenue before crossing into Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland and Anne Arundel County, Maryland). Route 4 in Calvert County begins at the very northern tip of the county at Lyons Creek, approximately 3 miles north of Dunkirk. At Sunderland, Route 4 meets Maryland Route 2 (traveling south as a two-lane road from Annapolis) and the two roads merge as Maryland Route 2–4. Route 2-4 continues south through Prince Frederick, St. Leonard and Lusby. At Solomons, Routes 2 and 4 split again, with Route 2 heading towards downtown Solomons and Route 4 crossing the Patuxent River at the Governor Thomas Johnson Bridge into St. Mary&#x27;s County.

Route 2-4 is designated Solomons Island Road throughout much of the county, with the section south of Prince Frederick being recently renamed Louis Goldstein Highway in memory of Louis L. Goldstein, the former comptroller of Maryland and Calvert County resident.

In the 1970s and 1980s, Route 2-4 underwent an extensive expansion project, with the formerly two-lane road becoming a four-lane dual highway. Certain portions of the highway were re-aligned, with the former roadway becoming Maryland Route 765. The final portion of the dualized Route 2-4 between St. Leonard and Solomons was completed in 1988. In 2009, a portion of Route 2–4 in Prince Frederick was expanded to three lanes, along with sidewalks added.

Other major roadways in Calvert County include:
* Maryland Route 231, which travels west from Prince Frederick to the Patuxent River, ultimately crossing the river at the Benedict Bridge into Charles County.
* Maryland Route 260, which starts at an overpass interchange at the Calvert-Anne Arundel border and travels southeast to Chesapeake Beach. A portion of Route 260 is a four-lane dual highway.

==Communities==

===Towns===
* Chesapeake Beach
* North Beach

===Census-designated places===
The Census Bureau recognizes the following census-designated places in the county:

* Broomes Island
* Calvert Beach 
* Chesapeake Ranch Estates
* Drum Point
* Dunkirk
* Huntingtown
* Long Beach
* Lusby
* Owings
* Prince Frederick (county seat)
* St. Leonard
* Solomons
Dunkirk, Huntingtown, Lusby, Owings, Prince Frederick, St. Leonard and Solomons have all been designated by Calvert County government as being &quot;town centers&quot;. The &quot;town center&quot; designation means while these communities may not have incorporated central governments, they do have specified boundaries surrounding the central business and residential areas for zoning purposes. The reason behind the &quot;town center&quot; designation is to cluster new development within established areas with existing infrastructure, thus discouraging urban sprawl. The implementation of the &quot;town center&quot; concept in Calvert County over the past two decades has for the most part been successful in preserving rural and agricultural areas outside the designated &quot;town centers&quot;, and stands as a key example of the smart growth planning strategy.

<doc id="48678" wikidata="Q12937862" url="?curid=48678" title="Mahatma">
<text>Mahātmā (English pronunciation: , , ) is an honorific used in India.

The term is commonly used for Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, who is often referred to simply as &quot;Mahatma Gandhi&quot;. Albeit less frequently, this epithet has also been used with regard to such people as Basava (1131–1167), Swami Shraddhanand (1856–1926), Lalon Shah (1772–1890), Ayyankali (1863–1941), and Jyotirao Phule (1827–1890). 

The term &quot;mahātmā&quot; has also been historically used for a class of religious scholars in Jainism; for the selected religious leaders in Theosophy; and for local religious teachers in the Divine Light Mission church.

== In Theosophy==

The word, used in a technical sense, was popularized in theosophical literature in the late 19th century, when Helena Blavatsky, one of the founders of the Theosophical Society, claimed that her teachers were adepts (or Mahatmas) who reside in Asia. According to the Theosophical teachings, the Mahatmas are not disembodied beings, but highly evolved people involved in overseeing the spiritual growth of individuals and the development of civilizations. Blavatsky was the first person in modern times to claim contact with these Adepts, especially the &quot;Masters&quot; Koot Hoomi and Morya. Alvin Boyd Kuhn wrote about mahātmās:

The Masters whom Theosophy presents to us are simply high-ranking students in life&#x27;s school of experience. They are members of our own evolutionary group, not visitants from the celestial spheres. They are supermen only in that they have attained knowledge of the laws of life and mastery over its forces with which we are still struggling.
After Blavatsky&#x27;s death in 1891, numerous individuals have claimed to be in contact with her Adept Teachers. These individuals have stated that they are new &quot;messengers&quot; of the Masters and they have conveyed various esoteric teachings. Currently, various Theosophical movements refer to them as Ascended Masters, although their character and teachings are in several respects different from those described by Blavatsky.

===Criticism===
There has been a great deal of controversy concerning the existence of adepts. Blavatsky&#x27;s critics have doubted the existence of her Masters. See, for example, W. E. Coleman&#x27;s exposes.

K. Paul Johnson in his books speculates that the &quot;Masters&quot; that Blavatsky wrote about and produced letters from were actually idealizations of people who were her mentors. Aryel Sanat, author of &quot;The inner life of Krishnamurti: private passion and perennial wisdom&quot;, wrote that Johnson &quot;claims in all of his books that there were no Masters at all in early Theosophical Society history, and that Helena Blavatsky invented them (as others had claimed she had invented her travels)&quot;. Sanat wrote that Johnson &quot;deliberately ignores the main sources of evidence for their real physical existence&quot;. What Sanat thought these were is not made quite clear.

== Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi as &quot;Mahātmā&quot; ==
According to some authors, Rabindranath Tagore is said to have used this title for Gandhi on 6 March 1915. Some claim that he was called Mahatma by the residents of Gurukul Kangadi in April 1915, and he in turn called the founder Munshiram a Mahatma (who later became Swami Shraddhanand). However, a document honoring him with the title &quot;Mahatma&quot; on 21 January 1915, in Jetpur, Gujarat, by Nautamlal Bhagvanji Mehta is preserved at the National Gandhi Museum in New Delhi, India. A private letter from Gandhi&#x27;s friend Pranjivan Mehta to Gopal Krishna Gokhale in 1909 referred to Gandhi with the title and thus remains the earliest written record available to use the title. The use of the term Mahatma in Jainism to denote a class of lay priests, has been noted since the 17th century. A Mahatma is someone who practices Trikaranasuddhi.

==In the Divine Light Mission==
The Divine Light Mission (DLM) was a Sant Mat-based movement begun in India in the 1930s by Hans Maharaj and formally incorporated in 1960. The DLM had as many as 2,000 Mahatmas, all from India or Tibet, who taught the DLM&#x27;s secret meditation techniques called &quot;Knowledge&quot;. The Mahatmas, called &quot;realized souls&quot;, or &quot;apostles&quot;, also served as local leaders. After Hans Ji&#x27;s death in 1966 his youngest son, Prem Rawat (known then as Guru Maharaj Ji or Bagyogeshwar), succeeded him. The young guru appointed some new Mahatmas, including one from the United States. In one incident, a prominent Indian Mahatma nearly beat a man to death in Detroit for throwing a pie at the guru. In the early 1980s, Prem Rawat replaced the Divine Light Mission organization with the Elan Vital and replaced the Mahatmas with initiators. The initiators did not have the revered status of the Mahatmas, and they were drawn mostly from Western followers. In the 2000s, the initiators were replaced by a video in which Rawat teaches the techniques himself.

==In Jainism==
Among the Jains the term Mahatma is used for the class for scholars who are householders.

===Mahatma Hirananda of Mewar===
The colophon of the Mewar Ramayana, described as &quot;one of the most beautiful manuscripts in the world&quot;, states that the text, commissioned by Acharya Jasvant for the library of Maharana Jagat Singh I of Mewar, was written by one Mahatma Hirananda and finished on Friday 25 November 1650. Being a Jain scribe, Mahatma Hirananda incorporated traditional Jain scribal elements into the manuscript.

===Jain Mahatmas in &quot;Dabestan-e Mazaheb&quot;===
The &quot;Dabestan-e Mazaheb,&quot; written around 1655 CE, is a text that describes various religions and philosophies the author encountered. Its Section 11 is dedicated to Jainism. It states: &quot;Similar to the dervishes of both classes (Monk and Jatis) is a third sect, called Mahá-átma; group separated from the Oswal Jains, have the dress and appearance of Jatis; however, do not pluck their hair with tweezers, but cut it. They live the social life and spread the teaching of Mahavir and other Jain Tirthankars in the society. They accumulate money, cook their meals in their houses, drink cold water, and take to them a wife.&quot; The term Mahatma was thus used for priests/scholars who were not celibate.

<text>Kirkstall Abbey is a ruined Cistercian monastery in Kirkstall, north-west of Leeds city centre in West Yorkshire, England. It is set in a public park on the north bank of the River Aire. It was founded . It was disestablished during the Dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII.

The picturesque ruins have been drawn and painted by artists such as J. M. W. Turner, Thomas Girtin and John Sell Cotman.

Kirkstall Abbey was acquired by the Leeds Corporation as a gift from Colonel North and opened to the public in the late 19th century. The gatehouse became a museum, which is now part of the Leeds Museums &amp; Galleries group.

==Foundation==
Henry de Lacy (died 1177), Baron of Pontefract and of Clitheroe, promised to dedicate an abbey to the Virgin Mary should he survive a serious illness. He recovered and agreed to give the Abbot of Fountains Abbey land at Barnoldswick in the West Riding of Yorkshire (now in Lancashire) on which to found a daughter abbey. Abbot Alexander with twelve Cistercian monks from Fountains went to Barnoldswick in May 1147 and after demolishing the existing church attempted to build the abbey on Henry de Lacy&#x27;s land. They stayed for six years but found the place inhospitable. Abbot Alexander set about finding a more suitable place for the abbey and came across a site in the heavily wooded Aire Valley occupied by hermits.

Alexander sought help from de Lacy, who was sympathetic and helped acquire the land from William de Poitou. The monks moved from Barnoldswick to Kirkstall, displacing the hermits, some of whom joined the abbey, the rest being paid to move. The buildings were mostly completed between 1152, when the monks arrived in Kirkstall, and the end of Alexander&#x27;s abbacy in 1182. Millstone Grit for building came from Bramley Fall on the opposite side of the river.

== Buildings ==

The English Cistercian houses, of which there are remains at Fountains, Rievaulx, Kirkstall, Tintern and Netley, were mainly arranged after the same plan, with slight local variations. As an example, below is the groundplan of Kirkstall Abbey, one of the best preserved.
The church is of the Cistercian type, with a short chancel (3), and transepts (4) with three eastward chapels to each, divided by solid walls. The building is plain, the windows are unornamented, and the nave (1) has no triforium. The windows and doorways have round heads, whereas the vaulting arches are pointed and the moldings and capitals also show early Gothic features. During the 15th century, the great east window was replaced with a smaller one. The tower over the crossing was made higher in the 16th century, just before dissolution.

The cloister to the south (5) occupies the whole length of the nave. On the east side stands the two-aisled chapter house (7), between which and the south transept is a small sacristy, and on the other side two small apartments, one of which was probably the parlour (8). Beyond this is the calefactory or day-room of the monks. Above this whole range of building runs the monks&#x27; dormitory, opening by stairs into the south transept of the church.

On the south side of the cloister (5) there are the remains of the old refectory, running, as in Benedictine houses, from east to west, and the new refectory (12), which, with the increasing occupancy of the house, superseded it, reoriented, as is usual in Cistercian houses, from north to south. Adjacent to this apartment are the remains of the kitchen, pantry and buttery. The arches of the lavatory are to be seen near the refectory entrance. The western side of the cloister is occupied by vaulted cellars, supporting on the upper story the dormitory of the lay brothers (9).

Extending from the south-east angle of the main group of buildings are the walls and foundations of a secondary group of buildings (17, 18). These have been identified as the hospitium or the abbot&#x27;s house, but they occupy the position in which the infirmary is more usually found. The hall was a very spacious apartment, measuring 83 ft. in length by 48 ft. 9 inches in breadth, which was divided by two rows of columns. The fish-ponds lay between the monastery and the river to the south. The abbey mill was situated about 80 yards to the north-west. The millpool may be distinctly traced, together with the goit or mill stream.

== Dissolution and later history ==

On 22 November 1539 the abbey was surrendered to Henry VIII&#x27;s commissioners in the Dissolution of the monasteries. It was awarded to Thomas Cranmer in 1542, but reverted to the crown when Cranmer was executed in 1556. Sir Robert Savile purchased the estate in 1584, and it remained in his family&#x27;s hands for almost a hundred years. In 1671 it passed into the hands of the Brudenell family, the Earls of Cardigan. Much of the stone was removed for re-use in other buildings in the area, including the steps leading to the river bank by Leeds Bridge, in the town centre.

During the 18th century the picturesque ruins attracted artists of the Romantic movement and were painted by artists including J. M. W. Turner, John Sell Cotman and Thomas Girtin. In 1889 the abbey was sold to Colonel John North, who presented it to Leeds City Council. The Council undertook a major restoration project and the abbey was opened to the public in 1895.

The African American novelist William Wells Brown visited Kirkstall Abbey in 1851, writing about his experience. Using poetry and poetic language, he described the &#x27;pensive beauty&#x27; of the desolate ruins in their &#x27;pastoral luxuriance&#x27; showing his appreciation of British literature as well as an interest in nature and local history.

Little excavation took place before 1890, after which William St John Hope led an investigation of the abbey walls and some trees were removed. Extensive excavations were carried out during the 1950s by Leeds City Museums staff (now Leeds Museums &amp; Galleries) under the direction of W. V. Wade of Leeds University.

== The abbey today ==

The abbey is a Grade I listed building and scheduled ancient monument. After a £5.5 million renovation programme there is a new visitor centre with interactive exhibits which illustrates the history of the abbey and the lives of the monks. Entry to the Abbey itself is via the visitor centre.

The grounds surrounding the abbey form a public park which includes landscaped grounds, open grassland, tennis courts, children&#x27;s play area, rugby union and football pitches.

On the other side of the main road, the Grade II* listed former abbey gatehouse now forms the Abbey House Museum.

===Cultural events===

The &quot;Leeds Shakespeare Festival&quot;, performed by the British Shakespeare Company, took place annually in the cloisters from 1995 until 2009. The abbey grounds are a public park, and are used for occasional events such as the annual Kirkstall Festival and the Kirkstall Fantasia open-air concerts.

The Abbey was also used on 19 March 2011 for the live BBC Three event &quot;Frankenstein&#x27;s Wedding... Live in Leeds&quot;. A live music drama starring Andrew Gower and Lacey Turner as fiancees Victor Frankenstein and Elizabeth Lavenza.

On 10 and 11 September 2011 the Kaiser Chiefs played two concerts at Kirkstall Abbey to a maximum audience of 10,000 on each day.

The BBC Television series &quot;Gunpowder&quot; (2017) used Kirkstall Abbey as a filming location.

<doc id="48684" wikidata="Q19105" url="?curid=48684" title="Merostomata">
<text>Merostomata is a class of chelicerate arthropods that contains the extinct Eurypterida (sea scorpions) and the extant Xiphosura (horseshoe crabs). The term was originally used by James Dwight Dana to refer to Xiphosura only, but was emended by Henry Woodward to cover both groups.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Merostomata&quot; derives from the Greek roots (&#x27;, &quot;thigh&quot;) and (&#x27;, &quot;mouth&quot;), in reference to the animals&#x27; possession of appendages which are mouthparts at their proximal end, but swimming legs at their distal end.

==History==
The scientific consensus at the beginning of the 20th century was that these two marine groups were closely related, and only more distantly related to the terrestrial Arachnida. Some more recent analyses suggest the grouping Merostomata is not monophyletic, with Xiphosura being basal to a clade comprising Eurypterida and Arachnida. Other recent analyses support the monophyly of this group. The Xiphosura are estimated to have diverged from the Arachnida .

The shared features of the two groups traditionally grouped in the Merostomata are now thought to be retentions of primitive conditions (symplesiomorphies), thus the name Merostomata has been recommended to be abandoned.

However, a 2022 analysis recovered the monophyly of Merostomata, as opposed to a monophyletic Arachnida, with Xiphosura as the only modern representative in a derived position, indicating the convergence of several characteristics that supposedly united the arachnids.

<doc id="48685" wikidata="Q1073486" url="?curid=48685" title="Quantum suicide and immortality">
<text>Quantum suicide is a thought experiment in quantum mechanics and the philosophy of physics. Purportedly, it can falsify any interpretation of quantum mechanics other than the Everett many-worlds interpretation by means of a variation of the Schrödinger&#x27;s cat thought experiment, from the cat&#x27;s point of view. Quantum immortality refers to the subjective experience of surviving quantum suicide. This concept is sometimes conjectured to be applicable to real-world causes of death as well.

As a thought experiment, quantum suicide is an intellectual exercise in which an abstract setup is followed through to its logical consequences merely to prove a theoretical point. Virtually all physicists and philosophers of science who have described it, especially in popularized treatments, underscore that it relies on contrived, idealized circumstances that may be impossible or exceedingly difficult to realize in real life, and that its theoretical premises are controversial even among supporters of the many-worlds interpretation. Thus, as cosmologist Anthony Aguirre warns, &quot;[...] it would be foolish (and selfish) in the extreme to let this possibility guide one&#x27;s actions in any life-and-death question.&quot;

==History==
Hugh Everett did not mention quantum suicide or quantum immortality in writing; his work was intended as a solution to the paradoxes of quantum mechanics. Eugene Shikhovtsev&#x27;s biography of Everett states that &quot;Everett firmly believed that his many-worlds theory guaranteed him immortality: his consciousness, he argued, is bound at each branching to follow whatever path does not lead to death&quot;. Peter Byrne, author of a biography of Everett, reports that Everett also privately discussed quantum suicide (such as to play high-stakes Russian roulette and survive in the winning branch), but adds that &quot;[i]t is unlikely, however, that Everett subscribed to this [quantum immortality] view, as the only sure thing it guarantees is that the majority of your copies will die, hardly a rational goal.&quot;

Among scientists, the thought experiment was introduced by Euan Squires in 1986. Afterwards, it was published independently by Hans Moravec in 1987 and Bruno Marchal in 1988; it was also described by Huw Price in 1997, who credited it to Dieter Zeh, and independently presented formally by Max Tegmark in 1998. It was later discussed by philosophers Peter J. Lewis in 2000 and David Lewis in 2001.

==Thought experiment==
The quantum suicide thought experiment involves a similar apparatus to Schrödinger&#x27;s cat – a box which kills the occupant in a given time frame with probability one-half due to quantum uncertainty. The only difference is to have the experimenter recording observations be the one inside the box. The significance of this thought experiment is that someone whose life or death depends on a qubit could possibly distinguish between interpretations of quantum mechanics. By definition, fixed observers cannot.

At the start of the first iteration, under both interpretations, the probability of surviving the experiment is 50%, as given by the squared norm of the wave function. At the start of the second iteration, assuming a single-world interpretation of quantum mechanics (like the widely-held Copenhagen interpretation) is true, the wave function has already collapsed; thus, if the experimenter is already dead, there is a 0% chance of survival for any further iterations. However, if the many-worlds interpretation is true, a superposition of the live experimenter &quot;necessarily&quot; exists (as also does the one who dies). Now, barring the possibility of life after death, after every iteration only one of the two experimenter superpositions – the live one – is capable of having any sort of conscious experience. Putting aside the philosophical problems associated with individual identity and its persistence, under the many-worlds interpretation, the experimenter, or at least a version of them, continues to exist through all of their superpositions where the outcome of the experiment is that they live. In other words, a version of the experimenter survives all iterations of the experiment. Since the superpositions where a version of the experimenter lives occur by quantum necessity (under the many-worlds interpretation), it follows that their survival, after any realizable number of iterations, is physically necessary; hence, the notion of quantum &quot;immortality&quot;.

A version of the experimenter surviving stands in stark contrast to the implications of the Copenhagen interpretation, according to which, although the survival outcome is possible in every iteration, its probability tends towards zero as the number of iterations increases. According to the many-worlds interpretation, the above scenario has the opposite property: the probability of a version of the experimenter living is necessarily one for any number of iterations.

In the book &quot;Our Mathematical Universe&quot;, Max Tegmark lays out three criteria that, in abstract, a quantum suicide experiment must fulfill: 
* The random number generator must be quantum, not deterministic, so that the experimenter enters a state of superposition of being dead and alive.
* The experimenter must be rendered dead (or at least unconscious) on a time scale shorter than that on which they can become aware of the outcome of the quantum measurement.
* The experiment must be virtually certain to kill the experimenter, and not merely injure them.

==Analysis of real-world feasibility==
In response to questions about &quot;subjective immortality&quot; from normal causes of death, Tegmark suggested that the flaw in that reasoning is that dying is not a binary event as in the thought experiment; it is a progressive process, with a continuum of states of decreasing consciousness. He states that in most real causes of death, one experiences such a gradual loss of self-awareness. It is only within the confines of an abstract scenario that an observer finds they defy all odds. Referring to the above criteria, he elaborates as follows: &quot;[m]ost accidents and common causes of death clearly don&#x27;t satisfy all three criteria, suggesting you won&#x27;t feel immortal after all. In particular, regarding criterion 2, under normal circumstances dying isn&#x27;t a binary thing where you&#x27;re either alive or dead [...] What makes the quantum suicide work is that it forces an abrupt transition.&quot;

=== David Lewis&#x27; commentary and subsequent criticism ===

The philosopher David Lewis explored the possibility of quantum immortality in a 2001 lecture titled &quot;How Many Lives Has Schrödinger&#x27;s Cat?&quot;, his first academic foray into the field of the interpretation of quantum mechanics – and his last, due to his death less than four months afterwards. In the lecture, published posthumously in 2004, Lewis rejected the many-worlds interpretation, allowing that it offers initial theoretical attractions, but also arguing that it suffers from irremediable flaws, mainly regarding probabilities, and came to tentatively endorse the Ghirardi–Rimini–Weber theory instead. Lewis concluded the lecture by stating that the quantum suicide thought experiment, if applied to real-world causes of death, would entail what he deemed a &quot;terrifying corollary&quot;: as all causes of death are ultimately quantum-mechanical in nature, if the many-worlds interpretation were true, in Lewis&#x27; view an observer should subjectively &quot;expect with certainty to go on forever surviving whatever dangers [he or she] may encounter&quot;, as there will always be possibilities of survival, no matter how unlikely; faced with branching events of survival and death, an observer should not &quot;equally expect to experience life and death&quot;, as there is no such thing as experiencing death, and should thus divide his or her expectations only among branches where he or she survives. If survival is guaranteed, however, this is not the case for good health or integrity. This would lead to a Tithonus-like deterioration of one&#x27;s body that continues indefinitively, leaving the subject forever just short of death.

Interviewed for the 2004 book &quot;Schrödinger&#x27;s Rabbits&quot;, Tegmark rejected this scenario for the reason that &quot;the fading of consciousness is a continuous process. Although I cannot experience a world line in which I am altogether absent, I can enter one in which my speed of thought is diminishing, my memories and other faculties fading [...] [Tegmark] is confident that even if he cannot die all at once, he can gently fade away.&quot; In the same book, philosopher of science and many-worlds proponent David Wallace undermines the case for real-world quantum immortality on the basis that death can be understood as a continuum of decreasing states of consciousness not only in time, as argued by Tegmark, but also in space: &quot;our consciousness is not located at one unique point in the brain, but is presumably a kind of emergent or holistic property of a sufficiently large group of neurons [...] our consciousness might not be able to go out like a light, but it can dwindle exponentially until it is, for all practical purposes, gone.&quot;

Directly responding to Lewis&#x27; lecture, British philosopher and many-worlds proponent David Papineau, while finding Lewis&#x27; other objections to the many-worlds interpretation lacking, strongly denies that any modification to the usual probability rules is warranted in death situations. Assured subjective survival can follow from the quantum suicide idea only if an agent reasons in terms of &quot;what will be experienced next&quot; instead of the more obvious &quot;what will happen next, whether will be experienced or not&quot;. He writes: &quot;[I]t is by no means obvious why Everettians should modify their intensity rule in this way. For it seems perfectly open for them to apply the unmodified intensity rule in life-or-death situations, just as elsewhere. If they do this, then they can expect all futures in proportion to their intensities, whether or not those futures contain any of their live successors. For example, even when you know you are about to be the subject in a fifty-fifty Schrödinger’s experiment, you should expect a future branch where you perish, to just the same degree as you expect a future branch where you survive.&quot;

On a similar note, quoting Lewis&#x27; position that death should not be expected as an experience, philosopher of science Charles Sebens concedes that, in a quantum suicide experiment, &quot;[i]t is tempting to think you should expect survival with certainty.&quot; However, he remarks that expectation of survival could follow only if the quantum branching and death were absolutely simultaneous, otherwise normal chances of death apply: &quot;[i]f death is indeed immediate on all branches but one, the thought has some plausibility. But if there is any delay it should be rejected. In such a case, there is a short period of time when there are multiple copies of you, each (effectively) causally isolated from the others and able to assign a credence to being the one who will live. Only one will survive. Surely rationality does not compel you to be maximally optimistic in such a scenario.&quot; Sebens also explores the possibility that death might not be simultaneous to branching, but still faster than a human can mentally realize the outcome of the experiment. Again, an agent should expect to die with normal probabilities: &quot;[d]o the copies need to last long enough to have thoughts to cause trouble? I think not. If you survive, you can consider what credences you should have assigned during the short period after splitting when you coexisted with the other copies.&quot;

Writing in the journal &quot;Ratio&quot;, philosopher István Aranyosi, while noting that &quot;[the] tension between the idea of states being both actual and probable is taken as the chief weakness of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics,&quot; summarizes that most of the critical commentary of Lewis&#x27; immortality argument has revolved around its premises. But even if, for the sake of argument, one were willing to entirely accept Lewis&#x27; assumptions, Aranyosi strongly denies that the &quot;terrifying corollary&quot; would be the correct implication of said premises. Instead, the two scenarios that would most likely follow would be what Aranyosi describes as the &quot;comforting corollary&quot;, in which an observer should never expect to get very sick in the first place, or the &quot;momentary life&quot; picture, in which an observer should expect &quot;eternal life, spent almost entirely in an unconscious state&quot;, punctuated by extremely brief, amnesiac moments of consciousness. Thus, Aranyosi concludes that while &quot;[w]e can&#x27;t assess whether one or the other [of the two alternative scenarios] gets the lion&#x27;s share of the total intensity associated with branches compatible with self-awareness, [...] we can be sure that they together (i.e. their disjunction) do indeed get the lion&#x27;s share, which is much reassuring.&quot;

=== Analysis by other proponents of the many-worlds interpretation ===

Physicist David Deutsch, though a proponent of the many-worlds interpretation, states regarding quantum suicide that &quot;that way of applying probabilities does not follow directly from quantum theory, as the usual one does. It requires an additional assumption, namely that when making decisions one should ignore the histories in which the decision-maker is absent...[M]y guess is that the assumption is false.&quot;

Tegmark now believes experimenters should only expect a normal probability of survival, not immortality. The experimenter&#x27;s probability amplitude in the wavefunction decreases significantly, meaning they exist with a much lower measure than they had before. Per the anthropic principle, a person is less likely to find themselves in a world where they are less likely to exist, that is, a world with a lower measure has a lower probability of being observed by them. Therefore, the experimenter will have a lower probability of observing the world in which they survive than the earlier world in which they set up the experiment. This same problem of reduced measure was pointed out by Lev Vaidman in the &quot;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot;. In the 2001 paper, &quot;Probability and the many-worlds interpretation of quantum theory&quot;, Vaidman writes that an agent should not agree to undergo a quantum suicide experiment: &quot;The large &#x27;measures&#x27; of the worlds with dead successors is a good reason not to play.&quot; Vaidman argues that it is the instantaneity of death that may seem to imply subjective survival of the experimenter, but that normal probabilities nevertheless must apply even in this special case: &quot;[i]ndeed, the instantaneity makes it difficult to establish the probability postulate, but after it has been justified in the wide range of other situations it is natural to apply the postulate for all cases.&quot;

In his 2013 book &quot;The Emergent Multiverse&quot;, Wallace opines that the reasons for expecting subjective survival in the thought experiment &quot;do not really withstand close inspection&quot;, although he concedes that it would be &quot;probably fair to say [...] that precisely because death is philosophically complicated, my objections fall short of being a knock-down refutation&quot;. Besides re-stating that there appears to be no motive to reason in terms of expectations of experience instead of expectations of what will happen, he suggests that a decision-theoretic analysis shows that &quot;an agent who prefers certain life to certain death is rationally compelled to prefer life in high-weight branches and death in low-weight branches to the opposite.&quot;

Physicist Sean M. Carroll, another proponent of the many-worlds interpretation, states regarding quantum suicide that neither experiences nor rewards should be thought of as being shared between future versions of oneself, as they become distinct persons when the world splits. He further states that one cannot pick out some future versions of oneself as &quot;really you&quot; over others, and that quantum suicide still cuts off the existence of some of these future selves, which would be worth objecting to just as if there were a single world.

Cosmologist Anthony Aguirre, while personally skeptical of most accounts of the many-worlds interpretation, in his book &quot;Cosmological Koans&quot; writes that &quot;[p]erhaps reality actually is this bizarre, and we really do subjectively &#x27;survive&#x27; any form of death that is both instantaneous and binary.&quot; Aguirre notes, however, that most causes of death do not fulfill these two requirements: &quot;If there are degrees of survival, things are quite different.&quot; If loss of consciousness was binary like in the thought experiment, the quantum suicide effect would prevent an observer from subjectively falling asleep or undergoing anesthesia, conditions in which mental activities are greatly diminished but not altogether abolished. Consequently, upon most causes of death, even outwardly sudden, if the quantum suicide effect holds true an observer is more likely to progressively slip into an attenuated state of consciousness, rather than remain fully awake by some very improbable means. Aguirre further states that quantum suicide as a whole might be characterized as a sort of &quot;reductio ad absurdum&quot; against the current understanding of both the many-worlds interpretation and theory of mind. He finally hypothesizes that a different understanding of the relationship between the mind and time should remove the bizarre implications of necessary subjective survival.

Physicist and writer Philip Ball, a critic of the many-worlds interpretation, in his book &quot;Beyond Weird&quot;, describes the quantum suicide experiment as &quot;cognitively unstable&quot; and exemplificatory of the difficulties of the many-worlds theory with probabilities. While he acknowledges Lev Vaidman&#x27;s argument that an experimenter should subjectively expect outcomes in proportion of the &quot;measure of existence&quot; of the worlds in which they happen, Ball ultimately rejects this explanation. &quot;What this boils down to is the interpretation of probabilities in the MWI. If all outcomes occur with 100% probability, where does that leave the probabilistic character of quantum mechanics?&quot; Furthermore, Ball explains that such arguments highlight what he recognizes as another major problem of the many-worlds interpretation, connected but independent from the issue of probability: the incompatibility with the notion of selfhood. Ball ascribes most attempts of justifying probabilities in the many-worlds interpretation to &quot;saying that quantum probabilities are just what quantum mechanics look like &quot;when consciousness is restricted to only one world&quot;&quot; but that &quot;there is in fact no meaningful way to explain or justify such a restriction.&quot; Before performing a quantum measurement, an &quot;Alice before&quot; experimenter &quot;can&#x27;t use quantum mechanics to predict what will happen to her in a way that can be articulated – because there is no logical way to talk about &#x27;her&#x27; at any moment except the conscious present (which, in a frantically splitting universe, doesn&#x27;t exist). Because it is logically impossible to connect the perceptions of Alice Before to Alice After [the experiment], &quot;Alice&quot; has disappeared. [...] [The MWI] eliminates any coherent notion of what we can experience, or have experienced, or are experiencing right now.&quot; 

Philosopher of science Peter J. Lewis, a critic of the many-worlds interpretation, considers the whole thought experiment an example of the difficulty of accommodating probability within the many-worlds framework: &quot;Standard quantum mechanics yields probabilities for various future occurrences, and these probabilities can be fed into an appropriate decision theory. But if every physically possible consequence of the current state of affairs is certain to occur, on what basis should I decide what to do? For example, if I point a gun at my head and pull the trigger, it looks like Everett&#x27;s theory entails that I am certain to survive—and that I am certain to die. This is at least worrying, and perhaps rationally disabling.&quot; In his book &quot;Quantum Ontology&quot;, Lewis explains that for the subjective immortality argument to be drawn out of the many-worlds theory, one has to adopt an understanding of probability – the so-called &quot;branch-counting&quot; approach, in which an observer can meaningfully ask &quot;which post-measurement branch will I end up on?&quot; – that is ruled out by experimental, empirical evidence as it would yield probabilities that do not match with the well-confirmed Born rule. Lewis identifies instead in the Deutsch-Wallace decision-theoretic analysis the most promising (although still, to his judgement, incomplete) way of addressing probabilities in the many-worlds interpretation, in which it is not possible to count branches (and, similarly, the persons that &quot;end up&quot; on each branch). Lewis concludes that immortality argument is perhaps best viewed as a dramatic demonstration of the fundamental conflict between branch-counting (or person-counting) intuitions about probability and the decision theoretic approach. The many-worlds theory, to the extent that it is viable, does not entail that you should expect to live forever.&quot;

<text>Owain ap Gruffudd ( – 23 or 28 November 1170) was King of Gwynedd, North Wales, from 1137 until his death in 1170, succeeding his father Gruffudd ap Cynan. He was called Owain the Great () and the first to be styled &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and the &quot;Prince of the Welsh&quot;. He is considered to be the most successful of all the North Welsh princes prior to his grandson, Llywelyn ab Iorwerth (Llywelyn the Great). He became known as Owain Gwynedd (, &quot;Owain of Gwynedd&quot;) to distinguish him from the contemporary king of Powys Wenwynwyn, Owain ap Gruffydd ap Maredudd, who became known as Owain Cyfeiliog.

== Early life ==
Owain Gwynedd was a member of the House of Aberffraw, the senior branch of the dynasty of Rhodri Mawr (Rhodri the Great). His father, Gruffudd ap Cynan, was a strong and long-lived ruler who had made the principality of Gwynedd the most influential in Wales during the sixty-two years of his reign, using the island of Anglesey as his power base. His mother, Angharad ferch Owain, was the daughter of Owain ab Edwin of Tegeingl. Owain Gwynedd was the second son of Gruffydd and Angharad. His elder brother, Cadwallon, was killed in fighting in Powys in 1132 against Meirionnydd.

Owain is thought to have been born on Anglesey about the year 1100, he was Gruffudd ap Cynan&#x27;s second child, grandchild of Owain ab Edwin of Tegeingl via his mother Angharad ferch Owain. By about 1120 Gruffydd had grown too old to lead his forces in battle and Owain and his brothers Cadwallon and later Cadwaladr led the forces of Gwynedd against the Normans and against other Welsh princes with great success. His elder brother Cadwallon was killed in a battle against the forces of Powys in 1132, leaving Owain as his father&#x27;s heir. Owain and Cadwaladr, in alliance with Gruffydd ap Rhys of Deheubarth, won a major victory over the Normans at Crug Mawr near Cardigan in 1136 and annexed Ceredigion to their father&#x27;s realm.

== Accession to the throne and early campaigns ==
On behalf of his father, Gruffudd ap Cynan, Gwynedd directed military operations to the &quot;cantrefs of Meirionnydd, Rhos, Rhufoniog and Dyffryn Clwyd to Gwynedd proper&quot;, and it was against the Normans, with Gruffydd ap Rhys he secured a victory at the Battle of Crug Mawr and the temporary occupation of Kingdom of Ceredigion. On Gruffudd&#x27;s death in 1137, Owain inherited a portion of a well-established kingdom, but had to share it with Cadwaladr. In 1143 Cadwaladr was implicated in the murder of Anarawd ap Gruffydd of Deheubarth, and Owain responded by sending his son Hywel ab Owain Gwynedd to strip him of his lands in the north of Ceredigion. Though Owain was later reconciled with Cadwaladr, from 1143, Owain ruled alone over most of North Wales. In 1155 Cadwaladr was driven into exile.

Owain took advantage of The Anarchy, a civil war between Stephen, King of England, and the Empress Matilda, to push Gwynedd&#x27;s boundaries further east than ever before. In 1146 he captured Mold Castle and about 1150 captured Rhuddlan and encroached on the borders of Powys. The prince of Powys, Madog ap Maredudd, with assistance from Ranulf de Gernon, 4th Earl of Chester, gave battle at Coleshill, but Owain was victorious.

== War with King Henry II ==
All went well until the accession of King Henry II of England in 1154. Henry invaded Gwynedd in 1157 with the support of Madog ap Maredudd of Powys and Owain&#x27;s brother Cadwaladr. The invasion met with mixed fortunes. Henry&#x27;s forces ravaged eastern Gwynedd and destroyed many churches thus enraging the local population. The two armies met at Ewloe. Owain&#x27;s men ambushed the royal army in a narrow, wooded valley, routing it completely with King Henry himself narrowly avoiding capture. The fleet accompanying the invasion made a landing on Anglesey where it was defeated. Ultimately, at the end of the campaign, Owain was forced to come to terms with Henry, being obliged to surrender Rhuddlan and other conquests in the east.

Forty years after these events, the scholar Gerald of Wales, in a rare quote from these times, wrote what Owain Gwynedd said to his troops on the eve of battle:

&quot;My opinion, indeed, by no means agrees with yours, for we ought to rejoice at this conduct of our adversary; for, unless supported by divine assistance, we are far inferior to the English; and they, by their behaviour, have made God their enemy, who is able most powerfully to avenge both himself and us. We therefore most devoutly promise God that we will henceforth pay greater reverence than ever to churches and holy places&quot;.

Madog ap Maredudd died in 1160, enabling Owain to regain territory in the east. In 1163 he formed an alliance with Rhys ap Gruffydd of Deheubarth to challenge English rule. King Henry again invaded Gwynedd in 1165, but instead of taking the usual route along the northern coastal plain, the king&#x27;s army invaded from Oswestry and took a route over the Berwyn hills. The invasion was met by an alliance of all the Welsh Princes, with Owain as the undisputed leader. However, apart from a small melee at the Battle of Crogen, there was little fighting, for the Welsh weather came to Owain&#x27;s assistance as torrential rain forced Henry to retreat in disorder. The infuriated Henry mutilated a number of Welsh hostages, including two of Owain&#x27;s sons. 

Owain wrote two letters to Louis VII of France, describing himself as &quot;King of Wales&quot; and &quot;King of the Welsh&quot;. In the last of his letters to Louis VII of France, he offered to become a vassal of the French king and assist in attacking Henry if the French would make war on him. This time Owain styled himself (Prince of Wales), the first time he or anyone is known to have used such a title. 

Henry did not invade Gwynedd again, and Owain was able to regain his eastern conquests, recapturing Rhuddlan Castle in 1167 after a siege of three months.

== Disputes with the church and succession ==
The last years of Owain&#x27;s life were spent in disputes with the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Becket, over the appointment of a new Bishop of Bangor. When the see became vacant Owain had his nominee, Arthur of Bardsey, elected. The archbishop refused to accept this, so Owain had Arthur consecrated in Ireland. The dispute continued, and the see remained officially vacant until well after Owain&#x27;s death. He was also put under pressure by the Archbishop and the Pope to put aside his second wife, Cristin verch Goronwy, who was his first cousin, this relationship making the marriage invalid under church law. Despite being excommunicated for his defiance, Owain steadfastly refused to put Cristin aside. Owain died in 1170, and despite having been excommunicated was buried in Bangor Cathedral by the local clergy. The annalist writing Brut y Tywysogion recorded his death &quot;after innumerable victories and unconquered from his youth&quot;.

He is believed to have commissioned &quot;The Life of Gruffydd ap Cynan&quot;, an account of his father&#x27;s life. Following his death, civil war broke out between his sons. Owain was married twice, first to Gwladus ferch Llywarch ap Trahaearn, by whom he had two sons, Maelgwn ab Owain Gwynedd and Iorwerth Drwyndwn, the father of Llywelyn ab Iorwerth (Llywelyn the Great), then to Cristin, by whom he had three sons including Dafydd ab Owain Gwynedd and Rhodri ab Owain Gwynedd. He also had a number of illegitimate sons, who by Welsh law had an equal claim on the inheritance if acknowledged by their father.

== Heirs and successors ==
Gwynedd was married, firstly to Gwladus daughter of Llywarch ap Trahaearn and then his cousin Cristin verch Goronwy. Owain had originally designated Rhun ab Owain Gwynedd as his successor. Rhun was Owain&#x27;s favourite son, and his premature death in 1146 plunged his father into a deep melancholy, from which he was only roused by the news that his forces had captured Mold Castle. Owain then designated Hywel ab Owain Gwynedd as his successor, but after his death, Hywel was first driven to seek refuge in Ireland by Cristin&#x27;s sons, Dafydd and Rhodri, then Hywel was killed at the battle of Pentraeth when he returned with an Irish army. Dafydd and Rhodri split Gwynedd between them, but a generation passed before Gwynedd was restored to its former glory under Owain&#x27;s grandson Llywelyn ab Iorwerth (Llywelyn the Great).

According to legend, one of Owain&#x27;s sons was Prince Madoc of Wales (Madog), who is popularly supposed to have fled across the Atlantic and colonised America; this tradition is part of the Pre-Columbian transoceanic contact theories.

Altogether, the prolific Owain Gwynedd is said to have had the following children from two wives and at least four mistresses:
* Rhun ab Owain Gwynedd (illegitimate in Catholic custom, but legitimate successor in Welsh law);
* Hywel ab Owain Gwynedd (illegitimate in Catholic custom, but legitimate successor in Welsh law);
* Iorwerth mab Owain Gwynedd (the &quot;flat nosed&quot; from first wife Gwladys ferch Llywarch);
* Maelgwn ab Owain Gwynedd (from first wife Gwladys ferch Llywarch) Lord of Môn (1169–1173);
* Gwenllian ferch Owain Gwynedd;
* Dafydd ab Owain Gwynedd (from second wife Cristin ferch Goronwy);
* Rhodri ab Owain Gwynedd, Lord of Môn (1175–1193) (from second wife Cristin ferch Goronwy);
* Angharad ferch Owain Gwynedd;
* Margaret ferch Owain Gwynedd;
* Iefan ab Owain Gwynedd;
* Cynan ab Owain Gwynedd, Lord of Meirionnydd (illegitimate);
* Rhirid ab Owain Gwynedd (illegitimate);
* Madoc ab Owain Gwynedd (illegitimate) (speculative/legendary);
* Cynwrig ab Owain Gwynedd (illegitimate);
* Gwenllian II ferch Owain Gwynedd (also shared the same name with a sister);
* Einion ab Owain Gwynedd (illegitimate);
* Iago ab Owain Gwynedd (illegitimate);
* Ffilip ab Owain Gwynedd (illegitimate);
* Cadell ab Owain Gwynedd (illegitimate);
* Rotpert ab Owain Gwynedd (illegitimate);
* Idwal ab Owain Gwynedd (illegitimate);
* Other daughters.

== Fiction ==
Owain is a recurring character in the Brother Cadfael series of novels by Ellis Peters, often referred to, and appearing in the novels &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Ransom&quot; and &quot;The Summer of the Danes&quot;. He acts shrewdly to keep Wales&#x27; borders secure, and sometimes to expand them, during the civil war between King Stephen and Matilda, and sometimes acts as an ally to Cadfael and his friend, Sheriff Hugh Beringar. Cadwaladr also appears in both these novels as a source of grief for his brother. Owain appears as a minor character in novels of Sharon Kay Penman concerning Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine (&quot;When Christ and His Saints Slept&quot; and &quot;Time and Chance&quot;). Her focus with respect to Owain is on the fluctuating and factious relationship between England and Wales.

<doc id="48690" wikidata="Q335073" url="?curid=48690" title="Caratacus">
<text>Caratacus was a 1st-century AD British chieftain of the Catuvellauni tribe, who resisted the Roman conquest of Britain.

Before the Roman invasion, Caratacus is associated with the expansion of his tribe&#x27;s territory. His apparent success led to Roman invasion, nominally in support of his defeated enemies. He resisted the Romans for almost a decade, using guerrilla warfare, but when he offered a set-piece battle he was defeated by Roman forces. After defeat he fled to the territory of Queen Cartimandua, who captured him and handed him over to the Romans. He was sentenced to death but made a speech before his execution that persuaded the Emperor Claudius to spare him. Caratacus&#x27; speech to Claudius has been a popular subject in visual art.

==Name==
Caratacus&#x27; name appears as both &quot;Caratacus&quot; and &quot;Caractacus&quot; in manuscripts of Tacitus, and as &quot;Καράτακος&quot; and &quot;Καρτάκης&quot; in manuscripts of Dio. Older reference works tend to favour the spelling &quot;Caractacus&quot;, coins minted during his rule show the beginning of his name CARA&#x27; on the obverse, but some modern scholars agree, based on historical linguistics and source criticism, that the original Common Brittonic form was &quot;*Karatākos&quot;, pronounced , cognate with Welsh &quot;Caradog&quot;, Breton &quot;Karadeg&quot;, and Irish &quot;Carthach&quot;, meaning &quot;loving, beloved, dear; friend&quot;.

==History==

===Claudian invasion===
Caratacus is named by Dio Cassius as a son of the Catuvellaunian king Cunobelinus. Based on coin distribution Caratacus appears to have been the protégé of his uncle Epaticcus, who expanded Catuvellaunian power westwards most likely from his palace in Verulam, the heartland of the Catuvellauni, into the territory of the Atrebates. After Epaticcus died in about AD 35, the Atrebates, under Verica, regained some of their territory, but it appears Caratacus completely conquered the Atrebates, since Dio tells us Verica was ousted, fled to Rome and appealed to the emperor Claudius for help. This was the excuse used by Claudius to launch his invasion of Britain in the summer of 43. 

The invasion targeted Caratacus&#x27; stronghold of Camulodunon (modern Colchester), previously the seat of his father Cunobelinus. Cunobelinus had died some time before the invasion. Caratacus and his brother Togodumnus led the initial defence of the country against Aulus Plautius&#x27;s four legions, thought to have been around 40,000 men, primarily using guerrilla tactics. They lost much of the south-east after being defeated in two crucial battles, the Battle of the River Medway and River Thames. 

Dio reports that Togodumnus was killed (although both Miles Russell and John Hind argue that Dio was mistaken in reporting Togodumnus&#x27; death, that he was defeated but survived and was later appointed by the Romans as a friendly king over a number of territories, becoming the loyal king referred to by Tacitus as Cogidubnus or Togidubnus) and the Romans conquered the Catuvellaunian territories. Their stronghold of Camulodunon was converted into the first Roman colonia in Britain, Colonia Victricensis.

===Resistance to Rome===
We next hear of Caratacus in Tacitus&#x27;s &quot;Annals&quot;, leading the Silures and Ordovices of Wales against Plautius&#x27; successor as governor, Publius Ostorius Scapula. Finally, in 50, Scapula managed to defeat Caratacus in a set-piece battle somewhere in Ordovician territory, capturing Caratacus&#x27; wife and daughter and receiving the surrender of his brothers. Caratacus himself escaped and fled north to the lands of the Brigantes (modern Yorkshire), where the Brigantian queen, Cartimandua, handed him over to the Romans in chains. This was one of the factors that led to two Brigantian revolts against Cartimandua and her Roman allies, once later in the 50s and once in 69, led by Venutius, who had once been Cartimandua&#x27;s husband. With the capture of Caratacus, much of southern Britain from the Humber to the Severn was pacified and garrisoned throughout the 50s.

Legends place Caratacus&#x27; last stand at either Caer Caradoc near Church Stretton or British Camp in the Malvern Hills, but the description of Tacitus makes either unlikely:

Although the Severn is visible from British Camp, it is nowhere near it, so this battle must have taken place elsewhere. A number of locations have been suggested, including a site near Brampton Bryan. Bari Jones, in &quot;Archaeology Today&quot; in 1998, identified Blodwel Rocks at Llanymynech in Powys as representing a close fit with Tacitus&#x27; account.

===Captive in Rome===
After his capture, Caratacus was sent to Rome as a war prize, presumably to be killed after a triumphal parade. Although a captive, he was allowed to address the Roman Senate. Tacitus records a version of his speech in which he says that his stubborn resistance made Rome&#x27;s glory in defeating him all the greater:

He made such an impression that he was pardoned and allowed to live in peace in Rome. After his liberation, according to Dio Cassius, Caratacus was so impressed by the city of Rome that he said &quot;And can you, then, who have got such possessions and so many of them, still covet our poor huts?&quot;

==Legend==
===Medieval Welsh traditions===
Caratacus&#x27; memory may have been preserved in medieval Welsh tradition. A genealogy in the Welsh Harley MS 3859 () includes the generations &quot;Caratauc map Cinbelin map Teuhant&quot;, corresponding, via established processes of language change, to &quot;Caratacus, son of Cunobelinus, son of Tasciovanus&quot;, preserving the names of the three historical figures in correct relationship.

Caratacus does not appear in Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;History of the Kings of Britain&quot; (1136), although he appears to correspond to Arviragus, the younger son of Kymbelinus, who continues to resist the Roman invasion after the death of his older brother Guiderius. In Welsh versions his name is Gweirydd, son of Cynfelyn, and his brother is called Gwydyr; the name Arviragus is taken from a poem by Juvenal.

Caradog, son of Bran, who appears in medieval Welsh literature, has also been identified with Caratacus, although nothing in the medieval legend corresponds except his name. He appears in the &quot;Mabinogion&quot; as a son of Bran the Blessed, who is left in charge of Britain while his father makes war in Ireland, but is overthrown by Caswallawn (the historical Cassivellaunus, who lived a century earlier than Caratacus). The Welsh Triads agree that he was Bran&#x27;s son, and name two sons, Cawrdaf and Eudaf.

Two hills in Shropshire bear the name Caer Caradoc (Welsh – Caer Caradog), meaning fort of Caradoc, and have popular associations with him. One is an Iron Age hill fort and Scheduled Monument near the town of Clun. It overlooks the village of Chapel Lawn. The other Caer Caradoc is a prominent hill and Iron Age hill fort near Church Stretton, 16 miles (26 km) to the north-east.

===Modern traditions===
Caradog began to be identified with Caratacus only after the rediscovery of the works of Tacitus and new material appeared based on this identification. An 18th-century tradition, popularised by the Welsh antiquarian and forger Iolo Morganwg, credits Caradog, on his return from imprisonment in Rome, with the introduction of Christianity to Britain. Iolo also makes the legendary king Coel Hen a son of Caradog&#x27;s son Saint Cyllin. Richard Williams Morgan claimed that a reference to Cyllin as a son of Caratacus was found in the family records of Iestyn ab Gwrgant and used this as evidence of the early entry of Christianity to Britain: &quot;Cyllin ab Caradog, a wise and just king. In his days many of the Cymry embraced the faith in Christ through the teaching of the saints of Cor-Eurgain, and many godly men from the countries of Greece and Rome were in Cambria. He first of the Cymry gave infants names; for before, names were not given except to adults, and then from something characteristic in their bodies, minds, or manners.&quot;

Another tradition, which has remained popular among British Israelites and others, makes Caratacus already a Christian before he came to Rome, Christianity having been brought to Britain by either Joseph of Arimathea or St Paul, and identifies a number of early Christians as his relatives.

One is Pomponia Graecina, wife of Aulus Plautius, the conqueror of Britain, who as Tacitus relates, was accused of following a &quot;foreign superstition&quot;, which the tradition considers to be Christianity. Tacitus describes her as the &quot;wife of the Plautius who returned from Britain with an ovation&quot;, which led John Lingard (1771–1851) to conclude, in his &quot;History and Antiquities of the Anglo-Saxon Church&quot;, that she was British; however, this conclusion is a misinterpretation of what Tacitus wrote. An ovation was a military parade in honour of a victorious general, so the person who &quot;returned from Britain with an ovation&quot; is clearly Plautius, not Pomponia. This has not prevented the error being repeated and disseminated widely.

Another is Claudia Rufina, a historical British woman known to the poet Martial. Martial describes Claudia&#x27;s marriage to a man named Pudens, almost certainly Aulus Pudens, an Umbrian centurion and friend of the poet who appears regularly in his &quot;Epigrams&quot;. It has been argued since the 17th century that this pair may be the same as the Claudia and Pudens mentioned as members of the Roman Christian community in &quot;2 Timothy&quot; in the New Testament. Some go further, claiming that Claudia was Caratacus&#x27; daughter, and that the historical Pope Linus, who is described as the &quot;brother of Claudia&quot; in an early church document, was Caratacus&#x27; son. Pudens is identified with St. Pudens, and it is claimed that the basilica of Santa Pudenziana in Rome, and with which St. Pudens is associated, was once called the &quot;Palatium Britannicum&quot; and was the home of Caratacus and his family.

This theory was popularised in a 1961 book called &quot;The Drama of the Lost Disciples&quot; by George Jowett, but Jowett did not originate it. He cites renaissance historians such as Archbishop James Ussher, Caesar Baronius and John Hardyng, as well as classical writers like Caesar, Tacitus and Juvenal, although his classical citations at least are wildly inaccurate, many of his assertions are unsourced, and many of his identifications entirely speculative. He also regularly cites &quot;St. Paul in Britain&quot;, an 1860 book by R. W. Morgan, and advocates other tenets of British Israelism, in particular that the British are descended from the lost tribes of Israel.

=== In the arts ===
* Caratach is anachronistically depicted as Boudica&#x27;s general in John Fletcher&#x27;s play &quot;Bonduca&quot; (1613). The historical Caratach was exiled from Britain nearly a decade prior to Boudica&#x27;s war.
* Caratacus is the subject of William Mason&#x27;s 1759 poem of the same name and the 1776 play based on it.
* Caratacus is the title character of the Italian opera &quot;Carattaco&quot; by Johann Christian Bach, first performed in London in 1767
* A detailed knowledge of Caractacus&#x27; uniform is claimed by Major-General Stanley in &quot;The Major-General&#x27;s Song&quot; from Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s 1879 comic opera &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;.
* &quot;Caractacus&quot; is the title of a cantata by Edward Elgar in 1897–98 devoted to the defeat and capture of the king by the Romans. It was first performed at the Leeds choral festival in 1898.
* Caractacus is the subject of a Victorian poem called &quot;Caractacus the Briton&quot; by William Stewart Ross, published 1881 in a collection titled &quot;Lays of Romance and Chivalry&quot;, and distinguished by the refrain, &quot;Caractacus the Briton, the bravest of the brave!&quot;
* The defeat of Caradoc (Caratacus) by the Romans is the subject of Henry Treece&#x27;s 1952 adult novel, &quot;The Dark Island&quot;, the second book in his &quot;Celtic Tetralogy&quot;. As well, a poem titled &quot;Caratacus&quot; appears in Treece&#x27;s &quot;Exiles&quot;, a collection of poetry published in the same year.
* Caractacus briefly appears as a minor character in the Robert Graves novel, &quot;Claudius the God&quot;. In the television adaptation of Graves&#x27;s novels, he is portrayed in a brief appearance by Peter Bowles.
* Caratacus&#x27; capture and life as a captive in Rome is told from the point of view of his fictional daughter, Eigon, in Barbara Erskine&#x27;s time-slip novel, &quot;The Warrior&#x27;s Princess&quot;, pub. 2008.
* Caratacus is a major character in Douglas Jackson&#x27;s 2008 novel &quot;Claudius&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Caligula&quot; (2008).
* Caradoc is a major character in author Pauline Gedge&#x27;s 1978 novel, &quot;The Eagle and The Raven&quot;.
* Caratacus appears in several volumes of Simon Scarrow&#x27;s &quot;Eagle&quot; series, including &quot;Under the Eagle&quot;, &quot;The Eagle&#x27;s Conquest&quot;, &quot;When the Eagle Hunts&quot;, &quot;The Eagle and the Wolves&quot;, &quot;The Eagle&#x27;s Prey&quot;, &quot;Blood Crows&quot; and &quot;Brothers In Blood&quot;.
* Caradoc is a main character in Manda Scott&#x27;s series &quot;Boudica&quot; (&quot;Dreaming the Eagle&quot;, &quot;Dreaming the Bull&quot;, &quot;Dreaming the Hound&quot;, &quot;Dreaming the Serpent-Spear&quot;).
* Caratach appears as a stage character in Harry Turtledove&#x27;s alternate history novel &quot;Ruled Britannia&quot;. In this novel, a fictional version of William Shakespeare writes a play called &quot;Boudicca&quot;, which is almost identical to John Fletcher&#x27;s &quot;Bonduca&quot;. In the book&#x27;s afterword Turtledove acknowledges Fletcher&#x27;s influence, but in the novel itself he mistakenly suggests that Caratach was depicted as Boudicca&#x27;s man in Tacitus&#x27;s &quot;Annals&quot;.
* &quot;The Court of King Caractacus&quot; is a nonsense song by Rolf Harris. The single reached No 9 in the Australian Singles Chart in 1964.
* Caratacus is referenced in the Paradox Interactive video game &quot;Crusader Kings II&quot; in the form of bloodline inherited by some characters in the game, the &quot;Bloodline of Caradog&quot;.
* &quot;Caradog before Caesar in Rome&quot; is a painting by Ellis Owen Ellis (Ellis Bryn-Coch), a Welsh portrait painter who won a number of prizes in London art galleries after moving there in 1834.

<text>Alfred Ernest Jones (1 January 1879 – 11 February 1958) was a Welsh neurologist and psychoanalyst. A lifelong friend and colleague of Sigmund Freud from their first meeting in 1908, he became his official biographer. Jones was the first English-speaking practitioner of psychoanalysis and became its leading exponent in the English-speaking world. As President of both the International Psychoanalytical Association and the British Psycho-Analytical Society in the 1920s and 1930s, Jones exercised a formative influence in the establishment of their organisations, institutions and publications.

== Early life and career ==
Ernest Jones was born in Gowerton (formerly Ffosfelin), Wales, an industrial village on the outskirts of Swansea, the first child of Thomas and Ann Jones. His father was a self-taught colliery engineer who went on to establish himself as a successful businessman, becoming accountant and company secretary at the Elba Steelworks in Gowerton. His mother, Mary Ann (née Lewis), was from a Welsh-speaking Carmarthenshire family which had relocated to Swansea. Jones was educated at Swansea Grammar School, Llandovery College, and Cardiff University in Wales. Jones studied at University College London and meanwhile he obtained the Conjoint diplomas LRCP and MRCS in 1900. A year later, in 1901, he obtained an M.B. degree with honours in medicine and obstetrics. Within five years he received an MD degree and a Membership of the Royal College of Physicians (MRCP) in 1903. He was particularly pleased to receive the University&#x27;s gold medal in obstetrics from his distinguished fellow-Welshman, Sir John Williams.

After obtaining his medical degrees, Jones specialised in neurology and took a number of posts in London hospitals. It was through his association with the surgeon Wilfred Trotter that Jones first heard of Freud&#x27;s work. Having worked together as surgeons at University College Hospital, he and Trotter became close friends, with Trotter taking the role of mentor and confidant to his younger colleague. They had in common a wide-ranging interest in philosophy and literature, as well as a growing interest in Continental psychiatric literature and the new forms of clinical therapy it surveyed. By 1905 they were sharing accommodation above Harley Street consulting rooms with Jones&#x27;s sister, Elizabeth, installed as housekeeper. Trotter and Elizabeth Jones later married. Appalled by the treatment of the mentally ill in institutions, Jones began experimenting with hypnotic techniques in his clinical work.

Jones first encountered Freud&#x27;s writings directly in 1905, in a German psychiatric journal in which Freud published the famous Dora case-history. It was thus he formed &quot;the deep impression of there being a man in Vienna who actually listened with attention to every word his patients said to him...a revolutionary difference from the attitude of previous physicians...&quot;

Jones&#x27;s early attempts to combine his interest in Freud&#x27;s ideas with his clinical work with children resulted in adverse effects on his career. In 1906 he was arrested and charged with two counts of indecent assault on two adolescent girls whom he had interviewed in his capacity as an inspector of schools for &quot;mentally defective&quot; children. At the court hearing Jones maintained his innocence, claiming the girls were fantasising about any inappropriate actions by him. The magistrate concluded that no jury would believe the testimony of such children and Jones was acquitted. In 1908, employed as a pathologist at a London hospital, Jones accepted a colleague&#x27;s challenge to demonstrate the repressed sexual memory underlying the hysterical paralysis of a young girl&#x27;s arm. Jones duly obliged but, before conducting the interview, he omitted to inform the girl&#x27;s consultant or arrange for a chaperone. Subsequently, he faced complaints from the girl&#x27;s parents over the nature of the interview and he was forced to resign his hospital post.

== Personal life ==

Jones&#x27;s first serious relationship was with Loe Kann, a wealthy Dutch émigré referred to him in 1906 after she had become addicted to morphine during treatment for a serious kidney condition. Their relationship lasted until 1913. It ended with Kann in analysis with Freud and Jones, at Freud&#x27;s behest, undergoing analysis with Sándor Ferenczi.

A tentative romance with Freud&#x27;s daughter, Anna, did not survive the disapproval of her father. Before her visit to Britain in the autumn of 1914, which Jones chaperoned, Freud advised him: 

In 1917, Jones married the Welsh musician Morfydd Llwyn Owen. They were holidaying in South Wales the following year when Morfydd became ill with acute appendicitis. Jones hoped to get his former colleague and brother-in-law, the leading surgeon Wilfred Trotter, to operate but when this proved impossible emergency surgery was carried out at his father&#x27;s Swansea home by a local surgeon, with chloroform administered as the anaesthetic. As Jones recounts: &quot;after a few days [she] became delirious with a high temperature. We thought there was blood poisoning till I got Trotter from London. He at once recognized delayed chloroform poisoning ... We fought hard, and there were moments when we seemed to have succeeded, but it was too late.&quot; Jones arranged for his wife to be buried in Oystermouth Cemetery on the outskirts of Swansea with her gravestone bearing an inscription from Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;: &quot;Das Unbeschreibliche, hier ist&#x27;s getan&quot;.

Following some inspired matchmaking by his Viennese colleagues, in 1919 Jones met and married Katherine Jokl, a Jewish economics graduate from Moravia. She had been at school in Vienna with Freud&#x27;s daughters. They had four children in what proved to be a long and happy marriage, though both struggled to overcome the loss of their eldest child, Gwenith, at the age of 7, during the interwar influenza epidemic. Their son Mervyn Jones became a writer.

== Psychoanalytical career ==
Whilst attending a congress of neurologists in Amsterdam in 1907, Jones met Carl Jung, from whom he received a first-hand account of the work of Freud and his circle in Vienna. Confirmed in his judgement of the importance of Freud&#x27;s work, Jones joined Jung in Zürich to plan the inaugural Psychoanalytical Congress. This was held in 1908 in Salzburg, where Jones met Freud for the first time. Jones travelled to Vienna for further discussions with Freud and introductions to the members of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society. Thus began a personal and professional relationship which, to the acknowledged benefit of both, would survive the many dissensions and rivalries which marked the first decades of the psychoanalytic movement, and would last until Freud&#x27;s death in 1939.

With his career prospects in Britain in serious difficulty, Jones sought refuge in Canada in 1908. He took up teaching duties in the Department of Psychiatry of the University of Toronto (from 1911, as Associate Professor of Psychiatry). In addition to building a private psychoanalytic practice, he worked as pathologist to the Toronto Asylum and Director of its psychiatric outpatient clinic. Following further meetings with Freud in 1909 at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts, where Freud gave a series of lectures on psychoanalysis, and in the Netherlands the following year, Jones set about forging strong working relationships with the nascent American psychoanalytic movement. He gave some 20 papers or addresses to American professional societies at venues ranging from Boston, to Washington and Chicago. In 1910 he co-founded the American Psychopathological Association and the following year the American Psychoanalytic Association, serving as its first Secretary until 1913.

Jones undertook an intensive programme of writing and research, which produced the first of what were to be many significant contributions to psychoanalytic literature, notably monographs on &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;On the Nightmare&quot;. A number of these were published in German in the main psychoanalytic periodicals published in Vienna; these secured his status in Freud&#x27;s inner circle during the period of the latter&#x27;s increasing estrangement from Jung. In this context in 1912 Jones initiated, with Freud&#x27;s agreement, the formation of a Committee of loyalists charged with safeguarding the theoretical and institutional legacy of the psychoanalytic movement. This development also served the more immediate purpose of isolating Jung and, with Jones in strategic control, eventually manoeuvring him out of the Presidency of the International Psychoanalytical Association, a post he had held since its inception. When Jung&#x27;s resignation came in 1914, it was only the outbreak of the Great War that prevented Jones from taking his place.

Returning to London in 1913, Jones set up in practice as a psychoanalyst, founded the London Psychoanalytic Society, and continued to write and lecture on psychoanalytic theory. A collection of his papers was published as &quot;Papers on Psychoanalysis&quot;, the first account of psychoanalytic theory and practice by a practising analyst in the English language.

By 1919, the year he founded the British Psychoanalytical Society, Jones could report proudly to Freud that psychoanalysis in Britain &quot;stands in the forefront of medical, literary and psychological interest&quot; (letter 27 January 1919 (Paskauskas 1993)). As President of the Society – a post he would hold until 1944 – Jones secured funding for and supervised the establishment in London of a &quot;Clinic&quot; offering subsidised fees, and an Institute of Psychoanalysis, which provided administrative, publishing and training facilities for the growing network of professional psychoanalysts.

Jones went on to serve two periods as President of the International Psychoanalytic Association from 1920 to 1924 and 1932 to 1949, where he had significant influence. In 1920 he founded the &quot;International Journal of Psychoanalysis&quot;, serving as its editor until 1939. The following year he established the International Psychoanalytic Library, which published some 50 books under his editorship. Jones soon obtained from Freud rights to the English translation of his work. In 1924 the first two volumes of Freud&#x27;s &quot;Collected Papers&quot; was published in translations edited by Jones and supervised by Joan Riviere, his former analysand and, at one stage, ardent suitor. After a period in analysis with Freud, Riviere worked with Jones as the translation editor of the &quot;International Journal of Psychoanalysis.&quot; She then was part of a working group Jones set up to plan and deliver James Strachey&#x27;s translations for the standard edition of Freud&#x27;s work.
Largely through Jones&#x27; energetic advocacy, the British Medical Association officially recognised psychoanalysis in 1929. The BBC subsequently removed him from a list of speakers declared to be dangerous to public morality. In the 1930s Jones and his colleagues made a series of radio broadcasts on psychoanalysis.

After Adolf Hitler took power in Germany, Jones helped many displaced and endangered Jewish analysts to resettle in England and other countries. Following the Anschluss of March 1938, Jones flew into Vienna at considerable personal risk to play a crucial role in negotiating and organising the emigration of Freud and his circle to London.

==Jones–Freud controversy==
Jones&#x27;s early published work on psychoanalysis had been devoted to expositions of the fundamentals of Freudian theory, an elaboration of its theory of symbolism, and its application to the analysis of religion, mythology, folklore and literary and artistic works. Under the influence of Melanie Klein, Jones&#x27; work took a new direction.

Klein had made an impact in Berlin in the new field of child analysis and had impressed Jones in 1925 when he attended her series of lectures to the British Society in London. At Jones&#x27;s invitation she moved to London the following year; she soon acquired a number of devoted and influential followers. Her work had a dramatic effect on the British Society, polarising its members into rival factions as it became clear that her approach to child analysis was seriously at odds with that of Anna Freud, as set out in her 1927 book &quot;An Introduction to the Technique of Child Analysis&quot;. The disagreement centred around the clinical approach to the pre-Oedipal child; Klein argued for play as an equivalent to free association in adult analyses. Anna Freud opposed any such equivalence, proposing an educative intervention with the child until an appropriate level of ego development was reached at the Oedipal stage. Klein held this to be a collusive inhibition of analytical work with the child.

Influenced by Klein, and initiating what became known as the Jones–Freud controversy, Jones set out to explore a range of interlinked topics in the theory of early psychic development. These included the structure and genesis of the superego and the nature of the feminine castration complex. He coined the term &quot;phallocentrism&quot; in a critique of Freud&#x27;s account of sexual difference. He argued together with Klein and her Berlin colleague, Karen Horney, for a primary femininity, saying that penis envy arose as a defensive formation rather than arising from the fact, or &quot;injury&quot;, of biological asymmetry. In a corresponding reformulation of the castration complex, Jones introduced the concept of &quot;aphanisis&quot; to refer to the fear of &quot;the permanent extinction of the capacity (including opportunity) for sexual enjoyment&quot;.

These departures from orthodoxy were noted in Vienna and were topics that were featured in the regular Freud–Jones correspondence, the tone of which became increasingly fractious. Faced with accusations from Freud of orchestrating a campaign against him and his daughter, Jones sought to allay Freud&#x27;s concerns without abandoning his new critical standpoint. Eventually, following a series of exchange lectures between the Vienna and London societies, which Jones arranged with Anna Freud, Freud and Jones resumed their usual cordial exchanges.

With the arrival in Britain of refugee German and Viennese analysts in the 1930s, including Anna Freud in 1938, the hostility between the orthodox Freudians and Kleinians in the British Society grew more intense. Jones chaired a number of &quot;extraordinary business meetings&quot; with the aim of defusing the conflict, and these continued into the war years. The meetings, which became known as the controversial discussions, were established on a more regular basis from 1942. By that time, Jones had removed himself from direct participation, owing to ill health and the difficulties of war-time travel from his home in Elsted, West Sussex. He resigned from the presidency of the British Society in 1944, the year in which, under the presidency of Sylvia Payne, there finally emerged a compromise agreement which established parallel training courses providing options to satisfy the concerns of the rival groups that had formed: followers of Anna Freud, followers of Melanie Klein and a non-aligned group of Middle or Independent Group analysts. It was agreed further that all the key policy making committees of the BPS should have representatives from the three groups.

== Later life and death==
After the end of the war, Jones gradually relinquished his many official posts whilst continuing his psychoanalytic practice, writings and lecturing. The major undertaking of his final years was his monumental account of Freud&#x27;s life and work, published to widespread acclaim in three volumes between 1953 and 1957. In this he was ably assisted by his German-speaking wife, who translated much of Freud&#x27;s early correspondence and other archive documentation made available by Anna Freud. His uncompleted autobiography, &quot;Free Associations&quot;, was published posthumously in 1959.

Always proud of his Welsh origins, Jones became a member of the Welsh Nationalist Party, Plaid Cymru. He had a particular love of the Gower Peninsula, which he had explored extensively in his youth. Following the purchase of a holiday cottage in Llanmadoc, this area became a regular holiday retreat for the Jones family. He was instrumental in helping secure its status in 1956, as the first region of the UK to be designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.
Both of Jones&#x27;s main leisure pursuits resulted in significant publications. A keen ice skater since his schooldays, Jones published an influential textbook on the subject. His passion for chess inspired a psychoanalytical study of the life of American chess genius, Paul Morphy.

Jones was made a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians (FRCP) in 1942, Honorary President of the International Psychoanalytical Association in 1949, and was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Science degree at Swansea University (Wales) in 1954.

Jones died in London on 11 February 1958, and was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium. His ashes were buried in the grave of the oldest of his four children in the churchyard of St Cadoc&#x27;s Cheriton on the Gower Peninsula.

<text>Richard Dafydd Vivian Llewellyn Lloyd (; 8 December 1906, London – 30 November 1983, Dublin), known by his pen name Richard Llewellyn ( , ), was a British novelist of a Welsh background, who is best remembered for his 1939 novel &quot;How Green Was My Valley&quot;, which chronicles life in a coal mining village in the South Wales Valleys.

==Biography==
Richard Herbert Vivian Lloyd (he later used the name &quot;Richard Dafydd Vivian Llewellyn Lloyd&quot;) was born in Hendon, Middlesex in 1906, the second child and only son of William Llewellyn Lloyd, a hotel clerk and later the assistant secretary to a club, and Sarah Anne, &quot;née&quot; Thomas. Only after his death was it discovered that Llewellyn&#x27;s claim that he was born in St Davids, West Wales, was false.

In the U.S., Llewellyn won the National Book Award for favourite novel of 1940, voted by members of the American Booksellers Association.

He lived a peripatetic existence, travelling widely throughout his life. Before World War II he spent periods working in hotels, wrote a play, worked as a coal miner and produced his best-known novel. During World War II he rose to the rank of Captain in the Welsh Guards. His sister Gwladys (a Royal Red Cross commandant) and her two daughters were killed during the bombing of London, in June 1944. Following the war he worked as a journalist, covering the Nuremberg Trials, and then as a screenwriter for MGM. During his lifetime, he lived in a variety of countries, including Italy, China, Brazil, Argentina, Kenya and Israel, in addition to Britain and Ireland.

Llewellyn married twice: his first wife was Nona Theresa Catherine Sonsteby, whom he married in 1952 and divorced in 1968; his second wife was editor Susan Frances Heimann, whom he married in 1974.

Richard Llewellyn died of a heart attack in St. Vincent&#x27;s Hospital, Dublin on 30 November 1983.

==Themes==
Several of his novels dealt with a Welsh theme, the best-known being &quot;How Green Was My Valley&quot; (1939), which won international acclaim and was made into a classic Hollywood film. It immortalised the way of life of the South Wales Valleys coal mining communities, where Llewellyn spent a small amount of time with his grandfather. Three sequels followed.

<text>Richard Arthur Warren Hughes (19 April 1900 – 28 April 1976) was a British writer of poems, short stories, novels and plays.

==Biography==
He was born in Weybridge, Surrey. His father was Arthur Hughes, a civil servant, and his mother was Louisa Grace Warren who had been brought up in the West Indies in Jamaica. He was educated first at Charterhouse School and graduated from Oriel College, Oxford in 1922.

A Charterhouse schoolmaster had sent Hughes&#x27;s first published work to the magazine &quot;The Spectator&quot; in 1917. The article, written as a school essay, was an unfavourable criticism of &quot;The Loom of Youth&quot;, by Alec Waugh, a recently published novel which caused a furore for its account of homosexual passions between British schoolboys in a public school. At Oxford, he met Robert Graves, also an Old Carthusian, and they co-edited a poetry publication, &quot;Oxford Poetry&quot;, in 1921. Hughes&#x27;s short play &quot;The Sisters&#x27; Tragedy&quot; was being staged in the West End of London at the Royal Court Theatre by 1922. He was the author of the world&#x27;s first radio play, &quot;A Comedy Of Danger&quot;, commissioned from him for the BBC by Nigel Playfair and broadcast on 15 January 1924.

Hughes was employed as a journalist and travelled widely before he married the painter Frances Bazley (1905–1985) in 1932. They settled for a period in Norfolk and then in 1934 at Castle House, Laugharne in South Wales. Dylan Thomas stayed with Hughes and wrote his book &quot;Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog&quot; whilst living at Castle House. Hughes was instrumental in Thomas relocating permanently to the area.

He wrote only four novels, the most famous of which is &quot;The Innocent Voyage&quot; (1929), or &quot;A High Wind in Jamaica&quot;, as Hughes renamed it soon after its initial publication. Set in the 19th century, it explores the events which follow the accidental capture of a group of English children by pirates: the children are revealed as considerably more amoral than the pirates (it was in this novel that Hughes first described the cocktail Hangman&#x27;s Blood). In 1938, he wrote an allegorical novel, &quot;In Hazard&quot;, based on the true story of the &quot;S.S. Phemius&quot; who was caught in the 1932 Cuba hurricane for four days during its maximum intensity. He wrote volumes of children&#x27;s stories, including &quot;The Spider&#x27;s Palace&quot;.

During the war, Hughes had a desk job in the Admiralty. He met the architects Jane Drew and Maxwell Fry, whose children stayed with the Hughes family for much of that time. After the end of the war, he spent ten years writing scripts for Ealing Studios, and published no more novels until 1961. Of the trilogy &quot;The Human Predicament&quot;, only the first two volumes, &quot;The Fox in the Attic&quot; (1961) and &quot;The Wooden Shepherdess&quot; (1973), were complete when he died; twelve chapters, less than 50 pages, of the final volume are now published. In these, he describes the course of European history from the 1920s through World War II, including real characters and events—such as Hitler&#x27;s escape after the abortive Munich putsch—as well as fictional.

Later in life, Hughes relocated to Ynys in Gwynedd. He was churchwarden of Llanfihangel-y-traethau, the village church, where he was buried when he died at home in 1976.

Hughes was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and, in the United States, an honorary member of both the National Institute of Arts and Letters and the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He was awarded the OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 1946.

==Family==

Richard and Frances Hughes had five children. Their second child, Penelope Hughes, published a memoir, &quot;Richard Hughes: Author, Father&quot;, in 1984.
