<text>In the fictional universe of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, the Prime Directive (also known as &quot;Starfleet General Order 1&quot;, and the &quot;non-interference directive&quot;) is a guiding principle of Starfleet that prohibits its members from interfering with the natural development of alien civilizations. Its stated aim is to protect unprepared civilizations from the danger of starship crews introducing advanced technology, knowledge, and values before they are ready. Since its introduction in the first season of the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series, the directive has been featured in many &quot;Star Trek&quot; episodes as part of a moral question over how best to establish diplomatic relations with new alien worlds. 

==The Prime Directive==
The Prime Directive is one of many guidelines for Starfleet&#x27;s mandate to explore the galaxy and &quot;seek out new life and new civilizations.&quot; Although the concept of the Prime Directive has been alluded to and paraphrased by many &quot;Star Trek&quot; characters during the television series and feature films, the text of the directive was only revealed to viewers in 2021 during the &quot;Star Trek: Prodigy&quot; episode &quot;First Con-Tact&quot; set in 2383. Two sections of the text were shown, and are as follows:

Section 1:
Starfleet crew will obey the following with any civilization that has not achieved a commensurate level of technological and/or societal development as described in Appendix 1.

a) No identification of self or mission.

b) No interference with the social, cultural, or technological development of said planet.

c) No reference to space, other worlds, or advanced civilizations.

d) The exception to this is if said society has already been exposed to the concepts listed herein. However, in that instance, section 2 applies.

Section 2:
If said species has achieved the commensurate level of technological and/or societal development as described in Appendix 1, or has been exposed to the concepts listed in section 1, no Starfleet crew person will engage with said society or species without first gathering extensive information on the specific traditions, laws, and culture of that species civilization. Then Starfleet crew will obey the following.

a) If engaged with diplomatic relations with said culture, will stay within the confines of said culture&#x27;s restrictions.

b) No interference with the social development of said planet.

The Prime Directive was frequently applied to less developed planets which had not yet discovered warp travel or subspace communication technology. The Prime Directive was also sometimes applied to advanced civilizations that already knew of life on other worlds but were protected by empires outside the Federation&#x27;s jurisdiction. First contact could be made by the Federation with alien worlds that had either discovered warp or were on the verge of it, or with highly advanced civilizations that simply hadn&#x27;t ventured into space yet. In those cases, the Prime Directive was used as a general policy to not disrupt or interfere with their culture when establishing peaceful diplomatic relations.

Consequences for violating the Prime Directive could range from a stern reprimand to a demotion, depending on the severity of the infraction. However, enforcement of these rules -- and interpretations of the Prime Directive itself -- varied greatly and were at the discretion of the commanding officer. In many instances, prominent Starfleet personnel like captains James T. Kirk, Jean-Luc Picard, Kathryn Janeway and Benjamin Sisko willingly broke the Prime Directive but faced no real punishment or consequence for doing so.

However, the Prime Directive is not absolute. Starship captains have been known to violate it to protect their ships and crews, and certain Starfleet regulations such as The Omega Directive can even render it null and void in certain circumstances.

==Creation and evolution==
Creation of the Prime Directive is generally credited to &quot;Original Series&quot; producer Gene L. Coon. Later writers have suggested that the Prime Directive was influenced by the Vietnam War or designed to show a civilization that had evolved beyond colonialism. This would have been consistent with Coon and Roddenberry&#x27;s political outlooks, but the notion of science fictional first contact and its possible harms already had a decades-long history by 1966.

===Notable on-screen references===

==== &quot;The Original Series&quot; ====
*The first filmed reference to the Prime Directive occurs in the first season &quot;TOS&quot; episode &quot;The Return of the Archons&quot; (1966), when Spock begins to caution Captain Kirk of the starship &quot;Enterprise&quot; when he proposes to destroy a computer controlling an entire civilization. Kirk interrupts him after Spock says, &quot;Captain, our Prime Directive of non-interference&quot; with, &quot;That refers to a living, growing culture...&quot; Later, Kirk argues the computer into self-destruction and leaves behind a team of sociologists to help restore the society to a &quot;human&quot; form.
*In the second-season episode &quot;The Apple&quot;, Spock says of Kirk&#x27;s plan to destroy Vaal, &quot;If we do what it seems we must, in my opinion, it will be in direct violation of the non-interference directive.&quot;
*In the second-season episode &quot;A Piece of the Action&quot;, Kirk, briefing Spock and McCoy before beaming down on possible interference 100 years earlier by the Federation ship, the &quot;Horizon&quot;, Kirk explicitly states, &quot;the contact came before the non-interference directive&quot;.
*In the second-season episode &quot;A Private Little War&quot;, two different factions on a planet were at war with each other and it is discovered that the Klingons were furnishing one faction with advanced weapons. Kirk responded by arming the other faction with the same weapons. This resulted in an arms race on that world, as a fictionalized parallel to the then-current Cold War arms race, in which the United States often armed one side of a dispute and the Soviet Union armed the other. 
**In a similar storyline on &quot;TNG&quot;, &quot;Too Short a Season&quot;, a Starfleet admiral admits he interpreted the Prime Directive to mean equally arming two different factions on a planet, intended to reach a stalemate, but which resulted in 40 years of war.
*In the second-season episode &quot;Patterns of Force,&quot; Federation cultural observer and historian John Gill created a regime based on Nazi Germany on a primitive planet in an effort to create a society which combined the high efficiency of a fascist dictatorship with a more benign philosophy. In doing so, he contaminated the normal and healthy development of the planet&#x27;s culture, with disastrous effects; the regime adopts the same racial supremacist and genocidal ideologies of the original. Eventually, this leaves investigating Starfleet officers with no other option but to arrange the overthrow of the government in order to mitigate the harm of Gill&#x27;s interference.
*In the second-season episode &quot;The Omega Glory&quot;, after finding out that Captain Tracy may have violated the Prime Directive, Captain Kirk states, &quot;A starship captain&#x27;s most solemn oath is that he will give his life, even his entire crew, rather than violate the Prime Directive.&quot;
*In the second-season episode &quot;Bread and Circuses&quot;, the crew discusses that the Prime Directive is in effect, saying, &quot;No identification of self or mission. No interference with the social development of said planet. No references to space, or the fact that there are other worlds, or more advanced civilizations.&quot;

==== &quot;The Next Generation&quot; ====
*In the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; (&quot;TNG&quot;) first-season episode &quot;Symbiosis&quot;, Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the starship &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D states that, &quot;The Prime Directive is not just a set of rules; it is a philosophy... and a very correct one. History has proven again and again that whenever mankind interferes with a less developed civilization, no matter how well-intentioned that interference may be, the results are invariably disastrous.&quot;
* In the third season episode &quot;Who Watches the Watchers&quot;, the crew of the Enterprise expose a pre-warp civilization on Mintaka III to Federation technology. Despite an attempted mind wipe, the Mintakans remember and now revere Picard as a god. Picard intentionally breaks the Prime Directive again by beaming one of the Mintakans aboard the Enterprise and explaining they are on a starship, and not gods, showing them their world from space and encouraging them to spread the truth to the others. Eventually, he allowed himself to be shot by an arrow to prove he was mortal.
*In the fourth season episode &quot;The Drumhead&quot;, the captain of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; is being interrogated by retired Admiral Norah Satie, who says the Prime Directive is &quot;Starfleet General Order Number One&quot;. She claims that Picard had &quot;violated the Prime Directive a total of nine times since you took command of the Enterprise&quot;. (To this he responds &quot;My reports to Starfleet document the circumstances in each of those instances&quot;.)
* In the fourth season episode &quot;First Contact&quot;, Commander Riker goes undercover to scout a pre-warp civilization that is on the verge of discovering warp technology, preparing to establish diplomatic relations. When he is captured, Captain Picard and Deanna Troi make first contact early, but Picard refuses to share Federation technology with them due to the Prime Directive. After worries of social upheaval, the alien scientists developing warp travel believe their society isn&#x27;t ready for knowledge of extraterrestrial life, and they ask the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to leave without announcing their presence to the public, agreeing to delay developing warp technology until their culture is ready.
*In the seventh season episode &quot;Homeward&quot;, it is said that Starfleet had allowed 60 races to die out rather than interfere with their fate. However, in the episodes &quot;Homeward&quot; and &quot;Pen Pals&quot;, the crew debates the Prime Directive and the saving of civilizations.

==== &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; ====
*In the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; (&quot;DS9&quot;) first season episode &quot;Captive Pursuit&quot;, Commander Sisko references the Prime Directive as his reason for choosing not to interfere in a hunt of a member of sentient species from the Gamma Quadrant that is bred to be hunted. In the end, Sisko does allow Chief O&#x27;Brien to assist the hunted being to escape from his captors to continue the hunt.
*In the episode &quot;The Circle&quot;, the government of the planet Bajor experiences an internal, civil war-like conflict. Starfleet Commander Benjamin Sisko&#x27;s superior orders him to evacuate all Starfleet personnel from the station, noting, &quot;The Cardassians may involve themselves in other people&#x27;s civil wars, but we don&#x27;t.&quot;
* In the episode &quot;In the Pale Moonlight&quot;, Sisko and Garak plant evidence to force the Romulans to enter the Dominion War under false pretenses, with full knowledge and approval from Starfleet Command, despite this violating the Prime Directive&#x27;s edict of not interfering with other cultures or civilizations. Participation in the war by the Romulans resulted in massive military and civilian casualties within Romulan society.

==== &quot;Voyager&quot; ====
*In the &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; episode &quot;The Omega Directive,&quot; an exception to the Prime Directive was introduced. Starfleet&#x27;s Omega Directive authorizes a captain to take any and all means necessary to destroy Omega particles including interference with any society that creates them.
*In the episode &quot;Infinite Regress&quot;, Naomi Wildman informs Seven of Nine that she was familiar with the Prime Directive including all 47 suborders.
*In the episode &quot;Natural Law,&quot; Chakotay and Seven of Nine encounter a primitive culture protected by an energy barrier that they crash a shuttle into which protects the culture from the rest of the planet&#x27;s more advanced inhabitants. Although the two try to avoid contact, the natives encounter and help an injured Chakotay and start mimicking the pair and collecting shuttle debris as jewellery. After Seven manages to use the shuttle&#x27;s deflector to lower the barrier, &quot;Voyager&quot; is able to beam out all of the loose technology and minimize the Prime Directive violation. However, this leads to another issue when the other culture on the planet -- who have achieved spaceflight and openly engaged in friendly relations with &quot;Voyager&quot; -- seek to use the downed barrier to explore the previously blocked portion of their planet and civilize the natives. While such an idea has its benefits and detractors, Janeway cites the Prime Directive as the reason for taking down the barrier. In response, the natives knock out &quot;Voyager&#x27;s&quot; transporters and actively try to force the crew to leave the deflector behind, forcing Tom Paris to destroy it with the &quot;Delta Flyer&quot; instead. However, Seven worries that as her deflector modifications were already scanned, they may be replicated in time to take down the barrier again.
*In the episode &quot;Endgame&quot; the Future Admiral Janeway warns the present Captain Janeway against holding on to the &quot;Prime Directive&quot; when the Future Janeway goes back in time to change history by having Voyager get back to Earth in only 7 years instead of 23 years.

==== &quot;Enterprise&quot; ====
*Filmed between 2001 and 2005, &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; (&quot;ENT&quot;) is a prequel to &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; (&quot;TOS&quot;), set before the implementation of the Prime Directive. The first-season episode &quot;Dear Doctor&quot; sees the ship&#x27;s doctor Phlox struggle with the ethics of providing a cure to a pre-warp species with a deadly disease. Captain Jonathan Archer notes that as humanity grapples with their newfound reach, they will have to develop &quot;a doctrine, something that tells us what we can and can&#x27;t do out here, should and shouldn&#x27;t do.&quot; 
*Additionally, the &quot;ENT&quot; episodes &quot;Fight or Flight&quot; and &quot;Civilization&quot;, make reference to a Vulcan policy of non-interference, a possible model for Starfleet&#x27;s Prime Directive.

==== &quot;Discovery&quot; ====
*In &quot;New Eden&quot;, the second episode in season two of &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot; aired in 2019, the away party is selected and briefed to ensure that their interactions with humans from pre-warp capable Earth does not interfere with their development. The regulation is exclusively referred to as General Order 1. Captain Christopher Pike later breaks the Prime Directive to reveal the truth to one of the locals in exchange for a World War III era helmet camera, but the man promises to keep quiet about it to his people. Commander Michael Burnham argued to Pike that the helmet camera and the answers it might contain to solve the mystery, was more important than the Prime Directive, and that one would have to be sacrificed to uphold the other – and only the captain could make that choice.
*In &quot;Whistlespeak&quot; of season five, the &quot;Discovery&quot; encounters the Halem&#x27;nites, a pre-warp, pre-industrial society that is protected by a Denobulan weather tower which shields the only habitable part of the planet against sandstorms and generates rain. The Denobulans had installed the weather tower and four others like it in secret and masked them as mountains in order to avoid breaking the Prime Directive. However, the other four failed and the last one is failing, leading the Halemn&#x27;ites to build a whole religion around them. While Captain Michael Burnham and Lieutenant Sylvia Tilly at first discreetly infiltrate the locals, allowing Burnham to repair the tower in secret, Tilly&#x27;s life is put in danger when the Halem&#x27;nites prepare to sacrifice her as part of a ritual to bring rain. Burnham expressly chooses to violate the Prime Directive to save her friend, arguing that Tilly and a local named Ravah should not suffer a pointless death and, without learning how to properly maintain the tower themselves, the Halem&#x27;nites will eventually go extinct.

==== &quot;Prodigy&quot; ====
* The villain of the first season, the Diviner, came from the future. In his original timeline the Vau N&#x27;Akat saw the arrival of a Federation ship to its planet. This divided their society between those who wanted to join the Federation and those who refused, and the ensuing civil war destroyed them. The Federation refused to take sides in the civil war. The Diviner considered it a subtle act of aggression and jumped to the past, the series&#x27; present, to destroy the Federation before it makes first contact with his people.
* In &quot;First Con-tact,&quot; a holographic version of Kathryn Janeway informs the young crew of the USS &quot;Protostar&quot; of the Prime Directive before they attempt a first contact mission. However, captain Dal R&#x27;El is tricked by his old Ferengi mentor DaiMon Nandi, resulting in a disastrous first contact. Although the crew returns what Nandi stole, Janeway furiously berates them as not only was the Prime Directive broken, but the way that things went down will have a negative impact on any possible relations that the race that they had met will have with outsiders going forwards.
* In &quot;All the World&#x27;s a Stage,&quot; the crew of the &quot;Protostar&quot; meet a civilization, the Enderprizians, that experienced massive cultural contamination due to a visit by the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; around a hundred years before. According to the locals&#x27; history, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; detected a danger to the Enderprizians that Ensign David Garrovick volunteered for a solo mission to address without breaking the Prime Directive. However, Garrovick crashed and was saved by the locals with his presence, technology and stories leading to them basing their whole culture around Starfleet and the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. One local, Doctor Boons (named after Leonard McCoy&#x27;s nickname of Bones), reveals that Garrovick had told the people about the Prime Directive and that they weren&#x27;t ready for the Federation or their technology, but the Enderprizians saw the Federation and its ideals as something to believe in. The &quot;Protostar&#x27;s&quot; meeting with the Enderprizians is treated as second contact rather than a Prime Directive violation. In the season finale, an Enderprizian is seen in a Starfleet class, suggesting that they ended up making more official contact with Starfleet in the end.
* In &quot;Brink,&quot; The Doctor mentions that sending the &quot;Protostar&quot; crew to Solum wouldn&#x27;t technically violate the Prime Directive or &quot;Voyager&#x27;s&quot; direct orders as the crew are not Starfleet personnel. However, when Gwyn asks to rescue her father Ilthuran -- the present day version of the Diviner -- Commander Tysess worries that doing so would be taking sides in the brewing civil war which the Prime Directive prohibits. Janeway agrees to allow the rescue, pointing out that nothing prevents them from granting Ilthuran political asylum, particularly as he is the best hope for a peaceful resolution to the conflict. While Janeway states that Starfleet will disavow their actions if they&#x27;re caught, she allows &quot;Voyager&quot; to supply the crew with various technologies for their mission.
* In &quot;Touch of Grey,&quot; despite Janeway previously declaring that the &quot;Protostar&quot; crew would be disavowed if they were caught, she personally leads Chakotay, The Doctor and Wesley Crusher to rescue them. As civil war breaks out on Solum, just like it did in the future that the Diviner came from, Gwyn asks Janeway for help in saving her homeworld which would be taking sides and thus violating the Prime Directive. Rather than staying out of it like the Federation did in the Diviner&#x27;s future, Janeway instantly agrees to help, having been reminded that boldness isn&#x27;t only for the young.
* In &quot;Ouroboros, Part I,&quot; &quot;Voyager&quot; and the &quot;Protostar&quot; engage Asencia&#x27;s forces to buy time for the &quot;Protostar&quot; crew to enact their plan. While the battle results in the defeat of Asencia and the favorable end of the civil war, the Federation&#x27;s direct role is minimal, limited primarily to &quot;Voyager&quot; and the &quot;Protostar&quot; engaging Asencia&#x27;s fleet which is in the middle of launching to attack every major Federation outpost across three quadrants. Like in &quot;Brink,&quot; the forces sent to the ground who take direct part in Asencia&#x27;s defeat are non-Starfleet personnel. In the following episode, Janeway leads official first contact between the Federation and the Vau N&#x27;Akat which Gwyn had previously tried and failed to establish.

==== &quot;Strange New Worlds&quot; ====
* In &quot;Strange New Worlds&quot;, the first episode of season one of &quot;Star Trek: Strange New Worlds&quot;, Captain Pike reveals the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to a society that has reverse engineered a matter-anti-matter reactor as a weapon after witnessing the Battle near Xahea. However, the Federation Council could not address how the weapon was created because the Battle near Xahea was classified information, which prevented them from charging Pike with violating General Order 1. The Federation Council is also considering renaming General Order 1 as the Prime Directive, which Captain Pike says will &quot;never stick&quot;.
* In &quot;Among the Lotus Eaters,&quot; Pike orders the removal of a radioactive asteroid from the surface of the planet Rigel VII. Spock argues that they are violating the Prime Directive, but Pike counters that the asteroid&#x27;s effects were stunting the growth of the local civilization and as such, they are merely setting things right rather than interfering which Spock concedes is a logical argument.

==== &quot;Picard&quot; ====
*In &quot;Vox,&quot; Geordi La Forge mentions that Starfleet had raised the wrecked saucer section of the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D off of the surface of Veridian III following the events of &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot; in order to avoid breaking the Prime Directive due to the pre-warp civilization living in the star system. This allowed La Forge the chance to spend twenty years secretly rebuilding the ship.

==== Films ====
*In the feature film &quot;Star Trek: Insurrection&quot;, Picard violates orders to protect the rights of a planet&#x27;s population when he feels an admiral is breaking the Prime Directive.
*In the feature film &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot;, Captain Kirk violates the prime directive by saving Spock&#x27;s life while attempting to stop an active volcano that threatens the native inhabitants, and then by exposing the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to those inhabitants. As punishment, Kirk is removed from command of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and demoted to first officer instead. Initially, his punishment was to be sent back to Starfleet Academy, but Admiral Pike intervened on Kirk&#x27;s behalf. The subsequent actions of Khan Noonien Singh lead to Kirk being reinstated soon afterwards.

==Criticism==
The Prime Directive has been criticized in-universe because of the inconsistencies in which it is applied. In the &quot;TOS&quot; episodes &quot;Friday&#x27;s Child,&quot; &quot;For the World Is Hollow and I Have Touched the Sky,&quot; &quot;The Cloud Minders,&quot; &quot;The Apple,&quot; &quot;The Return of the Archons,&quot; &quot;Space Seed&quot; and &quot;A Taste of Armageddon,&quot; the crew of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; either interferes with laws or customs of alien worlds or outright colonizes an alien planet to achieve a Federation objective, to save the lives of the crew, or to better the lives of the inhabitants.

Out-of-universe criticisms focus on the above problems; that the Prime Directive is simply a plot device and is manipulated by the writers. Janet D. Stemwedel points out a potential conflict between the anti-colonialist intentions of the Federation and the &quot;ethical project of sharing a universe&quot; which would require &quot;a kind of reciprocity — even if your technological attainment is quite different, it means recognizing you are owed the same moral consideration.&quot; Stemwedel writes, &quot;If your concern is not to change the natural behavior or development of alien citizens at any cost, your best bet is to stay at home rather than to explore new worlds.&quot; Ars Technica asked lawyers to comment on the Prime Directive and other &quot;Star Trek&quot; legal issues. Criticism included interpreting the Prime Directive as a product of the Cold War environment in which Roddenberry wrote, as well as indicating that enforcement would be lacking.

==Temporal Prime Directive==
The &quot;Temporal Prime Directive&quot; is a fictional guideline for time travelers (from the past &quot;or&quot; future) from interfering in the natural development of a timeline.

In the &quot;TNG&quot; episode &quot;A Matter of Time&quot;, Picard compares the Prime Directive to a possible Temporal Prime Directive: 
&quot;Of course, you know of the Prime Directive, which tells us that we have no right to interfere with the natural evolution of alien worlds. Now I have sworn to uphold it, but nevertheless I have disregarded that directive on more than one occasion because I thought it was the right thing to do. Now, if you are holding on to some temporal equivalent of that directive, then isn&#x27;t it possible that you have an occasion here to make an exception, to help me to choose, because it&#x27;s the right thing to do?&quot;

As 31st-century time traveler Daniels revealed to Captain Jonathan Archer in the &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; episode &quot;Cold Front&quot;, as time travel technology became practical, the Temporal Accords were established sometime before the 31st century, to allow the use of time travel for the purposes of studying history, while prohibiting the use of it to alter history.

As revealed in the &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot; episode &quot;Face the Strange,&quot; the Temporal Prime Directive is still in effect in the late 32nd century.

<doc id="46447" wikidata="Q2896374" url="?curid=46447" title="Scotch broth">
<text>Scotch broth is a soup originating in Scotland. The principal ingredients are usually barley, stewing or braising cuts of lamb, mutton or beef, root vegetables (such as carrots, swedes, or sometimes turnips), and dried pulses (most often split peas and red lentils). Cabbage and leeks are often added shortly before serving to preserve their texture, colour and flavours. The proportions and ingredients vary according to the recipe or availability. Scotch broth has been sold ready-prepared in tins for many years.

==History==
In the early 19th-century cookery book &quot;A New System of Domestic Cookery&quot; by Maria Rundell, &quot;Scotch Mutton Broth&quot; is made with mutton neck, skimmed and simmered around an hour before good-quality cuts of bone-in mutton are trimmed of their fat and added to the soup. After several hours, soup vegetables are added—turnips, carrots and onion—and simmered until just tender; finally, pre-soaked Scotch barley is added. The soup is served with a garnish of fresh parsley.

According to Christian Isobel Johnstone, the mutton could be served on the side as a &quot;bouilli&quot; with caper sauce, parsley and butter, pickled cucumbers, or nasturtiums (edible flowers) with mustard and vinegar.

==Ingredients==
The main ingredients are barley, stewing lamb or mutton, and root vegetables like swedes, potatoes, turnip and carrot. Dried beans are another common addition, as are cabbage and leeks, which can be added in later stages of cooking.

<text>Corn soup is a soup made of corn, typically sweetcorn. Initially popular only in corn-producing areas of the world, the dish is now widespread because of greater corn distribution. Typical ingredients are corn cut from the cob, water, butter and flour, with salt and pepper for seasoning. Additional ingredients vary by region, and may include eggs.

== Native Americans ==
Corn, being a staple crop for many Native American tribes has led to corn soup being a primary food among them. M. R. Harrington reported that 1908 hulled-corn soup &quot;onno&#x27;kwǎ&quot;&#x27; was the most popular dish for the Seneca Indians (Native Americans). He also stated, &quot;[s]eldom do the Indians, pagan or Christian, meet for any function [...] without a kettle of onno&#x27;kwǎ&#x27;, hot and savory, to regale the crowd&quot;. The soup was served at religious events, the people getting a ladleful every time they encircled the kettle.

== List of corn soup dishes ==

Several types of soups are prepared using corn as a primary ingredient.
* Cream of corn soup and creamed corn soup
* Sweet corn soup
* Corn crab soup
* Chinese sweet corn soup (&quot;yumigeng&quot; or &quot;sumigeng&quot;)
* Dried (Indian) corn soup

<doc id="46459" wikidata="Q29019737" url="?curid=46459" title="Clam soup">
<text>Clam soup is a soup prepared using clams as a primary ingredient. Clam soup can be prepared as a thin, broth- or cream/milk-based soup and as a thicker, chowder-style soup. In Japan, hot miso soup prepared with clams is believed by some to be a cure for the hangover.

==Overview==
Clam soup is prepared using clams as a main ingredient. Additional ingredients can include carrot, celery, onion and other vegetables, vegetable broth or stock or other types of broths and stocks (such as fish stock) seasonings and spices, salt and pepper. Fresh or canned clams can be used to prepare the dish. Clam chowder is a well-known clam soup, but not all clam soups are chowders or have the thick consistency that chowders typically possess.

In Japan, hot miso soup with clams is a traditional cure for the hangover. Clams possess high levels of ornithine, an amino acid that some Japanese people believe serves to reduce levels of stress, and &quot;helps improve liver function—including detoxifying harmful substances like alcohol.&quot; A canned clam soup product named &quot;Power of 70&quot; claims to cure hangovers.

==Varieties==
===Clam chowder===

Clam chowder is a clam soup prepared as a chowder, typically using a cream base. Several varieties of clam chowder exist. Manhattan clam chowder is a tomato-based soup prepared with vegetables and clams, but lacks cream or milk.

===Jaecheop-guk===

Jaecheop-guk is a clear Korean soup made with small freshwater clams called &quot;jaecheop&quot; (재첩, &quot;Corbicula leana&quot;). It is a local specialty of the Gyeongsang Province where &quot;jaecheop&quot; are harvested, such as the lower reaches of Nakdong River, and river basins around Gimhae, Myeongji, Eumgung, and Hadan counties as well as places near the Suyeong River in Busan and the Seomjin River.

<doc id="46461" wikidata="Q1432535" url="?curid=46461" title="Chicken soup">
<text>Chicken soup is a soup made from chicken, simmered in water, usually with various other ingredients. The classic chicken soup consists of a clear chicken broth, often with pieces of chicken or vegetables; common additions are pasta, noodles, dumplings, or grains such as rice and barley. Chicken soup is commonly considered a comfort food.

==History==

Humans were already boiling food by the time that chicken was domesticated in the neolithic period, so it is likely that chickens were being boiled for soup.

Modern American chicken soup, which typically includes root vegetables such as carrot, onion, leeks and celery, was a staple across Northern Europe and was brought to the United States by immigrants.

==Preparation==

Variations on the flavor are gained by adding root vegetables such as parsnip, potato, sweet potato and celery root; herbs such as bay leaves, parsley and dill; other vegetables such as zucchini, whole garlic cloves, lettuce, or tomatoes; and black pepper. The soup should be brought slowly to a boil and then simmered in a covered pot on a very low flame for one to three hours, adding water if necessary. Saffron or turmeric are sometimes added as a yellow colorant.

==Nutritional value==
Chicken soup can be a relatively low fat food: fat can be removed by chilling the soup after cooking and skimming the layer of congealed fat from the top. A study determined that &quot;prolonged cooking of a bone in soup increases the calcium content of the soup when cooked at an acidic, but not at a neutral pH&quot;.

==Terminology==
Strictly speaking, chicken soup, unless qualified, implies that the soup is served as a thin broth, with pieces of meat, and possibly vegetables, and either noodles, rice, barley, or dumplings.

Cream of chicken soup is a thick, creamy, soup made with chicken stock and pieces, combined with milk (or cream) and flour, which might contain vegetable pieces, depending on the recipe. 

Several terms are used when referring to chicken soups:

*Chicken broth is the liquid part of chicken soup. Broth can be served as is, or used as stock, or served as soup with noodles. Broth can be milder than stock, does not need to be boiled as long, and can be made with meatier chicken parts.
*Chicken bouillon or bouillon de poulet is the French term for chicken broth.
*Chicken consommé is a more refined chicken broth. It is usually strained to perfect clarity, and reduced to concentrate it.
*Chicken stew is a more substantial dish with a higher ratio of solids to broth. The broth may also be thickened toward a gravy-like consistency with a roux or by adding flour-based dumplings (matzah balls do not have the same thickening effect).
*Chicken stock is a liquid in which chicken bones and vegetables have been simmered for the purpose of serving as an ingredient in more complex dishes. Chicken stock is not usually served as is. Stock can be made with less palatable parts of the chicken, such as feet, necks or bones: the higher bone content in these parts contributes more gelatin to the liquid, making it a better base for sauces. Stock can be reboiled and reused as the basis for a new stock. Bouillon cubes or soup base are often used instead of chicken stock prepared from scratch.

==Health effects==
Chicken soup has long been touted as a form of folk medicine to treat respiratory infections. In 2000, scientists at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha studied the effect of chicken soup on the inflammatory response &quot;in vitro&quot;. They found that some components of the chicken soup inhibit neutrophil migration, which may have an anti-inflammatory effect that could &quot;hypothetically&quot; lead to temporary ease from symptoms of illness. However, since these results have been obtained from purified cells (and directly applied), the diluted soup &quot;in vivo&quot; effect is debatable. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewed the University of Nebraska study, among others, in 2007 and concluded that &quot;none of the research is conclusive, and it is not known whether the changes measured in the laboratory really have a meaningful effect on people with cold symptoms.&quot;

It has also been shown that chicken soup contains the amino acid cysteine, which is very similar to acetylcysteine, which is used by doctors for patients with bronchitis and other respiratory infections.

Chicken soup is also known as &quot;Jewish penicillin&quot;, either as penicillin, or as alternative to penicillin.

== In different cultures ==
===China===
Many Chinese soups are based on chicken broth. Typical Chinese chicken soup is made from old hens and is seasoned with ginger, scallions, black pepper, soy sauce, rice wine and sesame oil. A more elaborate version can be made from freshly killed spent hen and various herbs such as ginseng, dried goji, and old ginger root. The soup is then boiled for hours.

===Colombia===

Bogotá, Colombia&#x27;s capital, is known for a version of chicken soup called &quot;ajiaco&quot;. Along with chicken, &quot;ajiaco&quot; typically includes maize, three types of potatoes, avocado, capers, and a herb called &quot;guascas&quot;, and is served with a dollop of cream.

&quot;Sancocho de gallina&quot; is another popular dish throughout Colombia and in neighboring countries. This is a broth that includes entire pieces of (often rather tough) soup hen on the bone with large pieces of plantain, potato, cassava and/or other vegetables. A bowl of &quot;sancocho&quot; is usually an entire meal.

===Denmark===
The Danish &quot;hønsekødssuppe&quot; is traditionally cooked using large hens specifically reserved for soup, known as &quot;suppehøner&quot; (&quot;soup-hens&quot;). Vegetables like celeriac, carrots, onions and leek are usually added and typical flavourings are thyme, laurels and white pepper. The soup may be served with small white dumplings and meatballs. As part of traditional housekeeping, the cooked meat is reserved for other dishes such as &quot;høns i asparges&quot; (&quot;hens in asparagus&quot;) or &quot;hønsesalat&quot; (&quot;hens-salad&quot;).

===France===
The French serve chicken-based forms of bouillon and consommé. Typical French seasonings for chicken soup includes: bay leaves, fresh thyme, dry white wine and garlic.

===Germany===
In Germany, chicken soup is made with chicken broth, vegetables, such as carrots, spices and herbs and small noodles. For the broth, a large hen, called a &quot;Suppenhuhn&quot; (lit.: &quot;soup hen&quot;), may be boiled, and pieces of it—especially from the boiled breast—can later be added to the soup.
In southern Germany, homemade chicken soup typically consists of chicken broth, to which spices and semolina dumplings or noodles are added. Another dish made with chicken broth, pieces of chicken, boiled vegetables, and spices is known as &quot;Hühnereintopf&quot;, meaning &quot;chicken stew&quot;. Alternatively, homemade noodles may be added to the chicken broth, without vegetables, and with only pickling spice, salt and pepper added to it.

===Ghana===
In Ghana, chicken soup, also known as Chicken Light soup is made by cooking the chicken in a blended mixture of tomatoes, onions, pepper and other spices and sometimes garden eggs and is served primarily with fufu or on its own.

===Greece===
In Greece, chicken soup is most commonly made in the &quot;avgolemono&quot; (&quot;egg-lemon&quot;) fashion, wherein beaten eggs mixed with lemon are added to a broth slowly so that the mixture heats up without curdling, also adding rice or pasta like &quot;kritharáki&quot; (&quot;little barley;&quot; orzo), resulting in a thicker texture; it is a traditional remedy for colds, stomach aches, and hangovers.

===Hungary===
Hungarian chicken soup is a clear soup, a consommé, called Újházi chicken soup. A consommé with entire pieces of chicken, chicken liver and heart, with chunky vegetables and spices like whole black peppercorn, bay leaves, salt and ground black pepper. The vegetables boiled along with the pieces of chicken are usually carrots, celeriac, parsley root and parsnip. Soup vermicelli, semolina dumplings or thin Spätzle noodles or small dumplings are also added to the soup. Even other vegetables may be used, such as green peas, a whole tomato and whole onions boiled along with the soup, mushrooms, asparagus, celery, green pepper, cauliflower, kohlrabi, green beans or parsley, in different combinations.

===Indonesia===

In Indonesia, chicken soup might appear as &quot;sayur sop&quot;, vegetable and chicken broth soup that contains chicken pieces, potato, green beans, carrot, celery, and fried shallot. Another chicken soup variant commonly found across the country is soto ayam; a turmeric yellow spicy chicken soup with vegetables and noodle or vermicelli, served with steamed rice, pieces of lontong or ketupat.

===Italy===
In Italy, chicken soup is often served with pasta, in such dishes as &quot;cappelletti in brodo&quot;, &quot;tortellini in brodo&quot; and &quot;passatelli&quot;. Even when served on its own, the meat and any vegetables used are usually removed from the broth and served as a second dish.

===Japan===
In Japan, chicken soup is known as &quot;torijiru&quot;. Typically it starts with dashi, which is made from boiling konbu (kelp) and katsuobushi (dried skipjack tuna flakes), and not by boiling the chicken (whole chicken is not typically available in Japanese supermarkets). After the dashi is prepared, pieces of boneless chicken thigh meat are usually used and combined with vegetables like daikon radish, carrot, burdock, konnyaku, welsh onion, mushrooms, potatoes, and taro root. At the end, different seasonings are added depending on the region of the country or type of soup. It could be a miso-based soup or soy sauce-based. Cooking sake, mirin, salt, and vinegar are also used with the soy sauce or miso. The pork equivalent called &quot;butajiru&quot; is more popular than the chicken-based soup.

Bone stocks for ramen are also often made with chicken stock, and it is almost invariably used in the less common &quot;kotteri&quot; variety.

===Jewish (Ashkenazi)===
Chicken soup is a traditional dish of the European Jewish kitchen. The Russian and Polish Jewish communities use a relatively high proportion of chicken stock for their soup, made mostly from the bones.
The soup is prepared with herbs like parsley and fresh dill or thyme, and is often served with &quot;knaidlach&quot; (matzah balls), &quot;kreplach&quot; (dumplings), lokshen (flat egg noodles), or &quot;mandlen (Shkedei Marak in Israel)&quot; (soup &quot;almonds&quot;). A traditional garnish was &quot;eyerlekh&quot; (little eggs). These unlaid chicken eggs were taken from a hen and boiled in the soup.&quot;&quot; Modern health standards make these difficult to obtain now.

===Korea===
&quot;Samgyetang&quot; is a Korean chicken soup with insam (Korean ginseng), daechu (dried jujube fruits), garlic, ginger, glutinous rice, and sometimes other medicinal herbs. It is believed to be not only a cure for physical ailments but also a preventer of sickness. &quot;Dak baeksuk&quot;, a type of chicken broth with garlic, is also popular among Koreans. It is believed by some to help cure minor illnesses such as the common cold. Some types of baeksuk also contains noodles, similar to chicken noodle soup.

===Mexico===

Caldo de pollo, also known as Consome de Pollo, is a common Latin-American soup made with whole chicken pieces instead of chopped or shredded chicken, and large cuts of vegetables, such as half-slices of potatoes and whole leaves of cabbage. Another variation of chicken soup is caldo tlalpeño which is garnished with chopped avocado, white cheese, and a chipotle chile.

===Peru===
Aguadito de pollo is a traditional chicken soup in Peruvian cuisine consisting of chicken, cilantro, vegetables and spices.

Caldo de Gallina (lit., &quot;broth of hen&quot;), the Peruvian form of chicken soup, is made with whole pieces of chicken instead of chopped or shredded chicken, along with potatoes, egg noodles, and hard-boiled eggs. Lime wedges and chili or aji pepper paste are added as condiments.

===Philippines===

Chicken soup in the Philippines is called &quot;sopas&quot; and has some western influences in it. While there are many variations in the recipe, it usually contains chicken strips in broth, onions, vegetables (mainly carrots, cabbage and celery), and macaroni noodles. It is cooked with evaporated milk to give it richer flavor. &quot;Sopas&quot; is normally associated with the cold, rainy season in the Philippines, and may thus be regarded as local comfort food.

Another chicken soup is called &quot;mami&quot; which its style derives from its other Asian neighboring countries, especially East Asia and normally served with sliced chicken, broth, noodles, chopped vegetables. Mami is also associated with the cold, rainy season as well.

Other chicken dishes are considered soups. &quot;Tinola&quot; has chicken cuts in broth, with ginger, chayote, and chili pepper leaves. &quot;Sinampalukang manok&quot; is sometimes regarded as a chicken version of &quot;sinigang&quot;, but here the meat is browned first before being boiled in the water and it uses tamarind leaves. &quot;Kadyos, manok, kag ubad&quot; from the Western Visayas uses pigeon peas and banana pith.

===Poland===

The Polish chicken soup is called rosół. It is commonly served with fine noodles, boiled carrots and parsley every Sunday. The broth is served separate from chicken meat.

There are many types of rosół, as:

Rosół Królewski (royal rosół), made of three meats: beef or veal, white poultry (hen, turkey or chicken) and dark poultry as duck, goose (crop only), just a couple of dried king boletes, one single cabbage leaf and a variety of vegetables such as parsley, celery, carrot, and leek. The cooking must take at least six hours of sensitive boiling over a small fire. At the end, softly burnt onion is added to the soup.

Rosół myśliwski (The hunter&#x27;s rosół) is made of a variety of wild birds as well as pheasant, capercaillie, wood grouse, black grouse, or grey partridge, with a small addition of roe deer meat, a couple of wild mushrooms, and 2–3 juniper fruits.

===Portugal and Brazil===

Chicken soup is known as canja, a chicken broth prepared with rice or pasta and shredded chicken meat. It is believed to help a person overcome colds and digestive problems, among other mild forms of sickness.

===Romania and Moldova===
In most regions of Romania, chicken soup known as supă de pui consists of a clear or dense sour soup with strained chicken and vegetable broth, and either noodles (tăieței) or dumplings (găluște) are added. Different versions use pieces of chicken and pieces of boiled vegetables (like onion, carrot, parsnip, celery, zucchini, peas, beans, leaves and root of parsley or peppers) and are seasoned usually with sour cream (smântână), tomato juice, lemon juice, or borș.

===Taiwan===
In Taiwan-style chicken soup, dried jujube fruits, dried shiitake, and other various herbs are also sometimes added. While it may be possible to use regular ginseng in the recipe, a special type of ginseng called san qi is commonly used. This is grown almost exclusively in Wenshan County, Yunnan Province. The roots are powdered for ease of use, although it may also be possible to use the flowerheads.

===Russia and Ukraine===
East Slavs traditionally prefer an often simple chicken and vegetable bouillon with added noodles or rice, and a pinch of fresh herbs. Another type of chicken soup includes chicken, noodles, carrot, potato and onion. Some cooks add chopped boiled egg and even sour cream to their variations of the soup.

===United Kingdom===
Traditionally, chicken soup (or broth) in Britain is a clear and watery soup with chunky vegetables (such as carrot, celery and onion), chicken, salt and pepper. However, a thick, creamy variety called cream of chicken soup, which may not contain any vegetable pieces (depending on the recipe), is more popular today. A distinct version from Scotland that has become popular throughout the UK is cock-a-leekie soup, a clear, thin broth of shredded chicken and leeks.

===United States and Canada===

In the United States and Canada, chicken soup often has noodles or rice in it, thus giving it its common name of &quot;chicken noodle soup&quot;. The term may have been coined in a commercial for the Campbell Soup Company in the 1930s. The original 21 varieties of Campbell&#x27;s condensed soup featured a &quot;chicken soup with noodles&quot;, but when it was advertised on the &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot; radio show in the 1930s by a slip of the tongue the soup was referred to as &quot;chicken noodle soup&quot;. Traditionally, American chicken soup was prepared using old hens too tough and stringy to be roasted or cooked for a short time. In modern times, these fowl are difficult to come by, and broiler chickens (young chickens suitable for roasting or broiling) are often used to make soup.

====Canned chicken soup====

Often (but not always) sold as a condensed soup, canned chicken soup such as Campbell&#x27;s Chicken Noodle Soup, is notable for its high sodium content: 890 mg per cup serving. This gives a cup bowl of soup about 2,500 mg of sodium, a full day&#x27;s allowance in the case of this mainstream brand. Other condensed chicken soups produced by Campbell&#x27;s, such as Chicken with Rice or Chicken &amp; Stars Soup, have similar amounts, as do generic versions of the product.

Canned chicken soup with much less sodium than the traditional formulation is available, including many varieties produced by Campbell&#x27;s, some with as little as 100 mg of sodium. Campbell&#x27;s claims production of a chicken noodle soup that will find broad consumer acceptance—in short, that will sell—is very difficult, so it has to balance healthfulness with sodium content.

Usually, the main ingredients of this canned soup are:
*Chicken broth
*Chicken
*Noodles
*Carrots
*Salt
*Celery, lettuce, or mushrooms, depending on the brand

<text>Image compression is a type of data compression applied to digital images, to reduce their cost for storage or transmission. Algorithms may take advantage of visual perception and the statistical properties of image data to provide superior results compared with generic data compression methods which are used for other digital data.
== Lossy and lossless image compression ==
Image compression may be lossy or lossless. Lossless compression is preferred for archival purposes and often for medical imaging, technical drawings, clip art, or comics. Lossy compression methods, especially when used at low bit rates, introduce compression artifacts. Lossy methods are especially suitable for natural images such as photographs in applications where minor (sometimes imperceptible) loss of fidelity is acceptable to achieve a substantial reduction in bit rate. Lossy compression that produces negligible differences may be called visually lossless.

Methods for lossy compression:

* Transform coding – This is the most commonly used method.
** Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) – The most widely used form of lossy compression. It is a type of Fourier-related transform, and was originally developed by Nasir Ahmed, T. Natarajan and K. R. Rao in 1974. The DCT is sometimes referred to as &quot;DCT-II&quot; in the context of a family of discrete cosine transforms (see discrete cosine transform). It is generally the most efficient form of image compression.
*** DCT is used in JPEG, the most popular lossy format, and the more recent HEIF.
** The more recently developed wavelet transform is also used extensively, followed by quantization and entropy coding.
* Color quantization - Reducing the color space to a few &quot;representative&quot; colors in the image. The selected colors are specified in the color palette in the header of the compressed image. Each pixel just references the index of a color in the color palette. This method can be combined with dithering to avoid posterization.
** Whole-image palette, typically 256 colors, used in GIF and PNG file formats.
** block palette, typically 2 or 4 colors for each block of 4x4 pixels, used in BTC, CCC, S2TC, and S3TC.
* Chroma subsampling. This takes advantage of the fact that the human eye perceives spatial changes of brightness more sharply than those of color, by averaging or dropping some of the chrominance information in the image.
* Fractal compression.
* More recently, methods based on Machine Learning were applied, using Multilayer perceptrons, Convolutional neural networks, Generative adversarial networks and Diffusion models. Implementations are available in OpenCV, TensorFlow, MATLAB&#x27;s Image Processing Toolbox (IPT), and the High-Fidelity Generative Image Compression (HiFiC) open source project.

Methods for lossless compression:

* Run-length encoding – used in default method in PCX and as one of possible in BMP, TGA, TIFF
* Predictive coding – used in DPCM
* Entropy encoding – the two most common entropy encoding techniques are arithmetic coding and Huffman coding
* Adaptive dictionary algorithms such as LZW – used in GIF and TIFF
* DEFLATE – used in PNG, MNG, and TIFF
* Chain codes

== Other properties ==
The best image quality at a given compression rate (or bit rate) is the main goal of image compression, however, there are other important properties of image compression schemes:

Scalability generally refers to a quality reduction achieved by manipulation of the bitstream or file (without decompression and re-compression). Other names for scalability are &quot;progressive coding&quot; or &quot;embedded bitstreams&quot;. Despite its contrary nature, scalability also may be found in lossless codecs, usually in form of coarse-to-fine pixel scans. Scalability is especially useful for previewing images while downloading them (e.g., in a web browser) or for providing variable quality access to e.g., databases. There are several types of scalability:

* Quality progressive or layer progressive: The bitstream successively refines the reconstructed image.
* Resolution progressive: First encode a lower image resolution; then encode the difference to higher resolutions.
* Component progressive: First encode grey-scale version; then adding full color.

Region of interest coding. Certain parts of the image are encoded with higher quality than others. This may be combined with scalability (encode these parts first, others later).

Meta information. Compressed data may contain information about the image which may be used to categorize, search, or browse images. Such information may include color and texture statistics, small preview images, and author or copyright information.

Processing power. Compression algorithms require different amounts of processing power to encode and decode. Some high compression algorithms require high processing power.

The quality of a compression method often is measured by the peak signal-to-noise ratio. It measures the amount of noise introduced through a lossy compression of the image, however, the subjective judgment of the viewer also is regarded as an important measure, perhaps, being the most important measure.

== History ==
Entropy coding started in the late 1940s with the introduction of Shannon–Fano coding, the basis for Huffman coding which was published in 1952. Transform coding dates back to the late 1960s, with the introduction of fast Fourier transform (FFT) coding in 1968 and the Hadamard transform in 1969.

An important development in image data compression was the discrete cosine transform (DCT), a lossy compression technique first proposed by Nasir Ahmed, T. Natarajan and K. R. Rao in 1973. JPEG was introduced by the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) in 1992. JPEG compresses images down to much smaller file sizes, and has become the most widely used image file format. JPEG was largely responsible for the wide proliferation of digital images and digital photos, with several billion JPEG images produced every day as of 2015.

Lempel–Ziv–Welch (LZW) is a lossless compression algorithm developed by Abraham Lempel, Jacob Ziv and Terry Welch in 1984. It is used in the GIF format, introduced in 1987. DEFLATE, a lossless compression algorithm developed by Phil Katz and specified in 1996, is used in the Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format.

The JPEG 2000 standard was developed from 1997 to 2000 by a JPEG committee chaired by Touradj Ebrahimi (later the JPEG president). In contrast to the DCT algorithm used by the original JPEG format, JPEG 2000 instead uses discrete wavelet transform (DWT) algorithms. It uses the CDF 9/7 wavelet transform (developed by Ingrid Daubechies in 1992) for its lossy compression algorithm, and the Le Gall–Tabatabai (LGT) 5/3 wavelet transform (developed by Didier Le Gall and Ali J. Tabatabai in 1988) for its lossless compression algorithm. JPEG 2000 technology, which includes the Motion JPEG 2000 extension, was selected as the video coding standard for digital cinema in 2004.

The evolution of image compression technologies has led to continuous improvements in both efficiency and quality. From the early developments in entropy coding and transform coding to the introduction of JPEG and JPEG 2000, these innovations have significantly impacted the way digital images are stored, transmitted, and processed. Modern compression methods allow users to optimize image files for faster loading times and better storage utilization, while maintaining high image quality. As compression technologies advance, these methods continue to play a crucial role in various fields, including web development, digital media, and content management.

== Huffman Coding ==
Huffman coding is a fundamental technique used in image compression algorithms to achieve efficient data representation. Named after its inventor David A. Huffman, this method is widely employed in various image compression standards such as JPEG and PNG.

=== Principle of Huffman Coding ===
Huffman coding is a form of entropy encoding that assigns variable-length codes to input symbols based on their frequencies of occurrence. The basic principle is to assign shorter codes to more frequently occurring symbols and longer codes to less frequent symbols, thereby reducing the average code length compared to fixed-length codes.

=== Application in Image Compression ===
In image compression, Huffman coding is typically applied after other transformations like Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) in the case of JPEG compression. After transforming the image data into a frequency domain representation, Huffman coding is used to encode the transformed coefficients efficiently.

=== Steps in Huffman Coding for Image Compression ===
# Frequency Analysis: Calculate the frequency of occurrence of each symbol or symbol combination in the transformed image data.
# Constructing the Huffman Tree: Build a Huffman tree based on the symbol frequencies. The tree is constructed recursively by combining the nodes with the lowest frequencies until a single root node is formed.
# Assigning Codewords: Traverse the Huffman tree to assign variable-length codewords to each symbol, with shorter codewords assigned to more frequent symbols.
# Encoding: Replace the original symbols in the image data with their corresponding Huffman codewords to generate the compressed data stream.

=== Benefits of Huffman Coding in Image Compression ===
* Lossless Compression: Huffman coding can be used in both lossy and lossless image compression techniques, providing flexibility in balancing between compression ratio and image quality.
* Efficiency: By assigning shorter codes to frequently occurring symbols, Huffman coding reduces the average code length, resulting in efficient data representation and reduced storage requirements.
* Compatibility: Huffman coding is widely supported and can be seamlessly integrated into existing image compression standards and algorithms.

=== Conclusion ===
Huffman coding plays a crucial role in image compression by efficiently encoding image data into a compact representation. Its ability to adaptively assign variable-length codewords based on symbol frequencies makes it an essential component in modern image compression techniques, contributing to the reduction of storage space and transmission bandwidth while maintaining image quality.

<text>Crop rotation is the practice of growing a series of different types of crops in the same area across a sequence of growing seasons. This practice reduces the reliance of crops on one set of nutrients, pest and weed pressure, along with the probability of developing resistant pests and weeds.

Growing the same crop in the same place for many years in a row, known as monocropping, gradually depletes the soil of certain nutrients and selects for both a highly competitive pest and weed community. Without balancing nutrient use and diversifying pest and weed communities, the productivity of monocultures is highly dependent on external inputs that may be harmful to the soil&#x27;s fertility. Conversely, a well-designed crop rotation can reduce the need for synthetic fertilizers and herbicides by better using ecosystem services from a diverse set of crops. Additionally, crop rotations can improve soil structure and organic matter, which reduces erosion and increases farm system resilience.

== History ==

Farmers have long recognized that suitable rotations such as planting spring crops for livestock in place of grains for human consumption make it possible to restore or to maintain productive soils. Ancient Near Eastern farmers practiced crop rotation in 6000 BC, alternately planting legumes and cereals.

=== Two-field systems ===

Under a two-field rotation, half the land was planted in a year, while the other half lay fallow. Then, in the next year, the two fields were reversed. In China both the two- and three-field systems had been used since the Eastern Zhou period. 

=== Three-field systems ===

From the 9th century to the 11th century, farmers in Europe transitioned from a two-field system to a three-field system. This system persisted until the 20th century. Available land was divided into three sections. One section was planted in the autumn with rye or winter wheat, followed by spring oats or barley; the second section grew crops such as one of the legumes, namely peas, lentils, or beans; and the third field was left fallow. The three fields were rotated in this manner so that every three years, one of the fields would rest and lie fallow. Under the two-field system, only half the land was planted in any year. Under the new three-field rotation system, two thirds of the land was planted, potentially yielding a larger harvest. But the additional crops had a more significant effect than mere quantitative productivity. Since the spring crops were mostly legumes, which fix nitrogen needed for plants to make proteins, they increased the overall nutrition of the people of Europe.

=== Four-field rotations ===


Farmers in the region of Waasland (in present-day northern Belgium) pioneered a four-field rotation in the early 16th century, and the British agriculturist Charles Townshend (1674–1738) popularised this system in the 18th century. The sequence of four crops (wheat, turnips, barley and clover), included a fodder crop and a grazing crop, allowing livestock to be bred year-round. The four-field crop rotation became a key development in the British Agricultural Revolution.

=== Modern developments ===

George Washington Carver (1860s–1943) studied crop-rotation methods in the United States, teaching southern farmers to rotate soil-depleting crops like cotton with soil-enriching crops like peanuts and peas.
In the Green Revolution of the mid-20th century, crop rotation gave way in the developed world to the practice of supplementing the chemical inputs to the soil through topdressing with fertilizers, adding (for example) ammonium nitrate or urea and restoring soil pH with lime. Such practices aimed to increase yields, to prepare soil for specialist crops, and to reduce waste and inefficiency by simplifying planting, harvesting, and irrigation.

== Crop choice ==

A preliminary assessment of crop interrelationships can be found in how each crop:

# Contributes to soil organic matter (SOM) content.
# Provides for pest management.
# Manages deficient or excess nutrients.
# Contributes to or controls for soil erosion.
# Interbreeds with other crops to produce hybrid offspring.
# Impacts surrounding food webs and field ecosystems.

Crop choice is often related to the goal the farmer is looking to achieve with the rotation, which could be weed management, increasing available nitrogen in the soil, controlling for erosion, or increasing soil structure and biomass, to name a few. When discussing crop rotations, crops are classified in different ways depending on what quality is being assessed: by family, by nutrient needs/benefits, and/or by profitability (i.e. cash crop versus cover crop). For example, giving adequate attention to plant family is essential to mitigating pests and pathogens. However, many farmers have success managing rotations by planning sequencing and cover crops around desirable cash crops. The following is a simplified classification based on crop quality and purpose.

=== Row crops ===

Many crops which are critical for the market, like vegetables, are row crops (that is, grown in tight rows). While often the most profitable for farmers, these crops are more taxing on the soil. Row crops typically have low biomass and shallow roots: this means the plant contributes low residue to the surrounding soil and has limited effects on structure. With much of the soil around the plant exposed to disruption by rainfall and traffic, fields with row crops experience faster break down of organic matter by microbes, leaving fewer nutrients for future plants.

In short, while these crops may be profitable for the farm, they are nutrient depleting. Crop rotation practices exist to strike a balance between short-term profitability and long-term productivity.

=== Legumes ===

A great advantage of crop rotation comes from the interrelationship of nitrogen-fixing crops with nitrogen-demanding crops. Legumes, like alfalfa and clover, collect available nitrogen from the atmosphere and store it in nodules on their root structure. When the plant is harvested, the biomass of uncollected roots breaks down, making the stored nitrogen available to future crops.

=== Grasses and cereals ===

Cereal and grasses are frequent cover crops because of the many advantages they supply to soil quality and structure. The dense and far-reaching root systems give ample structure to surrounding soil and provide significant biomass for soil organic matter.

Grasses and cereals are key in weed management as they compete with undesired plants for soil space and nutrients.

=== Green manure ===

Green manure is a crop that is mixed into the soil. Both nitrogen-fixing legumes and nutrient scavengers, like grasses, can be used as green manure. Green manure of legumes is an excellent source of nitrogen, especially for organic systems, however, legume biomass does not contribute to lasting soil organic matter like grasses do.

== Planning a rotation ==

There are numerous factors that must be taken into consideration when planning a crop rotation. Planning an effective rotation requires weighing fixed and fluctuating production circumstances: market, farm size, labor supply, climate, soil type, growing practices, etc. Moreover, a crop rotation must consider in what condition one crop will leave the soil for the succeeding crop and how one crop can be seeded with another crop. For example, a nitrogen-fixing crop, like a legume, should always precede a nitrogen depleting one; similarly, a low residue crop (i.e. a crop with low biomass) should be offset with a high biomass cover crop, like a mixture of grasses and legumes.

There is no limit to the number of crops that can be used in a rotation, or the amount of time a rotation takes to complete. Decisions about rotations are made years prior, seasons prior, or even at the last minute when an opportunity to increase profits or soil quality presents itself.

== Implementation ==

=== Relationship to other systems ===

Crop rotation systems may be enriched by other practices such as the addition of livestock and manure, and by growing more than one crop at a time in a field. A monoculture is a crop grown by itself in a field. A polyculture involves two or more crops growing in the same place at the same time. Crop rotations can be applied to both monocultures and polycultures, resulting in multiple ways of increasing agricultural biodiversity (table).

=== Incorporation of livestock ===

Introducing livestock makes the most efficient use of critical sod and cover crops; livestock (through manure) are able to distribute the nutrients in these crops throughout the soil rather than removing nutrients from the farm through the sale of hay.

Mixed farming or the practice of crop cultivation with the incorporation of livestock can help manage crops in a rotation and cycle nutrients. Crop residues provide animal feed, while the animals provide manure for replenishing crop nutrients and draft power. These processes promote internal nutrient cycling and minimize the need for synthetic fertilizers and large-scale machinery. As an additional benefit, the cattle, sheep and/or goat provide milk and can act as a cash crop in the times of economic hardship.

=== Polyculture ===

Polyculture systems, such as intercropping or companion planting, offer more diversity and complexity within the same season or rotation. An example is the Three Sisters, the inter-planting of corn with pole beans and vining squash or pumpkins. In this system, the beans provide nitrogen; the corn provides support for the beans and a &quot;screen&quot; against squash vine borer; the vining squash provides a weed suppressive canopy and a discouragement for corn-hungry raccoons.

Double-cropping is common where two crops, typically of different species, are grown sequentially in the same growing season, or where one crop (e.g. vegetable) is grown continuously with a cover crop (e.g. wheat). This is advantageous for small farms, which often cannot afford to leave cover crops to replenish the soil for extended periods of time, as larger farms can. When multiple cropping is implemented on small farms, these systems can maximize benefits of crop rotation on available land resources.

=== Organic farming ===

Crop rotation is a required practice, in the United States, for farms seeking organic certification. The “Crop Rotation Practice Standard” for the National Organic Program under the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, section §205.205, states that

In addition to lowering the need for inputs (by controlling for pests and weeds and increasing available nutrients), crop rotation helps organic growers increase the amount of biodiversity their farms. Biodiversity is also a requirement of organic certification, however, there are no rules in place to regulate or reinforce this standard. Increasing the biodiversity of crops has beneficial effects on the surrounding ecosystem and can host a greater diversity of fauna, insects, and beneficial microorganisms in the soil as found by McDaniel et al 2014 and Lori et al 2017. Some studies point to increased nutrient availability from crop rotation under organic systems compared to conventional practices as organic practices are less likely to inhibit of beneficial microbes in soil organic matter.

While multiple cropping and intercropping benefit from many of the same principals as crop rotation, they do not satisfy the requirement under the NOP.

== Benefits ==

Agronomists describe the benefits to yield in rotated crops as &quot;The Rotation Effect&quot;. There are many benefits of rotation systems. The factors related to the increase are broadly due to alleviation of the negative factors of monoculture cropping systems. Specifically, improved nutrition; pest, pathogen, and weed stress reduction; and improved soil structure have been found in some cases to be correlated to beneficial rotation effects.

Other benefits include reduced production cost. Overall financial risks are more widely distributed over more diverse production of crops and/or livestock. Less reliance is placed on purchased inputs and over time crops can maintain production goals with fewer inputs. This in tandem with greater short and long term yields makes rotation a powerful tool for improving agricultural systems.

=== Soil organic matter ===

The use of different species in rotation allows for increased soil organic matter (SOM), greater soil structure, and improvement of the chemical and biological soil environment for crops. With more SOM, water infiltration and retention improves, providing increased drought tolerance and decreased erosion.

Soil organic matter is a mix of decaying material from biomass with active microorganisms. Crop rotation, by nature, increases exposure to biomass from sod, green manure, and various other plant debris. The reduced need for intensive tillage under crop rotation allows biomass aggregation to lead to greater nutrient retention and utilization, decreasing the need for added nutrients. With tillage, disruption and oxidation of soil creates a less conducive environment for diversity and proliferation of microorganisms in the soil. These microorganisms are what make nutrients available to plants. So, where &quot;active&quot; soil organic matter is a key to productive soil, soil with low microbial activity provides significantly fewer nutrients to plants; this is true even though the quantity of biomass left in the soil may be the same.

Soil microorganisms also decrease pathogen and pest activity through competition. In addition, plants produce root exudates and other chemicals which manipulate their soil environment as well as their weed environment. Thus rotation allows increased yields from nutrient availability but also alleviation of allelopathy and competitive weed environments.

=== Carbon sequestration ===

Crop rotations greatly increase soil organic carbon (SOC) content, the main constituent of soil organic matter. Carbon, along with hydrogen and oxygen, is a macronutrient for plants. Highly diverse rotations spanning long periods of time have shown to be even more effective in increasing SOC, while soil disturbances (e.g. from tillage) are responsible for exponential decline in SOC levels. In Brazil, conversion to no-till methods combined with intensive crop rotations has been shown an SOC sequestration rate of 0.41 tonnes per hectare per year.

In addition to enhancing crop productivity, sequestration of atmospheric carbon has great implications in reducing rates of climate change by removing carbon dioxide from the air.

=== Nitrogen fixing===

Rotations can add nutrients to the soil. Legumes, plants of the family Fabaceae, have nodules on their roots which contain nitrogen-fixing bacteria called rhizobia. During a process called nodulation, the rhizobia bacteria use nutrients and water provided by the plant to convert atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia, which is then converted into an organic compound that the plant can use as its nitrogen source. It therefore makes good sense agriculturally to alternate them with cereals (family Poaceae) and other plants that require nitrates. How much nitrogen made available to the plants depends on factors such as the kind of legume, the effectiveness of rhizobia bacteria, soil conditions, and the availability of elements necessary for plant food.

=== Pathogen and pest control ===

Crop rotation is also used to control pests and diseases that can become established in the soil over time. The changing of crops in a sequence decreases the population level of pests by (1) interrupting pest life cycles and (2) interrupting pest habitat. Plants within the same taxonomic family tend to have similar pests and pathogens. By regularly changing crops and keeping the soil occupied by cover crops instead of lying fallow, pest cycles can be broken or limited, especially cycles that benefit from overwintering in residue. For example, root-knot nematode is a serious problem for some plants in warm climates and sandy soils, where it slowly builds up to high levels in the soil, and can severely damage plant productivity by cutting off circulation from the plant roots. Growing a crop that is not a host for root-knot nematode for one season greatly reduces the level of the nematode in the soil, thus making it possible to grow a susceptible crop the following season without needing soil fumigation.

This principle is of particular use in organic farming, where pest control must be achieved without synthetic pesticides.

=== Weed management ===

Integrating certain crops, especially cover crops, into crop rotations is of particular value to weed management. These crops crowd out weeds through competition. In addition, the sod and compost from cover crops and green manure slows the growth of what weeds are still able to make it through the soil, giving the crops further competitive advantage. By slowing the growth and proliferation of weeds while cover crops are cultivated, farmers greatly reduce the presence of weeds for future crops, including shallow rooted and row crops, which are less resistant to weeds. Cover crops are, therefore, considered conservation crops because they protect otherwise fallow land from becoming overrun with weeds.

This system has advantages over other common practices for weeds management, such as tillage. Tillage is meant to inhibit growth of weeds by overturning the soil; however, this has a countering effect of exposing weed seeds that may have gotten buried and burying valuable crop seeds. Under crop rotation, the number of viable seeds in the soil is reduced through the reduction of the weed population.

In addition to their negative impact on crop quality and yield, weeds can slow down the harvesting process. Weeds make farmers less efficient when harvesting, because weeds like bindweeds, and knotgrass, can become tangled in the equipment, resulting in a stop-and-go type of harvest.

=== Reducing soil erosion ===

Crop rotation can significantly reduce the amount of soil lost from erosion by water. In areas that are highly susceptible to erosion, farm management practices such as zero and reduced tillage can be supplemented with specific crop rotation methods to reduce raindrop impact, sediment detachment, sediment transport, surface runoff, and soil loss.

Protection against soil loss is maximized with rotation methods that leave the greatest mass of crop stubble (plant residue left after harvest) on top of the soil. Stubble cover in contact with the soil minimizes erosion from water by reducing overland flow velocity, stream power, and thus the ability of the water to detach and transport sediment. Soil erosion and seal prevent the disruption and detachment of soil aggregates that cause macropores to block, infiltration to decline, and runoff to increase. This significantly improves the resilience of soils when subjected to periods of erosion and stress.

When a forage crop breaks down, binding products are formed that act like an adhesive on the soil, which makes particles stick together, and form aggregates. The formation of soil aggregates is important for erosion control, as they are better able to resist raindrop impact, and water erosion. Soil aggregates also reduce wind erosion, because they are larger particles, and are more resistant to abrasion through tillage practices.

The effect of crop rotation on erosion control varies by climate. In regions under relatively consistent climate conditions, where annual rainfall and temperature levels are assumed, rigid crop rotations can produce sufficient plant growth and soil cover. In regions where climate conditions are less predictable, and unexpected periods of rain and drought may occur, a more flexible approach for soil cover by crop rotation is necessary. An opportunity cropping system promotes adequate soil cover under these erratic climate conditions. In an opportunity cropping system, crops are grown when soil water is adequate and there is a reliable sowing window. This form of cropping system is likely to produce better soil cover than a rigid crop rotation because crops are only sown under optimal conditions, whereas rigid systems are not necessarily sown in the best conditions available.

Crop rotations also affect the timing and length of when a field is subject to fallow. This is very important because depending on a particular region&#x27;s climate, a field could be the most vulnerable to erosion when it is under fallow. Efficient fallow management is an essential part of reducing erosion in a crop rotation system. Zero tillage is a fundamental management practice that promotes crop stubble retention under longer unplanned fallows when crops cannot be planted. Such management practices that succeed in retaining suitable soil cover in areas under fallow will ultimately reduce soil loss. In a recent study that lasted a decade, it was found that a common winter cover crop after potato harvest such as fall rye can reduce soil run-off by as much as 43%, and this is typically the most nutritional soil.

=== Biodiversity ===

Increasing the biodiversity of crops has beneficial effects on the surrounding ecosystem and can host a greater diversity of fauna, insects, and beneficial microorganisms in the soil as found by McDaniel et al 2014 and Lori et al 2017. Some studies point to increased nutrient availability from crop rotation under organic systems compared to conventional practices as organic practices are less likely to inhibit of beneficial microbes in soil organic matter, such as arbuscular mycorrhizae, which increase nutrient uptake in plants. Increasing biodiversity also increases the resilience of agro-ecological systems.

=== Farm productivity ===

Crop rotation contributes to increased yields through improved soil nutrition. By requiring planting and harvesting of different crops at different times, more land can be farmed with the same amount of machinery and labour.

=== Risk management ===

Different crops in the rotation can reduce the risks of adverse weather for the individual farmer.

== Challenges ==

While crop rotation requires a great deal of planning, crop choice must respond to a number of fixed conditions (soil type, topography, climate, and irrigation) in addition to conditions that may change dramatically from year to the next (weather, market, labor supply). In this way, it is unwise to plan crops years in advance. Improper implementation of a crop rotation plan may lead to imbalances in the soil nutrient composition or a buildup of pathogens affecting a critical crop. The consequences of faulty rotation may take years to become apparent even to experienced soil scientists and can take just as long to correct.

Many challenges exist within the practices associated with crop rotation. For example, green manure from legumes can lead to an invasion of snails or slugs and the decay from green manure can occasionally suppress the growth of other crops.

<text>Drawn butter is melted butter, often served as a sauce for steamed seafood. Some cooks restrict the term to clarified butter, while others insist that it should not be clarified.

When it is served with seafood, diners often add lemon juice to it.

==Drawn butter sauces==
In the 18th century, a small amount of flour and water or milk was often added to melted butter to thicken it and prevent it from separating. Later in the 19th century, increasing amounts of flour and water were used. These sauces may themselves be named simply &quot;melted butter&quot;, &quot;drawn butter&quot;, or &quot;drawn butter sauce&quot;, and flavored with vinegar, salt, pepper, capers, watercress, and so on.

<text>Fish sauce is a liquid condiment made from fish or krill that have been coated in salt and fermented for up to two years. It is used as a staple seasoning in East Asian cuisine and Southeast Asian cuisine, particularly Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam. Some garum-related fish sauces have been used in the West since the Roman times.

Due to its ability to add a savory flavor to dishes, it has been embraced globally by chefs and home cooks. The umami flavor in fish sauce is due to its glutamate content.

Fish sauce is used as a seasoning during or after cooking, and as a base in dipping sauces. Soy sauce is regarded by some in the West as a vegetarian alternative to fish sauce though they are very different in flavor.

== History ==

=== Asia ===
Sauces that included fermented fish parts with other ingredients such as meat and soy bean were recorded in China, 2300 years ago. During the Zhou dynasty of ancient China, fish fermented with soybeans and salt was used as a condiment. By the time of the Han dynasty, soy beans were fermented without the fish into soy paste and its by-product soy sauce, with fermented fish-based sauces developing separately into fish sauce. A fish sauce, called &quot;kôechiap&quot; in Hokkien Chinese, might be the precursor of ketchup.

By 50-100 BC, demand for fish sauces and fish pastes in China had fallen drastically, with fermented bean products becoming a major trade commodity. Fish sauce, however, developed massive popularity in Southeast Asia. Food scholars traditionally divide East Asia into two distinct condiment regions, separated by a bean-fish divide: Southeast Asia, mainly using fermented fish (Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia), and Northeast Asia, using mainly fermented beans (China, Korea, Japan). Fish sauce re-entered China in the 17th and 18th centuries, brought from Vietnam and Cambodia by Chinese traders up the coast of the southern provinces Guangdong and Fujian.

=== Europe ===
Fish sauces were widely used in ancient Mediterranean cuisine. The earliest recorded production was between 4th–3rd century BC by the Ancient Greeks, who fermented scraps of fish called &quot;garos&quot; into one. It is believed to have been made with a lower salt content than modern fish sauces.

The Romans made a similar condiment called either garum or liquamen. According to Pliny the Elder, &quot;garum consists of the guts of fish and other parts that would otherwise be considered refuse so that garum is really the liquor from putrefaction.&quot; Garum was made in the Roman outposts of Spain almost exclusively from mackerel by salting the scrap fish innards, and then sun fermenting the flesh until it fell apart, usually for several months. The brown liquid would then be strained, bottled, and sold as a condiment. Remains of Roman fish salting facilities can still be seen, including in Algeciras in Spain and near Setúbal in Portugal. The process lasted until the 16th century when garum makers switched to anchovy and removed the innards.

Garum was ubiquitous in Classical Roman cooking. Mixed with wine it was known as &quot;oenogarum&quot;, or with vinegar, &quot;oxygarum&quot;, or mixed with honey, &quot;meligarum&quot;. &quot;Garum&quot; was one of the trade specialties in Hispania Baetica. &quot;Garum&quot; was frequently maligned as smelling bad or rotten, being called, for example, &quot;evil-smelling fish sauce&quot; and is said to be similar to modern &quot;colatura di alici&quot;, a fish sauce used in Neapolitan cuisine.

In English &quot;garum&quot; was formerly translated as &quot;fish pickle&quot;. The original Worcestershire sauce is a related product because it is fermented and contains anchovies.

== Difference from oyster sauce ==
While fish sauce and oyster sauce are both briny and may have related histories, they are different products. Fish sauce is watery, clear, and salty, whereas oyster sauce is made by reducing oyster extracts and therefore sweeter with a hint of salt and not as strong an aroma as fish sauce.

==Ingredients and manufacture==

Fish sauces historically have been prepared from different species of fish and shellfish, and from using the whole fish, or by using just fish blood or viscera. Most modern fish sauces contain only fish and salt, usually made from anchovy, shrimp, mackerel, or other strong-flavored, high oil fish. Some variants add herbs and spices. For modern fish sauces, fish or shellfish are mixed with salt at a concentration of 10% to 30%. It is then sealed in a closed container for up to two years.

Once the original draft has been made, some fish sauces will be produced through a re-extraction of the fish mass via boiling. To improve the visual appearance and add taste, second-pass fish sauces often have added caramel, molasses, or roasted rice. They are thinner, and less costly. Some volume manufacturers of fish sauce will also water down a first-press to manufacture more products.

Fish sauce that has been only briefly fermented has a pronounced fishy taste. Extended fermentation reduces this and gives the product a nuttier, richer and more savory flavor. An anonymous article, &quot;Neuc-num&quot;, in Diderot and d&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s 18th-century Encyclopédie, states: &quot;It is said that Europeans become accustomed enough to this type of sauce&quot;.

== Regional variations ==

=== Southeast Asia ===
Southeast Asian fish sauce is often made from anchovies, salt, and water, and is intensely flavoured. Anchovies and salt are arranged in wooden barrels to ferment and are slowly pressed, yielding the salty, fishy liquid. The salt extracts the liquid via osmosis.

Southeast Asians generally use fish sauce as a cooking sauce. However, there is a sweet and sour version of this sauce which is used more commonly as a dipping sauce.

====Myanmar ====
Fish sauce in Myanmar is called &quot;ngan bya yay&quot; (ငါးငံပြာရည်). It&#x27;s often a by-product of Hmyin ngapi(မျှင်ငပိ)(Burmese Fish Paste made from small fish)

====Cambodia====
In Cambodia, fish sauce is called &quot;tik trei&quot; (, ). Just like &quot;prahok&quot;, it is believed to date back to the pre-Angkorean era. Industrially fish sauce is produced by mixing &quot;trei aing keuy&quot; or anchovies with coarse salt and fermenting it in large wooden vats. Over the period of six to eight months, it is distilled five times, before being transferred into jars and sun-fermented for the final 2–3 months. The most famous fish sauce is produced in the Kampot Province. Food Production Company of Kampot produces a speciality fish sauce containing roe. Fish sauce is mixed with sugar, lime juice, chili peppers and crushed roasted peanuts to create sweet fish sauce, which is the most popular dipping sauce in Cambodia.

====Laos====
In Lao/Isan, it is called &quot;nam pa&quot; (). A chunkier, more aromatic version known as &quot;padaek&quot; is also used.

==== Philippines ====

The Philippine fish sauce is known as &quot;patis&quot;. It is one of the most important ingredients in Filipino cuisine. &quot;Patis&quot; is a by-product of &quot;bagoong&quot; production, which include &quot;bagoong isda&quot; (fermented fish) and &quot;bagoong alamang&quot; (fermented krill), as well as the rarer &quot;bagoong macabebe&quot; (fermented oysters) and &quot;bagoong sisi&quot; (fermented clams). The fish used are typically small like sardines, anchovies, ambassids, and the fry of larger fish. Unlike other fish sauce variants, the fermented solids are not discarded but are sold as separate products. The &quot;patis&quot; is skimmed from the upper layers of fermenting &quot;bagoong&quot; and is not pressed. As such, &quot;patis&quot; usually takes longer to produce than other types of fish sauce as it is reliant on the readiness of &quot;bagoong&quot;.

&quot;Patis&quot; is nearly always cooked prior to consumption, even when used as an accent to salads or other raw dishes. &quot;Patis&quot; is also used as an ingredient in cooked dishes, including a rice porridge called &quot;arroz caldo&quot;, as a condiment for fried fish or an umami accent in a common dish, &quot;sinigang&quot;. &quot;Patis&quot; is also used in place of table salt in meals to enhance the flavor of the food, where it can either be dashed from a dispensing bottle onto the food, or poured into a saucer and mixed with calamansi and labuyo chilis and used as a dipping sauce.

==== Thailand ====
Fish sauce in Thailand is called &quot;nam pla&quot; (). In Isan, it is called &quot;nam pa&quot;. Similar to the Laotian &quot;padaek&quot; is &quot;pla ra&quot; (), also used in Thai cuisine. In Thailand, fish sauce is used both in cooking and also served at the table as a condiment, for instance in noodle soups. Nearly every Thai meal is served with &quot;phrik nam pla&quot; as a condiment: a mixture of fish sauce, lime juice, and chopped bird&#x27;s eye chilies. Sliced garlic is often added to this sauce.

Historically, there were two types of fish sauce made in Thailand: that made with a fresh-water fish, &quot;pla soi&quot;, and sauce made from a salt-water fish, &quot;pla kratak&quot;. Either fish is fermented for at least eight months, three parts fish to two parts salt. The resulting mash is filtered. This yields the best fish sauce called the &quot;base&quot;. The dregs are then mixed with water and salt and again fermented for three to four months. This yields a second-grade fish sauce, mostly used in cooking.

In 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned the import of Thai fish sauces due to a lack of information about tests for botulinum toxin. The toxin can cause death if more than 0.5 micrograms are consumed. The Thai Office of Food Safety and Quality then tested 48 brands of fish sauce to determine the content of botulinum toxin in the products. Of 48 brands tested, 28 were genuine fish sauces from 18 production sites in 12 provinces. Twenty samples from production sites in eight provinces were adulterated fish sauce. Tests showed that none were contaminated with botulinum toxin types A, B, E, and F and were free of &quot;Clostridium botulinum&quot; bacteria. In 2018, rumours again surfaced concerning banned Thai fish sauce.

==== Vietnam ====

The variety from Vietnam is called &quot;nước mắm&quot;. There are two areas in Vietnam that are most famous for producing fish sauce: Phú Quốc and Phan Thiết.

Fish sauce has a 300-year history dating back to the Champa kingdom of the Cham people. Phan Thiết can be identified with the birthplace of Vietnamese fish sauce. Before 1693, Phan Thiết was a territory of Champa. The Vietnamese occupied the area in 1693 and commercialized the fish sauce by keeping it in barrels and selling throughout the country. This business was popularized by Trần Gia Hòa who was born in 1872. There is a fish sauce museum in Phan Thiết. Popular brands in the US include Mega Chef, Red Boat, 3 Crabs, Golden Boy, and Hòn Phan Thiết.

Vietnamese fish sauces are made with anchovies, mackerel, scabbard fish, and salt. High mercury concentration can be found in larger fish, especially in predator fish like scabbard fish. They do not have any additives like sugar, hydrolyzed protein, or preservatives. Vietnamese prefer sauces without a strong smell, and transparent with a deep golden amber color. &quot;First press&quot; fish sauce, meaning the sauce is bottled from the first time the fermenting barrels are drained, also indicates quality. Lastly, when measuring the nitrogen level of fish sauces (°N, or grams of nitrogen per liter), most fish sauce on the market falls within the mid 20°N range. Anything over 30°N is considered high-grade, and 40°N is optimal.

&quot;Nước chấm&quot; is a Vietnamese prepared fish-based condiment (also referred to as a &quot;sauce&quot;) that is savory, lightly sweet and salty tasting, and can be sour and spicy if lime and chili peppers are added. The main components are fish sauce, water, and sugar.

&quot;Mắm&quot; is made much like fish sauce, except that it is not fermented as long, and the fish is kept along with its liquid extract, not just the extract. &quot;Mắm&quot; can be used as a base condiment in dipping sauces with additional ingredients, used in soups, stir-fries and meat loaves, or eaten with rice as a main dish.

In January 2016, the Institute of Food Technologists published a study asserting that using Vietnamese fish sauce as a substitute for sodium chloride (salt) in chicken broth, tomato sauce, and coconut curry reduced the amount of sodium chloride by 10 to 25 percent while still maintaining the perceived deliciousness, saltiness, and overall flavor intensity. This idea is similar to the use of umami flavor enhancers such as MSG to increase flavor intensity and reduce sodium requirement.

According to the General Statistics Office, in 2020, the output of fish sauce reached nearly 380 million liters. According to the Vietnam Fish Sauce Association, the output of fish sauce in 2023 is expected to reach about 420 million liters. The reason for this growth is due to the increasing domestic demand and the strong development of the fish sauce export industry. Vietnamese fish sauce is currently exported to more than 60 countries and territories around the world. According to statistics, Vietnam currently has 783 fish sauce production facilities with 1,500 participating farming households, producing about 250 million liters of fish sauce per year. Of which, 35 facilities produce fish sauce for export to 20 markets.

=== East Asia ===

==== China ====
In China, fish sauce is called &quot;yúlù&quot; (, literally &quot;fish dew&quot;) and is native to the provinces of Guangdong and Fujian. In Chaoshan cuisine, fish sauce is made with Reeve&#x27;s shad (&quot;Tenualosa reevesii&quot;), which is unsuitable for direct eating due to being fatty, bony, and odorous.

==== Japan ====
In Japan, fish sauce is called &quot;gyoshō&quot; (魚醤); another name is &quot;uoshōyu&quot; (魚醤油). There are several variations used in regional cuisines. &quot;Ishiru&quot; in the Noto Peninsula is made from sardine and squid. Shottsuru, the best-known type of Japanese fish sauce and often used as a synonym for all &quot;gyoshō&quot;, is from Akita Prefecture and is mainly made from sailfin sandfish. &quot;Ikanago shoyu&quot; of Kagawa Prefecture is made from sand lance. They are used in &quot;nabemono&quot;, in salad dressings, and as a flavoring ingredient in ramen soups. Imported Thai / Vietnamese fish sauce in Japan is referred to as &quot;nanpurā&quot; (ナンプラー), from the Thai word for fish sauce &quot;nam pla&quot;.
==== Korea ====
In Korea, fish sauce is called &quot;eojang&quot; ().

Across the Korean Peninsula, &quot;aekjeot&quot; (, literally &quot;liquid &quot;jeotgal&quot;&quot;), a type of fish sauce usually made from fermented anchovies or &quot;kkanari&quot;(pacific sand lances), is used as a crucial ingredient in many types of kimchi, both for taste and fermentation.

In Jeju island, &quot;eoganjang&quot; (), made of fermented &quot;godori&quot; (young chub mackerel) or horse mackerel, is used in place of soy sauce.

=== Europe ===

==== Italy ====
&quot;Colatura di alici&quot; is an Italian fish sauce originating in the village of Cetara, Campania.

==== England ====
Worcestershire sauce contains fermented anchovies among other ingredients, which is common in the Anglosphere countries.

==Nutrition contents==
Common commercial brands of fish sauce generally contain about 50% to 60% of the FDA&#x27;s daily recommended amount of sodium per tablespoon serving. Most commercial brands of reasonable quality contain one or two grams of protein per serving; however, higher-quality brands may have four grams of protein or more, while lower-quality brands may have less than one gram of protein per serving. Fish sauce has an insignificant amount of carbohydrates and fats. Vitamin B12, vitamin B-6, and magnesium are present in small amounts.

<doc id="46484" wikidata="Q618345" url="?curid=46484" title="Apple sauce">
<text>Apple sauce is a purée (not necessarily served as a true sauce) made of apples. It can be made with peeled or unpeeled apples and can be spiced or sweetened. Apple sauce is inexpensive and is widely consumed in North America and some parts of Europe.

A wide range of apple varieties are used to make apple sauce, depending on the preference for sweetness or tartness. Formerly, sour apples were usually used to make savory apple sauce.

Commercial versions of apple sauce are readily available at supermarkets and other retail outlets.

==Preparation==
Apple sauce is made by cooking apples with water or apple cider (fresh apple juice). More acidic apples will render a finer purée; the highly acidic Bramley apple creates a very fine purée. The apples may or may not be peeled. If they are not peeled, the peels and seeds are typically separated in a food mill. Sugar and spices such as cinnamon, allspice, and even Red Hot candies may be added for flavor. Lemon juice, citric acid, or other acidifiers may be used to preserve the color and ensure a high enough acidity for safe storage. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) also preserves the color.

Apple sauce can be made by baking rather than boiling, in which case the apples are peeled and cored before cooking. The same process is applied when preparing the sauce in a slow cooker.

Home or commercially canned apple sauce is sterilized by heat to preserve freshness. 

===Apple butter===

Apple butter is a highly concentrated version of apple sauce. Its high concentration of sugar gives it a long shelf life.

==Uses==
Apple sauce is served as a side dish in northern Europe and North America. In the United States, packaged apple sauce is primarily branded as a children&#x27;s snack, and is ubiquitous in school cafeterias. In American cuisine, it is commonly served as pork chops and apple sauce.

American-style apple sauce is not widely available in Britain. An apple preserve, containing chopped, not puréed apples, is sold as &quot;apple sauce.&quot; In the UK it is typically sold under the name apple purée and as baby food.

In Sweden and Britain, it is commonly served with roast pork and goose. The Danish æbleflæsk combines the pork with apple sauce while cooking it.
In Central Europe it accompanies potato pancakes, in the Rhineland it is served with Reibekuchen. In Ashkenazi cuisine, it is the standard accompaniment for Hanukkah latkes. It also accompanies matzah brei.
Apple sauce is served with many foods in Germanic cuisine: Flurgönder (a smoked brawn), various kinds of Spätzle, Schupfnudeln, Swiss Älplermagronen, a kind of macaroni and cheese. In Netherlands and Belgian cuisine, apple sauce is part of the common dish of chicken, french fries, and apple sauce (&quot;kip, frieten/patat en appelmoes&quot;). It is especially popular among children, who dip their fries in apple sauce.

In many cuisines, apple sauce is a common accompaniment to blood sausage: the German Himmel und Erde; the Luxembourgish träipen and the French &quot;boudin noir&quot;. In fact the only French savory dish normally served with apple sauce (&quot;compote de pommes&quot;) is &quot;boudin&quot; sausage. It is also served with other sausage-like preparations, for example goetta and knipp.

Apple sauce may also be served as a dessert in most European cuisines, or used as an ingredient in applesauce cake. Apple sauce may be used as a sauce for Polish pierogi, Swedish Äggakaka, Ukrainian syrniki pancakes, Central European Palatschinken, Austrian Kaiserschmarrn and various kinds of sweet and savory dumplings (Knödel). In Scandinavian cuisine, it is sometimes served with breakfast filmjölk, a kind of fermented milk.

Formerly heavily sweetened and boiled-down apple sauce was prepared for winter storage. Made with sour apples, it was eaten with meat; made with sweet apples, it was eaten with tea.

In some recipes for baked goods, apple sauce can be used as a substitute for fat or eggs to make them low-fat or vegan.
Bavarian sweet mustard may be made with apple sauce, and is typically served with Weißwurst (similar to &quot;boudin blanc&quot;) or Leberkäse (a sort of pâté).

==Nutritional information==
According to the USDA, a reference amount of unsweetened applesauce is 82% water, 18% carbohydrates, and contains negligible fat and protein, while supplying of food energy. It has an acidic pH between 3.3 and 3.6.

===In therapeutic diets===
The BRAT diet and the CRAM diet, which are given to children with diarrhea and stomach problems, include apple sauce.

==Economy==
Apples are the third most internationally traded fruit, behind bananas and grapes. The global applesauce trade is expanding, with a market valued at US$1.611 billion in 2017 projected to reach US$2.169 billion by the end of the year 2026. This increase in demand can be attributed to an increase in interest for apple flavored products, with increased global consumption of apple flavored juices and sauces.

Applesauce is most commonly packaged in cups, jars, pouches, and cans. Applesauce cups are the largest segment of the applesauce market, comprising 40.9% of the revenue share in 2017.

Brick-and-mortar retail stores account for about 85% of the market share for applesauce, as compared to 15% among e-retailers.

==Origins==

Sauces made with apples date to at least the Middle Ages.

Apple butters were brought to the Americas by German immigrants such as the Moravians and Pennsylvania Dutch. They are traditionally associated with the Appalachian region of the United States and Southern Pennsylvania.

<doc id="46489" wikidata="Q466087" url="?curid=46489" title="Convention on the Rights of the Child">
<text>The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (commonly abbreviated as the CRC or UNCRC) is an international human rights treaty which sets out the civil, political, economic, social, health and cultural rights of children. The convention defines a child as any human being under the age of eighteen, unless the age of majority is attained earlier under national legislation.

Nations that have ratified this convention or have acceded to it are bound by international law. When a state has signed the treaty but not ratified it, it is not yet bound by the treaty&#x27;s provisions but is already obliged to not act contrary to its purpose.

The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, composed of eighteen independent experts, is responsible for supervising the implementation of the convention by the states that have ratified it. Their governments are required to report to and appear before the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child periodically to be examined on their progress regarding the advancement of the implementation of the convention and the status of child rights in their country. Their reports and the committee&#x27;s written views and concerns are available on the committee&#x27;s website.

Individuals can appeal to the Committee on the Rights of the Child if they believe that rights, according to the convention, have been violated. The third possibility for monitoring the implementation of the convention is inquiries that the Committee on the Rights of the Child can carry out on their own initiative if they have reliable information that leads them to believe that a member state has violated the convention&#x27;s rights. However, &quot;states ... may opt-out from the inquiry procedure, at the time of signature or ratification or accession&quot;. Once a year, the committee submits a report to the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, which also hears a statement from the CRC Chair, and the Assembly adopts a Resolution on the Rights of the Child.

The UN General Assembly adopted the convention and opened it for signature on 20 November 1989 (the 30th anniversary of its Declaration of the Rights of the Child). It came into force on 2 September 1990, after it was ratified by the required number of nations. As of , 196 countries are party to it, including every member of the United Nations except the United States.

Two optional protocols were adopted on 25 May 2000. The First Optional Protocol restricts the involvement of children in military conflicts, and the Second Optional Protocol prohibits the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography. More than 170 states have ratified both protocols. A third optional protocol relating to communication of complaints was adopted in December 2011 and opened for signature on 28 February 2012. It came into effect on 14 April 2014.

==Contents==

The convention deals with child-specific needs and rights. It requires that the &quot;nations that ratify this convention are bound to it by international law.&quot; Ratifying states must act in the best interests of the child.

In all jurisdictions implementing the convention requires compliance with child custody and guardianship laws as every child has basic rights, including the right to life, to their own name and identity, to be raised by their parents within a family or cultural grouping, and to have a relationship with both parents, even if they are separated.

The convention obliges states to allow parents to exercise their parental responsibilities. The convention also acknowledges that children have the right to express their opinions and to have those opinions heard and acted upon when appropriate, to be protected from abuse or exploitation, and to have their privacy protected. It requires that their lives not be subject to excessive interference.

The convention also obliges signatory states to separate legal representation for a child in any judicial dispute concerning their care and asks that the child&#x27;s viewpoint be heard in such cases.

The convention forbids capital punishment for children. In its General Comment 8 (2006) the committee stated that there was an &quot;obligation of all state parties to move quickly to prohibit and eliminate all corporal punishment and all other cruel or degrading forms of punishment of children&quot;. Article 19 of the convention states that state parties must &quot;take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence&quot;, but it makes no reference to corporal punishment. The committee&#x27;s interpretation of this section to encompass a prohibition on corporal punishment has been rejected by several state parties to the convention, including Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom.

The European Court of Human Rights has referred to the convention when interpreting the European Convention on Human Rights.

===Global standards and cultural relativism===
Global human rights standards were challenged at the World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna (1993) when a number of governments (prominently China, Indonesia, Malaysia and Iran) raised serious objections to the idea of universal human rights. There are unresolved tensions between &quot;universalistic&quot; and &quot;relativistic&quot; approaches in the establishment of standards and strategies designed to prevent or overcome the abuse of children&#x27;s capacity to work.

===Child marriage and slavery===
Some scholars link child marriages to slavery and slavery-like practices. Child marriage as slavery is not directly addressed by the convention.

==States party and signatories==
The term &quot;party&quot; refers to a State that gives its explicit consent to be bound by the treaty.   

As of 12 July 2022, 196 countries are parties to the UNCRC treaty (some with stated reservations or interpretations). Every member of the United Nations except the United States has either ratified or accepted the rights articulated for the child under eighteen or below the age of majority in that state. The most recent ratifications of the convention were by Cook Islands, Niue, the State of Palestine, and the Holy See. South Sudan ratified the convention in January 2015. Somalia&#x27;s domestic ratification finished in January 2015 and the instrument was deposited with the United Nations in October 2015. Taiwan incorporated the convention into domestic law on 20 November 2014, and signed an Instrument of Accession to the CRC on 16 May 2016.

All successor states of Czechoslovakia (Czech Republic and Slovakia) and Yugoslavia (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Slovenia) made declarations of succession to the treaty and currently apply it.

The convention does not apply in the territories of Tokelau, Akrotiri and Dhekelia and Gibraltar. Guernsey was also excluded until 2020.

=== Azerbaijan ===
Azerbaijan ratified the convention on 21 July 1992. In terms of the ratification of the convention, a significant number of laws, decrees and resolutions were approved in Azerbaijan by the President and the Cabinet of Ministers focusing on the development of the child welfare system. In this regard, the Convention No. 182 of the International Labour Organization, i.e. the Convention on the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour, the Recommendation No. 190 of the International Labour Organization and the Hague Adoption Convention were ratified by Milli Majlis, the parliament of Azerbaijan, in 2004.

There is a concern over the administration of juvenile justice in Azerbaijan, mostly regarding compliance with articles 37, 39, and 40 of the convention, as well as other relevant standards such as the Beijing Rules, the Riyadh Guidelines, and the United Nations Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty. Therefore, international organizations assisted Azerbaijan to improve the situation in the field of juvenile justice. Juvenile offenders have been added to the Presidential pardons on a regular basis.

Azerbaijan has built cooperation with many international organizations, particularly with UNICEF in child protection. In 1993, UNICEF began its activity in Azerbaijan. In 2005, Azerbaijan and UNICEF signed a five-year country program. The country program for 2005-2009 was implemented in child protection, children&#x27;s health and nutrition, children&#x27;s education and youth health, and their development and participation. Also, UNICEF supports Azerbaijan in improving its juvenile justice system, establishing an alternative care system and raising awareness among youth about HIV/AIDS.

=== Canada ===
Canada became a signatory to the convention on 28 May 1990 and ratified in 1991. Youth criminal laws in Canada underwent major changes resulting in the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA) which went into effect on 1 April 2003. The Act specifically refers to Canada&#x27;s different commitments under the convention. The convention was influential in the administrative law decision of &quot;Baker v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)&quot;, although the Supreme Court of Canada ultimately held that &quot;Its provisions [...] have no direct application within Canadian law&quot;.

=== India ===
India ratified UNCRC on 11 December 1992, agreeing in principle to all articles but with certain reservations on issues relating to child labor. In India, there is a law that children under the age of 18 should not work, but there is no outright ban on child labor. The practice is generally permitted in most industries except those deemed &quot;hazardous&quot;, for which minimum ages apply. Although a law in October 2006 banned child labor in hotels, restaurants, and as domestic servants, there continues to be a high demand for children as hired help in the home. There are different estimates as to the number of child laborers in the country. According to the government&#x27;s conservative estimate, in 2011 4.4 million children under 14 years of age were working in India, while the NGO Save the Children in a statement of 2016 cites a study by the Campaign Against Child Labour that estimates the number of child laborers in India at 12.7 million.

In 2016, the Child and Adolescent Labour (Amendment) Act was introduced, which prohibited children&#x27;s economic employment under the age of 14 years and the employment of adolescents (14–17 years of age) in hazardous occupations. Some exceptions exist for children under 14 —they can aid in the family enterprise and participate in the entertainment industry. It must not harm their school education and they must not work between 7 p.m. and 8 a.m.

===Iran===

Iran has adhered to the convention (except for alleged child slavery) since 1991 and ratified it in the Parliament in 1994. Upon ratification, Iran made the following reservation: &quot;If the text of the Convention is or becomes incompatible with the domestic laws and Islamic standards at any time or in any case, the Government of the Islamic Republic shall not abide by it.&quot; Iran has also signed both optional protocols which relate to the special protection of children against involvement in armed conflict and the sale of children and sexual exploitation.

Although Iran is a state party to the convention, international human rights organisations and foreign governments routinely denounced executions of Iranian child offenders as a violation of the treaty. But on 10 February 2012, Iran&#x27;s parliament changed the controversial law of executing juveniles. In the new law, the age of 18 (solar year) would be considered the minimum age for adulthood and offenders under this age will be sentenced under a separate law. Based on the previous law, which was revised, girls at the age of 9 and boys at 15 (lunar year, 11 days shorter than a solar year) were fully responsible for their crimes.

&quot;According to Islamic sources, the criterion for criminal responsibility is reaching the age of maturity which, according to the Shi&#x27;ite School of the IRI, is 9 lunar years (8 years and 9 months) for girls and 15 lunar years (14 years and 7 months) for boys.&quot;

===Ireland===
Ireland signed the convention on 30 September 1990 and ratified it, without reservation, on 28 September 1992. In response to criticisms expressed in the 1998 review by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child in Geneva, the Irish government established the office of Ombudsman for Children. It drew up a national children&#x27;s strategy. In 2006, following concerns expressed by the committee that the wording of the Irish Constitution does not allow the State to intervene in abuse cases other than in very exceptional cases, the Irish government undertook to amend the constitution to make a more explicit commitment to children&#x27;s rights.

===Israel===
Israel ratified the convention in 1991. In 2010, UNICEF criticized the country for its failure to create a government-appointed commission on children&#x27;s rights or adopt a national children&#x27;s rights strategy or program to implement various Israeli laws addressing children&#x27;s rights. The report criticizes Israel for holding that the convention does not apply in the West Bank and for defining Palestinians under the age of 16 in the occupied territories as children, even though Israeli law defines a child as being under 18, in line with the convention. A contemporaneous report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development found that Israel&#x27;s investment in children is below the international average. The actual investment had fallen between 1995 and 2006. In 2012, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child criticized Israel for its bombing attacks on Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, stating, &quot;Destruction of homes and damage to schools, streets and other public facilities gravely affect children&quot; and called them &quot;gross violations of the convention on the Rights of the Child, its Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict and international humanitarian law&quot;. It also criticized Palestinian rocket attacks from Gaza on southern Israel, which traumatized Israeli children, calling on all parties to protect children.

===New Zealand===
New Zealand ratified the convention on 6 April 1993 with reservations concerning the right to distinguish between persons according to the nature of their authority to be in New Zealand, the need for legislative action on economic exploitation—which it argued was adequately protected by existing law, and the provisions for the separation of juvenile offenders from adult offenders.

In 1994, the Court of Appeal of New Zealand dismissed the suggestion that the Minister for Immigration and his department were at liberty to ignore the convention, arguing that this would imply that the country&#x27;s adherence was &quot;at least partly window-dressing&quot;.

The Children&#x27;s Commissioner Act 2003 enhanced the Office of the Children&#x27;s Commissioner (OCC), giving it significantly stronger investigative powers. The OCC is responsible for convening the UNCROC Monitoring Group, which monitors the New Zealand Government&#x27;s implementation of the Children&#x27;s Convention, its Optional Protocols and the Government&#x27;s response to recommendations from the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child. The monitoring group comprises members from the Human Rights Commission (New Zealand), UNICEF New Zealand, Action for Children and Youth Aotearoa and Save the Children New Zealand.

In May 2007, New Zealand passed the Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007, which removed the defence of &quot;reasonable force&quot; for the purpose of correction. In its third and final vote, Parliament voted 113–8 in favour of the legislation.

===Saudi Arabia===
Saudi Arabia ratified the convention in 1996, with a reservation &quot;with respect to all such articles as are in conflict with the provisions of Islamic law&quot; which is the national law. The Committee on the Rights of the Child, which reviewed Saudi Arabia&#x27;s treatment of children under the convention in January 2005, strongly condemned the government for its practice of imposing the death penalty on juveniles, calling it &quot;a serious violation of the fundamental rights&quot;. The committee said it was &quot;deeply alarmed&quot; over the discretionary power judges hold to treat juveniles as adults: In its 2004 report, the Saudi Arabian government had stated that it &quot;never imposes capital punishment on persons ... below the age of 18&quot;. The government delegation later acknowledged that a judge could impose the death penalty whenever he decided that the convicted person had reached his or her maturity, regardless of the person&#x27;s actual age at the time of the crime or at the time of the scheduled execution. But the death penalty was ended for minors in April 2020.

On 20 October 2020, Human Rights Watch said that Saudi Arabia was seeking the death penalty against eight Saudi men who were accused of committing protest-related crimes at the age of 14 and 17. One of the boys who turned 18 in 2020 was charged with a nonviolent crime that he allegedly committed aged 9. Under the hudud – an Islamic law – prosecutors have reportedly sought the death penalty for the eight men, which if granted will make them ineligible for pardon.

=== South Korea ===
South Korea ratified the Convention of the Rights of the Child in 1991. The country then created further legislation to protect children experiencing physical and sexual abuse. However, a 2002 report indicated that South Korea had not yet satisfied article 12 of the CRC and that corporal violence of children in certain settings is not prohibited. A 2017 review by the Committee on the Rights of the Child concluded that further legal protections had been enacted such as legislation against child pornography, prostitution, and the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. A 2017 decision by the National Human Rights Commission of Korea ruled that no kid zones were discriminatory, but this did not legally restrict them from existing. The decision concluded that no-kid zones conflict with a child&#x27;s right to equality under the constitution and the CRC.
South Korea joined the Hague convention on International Child Abduction in 2012, but was criticized for its repetitive pattern of non-compliance. The pattern continued even after the 2023 Special Commissioner meeting of the Hague Conference, held in The Hague, Netherlands, in 2023, when the shared goal was reaffirmed between the Hague Convention and UNCRC.

===Sweden===
The Convention on the Rights of the Child has status as Swedish law since 1 January 2020. Also, before that, Swedish legislation was well in line with the convention and went in some cases further. It was given this status because Swedish authorities and the government thought the childs right perspective was not applied sufficiently in Swedish social welfare decisions and law enforcement.

=== Thailand ===
Upon accession to the convention on 27 March 1992, Thailand registered the following reservation: &quot;The application of Articles 7, 22 and 29 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child shall be subject to the national laws, regulations and prevailing practices in Thailand.&quot; This reservation was withdrawn on 11 April 1997 with respect to article 29 (goals of education), on 13 December 2010 with respect to article 7 (birth registration, name, nationality, care) and finally on 30 August 2024 with respect to article 22 (refugee children).

=== United Kingdom ===
The United Kingdom ratified the convention on 16 December 1991, with several declarations and reservations, and made its first report to the Committee on the Rights of the Child in January 1995. Concerns raised by the committee included the growth in child poverty and inequality, the extent of violence towards children, the use of custody for young offenders, the low age of criminal responsibility, and the lack of opportunities for children and young people to express views. The 2002 report of the committee expressed similar concerns, including the welfare of children in custody, unequal treatment of asylum seekers, and the negative impact of poverty on children&#x27;s rights. In September 2008, the UK government decided to withdraw its reservations and agree to the convention in these respects.

Although child slavery is difficult to gauge within the UK, child slaves are imported into the UK and sold. Laws and enforcement mechanisms against slavery and human trafficking were consolidated and strengthened in the Modern Slavery Act 2015.

====Wales====
The National Assembly for Wales, now known as the Senedd passed the Rights of Children and Young Persons (Wales) Measure 2011, partially incorporating the Convention into domestic law.The National Assembly for Wales passed the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Act 2020, banning smacking, by abolishing the &quot;reasonable punishment defence.&quot;
====Scotland====
The Scottish Parliament passed the Children (Equal Protection from Assault) (Scotland) Act 2019, banning smacking, by removing the defence of &quot;justifiable assault&quot;. 
In March 2021, the Scottish Parliament unanimously passed the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (Incorporation) (Scotland) Bill, which partially incorporated the Convention into Scots law. The Bill was challenged by the UK Government and specified sections were found by the Supreme Court to be outwith the competence of the Scottish Parliament. The bill was amended and again passed in December 2023, receiving Royal Assent on 16 January 2024 and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (Incorporation) (Scotland) Act 2024 came into force on 16 July 2024.

====Jersey====
The States Assembly passed the Children and Young People (Jersey) Law 2022, banning smacking, by abolishing the defence of &quot;reasonable corporal punishment&quot;. The States Assembly incorporated the Convention into domestic law through the passage of the Children (Convention Rights) (Jersey) Law 2022.

=== United States ===

The United States government played an active role in the drafting of the convention and signed it on 16 February 1995, but has not ratified it. It has been claimed that American opposition to the convention stems primarily from political and religious conservatives. For example, The Heritage Foundation considers that &quot;a civil society in which moral authority is exercised by religious congregations, family, and other private associations is fundamental to the American order,&quot; and the Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA) argues that the CRC threatens homeschooling.

Most notably, at the time several states permitted the execution and life imprisonment of juvenile offenders, a direct contravention of Article 37 of the convention. The landmark 2005 Supreme Court decision in &quot;Roper v. Simmons&quot; declared juvenile executions to be unconstitutional as &quot;cruel and unusual punishment&quot;; in the 2012 case &quot;Miller v. Alabama&quot;, the court held that mandatory sentences of life without the possibility of parole are unconstitutional for juvenile offenders. However, the Court issued a ruling in &quot;Jones v. Mississippi&quot; that Miller does not require States to make an independent finding of &quot;permanent incorrigibility&quot; before sentencing the juvenile to life imprisonment without parole. 

State laws regarding the practice of closed adoption may also require an overhaul in light of the Convention&#x27;s position that children have a right to identity from birth.

During his 2008 campaign for president, Senator Barack Obama described the failure to ratify the convention as &quot;embarrassing&quot; and promised to review the issue but, as president, he never did. No president of the United States has submitted the treaty to the Senate requesting its advice and consent to ratification since the US signed it in 1995.

The United States has ratified two of the optional protocols to the convention: the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict, and the Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography.

==Optional protocols==
There are three optional protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The first, the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict requires parties to ensure that children under the age of 18 are not recruited compulsorily into their armed forces and calls on governments to do everything feasible to ensure that members of their armed forces who are under 18 years do not take part in hostilities. This protocol entered into force on 12 July 2002. As of , 172 states are party to the protocol, and another 8 states have signed but not ratified it.

The second, the Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography, requires parties to prohibit the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography. It entered into force on 18 January 2002. As of , 178 states are party to the protocol, and another 7 states have signed but not ratified it.

A third, the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a Communications Procedure, which would allow children or their representatives to file individual complaints for violation of the rights of children, was adopted in December 2011 and opened for signature on 28 February 2012. The protocol currently has 52 signatures and 50 ratifications: it entered into force on 14 April 2014 following the tenth ratification three months beforehand.

Proposals for additional optional protocols have also been made. In 2020, the independent &quot;Lancet-WHO-UNICEF Commission&quot; proposed the development of an optional protocol to protect children from the marketing of tobacco, alcohol, formula milk, sugar-sweetened beverages, gambling, and potentially damaging social media, and the inappropriate use of their personal data. (The WHO also has its own framework for making treaties.) In 2022, a group of international child rights and education experts joined a call for an update to the right to education under international law to explicitly guarantee children&#x27;s right to free pre-primary and free secondary education. Human Rights Watch has suggested doing so through a fourth optional protocol to the CRC. In June 2024, the UN&#x27;s Human Rights Council approved the establishment of a working group with the mandate of &quot;exploring the possibility of, elaborating and submitting to the Human Rights Council a draft optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child with the aim to: (a) Explicitly recognize that the right to education includes early childhood care and education; (b) Explicitly state that, with a view to achieving the right to education, States shall: (i) Make public pre-primary education available free to all, beginning with at least one year; (ii) Make public secondary education available free to all.&quot;

== Parental rights ==
On 7 October 2020, the vote on United Nations Draft Resolution A/HRC/45/L.48/Rev.1 – &quot;Rights of the child: Realizing the rights of the child through a healthy environment&quot; submitted by Germany (on behalf of the European Union) and Uruguay (on behalf of GRULAC) was adopted.

The Russian Federation&#x27;s Amendments L.57 and L.64 to include parental rights were rejected. The Russian delegate, Kristina Sukacheva, remarked that governments voting against parents deliberately shirk their international responsibilities to provide for the rights of the child. At the time of adoption, Uruguay stated that the incorporation of parental rights language as proposed by the Russian Federation would &quot;bring imbalance to the resolution and would also go against the spirit of the resolution&quot;.

<doc id="46493" wikidata="Q6781520" url="?curid=46493" title="Maryland Toleration Act">
<text>The Maryland Toleration Act, also known as the Act Concerning Religion, was the first law in North America requiring religious tolerance for Christians. It was passed on April 21, 1649, by the assembly of the Maryland colony, in St. Mary&#x27;s City in St. Mary&#x27;s County, Maryland. It created one of the pioneer statutes passed by the legislative body of an organized colonial government to guarantee any degree of religious liberty. Specifically, the bill, now usually referred to as the Toleration Act, granted freedom of conscience to all Christians. (The colony which became Rhode Island passed a series of laws, the first in 1636, which prohibited religious persecution including against non-Trinitarians; Rhode Island was also the first government to separate church and state.) Historians argue that it helped inspire later legal protections for freedom of religion in the United States. The Calvert family, who founded Maryland partly as a refuge for English Catholics, sought enactment of the law to protect Catholic settlers and those of other religions that did not conform to the dominant Anglicanism of Britain and her colonies.

The Act allowed freedom of worship for all Trinitarian Christians in Maryland, but sentenced to death anyone who denied the divinity of Jesus. It was revoked in 1654 by William Claiborne, a Virginian who had been appointed as a commissioner by Oliver Cromwell; he was an Anglican, a Puritan sympathizer, and strongly hostile to the Catholic Religion. When the Calverts regained control of Maryland, the Act was reinstated, before being repealed permanently in 1692 following the events of the Glorious Revolution, and the Protestant Revolution in Maryland. As the first law on religious tolerance in the British North America, it influenced related laws in other colonies and portions of it were echoed in the writing of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, which enshrined religious freedom in American law.

== Cecil Calvert ==
The Province of Maryland was founded by Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore in 1634. Like his father George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, who had originated the efforts that led to the colony&#x27;s charter, he was Catholic at a time when the Kingdom of England was dominated by the Church of England. The Calverts intended the colony to function both as a haven for English Catholics fleeing religious persecution and as a source of income for themselves and their descendants. Many of Maryland&#x27;s first settlers were Catholic, including at least two Catholic priests, one of whom became the earliest chronicler of the colony&#x27;s history. But whatever Calvert&#x27;s intentions, Maryland was a colony of an Anglican nation. Its charter had been granted by an Anglican king and seems to have assumed that the Church of England would be its official church. Eventually, Anglican and Puritan newcomers quickly came to outnumber the early Catholic settlers. Thus, by 1649 when the law was passed, the colonial assembly was dominated by Protestants, and the law was in effect an act of Protestant tolerance for Catholics, rather than the reverse.

From Maryland&#x27;s earliest days, Cecil Calvert had enjoined its colonists to leave religious rivalries behind. Along with giving instructions on the establishment and defense of the colony, he asked the men he appointed to lead it to ensure peace between Protestants and Catholics. He also asked the Catholics to practice their faith as privately as possible, so as not to disturb that peace. The Ordinance of 1639, Maryland&#x27;s earliest comprehensive law, expressed a general commitment to the rights of man, but did not specifically detail protections for religious minorities of any kind. Peace prevailed until the English Civil War, which opened religious rifts and threatened Calvert&#x27;s control of Maryland. In 1647, after the death of Governor Leonard Calvert, Protestants seized control of the colony. Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore, quickly regained power, but recognized that religious tolerance not specifically enshrined in law was vulnerable. This recognition was combined with the arrival of a group of Puritans whom Calvert had induced to establish Providence, now Annapolis, by guaranteeing their freedom of worship. Partially to confirm the promises he made to them, Calvert wrote the Maryland Toleration Act and encouraged the colonial assembly to pass it. They did so on April 21, 1649.

==Description==
The Maryland Toleration Act was an act of tolerance, allowing specific religious groups to practice their religion without being punished, but retaining the ability to revoke that right at any time. It also granted tolerance to only Christians who believed in the Trinity. The law was very explicit in limiting its effects to Christians:

Settlers who blasphemed by denying the Trinity or the divinity of Jesus Christ could be punished by execution or the seizure of their lands. That meant that Jews, Unitarians, and other dissenters from Trinitarian Christianity who practiced their religions risked their lives. Any person who insulted the Virgin Mary, the apostles, or the evangelists could be whipped, jailed, or fined. Otherwise, Trinitarian Christians&#x27; right to worship was protected. The law outlawed the use of &quot;heretic&quot; and other religious insults against them.

The law was used in at least one attempt to prosecute a non-Christian. In 1658, a Jew named Jacob Lumbrozo was accused of blasphemy after saying that Jesus was not the son of God and that the miracles described in the New Testament were conjuring tricks. Lumbrozo did not deny having said such things but argued that he had only responded to questions asked of him. He was held for trial, but the case was later dismissed, and he was given full citizenship as a condition of the restoration of Calvert&#x27;s rule following the English Civil War.

The law had its detractors, even among those groups protected by it. Puritans were concerned that the act and the proprietary government in general were royalist. They were also concerned that by swearing allegiance to Calvert, who was Catholic, they were being required to submit to the Pope, whom they considered to be the Antichrist. Some Anglicans also opposed the law, believing that the Church of England should be the colony&#x27;s sole established church.

==Repeal and legacy==
In 1654, five years after its passage, the Act was repealed. Two years earlier the colony had been seized by Protestants following the execution of King Charles I of England and the outbreak of the English Civil War. In the early stages of that conflict, the colonial assembly of Maryland and its neighbors in Virginia had publicly declared their support for the King. Parliament appointed Protestant commissioners loyal to their cause to subdue the colonies, and two of them, the Virginian William Claiborne and Puritan leader Richard Bennett, took control of the colonial government in St. Mary&#x27;s City in 1652. In addition to repealing the Maryland Toleration Act with the assistance of Protestant assemblymen, Claiborne and Bennett passed a new law barring Catholics from openly practicing their religion. Calvert regained control after making a deal with the colony&#x27;s Protestants, and in 1657 the Act was again passed by the colonial assembly and remained in effect until 1692.

Following the Glorious Revolution of 1688 in England, when the Catholic King James II of England was deposed and the Protestant William III ascended the throne, a rebellion of Maryland Puritan Protestants overthrew Calvert&#x27;s rule. They quickly rescinded the Toleration Act and banned public practice of Catholicism, and it would never be reinstated under colonial rule. In fact, the colony established the Church of England as its official church in 1702 and explicitly barred Catholics from voting in 1718. The Calvert family regained control over the colony in 1715, but only after Benedict Calvert converted to Protestantism. His political control remained tense enough that he did not risk an attempt to reinstate protections for Catholics. It took until the era of the American Revolution for religious tolerance or freedom to again become the practice in Maryland.

While the law did not secure religious freedom, and while it included severe limitations, it was nonetheless a significant milestone. It predates the Enlightenment, which is generally considered to be when the idea of religious freedom took root, and stands as the first legal guarantee of religious tolerance in American and British history. Later laws ensuring religious tolerance and freedom, including the British Act of Toleration of 1689, the Holy Experiment in Pennsylvania, and laws concerning religion in other colonies such as South Carolina, may have been influenced by its example. According to historian Robert Brugger, &quot;...the measure marked a notable departure from Old World oppression.&quot; It was not until the passage of the signed First Amendment to the Constitution over a century later that religious freedom was enshrined as a fundamental guarantee, but even that document echoes the Toleration Act in its use of the phrase, &quot;free exercise thereof&quot;. Thus, despite its lack of a full guarantee of religious freedom or broad-based tolerance, the law is &quot;a significant step forward in the struggle for religious liberty.&quot;

<text>Child Soldiers International, formerly the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers, was a UK-based non-governmental organization that worked to prevent the recruitment, use and exploitation of children by armed forces and groups. It ceased operations as of 7 June 2019.

==History==
Formerly the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers, Child Soldiers International was founded in 1998 by five human rights and humanitarian organizations: Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, Rädda Barnen (in the name of Save the Children), Jesuit Refugee Service and QUNO Geneva. Its purpose was to campaign for the adoption of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict (OPAC) – a human rights treaty that prohibits the use of children in armed conflict and raises the age of military recruitment. The treaty was adopted in 2000 and entered the enforcement phase on 12 February 2002. Child Soldiers International continued to promote adherence to the OPAC and other relevant human rights standards.

==Priority countries==
Child Soldiers International had a London headquarters and conducted research, advocacy and capacity building in countries across the world. Programmes included: Central African Republic; Democratic Republic of Congo; Afghanistan; India; Myanmar; Thailand;

==Policy making==
Child Soldiers International delivered research findings and policy recommendations to the United Nations Security Council in New York and the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child in Geneva, Switzerland. According to UN documents, in relation to the adoption and enforcement of the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict, Child Soldiers International played &quot;a key role in ensuring implementation at every level.&quot;

==Publications==
Child Soldiers International and UNICEF published the &quot;Guide to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child&quot; in December 2003. The guide summarizes the process of the treaty&#x27;s adoption, its fundamental provisions, and recommends that certain activities be undertaken to ensure its full enforcement. It is a practical tool written to aid other NGOs, humanitarian groups, and legislative bodies in implementing OPAC&#x27;s standards.

In 2001, 2004 and 2008, Child Soldiers International published ‘Child Soldiers Global Reports’ which provide a snapshot of the child soldier situation in every country worldwide. In 2012, Child Soldiers International published Louder than words: an agenda for action to end state use of child soldiers, accompanied by a practical 10-point checklist to assist states to end their recruitment of children. In 2016, Child Soldiers International published &quot;A law unto themselves? Confronting the recruitment of children by armed groups&quot;. This provides a legal analysis of progress made so far in engaging with armed groups about child recruitment and use.

==Funding and organisational structure==
Child Soldiers International was a UK registered charity (registered charity number 1095237), with section 501(c)(3) public charity status in the USA.

Annual audited financial statements were filed with the UK Charity Commission, Companies House, and published on Child Soldiers International&#x27;s own website. For the 2015-16 financial year Child Soldiers International had an annual income of £623,588 and expenditure of £604,832. In 2015–16, 94% of expenditure supported programme activities (6% of expenditure supported the costs of generating funds).

Programmatic work was delivered in close collaboration with local and national organisations in target countries. The organisation was governed by a board of trustees.

<doc id="46496" wikidata="Q39231" url="?curid=46496" title="Mount Fuji">
<text>is an active stratovolcano located on the Japanese island of Honshu, with a summit elevation of . It is the highest mountain in Japan, the second-highest volcano located on an island in Asia (after Mount Kerinci on the Indonesian island of Sumatra), and seventh-highest peak of an island on Earth. Mount Fuji last erupted from 1707 to 1708. The mountain is located about southwest of Tokyo and is visible from the Japanese capital on clear days. Mount Fuji&#x27;s exceptionally symmetrical cone, which is covered in snow for about five months of the year, is commonly used as a cultural icon of Japan and is frequently depicted in art and photography, as well as visited by sightseers, hikers and mountain climbers.

Mount Fuji is one of Japan&#x27;s along with Mount Tate and Mount Haku. It is a Special Place of Scenic Beauty and one of Japan&#x27;s Historic Sites. It was added to the World Heritage List as a Cultural Site on June 22, 2013. According to UNESCO, Mount Fuji has &quot;inspired artists and poets and been the object of pilgrimage for centuries&quot;. UNESCO recognizes 25 sites of cultural interest within the Mount Fuji locality. These 25 locations include the mountain and the Shinto shrine, Fujisan Hongū Sengen Taisha.

== Etymology ==

The current &quot;kanji&quot; for Mount Fuji, and , mean &quot;wealth&quot; or &quot;abundant&quot; and &quot;man of status&quot; respectively. However, the origins of this spelling and of the name &quot;Fuji&quot; continue to be debated.

A text of the 9th century, &quot;Tale of the Bamboo Cutter&quot;, says that the name came from and also from the image of ascending the slopes of the mountain. An early folk etymology claims that &quot;Fuji&quot; came from (&quot;not&quot; + &quot;two&quot;), meaning &quot;without equal&quot; or &quot;nonpareil&quot;. Another claims that it came from (&quot;not&quot; + &quot;to exhaust&quot;), meaning &quot;never-ending&quot;.

Hirata Atsutane, a Japanese classical scholar in the Edo period, speculated that the name is from a word meaning &quot;a mountain standing up shapely as an of a rice plant&quot;. British missionary John Batchelor (1855–1944) argued that the name is from the Ainu word for &quot;fire&quot; (&quot;fuchi&quot;) of the fire deity Kamui Fuchi, which was denied by a Japanese linguist Kyōsuke Kindaichi on the grounds of phonetic development (sound change). It is also pointed out that &quot;huchi&quot; means an &quot;old woman&quot; and &quot;ape&quot; is the word for &quot;fire&quot;, &quot;ape huchi kamuy&quot; being the fire deity. Research on the distribution of place names that include &quot;fuji&quot; as a part also suggest the origin of the word &quot;fuji&quot; is in the Yamato language rather than Ainu. Japanese toponymist Kanji Kagami argued that the name has the same root as and , and came from its &quot;long well-shaped slope&quot;.
Modern linguist Alexander Vovin proposes an alternative hypothesis based on Old Japanese reading : the word may have been borrowed from Eastern Old Japanese 火主, meaning &quot;fire master&quot;.

=== Variations ===
In English, the mountain is known as Mount Fuji. Some sources refer to it as &quot;Fuji-san&quot;, &quot;Fujiyama&quot; or, redundantly, &quot;Mt. Fujiyama&quot;. Japanese speakers refer to the mountain as &quot;Fuji-san&quot;. This &quot;san&quot; is not the honorific suffix used with people&#x27;s names, such as Watanabe-san, but the Sino-Japanese reading of the character used in Sino-Japanese compounds. In Nihon-shiki and Kunrei-shiki romanization, the name is transliterated as &quot;Huzi&quot;.

Other Japanese names which have become obsolete or poetic include , , , and , created by combining the first character of , &quot;Fuji&quot;, and , &quot;mountain&quot;.

== History ==
Mount Fuji is an attractive volcanic cone and has been a frequent subject of Japanese art especially after 1600, when Edo (now Tokyo) became the capital and people saw the mountain while traveling on the Tōkaidō road. According to the historian H. Byron Earhart, &quot;in medieval times it eventually came to be seen by Japanese as the &quot;number one&quot; mountain of the known world of the three countries of India, China, and Japan&quot;. The mountain is mentioned in Japanese literature throughout the ages and is the subject of many poems.

The summit has been thought of as sacred since ancient times and was therefore forbidden to women. It was not until 1872 that the Japanese government issued an edict (May 4, 1872, Grand Council of State Edict 98) stating, &quot;Any remaining practices of female exclusion on shrine and temple lands shall be immediately abolished, and mountain climbing for the purpose of worship, etc., shall be permitted.&quot; Tatsu Takayama, a Japanese woman, became the first woman on record to summit Mount Fuji in the fall of 1832.

Ancient samurai used the base of the mountain as a remote training area, near the present-day town of Gotemba. The &quot;shōgun&quot; Minamoto no Yoritomo held &quot;yabusame&quot; archery contests in the area in the early Kamakura period.

The first ascent by a foreigner was by Sir Rutherford Alcock in September 1860, who ascended the mountain in 8 hours and descended in 3 hours. Alcock&#x27;s brief narrative in &quot;The Capital of the Tycoon&quot; was the first widely disseminated description of the mountain in the West. Lady Fanny Parkes, the wife of British ambassador Sir Harry Parkes, was the first non-Japanese woman to ascend Mount Fuji, in 1867. Photographer Felix Beato climbed Mount Fuji two years later.

On March 5, 1966, BOAC Flight 911, a Boeing 707, broke up in flight and crashed near the Mount Fuji Gotemba New fifth station, shortly after departure from Tokyo International Airport. All 113 passengers and 11 crew members died in the disaster, which was attributed to the extreme clear-air turbulence caused by lee waves downwind of the mountain. There is a memorial for the crash victims a short distance down from the Gotemba New fifth station.

Today, Mount Fuji is an international destination for tourism and mountain climbing. In the early 20th century, populist educator Frederick Starr&#x27;s Chautauqua lectures about his several ascents of Mount Fuji— in 1913, 1919, and 1923—were widely known in America. A well-known Japanese saying suggests that a wise person will climb Mt. Fuji once in their lifetime, but only a fool would climb it twice. It remains a popular symbol in Japanese culture, including making numerous movie appearances, inspiring the Infiniti logo, and even appearing in medicine with the Mount Fuji sign.

In September 2004, the staffed weather station at the summit was closed after 72 years in operation. Observers monitored radar sweeps that detected typhoons and heavy rains. The station, which was the highest in Japan at , was replaced by a fully automated meteorological system.

Mount Fuji was added to the World Heritage List as a Cultural Site on June 22, 2013.

== Geography ==

Mount Fuji is a very distinctive feature of the geography of Japan. It stands tall and is located near the Pacific coast of central Honshu, just southwest of Tokyo. It straddles the boundary of Shizuoka and Yamanashi prefectures. Four small cities surround it - Gotemba to the east, Fujiyoshida to the north, Fujinomiya to the southwest, and Fuji to the south - as well as several towns and villages in the area. It is surrounded by five lakes: Lake Kawaguchi, Lake Yamanaka, Lake Sai, Lake Motosu and Lake Shōji. They, and nearby Lake Ashi in Kanagawa Prefecture, provide expansive views of the mountain. The mountain is part of the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park. It can be seen more distantly from Yokohama, Tokyo, and sometimes as far as Chiba, Saitama, Tochigi, Ibaraki and Lake Hamana when the sky is clear. It has been photographed from space during a space shuttle mission.

=== Climate ===
The summit of Mount Fuji has a tundra climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;ET&quot;). The temperature is very low at the high altitude, and the cone is covered by snow for several months of the year. The lowest recorded temperature is recorded in February 1981, and the highest temperature was recorded in August 1942.

Fuji&#x27;s seasonal snowcap begins at an average date of 2 October. In 2024, the snowcap formed on 6 November, the latest-occurring since records began in 1894.

== Geology ==

Mount Fuji is located at a triple junction trench where the Amurian Plate, Okhotsk Plate, and Philippine Sea Plate meet. These three plates form the western part of Japan, the eastern part of Japan, and the Izu Peninsula respectively. The Pacific Plate is being subducted beneath these plates, resulting in volcanic activity. Mount Fuji is also located near three island arcs: the Southwestern Japan Arc, the Northeastern Japan Arc, and the Izu-Bonin-Mariana Arc. The Fuji triple junction is only from the Boso triple junction.

Fuji&#x27;s main crater is in diameter and deep. The bottom of the crater is in diameter. Slope angles from the crater to a distance of are 31°–35°, the angle of repose for dry gravel. Beyond this distance, slope angles are about 27°, which is caused by an increase in scoria. Mid-flank slope angles decrease from 23° to less than 10° in the piedmont.
Scientists have identified four distinct phases of volcanic activity in the formation of Mount Fuji. The first phase, called &quot;Sen-komitake&quot;, is composed of an andesite core recently discovered deep within the mountain. &quot;Sen-komitake&quot; was followed by the &quot;&quot;Komitake&quot; Fuji&quot;, a basalt layer believed to be formed several hundred thousand years ago. Approximately 100,000 years ago, &quot;Old Fuji&quot; was formed over the top of &quot;Komitake&quot; Fuji. The modern, &quot;New Fuji&quot; is believed to have formed over the top of Old Fuji around 10,000 years ago.

Pre-Komitake started erupting in the Middle Pleistocene in an area north of Mount Fuji. After a relatively short pause, eruptions began again which formed Komitake Volcano in the same location. These eruptions ended 100,000 years ago. Ashitake Volcano was active from 400,000 to 100,000 years ago and is located southeast of Mount Fuji. Mount Fuji started erupting 100,000 years ago, with Ko-Fuji (old-Fuji) forming 100,000 to 17,000 years ago, but which is now almost completely buried. A large landslide on the southwest flank occurred about 18,000 years ago. Shin-Fuji (new-Fuji) eruptions in the form of lava, lapilli and volcanic ash, have occurred between 17,000 and 8,000 years ago, between 7,000 and 3,500 years ago, and between 4,000 and 2,000 years ago. Flank eruptions, mostly in the form of parasitic cinder cones, ceased in 1707. The largest cone, Omuro-Yama, is one of more than 100 cones aligned NW-SE and NE-SW through the summit. Mt. Fuji also has more than 70 lava tunnels and extensive lava tree molds. Two large landslides are at the head of the Yoshida-Osawa and Osawa-Kuzure valleys.

, the volcano is classified as active with a low risk of eruption. The last recorded eruption was the Hōei eruption which started on December 16, 1707 (&quot;Hōei 4, 23rd day of the 11th month&quot;), and ended about January 1, 1708 (&quot;Hōei 4, 9th day of the 12th month&quot;). The eruption formed a new crater and a second peak, named Mount Hōei, halfway down its southeastern side. Fuji spewed cinders and ash which fell like rain in Izu, Kai, Sagami, and Musashi. Since then, there have been no signs of an eruption. However, on the evening of March 15, 2011, there was a magnitude 6.2 earthquake at shallow depth a few kilometres from Mount Fuji on its southern side.

=== Recorded eruptions ===
About 11,000 years ago, a large amount of lava began to erupt from the west side of the top of the ancient Fuji mountain. This lava formed the new Fuji which is the main body of Mount Fuji. Since then, the tops of the ancient Fuji and the new Fuji are side by side. About 2,500–2,800 years ago, the top part of ancient Fuji caused a large-scale landslide due to weathering, and finally, only the top of Shin-Fuji remained.
There are ten known eruptions that can be traced to reliable records.
=== Current eruptive danger ===

Following the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake, there was speculation in the media that the shock may induce volcanic unrest at Mount Fuji. In September 2012, mathematical models created by the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention (NRIESDP) suggested that the pressure in Mount Fuji&#x27;s magma chamber could be 1.6 megapascals higher than it was before its last eruption in 1707. This was interpreted by some media outlets to mean that an eruption of Mount Fuji could be imminent. However, since there is no known method of directly measuring the pressure of a volcano&#x27;s magma chamber, indirect calculations of the type used by NRIESDP are speculative and unverifiable. Other indicators suggestive of heightened eruptive danger, such as active fumaroles and recently discovered faults, are typical occurrences at this type of volcano.

Eruption fears continued into the 2020s. In 2021, a new hazard map was created to help residents plan for evacuation, stoking fears because of its increased estimate of lava flow and additional vents. Soon afterwards, a 4.8 magnitude earthquake hit the area, sending the phrase &quot;Mt Fuji eruption&quot; trending on Twitter. However, the Japan Meteorological Agency assured the public the earthquake did not increase the eruption risk. In 2023, a new evacuation plan was developed to account for the 2021 hazard map update.

== Aokigahara forest ==
The forest at the northwest base of the mountain is named Aokigahara. Folk tales and legends tell of ghosts, demons, yūrei and yōkai haunting the forest, and in the 19th century, Aokigahara was one of many places poor families abandoned the very young and elderly. Approximately 30 suicides have been counted yearly, with a high of nearly 80 bodies in 2002. The recent increase in suicides prompted local officials to erect signs that attempt to convince individuals experiencing suicidal intent to re-think their desperate plans, and sometimes these messages have proven effective. The numbers of suicides in the past creates an allure that has persisted across the span of decades.

Many hikers mark their routes by leaving colored plastic tape behind as they pass, raising concern among prefectural officials about the forest&#x27;s ecosystem.

== Adventuring ==
=== Transportation ===

The closest airport with scheduled international service is Mt. Fuji Shizuoka Airport. It opened in June 2009. It is about from Mount Fuji. The major international airports serving Tokyo, Tokyo International Airport (Haneda Airport) in Tokyo and Narita International Airport in Chiba are approximately three hours and 15 minutes from Mount Fuji.

=== Climbing routes ===


Approximately 300,000 people climbed Mount Fuji in 2009. The most popular period for people to hike up Mount Fuji is from July to August, while huts and other facilities are operating and the weather is warmest. Buses to the trail heads typically used by climbers start running on July 1. Climbing from October to May is very strongly discouraged, after a number of high-profile deaths and severe cold weather. Most Japanese climb the mountain at night in order to be in a position at or near the summit when the sun rises. The morning light is called &quot;goraikō&quot;, &quot;arrival of light&quot;.

There are four major routes to the summit, each has numbered stations along the way. They are (clockwise, starting north): Kawaguchiko, Subashiri, Gotemba, and Fujinomiya routes. Climbers usually start at the fifth stations, as these are reachable by car or by bus. The summit is the tenth station on each trail. The stations on different routes are at different elevations; the highest fifth station is located at Fujinomiya, followed by Yoshida, Subashiri, and Gotemba. There are four additional routes from the foot of the mountain: Shojiko, Yoshida, Suyama, and Murayama routes.

Even though it has only the second-highest fifth station, the Yoshida route is the most popular route because of its large parking area and many large mountain huts where a climber can rest or stay. During the summer season, most Mount Fuji climbing tour buses arrive there. The next most popular is the Fujinomiya route, which has the highest fifth station, followed by Subashiri and Gotemba. The ascent from the new fifth station can take anywhere between five and seven hours while the descent can take from three to four hours. Even though most climbers do not use the Subashiri and Gotemba routes, many descend these because of their ash-covered paths. From the seventh station to near the fifth station, one could run down these ash-covered paths in approximately 30 minutes.

There are also tractor routes along the climbing routes. These tractor routes are used to bring food and other materials to huts on the mountain. Because the tractors usually take up most of the width of these paths and they tend to push large rocks from the side of the path, the tractor paths are off-limits to the climbers on sections that are not merged with the climbing or descending paths. Nevertheless, one can sometimes see people riding mountain bikes along the tractor routes down from the summit. This is particularly risky, as it becomes difficult to control speed and may send some rocks rolling along the side of the path, which may hit other people.

The four routes from the foot of the mountain offer historical sites. The Murayama is the oldest route, and the Yoshida route still has many old shrines, teahouses, and huts along its path. These routes are gaining popularity recently and are being restored, but climbing from the foot of the mountain is still relatively uncommon. Bears that live on the mountain have been sighted along the Yoshida route.

Huts at and above the fifth stations are usually staffed during the climbing season, but huts below fifth stations are not usually staffed for climbers. The number of open huts on routes are proportional to the number of climbers—Yoshida has the most while Gotemba has the fewest. The huts along the Gotemba route also tend to start later and close earlier than those along the Yoshida route. Also, because Mount Fuji is designated as a national park, it is illegal to camp above the fifth station.

There are eight peaks around the crater at the summit. The highest point in Japan, Ken-ga-mine, is where the Mount Fuji Radar System used to be (it was replaced by an automated system in 2004). Climbers are able to visit each of these peaks.

=== Paragliding ===
Paragliders take off in the vicinity of the fifth station Gotemba parking lot, between Subashiri and Hōei-zan peak on the south side of the mountain, in addition to several other locations, depending on wind direction. Several paragliding schools use the wide sandy/grassy slope between Gotemba and Subashiri parking lots as a training hill.

===Overtourism concerns===
On 1 February 2024, the Yamanashi prefectural government imposed a mandatory fee of 2,000 yen ($13) for hikers using the Yoshida trail beginning in the summer season as part of efforts to ease congestion and provide funding for safety protocols. It later announced that it would impose a daily limit of 4,000 hikers on the trail and close it between 4 p.m. and 3 a.m except for guests in mountain lodges. The Shizuoka prefectural government subsequently announced that it would also close the Subashiri, Gotemba and Fujinomiya trails at the same time period with the same exceptions, citing also concerns over congestion.

== In culture ==
=== Shinto mythology ===
In Shinto mythology, Kuninotokotachi (国之常立神, &quot;Kuninotokotachi-no-Kami&quot;, in &quot;Kojiki&quot;)(国常立尊, &quot;Kuninotokotachi-no-Mikoto&quot;, in &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;) is one of the two gods born from &quot;something like a reed that arose from the soil&quot; when the earth was chaotic. According to the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, Konohanasakuya-hime, wife of Ninigi, is the goddess of Mount Fuji, where Fujisan Hongū Sengen Taisha is dedicated for her.

In ancient times, the mountain was worshipped from afar. The Asama shrine was set up at the foothills to ward off eruptions. In the Heian period (794–1185), volcanic activity subsided and Fuji was used as a base for Shugendō, a syncretic religion combining mountain worship and Buddhism. Worshippers began to climb the slopes and by the early 12th century, Matsudai Shonin had founded a temple on the summit.

Fuji-kō was an Edo period cult centred around the mountain founded by an ascetic named Hasegawa Kakugyō (1541–1646). The cult venerated the mountain as a female deity, and encouraged its members to climb it. In doing so they would be reborn, &quot;purified and... able to find happiness.&quot; The cult waned in the Meiji period and although it persists to this day it has been subsumed into Shintō sects.

=== Popular culture ===
As a national symbol of the country, the mountain has been depicted in various art media such as paintings, woodblock prints (such as Hokusai&#x27;s &quot;Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji&quot; and &quot;100 Views of Mount Fuji&quot; from the 1830s), poetry, music, theater, film, manga, anime, pottery and even Kawaii subculture.

Before its explosive eruption in 1980, Mount St. Helens was once known as &quot;The Fuji of America&quot;, for its striking resemblance to Mount Fuji. Mount Taranaki in New Zealand is also said to bear a resemblance to Mount Fuji, and for this reason has been used as a stand-in for the mountain in films and television.

<text>Translingual Information Detection, Extraction and Summarization (TIDES) is a technology development program funded by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), focused on the automated processing and understanding of language data. The primary goal of the program is to enable English speakers to locate and interpret required information quickly and effectively regardless of the original language.

==Components==

The four component capabilities of the technology being developed by TIDES includes:
* Detection – Locating required information.
* Extraction – Pulling out key facts.
* Summarization – Reducing the information into a readable length.
* Translation – Converting text from another language into English.

Tools for detection, extraction, and summarization must work within a language (monolingually) and across languages (translingually), to be used by people who speak only English. In addition to developing technology, TIDES is also researching methods to adapt it quickly and cheaply to other languages, including languages with limited linguistic resources. TIDES aims to integrate the component capabilities together and with other technologies to produce tools for real-world applications.

==Investigative Data Warehouse==
The FBI&#x27;s Investigative Data Warehouse contains an open-source news library, containing news gathered by the TIDES program. The information is collected from public websites around the world, including &quot;Ha&#x27;aretz&quot;, &quot;Pravda&quot;, the &quot;Jordan Times&quot;, &quot;The People&#x27;s Daily&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and others. It uses the Mitre Text and Audio Processing (MiTAP) system.

<doc id="46505" wikidata="Q497256" url="?curid=46505" title="Airplane!">
<text>Airplane! (alternatively titled Flying High!) is a 1980 American disaster comedy film written and directed by Jim Abrahams and brothers David and Jerry Zucker in their directorial debut, and produced by Jon Davison. It stars Robert Hays and Julie Hagerty and features Leslie Nielsen, Robert Stack, Lloyd Bridges, Peter Graves, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Lorna Patterson. It is a parody of the disaster film genre, particularly the 1957 Paramount film &quot;Zero Hour!&quot;, from which it borrows the plot, central characters, and some dialogue. It also draws many elements from &quot;Airport 1975&quot; and other films in the &quot;Airport&quot; series. It is known for using surreal humor and fast-paced slapstick comedy, including visual and verbal puns, gags, running jokes, and dark humor.

Released by Paramount Pictures, it was a critical and commercial success, grossing $171 million worldwide against a budget of $3.5 million. The creators received the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Adapted Comedy, and nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy and for the BAFTA Award for Best Screenplay.

Since its release, the film’s reputation has grown substantially. It ranked sixth on Bravo&#x27;s 100 Funniest Movies. In a 2007 survey by Channel 4 in the United Kingdom, it was judged the second-greatest comedy of all time, behind &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Life of Brian&quot;. In 2008, it was selected by &quot;Empire&quot; magazine as one of &#x27;The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time&#x27;, and in 2012 was voted #1 on The 50 Funniest Comedies Ever poll. In 2010, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
Ex-fighter pilot Ted Striker is a traumatized war veteran turned taxi driver. Because of his pathological fear of flying and subsequent &quot;drinking problem&quot;—he splashes beverages anywhere but into his mouth—Ted has been unable to hold a responsible job. His wartime girlfriend, Elaine Dickinson, now a flight attendant, breaks off her relationship with him before boarding her rostered flight from Los Angeles to Chicago. Ted abandons his taxi and buys a ticket on the same flight to try to win her back. Once on board, however, Elaine continues to reject him, causing Ted to accidentally drive several other passengers to suicide as he sadly reminisces.

After the in-flight meal is served, the entire flight crew and several passengers fall ill. Passenger Dr. Rumack discovers that the fish served during meal service has caused food poisoning. With the flight crew incapacitated, Elaine contacts the Chicago control tower for help and is instructed by tower supervisor Steve McCroskey to activate the plane&#x27;s autopilot, a large inflatable dummy pilot dubbed &quot;Otto&quot;, which will get them to Chicago but cannot land the plane. Elaine and Rumack convince Ted to take the controls. When Steve learns Ted is piloting, he contacts Ted&#x27;s former commanding officer, Rex Kramer—now serving as a commercial pilot—to help talk Ted through the landing procedure. Ted becomes uneasy when Kramer starts giving orders and he briefly breaks down amid more wartime flashbacks. Elaine and Rumack both bolster Ted&#x27;s confidence and he manages to once again take the controls.

As the plane nears Chicago, the weather worsens, complicating the landing. With Elaine&#x27;s help as co-pilot and Rex&#x27;s guidance from the tower, Ted is able to land the plane safely, despite the landing gear shearing off, and the passengers suffer only minor injuries. Rescue vehicles arrive to help unload the plane. Impressed by Ted&#x27;s courage, Elaine embraces and kisses him, rekindling their relationship. &quot;Otto&quot; restarts the plane and takes off as a female companion inflates beside him.

==Production==
Jerry Zucker, Jim Abrahams, and David Zucker (collectively known as Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker, or ZAZ) wrote &quot;Airplane!&quot; while they were performing with the Kentucky Fried Theatre, a theatre group they had founded in 1971. To obtain material for comedy routines, they routinely recorded late night television and reviewed the tapes later primarily to pull the commercials, a process Abrahams compared to &quot;seining for fish&quot;. During one such taping process, they unintentionally recorded the 1957 film &quot;Zero Hour!&quot;, and while scanning the commercials, found it to be a &quot;perfectly classically structured film&quot; according to Jerry Zucker. Abrahams later described &quot;Zero Hour!&quot; as &quot;the serious version of &quot;Airplane!&quot;&quot; It was the first film script they wrote, completed around 1975, and was originally called &quot;The Late Show&quot;. The script originally stayed close to the dialog and plot of &quot;Zero Hour!&quot;, as ZAZ thought they did not have a sufficient understanding of film at the time to structure a proper script. ZAZ&#x27;s script borrowed so much from &quot;Zero Hour!&quot; that they believed they needed to negotiate the rights to create the remake of the film and ensure they remain within the allowance for parody within copyright law. They were able to obtain the rights from Warner Bros. and Paramount for about $2,500 at the time. The original script contained spoofs of television commercials but people who proofread it advised them to shorten the commercials, and they eventually removed them. When their script was finished, they were unable to sell it.

While failing to sell their script, the trio met director John Landis, who encouraged them to write a film based on their theatre sketches. They managed to put &quot;The Kentucky Fried Movie&quot; into production in the late 1970s. David Zucker said &quot;it was the first time we had ever been on a movie set. We learned a lot. We learned that if you really wanted a movie to come out the way you wanted it to, you had to direct. So on the next movie, &quot;Airplane!&quot;, we insisted on directing&quot;.

Eventually the &quot;Airplane!&quot; script found its way to Paramount through Michael Eisner. Eisner learned of the script via Susan Baerwald, another scriptwriter with United Artists, and had Jeffrey Katzenberg track down and meet with ZAZ to discuss details. Avco Embassy Pictures also expressed interest in producing the film, but ZAZ decided to go with Paramount.

Paramount insisted the film be shot in color rather than black-and-white as ZAZ wanted, and to be set aboard a jet airliner rather than propeller plane to better identify with modern filmgoers. In exchange, Paramount acquiesced to ZAZ&#x27;s desire to cast serious actors for the film rather than comedy performers. Principal photography began on June 20, 1979, and wrapped on August 31, with the bulk of filming having been done in August. Jerry Zucker stood beside the camera during shooting, while David Zucker and Jim Abrahams watched the video feed to see how the film would look; they conferred after each take.

===Casting===
David Zucker explained that &quot;the trick was to cast actors like Robert Stack, Leslie Nielsen, Peter Graves, and Lloyd Bridges. These were people who, up to that time, had never done comedy. We thought they were much funnier than the comedians of that time were&quot;.

David Zucker felt Stack was the most important actor to be cast, since he was the &quot;linchpin&quot; of the film&#x27;s plot. Stack initially played his role in a way that was different from what the directors had in mind. They showed him a tape of impressionist John Byner impersonating Robert Stack. According to the producers, Stack was &quot;doing an impression of John Byner doing an impression of Stack&quot;. Stack was not initially interested in the part, but ZAZ persuaded him. Bridges&#x27; children advised him to take the part. Graves rejected the script at first, considering it tasteless. During filming, ZAZ had explained to Graves that his lines spoken to a young boy, like &quot;Have you ever seen a grown man naked?&quot;, would &quot;be explained later in a part that you aren&#x27;t in&quot;. On the DVD commentary, Abrahams said: &quot;I don&#x27;t understand. What did he think was tasteless about pedophilia?&quot;

For the role of Dr. Rumack, ZAZ initially suggested Dom DeLuise, Christopher Lee (who had appeared in &quot;Airport &#x27;77&quot;), Vincent Price, and Jack Webb, all of whom turned it down, before they considered Nielsen, who was &quot;just a fish in water&quot; in his role, according to Jerry Zucker. Nielsen&#x27;s career to this point had consisted mostly of serious leading roles but he wanted to work in comedy and was looking for a film to help in the transition. He was considered a &quot;closet comedian&quot; on set, pranking his fellow actors between shots, but immediately adopted his somber, serious persona when performing as Rumack. During filming, Nielsen used a device that made farting noises to keep the cast off-balance. Hays said that Nielsen &quot;played that thing like a maestro&quot;. Christopher Lee would later acknowledge that turning down the role (to star in the film &quot;1941&quot;) was a huge mistake.

The role of Ted Striker was written for David Letterman, who had auditioned for a news anchorman role in &quot;Kentucky Fried Movie&quot;. Letterman did a screen test in 1979 that ZAZ liked and they wanted him to do a second audition, but Letterman did not want to pursue the role and was not selected. Chevy Chase, Barry Manilow, Bill Murray and Fred Willard were also considered for the role. Caitlyn Jenner also read for the part. Instead, ZAZ opted for Robert Hays, co-star of ABC situation comedy &quot;Angie&quot;. Elaine&#x27;s part was auditioned for by Sigourney Weaver and Shelley Long but eventually went to Julie Hagerty. The directors advised the pair to play their roles straight. Hays and Hagerty developed an on-screen chemistry that worked in the film&#x27;s favor; they spent time to practice and perfect the bar dance routine set to &quot;Stayin&#x27; Alive&quot;, among other scenes.

For the &quot;red zone/white zone&quot; send-up of curbside terminal announcements in which public address announcers &quot;Betty&quot; and &quot;Vernon&quot; argue over the red and white zones, ZAZ went through the usual process of auditioning professional voice actors, but failed to find ones who could provide the desired authenticity. Instead, the filmmakers ultimately sought out and hired the real-life married couple who had recorded the announcement tapes which were then being used at Los Angeles International Airport. ZAZ lifted some of their dialog directly from the 1968 novel &quot;Airport&quot;, written by Arthur Hailey who had also written &quot;Zero Hour!&quot; script. The lifted lines included ones about an unwanted pregnancy; David Zucker said the couple &quot;got a kick out of it&quot;. The role of the Hare Krishna in the airport went to a college roommate of Hays&#x27;s, newcomer David Leisure, due to Leisure&#x27;s willingness to shave his head for the bit part; it would be several more years before Leisure landed his breakthrough role as Joe Isuzu. Baseball player Pete Rose was originally considered for the role of Roger Murdock.

ZAZ got businessman and Republican politician Howard Jarvis to make a cameo appearance. Jarvis, who was well known in California at the time for getting his tax policy Proposition 13 passed in 1978, plays the patient passenger who gets into Ted Striker&#x27;s cab at the start of the film. He then spends the entire movie sitting in an empty cab with the meter running. He also has the final line, which he says after the end credits: he looks at his watch and says &quot;Well, I&#x27;ll give him another twenty minutes, but that&#x27;s it!&quot;, the joke being that Jarvis was wasting money while being known for his stance on fiscal responsibility and limited spending.

===Music===
The film&#x27;s score was composed by Elmer Bernstein, who had provided soundtracks for classic films like &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;, &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;, &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;, and &quot;The Great Escape&quot;. ZAZ told Bernstein they did not want an epic score like his past works but &quot;a B-Movie level score, overdone and corny&quot;. According to ZAZ, Bernstein completely understood what they were trying to do, had laughed throughout a previous cut of the film, and wrote a &quot;fantastic score&quot;.

In 1980, an LP soundtrack for the film was released by Regency Records which includes dialog and songs from the film. Narrated by Shadoe Stevens, it features only one score track, the &quot;Love Theme from &quot;Airplane!&quot;&quot; composed by Bernstein. The soundtrack was altered for the European &quot;Flying High&quot; release, with several featured tracks swapped for pieces original to the LP.

In April 2009, La-La Land Records announced it would release the first official soundtrack album for &quot;Airplane!&quot;, containing Bernstein&#x27;s complete score. The soundtrack was released digitally on February 19, 2013, by Paramount Music.

==Release==
Prior to the film&#x27;s release, the directors were apprehensive following a mediocre audience response at a pre-screening, but the film earned its entire budget of about $3.5 million in its first five days of wide release.

&quot;Airplane!&quot; opened on June 27, 1980, in seven theatres in Toronto, grossing $83,058 in its opening weekend. It also opened in two theaters in Buffalo, grossing $14,000 in its first week. The film then expanded on Wednesday, July 2 to 705 theaters in the United States and Canada, grossing $6,052,514 in its first five days of wide release, finishing second for the weekend with a gross of $4,540,000. Overall, it grossed $83 million at the US and Canadian box office and returned $40 million in rentals, making it the fourth-highest-grossing film of 1980. Worldwide, the film earned $130 million in its initial release, and by 2002 it had made $171 million.

==Reception==

&quot;Airplane!&quot; received universal acclaim from critics and is widely regarded as one of the best films of 1980. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 97% based on 69 reviews, compiled retrospectively, with an average rating of 8.45/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Though unabashedly juvenile and silly, &quot;Airplane!&quot; is nevertheless an uproarious spoof comedy full of quotable lines and slapstick gags that endure to this day&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 78 out of 100 based on 18 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; wrote &quot;&quot;Airplane!&quot; is sophomoric, obvious, predictable, corny, and quite often very funny. And the reason it&#x27;s funny is frequently because it&#x27;s sophomoric, predictable, corny, etc.&quot; Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote &quot;&quot;Airplane!&quot; is more than a pleasant surprise... As a remedy for the bloated self-importance of too many other current efforts, it&#x27;s just what the doctor ordered&quot;.

In 2008, &quot;Airplane!&quot; was selected by &quot;Empire&quot; magazine as one of &#x27;The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time&#x27;. It was also placed on a similar list—&#x27;The Best 1000 Movies Ever Made&#x27;—by &quot;The New York Times&quot;. In November 2015, the film was ranked fourth in the Writers Guild of America&#x27;s list of &#x27;101 Funniest Screenplays&#x27;.

MaximOnline.com named the airplane crash in &quot;Airplane!&quot; as number four on its list of &quot;Most Horrific Movie Plane Crashes&quot;. Leslie Nielsen&#x27;s response to Hays&#x27; &quot;Surely you can&#x27;t be serious&quot; line—&quot;I am serious. And don&#x27;t call me Shirley&quot;—was 79th on AFI&#x27;s list of the best 100 movie quotes. In 2000, the American Film Institute listed &quot;Airplane!&quot; as number ten on its list of the 100 funniest American films. In the same year, &quot;Total Film&quot; readers voted it the second-greatest comedy film of all time. It was also second in the British 50 Greatest Comedy Films poll on Channel 4, beaten by &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Life of Brian&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; voted the film the &quot;funniest movie on video&quot; in their list of the 100 funniest movies on video.

A number of actors were cast to spoof their established images: prior to their roles in &quot;Airplane!&quot;, Nielsen, Stack, and Bridges were known for portraying adventurous, no-nonsense tough-guy characters. Stack&#x27;s role as the captain who loses his nerve in one of the earliest airline &quot;disaster&quot; films, &quot;The High and the Mighty&quot; (1954), is spoofed in &quot;Airplane!&quot;, as is Lloyd Bridges&#x27; 1970–1971 television role as airport manager Jim Conrad in &quot;San Francisco International Airport&quot;. Peter Graves was in the made-for-television film &quot;&quot;, in which an SST was unable to land owing to an emergency.

Nielsen enjoyed a major career boost subsequent to &quot;Airplane!&quot;″s release. The film marked a significant change in his film persona towards deadpan comedy, notably in the three &quot;Naked Gun&quot; films: &quot;The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!&quot; (1988)&quot;; The Naked Gun 2 : The Smell of Fear&quot; (1991)&quot;;&quot; and &quot;Naked Gun 33 : The Final Insult&quot; (1994). The films were based on the six-episode television series &quot;Police Squad!&quot; which starred Nielsen and was created and produced by Zucker–Abrahams–Zucker. This also led to his casting, many years later, in Mel Brooks&#x27; &quot;&quot;. Brooks had wanted to make the film for a long time, but put it off because, as he said: &quot;I just could not find the right Dracula&quot;. According to Brooks, he did not see &quot;Airplane!&quot; until years after its release. When he did, he knew Nielsen would be right for the part. When it was suggested that his role in &quot;Airplane!&quot; was against type, Nielsen protested that he had &quot;always been cast against type before&quot;, and that comedy was what he always really wanted to do.

==Influence==
Peter Farrelly said of the film: &quot;I was in Rhode Island the first time I saw &quot;Airplane!&quot; Seeing it for the first time was like going to a great rock concert, like seeing Led Zeppelin or the Talking Heads. We didn&#x27;t realize until later that what we&#x27;d seen was a very specific kind of comedy that we now call the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker school&quot;. Farrelly, along with his writing partner Bennett Yellin, sent a comedy script to David Zucker, who in return gave them their first Hollywood writing job. Farrelly said: &quot;I&#x27;ll tell you right now, if the Zuckers didn&#x27;t exist, there would be no Farrelly brothers&quot;.

During the Qantas Flight 72 incident over the Indian Ocean west of Australia in 2008, the captain recited some of Lloyd Bridges&#x27; lines to relieve tension while trying to land the plane. This was commented in the &quot;Air Disasters&quot; episode &quot;Free Fall&quot;.

The 2010 documentary &quot;Jews and Baseball: An American Love Story&quot; opens with a scene from the film, in which a passenger is offered the very short book &quot;Famous Jewish Sports Legends&quot; by a flight attendant.

The &quot;MythBusters&quot; TV show episode &quot;Airplane Hour&quot; reenacted the climax of the film to see if an inexperienced pilot could land a plane with only a call from Air Traffic Control. The Mythbusters had to use a simulation to test the myth but concluded that the scene was plausible. They did, however, mention that most planes today have an autopilot to land the plane safely.

In the 2012 film &quot;Ted&quot;, main character John Bennett tells the story of how he met Lori Collins. The flashback is a close recreation of the scene where Ted Striker met Elaine Dickinson in the disco.

In early 2014, Delta Air Lines began using a new on-board safety film with many 1980s references, featuring an ending with a cameo of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar reprising his role as co-pilot Roger Murdock.

In 2014, Travel Wisconsin began airing an ad with Robert Hays and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar reprising their roles from the film. Kareem makes the comment &quot;Why did I ever leave this place?&quot; referring to his time playing for the Milwaukee Bucks. Hays also reprises his role as an airline pilot in &quot;Sharknado 2: The Second One&quot;.

The first episode of the eighth season of the TV series &quot;The Goldbergs&quot; re-enacts certain scenes.

===Sequel===
&quot;Airplane II: The Sequel&quot;, first released on December 10, 1982, attempted to tackle the science fiction film genre, though there was still emphasis on the general theme of disaster films. Although most of the cast reunited for the sequel, the writers and directors of &quot;Airplane!&quot; chose not to be involved. In the DVD commentary for &quot;Airplane!&quot; David Zucker, Jim Abrahams, and Jerry Zucker claim to have never seen nor to have any desire to see &quot;Airplane II&quot;.

===Book and audiobook===
An oral history on the making of &quot;Airplane!&quot;, was published on October 3, 2023. An audiobook version was also released, featuring ZAZ as well as guests Jimmy Kimmel, Bill Hader, &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic, Molly Shannon, Sarah Silverman, Patton Oswalt, Beau Bridges, John Landis, Barry Diller and Michael Eisner, among others.

<doc id="46507" wikidata="Q1813203" url="?curid=46507" title="Party leaders of the United States Senate">
<text>The positions of majority leader and minority leader are held by two United States senators and people of the party leadership of the United States Senate. They serve as chief spokespersons for their respective political parties, holding the majority and the minority in the chamber. They are each elected to their posts by the senators of their party caucuses: the Senate Democratic Caucus and the Senate Republican Conference.

By Senate precedent, the presiding officer gives the majority leader priority in obtaining recognition to speak on the floor. The majority leader serves as the chief representative of their party in the Senate and is considered the most powerful member of the chamber. They also serve as the chief representative of their party in the entire Congress if the House of Representatives, and thus the office of the speaker of the House, is controlled by the opposition party. The Senate&#x27;s executive and legislative business is also managed and scheduled by the majority leader.

The assistant majority leader and assistant minority leader of the United States Senate, commonly called whips, are the second-ranking members of each party&#x27;s leadership. The main function of the majority and minority whips is to gather votes of their respective parties on major issues. As the second-ranking members of Senate leadership, if there is no floor leader present, the whip may become acting floor leader.

==Existing floor leaders==
The Senate of the 119th Congress is composed in 2025 of 53 Republicans, 45 Democrats, and 2 independents; both the independents caucus with the Democrats.

The leaders are Senators John Thune (R) of South Dakota and Chuck Schumer (D) of New York. The assistant leaders, or whips, are Senators John Barrasso (R) of Wyoming and Dick Durbin (D) of Illinois.

==History==
At first a &quot;Senate leader&quot; was an informal position usually an influential committee chairman, or a person of great eloquence, seniority, or wealth, such as Daniel Webster and Nelson Aldrich. By at least 1850, parties in each chamber of Congress began naming chairs, and while conference and caucus chairs carried very little authority, the Senate party floor leader positions arose from the position of conference chair. 

Senate Democrats began electing their floor leaders in 1920 while they were in the minority. John W. Kern was a Democratic senator from Indiana. While the title was not official, the Senate website identifies Kern as the first Senate party leader, serving in that capacity from 1913 through 1917 (and in turn, the first Senate Democratic leader), while serving concurrently as chairman of the Senate Democratic Caucus.

In 1925, the Republicans (who were in the majority at the time) also adopted this language when Charles Curtis became the first (official) majority leader, although his immediate predecessor Henry Cabot Lodge is considered the first (unofficial) Senate majority leader. However, despite this new, formal leadership structure, the Senate leader initially had virtually no power. Since the Democrats were fatally divided into northern liberal and southern conservative blocs, the Democratic leader had even less power than his title suggested.

Joseph T. Robinson of Arkansas, the Democratic leader from 1923 to 1937, saw it as his responsibility not to lead the Democrats, but to work the Senate for the president&#x27;s benefit, no matter who the president was. When Coolidge and Hoover were president, he assisted them in passing Republican legislation. Robinson helped end government operation of Muscle Shoals, helped pass the Hoover Tariff, and stymied a Senate investigation of the Power Trust. Robinson switched his own position on a drought relief program for farmers when Hoover made a proposal for a more modest measure. Alben Barkley called Robinson&#x27;s cave-in &quot;the most humiliating spectacle that could be brought about in an intelligent legislative body.&quot; When Franklin Roosevelt became president, Robinson followed the new president as loyally as he had followed Coolidge and Hoover. Robinson passed bills in the Hundred Days so quickly that Will Rogers joked &quot;Congress doesn&#x27;t pass legislation any more, they just wave at the bills as they go by.

In 1937, the rule giving majority leader right of first recognition was created. With the addition of this rule, the Senate majority leader enjoyed far greater control over the agenda of which bills to be considered on the floor.

During Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s tenure as Senate leader, the leader gained new powers over committee assignments.

==Senatorial role of the Vice President==

The United States Constitution designates the vice president of the United States as president of the Senate. The Constitution also calls for a president pro tempore, to serve as the presiding officer when the president of the Senate (the vice president) is absent. In practice, neither the vice president nor the president pro tempore—customarily the most senior (longest-serving) senator in the majority party—actually presides over the Senate on a daily basis; that task is given to junior senators of the majority party. Since the vice president may be of a different party from the majority and is not a Senate member subject to discipline, the rules of procedure of the Senate give the vice president no power beyond the presiding role. For these reasons, it is the majority leader who, in practice, manages the Senate. This is in contrast to the House of Representatives, where the elected speaker of the House has a great deal of discretionary power and generally presides over votes on legislative bills.

== Powers of the majority leader ==
Under a long-standing Senate precedent, motions or amendments by the majority leader are granted precedence over other motions by other senators. The majority leader can therefore make at any time a motion to proceed to the consideration of a bill on the Senate Calendar (which contains almost exclusively bills which have been reported by the committee they were assigned to); a motion to proceed may be agreed to either by unanimous consent or through the invocation of cloture. Conventionally, no senator other than the majority leader introduces motions to proceed, although every senator is theoretically allowed to. In addition, the majority leader can block consideration of amendments through a practice known as &quot;filling the tree&quot;, and decides which members will fill each of the committee seats reserved to the majority party; members of committees are therefore often prone to following the instructions of the majority leader, and rarely place bills on the Senate Calendar without the latter&#x27;s consent.

==List of party leaders==
The Democratic Party first selected a leader in 1920. The Republican Party first formally designated a leader in 1925.

<doc id="46510" wikidata="Q270794" url="?curid=46510" title="National Academy of Sciences">
<text>The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) is a United States nonprofit, non-governmental organization. NAS is part of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, along with the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) and the National Academy of Medicine (NAM).

As a national academy, new members of the organization are elected annually by current members, based on their distinguished and continuing achievements in original research. Election to the National Academy is one of the highest honors in the scientific field in the United States. Members of the National Academy of Sciences serve &quot;pro bono&quot; as &quot;advisers to the nation&quot; on science, engineering, and medicine. The group holds a congressional charter under Title 36 of the United States Code.

Congress legislated and President Abraham Lincoln signed an Act of Congress (1863) establishing the National Academy of Sciences as an independent, trusted government institution, created for the purpose of &quot;providing independent, objective advice to the nation on matters related to science and technology [and] to provide scientific advice to the government &#x27;whenever called upon&#x27; by any government department.&quot; This objective gave the academy the purpose of enriching and providing resources to any part of the federal government—rather than serving a single branch or executive agency, in contrast to the Library of Congress or many entities that report to the President. The goal was somewhat unusual at the time, and also different than other knowledge based entities serving a branch of government, such as the Library of Congress. The academy receives no compensation from the government for its services.

==Overview==
, the National Academy of Sciences includes 2,687 NAS members and 531 international members. It employed about 1,100 staff in 2005. Some 190 members have won a Nobel Prize. By its own admission in 1989, the addition of women to the academy &quot;continues at a dismal trickle&quot;; at that time there were 1,516 male members and 57 female members.

The National Academy of Sciences is one of the 135 member organizations of the International Science Council (ISC). Although there is no formal relationship with state and local academies of science, there often is informal dialogue. The National Academy is governed by a 17-member Council, made up of five officers (president, vice president, home secretary, international secretary, and treasurer) and 12 Councilors, all of whom are elected from among the academy membership. Agencies of the United States government fund about 85 percent of the academy&#x27;s activities. Further funding comes from state governments, private foundations, and industrial organizations.

The council has the ability ad-hoc to delegate certain tasks to committees. For example, the Committee on Animal Nutrition has produced a series of &quot;Nutrient requirements of domestic animals&quot; reports since at least 1944, each one being initiated by a different sub-committee of experts in the field for example on dairy cattle.

The National Academy of Sciences meets annually in Washington, D.C., which is documented in the &quot;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&quot; (PNAS), its scholarly journal. The National Academies Press is the publisher for the National Academies and makes more than 5,000 publications freely available on its website.

From 2004 to 2017, the National Academy of Sciences administered the Marian Koshland Science Museum to provide public exhibits and programming related to its policy work. The museum&#x27;s exhibits focused on climate change and infectious disease. In 2017, the museum closed and made way for a new science outreach program called LabX.

==History==

The Act of Incorporation, signed by President Abraham Lincoln on March 3, 1863, created the National Academy of Sciences and named 50 charter members. Many of the original NAS members came from the so-called &quot;Scientific Lazzaroni&quot;, an informal network of mostly physical scientists working in the vicinity of Cambridge, Massachusetts ().

In 1863, the organizers enlisted the support of Alexander Dallas Bache, and also Charles Henry Davis, a professional astronomer who had been recently recalled from the Navy to Washington to head the Bureau of Navigation. They also elicited support from Swiss-American geologist Louis Agassiz and American mathematician Peirce, who together planned the steps whereby the National Academy of Sciences was to be established. Senator Henry Wilson of Massachusetts was to name Agassiz to the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution.

Agassiz was to come to Washington, D.C., at the government&#x27;s expense to plan the organization with the others. This bypassed Joseph Henry, who was reluctant to have a bill for such an academy presented to Congress. This was in the belief that such a resolution would be &quot;opposed as something at variance with our democratic institutions&quot;. Nevertheless, Henry soon became the second President of NAS. Agassiz, Davis, Peirce, Benjamin Gould and Senator Wilson met at Bache&#x27;s house and &quot;hurriedly wrote the bill incorporating the Academy, including in it the name of fifty incorporators&quot;.

During the last hours of the session, when the Senate was immersed in the rush of last-minute business before its adjournment, Senator Wilson introduced the bill. Without examining it or debating its provisions, both the Senate and House approved it, and President Lincoln signed it.

Although hailed as a great step forward in government recognition of the role of science in American society, at the time, the National Academy of Sciences created enormous ill-feelings among scientists, whether or not they were named as incorporators.

The act states:[T]he Academy shall, whenever called upon by any department of the Government, investigate, examine, experiment, and report upon any subject of science or art, the actual expense of such investigations, examinations, experiments, and reports to be paid from appropriations which may be made for the purpose, but the Academy shall receive no compensation whatever for any services to the Government of the United States.The National Academies did not solve the problems facing a nation in Civil War as the Lazzaroni had hoped, nor did it centralize American scientific efforts. However, election to the National Academy did come to be considered &quot;the pinnacle of scientific achievement for Americans&quot; until the establishment of the Nobel Prize at the end of the 19th century.

In 1870, the congressional charter was amended to remove the limitation on the number of members.

In 2013, astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson was asked to write a speech for the 150th anniversary of the Gettysburg Address in which he made the point that one of Lincoln&#x27;s greatest legacies was establishing the National Academy of Sciences in that same year, which had the long-term effect of &quot;setting our Nation on a course of scientifically enlightened governance, without which we all may perish from this Earth&quot;.

==Membership==
The academy currently (as of late-2024) has 6892 members, including international ones, both past and present. 3218 of them are living. Existing members elect new members for life. Up to 120 members are elected every year while up to 30 foreign citizens may be elected as international members annually. The election process begins with a formal nomination, followed by a vetting period, and culminates in a final ballot at the academy&#x27;s annual meeting in April each year. Members are affiliated with a specific scientific field in one of six so-called &quot;classes&quot;, which include: Physical and Mathematical Sciences; Biological Sciences; Engineering and Applied Sciences; Biomedical Sciences; Behavioral and Social Sciences; and Applied Biological, Agricultural, and Environmental Sciences.

Over the entire history of the NAS, Harvard University is associated with the most members (331) overall, while the University of California at Berkeley is associated with the most members (255) without including the medical school. E.g. of the topmost schools, UC Berkeley/MIT/Princeton/Caltech do not have medical schools, while Harvard/Stanford do. The top ten institutions, two of which are from the University of California System and another four of which are in the Ivy League, account for nearly 28% of all members ever elected. Those ten are also precisely the only institutions in the entire history of the NAS to have had 100 or more members overall.

On the list for living members, only 14 institutions have 50 or more members overall, including the medical school (where it applies). They represent 32% of all living members of the NAS.



==Facilities==
The National Academy of Sciences maintains multiple buildings around the United States. The National Academy of Sciences Building is located at 2101 Constitution Avenue, in northwest Washington, D.C.; it sits on the National Mall, adjacent to the Marriner S. Eccles Federal Reserve Board Building and in front of the headquarters of the U.S. State Department. The building has a neoclassical architectural style and was built by architect Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue. The building was dedicated in 1924 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Goodhue engaged a team of artists and architectural sculptors including Albert Herter, Lee Lawrie, and Hildreth Meière to design interior embellishments celebrating the history and significance of science. The building is used for lectures, symposia, exhibitions, and concerts, in addition to annual meetings of the NAS, NAE, and NAM. Cultural Programs of the National Academy of Sciences hosts exhibitions exploring intersections of art, science, and culture such as Mathemalchemy. The 2012 Presidential Award for Math and Science Teaching ceremony was held here on March 5, 2014. Approximately 150 staff members work at the NAS Building. In June 2012, it reopened to visitors after a major two-year restoration project which restored and improved the building&#x27;s historic spaces, increased accessibility, and brought the building&#x27;s aging infrastructure and facilities up to date.

More than 1,000 National Academies staff members work at The Keck Center of the National Academies at 500 Fifth Street in northwest Washington, D.C. The Keck Center provides meeting space and houses the National Academies Press Bookstore. The Marian Koshland Science Museum of the National Academy of Sciences – formerly located at 525 E St., N.W. – hosted visits from the public, school field trips, and permanent science exhibits.

NAS also maintains conference centers in California and Massachusetts. The Arnold and Mabel Beckman Center is located on 100 Academy Drive in Irvine, California, near the campus of the University of California, Irvine; it offers a conference center and houses several NAS programs. The J. Erik Jonsson Conference Center, located at 314 Quissett Avenue in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, is an NAS conference facility.

==Presidents==
The president is the head of the academy, elected by a majority vote of the membership to serve in this position for a term to be determined by the governing Council, not to exceed six years, and may be re-elected for a second term. Terms usually start on July 1 and ends on June 30. The academy has had 22 presidents since its foundation. The current president is geophysicist Marcia K. McNutt, the first woman to hold this position. Her term expires on June 30, 2026.

==Joint Declaration on Global Warming==
In 2005, the national science academies of the G8 forum (including the National Academy of Sciences) and science academies of Brazil, China, and India (three of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases in the developing world) signed a statement on the global response to climate change. The statement stresses that the scientific understanding of climate change had become sufficiently clear to justify nations taking prompt action.

On May 7, 2010, a letter signed by 255 Academy members was published in &quot;Science&quot; magazine, decrying &quot;political assaults&quot; against climate change scientists. This was in response to a civil investigative demand on the University of Virginia (UVA) by Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, seeking a broad range of documents from Michael E. Mann, a former UVA professor from 1999 to 2005. Mann, who currently works at the University of Pennsylvania, is a climate change researcher, and Cuccinelli alleges that Mann may have defrauded Virginia taxpayers in the course of his environmental research. Investigations had cleared Mann of charges that he falsified or suppressed data.

<doc id="46516" wikidata="Q42211" url="?curid=46516" title="Vandals">
<text>The Vandals were a Germanic people who were first reported in the written records as inhabitants of what is now Poland, during the period of the Roman Empire. Much later, in the fifth century, a group of Vandals led by kings established Vandal kingdoms first within the Iberian Peninsula, and then in the western Mediterranean islands, and North Africa.

Archaeologists associate the early Vandals with the Przeworsk culture, which has led to some authors equating them to the Lugii, who were another group of Germanic peoples associated with that same archaeological culture and region. Expanding into Dacia during the Marcomannic Wars and to Pannonia during the Crisis of the Third Century, the Vandals were confined to Pannonia by the Goths around 330 AD, where they received permission to settle from Constantine the Great. Around 400, raids by the Huns from the east forced many Germanic tribes to migrate west into the territory of the Roman Empire and, fearing that they might be targeted next, the Vandals were also pushed westwards, crossing the Rhine into Gaul along with other tribes in 406. In 409, the Vandals crossed the Pyrenees into the Iberian Peninsula, where the Hasdingi and the Silingi settled in Gallaecia (northwest Iberia) and Baetica (south-central Iberia).

On the orders of the Romans, the Visigoths invaded Iberia in 418. They almost wiped out the Alans and Silingi Vandals who voluntarily subjected themselves to the rule of Hasdingian leader Gunderic. Gunderic was then pushed from Gallaecia to Baetica by a Roman-Suebi coalition in 419. In 429, under king Genseric (reigned 428–477), the Vandals entered North Africa. By 439 they established a kingdom which included the Roman province of Africa as well as Sicily, Corsica, Sardinia, Malta and the Balearic Islands. They fended off several Roman attempts to recapture the African province, and sacked the city of Rome in 455. Their kingdom collapsed in the Vandalic War of 533–534, in which Emperor Justinian I&#x27;s forces reconquered the province for the Eastern Roman Empire.

As the Vandals plundered Rome for fourteen days, Renaissance and early-modern writers characterized the Vandals as prototypical barbarians. This led to the use of the term &quot;vandalism&quot; to describe any pointless destruction, particularly the &quot;barbarian&quot; defacing of artwork. However, some modern historians have emphasised the role of Vandals as continuators of aspects of Roman culture, in the transitional period from Late Antiquity to the Early Middle Ages.

== Name ==

The ethnonym is attested as &quot;Wandali&quot; and &quot;Wendilenses&quot; by Saxo, as &quot;Vendill&quot; in Old Norse, and as &quot;Wend(e)las&quot; in Old English, all going back to a Proto-Germanic form reconstructed as *&quot;Wanđilaz&quot;. The etymology of the name remains unclear. According to linguist Vladimir Orel, it may stem from the Proto-Germanic adjective *&quot;wanđaz&quot; (&#x27;turned, twisted&#x27;), itself derived from the verb *&quot;wenđanan&quot; (or &quot;*winđanan&quot;), meaning &#x27;to wind&#x27;. Alternatively, it has been derived from a root *&quot;wanđ-&quot;, meaning &#x27;water&#x27;, based on the idea that the tribe was originally located near the Limfjord (a sea inlet in Denmark). The stem can also be found in Old High German &quot;wentilsēo&quot; and Old English &quot;wendelsǣ&quot;, both literally meaning &#x27;Vandal-sea&#x27; and designating the Mediterranean Sea.

The Germanic mythological figure of &quot;Aurvandill&quot; has been interpreted by Rudolf Much to mean &#x27;Shining Vandal&#x27;. Much forwarded the theory that the tribal name &quot;Vandal&quot; reflects worship of Aurvandil or the Divine Twins, possibly involving an origin myth that the Vandalic kings were descended from Aurvandil (comparable to the case of many other Germanic tribal names).

Some medieval authors equated two classical ethnonyms, &quot;Vandals&quot; and Veneti, and applied both to West Slavs, leading to the term Wends, which has been used for various Slavic-speaking groups and is still used for Lusatians. However, modern scholars derive &quot;Wend&quot; from &quot;Veneti&quot;, and do not equate the Veneti and Vandals.

The name of the Vandals has been connected to that of Vendel, the name of a province in Uppland, Sweden, which is also eponymous of the Vendel Period of Swedish prehistory, corresponding to the late Germanic Iron Age leading up to the Viking Age. The connection is considered tenuous at best and more plausibly the result of chance, though Scandinavia is considered the probable homeland of the tribe prior to the Migration Period.

==Classification==
As the Vandals eventually came to live outside of Germania, they were not considered &quot;Germani&quot; by ancient Roman authors. Neither another East Germanic-speaking group, the Goths, nor Norsemen (early Scandinavians), were counted among the &quot;Germani&quot; by the Romans.

Since the Vandals spoke a Germanic language (mainly:Vandalic) and belonged to early Germanic culture, they are classified as a Germanic people by modern scholars.

==History==
===Origins===

====Early classical sources====
The earliest mention of the Vandals is from Pliny the Elder, who used the term &quot;Vandili&quot; in a broad way to define one of the major groupings of all Germanic peoples. Tribes within this category who he mentions are the Burgundiones, Varini, Carini (otherwise unknown), and the Gutones.

Tacitus mentioned the &quot;Vandilii&quot;, but only in a passage explaining legends about the origins of the Germanic peoples. He names them as one of the groups sometimes thought to be one of the oldest divisions of these peoples, along with the Marsi, Gambrivii, Suebi but does not say where they live, or which peoples are within this category. On the other hand, Tacitus and Ptolemy give information about the position of Varini, Burgundians, and Gutones in this period, and these indications suggest that the Vandals in this period lived between the Oder and Vistula rivers.

Ptolemy furthermore mentioned the Silingi who were later counted as Vandals, as living south of the Semnones, who were Suebians living on the Elbe, and stretching to the Oder.

The Hasdingi, who later led the invasion of Carthage, do not appear in written records until the 2nd century and the time of the Marcomannic wars. The Lacringi appear in 3rd century records.

====Lugii====

The Lugii, who were also mentioned in early classical sources in the same region, are likely to have been the same people as the Vandals. The Lugii are mentioned by Strabo, Tacitus and Ptolemy as a large group of tribes between the Vistula and the Oder. Strabo and Ptolemy do not mention the Vandals at all, only the Lugii, Tacitus mentions them in a passage about the ancestry of the Germanic peoples without saying where they lived, and Pliny the Elder in contrast mentions the Vandals but not the Lugii. Walter Pohl and Walter Goffart have noted that Ptolemy seems to distinguish the Silingi from the Lugii, and in the 2nd century the Hasdings, when they appear in the Roman record, are also distinguished from the Lugii. Herwig Wolfram notes that &quot;In all likelihood the Lugians and the Vandals were one cultic community that lived in the same region of the Oder in Silesia, where it was first under Celtic and then under Germanic domination.&quot; This may account for the differentiation between the Celtic Lugii and their more Germanic successors the Vandals.

====Przeworsk culture====

In archaeology, the Vandals are associated with the Przeworsk culture, but the culture probably extended over several central and eastern European peoples. Their origin, ethnicity and linguistic affiliation are heavily debated. The bearers of the Przeworsk culture mainly practiced cremation and occasionally inhumation.

====Language====

Very little is known about the Vandalic language itself, but it is believed to be of the extinct East Germanic linguistic branch, like Gothic. The Goths left behind the only text corpus of the East Germanic language type, especially a 4th-century translation of the Gospels.

===Introduction into the Roman Empire===

In the 2nd century, two or three distinct Vandal peoples came to the attention of Roman authors, the Silingi, the Hasdingi, and possibly the Lacringi, who appear together with the Hasdingi. Only the Silingi had been mentioned in early Roman works, and are associated with Silesia.

These peoples appeared during the Marcomannic Wars, which resulted in widespread destruction and the first invasion of Italy in the Roman Empire period. During the Marcomannic Wars (166–180) the Hasdingi (or Astingi), led by the kings Raus and Rapt (or Rhaus and Raptus) moved south, entering Dacia as allies of Rome. However they eventually caused problems in Dacia and moved further south, towards the lower Danube area. Together with the Hasdingi were the Lacringi, who were possibly also Vandals.

In about 271 AD the Roman Emperor Aurelian was obliged to protect the middle course of the Danube against Vandals. They made peace and stayed on the eastern bank of the Danube.

In 278, Zosimus reported that emperor Probus had defeated the Vandals and Burgundians near a river (sometimes proposed to be the Lech, and sent many of them to Britain. During this same period, the 11th panegyric to Maximian delivered in 291, reported two different conflicts outside the empire wherein Burgundians were associated with Alamanni, and other Vandals, probably Hasdingi in the Carpathian region, were associated with Gepids.
According to Jordanes&#x27; &quot;Getica&quot;, the Hasdingi came into conflict with the Goths around the time of Constantine the Great. At the time, these Vandals were living in lands later inhabited by the Gepids, where they were surrounded &quot;on the east [by] the Goths, on the west [by] the Marcomanni, on the north [by] the Hermanduri and on the south [by] the Hister (Danube).&quot; The Vandals were attacked by the Gothic king Geberic, and their king Visimar was killed. The Vandals then migrated to neighbouring Pannonia, where, after Constantine the Great (in about 330) granted them lands on the right bank of the Danube, they lived for the next sixty years.

In the late 4th century and early 5th, the famous &quot;magister militum&quot; Stilicho (died 408), the chief minister of the Emperor Honorius, was described as being of Vandal descent. Vandals raided the Roman province of Raetia in the winter of 401/402. From this, historian Peter Heather concludes that at this time the Vandals were located in the region around the Middle and Upper Danube. It is possible that such Middle Danubian Vandals were part of the Gothic king Radagaisus&#x27; invasion of Italy in 405–406 AD.

While the Hasdingian Vandals were already established in the Middle Danube for centuries, it is less clear where the Silingian Vandals had been living though it may have been in Silesia.

===In Britannia===

In AD 278, Emperor Probus on defeating the Vandals and Burgundians, transferred many of them to Britain. It is unknown where they were settled, though Silchester seems to be a likely candidate. The city bears the name of the Silingi, is only one of six that existed in Roman Britain that did not survive the Sub-Roman era, and appears to have been ritually cursed – likely by the Anglo-Saxons – before being abandoned.

===In Gaul===
In 405 AD the Vandals advanced from Pannonia travelling west along the Danube without much difficulty, but when they reached the Rhine, they met resistance from the Franks, who populated and controlled Romanized regions in northern Gaul. According to the Frigeridus fragment cited by Gregory of Tours, around 20,000 Vandals, including Godigisel himself, died in this Vandal-Frankish war, but then with the help of the Alans they managed to defeat the Franks, and on December 31, 405 the Vandals crossed the Rhine, probably while it was frozen, to invade Gaul, which they devastated terribly. Under Godigisel&#x27;s son Gunderic, the Vandals plundered their way westward and southward through Aquitaine.

===In Hispania===
On October 13, 409 they crossed the Pyrenees into the Iberian peninsula. There, the Hasdingi received land from the Romans, as foederati, in Asturia (Northwest) and the Silingi in Hispania Baetica (South), while the Alans got lands in Lusitania (West) and the region around Carthago Nova. The Suebi also controlled part of Gallaecia. The Visigoths, who invaded Iberia on the orders of the Romans before receiving lands in Septimania (Southern France), crushed the Silingi Vandals in 417 and the Alans in 418, killing the western Alan king Attaces. The remainder of his people and the remnants of the Silingi, who were nearly wiped out, subsequently appealed to the Vandal king Gunderic to accept the Alan crown. Later Vandal kings in North Africa styled themselves &quot;Rex Wandalorum et Alanorum&quot; (&quot;King of the Vandals and Alans&quot;). In 419 AD the Hasdingi Vandals were defeated by a joint Roman-Suebi coalition. Gunderic fled to Baetica, where he was also proclaimed king of the Silingi Vandals. In 422, Gunderic decisively defeated a Roman-Suebi-Gothic coalition led by the Roman patrician Castinus at the Battle of Tarraco. It is likely that many Roman and Gothic troops deserted to Gunderic following the battle. For the next five years, according to Hydatius, Gunderic created widespread havoc in the western Mediterranean. In 425, the Vandals pillaged the Balearic Islands, Hispania and Mauritania, sacking Cartagena and Seville in 425. The capture of the maritime city of Cartagena enabled the Vandals to engage in widespread naval activities. In 428 Gunderic captured Seville for a second time but died while laying siege to the city&#x27;s church. He was succeeded by his half-brother Genseric, who although he was illegitimate (his mother was a slave) had held a prominent position at the Vandal court, rising to the throne unchallenged. In 429, the Vandals departed Spain which remained almost totally in Roman hands until 439, when the Sueves, confined to Gallaecia moved south and captured Emerita Augusta (Mérida), the see city of Roman administration for the whole peninsula.

Genseric is often regarded by historians as the most able barbarian leader of the Migration Period. Michael Frassetto writes that he probably contributed more to the destruction of Rome than any of his contemporaries. Although the barbarians controlled Hispania, they still comprised a tiny minority among a much larger Hispano-Roman population, approximately 200,000 out of 6,000,000. Shortly after seizing the throne, Genseric was attacked from the rear by a large force of Suebi under the command of Heremigarius who had managed to take Lusitania. This Suebi army was defeated near Mérida and its leader Hermigarius drowned in the Guadiana River while trying to flee.

It is possible that the name &quot;Al-Andalus&quot; (and its derivative &quot;Andalusia&quot;) is derived from the Arabic adoption of the name of the Vandals.

===Kingdom in North Africa===
==== Establishment ====

The Vandals under Genseric (also known as Geiseric) crossed to Africa in 429. Although numbers are unknown and some historians debate the validity of estimates, based on Procopius&#x27; assertion that the Vandals and Alans numbered 80,000 when they moved to North Africa, Peter Heather estimates that they could have fielded an army of around 15,000–20,000.

According to Procopius, the Vandals came to Africa at the request of Bonifacius, the military ruler of the region. Seeking to establish himself as an independent ruler in Africa or even become Roman Emperor, Bonifacius had defeated several Roman attempts to subdue him, until he was mastered by the newly appointed Gothic count of Africa, Sigisvult, who captured both Hippo Regius and Carthage. It is possible that Bonifacius had sought Genseric as an ally against Sigisvult, promising him a part of Africa in return.

Advancing eastwards along the coast, the Vandals were confronted on the Numidian border in May–June 430 by Bonifacius. Negotiations broke down, and Bonifacius was soundly defeated. Bonifacius subsequently barricaded himself inside Hippo Regius with the Vandals besieging the city. Inside, Saint Augustine and his priests prayed for relief from the invaders, knowing full well that the fall of the city would spell conversion or death for many Roman Christians.

On 28 August 430, three months into the siege, St. Augustine (who was 75 years old) died, perhaps from starvation or stress, as the wheat fields outside the city lay dormant and unharvested. The death of Augustine shocked the Regent of the Western Roman Empire, Galla Placidia, who feared the consequences if her realm lost its most important source of grain. She raised a new army in Italy and convinced her nephew in Constantinople, the Eastern Roman Emperor Theodosius II, to send an army to North Africa led by Aspar.

Around July–August 431, Genseric raised the siege of Hippo Regius, which enabled Bonifacius to retreat from Hippo Regius to Carthage, where he was joined by Aspar&#x27;s army. During the summer of 432, Genseric soundly defeated the joint forces of both Bonifacius and Aspar, which enabled him to seize Hippo Regius unopposed. Genseric and Aspar subsequently negotiated a peace treaty of some sorts. Upon seizing Hippo Regius, Genseric made it the first capital of the Vandal kingdom.

The Romans and the Vandals concluded a treaty in 435 giving the Vandals control of the Mauretania and the western half of Numidia. Genseric chose to break the treaty in 439 when he invaded the province of Africa Proconsularis and seized Carthage on October 19. The city was captured without a fight; the Vandals entered the city while most of the inhabitants were attending the races at the hippodrome. Genseric made it his capital, and styled himself the King of the Vandals and Alans, to denote the inclusion of the Alans of northern Africa into his alliance. His forces also occupied Sardinia, Corsica and the Balearic Islands. His siege of Palermo in 440 was a failure as was the second attempt to invade Sicily near Agrigento in 442 (the Vandals occupied the island from 468 to 476 when it was ceded to Odovacer). Historian Cameron suggests that the new Vandal rule may not have been unwelcomed by the population of North Africa as the great landowners were generally unpopular.

The impression given by ancient sources such as Victor of Vita, Quodvultdeus, and Fulgentius of Ruspe was that the Vandal take-over of Carthage and North Africa led to widespread destruction. However, recent archaeological investigations have challenged this assertion. Although Carthage&#x27;s Odeon was destroyed, the street pattern remained the same and some public buildings were renovated. The political centre of Carthage was the Byrsa Hill. New industrial centres emerged within towns during this period. Historian Andy Merrills uses the large amounts of African Red Slip ware discovered across the Mediterranean dating from the Vandal period of North Africa to challenge the assumption that the Vandal rule of North Africa was a time of economic instability. When the Vandals raided Sicily in 440, the Western Roman Empire was too preoccupied with war with Gaul to react. Theodosius II, emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, dispatched an expedition to deal with the Vandals in 441; however, it only progressed as far as Sicily. The Western Empire under Valentinian III secured peace with the Vandals in 442. Under the treaty the Vandals gained Byzacena, Tripolitania, and the eastern half of Numidia, and were confirmed in control of Proconsular Africa as well as the Vandal Kingdom as the first barbarian kingdom was officially recognized as an independent kingdom in former Roman territory instead of foederati. The Empire retained western Numidia and the two Mauretanian provinces until 455.

====Sack of Rome====
During the next thirty-five years, with a large fleet, Genseric looted the coasts of the Eastern and Western Empires. Vandal activity in the Mediterranean was so substantial that the sea&#x27;s name in Old English was &quot;Wendelsæ&quot; (i. e. Sea of the Vandals). After Attila the Hun&#x27;s death, however, the Romans could afford to turn their attention back to the Vandals, who were in control of some of the richest lands of their former empire.

In an effort to bring the Vandals into the fold of the Empire, Valentinian III offered his daughter&#x27;s hand in marriage to Genseric&#x27;s son. Before this treaty could be carried out, however, politics again played a crucial part in the blunders of Rome. Petronius Maximus killed Valentinian III and claimed the Western throne. Petronius then forced Valentinian III&#x27;s widow, empress Licinia Eudoxia, to marry him. Diplomacy between the two factions broke down, and in 455 with a letter from Licinia Eudoxia, begging Genseric&#x27;s son to rescue her, the Vandals took Rome, along with the Empress and her daughters Eudocia and Placidia.

The chronicler Prosper of Aquitaine offers the only fifth-century report that, on 2 June 455, Pope Leo the Great received Genseric and implored him to abstain from murder and destruction by fire, and to be satisfied with pillage. Whether the pope&#x27;s influence saved Rome is, however, questioned. The Vandals departed with countless valuables. Eudoxia and her daughter Eudocia were taken to North Africa.

====Consolidation====

In 456 a Vandal fleet of 60 ships threatening both Gaul and Italy was ambushed and defeated at Agrigentum and Corsica by the Western Roman general Ricimer. In 457 a mixed Vandal-Berber army returning with loot from a raid in Campania were soundly defeated in a surprise attack by Western Emperor Majorian at the mouth of the Garigliano river.
As a result of the Vandal sack of Rome and piracy in the Mediterranean, it became important to the Roman Empire to destroy the Vandal kingdom. In 460, Majorian launched an expedition against the Vandals, but was defeated at the Battle of Cartagena. In 468 the Western and Eastern Roman empires launched an enormous expedition against the Vandals under the command of Basiliscus, which reportedly was composed of 100,000 soldiers and 1,000 ships. The Vandals defeated the invaders at the Battle of Cap Bon, capturing the Western fleet, and destroying the Eastern through the use of fire ships. Following up the attack, the Vandals tried to invade the Peloponnese, but were driven back by the Maniots at Kenipolis with heavy losses. In retaliation, the Vandals took 500 hostages at Zakynthos, hacked them to pieces and threw the pieces overboard on the way to Carthage. In 469 the Vandals gained control of Sicily but were forced by Odoacer to relinquish it in 477 except for the western port of Lilybaeum (lost in 491 after a failed attempt on their part to re-take the island).

In the 470s, the Romans abandoned their policy of war against the Vandals. The Western general Ricimer reached a treaty with them, and in 476 Genseric was able to conclude a &quot;perpetual peace&quot; with Constantinople. Relations between the two states assumed a veneer of normality. From 477 onwards, the Vandals produced their own coinage, restricted to bronze and silver low-denomination coins. The high-denomination imperial money was retained, demonstrating in the words of Merrills &quot;reluctance to usurp the imperial prerogative&quot;.

Although the Vandals had fended off attacks from the Romans and established hegemony over the islands of the western Mediterranean, they were less successful in their conflict with the Berbers. Situated south of the Vandal kingdom, the Berbers inflicted two major defeats on the Vandals in the period 496–530.

====Domestic religious tensions====
Differences between the Arian Vandals and their Trinitarian subjects (including both Catholics and Donatists) were a constant source of tension in their African state. Catholic bishops were exiled or killed by Genseric and laymen were excluded from office and frequently suffered confiscation of their property. He protected his Catholic subjects when his relations with Rome and Constantinople were friendly, as during the years 454–457, when the Catholic community at Carthage, being without a head, elected Deogratias bishop. The same was also the case during the years 476–477 when Bishop Victor of Cartenna sent him, during a period of peace, a sharp refutation of Arianism and suffered no punishment. Huneric, Genseric&#x27;s successor, issued edicts against Catholics in 483 and 484 in an effort to marginalise them and make Arianism the primary religion in North Africa. Generally most Vandal kings, except Hilderic, persecuted Trinitarian Christians to a greater or lesser extent, banning conversion for Vandals, exiling bishops and generally making life difficult for Trinitarians.

====Decline====
According to the 1913 &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;: &quot;Genseric, one of the most powerful personalities of the &quot;era of the Migrations&quot;, died on 25 January 477, at the great age of around 88 years. According to the law of succession which he had promulgated, the oldest male member of the royal house was to succeed. Thus he was succeeded by his son Huneric (477–484), who at first tolerated Catholics, owing to his fear of Constantinople, but after 482 began to persecute Manichaeans and Catholics.&quot;

Gunthamund (484–496), his cousin and successor, sought internal peace with the Catholics and ceased persecution once more. Externally, the Vandal power had been declining since Genseric&#x27;s death, and Gunthamund lost early in his reign all but a small wedge of western Sicily to the Ostrogoths which was lost in 491 and had to withstand increasing pressure from the Moors.

According to the 1913 &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;: &quot;While Thrasamund (496–523), owing to his religious fanaticism, was hostile to Catholics, he contented himself with bloodless persecutions&quot;.

====Turbulent end====
Hilderic (523–530) was the Vandal king most tolerant towards the Catholic Church. He granted it religious freedom; consequently, Catholic synods were once more held in North Africa. However, he had little interest in war, and left it to a family member, Hoamer. When Hoamer suffered a defeat against the Moors, the Arian faction within the royal family led a revolt, raising the banner of national Arianism, and his cousin Gelimer (530–534) became king. Hilderic, Hoamer and their relatives were thrown into prison.

Byzantine Emperor Justinian I declared war, with the stated intention of restoring Hilderic to the Vandal throne. The deposed Hilderic was murdered in 533 on Gelimer&#x27;s orders. While an expedition was en route, a large part of the Vandal army and navy was led by Tzazo, Gelimer&#x27;s brother, to Sardinia to deal with a rebellion. As a result, the armies of the Byzantine Empire commanded by Belisarius were able to land unopposed from Carthage. Gelimer quickly assembled an army, and met Belisarius at the Battle of Ad Decimum; the Vandals were winning the battle until Gelimer&#x27;s brother Ammatas and nephew Gibamund fell in battle. Gelimer then lost heart and fled. Belisarius quickly took Carthage while the surviving Vandals fought on.

On December 15, 533, Gelimer and Belisarius clashed again at the Battle of Tricamarum, some from Carthage. Again, the Vandals fought well but broke, this time when Gelimer&#x27;s brother Tzazo fell in battle. Belisarius quickly advanced to Hippo, second city of the Vandal Kingdom, and in 534 Gelimer surrendered to the Byzantine conqueror, ending the Kingdom of the Vandals.

North Africa, comprising north Tunisia and eastern Algeria in the Vandal period, became a Roman province again, from which the Vandals were expelled. Many Vandals went to Saldae (today called Béjaïa in north Algeria) where they integrated themselves with the Berbers. Many others were put into imperial service or fled to the two Gothic kingdoms (Ostrogothic Kingdom and Visigothic Kingdom). Some Vandal women married Byzantine soldiers and settled in north Algeria and Tunisia. The choicest Vandal warriors were formed into five cavalry regiments, known as &quot;Vandali Iustiniani&quot;, stationed on the Persian frontier. Some entered the private service of Belisarius. The 1913 &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; states that &quot;Gelimer was honourably treated and received large estates in Galatia. He was also offered the rank of a patrician but had to refuse it because he was not willing to change his Arian faith&quot;. In the words of historian Roger Collins: &quot;The remaining Vandals were then shipped back to Constantinople to be absorbed into the imperial army. As a distinct ethnic unit they disappeared&quot;. Some of the few Vandals remained at North Africa while more migrated back to Spain. In 546 the Vandalic Dux of Numidia, Guntarith, defected from the Byzantines and raised a rebellion with Moorish support. He was able to capture Carthage, but was assassinated by the Byzantines shortly afterwards.

==List of kings==

* Gelimer (530–534)

==Family tree of the kings of Vandals==
 



==Latin literacy==
All Vandals that modern historians know about were able to speak Latin, which also remained the official language of the Vandal administration (most of the staff seem to have been native Berber or Roman). Levels of literacy in the ancient world are uncertain, but writing was integral to administration and business. Studies of literacy in North Africa have tended to centre around the administration, which was limited to the social elite. However, the majority of the population of North Africa did not live in urban centres.

Judith George explains that &quot;Analysis of the [Vandal] poems in their context holds up a mirror to the ways and values of the times&quot;. Very little work of the poets of Vandal North Africa survives, but what does is found in the &quot;Latin Anthology&quot;; apart from their names, little is known about the poets themselves, not even when they were writing. Their work drew on earlier Roman traditions. Modern scholars generally hold the view that the Vandals allowed the Romans in North Africa to carry on with their way of life with only occasional interference.

==Legacy==

Since the Middle Ages, kings of Denmark were styled &quot;King of Denmark, the Goths and the Wends&quot;, the Wends being a group of West Slavs formerly living in Mecklenburg and eastern Holstein in modern Germany. The title &quot;King of the Wends&quot; is translated as &quot;vandalorum rex&quot; in Latin. The title was shortened to &quot;King of Denmark&quot; in 1972. Starting in 1540, Swedish kings (following Denmark) were styled &quot;Suecorum, Gothorum et Vandalorum Rex&quot; (&quot;King of the Swedes, Geats, and Wends&quot;). Carl XVI Gustaf dropped the title in 1973 and now styles himself simply as &quot;King of Sweden&quot;.

The modern term &quot;vandalism&quot; stems from the Vandals&#x27; reputation as the barbarian people who sacked and looted Rome in AD 455. The Vandals were probably not any more destructive than other invaders of ancient times, but writers who idealized Rome often blamed them for its destruction. For example, English Restoration poet John Dryden wrote, &quot;Till Goths, and Vandals, a rude Northern race, / Did all the matchless Monuments deface&quot;.
The term &quot;Vandalisme&quot; was coined in 1794 by Henri Grégoire, bishop of Blois, to describe the destruction of artwork following the French Revolution. The term was quickly adopted across Europe. This new use of the term was important in colouring the perception of the Vandals from later Late Antiquity, popularizing the pre-existing idea that they were a barbaric group with a taste for destruction. Vandals and other &quot;barbarian&quot; groups had long been blamed for the fall of the Roman Empire by writers and historians.

<doc id="46522" wikidata="Q4863050" url="?curid=46522" title="Baroque chess">
<text>Baroque chess is a chess variant invented in 1962 by Robert Abbott. In 1963, at the suggestion of his publisher, he changed the name to Ultima, by which name it is also known. Abbott later considered his invention flawed and suggested amendments to the rules, but these suggestions have been substantially ignored by the gaming community, which continues to play by the 1962 rules. Since the rules for Baroque were first laid down in 1962, some regional variation has arisen, causing the game to diverge from Ultima. 
==Description==
Baroque chess is usually played on a standard 8×8 chessboard with the standard Staunton design of chess pieces. The rules that follow are widely found on the internet, but other variants exist. One variant was popular among students at Cambridge University in 1974. The initial setup of the pieces is the same as in standard chess, except for two things that the players must first decide on – center counter symmetry, and corner counter symmetry.

===Establishing the degree of symmetry===
Center counter symmetry allows either player to decide whether to switch his king and Withdrawer (&quot;queen&quot;) around, and then corner counter symmetry requires each player to decide which of his &quot;rooks&quot; will be turned upside down. (The one that remains upright is the Coordinator, and the one that is turned upside down is the Immobilizer.) After these two kinds of symmetries are determined, White moves first.

For purposes of recording the moves that are played in the game, it is sufficient to employ an algebraic form of notation, as in chess, and write the names of the pieces and the squares they are to be placed in. For instance, 1. Kd1 &amp; We1, Ke8 &amp; Wd8 (center counter symmetry), and 2. Ia1 &amp; Ch1, Ih8 &amp; Ca8 (corner counter symmetry).

If the symmetry resolution phases that are usually found at the start of the game could somehow be put off for later, then one may readily see how similar they are to the castling maneuvers in chess. They have the practical function of multiplying the number of games that are possible from the initial starting position.

===Moving===
In Baroque, the king is the one piece alone that is limited to moving exactly one square at a time; it moves and takes just like the king in chess. All of the remaining pieces on the first rank may move like the queen, in all directions. They have this power as a matter of privilege, as they are all considered to be &quot;noble pieces.&quot; This is a kind of privilege that attaches to them at birth, that is, at the outset of the game, and is never diminished; they retain this privilege no matter where they go, except when they find themselves next to an Immobilizer (see below).

The pawns, on the other hand, move just like the rook moves in chess, unable to move diagonally. Just as in chess, pawns are the peasants of this game. Unlike chess, pawns are never promoted to another kind of piece. (There is no special square to which pawns can be moved and then promoted.)

===Capturing===
All the pieces except for the king capture differently from their counterparts in chess, and all but the king and pawn have different names. The king is the only piece that captures, as chess pieces do, by moving into a square that is occupied by an enemy piece. All the other pieces capture enemy pieces in more complex ways. Friendly pieces are never allowed to capture other friendly pieces.

==Pieces==

The names of the pieces and rules for movement are as follows:

*The king moves and captures like a standard chess king. There is no castling. The objective of the game is to capture the opposing king. Fast play with a chess clock usually makes declaration of checkmate a very rare thing to achieve in actual face to face play.
*The pawns (or &quot;pincers&quot; or &quot;squeezers&quot;) move like standard chess rooks. A pawn captures any opposing piece horizontally or vertically between the square to which the pawn moved and a friendly piece (i.e. there may be no gaps between any of the three pieces). This is considered a &quot;custodial&quot; form of capture because it has been likened to two men coming up on the sides of the person to be seized, and taking hold of his arms to carry him off. Pawns never capture diagonally, only horizontally or vertically. It also moves the same as the pawn in Hasami shogi.

The remaining pieces all move like standard chess queens, but have unique methods of capture.

*The &quot;Withdrawer&quot; (or &quot;Retreater&quot;), represented by the queen, captures by moving directly away from an adjacent piece.
*The &quot;Long-leapers&quot;, represented by the knights, capture by jumping over an opposing piece in a straight line. A long-leaper may make multiple captures in the same line as long as each piece is jumped independently. Those variants of Baroque prohibiting multiple leaps call this piece the &quot;Leaper&quot;, and restrict it to capturing the first enemy piece it encounters, provided the next space is empty or open. It appears that the choice between a Long-leaper and a Single-leaper tends to affect game play by encouraging &quot;hunkering down&quot; and overdefending pieces, and allowing pieces to spread across the board more, with less attention to bulky blockades.
*The &quot;Coordinator&quot;, represented by the unmarked rook, captures any opposing piece that is on either of the two squares found at the intersection of its own file and the king&#x27;s rank, and the intersection of the king&#x27;s file and its own rank; these are found after the Coordinator has moved.
*The &quot;Immobilizer&quot; (or &quot;Freezer&quot;), represented by the inverted rook, does not capture anything, but immobilizes all adjacent enemy pieces.
*The &quot;Imitators&quot; (or &quot;Chameleons&quot;), represented by the bishops, capture any piece by moving as a piece of the type captured would have moved to capture. Also Imitators or Chameleons immobilize enemy Immobilizers to which they are adjacent. Imitators cannot capture Imitators. In order for an Imitator to capture an enemy king, it must begin its turn adjacent to it, and step into its square. This is because the king is the only piece on the board that steps one square at a time, and captures by &#x27;occupation&#x27; and &#x27;replacement&#x27; – stepping into the enemy&#x27;s square to capture it.

Diagrammed examples are indispensable to understanding the rules.

===King===

The white king moves Kc4-d5 delivering checkmate. Normally it would not be possible for the two kings to be adjacent, but here the black king is unable to move due to the white immobilizer on f4, thus the d5 square is not under attack by black, and the white king is not moving into check.

Note that White could not play Kc4-d4, as that would place his own king in check from the black Withdrawer. Capturing the Withdrawer with Kc4xd3 would result in stalemate, as black would then have no legal moves.
===Pawn/Pincer===

The white pawn (or &quot;Pincer&quot;) moves Pg4-d4, capturing the black Immobilizer and black pawn. The &quot;Pincer&quot; moves as the pawn in Hasami shogi. The black Withdrawer on e5 is not captured because pawns capture only vertically and horizontally, not diagonally. The black Imitator (Chameleon) on d3 is not captured, because there is no white piece on d2. Finally, the black Long-leaper on g3 was safe because it moved between the two white pawns, rather than a white pawn moving to complete the custodial capture.
===Withdrawer===

The white Withdrawer moves Wg6-d3, capturing the black pawn on h7. The pawn on g7 and the Imitator (Chameleon) on h6 are unaffected because the Withdrawer did not move in their respective lines, but the Withdrawer could have captured either by a move in the g-file or sixth rank respectively. Note that the Withdrawer also gives check to the black king by threatening to move away on the d-file.
===Long-Leaper===

The white Long-Leaper moves Ld2-d4-d6-d8, capturing three black pieces. It might instead have captured the black Withdrawer with either Ld2-g5 or Ld2-h6. On the other hand, the black pawn on b2 and the black Chameleon on d1 are safe from the Long Leaper because there is no square on the opposite side on which the Long Leaper could land. Also the black pawns on f2 and g2 cannot be captured by Ld2-h2, because there is no space in between the two pawns which would allow the Long Leaper to make two separate jumps. A move of Ld2-b4 would be illegal because long leapers may not jump over friendly pieces. Some variations of Baroque forbid multi-leaping, if only because it is felt that the game is more playable if the Leaper is less powerful. By requiring the Leaper to stop its movement immediately after capturing the first piece, that objective is met.
===Coordinator===

The white Coordinator moves Cd4-f6, capturing black&#x27;s Leaper on c6 and Immobilizer on f2. If White had played Cd4-d6 instead, he would have captured black&#x27;s Leaper and pawn. The Coordinator threatens only pieces on the same rank or file as the friendly king. This kind of capture can be visualized by imagining an invisible cross emanating from the square the king is sitting on, and another invisible cross emanating from the square the Coordinator arrives at. The points where these two crosses intersect are the places where captures are possible.
===Immobilizer===

The white Immobilizer moves If3-d5, immobilizing five black pieces. The black Leaper on g4, which had been immobilized, is now free to move again.

An Immobilizer can never be captured by an Immobilizer, or Imitator (Chameleon). An Immobilizer can never be captured by a king or Withdrawer unless the variation popular in Cambridge is being played, in which case the Immobilizer itself must first be immobilized. When an Immobilizer comes into contact with an enemy Chameleon or Immobilizer, the two pieces freeze each other, after which neither can move unless the other is captured. In the version played at Cambridge, the power of an enemy Immobilizer to arrest a friendly piece&#x27;s movement is defeated when another friendly Immobilizer or Chameleon is brought up to it, effectively cancelling out each other&#x27;s power to arrest movement.

Some versions of Baroque allow an immobilized piece to commit suicide, i.e. be removed from the board, in lieu of the regular move of that player. There may be strategic reasons to open a line. For example, after the above diagrammed move, the black Leaper on c5 may wish to commit suicide, so that the other Leaper can capture the white Immobilizer by jumping over it on the fifth rank. White cannot hinder this plan, because the Immobilizer is itself immobilized by the black Chameleon.

===Chameleon/Imitator===

On the adjacent diagram, the white Chameleon moves Xg6-e6-c6, capturing all seven black pieces except the king in one move and delivering check.
*It captures the black withdrawer by moving away from it.
*It captures the black long-leapers by jumping over them.
*It captures three black pawns by surrounding them. (A chameleon can only capture pawns on a horizontal move or vertical move, not on a diagonal move.)
*It captures the black coordinator by rank/file coordination with the white king.
*It delivers check by moving adjacent to the black king.
In the Cambridge rules, this capture is not possible. The move is legal, but it captures only the two leapers, because the move is not a legal move for any of the other target pieces. In the absence of the two black leapers, the same move would capture the other five pieces.

==Variants==
===Maxima===
Maxima was invented by Roberto Lavieri in 2003. It is Baroque played on a somewhat larger board that is mostly rectangular and 8×9 (a2–h10) but for a couple of extra squares that are outside the board, located at d1 and e1 just behind the king and queen&#x27;s squares. A matching pair of squares are also on the other side of the board, just beyond the black king and queen (d11 and e11). Although one objective of the game is to checkmate the king, an alternative objective allows depositing pieces in both of the pair of squares on the other side of the board. Bare king is also a win. Unlike Baroque, the king in Maxima moves like the knight in chess, and moreover treats the board as a cylinder (e.g. Kb2–h3 is a legal move), making for a game with much more fluid movement of pieces.

There are two extra pieces: Mage and Guard. The Mage moves one square diagonally, then may continue its move orthogonally away from where it started (i.e. the move of the &quot;aanca&quot; from Grant Acedrex). It captures by displacement and is immune to the Immobiliser. The Guard moves and captures like the king in chess (&quot;not&quot; like the king in Maxima).

The order of White&#x27;s pieces is:
*First rank: blank, Mage, blank, King, Withdrawer, blank, Mage, blank
*Second rank: Chameleon, Long-leaper, Coordinator, Immobiliser, Long-leaper, Chameleon
*Third rank: Guard, Pawn, Pawn, Pawn, Pawn, Pawn, Pawn, Guard

Black&#x27;s setup is mirrored from White&#x27;s, so the kings are on d2 and e10.

===Optima===
Baroque that is similar to Maxima with additional pieces and rules.

===Renaissance===
As shogi is to chess, Renaissance is to Baroque—pieces may be revived and reborn. It was invented by Matthew Monchalin in 1975. It is played on a 9×9 board; the arrangement of pieces on White&#x27;s first rank is: Immobiliser, Long-leaper, Chameleon, Withdrawer, King, Bomb, Resurrector, Pusher, Coordinator. (The arrangement of the pieces on Black&#x27;s first rank is backwards, so Immobilisers are on a1 and i9.) As in Ultima, White and Black may choose to swap Immobiliser and Coordinator. Captured pieces change sides and can be dropped back into play. The new pieces transform when captured: Pusher becomes Puller and vice versa, while Resurrector becomes Bomb and vice versa. Players may agree to have extra pieces in a queue, awaiting to enter the board. The pieces from Baroque are the same in Renaissance, except that in Renaissance the Long-leaper can only capture one man a turn.

The Resurrector (or Swapper or Ankh) moves like a queen for all ordinary purposes, but for swapping actions must move like a king, trading places with any adjacent piece (both friend or foe), never capturing it. Consistent with the concept of the Resurrector being a piece wholly incapable of killing, it can also step into any adjacent empty square, and leave behind a previously captured piece &quot;resurrected&quot; by placing it in the square just vacated. Although, seen in that light, though the Resurrector is like a piece of &quot;life,&quot; it can be transformed into a 1 square bomb when captured and readmitted to the board - but capable only of &quot;death&quot;. Instead of moving, a bomb need merely explode to effect the destruction of both friendly pieces and enemy pieces adjacent to itself, and suiciding in the process. The destruction of pieces in this way causes all affected to be unrevivable.

There are also two more pieces that, like the &quot;Coordinator,&quot; are not capable of unassisted capture: the Pusher and the Puller. They can move like queens for ordinary purposes, but for the purpose of exercising their special powers, they must be adjacent to the affected piece at the start of the turn. If they begin adjacent to a piece (regardless if friendly or foe), they can push or pull it by 1 square. For a Pusher, the empty square on the other side must be &quot;open&quot; (except for the unusual circumstance of driving a king into an enemy piece, or an Imitator into a king.) Although the Pushers and Pullers are not capable of capture, their pushing and pulling maneuvers can result in other pieces being forced to make captures, regardless of the captured one being a friendly or enemy piece. (If a Puller pulls an enemy Puller, then that enemy Puller also pulls a piece along with it.)

===Rococo===
Rococo was invented by Peter Aronson and David Howe in 2002. It is a species of Baroque that is played on a 10×10 board for the purposes of captures, but on the inner 8×8 square just inside it for the purpose of movement. To put it another way, the outer perimeter of squares can only be entered as a result of a capturing maneuver. In addition to the traditional Baroque pieces, Rococo has an Advancer piece that moves like a queen, but captures the enemy piece it has run up next to, stopping just short of the piece taken. As is usual for most pieces of the Baroque family, the Advancer will not enter into the space vacated by the captured piece, it merely runs up to it, and stops short by 1 square. Unlike the game of Renaissance described above, Rococo has a similarly named Swapper piece that moves like a queen, but trades places with the enemy it runs up to, a full queen&#x27;s move away. The Rococo Swapper has the unusual property of self-destructing at will, in lieu of moving, provided it is not at the same time immobilized, with the effect of taking one enemy piece alongside it. What sets Rococo apart from Baroque the most is the way the pawns work; they are called cannonball pawns and move like a king, stepping 1 square in all directions, or leap over any adjacent piece (friend or foe). The only way that they can effect capture is by leaping, and &quot;landing&quot; on the enemy piece. They cannot capture like a king does. Cannonball pawns can be promoted into other pieces when they reach the other side of the board.

The pawn formations unique to the parent game, Baroque, already significantly different from traditional chess, are not seen in Rococo. Instead, Rococo&#x27;s cannonball pawns seem to hang away from enemy pieces by two or three squares, rarely coming into contact with each other without advance preparation. In both chess and Baroque, however, fine nuances in maneuvering are made possible by locking positions together, made concrete by the establishment of well-defined pawn structures. This sort of thing is lacking in Rococo.

<doc id="46523" wikidata="Q151060" url="?curid=46523" title="Napoleonic Code">
<text>The Napoleonic Code (), officially the Civil Code of the French (; simply referred to as ), is the French civil code established during the French Consulate in 1804 and still in force in France, although heavily and frequently amended since its inception. Although Napoleon himself was not directly involved in the drafting of the Code, as it was drafted by a commission of four eminent jurists, he chaired many of the commission&#x27;s plenary sessions, and his support was crucial to its enactment.

The code, with its stress on clearly written and accessible law, was a major milestone in the abolition of the previous patchwork of feudal laws. Historian Robert Holtman regards it as one of the few documents that have influenced the whole world.

The Napoleonic Code was not the first legal code to be established in a European country with a civil-law legal system; it was preceded by the (Bavaria, 1756), the (Prussia, 1794), and the &quot;West Galician Code&quot; (Galicia, then part of Austria, 1797). It was, however, the first modern legal code to be adopted with a pan-European scope, and it strongly influenced the law of many of the countries formed during and after the Napoleonic Wars. The Napoleonic Code influenced developing countries outside Europe attempting to modernise and defeudalise their countries through legal reforms, such as those in the Middle East, while in Latin America the Spanish and Portuguese had established their own versions of the civil code.

==History==
The categories of the Napoleonic Code were not drawn from earlier French law, but instead from Justinian&#x27;s sixth-century codification of Roman law, the &quot;Corpus Juris Civilis&quot;, and within it, the &quot;Institutes&quot;. The &quot;Institutes&quot; divide into the law of:

# persons
# things
# actions.

Similarly, the Napoleonic Code divided the law into four sections:

# persons
# property
# acquisition of property
# civil procedure (moved into a separate code in 1806).

===Prior codification attempts===
Before the Napoleonic Code, France did not have a single set of laws; law consisted mainly of local customs, sometimes officially compiled in &quot;custumals&quot; (&quot;coutumes&quot;), notably the &quot;Custom of Paris&quot;. There were also exemptions, privileges, and special charters granted by kings or other feudal lords. With the Revolution, the last vestiges of feudalism were abolished.

Specifically, as to civil law, the many different bodies of law used in different parts of France were to be replaced by a single legal code. The Constituent Assembly on 5 October 1790 voted for a codification of French laws, the Constitution of 1791 promised one, and the National Assembly adopted a unanimous resolution on 4 September 1791 providing that &quot;there shall be a code of civil laws common for the entire realm.&quot; However, it was the National Convention in 1793 which established a special commission headed by Jean-Jacques-Régis de Cambacérès to oversee the drafting process. 

His drafts of 1793 (for which Cambacérès had been given a one month deadline), 1794, and 1796 were all rejected by a National Convention and the French Directory of the time was more preoccupied with the turmoil resulting from various wars and strife with other European powers. The first draft contained 719 articles and was very revolutionary, but was rejected for being too technical and criticised for not being radical or philosophical enough. The second, with only 297 articles, was rejected for being too brief and was criticised for being a mere manual of morals. The third, expanded to 1,104 articles, was presented under the conservative Directory regime, but never even came up for discussion.

Another commission, established in December 1799 established a fourth outline drafted in part by (1754–1813). Jacqueminot&#x27;s draft, the so-called &quot;loi Jacqueminot&quot;, dealt almost exclusively with persons and emphasised the need to reform the divorce laws, to strengthen parental authority and increase the testator&#x27;s freedom to dispose of the free portion of his estate. It was rejected.

===Napoleonic reforms===

Napoleon&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Marengo allowed him to consolidate his power in France. Returning to Paris, he appointed on 12 August 1800 a commission of distinguished jurists and politicians, including :fr:Jacques de Maleville, François Denis Tronchet, Félix-Julien-Jean Bigot de Préameneu, Jean-Étienne-Marie Portalis to draft a civil code. For this commission, Cambacérès (now Second Consul), and Napoleon himself chaired the plenary sessions. After this process finished, the Code was sent to the Legislative Body as a preliminary bill in December 1801, where it was rejected by a vote of 142 to 139. In response, Napoleon announced on 2 January 1802 that he was suspending all projects, effectively closing the assemblies&#x27; sessions; simultaneously, he went to the Sénat conservateur to berate its members. These tactics cowed the legislature into submission, and gave Napoleon the majority he needed. The code finally came into effect on 21 March 1804.

The process developed mainly out of the various customs, but was inspired by Justinian&#x27;s sixth-century codification of Roman law, the &quot;Corpus Juris Civilis&quot; and, within that, Justinian&#x27;s Code (&quot;Codex&quot;). The Napoleonic Code, however, differed from Justinian&#x27;s in important ways: 
* it incorporated all kinds of earlier rules, not just legislation; 
* it was not a collection of edited extracts, but a comprehensive rewrite; 
* its structure was much more rational; 
* it had no religious content
* it was written in the vernacular.

The Napoleonic Code marked a fundamental change in the nature of the civil law legal system, making laws clearer and more accessible. It also superseded the former conflict between royal legislative power and, particularly in the final years before the Revolution, protests by judges representing views and privileges of the social classes to which they belonged. Such conflict led the Revolutionaries to take a negative view of judges making law.

This is reflected in the Napoleonic Code provision prohibiting judges from deciding a case by way of introducing a general rule (Article 5), since the creation of general rules is an exercise of legislative and not of judicial power. In theory, there is thus no case law in France. However, the courts still had to fill in the gaps in the laws and regulations and, indeed, were prohibited from refusing to do so (Article 4). Moreover, both the code and legislation have required judicial interpretation. Thus a vast body of case law has come into existence, but without any rule of &quot;stare decisis&quot;.

==Contents of the Napoleonic Code==
The preliminary article of the code established certain important provisions regarding the rule of law. Laws could be applied only if they had been duly promulgated, and then only if they had previously been officially published (including provisions for publishing delays, given the means of communication available at the time). In brief, no secret laws were authorised. It prohibited &quot;ex post facto&quot; laws (i.e. laws that apply to events that occurred before their introduction). The code also prohibited judges from refusing to do justice on grounds of the insufficiency of the law, thereby encouraging them to interpret the law. On the other hand, it also prohibited judges from making general judgements of a legislative nature (see above).

With regard to family, the code established the supremacy of the husband over his wife and children, the &quot;status quo&quot; in Europe at the time. Women had even fewer rights than children. Divorce by mutual consent was abolished in 1804.

==Other French Napoleonic-era codes==
The draft Military Code was presented to Napoleon by the special commission headed by Pierre Daru in June 1805; however, as the War of the Third Coalition progressed, the code was put aside and never implemented.
In 1791, Louis Michel le Peletier de Saint-Fargeau presented a new criminal code to the National Constituent Assembly. He explained that it outlawed only &quot;true crimes&quot;, and not &quot;phony offences created by superstition, feudalism, the tax system, and [royal] despotism&quot;. He did not list the crimes &quot;created by superstition&quot;. The new penal code did not mention blasphemy, heresy, sacrilege, witchcraft, incest, or homosexuality, which led to these former offences being swiftly decriminalised. In 1810, a new criminal code was issued under Napoleon. As with the Penal Code of 1791, it did not contain provisions for religious crimes, incest, or homosexuality.

* After an overhaul of the entire legal system, the new code of civil procedure was adopted in 1806.

* The commercial code (&quot;&quot;) was adopted in 1807. The kernel of the commercial code is the Book III, &quot;Of The Different Modes of Acquiring Property&quot;, of the Napoleonic Code, which sets out norms for contracts and transactions.

* &quot;Code d&#x27;instruction&quot;: In 1808, the &quot;code d&#x27;instruction criminelle&quot; was published, laying out criminal procedure. The &quot;parlement&quot; system from before the Revolution, had been much abused, and the criminal courts established by the Revolution were complex and ineffective, subject to many local pressures. The genesis of this code resulted in much debate and the basis of the modern inquisitorial system of criminal courts in France and many civil law countries. It has significantly changed since, especially with regard to the rights of the defendant.

The French Revolution&#x27;s Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen enunciated the presumption of innocence until found guilty. Concerned by the possibility of arbitrary arrest and detention, or excessive remand, Napoleon remarked that care should be taken to preserve personal freedoms, especially before the Imperial Court: &quot;these courts would have a great strength, they should be prohibited from abusing this situation against weak citizens without connections.&quot; However, remand still was usual for defendants suspected of serious crimes such as murder.

The possibility of lengthy remand periods was one criticism, particularly voiced in common law countries, of the Napoleonic Code and its &quot;de facto&quot; presumption of guilt. Another reason was the combination of magistrate and prosecutor into a single role. However, with the work of the &quot;juge d&#x27;instruction&quot; accomplished, the trial itself did not have the same &quot;de jure&quot; presumption of guilt; for instance, the juror&#x27;s oath explicitly required jurors not betray the interests of the defendants or ignore their defence.

The rules governing court proceedings gave significant power to the prosecution; however, criminal justice in European countries in those days tended to repression. For instance, it was only in 1836 that prisoners charged with a felony were given a formal right to counsel in England. In comparison, article 294 of the Napoleonic Code of Criminal Procedure allowed the defendant access to a lawyer before a &quot;Cour d&#x27;assises&quot;, and mandated the court to appoint a lawyer for the defendants who did not have one. (Failing to do so nullified the proceedings.)

Whether or not the &quot;Cour d&#x27;assises&quot;, which judges severe crimes, should operate with a jury was a topic of considerable controversy. Napoleon supported jury trials (or &quot;petit jury&quot;), and they were finally adopted. On the other hand, Napoleon opposed the indictment jury (&quot;grand jury&quot; of common law countries), and preferred to assign this task to the criminal division of the Court of Appeals. Special courts were created to judge criminals who might intimidate the jury.

==French codes in the 21st century==
The French codes, now more than 60 in number, are frequently amended, as well as judicially re-interpreted. Therefore, for over a century all of the codes in force have been documented in the annually revised editions published by Dalloz (Paris). These editions consist of thorough annotations, with references to other codes, relevant statutes, judicial decisions (even if unpublished), and international instruments. The &quot;small (&quot;petit&quot;)&quot; version of the Civil Code in this form is nearly 3,000 pages, available in print and online. Additional material, including scholarly articles, is added in the larger &quot;expert (&quot;expert&quot;)&quot; version and the still larger &quot;mega (&quot;méga&quot;)&quot; version, both of which are available in print and on searchable CD-ROM. By this stage, it has been suggested, the Civil Code has become &quot;less a book than a database&quot;.

The sheer number of codes, together with digitisation, led the &quot;Commission supérieure de codification&quot; to reflect in its annual report for 2011:

The Commission observes that the age of drawing up new codes is probably reaching its end. The aim of a nearly complete codification of the law is no longer pursued, for three reasons: firstly, the technical developments by which texts are provided in non-physical form offer to users modes of access that are comparable in many ways to those available through a code; secondly, the creation of new codes encounters a kind of law of diminishing returns in that, the more progress that is made in the development of new codes, the trickier it becomes to determine in which code particular provisions should be located; and, finally, it is clear that certain kinds of provision [...] are unsuitable for codification, since codification makes sense only when it involves provisions that possess sufficient generality.

A year later, the Commission recommended that, after its current codification projects were completed, there should not be any further codes; an additional reason was government delay in publishing reforms that the Commission had completed. The government responded encouragingly in March 2013, but the Commission complains that this has not been followed through; in particular, that the government has abandoned its plan for a public service code (&quot;code général de la fonction publique&quot;).

==Codes in other countries==

Even though the Napoleonic Code was not the first civil code, it was the first modern legal code to be widely adopted in Europe, and it influenced the law of many of the countries formed during and after the Napoleonic Wars. In the German regions on the west bank of the Rhine (Rhenish Palatinate and Prussian Rhine Province), the former Duchy of Berg and the Grand Duchy of Baden, the Napoleonic Code was influential until the introduction of the &quot;Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch&quot; in 1900 as the first common civil code for the entire German Empire.

A number of factors have been shown by Arvind and Stirton to have had a determinative role in the decision by the German states to receive the code, including territorial concerns, Napoleonic control and influence, the strength of central state institutions, a feudal economy and society, rule by liberal (enlightened despotic) rulers, nativism among the governing elites, and popular anti-French sentiment.

A civil code with Napoleonic code influences was also adopted in 1864 in Romania, and remained in force until 2011. 

The term &quot;Napoleonic Code&quot; is also used to refer to legal codes of other jurisdictions that are influenced by the &quot;French Code Napoléon&quot;, especially the &quot;Civil Code of Lower Canada&quot; (replaced in 1994 by the &quot;Civil Code of Quebec&quot;), mainly derived from the &quot;Coutume de Paris&quot;, which the British continued to use in Canada following the 1763 Treaty of Paris. However, most of the laws in Latin American countries are not heavily influenced on the Napoleonic Code, as the Spanish and Portuguese versions of the civil code formed the foundation of the Latin American legal systems e.g. the Chilean, Mexican, and Puerto Rican civil codes.

In Mauritius, the Civil Code, which originates from the Napoleonic Code, represents an important primary source of law and provides for the rights of individuals, matrimonial regimes, contract law, and property law, amongst others. The French Civil Code was extended to Mauritius under the title &quot;Code Napoléon&quot; by decree of Charles Mathieu Isidore Decaen, &quot;Capitaine-General&quot;, on 21 April 1808. The Code was modified and embodied in Chapter 179 of the Revised Laws of Mauritius 1945, edited by Sir Charlton Lane, former Chief Justice of Mauritius. The 1808 decree was repealed by Act 9 of 1983, but the Revision of Laws Act which was enacted in 1974, made provision, in section 7, for the publication of the Code under the title &quot;Code Civil Mauricien.&quot;

In the United States, the legal system is largely based on English common law. But the state of Louisiana is unique in being strongly influenced by French and Spanish legal traditions in its civil code. Spanish and French colonial forces quarreled over Louisiana during most of the 1700s, with Spain ultimately ceding the territory to France in 1800, which in turn sold the territory to the United States in 1803. The 10th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution grants states control of laws not specifically given to the federal government, so Louisiana&#x27;s legal system retains many French elements. Examples of the practical legal differences between Louisiana and the other states include the bar exam and legal standards of practice for attorneys in Louisiana being significantly different from other states; Louisiana is the only U.S. state to practice forced inheritance of an estate; additionally, some of Louisiana&#x27;s laws clash with the Uniform Commercial Code practiced by the other 49 states.

<text>Wilfred Edward Salter Owen MC (18 March 1893 – 4 November 1918) was an English poet and soldier. He was one of the leading poets of the First World War. His war poetry on the horrors of trenches and gas warfare was much influenced by his mentor Siegfried Sassoon and stood in contrast to the public perception of war at the time and to the confidently patriotic verse written by earlier war poets such as Rupert Brooke. Among his best-known works – most of which were published posthumously – are &quot;Dulce et Decorum est&quot;, &quot;Insensibility&quot;, &quot;Anthem for Doomed Youth&quot;, &quot;Futility&quot;, &quot;Spring Offensive&quot; and &quot;Strange Meeting&quot;. Owen was killed in action on 4 November 1918, a week before the war&#x27;s end, at the age of 25.

==Early life==
Owen was born on 18 March 1893 at Plas Wilmot, a house in Weston Lane, near Oswestry in Shropshire. He was the eldest of Thomas and (Harriett) Susan Owen (&quot;née&quot; Shaw)&#x27;s four children; his siblings were Mary Millard, (William) Harold, and Colin Shaw Owen. At the time of Owen&#x27;s birth, his parents lived in a comfortable house owned by his grandfather, Edward Shaw.

After Edward&#x27;s death in January 1897, and the house&#x27;s sale in March, the family lodged in the back streets of Birkenhead. There Thomas Owen temporarily worked in the town employed by a railway company. Thomas transferred to Shrewsbury in April 1897 where the family lived with Thomas&#x27;s parents in Canon Street.

Thomas Owen transferred back to Birkenhead in 1898 when he became stationmaster at Woodside station. The family lived with him at three successive homes in the Tranmere district area of the town. They then moved back to Shrewsbury in 1907. Wilfred Owen was educated at the Birkenhead Institute and at Shrewsbury Technical School (later known as the Wakeman School).

Owen discovered his poetic vocation in about 1904 during a holiday spent in Cheshire. He was raised as an Anglican of the evangelical type, and in his youth was a devout believer, in part thanks to his strong relationship with his mother, which lasted throughout his life. His early influences included the Bible and the Romantic poets, particularly Wordsworth and John Keats.

Owen&#x27;s last two years of formal education saw him as a pupil-teacher at the Wyle Cop school in Shrewsbury. In 1911 he passed the matriculation exam for the University of London, but not with the first-class honours needed for a scholarship, which in his family&#x27;s circumstances was the only way he could have afforded to attend.

In return for free lodging, and some tuition for the entrance exam (this has been questioned) Owen worked as lay assistant to the Vicar of Dunsden near Reading, living in the vicarage from September 1911 to February 1913. During this time he attended classes at University College, Reading (now the University of Reading), in botany and later, at the urging of the head of the English Department, took free lessons in Old English. His time spent at Dunsden parish led him to disillusionment with the Church, both in its ceremony and its failure to provide aid for those in need.

From 1913 he worked as a private tutor teaching English and French at the Berlitz School of Languages in Bordeaux, France, and later with a family. There he met the older French poet Laurent Tailhade, with whom he later corresponded in French. When war broke out, Owen did not rush to enlist – and even considered joining the French army – but eventually returned to England.

==War service==
On 21 October 1915, he enlisted in the Artists Rifles. For the next seven months, he trained at Hare Hall Camp in Essex. On 4 June 1916, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant (on probation) in the Manchester Regiment. Initially Owen held his troops in contempt for their loutish behaviour, and in a letter to his mother described his company as &quot;expressionless lumps&quot;. However, his imaginative existence was to be changed dramatically by a number of traumatic experiences. He fell into a shell hole and suffered concussion; he was caught in the blast of a trench mortar shell and spent several days unconscious on an embankment lying amongst the remains of one of his fellow officers. Soon afterward, Owen was diagnosed with neurasthenia or shell shock and sent to Craiglockhart War Hospital in Edinburgh for treatment. It was while recuperating at Craiglockhart that he met fellow poet Siegfried Sassoon, an encounter that was to transform Owen&#x27;s life.

Whilst at Craiglockhart he made friends in Edinburgh&#x27;s artistic and literary circles, and did some teaching at the Tynecastle High School, in a poor area of the city. In November he was discharged from Craiglockhart, judged fit for light regimental duties. He spent a contented and fruitful winter in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, and in March 1918 was posted to the Northern Command Depot at Ripon. While in Ripon he composed or revised a number of poems, including &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;. His 25th birthday was spent quietly at Ripon Cathedral, which is dedicated to his namesake, St. Wilfrid of Hexham.

Owen returned in July 1918, to active service in France, although he might have stayed on home-duty indefinitely. His decision to return was probably the result of Sassoon&#x27;s being sent back to England, after being shot in the head in an apparent &quot;friendly fire&quot; incident, and put on sick-leave for the remaining duration of the war. Owen saw it as his duty to add his voice to that of Sassoon, that the horrific realities of the war might continue to be told. Sassoon was violently opposed to the idea of Owen returning to the trenches, threatening to &quot;stab [him] in the leg&quot; if he tried it. Aware of his attitude, Owen did not inform him of his action until he was once again in France.

At the very end of August 1918, Owen returned to the front line – perhaps imitating Sassoon&#x27;s example. On 1 October 1918, Owen led units of the Second Manchesters to storm a number of enemy strong points near the village of Joncourt. For his courage and leadership in the Joncourt action, he was awarded the Military Cross, an award he had always sought in order to justify himself as a war poet, but the award was not gazetted until 15 February 1919. The citation followed on 30 July 1919:

==Death==

Owen was killed in action on 4 November 1918 during the crossing of the Sambre–Oise Canal, exactly one week (almost to the hour) before the signing of the Armistice which ended the war, and was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant the day after his death. His mother received the telegram informing her of his death on Armistice Day, as the church bells in Shrewsbury were ringing out in celebration. Owen is buried at Ors Communal Cemetery, Ors, in northern France. The inscription on his gravestone, chosen by his mother Susan, is a quotation from his poetry: 

==Poetry==

Owen is regarded by many as the greatest poet of the First World War, known for his verse about the horrors of trench and gas warfare. He had been writing poetry for some years before the war, himself dating his poetic beginnings to a stay at Broxton by the Hill when he was ten years old.

The poetry of William Butler Yeats was a significant influence for Owen, but Yeats did not reciprocate Owen&#x27;s admiration, excluding him from &quot;The Oxford Book of Modern Verse&quot;, a decision Yeats later defended, saying Owen was &quot;all blood, dirt, and sucked sugar stick&quot; and &quot;unworthy of the poet&#x27;s corner of a country newspaper&quot;. Yeats elaborated: &quot;In all the great tragedies, tragedy is a joy to the man who dies ... If war is necessary in our time and place, it is best to forget its suffering as we do the discomfort of fever ...&quot;

The Romantic poets Keats and Shelley influenced much of his early writing and poetry. His great friend, the poet Siegfried Sassoon, later had a profound effect on his poetic voice, and Owen&#x27;s most famous poems (&quot;Dulce et Decorum est&quot; and &quot;Anthem for Doomed Youth&quot;) show direct results of Sassoon&#x27;s influence. Manuscript copies of the poems survive, annotated in Sassoon&#x27;s handwriting. Owen&#x27;s poetry would eventually be more widely acclaimed than that of his mentor. While his use of pararhyme with heavy reliance on assonance was innovative, he was not the only poet at the time to use these particular techniques. He was, however, one of the first to experiment with it extensively.

His poetry itself underwent significant changes in 1917. As a part of his therapy at Craiglockhart, Owen&#x27;s doctor, Arthur Brock, encouraged Owen to translate his experiences, specifically the experiences he relived in his dreams, into poetry. Sassoon, who was becoming influenced by Freudian psychoanalysis, aided him here, showing Owen through example what poetry could do. Sassoon&#x27;s use of satire influenced Owen, who tried his hand at writing &quot;in Sassoon&#x27;s style&quot;. Further, the content of Owen&#x27;s verse was undeniably changed by his work with Sassoon. Sassoon&#x27;s emphasis on realism and &quot;writing from experience&quot; was contrary to Owen&#x27;s hitherto romantic-influenced style, as seen in his earlier sonnets. Owen was to take both Sassoon&#x27;s gritty realism and his own romantic notions and create a poetic synthesis that was both potent and sympathetic, as summarised by his famous phrase &quot;the pity of war&quot;. In this way, Owen&#x27;s poetry is quite distinctive, and he is, by many, considered a greater poet than Sassoon. Nonetheless, Sassoon contributed to Owen&#x27;s popularity by his strong promotion of his poetry, both before and after Owen&#x27;s death, and his editing was instrumental in the making of Owen as a poet.

Owen&#x27;s poems had the benefit of strong patronage, and it was a combination of Sassoon&#x27;s influence, support from Edith Sitwell, and the preparation of a new and fuller edition of the poems in 1931 by Edmund Blunden that ensured his popularity, coupled with a revival of interest in his poetry in the 1960s which plucked him out of a relatively exclusive readership into the public eye. Though he had plans for a volume of verse, for which he had written a &quot;Preface&quot;, he never saw his own work published apart from those poems he included in &quot;The Hydra&quot;, the magazine he edited at Craiglockhart War Hospital, and &quot;Miners&quot;, which was published in &quot;The Nation&quot;.

There were many other influences on Owen&#x27;s poetry, including his mother. His letters to her provide an insight into Owen&#x27;s life at the front, and the development of his philosophy regarding the war. Graphic details of the horror Owen witnessed were never spared. Owen&#x27;s experiences with religion also heavily influenced his poetry, notably in poems such as &quot;Anthem for Doomed Youth&quot;, in which the ceremony of a funeral is re-enacted not in a church, but on the battlefield itself, and &quot;At a Calvary near the Ancre&quot;, which comments on the Crucifixion of Christ. Owen&#x27;s experiences in war led him further to challenge his religious beliefs, claiming in his poem &quot;Exposure&quot; that &quot;love of God seems dying&quot;.

Only five of Owen&#x27;s poems were published before his death, one in fragmentary form. His best known poems include &quot;Anthem for Doomed Youth&quot;, &quot;Futility&quot;, &quot;Dulce Et Decorum Est&quot;, &quot;The Parable of the Old Men and the Young&quot; and &quot;Strange Meeting&quot;.
However, most of them were published posthumously: &quot;Poems&quot; (1920), &quot;The Poems of Wilfred Owen&quot; (1931), &quot;The Collected Poems of Wilfred Owen&quot; (1963), &quot;The Complete Poems and Fragments&quot; (1983); fundamental in this last collection is the poem &quot;Soldier&#x27;s Dream&quot;, that deals with Owen&#x27;s conception of war.

Owen&#x27;s full unexpurgated opus is in the academic two-volume work &quot;The Complete Poems and Fragments&quot; (1994) by Jon Stallworthy. Many of his poems have never been published in popular form.

In 1975 Mrs. Harold Owen, Wilfred&#x27;s sister-in-law, donated all of the manuscripts, photographs and letters which her late husband had owned to the University of Oxford&#x27;s English Faculty Library. As well as the personal artifacts, this also includes all of Owen&#x27;s personal library and an almost complete set of &quot;The Hydra&quot; – the magazine of Craiglockhart War Hospital. These can be accessed by any member of the public on application in advance to the English Faculty librarian.

The Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin holds a large collection of Owen&#x27;s family correspondence.

==Sexuality==
Though it has been suggested that Owen hoped to marry Albertina Dauthieu, at the time living in Milnathort, Scotland, had he survived the war, Robert Graves and Sacheverell Sitwell, both of whom knew him, believed that Owen was homosexual, and that homoeroticism was a central element in much of his poetry. Through Sassoon, Owen was introduced to a sophisticated homosexual literary circle which included Oscar Wilde&#x27;s friend Robbie Ross, writer and poet Osbert Sitwell, and Scottish writer C. K. Scott Moncrieff, the translator of Marcel Proust. This contact, it is argued, broadened Owen&#x27;s outlook, and increased his confidence in incorporating homoerotic elements into his work. Historians have debated whether Owen had an affair with Scott Moncrieff in May 1918; the latter had dedicated various works to a &quot;Mr W.O.&quot;, but Owen never responded.

Throughout Owen&#x27;s lifetime and for decades after, homosexual activity between men was a punishable offence throughout the United Kingdom, and the account of Owen&#x27;s sexual development has been somewhat obscured because his brother Harold removed what he considered discreditable passages in Owen&#x27;s letters and diaries after the death of their mother. Andrew Motion wrote of Owen&#x27;s relationship with Sassoon: &quot;On the one hand, Sassoon&#x27;s wealth, posh connections and aristocratic manner appealed to the snob in Owen: on the other, Sassoon&#x27;s homosexuality admitted Owen to a style of living and thinking that he found naturally sympathetic.&quot; Sassoon, by his own account, was not actively homosexual at this time, but began his first love affair just after the war ended, in November 1918.

An important turning point in Owen scholarship occurred in 1987 when the &quot;New Statesman&quot; published the polemic &quot;The Truth Untold&quot; by Jonathan Cutbill, the literary executor of Edward Carpenter, which attacked the academic suppression of Owen as a poet of homosexual experience. Amongst the article&#x27;s contentions was that the poem &quot;Shadwell Stair&quot;, previously alleged to be mysterious, was a straightforward elegy to homosexual soliciting in an area of the London docks once renowned for it. In June 2022 the poem was included in the anthology, &quot;100 Queer Poems&quot;, compiled by Andrew McMillan and Mary Jean Chan.

==Relationship with Sassoon==
Owen held Siegfried Sassoon in an esteem not far from hero-worship, remarking to his mother that he was &quot;not worthy to light [Sassoon&#x27;s] pipe&quot;. The relationship clearly had a profound impact on Owen, who wrote in his first letter to Sassoon after leaving Craiglockhart &quot;You have fixed my life – however short&quot;. Sassoon wrote that he took &quot;an instinctive liking to him&quot;, and recalled their time together &quot;with affection&quot;. On the evening of 3 November 1917 they parted, Owen having been discharged from Craiglockhart. He was stationed on home-duty in Scarborough for several months, during which time he associated with members of the artistic circle into which Sassoon had introduced him, which included Robbie Ross and Robert Graves. He also met H. G. Wells and Arnold Bennett, and it was during this period he developed the stylistic voice for which he is now recognised. Many of his early poems were penned while stationed at the Clarence Garden Hotel, now the Clifton Hotel, in Scarborough&#x27;s North Bay. A blue plaque on the hotel marks its association with Owen.

Sassoon and Owen kept in touch through correspondence, and after Sassoon was shot in the head in July 1918 and sent back to the UK to recover, they met in August and spent what Sassoon described as &quot;the whole of a hot cloudless afternoon together.&quot; They never saw each other again. About three weeks later, Owen wrote to bid Sassoon farewell, as he was on the way back to France, and they continued to communicate. After the Armistice, Sassoon waited in vain for word from Owen, only to be told of his death several months later. The loss grieved Sassoon greatly, and he was never &quot;able to accept that disappearance philosophically.&quot; Many years later, he is said, snobbishly, to have told Stephen Spender that he found Owen&#x27;s grammar school accent &quot;embarrassing&quot;. However, in his own account of his friendship with Owen, which appeared in his 1945 autobiography, &quot;Siegfried&#x27;s Journey&quot;, Sassoon writes that Owen&#x27;s death created &quot;a chasm in my private existence&quot;, Sassoon expressed regret at what he regarded as his &quot;slowness in discovering that [Owen] was to be of high significance for me, both as a poet and friend...and there was much comfort in his companionship&quot;.

==Legacy==

===Memorials===
There are memorials to Owen at Gailly near Sailly-Laurette, Ors Communal Cemetery, near St Oswalds Church in Oswestry, Birkenhead Central Library and Shrewsbury Abbey.

On 11 November 1985, Owen was one of sixteen Great War poets commemorated on a slate stone unveiled in Westminster Abbey&#x27;s Poet&#x27;s Corner. The inscription on the stone is taken from Owen&#x27;s &quot;Preface&quot; to his poems: &quot;My subject is War, and the pity of War. The Poetry is in the pity.&quot; There is also a small museum at the Craiglockhart War Hospital, now a Napier University building, containing the &quot;War Poets Collection&quot;.

The forester&#x27;s house in Ors where Owen spent his last night, , has been transformed by Turner Prize nominee Simon Patterson into an art installation and permanent memorial to Owen and his poetry. It opened to the public on 1 October 2011.

In November 2015, actor Jason Isaacs unveiled a tribute to Owen at the former Craiglockhart War Hospital in Edinburgh where Owen was treated for shell shock during WWI.

===Owen and his work in the media===
Benjamin Britten&#x27;s &quot;War Requiem&quot;, first performed in 1962, makes extensive use of Owen&#x27;s poetry. 

Owen himself has been the subject of several fictional works, notably &quot;Not About Heroes&quot;, a play about Owen&#x27;s friendship with Siegfried Sassoon by Stephen MacDonald, first performed in 1982. 
The &quot;Regeneration&quot; Trilogy, a novel series by Pat Barker, includes the meeting and relationship between Sassoon and Owen and the death of Owen as one of its main themes.

===Wilfred Owen Association===
To commemorate Owen&#x27;s life and poetry, The Wilfred Owen Association was formed in 1989. Since its formation the Association has established permanent public memorials in Shrewsbury and Oswestry. In addition to readings, talks, visits and performances, it promotes and encourages exhibitions, conferences, awareness and appreciation of Owen&#x27;s poetry. Peter Owen, Wilfred Owen&#x27;s nephew, was President of the Association until his death in July 2018. The Association&#x27;s Patrons include Peter Florence, Rowan Williams Sir Daniel Day-Lewis and Samuel West; Grey Ruthven, 2nd Earl of Gowrie (1939–2021) was also a Patron. The Association presents a biennial Poetry Award to honour a poet for a sustained body of work that includes memorable war poems; previous recipients include Sir Andrew Motion (Poet Laureate 1999–2009), Dannie Abse, Christopher Logue, Gillian Clarke and Seamus Heaney. Owen Sheers was awarded the prize in September 2018.

<doc id="46526" wikidata="Q830193" url="?curid=46526" title="Advance-fee scam">
<text>An advance-fee scam is a form of fraud and is a common confidence trick. The scam typically involves promising the victim a significant share of a large sum of money, in return for a small up-front payment, which the fraudster claims will be used to obtain the large sum. If a victim makes the payment, the fraudster either invents a series of further fees for the victim to pay or simply disappears.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) states that &quot;An advance fee scheme occurs when the victim pays money to someone in anticipation of receiving something of greater value – such as a loan, contract, investment, or gift - and then receives little or nothing in return.&quot; There are many variations of this type of scam, including the Nigerian prince scam, also known as a 419 scam. The number &quot;419&quot; refers to the section of the Nigerian Criminal Code dealing with fraud and the charges and penalties for such offenders. The scam has been used with fax and traditional mail and is now prevalent in online communications such as emails. Other variations include the Spanish Prisoner scam and the black money scam.

Although Nigeria is most often the nation referred to in these scams, they mainly originate in other nations. Other nations known to have a high incidence of advance-fee fraud include Ivory Coast, Togo, South Africa, the Netherlands, Spain, and Jamaica.

== History ==
The modern scam is similar to the Spanish Prisoner scam that dates back to the late 18th century. In that con, businessmen were contacted by an individual allegedly trying to smuggle someone who is connected to a wealthy family out of a prison in Spain. In exchange for assistance, the scammer promised to share money with the victim in exchange for a small amount of money to bribe prison guards.

One variant of the scam may date back to the 18th or 19th century, as a very similar letter, entitled &quot;The Letter from Jerusalem&quot;. This is illustrated in the memoirs of Eugène François Vidocq, a former French criminal and private investigator. Another variant of the scam, dating back to ca. 1830, appears very similar to emails today: &quot;Sir, you will doubtlessly be astonished to be receiving a letter from a person unknown to you, who is about to ask a favour from you...&quot; and goes on to talk of a casket containing 16,000 francs in gold and the diamonds of a late marchioness.

The modern-day transnational scam can be traced back to Germany in 1922 and became popular during the 1980s. There are many variants of the template letter. One of these, sent via postal mail, was addressed to a woman&#x27;s husband to inquire about his health. It then asked what to do with profits from a $24.6 million investment and ended with a telephone number.

Other official-looking letters were sent from a writer who said he was a director of the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation. He said he wanted to transfer $20 million to the recipient&#x27;s bank account—money that was budgeted but was never spent. In exchange for transferring the funds out of Nigeria, the recipient would keep 30% of the total. To get the process started, the scammer asked for a few sheets of the company&#x27;s letterhead, bank account numbers, and other personal information. Yet other variants have involved mention of a Nigerian prince or other member of a royal family seeking to transfer large sums of money out of the country—thus, these scams are sometimes called &quot;Nigerian Prince emails&quot;.

The spread of e-mail and email harvesting software significantly lowered the cost of sending scam letters by using the Internet in lieu of international post. Although Nigeria is most often the nation referred to in these scams, they may originate in other nations as well. For example, in 2007, the head of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission stated that scam emails more frequently originated in African countries or in Eastern Europe. Within the European Union, there is a high incidence of advance-fee fraud in the Netherlands and Spain.

The emails sent invariably feature a large number of implausible claims, as well as numerous spelling and grammatical mistakes. According to Cormac Herley, a Microsoft researcher, &quot;By sending an email that repels all but the most gullible, the scammer gets the most promising marks to self-select.&quot; Responding to Herley, a director at Nigeria&#x27;s National Security Adviser said that there are more non-Nigerian scammers claiming to be Nigerian, and suggested that Nigeria&#x27;s reputation for corruption is part of the allure that makes scams seem more plausible. Nigeria has a reputation for being at the center of email scamming.

Modern variations include “sugar daddy/sugar momma” schemes, some of which involve advance-fee scamming, and money flipping, whereby the mark is promised a large amount of money in exchange for sending a small amount of money.

A 2018 study of Nigerian hip-hop culture found that glamorization of cyber-fraud is prevalent in such music. Some scammers have accomplices in the United States and abroad who move in to finish the deal once the initial contact has been made.

===Motives===
Many scammers tend to come from poorer and more-educated backgrounds, where Internet access and better education, along with inability to afford basic necessities, drive people into committing online fraud. They could also have been influenced by social media celebrities and artists who promote scamming as a &quot;cool&quot; trend to quickly gain access to luxury items like sports cars and fashion.

In the case of Nigeria, the rise in scamming cases was due to a boom in cybercafes, a series of economic crashes from the 1980s, and the resulting joblessness among young people in Nigeria.

== Implementation ==
This scam usually begins with the perpetrator contacting the victim via email, instant messaging, or social media using a fake email address or a fake social media account. The fraudster then makes an offer that would allegedly result in a large payoff for the victim.
An email subject line may say something like &quot;From the desk of barrister [Name]&quot;, &quot;Your assistance is needed&quot;, &quot;Important&quot;, &quot;Dear Sir or Madam&quot; and so on. The details vary, but the usual story is that a person, often a government or bank employee, knows of a large amount of unclaimed money or gold that they cannot access directly, usually because they have no right to it.

Such people, who may be real people being impersonated by the scammer or fictitious characters played by the con artist, could include, for example, the wife or son of a deposed African leader who has amassed a stolen fortune, a bank employee who knows of a terminally ill wealthy person with no relatives or a wealthy foreigner who deposited money in the bank just before dying in a traffic accident or a plane crash (leaving no will or known next of kin), a US soldier who has stumbled upon a hidden cache of gold in Iraq, a business being audited by the government, a disgruntled worker or corrupt government official who has embezzled funds, a refugee, and similar characters.

The money could be in the form of gold bullion, gold dust, money in a bank account, blood diamonds, a series of cheques or bank drafts, so on and so forth. The sums involved are usually in the millions of dollars, and the investor is promised a large share, typically ten to fifty percent, in return for assisting the fraudster to retrieve or expatriate the money. Although the vast majority of recipients do not respond to these emails, a small percentage do, enough to make the scam worthwhile as many millions of messages can be sent daily.

To help persuade the victim to agree to the deal, the scammer often sends one or more false documents that bear official government stamps, and seals. 419 scammers also often utilize fake websites and addresses to present themselves as more legitimate. Multiple &quot;people&quot; may write or be involved in schemes as they continue, but they are often fictitious; in many cases, one person controls all the fictitious personae used in scams.

Once the victim&#x27;s confidence has been gained, the scammer then introduces a delay or monetary hurdle that prevents the deal from occurring as planned, such as &quot;To transmit the money, we need to bribe a bank official. Could you help us with a loan?&quot; or &quot;For you to be a party to the transaction, you must have holdings at a Nigerian bank of $100,000 or more&quot; or similar. This is the money being stolen from the victim; the victim willingly transfers the money, usually through some irreversible channel such as a wire transfer, and the scammer receives and pockets it.

Often but not always, delays and additional costs are added by the fraudster, always keeping the promise of an imminent large transfer alive, convincing the victim that the money the victim is currently paying would be covered several times over by the payoff. The implication that these payments will be used for white-collar crime, such as bribery, and even that the money they are being promised is being stolen from a government or royal/wealthy family, often prevents the victim from telling others about the &quot;transaction&quot;, as it would involve admitting that they intended to be complicit in an international crime.

Sometimes psychological pressure is added by claiming that the scammers&#x27; side, to pay certain fees, had to sell belongings and mortgage a house or by comparing the salary scale and living conditions in their country to those in the West. Much of the time, however, the needed psychological pressure is self-applied: once the victims have provided money toward the payoff, they feel they have a vested interest in seeing the &quot;deal&quot; through. Some victims even believe they can cheat the other party, and walk away with all the money instead of just the percentage they were promised.

The essential fact in all advance-fee fraud operations is that the promised money transfer to the victim never happens because the money does not exist. The perpetrators rely on the fact that, by the time the victim realizes this (often only after being confronted by a third party who has noticed the transactions or conversation and recognized the scam), the victim may have sent thousands of dollars of their own money, sometimes thousands more that was borrowed or stolen, to the scammer via an untraceable and/or irreversible means such as wire transfer. The scammer disappears, and the victim is left on the hook for the money sent to the scammer.

During the course of many schemes, scammers ask victims to supply bank account information. Usually this is a &quot;test&quot; devised by the scammer to gauge the victim&#x27;s gullibility; the bank account information is not used directly by the scammer, because a fraudulent withdrawal from the account is more easily detected, reversed, and traced. Scammers instead usually request that payments be made using a wire transfer service like Western Union and MoneyGram. The reason given by the scammer usually relates to the speed at which the payment can be received and processed, allowing quick release of the supposed payoff. The real reason for using such money-sending services is that such wire transfers are irreversible and often untraceable. Further, these services are ideal because identification beyond knowledge of the details of the transaction is often not required, making receipt of such funds almost or entirely anonymous. However, bank account information obtained by scammers is sometimes sold in bulk to other fraudsters who wait a few months for the victim to repair the damage caused by the initial scam before raiding any accounts that the victim did not close.

Telephone numbers used by scammers tend to come from burner phones. In Ivory Coast, a scammer may purchase an inexpensive mobile phone and a pre-paid SIM card without submitting any identifying information. If the scammers believe they are being traced, they discard their mobile phones and purchase new ones.

The spam emails used in these scams are often sent from Internet cafés equipped with satellite internet connection. Recipient addresses and email content are copied and pasted into a webmail interface using a stand-alone storage medium, such as a memory card. Certain areas of Lagos, such as Festac Town, contain many cyber cafés that serve scammers; cyber cafés often lock their doors during certain times, e.g. 10:30pm to 7:00am, so that scammers inside may work without fear of discovery.

Nigeria also contains many businesses that provide false documents used in scams. After a scam involving a forged signature of Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo in summer 2005, Nigerian authorities raided a market in the Oluwole section of Lagos. There, police seized thousands of Nigerian and non-Nigerian passports, 10,000 blank British Airways boarding passes, 10,000 United States Postal money orders, customs documents, false university certificates, 500 printing plates, and 500 computers.

The &quot;success rate&quot; of the scammers is also hard to gauge, since they operate illegally and do not keep track of specific numbers. One individual estimated that he sent 500 emails per day and received about seven replies, citing that when he received a reply, he was 70 percent certain he would get the money. If tens of thousands of emails are sent every day by thousands of individuals, it does not take a very high success rate to be worthwhile.

The success of advance fee crimes is based on the initial persuading of the victim. The FBI recently reported that in 2019 there were 14,607 US citizens that were victims of advance fee scams. The complaints that they received totaled in losses of more than $3.5 billion.

== Countermeasures ==

In recent years, efforts have been made by governments, internet companies, and individuals to combat scammers involved in advance-fee fraud and 419 scams. In 2004, the Nigerian government formed the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to combat economic and financial crimes, such as advanced-fee fraud. In 2009, Nigeria&#x27;s EFCC announced that they had adopted smart technology developed by Microsoft to track down fraudulent emails. They hoped to have the service, dubbed &quot;Eagle Claw&quot;, running at full capacity to warn a quarter of a million potential victims.

Some individuals participate in a practice known as scam baiting, in which they pose as potential targets and engage the scammers in lengthy dialogue so as to waste the scammer&#x27;s time and decrease the time they have available for actual victims. Likewise, the website Artists Against 419, set-up by volunteers, offers a public database with information on scam websites. They work closely together with APWG to share their data with financial institutions and cybersecurity companies.

== Common elements ==
=== Irreversible money transfers ===
A central element of advance-fee fraud is that the transaction from the victim to the scammer must be untraceable and irreversible. Otherwise, the victim, once they become aware of the scam, could successfully retrieve their money and alert officials who could track the accounts used by the scammer.

Wire transfers via Western Union and MoneyGram are ideal for this purpose. International wire transfers cannot be cancelled or reversed, and the person receiving the money cannot be tracked. Other non-cancellable forms of payment include postal money orders and cashier&#x27;s cheques, but wire transfer via Western Union or MoneyGram is more common. 

=== Anonymous communication ===
Since the scammer&#x27;s operations must be untraceable to avoid identification, and because the scammer is often impersonating someone else, any communication between the scammer and his victim must be done through channels that hide the scammer&#x27;s true identity. The following options in particular are widely used.

==== Web-based email ====
Because many free email services do not require valid identifying information and also allow communication with many victims in a short span of time, they are the preferred method of communication for scammers. Some services go so far as to mask the sender&#x27;s source IP address (Gmail being a common choice), making the scammer&#x27;s country of origin more difficult to trace. While Gmail does indeed strip headers from emails, it is possible to trace an IP address from such an email. Scammers can create as many accounts as they wish and often have several at a time. In addition, if email providers are alerted to the scammer&#x27;s activities and suspend the account, it is a trivial matter for the scammer to simply create a new account to resume scamming.

==== Email hijacking/friend scams ====
Some fraudsters hijack existing email accounts and use them for advance-fee fraud purposes. For instance, with social engineering, the fraudster impersonates associates, friends, or family members of the legitimate account owner in an attempt to defraud them. A variety of techniques such as phishing, keyloggers, and computer viruses are used to gain login information for the email address.

==== Fax transmissions ====
Facsimile machines are commonly used tools of business whenever a client requires a hard copy of a document. They can also be simulated using web services and made untraceable by the use of prepaid phones connected to mobile fax machines or by use of a public fax machine such as one owned by a document processing business like FedEx Office/Kinko&#x27;s. Thus, scammers posing as business entities often use fax transmissions as an anonymous form of communication. This is more expensive, as the prepaid phone and fax equipment cost more than email, but to a skeptical victim, it can be more believable.

==== SMS messages ====
Abusing SMS bulk senders such as WASPs, scammers subscribe to these services using fraudulent registration details and paying either via cash or with stolen credit card details. They then send out masses of unsolicited SMS messages to victims stating they have won a competition, lottery, reward, or an event and that they have to contact somebody to claim their prize. Typically, the details of the party to be contacted will be an equally untraceable email address or a virtual telephone number.

These messages may be sent over a weekend when the staff at the service providers are not working, enabling the scammer to be able to abuse the services for a whole weekend. Even when traceable, they give out long and winding procedures for procuring the reward (real or unreal) and that too with the impending huge cost of transportation and tax or duty charges. The origin of such SMS messages is often from fake websites/addresses.

A contemporary (mid-2011) innovation is the use of a Premium Rate &#x27;call back&#x27; number (instead of a website or email) in the SMS. On calling the number, the victim is first reassured that &#x27;they are a winner&#x27; and then subjected to a long series of instructions on how to collect their &#x27;winnings&#x27;. During the message, there will be frequent instructions to &#x27;ring back in the event of problems&#x27;. The call is always &#x27;cut off&#x27; just before the victim has the chance to note all the details. Some victims call back multiple times in an effort to collect all the details. The scammer thus makes their money out of the fees charged for the calls.

==== Telecommunications relay services ====
Many scams use telephone calls to convince the victim that the person on the other end of the deal is a real, truthful person. The scammer, possibly impersonating a person of a nationality or gender other than their own, would arouse suspicion by telephoning the victim. In these cases, scammers use TRS, a US federally funded relay service where an operator or a text/speech translation program acts as an intermediary between someone using an ordinary telephone and a deaf caller using TDD or other teleprinter device. The scammer may claim they are deaf, and that they must use a relay service. The victim, possibly drawn in by sympathy for a disabled caller, might be more susceptible to the fraud.

FCC regulations and confidentiality laws require operators to relay calls verbatim and adhere to a strict code of confidentiality and ethics. Thus, no relay operator may judge the legality and legitimacy of a relay call and must relay it without interference. This means the relay operator may not warn victims, even when they suspect the call is a scam. MCI said about one percent of their IP Relay calls in 2004 were scams.

Tracking phone-based relay services is relatively easy, so scammers tend to prefer Internet Protocol–based relay services such as IP Relay. In a common strategy, they bind their overseas IP address to a router or server located on US soil, allowing them to use US-based relay service providers without interference.

TRS is sometimes used to relay credit card information to make a fraudulent purchase with a stolen credit card. In many cases however, it is simply a means for the con artist to further lure the victim into the scam.

=== Invitation to visit the country ===
Sometimes, victims are invited to a country to meet government officials, an associate of the scammer, or the scammer themselves. Some victims who travel are instead held for ransom. Scammers may tell a victim that they do not need a visa or that the scammers will provide one. If the victim does this, the scammers have the power to extort money from the victim.

Sometimes victims are ransomed, kidnapped, or murdered. According to a 1995 U.S. State Department report, over fifteen persons were murdered between 1992 and 1995 in Nigeria after following through on advance-fee frauds. In 1999 Norwegian millionaire Kjetil Moe was lured to South Africa by scammers and was murdered. George Makronalli was lured to South Africa and was killed in 2004.

== Variants ==

There are many variations on the most common stories, and also many variations on the way the scam works. Some of the more commonly seen variants involve employment scams, lottery scams, online sales and rentals, and romance scams. Many scams involve online sales, such as those advertised on websites such as Craigslist and eBay, or property rental. This article cannot list every known and future type of advanced fee fraud or 419 scheme; only some major types are described. Additional examples may be available in the &quot;external links&quot; section at the end of this article.

=== Employment scams ===
This scam targets people who have posted their résumés on job sites. The scammer sends a letter with a falsified company logo. The job offer usually indicates exceptional salary and benefits, and requests that the victim needs a &quot;work permit&quot; for working in the country, and includes the address of a (fake) &quot;government official&quot; to contact. The &quot;government official&quot; then proceeds to fleece the victim by extracting fees from the unsuspecting user for the work permit and other fees. A variant of the job scam recruits freelancers seeking work, such as editing or translation, then requires some advance payment before assignments are offered.

Many legitimate (or at least fully registered) companies work on a similar basis, using this method as their primary source of earnings. Some modelling and escort agencies tell applicants that they have a number of clients lined up, but that they require some sort of prior &quot;registration fee&quot;, usually paid in by an untraceable method, e.g. by Western Union transfer; once the fee is paid, the applicant is informed the client has cancelled, and not contacted again.

The scammer contacts the victim to interest them in a &quot;work-from-home&quot; opportunity, or asks them to cash a cheque or money order that for some reason cannot be redeemed locally. In one cover story, the perpetrator of the scam wishes the victim to work as a &quot;mystery shopper&quot;, evaluating the service provided by MoneyGram or Western Union locations within major retailers such as Wal-Mart. The scammer sends the victim a forged or stolen cheque or money order as described above, the victim deposits it—banks will often credit an account with the value of a cheque not obviously false— and sends the money to the scammer via wire transfer. Later the cheque is not honoured (&quot;bounces&quot;) and the bank debits the victim&#x27;s account. Schemes based solely on cheque cashing usually offer only a small part of the cheque&#x27;s total amount, with the assurance that many more cheques will follow; if the victim buys into the scam and cashes all the cheques, the scammer can steal a lot in a very short time.

==== Bogus job offers ====
More sophisticated scams advertise jobs with real companies and offer lucrative salaries and conditions with the fraudsters pretending to be recruitment agents. A bogus telephone or online interview may take place and after some time the applicant is informed that the job is theirs. To secure the job they are instructed to send money for their work visa or travel costs to the agent, or to a bogus travel agent who works on the scammer&#x27;s behalf. No matter what the variation, they always involve the job seeker sending them or their agent money, credit card or bank account details. A newer form of employment scam has arisen in which users are sent a bogus job offer but are not asked to give financial information. Instead, their personal information is harvested during the application process and then sold to third parties for a profit, or used for identity theft.

Another form of employment scam involves making people attend a fake &quot;interview&quot; where they are told the benefits of the company. The attendees are then made to assist to a conference where a scammer will use elaborate manipulation techniques to convince the attendees to purchase products, in a similar manner to the catalog merchant business model, as a hiring requisite. Quite often, the company lacks any form of the physical catalog to help them sell products (e.g. jewelry). When &quot;given&quot; the job, the individual is then asked to promote the scam job offer on their own. They are also made to work for the company unpaid as a form of &quot;training&quot;. Similar scams involve making alleged job candidates pay money upfront in person for training materials or services, with the claim that upon successful completion, they will be offered a guaranteed job, which never materializes.

=== Lottery scam ===

The lottery scam involves fake notices of lottery wins, although the intended victim has not entered the lottery. The &quot;winner&quot; is usually asked to send sensitive information such as name, residential address, occupation/position, lottery number etc. to a free email account which is at times untraceable or without any link. In addition to harvesting this information, the scammer then notifies the victim that releasing the funds requires some small fee (insurance, registration, or shipping). Once the victim sends the fee, the scammer invents another fee.

The fake cheque technique described above is also used. Fake or stolen cheque, representing a part payment of the winnings, being sent; then a fee, smaller than the amount received, is requested. The bank receiving the bad cheque eventually reclaims the funds from the victim.

In 2004, a variant of the lottery scam appeared in the United States: a scammer phones a victim purporting to be speaking on behalf of the government about a grant they qualify for, subject to an advance fee of typically US$250.

Typical lottery scams address the person as some variation of &quot;Lucky Winner&quot;. This is a red flag, as if someone entered an actual lottery and won, the organization would know their name, and not simply call them &quot;Lucky Winner&quot;.

=== Online sales and rentals ===
Many scams involve the purchase of goods and services via classified advertisements, especially on sites like Craigslist, eBay, or Gumtree. These typically involve the scammer contacting the seller of a particular good or service via telephone or email expressing interest in the item. They will typically then send a fake cheque written for an amount greater than the asking price, asking the seller to send the difference to an alternate address, usually by money order or Western Union. A seller eager to sell a particular product may not wait for the cheque to clear, and when the bad cheque bounces, the funds wired have already been lost.

Some scammers advertise phony academic conferences in exotic or international locations, complete with fake websites, scheduled agendas and advertising experts in a particular field that will be presenting there. They offer to pay the airfare of the participants, but not the hotel accommodations. They will extract money from the victims when they attempt to reserve their accommodations in a non-existent hotel.

Sometimes, an inexpensive rental property is advertised by a fake landlord, who is typically out of state (or the country) and asking for the rent and/or deposit to be wired to them. Or the con artist finds a property, pretends to be the owner, lists it online, and communicates with the would-be renter to make a cash deposit. The scammer may also be the renter as well, in which case they pretend to be a foreign student and contact a landlord seeking accommodation. They usually state they are not yet in the country and wish to secure accommodations prior to arriving. Once the terms are negotiated, a forged cheque is forwarded for a greater amount than negotiated, and the fraudster asks the landlord to wire some of the money back.

=== Pet scams ===
This is a variation of the online sales scam where high-value, scarce pets are advertised as bait on online advertising websites using little real seller verification like Craigslist, Gumtree, and JunkMail. The pet may either be advertised as being for-sale or up for adoption. Typically, the pet is advertised on online advertising pages complete with photographs taken from various sources such as real advertisements, blogs or wherever else an image can be stolen. Upon the potential victim contacting the scammer, the scammer responds by asking for details pertaining to the potential victim&#x27;s circumstances and location under the pretense of ensuring that the pet would have a suitable home.

By determining the location of the victim, the scammer ensures he is far enough from the victim so as to not allow the buyer to physically view the pet. Should the scammer be questioned, as the advertisement claimed a location initially, the scammer will claim work circumstances having forced him to relocate. This forces a situation whereby all communication is either via email, telephone (normally untraceable numbers) and SMS.

Upon the victim deciding to adopt or purchase the pet, a courier has to be used which is in reality part of the scam. If this is for an adopted pet, typically the victim is expected to pay some fee such as insurance, food or shipping. Payment is via MoneyGram, Western Union or money mules&#x27; bank accounts where other victims have been duped into work from home scams.

Numerous problems are encountered in the courier phase of the scam. The crate may be said to be too small, and the victim has the option of either purchasing a crate with air conditioning or renting one while also paying a deposit, typically called a caution or cautionary fee. The victim may also have to pay for insurance if such fees have not been paid yet. If the victim pays these fees, the pet may be said to have become sick, and a veterinarian&#x27;s assistance is sought for which the victim has to repay the courier.

Additionally, the victim may be asked to pay for a health certificate needed to transport the pet, and for kennel fees during the recuperation period. The further the scam progresses, the more similar the fictitious fees are to those of typical 419 scams. It is not uncommon to see customs or like fees being claimed if such charges fit into the scam plot.

Numerous scam websites may be used for this scam. This scam has been linked to the classical 419 scams in that the fictitious couriers used are also used in other types of 419 scams such as lotto scams.

=== Romance scam ===
One of the variants is the &quot;Romance Scam&quot;, a money-for-romance angle. The con artist approaches the victim on an online dating service, an instant messenger, or a social networking site. The scammer claims an interest in the victim, and posts pictures of an attractive person. The scammer uses this communication to gain confidence, then asks for money. A very common example of romance scams is depicted in the fraudulent activities of these boys, popularly known as Yahoo boys in Nigeria.

The con artist may claim to be interested in meeting the victim but needs cash to book a plane, buy a bus ticket, rent a hotel room, pay for personal-travel costs such as gasoline or a vehicle rental, or to cover other expenses. In other cases, they claim they&#x27;re trapped in a foreign country and need assistance to return, to escape imprisonment by corrupt local officials, to pay for medical expenses due to an illness contracted abroad, and so on. The scammer may also use the confidence gained by the romance angle to introduce some variant of the original Nigerian Letter scheme, such as saying they need to get money or valuables out of the country and offer to share the wealth, making the request for help in leaving the country even more attractive to the victim.

Scams often involve meeting someone on an online match-making service. The scammer initiates contact with their target who is out of the area and requests money for transportation fare. Scammers will typically ask for money to be sent via a money order or wire transfer due to the need to travel, or for medical or business costs.

An extreme example of this is the case of a 67-year-old Australian woman, Jette Jacobs. In 2013, she traveled to South Africa to supposedly marry her scammer, Jesse Orowo Omokoh, 28, after having sent more than $90,000 to him over a three-year period. Her body was discovered on February 9, 2013, under mysterious circumstances, two days after meeting up with Omokoh, who then fled to Nigeria, where he was arrested. He was found to have had 32 fake online identities. Due to lack of evidence he was not charged with murder, but was charged with fraud.

=== Mobile tower installation fraud ===

This variant of advance-fee fraud is widespread in India and Pakistan. The fraudster uses Internet classified websites and print media to lure the public into installing a mobile phone tower on their property, with the promise of huge rental returns. The fraudster also creates fake websites to appear legitimate. The victims part with their money in pieces to the fraudster on account of the Government Service Tax, government clearance charges, bank charges, transportation charges, survey fee etc. The Indian government is issuing public notices in media to spread awareness among the public and warn them against mobile tower fraudsters.

=== Other scams ===
Other scams involve unclaimed property, also called &quot;bona vacantia&quot; in the United Kingdom. In England and Wales (other than the Duchy of Lancaster and the Duchy of Cornwall), this property is administered by the Bona Vacantia Division of the Treasury Solicitor&#x27;s Department. Fraudulent emails and letters claiming to be from this department have been reported, informing the recipient they are the beneficiary of a legacy but requiring the payment of a fee before sending more information or releasing the money. In the United States, messages are falsely claimed to be from the National Association of Unclaimed Property Administrators (NAUPA), a real organization, but one that does not and cannot by itself make payments.

In one variant of 419 fraud, an alleged hitman writes to someone explaining he has been targeted to kill them. He tells them he knows the allegations against them are false, and asks for money so the target can receive evidence of the person who ordered the hit.

Another variant of advanced fee fraud is known as a pigeon drop. This is a confidence trick in which the mark, or &quot;pigeon&quot;, is persuaded to give up a sum of money in order to secure the rights to a larger sum of money, or more valuable object. In reality, the scammers make off with the money and the mark is left with nothing. In the process, the stranger (actually a confidence trickster) puts his money with the mark&#x27;s money (in an envelope, briefcase, or bag) which the mark is then apparently entrusted with; it is actually switched for a bag full of newspaper or other worthless material. Through various theatrics, the mark is given the opportunity to leave with the money without the stranger realizing. In reality, the mark would be fleeing from his own money, which the con man still has (or has handed off to an accomplice).

Some scammers go after the victims of previous scams; known as a reloading scam. For example, they may contact a victim saying they can track and apprehend the scammer and recover the money lost by the victim for a price. Or they may say a fund has been set up by the Nigerian government to compensate victims of 419 fraud, and all that is required is proof of the loss, personal information, and a processing and handling fee. The recovery scammers obtain lists of victims by buying them from the original scammers.

== Consequences ==
Estimates of the total losses due to scams are uncertain and vary widely, since many people may be too embarrassed to admit that they were gullible enough to be scammed to report the crime. A United States government report in 2006 indicated that Americans lost $198.4 million to Internet fraud in 2006, averaging a loss of $5,100 per incident. That same year, a report in the United Kingdom claimed that these scams cost the economy £150 million per year, with the average victim losing £31,000. As of 2019, Nigerian letter scams still annually collect $700,000 ($ in dollars) or $2,133 ($ in dollars) per person. 

In addition to the financial cost, many victims also suffer a severe emotional and psychological cost, such as losing their ability to trust people. One man from Cambridgeshire, UK burnt himself to death with petrol after realizing that the $1.2 million &quot;internet lottery&quot; that he had won was actually a scam. In 2007 a Chinese student at the University of Nottingham killed herself after she discovered that she had fallen for a similar lottery scam.

Other victims lose wealth and friends, become estranged from family members, deceive partners, get divorced, or commit criminal offenses in the process of either fulfilling their &quot;obligations&quot; to the scammers or obtaining more money. In 2008, an Oregon woman lost $400,000 to a Nigerian advance-fee fraud scam, after an email told her she had inherited money from her long-lost grandfather. Her curiosity was piqued because she actually had a grandfather with whom her family had lost touch, and whose initials matched those given in the email. She sent hundreds of thousands of dollars over a period of more than two years, despite her family, bank staff and law enforcement officials all urging her to stop. The elderly are particularly susceptible to online scams such as this, as they typically come from a generation that was more trusting, and are often too proud to report the fraud. They also may be concerned that relatives might see it as a sign of declining mental capacity, and they are afraid to lose their independence.

Victims can be enticed to borrow or embezzle money to pay the advance fees, believing that they will shortly be paid a much larger sum and be able to refund what they had misappropriated. Crimes committed by victims include credit-card fraud, check kiting, and embezzlement. San Diego–based businessman James Adler lost over $5 million in a Nigeria-based advance-fee scam. While a court affirmed that various Nigerian government officials (including a governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria) were directly or indirectly involved, and that Nigerian government officials could be sued in U.S. courts under the &quot;commercial activity&quot; exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, Adler was unable to get his money back due to the doctrine of unclean hands because he had knowingly entered into a contract that was illegal.

Some 419 scams involve even more serious crimes, such as kidnapping or murder. One such case, in 2008, involves Osamai Hitomi, a Japanese businessman who was lured to Johannesburg, South Africa and kidnapped on September 26, 2008. The kidnappers took him to Alberton, south of Johannesburg, and demanded a $5 million ransom from his family. Seven people were ultimately arrested. In July 2001, Joseph Raca, a former mayor of Northampton, UK, was kidnapped by scammers in Johannesburg, South Africa, who demanded a ransom of £20,000. The captors released Raca after they became nervous. One 419 scam that ended in murder occurred in February 2003, when Jiří Pasovský, a 72-year-old scam victim from the Czech Republic, shot and killed 50-year-old Michael Lekara Wayid, an official at the Nigerian embassy in Prague, and injured another person, after the Nigerian Consul General explained he could not return the $600,000 that Pasovský had lost to a Nigerian scammer.

The international nature of the crime, combined with the fact that many victims do not want to admit that they bought into an illegal activity, has made tracking down and apprehending these criminals difficult. Furthermore, the government of Nigeria has been slow to take action, leading some investigators to believe that some Nigerian government officials are involved in some of these scams. The Nigeria government&#x27;s establishment of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) in 2004 helped with the issue to some degree, although issues with corruption remain. 

Despite this, there have been some recent successes in apprehending and prosecuting these criminals. In 2004, 52 suspects were arrested in Amsterdam after an extensive raid, after which almost no 419 emails were reported being sent by local internet service providers. In November 2004, Australian authorities apprehended Nick Marinellis of Sydney, the self-proclaimed head of Australian 419ers who later boasted that he had &quot;220 African brothers worldwide&quot; and that he was &quot;the Australian headquarters for those scams&quot;. In 2008 US authorities in Olympia, Washington, sentenced Edna Fiedler to two years in prison with five years of supervised probation for her involvement in a $1 million Nigerian cheque scam. She had an accomplice in Lagos, Nigeria, who shipped her up to $1.1 million worth of counterfeit cheques and money orders with instructions on where to ship them.

== In popular culture ==
Research suggests that some Nigerian hip-hop musicians have strong connections with some Yahoo Boys (cybercriminals). Due to the increased use of the 419 scams on the Internet, it has been used as a plot device in many films, television shows and books. A song, &quot;I Go Chop Your Dollar&quot;, performed by Nkem Owoh, also became internationally known as an anthem for 419 scammers using the phrases &quot;419 is just a game, I am the winner, you are the loser&quot;.

However, it turns out that Nigel Soladu is a real Nigerian businessman and the investment offer is legitimate, although Murray notes that, despite Mr. Soladu having e-mailed many people for an investment, only he had taken him up on it.

<text>Human Rights Watch (HRW) is an international non-governmental organization that conducts research and advocacy on human rights. Headquartered in New York City, the group investigates and reports on issues including war crimes, crimes against humanity, child labor, torture, human trafficking, and women&#x27;s and LGBTQ rights. It pressures governments, policymakers, companies, and individual abusers to respect human rights, and frequently works on behalf of refugees, children, migrants, and political prisoners.

The organization was founded in 1978 as Helsinki Watch, whose purpose was to monitor the Soviet Union&#x27;s compliance with the 1975 Helsinki Accords. Its separate global divisions merged into Human Rights Watch in 1988. The group publishes annual reports on about 100 countries with the goal of providing an overview of the worldwide state of human rights. In 1997, HRW shared the Nobel Peace Prize as a founding member of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines. It played a leading role in the 2008 treaty banning cluster munitions.

HRW&#x27;s annual expenses totaled $50.6 million in 2011, $69.2 million in 2014, and $75.5 million in 2017.

== History ==

Human Rights Watch was co-founded by Robert L. Bernstein, Jeri Laber, and Aryeh Neier as a private American NGO in 1978, under the name Helsinki Watch, to monitor the then-Soviet Union&#x27;s compliance with the Helsinki Accords. Helsinki Watch adopted a practice of publicly &quot;naming and shaming&quot; abusive governments through media coverage and direct exchanges with policymakers. Helsinki Watch says that, by shining the international spotlight on human rights violations in the Soviet Union and its European partners, it contributed to the region&#x27;s democratic transformations in the late 1980s.

Americas Watch was founded in 1981 while bloody civil wars engulfed Central America. Relying on extensive on-the-ground fact-finding, Americas Watch not only addressed perceived abuses by government forces but also applied international humanitarian law to investigate and expose war crimes by rebel groups. In addition to raising concerns in the affected countries, Americas Watch also examined the role played by foreign governments, particularly the United States government, in providing military and political support to abusive regimes.

Asia Watch (1985), Africa Watch (1988) and Middle East Watch (1989) were added to what was known as &quot;The Watch Committees&quot;. In 1988, these committees united under one umbrella to form Human Rights Watch.

In April 2021, Human Rights Watch released a report accusing Israel of apartheid and calling on the International Criminal Court to investigate &quot;systematic discrimination&quot; against Palestinians, becoming the first major international rights NGO to do so.

In August 2020, the Chinese government sanctioned HRW executive director Kenneth Roth—along with the heads of four other U.S.-based democracy and human rights organizations and six U.S. Republican lawmakers—for supporting the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement in the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests. The five organizations&#x27; leaders saw the sanctioning, whose details were unspecified, as a tit-for-tat measure in response to the earlier U.S. sanctioning of 11 Hong Kong officials. The latter step had in turn been a reaction to the enactment of the Hong Kong National Security Law in June. In October 2021, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that HRW left Hong Kong as a result of the Chinese sanctions, with the situation in Hong Kong henceforth to be monitored by HRW&#x27;s China team. The decision to leave came amid a wider crackdown on civil society groups in Hong Kong.

On 8 March 2023, Bahrain canceled two HRW staff members&#x27; entry permit visas to attend the 146th Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) Assembly. The permits were issued on 30 January 2023. Holding a constant observer status with IPU, HRW authorities had a permanent access to attend the organization&#x27;s assemblies. Bahrain held the IPU Meeting from 11 to 15 March 2023.

== Profile ==

Pursuant to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), Human Rights Watch opposes violations of what the UDHR considers basic human rights. This includes capital punishment and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. HRW advocates freedoms in connection with fundamental human rights, such as freedom of religion and freedom of the press. It seeks to achieve change by publicly pressuring governments and their policymakers to curb human rights abuses, and by convincing more powerful governments to use their influence on governments that violate human rights.

Human Rights Watch publishes research reports on violations of international human rights norms as set out by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and what it perceives to be other internationally accepted human-rights norms. These reports are used as the basis for drawing international attention to abuses and pressuring governments and international organizations to reform. Researchers conduct fact-finding missions to investigate suspect situations, also using diplomacy, staying in touch with victims, making files about public and individuals, providing required security for them in critical situations, and generating local and international media coverage. Issues HRW raises in its reports include social and gender discrimination, torture, military use of children, political corruption, abuses in criminal justice systems, and the legalization of abortion. HRW has documented and reported various violations of the laws of war and international humanitarian law, most recently in Yemen.

Human Rights Watch also supports writers worldwide who are persecuted for their work and in need of financial assistance. The Hellman/Hammett grants are financed by the estate of the playwright Lillian Hellman in funds set up in her name and that of her longtime companion, the novelist Dashiell Hammett. In addition to providing financial assistance, the Hellman/Hammett grants help raise international awareness of activists who have been silenced for speaking out in defence of human rights.

Each year, Human Rights Watch presents the Human Rights Defenders Award to activists who demonstrate leadership and courage in defending human rights. The award winners work closely with HRW to investigate and expose human rights abuses.

Human Rights Watch was one of six international NGOs that founded the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers in 1998. It is also the co-chair of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, a global coalition of civil society groups that successfully lobbied to introduce the Ottawa Treaty, which prohibits the use of anti-personnel landmines.

Human Rights Watch is a founding member of the International Freedom of Expression Exchange, a global network of non-governmental organizations that monitor censorship worldwide. It also co-founded the Cluster Munition Coalition, which brought about an international convention banning the weapons. HRW employs more than 275 staff—country experts, lawyers, journalists, and academics—and operates in more than 90 countries around the world. Headquartered in New York City, it has offices in Amsterdam, Beirut, Berlin, Brussels, Chicago, Geneva, Johannesburg, London, Los Angeles, Nairobi, Seoul, Paris, San Francisco, Sydney, Tokyo, Toronto, Washington, D.C., and Zürich. HRW maintains direct access to the majority of countries it reports on. Cuba, North Korea, Sudan, Iran, Israel, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan and Venezuela are among the handful of countries that have blocked HRW staff members&#x27; access.

HRW&#x27;s former executive director is Kenneth Roth, who held the position from 1993 to 2022. Roth conducted investigations on abuses in Poland after martial law was declared 1981. He later focused on Haiti, which had just emerged from the Duvalier dictatorship but continued to be plagued with problems. Roth&#x27;s awareness of the importance of human rights began with stories his father had told about escaping Nazi Germany in 1938. He graduated from Yale Law School and Brown University.

Tirana Hassan became the group&#x27;s executive director in 2023 until February 2025. Hassan is a qualified social worker who has worked with Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), the United Nations International Children&#x27;s Emergency Fund (UNICEF), Save the Children, and most recently as director of Amnesty International&#x27;s Crisis Response Program. Hassan holds honors degrees in social work and law from Australia and a master&#x27;s degree in international human rights law from Oxford University.

=== Comparison with Amnesty International ===

Human Rights watch and Amnesty International are both international non-governmental organizations headquartered in the North Atlantic Anglosphere that report on global human rights violations. The major differences lie in the groups&#x27; structures and methods for promoting change.

Amnesty International is a mass-membership organization. Mobilization of those members is the organization&#x27;s central advocacy tool. Human Rights Watch&#x27;s main products are its crisis-directed research and lengthy reports, whereas Amnesty International lobbies and writes detailed reports but also focuses on mass letter-writing campaigns, adopting individuals as &quot;prisoners of conscience&quot; and lobbying for their release. HRW openly lobbies for specific actions for other governments to take against human rights offenders, including naming specific individuals for arrest, or sanctions to be levied against certain countries, such as calling for punitive sanctions against the top leaders in Sudan who oversaw a killing campaign in Darfur. The group also called for human rights activists who had been detained in Sudan to be released.

HRW&#x27;s documentations of human rights abuses often include extensive analyses of conflicts&#x27; political and historical backgrounds, some of which have been published in academic journals. AI&#x27;s reports, on the other hand, tend to contain less analysis, instead focusing on specific abuses of rights.

In 2010, Jonathan Foreman wrote that HRW had &quot;all but eclipsed&quot; Amnesty International. According to Foreman, instead of being supported by a mass membership, as AI is, HRW depends on wealthy donors who like to see the organization&#x27;s reports make headlines. For this reason, according to Foreman, it may be that organizations like HRW &quot;concentrate too much on places that the media already cares about,&quot; especially Israel.

== Financing and services ==
For the financial year ending June 2008, HRW reported receiving approximately US$44 million in public donations. In 2009, HRW said it received almost 75% of its financial support from North America, 25% from Western Europe and less than 1% from the rest of the world.

According to a 2008 financial assessment, HRW reports that it does not accept any direct or indirect funding from governments and is financed through contributions from private individuals and foundations.

Financier George Soros of the Open Society Foundations announced in 2010 his intention to grant US$100 million to HRW over ten years to help it expand its efforts internationally: &quot;to be more effective&quot;, he said, &quot;I think the organization has to be seen as more international, less an American organization.&quot; He continued, &quot;Human Rights Watch is one of the most effective organizations I support. Human rights underpin our greatest aspirations: they&#x27;re at the heart of open societies.&quot; The donation, the largest in HRW&#x27;s history, increased its operating staff of 300 by 120 people.

Charity Navigator gave HRW a three-star rating for 2018. Its financial rating increased from three stars in 2015 to the maximum four as of 2016. The Better Business Bureau said HRW meets its standards for charity accountability.

== Publications ==
Human Rights Watch publishes reports on many different topics and compiles an annual &quot;World Report&quot; presenting an overview of the worldwide state of human rights. It has been published by Seven Stories Press since 2006; the current edition, &quot;World Report 2020&quot;, was released in January 2020, and covers events of 2019. &quot;World Report 2020&quot;, HRW&#x27;s 30th annual review of human rights practices around the globe, includes reviews of human rights practices and trends in nearly 100 countries, and an introductory essay by Executive Director Kenneth Roth, &quot;China&#x27;s Global Threat to Human Rights&quot;. HRW has reported extensively on subjects such as the Rwandan genocide of 1994, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the excessive breadth of U.S. sex offender registries and their application to juveniles.

In the summer of 2004, the Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Columbia University in New York became the depository institution for the Human Rights Watch Archive, an active collection that documents decades of human rights investigations around the world. The archive was transferred from the Norlin Library at the University of Colorado, Boulder. It includes administrative files, public relations documents, and case and country files. With some exceptions for security considerations, the Columbia University community and the public have access to field notes, taped and transcribed interviews with alleged victims of human rights violations, video and audiotapes, and other materials documenting HRW&#x27;s activities since its founding in 1978 as Helsinki Watch. Some parts of the HRW archive are not open to researchers or to the public, including the records of the meetings of the board of directors, the executive committee, and the various subcommittees, limiting historians&#x27; ability to understand the organization&#x27;s internal decision-making.

== Criticism ==

HRW has been criticized for perceived bias by the national governments it has investigated for human rights abuses. Some sources allege HRW is biased against Israel in its coverage of the Israel–Palestine conflict.

In 2014, two Nobel Peace Laureates, Adolfo Pérez Esquivel and Mairead Maguire, wrote a letter signed by 100 other human rights activists and scholars criticizing HRW for its revolving-door hiring practices with the U.S. government, its failure to denounce the U.S. practice of extrajudicial rendition, its endorsement of the U.S. 2011 military intervention in Libya, and its silence during the 2004 Haitian coup d&#x27;état.

In 2020, HRW&#x27;s board of directors discovered that HRW accepted a $470,000 donation from Saudi real estate magnate Mohamed Bin Issa Al Jaber, owner of a company HRW &quot;had previously identified as complicit in labor rights abuse&quot;, under the condition that the donation not be used to support LGBT advocacy in the Middle East and North Africa. After &quot;The Intercept&quot; reported the donation, it was returned, and HRW issued a statement that accepting it was &quot;deeply regrettable&quot;.

<doc id="46531" wikidata="Q81000" url="?curid=46531" title="Richard II of England">
<text>Richard II (6 January 1367 – ), also known as Richard of Bordeaux, was King of England from 1377 until he was deposed in 1399. He was the son of Edward, Prince of Wales (later known as the Black Prince), and Joan, Countess of Kent. Richard&#x27;s father died in 1376, leaving Richard as heir apparent to his grandfather, King Edward III; upon the latter&#x27;s death, the 10-year-old Richard succeeded to the throne.

During Richard&#x27;s first years as king, government was in the hands of a series of regency councils, influenced by Richard&#x27;s uncles John of Gaunt and Thomas of Woodstock. England at that time faced various problems, most notably the Hundred Years&#x27; War. A major challenge of the reign was the Peasants&#x27; Revolt in 1381, and the young king played a central part in the successful suppression of this crisis. Less warlike than either his father or grandfather, he sought to bring an end to the Hundred Years&#x27; War. A firm believer in the royal prerogative, Richard restrained the power of the aristocracy and relied on a private retinue for military protection instead. In contrast to his grandfather, Richard cultivated a refined atmosphere centred on art and culture at court, in which the king was an elevated figure.

The King&#x27;s dependence on a small number of courtiers caused discontent among the nobility, and in 1387 control of government was taken over by a group of aristocrats known as the Lords Appellant. By 1389 Richard had regained control, and for the next eight years governed in relative harmony with his former opponents. In 1397, he took his revenge on the Appellants, many of whom were executed or exiled. The next two years have been described by historians as Richard&#x27;s &quot;tyranny&quot;. In 1399, after John of Gaunt died, the King disinherited Gaunt&#x27;s son Henry Bolingbroke, who had previously been exiled. Henry invaded England in June 1399 with a small force that quickly grew in numbers. Meeting little resistance, he deposed Richard and had himself crowned king. Richard is thought to have been starved to death in captivity, although questions remain regarding his final fate.

Richard&#x27;s posthumous reputation has been shaped to a large extent by William Shakespeare, whose play &quot;Richard II&quot; portrayed Richard&#x27;s misrule and his deposition as responsible for the 15th-century Wars of the Roses. Modern historians do not accept this interpretation, while not exonerating Richard from responsibility for his own deposition. While probably not insane, as many historians of the 19th and 20th centuries believed him to be, he may have had a personality disorder, particularly manifesting itself towards the end of his reign. Most authorities agree that his policies were not unrealistic or even entirely unprecedented, but that the way in which he carried them out was unacceptable to the political establishment, leading to his downfall.

== Early life ==
Richard of Bordeaux was the younger son of Edward, Prince of Wales, and Joan, Countess of Kent. Edward, eldest son of Edward III and heir apparent to the throne of England, had distinguished himself as a military commander in the early phases of the Hundred Years&#x27; War, particularly in the Battle of Poitiers in 1356. After further military adventures, however, he contracted dysentery in Spain in 1370. He never fully recovered and had to return to England the next year.

Richard was born at the Archbishop&#x27;s Palace of Bordeaux, in the English principality of Aquitaine, on 6 January 1367. According to contemporary sources, three kings, &quot;the King of Castile, the King of Navarre and the King of Portugal&quot;, were present at his birth. This anecdote, and the fact that his birth fell on the feast of Epiphany, was later used in the religious imagery of the Wilton Diptych, where Richard is one of three kings paying homage to the Virgin and Child.

Richard&#x27;s elder brother, Edward of Angoulême, died near his sixth birthday in 1370. The Prince of Wales finally succumbed to his long illness in June 1376. The Commons in the English Parliament genuinely feared that Richard&#x27;s uncle, John of Gaunt, would usurp the throne. For this reason, Richard was quickly invested with the princedom of Wales and his father&#x27;s other titles.
On 21 June 1377, King Edward III, who was for some years frail and decrepit, died after a 50-year reign. This resulted in the 10-year-old Richard succeeding to the throne. He was crowned on 16 July at Westminster Abbey. Again, fears of John of Gaunt&#x27;s ambitions influenced political decisions, and a regency led by the King&#x27;s uncles was avoided. Instead, the King was nominally to exercise kingship with the help of a series of &quot;continual councils&quot;, from which Gaunt was excluded.

Gaunt, together with his younger brother Thomas of Woodstock, Earl of Buckingham, still held great informal influence over the business of government, but the King&#x27;s councillors and friends, particularly Sir Simon de Burley and Robert de Vere, 9th Earl of Oxford, increasingly gained control of royal affairs.

In a matter of three years, these councillors earned the mistrust of the Commons to the point that the councils were discontinued in 1380. Contributing to discontent was an increasingly heavy burden of taxation levied through three poll taxes between 1377 and 1381 that were spent on unsuccessful military expeditions on the continent. By 1381, there was a deep-felt resentment against the governing classes in the lower levels of English society.

== Early reign ==
=== Peasants&#x27; Revolt ===
Whereas the poll tax of 1381 was the spark of the Peasants&#x27; Revolt, the root of the conflict lay in tensions between peasants and landowners precipitated by the economic and demographic consequences of the Black Death and subsequent outbreaks of the plague. The rebellion started in Kent and Essex in late May, and on 12 June, bands of peasants gathered at Blackheath near London under the leaders Wat Tyler, John Ball, and Jack Straw. John of Gaunt&#x27;s Savoy Palace was burnt down. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Simon Sudbury, who was also Lord Chancellor, and Lord High Treasurer Robert Hales were both killed by the rebels, who were demanding the complete abolition of serfdom. The King, sheltered within the Tower of London with his councillors, agreed that the Crown did not have the forces to disperse the rebels and that the only feasible option was to negotiate.

It is unclear how much Richard, who was still only fourteen years old, was involved in these deliberations, although historians have suggested that he was among the proponents of negotiations. The King set out by the River Thames on 13 June, but the large number of people thronging the banks at Greenwich made it impossible for him to land, forcing him to return to the Tower. The next day, Friday, 14 June, he set out by horse and met the rebels at Mile End. He agreed to the rebels&#x27; demands, but this move only emboldened them; they continued their looting and killings. Richard met Wat Tyler again the next day at Smithfield and reiterated that the demands would be met, but the rebel leader was not convinced of the King&#x27;s sincerity. The King&#x27;s men grew restive, an altercation broke out, and William Walworth, the Lord Mayor of London, pulled Tyler down from his horse and killed him. The situation became tense once the rebels realised what had happened, but the King acted with calm resolve and, saying &quot;I am your captain, follow me!&quot;, he led the mob away from the scene. Walworth meanwhile gathered a force to surround the peasant army, but the King granted clemency and allowed the rebels to disperse and return to their homes.

The King soon revoked the charters of freedom and pardon that he had granted, and as disturbances continued in other parts of the country, he personally went into Essex to suppress the rebellion. On 28 June at Billericay, he defeated the last rebels in a small skirmish and effectively ended the Peasants&#x27; Revolt. In the following days rebel leaders, such as John Ball, were hunted down and executed. Despite his young age, Richard had shown great courage and determination in his handling of the rebellion. It is likely, though, that the events impressed upon him the dangers of disobedience and threats to royal authority, and helped shape the absolutist attitudes to kingship that would later prove fatal to his reign.

=== Coming of age ===
It is only with the Peasants&#x27; Revolt that Richard starts to emerge clearly in the annals. One of his first significant acts after the rebellion was to marry Anne of Bohemia, daughter of Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor, on 20 January 1382. It had diplomatic significance; in the division of Europe caused by the Western Schism, Bohemia and the Holy Roman Empire were seen as potential allies against France in the ongoing Hundred Years&#x27; War. Nonetheless, the marriage was not popular in England. Despite great sums of money awarded to the Empire, the political alliance never resulted in any military victories. Furthermore, the marriage was childless. Anne died from the plague in 1394, greatly mourned by her husband.

Michael de la Pole had been instrumental in the marriage negotiations; he had the King&#x27;s confidence and gradually became more involved at court and in government as Richard came of age. De la Pole came from an upstart merchant family. When Richard made him chancellor in 1383, and created him Earl of Suffolk two years later, this antagonised the more established nobility. Another member of the close circle around the King was Robert de Vere, Earl of Oxford, who in this period emerged as the King&#x27;s favourite. Richard&#x27;s close friendship to de Vere was also disagreeable to the political establishment. This displeasure was exacerbated by the earl&#x27;s elevation to the new title of Duke of Ireland in 1386. The chronicler Thomas Walsingham suggested the relationship between the King and de Vere was of a homosexual nature, due to a resentment Walsingham had toward the King.

Tensions came to a head over the approach to the war in France. While the court party preferred negotiations, Gaunt and Buckingham urged a large-scale campaign to protect English possessions. Instead, a so-called crusade led by Henry le Despenser, Bishop of Norwich, was dispatched, which failed miserably. Faced with this setback on the continent, Richard turned his attention instead towards France&#x27;s ally, the Kingdom of Scotland. In 1385, the King himself led a punitive expedition to the north, but the effort came to nothing, and the army had to return without ever engaging the Scots in battle. Meanwhile, only an uprising in Ghent prevented a French invasion of southern England. The relationship between Richard and his uncle John of Gaunt deteriorated further with military failure, and Gaunt left England to pursue his claim to the throne of Castile in 1386 amid rumours of a plot against his person. With Gaunt gone, the unofficial leadership of the growing dissent against the King and his courtiers passed to Buckinghamwho had by now been created Duke of Gloucesterand Richard Fitzalan, 4th Earl of Arundel.

=== First crisis of 1386–1388 ===
The threat of a French invasion did not subside, but instead grew stronger into 1386. At the parliament of October that year, Michael de la Polein his capacity of chancellorrequested taxation of an unprecedented level for the defence of the realm. Rather than consenting, the parliament responded by refusing to consider any request until the chancellor was removed. The parliament (later known as the Wonderful Parliament) was presumably working with the support of Gloucester and Arundel. The King famously responded that he would not dismiss as much as a scullion from his kitchen at parliament&#x27;s request. Only when threatened with deposition was Richard forced to give in and let de la Pole go. A commission was set up to review and control royal finances for a year.

Richard was deeply perturbed by this affront to his royal prerogative, and from February to November 1387 went on a &quot;gyration&quot; (tour) of the country to muster support for his cause. By installing de Vere as Justice of Chester, he began the work of creating a loyal military power base in Cheshire. He also secured a legal ruling from Chief Justice Robert Tresilian that parliament&#x27;s conduct had been unlawful and treasonable.

On his return to London, the King was confronted by Gloucester, Arundel and Thomas de Beauchamp, 12th Earl of Warwick, who brought an appeal of treason against de la Pole, de Vere, Tresilian, and two other loyalists: the mayor of London, Nicholas Brembre, and Alexander Neville, the Archbishop of York. Richard stalled the negotiations to gain time, as he was expecting de Vere to arrive from Cheshire with military reinforcements. The three peers then joined forces with Gaunt&#x27;s son Henry Bolingbroke, Earl of Derby, and Thomas de Mowbray, Earl of Nottinghamthe group known to history as the Lords Appellant. On 20 December 1387 they intercepted de Vere at Radcot Bridge, where he and his forces were routed and he was obliged to flee the country.

Richard now had no choice but to comply with the appellants&#x27; demands; Brembre and Tresilian were condemned and executed, while de Vere and de la Polewho had by now also left the countrywere sentenced to death &quot;in absentia&quot; at the Merciless Parliament in February 1388. The appellants had now succeeded completely in breaking up the circle of favourites around the King.

== Later reign ==
=== A fragile peace ===

Richard gradually re-established royal authority in the months after the deliberations of the Merciless Parliament. The aggressive foreign policy of the Lords Appellant failed when their efforts to build a wide, anti-French coalition came to nothing, and the north of England fell victim to a Scottish incursion. Richard was now over twenty-one years old and could with confidence claim the right to govern in his own name. Furthermore, John of Gaunt returned to England in 1389 and settled his differences with the King, after which the old statesman acted as a moderating influence on English politics. Richard assumed full control of the government on 3 May 1389, claiming that the difficulties of the past years had been due solely to bad councillors. He outlined a foreign policy that reversed the actions of the appellants by seeking peace and reconciliation with France, and promised to lessen the burden of taxation on the people significantly. Richard ruled peacefully for the next eight years, having reconciled with his former adversaries. Still, later events would show that he had not forgotten the indignities he perceived. In particular, the execution of his former teacher Sir Simon de Burley was an insult not easily forgotten.

With national stability secured, Richard began negotiating a permanent peace with France. A proposal put forward in 1393 would have greatly expanded the territory of Aquitaine possessed by the English Crown. However, the plan failed because it included a requirement that the English king pay homage to the King of France—a condition that proved unacceptable to the English public. Instead, in 1396, a truce was agreed to, which was to last 28 years. As part of the truce, Richard agreed to marry Isabella of Valois, daughter of Charles VI of France, when she came of age. There were some misgivings about the betrothal, in particular, because the princess was then only six years old and thus would not be able to produce an heir to the throne of England for many years.

Although Richard sought peace with France, he took a different approach to the situation in Ireland. The English lordships in Ireland were in danger of being overrun by the Gaelic Irish kingdoms, and the Anglo-Irish lords were pleading for the King to intervene. In the autumn of 1394, Richard left for Ireland, where he remained until May 1395. His army of more than 8,000 men was the largest force brought to the island during the late Middle Ages. The invasion was a success, and a number of Irish chieftains submitted to English overlordship. It was one of the most successful achievements of Richard&#x27;s reign, and strengthened his support at home, although the consolidation of the English position in Ireland proved to be short-lived.
=== Second crisis of 1397–1399 ===
The period that historians refer to as the &quot;tyranny&quot; of Richard II began towards the end of the 1390s. The King had Gloucester, Arundel and Warwick arrested in July 1397. The timing of these arrests and Richard&#x27;s motivation are not entirely clear. Although one chronicle suggested that a plot was being planned against the King, there is no evidence that this was the case. It is more likely that Richard had simply come to feel strong enough to safely retaliate against these three men for their role in events of 1386–1388 and eliminate them as threats to his power.

Arundel was the first of the three to be brought to trial, at the parliament of September 1397. After a heated quarrel with the King, he was condemned and executed. Gloucester was being held prisoner by the Earl of Nottingham at Calais while awaiting his trial. As the time for the trial drew near, Nottingham brought news that Gloucester was dead. It is thought likely that the King had ordered him to be killed to avoid the disgrace of executing a prince of the blood.

Warwick was also condemned to death, but his life was spared and his sentence reduced to life imprisonment. Arundel&#x27;s brother Thomas Arundel, the Archbishop of Canterbury, was exiled for life. Richard then took his persecution of adversaries to the localities. While recruiting retainers for himself in various counties, he prosecuted local men who had been loyal to the appellants. The fines levied on these men brought great revenues to the crown, although contemporary chroniclers raised questions about the legality of the proceedings.


These actions were made possible primarily through the collusion of John of Gaunt, but with the support of a large group of other magnates, many of whom were rewarded with new titles, and were disparagingly referred to as Richard&#x27;s &quot;duketti&quot;. These included the former Lords Appellant
* Henry Bolingbroke, Earl of Derby, who was made Duke of Hereford, and
* Thomas de Mowbray, Earl of Nottingham, who was created Duke of Norfolk.

Also among them were
* John Holland, the King&#x27;s half-brother, promoted from Earl of Huntingdon to Duke of Exeter
* Thomas Holland, the King&#x27;s nephew, promoted from Earl of Kent to Duke of Surrey
* Edward of Norwich, Earl of Rutland, the King&#x27;s cousin, who received Gloucester&#x27;s French title of Duke of Aumale
* Gaunt&#x27;s son John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset, who was made Marquess of Somerset and Marquess of Dorset
* John Montacute, 3rd Earl of Salisbury
* Lord Thomas le Despenser, who became Earl of Gloucester.
With the forfeited lands of the convicted appellants, the King could reward these men with lands suited to their new ranks.

A threat to Richard&#x27;s authority still existed, however, in the form of the House of Lancaster, represented by John of Gaunt and his son Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Hereford. The House of Lancaster not only possessed greater wealth than any other family in England, they were of royal descent and, as such, likely candidates to succeed the childless Richard.

Discord broke out in the inner circles of court in December 1397, when Bolingbroke and Mowbray became embroiled in a quarrel. According to Bolingbroke, Mowbray had claimed that the two, as former Lords Appellant, were next in line for royal retribution. Mowbray vehemently denied these charges, as such a claim would have amounted to treason. A parliamentary committee decided that the two should settle the matter by battle, but at the last moment Richard exiled the two dukes instead: Mowbray for life, Bolingbroke for ten years.

In 1398 Richard summoned the Parliament of Shrewsbury, often called the Revenge Parliament and understood to have met in the Abbey of that town, which declared all the acts of the Merciless Parliament to be null and void, and announced that no restraint could legally be put on the King. It delegated all parliamentary power to a committee of twelve lords and six commoners chosen from the King&#x27;s friends, making Richard an absolute ruler unbound by the necessity of gathering a Parliament again.

On 3 February 1399, Gaunt died. Rather than allowing Bolingbroke to succeed, Richard extended the term of his exile to life and expropriated his properties. The King felt safe from Bolingbroke, who was residing in Paris, since the French had little interest in any challenge to Richard and his peace policy. Richard left the country in May for another expedition in Ireland.

=== Court culture ===

In the last years of Richard&#x27;s reign, and particularly in the months after the suppression of the appellants in 1397, the King enjoyed a virtual monopoly on power in the country, a relatively uncommon situation in medieval England. In this period a particular court culture was allowed to emerge, one that differed sharply from that of earlier times. A new form of address developed; where the King previously had been addressed simply as &quot;highness&quot;, now &quot;royal majesty&quot;, or &quot;high majesty&quot; were often used. It was said that on solemn festivals Richard would sit on his throne in the royal hall for hours without speaking, and anyone on whom his eyes fell had to bow his knees to the King. The inspiration for this new sumptuousness and emphasis on dignity came from the courts on the continent, not only the French and Bohemian courts that had been the homes of Richard&#x27;s two wives, but also the court that his father had maintained while residing in Aquitaine.

Richard&#x27;s approach to kingship was rooted in his strong belief in the royal prerogative, the inspiration of which can be found in his early youth, when his authority was challenged first by the Peasants&#x27; Revolts and then by the Lords Appellant. Richard rejected the approach his grandfather Edward III had taken to the nobility. Edward&#x27;s court had been a martial one, based on the interdependence between the king and his most trusted noblemen as military captains. In Richard&#x27;s view, this put a dangerous amount of power in the hands of the baronage. To avoid dependence on the nobility for military recruitment, he pursued a policy of peace towards France. At the same time, he developed his own private military retinue, larger than that of any English king before him, and gave them livery badges with his White Hart. He was then free to develop a courtly atmosphere in which the king was a distant, venerated figure, and art and culture, rather than warfare, were at the centre.

== Patronage and the arts ==
As part of Richard&#x27;s programme of asserting his authority, he also tried to cultivate the royal image. Unlike any other English king before him, he had himself portrayed in panel paintings of elevated majesty, of which two survive: an over life-size Westminster Abbey portrait (c. 1390), and the Wilton Diptych (1394–1399), a portable work probably intended to accompany Richard on his Irish campaign. It is one of the few surviving English examples of the courtly International Gothic style of painting that was developed in the courts of the Continent, especially Prague and Paris. Richard&#x27;s expenditure on jewellery, rich textiles and metalwork was far higher than on paintings, but as with his illuminated manuscripts, there are hardly any surviving works that can be connected with him, except for a crown, &quot;one of the finest achievements of the Gothic goldsmith&quot;, that probably belonged to his wife Anne.

Among Richard&#x27;s grandest projects in the field of architecture was Westminster Hall, which was extensively rebuilt during his reign, perhaps spurred on by the completion in 1391 of John of Gaunt&#x27;s magnificent hall at Kenilworth Castle. Fifteen life-size statues of kings were placed in niches on the walls, and the hammer-beam roof by the royal carpenter Hugh Herland, &quot;the greatest creation of medieval timber architecture&quot;, allowed the original three Romanesque aisles to be replaced with a single huge open space, with a dais at the end for Richard to sit in solitary state. The rebuilding had been begun by Henry III in 1245, but had by Richard&#x27;s time been dormant for over a century.

The court&#x27;s patronage of literature is especially important because this was the period in which the English language took shape as a literary language. There is little evidence to tie Richard directly to the patronage of poetry, but it was nevertheless within his court that this culture was allowed to thrive. The greatest poet of the age, Geoffrey Chaucer, served the King as a diplomat, a customs official and a clerk of The King&#x27;s Works while producing some of his best-known work. Chaucer was also in the service of John of Gaunt, and wrote &quot;The Book of the Duchess&quot; as a eulogy to Gaunt&#x27;s wife Blanche. Chaucer&#x27;s colleague and friend John Gower wrote his &quot;Confessio Amantis&quot; on a direct commission from Richard, although he later grew disenchanted with the King.

Richard was interested in occult topics such as geomancy, which he viewed as a greater discipline that included philosophy, science, and alchemic elements and commissioned a book on, and sponsored writing and discussion of them in his court.

== Downfall ==
=== Deposition ===

In June 1399, Louis I, Duke of Orléans, gained control of the court of the insane Charles VI of France. The policy of &quot;rapprochement&quot; with the English crown did not suit Louis&#x27;s political ambitions, and for this reason he found it opportune to allow Bolingbroke to leave for England. With a small group of followers, Bolingbroke landed at Ravenspurn in Yorkshire towards the end of June 1399. Meeting with Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland, who had his own misgivings about the King, Bolingbroke insisted that his only object was to regain his own patrimony. Northumberland took him at his word and declined to interfere. The King had taken most of his household knights and the loyal members of his nobility with him to Ireland, so Bolingbroke experienced little resistance as he moved south. Keeper of the Realm Edmund, Duke of York, had little choice but to side with Bolingbroke. Meanwhile, Richard was delayed in his return from Ireland and did not land in Wales until 24 July. He made his way to Conwy, where on 12 August he met with Northumberland for negotiations. On 19 August, Richard surrendered to Bolingbroke at Flint Castle, promising to abdicate if his life were spared. Both men then made their way to Chester Castle where Richard was held in the crypt of the Agricola Tower. On the journey to London, the indignant king had to ride all the way behind Bolingbroke. On arrival, he was imprisoned in the Tower of London on 1 September.

Bolingbroke was by now fully determined to take the throne, but presenting a rationale for this action proved a dilemma. It was argued that Richard, through his tyranny and misgovernment, had rendered himself unworthy of being king. However, Bolingbroke was not next in line to the throne; the heir presumptive was Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March, great-grandson of Edward III&#x27;s second surviving son, Lionel, Duke of Clarence. Bolingbroke&#x27;s father, John of Gaunt, was Edward&#x27;s third son to survive to adulthood. The problem was solved by emphasising Bolingbroke&#x27;s descent in a direct &quot;male&quot; line, whereas March&#x27;s descent was through his grandmother, Philippa of Clarence.
According to the official record, read by the Archbishop of Canterbury during an assembly of lords and commons at Westminster Hall on Tuesday 30 September, Richard gave up his crown willingly and ratified his deposition citing as a reason his own unworthiness as a monarch. In contrast, the &quot;Traison et Mort Chronicle&quot; suggests otherwise. It describes a meeting between Richard and Henry that took place one day before the parliament&#x27;s session. The King succumbed to blind rage, ordered his own release from the Tower, called his cousin a traitor, demanded to see his wife, and swore revenge, throwing down his bonnet, while Henry refused to do anything without parliamentary approval. When parliament met to discuss Richard&#x27;s fate, John Trevor, Bishop of St Asaph, read thirty-three articles of deposition that were unanimously accepted by lords and commons. On 1 October 1399, Richard II was formally deposed. On 13 October, the feast day of Edward the Confessor, Henry was crowned king.

=== Death ===
Henry had agreed to let Richard live after his abdication. This changed when it was revealed that the earls of Huntingdon, Kent, and Salisbury, and Lord Despenser, and possibly also the Earl of Rutlandall now demoted from the ranks they had been given by Richardwere planning to murder the new king and restore Richard in the Epiphany Rising. Although averted, the plot highlighted the danger of allowing Richard to live. He is thought to have starved to death in captivity in Pontefract Castle on or around 14 February 1400, although there is some question over the date and manner of his death. His body was taken south from Pontefract and displayed in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral on 17 February before burial in King&#x27;s Langley Priory on 6 March.

Rumours that Richard was still alive persisted, but never gained much credence in England; in Scotland, however, a man identified as Richard came into the hands of Regent Albany, lodged in Stirling Castle, and serving as the notionaland perhaps reluctantfigurehead of various anti-Lancastrian and Lollard intrigues in England. Henry IV&#x27;s government dismissed him as an impostor, and several sources from both sides of the border suggest the man had a mental illness, one also describing him as a &quot;beggar&quot; by the time of his death in 1419, but he was buried as a king in Blackfriars, Stirling, the local Dominican friary. Meanwhile, Henry Vin an effort both to atone for his father&#x27;s act of murder and to silence the rumours of Richard&#x27;s survivalhad decided to have the body at King&#x27;s Langley reinterred in Westminster Abbey on 4 December 1413. Here Richard himself had prepared an elaborate tomb, where the remains of his wife Anne were already entombed.

== Character and assessment ==
Contemporary writers, even those less sympathetic to the King, agreed that Richard was a &quot;most beautiful king&quot;, though with an unmanly &quot;face which was white, rounded and feminine.&quot; He was athletic and tall; when his tomb was opened in 1871, he was found to be six feet (1.82 m) tall. He was also intelligent and well read, and when agitated he had a tendency to stammer. While the Westminster Abbey portrait probably shows a good similarity of the King, the Wilton Diptych portrays him as significantly younger than he was at the time; it must be assumed that he had a beard by this point. Religiously, he was orthodox, and particularly towards the end of his reign he became a strong opponent of the Lollard heresy. He was particularly devoted to the cult of Edward the Confessor, and around 1395 he had his own coat of arms impaled with the mythical arms of the Confessor. Though not a warrior king like his grandfather, Richard nevertheless enjoyed tournaments, as well as hunting.

The popular view of Richard has more than anything been influenced by Shakespeare&#x27;s play about the King, &quot;Richard II&quot;. Shakespeare&#x27;s Richard was a cruel, vindictive, and irresponsible king, who attained a semblance of greatness only after his fall from power. Writing a work of fiction, Shakespeare took many liberties and made great omissions, basing his play on works by writers such as Edward Hall and Samuel Daniel, who in turn based their writings on contemporary chroniclers such as Thomas Walsingham. Hall and Daniel were part of Tudor historiography, which was highly unsympathetic to Richard. The Tudor orthodoxy, reinforced by Shakespeare, saw a continuity in civil discord starting with Richard&#x27;s misrule that did not end until Henry VII&#x27;s accession in 1485. The idea that Richard was to blame for the later-15th century Wars of the Roses was prevalent as late as the 19th century, but came to be challenged in the 20th. Some recent historians prefer to look at the Wars of the Roses in isolation from the reign of Richard II.

Richard&#x27;s mental state has been a major issue of historical debate since the first academic historians started treating the subject in the 19th century. One of the first modern historians to deal with Richard II as a king and as a person was Bishop Stubbs. Stubbs argued that towards the end of his reign, Richard&#x27;s mind &quot;was losing its balance altogether.&quot; Historian Anthony Steel, who wrote a full-scale biography of the King in 1941, took a psychiatric approach to the issue, and concluded that Richard had schizophrenia. This was challenged by V. H. Galbraith, who argued that there was no historical basis for such a diagnosis, a line that has also been followed by later historians of the period, such as Anthony Goodman and Anthony Tuck. Nigel Saul, who wrote an academic biography of Richard II in 1997 concedes thateven though there is no basis for assuming the King had a mental illnesshe showed clear signs of a narcissistic personality, and towards the end of his reign &quot;Richard&#x27;s grasp on reality was becoming weaker.&quot;

One of the primary historiographical questions surrounding Richard concerns his political agenda and the reasons for its failure. His kingship was thought to contain elements of the early modern absolute monarchy as exemplified by the Tudor dynasty. More recently, Richard&#x27;s concept of kingship has been seen by some as not so different from that of his antecedents, and that it was exactly by staying within the framework of traditional monarchy that he was able to achieve as much as he did. Yet his actions were too extreme and too abrupt. For one, the absence of war was meant to reduce the burden of taxation, and so help Richard&#x27;s popularity with the Commons in parliament. However, this promise was never fulfilled, as the cost of the royal retinue, the opulence of court and Richard&#x27;s lavish patronage of his favourites proved as expensive as war had been, without offering commensurate benefits. As for his policy of military retaining, this was later emulated by Edward IV and Henry VII, but Richard II&#x27;s exclusive reliance on the county of Cheshire hurt his support from the rest of the country. Simon Walker writes: &quot;What he sought was, in contemporary terms, neither unjustified nor unattainable; it was the manner of his seeking that betrayed him.&quot;

<text>A non-governmental organization (NGO) is an independent, typically nonprofit organization that operates outside government control, though it may get a significant percentage of its funding from government or corporate sources. NGOs often focus on humanitarian or social issues but can also include clubs and associations offering services to members. Some NGOs, like the World Economic Forum, may also act as lobby groups for corporations. Unlike international organizations (IOs), which directly interact with sovereign states and governments, NGOs are independent from them.

The term as it is used today was first introduced in Article 71 of the newly formed United Nations Charter in 1945. While there is no fixed or formal definition for what NGOs are, they are generally defined as nonprofit entities that are independent of governmental influence—although they may receive government funding.

According to the UN Department of Global Communications, an NGO is &quot;a not-for profit, voluntary citizen&#x27;s group that is organized on a local, national or international level to address issues in support of the public good&quot;. The term &quot;NGO&quot; is used inconsistently, and is sometimes used synonymously with &quot;civil society organization&quot; (CSO), which is any association founded by citizens. In some countries, NGOs are known as nonprofit organizations while political parties and trade unions are sometimes considered NGOs as well.

NGOs are classified by (1) orientation- entailing the type of activities an NGO undertakes, such as activities involving human rights, consumer protection, environmentalism, health, or development; and (2) level of operation, which indicates the scale at which an organization works: local, regional, national, or international.

Russia had about 277,000 NGOs in 2008. India is estimated to have had about 2 million NGOs in 2009 (approximately one per 600 Indians), many more than the number of the country&#x27;s primary schools and health centers. The United States, by comparison, has approximately 1.5 million NGOs.

== Types ==
NGOs further the social goals of their members (or founders): improving the natural environment, encouraging the observance of human rights, improving the welfare of the disadvantaged, or representing a corporate agenda. Their goals cover a wide range of issues. They may fund local NGOs, institutions and projects, and implement projects.

NGOs can be in the following ways;:

# orientation, i.e. the type of activities an NGO undertakes, such as activities involving human rights, consumer protection, environmentalism, health, or development.
# level of operation, which indicates the scale at which an organization works: local, regional, national, or international.

=== Orientation ===
* Charity — often a top-down effort, with little participation or input from beneficiaries. They include NGOs directed at meeting the needs of disadvantaged people and groups.
* Service — includes NGOs that provide healthcare (including family planning) and education.
* Participatory — self-help projects with local involvement in the form of money, tools, land, materials, or labor
* Empowerment — aim to help poor people to understand the social, political, and economic factors affecting their lives, and to increase awareness of their power to control their lives. With maximum involvement by the beneficiaries, the NGOs are facilitators.
* Professional (trade) union (association) – a voluntary association or union of people with common interests including spots, culture, others, i.e. Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, FIFA

=== Level of operation ===
* Community-based organizations (CBOs) — popular initiatives which can raise the consciousness of the urban poor, helping them understand their right to services, and providing such services.
* City-wide organizations — include chambers of commerce and industry, coalitions of business, ethnic or educational groups, and community organizations.
* State NGOs — include state-level organizations, associations, and groups. Some state NGOs are guided by national and international NGOs.
* National NGOs — an NGO that exists in only one country. These include national organizations such as YMCAs and YWCAs, professional associations, and similar groups. Some have state or city branches, and assist local NGOs.
* International NGOs (INGOs) — range from secular agencies, such as Save the Children, to religious groups. They may fund local NGOs, institutions and projects, and implement projects.

=== Other terms/acronyms ===
Similar terms include third-sector organization (TSO), nonprofit organization (NPO), voluntary organization (VO), civil society organization (CSO), grassroots organization (GO), social movement organization (SMO), private voluntary organization (PVO), self-help organization (SHO), and non-state actors (NSAs). Numerous variations exist for the NGO acronym, either due to language, region, or specificity.

Some Romance languages use the synonymous abbreviation &quot;ONG&quot;; for example:
* 
* 

Other acronyms that are typically used to describe non-governmental organizations include:
* BINGO: Business-friendly international NGO or Big international NGO
* CSO: Civil society organization
* ENGO: Environmental NGO — organizations that advocate for the environment, such as Greenpeace and the WWF.
* DONGO: Donor-organized NGO
* GONGO: Government-organized non-governmental organization — often used derogatorily, these are government-backed NGOs that are set up to advocate on behalf of a repressive regime on the international stage.
* GSO: Grassroots Support Organization
* INGO: International NGO
* MANGO: Market advocacy NGO
* NGDO: Non-governmental development organization
* NNGO: Northern (UK) NGO
* PANGO: Party NGO — addressing political matters
* PVDO: Private voluntary development organization — the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) refers to NGOs as &quot;private voluntary organizations&quot;.
* Quango: Quasi-autonomous NGO — often used derogatorily, these organizations rely on public funding. They are prevalent in the United Kingdom (where there are more than 1,200), Ireland, and the Commonwealth.
* SBO: Social benefit organization — a goal-oriented designation
* SCO: Social change organization
* SNGO: Southern (UK) NGO
* TANGO: Technical assistance NGO
* TNGO: Transnational NGO — coined during the 1970s due to the increase of environmental and economic issues in the global community. TNGOs exist in two (or more) countries.
* YOUNGO: Youth NGOs - advocacing for youth rights.

== Activities ==
Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) play a vital role in improving the lives of people who have been affected by natural disasters or are facing other challenges. NGOs can act as implementers, catalysts, and partners to provide essential goods and services to those in need. They work to mobilize resources, both financial and human, to ensure that aid is delivered in a timely and effective manner.

NGOs also play a critical role in driving change by advocating for policies and practices that benefit disadvantaged communities. They often work in partnership with other organizations, including government agencies, to address complex challenges that require a collaborative approach. One of the key strengths of NGOs is their ability to work at the grassroots level and to connect with communities directly. This allows them to gain a deep understanding of the issues facing people and to tailor their services to meet the specific needs of each community.

NGOs vary by method; some are primarily advocacy groups, and others conduct programs and activities. Oxfam, concerned with poverty alleviation, may provide needy people with the equipment and skills to obtain food and drinking water; the Forum for Fact-finding Documentation and Advocacy (FFDA) helps provide legal assistance to victims of human-rights abuses. The Afghanistan Information Management Services provide specialized technical products and services to support development activities implemented on the ground by other organizations. Management techniques are crucial to project success.

The World Bank classifies NGO activity into two general categories:

# operational NGOs, whose primary function is the design and implementation of development-related projects
# advocacy NGOs, whose primary function is to defend or promote a particular cause and who seek to influence the policies and practices of International governmental organisations (IGOs).

NGOs may also conduct both activities: operational NGOs will use campaigning techniques if they face issues in the field, which could be remedied by policy change, and campaigning NGOs (such as human-rights organizations) often have programs which assist individual victims for whom they are trying to advocate.

=== Operational ===
Operational NGOs seek to &quot;achieve small-scale change directly through projects&quot;, mobilizing financial resources, materials, and volunteers to create local programs. They hold large-scale fundraising events and may apply to governments and organizations for grants or contracts to raise money for projects. Operational NGOs often have a hierarchical structure; their headquarters are staffed by professionals who plan projects, create budgets, keep accounts, and report to and communicate with operational fieldworkers on projects. They are most often associated with the delivery of services or environmental issues, emergency relief, and public welfare. Operational NGOs may be subdivided into relief or development organizations, service-delivery or participatory, religious or secular, and public or private. Although operational NGOs may be community-based, many are national or international. The defining activity of an operational NGO is the implementation of projects.

=== Advocacy ===
Advocacy NGOs or campaigning NGOs seek to &quot;achieve large-scale change promoted indirectly through the influence of the political system&quot;. They require an active, efficient group of professional members who can keep supporters informed and motivated. Campaigning NGOs must plan and host demonstrations and events which will attract media, their defining activity.

Campaigning NGOs often deal with issues related to human rights, women&#x27;s rights, and children&#x27;s rights, and their primary purpose is to defend (or promote) a specific cause.

=== Public relations ===
Non-governmental organisations need healthy public relations in order to meet their goals, and use sophisticated public-relations campaigns to raise funds and deal with governments. Interest groups may be politically important, influencing social and political outcomes. A code of ethics was established in 2002 by the World Association of Non-Governmental Organizations.

== Structure ==

=== Staffing ===
Some NGOs rely on paid staff while others are based on volunteers. Although many NGOs use international staff in developing countries, others rely on local employees or volunteers. Foreign staff may satisfy a donor who wants to see the supported project managed by a person from an industrialized country. The expertise of these employees (or volunteers) may be counterbalanced by several factors, such as; the cost of foreigners is typically higher, they have no grassroots connections in the country, and local expertise may be undervalued. By the end of 1995, Concern Worldwide (an international anti-poverty NGO) employed 174 foreigners and just over 5,000 local staff in Haiti and ten developing countries in Africa and Asia.

On average, employees in NGOs earn 11-12% less compared to employees of for-profit organizations and government workers with the same number of qualifications . However, in many cases NGOs employees receive more fringe benefits.

=== Funding ===
NGOs are usually funded by donations, but some avoid formal funding and are run by volunteers. NGOs may have charitable status, or may be tax-exempt in recognition of their social, political, religious, or other purposes. Since the end of World War II, NGOs have had an increased role in international development, particularly in the fields of humanitarian assistance and poverty alleviation.

Funding sources include membership dues, the sale of goods and services, grants from international institutions or national governments, corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds and private donations. Although the term &quot;non-governmental organization&quot; implies independence from governments, many NGOs depend on government funding; one-fourth of Oxfam&#x27;s US$162 million 1998 income was donated by the British government and the EU, and World Vision United States collected $55 million worth of goods in 1998 from the American government. Several EU grants provide funds accessible to NGOs.

Government funding of NGOs is controversial, since &quot;the whole point of humanitarian intervention was precise that NGOs and civil society had both a right and an obligation to respond with acts of aid and solidarity to people in need or being subjected to repression or want by the forces that controlled them, whatever the governments concerned might think about the matter.&quot; Some NGOs, such as Greenpeace, do not accept funding from governments or intergovernmental organizations. The 1999 budget of the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) was over $540 million.

In America, government funding of NGOs relating to immigration is common, and is one of the stated methods the Office of Refugee Resettlement uses to help integrate immigrants to America. Government funding sometimes accounts for the vast majority of overall funding for these NGOs, for example Global Refuge received 180 million dollars of its 207 million dollar budget from federal funding. In recent years, government contracts to non-profits have exploded both in number and size. The Budget for the Office of Refugee Resettlement has increased from 1.8 billion in 2018 to 6.3 billion in 2022. Critics point to the million-dollar salaries of CEOS and the use of funds for &quot;music therapy&quot; and &quot;pet therapy&quot; as a worrying sign that the money might not be appropriated to help the migrant crisis, but rather as a political move to keep wealthy backers loyal.

=== Overhead ===
Overhead is the amount of money spent on running an NGO, rather than on projects. It includes office expenses, salaries, and banking and bookkeeping costs. An NGO&#x27;s percentage of its overall budget spent on overhead is often used to judge it; less than four percent is considered good. According to the World Association of Non-Governmental Organizations, more than 86 percent should be spent on programs (less than 20 percent on overhead). The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria has guidelines of five to seven percent overhead to receive funding; the World Bank typically allows 37 percent. A high percentage of overhead relative to total expenditures can make it more difficult to generate funds. High overhead costs may also generate public criticism.

A sole focus on overhead, however, can be counterproductive. Research published by the Urban Institute and Stanford University&#x27;s Center for Social Innovation have shown that rating agencies create incentives for NGOs to lower (and hide) overhead costs, which may reduce organizational effectiveness by starving organizations of infrastructure to deliver services. An alternative rating system would provide, in addition to financial data, a qualitative evaluation of an organization&#x27;s transparency and governance:
# An assessment of program effectiveness
# Evaluation of feedback mechanisms for donors and beneficiaries
# Allowing a rated organization to respond to an evaluation by a rating agency

=== Monitoring and control ===
In a March 2000 report on United Nations reform priorities, former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan favored international humanitarian intervention as the responsibility to protect citizens from ethnic cleansing, genocide, and crimes against humanity. After that report, the Canadian government launched its Responsibility to Protect (R2P) project outlining the issue of humanitarian intervention. The R2P project has wide applications, and among its more controversial has been the Canadian government&#x27;s use of R2P to justify its intervention in the coup in Haiti.

Large corporations have increased their corporate social responsibility departments to preempt NGO campaigns against corporate practices. Collaboration between corporations and NGOs risks co-option of the weaker partner, typically the NGO.

In December 2007, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs S. Ward Casscells established an International Health Division of Force Health Protection &amp; Readiness. Part of International Health&#x27;s mission is to communicate with NGOs about areas of mutual interest. Department of Defense Directive 3000.05, in 2005, required the US Defense Department to regard stability-enhancing activities as equally important as combat. In compliance with international law, the department has developed a capacity to improve essential services in areas of conflict (such as Iraq) where customary lead agencies like the State Department and USAID have difficulty operating. International Health cultivates collaborative, arm&#x27;s-length relationships with NGOs, recognizing their independence, expertise, and honest-broker status.

== History ==
International non-governmental organizations date back to at least the late 18th century, and there were an estimated 1,083 NGOs by 1914. International NGOs were important to the anti-slavery and women&#x27;s suffrage movements, and peaked at the time of the 1932–1934 World Disarmament Conference.

The term became popular with the 1945 founding of the United Nations in 1945; Article 71 in Chapter X of its charter stipulated consultative status for organizations which are neither governments nor member states. An international NGO was first defined in resolution 288 (X) of the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) on February 27, 1950, as &quot;any international organization that is not founded by an international treaty&quot;. The role of NGOs and other &quot;major groups&quot; in sustainable development was recognized in Chapter 27 of Agenda 21. The rise and fall of international NGOs matches contemporary events, waxing in periods of growth and waning in times of crisis. The United Nations gave non-governmental organizations observer status at its assemblies and some meetings. According to the UN, an NGO is a private, not-for-profit organization which is independent of government control and is not merely an opposition political party. An observer has access to most meetings and relevant documentation.

The rapid development of the non-governmental sector occurred in Western countries as a result of the restructuring of the welfare state. Globalization of that process occurred after the fall of the communist system, and was an important part of the Washington Consensus.

Twentieth-century globalization increased the importance of NGOs. International treaties and organizations, such as the World Trade Organization, focused on capitalist interests. To counterbalance this trend, NGOs emphasize humanitarian issues, development aid, and sustainable development. An example is the World Social Forum, a rival convention of the World Economic Forum held each January in Davos, Switzerland. The fifth World Social Forum, in Porto Alegre, Brazil in January 2005, was attended by representatives of over 1,000 NGOs. The 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, attended by about 2,400 representatives, was the first to demonstrate the power of international NGOs in environmental issues and sustainable development. Transnational NGO networking has become extensive.

== Legal status ==
Although NGOs are subject to national laws and practices, four main groups may be found worldwide:
* Unincorporated and voluntary association
* Trusts, charities, and foundations
* Not-for-profit companies and co-operatives
* Entities formed (or registered) under special NGO or nonprofit laws

The Council of Europe drafted the European Convention on the Recognition of the Legal Personality of International Non-Governmental Organisations in Strasbourg in 1986, creating a common legal basis for European NGOs. Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights protects the right to associate, which is fundamental for NGOs.

== Economic theory ==
The question whether a public project should be owned by an NGO or by the government has been studied in economics using the tools of the incomplete contracting theory. According to this theory, not every detail of a relationship between decision makers can be contractually specified. Hence, in the future, the parties will bargain with each other to adapt their relationship to changing circumstances. Ownership matters because it determines the parties&#x27; willingness to make non-contractible investments. In the context of private firms, Oliver Hart has shown that the party with the more important investment task should be owner. Yet, Besley and Ghatak have argued that in the context of public projects the investment technology does not matter.

Specifically, even when the government is the key investor, ownership by an NGO is optimal if and only if the NGO has a larger valuation of the project than the government. However, the general validity of this argument has been questioned by follow-up research. In particular, ownership by the party with the larger valuation need not be optimal when the public good is partially excludable, when both NGO and government may be indispensable, or when the NGO and the government have different bargaining powers. Moreover, the investment technology can matter for the optimal ownership structure when there are bargaining frictions, when the parties interact repeatedly or when the parties are asymmetrically informed.

== Influence on world affairs ==
Service-delivery NGOs provide public goods and services which governments of developing countries are unable to provide due to a lack of resources. They may be contractors or collaborate with government agencies to reduce the cost of public goods. Capacity-building NGOs affect &quot;culture, structure, projects and daily operations&quot;.

Advocacy and public-education NGOs aim to modify behavior and ideas through communication, crafting messages to promote social, political, or environmental changes (and as news organisations have cut foreign bureaux, many NGOs have begun to expand into news reporting). Movement NGOs mobilize the public and coordinate large-scale collective activities to advance an activist agenda.

Since the end of the Cold War, more NGOs in developed countries have pursued international outreach. By being involved in local and national social resistance, they have influenced domestic policy change in the developing world. Specialized NGOs have forged partnerships, built networks, and found policy niches.

=== Track II diplomacy ===

Track II diplomacy (or dialogue) is transnational coordination by non-official members of the government, including epistemic communities and former policymakers or analysts. It aims to help policymakers and policy analysts reach a common solution through unofficial discussions. Unlike official diplomacy, conducted by government officials, diplomats, and elected leaders, Track II diplomacy involves experts, scientists, professors and other figures who are not part of government affairs.

===World NGO Day===

World NGO Day, which is observed annually on 27 February, was recognised on 17 April 2010 by 12 countries of the IX Baltic Sea NGO Forum at the eighth Summit of the Baltic Sea States in Vilnius, Lithuania. It was internationally recognised on 28 February 2014 in Helsinki, Finland by United Nations Development Programme administrator and former Prime Minister of New Zealand Helen Clark.

==== Diplomacy ====
In the context of NGOs (Non-Governmental Organizations), diplomacy refers to the practice of building and maintaining partnerships with other organizations, stakeholders, and governments to achieve common objectives related to social or environmental issues.

NGOs often work in complex environments, where multiple stakeholders have different interests and goals. Diplomacy allows NGOs to navigate these complex environments and engage in constructive dialogue with different actors to promote understanding, build consensus, and facilitate cooperation.

Effective NGO diplomacy involves building trust, fostering dialogue, and promoting transparency and accountability. NGOs may engage in diplomacy through various means such as including advocacy, lobbying, partnerships, and negotiations. By working collaboratively with other organizations and stakeholders, NGOs can achieve greater impact and reach their goals more effectively.

== Criticism ==
===Negative outcomes===
Tanzanian author and academic Issa G. Shivji has criticised NGOs in two essays: &quot;Silences in NGO discourse: The role and future of NGOs in Africa&quot; and &quot;Reflections on NGOs in Tanzania: What we are, what we are not and what we ought to be&quot;. Shivji writes that despite the good intentions of NGO leaders and activists, he is critical of the &quot;objective effects of actions, regardless of their intentions&quot;. According to Shivji, the rise of NGOs is part of a neoliberal paradigm and not motivated purely by altruism; NGOs want to change the world without understanding it, continuing an imperial relationship.

In his study of NGO involvement in Mozambique, James Pfeiffer addresses their negative effects on the country&#x27;s health. According to Pfeiffer, NGOs in Mozambique have &quot;fragmented the local health system, undermined local control of health programs, and contributed to growing local social inequality&quot;. They can be uncoordinated, creating parallel projects which divert health-service workers from their normal duties to instead serve the NGOs. This undermines local primary-healthcare efforts, and removes the government&#x27;s ability to maintain agency over its health sector. Pfeiffer suggested a collaborative model of the NGO and the DPS (the Mozambique Provincial Health Directorate); the NGO should be &quot;formally held to standard and adherence within the host country&quot;, reduce &quot;showcase&quot; projects and unsustainable parallel programs.

In her 1997 &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; article, Jessica Mathews wrote: &quot;For all their strengths, NGOs are special interests. The best of them ... often suffer from tunnel vision, judging every public act by how it affects their particular interest&quot;. NGOs are unencumbered by policy trade-offs.

According to Vijay Prashad, since the 1970s &quot;the World Bank, under Robert McNamara, championed the NGO as an alternative to the state, leaving intact global and regional relations of power and production.&quot; 

They have been questioned as &quot;too much of a good thing&quot;. Eric Werker and Faisal Ahmed made three critiques of NGOs in developing nations. Too many NGOs in a nation (particularly one ruled by a warlord) reduces an NGO&#x27;s influence, since it can easily be replaced by another NGO. Resource allocation and outsourcing to local organizations in international-development projects incurs expenses for an NGO, lessening the resources and money available to the intended beneficiaries. NGO missions tend to be paternalistic, as well as expensive.

The tax-exempt status of NGOs can result in the unintended consequence of negative value for society.

===Foreign influence===

NGOs have been accused of preserving imperialism (sometimes operating in a racialized manner in Third World countries), with a function similar to that of the clergy during the colonial era. Political philosopher Peter Hallward has called them an aristocratic form of politics, noting that ActionAid and Christian Aid &quot;effectively condoned the [2004 US-backed] coup&quot; against an elected government in Haiti and are the &quot;humanitarian face of imperialism&quot;. Movements in the Global South (such as South Africa&#x27;s Western Cape Anti-Eviction Campaign) have refused to work with NGOs, concerned that doing so would compromise their autonomy. NGOs have been accused of weakening people by allowing their funders to prioritize stability over social justice.
They have been accused of being designed by, and used as extensions of, the foreign-policy instruments of some Western countries and groups of countries. Russian president Vladimir Putin made that accusation at the 43rd Munich Security Conference in 2007, saying that NGOs &quot;are formally independent but they are purposefully financed and therefore under control&quot;.
According to Michael Bond, &quot;Most large NGOs, such as Oxfam, the Red Cross, Cafod and ActionAid, are striving to make their aid provision more sustainable. But some, mostly in the US, are still exporting the ideologies of their backers.&quot;

NGOs have been challenged as not representing the needs of the developing world, diminishing the &quot;Southern voice&quot; and preserving the North–South divide. The equality of relationships between northern and southern parts of an NGO, and between southern and northern NGOs working in partnership, has been questioned; the north may lead in advocacy and resource mobilization, and the south delivers services in the developing world. The needs of the developing world may not be addressed appropriately, as northern NGOs do not consult (or participate in) partnerships or assign unrepresentative priorities. NGOs have been accused of damaging the public sector in target countries, such as mismanagement resulting in the breakdown of public healthcare systems.

===Spreading misinformation===
NGOs have been accused of using misinformation in their campaigns out of self-interest. According to Doug Parr of Greenpeace, there had been &quot;a tendency among our critics to say that science is the only decision-making tool ... but political and commercial interests are using science as a cover for getting their way.&quot; Former policy-maker for the German branch of Friends of the Earth Jens Katjek said, &quot;If NGOs want the best for the environment, they have to learn to compromise.&quot;

===Challenges to legitimacy===

Legitimacy, an important asset of an NGO, is its perception as an &quot;independent voice&quot;. Neera Chandhoke wrote in a &quot;Journal of World-Systems Research&quot; article, &quot;To put the point starkly: are the citizens of countries of the South and their needs represented in global civil society, or are citizens as well as their needs constructed by practices of representation? And when we realize that INGOs hardly ever come face to face with the people whose interests and problems they represent, or that they are not accountable to the people they represent, matters become even more troublesome.&quot;

An NGO&#x27;s funding affects its legitimacy, and they have become increasingly dependent on a limited number of donors. Competition for funds has increased, in addition to the expectations of donors who may add conditions threatening an NGO&#x27;s independence. Dependence on official aid may dilute &quot;the willingness of NGOs to speak out on issues which are unpopular with governments&quot;, and changes in NGO funding sources have altered their function.

The scale and variety of activities in which NGOs participate have grown rapidly since 1980, and particularly since 1990. NGOs need to balance centralization and decentralization. Centralizing NGOs, particularly at the international level, can assign a common theme or set of goals. It may also be advantageous to decentralize an NGO, increasing its chances of responding flexibly and effectively to local issues by implementing projects which are modest in scale, easily monitored, produce immediate benefits, and where all involved know that corruption would be punished.

Embezzlement, fraud and financial mismanagement reduce credibility of NGOs.

<text>The British royal family comprises King Charles III and his close relations. There is no strict legal or formal definition of who is or is not a member, although the Royal Household has issued different lists outlining who is a part of the royal family. Members often support the monarch in undertaking public engagements, and pursue charitable work and interests. Members of the royal family are regarded as British and world cultural icons.

==Members==
The Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s &quot;List of the Royal Family&quot; published in August 2020 mentions all of King George VI&#x27;s descendants and their spouses (including Sarah, Duchess of York, who is divorced), along with Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s cousins with royal rank and their spouses. The list applies for the purposes of regulating the use of royal symbols and images of the family.

The royal website once said that &quot;Generally speaking, the children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren of a Sovereign, as well as their spouses, are members of the Royal Family. First cousins of the monarch may also be included. Children are included on coming of age or after they have completed their education.&quot;

The website of the royal family also provides a list of &quot;Members of the Royal Family&quot; comprising King Charles III and Queen Camilla; William, Prince of Wales and Catherine, Princess of Wales; Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex; Anne, Princess Royal; Prince Andrew, Duke of York; Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh and Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh; Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester and Birgitte, Duchess of Gloucester; Prince Edward, Duke of Kent; and Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy. Among them, the Duke of Sussex, the Duchess of Sussex, and the Duke of York do not carry out royal duties.

Other members of the royal family holding royal rank who do not carry out official duties are: Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis of Wales; Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet of Sussex; Princess Beatrice; Princess Eugenie; the Duchess of Kent; and Prince Michael of Kent and his wife.


==Titles and surnames==
 The monarch&#x27;s children and grandchildren (if they are children of the monarch&#x27;s sons), and the children of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales, are automatically entitled to be known as prince or princess with the style His or Her Royal Highness (HRH). Peerages, often dukedoms, are bestowed upon most princes prior to marriage. Peter Phillips and Zara Tindall, children of the King&#x27;s sister, Princess Anne, are, therefore, not prince and princess. Lady Louise Mountbatten-Windsor and James Mountbatten-Windsor, Earl of Wessex, though entitled to the styles &quot;Princess Louise of Edinburgh&quot; and &quot;Prince James of Edinburgh&quot;, respectively, are not called prince and princess, as their parents, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, wanted them to have more modest titles. The King reportedly wants to reduce the number of titled members of the royal family.

By tradition, wives of male members of the royal family share their husbands&#x27; title and style. Princesses by marriage do not have the title prefixed to their own name but to their husband&#x27;s; for example, the wife of Prince Michael of Kent is Princess Michael of Kent. Sons of monarchs are customarily given dukedoms upon marriage, and these peerage titles pass to their eldest sons.

Male-line descendants of King George V, including women until they marry, bear the surname Windsor. The surname of the male-line descendants of Queen Elizabeth II, except for women who marry, is Mountbatten-Windsor, reflecting the name taken by her Greek-born husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, upon his naturalisation. A surname is generally not needed by members of the royal family who are entitled to the titles of prince or princess and the style His or Her Royal Highness. Such individuals use surnames on official documents such as marriage registers, however.

== Public role ==
Members of the royal family support the monarch in &quot;state and national duties&quot;, while also carrying out charity work of their own. If the sovereign is indisposed, two counsellors of state are required to fulfil his/her role, with those eligible being restricted to the sovereign&#x27;s spouse, and the first four people in the line of succession over the age of 21. In 2022 the then Earl of Wessex and the Princess Royal were added to the list by special legislation.

Each year the family &quot;carries out over 2,000 official engagements throughout the UK and worldwide&quot;, entertaining 70,000 guests and answering 100,000 letters. Engagements include state funerals, national festivities, garden parties, receptions, and visits to the Armed Forces. Many members have served in the Armed Forces themselves, including the King&#x27;s brothers and sons. Engagements are recorded in the Court Circular, a list of daily appointments and events attended by the royal family. Public appearances are often accompanied by walkabouts, where royals greet and converse with members of the public outside events. The start of this tradition is sometimes attributed to a trip Queen Elizabeth II made in 1970 to Australia and New Zealand. Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother also interacted with crowds on a trip to Canada in 1939 and in 1940 during The Blitz in London.

Annual events attended by the royal family include the State Opening of Parliament, Trooping the Colour, and the National Service of Remembrance. According to historian Robert Lacey, Queen Elizabeth II once said that investitures of the honours recipients are the most important thing she does. Besides the King, Prince William and Princess Anne also perform investitures. Family members represent the monarch on official visits and tours to other countries as ambassadors to foster diplomatic relations. They have also attended Commonwealth meetings on the monarch&#x27;s behalf. The royal family also participates in state visits on the advice of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, which includes the welcoming of dignitaries and a formal banquet. Journalist James Forsyth has referred to the family as &quot;soft power assets&quot;.

Given the royal family&#x27;s public role and activities, it is sometimes referred to by courtiers as &quot;The Firm&quot;, a term that originated with George VI. Members of the royal family are politically and commercially independent, avoiding conflict of interest with their public roles. The royal family are considered British cultural icons, with young adults from abroad naming the family among a group of people who they most associated with British culture. Members are expected to promote British industry. Royals are typically members of the Church of England, headed by the monarch. When in Scotland they attend the Church of Scotland as members and some have served as Lord High Commissioner to the Church of Scotland.

Members of the royal family are patrons for approximately 3,000 charities, and have also started their own nonprofit organisations. The King started The Prince&#x27;s Trust, which helps young people in the UK that are disadvantaged. Princess Anne started The Princess Royal Trust for Carers, which helps unpaid carers, giving them emotional support and information about benefit claims and disability aids. The Earl and Countess of Wessex (as the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh were then known) founded the Wessex Youth Trust, since renamed The Earl and Countess of Wessex Charitable Trust, in 1999. The Prince and Princess of Wales are founding patrons of The Royal Foundation, whose projects revolve around mental health, conservation, early childhood, and emergency responders.

In 2019 following the negative reactions to the &quot;Prince Andrew &amp; the Epstein Scandal&quot; interview, the Duke of York was forced to resign from public roles; the retirement became permanent in 2020. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex permanently withdrew from royal duties in early 2020. Following these departures, there is a shortage of royal family members to cover the increasing number of patronages and engagements.

==Media and criticism==

Royal biographer Penny Junor says that the royal family has presented itself &quot;as the model family&quot; since the 1930s. Author Edward Owen wrote that during the Second World War, the monarchy sought an image of a &quot;more informal and vulnerable family&quot; that had a unifying effect on the nation during instability. In 1992, the Princess Royal and her husband Mark Phillips divorced; the Prince and Princess of Wales separated; a biography detailing the Princess&#x27;s bulimia and self-harming was published; her private telephone conversations surfaced, as did the Prince&#x27;s intimate telephone conversations with his lover, Camilla Parker Bowles; the Duke and Duchess of York separated; and photographs of the topless Duchess having her toes sucked by another man appeared in tabloids. Historian Robert Lacey said that this &quot;put paid to any claim to being a model of family life&quot;. The scandals contributed to the public&#x27;s unwillingness to pay for the repairs to Windsor Castle after the 1992 fire. A further &quot;PR disaster&quot; was the royal family&#x27;s initial response to the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in 1997.

In the 1990s, the royal family formed the Way Ahead Group, made up of senior family members and advisers and headed by Elizabeth II, in a quest to change in accordance with public opinion. The wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton in April 2011 led to a &quot;tide of goodwill&quot;, and by Elizabeth II&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee in 2012 the royal family&#x27;s image had recovered. A 2019 YouGov poll showed that two-thirds of British people were in favour of maintaining the royal family. The role and public relations of the extended royal family again came under increased scrutiny due to the Duke of York&#x27;s friendship with convicted sex offenders Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, and allegations of sexual abuse, along with his unapologetic conduct in the 2019 interview about these subjects and subsequent 2021 lawsuit. In June 2019, the royal family, several members of which advocate for environmental causes, faced criticism after it was revealed that they &quot;had doubled [their] carbon footprint from business travel&quot;.

In a 2021 interview, the Duchess of Sussex, who is of biracial heritage, relayed second-hand that there had been &quot;concerns and conversations&quot; within the royal family about the skin colour of their son, Archie, while the Duke of Sussex stated it was a single instance. The interview received a mixed reaction from the British public and media, and several of their claims were called into question. The Duke of Cambridge said the royal family were &quot;very much not a racist family&quot;. In June 2021, documents revealed that &quot;coloured immigrants or foreigners&quot; were banned by Elizabeth II&#x27;s chief financial manager at the time from working for the family as clerks in the 1960s, prompting black studies professor Kehinde Andrews to state that &quot;the royal family has a terrible record on race&quot;. In response, the palace stated that it complied &quot;in principle and in practice&quot; with anti-discrimination legislation, and that second-hand claims of &quot;conversations from over 50 years ago should not be used to draw or infer conclusions about modern-day events or operations.&quot; In March 2022 and during the Caribbean tour of the then Duke and Duchess of Cambridge as part of the Queen&#x27;s Platinum Jubilee celebrations, the family encountered criticism from a number of political figures and the press, given their past connections to colonialism and the Atlantic slave trade via the Royal African Company. Reparations for slavery emerged as a major demand of protesters during the couple&#x27;s visit. Both the then Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge have condemned slavery in their speeches, and the Prince has described acknowledging the wrongs of the past as a necessity for the Commonwealth countries to realise their potential.

Historically, the royal family and the media have benefited from each other; the family used the press to communicate with the public, while the media used the family to attract readers and viewers. With the advent of television, however, the media started paying less respect to the royal family&#x27;s privacy. Princes William and Harry have had informal arrangements with the press whereby they would be left alone by the paparazzi during their education in return for invitations to staged photograph opportunities. William has continued the practice with his family posts on Instagram. Relations between the media and British royals have been destabilized by the rise of the digital media, with the quantity of articles becoming paramount toward gaining advertising revenue, with neither side able to exercise control. In the 2000s, the phones of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, and Prince Harry and his then-girlfriend Chelsy Davy, were hacked multiple times by media outlets, most notably by a private investigator working for a &quot;News of the World&quot; journalist. A 2021 BBC documentary suggested that briefings and counter-briefings from different royal households was the reason behind the negative coverage about members of the royal family. Buckingham Palace, Clarence House and Kensington Palace, which represented the Queen, the then Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge respectively, described these suggestions as &quot;overblown and unfounded claims&quot;.

==Funding==


Senior members of the royal family, who represent the monarch, draw their income from public funds known as the sovereign grant, which is an annual payment of the British government to the monarch. It comes from the revenues of the Crown Estate, which are commercial properties owned by the Crown. Members of the royal family who receive money from the sovereign grant must be accountable to the public for it and are not allowed to make money from their name. The monarch also receives the income of the Duchy of Lancaster, and the Prince of Wales from the Duchy of Cornwall.

The security expenses for the royal family are typically covered by the Metropolitan Police rather than the sovereign grant. The royal family, the Home Office, and the Metropolitan Police decide which members have a right to taxpayer-funded police security. Extended members do not retain automatic right to protection; in 2011, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie ceased receiving police security.

==Residences==

The sovereign&#x27;s official residence in London is Buckingham Palace. Announcements of the births and deaths of members of the royal family are traditionally attached to its front railings. Both Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle, the monarch&#x27;s weekend home in Berkshire, are used to host state visits. The Palace of Holyroodhouse and Hillsborough Castle serve as official royal residences when the monarch is in Scotland or Northern Ireland, respectively.

Clarence House served as the official residence of Charles III from 2003, when he was Prince of Wales, until he ascended to the throne on 8 September 2022. Another London residence of his when Prince of Wales was St James&#x27;s Palace, which he shared with the Princess Royal and Princess Alexandra. Princess Alexandra also resides at Thatched House Lodge in Richmond. The King also privately owns Sandringham House in Norfolk and Balmoral Castle in Aberdeenshire, which are his personal property. He inherited them from Elizabeth II upon her death. 
The Prince and Princess of Wales and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester have their official London residences and offices at apartments in Kensington Palace, London. The former and their children officially moved into Adelaide Cottage in Windsor Home Park in September 2022. The Duke and Duchess of Kent reside in Wren House in the grounds of Kensington Palace. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex&#x27;s official residence in the United Kingdom is Frogmore Cottage, near Windsor. The Duke of York lives at the Royal Lodge in Windsor Great Park, while the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh reside at Bagshot Park in Surrey.

<doc id="46545" wikidata="Q1068715" url="?curid=46545" title="Telecommunications network">
<text>A telecommunications network is a group of nodes interconnected by telecommunications links that are used to exchange messages between the nodes. The links may use a variety of technologies based on the methodologies of circuit switching, message switching, or packet switching, to pass messages and signals. 

Multiple nodes may cooperate to pass the message from an originating node to the destination node, via multiple network hops. For this routing function, each node in the network is assigned a network address for identification and locating it on the network. The collection of addresses in the network is called the address space of the network.

Examples of telecommunications networks include computer networks, the Internet, the public switched telephone network (PSTN), the global Telex network, the aeronautical ACARS network, and the wireless radio networks of cell phone telecommunication providers.

==Network structure==
this is the structure of network general, every telecommunications network conceptually consists of three parts, or planes (so-called because they can be thought of as being and often are, separate overlay networks):
* The data plane (also user plane, bearer plane, or forwarding plane) carries the network&#x27;s users&#x27; traffic, the actual payload.
* The control plane carries control information (also known as signaling).
* The management plane carries the operations, administration and management traffic required for network management. The management plane is sometimes considered a part of the control plane.

== Data networks==

Data networks are used extensively throughout the world for communication between individuals and organizations. Data networks can be connected to allow users seamless access to resources that are hosted outside of the particular provider they are connected to. The Internet is the best example of the internetworking of many data networks from different organizations.

Terminals attached to IP networks like the Internet are addressed using IP addresses. Protocols of the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) provide the control and routing of messages across the and IP data network. There are many different network structures that IP can be used across to efficiently route messages, for example:
* Wide area networks (WAN)
* Metropolitan area networks (MAN)
* Local area networks (LAN)

There are three features that differentiate MANs from LANs or WANs:
# The area of the network size is between LANs and WANs. The MAN will have a physical area between 5 and 50 km in diameter.
# MANs do not generally belong to a single organization. The equipment that interconnects the network, the links, and the MAN itself are often owned by an association or a network provider that provides or leases the service to others.
# A MAN is a means for sharing resources at high speeds within the network. It often provides connections to WAN networks for access to resources outside the scope of the MAN.

Data center networks also rely highly on TCP/IP for communication across machines. They connect thousands of servers, are designed to be highly robust, provide low latency and high bandwidth. Data center network topology plays a significant role in determining the level of failure resiliency, ease of incremental expansion, communication bandwidth and latency.

==Capacity and speed==
In analogy to the improvements in the speed and capacity of digital computers, provided by advances in semiconductor technology and expressed in the bi-yearly doubling of transistor density, which is described empirically by Moore&#x27;s law, the capacity and speed of telecommunications networks have followed similar advances, for similar reasons. In telecommunication, this is expressed in Edholm&#x27;s law, proposed by and named after Phil Edholm in 2004. This empirical law holds that the bandwidth of telecommunication networks doubles every 18 months, which has proven to be true since the 1970s. The trend is evident in the Internet, cellular (mobile), wireless and wired local area networks (LANs), and personal area networks. This development is the consequence of rapid advances in the development of metal-oxide-semiconductor technology.

<doc id="46547" wikidata="Q270740" url="?curid=46547" title="Samuel of Bulgaria">
<text>Samuel (also Samoil or Samuil; , ; , ; Old Church Slavonic: Самоилъ; died 6 October 1014) was the Tsar (&quot;Emperor&quot;) of the First Bulgarian Empire from 997 to 6 October 1014. From 977 to 997, he was a general under Roman I of Bulgaria, the second surviving son of Emperor Peter I of Bulgaria, and co-ruled with him, as Roman bestowed upon him the command of the army and the effective royal authority. As Samuel struggled to preserve his country&#x27;s independence from the Byzantine Empire, his rule was characterized by constant warfare against the Byzantines and their equally ambitious ruler Basil II.

In his early years, Samuel managed to inflict several major defeats on the Byzantines and to launch offensive campaigns into their territory. In the late 10th century, the Bulgarian armies conquered the Serb principality of Duklja and led campaigns against the Kingdoms of Croatia and Hungary. But from 1001, he was forced mainly to defend the Empire against the superior Byzantine armies. Samuel died of a heart attack on 6 October 1014, two months after the catastrophic battle of Kleidion. His successors failed to organize a resistance, and in 1018, four years after Samuel&#x27;s death, the country capitulated, ending the five decades-long Byzantine–Bulgarian conflict.

Samuel was considered &quot;invincible in power and unsurpassable in strength&quot;. Similar comments were made even in Constantinople, where John Kyriotes penned a poem offering a punning comparison between the Bulgarian Emperor and Halley&#x27;s comet, which appeared in 989. During Samuel&#x27;s reign, Bulgaria gained control of most of the Balkans (with the notable exception of Thrace) as far as southern Greece. He moved the capital from Skopje to Ohrid, which had been the cultural and military centre of southwestern Bulgaria since Boris I&#x27;s rule, and made the city the seat of the Bulgarian Patriarchate. Because of this, his realm is sometimes called the &quot;Western Bulgarian Empire&quot;. Samuel&#x27;s energetic reign restored Bulgarian might on the Balkans, even though the Empire was disestablished after his death.

==The rise of the Cometopuli==
===The Cometopuli===

Samuel was the fourth and youngest son of count Nicholas, a Bulgarian noble, who might have been the count of Sredets district (modern-day Sofia), although other sources suggest that he was a regional count of Prespa district in the region of Macedonia. His mother was Rhipsime of Armenia. The actual name of the dynasty is not known. &quot;Cometopuli&quot; is the nickname used by Byzantine historians which is translated as &quot;sons of the count&quot;. The Cometopuli rose to power out of the disorder that occurred in the Bulgarian Empire from 966 to 971.

=== Rus&#x27; invasion and the deposition of Boris II ===
During the reign of Emperor Peter I, Bulgaria prospered in a long-lasting peace with Byzantium. This was secured by the marriage of Peter with the Byzantine princess Maria Lakapina, granddaughter of Byzantine Emperor Romanos I Lekapenos. However, after Maria&#x27;s death in 963, the truce had been shaken and it was at this time or later that Peter I sent his sons Boris and Roman to Constantinople as honorary hostages, to honor the new terms of the peace treaty. During these years the Byzantines and Bulgarians had entangled themselves in a war with Kievan Rus&#x27; Prince Sviatoslav, who invaded Bulgaria several times. After a defeat from Sviatoslav, Peter I suffered a stroke and abdicated his throne in 969 (he died the next year). Boris was allowed back to Bulgaria to take his father&#x27;s throne, restore order and oppose Sviatoslav, but had little success. This was allegedly used by Nicholas and his sons, who were contemplating a revolt in 969.

The Rus&#x27; invaded Byzantine Thrace in 970, but suffered a defeat in the Battle of Arcadiopolis. The new Byzantine Emperor John Tzimiskes used this to his advantage. He quickly invaded Bulgaria the following year, defeated the Rus, and conquered the Bulgarian capital Preslav. Boris II of Bulgaria was ritually divested of his imperial insignia in a public ceremony in Constantinople and he and his brother Roman of Bulgaria remained in captivity. Although the ceremony in 971 had been intended as a symbolic termination of the Bulgarian Empire, the Byzantines were unable to assert their control over the western provinces of Bulgaria. Count Nicholas, Samuel&#x27;s father, who had close ties to the royal court in Preslav, died in 970. In the same year &quot;the sons of the count&quot; (the Cometopuli) David, Moses, Aaron and Samuel rebelled. The series of events are not clear due to contradicting sources, but it is sure that after 971 Samuel and his brothers were the &quot;de facto&quot; rulers of the western Bulgarian lands.

In 973, the Cometopuli (described by Thietmar of Merseburg simply as &quot;the Bulgarians&quot;) sent envoys to the Holy Roman Emperor Otto I in Quedlinburg in an attempt to secure the protection of their lands. The brothers ruled together in a tetrarchy. David ruled the southernmost regions and led the defense of one of the most dangerous border areas, around Thessaloniki and Thessaly. The centres of his possessions were Prespa and Kastoria. Moses ruled from Strumitsa, which would be an outpost for attacks on the Aegean coast and Serres. Aaron ruled from Sredets, and was to defend the main road from Adrianople to Belgrade, and to attack Thrace. Samuel ruled northwestern Bulgaria from the strong fortress of Vidin. He was also to organize the liberation of the conquered areas to the east, including the old capital Preslav. Some records suggest that David played a major role in this tumultuous period of Bulgarian history.

=== War with Byzantium ===

After John I Tzimiskes died on 11 January 976, the Cometopuli launched an assault along the whole border. Within a few weeks, however, David was killed by Vlach vagrants and Moses was fatally injured by a stone during the siege of Serres. The brothers&#x27; actions to the south detained many Byzantine troops and eased Samuel&#x27;s liberation of northeastern Bulgaria. A local Bulgarian uprising broke there, led by two boyars – Petar and Boyan, who became allies of the Cometopuli and submitted to their rule. The Byzantine army was defeated and retreated to Crimea. Any Bulgarian nobles and officials who had not opposed the Byzantine conquest of the region were executed, and the war continued north of the Danube until the enemy was scattered and Bulgarian rule was restored.

After suffering these defeats in the Balkans, the Byzantine Empire descended into civil war. The commander of the Asian army, Bardas Scleros, rebelled in Asia Minor and sent troops under his son Romanus in Thrace to besiege Constantinople. The new Emperor Basil II did not have enough manpower to fight both the Bulgarians and the rebels and resorted to treason, conspiracy and complicated diplomatic plots. Basil II made many promises to the Bulgarians and Scleros to divert them from allying against him. Aaron, the eldest living Cometopulus, was tempted by an alliance with the Byzantines and the opportunity to seize power in Bulgaria for himself. He held land in Thrace, a region potentially subject to the Byzantine threat. Basil reached an agreement with Aaron, who asked to marry Basil&#x27;s sister to seal it. Basil instead sent the wife of one of his officials with the bishop of Sebaste. However, the deceit was uncovered and the bishop was killed. Nonetheless, negotiations proceeded and concluded in a peace agreement. The historian Scylitzes wrote that Aaron wanted sole power and &quot;sympathized with the Romans&quot;. Samuel learned of the conspiracy and the clash between the two brothers was inevitable. The quarrel broke out in the vicinity of Dupnitsa on 14 June 976 and ended with the annihilation of Aaron&#x27;s family. Only his son, Ivan Vladislav, survived because Samuel&#x27;s son Gavril Radomir pleaded on his behalf. From that moment on, practically all power and authority in the state were held by Samuel and the danger of an internal conflict was eliminated.

However, another theory suggests that Aaron participated in the battle of the Gates of Trajan which took place ten years later. According to that theory Aaron was killed on 14 June 987 or 988.

==Co-rule with Roman==

After the Byzantine plan to use Aaron to cause instability in Bulgaria failed, they tried to encourage the rightful heirs to the throne, Boris II and Roman, to oppose Samuel. Basil II hoped that they would win the support of the nobles and isolate Samuel or perhaps even start a Bulgarian civil war. Boris and Roman were sent back in 977 but while they were passing through a forest near the border, Boris was killed by Bulgarian guards who were misled by his Byzantine clothing. Roman, who was walking some distance behind, managed to identify himself to the guards.

Roman was taken to Vidin, where he was proclaimed Emperor of Bulgaria. Samuel became his first lieutenant and general and together they gathered an army and fought the Byzantines. During his captivity, Roman had been castrated on the orders of John I Tzimiskes so that he would not have heirs. Thus Samuel was certain to eventually succeed Roman. The new emperor entrusted Samuel with the state administration and became occupied with church and religious affairs.
As the main effort of Basil II was concentrated against the rebel Skleros, Samuel&#x27;s armies attacked the European possessions of the Byzantine Empire. Samuel invaded not only Thrace and the area of Thessaloniki, but also Thessaly, Hellas and the Peloponnese. Many Byzantine fortresses fell to the Bulgarians. Samuel wanted to seize the important fortress of Larissa, which controlled the key routes in Thessaly, and from 977 to 983 the town was blockaded. After starvation forced the Byzantines to surrender, the population was deported to the interior of Bulgaria and the males were forced to enlist in the Bulgarian army. Although Basil II sent forces to the region, they were defeated. With this victory, Bulgaria had gained influence over most of the southwestern Balkans, although it did not occupy some of these territories. From Larissa, Samuel took the relics of Saint Achilleios, which were laid in a specially built church of the same name on an island in Lake Prespa.

The Bulgarian successes in the west raised fears in Constantinople, and after serious preparations, Basil II launched a campaign into the very centre of the Bulgarian Empire to distract Samuel from southern Greece. The Byzantine army passed through the mountains around Ihtiman and besieged Sredets in 986. The Byzantines assaulted the city for 20 days, but their attacks proved fruitless and costly: the Bulgarians came out of the city several times, killed many enemy soldiers and captured draught animals and horses. Eventually, the Bulgarian troops burned the siege equipment of the Byzantine army, forcing Basil II to withdraw to Thrace, but on 17 August 986, while passing through the mountains, the Byzantine army was ambushed and routed at the Trajan&#x27;s Gates Pass. This was a significant blow for Basil, who was one of the few to return to Constantinople; his personal treasure was captured by the victors.

After the defeat, the rebellion of Bardas Phocas diverted the efforts of the Byzantine Empire into another civil war. Samuel seized the opportunity and began to exert pressure on Thessaloniki. Basil II sent a large army to the town and appointed a new governor, Gregorios Taronites, but he was powerless to stop the Bulgarian advance. By 989, the Bulgarian troops had penetrated deep into Byzantine territory, and seized many fortresses, including such important cities as Veria and Servia. In the south, the Bulgarians marched throughout Epirus and in the west they seized the area of modern Durrës (medieval Dyrrhachium or Drach) on the Adriatic Sea.

In 989, Phocas was killed and his followers surrendered, and the following year Basil II reached an agreement with Skleros. The Byzantines focused their attention on Bulgaria, and counter-attacked in 991. The Bulgarian army was defeated and Roman was captured while Samuel managed to escape. The Byzantines conquered some areas; in 995, however, the Arabs invaded Asia Minor and Basil II was forced to move many of his troops to combat this new threat. Samuel quickly regained the lost lands and advanced south. In 996, he defeated the Byzantines in the battle of Thessaloniki. During the battle, Thessaloniki&#x27;s governor, Gregorios, perished and his son Ashot was captured. Elated by this success, the Bulgarians continued south. They marched through Thessaly, overcame the defensive wall at Thermopylae and entered the Peloponnese, devastating everything on their way.
As a response, a Byzantine army under Nikephorus Uranos was sent after the Bulgarians, who returned north to meet it. The two armies met near the flooded river of Spercheios. The Byzantines found a place to ford, and on the night of 19 July 996 they surprised the unprepared Bulgarian army and routed it in the battle of Spercheios. Samuel&#x27;s arm was wounded and he barely escaped captivity; he and his son allegedly feigned death. After nightfall they headed for Bulgaria and walked home. Research of Samuel&#x27;s grave suggests that the bone in his arm healed at an angle of 140° but remained crippled.

==Emperor==
In 997, Roman died in captivity in Constantinople, ending the line of rulers started by Krum. Because of the war with Byzantium, it was dangerous to leave the throne vacant for long, and Samuel was chosen as the new Emperor of Bulgaria because he had the closest relations to the deceased emperor and was Roman&#x27;s long-standing military commander. The presbyter of Duklja also marked the event: &quot;By that time among the Bulgarian people rose one Samuel, who proclaimed himself emperor. He led a long war against the Byzantines and expelled them from the whole territory of Bulgaria, so that the Byzantines did not dare to approach it&quot;.

Constantinople would not recognize the new emperor, as for the Byzantines Boris II&#x27;s abdication symbolized the official end of Bulgaria and Samuel was considered a mere rebel. Instead Samuel sought recognition from the Pope, which would be a serious blow to the position of the Byzantines in the Balkans and would weaken the influence of the Patriarch of Constantinople, thereby benefiting both the See of Rome and Bulgaria. Samuel possibly received his imperial crown from Pope Gregory V.

===War against Serbs and Croats===
In 998, Samuel launched a major campaign against the Duklja to prevent an alliance between Prince Jovan Vladimir and the Byzantines. When the Bulgarian troops reached Duklja, the Serbian prince and his people withdrew to the mountains. Samuel left part of the army at the foot of the mountains and led the remaining soldiers to besiege the coastal fortress of Ulcinj. In an effort to prevent bloodshed, he asked Jovan Vladimir to surrender. After the prince refused, some Serb nobles offered their services to the Bulgarians and, when it became clear that further resistance was fruitless, the Serbs surrendered. Jovan Vladimir was exiled to Samuel&#x27;s palaces in Prespa.
The Bulgarian troops proceeded to pass through Dalmatia, taking control of Kotor and journeying to Dubrovnik. Although they failed to take Dubrovnik, they devastated the surrounding villages. The Bulgarian army then attacked Croatia in support of the rebel princes Krešimir III and Gojslav and advanced northwest as far as Split, Trogir and Zadar, then northeast through Bosnia and Raška and returned to Bulgaria. This Croato-Bulgarian War allowed Samuel to install vassal monarchs in Croatia.

Samuel&#x27;s relative Theodora Kosara fell in love with the captive Jovan Vladimir. The couple married after gaining Samuel&#x27;s approval, and Jovan returned to his lands as a Bulgarian official along with his uncle Dragomir, whom Samuel trusted. Meanwhile, Princess Miroslava fell in love with the Byzantine noble captive Ashot, son of Gregorios Taronites, the dead governor of Thessaloniki, and threatened to commit suicide if she was not allowed to marry him. Samuel conceded and appointed Ashot governor of Dyrrhachium. Samuel also sealed an alliance with the Magyars when his eldest son and heir, Gavril Radomir, married the daughter of the Hungarian Grand Prince Géza.

===Advance of the Byzantines===
The beginning of the new millennium saw a turn in the course of Byzantine-Bulgarian warfare. Basil II had amassed an army larger and stronger than that of the Bulgarians: determined to definitively conquer Bulgaria, he moved much of the battle-seasoned military forces from the eastern campaigns against the Arabs to the Balkans and Samuel was forced to defend rather than attack.

In 1001, Basil II sent a large army under the patrician Theodorokanos and Nikephoros Xiphias to the north of the Balkan Mountains to seize the main Bulgarian fortresses in the area. The Byzantine troops recaptured Preslav and Pliska, putting north-eastern Bulgaria once again under Byzantine rule. The following year, they struck in the opposite direction, marching through Thessaloniki to tear off Thessaly and the southernmost parts of the Bulgarian Empire. Although the Bulgarian commander of the fortress of Veroia, Dobromir, was married to one of Samuel&#x27;s nieces, he voluntarily surrendered the fort and joined the Byzantines. The Byzantines also captured the fortress of Kolidron without a fight, but its commander Dimitar Tihon managed to retreat with his soldiers and join Samuel. The next town, Servia, did not fall so easily; its governor Nikulitsa organized the defenders well. They fought until the Byzantines penetrated the walls and forced them to surrender. Nikulitsa was taken to Constantinople and given the high court title of patrician, but he soon escaped and rejoined the Bulgarians. He attempted to retake Servia, but the siege was unsuccessful and he was captured again and imprisoned.

Meanwhile, Basil II&#x27;s campaign reconquered many towns in Thessaly. He forced the Bulgarian population of the conquered areas to resettle in the Voleron area between the Mesta and Maritsa rivers. Edessa resisted for weeks but was conquered following a long siege. The population was moved to Voleron and its governor Dragshan was taken to Thessaloniki, where he was betrothed to the daughter of a local noble. Unwilling to be married to an enemy, Dragshan three times tried to flee to Bulgaria and was eventually executed.

===War with Hungary===

The Byzantine–Bulgarian conflict reached its apex in 1003, when Hungary became involved. Since the beginning of the 9th century, the Bulgarian territory had stretched beyond the Carpathian Mountains as far as the Tisza River and the middle Danube. During the reign of Samuel, the governor of these northwestern parts was duke Ahtum, the grandson of duke Glad, who had been defeated by the Hungarians in the 930s. Ahtum commanded a strong army and firmly defended the northwestern borders of the Empire. He also built many churches and monasteries through which he spread Christianity in Transylvania.

Although Gavril Radomir&#x27;s marriage to the daughter of the Hungarian ruler had established friendly relations between the two strongest states of the Danube area, the relationship deteriorated after Géza&#x27;s death. The Bulgarians supported Gyula and Koppány as rulers instead of Géza&#x27;s son Stephen I. As a result of this conflict, the marriage between Gavril Radomir and the Hungarian princess was dissolved. The Hungarians then attacked Ahtum, who had directly backed the pretenders for the Hungarian crown. Stephen I convinced Hanadin, Ahtum&#x27;s right-hand man, to help in the attack. When the conspiracy was uncovered Hanadin fled and joined the Hungarian forces. At the same time, a strong Byzantine army besieged Vidin, Ahtum&#x27;s seat. Although many soldiers were required to participate in the defense of the town, Ahtum was occupied with the war to the north. After several months he died in battle when his troops were defeated by the Hungarians. As a result of the war, Bulgarian influence to the northwest of the Danube diminished.

===Further Byzantine successes===

The Byzantines took advantage of the Bulgarian troubles in the north. In 1003, Basil II led a large army to Vidin, northwestern Bulgaria&#x27;s most important town. After an eight-month siege, the Byzantines ultimately captured the fortress, allegedly due to betrayal by the local bishop. The commanders of the town had repulsed all previous attempts to break their defence, including the use of Greek fire. While Basil&#x27;s forces were engaged there, Samuel struck in the opposite direction: on 15 August he attacked Adrianople and plundered the area.

Basil II decided to return to Constantinople afterwards, but, fearing an encounter with the Bulgarian army on the main road to his capital, he used an alternate route. The Byzantines marched south through the Morava valley and reached a key Bulgarian city, Skopje, in 1004. The Bulgarian army was camping on the opposite side of the Vardar River. After finding a ford and crossing the river, Basil II attacked and defeated Samuel&#x27;s unsuspecting army, using the same tactics employed at Spercheios. The Byzantines continued east and besieged the fortress of Pernik. Its governor, Krakra, was not seduced by Basil&#x27;s promises of a noble title and wealth, and successfully defended the fortress. The Byzantines withdrew to Thrace after suffering heavy losses.

In the same year, Samuel undertook a march against Thessaloniki. His men ambushed and captured its governor, Ioannes Chaldus, but this success could not compensate for the losses the Bulgarians had suffered in the past four years. The setbacks in the war demoralized some of Samuel&#x27;s military commanders, especially the captured Byzantine nobles. Samuel&#x27;s son-in-law Ashot, the governor of Dyrrhachium, made contact with the local Byzantines and the influential John Chryselios, Samuel&#x27;s father-in-law. Ashot and his wife boarded one of the Byzantine ships that were beleaguering the town and fled to Constantinople. Meanwhile, Chryselios surrendered the city to the Byzantine commander Eustathios Daphnomeles in 1005, securing the title of patrician for his sons.

In 1006–1007, Basil II penetrated deep into the Bulgarian-ruled lands and in 1009 Samuel&#x27;s forces were defeated at Kreta, east of Thessaloniki. During the next years, Basil launched annual campaigns into Bulgarian territory, devastating everything on his way. Although there was still no decisive battle, it was clear that the end of the Bulgarian resistance was drawing nearer; the evidence was the fierceness of the military engagements and the constant campaigns of both sides which devastated the Bulgarian and Byzantine realms.

===Disaster at Kleidion===


In 1014, Samuel resolved to stop Basil before he could invade Bulgarian territory. Since the Byzantines usually used the valley of the Strumitsa River for their invasions into Bulgaria, Samuel built a thick wooden wall in the gorges around the village of Klyuch (also &quot;Kleidion&quot;, &quot;key&quot;) to bar the enemy&#x27;s way.

When Basil II launched his next campaign in the summer of 1014, his army suffered heavy casualties during the assaults on the wall. Meanwhile, Samuel sent forces under his general Nestoritsa to attack Thessaloniki so as to distract Basil&#x27;s forces away from this campaign. Nestoritsa was defeated near the city by its governor Botaniates, who later joined the main Byzantine army near Klyuch. After several days of continuous attempts to break through the wall, one Byzantine commander, the governor of Plovdiv Nicephorus Xiphias, found a by-pass and, on 29 July, attacked the Bulgarians from the rear. Despite the desperate resistance the Byzantines overwhelmed the Bulgarian army and captured around 14,000 soldiers, according to some sources even 15,000. Basil II immediately sent forces under his favourite commander Theophylactus Botaniates to pursue the surviving Bulgarians, but the Byzantines were defeated in an ambush by Gavril Radomir, who personally killed Botaniates.
After the Battle of Kleidion, on the order of Basil II the captured Bulgarian soldiers were blinded; one of every 100 men was left one-eyed so as to lead the rest home. The blinded soldiers were sent back to Samuel who reportedly had a heart attack upon seeing them. He died two days later, on 6 October 1014. This savagery gave the Byzantine Emperor his byname &quot;Boulgaroktonos&quot; (&quot;Bulgar-slayer&quot; in ). Some historians theorize it was the death of his favourite commander that infuriated Basil II to blind the captured soldiers.
The battle of Kleidion had major political consequences. Although Samuel&#x27;s son and successor, Gavril Radomir, was a talented military leader, he was murdered by his cousin Ivan Vladislav, who, ironically, owed his life to him. Unable to restore the Bulgarian Empire&#x27;s previous power, Ivan Vladislav himself was killed while attacking Dyrrhachium. After that, the widowed empress Maria and many Bulgarian governors, including Krakra, surrendered to the Byzantines. Presian, Ivan Vladislav&#x27;s eldest son, fled with two of his brothers to Mount Tomorr, before they too surrendered. Thus the First Bulgarian Empire came to an end in 1018, only four years after Samuel&#x27;s death. Most of its territory was incorporated within the new Theme of Bulgaria, with Skopje as its capital.

In the extreme northwest, the duke of Syrmia, Sermon, was the last remnant of the once mighty Empire. He was deceived and killed by the Byzantines in 1019.

==Family, grave and legacy==
Samuel&#x27;s wife was called Agatha, and was the daughter of the magnate of Dyrrhachium John Chryselios. Only two of Samuel&#x27;s and Agatha&#x27;s children are definitely known by name: Samuel&#x27;s heir Gavril Radomir and Miroslava. Two further, unnamed daughters, are mentioned after the Bulgarian surrender in 1018, while Samuel is also recorded as having had a bastard son. Another woman, Theodora Kosara, who was wedded to Jovan Vladimir of Duklja and was considered by earlier scholarship as Samuel&#x27;s daughter, is now regarded to have been simply a relative, perhaps a niece of Agatha. Gavril Radomir married twice, to Ilona of Hungary and Irene from Larissa. Miroslava married the captured Byzantine noble Ashot Taronites.

After the fall of Bulgaria, Samuel&#x27;s descendants assumed important positions in the Byzantine court after they were resettled and given lands in Asia Minor and Armenia. One of his granddaughters, Catherine, became empress of Byzantium. Another (supposed) grandchild, Peter II Delyan, led an attempt to restore the Bulgarian Empire after a major uprising in 10401041. Two other women of the dynasty became Byzantine empresses, while many nobles served in the army as strategos or became governors of various provinces.




There is another version of Samuel&#x27;s origin: the 11th-century historian Stepanos Asoghik wrote that Samuel had only one brother, stating they were both Armenians from the district of Derjan, an Armenian land incorporated into the Byzantine Empire. They were sent to fight the Bulgarians in Macedonia but ended up joining them. This version is supported by the historian Nicholas Adontz, who analyzed the events and facts of the century and concluded that Samuel had only one brother, David. Asoghik&#x27;s version is also supported by the historian Jordan Ivanov; furthermore, only one brother is mentioned on Samuel&#x27;s Inscription.

The Arab historian Yahya of Antioch claims that the son of Samuel, Gavril, was assassinated by the leader of the Bulgarians, son of Aaron, because Aaron belonged to the race that reigned over Bulgaria. Asoghik and Yahya clearly distinguish the race of Samuel from the one of Aaron or the race of the Cometopuli from the royal race. According to them, Moses and Aaron are not from the family of the Cometopuli. David and Samuel were of Armenian origin and Moses and Aaron were Armenian on their mother&#x27;s side.

Samuel&#x27;s grave was found in 1965 by Greek professor Nikolaos Moutsopoulos in the Church of St Achillios on the eponymous island in Lake Prespa. Samuel had built the church for the relics of the saint of the same name. What is thought to have been the coat of arms of the House of Cometopuli, two perched parrots, was embroidered on his funeral garment.

His remains are kept in the Museum of Byzantine Culture in Thessaloniki, but according to a recent agreement, they may be returned to Bulgaria and buried in the SS. Forty Martyrs Church in Veliko Tarnovo, to rest with the remains of Emperors Kaloyan and Michael Shishman.

Samuel&#x27;s face was reconstructed to restore the appearance of the 70-year-old Bulgarian ruler. According to the reconstruction, he was a sharp-faced man, bald-headed, with a white beard and moustache.

Samuel is among the most renowned Bulgarian rulers. His military struggle with the Byzantine Empire is marked as an epic period of Bulgarian history. The great number of monuments and memorials in Bulgaria and the Republic of Macedonia, such as the ones in Petrich and Ohrid, signify the trail this historical figure has left in the memory of the people. Four Bulgarian villages bear his name, as well as Samuel Point on Livingston Island, Antarctica. Samuel is the main figure in at least three major Bulgarian novels by authors Dimitar Talev, Anton Donchev and Stefan Tsanev and also stars in the Greek novel &quot;At the Times of the Bulgarian-Slayer&quot; by Penelope Delta, who closely follows the narrative flow of events as presented by St. Runciman. He is mentioned in the verse of Ivan Vazov, Pencho Slaveykov, and Atanas Dalchev as well.

==Nomenclature==
=== Overview ===

Samuel&#x27;s empire had its heartlands in the modern region of Macedonia, west and southwest of the city of Ohrid, this earlier cultural center of the First Bulgarian Empire. After the area was taken in 1913 after five centuries Ottoman rule by the Kingdom of Serbia, (later Yugoslavia), this led to assertions by the nationalist-driven historiography there. Its main agenda was that Samuel&#x27;s empire was a &quot;Serbian&quot;/&quot;Macedonian Slavic&quot; state, distinct from the Bulgarian Empire. In more recent times the same agenda has been maintained in the Republic of North Macedonia.

Practically Serbia did not exist at that time. It became independent under Časlav ca. 930, only to fall ca. 960 under Byzantine and later under Bulgarian rule. In fact, that area was taken for the first time by Serbia centuries later, during the 1280s. Moreover, in Samuel&#x27;s time, Macedonia as a geographical term referred to part of the region of modern Thrace. The &quot;Macedonian&quot; emperors of that period were Basil II, called &quot;Bulgar-Slayer&quot;, and his Byzantine relatives from the Macedonian dynasty, originating from the territory of today&#x27;s European Turkey. Most of the modern region of Macedonia was then a Bulgarian province known as Kutmichevitsa. The area was incorporated into the Byzantine Empire in 1018 as a new province called Bulgaria.

The very name of &quot;Macedonia&quot; for the modern region was revived only in the 19th century, after it had nearly disappeared during the five centuries of Ottoman rule. Until the early 20th century and beyond the majority of the Macedonian Slavs who had clear ethnic consciousness believed they were Bulgarians. The Balkan Wars (1912–1913) and World War I (1914–1918) left the area divided mainly between Greece and Serbia (later Yugoslavia), which resulted in significant changes in its ethnic composition. The formerly leading Bulgarian community was reduced either by population exchanges or by change of communities&#x27; ethnic identity. The Macedonian Slavs were faced with the policy of forced Serbianisation.

=== Yugoslav agenda ===
20th-century Serbian and afterwards the Yugoslav historiography used the location of Samuel&#x27;s state mainly on the territory of then Yugoslavia, to reject Bulgarian claims on the region. Thus, the Russian-born Yugoslavian historian George Ostrogorsky distinguished Samuel&#x27;s Empire from the Bulgarian Empire, referring to it as a &quot;Macedonian Empire&quot;, although he recognised that Samuel&#x27;s state was politically and ecclesiastically a direct descendant of the empire of Simeon I of Bulgaria and Peter I of Bulgaria, and it was regarded by Samuel and the Byzantines as being the Bulgarian Empire itself.

Some historians of the same school, such as the Serbian scholar Dragutin Anastasijević, even claimed that Samuel ruled a separate South Slavic, i.e. Serbian Empire in Macedonia, founded as result of an anti-Bulgarian rebellion. The Serbs tried to popularize the &quot;Serbian past&quot; of that &quot;distinct state&quot; and its &quot;Serbian rulers&quot;. The story continued in Communist Yugoslavia, where a separate Macedonian identity was formed and Samuel was depicted as a &quot;Macedonian Tsar&quot;. After the breakup of Yugoslavia, these outdated theories have been rejected by authoritative Serbian historians from SANU as Srđan Pirivatrić and Tibor Živković. Pirivatrić has stated, that incipient Bulgarian identity was available in Samuel&#x27;s state, and it will rеmain in the area in the next centuries.

=== North Macedonia&#x27;s view ===
These fringe theories are still held mainly in North Macedonia, where the official state doctrine refers to an &quot;Ethnic Macedonian&quot; Empire, with Samuel being the first Tsar of the Macedonian Slavs. However, this controversy is ahistorical, as it projects modern ethnic distinctions onto the past. There is no historical support for that assertion. Samuel and his successors were never called by their contemporaries &quot;Macedonians&quot;, but simply &quot;Bulgarians&quot; and rarely &quot;Misians&quot;. The last designation arose because then Bulgaria occupied traditionally the lands of the former Roman province of Moesia. 

Macedonian historians insist also that the emperor Basil II designated the enemies coming from the Samuel’s Empire as “Scythians” in his epitaph and that the designation “Bulgaria” was used for &quot;ideological propaganda&quot;. This was newly introduced administrative term, by which the emperor ideologically framed the newly acquired territories of the former Bulgarian empire and the former Samuel’s State. In this way the term &quot;Bulgarian&quot; became a projected name for the Samuel’s State itself. However, the term “Scythians” normally referred to the &quot;Bulgarians&quot;, moreover, Samuel and his successors considered their state Bulgarian.

Nevertheless, on a meeting in Sofia in June 2017, Prime Ministers Boyko Borisov and Zoran Zaev laid flowers at the monument of Tsar Samuil together, articulating optimism that the two countries can finally resolve their open issues by signing a long-delayed agreement on good-neighborly relations. The governments of Bulgaria and North Macedonia signed the friendship treaty in the same year, which was ratified by the two Parliaments in 2018. On its ground, a bilateral expert committee on historical issues was formed. In February 2019, at a meeting of the committee, involving Bulgarian and Macedonian scientists, the two sides agreed to propose to their governments that Tsar Samuel may be celebrated jointly. The Macedonian side also conceded, that he was Tsar of Bulgaria. Nevertheless in December 2020 North Macedonia&#x27;s part from the joint committee withdrew from this decision. According to its view, Tsar Samuel had to be portrayed in one way in North Macedonia&#x27;s textbooks, and in another during joint commemorations. 

In August 2022, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of North Macedonia published official recommendations of the Joint Historical Commission operating between the two countries. There, the governments in Sofia and Skopje are offered a joint commemoration of Samuel, who, according to the commission, was the ruler of a large medieval state, which the majority of modern historical scholarship considers to be the Bulgarian empire itself, centered in the territory of today&#x27;s North Macedonia. In this way the Macedonian members of the Commission not only agreed to identify Samuel&#x27;s state as Bulgarian, but they also recognized the existence of the Bulgarian ethnicity during the Middle Ages. Despite these facts multiple examples of animosity between Bulgaria and North Macedonia have been registered, due to disputes over Samuil&#x27;s ethnic affiliation and this issue is still highly sensitive.

<doc id="46554" wikidata="Q904018" url="?curid=46554" title="Frumenty">
<text>Frumenty (sometimes &quot;frumentee&quot;, &quot;furmity&quot;, &quot;fromity&quot;, or &quot;fermenty&quot;) was a popular dish in Western European medieval cuisine. It is a porridge, a thick boiled grain dish—hence its name, which derives from the Latin word &quot;frumentum&quot;, &quot;grain&quot;. It was usually made with cracked wheat boiled with either milk or broth and was a peasant staple. More luxurious recipes include eggs, almonds, currants, sugar, saffron and orange flower water. Frumenty was served with meat as a pottage, traditionally with venison or even porpoise (considered a &quot;fish&quot; and therefore appropriate for Lent). It was also frequently used as a subtlety, a dish between courses at a banquet.

==In England==
===History===
Florence White, founder of the English Folk Cookery Association, wrote in &quot;Good Things in England&quot; (1932) that frumenty is England&#x27;s &quot;oldest national dish&quot;. For several centuries, frumenty was part of the traditional Celtic Christmas meal. According to an 1822 &quot;Time&#x27;s Telescope&quot;, in Yorkshire, on Christmas Eve:
It was often eaten on Mothering Sunday, the fourth Sunday of Lent, in late spring. On that day many servants were allowed to visit their mothers and were often served frumenty to celebrate and give them a wholesome meal to prepare them for their return journey. The use of eggs would have been a brief respite from the Lenten fast. In Lincolnshire, frumenty was associated with sheep-shearing in June. A diarist recalled of his youth in the 1820s that &quot;almost every farmer in the village made a large quantity of frumenty on the morning they began to clip; and every child in the village was invited to partake of it&quot;. A second batch, of better quality, was produced later and taken round in buckets to every house in the village.

Food historian Polly Russell describes one of the first English recipes for it in the 1390 manuscript &quot;The Forme of Cury&quot;, and how this served as the inspiration for the 2013 Christmas menu at Dinner by Heston Blumenthal, transforming Victorian workhouse food for paupers into modern luxurious dining.

===Literary references===
&quot;Frumentee&quot; is served with venison at a banquet in the mid-14th century North Midlands poem &quot;Wynnere and Wastoure&quot;: &quot;Venyson with the frumentee, and fesanttes full riche / Baken mete therby one the burde sett&quot;, i.e. in modern English, &quot;Venison with the frumenty and pheasants full rich; baked meat by it on the table set&quot;. The dish also appears, likewise paired with venison, at the New Year feast in the Middle English poem known as &quot;The Alliterative Morte Arthure&quot; (c. 1400): &quot;Flesh flourisht of fermison, with frumentee noble.&quot;

The dish, described as &#x27;furmity&#x27; and served with fruit and a slug of rum added under the counter, plays a role in the plot of Thomas Hardy&#x27;s novel &quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge&quot;. It is also mentioned in Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot; as a food that snapdragon flies live on. Snapdragon was a popular game at Christmas, and Carroll&#x27;s mention of frumenty shows it was known to him as a holiday food. It also appears in a girl&#x27;s recitation of holiday traditions, in &quot;My Lady Ludlow&quot;, published 1858, by Elizabeth Gaskell: &quot;furmenty on Mothering Sunday, Violet cakes in Passion Week&quot; (Chapter 2).

===Recipes===
Steve Roud, librarian and folklorist, compiled a compendium of &quot;The English Year&quot; including three recipes for frumenty. They show considerable variation with place and time.

A healthy dose of spirit is often mentioned as accompanying the frumenty.

==Elsewhere==
A dish made with boiled cracked wheat and soured milk was made in Ancient Persia, and is still used, often as the basis for a soup, in Greece and Cyprus (as &quot;trahanas&quot;), and in Turkey (&quot;tarhana&quot;). &quot;Kutia&quot; is an Eastern European dish with a similar recipe.

<doc id="46565" wikidata="Q1151098" url="?curid=46565" title="L-system">
<text>An L-system or Lindenmayer system is a rewriting system and a type of formal grammar. An L-system consists of an alphabet of symbols that can be used to make strings, a collection of production rules that expand each symbol into some larger string of symbols, an initial &quot;axiom&quot; string from which to begin construction, and a mechanism for translating the generated strings into geometric structures. L-systems were introduced and developed in 1968 by Aristid Lindenmayer, a Hungarian theoretical biologist and botanist at the University of Utrecht. Lindenmayer used L-systems to describe the behaviour of plant cells and to model the growth processes of plant development. L-systems have also been used to model the morphology of a variety of organisms and can be used to generate self-similar fractals.

==Origins==

As a biologist, Lindenmayer worked with yeast and filamentous fungi and studied the growth patterns of various types of bacteria, such as the cyanobacteria &quot;Anabaena catenula&quot;. Originally, the L-systems were devised to provide a formal description of the development of such simple multicellular organisms, and to illustrate the neighbourhood relationships between plant cells. Later on, this system was extended to describe higher plants and complex branching structures.

==L-system structure==
The recursive nature of the L-system rules leads to self-similarity and thereby, fractal-like forms are easy to describe with an L-system. Plant models and natural-looking organic forms are easy to define, as by increasing the recursion level the form slowly &#x27;grows&#x27; and becomes more complex. Lindenmayer systems are also popular in the generation of artificial life.

L-system grammars are very similar to the semi-Thue grammar (see Chomsky hierarchy). L-systems are now commonly known as &quot;parametric&quot; L systems, defined as a tuple

:G = (&quot;V&quot;, ω, &quot;P&quot;),

where

* V (the &quot;alphabet&quot;) is a set of symbols containing both elements that can be replaced (&quot;variables&quot;) and those which cannot be replaced (&quot;constants&quot; or &quot;terminals&quot;)
* ω (&quot;start&quot;, &quot;axiom&quot; or &quot;initiator&quot;) is a string of symbols from V defining the initial state of the system
* P is a set of &quot;production rules&quot; or &quot;productions&quot; defining the way variables can be replaced with combinations of constants and other variables. A production consists of two strings, the &quot;predecessor&quot; and the &quot;successor&quot;. For any symbol A which is a member of the set V which does not appear on the left hand side of a production in P, the identity production A → A is assumed; these symbols are called &quot;constants&quot; or &quot;terminals&quot;. (See Law of identity).

The rules of the L-system grammar are applied iteratively starting from the initial state. As many rules as possible are applied simultaneously, per iteration. The fact that each iteration employs as many rules as possible differentiates an L-system from a formal language generated by a formal grammar, which applies only one rule per iteration. If the production rules were to be applied only one at a time, one would quite simply generate a string in a language, and all such sequences of applications would produce the language specified by the grammar. There are some strings in some languages, however, that cannot be generated if the grammar is treated as an L-system rather than a language specification. For example, suppose there is a rule S→SS in a grammar. If productions are done one at a time, then starting from S, we can get first SS, and then, applying the rule again, SSS. However, if all applicable rules are applied at every step, as in an L-system, then we cannot get this sentential form. Instead, the first step would give us SS, but the second would apply the rule twice, giving us SSSS. Thus, the set of strings produced by an L-systems from a given grammar is a subset of the formal language defined by the grammar, and if we take a language to be defined as a set of strings, this means that a given L-system is effectively a subset of the formal language defined by the L-system&#x27;s grammar.

An L-system is &quot;context-free&quot; if each production rule refers only to an individual symbol and not to its neighbours. Context-free L-systems are thus specified by a context-free grammar. If a rule depends not only on a single symbol but also on its neighbours, it is termed a &quot;context-sensitive&quot; L-system.

If there is exactly one production for each symbol, then the L-system is said to be &quot;deterministic&quot; (a deterministic context-free L-system is popularly called a &quot;D0L system&quot;). If there are several, and each is chosen with a certain probability during each iteration, then it is a &quot;stochastic&quot; L-system.

Using L-systems for generating graphical images requires that the symbols in the model refer to elements of a drawing on the computer screen. For example, the program &quot;Fractint&quot; uses turtle graphics (similar to those in the Logo programming language) to produce screen images. It interprets each constant in an L-system model as a turtle command.

==Examples of L-systems==

===Example 1: algae===
Lindenmayer&#x27;s original L-system for modelling the growth of algae.

:variables : A B
:constants : none
:axiom : A
:rules : (A → AB), (B → A)

which produces:

: &quot;n&quot; = 0 : A
: &quot;n&quot; = 1 : AB
: &quot;n&quot; = 2 : ABA
: &quot;n&quot; = 3 : ABAAB
: &quot;n&quot; = 4 : ABAABABA
: &quot;n&quot; = 5 : ABAABABAABAAB
: &quot;n&quot; = 6 : ABAABABAABAABABAABABA
: &quot;n&quot; = 7 : ABAABABAABAABABAABABAABAABABAABAAB

==== Example 1: algae, explained ====
 n=0: A start (axiom/initiator)
 n=1: A B the initial single A spawned into AB by rule (A → AB), rule (B → A) couldn&#x27;t be applied
 n=2: A B A former string AB with all rules applied, A spawned into AB again, former B turned into A
 n=3: A B A A B note all A&#x27;s producing a copy of themselves in the first place, then a B, which turns ...
 n=4: A B A A B A B A ... into an A one generation later, starting to spawn/repeat/recurse then

The result is the sequence of Fibonacci words. If one counts the length of each string, the Fibonacci sequence of numbers is obtained (skipping the first 1, due to the choice of axiom):

: 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 ...

If it is not desired to skip the first 1, axiom &quot;B&quot; can be used. That would place &quot;B&quot; node before the topmost node (&quot;A&quot;) of the graph above.

For each string, if one counts the &quot;k&quot;-th position from the left end of the string, the value is determined by whether a multiple of the golden ratio falls within the interval formula_1. The ratio of A to B likewise converges to the golden mean.

This example yields the same result (in terms of the length of each string, not the sequence of &quot;A&quot;s and &quot;B&quot;s) if the rule (&quot;A&quot; → &quot;AB&quot;) is replaced with (&quot;A&quot; → &quot;BA&quot;), except that the strings are mirrored.

This sequence is a locally catenative sequence because formula_2, where formula_3 is the &quot;n&quot;-th generation.

===Example 2: fractal (binary) tree===
* variables : 0, 1
* constants: &quot;[&quot;, &quot;]&quot;
* axiom : 0
* rules : (1 → 11), (0 → 1[0]0)

The shape is built by recursively feeding the axiom through the production rules. Each character of the input string is checked against the rule list to determine which character or string to replace it with in the output string. In this example, a &#x27;1&#x27; in the input string becomes &#x27;11&#x27; in the output string, while &#x27;[&#x27; remains the same. Applying this to the axiom of &#x27;0&#x27;, one gets:

It can be seen that this string quickly grows in size and complexity. This string can be drawn as an image by using turtle graphics, where each symbol is assigned a graphical operation for the turtle to perform. For example, in the sample above, the turtle may be given the following instructions:

* 0: draw a line segment ending in a leaf
* 1: draw a line segment
* [: push position and angle, turn left 45 degrees
* ]: pop position and angle, turn right 45 degrees

The push and pop refer to a LIFO stack (more technical grammar would have separate symbols for &quot;push position&quot; and &quot;turn left&quot;). When the turtle interpretation encounters a &#x27;[&#x27;, the current position and angle are saved, and are then restored when the interpretation encounters a &#x27;]&#x27;. If multiple values have been &quot;pushed,&quot; then a &quot;pop&quot; restores the most recently saved values. Applying the graphical rules listed above to the earlier recursion, one gets:

===Example 3: Cantor set===

: variables : A B
: constants : none
: start : A {starting character string}
: rules : (A → ABA), (B → BBB)

Let &quot;A&quot; mean &quot;draw forward&quot; and &quot;B&quot; mean &quot;move forward&quot;.

This produces the famous Cantor&#x27;s fractal set on a real straight line R.

===Example 4: Koch curve===
A variant of the Koch curve which uses only right angles.

: variables : F
: constants : + −
: start : F
: rules : (F → F+F−F−F+F)

Here, F means &quot;draw forward&quot;, + means &quot;turn left 90°&quot;, and − means &quot;turn right 90°&quot; (see turtle graphics).

: &quot;n&quot; = 0:
:: F

: &quot;n&quot; = 1:
:: F+F−F−F+F

: &quot;n&quot; = 2:
:: F+F−F−F+F+F+F−F−F+F−F+F−F−F+F−F+F−F−F+F+F+F−F−F+F

: &quot;n&quot; = 3:
:: F+F−F−F+F+F+F−F−F+F−F+F−F−F+F−F+F−F−F+F+F+F−F−F+F+
::F+F−F−F+F+F+F−F−F+F−F+F−F−F+F−F+F−F−F+F+F+F−F−F+F−
:: F+F−F−F+F+F+F−F−F+F−F+F−F−F+F−F+F−F−F+F+F+F−F−F+F−
:: F+F−F−F+F+F+F−F−F+F−F+F−F−F+F−F+F−F−F+F+F+F−F−F+F+
:: F+F−F−F+F+F+F−F−F+F−F+F−F−F+F−F+F−F−F+F+F+F−F−F+F

===Example 5: Sierpinski triangle===
The Sierpinski triangle drawn using an L-system.

: variables : F G
: constants : + −
: start : F−G−G
: rules : (F → F−G+F+G−F), (G → GG)
: angle : 120°

Here, F and G both mean &quot;draw forward&quot;, + means &quot;turn left by angle&quot;, and − means &quot;turn right by angle&quot;.

It is also possible to approximate the Sierpinski triangle using a Sierpiński arrowhead curve L-system.

: variables : A B
: constants : + −
: start : A
: rules : (A → B−A−B), (B → A+B+A)
: angle : 60°

Here, A and B both mean &quot;draw forward&quot;, + means &quot;turn left by angle&quot;, and − means &quot;turn right by angle&quot; (see turtle graphics).


===Example 6: dragon curve ===
The dragon curve drawn using an L-system.

: variables : F G
: constants : + −
: start : F
: rules : (F → F+G), (G → F-G)
: angle : 90°

Here, F and G both mean &quot;draw forward&quot;, + means &quot;turn left by angle&quot;, and − means &quot;turn right by angle&quot;.

===Example 7: fractal plant ===
: variables : X F
: constants : + − [ ]
: start : -X
: rules : (X → F+[[X]-X]-F[-FX]+X), (F → FF)
: angle : 25°

First one needs to initialize an empty stack. This follows the LIFO (Last in, First Out) method to add and remove elements. 
Here, F means &quot;draw forward&quot;, − means &quot;turn right 25°&quot;, and + means &quot;turn left 25°&quot;. X does not correspond to any drawing action and is used to control the evolution of the curve. The square bracket &quot;[&quot; corresponds to saving the current values for position and angle, so the position and angle are pushed to the top of the stack, when the &quot;]&quot; token is encountered, the stack is popped and the position and angle are reset. Every &quot;[&quot; comes before every &quot;]&quot; token.

==Variations==
A number of elaborations on this basic L-system technique have been developed which can be used in conjunction with each other. Among these are [[stochastic grammar]]s, [[context sensitive grammar]]s, and parametric grammars.

===Stochastic grammars===
The grammar model we have discussed thus far has been deterministic—that is, given any symbol in the grammar&#x27;s alphabet, there has been exactly one production rule, which is always chosen, and always performs the same conversion. One alternative is to specify more than one production rule for a symbol, giving each a [[probability]] of occurring. For example, in the grammar of Example 2, we could change the rule for rewriting &quot;0&quot; from:

:0 → 1[0]0

to a probabilistic rule:

:0 (0.5) → 1[0]0
:0 (0.5) → 0

Under this production, whenever a &quot;0&quot; is encountered during string rewriting, there would be a 50% chance it would behave as previously described, and a 50% chance it would not change during production. When a stochastic grammar is used in an [[evolution]]ary context, it is advisable to incorporate a [[random]] seed into the [[genotype]], so that the stochastic properties of the image remain constant between generations.

===Context sensitive grammars===
A context sensitive production rule looks not only at the symbol it is modifying, but the symbols on the string appearing before and after it. For instance, the production rule:

:b &lt; a &gt; c → aa

transforms &quot;a&quot; to &quot;aa&quot;, but only if the &quot;a&quot; occurs between a &quot;b&quot; and a &quot;c&quot; in the input string:

:…bac…

As with stochastic productions, there are multiple productions to handle symbols in different contexts. If no production rule can be found for a given context, the identity production is assumed, and the symbol does not change on transformation. If context-sensitive and context-free productions both exist within the same grammar, the context-sensitive production is assumed to take precedence when it is applicable.

===Parametric grammars===
In a parametric grammar, each symbol in the alphabet has a parameter list associated with it. A symbol coupled with its parameter list is called a module, and a string in a parametric grammar is a series of modules. An example string might be:

:a(0,1)[b(0,0)]a(1,2)

The parameters can be used by the drawing functions, and also by the production rules. The production rules can use the parameters in two ways: first, in a conditional statement determining whether the rule will apply, and second, the production rule can modify the actual parameters. For example, look at:

:a(x,y) : x == 0 → a(1, y+1)b(2,3)

The module a(x,y) undergoes transformation under this production rule if the conditional x=0 is met. For example, a(0,2) would undergo transformation, and a(1,2) would not.

In the transformation portion of the production rule, the parameters as well as entire modules can be affected. In the above example, the module b(x,y) is added to the string, with initial parameters (2,3). Also, the parameters of the already existing module are transformed. Under the above production rule,

:a(0,2)

Becomes

:a(1,3)b(2,3)

as the &quot;x&quot; parameter of a(x,y) is explicitly transformed to a &quot;1&quot; and the &quot;y&quot; parameter of a is incremented by one.

Parametric grammars allow line lengths and branching angles to be determined by the grammar, rather than the turtle interpretation methods. Also, if age is given as a parameter for a module, rules can change depending on the age of a plant segment, allowing animations of the entire life-cycle of the tree to be created.

===Bi-directional grammars===
The bi-directional model explicitly separates the symbolic rewriting system from the shape assignment. For example, the string rewriting process in the Example 2 (Fractal tree) is independent on how graphical operations are assigned to the symbols. In other words, an infinite number of draw methods are applicable to a given rewriting system.

The bi-directional model consists of 1) a forward process constructs the derivation tree with production rules, and 2) a backward process realizes the tree with shapes in a stepwise manner (from leaves to the root). Each inverse-derivation step involves essential geometric-topological reasoning. With this bi-directional framework, design constraints and objectives are encoded in the grammar-shape translation. In architectural design applications, the bi-directional grammar features consistent interior connectivity and a rich spatial hierarchy.

== L-system Construction and Inference ==

=== Manual L-System Construction ===
Historically, the construction of L-systems relied heavily on manual efforts by experts, requiring detailed measurements, domain knowledge, and significant time investment. The process often involved analyzing biological structures and encoding their developmental rules into L-systems, symbol by symbol. This labor-intensive method made creating accurate models for complex processes both tedious and error-prone.

A notable example is Nishida&#x27;s work on Japanese Cypress trees, where he manually segmented branches from a series of images and identified 42 distinct growth mechanisms to construct a stochastic L-system. Despite the significant effort involved, the resulting system provided only an approximation of the tree&#x27;s growth, illustrating the challenges of manually encoding such detailed biological processes. This arduous task was described as &quot;tedious and intricate,&quot; underscoring the limitations of manual approaches.

The challenges of manual L-system construction are also well-documented in The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants by Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz and Aristid Lindenmayerd. The book demonstrates how L-systems can elegantly model plant growth and fractal patterns, but the examples often required expert intervention to define the necessary rules.

Manual construction was further constrained by the need for domain-specific expertise, as seen in other applications of L-systems beyond biology, such as architectural design and urban modeling. In these fields, creating an accurate L-system required not only an understanding of the L-system formalism but also extensive knowledge of the domain being modeled.

=== L-system Inference ===

The idea of automating L-system inference emerged to address the inefficiencies of manual methods, which often required extensive expertise, measurements, and trial-and-error processes. This automation aimed to enable the inference of L-systems directly from observational data, eliminating the need for manual encoding of rules.

Initial algorithms primarily targeted deterministic context-free L-systems (D0L-systems), which are among the simplest types of L-systems. These early efforts demonstrated the feasibility of automatic inference but were severely limited in scope, typically handling only systems with small alphabets and simple rewriting rules. For instance, Nakano&#x27;s work highlighted the challenges of inferring L-systems with larger alphabets and more complex structures, describing the task as &quot;immensely complicated&quot;.

=== Manual and Semi-Automated Tools ===
Early tools for L-system inference were often designed to assist experts rather than replace them. For example, systems that presented a population of potential L-systems to the user, allowing them to select aesthetically pleasing or plausible options, reduced some of the manual burden. However, these tools relied heavily on human judgment and did not fully automate the inference process.

=== Domain-Specific Inference Approaches ===
Some early algorithms were tightly integrated into specific research domains mainly plant modeling. These approaches utilized domain knowledge to constrain the search space and achieve better results. However, their reliance on predefined domain-specific rules limited their generalizability and applicability to other areas.

=== Generalized Inference Algorithms ===
Attempts to create generalized algorithms for L-system inference began with deterministic context-free systems. Researchers aimed to infer L-systems from data alone, such as sequences of strings or temporal data from images, without relying on domain-specific knowledge. These algorithms encountered significant challenges, including:

* The exponential growth of the search space with increasing alphabet size and rule complexity. 

* Dealing with imperfect or noisy data, which introduced errors in the inferred systems.

* Limitations in computational efficiency, as exhaustive search methods became intractable for all but the simplest cases.

Bernard&#x27;s PhD dissertation, supervised by Dr. Ian McQuillan at the University of Saskatchewan, represents a significant advancement in L-system inference, introducing the Plant Model Inference Tools (PMIT) suite. Despite the name, this tool is problem agnostic, and is so-named due to the source of the original funding from the P2IRC project. These tools address the challenges of inferring deterministic, stochastic, and parametric L-systems:

Deterministic Context-Free L-Systems (D0L):

The PMIT-D0L tool improved the state-of-the-art by enabling the inference of L-systems with up to 31 symbols, compared to previous algorithms that managed only two. This was achieved through novel encoding techniques and search-space reduction methods.

Deterministic Context-Sensitive L-Systems (D(j,k)L):

The PMIT-DCSL tool further improved the inference of deterministic L-systems by demonstrating that the techniques worked in the context-sensitive case with little modification. This tool also presented further improvements allowing for the inference of deterministic L-systems with up to hundreds of symbols. Furthermore, this work and McQuillan&#x27;s theoretical paper proves the complexity of context-sensitive L-systems inference. In an unpublished work, Bernard claims to show that context-sensitivity never changes the fundamental nature of the inference problem regardless of the selection rule. That is to say, inferring context-sensitive stochastic L-systems is possible if inferring context-free L-system is possible.

Stochastic L-Systems (S0L):

For stochastic L-systems, PMIT-S0L was developed, which uses a hybrid greedy and genetic algorithm approach to infer systems from multiple string sequences. The tool demonstrated the ability to infer rewriting rules and probabilities with high accuracy, a first in the field.

Temporal Parametric L-Systems:

McQuillan first realized that parametric L-systems could be thought of as stochastic L-systems; however, this did not solve the problem of inferring the parametric selection rules. Using Cartesian Genetic Programming, parametric L-systems could be inferred along with the parametric selection rules so long as the parameter set included time (in order to, provide a sequence to the parameters, but time is a reasonable parameter for any real process). This tool, PMIT-PARAM, successfully inferred complex systems with up to 27 rewriting rules, setting a new benchmark in L-system inference.

== Open problems ==
There are many open problems involving studies of L-systems. For example:

* Characterisation of all the deterministic context-free L-systems which are [[locally catenative sequence|locally catenative]]. (A complete solution is known only in the case where there are only two variables).

== Types of L-systems ==
L-systems on the [[real number|real line]] R:
*[[Prouhet-Thue-Morse system]]

Well-known L-systems on a plane R2 are: 
* [[space-filling curve]]s ([[Hilbert curve]], [[Peano&#x27;s curve]]s, Dekking&#x27;s church, [[kolam]]s),
* median space-filling curves ([[Lévy C curve]], [[dragon curve|Harter-Heighway dragon curve]], Davis-Knuth terdragon),
* tilings ([[sphinx tiling]], [[Penrose tiling]])

<doc id="46568" wikidata="Q990900" url="?curid=46568" title="Bread pudding">
<text>Bread pudding is a bread-based dessert popular in many countries&#x27; cuisines. It is made with stale bread and milk or cream, generally containing eggs, a form of fat such as oil, butter or suet and, depending on whether the pudding is sweet or savory, a variety of other ingredients. Sweet bread puddings may use sugar, syrup, honey, dried fruit, nuts, as well as spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg, mace, or vanilla. The bread is soaked in the liquids, mixed with the other ingredients, and baked. Some other names bread pudding goes by is &quot;poor man&#x27;s pudding&quot;, &quot;bread and butter pudding&quot; or just &quot;pudding&quot;.

Savory puddings like breakfast strata may be served as main courses, while sweet puddings are typically eaten as desserts.

In other languages, its name is a translation of &quot;bread pudding&quot; or even just &quot;pudding&quot;, for example &quot;pudín&quot; or &quot;budín&quot;. In the Philippines, banana bread pudding is popular. In Mexico, there is a similar dish eaten during Lent called &quot;capirotada&quot;. In Liverpool in the United Kingdom, a moist version of Nelson cake, itself a bread pudding, is nicknamed &quot;Wet Nelly&quot;.

==History==

Bread pudding originated with 11th-century English cooks who repurposed leftover stale bread. In the following centuries, the dish became known as &quot;poor man&#x27;s pudding&quot; because of the scarcity of food at the time, with the pudding being made only with boiling water, sugar, and spices.

It was only in the 13th century that eggs and milk were added to the recipe, which then became known as &quot;bread and butter pudding&quot;.

The 18th-century English cookbook &quot;The Compleat Housewife&quot; contains two recipes for baked bread pudding. The first is identified as &quot;A Bread and Butter Pudding for Fasting Days&quot;. To make the pudding a baking dish is lined with puff pastry, and slices of penny loaf with butter, raisins and currants, and pieces of butter are added in alternating layers. Over this is poured thickened, spiced cream and orange blossom water, and the dish is baked in the oven. There is another version of the dish that is simpler, omitting the spices and dried fruits.

With the arrival of the first settlers in the 13 English Colonies in America, bread pudding became popular in the colonies and later in the United States. 

== Regional variations ==
In the United Kingdom, bread pudding is made with seasonings such as nutmeg and cinnamon. It is served with a rum or whisky sauce or a hot custard. 

In Belgium, particularly Brussels, bread pudding is baked with brown sugar, cinnamon, stale bread, and raisins or apple. 

In Canada, bread pudding is sometimes made with maple syrup.

In Hong Kong, bread pudding is usually served with vanilla cream dressing.

In Hungary, it is called (literally, &quot;bonfire&quot;) which is baked with whipped egg whites on top.

In Malaysia, bread pudding is eaten with custard sauce.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany, black bread is used to make &quot;black bread pudding&quot; ().

In the Philippines, stale unsold bread are commonly used by bakeries to make the characteristically bright red filling of &quot;pan de regla&quot;.

In the United States, especially Louisiana, bread puddings are typically sweet and served as dessert with a sweet sauce of some sort, such as whiskey sauce, rum sauce, or caramel sauce.

In Puerto Rico, there are many variations of bread pudding on the island. Cream cheese with lime zest and guava or coconut-sweet plantain with rum raisins is perhaps the most popular. Bread pudding is always made with a variety of spices. Puerto Rican bread pudding is cooked the same as crème caramel with caramel poured into a baking dish and then the pudding mix is poured on top. The baking dish is placed in a bain-marie and then in the oven.

In Argentina, Peru, Paraguay, and Uruguay, bread pudding is known as &quot;budín de pan&quot;.

In Brazil, bread pudding is known as &quot;pudim de pão&quot;. The dish consists of bread, eggs, milk, condensed milk, butter, vanilla extract, and a pinch of cinnamon (optional). However, all the ingredients are mixed together in a blender and poured into a bundt-like mold (with a hole in the middle) lined with caramelized sugar syrup, which is then baked in a water bath for about 1 hour and a half. Afterwards, it is left to cool before unmolding and serving. When ready, its appearance can be compared to a creamy yet dense flan.

In Panama, bread pudding is known as &quot;mamallena&quot;.

In Aruba, bread pudding is known as &quot;pan bolo&quot;.

In Cuba, bread pudding is known as &quot;pudín de pan&quot; and many serve it with a guava marmalade.

<text>Betuwe (), also known in English as Batavia ( ), is a historical and geographical region in the Netherlands, forming large fertile islands in the river delta formed by the waters of the Rhine (Dutch: &quot;Rijn&quot;) and Meuse (Dutch: &quot;Maas&quot;) rivers. During the Roman Empire, it was an important frontier region and source of imperial soldiers. Its name is possibly pre-Roman.

Administratively, the modern version, Betuwe, is a part of the modern province of Gelderland and although the rivers and provinces have changed over history it is roughly the same. Today it has the Waal river on the south and the Lek and Nederrijn in the north (all rivers which start in the delta itself and are branches of the Rhine or Maas). Historically, the former municipality of Rijnwaarden belonged to Betuwe, now in Zevenaar, which was cut off by the building of the Pannerdens Kanaal.

A major freight railroad, the Betuweroute, passes through the Betuwe. It was opened in 2007 after many years of controversy.

The Betuwe region is divided into nine municipalities: Lingewaard, Arnhem (southern part), Nijmegen (northern part), Overbetuwe, Neder-Betuwe, Buren, Tiel, Culemborg and West Betuwe. The region is characterised by its many orchards, and is for centuries known as the fruit garden of the Netherlands.

==Pre-Roman==

The &quot;Batavian island&quot; in the Rhine river was mentioned by Julius Caesar in his commentary &quot;Commentarii de Bello Gallico&quot;. The island&#x27;s easternmost point is at a split in the Rhine, one arm being the Waal and the other the Lower Rhine/Old Rhine (hence the Latin name &quot;Insula Batavorum&quot;, &quot;Island of the Batavi&quot;). Much later Tacitus wrote that the Batavians who lived there had originally been a part of the Chatti, a tribe in Germany never mentioned by Caesar, who were forced by internal dissension to move to their new home.

Tacitus also reports that before their arrival the area had been &quot;an uninhabited district on the extremity of the coast of Gaul, and also of a neighbouring island, surrounded by the ocean in front, and by the river Rhine in the rear and on either side&quot;. In a more detailed description he writes: 
The island of the Batavi was the appointed rendezvous because of its easy landing-places, and its convenience for receiving the army and carrying the war across the river. For the Rhine after flowing continuously in a single channel or encircling merely insignificant islands, divides itself, so to say, where the Batavian territory begins, into two rivers, retaining its name and the rapidity of its course in the stream which washes Germany, till it mingles with the ocean. On the Gallic bank, its flow is broader and gentler; it is called by an altered name, the Vahal, by the inhabitants of its shore. Soon that name too is changed for the Mosa river, through whose vast mouth it empties itself into the same ocean.

Modern archaeologists disagree with Tacitus, noting that that island had a pre-Roman and pre-Germanic population, apparently already called the Batavians. Caesar indeed had not only implied the existence of pre-Roman Batavians, but also mentioned that the Belgic Menapii of the Flemish coast had settlements stretching as far as the beginning of the delta, near the modern border with Germany.

==Roman era==

During the Roman Empire there was a &quot;civitas&quot; of the Batavians, a Germanic tribe. It was described as a large island between rivers in the Rhine-Meuse delta, the modern equivalent of Betuwe. The Batavians shared the island with the Canninefates, to their west near the coast. Their Roman city was Nijmegen.

The name was also mentioned by Pliny the Elder, and it played a role in the account by Tacitus of the Germanic uprising of 68. He said that &quot;In the Rhine itself, nearly in length, Batavia is the most famous island of the Batavi and the Canninefates&quot;.

Its later Roman history is attested by Ammianus Marcellinus who mentions the Frankish Salians as a people living there. Zosimus is the only classical author who claims that they had first crossed the Rhine during the Roman upheavals and subsequent Germanic breakthrough in 260 AD. Both authors agree that from Batavia they were pushed south, into Toxandria.

==Medieval==
In the Carolingian and Ottonian periods in the early Middle Ages, Batavia, called &quot;Batua&quot; by the Franks, was an example of a Frankish &quot;gau&quot; that was based on much older Roman &quot;pagi&quot;. Several counts are recorded as having their counties there, and it is mentioned in the treaties such as the Treaty of Meerssen, that divided up Europe among the different Frankish kingdoms.

Later, it was mainly absorbed into the newer county of Guelders which had become established to the southeast.

==Renaissance==
In the Renaissance, the Dutch wanted to rediscover their pre-medieval Batavi culture and history. This common history raised Batavi to the status of &quot;cultural ancestors&quot; to all Dutch people (see &quot;The Batavian revival&quot;). They occasionally called themselves, or their things (&quot;Batavia&quot;), Batavians, resulting even in a short-lived Batavian Republic. The name &quot;Batavia&quot; was also taken to the colonies such as the Dutch East Indies, where they renamed the city of Jayakarta to become Batavia from 1619 until about 1942, when its name was changed to Djakarta (short for the former name Jayakarta, later respelt Jakarta; see: History of Jakarta). The name was also used in Suriname, where they founded Batavia, Suriname, and in the United States where the Holland Land Company founded the city and the town of Batavia, New York. This name spread further west in the United States to such places as Batavia, Illinois, near Chicago, and Batavia, Ohio.

When the Pannerdens Kanaal was dug between 1701 and 1709, the easternmost tip of the Betuwe (including the towns of Pannerden and Lobith) was cut off from the rest of the region.

==20th century==

In the aftermath of the failed allied Operation Market Garden, the Germans attempted to retake the Allied gains during the Battle of the Nijmegen salient but were unsuccessful.

In the period 1940-1990, land consolidation took place throughout the area. This made further economies of scale and departmentalisation in the fruit production possible.

In 1995, a large part of this area had to be evacuated because the rivers threatened to overflow. This did not happen, but it raised the debate again about whether to reinforce the dikes.

<text>The oat (Avena sativa), sometimes called the common oat, is a species of cereal grain grown for its seed, which is known by the same name (usually in the plural). Oats appear to have been domesticated as a secondary crop, as their seeds resembled those of other cereals closely enough for them to be included by early cultivators. Oats tolerate cold winters less well than cereals such as wheat, barley, and rye, but need less summer heat and more rain, making them important in areas such as Northwest Europe that have cool wet summers. They can tolerate low-nutrient and acid soils. Oats grow thickly and vigorously, allowing them to outcompete many weeds, and compared to other cereals are relatively free from diseases. 

Oats are used for human consumption as oatmeal, including as steel cut oats or rolled oats. Global production is dominated by Canada and Russia; global trade is a small part of production, most of the grain being consumed within the producing countries. Oats are a nutrient-rich food associated with lower blood cholesterol and reduced risk of human heart disease when consumed regularly. One of the most common uses of oats is as livestock feed; the crop can also be grown as groundcover and ploughed in as a green manure.

== Origins ==

=== Phylogeny ===

Phylogenetic analysis using molecular DNA and morphological evidence places the oat genus &quot;Avena&quot; in the Pooideae subfamily. That subfamily includes the cereals wheat, barley, and rye; they are in the Triticeae tribe, while &quot;Avena&quot; is in the Poeae, along with grasses such as &quot;Briza&quot; and &quot;Agrostis&quot;. The wild ancestor of &quot;Avena sativa&quot; and the closely related minor crop – &quot;A. byzantina&quot; – is &quot;A. sterilis&quot;, a naturally hexaploid wild oat, one that has its DNA in six sets of chromosomes. Genetic evidence shows that the ancestral forms of &quot;A. sterilis&quot; grew in the Fertile Crescent of the Near East. 

Analysis of maternal lineages of 25 &quot;Avena&quot; species using chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA showed that &quot;A. sativa&quot; hexaploid genome derives from three diploid oat species (each with two sets of chromosomes); the sets are dubbed A, B, C, and D. The diploid species are the CC &quot;A. ventricosa&quot;, the AA &quot;A. canariensis&quot;, and the AA &quot;A. longiglumis&quot;, along with two tetraploid oats (each with four sets), namely the AACC &quot;A. insularis&quot; and the AABB &quot;A. agadiriana&quot;. Tetraploids were formed as much as 10.6 mya, and hexaploids as much as 7.4 mya.&#x27;

=== Domestication ===

Genomic study suggests that the hulled variety and the naked variety &quot;A. sativa var. nuda&quot; diverged around 51,200 years ago, long before domestication. This implies that the two varieties were domesticated independently. 

Oats are thought to have emerged as a secondary crop. This means that they are derived from what was considered a weed of the primary cereal domesticates such as wheat. They survived as a Vavilovian mimic by having grains that Neolithic people found hard to distinguish from the primary crop.

Oats were cultivated for some thousands of years before they were domesticated. A granary from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic, about 11,400 to 11,200 years ago in the Jordan Valley in the Middle East contained a large number of wild oat grains (120,000 seeds of &quot;A. sterilis&quot;). The find implies intentional cultivation. Domesticated oat grains first appear in the archaeological record in Europe around 3000 years ago.

== Description ==

The oat is a tall stout grass, a member of the family Poaceae; it can grow to a height of . The leaves are long, narrow, and pointed, and grow upwards; they can be some in length, and around in width. At the top of the stem, the plant branches into a loose cluster or panicle of spikelets. These contain the wind-pollinated flowers, which mature into the oat seeds or grains. Botanically the grain is a caryopsis, as the wall of the fruit is fused on to the actual seed. Like other cereal grains, the caryopsis contains the outer husk or bran, the starchy food store or endosperm which occupies most of the seed, and the protein-rich germ which if planted in soil can grow into a new plant.

== Agronomy ==

=== Cultivation ===

Oats are annual plants best grown in temperate regions. They tolerate cold winters less well than wheat, rye, or barley; they are harmed by sustained cold below . They have a lower summer heat requirement and greater tolerance of (and need for) rain than the other cereals mentioned, so they are particularly important in areas with cool, wet summers, such as Northwest Europe.

Oats can grow in most fertile, drained soils, being tolerant of a wide variety of soil types. Although better yields are achieved at a soil pH of 5.3 to 5.7, oats can tolerate soils with a pH as low as 4.5. They are better able to grow in low-nutrient soils than wheat or maize, but generally are less tolerant of high soil salinity than other cereals. Traditionally, US farmers grew oats alongside red clover and alfalfa, which fixed nitrogen and provided animal forage. With less use of horses and more use of fertilizers, growth of these crops in the US declined. For example, the state of Iowa led US oat production until 1989, but has largely switched to maize and soybeans.

=== Weeds, pests, and diseases ===

Oats can outcompete many weeds, as they grow thickly (with many leafy shoots) and vigorously, but are still subject to some broadleaf weeds. Control can be by herbicides, or by integrated pest management with measures such as sowing seed that is free of weeds.

Oats are relatively free from diseases. Nonetheless, they suffer from some leaf diseases, such as stem rust (&quot;Puccinia graminis&quot; f. sp. &quot;avenae&quot;) and crown rust (&quot;P. coronata&quot; var. &quot;avenae&quot;). 
Crown rust infection can greatly reduce photosynthesis and overall physiological activities of oat leaves, thereby reducing growth and crop yield.

=== Processing ===

Harvested oats go through multiple stages of milling. The first stage is cleaning, to remove seeds of other plants, stones and any other extraneous materials. Next is dehulling to remove the indigestible bran, leaving the seed or &quot;groat&quot;. Heating denatures enzymes in the seed that would make it go sour or rancid; the grain is then dried to minimise the risk of spoilage by bacteria and fungi. There may follow numerous stages of cutting or grinding the grain, depending on which sort of product is required. For oatmeal (oat flour), the grain is ground to a specified fineness. For home use such as making porridge, oats are often rolled flat to make them quicker to cook.

Oat flour can be ground for small scale use by pulsing rolled oats or old-fashioned (not quick) oats in a food processor or spice mill.

== Production and trade ==

In 2022, global production of oats was 26 million tonnes, led by Canada with 20% of the total and Russia with 17% (table). This compares to over 100 million tonnes for wheat, for example. Global trade represents a modest percentage of production, less than 10%, most of the grain being consumed within producing countries. The main exporter is Canada, followed by Sweden and Finland; the US is the main importer.

Oats futures are traded in US dollars in quantities of 5000 bushels on the Chicago Board of Trade and have delivery dates in March, May, July, September, and December.

== Genomics ==

=== Genome ===

&quot;Avena sativa&quot; is an allohexaploid species with three ancestral genomes (2&quot;n&quot;=6&quot;x&quot;=42; AACCDD). As a result, the genome is large (12.6 Gb, 1C-value=12.85) and complex. Cultivated hexaploid oat has a unique mosaic chromosome architecture that is the result of numerous translocations between the three subgenomes. These translocations may cause breeding barriers and incompatibilities when crossing varieties with different chromosomal architecture. Hence, oat breeding and the crossing of desired traits has been hampered by the lack of a reference genome assembly. In May 2022, a fully annotated reference genome sequence of &quot;Avena sativa&quot; was reported. The AA subgenome is presumed to be derived from &quot;Avena longiglumis&quot; and the CCDD from the tetraploid &quot;Avena insularis&quot;.

=== Genetics and breeding ===

Species of &quot;Avena&quot; can hybridize, and genes introgressed (brought in) from other &quot;A&quot; genome species have contributed many valuable traits, like resistance to oat crown rust. is one such trait, introgressed from &quot;A. sterilis&quot; CAV 1979, conferring all stage resistance (ASR) against &quot;Pca&quot;.

It is possible to hybridize oats with grasses in other genera, allowing plant breeders the ready introgression of traits. In contrast to wheat, oats sometimes retain chromosomes from maize or pearl millet after such crosses. These wide crosses are typically made to generate doubled haploid breeding material; the rapid loss of the alien chromosomes from the unrelated pollen donor results in a plant with only a single set of chromosomes (a haploid).

The addition lines with alien chromosomes can be used as a source for novel traits in oats. For example, research on oat-maize-addition lines has been used to map genes involved in C4 photosynthesis. To obtain Mendelian inheritance of these novel traits, radiation hybrid lines have been established, where maize chromosome segments have been introgressed into the oat genome. This potentially transfers thousands of genes from a species that is distantly related, but is not considered a GMO technique.

A 2013 study applied simple sequence repeat and found five major groupings, namely commercial cultivars and four landrace groups.

== Nutritive value ==

=== Nutrients ===

Uncooked oats are 66% carbohydrates, including 11% dietary fiber and 4% beta-glucans, 7% fat, 17% protein, and 8% water (table). In a reference serving of , oats provide and are a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of protein (34% DV), dietary fiber (44% DV), several B vitamins, and numerous dietary minerals, especially manganese (213% DV) (table).

=== Health effects ===

Regular consumption of oat products lowers blood levels of low-density lipoprotein and total cholesterol, reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. The beneficial effect of oat consumption on lowering blood lipids is attributed to oat beta-glucan. Oat consumption can help to reduce body mass index in obese people. 

The United States Food and Drug Administration allows companies to make health claims on labels of food products that contain soluble fiber from whole oats, as long as the food provides 0.75 grams of soluble fiber per serving.

== Uses ==

=== As food ===

When used in foods, oats are most commonly rolled or crushed into oatmeal or ground into fine oat flour. Oatmeal is chiefly eaten as porridge, but may also be used in a variety of baked goods, such as oatcakes (which may be made with coarse steel-cut oats for a rougher texture), oatmeal cookies and oat bread. Oats are an ingredient in many cold cereals, in particular muesli and granola; the Quaker Oats Company introduced instant oatmeal in 1966. Oats are also used to produce milk substitutes (&quot;oat milk&quot;). the oat milk market became the second-largest among plant milks in the United States, following almond milk, but exceeding the sales of soy milk. As a mainstay of West Wales for centuries, until changes in farming practices in the 1960s, oats were used in many traditional Welsh dishes, including laverbread, a Welsh breakfast, and &quot;cockles and eggs&quot; served with oatbread.

In Britain, oats are sometimes used for brewing beer, such as oatmeal stout where a percentage of oats, often 30%, is added to the barley for the wort. Oatmeal caudle, made of ale and oatmeal with spices, was a traditional British drink and a favourite of Oliver Cromwell. 

=== Animal feed ===

Oats are commonly used as feed for horses when extra carbohydrates and the subsequent boost in energy are required. The oat hull may be crushed (&quot;rolled&quot; or &quot;crimped&quot;) to make them easier to digest, or may be fed whole. They may be given alone or as part of a blended food pellet. Cattle are also fed oats, either whole or ground into a coarse flour using a roller mill, burr mill, or hammermill. Oat forage is commonly used to feed all kinds of ruminants, as pasture, straw, hay or silage.

=== Ground cover ===

Winter oats may be grown as an off-season groundcover and ploughed under in the spring as a green fertilizer, or harvested in early summer. They also can be used for pasture; they can be grazed a while, then allowed to head out for grain production, or grazed continuously until other pastures are ready.

=== Other uses ===

Oat straw is used as animal bedding; it absorbs liquids better than wheat straw. The straw can be used for making corn dollies, small decorative woven figures. Tied in a muslin bag, oat straw has been used to soften bath water.

== Celiac disease ==

Celiac (or coeliac) disease is a permanent autoimmune disease triggered by gluten proteins. It almost always occurs in genetically predisposed people, having a prevalence of about 1% in the developed world. Oat products are frequently contaminated by other gluten-containing grains, mainly wheat and barley, requiring caution in the use of oats if people are sensitive to the gluten in those grains. For example, oat bread often contains only a small proportion of oats alongside wheat or other cereals. Use of pure oats in a gluten-free diet offers improved nutritional value, but remains controversial because a small proportion of people with celiac disease react to pure oats.

== In human culture ==

In his 1755 &quot;Dictionary of the English Language&quot;, Samuel Johnson defined oats as &quot;A grain, which in England is generally given to horses, but in Scotland supports the people.&quot;

&quot;Oats and Beans and Barley Grow&quot; is the first line of a traditional folksong (1380 in the Roud Folk Song Index), recorded in different forms from 1870. Similar songs are recorded from France, Canada, Belgium, Sweden, and Italy.

In English, oats are associated with sexual intercourse, as in the idioms &quot;sowing one&#x27;s (wild) oats&quot;, meaning having many sexual partners in one&#x27;s youth, and &quot;getting your oats&quot;, meaning having sex regularly.

<text>Rye (Secale cereale) is a grass grown extensively as a grain, a cover crop and a forage crop. It is grown principally in an area from Eastern and Northern Europe into Russia. It is much more tolerant of cold weather and poor soil than other cereals, making it useful in those regions; its vigorous growth suppresses weeds and provides abundant forage for animals early in the year. It is a member of the wheat tribe (Triticeae) which includes the cereals wheat and barley. It is likely that rye arrived in Europe as a secondary crop, meaning that it was a minor admixture in wheat as a result of Vavilovian mimicry, and was only later cultivated in its own right.

Rye grain is used for bread, beer, rye whiskey, and animal fodder. In Scandinavia, rye was a staple food in the Middle Ages, and rye crispbread remains a popular food in the region. Europe produces around half of the world&#x27;s rye; relatively little is traded between countries. A wheat-rye hybrid, triticale, combines the qualities of the two parent crops and is produced in large quantities worldwide. In European folklore, the (&quot;rye wolf&quot;) is a carnivorous corn demon or .

== Origins ==

The rye genus &quot;Secale&quot; is in the grass tribe Triticeae, which contains other cereals such as barley (&quot;Hordeum&quot;) and wheat (&quot;Triticum&quot;).

The generic name &quot;Secale&quot;, related to Italian and French meaning &quot;rye&quot;, is of unknown origin but may derive from a Balkan language. The English name rye derives from Old English , related to Dutch , German , and Russian , again all with the same meaning.

Rye is one of several cereals that grow wild in the Levant, central and eastern Turkey and adjacent areas. Evidence uncovered at the Epipalaeolithic site of Tell Abu Hureyra in the Euphrates valley of northern Syria suggests that rye was among the first cereal crops to be systematically cultivated, around 13,000 years ago. However, that claim remains controversial; critics point to inconsistencies in the radiocarbon dates, and identifications based solely on grain, rather than on chaff.

Domesticated rye occurs in small quantities at a number of Neolithic sites in Asia Minor (Anatolia, now Turkey), such as the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B Can Hasan III near Çatalhöyük, but is otherwise absent from the archaeological record until the Bronze Age of central Europe, c. 1800–1500 BCE. 

It is likely that rye was brought westwards from Asia Minor as a secondary crop, meaning that it was a minor admixture in wheat as a result of Vavilovian mimicry, and was only later cultivated in its own right. Archeological evidence of this grain has been found in Roman contexts along the Rhine and the Danube and in Ireland and Britain. The Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder was dismissive of a grain that may have been rye, writing that it &quot;is a very poor food and only serves to avert starvation&quot;. He said it was mixed with spelt &quot;to mitigate its bitter taste, and even then is most unpleasant to the stomach&quot;.

== Description == 

Rye is a tall grass grown for its seeds; it can be an annual or a biennial. Depending on environmental conditions and variety it reaches in height. Its leaves are blue-green, long, and pointed. The seeds are carried in a curved head or spike some long. The head is composed of many spikelets, each of which holds two small flowers; the spikelets alternate left and right up the head.

== Cultivation ==

Since the Middle Ages, people have cultivated rye widely in Central and Eastern Europe. It serves as the main bread cereal in most areas east of the France–Germany border and north of Hungary. In Southern Europe, it was cultivated on marginal lands.

Rye grows well in much poorer soils than those necessary for most cereal grains. Thus, it is an especially valuable crop in regions where the soil has sand or peat. Rye plants withstand cold better than other small grains, surviving snow cover that would kill winter wheat. Winter rye is the most popular: it is planted and begins to grow in autumn. In spring, the plants develop rapidly. This allows it to provide spring grazing, at a time when spring-planted wheat has only just germinated.

The physical properties of rye affect attributes of the final food product such as seed size, surface area, and porosity. The surface area of the seed directly correlates to the drying and heat transfer time. Smaller seeds have increased heat transfer, which leads to lower drying time. Seeds with lower porosity lose water more slowly during the process of drying.

Rye is harvested like wheat with a combine harvester, which cuts the plants, threshes and winnows the grain, and releases the straw to the field where it is later pressed into bales or left as soil amendment. The resultant grain is stored in local silos or transported to regional grain elevators and combined with other lots for storage and distant shipment. Before the era of mechanised agriculture, rye harvesting was a manual task performed with scythes or sickles.

=== Agroecology ===

Winter rye is any breed of rye planted in the autumn to provide ground cover for the winter. It grows during warmer days of the winter when sunlight temporarily warms the plant above freezing, even while there is general snow cover. It can be used as a cover crop to prevent the growth of winter-hardy weeds. 

Rye grows better than any other cereal in heavy clay and light sandy soil, and infertile or drought-affected soils. It can tolerate pH between 4.5 and 8.0, but soils having pH 5.0 to 7.0 are best suited for rye cultivation. Rye grows best in fertile, well-drained loam or clay-loam soils. As for temperature, the crop can thrive in subzero environments, assisted by the production of antifreeze polypeptides (different from those produced by some fish and insects) by the leaves of winter rye.

Rye is a common, unwanted invader of winter wheat fields. If allowed to grow and mature, it may cause substantially reduced prices (docking) for harvested wheat.

=== Pests and diseases ===

Pests including the nematode &quot;Ditylenchus dipsaci&quot; and a variety of herbivorous insects can seriously affect plant health.

Rye is highly susceptible to the ergot fungus. Consumption of ergot-infected rye by humans and animals results in ergotism, which causes convulsions, miscarriage, necrosis of digits, hallucinations and death. Historically, damp northern countries that depended on rye as a staple crop were subject to periodic epidemics. Modern grain-cleaning and milling methods have practically eliminated ergotism, but it remains a risk if food safety vigilance breaks down.

After an absence of 60 years, stem rust (&quot;Puccinia graminis&quot; f. sp. &quot;tritici&quot;) has returned to Europe in the 2020s. Areas affected include Germany, Russia (Western Siberia), Spain, and Sweden.

== Production and consumption ==

Rye is grown primarily in Eastern, Central and Northern Europe. The main rye belt stretches from northern Germany through Poland, Ukraine, and eastwards into central and northern Russia. Rye is also grown in North America, in South America including Argentina, in Oceania (Australia and New Zealand), in Turkey, and in northern China. Production levels of rye have fallen since 1992 in most of the producing nations, ; for instance, production of rye in Russia fell from 13.9 metric tons in 1992 to 2.2 metric tons in 2022.


World trade of rye is low compared with other grains such as wheat. The total export of rye for 2016 was $186 million compared with $30.1 billion for wheat.

Poland consumes the most rye per person at per capita (2009), followed by the Nordic and Baltic countries. The EU in general is around per capita. The entire world only consumes per capita.

== Nutritional value ==

Raw rye contains 11% water, 76% carbohydrates, 10% protein, and 2% fat (table). A reference amount of rye provides of food energy, and is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of essential nutrients, including dietary fiber, B vitamins, such as thiamine and niacin (each at 25% DV), and several dietary minerals. Highest micronutrient contents are for manganese (130% DV) and phosphorus (27% DV) (table).

=== Health effects ===

According to Health Canada and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, consuming at least per day of rye beta-glucan or per serving of soluble fiber can lower levels of blood cholesterol, a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases.

Eating whole-grain rye, as well as other high-fibre grains, improves regulation of blood sugar (i.e., reduces blood glucose response to a meal). Consuming breakfast cereals containing rye over weeks to months also improved cholesterol levels and glucose regulation.

=== Health concerns ===

Like wheat, barley, and their hybrids and derivatives, rye contains glutens and related prolamines, which makes it an unsuitable grain for consumption by people with gluten-related disorders, such as celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, and wheat allergy, among others. Nevertheless, some wheat allergy patients can tolerate rye or barley.

== Uses ==

=== Food and drink ===

Rye grain is refined into a flour high in gliadin but low in glutenin and rich in soluble fiber. Alkylresorcinols are phenolic lipids present in high amounts in the bran layer (e.g. pericarp, testa and aleurone layers) of wheat and rye (0.1–0.3% of dry weight). Rye bread, including pumpernickel, is made using rye flour and is a widely eaten food in Northern and Eastern Europe. In Scandinavia, rye is widely used to make crispbread (); in the Middle Ages it was a staple food in the region, and it remains popular in the 21st century.

Rye grain is used to make alcoholic drinks, such as rye whiskey and rye beer. The traditional cloudy and sweet-sour low-alcohol beverage kvass is fermented from rye bread or rye flour and malt.

=== Other uses ===

Rye is a useful forage crop in cool climates; it grows vigorously and provides plentiful fodder for grazing animals, or green manure to improve the soil. It forms a good cover crop in winter with its rapid growth and deep roots.

Rye straw is used as livestock bedding, despite the risk of ergot poisoning. It is used on a small scale to make crafts such as corn dollies. More recently it has found uses as a raw material for bioconversion to products such as the sweetener xylitol.

Rye flour is boiled with red iron oxide pigments and some additives to make traditional Falun red paint, widely used as a house paint in Sweden and other Scandinavian countries.

=== Production of hybrids ===

Plant breeders, starting in the 19th century in Germany and Scotland, but mainly from the 1950s, worked to develop a hybrid cereal with the best qualities of wheat and rye, now called triticale. Modern triticales are hexaploid with six sets of chromosomes; they are used to produce millions of tons of cereal annually.

Varieties of rye hold much genetic diversity, which can be used to improve other crops such as wheat. For example, the pollination abilities of wheat can be improved by the addition of the rye chromosome 4R; this increases the size of the wheat anther and the amount of pollen. The chromosome is the source of many crop disease resistance genes. Varieties such as Petkus, Insave, Amigo, and Imperial have donated 1R-originating resistance to wheat. AC Hazlet rye is a medium-sized winter rye with resistance to both lodging and shattering. Rye was the gene donor of &quot;Sr31&quot; – a stem rust resistance gene – introgressed into wheat.

The characteristics of &quot;S. cereale&quot; have been combined with another perennial rye, &quot;S. montanum&quot;, to produce &quot;S. cereanum&quot;, which has the beneficial characteristics of each. The hybrid rye can be grown in harsh environments and on poor soil. It provides improved forage with digestible fiber and protein.

== In human culture ==

In European folklore, the &quot;Roggenwolf&quot; (&quot;rye wolf&quot;) is a carnivorous corn demon or &quot;Feldgeist&quot;, a field spirit shaped like a wolf. The &quot;Roggenwolf&quot; steals children and feeds on them. The last grain heads are often left at their place as a sacrifice for the agricultural spirits. 

In contrast, the &quot;Roggenmuhme&quot; or &quot;Roggenmutter&quot; (&quot;rye aunt&quot; or &quot;rye mother&quot;) is an anthropomorphic female corn demon with fiery fingers. Her bosoms are filled with tar and may end in tips of iron. Her bosoms are also long, and as such must be thrown over her shoulders when she runs. The &quot;Roggenmuhme&quot; is completely black or white, and in her hand she has a birch or whip from which lightning sparks. She can change herself into different animals, such as snakes, turtles, and frogs.

The classical scholar Carl A. P. Ruck writes that the &quot;Roggenmutter&quot; was believed to go through the fields, rustling like the wind, with a pack of rye wolves running after her. They spread ergot through the sheaves of harvested rye. According to Ruck, they then lured children into the fields to nurse on the infected grains &quot;like the iron teats of the &quot;Roggenmutter&quot;&quot;. The enlarged reddish ergot-infected grains were known as &quot;Wulfzähne&quot; (wolf teeth).&#x27;

<text>The turnip or white turnip (&quot;Brassica rapa&quot; subsp. &quot;rapa&quot;) is a root vegetable commonly grown in temperate climates worldwide for its white, fleshy taproot. Small, tender varieties are grown for human consumption, while larger varieties are grown as feed for livestock. The name &quot;turnip&quot; used in many regions may also be used to refer to rutabaga (or &quot;neep&quot; or &quot;swede&quot;), which is a different but related vegetable.

== Etymology ==
The origin of the word &quot;turnip&quot; is uncertain, though it is hypothesised that it could be a compound of &quot;turn&quot; as in turned/rounded on a lathe and &quot;neep&quot;, derived from Latin &quot;napus&quot;, the word for the plant. According to An Universal Etymological English Dictionary, &quot;turn&quot; refers to &quot;round &quot;napus&quot; to distinguish it from the napi, which were generally long&quot;.

== Description ==

The most common type of turnip is mostly white-skinned, apart from the upper , which protrude above the ground and are purple or red or greenish where the sun has hit. This above-ground part develops from stem tissue but is fused with the root. The interior flesh is entirely white. The root is roughly globular, from in diameter, and lacks side roots. Underneath, the taproot (the normal root below the swollen storage root) is thin and or more in length; it is often trimmed off before the vegetable is sold. The leaves grow directly from the above-ground shoulder of the root, with little or no visible crown or neck (as found in rutabagas).

Turnip leaves are sometimes eaten as &quot;turnip greens&quot; (&quot;turnip tops&quot; in the UK), and they resemble mustard greens (to which they are closely related) in flavor. Turnip greens are a common side dish in southeastern U.S. cooking, primarily during late fall and winter. Smaller leaves are preferred. Varieties of turnip grown specifically for their leaves resemble mustard greens and have small roots. These include rapini (broccoli rabe), bok choy, and Chinese cabbage. Similar to raw cabbage or radish, turnip leaves and roots have a pungent flavor that becomes milder after cooking.

Turnip roots weigh up to , although they are usually harvested when smaller. Size is partly a function of variety and partly a function of the length of time a turnip has grown.

== Nutrition ==
Boiled green leaves of the turnip top (&quot;turnip greens&quot;) provide of food energy in a reference serving of , and are 93% water, 4% carbohydrates, and 1% protein, with negligible fat (table). The boiled greens are a rich source (more than 20% of the Daily Value, DV) particularly of vitamin K (350% DV), with vitamin A, vitamin C, and folate also in significant content (30% DV or greater, table). Boiled turnip greens also contain substantial lutein (8440 micrograms per 100 g).

In a 100-gram reference amount, boiled turnip root supplies , with only vitamin C in a moderate amount (14% DV). Other micronutrients in boiled turnip are in low or negligible content (table). Boiled turnip is 94% water, 5% carbohydrates, and 1% protein, with negligible fat.

== History == 
Wild forms of the turnip and its relatives, the mustards and radishes, are found over western Asia and Europe. Starting as early as 2000 BCE, related oilseed subspecies of &quot;Brassica rapa&quot; like &quot;oleifera&quot; may have been domesticated several times from the Mediterranean to India, though these are not the same turnips cultivated for their roots. Previous estimates of domestication dates are limited to linguistic analyses of plant names.

Edible turnips were first domesticated in Central Asia several thousand years ago, supported by genetic studies of both wild and domesticated varieties showing Central Asian varieties are the most genetically diverse crops. Ancient literary references to turnips in Central Asia, and the existence of words for &#x27;turnip&#x27; in ancestral languages of the region, also support the turnip as the original domesticated form of &quot;Brassica rapa&quot; subsp. &quot;rapa&quot;. It later spread to Europe and East Asia with farmers in both areas later selecting for larger leaves; it subsequently became an important food in the Hellenistic and Roman world. The turnip spread to China, and reached Japan by 700 CE.

Turnips were an important crop in the cuisine of Antebellum America. They were grown for their greens as well as the roots, and could yield edible greens within a few weeks of planting, making them a staple of new plantations still in the process of becoming productive. They could be planted as late as the fall and still provide newly arrived settlers with a source of food. The typical southern way of cooking turnip greens was to boil them with a chunk of salt pork. The broth obtained from this process was known as pot likker and was served with crumbled corn pone, often made from coarse meal when little else was available along the antebellum frontier.

== Cultivation ==

The 1881 American &quot;Household Cyclopedia&quot; advises that turnips can be grown in fields that have been harrowed and ploughed. It recommends planting in late May or June and weeding and thinning with a hoe throughout the summer.

As a root crop, turnips grow best in cool weather; hot temperatures cause the roots to become woody and bad-tasting. They are typically planted in the spring in cold-weather climates (such as the northern US and Canada) where the growing season is only 3–4 months. In temperate climates (ones with a growing season of 5–6 months), turnips may also be planted in late summer for a second fall crop. In warm-weather climates (7 or more month growing season), they are planted in the fall. 55–60 days is the average time from planting to harvest.

Turnips are a biennial plant, taking two years from germination to reproduction. The root spends the first year growing and storing nutrients, and the second year flowers, produces seeds, and dies. The flowers of the turnip are tall and yellow, with the seeds forming in pea-like pods. In areas with less than seven-month growing seasons, temperatures are too cold for the roots to survive the winter. To produce seeds, pulling the turnips and storing them over winter is necessary, taking care not to damage the leaves. During the spring, they may be set back in the ground to complete their lifecycle.

== Relevance in human use ==
In England around 1700, Charles &quot;Turnip&quot; Townshend promoted the use of turnips in a four-year crop-rotation system that enabled year-round livestock feeding.

In Scottish and some other English dialects, the word &quot;turnip&quot; can also refer to rutabagas (North American English), also known as swedes in England, a variety of &quot;Brassica napus&quot;, which is a hybrid between the turnip, &quot;Brassica rapa&quot;, and the cabbage. Turnips are generally smaller with white flesh, while rutabagas are larger with yellow flesh. Scottish English sometimes distinguishes turnips as &quot;white turnips&quot;, and sometimes distinguishes rutabagas as &quot;neeps&quot;.

In the Austrian region of Wildschönau, farmers produce a kind of schnaps called Krautinger from a variation of Brassica rapa ssp. Rapa, since they were granted permission to do so under Empress Maria Theresia in the 18th century. It is notorious for its distinct taste and smell.

== Heraldry ==

The turnip is an old vegetable charge in heraldry. It was used by Leonhard von Keutschach, prince-archbishop of Salzburg. The turnip is still the heart shield in the arms of Keutschach am See.

The arms of the former municipality of Kiikala, Finland, were &quot;Gules, a turnip Or&quot;.

<text>A hedgehog is a spiny mammal of the subfamily Erinaceinae, in the eulipotyphlan family Erinaceidae. There are 17 species of hedgehog in five genera found throughout parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa, and in New Zealand by introduction. There are no hedgehogs native to Australia and no living species native to the Americas. However, the extinct genus &quot;Amphechinus&quot; was once present in North America.

Hedgehogs share distant ancestry with shrews (family Soricidae), with gymnures possibly being the intermediate link, and they have changed little over the last 15 million years. Like many of the first mammals, they have adapted to a nocturnal way of life. Their spiny protection resembles that of porcupines, which are rodents, and echidnas, a type of monotreme.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;hedgehog&quot; came into use around the year 1450, derived from the Middle English , from , , because it frequents hedgerows, and , , from its piglike snout. Other names that are used are &quot;urchin&quot; and &quot;hedgepig&quot;.

==Description==
Hedgehogs are easily recognized by their spines, which are hollow hairs made stiff with keratin. Their spines are not poisonous or ed and, unlike the quills of a porcupine, do not easily detach from their bodies. However, the immature animal&#x27;s spines normally fall out as they are replaced with adult spines. This is called &quot;quilling&quot;. Spines can also shed when the animal is diseased or under extreme stress. Hedgehogs are usually brown, with pale tips to the spines, though blonde hedgehogs are found on the Channel Island of Alderney.


Hedgehogs roll into a tight spiny ball when threatened, tucking in the furry face, feet, and belly. The hedgehog&#x27;s back contains two large muscles that direct the quills. Some light-weight desert hedgehog species with fewer spines are more likely to flee or attack, ramming an intruder with the spines, rolling up only as a last resort.

Hedgehogs are primarily nocturnal, with some species also active during the day. Hedgehogs sleep for a large portion of the day under bushes, grasses, rocks, or most commonly in dens dug underground. All wild hedgehogs can hibernate, though the duration depends on temperature, species, and abundance of food.

Hedgehogs are fairly vocal, with a variety of grunts, snuffles and/or squeals.

They occasionally perform a ritual called anointing. When the animal encounters a new scent, it will lick and bite the source, then form a scented froth in its mouth and paste it on its spines with its tongue. Some experts believe this might serve to camouflage the hedgehog with the local scent, and might also lead to infection of predators poked by the spines. Anointing is sometimes also called anting after a similar behavior in birds.

Like opossums, mice, and moles, hedgehogs have some natural immunity against some snake venom through the protein erinacin in their muscles, though in such small amounts that a viper bite may still be fatal. In addition, hedgehogs are one of four known mammalian groups with natural protection against another snake venom, α-neurotoxin. Developing independently, pigs, honey badgers, mongooses, and hedgehogs all have mutations in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor that prevent the binding of the snake venom α-neurotoxin.

The sense of smell has been little studied in the hedgehog, as the olfactory part of the mammal brain is obscured inside the neopallium. Tests have suggested that hedgehogs share the same olfactory electrical activity as cats.

==Diet==
Although traditionally classified in the abandoned order Insectivora, hedgehogs are omnivorous. They feed on insects, snails, frogs and toads, snakes, bird eggs, carrion, mushrooms, grass roots, berries, and melons. Afghan hedgehogs devour berries in early spring after hibernation.
Hedgehogs have been observed eating cat food left outdoors for pets, but this may not be a proper food for hedgehogs in captivity.[video:1]

==Hibernation==
When a hedgehog hibernates, its normal body temperature decreases to .

==Reproduction and lifespan==
Hedgehog gestation lasts 35–58 days, depending on species. The average litter is three to four newborns for larger species and five to six for smaller ones. As with many animals, it is not unusual for an adult male hedgehog to kill newborn males.

Hedgehogs have a relatively long lifespan for their size. In captivity, lack of predators and controlled diet contribute to a lifespan of eight to ten years depending on size. In the wild, larger species live four to seven years (some recorded up to 16 years), and smaller species live two to four years (four to seven in captivity). This compares to a mouse at two years and a large rat at three to five years.

Newborn hoglets are blind, with their quills covered by a protective membrane which dries and shrinks over several hours, and falls off after cleaning, allowing the quills to emerge.

==Predators==
The various species have many predators: while forest hedgehogs are prey primarily to birds (especially owls) and ferrets, smaller species like the long-eared hedgehog are prey to foxes, wolves, and mongooses. Hedgehog bones have been found in the pellets of the Eurasian eagle owl.

In Britain, the main predator is the European badger. European hedgehog populations in the United Kingdom are lower in areas with many badgers, and hedgehog rescue societies will not release hedgehogs into known badger territories. Badgers also compete with hedgehogs for food.

==Domestication==
The most common pet species of hedgehog are hybrids of the white-bellied hedgehog or four-toed hedgehog (&quot;Atelerix albiventris&quot;, sometimes known as the African pygmy hedgehog) and the smaller North African hedgehog (&quot;A. algirus&quot;, pygmy hedgehog). Other species kept as pets are the long-eared hedgehog (&quot;Hemiechinus auritus&quot;) and the Indian long-eared hedgehog (&quot;H. collaris&quot;).

, it is illegal to own a hedgehog as a pet in the US states of Hawaii, Georgia, Pennsylvania, and California, as well as in New York City, Washington, D.C. and some Canadian municipalities. Breeding licenses are required. No such restrictions exist in most European countries with the exception of Scandinavia. In Italy, it is illegal to keep wild hedgehogs as pets.

==As invasive species==
In areas where hedgehogs have been introduced, such as New Zealand and the islands of Scotland, the hedgehog has become a pest, lacking natural predators. In New Zealand it has decimated native species including insects, snails, lizards and ground-nesting birds, particularly shore birds.

Eradication can be troublesome. Attempts to eliminate hedgehogs from bird colonies on the Scottish islands of North Uist and Benbecula in the Outer Hebrides were met with international protest. Eradication began in 2003 with 690 hedgehogs killed, though animal welfare groups attempted rescues. By 2007, legal injunctions prohibited the killing, and in 2008, the elimination process was changed to trapping and releasing on the mainland.

In 2022, it was reported that the hedgehog population in rural Britain was declining rapidly, down by 30%-75% since 2000.

==Diseases==
Hedgehogs suffer many diseases common to mammals, including cancer, fatty liver disease, and cardiovascular disease.

Cancer is very common in hedgehogs. The most common is squamous cell carcinoma, which spreads quickly from bone to the organs, unlike in humans. Surgery to remove the bone tumors is impractical.

Fatty liver and heart disease are believed to be caused by bad diet and obesity. Hedgehogs will eagerly eat foods high in fat and sugar, despite a metabolism adapted for low-fat, protein-rich insects.

Hedgehogs are also highly susceptible to pneumonia, with difficulty breathing and nasal discharge, caused by the bacterium &quot;Bordetella bronchiseptica&quot;.

Hedgehogs uncommonly transmit a fungal ringworm or dermatophytosis skin infection to human handlers and other hedgehogs, caused by &quot;Trichophyton erinacei&quot;, a distinct mating group among the &quot;Arthroderma benhamiae&quot; fungi.
Hedgehogs can suffer from balloon syndrome, a rare condition in which gas is trapped under the skin from injury or infection, causing the animal to inflate. The condition is unique to hedgehogs because their skin is baggy enough to curl up. In 2017, the BBC reported a case of a male hedgehog &quot;almost twice its natural size, literally blown up like a beach ball with incredibly taut skin&quot;. At Stapeley&#x27;s Wildlife Hospital, vet Bev Panto, said, &quot;I have seen three or four of these cases and they are very strange every time and quite shocking ... When you first see them they appear to be very big hedgehogs but when you pick them up they feel so light because they are mostly air&quot;. The British Hedgehog Preservation Society advises:
There is no single cause for this condition. The air can be removed by incising or aspirating through the skin over the back. Antibiotic cover should be given. This may be associated with lung/chest wall damage or a small external wound acting like a valve or a clostridium type infection.

==Human influence==
As with most small mammals living around humans, many are run over as they attempt to cross roadways. In Ireland, hedgehogs are one of the most common mammalian road fatalities. Between April 2008 and November 2010 on two stretches of road measuring 227 km and 32.5 km, there were 133 recorded hedgehog fatalities. Of another 135 hedgehog carcasses collected from throughout Ireland, there were significantly more males than females collected, with peaks in male deaths occurring in May and June. Female deaths outnumbered males only in August, with further peaks in female deaths observed in June and July. It is suggested that these peaks are related to the breeding season (adults) and dispersal/exploration following independence.

Domesticated hedgehogs can get their heads stuck in tubes such as toilet paper tubes, and walk around with them. Some owners call this &quot;tubing&quot; and promote the behavior, providing a tube cut lengthwise to allow the hedgehog to remove it. Some hedgehogs intentionally wear tubes for hours.

==Culinary and medicinal use==
Hedgehogs are a food source in many cultures. They were eaten in Ancient Egypt and some recipes of the Late Middle Ages call for hedgehog meat. They are traded throughout Eurasia and Africa for traditional medicine and witchcraft. In the Middle East and especially among Bedouins, hedgehog meat is considered medicine against rheumatism and arthritis. Hedgehogs are also said to cure a variety of disorders from tuberculosis to impotence. In Morocco, inhaling the smoke of the burnt skin or bristles supposedly remedies fever, impotence, and urinary illnesses; the blood is sold as a cure for ringworm, cracked skin and warts, and the flesh is eaten as a remedy for witchcraft. Romani people still eat hedgehogs, boiled or roasted, and also use the blood and the fat as a medicine.

In 1981, British publican Philip Lewis developed a line of Hedgehog Flavoured Crisps, whose taste was apparently based on the flavourings used by Romani to bake hedgehogs. As they did not contain any actual hedgehog product, the Office of Fair Trading ordered him to change the name to Hedgehog Flavour Crisps.
