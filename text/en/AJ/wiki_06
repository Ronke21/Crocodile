<text>Amman ( , ; , ) is the capital and the largest city of Jordan, and the country&#x27;s economic, political, and cultural center. With a population of four million as of 2021, Amman is Jordan&#x27;s primate city and is the largest city in the Levant region, the fifth-largest city in the Arab world, and the tenth-largest metropolitan area in the Middle East.

The earliest evidence of settlement in Amman dates to the 8th millennium BC in &#x27;Ain Ghazal, home to the world&#x27;s oldest statues of the human form. During the Iron Age, the city was known as &quot;Rabat Aman&quot;, the capital of the Ammonite Kingdom. In the 3rd century BC, the city was renamed &quot;Philadelphia&quot; and became one of the ten Greco-Roman cities of the Decapolis. Later, in the 7th century AD, the Rashidun Caliphate renamed the city Amman. Throughout most of the Islamic era, the city alternated between periods of devastation and periods of relative prosperity. Amman was largely abandoned during the Ottoman period from the 15th century until 1878, when it was resettled by Circassians. The city grew after it was connected to the Hejaz Railway in 1904, leading to the formation of its first municipal council in 1909. 

Amman witnessed rapid growth after its designation as Transjordan&#x27;s capital in 1921, receiving migrations from different Jordanian and Levantine cities, and later several successive waves of refugees: Palestinians in 1948 and 1967; Iraqis in 1990 and 2003; and Syrians since 2011. It was initially built on seven hills, but now spans over 19 hills combining 22 areas, which are administered by the Greater Amman Municipality. Areas of Amman have gained their names from either the hills (&quot;jabal&quot;) or the valleys (&quot;wadi&quot;) they occupy, such as Jabal al-Luweibdeh and Wadi Abdoun. East Amman is predominantly filled with historic sites that frequently host cultural activities, while West Amman is more modern and serves as the economic center of the city.

Approximately one million visitors arrived in Amman in 2018, which made it the 89th most-visited city in the world and the 12th most-visited Arab city. Amman has a relatively fast growing economy and it is ranked as a Beta‚àí global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. Moreover, it was named one of the Middle East and North Africa&#x27;s best cities according to economic, labor, environmental, and socio-cultural factors. The city is among the most popular locations in the Arab world for multinational corporations to set up their regional offices, alongside Doha and only behind Dubai. Amman has a bus network, including a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system that serves the city and connects it to neighboring Zarqa.

==Etymology==
Amman derives its name from the ancient people of the Ammonites, whose capital the city had been since the 13th century BC. The Ammonites named it &quot;Rabat  øAmmƒÅn&quot; (ê§ìê§Åê§ï ê§èê§åê§ç), with the term &quot;Rabat&quot; meaning the &quot;Capital&quot; or the &quot;King&#x27;s Quarters&quot;. In the Hebrew Bible, the town is referred to as () or simply (), and it appears in English translations as &quot;Rabbath Ammon&quot;. Ptolemy II Philadelphus, the Macedonian ruler of the Ptolemaic Kingdom who reigned from 283 to 246 BC, renamed the city &quot;Philadelphia&quot; (; literally: &quot;brotherly love&quot;), after himself, after occupying it. By the Islamic era, the Rashidun Caliphate restored its ancient semitic name and called it Amman in the 7th century AD.

==History==
===Neolithic period===

The Neolithic site of  øAin Ghazal today lies in the outskirts of Amman. At its height, around 7000 BC (9000 years ago), it had an area of and was inhabited by ca. 3000 people (four to five times the population of contemporary Jericho). At that time, the site was a typical aceramic Neolithic village. Its houses were rectangular mud-bricked buildings that included a main square living room, whose walls were made up of lime plaster. The site was discovered in 1974 as construction workers were working on a road crossing the area. By 1982, when the excavations started, around of road ran through the site. Despite the damage brought by urban expansion, the remains of  øAin Ghazal provided a wealth of information.

 øAin Ghazal is well known for a set of small human statues found in 1983, when local archeologists stumbled upon the edge of a large pit containing them. These statues are human figures made with white plaster, with painted eyes. Thirty-two figures were found in two caches, fifteen of them full figures, fifteen busts, and two fragmentary heads. Three of the busts depicted two-headed characters, the significance of which is not clear.

===Iron Age: the Ammonites===

In the 13th century BC, Amman was the capital of the Ammonite Kingdom, and became known as &quot;Rabat Amman&quot;. Rabat Amman provided several natural resources to the region, including sandstone and limestone, along with a productive agricultural sector that made it a vital location along the King&#x27;s Highway, the ancient trade route connecting Egypt with Mesopotamia, Syria and Anatolia. As with the Edomites and Moabites, trade along this route gave the Ammonites considerable revenue. Milcom is named in the Hebrew Bible as the national god of Rabat Amman. Another ancient deity, Moloch, usually associated with the use of children as offerings, is also mentioned in the Bible as a god of the Ammonites, but this is probably a mistake for Milcom. However, excavations by archeologists near Amman Civil Airport uncovered a temple, which included an altar containing many human bone fragments. The bones showed evidence of burning, which led to the assumption that the altar functioned as a pyre and used for human sacrifice.

Amman is mentioned several times in the Hebrew Bible. According to the biblical narrative, the Ammonite king Hanun allied with Hadadezer, king of Aram-Zobah, against the United Kingdom of Israel. During the war, Joab, the captain of King David&#x27;s army, laid siege to Rabbah, Hanun&#x27;s royal capital, and destroyed it (, ). David took a great quantity of plunder from the city, including the king&#x27;s crown, and brought it to his capital, Jerusalem (). Hanun&#x27;s brother, Shobi, was made king in his place, and became a loyal vassal of David (). Hundreds of years later, the prophet Jeremiah foresaw the coming destruction and final desolation of the city ().

Several Ammonite ruins across Amman exist, such as Rujm Al-Malfouf and some parts of the Amman Citadel. The ruins of Rujm Al-Malfouf consist of a stone watchtower used to ensure the protection of their capital and several store rooms to the east. The city was later conquered by the Assyrians, followed by the Babylonians and the Achaemenid Persians.

===Classical period ===
Conquest of the Middle East and Central Asia by Alexander the Great firmly consolidated the influence of Hellenistic culture. The Greeks founded new cities in the area of modern-day Jordan, including Umm Qays, Jerash and Amman. Ptolemy II Philadelphus, the Macedonian ruler of Egypt, who occupied and rebuilt the city, named it &quot;Philadelphia&quot; (), evoking &quot;brotherly love&quot; in Greek. The name was given as an adulation to his own nickname, Philadelphus.

One of the most original monuments in Jordan, and perhaps in the Hellenistic period in the Near East, is the village of Iraq al-Amir in the valley of Wadi Al-Seer, southwest of Amman, which is home to Qasr al-Abd (&#x27;Castle of the Slave&#x27;). Other nearby ruins include a village, an isolated house and a fountain, all of which are barely visible today due to the damage brought by a major earthquake that hit the region in the year 362. Qasr al-Abd is believed to have been built by Hyrcanus of Jerusalem, who was the head of the powerful Jewish Tobiad family. Shortly after he began the construction of that large building, in -168 BC, upon returning from a military campaign in Egypt, Antiochus IV conquered Jerusalem, ransacked the Second Temple where the treasure of Hyrcanus was kept, and appeared determined to attack Hyrcanus. Upon hearing this, Hyrcanus committed suicide, leaving his palace in Philadelphia uncompleted. The Tobiads fought the Arab Nabateans for twenty years until they lost the city to them. After losing Philadelphia, the Tobiad family disappears from written sources.

The Romans conquered much of the Levant in 63 BC, inaugurating a period of Roman rule that lasted for four centuries. In the northern modern-day Jordan, the Greek cities of Philadelphia (Amman), Gerasa, Gedara, Pella and Arbila joined with other cities in Palestine and Syria; Scythopolis, Hippos, Capitolias, Canatha and Damascus to form the Decapolis League, a confederation linked by bonds of economic and cultural interest. Philadelphia became a point along a road stretching from Ailah to Damascus that was built by Emperor Trajan in AD 106. This provided an economic boost for the city in a short period of time.

Roman rule in Jordan left several ruins across the country, some of which exist in Amman, such as the Temple of Hercules at the Amman Citadel, the Roman Theatre, the Odeon, and the Nymphaeum. The two theaters and the nymphaeum fountain were built during the reign of Emperor Antoninus Pius around AD 161. The theatre was the larger venue of the two and had a capacity for 6,000 attendees. It was oriented north and built into the hillside, to protect the audience from the sun. To the northeast of the theatre was a small odeon. Built at roughly the same time as the theatre, the Odeon had 500 seats and is still in use today for music concerts. Archaeologists speculate that the structure was originally covered with a wooden roof to shield the audience from the weather. The Nymphaeum is situated southwest of the Odeon and served as Philadelphia&#x27;s chief fountain. The Nymphaeum is believed to have contained a pool which was deep and was continuously refilled with water. During the late Byzantine period in the seventh century, several bishops and churches were based in the city.

===Islamic era (7th‚Äì15th centuries)===
In the 630s, the Rashidun Caliphate conquered the region from the Byzantines, beginning the Islamic era in the Levant. Philadelphia was renamed &quot;Amman&quot; by the Muslims and became part of the district of Jund Dimashq. A large part of the population already spoke Arabic, which facilitated integration into the caliphate, as well as several conversions to Islam. Under the Umayyad caliphs who began their rule in 661 AD, numerous desert castles were established as a means to govern the desert area of modern-day Jordan, several of which are still well-preserved. Amman had already been functioning as an administrative centre. The Umayyads built a large palace on the Amman Citadel hill, known today as the Umayyad Palace. Amman was later destroyed by several earthquakes and natural disasters, including a particularly severe earthquake in 747. The Umayyads were overthrown by the Abbasids three years later.

Amman&#x27;s importance declined by the mid-8th century after damage caused by several earthquakes rendered it uninhabitable. Excavations among the collapsed layer of the Umayyad Palace have revealed remains of kilns from the time of the Abbasids (750‚Äì969) and the Fatimids (969‚Äì1099). In the late 9th century, Amman was noted as the &quot;capital&quot; of the Balqa by geographer al-Yaqubi. Likewise, in 985, the Jerusalemite historian al-Muqaddasi described Amman as the capital of Balqa, and that it was a town in the desert fringe of Syria surrounded by villages and cornfields and was a regional source of lambs, grain and honey. Its inhabitants he reports, at the time, were Shia Muslims. Furthermore, al-Muqaddasi describes Amman as a &quot;harbor of the desert&quot; where Arab Bedouin would take refuge, and that its citadel, which overlooked the town, contained a small mosque.

The occupation of the Citadel Hill by the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem is so far based only on interpretations of Crusader sources. William of Tyre writes in his &quot;Historia&quot; that in 1161 Philip of Milly received the castle of Ahamant, which is seen to refer to Amman, as part of the lordship of Oultrejordain. In 1166 Philip joined the military order of the Knights Templar, passing on to them a significant part of his fief including the castle of Ahamant or &quot;Haman&quot;, as it is named in the deed of confirmation issued by King Amalric. By 1170, Amman was in Ayyubid hands. The remains of a watch tower on Citadel Hill, first attributed to the Crusaders, now are preferentially dated to the Ayyubid period, leaving it to further research to find the location of the Crusader castle. During the Ayyubid period, the Damascene geographer al-Dimashqi wrote that Amman was part of the province of al-Karak, although &quot;only ruins&quot; remained of the town.

During the Mamluk era (late 13th‚Äìearly 16th centuries), the region of Amman was a part of Wilayat Balqa, the southernmost district of Mamlakat Dimashq (Damascus Province). The capital of the district in the first half of the 14th century was the minor administrative post of Hisban, which had a considerably smaller garrison than the other administrative centers in Transjordan, namely Ajlun and al-Karak. In 1321, the geographer Abu&#x27;l Fida, recorded that Amman was &quot;a very ancient town&quot; with fertile soil and surrounded by agricultural fields. For unclear, though likely financial reasons, in 1356, the capital of Balqa was transferred from Hisban to Amman, which was considered a &quot;madina&quot; (city). In 1357, Emir Sirghitmish bought Amman in its entirety, most likely to use revenues from the city to help fund the Madrasa of Sirghitmish, which he built in Cairo that same year. After his purchase of the city, Sirghitmish transferred the courts, administrative bureaucracy, markets and most of the inhabitants of Hisban to Amman. Moreover, he financed new building works in the city.

Ownership of Amman following Sirghitmish&#x27;s death in 1358 passed to successive generations of his descendants until 1395, when his descendants sold it to Emir Baydamur al-Khwarazmi, the &quot;na&#x27;ib as-saltana&quot; (viceroy) of Damascus. Afterward, part of Amman&#x27;s cultivable lands were sold to Emir Sudun al-Shaykhuni (died 1396), the &quot;na&#x27;ib as-saltana&quot; of Egypt. The increasingly frequent division and sale of the city and lands of Amman to different owners signalled declining revenues coming from Amman, while at the same time, Hisban was restored as the major city of the Balqa in the 15th century. From then until 1878, Amman was an abandoned site periodically used to shelter seasonal farmers who cultivated arable lands in its vicinity and by Bedouin tribes who used its pastures and water. The Ottoman Empire annexed the region of Amman in 1516, but for much of the Ottoman period, al-Salt functioned as the virtual political center of Transjordan.

===Modern era (1878‚Äìpresent)===
Amman began to be resettled in 1878, when several hundred Muslim Circassians arrived following their expulsion from the North Caucasus by the Russian Empire during the events of the Russo-Circassian War. Between 1878 and 1910, tens of thousands of Circassians became refugees in the Ottoman Empire, which had moved large numbers of them into its province of Syria. The Ottoman authorities directed the Circassians, who were mainly of peasant stock, to settle in Amman, and distributed arable land among them. Their settlement was a partial manifestation of the Ottoman statesman Kamil Pasha&#x27;s project, which did not materialize, to establish the Amman Province (vilayet) which, along with other sites in its vicinity, would become Circassian-populated townships guaranteeing the security of the Damascus‚ÄìMedina highway. The first Circassian settlers, who belonged to the Shapsug tribe, lived near Amman&#x27;s Roman theater and incorporated its stones into the houses they built. The English traveller Laurence Oliphant noted in his 1879 visit that most of the original Circassian settlers had left Amman by then, with about 150 remaining. They were joined by Circassians from the Kabardian and Abzakh tribes in 1880‚Äì1892.

Until 1900 settlement was concentrated in the valley and slopes of the Amman stream and settlers built mud-brick houses with wooden roofs. The French Dominican priest Marie-Joseph Lagrange commented in 1890 about Amman: &quot;A mosque, the ancient bridges, all that jumbled with the houses of the Circassians gives Amman a remarkable physiognomy&quot;. The new village became a &quot;nahiye&quot; (subdistrict) center of the &quot;kaza&quot; of al-Salt in the Karak Sanjak established in 1894. By 1908 Amman contained 800 houses divided between three main quarters, Shapsug, Kabartai and Abzakh, each called after the Circassian groupings which respectively settled there, a number of mosques, open-air markets, shops, bakeries, mills, a textile factory, a post and telegraph office and a government compound (saraya). Kurdish settlers formed their own quarter called &quot;al-Akrad&quot; after them, while a number of townspeople from nearby al-Salt and al-Fuheis, seeking to avoid high taxes and conscription or attracted by financial incentives, and traders from Najd and Morocco, had also moved to the town.

The city&#x27;s demographics changed dramatically after the Ottoman government&#x27;s decision to construct the Hejaz Railway, which linked Damascus and Medina, and facilitated the annual Hajj pilgrimage and trade. Operational in central Transjordan since 1903, the Hejaz Railway helped to transform Amman from a small village into a major commercial hub in the region. Circassian entrepreneurship, facilitated by the railway, helped to attract investment from merchants from Damascus, Nablus, and Jerusalem, many of whom moved to Amman in the 1900s and 1910s. Amman&#x27;s first municipal council was established in 1909, and Circassian Ismael Babouk was elected as its mayor.

The First and Second Battle of Amman were part of the Middle Eastern theatre of World War I and the Arab Revolt, taking place in 1918. Amman had a strategic location along the Hejaz Railway; its capture by British forces and the Hashemite Arab army facilitated the British advance towards Damascus. The second battle was won by the British, resulting in the establishment of the British Mandate.

In 1921, the Hashemite emir and later king Abdullah I designated Amman instead of al-Salt to be the capital of the newly created state, the Emirate of Transjordan, which became the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in 1950. Its function as the capital of the country attracted immigrants from different Levantine areas, particularly from al-Salt, a nearby city that had been the largest urban settlement east of the Jordan River at the time. The early settlers who came from Palestine were overwhelmingly from Nablus, from which many of al-Salt&#x27;s inhabitants had originated. They were joined by other immigrants from Damascus. Amman later attracted people from the southern part of the country, particularly al-Karak and Madaba. The city&#x27;s population was around 10,000 in the 1930s.

The British report from 1933 shows around 1,700 Circassians living in Amman. Yet the community was far from insulated. Local urban and nomadic communities formed alliances with the Circassians, some of which are still present today. This cemented the status of Circassians in the re-established city.


Jordan gained its independence in 1946 and Amman was designated the country&#x27;s capital. Amman received many refugees during wartime events in nearby countries, beginning with the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. A second wave arrived after the Six-Day War in 1967. In 1970, Amman was a battlefield during the conflict between the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the Jordanian Army known as Black September. The Jordanian Army defeated the PLO in 1971, and the latter were expelled to Lebanon. The first wave of Iraqi refugees settled in the city after the 1991 Gulf War, with a second wave occurring in the aftermath of the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

On 9 November 2005, Al-Qaeda under Abu Musab al-Zarqawi&#x27;s leadership launched coordinated explosions in three hotel lobbies in Amman, resulting in 60 deaths and 115 injured. The bombings, which targeted civilians, caused widespread outrage among Jordanians. Jordan&#x27;s security as a whole was dramatically improved after the attack, and no major terrorist attacks have been reported since then. Most recently a wave of Syrian refugees have arrived in the city during the ongoing Syrian Civil War which began in 2011. Amman was a principal destination for refugees for the security and prosperity it offered.

During the 2010s, the city has experienced an economic, cultural and urban boom. The large growth in population has significantly increased the need for new accommodation, and new districts of the city were established at a quick pace. This strained Jordan&#x27;s scarce water supply and exposed Amman to the dangers of quick expansion without careful municipal planning.

==Geography==
Amman is situated on the East Bank Plateau, an upland characterized by three major wadis which run through it. Originally, the city had been built on seven hills. Amman&#x27;s terrain is typified by its mountains. The most important areas in the city are named after the hills or mountains they lie on. The area&#x27;s elevation ranges from . Al-Salt and al-Zarqa are located to the northwest and northeast, respectively, Madaba is located to the west, and al-Karak and Ma&#x27;an are to Amman&#x27;s southwest and southeast, respectively. One of the only remaining springs in Amman now supplies the Zarqa River with water. Trees found in Amman include Aleppo pine, Mediterranean cypress and Phoenician juniper.

=== Climate ===
Amman features a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K√∂ppen: Csa) in its western and northern neighborhoods, while its eastern and southern neighborhoods experience a semi-arid climate (K√∂ppen: BSh/BSk).

The summer season in Amman is moderately long, characterized by mild heat and refreshing breezes. However, occasional heatwaves may occur during this period. Spring is brief yet warm, with temperatures reaching highs of 28¬†¬∞C (82¬†¬∞F). This season typically commences between April and May, lasting for about a month. Winter usually sets in around the end of November, extending through early to mid-March. During winter, temperatures typically hover around or below 17¬†¬∞C (63¬†¬∞F), with sporadic snowfall occurring once or twice a year.

The average annual rainfall in Amman is around 385¬†mm (15¬†in), with great variations between different parts of the city. The western areas receive more than 500¬†mm (20¬†in) of rainfall, whereas the eastern areas receive less than 250¬†mm (10¬†in). Rainfall primarily occurs between November and April, and periodic droughts are not uncommon.

Amman experiences heavy fog on about 120 days each year. The city&#x27;s diverse weather conditions are heavily influenced by differences in elevation. While snow might accumulate in the higher-altitude western and northern regions of Amman (with an average altitude of 1,000 m or 3,300¬†ft above sea level), the city center (at an elevation of 700 m or 2,300¬†ft) might experience rainfall simultaneously. This variation in elevation leads to extreme microclimates within Amman, with each district having its own distinct weather patterns.

==Local government==
Amman is governed by a 41-member city council elected in four-year term direct elections. All Jordanian citizens above 18 years old are eligible to vote in the municipal elections. However, the mayor is appointed by the king and not through elections. In 1909 a city council was established in Amman by Circassian Ismael Babouk who became the first-ever mayor of the capital, and in 1914 Amman&#x27;s first city district center was founded.

The Greater Amman Municipality (GAM) has been investing in making the city a better place, through a number of initiatives. Green Amman 2020 was initiated in 2014, aiming to turn the city to a green metropolis by 2020. According to official statistics, only 2.5% of Amman is green space. In 2015 GAM and Zain Jordan started operating free-of-charge Wi-Fi services at 15 locations, including Wakalat Street, Rainbow Street, The Hashemite Plaza, Ashrafieh Cultural Complex, Zaha Cultural Center, Al Hussein Cultural Center, Al Hussein Public Parks and others.

===Administrative divisions===
Jordan is divided into twelve administrative divisions, each called a governorate. Amman Governorate divides into nine districts, five of which are divided into sub-districts. The Greater Amman Municipality has 22 areas which are further divided into neighborhoods.

The city is administered as the Greater Amman Municipality and covers 22 areas which include:


==Economy==
===Banking sector===
The banking sector is one of the principal foundations of Jordan&#x27;s economy. Despite the unrest and economic difficulties in the Arab world resulting from the Arab Spring uprisings, Jordan&#x27;s banking sector maintained its growth in 2014. The sector consists of 25 banks, 15 of which are listed on the Amman Stock Exchange. Amman is the base city for the international Arab Bank, one of the largest financial institutions in the Middle East, serving clients in more than 600 branches in 30 countries on five continents. Arab Bank represents 28% of the Amman Stock Exchange and is the highest-ranked institution by market capitalization on the exchange.

===Tourism===

Amman is the 4th most visited Arab city and the ninth highest recipient of international visitor spending. Roughly 1.8¬†million tourists visited Amman in 2011 and spent over $1.3¬†billion in the city. The expansion of Queen Alia International Airport is an example of the Greater Amman Municipality&#x27;s heavy investment in the city&#x27;s infrastructure. The recent construction of a public transportation system and a national railway, and the expansion of roads, are intended to ease the traffic generated by the millions of annual visitors to the city.

Amman, and Jordan in general, is the Middle East&#x27;s hub for medical tourism. Jordan receives the most medical tourists in the region and the fifth highest in the world. Amman receives 250,000 foreign patients a year and over $1¬†billion annually.

===Business===
Amman is introducing itself as a business hub. The city&#x27;s skyline is being continuously transformed through the emergence of new projects. A significant portion of business flowed into Amman following the 2003 Iraq War. Jordan&#x27;s main airport, Queen Alia International Airport, is located south of Amman and is the hub for the country&#x27;s national carrier Royal Jordanian, a major airline in the region. The airline is headquartered in Zahran district. Rubicon Group Holding and Maktoob, two major regional information technology companies, are based in Amman, along with major international corporations such as Hikma Pharmaceuticals, one of the Middle East&#x27;s largest pharmaceutical companies, and Aramex, the Middle East&#x27;s largest logistics and transportation company.

In a report by Dunia Frontier Consultants, Amman, along with Doha, Qatar and Dubai, United Arab Emirates, are the favored hubs for multinational corporations operating in the Middle East and North Africa region. In &quot;FDI&quot; magazine, Amman was chosen as the Middle Eastern city with the most potential to be a leader in foreign direct investment in the region. Furthermore, several of the world&#x27;s largest investment banks have offices in Amman including Standard Chartered, Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale, and Citibank.

==Demographics==
The population of Amman reached 4,007,526 in 2015; the city contains about 42% of Jordan&#x27;s entire population. It has a land area of which yields a population density of about . The population of Amman has risen exponentially with the successive waves of immigrants and refugees arriving throughout the 20th century. From a population of roughly 1,000 in 1890, Amman grew to around 1,000,000 inhabitants in 1990, primarily as a result of immigration, but also due to the high birthrate in the city. Amman had been abandoned for centuries until hundreds of Circassians settled it in the 19th century. Today, about 40,000 Circassians live in Amman and its vicinity. After Amman became a major hub along the Hejaz Railway in 1914, many Muslim and Christian merchant families from al-Salt immigrated to the city. A large proportion of Amman&#x27;s inhabitants have Palestinian roots (urban or rural origin), and the two main demographic groups in the city today are Arabs of Palestinian or Jordanian descent. Other ethnic groups comprise about 2% of the population. There are no official statistics about the proportion of people of Palestinian or Jordanian descent.

New arrivals consisting of Jordanians from the north and south of the country and immigrants from Palestine had increased the city&#x27;s population from 30,000 in 1930 to 60,000 in 1947. About 10,000 Palestinians, mostly from Safed, Haifa and Acre, migrated to the city for economic opportunities before the 1948 war. Many of the immigrants from al-Salt from that time were originally from Nablus. The 1948 war caused an exodus of urban Muslim and Christian Palestinian refugees, mostly from Jaffa, Ramla and Lydda, to Amman, whose population swelled to 110,000. With Jordan&#x27;s capture of the West Bank during the war, many Palestinians from that area steadily migrated to Amman between 1950 and 1966, before another mass wave of Palestinian refugees from the West Bank moved to the city during the 1967 War. By 1970, the population had swelled to an estimated 550,000. A further 200,000 Palestinians arrived after their expulsion from Kuwait during the 1991 Gulf War. Several large Palestinian refugee camps exist around the center of Amman.

Because Amman lacks a deep-rooted native population, the city does not have a distinct Arabic dialect, although recently such a dialect utilizing the various Jordanian and Palestinian dialects, has been forming. The children of immigrants in the city are also increasingly referring to themselves as &quot;Ammani&quot;, unlike much of the first-generation inhabitants who identify more with their respective places of origin.

===Religion===
Amman has a mostly Sunni Muslim population, and the city contains numerous mosques. Among the main mosques is the large King Abdullah I Mosque, built between 1982 and 1989. It is capped by a blue mosaic dome beneath which 3,000 Muslims may offer prayer. The Abu Darweesh Mosque, noted for its checkered black-and-white pattern, has an architectural style that is unique to Jordan. The mosque is situated on Jabal Ashrafieh, the highest point in the city. The mosque&#x27;s interior is marked by light-colored walls and Persian carpets. During the 2004 Amman Message conference, edicts from various clergy-members afforded the following schools of thought as garnering collective recognition: Hanafi, Hanbali, Maliki, Shafi&#x27;i, Ja&#x27;fari, Zahiri, Zaydi, Ibadi, tassawuf-related Sufism, Muwahhidism and Salafism. Amman also has a small Druze community.

Large numbers of Christians from throughout Jordan, particularly from al-Salt, have moved to Amman. Nearby Fuheis is a predominantly Christian town located to the northwest of the city. A small Armenian Catholic community of around 70 families is present in the city. Ecclesiastical courts for matters of personal status are also located in Amman. A total of 16 historic churches are located in Umm ar-Rasas ruins in Al-Jeezah district; the site is believed to have initially served as Roman fortified military camps which gradually became a town around the 5th century AD. It has not been completely excavated. It was influenced by several civilizations including the Romans, Byzantines and Muslims. The site contains some well-preserved mosaic floors, particularly the mosaic floor of the Church of Saint Stephen.

==Cityscape==

Downtown Amman, the city center area (known in Arabic as &quot;Al-Balad&quot;), has been dwarfed by the sprawling urban area that surrounds it. Despite the changes, much remains of its old character. Jabal Amman is a tourist attraction in old Amman, where the city&#x27;s largest souks, museums, ancient constructions, monuments, and cultural sites are found. Jabal Amman also contains the famous Rainbow Street and the cultural Souk Jara market.
===Architecture===

Residential buildings are limited to four stories above street level and if possible another four stories below, according to the Greater Amman Municipality regulations. The buildings are covered with thick white or beige limestone or sandstone.

===Lifestyle===

Amman is considered one of the most liberal cities in the Arab world. The city has become one of the most popular destinations for expatriates and college students who seek to live, study, or work in the Middle East or the Arab world in general. The city&#x27;s culinary scene has changed from its shawarma stands and falafel joints to embrace many popular international restaurants and fast-food outlets such as Asian fusion restaurants, French bistros and Italian trattorias. The city has become famous for its fine dining scene among Western expatriates and Persian Gulf tourists.

Large shopping malls were built during the 2000s in Amman, including the Mecca Mall, Abdoun Mall, City Mall, Al-Baraka Mall, Taj Mall, Zara Shopping Center, Avenue Mall, and Abdali Mall in Al Abdali. Wakalat Street (&quot;Agencies Street&quot;) is Amman&#x27;s first pedestrian-only street and carries a lot of name-label clothes. The Sweifieh area is considered to be the main shopping district of Amman.

Nightclubs, music bars and shisha lounges are present across Amman, changing the city&#x27;s old image as the conservative capital of the kingdom. This burgeoning new nightlife scene is shaped by Jordan&#x27;s young population. In addition to the wide range of drinking and dancing venues on the social circuit of the city&#x27;s affluent crowd, Amman hosts cultural entertainment events, including the annual Amman Summer Festival. Souk Jara is a Jordanian weekly flea market event that occurs every Friday throughout the summer. Sweifieh is considered to be the unofficial red-light district of Amman as it holds most of the city&#x27;s nightclubs, bars. Jabal Amman and Jabal al-Luweibdeh are home to many pubs and bars as well, making the area popular among bar hoppers.

Alcohol is widely available in restaurants, bars, nightclubs, and supermarkets. There are numerous nightclubs and bars across the city, especially in West Amman. , there were 77 registered nightclubs in Jordan (excluding bars and pubs), overwhelmingly located in the capital city. In 2009, there were 222 registered liquor stores in Amman.

===Cuisine===
Danielle Pergament of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Ammani cuisine as a product of several cuisines in the region, writing that it combines &quot;the bright vegetables from Lebanon, crunchy falafels from Syria, juicy kebabs from Egypt and, most recently, spicy meat dishes from Jordan&#x27;s neighbor, Iraq. It&#x27;s known as the food of the Levant¬†‚Äì an ancient word for the area bounded by the Mediterranean Sea and the Arabian peninsula. But the food here isn&#x27;t just the sum of its calories. In this politically, religiously and ethnically fraught corner of the world, it is a symbol of bloodlines and identity.&quot; However, the city&#x27;s street food scene makes the Ammani cuisine distinctive.

===Sports===

Amman-based football clubs Al-Wehdat and Al-Faisaly, both former league champions, share one of the most popular rivalries in the local football scene. Amman hosted the 2016 FIFA U-17 Women&#x27;s World Cup along with Irbid and Zarqa.

The 2007 Asian Athletics Championships and more than one edition of the IAAF World Cross Country Championships were held in the city. Amman also hosts the Jordan Rally, which form part of the FIA World Rally Championship, becoming one of the largest sporting events ever held in Jordan.

Amman is home to a growing number of foreign sports such as skateboarding and rugby; the latter has two teams based in the city: Amman Citadel Rugby Club and Nomads Rugby Club. In 2014, German non-profit organization Make Life Skate Life completed construction of the 7Hills Skatepark, a 650 square meter concrete skatepark located at Samir Rifai park in Downtown Amman.

===Media and music===

The majority of Jordan&#x27;s radio stations are based in Amman. The first radio station to originate in the city was &quot;Hunna Amman&quot; in 1959; it mainly broadcast traditional Bedouin music. In 2000, Amman Net became the first de facto private radio station to be established in the country, despite private ownership of radio stations being illegal at the time. After private ownership was legalized in 2002, several more radio stations were created.

Most Jordanian newspapers and news stations are situated in Amman. Daily newspapers published in Amman include &quot;Alghad&quot;, &quot;Ad-Dustour&quot;, &quot;The Jordan Times&quot;, and &quot;Al Ra&#x27;i&quot;, the most circulated newspaper in the country. In 2011, &quot;Al Ra&#x27;i&quot; was ranked the 5th most popular newspaper in the Arab world by Forbes Middle-East report. &quot;Al-Arab Al-Yawm&quot; is the only daily pan-Arab newspaper in Jordan. The two most popular Jordanian TV channels, Ro&#x27;ya TV and JRTV, are based in Amman.

Aside from mainstream Arabic pop, there is a growing independent music scene in the city which includes many bands that have sizable audiences across the Arab world. Local Ammani bands along with other bands in the Middle East gather in the Roman Theater during the Al-Balad Music Festival held annually in August. Music genres of the local bands are diverse, ranging from heavy metal to Arabic Rock, jazz and rap. Performers include JadaL, Torabyeh, Bilocate, Akher Zapheer, Autostrad and El Morabba3.

===Events===

Many events take place in Amman, including Red Bull-sponsored events Soundclash and Soapbox race, the second part of Jerash Festival, Al-Balad Music Festival, Amman Marathon, Made in Jordan Festival, Amman Book Festival and New Think Festival. Venues for such cultural events often include the Roman and Odeon Theaters downtown, the Ras al Ain Hanger, King Hussein Business Park, Rainbow Theater and Shams Theater, the Royal Film Commission, Shoman libraries and Darat al Funun, and the Royal Cultural Center at Sports City. In addition to large-scale events and institutional planning, scholars point to tactical urbanism as a key element of the city&#x27;s cultural fabric.

==Transportation==
===Airports===
The main airport serving Amman is Queen Alia International Airport, situated about south of Amman. Much smaller is Amman Civil Airport, a one-terminal airport that serves primarily domestic and nearby international routes and the army. Queen Alia International Airport is the major international airport in Jordan and the hub for Royal Jordanian, the flag carrier. Its expansion was recently done and modified, including the decommissioning of the old terminals and the commissioning of new terminals costing $700M, to handle over 16¬†million passengers annually. It is now considered a state-of-the-art airport and was named &#x27;the best airport in the Middle East&#x27; for 2014 and 2015 and &#x27;the best improvement in the Middle East&#x27; for 2014 by Airport Service Quality Survey, the world&#x27;s leading airport passenger satisfaction benchmark program.

===Roads===
Amman has an extensive road network. Eight roundabout &quot;circles&quot;, which formerly marked neighborhoods, are used as landmarks. The road network includes many bridges and tunnels due to the mountainous nature of the terrain. A leading example is the Abdoun Bridge, which spans Wadi Abdoun and connects the 4th Circle to Abdoun Circle. It is considered one of Amman&#x27;s many landmarks and is the first curved suspended bridge to be built in the country.
Successive waves of refugees to the city has led to the rapid construction of new neighborhoods, but Amman&#x27;s capacity for new or widened roads remains limited despite the influx. This has resulted in increasing traffic jams, particularly during summer when there are large numbers of tourists and Jordanian expatriates visiting. In 2015, a ring road encompassing the city was constructed, which aims to connect the northern and southern parts of the city in order for traffic to be diverted outside Amman and to improve the environmental conditions in the city.
===Bus and taxi===

The city has frequent bus connections to other cities in Jordan, as well as to major cities in neighboring countries; the latter are also served by service taxis. Internal transport is served by a number of bus routes and taxis. Service taxis, which most often operate on fixed routes, are readily available and inexpensive. The two main bus and taxi stations are Abdali (near the King Abdullah Mosque, the Parliament and Palace of Justice) and the Raghadan Central Bus Station near the Roman theater in the city center. Popular Jordanian bus company services include JETT and Al-Mahatta. Taxis are the most common way to get around in Amman due their high availability and inexpensiveness.

The Amman Bus and the Amman Bus Rapid Transit public transportation systems currently serve the city. Construction work on the BRT system started in 2010, but was halted soon after amid feasibility concerns. Resuming in 2015, the first route of the BRT system was inaugurated in 2021, and the second in 2022. Another BRT route connecting Amman with Zarqa started operations in May 2024.

The BRT system in Amman runs on 2 routes: the first from Sweileh in northwest Amman to the Ras Al-Ain area next to downtown Amman, and the second from Sweileh to Mahatta terminal in eastern Amman. Both routes meet at the Sports City intersection. The first route is currently served by three lines: 98, 99 and 100. Ticket price for all lines of Amman Bus and Amman BRT are bought either online via the Amman Bus mobile application or as a rechargeable card in major terminals. Passengers scan their cards or QR codes on phone when boarding the bus, where the price ticket is subtracted from the available balance. The buses are air-conditioned, accessible, monitored with security cameras and have free internet service.

<text>Petra (; , &quot;Rock&quot;), originally known to its inhabitants as Raqmu (Nabataean: or , *&quot;Raqƒìm≈ç&quot;), is a historic and archaeological city in southern Jordan. Famous for its rock-cut architecture and water conduit systems, Petra is also called the &quot;Rose City&quot; because of the colour of the sandstone from which it is carved. The city is one of the New 7 Wonders of the World and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The area around Petra has been inhabited from as early as 7000¬†BC, and was settled by the Nabataeans, a nomadic Arab people, in the 4th century BC. Petra would later become the capital city of the Nabataean Kingdom in the second century BC. The Nabataeans invested in Petra&#x27;s proximity to the incense trade routes by establishing it as a major regional trading hub, which gained them considerable revenue. Unlike their enemies, the Nabataeans were accustomed to living in the barren deserts and thus were able to defend their kingdom. They were particularly skillful in agriculture, stone carving, and rainwater harvesting.

Petra flourished in the 1st century AD, when its Al-Khazneh structure, possibly the mausoleum of Nabataean king Aretas IV, was constructed, and its population peaked at an estimated 20,000 inhabitants. Nabataea fell to the Romans in 106¬†AD, who annexed and renamed it Arabia Petraea. Petra&#x27;s importance declined as sea trade routes emerged, and after an earthquake in 363 destroyed many structures. In the Byzantine era, several Christian churches were built, but the city continued to decline and, by the early Islamic era, it was abandoned except for a handful of nomads. It remained unknown to the western world until 1812, when Swiss traveller Johann Ludwig Burckhardt rediscovered it.

UNESCO has described Petra as &quot;one of the most precious cultural properties of man&#x27;s cultural heritage&quot;. Petra is a symbol of Jordan, as well as Jordan&#x27;s most-visited tourist attraction. Visitor numbers reach close to a million tourists every year.

== History ==

=== Neolithic ===
By 7000 BC, some of the earliest recorded farmers had settled in Beidha, a Pre-Pottery Neolithic settlement just north of Petra.

=== Bronze Age ===

Petra is listed in Egyptian campaign accounts and the Amarna letters as &quot;Pel&quot;, &quot;Sela&quot;, or &quot;Seir&quot;.

=== Iron Age Edom ===

The Iron Age lasted between 1200 and 600 BC; in that time, the Petra area was occupied by the Edomites. The configuration of mountains in Petra allowed for a reservoir of water for the Edomites. This made Petra a stopping ground for merchants, making it an outstanding area for trade. Things that were traded here included wines, olive oil, and wood.

Initially, the Edomites were accompanied by Nomads who eventually left, but the Edomites stayed and made their mark on Petra before the emergence of the Nabataens. It is said that 10,000 men were thrown off of the mountain Umm el-Biyara, but this story has been debated by scholars.

The Edomite site excavated at the top of the Umm el-Biyara mountain at Petra was established no earlier than the seventh century BC (Iron II).

=== Emergence of Petra ===

The Nabataeans were one among several nomadic Bedouin tribes that roamed the Arabian Desert and moved with their herds to wherever they could find pasture and water. Although the Nabataeans were initially embedded in Aramaic culture, theories about them having Aramean roots are rejected by many modern scholars. Instead, archaeological, religious and linguistic evidence confirm that they are a northern Arabian tribe. Current evidence suggests that the Nabataean name for Petra was Raqƒìm≈ç, variously spelled in inscriptions as &quot;rqmw&quot; or &quot;rqm&quot;.

The Jewish historian Josephus (ca. 37‚Äì100 AD) writes that the region was inhabited by the Midianites during the time of Moses, and that they were ruled by five kings, one of whom was Rekem. Josephus mentions that the city, called Petra by the Greeks, &quot;ranks highest in the land of the Arabs&quot; and was still called &quot;Rekeme&quot; by all the Arabs of his time, after its royal founder (Antiquities iv. 7, 1; 4, 7). The Onomasticon of Eusebius also identified Rekem as Petra. Arabic &quot;&quot; means &quot;to mark, to decorate&quot;, so &quot;Rekeme&quot; could be a Nabataean word referring to the famous carved rock fa√ßades. In 1964, workmen clearing rubble away from the cliff at the entrance to the gorge found several funerary inscriptions in Nabatean script. One of them was to a certain Petraios who was born in Raqmu (Rekem) and buried in Garshu (Jerash).

An old theory held that Petra might be identified with a place called &quot;sela&quot; in the Hebrew Bible. &quot;Encyclop√¶dia Britannica&quot; (1911) states that the Semitic name of the city, if not Sela, would remain unknown. It nevertheless cautioned that &quot;sela&quot; simply means &quot;rock&quot; in Hebrew, and thence might not be identified with a city where it occurs in the biblical text in the book of Obadiah. It is possible that the city was part of the nation of Edom.

The passage in Diodorus Siculus (xix. 94‚Äì97) which describes the expeditions which Antigonus sent against the Nabataeans in 312 BC, was understood by some researchers to throw some light upon the history of Petra, but the &quot;petra&quot; (Greek for rock) referred to as a natural fortress and place of refuge cannot be a proper name, and the description implies that there was no town in existence there at the time.

=== Roman period ===


In AD 106, when Cornelius Palma was governor of Syria, the part of Arabia under the rule of Petra was absorbed into the Roman Empire as part of Arabia Petraea, and Petra became its capital. The native dynasty came to an end but the city continued to flourish under Roman rule. It was around this time that the Petra Roman Road was built. A century later, in the time of Alexander Severus, when the city was at the height of its splendor, the issue of coinage came to an end. There was no more building of sumptuous tombs, owing apparently to some sudden catastrophe, such as an invasion by the neo-Persian power under the Sassanid Empire.

Meanwhile, as Palmyra (fl. 130‚Äì270) grew in importance and attracted the Arabian trade away from Petra, the latter declined. It appears, however, to have lingered on as a religious center. Another Roman road was constructed at the site. Epiphanius of Salamis (c.315‚Äì403) writes that in his time a feast was held there on December 25 in honor of the virgin Khaabou (Chaabou) and her offspring Dushara. Dushara and al-Uzza were two of the main deities of the city, which otherwise included many idols from other Nabataean deities such as Allat and Manat.

Between 111 and 114 Trajan built the Via Traiana Nova, running from the Syrian border to the Red Sea through Petra. This road followed the old routes of Nabataean caravans. In the shadow of the &quot;Pax Romana&quot;, this route revived trade between Arabia, Syria, and Mediterranean harbors. In 125 AD, one of Emperor Hadrian&#x27;s administrators left marks in Petra, pointed out by documents found at the Dead Sea. In 130 AD, Hadrian visited the former Nabataean capital, giving it the name of &quot;HadriƒÅnƒ´ Petra Metropolis&quot;, imprinted on his coins. His visit, however, did not lead to any boom in development and new buildings as it did in Jerash. The province&#x27;s governor, Sextius Florentinus, erected a monumental mausoleum for his son near the end of the al-Hubta (King&#x27;s Wall) tombs, which had been generally reserved during the Nabataean period for the royal family.

The interest that Roman emperors showed in the city in the 3rd century suggests that Petra and its environs remained highly esteemed for a long time. An inscription to Liber Pater, a god revered by Emperor Septimius Severus, was found in the &quot;temenos&quot; of the temple known as Qasr al-Bint, and Nabataean tombs contained silver coins with the emperor&#x27;s portrait, as well as pottery from his reign. Emperor Elagabalus declared Petra to be a Roman colony, when he reorganized the Roman Empire towards the end of the 3rd century. The area from Petra to Wadi Mujib, the Negev, and the Sinai Peninsula were annexed into the province of Palaestina Salutaris. Petra may be seen on the Madaba mosaic map from the reign of Emperor Justinian.

=== Byzantine period ===
Petra declined rapidly under Roman rule, in large part from the revision of sea-based trade routes. In 363, an earthquake destroyed many buildings and crippled the vital water management system. The old city of Petra was the capital of the Byzantine province of Palaestina III and many churches from the Byzantine period were excavated in and around Petra. In one of them, the Byzantine Church, 140 papyri were discovered, which contained mainly contracts dated from 530s to 590s, establishing that the city was still flourishing in the 6th century. The Byzantine Church is a prime example of monumental architecture in Byzantine Petra.

The last reference to Byzantine Petra comes from the &quot;Spiritual Meadow&quot; of John Moschus, written in the first decades of the 7th century. He gives an anecdote about its bishop, Athenogenes. It ceased to be a metropolitan bishopric sometime before 687 when that function had been transferred to Areopolis. Petra is not mentioned in the narratives of the Muslim conquest of the Levant, nor does it appear in any early Islamic records.

=== Crusaders and Mamluks ===
In the 12th century, the Crusaders built fortresses such as the Alwaeira Castle, but were forced to abandon Petra after a while. As a result, the location of Petra was lost until the 19th century.

Two further Crusader-period castles are known in and around Petra: the first is al-Wu&#x27;ayra, situated just north of Wadi Musa. It can be viewed from the road to Little Petra. It is the castle that was seized by a band of Turks with the help of local Muslims and only recovered by the Crusaders after they began to destroy the olive trees of Wadi Musa. The potential loss of livelihood led the locals to negotiate a surrender. The second is on the summit of el-Habis, in the heart of Petra, and can be accessed from the West side of the Qasr al-Bint.

The ruins of Petra were an object of curiosity during the Middle Ages and were visited by Baibars, one of the first Mamluk sultans of Egypt, towards the end of the 13th century.

=== 19th and 20th centuries ===
The first European to describe them was the Swiss traveler Johann Ludwig Burckhardt during his travels in 1812. At that time, the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem operated a diocese in al-Karak named Battra (, ) and it was the opinion among the clergy of Jerusalem that Kerak was the ancient city of Petra.

Burckhardt already spoke Arabic fluently, and was on his way to explore the Niger River when he heard stories of a dead city that held the tomb of the Prophet Aaron, and became fascinated with finding the city. He then dressed himself up as a local, and only spoke in Arabic, bringing a goat with him with the intent of sacrificing it in honor of Aaron&#x27;s Tomb. After one day of exploring, he was convinced that he had found the lost city of Petra.

L√©on de Laborde and Louis-Maurice-Adolphe Linant de Bellefonds made the first accurate drawings of Petra in 1828. The Scottish painter David Roberts visited Petra in 1839 and returned to Britain with sketches and stories of the encounter with local tribes, published in &quot;The Holy Land, Syria, Idumea, Arabia, Egypt, and Nubia&quot;. Frederic Edwin Church, the leading American landscape painter of the 19th century, visited Petra in 1868, and the resulting painting &quot;El Khasn√©, Petra&quot; is among his most important and well-documented. Missionary Archibald Forder published photographs of Petra in the December 1909 issue of National Geographic.
Because the structures weakened with age, many of the tombs became vulnerable to thieves, and many treasures were stolen. In 1929, a four-person team consisting of British archaeologists Agnes Conway and George Horsfield, Palestinian physician and folklore expert Tawfiq Canaan and Ditlef Nielsen, a Danish scholar, excavated and surveyed Petra.

The archaeologist Philip Hammond from the University of Utah visited Petra for nearly 40 years. He explained that the local folklore says it was created by the wand of Moses, when he struck the rock to bring forth water for the Israelites. Hammond believed the carved channels deep within the walls and ground were made from ceramic pipes that once fed water for the city, from rock-cut systems on the canyon rim.

In the 1980s, the Bedul Bedouin, once inhabitants of Petra, were relocated by the Jordanian government to the nearby settlement of Umm Sayhoun, a process spanning two decades. This move was part of broader initiatives aimed at settling Bedouin communities and promoting tourism in Petra. With a name meaning &quot;the changing ones&quot; and oral traditions recounting a conversion narrative, the Bedul Bedouins are believed to have adopted Islam later in their history, possibly with Jewish or Nabatean origins. Today, alongside their traditional activities, they engage in local tourism, alongside the more prominent Liyathnah tribe.

Numerous scrolls in Greek and dating to the Byzantine period were discovered in an excavated church near the Temple of the Winged Lions in Petra in December 1993.

=== 21st century ===
In December 2022, Petra was hit by heavy flooding.

== Layout ==
Petra is adjacent to the mountain of Jabal Al-Madbah, in a basin surrounded by mountains forming the eastern flank of the Arabah valley running from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba.

Excavations have demonstrated that it was the ability of the Nabataeans to control the water supply that led to the rise of the desert city, creating an artificial oasis. The area is visited by flash floods, but archaeological evidence shows that the Nabataeans controlled these floods by the use of dams, cisterns, and water conduits. These innovations stored water for prolonged periods of drought and enabled the city to prosper from its sale.

In ancient times, Petra might have been approached from the south on a track leading across the plain of Petra, around Jabal Haroun (&quot;Aaron&#x27;s Mountain&quot;), the location of the Tomb of Aaron, said to be the burial place of Aaron, brother of Moses. Another approach was possibly from the high plateau to the north. Today, most modern visitors approach the site from the east. The impressive eastern entrance leads steeply down through a dark, narrow gorge, in places only wide, called the Siq (&quot;shaft&quot;), a natural geological feature formed from a deep split in the sandstone rocks and serving as a waterway flowing into Wadi Musa.

=== Hellenistic architecture ===
Petra is known primarily for its Hellenistic architecture. The facades of the tombs in Petra are commonly rendered in Hellenistic style, reflecting the number of diverse cultures with which the Nabataeans traded, all of which were in turn influenced by Greek culture. Most of these tombs contain small burials niches carved into the stone.

Perhaps the best example of the Hellenistic style is seen in the Treasury, which is wide and tall and refers to the architecture of Alexandria. The facade of the Treasury features a broken pediment with a central tholos inside, and two obelisks appear to form into the rock at the top. Near the bottom of the Treasury are the twin Greek gods Castor and Pollux, who protect travellers on their journeys. Near the top of the Treasury, two victories are seen standing on each side of a female figure on the tholos. This female figure is believed to be the Isis-Tyche, Isis and Tyche being the Egyptian and Greek goddesses, respectively, of good fortune.

Another prime example of Hellenistic architecture featured in Petra is its Monastery, which stands at tall and wide; this is Petra&#x27;s largest monument and is similarly carved into the rock face. The facade of this again features a broken pediment, similar to the Treasury, as well as another central tholos. The Monastery displays more of a Nabataen touch while at the same time incorporating elements from Greek architecture. Its only source of light is its entrance standing at high. There is a large space outside of the Monastery, which is purposefully flattened for worship purposes. Formerly, in the Byzantine period, this was a place for Christian worship, but is now a holy site for pilgrims to visit.

=== City centre ===
At the end of the narrow gorge, the Siq, stands Petra&#x27;s most elaborate ruin, popularly known as Al-Khazneh (&quot;the Treasury&quot;), hewn into the sandstone cliff. While remaining in remarkably preserved condition, the face of the structure is marked by hundreds of bullet holes made by the local Bedouin tribes that hoped to dislodge riches that were once rumoured to be hidden within it. A little farther from the Treasury, at the foot of the mountain called &quot;en-Nejr&quot;, is a massive theatre, positioned so as to bring the greatest number of tombs within view. At the point where the valley opens out into the plain, the site of the city is revealed with striking effect. The theatre was cut into the hillside and into several of the tombs during its construction. Rectangular gaps in the seating are still visible. Almost enclosing it on three sides are rose-coloured mountain walls, divided into groups by deep fissures and lined with knobs cut from the rock in the form of towers. The theatre was said to hold around 8,500 people. The performances that audiences were able to attend here were poetry readings and dramas. Gladiator fights were also said to be held here and attracted the most audience, although no gladiator was able to gain any momentum or fame due to the heavy mortality rate that came with it. The theatre was one of many structures in Petra that took significant damage due to the 363 Galilee earthquake.
The Petra Pool and Garden Complex is a series of structures within the city center. Originally said to be a market area, excavations at the site have allowed scholars to identify it as an elaborate Nabataean garden, which included a large swimming pool, an island-pavilion, and an intricate hydraulic system.

Ahead of the Petra Pool and Garden Complex lies Colonnaded street, which is among few artifacts of Petra that was constructed rather than natural. This street used to hold a semi-circle nymphaeum, which is now in ruins due to flash flooding, and used to hold Petra&#x27;s only tree. This was intended to be a symbol for the peaceful atmosphere that the Nabataens were able to construct in Petra. Once the Romans took control of the city, Colonnaded street was narrowed to make room for a side walk, and 72 columns were added to each side.

=== High Place of Sacrifice ===

The High Place of Sacrifice is perched atop Jebel Madbah Mountain. The beginning of the hike is near Petra&#x27;s theatre. From there, the site of The High Place of Sacrifice is around an 800-step hike. One commonly believed sacrifice that took place there was libation. Another common form of sacrifice that took place there was animal sacrifice; this is due to the belief that the tomb of the Prophet Aaron is located in Petra, which is a sacred site for Muslims. In honor of this, a goat was sacrificed annually. Other rituals also took place there, including the burning of frankincense.

=== Royal Tombs ===

The Royal Tombs of Petra are in the Nabatean version of Hellenistic architecture, but their facades have worn due to natural decay. One of these tombs, the Palace Tomb, is speculated to be the tomb for the kings of Petra. The Corinthian Tomb, which is right next to the Palace Tomb, has the same Hellenistic architecture featured on the Treasury. The two other Royal Tombs are the Silk Tomb and the Urn Tomb; the Silk Tomb does not stand out as much as the Urn Tomb. The Urn Tomb features a large yard in its front, and was turned into a church in 446 AD after the expansion of Christianity.

=== Exterior platform ===

In 2016, archaeologists using satellite imagery and drones discovered a very large, previously unknown monumental structure whose beginnings were tentatively dated to about 150 BC, the time when the Nabataeans initiated their public building programme. It is located outside the main area of the city, at the foot of Jabal an-Nmayr and about south of the city centre, but is facing east, not towards the city, and has no visible relationship to it. The structure consists of a huge, platform, with a monumental staircase along its eastern side. The large platform enclosed a slightly smaller one, topped with a comparatively small building, , which was facing east toward the staircase. The structure, second in size only to the Monastery complex, probably had a ceremonial function of which not even a speculative explanation has yet been offered by the researchers.

== Religious importance ==

Pliny the Elder and other writers identify Petra as the capital of the Nabataean Kingdom and the centre of their caravan trade. Enclosed by towering rocks and watered by a perennial stream, Petra not only possessed the advantages of a fortress, but controlled the main commercial routes which passed through it to Gaza in the west, to Bosra and Damascus in the north, to Aqaba and Leuce Come on the Red Sea, and across the desert to the Persian Gulf.
The Nabataeans worshipped Arab gods and goddesses during the pre-Islamic era as well as a few of their deified kings. One, Obodas I, was deified after his death in 85 BC. Dushara was the primary male god accompanied by his three female deities: Al-‚ÄòUzzƒÅ, Allat and ManƒÅt. Many statues carved in the rock depict these gods and goddesses. New evidence indicates that broader Edomite, and Nabataean theology had strong links to Earth-Sun relationships, often manifested in the orientation of prominent Petra structures to equinox and solstice sunrises and sunsets.

A stele dedicated to Qos-Allah &#x27;Qos is Allah&#x27; or &#x27;Qos the god&#x27;, by Qosmilk (&quot;melech&quot;: king) is found at Petra (Glueck 516). Qos is identifiable with Kaush (Qaush) the God of the older Edomites. The stele is horned and the seal from the Edomite Tawilan near Petra identified with Kaush displays a star and crescent (Browning 28), both consistent with a moon deity. It is conceivable that the latter could have resulted from trade with Harran (Bartlett 194). There is continuing debate about the nature of Qos (&quot;qaus&quot;: bow) who has been identified both with a hunting bow (hunting god) and a rainbow (weather god) although the crescent above the stele is also a bow.

Nabataean inscriptions in Sinai and other places display widespread references to names including Allah, El and Allat (god and goddess), with regional references to al-Uzza, Baal and Manutu (Manat) (Negev 11). Allat is also found in Sinai in South Arabian language. Allah occurs particularly as Garm-&#x27;allahi: &quot;god decided&quot; (Greek Garamelos) and Aush-allahi: &quot;gods covenant&quot; (Greek Ausallos). We find both Shalm-lahi &quot;Allah is peace&quot; and Shalm-allat, &quot;the peace of the goddess&quot;. We also find Amat-allahi &quot;she-servant of god&quot; and Halaf-llahi &quot;the successor of Allah&quot;.

Recently, Petra has been put forward as the original direction of Muslim prayer, the Qibla, by some that the earliest mosques faced Petra, not Jerusalem or Mecca. This view is also shared by Abdullah Hashem, the self-proclaimed Qa&#x27;im of the Ahmadi Religion of Peace and Light. However, others have challenged the notion of comparing modern readings of Qiblah directions to early mosques‚Äô Qiblahs as they claim early Muslims could not accurately calculate the direction of the Qiblah to Mecca and so the apparent pinpointing of Petra by some early mosques may well be coincidental.
The Monastery, Petra&#x27;s largest monument, dates from the 1st century BC. It was dedicated to Obodas I and is believed to be the symposium of Obodas the god. This information is inscribed on the ruins of the Monastery (the name is the translation of the Arabic Ad Deir).

The Temple of the Winged Lions is a large temple complex dated to the reign of King Aretas IV (9 BC‚Äì40 AD). The temple is located in Petra&#x27;s so-called Sacred Quarter, an area situated at the end of Petra&#x27;s main Colonnaded Street consisting of two majestic temples, the Qasr al-Bint and, opposite, the Temple of the Winged Lions on the northern bank of Wadi Musa.

Christianity found its way to Petra in the 4th century AD, nearly 500 years after the establishment of Petra as a trade centre. The start of Christianity in Petra started primarily in 330 AD when the first Christian Emperor of Rome took over, Constantine I, otherwise known as Constantine The Great. He began the initial spread of Christianity throughout the Roman Empire. Athanasius mentions a bishop of Petra (Antioch. 10) named Asterius. At least one of the tombs (the &quot;tomb with the urn&quot;?) was used as a church. An inscription in red paint records its consecration &quot;in the time of the most holy bishop Jason&quot; (447). After the Islamic conquest of 629‚Äì632, Christianity in Petra, as of most of Arabia, gave way to Islam. During the First Crusade Petra was occupied by Baldwin I of the Kingdom of Jerusalem and formed the second fief of the barony of Al Karak (in the lordship of Oultrejordain) with the title &quot;Ch√¢teau de la Val√©e de Moyse&quot; or Sela. It remained in the hands of the Franks until 1189. It is still a titular see of the Catholic Church.

According to Arab tradition, Petra is the spot where Musa (Moses) struck a rock with his staff and water came forth, and where Moses&#x27; brother, Harun (Aaron), is buried, at Mount Hor, known today as Jabal Haroun or Mount Aaron. The Wadi Musa or &quot;Wadi of Moses&quot; is the Arab name for the narrow valley at the head of which Petra is sited. A mountaintop shrine of Moses&#x27; sister Miriam was still shown to pilgrims at the time of Jerome in the 4th century, but its location has not been identified since.

== Climate ==

In Petra, there is a semi-arid climate. Most rain falls in the winter. The K√∂ppen-Geiger climate classification is BSk. The average annual temperature in Petra is . About of precipitation falls annually.

== Conservation ==


The Bedul (Petra Bedouin) were forcibly resettled from their cave dwellings in Petra to Umm Sayhoun/Um Seihun by the Jordanian government in 1985, prior to the UNESCO designation process. They were provided with block-built housing with some infrastructure including in particular a sewage and drainage system. Among the six communities in the Petra Region, Umm Sayhoun is one of the smaller communities. The village of Wadi Musa is the largest in the area, inhabited largely by the Layathnah Bedouin, and is now the closest settlement to the visitor centre, the main entrance via the Siq and the archaeological site generally. Umm Sayhoun gives access to the &#x27;back route&#x27; into the site, the Wadi Turkmaniyeh pedestrian route.

On December 6, 1985, Petra was designated a World Heritage Site. In a popular poll in 2007, it was also named one of the New 7 Wonders of the World. The Petra Archaeological Park (PAP) became an autonomous legal entity over the management of this site in August 2007.
The Bedoul belong to one of the Bedouin tribes whose cultural heritage and traditional skills were proclaimed by UNESCO on the Intangible Cultural Heritage List in 2005 and inscribed in 2008.

In 2011, following an 11-month project planning phase, the Petra Development and Tourism Region Authority in association with DesignWorkshop and JCP s.r.l published a Strategic Master Plan that guides planned development of the Petra Region. This is intended to guide planned development of the Petra Region in an efficient, balanced and sustainable way over the next 20 years for the benefit of the local population and of Jordan in general. As part of this, a Strategic Plan was developed for Umm Sayhoun and surrounding areas.

The process of developing the Strategic Plan considered the area&#x27;s needs from five points of view:

* A socio-economic perspective
* The perspective of Petra Archaeological Park
* The perspective of Petra&#x27;s tourism product
* A land use perspective
* An environmental perspective

The site suffers from a host of threats, including collapse of ancient structures, erosion due to flooding and improper rainwater drainage, weathering from salt upwelling, improper restoration of ancient structures, and unsustainable tourism. The last has increased substantially, especially since the site received widespread media coverage in 2007 during the New7Wonders of the World Internet and cellphone campaign. Tourism has steadily grown, with Petra receiving 1.2 million total visitors in 2019.

In an attempt to reduce the problems, the Petra National Trust (PNT) was established in 1989. It has worked with numerous local and international organisations on projects that promote the protection, conservation, and preservation of the Petra site. Moreover, UNESCO and ICOMOS recently collaborated to publish their first book on human and natural threats to the sensitive World Heritage sites. They chose Petra as its first and the most important example of threatened landscapes. The presentation &quot;Tourism and Archaeological Heritage Management at Petra: Driver to Development or Destruction?&quot; (2012) was the first in a series to address the very nature of these deteriorating buildings, cities, sites, and regions.

People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) released a video in 2018 highlighting the abuse of working animals in Petra. PETA claimed that animals are forced to carry tourists or pull carriages every day. The video showed handlers beating and whipping working animals, with beatings intensifying when animals faltered. PETA also showed some wounded animals, including camels with fly-infested, open wounds. The Jordanian authority running the site responded by proposing a veterinary clinic, and by undertaking to spread awareness among animal handlers. In 2020, more video released by PETA indicated that conditions for the animals had not improved and, in 2021, the organization was running what appeared to be the only veterinary clinic in the area.
Petra is a site at the intersection of natural and cultural heritage forming a unique cultural landscape. Ever since Johann Ludwig Burckhardt aka Sheikh Ibrahim had re-discovered the ruin city in Petra, Jordan, in 1812, the cultural heritage site has attracted different people who shared an interest in the ancient history and culture of the Nabataeans such as travellers, pilgrims, painters and savants. However, it was not until the late 19th century that the ruins were systematically approached by archaeological researchers. Since then regular archaeological excavations and ongoing research on the Nabataean culture have been part of today&#x27;s UNESCO world cultural heritage site Petra. Through the excavations in the Petra Archaeological Park an increasing number of Nabataean cultural heritage is being exposed to environmental impact. A central issue is the management of water impacting the built heritage and the rock hewn facades. The large number of discoveries and the exposure of structures and findings demand conservation measures respecting the interlinkage between the natural landscape and cultural heritage, as especially this connection is a central challenge at the UNECSO World Heritage Site.

In recent years different conservation campaigns and projects were established at the cultural heritage site of Petra. The main works first focussed on the entrance situation of the Siq to protect tourists and to facilitate access. Also, different projects for conservation and conservation research were conducted. Following is a list of projects, to be continued.

<doc id="45010" wikidata="Q221378" url="?curid=45010" title="Oil shale">
<text>Oil shale is an organic-rich fine-grained sedimentary rock containing kerogen (a solid mixture of organic chemical compounds) from which liquid hydrocarbons can be produced. In addition to kerogen, general composition of oil shales constitutes inorganic substance and bitumens. Based on their deposition environment, oil shales are classified as marine, lacustrine and terrestrial oil shales. Oil shales differ from oil-&quot;bearing&quot; shales, shale deposits that contain petroleum (tight oil) that is sometimes produced from drilled wells. Examples of oil-&quot;bearing&quot; shales are the Bakken Formation, Pierre Shale, Niobrara Formation, and Eagle Ford Formation. Accordingly, shale oil produced from oil shale should not be confused with tight oil, which is also frequently called shale oil.

A 2016 estimate of global deposits set the total world resources of oil shale equivalent of of oil in place. Oil shale has gained attention as a potential abundant source of oil. However, the various attempts to develop oil shale deposits have had limited success. Only Estonia and China have well-established oil shale industries, and Brazil, Germany, and Russia utilize oil shale to some extent.

Oil shale can be burned directly in furnaces as a low-grade fuel for power generation and district heating or used as a raw material in chemical and construction-materials processing. Heating oil shale to a sufficiently high temperature causes the chemical process of pyrolysis to yield a vapor. Upon cooling the vapor, the liquid unconventional oil, called shale oil, is separated from combustible oil-shale gas. Shale oil is a substitute for conventional crude oil; however, extracting shale oil is costlier than the production of conventional crude oil both financially and in terms of its environmental impact. Oil-shale mining and processing raise a number of environmental concerns, such as land use, waste disposal, water use, waste-water management, greenhouse-gas emissions and air pollution.

== Geology ==

Oil shale, an organic-rich sedimentary rock, belongs to the group of sapropel fuels. It does not have a definite geological definition nor a specific chemical formula, and its seams do not always have discrete boundaries. Oil shales vary considerably in their mineral content, chemical composition, age, type of kerogen, and depositional history, and not all oil shales would necessarily be classified as shales in the strict sense. According to the petrologist Adrian C. Hutton of the University of Wollongong, oil shales are not &quot;geological nor geochemically distinctive rock but rather &#x27;economic&#x27; term&quot;. Their common defining feature is low solubility in low-boiling organic solvents and generation of liquid organic products on thermal decomposition. Geologists can classify oil shales on the basis of their composition as carbonate-rich shales, siliceous shales, or cannel shales.

Oil shale differs from bitumen-impregnated rocks (other so-called unconventional resources such as oil sands and petroleum reservoir rocks), humic coals and carbonaceous shale. While oil sands do originate from the biodegradation of oil, heat and pressure have not (yet) transformed the kerogen in oil shale into petroleum, which means its maturation does not exceed early mesocatagenetic. Oil shales differ also from oil-bearing shales, shale deposits that contain tight oil that is sometimes produced from drilled wells. Examples of oil-bearing shales are the Bakken Formation, Pierre Shale, Niobrara Formation, and Eagle Ford Formation. Accordingly, shale oil produced from oil shale should not be confused with tight oil, which is called also frequently shale oil.

General composition of oil shales constitutes inorganic matrix, bitumens, and kerogen. While the bitumen portion of oil shales is soluble in carbon disulfide, the kerogen portion is insoluble in carbon disulfide and may contain iron, vanadium, nickel, molybdenum, and uranium. Oil shale contains a lower percentage of organic matter than coal. In commercial grades of oil shale the ratio of organic matter to mineral matter lies approximately between 0.75:5 and 1.5:5. At the same time, the organic matter in oil shale has an atomic ratio of hydrogen to carbon (H/C) approximately 1.2 to 1.8¬†times lower than for crude oil and about 1.5 to 3¬†times higher than for coals. The organic components of oil shale derive from a variety of organisms, such as the remains of algae, spores, pollen, plant cuticles and corky fragments of herbaceous and woody plants, and cellular debris from other aquatic and land plants. Some deposits contain significant fossils; Germany&#x27;s Messel Pit has the status of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The mineral matter in oil shale includes various fine-grained silicates and carbonates. Inorganic matrix can contain quartz, feldspar, clay (mainly illite and chlorite), carbonate (calcite and dolomite), pyrite and some other minerals.

Another classification, known as the van Krevelen diagram, assigns kerogen types, depending on the hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen content of oil shales&#x27; original organic matter. The most commonly used classification of oil shales, developed between 1987 and 1991 by Adrian C. Hutton, adapts petrographic terms from coal terminology. This classification designates oil shales as terrestrial, lacustrine (lake-bottom-deposited), or marine (ocean bottom-deposited), based on the environment of the initial biomass deposit. Known oil shales are predominantly of aquatic (marine, lacustrine) origin. Hutton&#x27;s classification scheme has proven useful in estimating the yield and composition of the extracted oil.

== Resource ==

As source rocks for most conventional oil reservoirs, oil shale deposits are found in all world oil provinces, although most of them are too deep to be exploited economically. As with all oil and gas resources, analysts distinguish between oil shale resources and oil shale reserves. &quot;Resources&quot; refer to all oil shale deposits, while &quot;reserves&quot; represent those deposits from which producers can extract oil shale economically using existing technology. Since extraction technologies develop continuously, planners can only estimate the amount of recoverable kerogen. Although resources of oil shale occur in many countries, only 33¬†countries possess known deposits of potential economic value. Well-explored deposits, potentially classifiable as reserves, include the Green River deposits in the western United States, the Tertiary deposits in Queensland, Australia, deposits in Sweden and Estonia, the El-Lajjun deposit in Jordan, and deposits in France, Germany, Brazil, China, southern Mongolia and Russia. These deposits have given rise to expectations of yielding at least 40¬†liters of shale oil per tonne of oil shale, using the Fischer Assay.

A 2016 estimate set the total world resources of oil shale equivalent to yield of of shale oil, with the largest resource deposits in the United States accounting more than 80% of the world total resource. For comparison, at the same time the world&#x27;s proven oil reserves are estimated to be . The largest deposits in the world occur in the United States in the Green River Formation, which covers portions of Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming; about 70% of this resource lies on land owned or managed by the United States federal government. Deposits in the United States constitute more than 80% of world resources; other significant resource holders being China, Russia, and Brazil. The amount of economically recoverable oil shale is unknown.

== History ==

Humans have used oil shale as a fuel since prehistoric times, since it generally burns without any processing. Around 3000 BC, &quot;rock oil&quot; was used in Mesopotamia for road construction and making architectural adhesives. Britons of the Iron Age used tractable oil shales to fashion cists for burial, or just polish it to create ornaments.

In the 10th century, the Arab physician Masawaih al-Mardini (Mesue the Younger) described a method of extraction of oil from &quot;some kind of bituminous shale&quot;. The first patent for extracting oil from oil shale was British Crown Patent 330 granted in 1694 to Martin Eele, Thomas Hancock and William Portlock, who had &quot;found a way to extract and make great quantities of pitch, tarr, and oyle out of a sort of stone&quot;.

Modern industrial mining of oil shale began in 1837 in Autun, France, followed by exploitation in Scotland, Germany, and several other countries. Operations during the 19th century focused on the production of kerosene, lamp oil, and paraffin; these products helped supply the growing demand for lighting that arose during the Industrial Revolution, supplied from Scottish oil shales. Fuel oil, lubricating oil and grease, and ammonium sulfate were also produced. Scottish production peaked in around 1913, operating 120 oil shale works, producing 3,332,000 tonnes of oil shale, generating around 2% of the global production of petroleum. The Scottish oil-shale industry expanded immediately before World War I partly because of limited access to conventional petroleum resources and the mass production of automobiles and trucks, which accompanied an increase in gasoline consumption; but mostly because the British Admiralty required a reliable fuel source for their fleet as war in Europe loomed.

Although the Estonian and Chinese oil-shale industries continued to grow after World War II, most other countries abandoned their projects because of high processing costs and the availability of cheaper petroleum. Following the 1973 oil crisis, world production of oil shale reached a peak of 46¬†million tonnes in 1980 before falling to about 16¬†million tonnes in 2000, because of competition from cheap conventional petroleum in the 1980s.

On 2 May 1982, known in some circles as &quot;Black Sunday&quot;, Exxon canceled its US$5¬†billion Colony Shale Oil Project near Parachute, Colorado, because of low oil prices and increased expenses, laying off more than 2,000¬†workers and leaving a trail of home foreclosures and small business bankruptcies. In 1986, President Ronald Reagan signed into law the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, which among other things abolished the United States&#x27; Synthetic Liquid Fuels Program.

The global oil-shale industry began to revive at the beginning of the 21st century. In 2003, an oil-shale development program restarted in the United States. Authorities introduced a commercial leasing program permitting the extraction of oil shale and oil sands on federal lands in 2005, in accordance with the Energy Policy Act of 2005.

== Industry ==
, oil shale is utilized primarily in Brazil, China, Estonia and to some extent in Germany, and Russia. Several additional countries started assessing their reserves or had built experimental production plants, while others had phased out their oil shale industry. Oil shale serves for oil production in Estonia, Brazil, and China; for power generation in Estonia, China, and Germany; for cement production in Estonia, Germany, and China; and for use in chemical industries in China, Estonia, and Russia.

, 80% of oil shale used globally is extracted in Estonia, mainly because Estonia uses several oil-shale-fired power plants, which has an installed capacity of 2,967¬†megawatts (MW). By comparison, China&#x27;s oil shale power plants have an installed capacity of 12¬†MW, and Germany&#x27;s have 9.9¬†MW. A 470¬†MW oil shale power plant in Jordan is under construction as of 2020. Israel, Romania and Russia have in the past run power plants fired by oil shale but have shut them down or switched to other fuel sources such as natural gas. Other countries, such as Egypt, have had plans to construct power plants fired by oil shale, while Canada and Turkey had plans to burn oil shale along with coal for power generation. Oil shale serves as the main fuel for power generation only in Estonia, where 90.3% of country&#x27;s electrical generation in 2016 was produced from oil shale.

According to the World Energy Council, in 2008 the total production of shale oil from oil shale was 930,000¬†tonnes, equal to , of which China produced 375,000¬†tonnes, Estonia 355,000¬†tonnes, and Brazil 200,000¬†tonnes. In comparison, production of the conventional oil and natural gas liquids in 2008 amounted 3.95¬†billion tonnes or .

== Extraction and processing ==

Most exploitation of oil shale involves mining followed by shipping elsewhere, after which the shale is burned directly to generate electricity or undertakes further processing. The most common methods of mining involve open-pit mining and strip mining. These procedures remove most of the overlying material to expose the deposits of oil shale and become practical when the deposits occur near the surface. Underground mining of oil shale, which removes less of the overlying material, employs the room-and-pillar method.

The extraction of the useful components of oil shale usually takes place above ground (&quot;ex-situ&quot; processing), although several newer technologies perform this underground (on-site or &quot;in-situ&quot; processing). In either case, the chemical process of pyrolysis converts the kerogen in the oil shale to shale oil (synthetic crude oil) and oil shale gas. Most conversion technologies involve heating shale in the absence of oxygen to a temperature at which kerogen decomposes (pyrolyses) into gas, condensable oil, and a solid residue. This usually takes place between and . The process of decomposition begins at relatively low temperatures () but proceeds more rapidly and more completely at higher temperatures.

&quot;In-situ&quot; processing involves heating the oil shale underground. Such technologies can potentially extract more oil from a given area of land than &quot;ex-situ&quot; processes, since they can access the material at greater depths than surface mines can. Several companies have patented methods for &quot;in-situ&quot; retorting. However, most of these methods remain in the experimental phase. Two &quot;in-situ&quot; processes could be used: true &quot;in-situ&quot; processing does not involve mining the oil shale, while modified &quot;in-situ&quot; processing involves removing part of the oil shale and bringing it to the surface for modified &quot;in-situ&quot; retorting in order to create permeability for gas flow in a rubble chimney. Explosives rubblize the oil-shale deposit.

Hundreds of patents for oil shale retorting technologies exist; however, only a few dozen have undergone testing. By 2006, only four technologies remained in commercial use: Kiviter, Galoter, Fushun, and Petrosix.

== Applications and products ==
Oil shale is utilized as a fuel for thermal power-plants, burning it (like coal) to drive steam turbines; some of these plants employ the resulting heat for district heating of homes and businesses. In addition to its use as a fuel, oil shale may also serve in the production of specialty carbon fibers, adsorbent carbons, carbon black, phenols, resins, glues, tanning agents, mastic, road bitumen, cement, bricks, construction and decorative blocks, soil-additives, fertilizers, rock-wool insulation, glass, and pharmaceutical products. However, oil shale use for production of these items remains small or only in experimental development. Some oil shales yield sulfur, ammonia, alumina, soda ash, uranium, and nahcolite as shale-oil extraction byproducts. Between 1946 and 1952, a marine type of &quot;Dictyonema&quot; shale served for uranium production in Sillam√§e, Estonia, and between 1950 and 1989 Sweden used alum shale for the same purposes. Oil shale gas has served as a substitute for natural gas, but , producing oil shale gas as a natural-gas substitute remained economically infeasible.

The shale oil derived from oil shale does not directly substitute for crude oil in all applications. It may contain higher concentrations of olefins, oxygen, and nitrogen than conventional crude oil. Some shale oils may have higher sulfur or arsenic content. By comparison with West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark standard for crude oil in the futures-contract market, the Green River shale oil sulfur content ranges from near 0% to 4.9% (in average 0.76%), where West Texas Intermediate&#x27;s sulfur content has a maximum of 0.42%. The sulfur content in shale oil from Jordan&#x27;s oil shales may be as high as 9.5%. The arsenic content, for example, becomes an issue for Green River formation oil shale. The higher concentrations of these materials means that the oil must undergo considerable upgrading (hydrotreating) before serving as oil-refinery feedstock. Above-ground retorting processes tended to yield a lower API gravity shale oil than the &quot;in situ&quot; processes. Shale oil serves best for producing middle-distillates such as kerosene, jet fuel, and diesel fuel. Worldwide demand for these middle distillates, particularly for diesel fuels, increased rapidly in the 1990s and 2000s. However, appropriate refining processes equivalent to hydrocracking can transform shale oil into a lighter-range hydrocarbon (gasoline).

== Economics ==
The various attempts to develop oil shale deposits have succeeded only when the cost of shale-oil production in a given region comes in below the price of crude oil or its other substitutes (break-even price). According to a 2005 survey, conducted by the RAND Corporation, the cost of producing a barrel of oil at a surface retorting complex in the United States (comprising a mine, retorting plant, upgrading plant, supporting utilities, and spent shale reclamation), would range between US$70‚Äì95 ($440‚Äì600/m3, adjusted to 2005 values). This estimate considers varying levels of kerogen quality and extraction efficiency. In order to run a profitable operation, the price of crude oil would need to remain above these levels. The analysis also discussed the expectation that processing costs would drop after the establishment of the complex. The hypothetical unit would see a cost reduction of 35‚Äì70% after producing its first . Assuming an increase in output of during each year after the start of commercial production, RAND predicted the costs would decline to $35‚Äì48 per barrel ($220‚Äì300/m3) within 12 years. After achieving the milestone of , its costs would decline further to $30‚Äì40 per barrel ($190‚Äì250/m3). In 2010, the International Energy Agency estimated, based on the various pilot projects, that investment and operating costs would be similar to those of Canadian oil sands, that means would be economic at prices above $60 per barrel at current costs. This figure does not account carbon pricing, which will add additional cost. According to the New Policies Scenario introduced in its World Energy Outlook 2010, a price of $50 per tonne of emitted adds additional $7.50 cost per barrel of shale oil. As of November 2021, the price of tonne of exceeded $60.

A 1972 publication in the journal &quot;P√©trole Informations&quot; () compared shale-based oil production unfavorably with coal liquefaction. The article portrayed coal liquefaction as less expensive, generating more oil, and creating fewer environmental impacts than extraction from oil shale. It cited a conversion ratio of of oil per one ton of coal, as against of shale oil per one ton of oil shale.

A critical measure of the viability of oil shale as an energy source lies in the ratio of the energy produced by the shale to the energy used in its mining and processing, a ratio known as &quot;energy return on investment&quot; (EROI). A 1984 study estimated the EROI of the various known oil-shale deposits as varying between 0.7‚Äì13.3, although known oil-shale extraction development projects assert an EROI between 3 and 10. According to the World Energy Outlook 2010, the EROI of &quot;ex-situ&quot; processing is typically 4 to 5 while of &quot;in-situ&quot; processing it may be even as low as 2. However, according to the IEA most of used energy can be provided by burning the spent shale or oil-shale gas. To increase efficiency when retorting oil shale, researchers have proposed and tested several co-pyrolysis processes.

== Environmental considerations ==
Mining oil shale involves numerous environmental impacts, more pronounced in surface mining than in underground mining. These include acid drainage induced by the sudden rapid exposure and subsequent oxidation of formerly buried materials; the introduction of metals including mercury into surface-water and groundwater; increased erosion, sulfur-gas emissions; and air pollution caused by the production of particulates during processing, transport, and support activities.

Oil-shale extraction can damage the biological and recreational value of land and the ecosystem in the mining area. Combustion and thermal processing generate waste material. In addition, the atmospheric emissions from oil shale processing and combustion include carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. Environmentalists oppose production and usage of oil shale, as it creates even more greenhouse gases than conventional fossil fuels. Experimental &quot;in situ&quot; conversion processes and carbon capture and storage technologies may reduce some of these concerns in the future, but at the same time they may cause other problems, including groundwater pollution. Among the water contaminants commonly associated with oil shale processing are oxygen and nitrogen heterocyclic hydrocarbons. Commonly detected examples include quinoline derivatives, pyridine, and various alkyl homologues of pyridine, such as picoline and lutidine.

Water concerns are sensitive issues in arid regions, such as the western U.S. and Israel&#x27;s Negev Desert, where plans exist to expand oil-shale extraction despite a water shortage. Depending on technology, above-ground retorting uses between one and five barrels of water per barrel of produced shale-oil. A 2008 programmatic environmental impact statement issued by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management stated that surface mining and retort operations produce of waste water per of processed oil shale. &quot;In situ&quot; processing, according to one estimate, uses about one-tenth as much water.

Environmental activists, including members of Greenpeace, have organized strong protests against the oil shale industry. In one result, Queensland Energy Resources put the proposed Stuart Oil Shale Project in Australia on hold in 2004.

== Extraterrestrial oil shale ==
Some comets contain massive amounts of an organic material almost identical to high grade oil shale, the equivalent of cubic kilometers of such mixed with other material; for instance, corresponding hydrocarbons were detected in a probe fly-by through the tail of Halley&#x27;s Comet in 1986.

<text>North Cascades National Park is a national park of the United States in Washington. At more than , it is the largest of the three National Park Service units that comprise the North Cascades National Park Complex. North Cascades National Park consists of a northern and southern section, bisected by the Skagit River that flows through the reservoirs of Ross Lake National Recreation Area. Lake Chelan National Recreation Area lies on the southern border of the south unit of the park. In addition to the two national recreation areas, other protected lands including several national forests and wilderness areas, as well as Canadian provincial parks in British Columbia, nearly surround the park. North Cascades National Park features the rugged mountain peaks of the North Cascades Range, the most expansive glacial system in the contiguous United States, the headwaters of numerous waterways, and vast forests with the highest degree of flora biodiversity of any American national park.

The region was first settled by Paleo-Indian Native Americans; by the time European American explorers arrived, it was inhabited by Skagit tribes. By the early 19th century, the region was visited by fur trappers and several British and American companies vied for control over the fur trade. After the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border was set at the 49th parallel in 1846, explorers came to chart potential routes through the mountains for roads and railroads. Limited mining and logging occurred from the late 19th century to the early 20th century. The first significant human impact in the region occurred in the 1920s when several dams were built in the Skagit River valley to generate hydroelectric power. Environmentalists then campaigned to preserve the remaining wilderness, culminating on October 2, 1968, with the designation of North Cascades National Park.

Heavy snows and a high risk of avalanches due to the steep terrain, especially on the western slopes, severely limit visitation in the winter. Most access to the park is from State Route 20, which follows the Skagit River, though even this road is closed for months at a time in the winter. Most of the plant and animal species native to the park region are still found there, though climate change and pollutants from industrialized regions to the west pose risks to the environment. The park has one of the earliest and longest lasting research programs dedicated to studying climate change, primarily through examining the effects of glacial retreat.

North Cascades National Park is almost entirely protected as wilderness, and so the park has few structures, roads or other improvements. Visitors wishing to drive to a campground must do so in the adjacent national forests or national recreation areas. Camping inside the park requires hiking in by trail, horseback or boat, and camping is regulated by a permit system to ensure the wilderness is not over-exploited. Mountaineering is popular in the park and only unobtrusive clean climbing is allowed.

== Human history ==
=== Paleoindians and Native Americans ===
Human history in North Cascades National Park and the surrounding region begins 8‚Äì10,000¬†years ago, after the end of the last glacial period. Paleo-Indians slowly advanced from Puget Sound into the interior mountain region as the glacial ice retreated. Archaeological evidence from other sites hundreds of miles away from the park indicate that Hozomeen chert, a type of rock well-suited to the fabrication of implements, was mined from near Hozomeen Mountain, just east of the park border, for the last 8,400¬†years. Tools such as microblades made from Hozomeen chert are part of the archaeological record throughout the Skagit River Valley, west of the park and in regions to the east. Prehistoric micro blades 9,600¬†years old have been discovered at Cascade Pass, a mountain pass that connects the western lowlands to the interior regions of the park and the Stehekin River Valley. The microblades are part of an archaeological assemblage that includes five distinct cultural periods, indicating that people were traveling into the mountains nearly 10,000¬†years ago. As well as the archaeological excavation at Cascade Pass, there are another 260 prehistoric sites that have been identified in the park.

When white explorers first entered the area in the late 18th century, an estimated thousand Native American Skagits lived in what is now North Cascades National Park as well as the surrounding area. Residing mainly to the west of the park near Puget Sound, the Skagits lived in settlements, culling their needs from the waterways and traveling by canoe. Skagits formed a loose confederation of tribes that united if threatened by outside tribes such as the Haidas, who lived to the north. They erected large houses or lodges that could house multiple families, each with their own partitioned area and entrance. The lodges were in length and in width, and the roofs were shed-styles, with a single pitch; structures built by other Puget Sound tribes usually had gable roofs with more than one pitch. The Skagits were generally lowlanders, who only ventured into the North Cascades during the summer months, and structures in the mountains were more modest, consisting mostly of temporary buildings erected with poles and covered with branches. The Skagits erected totem poles and participated in potlatch ceremonies, similar to the Haidas, but with less complexity and extravagance. By 1910, only about 56 Skagits remained in the region, but their numbers have since rebounded to several hundred.

Inland and residing to the north and east of the Skagit tribe, the Nlaka&#x27;pamux (also known as the &quot;Thompson Indians&quot;, named after explorer David Thompson), Chelan, Okanogan and Wenatchi (Wenatchee) tribes lived partly or year-round in the eastern sections of the North Cascades. The Skagits and Nlaka&#x27;pamux often had disputes, and raided one another&#x27;s camps in search of slaves or to exact retribution. Like the coastal-based Skagits, inland tribes also constructed long lodges which were occupied by numerous families, though the style of construction was slightly different as the lodges did not have partitions separating one family from another, and were frame constructed and covered with reed mats rather than from cedar planking. One Wenatchee tribal lodge was described by Thompson as being long. Inland tribes were more likely to travel on foot or horseback than by canoe since the inland regions were less densely forested. Inland tribes also had less bountiful fisheries and greater weather extremes due to being further away from the moderating influence of the Pacific Ocean. Inland tribes rarely erected totem poles or participated in potlatch ceremonies. By the beginning of the 20th century, inland tribes, like their coastal neighbors, had experienced population decline from their first contact with white explorers a hundred years earlier, mostly due to smallpox and other diseases.
=== Anglo-European exploration ===

The first white explorer to enter the North Cascades was most likely a Scotsman named Alexander Ross, who was in the employ of the American-owned Pacific Fur Company. To the southeast of the modern park boundary, Ross and other members of the company constructed Fort Okanogan in 1811, as a base from which to operate during the early period of the Pacific Northwest fur trade. Fort Okanogan was the first American settlement in present-day Washington State, well north of the route followed by members of the Lewis and Clark Expedition of 1804‚Äì1806, and also north of Fort Vancouver, on the Columbia River. Fort Okanogan was later owned by the North West Company, and then the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, both of which were British-owned.

Both Native American and white trappers conducted fur transactions at the trading post, which was staffed by representatives of the fur trading company. During one season, Ross traded 1,500 beaver pelts. In 1814, Ross became the first known white explorer to explore the valleys and high passes of the North Cascades, but he was less interested in exploration than discovering a route that would easily connect the fur trading posts of interior Washington with Puget Sound to the west. Ross was accompanied by three Indians, one of whom was a guide who led the party to a high pass in the North Cascades. Ross and the guide may have traveled as far west as the Skagit River, but failed to get to Puget Sound. Fur trading slowed considerably as demand for furs decreased in the 1840s, but a few residents continued to augment their income by trapping for furs in the area until 1968, when the park was established, rendering the activity illegal.

Aside from isolated trappers, the North Cascades saw no further explorations until the 1850s. In 1853, US Army Captain George B. McClellan led a party that explored the area for potential locations for the construction of a railroad through the region. McClellan determined the mountains were too numerous and precipitous, and that any railway would have to be constructed well to the south.

American and British disputes in the region centered on the fur trade, and the Treaty of 1818 allowed for joint administration of Oregon Country, as it was referred to in the United Statesthe British Empire referred to the region as the Columbia District. The treaty set the international border at the 49th parallel, but this was disputed west of the Rocky Mountains, since the rival fur trading outfits had their own ideas about where the border should be. The Oregon boundary dispute between Britain and the United States eventually led to the Oregon Treaty of 1846, and the 49th parallel forms both the current international border as well as the northern limit of the current park. During the late 1850s, members of the US North West Boundary Commission explored the border region, attempting to identify which mountains, rivers and lakes belonged to which country. One party of the commission was led by explorer Henry Custer, and they explored the northern district of the park, publishing their report in the 1860s. Custer&#x27;s party crossed Whatcom Pass in 1858, and were the first whites to see Challenger Glacier and Hozomeen Mountain. Impressed with the scenic grandeur of the region, Custer stated, &quot;must be seen, it cannot be described&quot;.

In 1882, US Army Lieutenant Henry Hubbard Pierce led a government-sponsored exploration that traversed the western boundary of the southern section of the current park, in search of transportation routes and natural resources. As with the party led by McClellan in the 1850s, Pierce failed to find a suitable route for a railway, and only marginally suitable routes for roads. However, the expedition discovered gold in a quartz vein on the slopes of Eldorado Peak. Further expeditions by the military in 1883 and 1887 also determined that the mountains were virtually impenetrable. Explorers continued to seek out routes for wagon roads and railways and by the end of the 19th century, much of the park had been explored, but it was not until 1972 that the North Cascades Highway bisected the mountains.

=== Mining, logging and dam construction ===

Mineral prospectors entered the North Cascades region, and by the 1850s were doing placer mining along the banks of the Skagit River in search of gold. In the 1870s, placer mining also commenced along Ruby Creek, and hundreds of miners came to the region even though it was difficult to access. Most mining activity along Ruby Creek had ended by the 1880s, but was soon replaced by hard rock mining for silver and other minerals. This second period of mining lasted from the 1890s to the 1940s, but was only marginally more lucrative. Miners were hampered by short working seasons, difficult terrain, low quantities of ore and a lack of financial investment. Miners built some of the first trails and roads into portions of the backcountry, some of which involved intricate engineering, including bridges over the numerous streams and dynamiting rock ledges above steep gorges during trail construction. One mining company built a series of flumes, the longest of which was over , to transport lumber and to supply water for use in their hydraulic mining operation.

During the late 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, larger operations mined silver and lead in addition to gold, mostly with little or no profitability. The demand for metals was not constant, and so prices tended to fluctuate too greatly for mining to be viable. Once the region became a national park, some privately owned mining inholdings remained. One such inholding, the Thunder Creek mine, was still privately owned as of 1997.

Unlike in many other regions of the Pacific Northwest, logging had little impact on the future park. The ruggedness of the terrain and the existence of more economically viable timber resources that were closer to transportation routes largely dissuaded the timber industry from logging in the area. In 1897 the Washington Forest Reserve was set aside, preserving the forestland that would later become the park. By 1905, the management of the reserve was transferred from the Department of the Interior to the Department of Agriculture. The Forest Service was subsequently created to administer these forest reserves nationwide, which were redesignated as National Forests. Though the Department of Agriculture allowed commercial enterprises to log the forest with a permit, most of the timber taken from the region was used only locally for the construction of cabins and similar small-scale enterprises. Logging expanded when the Skagit River Hydroelectric Project was commenced by the public utility Seattle City Light in the 1920s. Almost of timber would have been left underwater by the completion of the Ross Dam. A contract to extract the timber was awarded in 1945 and the project was completed in 1958. None of the dams or areas that were extensively logged are within the current boundaries of the national park, but they are in the adjoining Ross Lake National Recreation Area.

=== Establishing the National Park ===

The establishment of Yellowstone National Park in 1872, and Yosemite National Park in 1890, led preservationists to argue for similar protections for other areas. Even before the North Cascade region was designated as a Forest Reserve in 1897, activists argued the region should be afforded the greater protection accorded from a National Park designation. Washingtonians submitted a petition in 1892 to establish a national park to the north of Lake Chelan, as many who had visited the region believed it to have scenery &quot;greater than Switzerland&#x27;s&quot;. Further efforts took place in 1906, and again between 1916 and 1921, when artist Julian Itter and the Mazamas Alpine Club lobbied for a bill to designate &quot;Mount Baker National Park&quot;. The proposals failed to gain approval from the US Congress and were shelved for decades.

Not all locals supported the idea of a national park, as they felt that such a designation would damage the economics of the region. The Forest Service was also not in favor of park designation, as they would have to relinquish control over the land to the Park Service, which was not uncommon, since many parks being established were originally managed by the Forest Service. In an effort to appease their detractors, the Forest Service designated Primitive Areas which would provide increased protection to some of the most pristine regions they managed.

By the mid-1930s, forester Bob Marshall argued that the region should be set aside as wilderness. Rival interests continued to argue over whether the lands should remain under the management of the Forest Service or the National Park Service, but by the 1960s the environmentalist argument advocating for a national park prevailed. President John F. Kennedy directed the Departments of Agriculture and the Interior to fund a joint study into a possible national park in the North Cascades region, which was completed in January 1966 and submitted to Congress. The size of the national park was subject to debate locally and in Congress, as well as its effect on the local logging industry. The North Cascades National Park Act designated the region as a national park on October 2, 1968, and the National Park Service commenced direct management on January 1, 1969. The North Cascades National Park Act also designated Ross Lake and Lake Chelan National Recreation Areas. Redwood National Park in California was also signed into existence on the same day as the North Cascades. By 1988, much of Bob Marshall&#x27;s original plan to set aside the future park as wilderness was achieved when almost all of North Cascades National Park was designated as the Stephen Mather Wilderness.

== Park management ==
North Cascades National Park is managed by the National Park Service, and the park headquarters is in Sedro-Woolley, Washington. The park consists of a northern and a southern district or unit. These are separated by Ross Lake National Recreation Area. The southeast boundary of the southern district abuts Lake Chelan National Recreation Area; the park and two recreation areas are managed as the North Cascades National Park Complex. Most of the park complex was designated as the Stephen Mather Wilderness, preventing further human-induced alterations to 93¬†percent of the park. The mandate of the National Park Service is to &quot;preserve and protect natural and cultural resources&quot;. In keeping with this mandate, hunting is illegal in the park, as is mining, logging, oil and gas extraction, and removal of natural or cultural resources.

In 2016, North Cascades National Park recorded 28,646 visitors, while adjoining Ross Lake National Recreation Area reported 905,418 visitors and Lake Chelan National Recreation Area had 45,514 visitors. Peak visitation is between June and September. Ross Lake NRA is easily accessible on State Route 20 (also called the North Cascades Highway), the only road which traverses the park complex; the highway lies entirely within the Ross Lake NRA. Only two primitive roadways enter the actual national park. The North Cascades National Park Complex had an operating base budget of $7,700,000 for fiscal year 2010, augmented by another $3,700,000 of non-base funding (which can fluctuate significantly on an annual basis), and additional funding from revenue generated from concessionaire contracts and user fees. Much of the budget is for staffing, with 83¬†percent covering the cost of 81 permanent employees, not all of whom are employed year-round, and the nearly 250 seasonal and term employees who work primarily in the summer months. In 2017, the fiscal year budget was approximately 7.5¬†million dollars, and budgets have been stagnant overall for all National Park Service sites for many years.

=== Access ===

Although there are some gravel roads open to the public that enter the park, such as the Cascade River Road beginning at Marblemount, and the Thornton Lakes Road near Newhalem, most automobile traffic travels on State Route 20, which passes through the Ross Lake National Recreation Area. The visitor center at Newhalem on the North Cascades Highway is open in the summer. Some of the best views of Mount Shuksan are from the Heather Meadows Visitor Center in Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest well outside of the park. All backcountry access requires a permit, and most are obtained at the Wilderness Information Center near Marblemount. Full accessibility for all is not available in the park, but the adjacent National Recreation Areas have a few trails, and all visitor centers, campgrounds and restrooms are fully accessible.

The nearest large town on the west side of the park is Sedro-Woolley, and Winthrop lies to the east. Chelan is located at the southeastern end of Lake Chelan where access to the park from Stehekin serves eastern Washington communities. The closest international airport is Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (Sea-Tac), which is from North Cascades Visitor Center and from Chelan. In Chelan, the &quot;Lady of the Lake&quot; is a passenger-only ferry that transports visitors to Stehekin, and the trailheads hikers can use to access the southern end of the park.
== Geography ==

North Cascades National Park is located in portions of Whatcom, Skagit, and Chelan counties in the U.S. state of Washington. Bisected by Ross Lake National Recreation Area (NRA), the park consists of two districts; the northern and southern. The northern boundary of the north district is also the international border between the United States and Canada; the latter manages adjoining Chilliwack Lake and Skagit Valley Provincial Park. The entire eastern and southern boundary of the north district is bordered by Ross Lake NRA. The western side of the north district is bordered by Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest, within which lies the Mount Baker and Noisy-Diobsud Wildernesses, both of which border the park. Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest also borders a portion of the southern district of the park, to the southwest. Along the southwest border is Wenatchee National Forest, within which lies the Glacier Peak Wilderness. The southern boundary of the park is shared with Lake Chelan NRA, and a small section of the eastern boundary is shared with the Okanogan‚ÄìWenatchee National Forest. The Lake Chelan-Sawtooth Wilderness lies in the Okanogan‚ÄìWenatchee National Forest along the southeastern park boundary.

North Cascades National Park has nearly of vertical relief, with the park&#x27;s highest point atop Goode Mountain, and the western valleys situated at only around above mean sea level, the park has a highly varied ecosystem, including eight life zones. Erosion from water and glacial ice have created some of the steepest mountain ranges in the contiguous US, rising between above their bases. The park is home to over 300 glaciers as well as 300 lakes, and contains the headwaters for some streams that flow into the Skagit River, as well as the Stehekin and Nooksack Rivers. The ruggedness of the terrain was an obstacle to human encroachment and consequently, the park is almost entirely wilderness.

=== Geology ===
North Cascades National Park was named after the North Cascades mountains, which are a subsection of the Cascade Range that extends from northern California into British Columbia. The North Cascades are the northernmost section of the range and unlike their southern counterparts that consist of Tertiary to Holocene volcanic rocks, the North Cascades are composed primarily of Mesozoic crystalline and metamorphic rocks. Though most rocks in the park are from the more recent Mesozoic, the oldest rocks are 400¬†million years old, dating from the Devonian. A complex assemblage of various rock formations have repeatedly been eroded, reburied, subjected to fracturing and heat, creating a geological puzzle that is one of the most complicated and least understood geological records in North America. These forces are ongoing and the region continues to see uplift and faulting.

Evidence from the fossils and magnetism found in the rocks indicates that the terranes composing the North Cascades drifted thousands of miles north until they impacted the North American Plate 90¬†million years ago. The collision between the rocks caused fracturing and folding as well as uplift and the terranes were further fractured into north or south trending faults. The uplifted rocks mostly eroded away; 40¬†million years ago the heavier basaltic rocks of the ocean floor started to push the lighter granitic rocks that are the core of the mountains upward, a process that continues. Subjected to intense heat, rocks deep underground near the collision zone became recrystallized into granitic rocks, which comprise the backbone of the highest peaks. Continued uplift and erosion and finally the action of glacial ice on the landscape during the Holocene exposed the rocks visible today.

Much harder and more durable than the younger volcanic rocks of the southern Cascades, the North Cascades are consequently more rugged, with steep terrain being the norm due to heavy erosion from water and ice. Continued rising in conjunction with erosion from water and ice has created deep valleys and significant vertical relief that is comparable to much taller mountain ranges.

=== Mountains ===
The tallest mountain in North Cascades National Park is Goode Mountain at . It lies in a remote backcountry region of the southern section of the park. Nearby are several other peaks that exceed , including Buckner Mountain () and Mount Logan (). At about , about northeast of Goode Mountain, is Black Peak (). Other prominent peaks in the southern section of the park include Boston Peak (), Eldorado Peak () and Forbidden Peak ().

The northern region of the park contains the Picket Range, a subrange of the Skagit Range, which is in turn a subrange of the North Cascades. The Picket Range has numerous spires with ominous names such as Mount Fury, Mount Challenger, Poltergeist Pinnacle, Mount Terror, Ghost Peak and Phantom Peak, all of which exceed . The Picket Range is only long yet contains 21 peaks over . North of the Picket Range and near the border with Canada lie Mount Redoubt (), Mount Spickard () and the spires of the Mox Peaks (). Isolated and dominating the northwestern reaches of the park lies the oft photographed Mount Shuksan (), which towers more than above Baker Lake only to the south.

=== Water features ===

More than 500 lakes and ponds are located within North Cascades National Park. Many of these are devoid of fish, not uncommon in steep terrain where fish may not be able to access high altitude waterways. Around 240 of these lakes exist in the higher elevations and stocking of some of these lakes with fish has been ongoing since the late 19th century. Fishing in these lakes, which, without fish stocking, do not have native fish, is part of the area&#x27;s economy and tourism. In 2008 an Environmental Impact Statement was produced that examined whether these lakes should continue to be stocked, and if so, what the impact would be on native species such as salamanders and other aquatic life. The North Cascades National Park Service Complex Fish Stocking Act, signed in 2014, directs the NPS to allow stocking of non-reproducing fish in no more than 42 lakes, making it the only national park to continue to stock non-native fish in park lakes. The prior decision not to continue to stock the lakes with fish was part of a larger debate about what &quot;natural&quot; means in reference to national parks.

Hundreds of creeks and streams and several rivers originate within the park. The streams at higher elevation are often directly supplied by meltwater from glaciers, and they carry finely ground rock particles commonly referred to as glacial flour. Turning the water a turquoise hue at times, this finely ground powder remains suspended in lakes the creeks flow into, also causing some of them to appear turquoise. Thunder Creek is particularly well known for this attribute, as it is supplied melt water from dozens of glaciers and transports the suspended particles into Diablo Lake.

The Skagit River divides the park into the north and south districts; it lies within the Ross Lake NRA and outside of the national park boundaries, but some of the creeks and streams that supply it originate within the national park; the Baker River is the largest of these tributaries. The Skagit River is the largest river that flows into Puget Sound to the west, and the dams located in Ross Lake National Recreation Area and impounding other lakes adjacent to the park supply nearly 90¬†percent of the electricity used in Seattle. Other important rivers that originate in the park include the Chilliwack, Nooksack and the Stehekin rivers.
=== Glaciers ===

With approximately 312 glaciers, North Cascades National Park has the most glaciers of any US park outside Alaska, and a third of all the glaciers in the lower 48 states. Counting a few glaciers in the adjoining National Recreation Areas, the North Cascades National Park Complex glaciers covered an expanse totaling as of 2009. Boston Glacier, on the north slope of Boston Peak, is the largest glacier in the park, measured in 1971 to have an area of . Other glaciers that were measured in 1971 to be larger than include East Nooksack and Sulphide Glaciers on Mount Shuksan, McAllister and Inspiration Glaciers on Eldorado Peak, Redoubt Glacier on Mount Redoubt, Neve Glacier on Snowfield Peak, and Challenger Glacier on Mount Challenger.
The dense concentration and relative ease of access to the North Cascade glaciers brought about some of the earliest series of scientific studies regarding glaciology in the United States. Beginning in 1955, the University of Washington sponsored Richard C. Hubley to undertake annual aerial photography expeditions designed to capture images of the glaciers and to show any alterations that might be occurring. In 1960, Austin Post expanded the aerial coverage to include other regions and he also used ground-based imagery to augment the research. In 1971, based on the photographs and other data collected since 1955, Post and others wrote a report that documented the number and scale of glaciers in the North Cascades. At the time of Austin Post&#x27;s inventory, their study concluded that some North Cascades glaciers had experienced a period of minor growth or equilibrium in the mid-20th century, after undergoing decades of retreat. The study concluded that annual glacial melt due to seasonal variations has a significant influence on river levels, accounting for about 30¬†percent of the late summer water flow, which directly impacted the supported ecosystems such as salmon fisheries.

The National Park Service, United States Geological Survey (USGS) and glaciologists such as Mauri S. Pelto, who has led the North Cascades Glacier Climate Project since 1984, have continued research on North Cascade glaciers. Since 1993, the National Park Service has conducted rigorous studies on four park glaciers: Noisy Creek, Silver, North Klawatti and Sandalee Glaciers. The National Park Service research indicated that these four glaciers experienced rapid decrease in volumes between 1993 and 2011. In 1998, a National Park Service and Portland State University aerial photographic inventory showed a 13¬†percent loss in park-wide glacial volume since Austin Post&#x27;s inventory in 1971. The NPS stated that in the last 150¬†years since the end of the Little Ice Age, a period of several centuries in which the earth experienced a cooling phase, glacial ice volumes in the North Cascades have been reduced by 40¬†percent. This loss of glacial ice has contributed to decreased melt in the summer. In a paper published in 2016, it was reported that since 1959 the Skagit River watershed has seen a 25¬†percent reduction in the summertime streamflow.

== Ecology ==
Eight distinctive life zones support thousands of different plant and animal species in the North Cascades National Park ecosystem. With an elevation gain of nearly , the park has one of the largest ranges of biodiversity found in any US national park.

===Flora===
The flora in North Cascades National Park is influenced by the great vertical relief, the amount of moisture an area receives, the slope and soil types as well as the fire ecology. This wide array of ecological niches has allowed a great biodiversity to evolve. Few other North American national parks have recorded as many vascular plant species as have been documented in North Cascades National Park. With 1,630 species documented, experts estimate adding non-vascular plants and fungi could more than double the number of known plant species. 

The park contains an estimated of old-growth forests. As little of the park was previously logged, significant stands of old growth forest can be found in the valleys and lower slopes up to the timberline at . From the lowest valley floors to about , virgin stands of western hemlock, red cedar and Douglas fir are common. These species are heavily dependent on deep soils, and red cedars 1,000 years old and over tall can be found on Big Beaver Creek. These lowest elevation forests can be accessed by trails, such as the Happy Creek Forest Walk off State Route 20, the Shadows of the Sentinels at Baker Lake, Thunder Creek Trail at Diablo Lake and the Horseshoe Bend Trail from State Route 542. In openings in the forest canopy, red alder and bigleaf maple can be found but throughout this dense forest, ferns, shrubs and mosses abound.

Between the forest is dominated by the pacific silver fir tree near State Route 20 at Rainy Pass. Also at this elevation, the western hemlock is replaced by the mountain hemlock as a dominant species. At elevations between in the subalpine zone, the forest gives way to meadows dominated by grasses and flowering plants and shrubs. Above lies the alpine zone where few plant species survive aside from some sparse grasses, the occasional shrub and lichens. A warming climate has led to an altitude adjustment for many flora species, with the timberline reaching further up the mountain slopes since the 1960s.

The biodiversity of the area is threatened by climate change and invasive exotic plant species. These plants have spread across the park through the inadvertent redistribution from human activities, attaching themselves to cars and hikers. Invasive plants include the diffuse knapweed and reed canary grass. True grass species number nearly 150 in the park; half of those are considered exotic and nonnative to the ecosystem.

Whitebark pine is native to the park and grows at elevations over in the drier eastern region of the park. Whitebark pine is a stabilizing species for other species of high altitude flora and provides a food source for birds such as the Clark&#x27;s nutcracker and mammals including red and Douglas squirrels. Scientists believe that increasing temperatures will have a negative impact on the habitat necessary to support whitebark pine, and therefore impact a wide array of other species. White pine blister rust and mountain pine beetles have devastated whitebark pine populations in many regions; as of 2018, &quot;28¬†percent of whitebark pine trees are dead, 30¬†percent are infected with blister rust, and 1¬†percent have died from mountain pine beetles.&quot;

=== Fauna ===

This park has a diversity of animal species including 75 mammal species. A total of 18 species of carnivores including coyote, bobcat, lynx, cougar, mink, river otter and black bear have been reported within this park. Several species of deer such as the elk and moose, several more species of bovids including the mountain goat and bighorn sheep, and more than two dozen species of rodents like the beaver, hoary marmot and pika are also present. Ten species of bats have been documented. The grey wolf is listed as an endangered species, while the grizzly bear is listed as threatened. North Cascade National Park has management plans in place to return grizzly bears to the park but not wolves, as the latter is seen as likely to reestablish themselves naturally over time.

The park is a prime habitat for grizzly bear, but the species was extirpated from the region by 1860. Only two grizzly bear sightings occurred in the decade before 2015, and these were outside the park boundary in Canada. In 1991, a decision was reached by the Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee, a US Government land management agency committee, to make efforts to restore self-sustaining populations of grizzlies in the North Cascades region, which included the national park and surrounding national forests. In 1997, the North Cascades region was added to the National Grizzly Bear Recovery Plan; by 2017, the environmental impact statement for grizzly bear restoration was still in the public comment stage. Various action plans had been proposed to reestablish a self-sustaining population of 200 grizzlies in the region.
Wolverines are one of the rarest and most elusive mammals in North America. They are seldom sighted in the park, both due to the limited numbers of the species and the habitats they prefer, which are snowy high-altitude regions far removed from human encroachment. Approximately nine wolverines were captured in the national forest east of the park and fitted with transmitters that were tracked by Argos satellite telemetry. Four of the wolverines frequented the southern sections of North Cascades National Park, and of those, two spent the majority of their time there; researchers were unable to determine if these study animals had reproduced in the park. A warming climate may impact any wolverine recovery efforts implemented due to the loss of snow cover this species needs to reproduce. Research indicates that wolverines den in deep snow at least deep that lasts well into May, and as climate warms, these regions are becoming less common, especially in the lower 48 states.

More than 200 species of birds that pass through or use the park as a breeding ground have been recorded. These bird species include both golden and bald eagle as well as northern spotted owl, harlequin duck, Clark&#x27;s nutcracker, trumpeter swan and seasonal appearances of western tanager, Cassin&#x27;s vireo, pine grosbeak, woodpeckers such as the pileated woodpecker and primarily ground-dwelling birds such as the sooty grouse. The peregrine falcon is the only species found in the park that is federally designated as an endangered species, while the marbled murrelet and northern spotted owl are listed as threatened.

There are at least 28 species of fish documented, including all five species of Pacific salmon: pink, chinook (king), sockeye, coho and chum. Various trout species including rainbow, lake and brook trout can be found as can the largemouth bass and longnose dace.

Seven species of reptiles and about a dozen species of amphibians have been documented. Reptiles such as the northern alligator lizard and the common garter snake and amphibians such as the western toad, Pacific giant salamander and rough-skinned newt reside in the park.

More than 500 species of insects have been recorded, including at least two dozen species of butterflies. Around 250 species of aquatic invertebrates can be found in the parks waterways.

=== Fire ===

In North Cascades National Park, fire was used by Native Americans in the region near present-day Ross Lake to clear out brush, to ease foot travel, and possibly to flush animals out of the foliage. Evidence found in the patterns of tree growth as well as from tree ring analysis indicates human-caused fires were created for many hundreds of years. Similar evidence is found in the Stehekin Valley, where both smaller low intensity fires and larger fires are suggested by the growth patterns and burn scars in tree ring evidence. The low-intensity fires that were likely human induced were only found in the easternmost regions of the park. In the subalpine regions such as the Thunder Creek area, the studies concluded fire occurs at frequencies ranging from 30¬†years to 400¬†years.

Across the entire North Cascades National Park Service Complex, between 1973 and 2003, there were 113 human-caused fires that burned , and 264 lightning-caused fires that burned . During this period, the largest fire consumed , mostly in Ross Lake National Recreation Area. North Cascades National Park Complex has three different zones with varying ratings for fire potential and severity. The park is managed as the Skagit Fire Management Unit (FMU) and has a low frequency of large natural fires that occur on average only every 50 to 400¬†years.

North Cascades National Park has a condition type that shows &quot;...natural (historical) range of variability of vegetation characteristics; fuel composition; fire frequency, severity and pattern; and other associated disturbances.&quot; This condition type, in keeping with the wilderness designation applied to most of the park, equates to a natural &quot;let it burn&quot; policy overall, so long as people and historical property are not threatened and the fire was lightning-caused. As part of the management plan, the few historic structures in the FMU are prioritized for fire protection including backcountry shelters like Beaver Pass Shelter, and fire lookouts such as Sourdough, Desolation and Copper lookout, all of which are on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Climate==

The Cascade Range is tall enough to cause a significant rain shadow on the eastern slopes. Annually, the western portions of the park receive more precipitation than the eastern sections. The higher precipitation in the west also correlates to increased snowfall with more measured in the west than the east annually. On the western slopes, snowfall depths range from in lower altitudes annually, increasing to at elevations between above sea level. Snow depths peak in early March and range from depending on altitude.

Snow covers the ground more than six months out of the year, even at lower elevations, and State Route 20, the only highway through the park, is generally closed from late November until late April. Numerous avalanche chutes, as many as traverse any state or federal highway, and including some over long, cross the highway and make snow removal during that period infeasible. Heavy snow and frequent avalanches are common, especially on the western slopes, from autumn to spring. The high elevation trails are generally open by mid-summer and the majority of tourism is between mid-June and late September. The east side of the park is generally warmer and drier, especially in the summer with highs reaching . Since the 1950s, there has been a five-degree Fahrenheit (2.77¬∞C) mean winter minimum temperature increase at elevations above . This has led to a reduced winter snowpack as the mean winter freezing level is now higher.

Overall the relative proximity of the Pacific Ocean moderates temperatures in the park, and it is warmer than other regions at a similar latitude farther inland.

=== Air and water quality ===

While North Cascades National Park is in a remote region for the most part, the prevailing westerly winds bring various pollutants into the park from the industrialized region around Puget Sound and the Fraser River Valley of British Columbia. These pollutants deposit onto plants and glaciers and are then carried by rainfall or ice melt and dispersed into rivers and lakes. The industrialized regions around Puget Sound and the Fraser River Valley have had a more noticeable negative impact on water and air quality than at Mount Rainier National Park well to the south due to the prevailing winds. Lakes at higher elevations show a higher level of acidity due to this phenomenon; the current and long-term impact on the ecosystem of the park has not yet been fully assessed.

Mercury and toxins from pesticides have been detected in the park, as has ozone; these have not been demonstrated to be at sufficient concentrations to greatly impact the ecosystem. Sulfur, nitrogen dioxide and ozone from factories and automobile emissions as well as increased dust and fine particulates from sources such as farming and construction are dispersed into the atmosphere, reducing long-range visibility. Visibilities of up to have been reduced to less than on the worst days due to the increased haze.

Climate change will impact the temperatures of high altitude lakes and streams, which in turn will have an effect on the fish that can thrive in these waters. Retreating glaciers reduce the amount of glacial ice melt available in warmer months that kept streams and lakes cold, even in late summer.

== Attractions ==

North Cascades National Park is approximately northeast of Seattle. Nearly all of the national park is protected as the Stephen Mather Wilderness and it is &quot;one of the premier wilderness parks&quot; in the lower-48 states&quot;. Unlike some national parks, there is no entrance fee at North Cascades, and hiking trailheads accessed by vehicle do not require a parking pass; trailheads on some national forest properties adjacent to the park may require a pass. Mount Shuksan, in the northwest corner of the park, is often photographed, and at is the second highest peak in the park.

=== Camping, hiking and bicycling ===

Hikers and backpackers often visit Cascade Pass in the southwestern section of the southern unit of the park, which was used as a travel route by Native Americans. The pass can be reached by a hiking trail accessed from a parking lot at the end of a gravel road that starts at Marblemount. There are nearly of hiking trails in the park. Hikers can also access two National Scenic Trails including of the Pacific Crest Trail in the southern unit of the park and of the Pacific Northwest Trail that passes through the northern unit. The north and south Picket Ranges, Mount Triumph, Eldorado Peak and Boston Peak regions are popular backcountry camping zones.

Unlike most US national parks, there are no places within North Cascades National Park where one can drive to a campground. There are many vehicular access camp grounds in Ross Lake National Recreation Area and in surrounding national forests. All overnight camping is considered backcountry camping and camping areas are protected to prevent overcrowding. Backcountry camping spots can be reserved in early spring only; walk-up permits can be obtained at the Wilderness Information Center near Marblemount. Since the vast majority of the park is designated wilderness, the goal is to ensure all hikers and backcountry travelers enjoy the opportunities for solitude. Group sizes are limited to parties of less than a dozen on what are known as trail and camping corridors, and in more remote areas off trails, groups larger than six are not permitted.

North Cascades National Park‚Äôs rugged terrain and limited access to drivable campgrounds make it particularly dangerous for inexperienced campers and hikers. The park has the highest death rate of any U.S. National Park, with 40.7% of fatalities resulting from falls. It is important to note that the park has gone over two decades without a fatal incident. The last recorded fatality was in September 2000, demonstrating that with proper preparation and caution, visitors can safely enjoy this beautiful wilderness.

Bicycles are allowed in the park but only on the same roads that vehicles are allowed on. No mountain bike access is allowed on hiking trails. Hiker/biker camping is available at Newhalem Campground, Colonial Creek, and near Stehekin.

=== Mountaineering ===

High quality climbing routes on the numerous cliffs, ice and other challenges make the park a favorite destination for many mountaineering enthusiasts. While some peaks and cliffs can be accessed fairly easily, the most remote ones entail a multi-day excursion, challenging for even experienced mountaineers. The park has banned the installation of any new fixed anchors such as pitons, and only removable anchors such as chocks and cams are permitted. This clean climbing has been implemented to help protect the resource, since fixed point anchors deface the rock and are considered intrusive.

With much of the rock climbing and mountaineering done above the tree line, the effort to protect alpine ecosystems is of paramount importance. Leave No Trace policies are strictly enforced and encouraged, such as camping only on bare rock, using only a camp stove, storing food safely where animals cannot get to it, and carrying out or properly burying human waste as necessary. Mountaineering in the North Cascades was first popularized by Fred Beckey; at age 15 he was the first to reach the summit of Sinister Peak in 1938, in 1939 he was the first atop Mount Despair, and the following year he was the first to climb Forbidden Peak. Beckey was the first to summit at least two dozen peaks in the North Cascades, and his exhaustive three-volume Cascade Alpine Guide books, first published in the early 1970s, have been called the &quot;Beckey Bible&quot;.

<text>The World Esperanto Youth Organization (, TEJO) is an organization dedicated to supporting young Esperanto speakers around the world and promote the use of Esperanto. TEJO was founded in 1938 as the &quot;Tutmonda Junular-Organizo&quot; (World Youth Organization) and took its current name in 1952. In 1956, TEJO became the youth section of the Universal Esperanto Association (UEA). In 1971, the finances and administration of TEJO were fully integrated into those of UEA.
==Activities==
TEJO is an organization for young Esperanto speakers. TEJO has individual members as well as member organizations. There are 42 member organizations, as well as 13 national organizations that TEJO has contact with but that are not members.

TEJO organizes an International Youth Congress (&quot;Internacia Junulara Kongreso&quot;) each year in a different location around the world. During the IJK there are concerts, presentations, excursions, and recreation, usually one week long and attended by a few hundred young people from several countries.

TEJO also publishes the Pasporta Servo, which is an international hospitality network of Esperanto speakers that accept Esperanto-speaking guests.

TEJO publishes &quot;Kontakto&quot;, a magazine aimed at beginners and youth.

TEJO organizes several youth seminars each year. These seminars bring together an international group of young people to discuss a current issue. Past seminars have focused on human rights, globalization, language problems on minority languages, intercomprehension and the Internet. The seminars last for one week.
== Timeline ==
*1920: World Esperantist Youth Association (TEJA) was established (and several years later &quot;fell asleep&quot;)
*1938: During the first International Youth Congress (IJK) in Groet, Netherlands, according to a decision of more than 200 participants from 10 countries the World Youth Organization (TJO) was born.
*1939: The second IJK took place in Tervuren, Belgium
*1947: TJO became a special section of the Universal Esperanto Association (UEA)
*1948: The organization &quot;Native Esperanto speakers&quot; became part of TJO. The third IJK took place in Ipswich, the United Kingdom and it&#x27;s taken place every year since then.
*1952: During the 8th IJK in Ry, Denmark, TJO became TEJO (the World Esperanto Youth Organization). In that period TEJO was going through a financial and structural crisis.
*1956: During the 12th IJK in B√ºsum, Germany, the committee of TEJO proposed that TEJO become the youth section and an integral part of UEA. A period of internal reorganization started.
*1960: The reorganization process was concluded during the 16th IJK in Rotterdam, Netherlands. TEJO opened itself to the outside world by starting cooperation with several non-Esperanto YNOs.
*1963: &quot;Kontakto&quot;, an international magazine of TEJO, was born. It continues to be published six times a year and is a magazine in Esperanto, but not about Esperanto.
*1964: PR became the focus of attention. Several brochures and flyers were published in national languages and special group for contacts with other youth organizations was established.
*1965: The first of a series of seminars was organized in Ljubljana, Yugoslavia (today Slovenia), with the goal of discussing the language problem and exchange experiences with different YNOs. Seminars soon also discussed more practical topics, such as exchange of experiences between generations and other issues of youth work.
*1966: At the same time as the most successful IJK took place (more than 900 young people participated), TEJO went through a serious financial crisis. TEJO became a correspondent member of the UNESCO&#x27;s Coordinating Committee for International Voluntary Service. In Argentina the &quot;Programme Passport&quot; was launched, which turned into &quot;Pasporta Servo&quot; (a network of Esperanto speakers around the globe willing to host other Esperanto speakers for a limited time, a forerunner of Couchsurfing) several years later
*1979: TEJO was accepted by the Geneva Informal Meeting, GIM.
*1980: TEJO organized its first seminar at the European Youth Centre in Strasbourg (EYC-S).
*1983: TEJO Tutmonde, another one of TEJO&#x27;s magazines, related to the organization itself, was launched.
*2017: The first international youth congress that took place in Africa, in Togo.
*2020: the first international youth congress that entirely took place in the internet, because of the Coronavirus crisis.

<doc id="45022" wikidata="Q1442189" url="?curid=45022" title="Natural transformation">
<text>In category theory, a branch of mathematics, a natural transformation provides a way of transforming one functor into another while respecting the internal structure (i.e., the composition of morphisms) of the categories involved. Hence, a natural transformation can be considered to be a &quot;morphism of functors&quot;. Informally, the notion of a natural transformation states that a particular map between functors can be done consistently over an entire category.

Indeed, this intuition can be formalized to define so-called functor categories. Natural transformations are, after categories and functors, one of the most fundamental notions of category theory and consequently appear in the majority of its applications.

==Definition==
If formula_1 and formula_2 are functors between the categories formula_3 and formula_4 (both from formula_3 to formula_6), then a natural transformation formula_7 from formula_1 to formula_2 is a family of morphisms that satisfies two requirements.
# The natural transformation must associate, to every object formula_10 in formula_3, a morphism formula_12 between objects of formula_4. The morphism formula_14 is called the component of formula_7 at formula_16.
# Components must be such that for every morphism formula_17 in formula_3 we have:

:::formula_19

The last equation can conveniently be expressed by the commutative diagram

If both formula_1 and formula_2 are contravariant, the vertical arrows in the right diagram are reversed. If formula_7 is a natural transformation from formula_1 to formula_24, we also write formula_25 or formula_26. This is also expressed by saying the family of morphisms formula_27 is natural in formula_16.

If, for every object formula_10 in formula_30, the morphism formula_14 is an isomorphism in formula_4, then formula_7 is said to be a (or sometimes natural equivalence or isomorphism of functors). Two functors formula_34 and formula_2 are called &quot;naturally isomorphic&quot; or simply &quot;isomorphic&quot; if there exists a natural isomorphism from formula_1 to formula_2.

An infranatural transformation formula_7 from formula_1 to formula_2 is simply a family of morphisms formula_41, for all formula_10 in formula_3. Thus a natural transformation is an infranatural transformation for which formula_44 for every morphism formula_45. The naturalizer of formula_46, natformula_47, is the largest subcategory of formula_3 containing all the objects of formula_3 on which formula_7 restricts to a natural transformation.

==Examples==

===Opposite group===

Statements such as
:&quot;Every group is naturally isomorphic to its opposite group&quot;
abound in modern mathematics. We will now give the precise meaning of this statement as well as its proof. Consider the category 
formula_51 of all groups with group homomorphisms as morphisms. If formula_52 is a group, we define 
its opposite group formula_53 as follows: formula_54 is the same set as formula_55, and the operation formula_56 is defined 
by formula_57. All multiplications in formula_58 are thus &quot;turned around&quot;. Forming the opposite group becomes 
a (covariant) functor from formula_51 to formula_51 if we define formula_61 for any group homomorphism formula_62. Note that 
formula_63 is indeed a group homomorphism from formula_54 to formula_65:
:formula_66
The content of the above statement is:
:&quot;The identity functor formula_67 is naturally isomorphic to the opposite functor formula_68&quot;
To prove this, we need to provide isomorphisms formula_69 for every group formula_55, such that the above diagram commutes. 
Set formula_71.
The formulas formula_72 and formula_73
show that formula_74 is a group homomorphism with inverse formula_75. To prove the naturality, we start with a group homomorphism 
formula_76 and show formula_77, i.e. 
formula_78 for all formula_79 in formula_55. This is true since 
formula_61 and every group homomorphism has the property formula_82.

===Modules===
Let formula_83 be an formula_84-module homomorphism of right modules. For every left module formula_85 there is a natural map formula_86, form a natural transformation formula_87. For every right module formula_85 there is a natural map formula_89 defined by formula_90, form a natural transformation formula_91.

===Abelianization===
Given a group formula_55, we can define its abelianization formula_93 formula_94. Let 
formula_95 denote the projection map onto the cosets of formula_94. This homomorphism is &quot;natural in 
formula_55&quot;, i.e., it defines a natural transformation, which we now check. Let formula_98 be a group. For any homomorphism formula_76, we have that 
formula_94 is contained in the kernel of formula_101, because any homomorphism into an abelian group kills the commutator subgroup. Then 
formula_101 factors through formula_103 as formula_104 for the unique homomorphism 
formula_105. This makes formula_106 a functor and 
formula_107 a natural transformation, but not a natural isomorphism, from the identity functor to formula_108.

=== Hurewicz homomorphism ===
Functors and natural transformations abound in algebraic topology, with the Hurewicz homomorphisms serving as examples. For any pointed topological space formula_109 and positive integer formula_110 there exists a group homomorphism

: formula_111

from the formula_110-th homotopy group of formula_109 to the formula_110-th homology group of formula_115. Both formula_116 and formula_117 are functors from the category Top* of pointed topological spaces to the category Grp of groups, and formula_118 is a natural transformation from formula_116 to formula_117.

===Determinant===
Given commutative rings formula_121 and formula_122 with a ring homomorphism formula_123, the respective groups of invertible formula_124 matrices formula_125 and formula_126 inherit a homomorphism which we denote by formula_127, obtained by applying formula_128 
to each matrix entry. Similarly, formula_128 restricts to a group homomorphism formula_130, where formula_131 denotes the group of units of formula_121. In fact, formula_133 and formula_134 are functors from the category of commutative rings formula_135 to formula_51. 
The determinant on the group formula_125, denoted by formula_138, is a group homomorphism 

: formula_139
which is natural in formula_121: because the determinant is defined by the same formula for every ring, formula_141 holds. This makes the determinant a natural transformation from formula_133 to formula_134.

===Double dual of a vector space===
For example, if formula_144 is a field, then for every vector space formula_145 over formula_144 we have a &quot;natural&quot; injective linear map formula_147 from the vector space into its double dual. These maps are &quot;natural&quot; in the following sense: the double dual operation is a functor, and the maps are the components of a natural transformation from the identity functor to the double dual functor.

===Finite calculus===
For every abelian group formula_55, the set formula_149 of functions from the integers to the underlying set of formula_55 
forms an abelian group formula_151 under pointwise addition. (Here formula_152 is the standard forgetful functor formula_153.) 
Given an formula_154 morphism formula_155, the map formula_156 given by left composing formula_157 with the elements of the former is itself a homomorphism of abelian groups; in this way we 
obtain a functor formula_158. The finite difference operator formula_159 taking each function 
formula_160 to formula_161 is a map from formula_151 to itself, and the collection formula_163 of such maps gives a natural transformation formula_164.

===Tensor-hom adjunction===

Consider the category formula_154 of abelian groups and group homomorphisms. For all abelian groups formula_115, formula_167 and formula_168 we have a group isomorphism
: formula_169.
These isomorphisms are &quot;natural&quot; in the sense that they define a natural transformation between the two involved functors formula_170.
(Here &quot;op&quot; is the opposite category of formula_154, not to be confused with the trivial opposite group functor on formula_154 !)

This is formally the tensor-hom adjunction, and is an archetypal example of a pair of adjoint functors. Natural transformations arise frequently in conjunction with adjoint functors, and indeed, adjoint functors are defined by a certain natural isomorphism. Additionally, every pair of adjoint functors comes equipped with two natural transformations (generally not isomorphisms) called the &quot;unit&quot; and &quot;counit&quot;.

== Unnatural isomorphism ==

The notion of a natural transformation is categorical, and states (informally) that a particular map between functors can be done consistently over an entire category. Informally, a particular map (esp. an isomorphism) between individual objects (not entire categories) is referred to as a &quot;natural isomorphism&quot;, meaning implicitly that it is actually defined on the entire category, and defines a natural transformation of functors; formalizing this intuition was a motivating factor in the development of category theory. 

Conversely, a particular map between particular objects may be called an unnatural isomorphism (or &quot;an isomorphism that is not natural&quot;) if the map cannot be extended to a natural transformation on the entire category. Given an object formula_173 a functor formula_55 (taking for simplicity the first functor to be the identity) and an isomorphism formula_175 proof of unnaturality is most easily shown by giving an automorphism formula_176 that does not commute with this isomorphism (so formula_177). More strongly, if one wishes to prove that formula_115 and formula_179 are not naturally isomorphic, without reference to a particular isomorphism, this requires showing that for &quot;any&quot; isomorphism formula_180, there is some formula_181 with which it does not commute; in some cases a single automorphism formula_181 works for all candidate isomorphisms formula_180 while in other cases one must show how to construct a different formula_184 for each isomorphism. The maps of the category play a crucial role ‚Äì any infranatural transform is natural if the only maps are the identity map, for instance.

This is similar (but more categorical) to concepts in group theory or module theory, where a given decomposition of an object into a direct sum is &quot;not natural&quot;, or rather &quot;not unique&quot;, as automorphisms exist that do not preserve the direct sum decomposition ‚Äì see for example.

Some authors distinguish notationally, using formula_185 for a natural isomorphism and formula_186 for an unnatural isomorphism, reserving formula_187 for equality (usually equality of maps).

===Example: fundamental group of torus===
As an example of the distinction between the functorial statement and individual objects, consider homotopy groups of a product space, specifically the fundamental group of the torus.

The homotopy groups of a product space are naturally the product of the homotopy groups of the components, formula_188 with the isomorphism given by projection onto the two factors, fundamentally because maps into a product space are exactly products of maps into the components ‚Äì this is a functorial statement.

However, the torus (which is abstractly a product of two circles) has fundamental group isomorphic to formula_189, but the splitting formula_190 is not natural. Note the use of formula_186, formula_185, and formula_193:
:formula_194
This abstract isomorphism with a product is not natural, as some isomorphisms of formula_195 do not preserve the product: the self-homeomorphism of formula_195 (thought of as the quotient space formula_197) given by formula_198 (geometrically a Dehn twist about one of the generating curves) acts as this matrix on formula_199 (it&#x27;s in the general linear group formula_200 of invertible integer matrices), which does not preserve the decomposition as a product because it is not diagonal. However, if one is given the torus as a product formula_201 ‚Äì equivalently, given a decomposition of the space ‚Äì then the splitting of the group follows from the general statement earlier. In categorical terms, the relevant category (preserving the structure of a product space) is &quot;maps of product spaces, namely a pair of maps between the respective components&quot;.

Naturality is a categorical notion, and requires being very precise about exactly what data is given ‚Äì the torus as a space that happens to be a product (in the category of spaces and continuous maps) is different from the torus presented as a product (in the category of products of two spaces and continuous maps between the respective components).

===Example: dual of a finite-dimensional vector space===
Every finite-dimensional vector space is isomorphic to its dual space, but there may be many different isomorphisms between the two spaces. There is in general no natural isomorphism between a finite-dimensional vector space and its dual space. However, related categories (with additional structure and restrictions on the maps) do have a natural isomorphism, as described below.

The dual space of a finite-dimensional vector space is again a finite-dimensional vector space of the same dimension, and these are thus isomorphic, since dimension is the only invariant of finite-dimensional vector spaces over a given field. However, in the absence of additional constraints (such as a requirement that maps preserve the chosen basis), the map from a space to its dual is not unique, and thus such an isomorphism requires a choice, and is &quot;not natural&quot;. On the category of finite-dimensional vector spaces and linear maps, one can define an infranatural isomorphism from vector spaces to their dual by choosing an isomorphism for each space (say, by choosing a basis for every vector space and taking the corresponding isomorphism), but this will not define a natural transformation. Intuitively this is because it required a choice, rigorously because &quot;any&quot; such choice of isomorphisms will not commute with, say, the zero map; see for detailed discussion.

Starting from finite-dimensional vector spaces (as objects) and the identity and dual functors, one can define a natural isomorphism, but this requires first adding additional structure, then restricting the maps from &quot;all linear maps&quot; to &quot;linear maps that respect this structure&quot;. Explicitly, for each vector space, require that it comes with the data of an isomorphism to its dual, formula_202. In other words, take as objects vector spaces with a nondegenerate bilinear form formula_203. This defines an infranatural isomorphism (isomorphism for each object). One then restricts the maps to only those maps formula_204 that commute with the isomorphisms: formula_205 or in other words, preserve the bilinear form: formula_206. (These maps define the &quot;naturalizer&quot; of the isomorphisms.) The resulting category, with objects finite-dimensional vector spaces with a nondegenerate bilinear form, and maps linear transforms that respect the bilinear form, by construction has a natural isomorphism from the identity to the dual (each space has an isomorphism to its dual, and the maps in the category are required to commute). Viewed in this light, this construction (add transforms for each object, restrict maps to commute with these) is completely general, and does not depend on any particular properties of vector spaces.

In this category (finite-dimensional vector spaces with a nondegenerate bilinear form, maps linear transforms that respect the bilinear form), the dual of a map between vector spaces can be identified as a transpose. Often for reasons of geometric interest this is specialized to a subcategory, by requiring that the nondegenerate bilinear forms have additional properties, such as being symmetric (orthogonal matrices), symmetric and positive definite (inner product space), symmetric sesquilinear (Hermitian spaces), skew-symmetric and totally isotropic (symplectic vector space), etc. ‚Äì in all these categories a vector space is naturally identified with its dual, by the nondegenerate bilinear form.

== Operations with natural transformations ==

=== Vertical composition ===

If formula_207 and formula_208 are natural transformations between functors formula_209, then we can compose them to get a natural transformation formula_210. 
This is done componentwise:
:formula_211. 

This vertical composition of natural transformations is associative and has an identity, and allows one to consider the collection of all functors formula_212 itself as a category (see below under Functor categories).
The identity natural transformation formula_213 on functor formula_214 has components formula_215.
:For formula_207, formula_217.

=== Horizontal composition ===

If formula_218 is a natural transformation between functors formula_219 and formula_220 is a natural transformation between functors formula_221, then the composition of functors allows a composition of natural transformations formula_222 with components
:formula_223.
By using whiskering (see below), we can write
:formula_224,
hence
:formula_225.

This horizontal composition of natural transformations is also associative with identity.
This identity is the identity natural transformation on the identity functor, i.e., the natural transformation that associate to each object its identity morphism: for object formula_115 in category formula_227, formula_228.
:For formula_218 with formula_219, formula_231.
As identity functors formula_232 and formula_233 are functors, the identity for horizontal composition is also the identity for vertical composition, but not vice versa.

=== Whiskering ===

Whiskering is an external binary operation between a functor and a natural transformation.

If formula_218 is a natural transformation between functors formula_219, and formula_236 is another functor, then we can form the natural transformation formula_237 by defining
:formula_238.
If on the other hand formula_239 is a functor, the natural transformation formula_240 is defined by
:formula_241.

It&#x27;s also an horizontal composition where one of the natural transformations is the identity natural transformation:
:formula_242 and formula_243.
Note that formula_244 (resp. formula_245) is generally not the left (resp. right) identity of horizontal composition formula_134 (formula_247 and formula_248 in general), except if formula_98 (resp. formula_144) is the identity functor of the category formula_251 (resp. formula_227).

=== Interchange law ===

The two operations are related by an identity which exchanges vertical composition with horizontal composition: if we have four natural transformations formula_253 as shown on the image to the right, then the following identity holds:
:formula_254.
Vertical and horizontal compositions are also linked through identity natural transformations:
:for formula_255 and formula_256, formula_257.

As whiskering is horizontal composition with an identity, the interchange law gives immediately the compact formulas of horizontal composition of formula_218 and formula_220 without having to analyze components and the commutative diagram:
:formula_260.

==Functor categories==
If formula_227 is any category and formula_262 is a small category, we can form the functor category formula_263 having as objects all functors from formula_262 to formula_227 and as morphisms the natural transformations between those functors. This forms a category since for any functor formula_214 there is an identity natural transformation formula_267 (which assigns to every object formula_115 the identity morphism on formula_269) and the composition of two natural transformations (the &quot;vertical composition&quot; above) is again a natural transformation.

The isomorphisms in formula_263 are precisely the natural isomorphisms. That is, a natural transformation formula_271 is a natural isomorphism if and only if there exists a natural transformation formula_272 such that formula_273 and formula_274.

The functor category formula_263 is especially useful if formula_262 arises from a directed graph. For instance, if formula_262 is the category of the directed graph , then formula_263 has as objects the morphisms of formula_227, and a morphism between formula_280 and formula_281 in formula_263 is a pair of morphisms formula_283 and formula_284 in formula_227 such that the &quot;square commutes&quot;, i.e. formula_286.

More generally, one can build the 2-category formula_287 whose
* 0-cells (objects) are the small categories,
* 1-cells (arrows) between two objects formula_227 and formula_251 are the functors from formula_227 to formula_251,
* 2-cells between two 1-cells (functors) formula_292 and formula_293 are the natural transformations from formula_214 to formula_55.
The horizontal and vertical compositions are the compositions between natural transformations described previously. A functor category formula_263 is then simply a hom-category in this category (smallness issues aside).

=== More examples ===
Every limit and colimit provides an example for a simple natural transformation, as a cone amounts to a natural transformation with the diagonal functor as domain. Indeed, if limits and colimits are defined directly in terms of their universal property, they are universal morphisms in a functor category.

==Yoneda lemma==
If formula_115 is an object of a locally small category formula_227, then the assignment formula_299 defines a covariant functor formula_300. This functor is called &quot;representable&quot; (more generally, a representable functor is any functor naturally isomorphic to this functor for an appropriate choice of formula_115). The natural transformations from a representable functor to an arbitrary functor formula_302 are completely known and easy to describe; this is the content of the Yoneda lemma.

== Historical notes ==

Saunders Mac Lane, one of the founders of category theory, is said to have remarked, &quot;I didn&#x27;t invent categories to study functors; I invented them to study natural transformations.&quot; Just as the study of groups is not complete without a study of homomorphisms, so the study of categories is not complete without the study of functors. The reason for Mac Lane&#x27;s comment is that the study of functors is itself not complete without the study of natural transformations.

The context of Mac Lane&#x27;s remark was the axiomatic theory of homology. Different ways of constructing homology could be shown to coincide: for example in the case of a simplicial complex the groups defined directly would be isomorphic to those of the singular theory. What cannot easily be expressed without the language of natural transformations is how homology groups are compatible with morphisms between objects, and how two equivalent homology theories not only have the same homology groups, but also the same morphisms between those groups.

<doc id="45028" wikidata="Q1134220" url="?curid=45028" title="Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus'">
<text>The Mongol Empire invaded and conquered much of Kievan Rus&#x27; in the mid-13th century, sacking numerous cities such as Ryazan, Yaroslavl, Pereyaslavl and Vladimir, including the largest: Kiev (50,000 inhabitants) and Chernigov (30,000 inhabitants). The siege of Kiev in 1240 by the Mongols is generally held to mark the end of the state of Kievan Rus&#x27;, which had already been undergoing fragmentation. Many other principalities and urban centres in the northwest and southwest escaped complete destruction or suffered little to no damage from the Mongol invasion, including Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia, Pskov, Smolensk, Polotsk, Vitebsk, and probably Rostov and Uglich.

The campaign was heralded by the Battle of the Kalka River in May 1223, which resulted in a Mongol victory over the forces of several principalities as well as the remnants of the Cumans under K√∂ten. The Mongols retreated, having gathered their intelligence, which was the purpose of the reconnaissance-in-force. A full-scale invasion by Batu Khan followed, with most of Kievan Rus&#x27; overran in 1237‚Äì1238. The Mongols captured Kiev in 1240 and moved west into Hungary and Poland.

The invasion was ended by the Mongol succession process upon the death of √ñgedei Khan. Even those principalities who avoided physical conquest, were eventually forced to accept Mongol supremacy in the form of tribute ‚Äì as in the case of Galicia-Volhynia, Polotsk and Novgorod ‚Äì if not outright vassalage, of the Golden Horde, until well into the 14th century. Although a Russian army defeated the Mongols at the Battle of Kulikovo in 1380, the Mongolian demands of tribute from Russian princes continued until about 1480.

==Background==

The Mongols had plans to conquer Eastern Europe long before Batu&#x27;s campaign in 1237. In 1207, Genghis Khan sent his eldest son Jochi to conquer the tribes north of the Selenga River and in the Irtysh valley, which included the lands of Eastern Europe in the Jochi Ulus. However, these plans were not implemented during the lifetime of Genghis Khan. In 1222‚Äì1224, Subutai and Jebe conducted a campaign with a 30,000-strong army in Transcaucasia and Southeastern Europe, which is traditionally considered as a reconnaissance. However, the Secret History and Rashid ad-Din state that the purpose of this campaign was to be supported by the forces of Jochi and included Cumania, Alania, Hungary, and Rus&#x27;, including Kiev. The kurultai of 1235, after which the invasion of Europe took place, repeated these goals. The campaign of Subutai and his 30,000 troops to the Caspian steppes was a new step in the conquest of Eastern Europe, and it began in the late 1220s. In 1235, a kurultai was convened to outline a general Mongol campaign, in which the troops of other uluses (clans or tribes) were to take part. √ñgedei sent Batu, B√ºri, M√∂ngke, and other princes on a campaign to help Subutai, and each Chingizid led with him one or more tumens of the army. The Mongols prepared for an offensive in 1235 and early 1236 and subjugated the Bashkir tribes, who were forced to allocate several detachments to the Mongol army. The Mongols concentrated in the Caspian steppes in the autumn of 1236 under the general leadership of Jochi&#x27;s son Batu. The first blow of the united Chingizid army hit the Volga Bulgaria.

The Mongols (called &quot;Tartars&quot; in contemporary accounts) had already defeated a united Rus&#x27; army led by Mstislav the Bold and Mstislav Romanovich the Old on 1 April 1223, at the Battle of the Kalka River. In 1237, they besieged and took Ryazan, and Vladimir fell in early February 1238. &quot;For our sins&quot;, wrote a chronicler, &quot;unknown nations arrived. No one knew their origin or whence they came, or what religion they practiced. That is known only to God, and perhaps to wise men learned in books&quot;. Although this defeat left the principalities at the mercy of invaders, the Mongol or Tartar forces retreated and did not reappear for another 13 years, during which time the princes of Rus&#x27; went on quarreling and fighting as before, until they were startled by a new and much more formidable invading force. In &quot;The Secret History of the Mongols&quot;, the only reference to this early battle is:

&quot;The Secret History of the Mongols&quot; reports that √ñgedei sent Batu, B√ºri, M√∂ngke, and many other princes on a campaign to help Subutai, who was facing a strong resistance from various peoples and cities under Genghis Khan&#x27;s command. The list of Genghisides who participated in the campaign is present in works such as &quot;The Secret Legend&quot;, &quot;Yuan Shi&quot;, and &quot;Jami&#x27; al-tawarikh.&quot; In addition to Batu, other Chingizids who participated in the campaign included the sons of Jochi, Orda, Shiban, Tangkut and Berke; the son of Chagatai, Baidar, and the grandson of Chagatai, B√ºri; the sons of √ñgedei, G√ºy√ºk and Kadan; the sons of Tolui, M√∂ngke and Ariq B√∂ke; the son of Genghis Khan, K√ºlkhan, and the grandson of Genghis Khan&#x27;s brother, Argasun. In 1235 and early 1236, the assembled army prepared for an offensive, and then subjugated the Bashkir tribes, who were forced to allocate several detachments to the Mongol army. In the autumn of 1236, the Mongols concentrated in the Caspian steppes under the general leadership of Jochi&#x27;s son Batu.

The first blow of the united Chingizid army hit the Volga Bulgaria. Until the mid-1220s, the Volga Bulgaria was in constant conflict with the Vladimir-Suzdal and Murom-Ryazan principalities. The parties undertook campaigns, there were constant skirmishes, the victories in which were mainly won by Rus&#x27; troops. However, with the appearance of the Mongols at their borders, the Bulgars began to seek peace, which was met with understanding and support from the Rus&#x27; princes. Over the course of several years, the Rus&#x27; and the Bulgars normalized relations, which allowed the Volga Bulgaria to devote all its forces to preparing to repel the alleged Mongol invasion. Ramparts were created in the forests that covered the main cities, the cities themselves were fortified, and the garrisons increased. However, all these measures were in vain ‚Äì the Volga Bulgaria was defeated with lightning speed and completely conquered by the spring of 1237.

The next stage of the campaign was an attack on the Cumans and Alans. From the Lower Volga region, the Mongols moved on a broad front to the mouth of the Don, where another concentration of troops took place. The offensive continued until the autumn of 1237 and ended with the defeat of the Cumans and Alans. After that, the Mongols conquered the lands of the Burtas, Mokshas, and Erzyas. The grandiose Zolotarevskoe battle took place near a strategic crossing over the Sura. According to the historian Vadim Kargalov (1932-2009), the fighting in 1237 was undertaken to create a springboard for a campaign against Rus&#x27;. By the end of the year, a huge Mongol army and detachments allied with Batu stood on the borders of Russia. Preparations for a winter campaign against Northeastern Rus&#x27; by the Mongols began in the autumn of 1237. Their troops were grouped near Voronezh, and detachments that had previously fought with the Cumans and Alans were drawn there.

==Invasion of Batu Khan==

The vast Mongolian Great Khanate army of around 120,000 mounted archers, commanded by Batu Khan and Subutai, crossed the Volga River and invaded Volga Bulgaria in late 1236. It took them only a month to extinguish the resistance of the Volga Bulgars, the Cumans-Kipchaks and the Alans.

Immediately prior to the invasion, Friar Julian from Hungary had travelled to the eastern border of the Rus&#x27; and learned of the Mongol army, which was waiting for the onset of winter so that they could cross the frozen rivers and swamps. In his letter to the Pope&#x27;s legate in Hungary, Julian described meeting Mongol messengers who had been detained by Yuri II of Vladimir on their way to Hungary. Yuri II gave their letter to Julian.

In November 1237, Batu Khan sent his envoys to the court of Yuri II and demanded his submission. According to the Laurentian Codex, the Mongols actually came seeking peace, but Yuri II treated them with disdain:

Regardless of what impression Yuri II may have given the Mongol delegations, of which several are mentioned, he did his best to avoid direct conflict. He sent them away with what were described as gifts, which were essentially tribute or bribes to keep them from invading.

The Mongols attacked from several directions. One section attacked Suzdal, one from the Volga, and another from the south towards Ryazan. According to Rashid al-Din Hamadani, the Siege of Ryazan was conducted by Batu, Orda, G√ºy√ºk, M√∂ngke, Kulkan, Kadan, and B√ºri. The city fell after three days. Alarmed by the news, Yuri II sent his sons to detain the invaders, but they were defeated and ran for their lives. Yuri II also fled Vladimir for Yaroslavl.

Having burnt down Kolomna and Moscow, the horde laid siege to Vladimir on 4 February 1238. Three days later, the capital of Vladimir-Suzdal was taken and burnt to the ground. The royal family perished in the fire, while the grand prince retreated northward. Crossing the Volga, Vladimir mustered a new army, which was encircled and totally annihilated by the Mongols in the Battle of the Sit River on 4 March.

Thereupon Batu Khan divided his army into smaller units, which ransacked fourteen cities of northeastern Rus&#x27;: Rostov, Uglich, Yaroslavl, Kostroma, Kashin, Ksnyatin, Gorodets, Galich, Pereslavl-Zalessky, Yuryev-Polsky, Dmitrov, Volokolamsk, Tver, and Torzhok. Chinese siege engines were used by the Mongols under Tolui to raze the walls of many cities. The most difficult to take was the small town of Kozelsk, whose boy-prince Vasily, son of Titus Mstislavich, and inhabitants resisted the Mongols for seven weeks, killing 4,000. As the story goes, at the news of the Mongol approach, the whole town of Kitezh with all its inhabitants was submerged into a lake, where, as legend has it, it may be seen to this day. Major principalities and urban centres which escaped destruction or suffered little to no damage from the Mongol invasion included Novgorod, Pskov, Smolensk, Polotsk, Vitebsk, and probably Rostov and Uglich. The Mongols planned to advance on Novgorod, but the principality was spared the fate of its brethren by the decision to preemptively surrender. In mid-1238, Batu Khan devastated the Crimea and pacified Mordovia. In the winter of 1239, he sacked Chernigov and Pereyaslavl.

While Kiev and its grand prince was still formally acknowledged as senior amongst the principalities of Rus&#x27;, frequent internecine dynastic feuding among rival claimants had left the city weakened. Indeed, by the time Kiev fell to the Mongols, the head of the city&#x27;s defenses owed allegiance to Prince Daniel of the Principality of Galicia-Volhynia. Prince Daniel had taken Kiev under his protection the previous year by arrangement with Prince Michael of Kiev, who fled after originally resisting the Mongols, then losing to them his main stronghold, Chernigov.

The Mongols approach on Kiev in November 1240 apparently made a grim impression upon its defenders. The chronicler writes: ‚ÄúAnd nothing could be heard above the squeaking of his carts, the bawling of his [Batu‚Äôs] innumerable camels, and the neighing of his herds of horses, and the Land of Rus‚Äô was full of enemies.&quot; After many days of siege, the horde stormed Kiev in December 1240. The city was ransacked and pillaged immensely, although the building of St. Sophia Cathedral survived intact. Historian Serhii Plokhy relates the description of one Giovanni da Pian del Carpine, an ambassador of Pope Innocent IV who passed through Kiev six years later: &quot;When we were journeying through that land, we came across countless skulls and bones of dead men lying about on the ground&quot;.

Batu Khan&#x27;s forces went on to ravage much of Galicia-Volhynia, despite Daniel&#x27;s fierce resistance. The Tartars then resolved to &quot;reach the ultimate sea&quot;, where they could proceed no further and invaded Hungary (under Batu Khan) and Poland (under Baidar and Kaidu). Batu Khan captured Pest, and then on Christmas Day 1241, Esztergom.

The principalities became part of the Jochid appanage ruled by Batu. Batu sited a semi-nomadic capital, called Sarai or Sarai Batu (Batu&#x27;s Palaces), on the lower Volga. The Jochid appanage came to be known as the Golden Horde.

==Legacy==
===Impact on development===
Giovanni da Pian del Carpine, the pope&#x27;s envoy to the Mongol Great Khan, traveled through Kiev in February 1246 and wrote:

The influence of the Mongol invasion on the territories was uneven. Colin McEvedy estimates the population dropped from 7.5 million prior to the invasion to seven million afterwards. Centres such as Kiev took centuries to rebuild and recover from the devastation of the initial attack. The Novgorod Republic continued to prosper, and a new entity, the Principality of Moscow, began to flourish under the Mongols.

Moscow&#x27;s eventual dominance in northeastern Rus&#x27; was in large part attributable to the Mongols. Moscow drew people and wealth, developed trade links, and established an autocratic political system which exerted a powerful influence on Russian society. After the prince of Tver led an uprising in 1327, the rival prince Ivan I of Moscow joined the Mongols in crushing Tver and devastating its lands. By doing so, he eliminated his rival, allowed the Russian Orthodox Church to move its headquarters to Moscow, and was granted the title of Grand Prince by the Mongols.

As such, the Muscovite prince became the chief intermediary between the Mongol overlords and the Russian princes, which paid further dividends for Moscow&#x27;s rulers. In the 14th century, the Muscovite princes began &quot;gathering Russian lands&quot; to increase its population and wealth. While the Mongols often raided other territories, they tended to respect the lands controlled by their principal collaborator. This, in turn, attracted nobles and their servants who sought to settle in the relatively secure and peaceful lands of Moscow. Although a Russian army defeated the Golden Horde at the Battle of Kulikovo in 1380, the Mongol domination of Russian-inhabited territories, with the requisite demands of tribute, continued until the Great Stand on the Ugra River in 1480.

====Decline of cities====
The invasion had significant consequences on the population. Many cities and fortified points were wiped out, with only a fraction surviving. The once flourishing cities of Kiev, Novgorod, and Vladimir suffered a sharp decline, with their populations shrinking to a fraction of what they were before the invasion. For example, Kiev, which had around 50,000 people, had only about 200 houses left after the invasion, according to the papal legate Giovanni da Pian del Carpine.

The decline of cities was also accompanied by a decline in culture, crafts, and trade. The pre-Mongol period was considered the heyday of culture, crafts, and trade in ancient Rus&#x27;, but after the invasion, many cities fell into decay, and stone construction was halted for a long time. Economic ties between cities and surrounding villages were severed, and it took more than 100 years for Russian cities to recover from the invasion of Batu Khan and its consequences.

The destruction of cities and the decline in culture and economy had long-term consequences for Russia. The country was left behind in terms of economic development. The Mongol-Tatar invasion also had a significant impact on Russia&#x27;s political development, as it paved the way for the emergence of the centralized Moscow state, which gradually absorbed other principalities and became the dominant power in Russia. Overall, the invasion of Batu Khan had a profound and lasting impact on the history of Russia.

==== Economic setbacks ====
Stone construction in Russian cities practically ceased for several decades. The production of complex crafts, such as glass jewelry, Cloisonn√© enamel, niello, granulation, and polychrome glazed ceramics stopped. As a result, the Russian handicraft industry regressed several centuries, while the guild industry in the West progressed to the era of primitive accumulation. The Russian handicraft industry had to reacquire the gains that had been made before the invasion.

====Population migration====
As a result of the invasion many people were forced to flee in front of the advancing tumens of Batu, and in northeastern Rus&#x27;, residents of the Vladimir-Suzdal and Ryazan principalities sought refuge in more northern lands beyond the Volga. Others fled to sparsely populated areas, taking refuge in dense forests. However, after the departure of the Mongol-Tatars, most of them returned to their former places of residence.

In fact, just a year after the fall of the Vladimir-Suzdal principality, the number of returnees was so great that Prince Yaroslav Yaroslavich was able to gather a large army among them for a campaign against the Lithuanians. Meanwhile, the inhabitants of South Russia&#x27;s principalities, such as Kiev, Pereyaslav, and Chernigov, fled to northeastern Russia immediately after the invasion.

However, this was not the end of population migrations. Vladimir, Suzdal, Pereslavl-Zalessky, and other cities of northeastern Rus&#x27; were repeatedly targeted by Mongol-Tatar campaigns in the second half of the 13th century. As a result, many of their inhabitants gradually moved either to the vicinity of Moscow and Tver, or to the north in regions such as Yaroslavl, Galich, Veliky, Ustyug, and more.

===Influence on society===
Historians have debated the long-term influence of Mongol rule on society. The Mongols have been blamed for the destruction of Kievan Rus&#x27; and the breakup of a &quot;Russian&quot; nationality into three components, and the introduction of the concept of &quot;oriental despotism&quot; into Russia. However, most historians agree that Kievan Rus&#x27; was not a homogenous entity in a political, cultural, or ethnic sense, and that the invasions only accelerated the period of feudal fragmentation that had begun prior to the invasions. Historians also credit the Mongol regime with an important role in the development of Muscovy as a state. Under Mongol occupation, for example, Muscovy developed its &quot;mestnichestvo&quot; hierarchy, postal road network (based on Mongolian &quot;ortoo&quot; system, known in Russian as &quot;yam&quot;, hence the terms &quot;yamshchik&quot;, &quot;Yamskoy Prikaz&quot;, etc.), census, fiscal system and military organization.

The period of Mongol rule over the former Rus&#x27; polities included significant cultural and interpersonal contacts between the Slavic and Mongolian ruling classes. By 1450, the Tatar language had become fashionable in the court of the Grand Prince of Moscow, Vasily II, who was accused of excessive love of the Tatars and their speech, and many Russian noblemen adopted Tatar surnames (for example, a member of the Veliamanov family adopted the Turkic name &quot;Aksak&quot; and his descendants were the Aksakovs).

Many Russian boyar (noble) families traced their descent from the Mongols or Tatars, including Veliaminov-Zernov, Godunov, Arseniev, Bakhmetev, Bulgakov (descendants of Bulgak) and Chaadaev (descendants of Genghis Khan&#x27;s son Chagatai Khan). In a survey of Russian noble families of the 17th century, over 15% of the Russian noble families had Tatar or Oriental origins.

The Mongols brought about changes in the economic power of states and overall trade. In the religious sphere, St. Paphnutius of Borovsk was the grandson of a Mongol baskak, or tax collector, while a nephew of Khan Bergai of the Golden Horde converted to Christianity and became known as the monk St. Peter Tsarevich of the Horde.

In the judicial sphere, under Mongol influence capital punishment, which during the times of Kievan Rus&#x27; had only been applied to slaves, became widespread, and the use of torture became a regular part of criminal procedure. Specific punishments introduced in Moscow included beheading for alleged traitors and branding of thieves (with execution for a third arrest).

Donald Ostrowski argues that Muscovy&#x27;s adoption of Mongol institutions and practices may demonstrate the pragmatism of the Muscovite leaders, which enabled them to eventually &quot;triumph over their competitors in northeastern Rus&#x27;&quot;.

== Historiography ==
According to Charles J. Halperin (2011), Fomenko and Nosovskii&#x27;s popular pseudohistorical &quot;Novaia khronologiia&quot; (New Chronology), which received some attention in the early 1980s, arose out of &quot;the dilemma of the Mongol conquest in Russian historiography&quot;: embarrassment among defensive Russian nationalists who object to &quot;Russophobic&quot; arguments that Russia acquired &quot;barbarian&quot; customs, institutions, and culture from uncivilized nomads.

<text>Dordogne ( , ; ; ) is a large rural department in south west France, with its prefecture in P√©rigueux. Located in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region roughly half-way between the Loire Valley and the Pyrenees, it is named after the river Dordogne, which runs through it. It corresponds roughly to the ancient county of P√©rigord. In January 2023, Dordogne had a population of 412,807.

==History==

The county of P√©rigord dates back to when the area was inhabited by ancient celtic Gaulish tribes. It was originally home to four tribes, and since &quot;four tribes&quot; in the Gaulish language is &quot;Petrocore&quot;, the area eventually became known as the county of Le P√©rigord. Its inhabitants became known as the P√©rigordins (or P√©rigourdins), and there are four P√©rigords in the Dordogne.
* P√©rigord Vert (Green P√©rigord), with its main town of Nontron, consists of verdant valleys in a region crossed by many rivers and streams.
* P√©rigord Blanc (White P√©rigord), situated around the department&#x27;s capital of P√©rigueux, is a region of limestone plateaux, wide valleys, and meadows.
* P√©rigord Pourpre (Purple P√©rigord) with its capital of Bergerac, is a wine region.
* P√©rigord Noir (Black P√©rigord) surrounding the administrative center of Sarlat, overlooks the valleys of the V√©z√®re and the Dordogne, and takes its name from the nearby oak and pine forests.

The Petrocores took part in the resistance against the Roman occupation of France. Concentrated in a few major sites are the vestiges of the Gallo-Roman period ‚Äì the gigantic ruined tower and arenas in P√©rigueux (formerly Vesone), the P√©rigord museum&#x27;s archaeological collections, villa remains in Montcaret, and the Roman tower of La Rigale Castle in Villetoureix. The earliest &quot;cluzeaux&quot; (artificial caves either above or below ground) can be found throughout the Dordogne. These subterranean refuges and lookout huts were large enough to shelter entire local populations. According to Julius Caesar, the Gauls took refuge in these caves during the resistance.

After Guienne province was transferred to the English Crown under the Plantagenets following the remarriage of Eleanor of Aquitaine in 1152, Perigord was transferred to English suzerainty. Being situated at the boundaries of influence of the monarchies of France and England, it oscillated between the two dynasties for more than three hundred years of struggle until the end of the Hundred Years&#x27; War in 1453. The county was torn apart, which modeled its physiognomy.

During the calmer periods of the late 15th and early 16th centuries, the Castillon plain on the banks of the Dordogne saw developments in urban architecture. Fine Gothic and Renaissance residences were constructed in P√©rigueux, Bergerac, and Sarlat. In the countryside, the nobility erected the majority of more than 1200 chateaux, manors and country houses. In the second half of the 16th century, however, as war waged in the region, attacks, pillaging, and fires of the Wars of Religion reached a pinnacle of violence, which was partly focused on P√©rigord. At the time, Bergerac was one of the most powerful Huguenot strongholds, along with La Rochelle. Following these wars, P√©rigord, fief of Henry of Navarre, was to return to the Crown for good and would continue to suffer from the various political changes of the French nation, from the Revolution to the dark days of the French Resistance.

Associated with the region are several important literary figures: Arnaut Daniel, Bertran de Born, Michel de Montaigne, √âtienne de La Bo√©tie, Brant√¥me, Fenelon, Maine de Biran, Eugene Le Roy, and Andr√© Maurois; as well as Talleyrand, Saint-Exup√©ry and Biron.

In addition to its castles, chateaux, churches, bastides, and cave fortresses, the P√©rigord region has preserved a number of ancient villages which retain their market halls, dovecotes, bories (stone huts), and abbeys. Saint-L√©on-sur-V√©z√®re, Connezac, Saint-Jean-de-C√¥le, La Roque-Gageac, and many others contain important and visually interesting architectural examples. The old quarters of P√©rigueux or Bergerac have been restored and developed into pedestrian areas. A number of small towns, such as Brant√¥me, Issigeac, Eymet and Mareuil, have withstood the changes of modern times. A special mention should be made in this respect to Sarlat and its Black P√©rigord area.

Dordogne is one of the original 83 departments created on 4 March 1790 during the French Revolution. It was created from the former province of P√©rigord, the county of P√©rigord. Its borders continued to change over subsequent decades.

:In 1793 the communes of Boisseuilh, Coubjours, G√©nis, Payzac, Saint-Cyr-les-Champagnes, Saint-Mesmin, Salagnac, Savignac, Saint-Tri√© and Teillots were transferred from Corr√®ze to Dordogne.
:In 1794 Dordogne ceded Cavarc to Lot-et-Garonne. Later in 1794 (albeit during the subsequent year under the Republican Calendar in use at the time), Dordogne gained Parcoul from Charente-Inf√©rieure.
:Following the restoration, in 1819, the commune of Bonrepos was suppressed and merged with the adjacent commune of Souillac in Lot.
In 1870 the region was witness to the tragic Hautefaye incident, which occurred shortly after France&#x27;s declaration of war against Prussia. A young aristocrat named Alain de Mon√©ys was brutally tortured and then burned alive, by a crowd of between 300 and 800 people on 16 August in a public square in the village of Hautefaye in the north-west region of the department. Details of the incident are gruesome, but remain unclear: the leading participants appear to have been drunk. Additionally, since the incident occurred prior to the introduction of mass education, most of the witnesses would have been unable (and possibly unwilling) to write down what they had seen. But at some stage the victim died, and following a trial four individuals identified as culpable were in turn condemned to die by guillotine. The sentence was carried out in the same public square on 13 February 1885.

It was suggested that the victim had reported some (bad) news regarding the ongoing war in a way that implied support for the enemy, although subsequently it became clear that his patriotic credentials were beyond reproach. It was also suggested that the mob had been antagonized when he called out, &quot;Vive la R√©publique!&quot; (Long live the republic) at a time when the patriotic villagers valued the imperial regime, which Parisian revolutionaries were in the process of destroying. This incident has been studied by historian Alain Corbin, among others.

==Geography==
The department is part of the region of Nouvelle-Aquitaine and is surrounded by the six d√©partements of Haute-Vienne, Corr√®ze, Lot, Lot-et-Garonne, Gironde, Charente-Maritime, and Charente. Dordogne is the third-largest department of metropolitan France. In total area, it is larger than Cyprus and smaller than Cape Verde.

===Principal towns===

The most populous commune is P√©rigueux, the prefecture. As of 2019 there are 9 communes with more than 5,000 inhabitants:

==Demographics==

The population peaked at 505,789 in 1851 according to that year&#x27;s census. After that the population declined to 373,000 by 1975. This reflected the long term population decline observed in many of the rural departments resulting from changes in agriculture and the lure of higher industrial wages available in more urbanized regions. Between 1975 and 2010, the population increased again, reaching 415,000.

Dordogne has a British immigrant community. The region has between 5,000 and 10,000 British residents and 800 British entrepreneurs, drawn by the French lifestyle, warm climate, and lower cost of living. The village of Eymet is at the heart of the trend, with 200 British families among 2,600 inhabitants.

==Politics==

The President of the Departmental Council is Germinal Peiro of the Socialist Party.
===Current National Assembly Representatives===

<text>A [[Straw man (dummy)|straw-man]] (or straw-dog or straw-person) proposal is a brainstormed simple draft proposal intended to generate discussion of its disadvantages and to spur the generation of new and better proposals. The term is considered American business jargon, but it is also encountered in engineering office culture.

Often, a straw man document will be prepared by one or two people prior to kicking off a larger project. In this way, the team can jump start their discussions with a document that is likely to contain many, but not all, of the key aspects to be discussed. As the document is revised, it may be given other edition names such as the more solid-sounding &quot;stone-man&quot;, &quot;iron-man&quot;, and so on.

==Origins==
The expression was already in use in the United States Department of Defense circa 1975 in their Large Organization Model Building paradigm (LOMB) and was apparently in use with this meaning (initial proposal) in the United States Air Force before that. The succession of names comes from the requirements document for the programming language Ada. In the High Order Language Working Group (HOLWG) the process to define Ada generated requirements documents sporting different names, representing the various stages of development of the Ada language, as described in 1993 by Col William Whitaker in an article &quot;ACM SIGPLAN Notices&quot;. They are:

*STRAWMAN issued in April 1975
*WOODENMAN issued in August 1975
*TINMAN issued in January 1976
*IRONMAN issued in January 1977 (revised in July 1977)
*SANDMAN not published but circulated in January 1978
*STEELMAN issued in June 1978
*PEBBLEMAN issued in July 1978
*PEBBLEMAN Revised and issued in January 1979
*STONEMAN issued in February 1980

Other references include &quot;The Ada Environment&quot;, LTC Rodney A. Edge, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Washington, DC 20307, Thomas A. Marciniak, M.D., National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20205 

==Software development==
In software development, a crude plan or document may serve as the strawman or starting point in the evolution of a project. The strawman is not expected to be the last word; it is refined until a final model or document is obtained that resolves all issues concerning the scope and nature of the project. In this context, a strawman can take the form of an outline, a set of charts, a presentation, or a paper.

The ‚ÄòStraw Man‚Äô also fits in neatly with the concept of iterative design, repeating and re-drafting to improve an initial concept or design. If anything is built, often, it may not end up in the final product. It might be that the decision is to not continue at all, in which case, the ‚ÄòStraw Man‚Äô approach may have saved a lot of wasted work in the long run. Or, the final approach may be very different from the first model. Either way, the ‚ÄòStraw Man‚Äô will have proven its worth by having re-directed the approach before any significant work is undertaken.

<text>In statistics, the likelihood-ratio test is a hypothesis test that involves comparing the goodness of fit of two competing statistical models, typically one found by maximization over the entire parameter space and another found after imposing some constraint, based on the ratio of their likelihoods. If the more constrained model (i.e., the null hypothesis) is supported by the observed data, the two likelihoods should not differ by more than sampling error. Thus the likelihood-ratio test tests whether this ratio is significantly different from one, or equivalently whether its natural logarithm is significantly different from zero.

The likelihood-ratio test, also known as Wilks test, is the oldest of the three classical approaches to hypothesis testing, together with the Lagrange multiplier test and the Wald test. In fact, the latter two can be conceptualized as approximations to the likelihood-ratio test, and are asymptotically equivalent. In the case of comparing two models each of which has no unknown parameters, use of the likelihood-ratio test can be justified by the Neyman‚ÄìPearson lemma. The lemma demonstrates that the test has the highest power among all competitors.

==Definition==
===General===
Suppose that we have a statistical model with parameter space formula_1. A null hypothesis is often stated by saying that the parameter formula_2 lies in a specified subset formula_3 of formula_1. The alternative hypothesis is thus that formula_2 lies in the complement of formula_3, i.e. in formula_7, which is denoted by formula_8. The likelihood ratio test statistic for the null hypothesis formula_9 is given by:

:formula_10

where the quantity inside the brackets is called the likelihood ratio. Here, the formula_11 notation refers to the supremum. As all likelihoods are positive, and as the constrained maximum cannot exceed the unconstrained maximum, the likelihood ratio is bounded between zero and one.

Often the likelihood-ratio test statistic is expressed as a difference between the log-likelihoods
:formula_12
where 
: formula_13
is the logarithm of the maximized likelihood function formula_14, and formula_15 is the maximal value in the special case that the null hypothesis is true (but not necessarily a value that maximizes formula_14 for the sampled data) and
:formula_17
denote the respective arguments of the maxima and the allowed ranges they&#x27;re embedded in. Multiplying by ‚àí2 ensures mathematically that (by Wilks&#x27; theorem) formula_18 converges asymptotically to being ¬≤-distributed if the null hypothesis happens to be true. The finite-sample distributions of likelihood-ratio statistics are generally unknown.

The likelihood-ratio test requires that the models be nested ‚Äì i.e. the more complex model can be transformed into the simpler model by imposing constraints on the former&#x27;s parameters. Many common test statistics are tests for nested models and can be phrased as log-likelihood ratios or approximations thereof: e.g. the &quot;Z&quot;-test, the &quot;F&quot;-test, the &quot;G&quot;-test, and Pearson&#x27;s chi-squared test; for an illustration with the one-sample &quot;t&quot;-test, see below.

If the models are not nested, then instead of the likelihood-ratio test, there is a generalization of the test that can usually be used: for details, see &quot;relative likelihood&quot;.

===Case of simple hypotheses===

A simple-vs.-simple hypothesis test has completely specified models under both the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis, which for convenience are written in terms of fixed values of a notional parameter formula_2:

:formula_20
In this case, under either hypothesis, the distribution of the data is fully specified: there are no unknown parameters to estimate. For this case, a variant of the likelihood-ratio test is available:

:formula_21

Some older references may use the reciprocal of the function above as the definition. Thus, the likelihood ratio is small if the alternative model is better than the null model.

The likelihood-ratio test provides the decision rule as follows:

:If formula_22, do not reject formula_23;
:If formula_24, reject formula_23;
:If formula_26, reject formula_23 with probability formula_28.
The values formula_29 and formula_30 are usually chosen to obtain a specified significance level formula_31, via the relation
:formula_28 formula_33
The Neyman‚ÄìPearson lemma states that this likelihood-ratio test is the most powerful among all level formula_31 tests for this case.

==Interpretation==
The likelihood ratio is a function of the data formula_35; therefore, it is a statistic, although unusual in that the statistic&#x27;s value depends on a parameter, formula_2. The likelihood-ratio test rejects the null hypothesis if the value of this statistic is too small. How small is too small depends on the significance level of the test, i.e. on what probability of Type¬†I error is considered tolerable (Type¬†I errors consist of the rejection of a null hypothesis that is true).

The numerator corresponds to the likelihood of an observed outcome under the null hypothesis. The denominator corresponds to the maximum likelihood of an observed outcome, varying parameters over the whole parameter space. The numerator of this ratio is less than the denominator; so, the likelihood ratio is between 0 and 1. Low values of the likelihood ratio mean that the observed result was much less likely to occur under the null hypothesis as compared to the alternative. High values of the statistic mean that the observed outcome was nearly as likely to occur under the null hypothesis as the alternative, and so the null hypothesis cannot be rejected.

===An example===
The following example is adapted and abridged from .

Suppose that we have a random sample, of size , from a population that is normally-distributed. Both the mean, , and the standard deviation, , of the population are unknown. We want to test whether the mean is equal to a given value, .

Thus, our null hypothesis is and our alternative hypothesis is . The likelihood function is 
:formula_37

With some calculation (omitted here), it can then be shown that 
:formula_38 
where is the -statistic with degrees of freedom. Hence we may use the known exact distribution of to draw inferences.

==Asymptotic distribution: Wilks‚Äô theorem==
If the distribution of the likelihood ratio corresponding to a particular null and alternative hypothesis can be explicitly determined then it can directly be used to form decision regions (to sustain or reject the null hypothesis). In most cases, however, the exact distribution of the likelihood ratio corresponding to specific hypotheses is very difficult to determine.

Assuming is true, there is a fundamental result by Samuel S. Wilks: As the sample size formula_39 approaches formula_40, and if the null hypothesis lies strictly within the interior of the parameter space, the test statistic formula_18 defined above will be asymptotically chi-squared distributed (formula_42) with degrees of freedom equal to the difference in dimensionality of formula_1 and formula_3. This implies that for a great variety of hypotheses, we can calculate the likelihood ratio formula_45 for the data and then compare the observed formula_18 to the formula_42 value corresponding to a desired statistical significance as an &quot;approximate&quot; statistical test. Other extensions exist.

<doc id="45047" wikidata="Q3234544" url="?curid=45047" title="The Memory of Earth">
<text>The Memory of Earth (1992) is a science fiction novel by American writer Orson Scott Card. It is the first book of the &quot;Homecoming Saga&quot;, a loose fictionalization of the first few hundred years recorded in the Book of Mormon.

== Inspiration ==
As a lifelong member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Card has been influenced by his membership in the church in many of his works including Enders Game and The Tales of Alvin Maker. He was especially influenced by the Book of Mormon in his creative endeavors. Speaking of specific influences in his writing. &quot;It shows up in my style. Anybody who wonders why practically every sentence begins with &quot;and,&quot; &quot;then,&quot; &quot;but&quot; -- you just have to think of the phrase &quot;And it came to pass,&quot; and you will understand where that comes from. You see, if a sentence is important and true, I instinctively feel that it must begin with a conjunction.&quot; As a young writer he was drawn to tell stories from the Book of Mormon in his own works. The Memory of Earth is directly inspired by the Book of Mormon in its plot, themes and message. 

==Plot summary==
Humanity has lived for 40 million years on a planet called Harmony, after leaving an Earth that has been destroyed by human conflict. In order not to repeat the mistakes that led to
the destruction of civilization on Earth, a computer, known as the Oversoul, was left as guardian of this planet.

Its main mission was to prevent humans from developing technologies that could make wars a global affair. For that, humans were genetically modified so they could communicate with the Oversoul. The Oversoul uses this connection to make humans quite easily distracted when thinking about forbidden technologies, leading them to forget that train of thought. However, after this long time the Oversoul is beginning to fail, and it chooses a group of humans to return to Earth in search of the Keeper of Earth, in the hopes it will be able to find a way to maintain power over the people on Harmony.

To this end the Oversoul recruits Volemak, father of the protagonist of the story, Nafai. Nafai and Issib, his brother, begin to try and defy the Oversoul&#x27;s capability to override thought. Through this they learn of the danger that it is in. Nafai begins hearing the Oversoul&#x27;s voice in his mind. The first book focuses on the family&#x27;s eventual betrayal, the taking of the Index, and the downfall of the man Gaballufix, who had been planning to ally the city of Basilica, the home of the main characters and the setting of the first half of the book, with a malignant nation.

Nafai, Elemak and Mebbekew, his older half brothers, Issib and his father Volemak are eventually forced to leave the city. They come back to retrieve the Index of the Oversoul, which allows them to communicate with it directly. Because of Nafai&#x27;s careless blunders and miraculous successes, Elemak, Nafai&#x27;s oldest brother, begins to hate him, a theme that will play out throughout the rest of the saga.

==Characters==
The characters listed here are those whose primary role is in &quot;The Memory of Earth.&quot; For other characters, see Homecoming Saga or individual books.

; Nafai: Youngest son of Wetchik Volemak and Rasa by second contract, brother to Elemak, Mebbekew, and Issib. Nafai is a tall, 18-year-old-boy (14 in &quot;temple years&quot;) who clearly hears the voice of the Oversoul in his mind. Nafai and his brothers and father are banished from Basilica and are forced into the desert from a cunning plot conceived by Gaballufix. Volemak urges his four sons to go back to Basilica and retrieve the Index (a tool or index used to retrieve information from the Oversoul). Later Nafai confronts Gaballufix and cuts off his head under the bidding of the Oversoul.

;Wetchik (Volemak): The father of Nafai, Elemak, Issib and Mebbekew, he is a seller of exotic plants. He is given a vision from the Oversoul and told to leave Basilica with his family. He is a strong leader, able to see what must be done for the benefit of his family and he has the strength to go through with his plans.

; Gaballufix: Elemak&#x27;s oldest (half) brother, son of Hosni by Zdedhnoi, and father of Sevet and Kokor by Rasa. He attempts to ally Basilica with Potokgavan against the Gorayni (also known as the Wetheads). More importantly, he tries to draw the city into a war that goes beyond the Oversoul&#x27;s (failing) mental blocks, and destroy its traditional female-dominated structure with the help of holographically-disguised soldiers that roam the streets. He sets up a plot to kill Volemak, who opposes him; after Volemak and his sons retreat to the desert, they realize that they need the Index, which is in Gaballufix&#x27;s possession. He is eventually killed by Nafai, who will agonize over this choice and never really forgive himself for it.

;Rasa: Nafai and Issib&#x27;s mother Rasa is one of the most respected women in all of Basilica. She runs a school out of her own house where she teaches the brightest students in the city. She used to be married to Gaballufix, but is now exclusively married to Wetchik. She is ready to do everything in her power to defend her children including the students who see her as a mother figure.

; Rashgallivak: Steward to the Wetchik fortune. After Volemak embarks on a series of seemingly ill-advised actions, Rashgallavik takes control of the money. Though his intentions (to protect the Wetchik&#x27;s funds, as per his job) are originally good, he is overwhelmed by his own power after first becoming the Wetchik himself and then taking over Gaballufix&#x27;s position. His tenuous hold over Gaballufix&#x27;s guards is broken by Hushidh.

; Roptat: One of the three most influential men in Basilica, along with Volemak and Gaballufix. Gaballufix plots to have Roptat and Volemak killed, and frame Nafai for the crime.

; Elemak: The eldest child of Volemak the Wetchik by Hosni. Half brother to Gaballufix. He is driven by power and control, he acts as a personal antagonist to Nafai most of the time. He is not responsive to the voice of the Oversoul.

<doc id="45051" wikidata="Q2253638" url="?curid=45051" title="Shields (Star Trek)">
<text>In the &quot;Star Trek&quot; fictional universe, shields refer to a 23rd and 24th century technology that provides starships, space stations, and entire planets with limited protection against damage. They are sometimes referred to as &quot;deflectors&quot;, &quot;deflector shields&quot;, or (in &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;) &quot;screens&quot;. Types of shields include &quot;navigational deflectors&quot;.

== History ==
The term &#x27;shields&#x27; first appears in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;Balance of Terror&quot;, in which they were deployed, albeit to little effect, by a Federation outpost under attack from a Romulan Warbird. The first depicted use by a starship was in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;Arena&quot;, in which the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; raises its &#x27;screens&#x27; after being attacked by an alien warship although the term &#x27;shields&#x27; is not used in this episode. Shields are not mentioned during the earlier seasons of the &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; series, starships instead using &quot;polarized hull plating&quot; to make their hull more resistant to damage.

==Design==
Like most technologies in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; fictional universe, the exact operation of shield technology is never precisely described. Characters discuss its existence and manipulation, while only superficially describing its exact physics, which result in a field being projected around a ship or other body, deflecting or dispersing projectiles and energy weapons. Shields are not shown unless struck, and are then often shown briefly for dramatic effect as a translucent bubble of energy.

Shields are said to be made of a screen of gravitons that can deflect beam and projectile weaponry.

In &quot;The Making of Star Trek&quot;, authors Gene Roddenberry and Stephen Whitfield write that shields are force fields similar in nature to the navigational deflector, while &quot;Mr. Scott&#x27;s Guide to the Enterprise&quot; further states that shields on post-refit Constitution-class vessels - of which the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; of &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; is an example - were generated by the subatomic scan and replication of an alloy known as diburnium-osmium, and then projected as a force field beyond a ship&#x27;s hull along the shield grid. In &quot;That Which Survives&quot;, the alloy of diburnium and osmium is stated to be the hardest alloy known to the Federation.

Shields can be weakened by attack, and are often shown to collapse after prolonged bombardment. Shields may be unable to repel certain types of weapons; the phased polaron weapons used by the Dominion - one of the primary antagonists of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; - are initially unhindered by the shields of Starfleet ships.

The USS &quot;Defiant&quot;, introduced in the third season of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, was said to use ablative armor in addition to shields; this technology also appeared in the alternate time line of the early 25th century shown in the &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; series finale &quot;Endgame&quot;, where it withstood repeated assaults by Borg weaponry and tractor beams.

Another type of shield, the &quot;navigational deflector&quot; (also known just as the deflector, the deflector array, the deflector dish, the main deflector, the nav deflector, or the parabolic dish), was a force beam generator, usually a dish on the front of a ship, that was primarily used to deflect objects that might collide with the ship specially when traveling using Warp drive when even minute particles could cause serious damage.

<doc id="45053" wikidata="Q157303" url="?curid=45053" title="Georges Perec">
<text>Georges Perec (; 7 March 1936 ‚Äì 3 March 1982) was a French novelist, filmmaker, documentalist, and essayist. He was a member of the Oulipo group. His father died as a soldier early in the Second World War and his mother was killed in the Holocaust. Many of his works deal with absence, loss, and identity, often through word play.

==Early life==
Born in a working-class district of Paris, Perec was the only son of Icek Judko and Cyrla (Schulewicz) Peretz, Polish Jews who had emigrated to France in the 1920s. He was a distant relative of the Yiddish writer Isaac Leib Peretz. Perec&#x27;s father, who enlisted in the French Army during World War II, died in 1940 from untreated gunfire or shrapnel wounds, and his mother was killed in the Holocaust, probably in Auschwitz sometime after 1943. Perec was taken into the care of his paternal aunt and uncle in 1942, and in 1945, he was formally adopted by them.

==Career==
Perec started writing reviews and essays for &quot;La Nouvelle Revue fran√ßaise&quot; and &quot;Les Lettres nouvelles&quot;, prominent literary publications, while studying history and sociology at the Sorbonne. In 1958/59 Perec served in the French army as a paratrooper (); he married Paulette Petras after being discharged. They spent one year (1960/1961) in Sfax, Tunisia, where Paulette worked as a teacher; these experiences are reflected in &quot;&quot;, which is about a young Parisian couple who also spend a year in Sfax.

In 1961 Perec began working at the Neurophysiological Research Laboratory in the unit&#x27;s research library funded by the CNRS and attached to the H√¥pital Saint-Antoine in Paris as an archivist, a low-paid position which he retained until 1978. A few reviewers have noted that the daily handling of records and varied data may have influenced his literary style. In any case, Perec&#x27;s work on the reassessment of the academic journals under subscription was influenced by a talk about the handling of scientific information given by Eugene Garfield in Paris, and he was introduced to Marshall McLuhan by Jean Duvignaud. Perec&#x27;s other major influence was the Oulipo, which he joined in 1967, meeting Raymond Queneau, among others. Perec dedicated his masterpiece, (&quot;&quot;) to Queneau, who died before it was published.

Perec began working on a series of radio plays with his translator Eugen Helmle and the musician in the late 60s; less than a decade later, he was making films. His first cinematic work, based on his novel , was co-directed by , and won the feature-film Prix Jean Vigo in 1974. Perec also created crossword-puzzles for &quot;Le Point&quot; from 1976 on.

&quot;La Vie mode d&#x27;emploi&quot; (1978) brought Perec some financial and critical success‚Äîit won the Prix M√©dicis‚Äîand allowed him to turn to writing full-time. He was a writer-in-residence at the University of Queensland in Australia in 1981, during which time he worked on &quot;53 Jours&quot; (&quot;53 Days&quot;), which remained unfinished. Shortly after his return from Australia, his health deteriorated. A heavy smoker, he was diagnosed with lung cancer. He died the following year in Ivry-sur-Seine at age 45, four days shy of his 46th birthday; his ashes are held at the columbarium of the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery.

==Work==

Many of Perec&#x27;s novels and essays abound with experimental word play, lists and attempts at classification, and they are usually tinged with melancholy.

Perec&#x27;s first novel &quot;Les Choses&quot; (published in English as &quot;&quot;) (1965) was awarded the Prix Renaudot.

Perec&#x27;s most famous novel &quot;La Vie mode d&#x27;emploi&quot; (&quot;Life A User&#x27;s Manual&quot;) was published in 1978. Its title page describes it as &quot;novels&quot;, in the plural, the reasons for which become apparent on reading. &quot;La Vie mode d&#x27;emploi&quot; is a tapestry of interwoven stories and ideas as well as literary and historical allusions, based on the lives of the inhabitants of a fictitious Parisian apartment block. It was written according to a complex plan of writing constraints and is primarily constructed from several elements, each adding a layer of complexity. The 99 chapters of his 600-page novel move like a knight&#x27;s tour of a chessboard around the room plan of the building, describing the rooms and stairwell and telling the stories of the inhabitants. At the end, it is revealed that the whole book actually takes place in a single moment, with a final twist that is an example of &quot;cosmic irony&quot;. It was translated into English by David Bellos in 1987.

Perec is noted for his constrained writing. His 300-page novel &quot;La disparition&quot; (1969) is a lipogram, written with natural sentence structure and correct grammar, but using only words that do not contain the letter &quot;e&quot;. It has been translated into English by Gilbert Adair under the title &quot;A Void&quot; (1994). His novella &quot;Les revenentes&quot; (1972) is a complementary univocalic piece in which the letter &quot;e&quot; is the only vowel used. This constraint affects even the title, which would conventionally be spelt &quot;Revenantes&quot;. An English translation by Ian Monk was published in 1996 as &quot;The Exeter Text: Jewels, Secrets, Sex&quot; in the collection &quot;Three&quot;. It has been remarked by Jacques Roubaud that these two novels draw words from two disjoint sets of the French language, and that a third novel would be possible, made from the words not used so far (those containing both &quot;e&quot; and a vowel other than &quot;e&quot;).

&quot;W ou le souvenir d&#x27;enfance&quot;, (&quot;W, or the Memory of Childhood&quot;, 1975) is a semi-autobiographical work that is hard to classify. Two alternating narratives make up the volume: The first is a fictional outline of a remote island country called &quot;W&quot;, which at first appears to be a utopian society modelled on the Olympic ideal but is gradually exposed as a horrifying, totalitarian prison much like a concentration camp. The second is a description of Perec&#x27;s childhood during and after World War II. Both narratives converge towards the end, highlighting the common theme of the Holocaust.

&quot;Cantatrix sopranica L. Scientific Papers&quot; is a spoof scientific paper detailing experiments on the &quot;yelling reaction&quot; provoked in sopranos by pelting them with rotten tomatoes. All references in the paper are multi-lingual puns and jokes; e.g., &quot;(Karybb &amp; Szyla, 1973)&quot;.

David Bellos, who has translated several of Perec&#x27;s works, wrote an extensive biography of Perec entitled &quot;Georges Perec: A Life in Words&quot;, which won the Acad√©mie Goncourt&#x27;s &quot;bourse&quot; for biography in 1994.

The Association Georges Perec has extensive archives on the author in Paris.

In 1992 Perec&#x27;s initially rejected novel &quot;Gaspard pas mort&quot; (&quot;Gaspard not dead&quot;), believed to be lost, was found by David Bellos amongst papers in the house of Perec&#x27;s friend . The novel was reworked several times and retitled &quot;&quot; and published in 2012; its English translation by Bellos followed in 2014 as &quot;Portrait of a Man&quot; after the 1475 painting of that name by Antonello da Messina. The initial title borrows the name Gaspard from the Paul Verlaine poem &quot;Gaspar Hauser Chante&quot; (inspired by Kaspar Hauser, from the 1881 collection &quot;Sagesse&quot;) and characters named &quot;Gaspard&quot; appear in both &quot;W, or the Memory of Childhood&quot; and &quot;&quot;, while in &quot;MICRO-TRADUCTIONS, 15 variations discr√®tes sur un po√®me connu&quot; he creatively re-writes the Verlaine poem fifteen times.

==Honours==
Asteroid no. 2817, discovered in 1982, was named after Perec. In 1994, a street in the 20th arrondissement of Paris was named after him, . The French postal service issued a stamp in 2002 in his honour; it was designed by Marc Taraskoff and engraved by Pierre Albuisson. For his work, Perec won the Prix Renaudot in 1965, the Prix Jean Vigo in 1974, and the Prix M√©dicis in 1978. He was featured as a Google Doodle on his 80th birthday.

<doc id="45056" wikidata="Q481514" url="?curid=45056" title="Marsala">
<text>Marsala (, ; ) is an Italian comune located in the Province of Trapani in the westernmost part of Sicily. Marsala is the most populated town in its province and the fifth largest in Sicily.The town is famous for the docking of Giuseppe Garibaldi on 11 May 1860 (the &quot;Expedition of the Thousand&quot;) and for its Marsala wine. A feature of the area is the Stagnone Lagoon Natural Reserve ‚Äì a marine area with salt ponds.

Marsala is built on the ruins of the ancient Carthaginian city of Lilybaeum, and includes in its territory the archaeological site of the island of Motya, an ancient Phoenician town. The modern name likely derived from the Arabic (&quot;marsƒÅ  øaliyy&quot;, &quot;Ali&#x27;s harbor&quot;), or possibly (&quot;marsƒÅ llƒÅh&quot;, &quot;God&#x27;s harbor&quot;).

== Geography ==
Situated at the extreme western point of Sicily, the town was founded on Lilibeo Cape from where the Aegadian Islands and the Stagnone Lagoon can be seen.

===Territory===
The territory of Marsala, , has a rich cultural and landscape heritage; its area includes the Stagnone Lagoon, a Natural Reserve in which is located the island of Mozia.

The city of Marsala had a population of about 86,000 until the end of 1970, when Petrosino, a village formerly part of Marsala, decided to become a self-governing town after a local referendum.

The area of Marsala is classified as a seismic zone 2 (medium). In the last 200 years three earthquakes of medium-high intensity were recorded:
*18 May 1828 ‚Äì magnitude 5.17 (about VI Mercalli scale).
*15 January 1968 ‚Äì Belice earthquake which in Marsala reached VII Mercalli scale (although its intensity was as high as X in other locations).
*7 June 1981 ‚Äì magnitude 4.60 (IV‚ÄìV scala Mercalli scale) with epicentre in Borgo Elefante in Mazara del Vallo, about from the town-centre of Marsala.

=== Climate ===
Marsala has a hot-summer mediterranean climate (K√∂ppen: &quot;Csa&quot;), similar to most coastal towns in Sicily, with hot and dry summers coupled with moderately wet and mild winters. Weather in Marsala is similar to that of nearby Trapani.

Summers are generally warm with a record maximum temperature of in August 2017. In the summer, due to how dry it is, it is not unusual to experience the effect of Sirocco wind, which brings dust and sand from the Sahara.

Winters are generally rainy and cooler with temperatures ranging between minimum of (in December 2014) and . Snowfall occurs very rarely, since the temperature has never dropped below freezing, although snow has fallen before, for example in December 2014.

== Mythology ==
In Greek mythology, Butes was the only Argonaut who jumped in the sea while sailing past the Sirens because he couldn&#x27;t resist the charm of their singing, but Aphrodite saved him and transferred him to Lilybaeum.

== History ==

===Carthaginian Period===

The Carthaginian army sent to conquer Selinunte in 409 BC landed and camped near the site of the later Lilybaeum. In 397¬†BC when the Phoenician colony of Motya on the southwestern coast of Sicily was invaded and destroyed by the Syracusan tyrant Dionysius I, the survivors founded a town on the mainland nearby, the site of modern-day Marsala, which they called by a Punic name, recorded in Greek as &quot;Lil√Ωbaion&quot; () and in Latin as &quot;&quot;. Over the following two centuries, it became a trade centre for manufactured goods and served as a strategic port between Carthage and Carthaginian territories in Sardinia. It was built with strong defensive walls from the beginning and had three linked harbours. Punic Lilybaion was never conquered although it was besieged several times e.g. by Pyrrhus of Epirus and the Romans. The walls were ultimately over 10m high and 7m thick. They were strengthened for Pyrrhus&#x27; Siege of Lilybaeum in 278 BC by a second wall 10m from the first. The siege lasted 2 months before he withdrew. It was the only city which Pyrrhus could not conquer during his campaign at Sicily.

The First Punic War began here when the Punic army landed at Lilybaion in 265‚Äì264¬†BC, then marched across Sicily to Messina, where the opening clash of the war took place.

In 250 BC the Romans sent a huge naval expedition of up to 240 ships towards Lilybaeum, the Carthaginian headquarters. A massive Roman army of 4 legions under the two consuls was also sent. The Carthaginians also understood the importance of this port and put their whole force together to save the city including about 10,000 mercenaries (Celts and Greeks). The Carthaginians sailed 50 ships from Africa under the command of Hannibal to try to save the city by charging towards the centre of the harbour. The Romans did not attempt to stop the entry of the fleet because of their sudden appearance and unfavourable winds in a foreign port.

The Roman fleet was defeated at Drepana in 249 BC when attempting a surprise attack there, followed by the destruction of the rest of the fleet soon afterwards in a storm. This forced the Romans to settle in for a long siege.

The Siege of Lilybaeum (250 BC) lasted for 9 years without Roman success. Carthage was able to reinforce and re-supply Lilybaeum during the war. Some of the Gallic mercenaries planned to betray the city but Alexon, who had previously saved Agrigentum from similar treachery, foiled the plot by informing the Carthaginian commander Himilco.

In 241 BC the city was given to the Romans as part of the peace treaty ending the First Punic War and then became one of the most important cities in Sicily.

===Roman Lilybaeum===

In 218 BC, in the Second Punic War, the Battle of Lilybaeum was fought between the navies of Carthage and Rome when Carthage attempted a secret raid on the city to re-establish a base. Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, the praetor at Lilybaeum, was told about the impending raid and prepared his 20 ships which managed to defeat the 50 opposing quinqueremes.

In the republican period the city was enriched with mansions and public buildings and dubbed &quot;splendidissima urbs&quot; by Cicero, who served as quaestor in the region between 76 and 75¬†BC. During the Civil Wars Lilybaeum was twice besieged, in 43 BC by Sextus Pompeius and 38 by Lepidus during which the walls were further strengthened as shown by an inscription.

The city walls were abandoned in the 4th c. AD as shown by buildings erected over or beside the walls.

===Post-Roman Period===
The city was the seat of the Diocese of Lilybaeum from at least the early 5th century AD. Ravaged by Vandals during the 5th century AD, the town was annexed in the 6th century to Justinian&#x27;s Byzantine Empire. In this period the town was struck by dysentery, raided by pirates, and neglected by Constantinople. The arrival of the Arabs at the nearby Granitola mount in the 8th century entailed the resumption of commerce and the start of the rebirth of the town. The town was renamed &quot;Marsa  øAlƒ´&quot; &quot; øAlƒ´&#x27;s harbour&quot; or maybe, &quot;Marsa  øƒÅliyy&quot;, &quot;Big harbour&quot;, for the width of the ancient harbour, placed near Punta d&#x27;Alga. Another possible derivation is &quot;Marsa AllƒÅh&quot;, &quot;God&#x27;s harbour&quot;.

Since the end of the 11th century, the area has been conquered by Norman, Angevin and Aragonese troops. During this time, Marsala became wealthy, primarily through trade. However the blocking up of the harbour of Punta Alga, decreed by Emperor Charles V so as to stop Saracen forays, brought an end to this period of prosperity.

The development of Marsala wine at the end of the 18th century, headed by English merchants settled in Sicily, considerably improved local trade. This triggered an economic expansion in Marsala, including the funding of infrastructure projects such as the current harbour of Margitello.

On 11 May 1860 Giuseppe Garibaldi landed at Marsala, beginning the process of Italian unification.

On 11 May 1943, in the lead-up to the World War II Allied invasion of Sicily, an Allied bombardment of the town permanently damaged its Baroque centre and claimed many victims: &quot;Marsala Wiped Off the Map&quot; titled the New York Times on 13 May 1943.

== Archaeology ==


The archaeological area of Marsala has been investigated both through excavations and topographic studies. Lilybaeum, the ancient town, took up a rectangular area on Capo Boeo, a low and rocky promontory sloping gently down towards the sea. The urban layout of the town can be dated back to the 2nd century BC with modern-day &quot;Viale Vittorio Veneto&quot; the &quot;Decumanus Maximus&quot; and &quot;Viale Cesare Battisti&quot; the &quot;Cardo Maximus&quot;.

Based on the archaeological findings at Capo Boeo, Lilybaeum was rebuilt twice, in the 1st century BC and in the 3rd century AD. There is not enough evidence to associate the latter with the 365 Crete earthquake, even though literature and archaeological discoveries elsewhere show that other Sicilian towns, such as Selinunte, &quot;were&quot; affected.

Several fragments of the city walls and floors and walls of public and private buildings are visible. Excavations in several places under the modern city have revealed rich mosaic floors in town houses.

The Baglio Anselmi Archaeological Museum houses an example of Carthaginian ship possibly used during the Battle of the Aegates Islands (241 BC) found on the seabed off the coast of Marsala, as well as other ancient remains from the area, such as pottery, marble sculptures and mosaics. Many fine painted tombs and funerary monuments have been excavated showing unique preservation of colours.

The three entrance gates into the town dating from Norman times: Porta Nuova, Porta di Mare and Porta Mazara were rebuilt in the 17th and 18th centuries in a much grander form: Porta Mazara, () rebuilt in 1572, located in the south-east; Porta di Mare () (renamed to Porta Garibaldi), rebuilt in 1685, located in the south-west of the town; Porta Nuova () was rebuilt in 1790, and is located in the north-west of the town. The city council decided to demolish the city walls in 1887 to make way for the rapidly-expanding town. Along with this demolition was demolished the north-east gate called Porta Trapani, constructed in the early 17th century, nicknamed &quot;Porticella&quot; due to its small size in comparison to the other three gates of the town; it used to be located at the intersection of &quot;Via Pellegrino&quot; and &quot;Via Sardegna&quot;.

==Economy==
The economy of Marsala still depends on the production of wine, although tourism is a growing industry and it too is becoming an important source of income for the city. With its coastline of sandy beaches and clear sea, access to the nearby Aegadian Islands and the natural environment of the Saline Della Laguna and Stagnone Lagoon, Marsala is an important Sicilian tourist destination.

<text>Framestore is a British visual effects and computer animation studio based on Chancery Lane in London, England. The company was founded in 1986. Framestore specializes in visual effects for film and prestige TV, advertising, rides, and immersive experiences. It is the largest production house in Europe, employing roughly 3,000 staff, including 1,000 in London, and 1,500 across studios in Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, Montreal, Melbourne and Mumbai.

==History==
===Foundation===
Framestore was founded in 1986 by William Sargent and Sharon Reed, together with three friends. Tim Webber joined Framestore in 1988 and led the company&#x27;s push into digital film and television, developing Framestore&#x27;s virtual camera and motion rig systems. In 1992, Mike Milne started the CGI department, adding computer-generated imagery animation to the company&#x27;s range of facilities.

===Merger with CFC===
In 1997, Framestore acquired the Computer Film Company, which was one of the UK&#x27;s first digital film visual effects companies, developing technology for digital film scanning, compositing, and output. CFC was founded in London in 1984 by Mike Boudry, Wolfgang Lempp (now CTO at Filmlight) and Neil Harris (Lightworks). CFC&#x27;s first film was &quot;The Fruit Machine&quot;, in 1988, which utilised early morphing techniques.

In 2004, Framestore opened their first satellite office in New York City, to focus on advertising. This was followed by another office in Iceland in 2008, which has since been closed and has reopened as a local VFX company, RVX. In 2013 Framestore opened an office in Montreal, followed by another in Los Angeles the same year. In 2014, it launched a production arm.

Early projects for the company include the delivery of its first feature animation project &quot;The Tale of Despereaux&quot; with Universal; the completion of Europe&#x27;s first digital intermediate for the film &quot;Chicken Run&quot; in 2000; contribution of scenes for the 2009 film &quot;Avatar&quot;, and the completion as a production project of four British feature films which opened in theaters between during 2009 and 2010.

=== Acquisition by CIH ===
In November 2016, Framestore agreed to let the Shanghai-based Cultural Investment Holdings Co acquire 75% of it for ¬£112.50 million. The company worked on projects such as &quot;Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them&quot;, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, and &quot;Paddington 2.&quot; In April 2017, Framestore announced that they had opened a third US location, in Chicago, Illinois.

The company also worked on the 2017 film &quot;Darkest Hour&quot; directed by Joe Wright, working out of the Montreal facility of Framestore to create historically accurate backdrops for 85 shots in the film, including battle scenes.

The team created around 300 shots for the 2017 film &quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot;, with Framestore winning a special visual effects award at the 2018 British Academy Film Awards. They have also worked on &quot;Black Mirror&quot;, creating props such as the 60s-style spaceship in the premiere of the fourth season.

In November 2020, Framestore announced that they have acquired Deluxe&#x27;s former creative assets including Method Studios and Company 3 to expand their VFX and post-production landscapes.

== Reception ==
Framestore has been awarded two Scientific and Technical Academy Awards, and 14 Primetime Emmys. In 2008, Framestore won their first Academy Award for Best Visual Effects for the film &quot;The Golden Compass&quot;; they also won the BAFTA Award for that film the same year. Framestore was also nominated for Academy Awards in 2009 (&quot;The Dark Knight&quot;) and again in 2010 (&quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ‚Äì Part 1&quot;).

Tim Webber was the VFX supervisor on &quot;Gravity&quot; (2013), and the techniques involved in the film realised by Webber and the Framestore team took three years to complete. The team won the Best Visual Effects awards BAFTA Award for Best Special Visual Effects at the 67th British Academy Film Awards, and the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects award at the 86th Academy Awards. 
The company then won both the Academy Award and BAFTA for Best Visual Effects in 2018 for its work on Blade Runner 2049.

In advertising the team has also won major awards including Cannes Lions, British Television Advertising Awards, Clios, D&amp;AD and others.

The company&#x27;s R&amp;D team spin off to create the technology company Filmlight, which in 2010 received four Scientific Academy Awards.

Framestore won the 2020 BAFTA TV Craft Awards for Special, Visual &amp; Graphic Effects for its extensive work on the HBO / BBC series His Dark Materials.

==Advertising and trade characters==
Framestore has collaborated with companies and advertising agencies to create trade characters, and also created an attempted photorealistic computer-generated Audrey Hepburn for a Galaxy chocolate advert. A combination of elements including body doubles, motion-capture, FACS and the rendering software Arnold were used to mimic the appearance of the actress 20 years after her death. The advert drew press attention both for the cutting-edge technology utilized and the ethical implications of using a person&#x27;s likeness posthumously for commercial purposes.

<text>In grammar, a part of speech or part-of-speech (abbreviated as POS or PoS, also known as word class or grammatical category) is a category of words (or, more generally, of lexical items) that have similar grammatical properties. Words that are assigned to the same part of speech generally display similar syntactic behavior (they play similar roles within the grammatical structure of sentences), sometimes similar morphological behavior in that they undergo inflection for similar properties and even similar semantic behavior. Commonly listed English parts of speech are noun, verb, adjective, adverb, pronoun, preposition, conjunction, interjection, numeral, article, and determiner.

Other terms than &quot;part of speech&quot;‚Äîparticularly in modern linguistic classifications, which often make more precise distinctions than the traditional scheme does‚Äîinclude word class, lexical class, and lexical category. Some authors restrict the term &quot;lexical category&quot; to refer only to a particular type of syntactic category; for them the term excludes those parts of speech that are considered to be function words, such as pronouns. The term form class is also used, although this has various conflicting definitions. Word classes may be classified as open or closed: &quot;open classes&quot; (typically including nouns, verbs and adjectives) acquire new members constantly, while &quot;closed classes&quot; (such as pronouns and conjunctions) acquire new members infrequently, if at all.

Almost all languages have the word classes noun and verb, but beyond these two there are significant variations among different languages. For example:
* Japanese has as many as three classes of adjectives, where English has one.
* Chinese, Korean, Japanese and Vietnamese have a class of nominal classifiers.
* Many languages do not distinguish between adjectives and adverbs, or between adjectives and verbs (see stative verb).

Because of such variation in the number of categories and their identifying properties, analysis of parts of speech must be done for each individual language. Nevertheless, the labels for each category are assigned on the basis of universal criteria.

==History==
The classification of words into lexical categories is found from the earliest moments in the history of linguistics.

===India===
In the &quot;Nirukta&quot;, written in the 6th or 5th century BCE, the Sanskrit grammarian YƒÅska defined four main categories of words:

* ‡§®‡§æ‡§Æ &quot;nƒÅma&quot; ‚Äì noun (including adjective)
* ‡§Ü‡§ñ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§§ &quot;ƒÅkhyƒÅta&quot; ‚Äì verb
* ‡§â‡§™‡§∏‡§∞‡•ç‡§ó &quot;upasarga&quot; ‚Äì pre-verb or prefix
* ‡§®‡§ø‡§™‡§æ‡§§ &quot;nipƒÅta&quot; ‚Äì particle, invariant word (perhaps preposition)
These four were grouped into two larger classes: inflectable (nouns and verbs) and uninflectable (pre-verbs and particles).

The ancient work on the grammar of the Tamil language, &quot;TolkƒÅppiyam&quot;, argued to have been written around 2nd century CE, classifies Tamil words as &quot;peyar&quot; (‡Æ™‡ØÜ‡ÆØ‡Æ∞‡Øç; noun), &quot;vinai&quot; (‡Æµ‡Æø‡Æ©‡Øà; verb), &quot;idai&quot; (part of speech which modifies the relationships between verbs and nouns), and &quot;uri&quot; (word that further qualifies a noun or verb).

===Western tradition===
A century or two after the work of YƒÅska, the Greek scholar Plato wrote in his &quot;Cratylus&quot; dialogue, &quot;sentences are, I conceive, a combination of verbs [&quot;rh√™ma&quot;] and nouns [&quot;√≥noma&quot;]&quot;. Aristotle added another class, &quot;conjunction&quot; [&quot;s√Ωndesmos&quot;], which included not only the words known today as conjunctions, but also other parts (the interpretations differ; in one interpretation it is pronouns, prepositions, and the article).

By the end of the 2nd century BCE, grammarians had expanded this classification scheme into eight categories, seen in the &quot;Art of Grammar&quot;, attributed to Dionysius Thrax:

* &#x27;Name&#x27; (&quot;√≥noma&quot;) translated as &#x27;noun&#x27;: a part of speech inflected for case, signifying a concrete or abstract entity. It includes various &quot;species&quot; like nouns, adjectives, proper nouns, appellatives, collectives, ordinals, numerals and more.
* Verb (&quot;rh√™ma&quot;): a part of speech without case inflection, but inflected for tense, person and number, signifying an activity or process performed or undergone
* Participle (&quot;metokh·∏ó&quot;): a part of speech sharing features of the verb and the noun
* Article (&quot;√°rthron&quot;): a declinable part of speech, taken to include the definite article, but also the basic relative pronoun
* Pronoun (&quot;ant≈çnym√≠ƒÅ&quot;): a part of speech substitutable for a noun and marked for a person
* Preposition (&quot;pr√≥thesis&quot;): a part of speech placed before other words in composition and in syntax
* Adverb (&quot;ep√≠rrhƒìma&quot;): a part of speech without inflection, in modification of or in addition to a verb, adjective, clause, sentence, or other adverb
* Conjunction (&quot;s√Ωndesmos&quot;): a part of speech binding together the discourse and filling gaps in its interpretation

It can be seen that these parts of speech are defined by morphological, syntactic and semantic criteria.

The Latin grammarian Priscian (fl. 500 CE) modified the above eightfold system, excluding &quot;article&quot; (since the Latin language, unlike Greek, does not have articles) but adding &quot;interjection&quot;.

The Latin names for the parts of speech, from which the corresponding modern English terms derive, were &quot;nomen&quot;, &quot;verbum&quot;, &quot;participium&quot;, &quot;pronomen&quot;, &quot;praepositio&quot;, &quot;adverbium&quot;, &quot;conjunctio&quot; and &quot;interjectio&quot;. The category &quot;nomen&quot; included substantives (&quot;nomen substantivum&quot;, corresponding to what are today called nouns in English), adjectives &quot;(nomen adjectivum)&quot; and numerals &quot;(nomen numerale)&quot;. This is reflected in the older English terminology &quot;noun substantive&quot;, &quot;noun adjective&quot; and &quot;noun numeral&quot;. Later the adjective became a separate class, as often did the numerals, and the English word &quot;noun&quot; came to be applied to substantives only.

=== Classification ===
Works of English grammar generally follow the pattern of the European tradition as described above, except that participles are now usually regarded as forms of verbs rather than as a separate part of speech, and numerals are often conflated with other parts of speech: nouns (cardinal numerals, e.g., &quot;one&quot;, and collective numerals, e.g., &quot;dozen&quot;), adjectives (ordinal numerals, e.g., &quot;first&quot;, and multiplier numerals, e.g., &quot;single&quot;) and adverbs (multiplicative numerals, e.g., &quot;once&quot;, and distributive numerals, e.g., &quot;singly&quot;). Eight or nine parts of speech are commonly listed:

* noun
* verb
* adjective
* adverb
* pronoun
* preposition
* conjunction
* interjection
* determiner

Some traditional classifications consider articles to be adjectives, yielding eight parts of speech rather than nine. And some modern classifications define further classes in addition to these. For discussion see the sections below.

Additionally, there are other parts of speech including particles (&quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;) and postpositions (&quot;ago&quot;, &quot;notwithstanding&quot;) although many fewer words are in these categories.

The classification below, or slight expansions of it, is still followed in most dictionaries:
;Noun (names): a word or lexical item denoting any abstract (abstract noun: e.g. &quot;home&quot;) or concrete entity (concrete noun: e.g. &quot;house&quot;); a person (&quot;police officer&quot;, &quot;Michael&quot;), place (&quot;coastline&quot;, &quot;London&quot;), thing (&quot;necktie&quot;, &quot;television&quot;), idea (&quot;happiness&quot;), or quality (&quot;bravery&quot;). Nouns can also be classified as count nouns or non-count nouns; some can belong to either category. The most common part of speech; they are called naming words.
;Pronoun (replaces or places again): a substitute for a noun or noun phrase (&quot;them, he&quot;). Pronouns make sentences shorter and clearer since they replace nouns.
;Adjective (describes, limits): a modifier of a noun or pronoun (&quot;big, brave&quot;). Adjectives make the meaning of another word (noun) more precise.
;Verb (states action or being): a word denoting an action (&quot;walk&quot;), occurrence (&quot;happen&quot;), or state of being (&quot;be&quot;). Without a verb, a group of words cannot be a clause or sentence.
;Adverb (describes, limits): a modifier of an adjective, verb, or another adverb (&quot;very, quite&quot;). Adverbs make language more precise.
;Preposition (relates): a word that relates words to each other in a phrase or sentence and aids in syntactic context (&quot;in, of&quot;). Prepositions show the relationship between a noun or a pronoun with another word in the sentence.
;Conjunction (connects): a syntactic connector; links words, phrases, or clauses (&quot;and, but&quot;). Conjunctions connect words or group of words.
;Interjection (expresses feelings and emotions): an emotional greeting or exclamation (&quot;Huzzah, Alas&quot;). Interjections express strong feelings and emotions.
;Article (describes, limits):a grammatical marker of definiteness (&quot;the&quot;) or indefiniteness (&quot;a, an&quot;). The article is not always listed separately as its own part of speech. It is considered by some grammarians to be a type of adjective or sometimes the term &#x27;determiner&#x27; (a broader class) is used.

English words are not generally marked as belonging to one part of speech or another; this contrasts with many other European languages, which use inflection more extensively, meaning that a given word form can often be identified as belonging to a particular part of speech and having certain additional grammatical properties. In English, most words are uninflected, while the inflected endings that exist are mostly ambiguous: &quot;-ed&quot; may mark a verbal past tense, a participle or a fully adjectival form; &quot;-s&quot; may mark a plural noun, a possessive noun, or a present-tense verb form; &quot;-ing&quot; may mark a participle, gerund, or pure adjective or noun. Although &quot;-ly&quot; is a frequent adverb marker, some adverbs (e.g. &quot;tomorrow&quot;, &quot;fast&quot;, &quot;very&quot;) do not have that ending, while many adjectives do have it (e.g. &quot;friendly&quot;, &quot;ugly&quot;, &quot;lovely&quot;), as do occasional words in other parts of speech (e.g. &quot;jelly&quot;, &quot;fly&quot;, &quot;rely&quot;).

Many English words can belong to more than one part of speech. Words like &quot;neigh&quot;, &quot;break&quot;, &quot;outlaw&quot;, &quot;laser&quot;, &quot;microwave&quot;, and &quot;telephone&quot; might all be either verbs or nouns. In certain circumstances, even words with primarily grammatical functions can be used as verbs or nouns, as in, &quot;We must look to the &quot;hows&quot; and not just the &quot;whys&quot;.&quot; The process whereby a word comes to be used as a different part of speech is called conversion or zero derivation.

==Functional classification==
Linguists recognize that the above list of eight or nine word classes is drastically simplified. For example, &quot;adverb&quot; is to some extent a catch-all class that includes words with many different functions. Some have even argued that the most basic of category distinctions, that of nouns and verbs, is unfounded, or not applicable to certain languages. Modern linguists have proposed many different schemes whereby the words of English or other languages are placed into more specific categories and subcategories based on a more precise understanding of their grammatical functions.

Common lexical category set defined by function may include the following (not all of them will necessarily be applicable in a given language):
* Categories that will usually be open classes:
** adjectives
** adverbs
** nouns
** verbs (except auxiliary verbs)
** interjections
* Categories that will usually be closed classes:
** auxiliary verbs
** coverbs
** conjunctions
** determiners (articles, quantifiers, demonstratives, and possessives)
** measure words or classifiers
** adpositions (prepositions, postpositions, and circumpositions)
** preverbs
** pronouns
** cardinal numerals
** particles

Within a given category, subgroups of words may be identified based on more precise grammatical properties. For example, verbs may be specified according to the number and type of objects or other complements which they take. This is called subcategorization.

Many modern descriptions of grammar include not only lexical categories or word classes, but also &quot;phrasal categories&quot;, used to classify phrases, in the sense of groups of words that form units having specific grammatical functions. Phrasal categories may include noun phrases (NP), verb phrases (VP) and so on. Lexical and phrasal categories together are called syntactic categories.


==Open and closed classes==
Word classes may be either open or closed. An &quot;open class&quot; is one that commonly accepts the addition of new words, while a &quot;closed class&quot; is one to which new items are very rarely added. Open classes normally contain large numbers of words, while closed classes are much smaller. Typical open classes found in English and many other languages are nouns, verbs (excluding auxiliary verbs, if these are regarded as a separate class), adjectives, adverbs and interjections. Ideophones are often an open class, though less familiar to English speakers, and are often open to nonce words. Typical closed classes are prepositions (or postpositions), determiners, conjunctions, and pronouns.

The open‚Äìclosed distinction is related to the distinction between lexical and functional categories, and to that between content words and function words, and some authors consider these identical, but the connection is not strict. Open classes are generally lexical categories in the stricter sense, containing words with greater semantic content, while closed classes are normally functional categories, consisting of words that perform essentially grammatical functions. This is not universal: in many languages verbs and adjectives are closed classes, usually consisting of few members, and in Japanese the formation of new pronouns from existing nouns is relatively common, though to what extent these form a distinct word class is debated.

Words are added to open classes through such processes as compounding, derivation, coining, and borrowing. When a new word is added through some such process, it can subsequently be used grammatically in sentences in the same ways as other words in its class. A closed class may obtain new items through these same processes, but such changes are much rarer and take much more time. A closed class is normally seen as part of the core language and is not expected to change. In English, for example, new nouns, verbs, etc. are being added to the language constantly (including by the common process of verbing and other types of conversion, where an existing word comes to be used in a different part of speech). However, it is very unusual for a new pronoun, for example, to become accepted in the language, even in cases where there may be felt to be a need for one, as in the case of gender-neutral pronouns.

The open or closed status of word classes varies between languages, even assuming that corresponding word classes exist. Most conspicuously, in many languages verbs and adjectives form closed classes of content words. An extreme example is found in Jingulu, which has only three verbs, while even the modern Indo-European Persian has no more than a few hundred simple verbs, a great deal of which are archaic. (Some twenty Persian verbs are used as light verbs to form compounds; this lack of lexical verbs is shared with other Iranian languages.) Japanese is similar, having few lexical verbs. Basque verbs are also a closed class, with the vast majority of verbal senses instead expressed periphrastically.

In Japanese, verbs and adjectives are closed classes, though these are quite large, with about 700 adjectives, and verbs have opened slightly in recent years. Japanese adjectives are closely related to verbs (they can predicate a sentence, for instance). New verbal meanings are nearly always expressed periphrastically by appending to a noun, as in , and new adjectival meanings are nearly always expressed by adjectival nouns, using the suffix when an adjectival noun modifies a noun phrase, as in . The closedness of verbs has weakened in recent years, and in a few cases new verbs are created by appending to a noun or using it to replace the end of a word. This is mostly in casual speech for borrowed words, with the most well-established example being , from . This recent innovation aside, the huge contribution of Sino-Japanese vocabulary was almost entirely borrowed as nouns (often verbal nouns or adjectival nouns). Other languages where adjectives are closed class include Swahili, Bemba, and Luganda.

By contrast, Japanese pronouns are an open class and nouns become used as pronouns with some frequency; a recent example is , now used by some as a first-person pronoun. The status of Japanese pronouns as a distinct class is disputed, however, with some considering it only a use of nouns, not a distinct class. The case is similar in languages of Southeast Asia, including Thai and Lao, in which, like Japanese, pronouns and terms of address vary significantly based on relative social standing and respect.

Some word classes are universally closed, however, including demonstratives and interrogative words.

<doc id="45061" wikidata="Q513101" url="?curid=45061" title="From Hell">
<text>From Hell is a graphic novel by writer Alan Moore and artist Eddie Campbell, originally published in serial form from 1989 to 1998. The full collection was published in 1999 by Top Shelf Productions.

Set during the Whitechapel murders of the late Victorian era, the novel speculates upon the identity and motives of Jack the Ripper. The novel depicts several true events surrounding the murders, although portions have been fictionalised, particularly the identity of the killer and the precise nature and circumstances of the murders.

The title is taken from the first words of the &quot;From Hell&quot; letter, which some authorities believe was an authentic message sent from the killer in 1888. The collected edition is 572 pages long. The 2000 and later editions are the most common prints. The comic was loosely adapted into a film, released in 2001. In 2000, the graphic novel was banned in Australia for several weeks after customs officers seized copies of the seventh issue from a shipment intended for Quality Comics.

== Development ==
Moore began developing the plot for &quot;From Hell&quot; in the late 1980s. Writer Neil Gaiman recalled Moore calling him up to discuss a television documentary he had just seen about Jack the Ripper, and then asking for Gaiman&#x27;s help tracking down &quot;rare and forgotten biographies of possible Ripper suspects at the British Museum&quot;.

&quot;From Hell&quot; takes as its premise Stephen Knight&#x27;s theory that the Jack the Ripper murders were part of a conspiracy to conceal the birth of an illegitimate royal baby fathered by Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence, slightly modified: the involvement of Walter Sickert is reduced, and Knight&#x27;s allegation that the child&#x27;s mother was a Catholic has been dropped. Knight&#x27;s theories have been described as &quot;a good fictional read&quot; whose &quot;conclusions have been disproved numerous times&quot;.

==Publication history==
&quot;From Hell&quot; was originally serialized as one of several features in &quot;Taboo&quot;, an anthology comic book published by Steve Bissette&#x27;s Spiderbaby Grafix. After running in &quot;Taboo&quot; #2‚Äì7 (1989‚Äì1992), Moore and Campbell moved the project to its own series, published first by Tundra Publishing, then by Kitchen Sink Press. The series was published in ten volumes between 1991 and 1996, and an appendix, &quot;From Hell: The Dance of the Gull-catchers&quot;, was published in 1998. The entire series was collected in a trade paperback and published by Eddie Campbell Comics in 1999; trade paperback and hardcover versions were published by Top Shelf Productions in the United States and Knockabout Comics in the UK. A fully colorized Master Edition was serialized starting in September 2018.

==Plot==
Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence, also known as Prince Eddy, secretly marries and fathers a child with Annie Crook, a shop girl in London&#x27;s East End. Prince Eddy had visited the area under an assumed name and Annie is unaware of her husband&#x27;s royal position. Queen Victoria becomes aware of the marriage and has Albert separated forcibly from his wife, whom she places in an asylum. Victoria then instructs her royal physician Sir William Gull to impair Annie&#x27;s sanity, which he does by damaging or impairing her thyroid gland. The prince&#x27;s daughter is taken to Annie&#x27;s parents by the artist Walter Sickert, a friend of Eddy&#x27;s who had accompanied him on his trips to the East End. Annie&#x27;s father believes the child to be his through an incestuous relationship with his daughter. Sickert reluctantly leaves the child with Annie&#x27;s parents.

The potentially scandalous matter is resolved, until a group of prostitutes ‚Äì Annie&#x27;s friends Mary Kelly, Polly Nichols, Anne Chapman, and Liz Stride ‚Äì who are aware of the illegitimate child and its royal connections, attempt to blackmail Sickert. After Queen Victoria learns of the blackmail attempt, Gull is enlisted to silence the group of women. The police are granted prior knowledge of Gull&#x27;s intentions, and are adjured not to interfere until the plot is completed.

Gull, a high-ranking Freemason, murders the four women in Whitechapel with the aid of a carriage driver, John Netley. While he justifies the murders by claiming they are a Masonic warning to an apparent Illuminati threat to the throne, the killings are, in Gull&#x27;s mind, part of an elaborate mystical ritual to ensure male societal dominance over women. While targeting Kelly, Gull also kills Catherine Eddowes, who was using Kelly&#x27;s name as an alias. As the killings progress, Gull becomes psychologically unhinged and has a vision of the future while murdering a woman he believes to be Kelly.

Gull takes Netley on a tour of London landmarks, expounding on their hidden mystical significance. Later, Gull forces the semi-literate Netley to write the infamous From Hell letter. Following this, several people write letters to the police claiming to be the murderer, and the nickname &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot; becomes a household name.

Inspector Frederick Abberline, who once patrolled Whitechapel as a police officer, investigates the Ripper crimes without success. He meets Robert James Lees, a fraudulent psychic who acts as a spiritual advisor to Queen Victoria. Lees contacts Abberline and identifies Gull as the murderer. Abberline and Lees confront Gull, who instantly confesses. Abberline reports the confession to his superiors at Scotland Yard, who cover up the discovery. The police inform both Abberline and Lees that Gull was operating alone and was gripped by insanity. Abberline later discovers Gull&#x27;s intentions to cover up the matter of the royal &quot;bastard&quot; fathered by the Duke of Clarence. He resigns from the Metropolitan Police in protest of the official cover-up of the murders, and contemplates leaving England to join the Pinkertons.

Gull is tried by a secret Masonic council, which determines he is insane. Gull refuses to submit to the council, informing them that because of his accomplishments and his visions, no man amongst them may be counted as his peer and cannot judge the &quot;mighty work&quot; he has wrought. A phony funeral is staged, and Gull is imprisoned under a pseudonym &quot;Thomas Mason.&quot; The Freemasons frame boarding school teacher Montague Druitt as a suspect, killing him and making his death look like suicide. Years later, and moments before his death, Gull has an extended mystical experience, where his spirit travels through time, observing the crimes of the London Monster, instigating or inspiring a number of other killers (Peter Sutcliffe, Ian Brady), causing Netley&#x27;s death, as well as serving as the inspiration for both Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot; and William Blake&#x27;s painting &quot;The Ghost of a Flea&quot;. The last experience his spirit undergoes before it &quot;becomes God&quot; is visiting a woman living in Ireland. The woman has four children who are named after the women murdered by Gull in Whitechapel. She is apparently able to see Gull&#x27;s spirit, and abjures him to begone &quot;back to Hell.&quot;

==Interpretations and themes==
&quot;From Hell&quot; was partly inspired by the title of Douglas Adams&#x27; novel &quot;Dirk Gently&#x27;s Holistic Detective Agency&quot;, in that it explores the notion that to solve a crime holistically, one would need to solve the entire society in which it occurred.

&quot;From Hell&quot; also explores Moore&#x27;s ideas on the nature of time. Early on, Gull&#x27;s friend James Hinton discusses his son Howard&#x27;s theory of the &quot;fourth dimension&quot;, which proposes that time is a spatial dimension. All time co-exists, and it is only the limits of our perception that make it appear to progress. Sequences of related events can be seen as shapes in the fourth dimension: history can &quot;be said to have an architecture&quot;, as Gull puts it. Gull&#x27;s experiences seem to confirm this: he has visions of the 20th century during the murders, and as he is dying he experiences, and appears to influence, past and future events. Moore had earlier explored similar ideas in &quot;Watchmen&quot;, where Doctor Manhattan perceives past, present and future simultaneously, and describes himself as &quot;a puppet who can see the strings&quot;.

Critic Gary Groth says the most elaborate theme in &quot;From Hell&quot; stems from Moore&#x27;s statement that &quot;the Ripper murders ‚Äì happening when they did and where they did ‚Äì were almost like an apocalyptic summary of... that entire Victorian age.&quot;

==Awards==
&quot;From Hell&quot; won several Eisner Awards, including &quot;Best Serialized Story&quot; (1993), &quot;Best Writer&quot; (1995, 1996, 1997), and &quot;Best Graphic Album ‚Äì Reprint&quot; (2000). It won the 1995 Harvey Award for Best Continuing or Limited Series, and the collected edition won the 2000 Harvey Award for Best Graphic Album of Previously Published Work.

The book also won the 2000 Eagle Award for Favourite Trade Paperback/Reprint Collection, and the &quot;Prix de la critique&quot; at the Angoul√™me International Comics Festival in 2001, for the French edition published by √âditions Delcourt.

The collected edition was a top vote getter for the Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide Fan Award for Favorite Reprint Graphic Album in 1999.

During its initial serialization, &quot;From Hell&quot; received the 1996 International Horror Guild Award for Graphic Story/illustrated Narrative, and the 1997 Ignatz Award for Outstanding Story.

==Film adaptation==
A film, loosely based on the series, was made by the Hughes brothers in 2001, starring Johnny Depp, Heather Graham, and Ian Holm. It received mixed reviews from critics, with a rating of 57% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes.

==TV adaptation==
In 2015 it was reported that FX was developing a &quot;From Hell&quot; drama series with Don Murphy, who produced the 2001 film, as executive producer; David Arata was announced as the writer of the adaptation.

<doc id="45063" wikidata="Q318737" url="?curid=45063" title="Abelian category">
<text>In mathematics, an abelian category is a category in which morphisms and objects can be added and in which kernels and cokernels exist and have desirable properties.

The motivating prototypical example of an abelian category is the category of abelian groups, .

Abelian categories are very &quot;stable&quot; categories; for example they are regular and they satisfy the snake lemma. The class of abelian categories is closed under several categorical constructions, for example, the category of chain complexes of an abelian category, or the category of functors from a small category to an abelian category are abelian as well. These stability properties make them inevitable in homological algebra and beyond; the theory has major applications in algebraic geometry, cohomology and pure category theory.

Mac Lane says Alexander Grothendieck defined the abelian category, but there is a reference that says Eilenberg&#x27;s disciple, Buchsbaum, proposed the concept in his PhD thesis, and Grothendieck popularized it under the name &quot;abelian category&quot;.

==Definitions==
A category is abelian if it is &quot;preadditive&quot; and
*it has a zero object,
*it has all binary biproducts,
*it has all kernels and cokernels, and
*all monomorphisms and epimorphisms are normal.

This definition is equivalent to the following &quot;piecemeal&quot; definition:
* A category is &quot;preadditive&quot; if it is enriched over the monoidal category of abelian groups. This means that all hom-sets are abelian groups and the composition of morphisms is bilinear. 
* A preadditive category is &quot;additive&quot; if every finite set of objects has a biproduct. This means that we can form finite direct sums and direct products. In Def. 1.2.6, it is required that an additive category have a zero object (empty biproduct).
* An additive category is &quot;preabelian&quot; if every morphism has both a kernel and a cokernel.
* Finally, a preabelian category is abelian if every monomorphism and every epimorphism is normal. This means that every monomorphism is a kernel of some morphism, and every epimorphism is a cokernel of some morphism.

Note that the enriched structure on hom-sets is a &quot;consequence&quot; of the first three axioms of the first definition. This highlights the foundational relevance of the category of Abelian groups in the theory and its canonical nature.

The concept of exact sequence arises naturally in this setting, and it turns out that exact functors, i.e. the functors preserving exact sequences in various senses, are the relevant functors between abelian categories. This &quot;exactness&quot; concept has been axiomatized in the theory of exact categories, forming a very special case of regular categories.

==Examples==
* As mentioned above, the category of all abelian groups is an abelian category. The category of all finitely generated abelian groups is also an abelian category, as is the category of all finite abelian groups.
* If &quot;R&quot; is a ring, then the category of all left (or right) modules over &quot;R&quot; is an abelian category. In fact, it can be shown that any small abelian category is equivalent to a full subcategory of such a category of modules (&quot;Mitchell&#x27;s embedding theorem&quot;).
* If &quot;R&quot; is a left-noetherian ring, then the category of finitely generated left modules over &quot;R&quot; is abelian. In particular, the category of finitely generated modules over a noetherian commutative ring is abelian; in this way, abelian categories show up in commutative algebra.
* As special cases of the two previous examples: the category of vector spaces over a fixed field &quot;k&quot; is abelian, as is the category of finite-dimensional vector spaces over &quot;k&quot;.
* If &quot;X&quot; is a topological space, then the category of all (real or complex) vector bundles on &quot;X&quot; is not usually an abelian category, as there can be monomorphisms that are not kernels.
* If &quot;X&quot; is a topological space, then the category of all sheaves of abelian groups on &quot;X&quot; is an abelian category. More generally, the category of sheaves of abelian groups on a Grothendieck site is an abelian category. In this way, abelian categories show up in algebraic topology and algebraic geometry.
* If C is a small category and A is an abelian category, then the category of all functors from C to A forms an abelian category. If C is small and preadditive, then the category of all additive functors from C to A also forms an abelian category. The latter is a generalization of the &quot;R&quot;-module example, since a ring can be understood as a preadditive category with a single object.

==Grothendieck&#x27;s axioms==
In his T≈çhoku article, Grothendieck listed four additional axioms (and their duals) that an abelian category A might satisfy. These axioms are still in common use to this day. They are the following:
* AB3) For every indexed family (&quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot;) of objects of A, the coproduct *&quot;A&quot;i exists in A (i.e. A is cocomplete).
* AB4) A satisfies AB3), and the coproduct of a family of monomorphisms is a monomorphism.
* AB5) A satisfies AB3), and filtered colimits of exact sequences are exact.
and their duals
* AB3*) For every indexed family (&quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot;) of objects of A, the product P&quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot; exists in A (i.e. A is complete).
* AB4*) A satisfies AB3*), and the product of a family of epimorphisms is an epimorphism.
* AB5*) A satisfies AB3*), and filtered limits of exact sequences are exact.

Axioms AB1) and AB2) were also given. They are what make an additive category abelian. Specifically:
* AB1) Every morphism has a kernel and a cokernel.
* AB2) For every morphism &quot;f&quot;, the canonical morphism from coim &quot;f&quot; to im &quot;f&quot; is an isomorphism.

Grothendieck also gave axioms AB6) and AB6*).

* AB6) A satisfies AB3), and given a family of filtered categories formula_1 and maps formula_2, we have formula_3, where lim denotes the filtered colimit.
* AB6*) A satisfies AB3*), and given a family of cofiltered categories formula_1 and maps formula_2, we have formula_6, where lim denotes the cofiltered limit.

==Elementary properties==
Given any pair &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; of objects in an abelian category, there is a special zero morphism from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot;. This can be defined as the zero element of the hom-set Hom(&quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;), since this is an abelian group.
Alternatively, it can be defined as the unique composition &quot;A&quot; ‚Üí 0 ‚Üí &quot;B&quot;, where 0 is the zero object of the abelian category.

In an abelian category, every morphism &quot;f&quot; can be written as the composition of an epimorphism followed by a monomorphism.
This epimorphism is called the &quot;coimage&quot; of &quot;f&quot;, while the monomorphism is called the &quot;image&quot; of &quot;f&quot;.

Subobjects and quotient objects are well-behaved in abelian categories.
For example, the poset of subobjects of any given object &quot;A&quot; is a bounded lattice.

Every abelian category A is a module over the monoidal category of finitely generated abelian groups; that is, we can form a tensor product of a finitely generated abelian group &quot;G&quot; and any object &quot;A&quot; of A.
The abelian category is also a comodule; Hom(&quot;G&quot;,&quot;A&quot;) can be interpreted as an object of A.
If A is complete, then we can remove the requirement that &quot;G&quot; be finitely generated; most generally, we can form finitary enriched limits in A.

Given an object formula_7 in an abelian category, flatness refers to the idea that formula_8 is an exact functor. See flat module or, for more generality, flat morphism.

==Related concepts==
Abelian categories are the most general setting for homological algebra.
All of the constructions used in that field are relevant, such as exact sequences, and especially short exact sequences, and derived functors.
Important theorems that apply in all abelian categories include the five lemma (and the short five lemma as a special case), as well as the snake lemma (and the nine lemma as a special case).

=== Semi-simple Abelian categories ===

An abelian category formula_9 is called semi-simple if there is a collection of objects formula_10 called simple objects (meaning the only sub-objects of any formula_11 are the zero object formula_12 and itself) such that an object formula_13 can be decomposed as a direct sum (denoting the coproduct of the abelian category)formula_14This technical condition is rather strong and excludes many natural examples of abelian categories found in nature. For example, most module categories over a ring formula_15 are not semi-simple; in fact, this is the case if and only if formula_15 is a semisimple ring.

==== Examples ====
Some abelian categories found in nature are semi-simple, such as

* The category of vector spaces formula_17 over a fixed field formula_18.
* By Maschke&#x27;s theorem the category of representations formula_19 of a finite group formula_20 over a field formula_18 whose characteristic does not divide formula_22 is a semi-simple abelian category.
* The category of coherent sheaves on a Noetherian scheme is semi-simple if and only if formula_23 is a finite disjoint union of irreducible points. This is equivalent to a finite coproduct of categories of vector spaces over different fields. Showing this is true in the forward direction is equivalent to showing all formula_24 groups vanish, meaning the cohomological dimension is 0. This only happens when the skyscraper sheaves formula_25 at a point formula_26 have Zariski tangent space equal to zero, which is isomorphic to formula_27 using local algebra for such a scheme.

==== Non-examples ====
There do exist some natural counter-examples of abelian categories which are not semi-simple, such as certain categories of representations. For example, the category of representations of the Lie group formula_28 has the representationformula_29which only has one subrepresentation of dimension formula_30. In fact, this is true for any unipotent grouppg 112.

==Subcategories of abelian categories==
There are numerous types of (full, additive) subcategories of abelian categories that occur in nature, as well as some conflicting terminology.

Let A be an abelian category, C a full, additive subcategory, and &quot;I&quot; the inclusion functor.
* C is an exact subcategory if it is itself an exact category and the inclusion &quot;I&quot; is an exact functor. This occurs if and only if C is closed under pullbacks of epimorphisms and pushouts of monomorphisms. The exact sequences in C are thus the exact sequences in A for which all objects lie in C.
* C is an abelian subcategory if it is itself an abelian category and the inclusion &quot;I&quot; is an exact functor. This occurs if and only if C is closed under taking kernels and cokernels. Note that there are examples of full subcategories of an abelian category that are themselves abelian but where the inclusion functor is not exact, so they are not abelian subcategories (see below).
* C is a thick subcategory if it is closed under taking direct summands and satisfies the 2-out-of-3 property on short exact sequences; that is, if formula_31 is a short exact sequence in A such that two of formula_32 lie in C, then so does the third. In other words, C is closed under kernels of epimorphisms, cokernels of monomorphisms, and extensions. Note that P. Gabriel used the term &quot;thick subcategory&quot; to describe what we here call a &quot;Serre subcategory&quot;.
* C is a topologizing subcategory if it is closed under subquotients.
* C is a Serre subcategory if, for all short exact sequences formula_31 in A we have &quot;M&quot; in C if and only if both formula_34 are in C. In other words, C is closed under extensions and subquotients. These subcategories are precisely the kernels of exact functors from A to another abelian category.
* C is a localizing subcategory if it is a Serre subcategory such that the quotient functor formula_35 admits a right adjoint.
* There are two competing notions of a wide subcategory. One version is that C contains every object of A (up to isomorphism); for a full subcategory this is obviously not interesting. (This is also called a lluf subcategory.) The other version is that C is closed under extensions.

Here is an explicit example of a full, additive subcategory of an abelian category that is itself abelian but the inclusion functor is not exact. Let &quot;k&quot; be a field, formula_36 the algebra of upper-triangular formula_37 matrices over &quot;k&quot;, and formula_38 the category of finite-dimensional formula_36-modules. Then each formula_38 is an abelian category and we have an inclusion functor formula_41 identifying the simple projective, simple injective and indecomposable projective-injective modules. The essential image of &quot;I&quot; is a full, additive subcategory, but &quot;I&quot; is not exact.

== History ==
Abelian categories were introduced by (under the name of &quot;exact category&quot;) and in order to unify various cohomology theories. At the time, there was a cohomology theory for sheaves, and a cohomology theory for groups. The two were defined differently, but they had similar properties. In fact, much of category theory was developed as a language to study these similarities. Grothendieck unified the two theories: they both arise as derived functors on abelian categories; the abelian category of sheaves of abelian groups on a topological space, and the abelian category of &quot;G&quot;-modules for a given group &quot;G&quot;.

<text>The Transnational Radical Party (TRP), whose official name is Nonviolent Radical Party, Transnational and Transparty (NRPTT), is a political association of citizens, members of parliament and members of government of various national and political backgrounds who intend to adopt nonviolent means to create an effective body of international law with respect for individuals, human, civil and political rights, as well as the affirmation of democracy and political freedom in the world. The TRP does not participate in elections and, despite being named &quot;party&quot;, is a non-governmental organization (NGO), with consultative status at the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) of the United Nations (UN) since 1995, adept in building synergies among political forces aimed at achieving the goals of its congressional motions.

The TRP is the direct evolution of the Radical Party, a political party in Italy, active from 1955 to 1989, and is a separate entity from the once-connected Italian Radicals party, founded in 2001 as PRT&#x27;s section in the country.

The TRP often advocates the international use of Esperanto in its literature.

==History==
The TRP&#x27;s forerunner, the Radical Party (PR), was established in 1955 by a left-wing splinter group from the centre-right Italian Liberal Party (PLI), under the leadership of Marco Pannella. In 1989, the PR was transformed into the TRP. In 1992, a majority of Italy&#x27;s Radicals formed, at the national-level in Italian politics, the Pannella List. Since 1999, Radicals ran in elections under the banner of Bonino List, named after Emma Bonino. After a breakthrough in the 1999 European Parliament election, Italy&#x27;s Radicals formed the Italian Radicals (RI).

===Background and foundation===
In the 1979 European Parliament election, the first in which voters voted directly for the European Parliament, the PR obtained its best result ever countrywide (3.7% of the vote, resulting in the election of three MEPs, including Pannella). Following the election, the PR was involved with the Coordination of European Green and Radical Parties (CEGRP) and its unsuccessful efforts to create a single pan-European platform for green and radical politics. More importantly, since then, the party projected itself into international politics.

In 1988, after a decade during which transnational issues and values were emphasised, the PR&#x27;s congress decided that the party would be transformed during 1989 into the TRP and that the latter would not present itself in elections (in order to avoid competition with the other parties and stimulate cooperation instead), while permitting &quot;dual membership&quot; with other parties. The new symbol featuring the stylised face of Mahatma Gandhi was the point of no return in the transformation of the PR into an instrument of political fight completely at disposal of issue-oriented campaigns.

All this provoked great controversy among Radicals. Some long-time members left in order to continue their own activity in other parties or retire from public life. However, also most TRP Radicals continued to be actively engaged in politics, sometimes supported by the TRP itself, sometimes seeking hospitality in traditional parties or creating entirely new electoral lists. In the 1989 European Parliament election Pannella stood as a successful candidate of the joint list between the PLI (his former party) and the Italian Republican Party, some Radicals formed the &quot;Anti-prohibition List on Drugs&quot; (1 MEP), while others joined the Rainbow Greens (2 MEPs). In the run-up of the 1992 general election the Pannella List was formed.

Sergio Stanzani and Emma Bonino were the first secretary and president of the party, respectively. In 1993 Bonino, who would be appointed to the European Commission in 1995, replaced Stanzani, and Pannella became president.

===International activities and ECOSOC recognition===
The TRP was soon involved in comparing the conditions of the rule of law among different democracies throughout the world. While its members and economic resources continued to come primarily from Italy, the party strengthened its activities worldwide, especially in the countries of post-communist Eastern Europe. In this respect, the TRP launched the Multilingual Telematics System, one of the first bulletin board systems in Italy to allow multiple connections at the same time with the many countries where the party had influence and membership.

In 1995, after an intense institutional work, the TRP became a non-governmental organization for the promotion of human rights&#x27; legislation and the affirmation of democracy and freedom worldwide. As such, it was granted the general consultative status at the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) of the United Nations (UN).

Also in 1995, Olivier Dupuis, a long-time Radical from Belgium and founding member of the TRP who had moved to Budapest, Hungary in 1988 and from there had coordinated TRP&#x27;s activities in Eastern Europe, was elected secretary of the party, while Jean-Fran√ßois Hory, a French MEP of the Radical Party of the Left within the TRP-sponsored European Radical Alliance group, was president. In 1996, Dupuis took Pannella&#x27;s seat in the European Parliament.

Within the UN, the party has been involved in a variety of issues: the moratorium on the death penalty and the proposal of a complete abolition, anti-prohibition against global mafias, fair justice, freedom of scientific research and the ban on female genital mutilation. Additionally, the TRP has allowed access to UN meetings to some stateless people, including Tibetans, Uyghurs and Montagnards, and led active monitoring of conflicts, such as the case of Ukraine versus Russia, or gave voice to dissidents opposed to authoritarian regimes like Cuba and Turkey. For its proposal of a peace plan in the Chechen‚ÄìRussian conflict, the party has collided with Russia and its members risked expulsion from the country.

===&quot;Italian plague&quot;, decline and internal crisis===
Radicals have often accused the Italian media of ignoring their initiatives and focusing merely on internal conflicts within the Radical world. The inadequate information on Radical initiatives by the Italian media has been meticulously verified by the TRP-sponsored &quot;Centro d&#x27;Ascolto dell&#x27;Informazione Radiotelevisiva&quot; and produced several sentences featuring compensations to be paid by RAI, the Italian public broadcaster, and commercial TV as well. Some confusion came from the fact that since the 2000s, rather than highlighting its expansion abroad, the TRP has preferred to focus on the &quot;Case Italy&quot;, emblematic of the decadence of a constitutional political system into a &quot;real democracy&quot;, that is to say a formal democracy in which its very institutions substantially act in contrast with the constitution. According to the TRP, Italy has become a &quot;partycratic regime&quot; and, as such, has started to spread the &quot;plague&quot; of &quot;real democracy&quot; around the democratic world. That was denounced by Radicals within international organisations and though the publication of a &quot;yellow book&quot; on the &quot;Italian plague&quot;.

However, the TRP effectively suffered internal problems too. In 2003 Dupuis resigned from secretary because of serious political differences with Pannella. In 2011‚Äì14 Demba Traor√©, a politician from Mali, served briefly as secretary: he left the party without officially resigning, after being returned to the government of his own country. The TRP was later provisionally run by a committee, known as the &quot;senate&quot;, led by Pannella and composed of the party&#x27;s leading members.

===Re-organisation and break-up with Italian Radicals===
After the death of Pannella in May 2016, an extraordinary congress was convened in September to overcome the long inactivity due to the absence of the secretary, as well as the economic problems undermining the party&#x27;s viability. The congress adopted with 178 votes in favour, 79 against and 13 abstentions on the final resolution:
*set three main goals (1. affirmation of the rule of law and the human right of knowledge; 2. justice reform in Italy, including pardon, amnesty, abolition of the article 41-bis prison regime and of life sentences; 3. formation of the United States of Europe, inspired on the Ventotene Manifesto);
*set a membership target of 3,000 members for 2017 and 2018 in order to pay for the party&#x27;s debts, otherwise the TRP would be dissolved;
*suspended the party&#x27;s organs (secretary, president, treasurer, senate, etc.), with the exception of the congress;
*elected a collective leadership led by Rita Bernardini, Antonella Casu, Sergio D&#x27;Elia and Maurizio Turco (legal representative).

The minority faction, led by Bonino and Marco Cappato, in turn, controlled the RI, as confirmed in their November 2016 congress. In February 2017 the TRP severed its ties with the RI (accused of boycotting the TRP, using its assets without paying for them and pursuing an Italian-only electoral agenda), and the latter could no longer use the Radical headquarters. However, the RI&#x27;s congress invited its members to adhere to the TRP. The 3,000-member target for 2017 was achieved by the TRP in December, while the RI had launched a pro-Europeanist electoral list named More Europe for the 2018 Italian general election.

With the 2019 congress, the TRP, having met the membership targe of 3,000 both in 2017 and 2018, returned to regular business. The new elected leadership included Turco as secretary, Diego Sabatinelli as president of the newly-formed general council and Irene Testa as treasurer, as well as three honorary presidents (Ettore Cannavera, Michael Giffoni and Gaia Tortora).

In 2024, the TRP announced an electoral pact with Forza Italia for the 2024 European Parliament election.

<text>Phrase structure rules are a type of rewrite rule used to describe a given language&#x27;s syntax and are closely associated with the early stages of transformational grammar, proposed by Noam Chomsky in 1957. They are used to break down a natural language sentence into its constituent parts, also known as syntactic categories, including both lexical categories (parts of speech) and phrasal categories. A grammar that uses phrase structure rules is a type of phrase structure grammar. Phrase structure rules as they are commonly employed operate according to the constituency relation, and a grammar that employs phrase structure rules is therefore a &quot;constituency grammar&quot;; as such, it stands in contrast to &quot;dependency grammars&quot;, which are based on the dependency relation.

==Definition and examples==
Phrase structure rules are usually of the following form:

:formula_1

meaning that the constituent formula_2 is separated into the two subconstituents formula_3 and formula_4. Some examples for English are as follows:

:&lt;chem&gt;S -&gt; NP \quad VP&lt;/chem&gt;
:&lt;chem&gt;NP -&gt; (Det) \quad N1&lt;/chem&gt;
:&lt;chem&gt;N1 -&gt; (AP) \quad N1 \quad (PP)&lt;/chem&gt;

The first rule reads: A S (sentence) consists of a NP (noun phrase) followed by a VP (verb phrase). The second rule reads: A noun phrase consists of an optional Det (determiner) followed by a N (noun). The third rule means that a N (noun) can be preceded by an optional AP (adjective phrase) and followed by an optional PP (prepositional phrase). The round brackets indicate optional constituents.

Beginning with the sentence symbol S, and applying the phrase structure rules successively, finally applying replacement rules to substitute actual words for the abstract symbols, it is possible to generate many proper sentences of English (or whichever language the rules are specified for). If the rules are correct, then any sentence produced in this way ought to be grammatically (syntactically) correct. It is also to be expected that the rules will generate syntactically correct but semantically nonsensical sentences, such as the following well-known example:

::Colorless green ideas sleep furiously

This sentence was constructed by Noam Chomsky as an illustration that phrase structure rules are capable of generating syntactically correct but semantically incorrect sentences. Phrase structure rules break sentences down into their constituent parts. These constituents are often represented as tree structures (dendrograms). The tree for Chomsky&#x27;s sentence can be rendered as follows:

A constituent is any word or combination of words that is dominated by a single node. Thus each individual word is a constituent. Further, the subject NP &quot;Colorless green ideas&quot;, the minor NP &quot;green ideas&quot;, and the VP &quot;sleep furiously&quot; are constituents. Phrase structure rules and the tree structures that are associated with them are a form of immediate constituent analysis.

In transformational grammar, systems of phrase structure rules are supplemented by transformation rules, which act on an existing syntactic structure to produce a new one (performing such operations as negation, passivization, etc.). These transformations are not strictly required for generation, as the sentences they produce could be generated by a suitably expanded system of phrase structure rules alone, but transformations provide greater economy and enable significant relations between sentences to be reflected in the grammar.

==Top down==
An important aspect of phrase structure rules is that they view sentence structure from the top down. The category on the left of the arrow is a greater constituent and the immediate constituents to the right of the arrow are lesser constituents. Constituents are successively broken down into their parts as one moves down a list of phrase structure rules for a given sentence. This top-down view of sentence structure stands in contrast to much work done in modern theoretical syntax. In Minimalism for instance, sentence structure is generated from the bottom up. The operation Merge merges smaller constituents to create greater constituents until the greatest constituent (i.e. the sentence) is reached. In this regard, theoretical syntax abandoned phrase structure rules long ago, although their importance for computational linguistics seems to remain intact.

==Alternative approaches==
===Constituency vs. dependency===
Phrase structure rules as they are commonly employed result in a view of sentence structure that is &quot;constituency-based&quot;. Thus, grammars that employ phrase structure rules are &quot;constituency grammars&quot; (= phrase structure grammars), as opposed to &quot;dependency grammars&quot;, which view sentence structure as &quot;dependency-based&quot;. What this means is that for phrase structure rules to be applicable at all, one has to pursue a constituency-based understanding of sentence structure. The constituency relation is a one-to-one-or-more correspondence. For every word in a sentence, there is at least one node in the syntactic structure that corresponds to that word. The dependency relation, in contrast, is a one-to-one relation; for every word in the sentence, there is exactly one node in the syntactic structure that corresponds to that word. The distinction is illustrated with the following trees:

The constituency tree on the left could be generated by phrase structure rules. The sentence S is broken down into smaller and smaller constituent parts. The dependency tree on the right could not, in contrast, be generated by phrase structure rules (at least not as they are commonly interpreted).

===Representational grammars===
A number of representational phrase structure theories of grammar never acknowledged phrase structure rules, but have pursued instead an understanding of sentence structure in terms the notion of schema. Here phrase structures are not derived from rules that combine words, but from the specification or instantiation of syntactic schemata or configurations, often expressing some kind of semantic content independently of the specific words that appear in them. This approach is essentially equivalent to a system of phrase structure rules combined with a noncompositional semantic theory, since grammatical formalisms based on rewriting rules are generally equivalent in power to those based on substitution into schemata.

So in this type of approach, instead of being derived from the application of a number of phrase structure rules, the sentence &quot;Colorless green ideas sleep furiously&quot; would be generated by filling the words into the slots of a schema having the following structure:

::[NP[ADJ N] VP[V] AP[ADV]]

And which would express the following conceptual content:

::X DOES Y IN THE MANNER OF Z

Though they are non-compositional, such models are monotonic. This approach is highly developed within Construction grammar and has had some influence in Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar and lexical functional grammar, the latter two clearly qualifying as phrase structure grammars.

<text>Semantic properties or meaning properties are those aspects of a linguistic unit, such as a morpheme, word, or sentence, that contribute to the meaning of that unit. Basic semantic properties include being &quot;meaningful&quot; or &quot;meaningless&quot; ‚Äì for example, whether a given word is part of a language&#x27;s lexicon with a generally understood meaning; &quot;polysemy&quot;, having multiple, typically related, meanings; &quot;ambiguity&quot;, having meanings which aren&#x27;t necessarily related; and &quot;anomaly&quot;, where the elements of a unit are semantically incompatible with each other, although possibly grammatically sound. Beyond the expression itself, there are higher-level semantic relations that describe the relationship between units: these include synonymy, antonymy, and hyponymy.

Besides basic properties of semantics, semantic property is also sometimes used to describe the semantic components of a word, such as &quot;man&quot; assuming that the referent is &quot;human&quot;, &quot;male&quot;, and &quot;adult&quot;, or &quot;female&quot; being a common component of &quot;girl&quot;, &quot;woman&quot;, and &quot;actress&quot;. In this sense, semantic properties are used to define the semantic field of a word or set of words.

==Semantic properties of nouns==

Semantic properties of nouns/entities can be divided into eight classes: specificity, boundedness, animacy, gender, kinship, social status, physical properties, and function.

Physical properties refer to how an entity exists in space. It can include shape, size, and material, for example.

The function class of semantic properties refers to noun class markers that indicate the purpose of an entity or how humans utilize an entity. For example, in the Dyirbal language, the morpheme &quot;balam&quot; marks each entity in its noun class with the semantic property of edibility, and Burmese encodes the semantic property for the ability to cut or pierce. Encoding the functional property for transportation, housing, and speech are also attested in world languages.

<text>A semantic class contains words that share a semantic feature. For example within nouns there are two sub classes, concrete nouns and abstract nouns. The concrete nouns include people, plants, animals, materials and objects while the abstract nouns refer to concepts such as qualities, actions, and processes. According to the nature of the noun, they are categorized into different semantic classes. Semantic classes may intersect. The intersection of &quot;female&quot; and &quot;young&quot; can be &quot;girl&quot;.

<doc id="45072" wikidata="Q16928266" url="?curid=45072" title="Semantic feature">
<text>A semantic feature is a component of the concept associated with a lexical item (&#x27;female&#x27; + &#x27;performer&#x27; = &#x27;actress&#x27;). More generally, it can also be a component of the concept associated with any grammatical unit, whether composed or not (&#x27;female&#x27; + &#x27;performer&#x27; = &#x27;the female performer&#x27; or &#x27;the actress&#x27;). 
An individual semantic feature constitutes one component of a word&#x27;s intention, which is the inherent sense or concept evoked.
Linguistic meaning of a word is proposed to arise from contrasts and significant differences with other words.
Semantic features enable linguistics to explain how words that share certain features may be members of the same semantic domain.
Correspondingly, the contrast in meanings of words is explained by diverging semantic features.
For example, &quot;father&quot; and &quot;son&quot; share the common components of &quot;human&quot;, &quot;kinship&quot;, &quot;male&quot; and are thus part of a semantic domain of male family relations.
They differ in terms of &quot;generation&quot; and &quot;adulthood&quot;, which is what gives each its individual meaning.

== Theoretical context ==
The analysis of semantic features is utilized in the field of linguistic semantics, more specifically the subfields of lexical semantics, and lexicology.
One aim of these subfields is to explain the meaning of a word in terms of their relationships with other words.
In order to accomplish this aim, one approach is to analyze the internal semantic structure of a word as composed of a number of distinct and minimal components of meaning.
This approach is called componential analysis, also known as semantic decomposition.
Semantic decomposition allows any given lexical item to be defined based on minimal elements of meaning, which are called semantic features.
The term &quot;semantic feature&quot; is usually used interchangeably with the term &quot;semantic component&quot;.
Additionally, semantic features/semantic components are also often referred to as semantic properties.

The theory of componential analysis and semantic features is not the only approach to analyzing the semantic structure of words.
An alternative direction of research that contrasts with componential analysis is prototype semantics.

== Notation ==
The semantic features of a word can be notated using a binary feature notation common to the framework of componential analysis.
A semantic property is specified in square brackets and a plus or minus sign indicates the existence or non-existence of that property.

* &quot;cat&quot; is
** [+animate],
** [+domesticated],
** [+feline]
* &quot;puma&quot; is
** [+animate],
** [‚àídomesticated],
** [+feline]
* &quot;dog&quot; is
** [+animate],
** [+domesticated],
** [‚àífeline]
* &quot;wolf&quot; is
** [+animate],
** [‚àídomesticated]
** [‚àífeline]

Intersecting semantic classes share the same features.
Some features need not be specifically mentioned as their presence or absence is obvious from another feature.
This is a redundancy rule.

<text>Lyon Sprague de Camp (; November 27, 1907 ‚Äì November 6, 2000) was an American author of science fiction, fantasy and non-fiction literature. In a career spanning 60 years, he wrote over 100 books, both novels and works of non-fiction, including biographies of other fantasy authors. He was a major figure in science fiction in the 1930s and 1940s.

==Biography==
De Camp was born in New York City, one of three sons of Lyon de Camp, a businessman in real estate and lumber, and Emma Beatrice Sprague. His maternal grandfather was the accountant, banker, pioneering Volap√ºkist and Civil War veteran Charles Ezra Sprague. De Camp once noted that he rarely used pen-names, &quot;partly because my own true name sounds more like a pseudonym than most pseudonyms do.&quot;

De Camp began his education at the Trinity School in New York, then spent ten years attending the Snyder School in North Carolina, a military-style institution. His stay at the Snyder School was an attempt by his parents, who were heavy-handed disciplinarians, to cure him of intellectual arrogance and lack of discipline. He was awkward and thin, an ineffective fighter, and suffered from bullying by his classmates. His experiences at the school taught him to develop a detached, analytical style considered cold by all but his closest friends, though he could, like his father, be disarming and funny in social situations. He would later recall these challenging childhood experiences in the semi-autobiographical story &quot;Judgment Day&quot; (1955).

An aeronautical engineer by education, de Camp conducted his undergraduate studies at the California Institute of Technology (where his roommate was at one point noted rocket fuel scientist John Drury Clark), and earned his Bachelor of Science degree from Caltech in Aeronautical Engineering 1930. He earned his Master of Science degree in Engineering from the Stevens Institute of Technology in 1933. De Camp was also a surveyor and an expert in patents.

His first job was with the Inventors Foundation, Inc. in Hoboken, New Jersey, which was taken over by The International Correspondence Schools. De Camp transferred to the Scranton, Pennsylvania, division. He was principal of the School of Inventing and Patenting when he resigned in 1937. His first book &quot;Inventions and Their Management&quot; resulted. It was published in July 1937.

On August 12, 1939, de Camp married Catherine Crook, with whom he collaborated on science fiction and nonfiction beginning in the 1960s. They had two children.

During World War II, de Camp served as a researcher at the Philadelphia Naval Yard along with his fellow writers Isaac Asimov and Robert A. Heinlein. De Camp eventually rose to the rank of lieutenant commander in the U.S. Navy as a reserve officer. From 1942 to 1989, the de Camps generally lived near Philadelphia; for decades their home was in Villanova, Pennsylvania.

De Camp was a member of the all-male literary and dining club the &quot;Trap Door Spiders&quot; in New York City, which served as the basis of Asimov&#x27;s fictional group of mystery solvers the &quot;Black Widowers.&quot; De Camp himself was the model for the character named &quot;Geoffrey Avalon.&quot;

De Camp was a founding member of the Swordsmen and Sorcerers&#x27; Guild of America (SAGA), a loosely knit group of Heroic fantasy writers that was founded during the 1960s and led by Lin Carter, with entry by credentials as a fantasy writer alone.

The de Camps moved to Plano, Texas, in 1989, and Sprague de Camp died there on November 6, 2000, seven months after his wife, on what would have been her birthday, at age 92. His ashes were inurned, together with hers, in the Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.

De Camp&#x27;s personal library of about 1,200 books was acquired for auction by Half Price Books in 2005. The collection included books inscribed by fellow writers, such as Isaac Asimov and Carl Sagan, as well as de Camp himself.

==Coinage of &quot;Extraterrestrial&quot; and &quot;E.T.&quot;==
&quot;Extraterrestrial&quot;, a coinage from &quot;extra&quot; + &quot;terrestrial&quot;, meaning from beyond earth, is attested as an adjective as early as 1868, according to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;. Its first use in connection with &quot;life&quot; beyond earth was likely by H. G. Wells, in his 1898 novel &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;. L. Sprague de Camp is credited with its first usage as a noun with the meaning of &quot;alien life&quot; and with coining the abbreviation &quot;E.T.&quot; in the first part of his two-part article &quot;Design for Life&quot;, published in the May 1939 issue of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;.

==Hypothesis regarding sea serpent sightings==
De Camp made a suggestion in 1968 that fossil discoveries had influenced modern reports of sea monster sightings. The suggestion was made in his article &quot;Dinosaurs in Today&#x27;s World&quot; in &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot; v. 34, no. 3, March 1968, later reprinted in his nonfiction collection &quot;The Fringe of the Unknown&quot;, Buffalo, New York: Prometheus, 1983. In 2019 de Camp&#x27;s theory was scientifically tested by C. G. M. Paxton and D. Naish, who concluded that trends in the data of reported sightings appear to support his hypothesis.

==Body of work==

De Camp was a materialist who wrote works examining society, history, technology and myth. He published numerous short stories, novels, non-fiction works and poems during his long career.

De Camp had the mind of an educator, and a common theme in many of his works is a corrective impulse regarding similar previous works by other authors. A highly rational and logical thinker, he was frequently disturbed by what he regarded as logical lapses and absurdities in others&#x27; writings. Some, like Asimov, felt de Camp&#x27;s conscientiousness about facts limited the scope of his stories: de Camp was reluctant to use technological or scientific concepts (e.g., hyperspace or faster-than-light travel) if he regarded them as impossible. Thus, his response to Mark Twain&#x27;s &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#x27;s Court&quot; was to write a similar time travel novel (&quot;Lest Darkness Fall&quot;) in which the method of time travel was rationalized and the hero&#x27;s technical expertise both set at a believable level and constrained by the technological limitations of the age.

In like fashion, he reimagined space opera and planetary romance in his &quot;Viagens Interplanetarias&quot; series, and the prehistoric precursor civilizations characteristic of much heroic fantasy in his Pusadian series. When he was not debunking literary conventions he was often explaining them. For example, in the Harold Shea stories co-written with his longtime friend Fletcher Pratt (1897‚Äì1956), the magical premises of some bodies of myths and legends were accepted but examined and elucidated in terms of their own systems of inherent logic. The imaginative civilizations in &quot;The Compleat Enchanter&quot;, for example, are built upon a cultural and technological reality based on scientific formulas. Characters may be transported to these different worlds, but the magic contained within those worlds is only feasible to the extent that it coincides with the technology of the day (e.g., the combustion engine). De Camp&#x27;s explanatory tendency also carried over into his non-fictional writings, including advice to science fiction writers on handling the different states of languages in future worlds.

===Science fiction===
De Camp&#x27;s science fiction is marked by his interests in linguistics, ancient history, and the history and philosophy of science. His first published story was &quot;The Isolinguals&quot;, in the September 1937 issue of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;‚Äîthe last issue edited by F. Orlin Tremaine, prior to the long tenure of John W. Campbell. Most of his early science fiction stories were unrelated to each other, the exceptions being his &quot;Johnny Black&quot; tales about a black bear uplifted to human-level intelligence, and his &quot;Drinkwhiskey Institute&quot; stories, a series of tall tales involving time travel. Campbell&#x27;s fantasy magazine, &quot;Unknown&quot;, was suited to de Camp&#x27;s idiosyncratic imagination, logic, and sense of humor. He contributed ten novels (five as collaborations), much of it characterized by humor and dry wit. De Camp eschewed the intention of being a satirist, insisting, instead, that the stories he wrote were meant less for instruction or improvement, as satire requires, and more for the amusement of his readers.

De Camp&#x27;s treatment of time travel and alternate history in stories such as &quot;Lest Darkness Fall&quot; (1939), &quot;The Wheels of If&quot; (1940), &quot;A Gun for Dinosaur&quot; (1956), &quot;Aristotle and the Gun&quot; (1958), and &quot;The Glory That Was&quot; (1960) challenged the popular notion of his time that history consisted of an arbitrary series of accidents. Instead, de Camp, through sound background knowledge and logical thought, systematically demonstrated how technological advances could determine the pattern of an eventful history. His display of technological determinism in historical recreation is considered a &quot;tour de force.&quot; &quot;Lest Darkness Fall&quot;, &quot;The Wheels of If&quot; and &quot;Aristotle and the Gun&quot; have been recognized as seminal works in the field of alternate history.

His most extended work was his &quot;Viagens Interplanetarias&quot; series, set in a future where Brazil is the dominant power, particularly a sub-series of sword and planet novels set on the planet Krishna, beginning with &quot;The Queen of Zamba&quot;. His most influential &quot;Viagens&quot; novel was the non-Krishna work &quot;Rogue Queen&quot;, a tale of a hive society undermined by interstellar contact, which was one of the earliest science fiction novels to deal with sexual themes.

===Fantasy===
De Camp was best known for his light fantasy, particularly two series written in collaboration with Pratt, the Harold Shea stories (from 1940 et seq.) and Gavagan&#x27;s Bar (from 1950). Floyd C. Gale in 1961 said that they &quot;were far and away the finest team of fantasy collaborators&quot;. De Camp and Pratt also wrote some stand-alone novels similar in tone to the Harold Shea stories, of which the most highly regarded is &quot;Land of Unreason&quot; (1942), and de Camp wrote a few more of this genre on his own.

He was also known for his sword and sorcery, a fantasy genre revived partly by his editorial work on and continuation of Robert E. Howard&#x27;s Conan cycle. He also edited a series of fantasy anthologies credited with helping to spark the renaissance of heroic fantasy in the late 1960s.

De Camp also created three noteworthy sword and sorcery sequences. The Pusadian series (from 1951), composed of the novel &quot;The Tritonian Ring&quot; and several short stories, is set in an antediluvian era similar to Howard&#x27;s.

More substantial is the Novarian series (from 1968), of which the core is the &quot;Reluctant King&quot; trilogy, beginning with &quot;The Goblin Tower&quot;, de Camp&#x27;s most accomplished effort in the genre, continuing in &quot;The Clocks of Iraz&quot;, and concluding with &quot;The Unbeheaded King&quot;. The trilogy features the adventurer Jorian, ex-king of Xylar. Jorian&#x27;s world is an alternate reality to which our own serves as an afterlife. Other novels in the sequence include &quot;The Fallible Fiend&quot;, a satire told from the point of view of a demon, and &quot;The Honorable Barbarian&quot;, a follow-up to the trilogy featuring Jorian&#x27;s brother as the hero.

The Incorporated Knight series comprises some 1970s short stories by de Camp and two novels written in collaboration with Catherine Crook de Camp, &quot;The Incorporated Knight&quot; (1988) and &quot;The Pixilated Peeress&quot; (1991). The early short stories were incorporated into the first of these. The sequence is set in the medieval era of another alternate world sharing the geography of our own, but in which a Neapolitan empire filled the role of Rome and no universal religion like Christianity ever arose, leaving its nations split among competing pagan sects. The setting is borrowed in part from &quot;Mandeville&#x27;s Travels&quot;.

===Historical fiction===
De Camp also wrote historical fiction set in the era of classical antiquity from the height of the First Persian Empire to the waning of the Hellenistic period. Five novels published by Doubleday from 1958 to 1969 form a loosely connected series based on their common setting and occasional cross references. They were also linked by a common focus on the advancement of scientific knowledge, de Camp&#x27;s chosen protagonists being explorers, artisans, engineers, innovators and practical philosophers rather than famous names from antiquity, who are relegated to secondary roles. The best known of his historical novels is &quot;The Dragon of the Ishtar Gate&quot;.

===Nonfiction===

De Camp&#x27;s first book was &quot;Inventions and Their Management&quot;, co-written with Alf K. Berle and published by International Textbook Company in 1937: a 733-page book with a three-page list of law cases cited.

He enjoyed debunking doubtful history and pseudoscientific claims about the supernatural. He conducted extensive research for what was to be a book on magic, witchcraft and occultism, though only the first chapter, &quot;The Unwritten Classics&quot; (March 1947), was published in the &quot;Saturday Review of Literature&quot;. By May 1976, concerned with what Paul Kurtz described as &quot;an enormous increase in public interest in psychic phenomena, the occult and pseudoscience,&quot; de Camp joined the newly formed Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal along with astronomers George Abell, Bart Bok, and Carl Sagan; philosophers Brand Blanshard, Antony Flew, Sidney Hook, and Ernest Nagel; authors Isaac Asimov, Daniel Cohen, Charles Fair, Martin Gardner, and Phillip J. Klass; psychologists Ray Hyman and B.F Skinner; and magician James Randi. Despite being a long-time writer of fantasy, de Camp did not believe in ghosts in the supernatural sense. His ghosts dwelt only in his mind as memories of his parents. His mother, he wrote in a &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot; article, died of an overdose of faith healing. When considering claims of UFO sightings, astrology, and other subjects considered moot by the scientific community, de Camp would address the circular logic expressed by enthusiasts by insisting on first-hand, unbiased, measurable data to back up the claims. &quot;In the history of cultism,&quot; de Camp said in a Science News interview, &quot;one is always experiencing a feeling of deja vu.&quot;

He explained how ancient civilizations produced structures and architecture that many considered to be impossible for them, such as the Pyramids of Ancient Egypt. Works in this area include &quot;Lost Continents&quot;, &quot;Citadels of Mystery&quot;, and &quot;The Ancient Engineers&quot;.

Some others of his many and wide-ranging nonfiction works were &quot;The Great Monkey Trial&quot; (about the Scopes Trial), &quot;The Ragged Edge of Science&quot;, &quot;Energy and Power&quot;, &quot;The Heroic Age of American Invention&quot;, &quot;The Day of the Dinosaur&quot; (which argued, among other things, that evolution took hold after Darwin because of the Victorian interest spurred by recently popularized dinosaur remains, corresponding to legends of dragons), &quot;Great Cities of the Ancient World&quot; and &quot;The Evolution of Naval Weapons&quot; (a United States government textbook).

Published in the July 1938 issue of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;, &quot;Language for Time Travelers&quot; won de Camp the first non-fiction readership monthly honor awarded in the magazine for his exploration of the communication difficulties for time travelers as pronunciation and semantics shift over time.

De Camp&#x27;s pioneering biographies of fantasy writers were many short articles and full-length studies of Robert E. Howard and H. P. Lovecraft, the first major independent biographies of both writers. Matthew Hartman, in a review of de Camp&#x27;s &quot;Lovecraft: A Biography&quot;, stated that de Camp &quot;does not defend his subject; he criticizes where criticism is due, and he explains in historical and sociological context, rather than attempting to excuse.&quot; De Camp&#x27;s &quot;warts and all&quot; approach to his subjects has been branded by some fans as unflattering and unbalanced. For instance, Mark Finn, author of &quot;Blood &amp; Thunder: The Life &amp; Art of Robert E. Howard&quot;, contends that de Camp deliberately framed his questions in regard to Howard to elicit answers matching his Freudian theories about him.

De Camp also wrote nonfiction radio scripts for Voice of America.

De Camp wrote a number of lesser-known but nonetheless significant works that explored such topics as racism, which he wrote could be more accurately described as ethnocentrism, noting that no scholar comparing the merits of various ethnicities has ever sought to prove that his own ethnicity was inferior to others. Isaac Asimov recalled de Camp finding the tendency of authors to portray human characters in outer-space science fiction as superior to aliens analogous to northern Europeans imagining they had some inherent superiority over other races.

==Awards and honors==
De Camp and Willy Ley won the 1953 International Fantasy Award for nonfiction recognizing their study of geographical myths, &quot;Lands Beyond&quot; (Rinehart, 1952). De Camp was a guest of honor at the 1966 World Science Fiction Convention, and was named the third Gandalf Grand Master of Fantasy, after Tolkien and Fritz Leiber, at the 1976 convention. The Science Fiction Writers of America made him its fourth SFWA Grand Master in 1979 and he won the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement in 1984, a Special Achievement Sidewise Award for Alternate History in 1996, citing &quot;seminal works in the field,&quot; and the Hugo Award for Nonfiction in 1997 for his autobiography, &quot;Time and Chance&quot;.

At a meeting of the executive council of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI) in Denver, Colorado, in April 2011, De Camp was selected for inclusion in CSI&#x27;s Pantheon of Skeptics. The Pantheon of Skeptics was created by CSI to remember the legacy of deceased fellows of CSI and their contributions to the cause of scientific skepticism. CSI was previously known as the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP).

==In popular culture==
L. Sprague de Camp has been depicted in fictional works by a number of other authors. Randall Garrett conflated him with J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s Gandalf in the character of the magician &quot;Sir Lyon Gandolphus Gray&quot; in his Lord Darcy series. He was the model for the &quot;Geoffrey Avalon&quot; character in Isaac Asimov&#x27;s fictional group of mystery solvers the &quot;Black Widowers,&quot; and the unnamed court magician in Lawrence Watt-Evans&#x27; &quot;Return to Xanadu&quot; (&quot;The Enchanter Completed: A Tribute Anthology for L. Sprague de Camp&quot;, 2005).

He also appears without fictional disguise in the short stories &quot;Green Fire&quot; by Eileen Gunn, Andy Duncan, Pat Murphy, and Michael Swanwick (&quot;Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction&quot;, April 2000) and &quot;Father Figures&quot; by Susan Shwartz (&quot;The Enchanter Completed: A Tribute Anthology for L. Sprague de Camp&quot;, 2005), and in the novels &quot;In the Courts of the Crimson Kings&quot; (2008) by S. M. Stirling and &quot;The Astounding, the Amazing, and the Unknown&quot; (2011) by Paul Malmont.

A semi-fictionalized version of de Camp appears in the third episode of the 2017 TV series &quot;&quot;, as one of several academics and authors consulted by the FBI on the basis of the citation of their work in the Unabomber manifesto. In the scene depicting this meeting, de Camp&#x27;s name appears on a placard as &quot;L. Sprague de Camp, S.A.G.A. Author, &quot;The Ancient Engineers&quot;.&quot; De Camp&#x27;s name does not specifically appear in the episode credits, which identify the roles of actors in the scene as composite characters. &quot;The Ancient Engineers&quot; is cited in endnote 18 of the manifesto.

<text>Sixth Column, also known under the title The Day After Tomorrow, is a science fiction novel by American writer Robert A. Heinlein, based on a then-unpublished story by editor John W. Campbell, and set in a United States that has been conquered by the PanAsians, who are asserted to be neither Japanese nor Chinese. Originally published as a serial in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; (January, February, and March 1941, using the pen name Anson MacDonald) it was published in hardcover in 1949. It is most known for its race-based premise.

==Plot summary==
A top secret research facility hidden in the Colorado mountains is the last remaining outpost of the United States Army after its defeat by the PanAsians. The conquerors had absorbed the Soviets after being attacked by them and had then gone on to absorb India as well. The invaders are ruthless and cruel. As an example, they crush an abortive rebellion by killing 150,000 American civilians as punishment. Noting that the invaders have allowed the free practice of religion (the better to pacify their slaves), the Americans set up their own church in order to build a resistance movement ‚Äì a &quot;sixth column&quot;, as opposed to a traitorous fifth column.

The laboratory is in turmoil as the novel begins. All but six of the personnel have died suddenly, due to unknown forces released by an experiment operating within the newly discovered magneto-gravitic or electro-gravitic spectra. The surviving scientists soon learn that they can selectively kill people by releasing the internal pressure of their cell membranes, among other things. Using this discovery, they construct a race-selective weapon that will stun or kill only Asians.

== Background ==
The idea for the story of &quot;Sixth Column&quot; was proposed by John W. Campbell, who had written a similar unpublished story called &quot;All&quot; (it would eventually be published in the anthology &quot;The Space Beyond&quot;). Heinlein would later write that he &quot;had to reslant it to remove racist aspects of the original story line&quot; and he also wrote that he did not &quot;consider it to be an artistic success.&quot;

Heinlein&#x27;s work on Campbell&#x27;s &quot;All&quot; was considerably more than just a re-slanting; Campbell&#x27;s story was felt to be unpublishable as it stood, written in a pseudo-archaic dialect (sometimes inconsistently), and provided no scientific explanations for miraculous powers of the American super-weapons, which the PanAsians have no explanation for other than to conclude that weapons&#x27; powers must be divine. Science fiction writer-critic George Zebrowski believed that Heinlein intended the novel&#x27;s Calhoun, who, after going insane, believes the false religion created by the Americans, as a parody of Campbell himself. The bulk of Heinlein&#x27;s work on the novel, e.g. the explanations of the weapons&#x27; effectiveness and the strategy for the Americans&#x27; rebellion, is not present in &quot;All&quot;.

==Reception==
Boucher and McComas found the novel to be &quot;a fine example of serious pulp science fiction.&quot; P. Schuyler Miller compared &quot;Sixth Column&quot; to &quot;the old E. Phillips Oppenheim or modern Eric Ambler intrigue, thrust and counterthrust with civilization at stake.&quot;

==Portrayal of racism==

The book was serialized in early 1941, at a time that the Second Sino-Japanese War was in its fourth year and large parts of China had been occupied in brutal fashion by the Japanese. The book is notable for its frank portrayal of racism on both sides. The conquerors regard themselves as a chosen people predestined to rule over lesser races, and they refer to white people as slaves. &quot;Three things only do slaves require: work, food, and their religion.&quot; They demand outward signs of respect, such as jumping promptly into the gutter when a member of the chosen race walks by, and the slightest hesitation to show the prescribed courtesies earns a swagger stick across the face. One character is Frank Mitsui, an Asian American whose family was murdered by the invaders because they did not fit in the new PanAsiatic racial order. The Americans in the novel respond to their conquerors&#x27; racism by often referring to them in unflattering terms, such as &quot;flat face&quot; and &quot;slanty&quot;.

&quot;Sixth Column&quot; and &quot;Farnham&#x27;s Freehold&quot;, another novel by Heinlein, both center on the issue of race.

<doc id="45077" wikidata="Q172599" url="?curid=45077" title="Giacomo Leopardi">
<text>Count Giacomo Taldegardo Francesco di Sales Saverio Pietro Leopardi (29 June 1798 ‚Äì 14 June 1837) was an Italian philosopher, poet, essayist, and philologist. Considered the greatest Italian poet of the 19th century and one of the greatest authors of his time worldwide, as well as one of the principals of literary Romanticism, his constant reflection on existence and on the human condition‚Äîof sensuous and materialist inspiration‚Äîhas also earned him a reputation as a deep philosopher. He is widely seen as one of the most radical and challenging thinkers of the 19th century but routinely compared by Italian critics to his older contemporary Alessandro Manzoni despite expressing &quot;diametrically opposite positions.&quot; Although he lived in a secluded town in the conservative Papal States, he came into contact with the main ideas of the Enlightenment, and, through his own literary evolution, created a remarkable and renowned poetic work, related to the Romantic era. The strongly lyrical quality of his poetry made him a central figure on the European and international literary and cultural landscape.

==Biography==
Leopardi was born into a local noble family in Recanati, in the Marche, at the time ruled by the papacy. His father, Count Monaldo Leopardi, who was fond of literature and a committed reactionary, remained an advocate of traditional ideals. His mother, Marchioness Adelaide Antici Mattei, was a cold and authoritarian woman, obsessed with rebuilding the family&#x27;s financial fortunes, which had been destroyed by her husband&#x27;s gambling addiction. A rigorous discipline of religion and economy reigned in the home. However, Giacomo&#x27;s happy childhood, which he spent with his younger brother Carlo Orazio and his sister Paolina, left its mark on the poet, who recorded his experiences in the poem &quot;Le Ricordanze&quot;.

Following a family tradition, Leopardi began his studies under the tutelage of two priests, but his thirst for knowledge was quenched primarily in his father&#x27;s rich library. Initially guided by Father Sebastiano Sanchini, Leopardi undertook vast and profound reading. These &quot;mad and most desperate&quot; studies included an extraordinary knowledge of classical and philological culture¬†‚Äì he could fluently read and write Latin, ancient Greek and Hebrew¬†‚Äì but he lacked an open and stimulating formal education.

Between the ages of twelve and nineteen, he studied constantly, driven also by a need to escape spiritually from the rigid environment of the paternal palazzo. His continual studies undermined an already fragile physical constitution, and his illness, probably Pott&#x27;s disease or ankylosing spondylitis, denied him youth&#x27;s simplest pleasures. He was 1.65 meters (5¬†ft 5 in) tall, but his health problems led him to stand only 1,41m (4 feet 8 inches) tall.

In 1817 the classicist Pietro Giordani arrived at the Leopardi estate. He became a lifelong friend of Giacomo, who derived from this a sense of hope for the future. Meanwhile, his life at Recanati weighed on him increasingly, to the point where he attempted to escape in 1818, but he was caught by his father and brought home. Thereafter relations between father and son continued to deteriorate, and Giacomo was constantly monitored by the rest of the family.

When in 1822 he was briefly able to stay in Rome with his uncle, he was deeply disappointed by its atmosphere of corruption and decadence and by the hypocrisy of the Church. He was impressed by the tomb of Torquato Tasso, to whom he felt bound by a common sense of unhappiness. While Foscolo lived tumultuously between adventures, amorous relations, and books, Leopardi was barely able to escape from his domestic oppression. To Leopardi, Rome seemed squalid and modest when compared to the idealized image that he had created of it. He had already suffered disillusionment in love at home, with his cousin Geltrude Cassi. Meanwhile, his physical ailments continued to worsen.

In 1824, a bookstore owner, Stella, called him to Milan, asking him to write several works, including &quot;Crestomazia della prosa e della poesia italiane&quot;. He moved during this period between Milan, Bologna, Florence and Pisa. In 1827 in Florence, Leopardi met Alessandro Manzoni, although they did not see things eye to eye. He paid a visit to Giordani and met the historian Pietro Colletta.


In 1828, physically infirm and worn out by work, Leopardi refused the offer of a professorship in Bonn or Berlin, made by the Ambassador of Prussia in Rome. In the same year, he had to abandon his work with Stella and return to Recanati. In 1830, Colletta offered him a chance to return to Florence, thanks to a financial contribution from the &quot;Friends of Tuscany&quot;. The subsequent printing of the &quot;Canti&quot; allowed him to live away from Recanati until 1832. Leopardi found kindred company among the liberals and republicans seeking to liberate Italy from its yoke to Austria. Although his idiosyncratic and pessimistic ideas made him a party of one, he railed against Italy&#x27;s &quot;state of subjection&quot; and was &quot;in sympathy with the ideals of constitutionalism, republicanism and democracy, and supportive of movements urging Italians to fight for their independence.&quot;

Later he moved to Naples near his friend Antonio Ranieri, hoping to benefit physically from the climate. Here he became a close friend of the Freemason Alessandro Poerio, while since 1817 he had an intimate and confidential correspondance with the Freemason Pietro Giordani.

Leopardi died during the cholera epidemic of 1837, the immediate cause probably being pulmonary edema or heart failure, due to his fragile physical condition. Thanks to Antonio Ranieri&#x27;s intervention with the authorities, Leopardi&#x27;s remains were not buried in a common grave (as the strict hygiene regulations of the time required), but in the atrium of the Church of San Vitale at Fuorigrotta. In 1898 his tomb was moved to the Parco Virgiliano (Mergellina) and declared a national monument.

There has been speculation in academic circles that Leopardi may have had homoromantic tendencies. His intimate friendships with other men, particularly Ranieri, involved expressions of love and desire beyond what was typical even of Romantic poets. In an account of his time in Tuscany, it was written that he &quot;became frenzied about love&quot; whenever in the presence of the handsome younger brother of a woman he and Ranieri both admired (Fanny Targioni-Tozzetti), and that when so frenzied he would direct his sentiments towards Ranieri. In 1830, Leopardi received a letter from Pietro Colletta, nowadays interpreted as a declaration of masonic brotherhood. Leopardi&#x27;s close friend Antonio Ranieri was a Master Mason. Nonetheless, over the course of his life Leopardi had more than twenty-five sentimental female friendships, such as the ones with Teresa Carniani Malvezzi or Charlotte Napol√©one Bonaparte.

The Leopardi family share the origin of Tomasi&#x27;s family, at the time of the Roman emperor Constantine the Great.

==Poetical works==
===First academic writings (1813‚Äì1816)===
These were rough years for Leopardi, as he started developing his concept of Nature. At first, he saw this as &quot;benevolent&quot; to mankind, helping to distract people from their sufferings. Later, by 1819, his idea of Nature became dominated by a destructive mechanism.

Up to 1815, Leopardi was essentially an erudite philologist. Only thereafter he began to dedicate himself to literature and the search for beauty, as he affirms in a famous letter to Giordani of 1817. &quot;Pompeo in Egitto&quot; (&quot;Pompey in Egypt&quot;, 1812), written at the age of fourteen, is an anti-Caesar manifesto. Pompey is seen as the defender of republican liberties. &quot;Storia dell&#x27;Astronomia&quot; (&quot;History of Astronomy&quot;, 1813) is a compilation of all of the knowledge accumulated in this field up to the time of Leopardi. From the same year is &quot;Saggio sopra gli errori popolari degli antichi&quot; (&quot;Essay on the popular errors of the ancients&quot;), which brings the ancient myths back to life. The &quot;errors&quot; are the fantastic and vague imaginings of the ancients. Antiquity, in Leopardi&#x27;s vision, is the infancy of the human species, which sees the personifications of its myths and dreams in the stars.

The year 1815 saw the production of &quot;Orazione agli Italiani in Occasione della Liberazione del Piceno&quot; (&quot;Oration to the Italians on the liberation of Piceno&quot;), a paean to the &#x27;liberation&#x27; achieved by Italy after the intervention of the Austrians against Murat. In the same year he translated &quot;Batracomiomachia&quot; (the war between the frogs and mice in which Zeus eventually sends in the crabs to exterminate them all), an ironic rhapsody which pokes fun at Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, once attributed to the epic poet himself.

In 1816 Leopardi published &quot;Discorso sopra la vita e le opere di Frontone&quot; (&quot;Discourse on the life and works of Fronto&quot;). In the same year, however, he entered a period of crisis. He wrote &quot;L&#x27;appressamento della morte&quot;, a poem in &quot;terza rima&quot; in which the poet experiences death, which he believes to be imminent, as a comfort. Meanwhile, there began other physical sufferings and a serious degeneration of his eyesight. He was acutely aware of the contrast between the interior life of man and his incapacity to manifest it in his relations with others.

Leopardi abandoned his philological studies and moved increasingly toward poetry by reading Italian authors of the 14th, 16th and 17th centuries, as well as some of his Italian and French contemporaries. His vision of the world underwent a change: he ceased to seek comfort in religion, which had permeated his childhood, and became increasingly inclined toward an empirical and mechanistic vision of the universe inspired by John Locke among others.

In 1816 the idylls &quot;Le rimembranze&quot; and &quot;Inno a Nettuno&quot; (&quot;Hymn to Neptune&quot;) were published. The second, written in ancient Greek, was taken by many critics as an authentic Greek classic. He also translated the second book of the &quot;Aeneid&quot; and the first book of the &quot;Odyssey&quot;. In the same year, in a letter to the compilers of the &quot;Biblioteca Italiana&quot; (Monti, Acerbi, Giordani), Leopardi argued against Madame de Sta√´l&#x27;s article inviting Italians to stop looking to the past, but instead study the works of foreigners, so as to reinvigorate their literature. Leopardi maintained that &quot;knowing&quot;, which is acceptable, is not the same thing as &quot;imitating&quot;, which is what Madame de Stael demanded, and that Italian literature should not allow itself to be contaminated by modern forms of literature, but look to the Greek and Latin classics. A poet must be original, not suffocated by study and imitation: only the first poet in the history of humanity could have been truly original, since he had had no one to influence him. It was, therefore, necessary to get as close to the originals as possible, by drawing inspiration from one&#x27;s own feelings, without imitating anyone.

Thanks to his friendship with Giordani, with whom, in 1817, he had begun a prolific correspondence, his distancing from the conservatism of his father became even sharper. It was in the following year that he wrote &quot;All&#x27;Italia&quot; (&quot;To Italy&quot;) and &quot;Sopra il monumento di Dante&quot; (&quot;On the Monument of Dante&quot;), two very polemical and classical patriotic hymns in which Leopardi expressed his adherence to liberal and strongly secular ideas.

In the same period, he participated in the debate, which engulfed the literary Europe of the time, between the classicists and the romanticists, affirming his position in favour of the first in the &quot;Discorso di un Italiano attorno alla poesia romantica&quot; (&quot;Discourse of an Italian concerning romantic poetry&quot;).

In 1817 he fell in love with Gertrude Cassi Lazzari and wrote &quot;Memorie del primo amore&quot; (&quot;Memories of first love&quot;). In 1818 he published &quot;Il primo amore&quot; and began writing a diary which he would continue for fifteen years (1817‚Äì1832), the &quot;Zibaldone&quot;.

===The first &quot;canti&quot; (1818)===

&quot;All&#x27;Italia&quot; and &quot;Sopra il monumento di Dante&quot; marked the beginning of the series of major works. In the two &quot;canti&quot;, the concept of &quot;excessive&quot; or &quot;over-civilization&quot; which is deleterious for life and beauty first makes its appearance. In the poem &quot;All&#x27;Italia&quot;, Leopardi laments the fallen at the Battle of Thermopylae (480 BC, fought between the Greeks under Leonidas and the Persians under Xerxes), and evokes the greatness of the past. In the second &quot;canto&quot;, he turns to Dante and asks him for pity for the pathetic state of his fatherland. In the great &quot;canti&quot; which follow (forty-one, including fragments), there is a gradual abandonment of the reminiscences, of literary allusions and of conventionalisms.

In 1819, the poet attempted to escape from his oppressive domestic situation, by travelling to Rome. But he was caught by his father. In this period, his personal pessimism evolves into the peculiar philosophical pessimism of Leopardi. &quot;Le Rimembranze&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;appressamento della morte&quot; also belong to this early period of the art of Leopardi.

===The &quot;Idilli&quot; (1819‚Äì1821)===
The six &quot;Idilli&quot; (&quot;Idylls&quot;), namely &quot;Il sogno&quot; (&quot;The dream&quot;), &quot;L&#x27;Infinito&quot; (&quot;The Infinite&quot;), &quot;La sera del d√¨ di festa&quot; (&quot;The evening of the feast day&quot;), &quot;Alla Luna&quot; (&quot;To the Moon&quot;), &quot;La vita solitaria&quot; (&quot;The solitary life&quot;) and &quot;Lo spavento notturno&quot; (&quot;Night-time terror&quot;), followed hard upon the first canti. &quot;Il sogno&quot; is still Petrarchesque, while the others which followed are the fruit of a more mature and independent art. Leopardi establishes with nature a sort of accord which attenuates the pain and discomfort.

In all of the idylls, the initial sparks, offered by memory or by the sweetness of nature, transmute their colours into the intuition of universal pain, of the transience of things, of the oppressive weight of eternity, of the inexorable passing of time, of the blind power of nature.

====&quot;L&#x27;Infinito&quot;====
 The highest expression of poetry is reached in Leopardi in &quot;L&#x27;Infinito&quot;, which is at once philosophy and art, since in the brief harmony of the verses are concentrated the conclusions of long philosophical meditations. The theme is a concept, which the mind can only with extreme difficulty conceive. The poet narrates an experience he often has when he sits in a secluded place on a hill. His eyes cannot reach the horizon, because of a hedge surrounding the site; his thought, instead, is able to imagine spaces without limits:

&lt;poem style=&quot;padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;&quot;Sempre caro mi fu quest&#x27;ermo colle,
E questa siepe, che da tanta parte
Dell&#x27;ultimo orizzonte il guardo esclude.&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

Another interpretation suggests that this hill represents the heights human thought achieves, but at the top, there is a hedge that prevents one from seeing the ultimate horizon, beyond death and existence. Thus this hedge can be interpreted as signifying the limits of human understanding regarding human existence in the Universe. This is why the poem begins with &quot;Sempre caro mi fu&quot; which can be translated as &quot;It was always precious for me&quot;. The silence is deep; when a breath of wind comes, this voice sounds like the voice of present time, and by contrast, it evokes all times past, and eternity. Thus, the poet&#x27;s thought is overwhelmed by new and unknown suggestions, but &quot;il naufragar m&#x27;√® dolce in questo mare&quot; (&quot;shipwreck / seems sweet to me in this sea.&quot; English translation by A. S. Kline).

===The &quot;Canzoni&quot; (1820‚Äì1823)===
Leopardi returns to the evocation of ancient eras and exhorts his contemporaries to seek in the writings of the classics the noble ancient virtues.

====&quot;Ad Angelo Mai&quot;====
On the occasion of the discovery of the &quot;De Republica&quot; of Cicero on the part of Mai, Leopardi wrote the poem &quot;Ad Angelo Mai&quot; (&quot;To Angelo Mai&quot;) in which he invokes the figures of many Italian poets, from Dante and Petrarch to Torquato Tasso whom he felt so near to himself, to his contemporary Vittorio Alfieri.

====&quot;Nelle nozze della sorella Paolina&quot;====
In the lyrical &quot;Nelle nozze&quot; (&quot;On the marriage of my sister Paolina&quot;), an event that failed to happen, in the course of wishing happiness for his sister, the poet uses the opportunity to exalt the strength and the virtue of the women of antiquity and to denigrate his own time because it did not allow one to be virtuous and happy, since only after death are those who have lived a morally good life praised.

====&quot;Ad un vincitor di pallone&quot;====
The canto &quot;Ad un vincitor di pallone&quot; (&quot;To the winner of a ballgame&quot;) expresses disdain for the tedium of a life that is nothing but a monotonous repetition of human affairs and to which only danger can restore value: only he who has been near the gates of death is able to find sweetness in life.

====&quot;Bruto minore&quot;====
In &quot;Bruto minore&quot; (&quot;Brutus the Younger&quot;), Brutus the assassin of Caesar is depicted as a man who has always believed in honour, virtue and liberty and who has ultimately sacrificed everything for these ideals. He has come to the realization, too late to change things, that everything was done in vain, that everything has been pointless, and that he will even die dishonoured and disgraced for his well-intentioned actions.

His meditations bring him to the conclusion that morality is meaningless; Jove rewards only the selfish and plays arbitrary games with hapless mankind. Man is more unhappy than the rest of the animal kingdom because the latter do not know that they are unhappy and therefore do not meditate on the question of suicide and, even if they could, nothing would prevent them from carrying out the act without hesitation.

====&quot;Ultimo canto di Saffo&quot;====
Sappho is also a tragic figure. In fact, she is a great and generous spirit, an exceptional mind and a sublime character trapped in a miserable body. Sappho loved the light (the loved one, according to the legend, was named Phaon, in Greek Œ¶Œ¨œâŒΩ, from œÜ·ø∂œÇ, light) but her life was made of shadow; she loved nature and beauty, but nature has been like an evil stepmother to her and she, who is sensitive, cultured and refined, is closed in the prison of a deformed body. Nor can the greatness of her genius help to release her from this horror.

In Sappho, Leopardi sees himself retarded, but in reality, the poet of Lesbos was neither deformed nor unhappy as she is depicted by Leopardi, who based his depiction on a false traditional belief. Sappho knew, tasted, and sang of beauty and love more than was possible for Leopardi. But the resignation to unhappiness, to pain and to solitude, and the renunciation of the joys of life, sounds in the verses of Leopardi like the sincere sigh of a feminine soul.

The canto begins as a sweet apostrophe to the placid nights, once dear to the serene poet, but the words turn rapidly to a violent evocation of nature in tempest which echoes her inner turmoil. The anguishing and accusative questions which Leopardi poses to a destiny which has denied beauty to the miserable Sappho are cut short by the thought of death. After having wished to the man she has loved in vain that little bit of happiness which is possible to attain on this earth, Sappho concludes by affirming that of all the hopes for joy, of all the illusions, there remains to await her only Tartarus.

====&quot;Alla primavera&quot; and &quot;Al conte Carlo Pepoli&quot;====
The canti &quot;Alla primavera&quot; (&quot;To Spring&quot;) and &quot;Al conte Carlo Pepoli&quot; (&quot;To Count Carlo Pepoli&quot;) emerge from the same spiritual situation. The first laments the fall of the great illusions (&quot;gli ameni inganni&quot;) and the imaginary mythological worlds of the past, which embellished and enriched the fantasy of man. The second decries the loss of happiness that has resulted.

In &quot;Alla primavera&quot;, Leopardi praises the ancient times when the nymphs populated the fields, the woods, the springs, the flowers and the trees. Although the lyrical style is apparently classical, it is also pervaded by the characteristic dissatisfaction with the presence of the romantics. Leopardi, here, romanticizes the pure intentions of the Greeks, since he was actually romantic in his sentiments and classical in his imagination and intellect.

In the &quot;Epistolario a Carlo Pepoli&quot;, Leopardi attempts to prove to his friend the thesis (reminiscent of Buddhism) according to which, since life has no other aim but happiness and since happiness is unattainable, all of life is nothing but an interminable struggle. But he who refuses to work is oppressed by the tedium of life and must seek distraction in useless pastimes. Moreover, those who dedicate themselves to poetry, if they have no fatherland, are tormented more than those who do by a lack of freedom because they fully appreciate the value of the idea of nationhood.

At this point, a disillusioned Leopardi considers abandoning poetry for philosophy, but without any hope of glory. He has resigned himself to the certainty of pain and of boredom to which mankind is condemned and he therefore believes it necessary to abandon the illusions and poetry in order to speculate on the laws and destiny of the universe.

====&quot;Alla sua donna&quot;====
In 1823, he wrote the canto &quot;Alla sua donna&quot; (&quot;To his woman&quot;), in which he expresses his ardent aspiration for a feminine ideal which, with love, might render life beautiful and desirable. During his youth, he had dreamt in vain of encountering a woman who embodied such a feminine ideal: a platonic idea, perfect, untouchable, pure, incorporeal, evanescent, and illusory.

It is a hymn not to one of Leopardi&#x27;s many &quot;loves&quot;, but to the discovery that he had unexpectedly made‚Äîat that summit of his life from which he would later decline‚Äîthat what he had been seeking in the lady he loved was &quot;something&quot; beyond her, that was made visible in her, that communicated itself through her, but was beyond her. This beautiful hymn to Woman ends with this passionate invocation:

===&quot;Operette morali&quot; (1824)===

Between the years 1823 and 1828, Leopardi set aside lyric poetry in order to compose his prose magnum opus, &quot;Operette morali&quot; (&quot;Small Moral Works&quot;), which consists (in its final form) of a series of 24 innovative dialogues and fictional essays treating a variety of themes that had already become familiar to his work by then. One of the most famous dialogues is: &quot;Dialogo della Natura e di un Islandese&quot;, in which the author expresses his main philosophical ideas.

===&quot;Canti Pisano-Recanatesi&quot; (1823‚Äì1832)===
After 1823, Leopardi abandoned the myths and illustrious figures of the past, which he now considered to be transformed into meaningless symbols and turned to writing about suffering in a more &quot;cosmic&quot; sense.

====&quot;Il Risorgimento&quot;====
In 1828, Leopardi returned to lyric poetry with &quot;Il Risorgimento&quot; (&quot;Resurgence&quot;). The poem is essentially a history of the spiritual development of the poet from the day in which he came to believe that every pulse of life had died out in his soul to the moment in which the lyrical and the sentimental were reawakened in him. A strange torpor had rendered him apathetic, indifferent to suffering, to love, to desire, and to hope. Life had seemed desolate to him until the ice began to melt and the soul, reawakening, finally felt the revivification of the ancient illusions. Having reconquered the gift of sentiment, the poet accepts life as it is because it is revived by the feeling of suffering which torments his heart and, so long as he lives, he will not rebel against those who condemn him to live. This recovered serenity consists in the contemplation of one&#x27;s own conscience of one&#x27;s own sentiments, even when desolation and despair envelop the soul.

Leopardi rejoices to have rediscovered in himself the capacity to be moved and to experience pain, after a long period of impassibility and boredom. With &quot;Risorgimento&quot;, lyricism is reawakened in the poet, who composes canti, generally brief, in which a small spark or a scene is expanded, extending itself into an eternal vision of existence. He revokes images, memories and moments of past happiness.

====&quot;A Silvia&quot;====
In 1828, Leopardi composed perhaps his most famous poem, &quot;A Silvia&quot; (&quot;To Silvia&quot;). The young lady of the title‚Äîpossibly the daughter of a servant in the Leopardi household‚Äîis the image of the hopes and illusions of the young poet, destined to succumb far too early in the struggle against reality, just as the youth of Silvia is destroyed by tuberculosis, the &quot;chiuso morbo&quot;. It is often asked whether Leopardi was actually in love with this young woman, but to seek confirmation in biographical evidence is to miss the point of the poem. &quot;A Silvia&quot; is the expression of a profound and tragic &quot;love of life&quot; itself, which Leopardi, despite all the suffering, the psychological torments and the negative philosophizing, could not suppress in his spirit. This poem demonstrates why Leopardi&#x27;s so-called &quot;nihilism&quot; does not run deep enough to touch the well-spring of his poetry: his love of man, of nature, and of beauty. However, the accusation Leopardi makes against Nature is very strong, as being responsible for the sweet dreams of youth and for the subsequent suffering, after &quot;the appearance of truth&quot; (&quot;l&#x27;apparir del vero&quot;, v.60) has shattered them.

====&quot;Il passero solitario&quot;====
The canto &quot;Il passero solitario&quot; (&quot;The Lonely Sparrow&quot;) is of a classical perfection for the structure of the verses and for the sharpness of the images. Leopardi contemplates the bounty of nature and the world which smiles at him invitingly, but the poet has become misanthropic and disconsolate with the decline of his health and youth and the deprivation of all joy. He senses the feast which nature puts forth to him, but is unable to take part in it and foresees the remorse which will assail him in the years to come when he will regret the youthful life that he never lived. In this sense, he is alone just like, or worse than, the sparrow, since the latter lives alone by instinct, while the poet is endowed with reason and free will.

====&quot;Le Ricordanze&quot;====
In 1829, at Recanati, where he was constrained to return, against his wishes, because of increasing infirmity and financial difficulties, the poet wrote &quot;Le Ricordanze&quot; (&quot;Memories&quot;), perhaps the poem where autobiographical elements are the most evident. It narrates the story of the painful joy of the man who feels his sentiments to be stirred by seeing again places full of childhood and adolescence memories. These sentiments now confront a horrible and merciless reality and deep regret for lost youth. The ephemeral happiness is embodied in Nerina (a character perhaps based on the same inspiration as Silvia, Teresa Fattorini).

Nerina and Silvia are both dreams, evanescent phantasms; life for Leopardi is an illusion, the only reality being death. The woman, Silvia, Nerina, or &quot;la sua donna&quot; is always only the reflection of the poet himself, since life itself is, for him, an elusive and deceptive phantasm.

====&quot;La quiete dopo la tempesta&quot;====
In 1829, Leopardi wrote &quot;La quiete dopo la tempesta&quot; (&quot;The Calm After the Storm&quot;), in which the light and reassuring verses at the beginning evolve into the dark desperation of the concluding strophe, where pleasure and joy are conceived of as only momentary cessations of suffering and the highest pleasure is provided only by death. It also delegates his dignity onto the crowd nor grieving himself on the sorrows he is obsessed and afterwards, his prowess dominates.

====&quot;Il sabato del villaggio&quot;====
The same year&#x27;s &quot;Il sabato del villaggio&quot; (&quot;Saturday in the village&quot;), like &quot;La quiete dopo la tempesta&quot;, opens with the depiction of the calm and reassuring scene of the people of the village (Recanati) preparing for Sunday&#x27;s rest and feast. Later, just as in the other poem, it expands into deep, though brief and restrained, poetic-philosophical considerations on the emptiness of life: the joy and illusion of expectation must come to an unsatisfactory end in the Sunday feast; likewise, all the sweet dreams and expectations of youth will turn into bitter disillusion.

====&quot;Canto notturno di un pastore errante dell&#x27;Asia&quot;====
Around the end of 1829 or the first months of 1830, Leopardi composed the &quot;Canto notturno di un pastore errante dell&#x27;Asia&quot; (&quot;Night-time chant of a wandering Asian sheep-herder&quot;). In writing this piece, Leopardi drew inspiration from the reading of &quot;Voyage d&#x27;Orenbourg √† Boukhara fait en 1820&quot;, by the Russian baron Meyendorff, in which the baron tells of how certain sheep-herders of central Asia belonging to the Kirghiz population practised a sort of ritual chant consisting of long and sweet strophes directed at the full moon. The canto, which is divided into five strophes of equal length, takes the form of a dialogue between a sheepherder and the moon. The canto begins with the words &quot;Che fai tu Luna in ciel? Dimmi, che fai, / silenziosa Luna?&quot; (&quot;What do you do Moon in the sky? Tell me, what do you do, / silent Moon?&quot;). Throughout the entire poem, in fact, the moon remains silent, and the dialogue is transformed therefore into a long and urgent existential monologue of the sheep-herder, in desperate search of explanations to provide a sense to the pointlessness of existence. The two characters are immersed in an indeterminate space and time, accentuating the universal and symbolic nature of their encounter: the sheep-herder represents the human species as a whole and his doubts are not contingent‚Äîthat is, anchored to a here and now‚Äîbut are rather characteristic of man at all times; the moon, on the other hand, represents Nature, the &quot;beautiful and terrible&quot; force that fascinates and, at the same time, terrifies the poet.

The sheepherder, a man of humble condition, directs his words to the moon in a polite but insistent tone, seething with melancholy. It is precisely the absence of response on the part of the celestial orb which provokes him to continue to investigate, ever more profoundly, into the role of the moon, and therefore into that of humanity, with respect to life and the world, defining ever more sharply the &quot;arid truth&quot; so dear to the poetry of Leopardi. In the first strophe, in fact, the sheep-herder, even while defining the moon as silent, actually expects a response from it and discovers many analogies between his own condition and that of the moon: both of them arise in the morning, follow their always self-identical paths and finally stop to rest. The life of the moon, as much as that of the sheep-herder, seems completely senseless. There appears, however, in the middle of this strophe, a very important distinction: the course of human life is finite and its passage, similar to that of a &quot;vecchierel bianco&quot; (Petrarch, &quot;Canzoniere&quot;, XVI), terminates tragically in the &quot;horrid abyss&quot; of death. Such a condition, which is defined in the second strophe as a condition of profound suffering (&quot;se la vita √® sventura, perch√© da noi si dura?&quot;) is extremely different from that of the Moon, which seems instead to be eternal, &quot;virgin&quot;, and &quot;intact&quot;.

In the third strophe, the sheep-herder turns again to the moon with renewed vigour and hope, believing that the orb, precisely because of this privileged extra-worldly condition, can provide him with the answers to his most urgent questions: what is life? What could possibly be its purpose since it is necessarily finite? What is the first cause of all being? But the moon, as the sheep-herder learns quickly, cannot provide the answers to these questions even if it knew them, since such is nature: distant, incomprehensible, mute if not indifferent to the concerns of man. The sheepherder&#x27;s search for sense and happiness continues all the way to the final two strophes. In the fourth, the sheep-herder turns to his flock, observing how the lack of self-awareness that each sheep has allows it to live out, in apparent tranquillity, its brief existence, without suffering or boredom. But this idea is ultimately rejected by the sheep-herder himself in the final strophe, in which he admits that, probably, in whatever form life is born and manifests itself, whether moon, sheep or man, whatever it is capable of doing, life is equally bleak and tragic.

In this period, Leopardi&#x27;s relations with his family are reduced to a minimum and he is constrained to maintain himself on his own financially. In 1830, after sixteen months of &quot;notte orribile&quot; (awful night), he accepted a generous offer from his Tuscan friends, which enabled him to leave Recanati.

===The last &quot;Canti&quot; (1832‚Äì1837)===
In the last &quot;canti&quot;, philosophical investigation predominates, with the exception of &quot;Tramonto della Luna&quot; (&quot;Decline of the Moon&quot;) which is a decisive return to idyllic lyricism.

====&quot;Il pensiero dominante&quot;====
In 1831, Leopardi wrote &quot;Il pensiero dominante&quot; (&quot;The Dominating Thought&quot;), which exalts love as a living or vitalizing force in itself, even when it is unrequited. The poem, however, features only the desire for love without the joy and the vitalizing spirit and, therefore, remaining thought, illusion. Leopardi destroys everything, condemns everything, but wishes to save love from the universal miasma and protect it at least within the profundity of his own soul. The more desolate the solitude which surrounds him, the more tightly he grasps onto love as the faith in his idealized, illusory, eternal woman (&quot;sua donna&quot;) who placates suffering, disillusion and bitterness. The poet of universal suffering sings of a good which surpasses the ills of life and, for an instant, seems to become the singer of possible happiness. But the idea of death as the only hope for man returns, since the world offers only two beautiful things: love and death.

&quot;Il pensiero dominante&quot; represents the first ecstatic moment of love, which almost nullifies the awareness of human unhappiness. It is worth the price of tolerating the suffering of a long life in order to experience the joy of such beauty. &quot;Il pensiero dominante&quot; and &quot;Il risorgimento&quot; are the only poems of joy written by Leopardi, though even in those two poems there always reappears, inextinguishable, the pessimism which sees in the object of joy a vain image created by the imagination.

====&quot;Amore e Morte&quot;====
The concept of the love-death duality is taken up again in the 1832 canto &quot;Amore e Morte&quot; (&quot;Love and Death&quot;). It is a meditation on the torment and annihilation which accompanies love. Love and death, in fact, are twins: one is the generator of all things beautiful and the other puts an end to all ills. Love makes strong and cancels the fear of death and when it dominates the soul, it makes it desire death. Some, who are won over by passion, will die for it happily. Others kill themselves because of the wounds of love. But happiness consists in dying in the drunkenness of passion. Of the two twins, Leopardi dares to invoke only death, which is no longer symbolized by the horrid Ade of Saffo, but by a young virgin who grants peace for eternity. Death is the sister of love and is the great consoler who, along with her brother, is the best that the world can offer.

====&quot;Consalvo&quot;====

Also in 1832, inspired by a 17th-century poem by Girolamo Graziani titled &quot;Il Conquisto di Granata&quot; (&quot;The Capture of Granada&quot;), Leopardi wrote &quot;Consalvo&quot;. Consalvo obtains a kiss from the woman he has long loved unrequitedly only when, gravely injured, he is at the point of death. Consalvo is different from the other canti in that it has the form of a novella in verse or of a dramatic scene. It is the fruit of the sentimental and languid literature which characterized much of the romanticism outside of Italy.

====&quot;Aspasia&quot;====
Written in 1834, &quot;Aspasia&quot; emerges, like &quot;Consalvo&quot;, from the painful experience of desperate and unrequited love for Fanny Targioni Tozzetti. Aspasia-Fanny is the only real woman represented in the poetry of Leopardi. Aspasia is an able manipulator whose perfect body hides a corrupt and prosaic soul. She is the demonstration that beauty is dishonest.

The poet, vainly searching for love, takes his revenge on destiny and the women who have rejected him, above all Targioni, whose memory continues to disturb the poet after more than a year away from her. The memory of the woman loved in vain constantly returns, but the canto, inspired by disdain for the provocative and, simultaneously, distancing behaviour of the woman also expresses resignation to one&#x27;s fate and the pride of having been able to recover one&#x27;s own independence. Aspasia, in her limitedness as a woman, cannot grasp the profundity of masculine thought.

====&quot;A se stesso&quot;====
&quot;A se stesso&quot; (To himself) is an 1833 canto in which Leopardi talks to his heart. The last deceit, love, is dead too. He thought that love was one of the few things that makes life worth living but he changed his mind after his beloved Fanny&#x27;s refusal. She, moreover, was in love with Antonio Ranieri, Leopardi&#x27;s best friend, who remained with the poet until the end. His desire, his hope, and his &quot;sweet deceits&quot; are ended. His heart has beaten all his life but it&#x27;s time for it to stop beating and stay still. There is no place for hope anymore. All he wants is dying, because death is the only good gift nature has given to human beings. In &quot;Love and Death&quot;, love was still considered a good thing because when you are in love you have stronger feelings, you feel alive in an always new way. Now he has become sceptical also about love, because if he can&#x27;t have Fanny, nothing remains for him in life. He just wants to die, to make all the suffering end. Death is a gift as it is the end of all human pain, which is inevitable because it&#x27;s in the essence of men, it&#x27;s in the cruel project of nature. The last verse is &quot;e l&#x27;infinita vanit√† del tutto&quot; which means &quot;and the infinite vanity of the whole&quot; and it indicates the inanity of human life and the human world.

====&quot;Sopra un bassorilievo antico sepolcrale&quot;====
In the canto &quot;Sopra un bassorilievo antico sepolcrale&quot; (&quot;Over an Ancient Sepulchre Bas-relief&quot;), a young woman has died and is represented in the act of saying goodbye to her loved ones. The poet weighs the pros and cons of death, remaining in doubt about whether the young woman&#x27;s destiny is good or bad.

Leopardi, even while being highly conscious of the indifference of nature, never ceased entirely to love it. In these verses, the poet poses challenging and pointed questions to nature, enumerating the ills and sufferings which, because of death, are inflicted on humanity. Under the influence of love, the poet had apparently found happiness at least in death (&quot;Il pensiero dominante&quot;, &quot;Amore e morte&quot;). Now, instead, even this last illusion has fallen and he sees nothing but unhappiness everywhere.

====&quot;Sopra il ritratto di una bella donna&quot;====
&quot;Sopra il ritratto di una bella donna scolpito nel monumento sepolcrale della medesima&quot; (&quot;On the portrait of a beautiful woman sculpted in her sepulchral monument&quot;) is basically an extension of the above.

The poet, drawing his inspiration from a funerary sculpture, evokes the image of a beautiful woman and compares her breathtaking beauty to the heart-rendingly sad image that she has become; one that is no more than mud, dust and skeleton. As well as being centred on the transience of beauty and of human things, the poem points to the specular antinomy between human ideals and natural truth. Leopardi does not deny‚Äîif anything, he emphasizes‚Äîthe beauty of the human species in general, and by the end of the poem extends his point to all possible forms of beauty, intellectual as well as aesthetic. However, this universal beauty remains unattainable to a human nature that is nothing but &quot;polvere e ombra&quot; (&quot;dust and shadow&quot;), and that may touch‚Äîbut never possess‚Äîthe ideals that it perceives, remain rooted in the natural world in which it was born, as well as to its demands.

====&quot;La ginestra&quot;====
In 1836, while staying near Torre del Greco in a villa on the hillside of Vesuvius, Leopardi wrote his moral testament as a poet, &quot;La Ginestra&quot; (&quot;The Broom&quot;), also known as &quot;Il Fiore del Deserto&quot; (&quot;The flower of the desert&quot;). The poem consists of 317 verses and uses free strophes of hendecasyllables and septuplets as its meter. It is the longest of all the &quot;Canti&quot; and has an unusual beginning. In fact, among all the Leopardian canti only this one begins with a scene of desolation, to be followed by an alternation between the enchantment of the panorama and of the starry night sky. On the literary level, it is the maximum realization of that anti-idyllic &quot;new poetic&quot; with which Leopardi had already experimented from the 1830s.

Leopardi, after having described the nothingness of the world and of man with respect to the universe; after having lamented the precariousness of the human condition threatened by the capriciousness of nature, not as exceptional evils but as continuous and constant; and after having satirized the arrogance and the credulity of man, who propounds ideas of progress and hopes, even while knowing he is mortal, to render himself eternal, concludes with the observation that reciprocal solidarity is the only defence against the common enemy which is nature (see &quot;Operette morali&quot;, &quot;Dialogo di Plotino e Porfirio&quot;).

In this canto, in which Leopardi expresses his vast thought about mankind, history, and nature, autobiographical elements can be found: both direct (the places described are those which surround the poet in his late years) and indirect, in the image of a man who is poor, weak, but courageous enough to be aware of his real condition. The humble plant of ginestra, living in desolate places without surrendering to the force of Nature, resembles this ideal man, who rejects any illusions about himself and does not invoke from Heaven (or Nature) an impossible help.

Vesuvius, the great mountain which brings destruction, dominates the entire poem. The only attainable truth is death, toward which man must inexorably advance, abandoning every illusion and becoming conscious of his own miserable condition. Such awareness will placate mutual hatred.

It is a vast poem, symphonically constructed with brilliant alternations of tone, from the grandiose and tragic painting of the volcano threatening destruction and of extensions of infertile lava, to the sharp ideological argumentation, to the cosmic sparks which project the nothingness of the earth and of man in the immensity of the universe, to the vision of the infinite passage of centuries of human history on which the immutable threat of nature has always weighed, to the gentle notes dedicated to the &quot;flower in the desert&quot;, in which are compressed complex symbolic meanings: pity toward the sufferings of man and the dignity which should be characteristic of man when confronted with the invincible force of a nature which crushes him.

An essential change occurs with the &quot;Ginestra&quot;, which closes the poetic career of Leopardi along with &quot;Il tramonto della Luna&quot;, which takes up the old themes of the fall of youthful illusions. The poem reiterates and reaffirms the sharp anti-optimistic and anti-religious polemic, but in a new and democratic register. Here, Leopardi no longer denies the possibility of &quot;civic&quot; progress: he seeks to construct an idea of progress founded precisely on his pessimism.

====&quot;Il tramonto della Luna&quot;====
&quot;Il tramonto della Luna&quot; (&quot;The Waning of the Moon&quot;), the last canto, was composed by Leopardi in Naples shortly before his death. The moon wanes, leaving nature in total darkness, just as youth passes away leaving life dark and derelict. The poet seems to presage the imminence of his own death.

In 1845, Ranieri published the definitive edition of the &quot;Canti&quot; according to the will of the author.

===Other poems===
====&quot;Palinodia al marchese Gino Capponi&quot;====
In the &quot;Palinodia al marchese Gino Capponi&quot; (&quot;Palinody to Marquis Gino Capponi&quot;), Leopardi fakes a retraction (&quot;Palinodia&quot;) of his pessimism. The work, written in 1835, was intended to be satirical (he first believes that man is unhappy and miserable, but now progress has made him reconsider his position), but the thought of the inevitable destruction to which nature condemns everything leads him to express bitter conclusions in spite of himself. Regarding this work, Marquis Capponi wrote in a letter to Leopardi that he shared, at least in part, many of his ideas and thanked him for the &quot;noble verses&quot;. However, in a letter addressed to Viesseux, he expressed himself in rather different terms: &quot;Now it behoves that I write [back] to that damned hunchback who has put it into his head to mock me.&quot;

====&quot;Paralipomeni della Batracomiomach√¨a&quot;====
The satiric tone adopted by Leopardi through much of the &quot;Operette morali&quot; is also evinced in some of his late poetic texts, such as the &quot;Palinodia&quot; and &quot;I nuovi credenti&quot;. But the clearest demonstration of his mastery of this art form is probably the &quot;Paralipomeni della Batracomiomachia&quot;, a brief comic-heroic poem of eight stanzas of eight lines each. Leopardi wrote it between 1831 and 1835, beginning it during his last stay in Florence and finishing it in Naples. The publication took place, posthumously, in Paris in 1842, provoking a universal reaction of outrage and condemnation, as much for the cutting and anti-heroic representation of the events of the Risorgimento as for the numerous materialistic philosophical digressions.

The term &quot;Paralip√≤meni&quot; is Greek for &quot;things left undone or unsaid&quot;. &quot;Batracomiomach√¨a&quot; means &quot;war between the frogs and the mice&quot;. Batracomiomachia was also the title of a pseudo-Homeric poem which was actually written in the 4th or 5th century BC and translated by Leopardi between 1815 and 1826. The title, therefore, alludes to an integration of the original work, which is taken up again where it left off and the narrative progresses. The subject is a fable regarding the conflict between the mice that inhabit the nation of Topaia and the invading crabs. But behind the plot, there is hidden a robust sarcastic and polemical motivation. The animals and their doings have an allegorical value. In the crabs, portrayed unsympathetically and with monstrous characteristics, are to be recognized as the Austrians; in the mice, sometimes generous but mostly ingenuous and cowardly, the liberal Italians. The poem represents the historical events that took place between 1815 and 1821: the climate of the Restoration desired by the Holy Alliance and the fruitless attempts at the insurrection of 1820‚Äì21. Even the revolutionary movements of 1831 are included by Leopardi, who was able to follow them by way of the moderate Tuscan circles which he frequented and who perhaps provided him with the inspiration for the work.

The adoption of the poetic genre required the abandonment of the lyric style and the adoption of a narrative pace marked by a constant critical-satirical tension toward the ideological and philosophical beliefs of contemporary culture: Christian spiritualism, faith in progress, and anthropocentrism. Even the slogans of the political struggle of the liberals are derided, both in their expression of expectation of foreign intervention and in their faith in the model of a constitutional monarchy. In this fashion, the &quot;Paralipomeni&quot; represent another part of Leopardi&#x27;s polemical war with the present, and above all an exceptional sally into the territory of historical/political commentary, generally not confronted by Leopardi in a direct form. Of the Italian Risorgimento, he delineates the fundamental limits here with an extraordinary tempestivity: the tendency to compromise with ancient interests and constituted powers, the vanity, the opportunism, the ideological ingenuousness, the lack of an opportune pragmatic awareness. The style generally renounces the expressive concentration of the lyric texts and extends itself in a wide and relaxed discursive pace, with alterations between adventurous moments and ferociously caricatural and polemical points, of description and philosophical digressions.

===&quot;Pensieri&quot; (1837)===
In March 1837, shortly before his death, Leopardi announced that he would gather into one volume some &quot;thoughts&quot; (&quot;pensieri&quot;) on man and society. Such a collection was supposed to be part of a French edition of the complete works of Leopardi. A few months later (on 14 June) the poet died, leaving the work incomplete and the fragments were published by his friend Ranieri, who also provided the title.

The bulk of the contents of &quot;Pensieri&quot; are derived from the &quot;Zibaldone&quot;. The tone is sharply argumentative with respect to humanity, which Leopardi judges to be malevolent and it almost seems as if the poet wants to take his final revenge on the world.

==Philosophical works==
===The &quot;Zibaldone&quot;===
The &quot;Zibaldone di pensieri&quot; (see also Commonplace book#Zibaldone) is a collection of personal impressions, aphorisms, philosophical observations, philological analyses, literary criticism and various types of notes which was published posthumously in seven volumes in 1898 with the original title of &quot;Pensieri di varia filosofia e di bella letteratura&quot; (&quot;Miscellaneous Thoughts on Philosophy and Literature&quot;).

The publication took place thanks to a special governmental commission presided over by Giosu√® Carducci on the occasion of the centennial anniversary of the poet&#x27;s birth. It was only in 1937, after the republication of the original text enriched with notes and indices by the literary critic Francesco Flora, that the work definitively took on the name by which it is known today.

In the &quot;Zibaldone&quot;, Leopardi compares the innocent and happy state of nature with the condition of modern man, corrupted by an excessively developed faculty of reason which, rejecting the necessary illusions of myth and religion in favour of a dark reality of annihilation and emptiness, can only generate unhappiness. The &quot;Zibaldone&quot; contains the poetic and existential itinerary of Leopardi himself; it is a miscellanea of philosophical annotations, schemes, entire compositions, moral reflections, judgements, small idylls, erudite discussions and impressions. Leopardi, even while remaining outside of the circles of philosophical debate of his century, was able to elaborate an extremely innovative and provocative vision of the world. It is not much of a stretch to define Leopardi as the father of what would eventually come to be called nihilism.

Schopenhauer, in mentioning the great minds of all ages who opposed optimism and expressed their knowledge of the world&#x27;s misery, wrote: 
==In popular culture==
*Samuel Beckett refers to Leopardi&#x27;s work several times in his critical study &quot;Proust&quot; and quotes a passage from &quot;A Se Stesso&quot;, &quot;non che la speme il desiderio&quot;, in the English version of his 1951 novel &quot;Molloy&quot;. 
*In &quot;The Part about the Crimes&quot;, the fourth part of Roberto Bola√±o&#x27;s novel &quot;2666&quot;, &quot;Canto notturno di un pastore errante dell&#x27;Asia&quot; is extensively quoted by a television psychic named Florita Almada who somewhat confuses it for an account of the early life of Benito Ju√°rez.
*The title of Carlo Forlivesi&#x27;s album, &quot;Silenziosa Luna&quot;, is a quotation from the same poem.
*The 2014 Italian film &quot;Leopardi&quot; is a biography of his life.

<text>Vasco da Gama ( ; ; ‚Äì 24 December 1524), was a Portuguese explorer and nobleman who was the first European to reach India by sea.

His initial voyage to India by way of the Cape of Good Hope (1497‚Äì1499) was the first to link Europe and Asia by an ocean route, connecting the Atlantic and the Indian oceans. This was a milestone in Portuguese maritime exploration which marked the beginning of a sea-based phase of globalization. Da Gama&#x27;s discovery of the sea route to India opened the way for an age of global imperialism and enabled the Portuguese to establish a long-lasting colonial empire along the way from Africa to Asia. Traveling the ocean route allowed the Portuguese to avoid sailing across the highly disputed Mediterranean Sea and traversing the dangerous Arabian Peninsula. The sum of the distances covered in the outward and return voyages made this expedition the longest ocean voyage ever made until then.

After decades of sailors trying to reach the Indies, with thousands of lives and dozens of vessels lost in shipwrecks and attacks, da Gama landed at Kozhikode on 20 May 1498. Unopposed access to the Indian spice routes boosted the economy of the Portuguese Empire, which was previously based along North and coastal West Africa. The main spices at first obtained from Southeast Asia were pepper and cinnamon, but soon included other products, all new to Europe. Portugal maintained a commercial monopoly of these commodities for several decades. It was not until a century later that other European powers were able to challenge Portugal&#x27;s monopoly and naval supremacy in the Cape Route.

Da Gama led two of the Portuguese India Armadas, the first and the fourth. The latter was the largest and departed for India three years after his return from the first one. For his contributions, in 1524 da Gama was appointed Governor of India, with the title of Viceroy, and was ennobled as Count of Vidigueira in 1519. He remains a leading figure in the history of exploration, and homages worldwide have celebrated his explorations and accomplishments. The Portuguese national epic poem, &quot;Os Lus√≠adas&quot;, was written in his honour by Lu√≠s de Cam√µes.

== Early life ==
Vasco da Gama was born in the town of Sines, one of the few seaports on the Alentejo coast in southwest Portugal. According to the Portuguese historian Teixeira de Arag√£o, he was born in a house near the church of Nossa Senhora das Salas. Some authors write that he was born in or around 1460, while others give 1469 as the year of his birth.

Vasco da Gama&#x27;s paternal grandfather and namesake was born in Oliven√ßa. Vasco&#x27;s father was Est√™v√£o da Gama, who had served in the 1460s as a knight of the household of Ferdinand, Duke of Viseu. He rose in the ranks of the military Order of Santiago. Est√™v√£o da Gama was appointed (civil governor) of Sines in the 1460s, a post he held until 1478; after that he continued as a receiver of taxes and holder of the Order&#x27;s commendas in the region.

Est√™v√£o da Gama married Isabel Sodr√©, a daughter of Jo√£o Sodr√© (also known as Jo√£o de Resende), scion of a well-connected family of English descent. Her father and her brothers, Vicente Sodr√© and Br√°s Sodr√©, had links to the household of Infante Diogo, Duke of Viseu, and were prominent figures in the military Order of Christ. Vasco da Gama was the third of five sons of Est√™v√£o da Gama and Isabel Sodr√© ‚Äì in (probable) order of age: Paulo da Gama, Jo√£o Sodr√©, Vasco da Gama, Pedro da Gama and Aires da Gama. Vasco also had one known sister, Teresa da Gama, who married Lopo Mendes de Vasconcelos.

Little is known of da Gama&#x27;s early life. Teixeira de Arag√£o suggests that he studied at the inland town of √âvora, which is where he may have learned mathematics and navigation. Da Gama&#x27;s near-contemporary Gaspar Correia and others have claimed that he studied under Abraham Zacuto, an astrologer and astronomer, but da Gama&#x27;s biographer Sanjay Subrahmanyam thinks this dubious.

Around 1480, da Gama followed his father (rather than the Sodr√©s) and joined the Order of Santiago. The master of Santiago was Prince John, who ascended to the throne in 1481 as King John II of Portugal. John II doted on the Order, and the da Gamas&#x27; prospects rose accordingly.

In 1492, John II dispatched da Gama on a mission to the port of Set√∫bal and to the Algarve to seize French ships in retaliation for peacetime depredations against Portuguese shipping ‚Äì a task that da Gama rapidly and effectively performed.

== Exploration before da Gama ==

From the earlier part of the 15th century, Portuguese expeditions organized by Prince Henry the Navigator had been reaching down the African coastline, principally in search of West African riches (notably, gold and slaves). They had greatly extended Portuguese maritime knowledge but had little profit to show for the effort. After Henry&#x27;s death in 1460, the Portuguese Crown showed little interest in continuing this effort and, in 1469, licensed the neglected African enterprise to a private Lisbon merchant consortium led by Fern√£o Gomes. Within a few years, Gomes&#x27; captains expanded Portuguese knowledge across the Gulf of Guinea, doing business in gold dust, melegueta pepper, ivory and sub-Saharan slaves. When Gomes&#x27; charter came up for renewal in 1474, Prince John (the future John II), asked his father Afonso V of Portugal to pass the African charter to him.

Upon becoming king in 1481, John II of Portugal set out on many long reforms. To break the monarch&#x27;s dependence on the feudal nobility, John II needed to build up the royal treasury; he considered royal commerce to be the key to achieving that. Under John II&#x27;s watch, the gold and slave trade in West Africa was greatly expanded. He was eager to break into the highly profitable spice trade between Europe and Asia, which was conducted chiefly by land. At the time, this was virtually monopolized by the Republic of Venice, which operated overland routes via Levantine and Egyptian ports, through the Red Sea across to the spice markets of India. John II set a new objective for his captains: to find a sea route to Asia by sailing around the African continent.

By the time Vasco da Gama was in his 20s, the king&#x27;s plans were coming to fruition. In 1487, John II dispatched two spies, Pero da Covilh√£ and Afonso de Paiva, overland via Egypt to East Africa and India, to scout the details of the spice markets and trade routes. The breakthrough came soon after, when John II&#x27;s captain Bartolomeu Dias returned from rounding the Cape of Good Hope in 1488, having explored as far as the Fish River () in modern-day South Africa and having verified that the unknown coast stretched away to the northeast.

An explorer was needed who could prove the link between the findings of Dias and those of da Covilh√£ and de Paiva and connect these separate segments into a potentially lucrative trade route across the Indian Ocean.

== First voyage ==

On 8 July 1497 Vasco da Gama led a fleet of four ships with a crew of 170 men from Lisbon. The distance traveled in the journey around Africa to India and back was greater than the length of the equator. The navigators included Portugal&#x27;s most experienced, Pero de Alenquer, Pedro Escobar, , and Afonso Gon√ßalves. It is not known for certain how many people were in each ship&#x27;s crew but approximately 55 returned, and two ships were lost. Two of the vessels were carracks, newly built for the voyage; the others were a caravel and a supply boat.

The four ships were:
* &quot;S√£o Gabriel&quot;, commanded by Vasco da Gama; a carrack of 178 tons, length 27 m, width 8.5 m, draft 2.3 m, sails of 372 m2
* &quot;S√£o Rafael&quot;, commanded by his brother Paulo da Gama; similar dimensions to the &quot;S√£o Gabriel&quot;
* &quot;Berrio&quot; (nickname, officially called &quot;S√£o Miguel&quot;), a caravel, slightly smaller than the former two, commanded by Nicolau Coelho
* A storage ship of unknown name, commanded by Gon√ßalo Nunes, destined to be scuttled in Mossel Bay (S√£o Br√°s) in South Africa

=== Journey to the Cape ===

The expedition set sail from Lisbon on 8 July 1497. It followed the route pioneered by earlier explorers along the coast of Africa via Tenerife and the Cape Verde Islands. After reaching the coast of present-day Sierra Leone, da Gama took a course south into the open ocean, crossing the equator and seeking the South Atlantic westerlies that Bartolomeu Dias had discovered in 1487. This course proved successful and on 4 November 1497, the expedition made landfall on the African coast. For over three months the ships had sailed more than of open ocean, by far the longest journey without landfall made by that time.

By 16 December, the fleet had passed the Great Fish River (Eastern Cape, South Africa) ‚Äì where Dias had anchored ‚Äì and sailed into waters previously unknown to Europeans. With Christmas pending, da Gama and his crew gave the coast they were passing the name Natal, which carried the connotation of &quot;birth of Christ&quot; in Portuguese.

=== Mozambique ===
Vasco da Gama spent 2 to 29 March 1498 in the vicinity of Mozambique Island. Arab-controlled territory on the East African coast was an integral part of the network of trade in the Indian Ocean. Fearing the local population would be hostile to Christians, da Gama impersonated a Muslim and gained audience with the Sultan of Mozambique. With the paltry trade goods he had to offer, the explorer was unable to provide a suitable gift to the ruler. Soon the local populace became suspicious of da Gama and his men. Forced by a hostile crowd to flee Mozambique, da Gama departed the harbor, firing his cannons into the city in retaliation.

=== Mombasa ===
In the vicinity of modern Kenya, the expedition resorted to piracy, looting Arab merchant ships that were generally unarmed trading vessels without heavy cannons. The Portuguese became the first known Europeans to visit the port of Mombasa from 7 to 13 April 1498, but were met with hostility and soon departed.

=== Malindi ===
Vasco da Gama continued north, arriving on 14 April 1498 at the friendlier port of Malindi, whose leaders were in conflict with those of Mombasa. There, da Gama and his crew contracted the services of a pilot who used his knowledge of the monsoon winds to guide the expedition the rest of the way to Kozhikode, located on the southwest coast of India. Sources differ over the identity of the pilot, calling him variously a Christian, a Muslim, or a Gujarati Hindu. One traditional story describes the pilot as the famous Arab navigator Ibn Majid, but other contemporaneous accounts place Majid elsewhere, and he could not have been near the vicinity at the time. None of the Portuguese historians of the time mentions Ibn Majid. Vasco da Gama left Malindi for India on 24 April 1498.

=== Kozhikode, India ===


The fleet arrived in Kappadu near Kozhikode (known as Kozhikode at the time, subsequently known as Calicut and now renamed Kozhikode) on the Malabar Coast (present-day Kerala state of India) on 20 May 1498. The Zamorin (Samoothiri) of Kozhikode, who was at that time staying in his second capital at Ponnani, returned to the city on hearing the news of the foreign fleet&#x27;s arrival. The navigator was received with traditional hospitality, including a grand procession of at least 3,000 armed Nairs, but an interview with the Zamorin failed to produce any concrete results. When local authorities asked da Gama&#x27;s fleet, &quot;What brought you hither?&quot;, they replied that they had come &quot;in search of Christians and spices.&quot; The presents that da Gama sent to the Zamorin as gifts from Dom Manuel¬†‚Äì four cloaks of scarlet cloth, six hats, four branches of corals, twelve , a box with seven brass vessels, a chest of sugar, two barrels of oil and a cask of honey¬†‚Äì were trivial, and failed to impress. While the Zamorin&#x27;s officials wondered at why there was no gold or silver, the Muslim merchants who considered da Gama their rival suggested that the latter was only an ordinary pirate and not a royal ambassador. Vasco da Gama&#x27;s request for permission to leave a factor behind him in charge of the merchandise he could not sell was turned down by the King, who insisted that da Gama pay customs duty¬†‚Äì preferably in gold¬†‚Äì like any other trader, which strained the relation between the two. Annoyed by this, da Gama carried a few Nairs and sixteen fishermen (&quot;mukkuva&quot;) off with him by force.

=== Return ===
Vasco da Gama left Kozhikode on 29 August 1498. Eager to set sail for home, he ignored the local knowledge of monsoon wind patterns that were still blowing onshore. The fleet initially inched north along the Indian coast, and then anchored in at Anjediva island for a spell. They finally struck out for their Indian Ocean crossing on 3 October 1498. But with the winter monsoon yet to set in, it was a harrowing journey. On the outgoing journey, sailing with the summer monsoon wind, da Gama&#x27;s fleet crossed the Indian Ocean in only 23 days; now, on the return trip, sailing against the wind, it took more than 90 days.

Da Gama saw land again only on 2 January 1499, passing before the coastal Somali city of Mogadishu, then under the influence of the Ajuran Empire in the Horn of Africa. The fleet did not make a stop, but passing before Mogadishu, the anonymous diarist of the expedition noted that it was a large city with houses of four or five storeys high and big palaces in its center and many mosques with cylindrical minarets.

Da Gama&#x27;s fleet finally arrived in Malindi on 7 January 1499, in a terrible state ‚Äì approximately half of the crew had died during the crossing, and many of the rest were afflicted with scurvy. Not having enough crewmen left standing to manage three ships, da Gama ordered the &quot;S√£o Rafael&quot; scuttled off the East African coast, and the crew re-distributed to the remaining two ships, the &quot;S√£o Gabriel&quot; and the &quot;Berrio&quot;. While there he was also granted permission by the Sultan to set up a (a stone pillar). The Vasco da Gama Pillar, as it is still known locally, seems to be the only one of the many set up by da Gama to survive to the present day.

After leaving Malindi, the sailing was smoother. By early March, the fleet had arrived in Mossel Bay, and crossed the Cape of Good Hope in the opposite direction on 20 March, reaching the western coast of Africa by 25 April.

The diary record of the expedition ends abruptly here. Reconstructing from other sources, it seems they continued to Cape Verde, where Nicolau Coelho&#x27;s &quot;Berrio&quot; separated from Vasco da Gama&#x27;s &quot;S√£o Gabriel&quot; and sailed on by itself. The &quot;Berrio&quot; arrived in Lisbon on 10 July 1499 and Nicolau Coelho personally delivered the news to King Manuel I and the royal court, then assembled in Sintra. In the meantime, back in Cape Verde, da Gama&#x27;s brother, Paulo da Gama, had fallen grievously ill. Da Gama elected to stay by his side on Santiago island and handed the &quot;S√£o Gabriel&quot; over to his clerk, Jo√£o de S√°, to take home. The &quot;S√£o Gabriel&quot; under S√° arrived in Lisbon sometime in late July or early August. Da Gama and his sickly brother eventually hitched a ride with a Guinea caravel returning to Portugal, but Paulo da Gama died en route. Da Gama disembarked at the Azores to bury his brother at the monastery of S√£o Francisco in Angra do Heroismo, and lingered there for a little while in mourning. He eventually took passage on an Azorean caravel and finally arrived in Lisbon on 29 August 1499 (according to Barros), or early September (8th or 18th, according to other sources). Despite his melancholic mood, da Gama was given a hero&#x27;s welcome and showered with honors, including a triumphal procession and public festivities. King Manuel wrote two letters in which he described da Gama&#x27;s first voyage, in July and August 1499, soon after the return of the ships. Girolamo Sernigi also wrote three letters describing da Gama&#x27;s first voyage soon after the return of the expedition.

The expedition had exacted a large cost ‚Äì two ships and over half the men had been lost. It had also failed in its principal mission of securing a commercial treaty with Kozhikode. Nonetheless, the small quantities of spices and other trade goods brought back on the remaining two ships demonstrated the potential of great profit for future trade. Vasco da Gama was justly celebrated for opening a direct sea route to Asia. His path would be followed up thereafter by yearly Portuguese India Armadas.

The spice trade would prove to be a major asset to the Portuguese royal treasury, and other consequences soon followed. For example, da Gama&#x27;s voyage had made it clear that the east coast of Africa, the &quot;Contra Costa&quot;, was essential to Portuguese interests; its ports provided fresh water, provisions, timber, and harbors for repairs, and served as a refuge where ships could wait out unfavorable weather. One significant result was the colonization of Mozambique by the Portuguese Crown.

== Rewards ==
In December 1499, King Manuel I of Portugal rewarded Vasco da Gama with the town of Sines as a hereditary fief (the town his father, Est√™v√£o, had once held as a ). This turned out to be a complicated affair, for Sines still belonged to the Order of Santiago. The master of the Order, Jorge de Lencastre, might have endorsed the reward ‚Äì after all, da Gama was a Santiago knight, one of their own, and a close associate of Lencastre himself. But the fact that Sines was awarded by the king provoked Lencastre to refuse out of principle, lest it encourage the king to make other donations of the Order&#x27;s properties. Da Gama would spend the next few years attempting to take hold of Sines, an effort that would estrange him from Lencastre and eventually prompt da Gama to abandon his beloved Order of Santiago, switching over to the rival Order of Christ in 1507.

In the meantime, da Gama made do with a substantial hereditary royal pension of 300,000 . He was awarded the noble title of (lord) in perpetuity for himself, his siblings and their descendants. On 30 January 1502, da Gama was awarded the title of (&quot;Admiral of the Seas of Arabia, Persia, India and all the Orient&quot;) ‚Äì an overwrought title reminiscent of the ornate Castilian title borne by Christopher Columbus. Another royal letter, dated October 1501, gave da Gama the personal right to intervene and exercise a determining role on &quot;any&quot; future India-bound fleet.

Around 1501, Vasco da Gama married Catarina de Ata√≠de, daughter of √Ålvaro de Ata√≠de, the &quot;&quot; of Alvor (Algarve), and a prominent nobleman connected by kinship with the powerful Almeida family (Catarina was a first cousin of Dom Francisco de Almeida).

== Second voyage ==


The follow-up expedition, the Second India Armada, launched in 1500 under the command of Pedro √Ålvares Cabral with the mission of making a treaty with the Zamorin of Kozhikodeand setting up a Portuguese factory in the city. However, Pedro Cabral entered into a conflict with the local Arab merchant guilds, with the result that the Portuguese factory was overrun in a riot and up to 70 Portuguese were killed. Cabral blamed the Zamorin for the incident and bombarded the city. Thus war broke out between Portugal and Kozhikode.

Vasco da Gama invoked his royal letter to take command of the Fourth India Armada, scheduled to set out in 1502, with the explicit aim of taking revenge upon the Zamorin and force him to submit to Portuguese terms. The heavily armed fleet of fifteen ships and eight hundred men left Lisbon on 12 February 1502. It was followed in April by another squadron of five ships led by his cousin, Est√™v√£o da Gama (the son of Aires da Gama), which caught up to them in the Indian Ocean. The Fourth Armada was a veritable da Gama family affair. Two of his maternal uncles, Vicente Sodr√© and Br√°s Sodr√©, were pre-designated to command an Indian Ocean naval patrol, while brothers-in-law √Ålvaro de Ata√≠de (brother of Vasco&#x27;s wife Catarina) and Lopo Mendes de Vasconcelos (betrothed to Teresa da Gama, Vasco&#x27;s sister) captained ships in the main fleet.

On the outgoing voyage, da Gama&#x27;s fleet opened contact with the East African gold trading port of Sofala and reduced the sultanate of Kilwa to tribute, extracting a substantial sum of gold.

=== Pilgrim ship incident ===

On reaching India in October 1502, da Gama&#x27;s fleet intercepted &quot;Mirim&quot;, a ship of Muslim pilgrims at Madayi travelling from Kozhikode to Mecca. Described in detail by eyewitness Thom√© Lopes and chronicler Gaspar Correia, da Gama looted the ship with over 400 pilgrims on board including 50 women, locked in the passengers, the owner and an ambassador from Egypt and burned them to death. They offered their wealth, which &quot;could ransom all the Christian slaves in the Kingdom of Fez and much more&quot; but were not spared. Da Gama looked on through the porthole and saw the women bringing up their gold and jewels and holding up their babies to beg for mercy. The lives of twenty children were spared against a forced conversion to Christianity.

=== Kozhikode ===


After stopping at Cannanore, Gama drove his fleet before Kozhikode, demanding redress for the treatment of Cabral. Having known of the fate of the pilgrims&#x27; ship, the Zamorin adopted a conciliatory attitude towards the Portuguese and expressed willingness to sign a new treaty, but da Gama made a call to the Hindu king to expel all Muslims from Kozhikode before beginning negotiations, which was turned down. At the same time however, the Zamorin sent a message to his rebellious vassal, the Raja of Cochin, urging cooperation and obedience to counter the Portuguese threat; the ruler of Cochin forwarded this message to Gama, which reinforced his opinion of the Indians as duplicitous. After da Gama&#x27;s demand for the expulsion of Muslims from Kozhikode, the Zamorin sent the high priest Talappana Namboothiri (the very same person who conducted da Gama to the Zamorin&#x27;s chamber during his much celebrated first visit to Kozhikodein May 1498) for talks. Da Gama called him a spy, ordered the priest&#x27;s lips and ears to be cut off and after sewing a pair of dog&#x27;s ears to his head, sent him away. The Portuguese fleet then bombarded the unfortified city for nearly two days from the sea, severely damaging it. He also captured several rice vessels and cut off the crew&#x27;s hands, ears and noses, dispatching them with a note to the Zamorin, in which Gama declared that he would be open to friendly relations once the Zamorin had paid for the items plundered from the feitoria as well as the gunpowder and cannonballs.

===Seabattle===

The violent treatment meted out by da Gama quickly brought trade along the Malabar Coast of India, upon which Calicut (Kozhikode) depended, to a standstill. The Zamorin ventured to dispatch a fleet of strong warships to challenge da Gama&#x27;s armada, but which Gama managed to defeat in a naval battle before Kozhikode harbor.

===Cochin===

Da Gama loaded up with spices at Cochin and Cannanore, small nearby kingdoms at war with the Zamorin, whose alliances had been secured by prior Portuguese fleets. The 4th armada left India in early 1503. Da Gama left behind a small squadron of caravels under the command of his uncle, Vicente Sodr√©, to patrol the Indian coast, to continue harassing Kozhikode shipping, and to protect the Portuguese factories at Cochin and Cannanore from the Zamorin&#x27;s inevitable reprisals.

Vasco da Gama arrived back in Portugal in September 1503, effectively having failed in his mission to bring the Zamorin to submission. This failure, and the subsequent more galling failure of his uncle Vicente Sodr√© to protect the Portuguese factory in Cochin, probably counted against any further rewards. When the Portuguese king Manuel I decided to appoint the first governor and viceroy of Portuguese India in 1505, da Gama was conspicuously overlooked, and the post given to Francisco de Almeida.

== Interlude ==
For the next two decades, Vasco da Gama lived out a quiet life, unwelcome in the royal court and sidelined from Indian affairs. His attempts to return to the favor of Manuel I, including switching over to the Order of Christ in 1507, yielded little. Almeida, the larger-than-life Afonso de Albuquerque and, later on, Albergaria and Sequeira, were the king&#x27;s preferred point men for India.

After Ferdinand Magellan defected to the Crown of Castile in 1518, Vasco da Gama threatened to do the same, prompting the king to undertake steps to retain him in Portugal and avoid the embarrassment of losing his own &quot;Admiral of the Indies&quot; to Spain. In 1519, after years of ignoring his petitions, King Manuel I finally hurried to give Vasco da Gama a feudal title, appointing him the first Count of Vidigueira, a title created by a royal decree issued in √âvora on 29 December, after a complicated agreement with Dom Jaime, Duke of Braganza, who ceded him on payment the towns of Vidigueira and Vila dos Frades. The decree granted Vasco da Gama and his heirs all the revenues and privileges related, thus promoting da Gama from a petty noble to one of the relatively few titled nobles in Portugal.

== Third voyage and death ==
After the death of King Manuel I in late 1521, his son and successor, King John III of Portugal set about reviewing the Portuguese government overseas. Turning away from the old Albuquerque clique (now represented by Diogo Lopes de Sequeira), John III looked for a fresh start. Vasco da Gama re-emerged from his political wilderness as an important adviser to the new king&#x27;s appointments and strategy. Seeing the new Spanish threat to the Maluku Islands as the priority, Vasco da Gama advised against the obsession with Arabia that had pervaded much of the Manueline period, and continued to be the dominant concern of Duarte de Menezes, then-governor of Portuguese India. Menezes also turned out to be incompetent and corrupt, subject to numerous complaints. As a result, John III decided to appoint Vasco da Gama himself to replace Menezes, confident that the magic of his name and memory of his deeds might better impress his authority on Portuguese India, and manage the transition to a new government and new strategy.

By his appointment letter of February 1524, John III granted Vasco da Gama the privileged title of &quot;Viceroy&quot;, being only the second Portuguese governor to enjoy that title (the first was Francisco de Almeida in 1505). His second son, Est√™v√£o da Gama was simultaneously appointed (&#x27;Captain-major of the Indian Sea&#x27;, commander of the Indian Ocean naval patrol fleet), to replace Duarte&#x27;s brother, Lu√≠s de Menezes. As a final condition, Gama secured from John III of Portugal the commitment to appoint all his sons successively as Portuguese captains of Malacca.

Setting out in April 1524, with a fleet of fourteen ships, Vasco da Gama took as his flagship the famous large carrack &quot;Santa Catarina do Monte Sinai&quot; on her last journey to India, along with two of his sons, Est√™v√£o and Paulo. 

===The underwater quake===
After a troubled journey in which four or five of the ships were lost en route, he arrived in India in September. 

Early on the morning of September 8, as the ships laid becalmed near Dabul the sea began to boil and the vessels pitched and rocked violently for about an hour as the result of a submarine earthquake. The Portuguese crews were frightened, and one death occurred as a sailor jumped overboard in panic and drowned. Gama capitalized on the situation and so as to reassure his men cried out:

===Death===

Vasco da Gama immediately invoked his high viceregal powers to impose a new order in Portuguese India, replacing all the old officials with his own appointments. But da Gama contracted malaria not long after arriving and died in the city of Cochin on Christmas Eve in 1524, three months after his arrival. As per royal instructions, da Gama was succeeded as governor of India by one of the captains who had come with him, Henrique de Menezes (no relation to Duarte). Da Gama&#x27;s sons Est√™v√£o and Paulo immediately lost their posts and joined the returning fleet of early 1525 (along with the dismissed Duarte de Menezes and Lu√≠s de Menezes).

Vasco da Gama&#x27;s body was first buried at St. Francis Church, at Fort Kochi in the city of Kochi, but his remains were returned to Portugal in 1539. The body of Vasco da Gama was re-interred in Vidigueira in a casket decorated with gold and jewels.
The Monastery of the Hieronymites, in Bel√©m, which later became the necropolis of the Portuguese royal dynasty of Aviz, was erected in the early 1500s near the launch point of Vasco da Gama&#x27;s first journey; its construction funded by a tax on the profits of the yearly Portuguese India Armadas. In 1880, what were believed to be da Gama&#x27;s remains and those of the poet Lu√≠s de Cam√µes (who celebrated da Gama&#x27;s first voyage in his 1572 epic poem, &quot;Os Lus√≠adas&quot;), were moved to new carved tombs in the nave of the monastery&#x27;s church, only a few meters away from the tombs of the kings Manuel I and John III, whom da Gama had served.

However, by 1884, Teixeira de Arag√£o, one of the advocates for the transfer of da Gama&#x27;s remains to the monastery, discovered documents suggesting that the wrong remains had been exhumed from Vidigueira. Apparently, da Gama&#x27;s gravestone had been exchanged with that of his great-grandson Francisco da Gama, whose tomb lay opposite his, likely during restoration works in 1841. Additionally, it was found that the casket moved in 1880 contained the bones of more than one person, whereas the other tomb contained only one skeleton. It was not until May 1898, during the celebrations of the fourth centenary of da Gama&#x27;s arrival in Kozhikode, that the remains from the other tomb in the chapel of Vidigueira were moved to the Hieronymite monastery. In 1994, a member of the family that now owns the estate where da Gama&#x27;s remains were until the 1880s claimed that the real bones of Vasco da Gama were located in an unmarked spot on the estate, purportedly having been hidden there by the estate&#x27;s owner in the 19th century, the Visconde de Ribeira Brava.

== Marriage and descendants ==
Vasco da Gama and his wife, Catarina de Ata√≠de, had six sons and one daughter:

# Dom Francisco da Gama, who inherited his father&#x27;s titles as 2nd Count of Vidigueira and the 2nd &quot;Admiral of the Seas of India, Arabia and Persia.&quot; He remained in Portugal.
# Dom Estev√£o da Gama, after his abortive 1524 term as Indian patrol captain, he was appointed for a three-year term as captain of Malacca, serving from 1534 to 1539 (includes the last two years of his younger brother Paulo&#x27;s term). He was subsequently appointed as the 11th governor of India from 1540 to 1542.
# Dom Paulo da Gama (having the same name as his uncle Paulo), captain of Malacca from 1533 to 1534, killed in a naval action off Malacca.
# Dom Cristov√£o da Gama, captain of Malacca from 1538 to 1540; nominated to succeed in Malacca, but executed by Ahmad ibn Ibrahim during the Ethiopian-Adal war in 1542.
# Dom Pedro da Silva da Gama, appointed captain of Malacca from 1548 to 1552.
# Dom √Ålvaro de Ata√≠de da Gama, appointed captain of Malacca fleet in the 1540s, captain of Malacca itself from 1552 to 1554.
# Dona Isabel de Ata√≠de da Gama, only daughter, married Dom Ignacio de Noronha, son of the first Count of Linhares.
His male-line issue became extinct in 1735, when the 7th Count of Vidigueira, Dom Vasco Baltasar Jos√© Lu√≠s Gama died, leaving only one daughter from his marriage, Dona Maria Jos√© da Gama, who inherited the Vidigueira estate. The title thus continued through this female-line.

=== Later generations ===
* Dom Vasco da Gama, 3rd Count of Vidigueira, the nobility and military personnel, son of Francisco (2nd Count) and grandson of Vasco da Gama.
* Dom Francisco da Gama, 4th Count of Vidigueira, the viceroy (1597‚Äì1600) and governor (1622‚Äì1628) of India, son of Vasco (3rd Count) and great-grandson of Vasco da Gama.

== Legacy ==

Vasco da Gama is one of the most famous and celebrated explorers from the Age of Discovery. As much as anyone after Henry the Navigator, he was responsible for Portugal&#x27;s success as an early colonizing power. Beside the fact of the first voyage itself, it was his astute mix of politics and war on the other side of the world that placed Portugal in a prominent position in Indian Ocean trade. Following da Gama&#x27;s initial voyage, the Portuguese crown realized that securing outposts on the eastern coast of Africa would prove vital to maintaining national trade routes to the Far East.

However, his fame is tempered by such incidents and attitudes as displayed in the notorious Pilgrim Ship Incident previously discussed.

The Portuguese national epic, the &quot;Lus√≠adas&quot; of Lu√≠s Vaz de Cam√µes, largely concerns Vasco da Gama&#x27;s voyages.

The 1865 grand opera &quot;L&#x27;Africaine&quot;, composed by Giacomo Meyerbeer from a libretto by Eug√®ne Scribe, prominently includes the character of Vasco da Gama. The events depicted, however, are fictitious. Meyerbeer&#x27;s working title for the opera was &quot;Vasco da Gama&quot;. A 1989 production of the opera by the San Francisco Opera featured noted tenor Pl√°cido Domingo in the role of da Gama. The 19th-century composer Louis-Albert Bourgault-Ducoudray composed an eponymous 1872 opera based on da Gama&#x27;s life and exploits at sea.

The port city of Vasco da Gama in Goa is named after him, as is the crater Vasco da Gama on the Moon. There are three football clubs in Brazil (including Club de Regatas Vasco da Gama) and Vasco Sports Club in Goa that were also named after him. There exists a church in Kochi, Kerala called Vasco da Gama Church, and a private residence on the island of Saint Helena. The suburb of Vasco in Cape Town also honours him. A garden in Macau is also named after him.

A few places in Lisbon&#x27;s Parque das Na√ß√µes are named after the explorer, such as the Vasco da Gama Bridge, Vasco da Gama Tower and the &quot;Centro Comercial Vasco da Gama&quot; shopping centre. The Ocean√°rio in the Parque das Na√ß√µes has a mascot of a cartoon diver with the name of &quot;Vasco&quot;, who is named after the explorer.

Vasco da Gama was the only explorer on the final pool of Os Grandes Portugueses. Although the final shortlist featured other Age of Discovery-related people, they were not actually explorers nor navigators for any matter.

The Portuguese Navy has a class of frigates named after him. There are three &quot;Vasco da Gama&quot; class frigates in total, of which the first one also bears his name.

The Portuguese government erected two navigational beacons, Dias Cross and da Gama Cross, to commemorate da Gama and Bartolomeu Dias, who were the first modern European explorers to reach the Cape of Good Hope. When lined up, these crosses point to Whittle Rock, a large, permanently submerged shipping hazard in False Bay.

South African musician Hugh Masekela recorded an anti-colonialist song entitled &quot;Colonial Man&quot;, which contains the lyrics &quot;Vasco da Gama was no friend of mine&quot;, and another song entitled &quot;Vasco da Gama (The Sailor Man)&quot;. Both songs were included in his 1976 album &quot;Colonial Man&quot;.

Vasco da Gama appears as an antagonist in the Indian film &quot;Urumi&quot;. The film, directed by Santosh Sivan, depicts atrocities and progression to establish the Portuguese empire by da Gama in India.

In March 2016, archaeologists working off the coast of Oman identified a shipwreck believed to be that of the &quot;Esmeralda&quot; from da Gama&#x27;s 1502‚Äì1503 fleet. The wreck was initially discovered in 1998. Later underwater excavations took place between 2013 and 2015 through a partnership between the Oman Ministry of Heritage and Culture and Blue Water Recoveries Ltd., a shipwreck recovery company. The vessel was identified through such artifacts as a &quot;Portuguese coin minted for trade with India (one of only two coins of this type known to exist) and stone cannonballs engraved with what appear to be the initials of Vincente Sodr√©, da Gama&#x27;s maternal uncle and the commander of the &quot;Esmeralda&quot;.&quot;

<text>The Puppet Masters is a 1951 science fiction novel by American writer Robert A. Heinlein, in which American secret agents battle parasitic invaders from outer space. It was originally serialized in &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; (September, October, and November 1951).

The novel evokes a sense of paranoia and Heinlein repeatedly makes explicit the analogy between the mind-controlling parasites and the Communist Russians, echoing the prevailing Second Red Scare in the United States. The book takes up the then common theme of sightings of flying saucers, the plot assuming that the &quot;saucers&quot; seen in the 1950s were part of a preliminary reconnaissance of Earth, carried out by the extraterrestrials in preparation for a full-fledged invasion sixty years later.

==Background==
The novel starts in 2007. Following a nuclear war between the Soviet Union and the Western Bloc, which left both sides battered but unbroken, both sides return to a state of Cold War. Washington, D.C., and other US cities devastated in nuclear strikes had been completely rebuilt. The Soviet Union and China remain a single bloc dominated by Moscow, and the sharp Sino-Soviet split of the late 1950s never happened.

Social customs have changed somewhat, in a way typical for Heinlein&#x27;s fiction (i.e. having become more liberal, such as marriage contracts being possible with fixed terms, etc.) and ray guns and personal flying cars are commonplace. &quot;Slug throwing guns&quot; remain in possession of some private citizens, but are considered obsolete by professionals. Space stations exist and colonies have been established on the planet Venus (depicted, as common in science fiction of the time, as a tropical planet habitable by humans). There exists a wakefulness-promoting drug known as &quot;tempus fugit&quot; that most agents carry a tube of. Although they are considered not habit forming they do produce a mild euphoria, but mostly used as they can stretch out the users subjective perception of time, &#x27;by a factor of ten or more&#x27;. 

Space technology is far more advanced than in the actual first decade of the 21st century. For example, in the last scene, a space warship is sent on a twelve-year trip to Titan, with not only life-support for a large crew, but also enough armaments to confront an entire world on its own.

However, communications satellites have not been thought of, and television broadcasts are still limited to line-of-sight, as they were at the time of writing. This is of critical importance to the plot. The territory of the United States is divided into numerous transmission blocks, which receive television broadcasts from their neighbors and relay them onwards. When the invaders seize one of these blocks, they effectively control all communications within it and can isolate its inhabitants from the outside world, deny the central government any access to them, and consolidate control at their leisure.

The current president‚Äîon his second term‚Äîhad established directly upon being first elected a new intelligence agency, known as the Section. Its creation was never authorized by Congress and its existence is kept secret, being funded by sums diverted from innocuous sounding items in the budget. It has a disguised underground headquarters in Washington, D.C., and a network of similarly disguised branch offices around the US. Unlike the clearly demarked spheres of the FBI and CIA, the Section carries out extensive espionage in Soviet territory, but also conducts operations inside the United States. If ordered to, its agents are ready to shoot and kill American citizens on US soil. The Section&#x27;s Director, who had been the president&#x27;s campaign manager, is universally called &quot;The Old Man&quot;. Only gradually does the reader learn that he is the protagonist&#x27;s actual father.

==Plot==
In the summer of 2007, Earth is under attack. Slug-like creatures, arriving in flying saucers, are attaching themselves to people&#x27;s backs, taking control of their victims&#x27; nervous systems, and manipulating those people as puppets. The Old Man, the head of a clandestine national security agency called the Section, goes to Des Moines, Iowa, with Sam and Mary, two of his best agents, to investigate a flying saucer report, but much more seriously the ominous disappearance of the six agents sent previously. They discover that &quot;the slugs&quot; are steadily taking over Des Moines, but they cannot convince the US president to declare an emergency.

Sam takes two other agents and returns to Des Moines to get more evidence of the invasion. They fail and are forced to flee quickly, but in the confusion, a slug gains control of one of the agents. Back in Washington the team discovers the slug and captures it, but later it escapes and attaches itself to Sam, using Sam&#x27;s skills and knowledge to make a clean escape.

While under control, Sam uses the Constitution Club‚Äîwhose membership includes many important members of the city&#x27;s political elite‚Äîto gain more hosts for the slugs. The Old Man captures him, takes him to Section&#x27;s new headquarters, and later coerces Sam into allowing himself to be possessed by the slug again. Under drug-induced hypnosis, Sam reveals that the slugs come from Titan, the sixth moon of Saturn. Later the Section exposes several possessed congressmen at a session of Congress, finally persuading the Congress that the United States is under attack. The law is passed requiring people to have bare backs to demonstrate that they are not carrying slugs.

The Army prepares a counterattack in the most heavily infested areas, planning to take over most broadcast centers and reveal the truth to the local residents. Sam drives alone to Kansas City and discovers that the slugs now possess almost all residents. He returns to Washington too late to stop the operation, which fails; the invading soldiers are either killed or captured by the slugs.

Sam and Mary take a short leave, get married and have a happy honeymoon that is interrupted by a slug that seems to have been targeting Sam for repossession. They return to work and discover that people are now required to be practically naked as the slugs learned to attach themselves to other body parts. Together with the Old Man, they go to Pass Christian, Mississippi, to inspect a flying saucer that had made a bad landing. Inside the alien ship, Mary is overwhelmed by repressed memories from the time she was a child on Venus and had been possessed by a slug. The slug had died from &quot;nine-day fever&quot;, a deadly disease native to Venus.

Learning that the disease kills slugs faster than their human hosts, the authorities adopt biological warfare and release infected apes into enemy-held territory. Slugs possess the apes and then quickly transmit the disease to each other. Several carefully timed days later, thousands of volunteers are parachuted to administer the cure to those people whose slugs have died. Sam and the Old Man join the effort in Jefferson City, Missouri.

The Old Man gets possessed by the last healthy slug in the city, captures Sam and escapes in an air-car heading to the Yucat√°n, where the slug intends to restart its effort to conquer humanity. Sam manages to kill the slug and crash the air-car.

Some years later, Sam and Mary board a spaceship headed for Saturn to take the offensive. Sam expresses the hope that a way would be found to save the small elf-like hosts whom the slugs enslaved.

==Characters==
* Sam, born Elihu Nivens, is the classic Heinlein hero, multi-talented, independent, fiercely loyal to friends and an implacable enemy to foes. He is thirtyish, but has changed appearance so many times even he has doubts as to how he originally looked.
* Mary, born Allucquere in a religious commune in Antarctica before growing up on Venus, is Heinlein&#x27;s classic heroine. She is beautiful, red-headed, hard-nosed and brilliant. Sam describes her as having the &quot;real redheaded saurian bony structure to her skull&quot;. Her professional exterior conceals psychological scars from her encounter with the slugs as a child. Only the Old Man knows the truth about her, thanks to the deep hypnotic analysis that all agents have to undergo.
* The Old Man, born Andrew Nivens, is the head of a top secret government agency that he wishes did not have to exist, doing his job reluctantly because nobody else would do it properly. He represents the third of Heinlein&#x27;s favorite types of character, the &quot;wise, grumpy old man&quot;. He is the first in the line that includes Jubal Harshaw, Professor Bernardo de la Paz, Johann Sebastian Bach Smith, &quot;Kettle Belly&quot; Baldwin, and the later life of Lazarus Long.

==Alternative version==
Heinlein&#x27;s original version of the novel was 96,000 words, and was cut to 72,000 words for both the 1951 book version and the serialization in &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot;. For the &quot;Galaxy&quot; version, editor H. L. Gold also did extensive rewriting, to which Heinlein strenuously objected.

In 1990, two years after Heinlein&#x27;s death, an expanded version was published with the consent of his widow, Virginia Heinlein. This edition contained material that had been cut from the original published version, because the book was deemed to be too long and controversial for the market in 1951. The uncut version seemed more risqu√© in 1951 than it did decades later. For example, in the uncut version the book begins with Sam waking up in bed with a blonde whom he had casually picked up the evening before, without even bothering to learn her name; the older version omitted all mention of her. The 1951 version does mention that men possessed by the invaders lost all sexual feeling‚Äîan essential element in the early parts of the plot; the original publisher completely cut out a reference to the &quot;puppet masters&quot; later discovering human sexuality and embarking upon wild orgies, broadcast live on television in the areas under their control. Also all references to the Soviet Union were eliminated.

==Reception==
Boucher and McComas characterized &quot;The Puppet Masters&quot; as &quot;a thunderously exciting melodrama of intrigue&quot;, noting that Heinlein displayed &quot;not only his usual virtues of clear logic, rigorous detail-work, and mastery of indirect exposition&quot;, but also unexpected virtues like &quot;a startling facility in suspense devices [and] a powerful ingenuity in plotting&quot;. P. Schuyler Miller, noting that the novel&#x27;s &quot;climactic situations seem to be telegraphed&quot;, suggested that Heinlein presented his background situations so effectively that readers solve the story&#x27;s mysteries more quickly than Heinlein allowed his characters to. In his &quot;Books&quot; column for &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot;, Damon Knight selected the novel as one of the 10 best SF books of the 1950s.

The book was also reviewed in the 15 June 1951 issue of &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot;. The reviewer wrote

The recurrent enigma of the flying saucer is finally solved when an aerial pieplate is caught with its exhaust down by the F.B.I. of 2007. Hero Sam penetrates the contaminated area, brings a &#x27;master&#x27; back‚Äîa gelatinous gray mass which attaches itself to a soldier&#x27;s body and controls his thought processes. Sam and his girl spot further landings, plan a counter campaign and eventually are able to rid the solar system of its parasites. Exciting, even if it exacts a strong stomach.

== Adaptations ==
&quot;The Brain Eaters&quot;, a 1958 science fiction film directed by Bruno VeSota, bore a number of similarities to Heinlein&#x27;s novel. Heinlein sued the film&#x27;s producers, including Executive Producer Roger Corman, for plagiarism, asking $150,000 in damages. The case was settled out of court for $5,000, which included Heinlein&#x27;s stipulation that his name not be used on screen or in any way with the production. The case halted actor John Payne&#x27;s intention of producing a film based on Heinlein&#x27;s novel.

The theme of the novel is echoed in &quot;The Invisibles&quot;, an episode of &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; aired in 1964, and also in &quot;Operation -- Annihilate!&quot;, the last episode of the first season of &quot;Star Trek&quot; in 1967. Similarly, in the story line begun in the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;Coming of Age&quot; and completed in &quot;Conspiracy&quot;, aliens from a faraway sector invade the bodies of high-ranking Starfleet admirals in an attempt to compromise the command structure and spearhead an invasion of Earth.

The novel was adapted, with some plot and character changes, into the 1994 film of the same name.

== Influence ==
&quot;The Body Snatchers&quot; by Jack Finney (1954) takes up a similar premise of extraterrestrials taking over the bodies of humans. Also in the plot of the 1956 &quot;What Mad Universe&quot; by Fredric Brown‚Äîas in that of &quot;Puppet Masters&quot;‚Äîpolice and vigilantes ruthlessly shoot down anyone suspected of being controlled by the book&#x27;s invaders from space.

Kenneth Von Gunden&#x27;s novel &quot;Star Spawn&quot; takes up the basic premise of &quot;The Puppet Masters&quot; and transfers it to a medieval setting. Extraterrestrial parasites able to take over the bodies of humans and control them invade Medieval England and embark on conquering it, castle by castle‚Äîand are eventually foiled by the highly resourceful Friar Gregory and his friend Sir Morrough the Knight.

N. K. Jemisin&#x27;s short story &quot;Walking Awake,&quot; included in her short story collection &quot;How Long &#x27;til Black Future Month?&quot;, is a response to Heinlein&#x27;s novel. The story follows Sadie, a caregiver who is complicit in a system that raises human hosts for alien parasitic beings (beings we later learn are not aliens, but were created by humanity in the distant past).

<doc id="45084" wikidata="Q495954" url="?curid=45084" title="Henry V (play)">
<text>The Life of Henry the Fifth, often shortened to Henry V, is a history play by William Shakespeare, believed to have been written near 1599. It tells the story of King Henry V of England, focusing on events immediately before and after the Battle of Agincourt (1415) during the Hundred Years&#x27; War. In the First Quarto text, it was titled &quot;The Cronicle History of Henry the fift&quot;, and &quot;The Life of Henry the Fifth&quot; in the First Folio text.

The play is the final part of a tetralogy, preceded by &quot;Richard II&quot;, &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot;, and &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot;. The original audiences would thus have already been familiar with the title character, who was depicted in the &quot;Henry IV&quot; plays as a wild, undisciplined young man. In &quot;Henry V&quot;, the young prince has matured. He embarks on an expedition to France and, his army greatly outnumbered, defeats the French at Agincourt.

==Synopsis==

A Chorus (a lone speaker addressing the audience) delivers the Prologue, apologizing for the limitations of the theatre and wishing that: a muse could inspire the audience&#x27;s imagination, real royals could be the actors, and the stage could be as large as a kingdom, to do justice to the story of King Henry V (or &quot;Harry&quot;). The Chorus encourages the audience to use their &quot;imaginary forces&quot; to overcome these limitations: &quot;Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts ... turning the accomplishment of many years / Into an hour-glass&quot;.

Act I deals largely with Henry and his decision to invade France, persuaded that, through ancestry, he is the rightful heir to the French throne. The French Dauphin, son of King Charles VI, answers Henry&#x27;s claims with an insulting gift of tennis balls, meant to symbolize Henry&#x27;s perceived youth and frivolity.

The Chorus reappears at the beginning of each act to advance the story. In Act II, he describes the country&#x27;s dedication to the war effort: &quot;Now all the youth of England are on fire... / Now thrive the armorers, and honor&#x27;s thought / Reigns solely in the breast of every man&quot;. Act II focuses on a plot by the Earl of Cambridge and two comrades to assassinate Henry at Southampton. Henry&#x27;s clever uncovering of the plot and his ruthless treatment of the conspirators show that he has changed from the earlier plays in which he appeared.
In Act III, Henry and his troops besiege the French port of Harfleur after crossing the English Channel. The French king, says the Chorus, &quot;doth offer him / Katharine his daughter, and with her, to dowry, / Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms&quot;, but Henry is not satisfied. At the siege of Harfleur, the English are beaten back at first, but Henry urges them on with one of Shakespeare&#x27;s best-known speeches: &quot;Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more; / Or close the wall up with our English dead&quot;. After a hard-won battle, the English take Harfleur. Montjoy, herald of the French king Charles, delivers a message of Charles&#x27;s taunts and threats, scorning Henry. Henry tells Montjoy that his forces have been so weakened that he will not yet attack Paris directly, but will instead march up the coast to Calais.

In Act IV, the full power of the French army has surrounded Henry at the small town of Agincourt. The night before the battle, knowing he is outnumbered, Henry wanders around the English camp in disguise, trying to comfort his soldiers and determine what they really think of him. He agonizes about the moral burden of being king, asking God to &quot;steel my soldiers&#x27; hearts&quot;. Daylight comes, and Henry rallies his nobles with the famous St Crispin&#x27;s Day Speech: &quot;we ... shall be remember&#x27;d; / We few, we happy few, we band of brothers&quot;. The messenger Montjoy returns to ask if Henry will avoid certain defeat by paying the French a ransom for his men&#x27;s survival. Henry requests that Montjoy &quot;bear my former answer back&quot;, thus refusing to surrender.

Shakespeare does not directly describe the Battle of Agincourt. Though the French in one scene complain that &quot;Tout est perdu&quot; (&quot;all is lost&quot;), the outcome is not clear to Henry until Montjoy reappears and declares that the &quot;day is yours&quot;. Henry soon discovers it was a deeply lop-sided victory: the French suffered 10,000 casualties, while the English lost only a Duke, an Earl, a knight, a squire, and &quot;of all other, but five and twenty&quot;. (In Laurence Olivier&#x27;s 1944 film adaptation, this line is modified to &quot;of all other men, but five and twenty score&quot;, since historians believe the English toll was approximately 600). Henry praises God for his shocking victory.

Act V opens some years later, when the war comes to a brief interval of peace, as the English and French negotiate the Treaty of Troyes, and Henry tries to woo the French princess, Katharine. Neither Henry nor Katharine speaks the other&#x27;s language well, but the humour of their mistakes actually helps Henry achieve his aim. The scene ends with the French king adopting Henry as heir to the French throne, and the prayer for unity of the French queen &quot;that English may as French, French Englishmen, receive each other.&quot;

The play concludes with the Chorus foreshadowing the death of Henry (within two years) and the tumultuous reign of his son Henry VI of England, &quot;whose state so many had the managing, that they lost France, and made his England bleed, which oft our stage hath shown&quot;. (Shakespeare here is referring to the fact that he had previously staged the trilogy of plays that focus on these later events: &quot;Henry VI Part 1&quot;, &quot;Henry VI Part 2&quot;, and &quot;Henry VI Part 3&quot;.)

===Subplots===

As in many of Shakespeare&#x27;s history and tragedy plays, a number of minor comic characters appear, contrasting with and sometimes commenting on the main plot. In this case, they are mostly common soldiers in Henry&#x27;s army, and they include Pistol, Nym, and Bardolph from the &quot;Henry IV&quot; plays. In a grim note, Bardolph is executed for looting. The army also includes a Scot, an Irishman, and an Englishman, and Fluellen, a comically stereotyped Welsh soldier. In one scene of extended French dialogue, Princess Katharine tries to learn some basic English words for body parts from her maid. The play also deals briefly with the death of Sir John Falstaff, Henry&#x27;s estranged friend from the &quot;Henry IV&quot; plays, whom Henry had rejected at the end of &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot;.

==Sources==
Shakespeare&#x27;s primary source for &quot;Henry V&quot;, as for most of his chronicle histories, was Raphael Holinshed&#x27;s &quot;Chronicles&quot;; the publication of the second edition in 1587 provides a &quot;terminus post quem&quot; for the play. Edward Hall&#x27;s &quot;The Union of the Two Illustrious Families of Lancaster and York&quot; appears also to have been consulted, and scholars have supposed that Shakespeare was familiar with Samuel Daniel&#x27;s poem on the civil wars. An earlier play, the &quot;Famous Victories of Henry V&quot; is also generally believed to have been a model for the work.

==Date and text==

On the basis of an apparent allusion to the Earl of Essex&#x27;s mission to quell Tyrone&#x27;s Rebellion, the play is thought to date from early 1599. &quot;The Chronicle History of Henry the fifth&quot; was entered into the Register of the Stationers Company on 14 August 1600 by the bookseller Thomas Pavier; the first quarto was published before the end of the year‚Äîthough by Thomas Millington and John Busby rather than Pavier. Thomas Creede did the printing.

Q1 of &quot;Henry V&quot; is a &quot;bad quarto&quot;, a shortened version of the play that might be an infringing copy or reported text. A second quarto, a reprint of Q1, was published in 1602 by Pavier; another reprint was issued as Q3 in 1619, with a false date of 1608‚Äîpart of William Jaggard&#x27;s False Folio. The superior text was first printed in the First Folio in 1623.

==Criticism and analysis==
===Views on warfare===
Readers and audiences have interpreted the play&#x27;s attitude to warfare in several different ways. On the one hand, it seems to celebrate Henry&#x27;s invasion of France and military prowess. Alternatively, it can be read as a commentary on the moral and personal cost of war. Gathered, Shakespeare presents warfare in all its complexity.

The American critic Norman Rabkin described the play as a picture with two simultaneous meanings. Rabkin argues that the play never settles on one viewpoint towards warfare, Henry himself switching his style of speech constantly, talking of &quot;rape and pillage&quot; during Harfleur, but of patriotic glory in his St Crispin&#x27;s Day Speech.

Some scholars have connected the nationalistic glorification of warfare with contemporary military ventures in Spain and Ireland. The Chorus directly refers to the looked-for military triumphs of the Earl of Essex, in the fifth act. Henry V himself is sometimes seen as an ambivalent representation of the stage machiavel, combining apparent sincerity with a willingness to use deceit and force to attain his ends.

Other commentators see the play as looking critically at the reason for Henry&#x27;s violent cause. The noble words of the Chorus and Henry are consistently undermined by the actions of Pistol, Bardolph, and Nym. Pistol talks in a bombastic blank verse that seems to parody Henry&#x27;s own style of speech. Pistol and his friends, thus, show up the actions of their rulers. Indeed, the presence of the Eastcheap characters from &quot;Henry IV&quot; has been said to emphasise the element of adventurer in Henry&#x27;s character as monarch.

The play&#x27;s ambiguity has led to diverse interpretations in performance. Laurence Olivier&#x27;s 1944 film, made during the Second World War, emphasises the patriotic side, ignoring the fact that the enemy of the play, the French, were in fact allies in that conflict, while Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s 1989 film stresses the horrors of war. A 2003 Royal National Theatre production featured Henry as a modern war general, ridiculing the Iraq invasion.

In recent years, there has been scholarly debate about whether or not Henry V can be labeled a war criminal. Some denounce the question as anachronistic, arguing that contemporary legal terminology cannot be applied to historical events or figures like those depicted in the play. However, other scholars have supported the proposed viewpoint. For instance, Christopher N. Warren looks to Alberico Gentili&#x27;s &quot;De armis Romanis&quot;, along with &quot;Henry V&quot; itself, to show how early modern thinkers (including Shakespeare) were themselves using juridical approaches to engage with the past. As a result, Warren argues, the question of whether Henry V was a war criminal is not only legitimate, but also &quot;historically appropriate&quot;.

In a rhetorical display intended to intimidate the Governor of Harfleur into surrendering the city to the English, Henry denies personal responsibility for his soldiers&#x27; actions if battle is resumed&quot;What rein can hold licentious wickedness / When down the hill he holds his fierce career?&quot;and describes in graphic detail the violence they will do to the townsfolk if his demands are not met:

The gates of mercy shall be all shut up,

And the flesh&#x27;d soldier, rough and hard of heart,

In liberty of bloody hand shall range

With conscience wide as hell, mowing like grass

Your fresh, fair virgins and your flowering infants.

:‚ÄîAct III, Scene iii.

On the other hand, Henry is portrayed as a great leader, as he keeps his temper when insulted: &quot;we are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us&quot;. He also admits to his past mistakes: &quot;did give ourselves to barbarous licence&quot; and is shown to have great confidence: &quot;I will rise there with so full a glory that I will dazzle all the eyes of France&quot;.

A mock trial of for the crimes associated with the legality of the invasion and the slaughter of prisoners was held in Washington, DC in March 2010, drawing from both historical record and Shakespeare&#x27;s play. Titled &quot;The Supreme Court of the Amalgamated Kingdom of England and France&quot;, participating judges were Justices Samuel Alito and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The outcome was originally to be determined by an audience vote, but due to a draw, it came down to a judges&#x27; decision. The court was divided on Henry&#x27;s justification for war, but unanimously found him guilty on the killing of the prisoners after applying &quot;the evolving standards of the maturing society&quot;. Previously, the fictional Global War Crimes Tribunal ruled that Henry&#x27;s war was legal, no noncombatant was killed unlawfully, and Henry bore no criminal responsibility for the death of the POWs. The fictional French Civil Liberties Union, who had instigated the tribunal, then attempted to sue in civil court. The judge concluded that he was bound by the GWCT&#x27;s conclusions of law and also ruled in favour of the English. The Court of Appeals affirmed without opinion, thus leaving the matter for the Supreme Court&#x27;s determination.

===French language===
Very brief snippets of &quot;Henry V&quot; are written originally in the French language; Act 5, Scene 2 is an example.

==Performance history==
The Chorus refers to Essex&#x27;s 1599 campaign in Ireland without any sense that it would end in disaster. The campaign began in late March and was scuttled by late June, strongly suggesting that the play was first performed during that three-month period.

A tradition, impossible to verify, holds that &quot;Henry V&quot; was the first play performed at the new Globe Theatre in the spring of 1599‚Äîthe Globe would have been the &quot;wooden O&quot; mentioned in the Prologue‚Äîbut Shapiro argues that the Chamberlain&#x27;s Men were still at The Curtain when the work was first performed, and that Shakespeare himself probably acted the Chorus. In 1600, the first printed text states that the play had been played &quot;sundry times&quot;. The earliest performance for which an exact date is known, however, occurred on 7 January 1605, at Court at Whitehall Palace.

Samuel Pepys saw a &quot;Henry V&quot; in 1664, but it was written by Roger Boyle, 1st Earl of Orrery, not by Shakespeare. Shakespeare&#x27;s play returned to the stage in 1723, in an adaptation by Aaron Hill.

The longest-running production of the play in Broadway history was the staging starring Richard Mansfield in 1900 which ran for 54 performances. Other notable stage performances of &quot;Henry V&quot; include Charles Kean (1859), Charles Alexander Calvert (1872), and Walter Hampden (1928).

==Adaptations==

=== Film ===

Three major film adaptations have been made. The first, &quot;Henry V&quot; (1944), directed by and starring Laurence Olivier, is a colourful and highly stylised version which begins in the Globe Theatre and then gradually shifts to a realistic evocation of the Battle of Agincourt. Olivier&#x27;s film was made during the Second World War and was intended as a patriotic rallying cry at the time of the invasion of Normandy.

The second major film, &quot;Henry V&quot; (1989), directed by and starring Kenneth Branagh, attempts to give a more realistic evocation of the period, and lays more emphasis on the horrors of war. It features a mud-spattered and gruesome Battle of Agincourt.

The third major film, &quot;The King (2019)&quot;, starring Timoth√©e Chalamet as Henry V, was adapted from Shakespeare&#x27;s plays &quot;Henry IV Part I&quot;, &quot;Henry IV Part II&quot;, and &quot;Henry V&quot;.

=== Television ===
In 2012, the BBC commissioned a television adaptation of the play as part of &quot;The Hollow Crown&quot; series. It was part of a tetralogy that televised the entirety of Shakespeare&#x27;s Henriad. Produced by Sam Mendes and directed by Thea Sharrock, it starred Tom Hiddleston as Henry V, who had played Prince Hal in The Hollow Crown&#x27;s adaptations of &quot;Henry IV, Part I&quot; and &quot;Henry IV, Part II&quot;. The BBC scheduled the screening of Shakespeare&#x27;s history plays as part of the 2012 Cultural Olympiad, a celebration of British culture coinciding with the 2012 Summer Olympics.

=== Dance ===
In 2004, post-modern choreographer David Gordon created a dance-theatre version of the play called &quot;Dancing Henry Five&quot;, which mixed William Walton&#x27;s music written for the Olivier film, recorded speeches from the film itself and by Christopher Plummer, and commentary written by Gordon. The piece premiered at Danspace Project in New York, where it was compared favorably to a production of &quot;Henry IV&quot; (parts 1 and 2) at Lincoln Center. It has been revived three times‚Äîin 2005, 2007, and 2011‚Äîplaying cities across the United States, and received a National Endowment for the Arts American Masterpieces in Dance Award.

=== Music ===
&quot;Suite from Henry V&quot; is a 1963 orchestral arrangement of music that composer William Walton wrote for the 1944 Olivier film. The arrangement is by Muir Mathieson, and is in five movements.

&quot;Henry V ‚Äì A Shakespeare Scenario&quot; is a 50-minute work for narrator, SATB chorus, boys&#x27; choir (optional), and full orchestra. The musical content is taken from Walton&#x27;s score for the Olivier film, edited by David Lloyd-Jones and arranged by Christopher Palmer. It was first performed at the Royal Festival Hall in London, in May 1990. Performers for this premiere were Christopher Plummer (narrator), the Academy Chorus, Choristers of Westminster Cathedral, and Academy of St Martin-in-the-Fields. The conductor was Sir Neville Marriner. A CD of the work with these performers was released by Chandos in 1990.

&quot;O For a Muse of Fire&quot; is a symphonic overture for full orchestra and vocal soloist, written by Darryl Kubian. The work is 12 minutes long, and was premiered by the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra in March 2015. The work is scored for full orchestra, with vocal soloist. The vocal part incorporates selected lines from the text, and the vocal range is adaptable to different voice types. The soloist for the premiere performances with the New Jersey Symphony was former October Project lead singer (and former Sony Classical artist) Mary Fahl.

<text>Biodiversity is the variability of life on Earth. It can be measured on various levels. There is for example genetic variability, species diversity, ecosystem diversity and phylogenetic diversity. Diversity is not distributed evenly on Earth. It is greater in the tropics as a result of the warm climate and high primary productivity in the region near the equator. Tropical forest ecosystems cover less than one-fifth of Earth&#x27;s terrestrial area and contain about 50% of the world&#x27;s species. There are latitudinal gradients in species diversity for both marine and terrestrial taxa. 

Since life began on Earth, six major mass extinctions and several minor events have led to large and sudden drops in biodiversity. The Phanerozoic aeon (the last 540¬†million years) marked a rapid growth in biodiversity via the Cambrian explosion. In this period, the majority of multicellular phyla first appeared. The next 400¬†million years included repeated, massive biodiversity losses. Those events have been classified as mass extinction events. In the Carboniferous, rainforest collapse may have led to a great loss of plant and animal life. The Permian‚ÄìTriassic extinction event, 251¬†million years ago, was the worst; vertebrate recovery took 30¬†million years. 

Human activities have led to an ongoing biodiversity loss and an accompanying loss of genetic diversity. This process is often referred to as Holocene extinction, or &quot;sixth mass extinction&quot;. For example, it was estimated in 2007 that up to 30% of all species will be extinct by 2050. Destroying habitats for farming is a key reason why biodiversity is decreasing today. Climate change also plays a role. This can be seen for example in the effects of climate change on biomes. This anthropogenic extinction may have started toward the end of the Pleistocene, as some studies suggest that the megafaunal extinction event that took place around the end of the last ice age partly resulted from overhunting. 
==Definitions==

Biologists most often define &quot;biodiversity&quot; as the &quot;totality of genes, species and ecosystems of a region&quot;. An advantage of this definition is that it presents a unified view of the traditional types of biological variety previously identified:
* taxonomic diversity (usually measured at the species diversity level)
* ecological diversity (often viewed from the perspective of ecosystem diversity)
* morphological diversity (which stems from genetic diversity and molecular diversity)
* functional diversity (which is a measure of the number of functionally disparate species within a population (e.g. different feeding mechanism, different motility, predator vs prey, etc.))

&quot;Biodiversity&quot; is most commonly used to replace the more clearly-defined and long-established terms, species diversity and species richness. However, there is no concrete definition for biodiversity, as its definition continues to be defined. Other definitions include (in chronological order):

* An explicit definition consistent with this interpretation was first given in a paper by Bruce A. Wilcox commissioned by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) for the 1982 World National Parks Conference. Wilcox&#x27;s definition was &quot;Biological diversity is the variety of life forms...at all levels of biological systems (i.e., molecular, organismic, population, species and ecosystem)...&quot;.
* A publication by Wilcox in 1984: Biodiversity can be defined genetically as the diversity of alleles, genes and organisms. They study processes such as mutation and gene transfer that drive evolution.
*The 1992 United Nations Earth Summit defined &quot;biological diversity&quot; as &quot;the variability among living organisms from all sources, including, inter alia, terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are part: this includes diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems&quot;. This definition is used in the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity.
* Gaston and Spicer&#x27;s definition in their book &quot;Biodiversity: an introduction&quot; in 2004 is &quot;variation of life at all levels of biological organization&quot;.
*The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) defined biodiversity in 2019 as &quot;the variability that exists among living organisms (both within and between species) and the ecosystems of which they are part.&quot;

== Number of species ==
According to estimates by Mora et al. (2011), there are approximately 8.7¬†million terrestrial species and 2.2¬†million oceanic species. The authors note that these estimates are strongest for eukaryotic organisms and likely represent the lower bound of prokaryote diversity. Other estimates include:
* 220,000 vascular plants, estimated using the species-area relation method
* 0.7-1¬†million marine species
* 10‚Äì30¬†million insects; (of some 0.9¬†million we know today)
* 5‚Äì10¬†million bacteria;
* 1.5-3¬†million fungi, estimates based on data from the tropics, long-term non-tropical sites and molecular studies that have revealed cryptic speciation. Some 0.075¬†million species of fungi had been documented by 2001;
* 1¬†million mites
* The number of microbial species is not reliably known, but the Global Ocean Sampling Expedition dramatically increased the estimates of genetic diversity by identifying an enormous number of new genes from near-surface plankton samples at various marine locations, initially over the 2004‚Äì2006 period. The findings may eventually cause a significant change in the way science defines species and other taxonomic categories.

Since the rate of extinction has increased, many extant species may become extinct before they are described. Not surprisingly, in the animalia the most studied groups are birds and mammals, whereas fishes and arthropods are the least studied animals groups.

== Current biodiversity loss ==


During the last century, decreases in biodiversity have been increasingly observed. It was estimated in 2007 that up to 30% of all species will be extinct by 2050. Of these, about one eighth of known plant species are threatened with extinction. Estimates reach as high as 140,000 species per year (based on Species-area theory). This figure indicates unsustainable ecological practices, because few species emerge each year. The rate of species loss is greater now than at any time in human history, with extinctions occurring at rates hundreds of times higher than background extinction rates. and expected to still grow in the upcoming years. As of 2012, some studies suggest that 25% of all mammal species could be extinct in 20 years.

In absolute terms, the planet has lost 58% of its biodiversity since 1970 according to a 2016 study by the World Wildlife Fund. The Living Planet Report 2014 claims that &quot;the number of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish across the globe is, on average, about half the size it was 40 years ago&quot;. Of that number, 39% accounts for the terrestrial wildlife gone, 39% for the marine wildlife gone and 76% for the freshwater wildlife gone. Biodiversity took the biggest hit in Latin America, plummeting 83 percent. High-income countries showed a 10% increase in biodiversity, which was canceled out by a loss in low-income countries. This is despite the fact that high-income countries use five times the ecological resources of low-income countries, which was explained as a result of a process whereby wealthy nations are outsourcing resource depletion to poorer nations, which are suffering the greatest ecosystem losses.

A 2017 study published in &quot;PLOS One&quot; found that the biomass of insect life in Germany had declined by three-quarters in the last 25 years. Dave Goulson of Sussex University stated that their study suggested that humans &quot;appear to be making vast tracts of land inhospitable to most forms of life, and are currently on course for ecological Armageddon. If we lose the insects then everything is going to collapse.&quot;

In 2020 the World Wildlife Foundation published a report saying that &quot;biodiversity is being destroyed at a rate unprecedented in human history&quot;. The report claims that 68% of the population of the examined species were destroyed in the years 1970 ‚Äì 2016.

Of 70,000 monitored species, around 48% are experiencing population declines from human activity (in 2023), whereas only 3% have increasing populations.

Rates of decline in biodiversity in the current sixth mass extinction match or exceed rates of loss in the five previous mass extinction events in the fossil record. Biodiversity loss is in fact &quot;one of the most critical manifestations of the Anthropocene&quot; (since around the 1950s); the continued decline of biodiversity constitutes &quot;an unprecedented threat&quot; to the continued existence of human civilization. The reduction is caused primarily by human impacts, particularly habitat destruction.

Since the Stone Age, species loss has accelerated above the average basal rate, driven by human activity. Estimates of species losses are at a rate 100‚Äì10,000 times as fast as is typical in the fossil record. 

Loss of biodiversity results in the loss of natural capital that supplies ecosystem goods and services. Species today are being wiped out at a rate 100 to 1,000 times higher than baseline, and the rate of extinctions is increasing. This process destroys the resilience and adaptability of life on Earth.

In 2006, many species were formally classified as rare or endangered or threatened; moreover, scientists have estimated that millions more species are at risk which have not been formally recognized. About 40 percent of the 40,177 species assessed using the IUCN Red List criteria are now listed as threatened with extinction‚Äîa total of 16,119. As of late 2022 9251 species were considered part of the IUCN&#x27;s critically endangered.

Numerous scientists and the IPBES &quot;Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services&quot; assert that human population growth and overconsumption are the primary factors in this decline. However, other scientists have criticized this finding and say that loss of habitat caused by &quot;the growth of commodities for export&quot; is the main driver.

Some studies have however pointed out that habitat destruction for the expansion of agriculture and the overexploitation of wildlife are the more significant drivers of contemporary biodiversity loss, not climate change.

== Distribution ==

Biodiversity is not evenly distributed, rather it varies greatly across the globe as well as within regions and seasons. Among other factors, the diversity of all living things (biota) depends on temperature, precipitation, altitude, soils, geography and the interactions between other species. The study of the spatial distribution of organisms, species and ecosystems, is the science of biogeography.

Diversity consistently measures higher in the tropics and in other localized regions such as the Cape Floristic Region and lower in polar regions generally. Rain forests that have had wet climates for a long time, such as Yasun√≠ National Park in Ecuador, have particularly high biodiversity.

There is local biodiversity, which directly impacts daily life, affecting the availability of fresh water, food choices, and fuel sources for humans. Regional biodiversity includes habitats and ecosystems that synergizes and either overlaps or differs on a regional scale. National biodiversity within a country determines the ability for a country to thrive according to its habitats and ecosystems on a national scale. Also, within a country, endangered species are initially supported on a national level then internationally. Ecotourism may be utilized to support the economy and encourages tourists to continue to visit and support species and ecosystems they visit, while they enjoy the available amenities provided. International biodiversity impacts global livelihood, food systems, and health. Problematic pollution, over consumption, and climate change can devastate international biodiversity. Nature-based solutions are a critical tool for a global resolution. Many species are in danger of becoming extinct and need world leaders to be proactive with the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. 

Terrestrial biodiversity is thought to be up to 25 times greater than ocean biodiversity. Forests harbour most of Earth&#x27;s terrestrial biodiversity. The conservation of the world&#x27;s biodiversity is thus utterly dependent on the way in which we interact with and use the world&#x27;s forests. A new method used in 2011, put the total number of species on Earth at 8.7¬†million, of which 2.1¬†million were estimated to live in the ocean. However, this estimate seems to under-represent the diversity of microorganisms. Forests provide habitats for 80 percent of amphibian species, 75 percent of bird species and 68 percent of mammal species. About 60 percent of all vascular plants are found in tropical forests. Mangroves provide breeding grounds and nurseries for numerous species of fish and shellfish and help trap sediments that might otherwise adversely affect seagrass beds and coral reefs, which are habitats for many more marine species. Forests span around 4 billion acres (nearly a third of the Earth&#x27;s land mass) and are home to approximately 80% of the world&#x27;s biodiversity. About 1 billion hectares are covered by primary forests. Over 700 million hectares of the world&#x27;s woods are officially protected.

The biodiversity of forests varies considerably according to factors such as forest type, geography, climate and soils ‚Äì in addition to human use. Most forest habitats in temperate regions support relatively few animal and plant species and species that tend to have large geographical distributions, while the montane forests of Africa, South America and Southeast Asia and lowland forests of Australia, coastal Brazil, the Caribbean islands, Central America and insular Southeast Asia have many species with small geographical distributions. Areas with dense human populations and intense agricultural land use, such as Europe, parts of Bangladesh, China, India and North America, are less intact in terms of their biodiversity. Northern Africa, southern Australia, coastal Brazil, Madagascar and South Africa, are also identified as areas with striking losses in biodiversity intactness. European forests in EU and non-EU nations comprise more than 30% of Europe&#x27;s land mass (around 227 million hectares), representing an almost 10% growth since 1990.

===Latitudinal gradients===
Generally, there is an increase in biodiversity from the poles to the tropics. Thus localities at lower latitudes have more species than localities at higher latitudes. This is often referred to as the latitudinal gradient in species diversity. Several ecological factors may contribute to the gradient, but the ultimate factor behind many of them is the greater mean temperature at the equator compared to that at the poles.

Even though terrestrial biodiversity declines from the equator to the poles, some studies claim that this characteristic is unverified in aquatic ecosystems, especially in marine ecosystems. The latitudinal distribution of parasites does not appear to follow this rule. Also, in terrestrial ecosystems the soil bacterial diversity has been shown to be highest in temperate climatic zones, and has been attributed to carbon inputs and habitat connectivity.

In 2016, an alternative hypothesis (&quot;the fractal biodiversity&quot;) was proposed to explain the biodiversity latitudinal gradient. In this study, the species pool size and the fractal nature of ecosystems were combined to clarify some general patterns of this gradient. This hypothesis considers temperature, moisture, and net primary production (NPP) as the main variables of an ecosystem niche and as the axis of the ecological hypervolume. In this way, it is possible to build fractal hyper volumes, whose fractal dimension rises to three moving towards the equator.

===Biodiversity Hotspots===
A biodiversity hotspot is a region with a high level of endemic species that have experienced great habitat loss. The term hotspot was introduced in 1988 by Norman Myers. While hotspots are spread all over the world, the majority are forest areas and most are located in the tropics.

Brazil&#x27;s Atlantic Forest is considered one such hotspot, containing roughly 20,000 plant species, 1,350 vertebrates and millions of insects, about half of which occur nowhere else. The island of Madagascar and India are also particularly notable. Colombia is characterized by high biodiversity, with the highest rate of species by area unit worldwide and it has the largest number of endemics (species that are not found naturally anywhere else) of any country. About 10% of the species of the Earth can be found in Colombia, including over 1,900 species of bird, more than in Europe and North America combined, Colombia has 10% of the world&#x27;s mammals species, 14% of the amphibian species and 18% of the bird species of the world. Madagascar dry deciduous forests and lowland rainforests possess a high ratio of endemism. Since the island separated from mainland Africa 66¬†million years ago, many species and ecosystems have evolved independently. Indonesia&#x27;s 17,000 islands cover and contain 10% of the world&#x27;s flowering plants, 12% of mammals and 17% of reptiles, amphibians and birds‚Äîalong with nearly 240¬†million people. Many regions of high biodiversity and/or endemism arise from specialized habitats which require unusual adaptations, for example, alpine environments in high mountains, or Northern European peat bogs.

Accurately measuring differences in biodiversity can be difficult. Selection bias amongst researchers may contribute to biased empirical research for modern estimates of biodiversity. In 1768, Rev. Gilbert White succinctly observed of his Selborne, Hampshire &quot;&quot;all nature is so full, that that district produces the most variety which is the most examined.&quot;&quot;

==Evolution over geologic timeframes==

Biodiversity is the result of 3.5¬†billion years of evolution. The origin of life has not been established by science, however, some evidence suggests that life may already have been well-established only a few hundred million years after the formation of the Earth. Until approximately 2.5¬†billion years ago, all life consisted of microorganisms ‚Äì archaea, bacteria, and single-celled protozoans and protists.

Biodiversity grew fast during the Phanerozoic (the last 540¬†million years), especially during the so-called Cambrian explosion‚Äîa period during which nearly every phylum of multicellular organisms first appeared. However, recent studies suggest that this diversification had started earlier, at least in the Ediacaran, and that it continued in the Ordovician. Over the next 400¬†million years or so, invertebrate diversity showed little overall trend and vertebrate diversity shows an overall exponential trend. This dramatic rise in diversity was marked by periodic, massive losses of diversity classified as mass extinction events. A significant loss occurred in anamniotic limbed vertebrates when rainforests collapsed in the Carboniferous, but amniotes seem to have been little affected by this event; their diversification slowed down later, around the Asselian/Sakmarian boundary, in the early Cisuralian (Early Permian), about 293 Ma ago. The worst was the Permian-Triassic extinction event, 251¬†million years ago. Vertebrates took 30¬†million years to recover from this event. 

The most recent major mass extinction event, the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event, occurred 66¬†million years ago. This period has attracted more attention than others because it resulted in the extinction of the dinosaurs, which were represented by many lineages at the end of the Maastrichtian, just before that extinction event. However, many other taxa were affected by this crisis, which affected even marine taxa, such as ammonites, which also became extinct around that time.

The biodiversity of the past is called Paleobiodiversity. The fossil record suggests that the last few million years featured the greatest biodiversity in history. However, not all scientists support this view, since there is uncertainty as to how strongly the fossil record is biased by the greater availability and preservation of recent geologic sections. Some scientists believe that corrected for sampling artifacts, modern biodiversity may not be much different from biodiversity 300¬†million years ago, whereas others consider the fossil record reasonably reflective of the diversification of life. Estimates of the present global macroscopic species diversity vary from 2¬†million to 100¬†million, with a best estimate of somewhere near 9¬†million, the vast majority arthropods. Diversity appears to increase continually in the absence of natural selection.

===Diversification===
The existence of a &quot;global carrying capacity&quot;, limiting the amount of life that can live at once, is debated, as is the question of whether such a limit would also cap the number of species. While records of life in the sea show a logistic pattern of growth, life on land (insects, plants and tetrapods) shows an exponential rise in diversity. As one author states, &quot;Tetrapods have not yet invaded 64 percent of potentially habitable modes and it could be that without human influence the ecological and taxonomic diversity of tetrapods would continue to increase exponentially until most or all of the available eco-space is filled.&quot;

It also appears that the diversity continues to increase over time, especially after mass extinctions.

On the other hand, changes through the Phanerozoic correlate much better with the hyperbolic model (widely used in population biology, demography and macrosociology, as well as fossil biodiversity) than with exponential and logistic models. The latter models imply that changes in diversity are guided by a first-order positive feedback (more ancestors, more descendants) and/or a negative feedback arising from resource limitation. Hyperbolic model implies a second-order positive feedback. Differences in the strength of the second-order feedback due to different intensities of interspecific competition might explain the faster rediversification of ammonoids in comparison to bivalves after the end-Permian extinction. The hyperbolic pattern of the world population growth arises from a second-order positive feedback between the population size and the rate of technological growth. The hyperbolic character of biodiversity growth can be similarly accounted for by a feedback between diversity and community structure complexity. The similarity between the curves of biodiversity and human population probably comes from the fact that both are derived from the interference of the hyperbolic trend with cyclical and stochastic dynamics.

Most biologists agree however that the period since human emergence is part of a new mass extinction, named the Holocene extinction event, caused primarily by the impact humans are having on the environment. It has been argued that the present rate of extinction is sufficient to eliminate most species on the planet Earth within 100 years.

New species are regularly discovered (on average between 5‚Äì10,000 new species each year, most of them insects) and many, though discovered, are not yet classified (estimates are that nearly 90% of all arthropods are not yet classified). Most of the terrestrial diversity is found in tropical forests and in general, the land has more species than the ocean; some 8.7¬†million species may exist on Earth, of which some 2.1¬†million live in the ocean.

=== Species diversity in geologic time frames ===
It is estimated that 5 to 50 billion species have existed on the planet. Assuming that there may be a maximum of about 50 million species currently alive, it stands to reason that greater than 99% of the planet&#x27;s species went extinct prior to the evolution of humans. Estimates on the number of Earth&#x27;s current species range from 10¬†million to 14¬†million, of which about 1.2¬†million have been documented and over 86% have not yet been described. However, a May 2016 scientific report estimates that 1 trillion species are currently on Earth, with only one-thousandth of one percent described. The total amount of related DNA base pairs on Earth is estimated at 5.0 x 1037 and weighs 50¬†billion tonnes. In comparison, the total mass of the biosphere has been estimated to be as much as four trillion tons of carbon. In July 2016, scientists reported identifying a set of 355 genes from the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) of all organisms living on Earth.

The age of Earth is about 4.54¬†billion years. The earliest undisputed evidence of life dates at least from 3.7¬†billion years ago, during the Eoarchean era after a geological crust started to solidify following the earlier molten Hadean eon. There are microbial mat fossils found in 3.48¬†billion-year-old sandstone discovered in Western Australia. Other early physical evidence of a biogenic substance is graphite in 3.7¬†billion-year-old meta-sedimentary rocks discovered in Western Greenland.. More recently, in 2015, &quot;remains of biotic life&quot; were found in 4.1¬†billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia. According to one of the researchers, &quot;If life arose relatively quickly on Earth...then it could be common in the universe.&quot;

==Role and benefits of biodiversity ==
===Ecosystem services===
There have been many claims about biodiversity&#x27;s effect on the ecosystem services, especially &quot;provisioning&quot; and &quot;regulating services&quot;. Some of those claims have been validated, some are incorrect and some lack enough evidence to draw definitive conclusions.

Ecosystem services have been grouped in three types:
# Provisioning services which involve the production of renewable resources (e.g.: food, wood, fresh water)
# Regulating services which are those that lessen environmental change (e.g.: climate regulation, pest/disease control)
# Cultural services represent human value and enjoyment (e.g.: landscape aesthetics, cultural heritage, outdoor recreation and spiritual significance)

Experiments with controlled environments have shown that humans cannot easily build ecosystems to support human needs; for example insect pollination cannot be mimicked, though there have been attempts to create artificial pollinators using unmanned aerial vehicles. The economic activity of pollination alone represented between $2.1‚Äì14.6¬†billion in 2003. Other sources have reported somewhat conflicting results and in 1997 Robert Costanza and his colleagues reported the estimated global value of ecosystem services (not captured in traditional markets) at an average of $33¬†trillion annually.

==== Provisioning services ====
With regards to provisioning services, greater species diversity has the following benefits:
* Greater species diversity of plants increases fodder yield (synthesis of 271 experimental studies).
* Greater species diversity of plants (i.e. diversity within a single species) increases overall crop yield (synthesis of 575 experimental studies). Although another review of 100 experimental studies reported mixed evidence.
* Greater species diversity of trees increases overall wood production (synthesis of 53 experimental studies). However, there is not enough data to draw a conclusion about the effect of tree trait diversity on wood production.

==== Regulating services ====
With regards to regulating services, greater species diversity has the following benefits:

Greater species diversity
* of fish increases the stability of fisheries yield (synthesis of 8 observational studies)
* of plants increases carbon sequestration, but note that this finding only relates to actual uptake of carbon dioxide and not long-term storage; synthesis of 479 experimental studies)
* of plants increases soil nutrient remineralization (synthesis of 103 experimental studies), increases soil organic matter (synthesis of 85 experimental studies) and decreases disease prevalence on plants (synthesis of 107 experimental studies)
* of natural pest enemies decreases herbivorous pest populations (data from two separate reviews; synthesis of 266 experimental and observational studies; Synthesis of 18 observational studies. Although another review of 38 experimental studies found mixed support for this claim, suggesting that in cases where mutual intraguild predation occurs, a single predatory species is often more effective

===Agriculture===

Agricultural diversity can be divided into two categories: intraspecific diversity, which includes the genetic variation within a single species, like the potato (&quot;Solanum tuberosum&quot;) that is composed of many different forms and types (e.g. in the U.S. they might compare russet potatoes with new potatoes or purple potatoes, all different, but all part of the same species, &quot;S. tuberosum&quot;). The other category of agricultural diversity is called interspecific diversity and refers to the number and types of different species.

Agricultural diversity can also be divided by whether it is &#x27;planned&#x27; diversity or &#x27;associated&#x27; diversity. This is a functional classification that we impose and not an intrinsic feature of life or diversity. Planned diversity includes the crops which a farmer has encouraged, planted or raised (e.g. crops, covers, symbionts, and livestock, among others), which can be contrasted with the associated diversity that arrives among the crops, uninvited (e.g. herbivores, weed species and pathogens, among others).

Associated biodiversity can be damaging or beneficial. The beneficial associated biodiversity include for instance wild pollinators such as wild bees and syrphid flies that pollinate crops and natural enemies and antagonists to pests and pathogens. Beneficial associated biodiversity occurs abundantly in crop fields and provide multiple ecosystem services such as pest control, nutrient cycling and pollination that support crop production.

Although about 80 percent of humans&#x27; food supply comes from just 20 kinds of plants, humans use at least 40,000 species. Earth&#x27;s surviving biodiversity provides resources for increasing the range of food and other products suitable for human use, although the present extinction rate shrinks that potential.

===Human health===
Biodiversity&#x27;s relevance to human health is becoming an international political issue, as scientific evidence builds on the global health implications of biodiversity loss. This issue is closely linked with the issue of climate change, as many of the anticipated health risks of climate change are associated with changes in biodiversity (e.g. changes in populations and distribution of disease vectors, scarcity of fresh water, impacts on agricultural biodiversity and food resources etc.). This is because the species most likely to disappear are those that buffer against infectious disease transmission, while surviving species tend to be the ones that increase disease transmission, such as that of West Nile Virus, Lyme disease and Hantavirus, according to a study done co-authored by Felicia Keesing, an ecologist at Bard College and Drew Harvell, associate director for Environment of the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future (ACSF) at Cornell University.

Some of the health issues influenced by biodiversity include dietary health and nutrition security, infectious disease, medical science and medicinal resources, social and psychological health. Biodiversity is also known to have an important role in reducing disaster risk and in post-disaster relief and recovery efforts.

Biodiversity provides critical support for drug discovery and the availability of medicinal resources. A significant proportion of drugs are derived, directly or indirectly, from biological sources: at least 50% of the pharmaceutical compounds on the US market are derived from plants, animals and microorganisms, while about 80% of the world population depends on medicines from nature (used in either modern or traditional medical practice) for primary healthcare. Only a tiny fraction of wild species has been investigated for medical potential.

Marine ecosystems are particularly important, although inappropriate bioprospecting can increase biodiversity loss, as well as violating the laws of the communities and states from which the resources are taken.

===Business and industry===
Many industrial materials derive directly from biological sources. These include building materials, fibers, dyes, rubber, and oil. Biodiversity is also important to the security of resources such as water, timber, paper, fiber, and food. As a result, biodiversity loss is a significant risk factor in business development and a threat to long-term economic sustainability. 

===Cultural and aesthetic value===
Philosophically it could be argued that biodiversity has intrinsic aesthetic and spiritual value to mankind &quot;in and of itself&quot;. This idea can be used as a counterweight to the notion that tropical forests and other ecological realms are only worthy of conservation because of the services they provide.

Biodiversity also affords many non-material benefits including spiritual and aesthetic values, knowledge systems and education.
==Measuring biodiversity==
=== Analytical limits ===
Less than 1% of all species that have been described have been studied beyond noting their existence. The vast majority of Earth&#x27;s species are microbial. Contemporary biodiversity physics is &quot;firmly fixated on the visible [macroscopic] world&quot;. For example, microbial life is metabolically and environmentally more diverse than multicellular life (see e.g., extremophile). &quot;On the tree of life, based on analyses of small-subunit ribosomal RNA, visible life consists of barely noticeable twigs. The inverse relationship of size and population recurs higher on the evolutionary ladder‚Äîto a first approximation, all multicellular species on Earth are insects&quot;. Insect extinction rates are high‚Äîsupporting the Holocene extinction hypothesis.

== Biodiversity changes (other than losses) ==

=== Natural seasonal variations ===
Biodiversity naturally varies due to seasonal shifts. Spring&#x27;s arrival enhances biodiversity as numerous species breed and feed, while winter&#x27;s onset temporarily reduces it as some insects perish and migrating animals leave. Additionally, the seasonal fluctuation in plant and invertebrate populations influences biodiversity.

=== Introduced and invasive species ===

Barriers such as large rivers, seas, oceans, mountains and deserts encourage diversity by enabling independent evolution on either side of the barrier, via the process of allopatric speciation. The term invasive species is applied to species that breach the natural barriers that would normally keep them constrained. Without barriers, such species occupy new territory, often supplanting native species by occupying their niches, or by using resources that would normally sustain native species.

Species are increasingly being moved by humans (on purpose and accidentally). Some studies say that diverse ecosystems are more resilient and resist invasive plants and animals. Many studies cite effects of invasive species on natives, but not extinctions. 

Invasive species seem to increase local (alpha diversity) diversity, which decreases turnover of diversity (beta diversity). Overall gamma diversity may be lowered because species are going extinct because of other causes, but even some of the most insidious invaders (e.g.: Dutch elm disease, emerald ash borer, chestnut blight in North America) have not caused their host species to become extinct. Extirpation, population decline and homogenization of regional biodiversity are much more common. Human activities have frequently been the cause of invasive species circumventing their barriers, by introducing them for food and other purposes. Human activities therefore allow species to migrate to new areas (and thus become invasive) occurred on time scales much shorter than historically have been required for a species to extend its range.

At present, several countries have already imported so many exotic species, particularly agricultural and ornamental plants, that their indigenous fauna/flora may be outnumbered. For example, the introduction of kudzu from Southeast Asia to Canada and the United States has threatened biodiversity in certain areas. Another example are pines, which have invaded forests, shrublands and grasslands in the southern hemisphere.

===Hybridization and genetic pollution===
Endemic species can be threatened with extinction through the process of genetic pollution, i.e. uncontrolled hybridization, introgression and genetic swamping. Genetic pollution leads to homogenization or replacement of local genomes as a result of either a numerical and/or fitness advantage of an introduced species.
Hybridization and introgression are side-effects of introduction and invasion. These phenomena can be especially detrimental to rare species that come into contact with more abundant ones. The abundant species can interbreed with the rare species, swamping its gene pool. This problem is not always apparent from morphological (outward appearance) observations alone. Some degree of gene flow is normal adaptation and not all gene and genotype constellations can be preserved. However, hybridization with or without introgression may, nevertheless, threaten a rare species&#x27; existence.

== Conservation ==


Conservation biology matured in the mid-20th century as ecologists, naturalists and other scientists began to research and address issues pertaining to global biodiversity declines.

The conservation ethic advocates management of natural resources for the purpose of sustaining biodiversity in species, ecosystems, the evolutionary process and human culture and society.

Conservation biology is reforming around strategic plans to protect biodiversity. Preserving global biodiversity is a priority in strategic conservation plans that are designed to engage public policy and concerns affecting local, regional and global scales of communities, ecosystems and cultures. Action plans identify ways of sustaining human well-being, employing natural capital, macroeconomic policies including economic incentives, and ecosystem services.

In the EU Directive 1999/22/EC zoos are described as having a role in the preservation of the biodiversity of wildlife animals by conducting research or participation in breeding programs.

===Protection and restoration techniques===
Removal of exotic species will allow the species that they have negatively impacted to recover their ecological niches. Exotic species that have become pests can be identified taxonomically (e.g.,¬†with Digital Automated Identification SYstem (DAISY), using the barcode of life). Removal is practical only given large groups of individuals due to the economic cost.

As sustainable populations of the remaining native species in an area become assured, &quot;missing&quot; species that are candidates for reintroduction can be identified using databases such as the &quot;Encyclopedia of Life&quot; and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility.
* Biodiversity banking places a monetary value on biodiversity. One example is the Australian Native Vegetation Management Framework.
* Gene banks are collections of specimens and genetic material. Some banks intend to reintroduce banked species to the ecosystem (e.g.,¬†via tree nurseries).
* Reduction and better targeting of pesticides allows more species to survive in agricultural and urbanized areas.
* Location-specific approaches may be less useful for protecting migratory species. One approach is to create wildlife corridors that correspond to the animals&#x27; movements. National and other boundaries can complicate corridor creation.

==Protected areas==
Protected areas, including forest reserves and biosphere reserves, serve many functions including for affording protection to wild animals and their habitat. Protected areas have been set up all over the world with the specific aim of protecting and conserving plants and animals. Some scientists have called on the global community to designate as protected areas of 30 percent of the planet by 2030, and 50 percent by 2050, in order to mitigate biodiversity loss from anthropogenic causes. The target of protecting 30% of the area of the planet by the year 2030 (30 by 30) was adopted by almost 200 countries in the 2022 United Nations Biodiversity Conference. At the moment of adoption (December 2022) 17% of land territory and 10% of ocean territory were protected. In a study published 4 September 2020 in Science Advances researchers mapped out regions that can help meet critical conservation and climate goals.

Protected areas safeguard nature and cultural resources and contribute to livelihoods, particularly at local level. There are over 238 563 designated protected areas worldwide, equivalent to 14.9 percent of the earth&#x27;s land surface, varying in their extension, level of protection, and type of management (IUCN, 2018).

The benefits of protected areas extend beyond their immediate environment and time. In addition to conserving nature, protected areas are crucial for securing the long-term delivery of ecosystem services. They provide numerous benefits including the conservation of genetic resources for food and agriculture, the provision of medicine and health benefits, the provision of water, recreation and tourism, and for acting as a buffer against disaster. Increasingly, there is acknowledgement of the wider socioeconomic values of these natural ecosystems and of the ecosystem services they can provide.

===National parks and wildlife sanctuaries===
A national park is a large natural or near natural area set aside to protect large-scale ecological processes, which also provide a foundation for environmentally and culturally compatible, spiritual, scientific, educational, recreational and visitor opportunities. These areas are selected by governments or private organizations to protect natural biodiversity along with its underlying ecological structure and supporting environmental processes, and to promote education and recreation. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and its World Commission on Protected Areas (WCPA), has defined &quot;National Park&quot; as its Category II type of protected areas. Wildlife sanctuaries aim only at the conservation of species 

===Forest protected areas===
Forest protected areas are a subset of all protected areas in which a significant portion of the area is forest. This may be the whole or only a part of the protected area. Globally, 18 percent of the world&#x27;s forest area, or more than 700 million hectares, fall within legally established protected areas such as national parks, conservation areas and game reserves. 

There is an estimated 726 million ha of forest in protected areas worldwide. Of the six major world regions, South America has the highest share of forests in protected areas, 31 percent. The forests play a vital role in harboring more than 45,000 floral and 81,000 faunal species of which 5150 floral and 1837 faunal species are endemic. In addition, there are 60,065 different tree species in the world. Plant and animal species confined to a specific geographical area are called endemic species. 

In forest reserves, rights to activities like hunting and grazing are sometimes given to communities living on the fringes of the forest, who sustain their livelihood partially or wholly from forest resources or products. 

Approximately 50 million hectares (or 24%) of European forest land is protected for biodiversity and landscape protection. Forests allocated for soil, water, and other ecosystem services encompass around 72 million hectares (32% of European forest area).

== Role of society ==

=== Transformative change ===
In 2019, a summary for policymakers of the largest, most comprehensive study to date of biodiversity and ecosystem services, the &quot;Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services&quot;, was published by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). It stated that &quot;the state of nature has deteriorated at an unprecedented and accelerating rate&quot;. To fix the problem, humanity will need a transformative change, including sustainable agriculture, reductions in consumption and waste, fishing quotas and collaborative water management.

The concept of nature-positive is playing a role in mainstreaming the goals of the Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) for biodiversity. The aim of mainstreaming is to embed biodiversity considerations into public and private practice to conserve and sustainably use biodiversity on global and local levels. The concept of nature-positive refers to the societal goal to halt and reverse biodiversity loss, measured from a baseline of 2020 levels, and to achieve full so-called &quot;nature recovery&quot; by 2050. 

=== Citizen science ===
Citizen science, also known as public participation in scientific research, has been widely used in environmental sciences and is particularly popular in a biodiversity-related context. It has been used to enable scientists to involve the general public in biodiversity research, thereby enabling the scientists to collect data that they would otherwise not have been able to obtain.

Volunteer observers have made significant contributions to on-the-ground knowledge about biodiversity, and recent improvements in technology have helped increase the flow and quality of occurrences from citizen sources. A 2016 study published in Biological Conservation registers the massive contributions that citizen scientists already make to data mediated by the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). Despite some limitations of the dataset-level analysis, it is clear that nearly half of all occurrence records shared through the GBIF network come from datasets with significant volunteer contributions. Recording and sharing observations are enabled by several global-scale platforms, including iNaturalist and eBird.

==Legal status==
===International===
* United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (1992) and Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety;
* UN BBNJ (High Seas Treaty) 2023 Intergovernmental conference on an international legally binding instrument under the UNCLOS on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction (GA resolution 72/249)
* Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES);
* Ramsar Convention (Wetlands);
* Bonn Convention on Migratory Species;
* UNESCO Convention concerning the Protection of the World&#x27;s Cultural and Natural Heritage (indirectly by protecting biodiversity habitats)
* UNESCO Global Geoparks
* Regional Conventions such as the Apia Convention
* Bilateral agreements such as the Japan-Australia Migratory Bird Agreement.

Global agreements such as the Convention on Biological Diversity, give &quot;sovereign national rights over biological resources&quot; (not property). The agreements commit countries to &quot;conserve biodiversity&quot;, &quot;develop resources for sustainability&quot; and &quot;share the benefits&quot; resulting from their use. Biodiverse countries that allow bioprospecting or collection of natural products, expect a share of the benefits rather than allowing the individual or institution that discovers/exploits the resource to capture them privately. Bioprospecting can become a type of biopiracy when such principles are not respected.

Sovereignty principles can rely upon what is better known as Access and Benefit Sharing Agreements (ABAs). The Convention on Biodiversity implies informed consent between the source country and the collector, to establish which resource will be used and for what and to settle on a fair agreement on benefit sharing.

On the 19 of December 2022, during the 2022 United Nations Biodiversity Conference every country on earth, with the exception of the United States and the Holy See, signed onto the agreement which includes protecting 30% of land and oceans by 2030 (30 by 30) and 22 other targets intended to reduce biodiversity loss. The agreement includes also recovering 30% of earth degraded ecosystems and increasing funding for biodiversity issues.

==== European Union ====
In May 2020, the European Union published its Biodiversity Strategy for 2030. The biodiversity strategy is an essential part of the climate change mitigation strategy of the European Union. From the 25% of the European budget that will go to fight climate change, large part will go to restore biodiversity and nature based solutions.

The EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 include the next targets:
* Protect 30% of the sea territory and 30% of the land territory especially Old-growth forests.
* Plant 3¬†billion trees by 2030.
* Restore at least 25,000 kilometers of rivers, so they will become free flowing.
* Reduce the use of Pesticides by 50% by 2030.
* Increase Organic farming. In linked EU program From Farm to Fork it is said, that the target is making 25% of EU agriculture organic, by 2030.
* Increase biodiversity in agriculture.
* Give ‚Ç¨20¬†billion per year to the issue and make it part of the business practice.

Approximately half of the global GDP depend on nature. In Europe many parts of the economy that generate trillions of euros per year depend on nature. The benefits of Natura 2000 alone in Europe are ‚Ç¨200 ‚Äì ‚Ç¨300¬†billion per year.

===National level laws===
Biodiversity is taken into account in some political and judicial decisions:
* The relationship between law and ecosystems is very ancient and has consequences for biodiversity. It is related to private and public property rights. It can define protection for threatened ecosystems, but also some rights and duties (for example, fishing and hunting rights).
* Law regarding species is more recent. It defines species that must be protected because they may be threatened by extinction. The U.S. Endangered Species Act is an example of an attempt to address the &quot;law and species&quot; issue.
* Laws regarding gene pools are only about a century old. Domestication and plant breeding methods are not new, but advances in genetic engineering have led to tighter laws covering distribution of genetically modified organisms, gene patents and process patents. Governments struggle to decide whether to focus on for example, genes, genomes, or organisms and species.

Uniform approval for use of biodiversity as a legal standard has not been achieved, however. Bosselman argues that biodiversity should not be used as a legal standard, claiming that the remaining areas of scientific uncertainty cause unacceptable administrative waste and increase litigation without promoting preservation goals.

India passed the Biological Diversity Act in 2002 for the conservation of biological diversity in India. The Act also provides mechanisms for equitable sharing of benefits from the use of traditional biological resources and knowledge.

== History of the term ==
* 1916 ‚Äì The term &quot;biological diversity&quot; was used first by J. Arthur Harris in &quot;The Variable Desert&quot;, &quot;Scientific American&quot;: &quot;The bare statement that the region contains a flora rich in genera and species and of diverse geographic origin or affinity is entirely inadequate as a description of its real biological diversity.&quot;
* 1967 ‚Äì Raymond F. Dasmann used the term biological diversity in reference to the richness of living nature that conservationists should protect in his book A Different Kind of Country.
* 1974 ‚Äì The term &quot;natural diversity&quot; was introduced by John Terborgh.
* 1980 ‚Äì Thomas Lovejoy introduced the term &quot;biological diversity&quot; to the scientific community in a book. It rapidly became commonly used.
* 1985 ‚Äì According to Edward O. Wilson, the contracted form &quot;biodiversity&quot; was coined by W. G. Rosen: &quot;The National Forum on BioDiversity ... was conceived by Walter G.Rosen ... Dr. Rosen represented the NRC/NAS throughout the planning stages of the project. Furthermore, he introduced the term &quot;biodiversity&quot;&quot;.
* 1985 ‚Äì The term &quot;biodiversity&quot; appears in the article, &quot;A New Plan to Conserve the Earth&#x27;s Biota&quot; by Laura Tangley.
* 1988 ‚Äì The term biodiversity first appeared in publication.
* 1988 to Present ‚Äì The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Ad Hoc Working Group of Experts on Biological Diversity in began working in November 1988, leading to the publication of the draft Convention on Biological Diversity in May 1992. Since this time, there have been 16 Conferences of the Parties (COPs) to discuss potential global political responses to biodiversity loss. Most recently COP 16 in Cali, Colombia in 2024.

<doc id="45089" wikidata="Q1616724" url="?curid=45089" title="Karuta">
<text>are Japanese playing cards. Playing cards were introduced to Japan by Portuguese traders during the mid-16th century. These early decks were used for trick-taking games. The earliest indigenous &quot;karuta&quot; was invented in the town of Miike in Chikugo Province at around the end of the 16th century. The Miike karuta Memorial Hall located in ≈åmuta, Fukuoka, is the only municipal museum in Japan dedicated specifically to the history of &quot;karuta&quot;.

&quot;Karuta&quot; packs are classified into two groups, those that are descended from Portuguese-suited playing cards and those from &quot;e-awase&quot;. &quot;E-awase&quot; originally derived from &quot;kai-awase&quot;, which was played with shells but were converted to card format during the early 17th century. The basic idea of any &quot;e-awase karuta&quot; game is to be able to quickly determine which card out of an array of cards is required and then to grab the card before it is grabbed by an opponent. It is often played by children at elementary school and junior high-school level during class, as an educational exercise.

== Portuguese-derived karuta ==

===Komatsufuda===

The first indigenous Japanese deck was the &quot;Tensh≈ç karuta&quot; named after the Tensh≈ç period (1573‚Äì92). It was a 48 card deck with the 10s missing like Portuguese-suited playing cards from that period. It kept the four Latin suits of cups, coins, clubs, and swords along with the three face cards of female knave, knight, and king. In 1633, the Tokugawa shogunate banned these cards, forcing Japanese manufacturers to radically redesign their cards. As a result of Japan&#x27;s isolationist &quot;Sakoku&quot; policy, karuta would develop separately from the rest of the world. In order to evade the proscription of Portuguese derived cards, makers turned the cards into very abstract designs known as &quot;mekuri karuta&quot; (Japanese: , English: Flip cards). By the mid-20th century, all &quot;mekuri karuta&quot; fell into oblivion with the exception of &quot;Komatsufuda&quot; (Japanese: , English: Small pine cards) which is used to play Kakkuri, a game similar to Poch, found in Yafune, Fukui prefecture.

===Unsun karuta===

The &quot;Unsun karuta&quot; (Japanese: ) deck developed in the late 17th century. It has five suits of 15 ranks each for a total of 75 cards. Six of the ranks were face cards of female knave, knight, king, &quot;Un&quot; („ÅÜ„Çì), &quot;Sun&quot; („Åô„Çì), and dragon. The Portuguese deck used to have dragons on their aces; the Unsun karuta made the aces and dragons separate cards. The order of the court cards change depending on whether it is the trump suit or not just like in Ombre. The new Guru suit used circular whirls (&quot;mitsudomoe&quot;) as pips. Unsun karuta is still used in Hitoyoshi, Kumamoto, to play &quot;hachinin-meri&quot;, a game descended from Guritipau, a relative of Ombre. This game preserves some very archaic features such as inverted ranking for the pip cards in the three round suits. Inverted ranking is a feature found in Madiao, Khanhoo, T·ªï t√¥m, Ganjifa, Tarot, Ombre, and Maw and is believed to have originated in the very earliest card games.

===Kabufuda===
&quot;Kabufuda&quot; (Japanese: ) is another derivative of &quot;mekuri karuta&quot; but all the suits were made identical. It is used for gambling games such as Oicho-Kabu. They come in decks of 40 cards with designs representing the numbers 1 through 10. There are four cards for each number and the 10 (Jack) is the only face card.

===Harifuda and Hikifuda===
The gambling game of can be played with either a &quot;Harifuda&quot; () or &quot;Hikifuda&quot; (, lit. &quot;Drawn cards&quot;) set. &quot;Harifuda&quot; contains seven copies of cards numbered one to six in stylized Chinese numerals for a total of 42 cards. The 48-card &quot;Hikifuda&quot; or &quot;Mamefuda&quot; (, lit. &quot;Bean cards&quot;) has eight copies of cards with one to six coins, similar to the coins of a &quot;mekuri karuta&quot; set. In Tehonbiki, the player tries to guess which number from 1 to 6 the dealer has selected. Some sets may include indicator cards to raise or hedge bets.

=== Hanafuda ===

&quot;Hanafuda&quot; (Japanese: , lit. &quot;flower cards&quot;, also called Hanakaruta) are 48 card decks with flower designs originating from the early 19th century. Instead of being divided by 4 suits with 12 cards each, a hanafuda deck is divided by 12 suits (months) with 4 cards each. Hanafuda games are mostly fishing games.

==E-awase karuta==

===Uta-garuta===

&quot;Uta-garuta&quot; (, lit. &quot;poetry karuta&quot;) is a card game in which 100 &quot;waka&quot; poems are written on two sets of 100 cards: one set is yomifuda (, lit. &quot;reading cards&quot;), which have the complete poem taken from the , and the other is torifuda (, lit. &quot;grabbing cards&quot;), which each correspond to a yomifuda and have only the last few lines of the corresponding poem on them. One person is chosen to be the reader. As the reader reads a yomifuda, the players race to find its associated torifuda before anybody else does. This game has traditionally been played on New Year&#x27;s Day since 1904. Competitive karuta has competitions on various levels with the Japan national championship tournament being held every January at Omi shrine (a Shinto shrine) in ≈åtsu, Shiga since 1955.

A few non-matching games exist that use only the yomifuda. Bouzu Mekuri (), is a simple game of chance originating from the Meiji period. (Color Crowns) is a 4-player partnership game that is related to Goita. In both games, the poems are irrelevant, and the only parts of the cards that matter are the appearance of the poets such as their clothing, sex, or social status.

====Ita-karuta====
&quot;Ita-karuta&quot; (Japanese: ) is a variation found in Hokkaido. The torifuda are made of wood while the yomifuda remain the same or lack illustrations of the poets. They are used to play a competitive partnership game called &quot;&quot; in which the last half of the poem is read.

===Iroha karuta===
&quot;Iroha karuta&quot; (Japanese: ) is an easier-to-understand matching game for children, similar to Uta-garuta but with 96 cards. Instead of poems, the cards represent the 47 syllables of the hiragana syllabary and adds &quot;ky≈ç&quot; (, &quot;capital&quot;) for the 48th (since the syllable &quot;-n&quot; can never start any word or phrase). It uses the old iroha ordering for the syllables which includes two obsolete syllables, &quot;wi&quot; () and &quot;we&quot; (). A typical &quot;torifuda&quot; features a drawing with a &quot;kana&quot; at one corner of the card. Its corresponding &quot;yomifuda&quot; features a proverb connected to the picture with the first syllable being the &quot;kana&quot; displayed on the &quot;torifuda&quot;. There are 3 standard Iroha karuta variants: Kamigata, Edo and Owari. Each variant has its own set of proverbs based on the local dialect and culture. The Kamigata or Kyoto version is the oldest but the Edo version is the most widespread, being found all over Japan. The Owari variant existed only during the latter half of the 19th-century before being supplanted by the Edo version.

====Obake karuta====
&quot;Obake karuta&quot; is an obsolete variation of Iroha karuta unique to Tokyo. The cards were created in the Edo period and remained popular through the 1910s or 1920s. Each card in the deck features a hiragana syllable and a creature from Japanese mythology; in fact, &quot;obake karuta&quot; means &quot;ghost cards&quot; or &quot;monster cards&quot;. Success requires knowledge of Japanese mythology and folklore as players attempt to collect cards that match clues read by a referee. The player who accumulates the most cards by the end of the game wins.

&quot;Obake karuta&quot; is an early example of the common Japanese fascination with classifying monsters and creating new ones. The game is one of the earliest attempts by Japanese companies to categorize legendary creatures, label them, define them, and subsequently market them. As such, it is a precursor to the &quot;Godzilla&quot; films of the 1950s and later. Even more closely, &quot;obake karuta&quot; resembles the &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; or &quot;Pok√©mon Trading Card Game&quot;, which also involves collecting cards that represent fabulous creatures. In fact, many Pok√©mon were designed specifically after creatures from Japanese mythology.
