<doc id="45094" wikidata="Q842052" url="?curid=45094" title="Marsala wine">
<text>Marsala is a fortified wine, dry or sweet, produced in the region surrounding the Italian city of Marsala in Sicily. Marsala first received &quot;Denominazione di Origine Controllata&quot; (DOC) status in 1969.
The European Union grants Protected designation of origin (PDO) status to Marsala and most other countries limit the use of the term &quot;Marsala&quot; to products from the Marsala area.

While unfortified wine is also produced in the Marsala region, it does not qualify for the Marsala DOC.

==History==
Marsala fortified wine was probably first popularized outside Sicily by the Liverpool merchant John Woodhouse In 1773, he landed at the port of Marsala and discovered the local wine produced in the region, which was aged in wooden casks and tasted similar to Spanish and Portuguese fortified wines then popular in England. Fortified Marsala was, and is, made using a process called &quot;in perpetuum&quot;, which is similar to the &quot;solera&quot; system used to produce Sherry in Jerez, Spain.

Woodhouse recognized that the &quot;in perpetuum&quot; process raised the alcohol level and alcoholic taste of this wine while also preserving these characteristics during long-distance sea travel. Woodhouse further believed that fortified Marsala would be popular in England. Marsala indeed proved so successful that Woodhouse returned to Sicily and, in 1796, began its mass production and commercialization. In 1806, it was Benjamin Ingham (1784–1861), arriving in Sicily from Leeds, who opened new markets for Marsala in Europe and the Americas. Founded by Benjamin Ingham and later run by Joseph Whitaker and William Ingham Whitaker. Joseph and his brother William Ingham Whitaker inherited vast vineyards and his great grandfather Ingham&#x27;s banking empire.

In 1833, the entrepreneur Vincenzo Florio, a Calabrese by birth and Palermitano by adoption, bought up great swathes of land between the two largest established Marsala producers and set to making his own vintage with even more exclusive range of grape. Florio purchased Woodhouse&#x27;s firm, among others, in the late nineteenth century and consolidated the Marsala wine industry. Florio and Pellegrino remain the leading producers of Marsala today.

==Characteristics and types==

Marsala is produced using the Grillo, Inzolia, Catarratto and Damaschino white grape varietals, among others.

Marsala contains about 15–20% alcohol by volume. Different Marsala wines are classified according to their color, sweetness, and duration of their ageing. The three levels of sweetness are &quot;secco&quot; (with a maximum of 40 grams of residual sugar per liter), &quot;semisecco&quot; (41–100 g/L), and &quot;sweet&quot; (over 100 g/L). The color and ageing classifications are as follows:
* &quot;Ambra&quot; has an amber colour. The coloring comes from the &quot;mosto cotto&quot; sweetener added to the wine
* &quot;Oro&quot; has a golden colour
* &quot;Rubino&quot; has a ruby colour, made from red grape varieties such as Perricone, Nero d&#x27;Avola and Nerello Mascalese
* &quot;Fine&quot; is aged at least one year
* &quot;Superiore&quot; is aged at least two years
* &quot;Superiore Riserva&quot; is aged at least four years
* &quot;Vergine&quot; and/or &quot;Soleras&quot; is aged at least five years
* &quot;Vergine&quot; and/or &quot;Soleras Stravecchio&quot; and &quot;Vergine&quot; and/or &quot; Soleras Riserva&quot; is aged at least ten years

Marsala wine was traditionally served as an aperitif between the first and second courses of a meal. Contemporary diners will serve its drier versions chilled with Parmesan (stravecchio), Gorgonzola, Roquefort, and other spicy cheeses, with fruits or pastries, and the sweeter at room temperature as a dessert wine. Marsala is sometimes discussed with another Sicilian wine, &quot;Passito di Pantelleria&quot; (Pantelleria Island&#x27;s raisin wine).

==In cooking==
Marsala wine is frequently used in cooking, and is especially prevalent in dishes served in Italian restaurants in the United States.

Dry Marsala wine is used in savory cooking. A typical savory Marsala sauce, for example, involves reducing the wine almost to a syrup with onions or shallots, then adding mushrooms and herbs. One of the most popular Marsala recipes is chicken marsala, in which flour-coated pounded chicken breast halves are braised in a mixture of Marsala, butter, olive oil, mushrooms, and spices. Marsala is also used in some risotto recipes.

Sweet Marsala wine is used to produce rich Italian desserts such as &quot;zabaione&quot;, tiramisu and shortcake.

<doc id="45100" wikidata="Q174009" url="?curid=45100" title="Hermione Granger">
<text>Hermione Granger ( ) is a fictional character in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series of novels by J. K. Rowling. She first appeared in &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; (1997), as a first-year student on her way to Hogwarts. She becomes friends with Harry Potter and Ron Weasley after they save her from a troll in the girls&#x27; bathroom. Hermione often uses her quick wit, deft recall, and encyclopaedic knowledge to help her friends in perilous situations. Rowling has stated that Hermione resembles herself as a young girl, with her insecurity and fear of failure.

Hermione has been immensely popular. The version of the character portrayed by Emma Watson in all eight &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films was voted the best female character of all time in a 2016 poll of Hollywood professionals conducted by &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;.

== Creation and development ==
Rowling has described Hermione as a strong female character who is bright, logical, upright and good. Rowling was seen as a &quot;know-it-all&quot; in her youth, and she said Hermione is an exaggerated version of her younger self. She added that beneath Hermione&#x27;s studious exterior, she is insecure and afraid of failure, traits which are inspired by Rowling&#x27;s own youthful insecurity. According to Rowling, Hermione is the perfect expository character due to her encyclopaedic knowledge of the wizarding world. 

Rowling said that Hermione&#x27;s parents, two Muggle dentists, are somewhat bemused by their &quot;odd&quot; daughter, but are proud of her nonetheless. Rowling has called Luna Lovegood the &quot;anti-Hermione&quot; due to the differences between them.

Hermione&#x27;s first name was taken from a character in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;, though Rowling has said that the two characters have very little in common. Rowling said that Hermione&#x27;s parents are the type of people who would give their daughter an unusual name to prove their cleverness. Hermione&#x27;s original surname was &quot;Puckle&quot;, but Rowling ultimately felt the name did not suit her.

==Appearances==

=== Novels ===

==== &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; ====
Hermione is introduced in &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; (1997) when she meets Harry Potter and Ron Weasley on the Hogwarts Express. After mocking Ron for his inability to perform a spell, she proves how much she knows by declaring that she memorized all their school textbooks. At Hogwarts, Hermione annoys other students with her vast knowledge, and Harry and Ron consider her arrogant. They heartily dislike her until they rescue her from a troll; she is so thankful that she lies to protect them from punishment, thus winning their friendship. Later, Hermione&#x27;s knack for logic and her penchant for library research aid the trio in their quest to locate a magical object known as the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone. On their way to the Stone, Hermione solves a puzzle and defeats the dangerous Devil&#x27;s Snare plant.

Rowling said she resisted requests by her editor to remove the troll scene. She explained later, &quot;Hermione [is] so very arrogant and annoying in the early part of &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; that I really felt it needed something (literally) huge to bring her together with Harry and Ron.&quot;

==== &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; ====
In &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; (1998), Hermione develops a liking for Gilderoy Lockhart, the new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor. During a confrontation between the Gryffindor and Slytherin Quidditch teams, a brawl nearly ensues after Draco Malfoy calls her a &quot;Mudblood&quot;, an insulting term for a Muggle-born wizard. Hermione concocts a Polyjuice Potion so she, Harry and Ron can infiltrate the Slytherin dormitory and collect information about the Heir of Slytherin. The boys drink the potion and take on the appearance of Malfoy&#x27;s friends, but Hermione, having used an improper ingredient in her vial of potion, ends up looking like a cat and cannot join the mission. When a basilisk escapes from the Chamber of Secrets, Hermione successfully identifies it through library research, but is Petrified by its gaze. Though she lies incapacitated in the hospital wing, the information she found aids Harry and Ron in their quest to solve the mystery of the Chamber. Hermione is revived after Harry kills the basilisk, but she is distraught to learn that all end-of-year exams have been cancelled.

==== &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; ====
In &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; (1999), Hermione buys a cat named Crookshanks, who takes to chasing Ron&#x27;s pet rat, Scabbers. Before the start of term, McGonagall secretly gives Hermione a Time-Turner, a device which lets her travel through time to handle her busy class schedule. During the school year, tension arises between Hermione and her two best friends. Harry becomes furious with her because she told McGonagall that he got a Firebolt racing broom, which was then confiscated to be inspected for traces of dark magic. Ron is angry at her because he believes Crookshanks was responsible for Scabbers&#x27; disappearance, although Hermione maintains that Crookshanks is not to blame. Later, Hermione uses the Time-Turner to help Harry rescue Sirius Black and the hippogriff Buckbeak.

==== &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; ====
Hermione is disturbed by the way house-elves are treated in &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; (2000). She establishes the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare (SPEW) to lobby for their rights. When students from other schools of magic visit Hogwarts for the Triwizard Tournament, Hermione is asked to the Yule Ball by the Bulgarian Quidditch star Viktor Krum of Durmstrang. She later gets into a heated argument with Ron after he accuses her of &quot;fraternising with the enemy&quot;. She supports Harry throughout the Triwizard Tournament, helping him prepare for each task. After the second task, Krum asks her to visit him in Bulgaria over the summer, but she politely declines. Near the end of the term, Hermione takes action against Rita Skeeter, a tabloid journalist and unregistered Animagus who published defamatory material about Hermione, Harry, and Hagrid.

==== &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot; ====
In &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot; (2003), Hermione becomes a Gryffindor prefect. Her new friendship with Luna Lovegood has a rocky start after Hermione criticises &quot;The Quibbler&quot;, a periodical published by Luna&#x27;s father. When the &quot;Daily Prophet&quot; alleges that Harry fabricated the story of Voldemort&#x27;s return, Hermione defends Harry to fellow students. She also bickers frequently with Ron. After the Ministry of Magic decrees that Hogwarts students will not be taught practical defensive magic, Hermione proposes that Harry should instruct students in defensive spells. Many students are interested in the secret practice group, which they call Dumbledore&#x27;s Army. Near the end of the novel, Hermione is involved in a battle at the Department of Mysteries. She is seriously injured by the Death Eater Antonin Dolohov, but makes a full recovery.

==== &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot; ====
The new Potions professor Horace Slughorn invites Hermione to join his exclusive &quot;Slug Club&quot; in &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot; (2005). During tryouts for the Gryffindor Quidditch team, Hermione helps Ron retain his position as keeper by sabotaging his rival, Cormac McLaggen. Hermione&#x27;s romantic feelings for Ron continue to grow, and she invites him to Slughorn&#x27;s Christmas party. Ron, however, has become romantically involved with Lavender Brown. Hermione feuds with Ron until he suffers a near-fatal poisoning, which frightens her enough to reconcile with him. After Dumbledore&#x27;s death, Hermione and Ron both vow to stay by Harry&#x27;s side regardless of what happens.

==== &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot; ====
Hermione accompanies Harry and Ron on the quest to destroy Voldemort&#x27;s remaining Horcruxes in &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot; (2007). Before leaving home, she ensures the safety of her parents by placing a false memory charm on them, which causes them to believe they are Wendell and Monica Wilkins. She prepares for their journey by filling an enchanted purse with things they will need. She also inherits Dumbledore&#x27;s copy of &quot;The Tales of Beedle the Bard&quot;, which allows her to discover secrets about the Deathly Hallows. When Hermione and Harry encounter Voldemort and his snake Nagini in Godric&#x27;s Hollow, Hermione casts a spell which saves her and Harry but which breaks Harry&#x27;s wand.

When Hermione, Harry and Ron are caught by Snatchers, Hermione temporarily conceals Harry&#x27;s identity by disfiguring his face with a Stinging Jinx. She tries to pass herself off as a half-blood to avoid persecution, but she and her friends are recognised and taken to Malfoy Manor. Bellatrix Lestrange tortures Hermione with the Cruciatus Curse and demands to know how the trio obtained the Sword of Gryffindor. Hermione, Harry, Ron and the other prisoners being held in Malfoy Manor are eventually rescued by the house-elf Dobby. Later, Hermione impersonates Bellatrix using Polyjuice Potion in order to steal a Horcrux from Gringotts. She, Harry, and Ron fight in the Battle of Hogwarts, during which Hermione destroys the Horcrux with a basilisk fang. Hermione and Ron share their first kiss during the battle.

In the novel&#x27;s epilogue, which is set nineteen years after Voldemort&#x27;s death, Hermione and Ron are sending their daughter Rose Granger-Weasley off to her first year at Hogwarts. They also have a younger son named Hugo. Although the epilogue does not state that Hermione and Ron are married, news articles published after the release of &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot; refer to Hermione as Ron&#x27;s wife.

=== &quot;Harry Potter and the Cursed Child&quot; ===
&quot;Harry Potter and the Cursed Child&quot; is a play written by Jack Thorne from a story by Thorne, J. K. Rowling and John Tiffany. In the play, which takes place nineteen years after the events of &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;, Hermione is the Minister for Magic. She is played by the Eswatini-born actress Noma Dumezweni, known for her performances in &quot;Linda&quot;, &quot;A Raisin in the Sun&quot; and &quot;A Human Being Died That Night&quot;. Dumezweni described the role as a privilege and a responsibility. The casting of a black actress led to criticism on social media, which Rowling dismissed as racism. She asserted that the novels never explicitly establish Hermione&#x27;s race or skin colour. Dumezweni called the backlash &quot;unimaginative&quot; and said that many actors and actresses are glad she is portraying Hermione because it allows them to see &quot;a version of themselves&quot; on stage.

&quot;The Independent&quot; praised Dumezweni&#x27;s portrayal, writing that she &quot;did a tremendous job&quot;. Dumezweni received the 2017 Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for her performance.

=== Film adaptations ===
Emma Watson portrays Hermione in all eight of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film adaptations. Casting agents for &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; (2001) found the nine-year-old Watson through her Oxford theatre teacher. She had acted in school plays, but had no film acting experience. Although Watson had to audition a total of eight times before earning the role, J. K. Rowling supported her casting after her first screen test. Prior to casting Watson, the filmmakers considered Hatty Jones for the role. Jones had previous film acting experience in the 1998 film adaptation of the children&#x27;s book series &quot;Madeline&quot;.

When filming &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot; (2002), Watson did not believe she was similar to her character. However, she later decided that Hermione is an exceptional role model for girls. In 2007, Watson said:

During production of &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot; (2007), Watson was uncertain about returning for the next film. She cited the long production schedule, attention from the public and a &quot;lack of freedom&quot; as reasons for not reprising her role. She eventually decided to return, saying that she could not bear to see anyone else play Hermione. Steve Kloves, who wrote the screenplay adaptations for seven of the eight films, revealed in a 2003 interview that Hermione is his favourite character. He said, &quot;There&#x27;s something about her fierce intellect coupled with a complete lack of understanding of how she affects people ... that I just find charming and irresistible to write.&quot;

==Characterisation==
===Outward appearance===
In the novels, Hermione is described as having bushy brown hair, brown eyes and large front teeth. In &quot;Goblet of Fire,&quot; Madam Pomfrey shrinks her teeth to a smaller size. In the film adaptation of &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;, Emma Watson wore large fake teeth for one scene. She did not wear them for subsequent films because they made it difficult for her to speak.

===Personality===
Hermione&#x27;s most prominent features include her prodigious intellect and cleverness. She is levelheaded, book-smart, and very logical. Throughout the series, Hermione uses the skills of a librarian and teacher to gather the information needed to defeat Voldemort. When in doubt, she always turns to the school library. She is often bossy yet unfailingly dutiful and loyal to her friends—a person who can always be counted on. Rowling said that Hermione &quot;never strays off the path; she always keeps her attention focused on the job that must be done&quot;. Despite Hermione&#x27;s intelligence and bossy attitude, Rowling says Hermione has &quot;quite a lot of vulnerability in her personality&quot;, as well as a &quot;sense of insecurity underneath&quot;, feels, &quot;utterly inadequate... and to compensate, she tries and strives to be the best at everything at school, projecting a confidence that irritates people.&quot; During her DADA exam at the end of &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;, Hermione reveals that her biggest fear is failure after a Boggart takes the form of Professor McGonagall and tells her that she has failed all her exams.

After the final novel was released, Rowling stated that Hermione&#x27;s career in the Ministry was to fight for the rights of the oppressed and disenfranchised (such as House-elves or Muggle-borns). Hermione is also very protective of her friends and values them so much that Rowling has suggested that, if Hermione looked in the Mirror of Erised, she would see Harry, Ron, and herself alive and Voldemort defeated. Hermione also learns to ignore what bullies such as Draco Malfoy say to her, often preventing Harry and Ron from retaliating and thinking of some way to outsmart him. She accepts her status as a Muggle-born, and says in &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot; that she is &quot;a Mudblood and proud of it&quot;.

=== Magical abilities and skills ===
Hermione is portrayed during the novel series as an exceptionally talented witch. Rowling has said that Hermione is a &quot;borderline genius&quot;. She is the highest-performing student in her year at Hogwarts and is often the first student to master a new spell or charm introduced in her classes. In &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot;, she casts a Protean Charm, which is a type of magic usually taught to older students. She is also the first one of her age to be able to cast non-verbal spells. Hermione is a competent duellist – Rowling has stated that during the first three novels Hermione could have beaten Harry in any magical duel, but by the fourth book Harry has become so good at DADA that he would have defeated Hermione. Hermione does not perform as well in subjects that are not learned through books or formal training, as broom flying does not come as naturally to her in her first year as it does for Harry, and she shows no affinity for Divination, which she drops from her third-year studies. She is also not particularly skilled at Wizard&#x27;s Chess.

Hermione&#x27;s Patronus is an otter, which is Rowling&#x27;s favourite animal.

==Reception==
In the book &quot;The Ivory Tower and Harry Potter,&quot; Eliza T. Dresang discusses Hermione&#x27;s role in the series and its relation to feminist debates. The chapter begins with an analysis of Hermione&#x27;s name and the role of previous characters with the same name in mythology and fiction, and the heritage Hermione has inherited from these characters due to her name. Dresang also emphasises Hermione&#x27;s parallelism with Rowling herself and how, as Hermione has some attributes from Rowling herself, she must be a strong character.

The chapter also points out that, despite being born to Muggle parents, Hermione&#x27;s magical abilities are innate. Her &quot;compulsion for study&quot; helps both the character&#x27;s development, which makes Hermione &quot;a prime example that information brings power&quot;, and the plot of the series, as her knowledge of the wizard world is often used to &quot;save the day&quot;. Dresang states that &quot;Harry and Ron are more dependent on Hermione than she is on them.&quot; However, she adds that Hermione&#x27;s &quot;hysteria and crying happen far too often to be considered a believable part of the development of Hermione&#x27;s character and are quite out of line with her core role in the book.&quot;

In his review of &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;, Brian Linder of &quot;IGN&quot; wrote, &quot;[F]rom Hermione Granger&#x27;s perfect introduction to her final scene, Watson is better than I could have possibly imagined. She steals the show.&quot; In another &quot;IGN&quot; article, Linder and Steve Head said that Watson&#x27;s &quot;cute and astute portrayal of Hermione has already become a favorite among fans.&quot; &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; called her performance admirable. Watson was nominated for five awards for her performance in &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;, winning the Young Artist Award for Leading Young Actress. She was also chosen as one of Entertainment Weekly&#x27;s Breakout Performers of 2001.

UGO Networks listed Hermione as one of their best heroes of all time, saying, &quot;Most of us can probably recall having a classmate like Hermione when we were in grammar school&quot;—one who &quot;can at first be a little off-putting, but once you get to know her, she&#x27;s not a bad chick to have on your side&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; also listed Hermione as their second top &quot;Harry Potter&quot; character, praising her character development. In 2016 &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; did a poll of Hollywood professionals, including actors, writers and directors, into their favourite female characters of all time; Hermione topped the poll.

Philip Nel of Kansas State University notes that &quot;Rowling, who worked for Amnesty International, evokes her social activism through Hermione&#x27;s passion for oppressed elves and the formation of her &#x27;Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare&#x27;&quot;. Scholars such as Brycchan Carey have praised the books&#x27; abolitionist sentiments, viewing Hermione&#x27;s Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare as a model for younger readers&#x27; political engagement.

However, in an analysis for &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot;, Rowland Manthrope states that &quot;seven books on, we still only know her as swottish, sensible Hermione—a caricature, not a character.&quot;

==In popular culture==
Hermione features in the &quot;Harry Bladder&quot; sketches in &quot;All That&quot;, where she appears as Herheiny and is played by Lisa Foiles. &quot;The Wedge&quot;, an Australian sketch comedy, parodies Hermione and Harry in love on a &quot;Cooking With...&quot; show before being caught by Snape.

Hermione is the focus of the fan-created web-series, &quot;Hermione Granger and the Quarter Life Crisis&quot;.

<doc id="45104" wikidata="Q170859" url="?curid=45104" title="Pope Nicholas III">
<text>Pope Nicholas III (; 1225 – 22 August 1280), born Giovanni Gaetano Orsini, was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 25 November 1277 to his death on 22 August 1280.

He was a Roman nobleman who had served under eight popes, been made Cardinal-Deacon of &quot;St. Nicola in Carcere Tulliano&quot; by Pope Innocent IV (1243–1254), protector of the Franciscans by Pope Alexander IV (1254–1261), inquisitor-general by Pope Urban IV (1261–64), and succeeded Pope John XXI (1276–1277) after a six-month vacancy in the Holy See resolved in the papal election of 1277, largely through family influence.

== Personal life==
The future pope, Giovanni Gaetano Orsini, was born in Rome, a member of the prominent Orsini family of Italy, the eldest son of Roman nobleman Matteo Rosso Orsini by his first wife, Perna Caetani. His father was Lord of Vicovaro, Licenza, Cantalupo, Roccagiovine, Galera, Fornello, Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo di Tivoli, Nettuno, Civitella, Bomarzo, San Polo and Castelfoglia, of Nerola from 1235; Lord of Mugnano, Santangelo and Monterotondo; Senator of Rome 1241–1243. His brother Giordano was named Cardinal Deacon of San Eustachio by Nicholas III on 12 March 1278. His brother Gentile became Lord of Mugnano, Penna, Nettuno and Pitigliano. Another brother, Matteo Rosso of Montegiordano, was Senator of Rome (probably) in 1279, War Captain of Todi, and Podestà of Siena in 1281. There were five other younger brothers and two sisters.

The Orsini family had already produced several popes: Stephen II (752–757), Paul I (757–767) and Celestine III (1191–1198).

He did not, as some scholars used to think, study at Paris—though his nephew did. His career shows no indication that he was a legal professional or a theologian. He never became a priest, until he became pope in 1277.

==Cardinalate==

Giovanni Gaetano Orsini was one of a dozen men created a cardinal by Pope Innocent IV (Sinibaldo Fieschi) in his first Consistory for the creation of cardinals, on Saturday, May 28, 1244, and was assigned the Deaconry of San Nicola in Carcere. He was a Canon and Prebendary of York, and also of Soissons and Laon. In the summer of 1244, he was one of five cardinals who fled to Genoa with Pope Innocent IV. He was at Lyons, and was present in June and July for the Ecumenical Council of Lyons. Cardinal Orsini and the Curia did not return to Italy until May 1251—after the death of Emperor Frederick II Hohenstaufen. After spending the summer in Genoa, Milan and Brescia, they finally reached Perugia in November 1251, where the Papal Court resided continuously until April 1253.

The Curia returned to Rome in mid-October, where Pope and Curia resided continually until the end of April, 1254. In May they went on pilgrimage to Assisi, then visited Anagni, where the Court stayed from June until the second week in October, when they went off in pursuit of Manfred, Hohenstaufen regent of the Kingdom of Sicily. At the beginning of December, the Battle of Foggia took place, and the papal army was routed. Innocent IV died in Naples, where he had taken refuge, on 7 December 1254, and the meeting to elect his successor was therefore held in Naples in the palace in which he had died. Voting began on Friday, 11 December, with ten of the twelve cardinals present, but no candidate received the required votes. But on Saturday, 12 December, Cardinal Rinaldo dei Conti di Segni, the nephew of Pope Gregory IX, who had a reputation of a conciliator, was elected pope. He chose to be called Alexander IV and was crowned on Sunday, December 20, 1254, in the Cathedral of Naples. As for Cardinal Giovanni Gaetano Orsini, in his first eleven and a half years as a cardinal, he had only spent six months in the city of Rome. A peripatetic Curia had its disadvantages.

Pope Alexander IV and the Curia continued to live in Naples, until the first week of June 1255 when they returned to Anagni, and it was not until mid-November that the Pope was back in Rome. There the Curia stayed until the end of May, 1256, when it was off to Anagni for the summer, until the beginning of December. The problem was that Rome was in the hands of Senator Brancaleone degli Andalo, Count of Casalecchio, since 1252, and the Ghibbelines and Alexander was repeatedly driven out by unruly mobs. Rome was home again until the end of May, 1257, until the summer vacation at Viterbo began. The vacation lasted until the end of October, 1258, when the Court visited Anagni again; they stayed until the beginning of November, 1260. The Pope then was able to reside at the Lateran until the first week of May, 1261, when the Court was off to Viterbo again. Alexander IV died at Viterbo on 25 May 1261. Nineteen months were spent in Rome, out of a total of seventy-eight. Alexander had created no new cardinals, and so the Electoral meeting following his death had only eight participants. The Election was a long-drawn-out one, lasting from 25 May to 29 August 1261. Unable to agree on one of themselves, the Cardinals chose Jacques Pantaléon, the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, who, since 1255, was Papal Legate with the Crusade in the Holy Land. He became Pope Urban IV, and was crowned at Viterbo on 4 September 1261.

Cardinal Orsini was named General Inquisitor by Urban IV on November 2, 1262, the first known Grand Inquisitor.

Cardinal Orsini attended the first Conclave of 1268–1271, and was one of the cardinals who signed the letter of complaint against the authorities and people of Viterbo for their treatment of the cardinals and the Curia. He was one of the six cardinals who were chosen by the rest of the Sacred College on September 1, 1271, to select a compromise candidate for election as pope. He was therefore instrumental in bringing to the papal throne the Archdeacon of Liège, Teobaldo Visconti, who was not a cardinal, and who was not even in Italy, but in the Holy Land on crusade. He traveled with the Curia to France in 1273, and was present at the Ecumenical Council of Lyons. He was not one of the cardinals in the suite of Pope Gregory X when he left Lyons in 1275 to return to Rome, nor was he at Arezzo where the Pope died on 10 January 1276, before reaching the city. He did not attend the first conclave which began on 20 January 1276, and concluded the next day with the election of Peter of Tarantaise, who became Pope Innocent V. Pope Innocent V (Peter of Tarantaise) died in Rome at the Lateran, on 22 June 22, 1276.

The second Conclave of 1276 began, therefore, according to the rules set down by Pope Gregory X, on July 2. Thirteen cardinals were present, including Giovanni Gaetano Orsini. King Charles I of Sicily acted as the Governor of the Conclave, in which position he is said to have been rigorous, but understandably partisan in favor of the French faction. Cardinal Ottobono Fieschi of Genoa was elected on July 11 and chose the name Pope Adrian V. He lived only thirty-nine days longer, dying at Viterbo, where he had gone to meet King Rudolf and avoid the summer heat of Rome. According to Bernardus Guidonis, he was never ordained priest, consecrated bishop or crowned pope (&quot;nondum promotus in sacerdotem nec coronatus nec consecratus&quot;). His one memorable act was to suspend the Constitution of Gregory X &quot;Ubi periculum&quot; which regulated conclaves. He intended, on the advice of his cardinals, to improve Gregory&#x27;s regulations. Cardinal Orsini was present at the discussion and decision. Shortly after his accession, moreover, Pope Adrian V had wanted King Charles I of Sicily to come to Viterbo to carry out the usual fealty, and sent the Suburbicarian Bishop of Sabina (Bertrand de Saint Martin); Cardinal Giovanni (Orsini), Cardinal Deacon of Saint Nicholas in Carcere Tulliano; and Cardinal Giacomo (Savelli), Cardinal Deacon of Santa Maria in Cosmedin, to effect his wishes. Charles arrived in Viterbo from Rome on July 24. Unfortunately, Pope Adrian died, on August 18, leaving his negotiations with King Charles unfinished.

The third Conclave of 1276 began at the beginning of September in Viterbo, where Adrian V had died. The opening ceremonies, which should have taken place on August 29, had to be delayed for several days because of the riotous behavior of the people of Viterbo. Since Pope Adrian had created no new cardinals, the number of cardinals was twelve; Cardinal Simon de Brion was still in France, serving as Papal Legate. Once the tumults had been put down, however, the cardinals did their business quickly. On September 8, 1276, the senior Cardinal-Bishop, Peter Julian of Lisbon, was elected on the first ballot. He chose to be called John XXI, and on September 20 he was crowned at the Cathedral of San Lorenzo in Viterbo by Cardinal Giovanni Caetano Orsini. Since John XXI was already a bishop, there was no ordination or consecration necessary. He was the fourth pope of 1276. On 18 October, Cardinal Giovanni Gaetano Orsini was appointed Archpriest of St. Peter&#x27;s, in place of Cardinal Riccardo Annibaldi, who had recently died, and who may have been too ill to participate in the Conclave or the Coronation.

Pope Adrian V&#x27;s suspension of the regulations of Gregory X, however imperfect they may have been, was under attack. Some critics even claimed that the cardinals who vouched for the truth of the suspension, including Cardinal Peter Julian, were liars, or that the revocation was uncanonical. These were probably the same troublemakers in the Curia who had instigated the disturbances that delayed the Conclave. John XXI immediately struck back, on 30 September 1276, making it perfectly clear that the suspension had taken place and that it was valid. Ptolemy of Lucca states that the issue of this bull of revocation by John XXI was made at the suggestion of Cardinal Giovanni Caetano Orsini. The negotiations which Cardinal Giovanni Caetano had been engaged in with King Charles I were brought to a completion, and Charles swore his oath of fealty to Pope John on 7 October 1276. It appeared that his reign was going to be a successful one, when one day in mid-May 1277, while the Pope was in a new room which he had just had built in the Episcopal Palace in Viterbo, suddenly the roof caved in. There was nothing suspicious about this, since the palace had been under construction since 1268 and was still being worked on. The Pope was severely injured from the falling stones and timber. He lingered in pain for several days (three, or six), and died on 20 May 1277, exactly eight months after his coronation. He had named no cardinals.

Yet another Conclave took place in Viterbo, therefore, with seven cardinals in attendance. Cardinal Simon de Brion was still in France as papal legate. But this was not an easy conclave. Three of the electors belonged to the Angevin faction, and three opposed it. The only surviving Cardinal-Bishop, the Benedictine Bertrand de Saint Martin, wavered back and forth, providing little leadership. The Conclave therefore went on for more than five and a half months. Finally, on the Feast of S. Catherine, 25 November 1277, Cardinal Giovanni Gaetano Orsini was elected. He chose the name Nicholas III. The new pope set out immediately for Rome. He was ordained a priest on December 18, consecrated a bishop on December 19, and crowned on the Feast of S. Stephen, 26 December. His election portended serious difficulties, for he was not a candidate of King Charles of Sicily. Quite the contrary, he believed that King Charles had entirely too much influence in church affairs and in the operation of the Papal States.

== Activities as pope ==

=== Politics ===

The lands under direct papal rule were threatened by surrounding powers. In the second quarter of the 13th century, they were threatened by the expansionist policies of the Emperor Frederick II, who aimed to unite his inheritance in the south (Sicily and southern Italy) with his acquisition of the Holy Roman Empire in northern Italy. He spent a great deal of time and energy attempting to gain control over Lombardy and Tuscany, which brought him into direct conflict with the Papacy. Frederick was repeatedly excommunicated by one pope after another. In order to drive off the Hohenstaufen, the Papacy contrived a deal with the brother of Louis IX of France, Charles of Anjou, Count of Provence, who was invited to Italy to assume the crown of Sicily and be a counterweight against the Empire. He was too successful, however, and the Papacy found itself in the deadly embrace of the Angevins. Nicholas&#x27; prime goal was to loosen Charles I&#x27;s grip on the Papacy, Rome, and the lands of the Church.

Nicholas&#x27; pontificate, though brief, was marked by several important events. He greatly strengthened the papal position in Italy. On 1 October 1273, Rudolph I of Habsburg, the godson of Frederick II, had been elected King of Germany and King of the Romans. Pope Gregory X had recognized him as King, after some hard negotiation, but the imperial title and coronation were withheld. Pope Nicholas was willing to negotiate, but he refused to crown Rudolf as Emperor until Rudolph had acknowledged all the claims of the Church, including many that were quite dubious. The concordat with Rudolph I of Habsburg was concluded in May 1278. In it the city of Bologna, the Romagna, and the exarchate of Ravenna were guaranteed to the papacy. According to the chronographer Bartholomew of Lucca (Ptolemy of Lucca), he discussed with Rudolph, in general terms at least, the splitting the Holy Roman Empire into four separate kingdoms – Lombardy, Burgundy, Tuscia and Germany – where Rudolph&#x27;s kingdom would be made hereditary and he himself would be recognized as Holy Roman Emperor.

Nicholas III was even able to persuade King Charles I of Naples and Sicily to give up his position as Roman Senator in 1278, at the conclusion of ten years of tenure, as well as the position of Papal Vicar for Tuscany. In July 1278, Nicholas III issued an epoch-making constitution for the government of Rome, &quot;Fundamenta militantis&quot; which forbade foreigners from taking civil office. It depends for its justification not only on the biblical phrase, &quot;Tu es Petrus, et super hanc petram aedificabo ecclesiam meam&quot; (&quot;Matthew&quot; 16:18), but also on the forged Donations of Constantine.

=== Ecclesiastical ===
Nicholas&#x27; father had been a personal friend of Francis of Assisi, and he himself had to focus much of his attention on the Franciscan order. More than 165 of his bulls and letters address the subject. Most importantly, he issued the papal bull &quot;Exiit qui seminat&quot; on 14 August 1279, to settle the strife within the order between the parties of strict and relaxed observance.

He repaired the Lateran Palace and the Vatican at enormous cost, and erected a beautiful country house at Soriano nel Cimino near Viterbo, where he died of a cardiovascular event (sources differ on whether it was a heart attack or a stroke).

=== Nepotism ===
Nicholas III, though a man of learning noted for his strength of character, was known for his excessive nepotism. He elevated three of his closest relatives to the cardinalate and gave others important positions. This nepotism was lampooned both by Dante and in contemporary cartoons, depicting him in his fine robes with three &quot;little bears&quot; (&quot;orsetti&quot;, a pun on the family name) hanging on below.

=== Cardinals ===
Nicholas III created nine cardinals in one consistory celebrated on 12 March 1278:

* Ordonho Alvares, Archbishop of Braga – named Cardinal-Bishop of Frascati, † 21 December 1285.
* Bentivenga dei Bentivenghi, O.F.M., Bishop of Todi – named Cardinal-Bishop of Albano, † 25 March 1289.
* Latino Malabranca Orsini, O.P., nephew of Nicholas – named Cardinal-Bishop of Ostia e Velletri,† 10 August 1294
* Robert Kilwardby, O.P., Archbishop of Canterbury – named Cardinal-Bishop of Porto and S. Rufina, † 12 September 1279.
* Gerard de Lessines, Bishop of Auxerre – named cardinal-bishop of Palestrina, † 18 July 1278.
* Gerardo Bianchi – named Cardinal-Priest of SS. XII Apostoli, then cardinal-bishop of Sabina (12 April 1281), † 1 March 1302.
* Girolamo Masci, O.Min. – Minister General of the Franciscans. Named Cardinal-Priest of S. Pudenziana, then cardinal-bishop of Palestrina (12 April 1281) and Pope Nicholas IV (22 February 1288), † 4 April 1292
* Giordano Orsini, brother of Pope Nicholas III – named Cardinal-Deacon of S. Eustachio, † 8 September 1287.
* Giacomo Colonna – named Cardinal-Deacon of S. Maria in Via Lata; excommunicated and deposed on 10 May 1297, restored as Cardinal-Deacon without a title on 15 December 1305, † 14 August 1318.

Most of these new Cardinals were not of the French party, and among them were five members of religious orders. Two died before the next Conclave, which was to take place on the death of Nicholas III in 1280, and the rest had to be terrorized into voting for a candidate of Charles I of Sicily.

===Death===

Pope Nicholas III was stricken ill quite unexpectedly. The Curia was residing at the time in the city of Viterbo. Pope Nicholas was at his country retreat at Castro Soriano. According to the &quot;Chronicon Parmense&quot; he was suddenly deprived of consciousness and movement (&quot;privatus subito omni sensu et motu&quot;). Bartholomeus (Ptolemy) of Lucca says, &quot;subito factus apoplecticus, sine loquela moritur&quot; (&#x27;suddenly stricken with apoplexy, he died without speaking&#x27;). Nicholas was unable to make his confession, and died at his palace at Castro Soriano, in the diocese of Viterbo, on 22 August 1280. He had been pope for two years, eight months, and twenty-eight days. His remains were taken to Rome, where he was buried in the Vatican Basilica, in the Chapel of S. Nicholas. There was an alternative story circulating, as was frequently the case in the sudden deaths of medieval and renaissance popes—that the pope had been poisoned.

== Portrayal in &quot;The Inferno&quot; ==
Dante, in &quot;The Inferno&quot; (of the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;), talks briefly to Nicholas III, who was condemned to spend eternity in the Third Bolgia of the Eighth Circle of Hell, reserved for those who committed simony, the ecclesiastical crime of paying for offices or positions in the hierarchy of a church.

In Dante&#x27;s story, the Simoniacs are placed head-first in holes, flames burning on the soles of their feet (Canto XIX). Nicholas was the chief sinner in these pits, which is demonstrated by the height of the flames on his feet. At first he mistakes Dante for Pope Boniface VIII. When the confusion is cleared up, Nicholas informs Dante that he foresees the damnation (for simony) not only of Boniface VIII, but also Clement V, an even more corrupt pope.

<text>Agrigento (; or ) is a city on the southern coast of Sicily, Italy and capital of the province of Agrigento.

Founded around 582 BC by Greek colonists from Gela, Agrigento, then known as Akragas, was one of the leading cities during the golden age of Ancient Greece. The city flourished under Theron&#x27;s leadership in the 5th century BC, marked by ambitious public works and the construction of renowned temples.

Despite periods of dormancy during the Punic Wars, Agrigento emerged as one of Sicily&#x27;s largest cities in the Republican era. During the Principate, Agrigento&#x27;s strategic port and diverse economic ventures, including sulfur mining, trade and agriculture, sustained its importance throughout the high and late Empire. Economic prosperity persisted in the 3rd to 4th centuries AD, but excavations show decline in activity after the 7th century.

Agrigento is also the place of birth to several notable personalities, among which it is worth to mention Empedocles (5th century BC), the Ancient Greek pre-Socratic philosopher, who was a citizen of ancient &quot;Akragas&quot;, and Luigi Pirandello (1867–1936), dramatist and Nobel prize winner for literature,who was born at contrada &quot;u Càvusu&quot; in Agrigento.

Agrigento, included among the UNESCO world heritage sites in 1997, was named Italian capital of culture for 2025.

==History==

Akragas was founded on a plateau overlooking the sea, with two nearby rivers, the Hypsas and the Acragas, after which the settlement was originally named. A ridge, which offered a degree of natural fortification, links a hill to the north called Colle di Girgenti with another, called Rupe Atenea, to the east. According to Thucydides, it was founded around 582–580 BC by Greek colonists from Gela in eastern Sicily, with further colonists from Crete and Rhodes. The founders () of the new city were Aristonous and Pystilus. It was the last of the major Greek colonies in Sicily to be founded.

===Archaic period ===

The territory under Akragas&#x27;s control expanded to comprise the whole area between the Platani and the Salso, and reached deep into the Sicilian interior. Greek literary sources connect this expansion with military campaigns, but archaeological evidence indicates that this was a much longer-term process which reached its peak only in the early fifth century BC. Most other Greek settlements in Sicily experienced similar territorial expansion in this period. Excavations at a range of sites in this region inhabited by the indigenous Sican people, such as Monte Sabbucina, Gibil-Gabil, Vasallaggi, San Angelo Muxano, and Mussomeli, show signs of the adoption of Greek culture. It is disputed how much of this expansion was carried out by violence and how much by commerce and acculturation. The territorial expansion provided land for the Greek settlers to farm, native slaves to work these farms, and control of the overland route from Acragas to the city of Himera on the northern coast of Sicily. This was the main land route from the Straits of Sicily to the Tyrrhenian Sea and Acragas&#x27; control of it was a key factor in its economic prosperity in the sixth and fifth centuries BC, which became proverbial. Famously, Plato, upon seeing the living standard of the inhabitants, was said to have remarked that &quot;they build like they intend to live forever, yet eat like this is their last day.&quot; Perhaps as a result of this wealth, Acragas was one of the first communities in Sicily to begin minting its own coinage, around 520 BC.

Around 570 BC, the city came under the control of Phalaris, a semi-legendary figure, who was remembered as the archetypal tyrant, said to have killed his enemies by burning them alive inside a bronze bull. In the ancient literary sources, he is linked with the military campaigns of territorial expansion, but this is probably anachronistic. He ruled until around 550 BC. The political history of Acragas in the second half of the sixth century is unknown, except for the names of two leaders, Alcamenes and Alcander. Acragas also expanded westwards over the course of the sixth century BC, leading to a rivalry with Selinus, the next Greek city to the west. The Selinuntines founded the city of Heraclea Minoa at the mouth of the Platani river, halfway between the two settlements, in the mid-sixth century BC, but the Acragantines conquered it around 500 BC.

===Emmenid period===

Theron, a member of the Emmenid family, made himself tyrant of Acragas around 488 BC. He formed an alliance with Gelon, tyrant of Gela and Syracuse. Around 483 BC, Theron invaded and conquered Himera, Acragas&#x27; neighbour to the north. The tyrant of Himera, Terillus joined his son-in-law, Anaxilas of Rhegium, and the Selinuntines in calling on the Carthaginians to come and restore Terillus to power. The Carthaginians did invade in 480 BC, the first of the Greco-Punic Wars, but they were defeated by the combined forces of Theron and Gelon at the Battle of Himera. As a result, Acragas was affirmed in its control of the central portion of Sicily, an area of around 3,500 km2. A number of enormous construction projects were carried out in the Valle dei Templi at this time, including the Temple of Olympian Zeus, which was one of the largest Greek temples ever built, and the construction of a massive Kolymbethra reservoir. According to Diodorus Siculus, they were built in commemoration of the Battle of Himera, using the prisoners captured in the war as slave labour. Archaeological evidence indicates that the boom in monumental construction actually began before the battle, but continued in the period after it. A major reconstruction of the city walls on a monumental scale also took place in this period. Theron sent teams to compete in the Olympic games and other Panhellenic competitions in mainland Greece. Several poems by Pindar and Simonides commemorated victories by Theron and other Acragantines, which provide insights into Acragantine identity and ideology at this time. Greek literary sources generally praise Theron as a good tyrant, but accuse his son Thrasydaeus, who succeeded him in 472 BC, of violence and oppression. Shortly after Theron&#x27;s death, Hiero I of Syracuse (brother and successor of Gelon) invaded Acragas and overthrew Thrasydaeus. The literary sources say that Acragas then became a democracy, but in practice it seems to have been dominated by the civic aristocracy.

===Classical and Hellenistic periods===
The period after the fall of the Emmenids is not well-known. An oligarchic group called &quot;the thousand&quot; was in power for a few years in the mid-fifth century BC, but was overthrown – the literary tradition gives the philosopher Empedocles a decisive role in this revolution, but some modern scholars have doubted this. In 451 BC, Ducetius, leader of a Sicel state opposed to the expansion of Syracuse and other Greeks into the interior of Sicily, invaded Acragantine territory and conquered an outpost called Motyum. The Syracusans defeated and captured Ducetius in 450, but subsequently allowed him to go into exile. Outraged by this comparatively light punishment, the Acragantines went to war with Syracuse. They were defeated in a battle on the Salso river, which left Syracuse the pre-eminent power in eastern Sicily. The defeat was serious enough that Acragas ceased to mint coinage for a number of years.

Ancient sources considered Acragas to be a very large city at this time. Diodorus Siculus says that the population was 200,000 people, of which 20,000 were citizens. Diogenes Laertius put the population at an incredible 800,000. Some modern scholars have accepted Diodorus&#x27; numbers, but they seem to be far too high. Jos de Waele suggests a population of 16,000–18,000 citizens, while Franco de Angelis estimates a total population of around 30,000-40,000.

When Athens undertook the Sicilian Expedition against Syracuse from 415 to 413 BC, Acragas remained neutral. However, it was sacked by the Carthaginians in 406 BC. Acragas never fully recovered its former status, though it revived following the invasion of Timoleon in the late fourth century onwards and large-scale construction took place in the Hellenistic period. During the early 3rd century BC, a tyrant called Phintias declared himself king in Akragas, also controlling a variety of other cities. His kingdom was however not long-lived.

===Roman period===
The city was disputed between the Romans and the Carthaginians during the First Punic War. The Romans laid siege to the city in 262 BC and captured it after defeating a Carthaginian relief force in 261 BC and sold the population into slavery. Although the Carthaginians recaptured the city in 255 BC the final peace settlement gave Punic Sicily and with it Akragas to Rome. It suffered badly during the Second Punic War (218–201 BC) when both Rome and Carthage fought to control it. The Romans eventually captured Akragas in 210 BC and renamed it &quot;Agrigentum&quot;, although it remained a largely Greek-speaking community for centuries thereafter. It became prosperous again under Roman rule. In the 2nd century BC, Scipio Africanus Minor bestowed upon the city a statue of Apollo by Myron, housed in the Temple of Asclepius as a symbol of their alliance during the Third Punic War.

Cicero noted Agrigentum as a civitas decumana and socius, highlighting its loyal service in the Third Punic War. He ranked Agrigentum among Sicily&#x27;s largest cities, emphasizing its pivotal port and role in Roman governance, including hosting the governor&#x27;s assize circuit. Additionally, he mentioned a sizable population of Roman citizens coexisting harmoniously with the Greek populace, likely engaged in commerce linked to the port.

An inscription shows that the city was promoted to the status of colonia by Septimius Severus and renamed &quot;Colonia Septimia Augusta Agrigentorum.&quot;

A resilient Christian community endured into late antiquity, although archaeological evidence suggests a decline in activity after the 7th century, possibly due to disrupted trade routes following the Arab conquest of Carthage in AD 698.

===Middle Ages===
After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the city successively passed into the hands of the Vandalic Kingdom, the Ostrogothic Kingdom of Italy, and then the Byzantine Empire. During this period the inhabitants of Agrigentum largely abandoned the lower parts of the city and moved to the former acropolis, at the top of the hill. The reasons for this move are unclear but were probably related to the destructive coastal raids of the Saracens and other peoples around this time. In 828 AD the Saracens captured the diminished remnant of the city; the Arabic form of its name became () or ().

Following the Norman conquest of Sicily, the city changed its name to the Norman version &quot;Girgenti&quot;. In 1087, Norman Count Roger I established a Latin bishopric in the city. Normans built the Castello di Agrigento to control the area. The population declined during much of the medieval period but revived somewhat after the 18th century.

===Jewish History===
According to legend, the Jewish community of Agrigento is said to be ancient. The first record of Jews mentioned in Agrigento is when, under the pontificate of Gregory the Great, several Jews in Agrigento were converted to Christianity. The community is mentioned in the Cairo Geniza circa 1060. The Jewish presence in Agrigento did not survive the expulsion of the Jews in 1492, as at the time the territory was under Spanish rule.

===Modern period===

In 1860, as in the rest of Sicily, the inhabitants supported the arrival of Giuseppe Garibaldi during the Expedition of the Thousand (one of the most dramatic events of the Unification of Italy) which marked the end of Bourbon rule. In 1927, Benito Mussolini through the &quot;Decree Law n. 159, 12 July 1927&quot;, introduced the current Italianized version of the Latin name. The decision remains controversial as a symbol of Fascism and the eradication of local history. Following the suggestion of Andrea Camilleri, a Sicilian writer of Agrigentine origin, the historic city centre was renamed to the Sicilian name &quot;Girgenti&quot; in 2016. The city suffered a number of destructive bombing raids during World War II.

==Government==
==Economy==
Agrigento is a major tourist centre due to its archaeological legacy. It also serves as an agricultural centre for the surrounding region. Sulphur and potash were mined locally from Minoan times until the 1970s, and were exported worldwide from the nearby harbour of Porto Empedocle (named after the philosopher Empedocles, who lived in ancient Akragas). In 2010, the unemployment rate in Agrigento was 19.2%, almost twice the national average.

== Infrastructure and transport ==

=== Railways ===
In Agrigento there are three railway stations: the Agrigento Centrale station, the Agrigento Bassa station and the Tempio Vulcano station, managed by RFI. The tourist trains, organized by the FS Italiane Foundation, which run along the Temple Tourist Railway, touch all three stations: this service is active mainly in the summer months and connects the capital with the city of Porto Empedocle and the archaeological park. The ordinary railway service, however, involves only the Agrigento Centrale and Agrigento Bassa stations.

In December 2023, the new railway connection between the city of temples and the &quot;Falcone e Borsellino&quot; airport in Palermo was inaugurated. The Trenitalia regional train begins on Monday 11 December with its first service and, at the request of the Sicilian Region, 4 new daily services are operational which connect Agrigento to the Palermo airport in approximately 2 hours and 30 minutes.

==Main sights==

Ancient Akragas covers a huge area—much of which is still unexcavated today—but is exemplified by the famous &quot;Valle dei Templi&quot; (&quot;Valley of the Temples&quot;, a misnomer, as it is a ridge, rather than a valley). This comprises a large sacred area on the south side of the ancient city where seven monumental Greek temples in the Doric style were constructed during the 6th and 5th centuries BC. Now excavated and partially restored, they constitute some of the largest and best-preserved ancient Greek buildings outside of Greece itself. They are listed as a World Heritage Site.

The best-preserved of the temples are two very similar buildings traditionally attributed to the goddesses Hera and Concordia (though there is no evidence for this). The latter temple is remarkably intact, due to its having been converted into a Christian church in 597 AD. Both were constructed to a peripteral hexastyle design. The area around the Temple of Concordia was later re-used by early Christians as a catacomb, with tombs hewn out of the rocky cliffs and outcrops.

<text>Lord Voldemort ( , in the films) is a fictional character and the main antagonist in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series of novels by J. K. Rowling. He first appears in &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; (1997) and returns either in person or in flashbacks in each novel in the series except the third, &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;, in which he is only mentioned.

Voldemort, an anagrammatic sobriquet for his birth name Tom Marvolo Riddle, is the archenemy of Harry Potter, who according to a prophecy has &quot;the power to vanquish the Dark Lord&quot;. After killing Harry&#x27;s parents, Lily and James Potter, he attempts to murder the boy, but instead leaves him with a scar on his forehead in the shape of a lightning bolt. Nearly every witch or wizard dares not utter his name and refers to him instead with such monikers as &quot;You-Know-Who&quot;, &quot;He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named&quot;, or &quot;The Dark Lord&quot;. Voldemort&#x27;s obsession with blood purity signifies his aim to rid the wizarding world of Muggle (non-magical) heritage and to conquer both worlds, Muggle and wizarding, to achieve pure-blood dominance. Through his mother&#x27;s family, he is the last descendant of the wizard Salazar Slytherin, one of the four founders of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He is the leader of the Death Eaters, a group of wizards and witches dedicated to ridding the Wizarding World of Muggles and establishing Voldemort as its supreme ruler.

== Character development ==
In a 1999 interview, Rowling said Voldemort was invented as a nemesis for Harry Potter, and she intentionally did not flesh out Voldemort&#x27;s backstory at first. &quot;The basic idea [was that Harry] didn&#x27;t know he was a wizard ... And so then I kind of worked backwards from that position to find out how that could be, that he wouldn&#x27;t know what he was. ... When he was one year old, the most evil wizard for hundreds and hundreds of years attempted to kill him. He killed Harry&#x27;s parents, and then he tried to kill Harry—he tried to curse him. ... Harry has to find out, before we find out. And—so—but for some mysterious reason the curse didn&#x27;t work on Harry. So he&#x27;s left with this lightning bolt-shaped scar on his forehead and the curse rebounded upon the evil wizard, who has been in hiding ever since.&quot;

In the second book, Rowling establishes that Voldemort hates non-pure-blood wizards, despite being a half-blood himself. In a 2000 interview with the BBC, Rowling described Voldemort as a self-hating bully: &quot;Well I think it is often the case that the biggest bullies take what they know to be their own defects, as they see it, and they put them right on someone else and then they try and destroy the other and that&#x27;s what Voldemort does.&quot; In the same year, Rowling became more precise about Voldemort. She began to link him to real-life tyrants, describing him as &quot;a raging psychopath, devoid of the normal human responses to other people&#x27;s suffering&quot;. In 2004, though, Rowling said that she did not base Voldemort on any real person. In 2006, Rowling told an interviewer that Voldemort at his core has a human fear: the fear of death. She said: &quot;Voldemort&#x27;s fear is death, ignominious death. I mean, he regards death itself as ignominious. He thinks that it&#x27;s a shameful human weakness, as you know. His worst fear is death.&quot;

Throughout the series, Rowling establishes that Voldemort is so feared in the wizarding world that it is considered dangerous even to speak his name. Most characters in the novels refer to him as &quot;You-Know-Who&quot; or &quot;He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named&quot; rather than say his name aloud. In &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot;, a &quot;taboo&quot; spell is placed upon the name, such that Voldemort or his followers may trace anyone who utters it. By this means, his followers eventually find and capture Harry and his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. In the second book, Rowling reveals that &quot;I am Lord Voldemort&quot; is an anagram of the character&#x27;s birth name, Tom Marvolo Riddle (in translated editions of the book, his middle name or entire birth name is/are often changed in order to allow anagrams to be formed in other languages).

According to the author, Voldemort&#x27;s name is an invented word. The name &quot;Voldemort&quot; is derived from the French &quot;vol de mort&quot; which means &quot;flight of death&quot; or &quot;theft of death&quot;.

== Appearances ==
=== &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; ===
Voldemort makes his debut in &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;. In this story, Rowling introduces him as the Dark Lord who tried to kill Harry Potter because the boy was prophesied to destroy him. Voldemort murdered Harry&#x27;s parents, James and Lily, but as a result of his mother&#x27;s love and willingness to sacrifice herself for him, baby Harry survived when Voldemort tried to murder him with a Killing Curse. Voldemort was disembodied, and Harry was left with a mysterious, lightning bolt-shaped scar on his forehead as a result.

In the book, Voldemort unsuccessfully tries to regain his dissolved body by stealing the titular Philosopher&#x27;s Stone. To achieve his objective, Voldemort uses Professor Quirrell&#x27;s aid by latching onto the back of the latter&#x27;s head. However, at the climax of the book, Harry manages to prevent Voldemort from stealing the stone.

=== &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; ===
In the second instalment, &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot;, Rowling introduces Voldemort&#x27;s true identity, former Hogwarts pupil and Slytherin prefect Tom Marvolo Riddle, who appears as a manifestation of the Dark Lord&#x27;s teenage self that resides inside a magical diary found by Ginny Weasley. In this book, Ginny is written as a shy girl with a crush on Harry. Feeling anxious and lonely, she begins to write into the diary and shares her deepest fears with the sympathetic Tom. However, at the climax of the story, when the manifestation of Riddle rearranges the letters in his name to write &quot;I am Lord Voldemort&quot;, it is revealed that Tom and the Dark Lord are just one person and that he is a descendant of one of the school&#x27;s founders, Salazar Slytherin. Riddle states he has grown strong on Ginny&#x27;s fears and eventually possesses her, using her as a pawn to unlock the Chamber of Secrets, whence a basilisk is set free and petrifies several Hogwarts students. Harry defeats the manifestation of Riddle from the diary and the basilisk. In &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot;, Albus Dumbledore reveals to Harry that the diary was one of Voldemort&#x27;s Horcruxes.

=== &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; ===
Voldemort does not appear in the third book, &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;, either in person or as a magical manifestation. He is, however, heard when Harry passes out from the harsh effects of a Dementor. Towards the end of the story, Sybill Trelawney, the Divination professor, makes a rare genuine prophecy: &quot;The Dark Lord lies alone and friendless, abandoned by his followers. His servant has been chained these twelve years. Tonight, before midnight, the servant will break free and set out to rejoin his master. The Dark Lord will rise again with his servant&#x27;s aid, greater and more terrible than ever before.&quot; The servant is eventually revealed to be Peter Pettigrew, who, for the 12 years since Voldemort&#x27;s fall, has been disguised as Ron&#x27;s pet rat, Scabbers.

=== &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; ===
In &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; (2000), Voldemort reappears at the start and the climax of the book. Rowling lets many seemingly unrelated plot elements fall into order. It is revealed that Voldemort&#x27;s minion Barty Crouch Jr, disguised as Hogwarts professor Mad-Eye Moody, has manipulated the events of the Triwizard Tournament in Harry&#x27;s favour. Voldemort&#x27;s goal is to teleport Harry under Dumbledore&#x27;s watch as a reluctant participant to the Little Hangleton graveyard, where the Riddle family is buried. Harry is captured and, after Pettigrew uses Harry&#x27;s blood to fulfil a gruesome magical ritual, Voldemort regains his body and is restored to his full power. For the first time in the series, Rowling describes his appearance: &quot;tall and skeletally thin&quot;, with a face &quot;whiter than a skull, with wide, livid scarlet eyes and a nose that was as flat as a snake&#x27;s with slits for nostrils&quot;. Rowling writes that his &quot;hands were like large, pale spiders; his long white fingers caressed his own chest, his arms, his face; the red eyes, whose pupils were slits, like a cat&#x27;s, gleamed still more brightly through the darkness&quot;. It is revealed that with Pettigrew&#x27;s help, Voldemort had created a small, rudimentary body, corporeal enough to travel and perform magic, and formulated a plan to restore his own body by capturing Harry. A portion of the plan had been overheard by Frank Bryce, a gardener, whom Voldemort then killed. Voldemort then completes his plan and returns to life in his full body as a result of the ritual with Harry&#x27;s blood. He then summons his Death Eaters to the graveyard to witness the death of Harry as he challenges Harry to a duel. However, when Voldemort duels Harry, their wands become magically locked together due to the twin phoenix feather cores of the wands. Because of a phenomenon later revealed as Priori Incantatem, ghost-like manifestations of Voldemort&#x27;s most recent victims (including Harry&#x27;s parents) then appear and distract Voldemort, allowing Harry just enough time to escape via Portkey with the body of fellow-student, Cedric Diggory, who was murdered by Pettigrew on Voldemort&#x27;s orders.

=== &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot; ===
Voldemort returns near the end of &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot; (2003). He engineers a plot to free Bellatrix Lestrange and other Death Eaters from Azkaban and then embarks on a scheme to retrieve the full record of a prophecy stored in the Department of Mysteries regarding Harry and himself. He sends a group of Death Eaters to retrieve the prophecy, where the Order of the Phoenix meets them. All but Bellatrix are captured, and Voldemort engages in a ferocious duel with Dumbledore. When Dumbledore gets the upper hand, Voldemort attempts to possess Harry but finds that he cannot; Harry is too full of that which Voldemort finds incomprehensible, and which he detests as weakness: love. Sensing that Dumbledore could win, Voldemort disapparates, but not before the Minister for Magic sees him in person, making his return to life public knowledge in the next book.

=== &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot; ===
In &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot; (2003), Voldemort continues his rise to power. He murders Amelia Bones of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and begins to target members of the Order of the Phoenix. In a series of flashbacks, it is revealed that Voldemort was the son of the witch Merope Gaunt and a Muggle named Tom Riddle. Riddle abandoned Merope before their child&#x27;s birth, soon after which Merope died. After living in an orphanage, young Riddle met Dumbledore, who told him he was a wizard and arranged for him to attend Hogwarts. Riddle was outwardly a model student, but inwardly took sadistic pleasure in using his powers to harm and control people. He eventually murdered his father and grandparents as revenge for abandoning him. The book also discusses Riddle&#x27;s hatred of Muggles, his obsession with Horcruxes, and his desire to split his soul to achieve immortality. Rowling stated that Voldemort&#x27;s conception under the influence of a love potion symbolises the coercive circumstances under which he was brought into the world.

In the main plot of the book, Voldemort&#x27;s next step is to engineer an assault on Hogwarts, and to kill Dumbledore. This is accomplished by Draco Malfoy, who arranges transportation of Death Eaters into Hogwarts by a pair of Vanishing Cabinets, which bypass the extensive protective enchantments placed around the school. The cabinets allow Voldemort&#x27;s Death Eaters to enter Hogwarts, where battle commences and Dumbledore is cornered. Hogwarts professor (and re-doubled agent) Severus Snape uses the Killing Curse against Dumbledore when Draco could not force himself to do so.

=== &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot; ===
In &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot; (2007), Voldemort furthers his quest for ultimate power. He disposes of the Minister for Magic and replaces him with Pius Thicknesse, who is under the Imperius Curse. Establishing a totalitarian police state, he has Muggle-borns persecuted and arrested for &quot;stealing magic&quot; from the &quot;pure blood&quot; wizards. After failing to kill Harry with Draco&#x27;s father Lucius Malfoy&#x27;s borrowed wand (to avoid the effect of Priori Incantatem), he goes on a murderous search for the Elder Wand, the most powerful wand ever created, seeing it as the weapon he needs to overcome Harry&#x27;s wand and make him truly invincible. His journey takes him to Nurmengard, the prison where Gellert Grindelwald is kept, and he kills Grindelwald as well. He finally locates the Elder Wand and steals it from Dumbledore&#x27;s tomb.

Later, Voldemort finds out that Harry and his friends are hunting and destroying his Horcruxes when informed of their heist on the Lestranges&#x27; vault at Gringotts in search for Hufflepuff&#x27;s Cup. After offering the occupants of Hogwarts mercy if they give up Harry, he assembles a large army and launches an invasion of the castle, where Harry is searching for Ravenclaw&#x27;s Diadem. Voldemort orders his pet snake Nagini to execute Snape, believing it would make him the true master of the Elder Wand, since Snape killed Dumbledore. He then calls an hour&#x27;s armistice, in exchange for Harry. When Harry willingly walks into Voldemort&#x27;s camp in the Forbidden Forest, Voldemort strikes him down with the Elder Wand. However, the use of Harry&#x27;s blood to resurrect Voldemort&#x27;s body proves to be a major setback: while Harry&#x27;s blood runs in Voldemort&#x27;s veins, Harry cannot be killed as his mother&#x27;s protection lives on now in Voldemort too. Instead, Voldemort unknowingly destroys the part of his own soul that resides in Harry&#x27;s body. 

Voldemort forces Rubeus Hagrid to carry Harry&#x27;s apparently lifeless body back to the castle as a trophy, sparking another battle during which Nagini, his last Horcrux, is destroyed by Neville Longbottom. The battle then moves into the Great Hall, where Voldemort fights Minerva McGonagall, Kingsley Shacklebolt, and Horace Slughorn simultaneously. Harry then reveals himself and explains to Voldemort that Draco became the true master of the Elder Wand when he disarmed Dumbledore; Harry, in turn, won the wand&#x27;s allegiance when he took Draco&#x27;s wand. 

Refusing to believe this, Voldemort casts the Killing Curse with the Elder Wand while Harry uses a Disarming Charm with Draco&#x27;s, but the Elder Wand refuses to kill its master and the spell rebounds on Voldemort who, with all of his Horcruxes destroyed, finally dies.

Rowling stated that after his death, Voldemort is forced to exist in the stunted infant-like form that Harry sees in the King&#x27;s Cross-like limbo after his confrontation with Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest. Rowling also mentioned that, despite his extreme fear of death, he cannot become a ghost.

== Portrayal in films ==

Voldemort appears in every &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film, with the exception of &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;. Several actors have portrayed him in his varying incarnations and ages.

In &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;, Voldemort&#x27;s manifestation is as a face on the back of Quirrell&#x27;s head, an effect achieved by computer generated imagery. Ian Hart, the actor who played Quirrell in the same film, provided the voice and the facial source for this character. Voldemort also appears in a scene in the Forbidden Forest where he is seen drinking the blood of a unicorn. As Voldemort&#x27;s face was altered enough by CG work, and Hart&#x27;s voice was affected enough, there was no confusion by Hart&#x27;s playing of the two roles. In that film, he was also shown in a flashback sequence when he arrived at the home of James and Lily Potter to kill them. In this scene Voldemort is played by Richard Bremmer, though his face is never seen. His next appearance would be in &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; as the 16-year-old Tom Marvolo Riddle (portrayed by Christian Coulson).

In &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot;, Voldemort is initially only heard, possessing the scratchy, weak voice heard in the first film. By the film&#x27;s climax, however, he appears in his physical form for the first time, played by Ralph Fiennes. As in the book, Voldemort is shown clad in dark black robes, being tall and emaciated, with no hair and yellowish teeth; his wand has a white tone, and the handle appears to be made of bone; his fingernails are long and pale blue while his toenails appear to be infected. Unlike in the book, his pupils are not cat-like, and his eyes are blue, because producer David Heyman felt that his evil would not be able to be seen and would not fill the audience with fear (his eyes do briefly take on a snake-like appearance when he opens them after turning human, but quickly turn normal). As in the book, the film version of Voldemort has snake-like slit nostrils with the flesh of his nose significantly pressed back. Ralph Fiennes&#x27; nose was not covered in makeup on the set but was digitally removed in post-production. In this first appearance, Voldemort also has a forked tongue, but this element was removed for the subsequent films.

Fiennes stated that he had two weeks to shoot the climactic showdown scene where he is gloating over a terrified Harry, played by Daniel Radcliffe. Fiennes said with a chuckle: &quot;I have no doubt children will be afraid of me now if they weren&#x27;t before.&quot; In preparation, he read the novel &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot;, but jokingly conceded: &quot;I was only interested in my scene, and I had to go through thousands and thousands of other scenes which I did, dutifully, until I got to my scene and I read it many, many, many, many, many times and that was my research.&quot; Fiennes reprised his role as Voldemort in &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot; and &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1&quot; and &quot;Part 2&quot;.

Fiennes&#x27;s nephew, Hero Fiennes Tiffin, portrayed Tom Riddle as a child in &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot;. By the time filming arrived Christian Coulson was 29, and not considered suitable to return as the adolescent Riddle. Thomas James Longley was originally scheduled to take over the role, but last minute renegotiations saw Frank Dillane cast instead.

==&quot;Harry Potter and the Cursed Child&quot;==

In the 2016 stage play &quot;Harry Potter and the Cursed Child&quot;, it is revealed that Bellatrix gave birth to Voldemort&#x27;s daughter Delphi before the Battle of Hogwarts. Twenty-two years later, Delphi poses as Cedric&#x27;s cousin and manipulates Harry and Ginny&#x27;s second son Albus Severus Potter and his friend, Draco and Astoria Greengrass&#x27;s son Scorpius Malfoy, into stealing a prototype Time Turner with which she hopes to resurrect her father. Using the Time Turner, Scorpius accidentally creates an alternative timeline where Voldemort killed Harry at the battle and now rules the wizarding world. In an attempt to achieve this future, Delphi travels to Godric&#x27;s Hollow on the night Voldemort killed Harry&#x27;s parents, hoping to avert the prophecy that led to her father&#x27;s downfall. After receiving a message from his son, Harry, together with Ron, Hermione and Draco (who by now has become friends with Harry after they join forces to save their respective sons) transfigures himself into Voldemort so that he can distract Delphi, allowing them to overpower her. The real Voldemort kills Harry&#x27;s parents as prophesied, and Delphi is sent to Azkaban.

== Characterisation ==
=== Outward appearance ===
After he regains his body in the fourth book, Rowling describes Voldemort as having pale skin, a chalk-white, skull-like face, snake-like slits for nostrils, red eyes and cat-like slits for pupils, a skeletally thin body and long, thin hands with unnaturally long fingers. As mentioned in the first chapter of the seventh book, he also has no hair or lips. Earlier in life, as seen through flashbacks contained in the second and sixth books, Tom Marvolo Riddle was handsome and tall with pale skin, jet black hair, and dark brown eyes. He could charm many people with his looks. The transformation into his monstrous state is believed to have been the result of creating his Horcruxes and becoming less human as he continued to divide his soul. In the films, Voldemort&#x27;s eyes are blue with round pupils, as the decision was made not to have his portrayer Ralph Fiennes wear colored contact lenses.

=== Personality ===
Rowling described Voldemort as &quot;the most evil wizard for hundreds and hundreds of years&quot;. She elaborated that he is a &quot;raging psychopath, devoid of the normal human responses to other people&#x27;s suffering&quot;, and whose only ambition in life is to become all-powerful and immortal. He is also a sadist who hurts and murders people—especially Muggles—for his own amusement. He has no conscience, feels no remorse or empathy, and does not recognise the worth and humanity of anybody except himself.
He feels no need for human companionship or friendship and cannot comprehend love or affection for another. He believes he is superior to everyone around him, to the point that he frequently refers to himself in the third person as &quot;Lord Voldemort&quot;. Rowling also stated that Voldemort is &quot;incredibly power hungry. Racist, really&quot;, and that if Voldemort were to look into the Mirror of Erised, in which one sees one&#x27;s greatest desire, he would see &quot;Himself, all-powerful and eternal. That&#x27;s what he wants.&quot;

Rowling also stated that Voldemort&#x27;s conception by influence of Amortentia—a love potion administered by his mother, a witch named Merope Gaunt, to the Muggle Tom Riddle—is related to his inability to understand love; it is &quot;a symbolic way of showing that he came from a loveless union—but of course, everything would have changed if Merope had survived and raised him herself and loved him. The enchantment under which Tom Riddle fathered Voldemort is important because it shows coercion, and there can&#x27;t be many more prejudicial ways to enter the world than as the result of such a union&quot;.

Like most archetypical villains, Voldemort&#x27;s arrogance leads to his downfall. He also suffers from a pathological fear of death, which he regards as a shameful and ignominious human weakness. According to Rowling, his Boggart would be his own corpse. Rowling also said that the difference between Harry and Voldemort is that Harry accepts mortality, and thus Harry is, in the end, stronger than his nemesis.

=== Magical abilities and skills ===

Rowling establishes Voldemort throughout the series as an extremely powerful, intelligent, and ruthless dark wizard, described as the greatest and most powerful Dark Wizard of all time. He is known as one of the greatest Legilimens in the world and a highly accomplished Occlumens; he can read minds and shield his own from penetration. Besides Dumbledore, he is also the only wizard ever known to be able to apparate silently. Voldemort was also said to fear one wizard alone, Dumbledore.

In the final book, Voldemort flies unsupported, something that amazes those who see it. Voldemort, like his ancestral family, the Gaunts, is a Parselmouth, meaning he can converse with serpents. This skill was inherited from his ancestor, Salazar Slytherin. The Gaunt family speak Parseltongue among themselves. This highly unusual trait may be preserved through inbreeding, a practice employed by the Gaunt Family to maintain their blood&#x27;s purity. When Voldemort attempts to kill Harry his ability to speak Parseltongue is passed to Harry through the small bit of the former&#x27;s soul. After that bit of soul is destroyed, Harry loses this ability. In a flashback in the sixth novel, Voldemort boasts to Dumbledore during a job interview that he has &quot;pushed the boundaries of magic farther than they had ever before&quot;. Dumbledore states that Voldemort&#x27;s knowledge of magic is more extensive than any wizard alive and that even Dumbledore&#x27;s most powerful protective spells and charms would likely be insufficient if Voldemort returned to full power. Dumbledore also said that Voldemort was probably the most brilliant student Hogwarts has ever seen. Although Voldemort remains highly accomplished and prodigious in skill, he is enormously lacking and highly inept in the most powerful magic, love. This inability to love and trust others proves to be Voldemort&#x27;s greatest weakness in the series. Voldemort initially voices scepticism that his own magic might not be the most powerful, but upon returning to power, he admits to his Death Eaters that he had overlooked the ancient and powerful magic which Lily Potter invoked and that would protect Harry from harm.

On her website, Rowling wrote that Voldemort&#x27;s wand is made of yew, whose sap is poisonous, and which symbolises death. It forms a deliberate contrast to Harry&#x27;s wand, which is made of holly, which she chose because holly is alleged to repel evil.

Rowling establishes in the books that Voldemort is magically connected to Harry via Harry&#x27;s forehead scar. He disembodies himself when his Killing Curse targeting Harry rebounds on him, leaving the scar on Harry&#x27;s forehead. In the books, and to a lesser extent in the films, Harry&#x27;s scar serves as an indicator of Voldemort&#x27;s presence: it burns when the Dark Lord is near or when Voldemort is feeling murderous or exultant. According to Rowling, by attacking Harry when he was a baby Voldemort gave him &quot;tools [that] no other wizard possessed—the scar and the ability it conferred, a magical window into Voldemort&#x27;s mind&quot;.

=== Family ===
Voldemort was born Tom Marvolo Riddle on 31 December 1926. His mother Merope died in childbirth, leaving the baby to grow up alone in an orphanage. In &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot;, it is revealed that Voldemort murdered his father and grandparents, leaving himself the only surviving member of the Riddle family.

==== House of Gaunt ====
Most of the exposition of the House of Gaunt″s background occurs in &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot;, through the medium of Dumbledore&#x27;s Pensieve. The Gaunts were once a powerful and influential family, and are the last known descendants of Salazar Slytherin. However, a vein of mental instability and violence within the family, reinforced through cousin marriages intended to preserve the pureblood line, had reduced them to poverty and squalor, as shown in the Pensieve&#x27;s &quot;memory&quot; that Harry and Dumbledore witnessed. Like Salazar Slytherin, the Gaunts spoke Parseltongue. At the time of the story, the Gaunts&#x27; only material asset is a ramshackle shanty in Little Hangleton, that stood in a thicket in a valley opposite the Riddle House. Like the Riddles, the Gaunts were also unpopular with the local residents, with a reputation for being vulgar and intimidating.

Marvolo Gaunt was the last family patriarch. He was sentenced to a short term in Azkaban for his and his son&#x27;s assault upon a Ministry of Magic official; this affected his health and he died soon after returning home. His signet ring passed to his son, Morfin Gaunt, who was convicted of assaulting a Muggle, and later died in Azkaban, convicted this time as a party to the murder of Tom Riddle Sr and Riddle&#x27;s parents.

Dumbledore discovers the real culprit while visiting Morfin in Azkaban to gather information about Voldemort. After Dumbledore successfully extracts Morfin&#x27;s memory of his encounter with his nephew, he tries to use the evidence to have Morfin released, but Morfin dies before the decision can be made. The House of Gaunt ended with Morfin&#x27;s death.

Merope Gaunt () was the daughter of Marvolo, and sister of Morfin. Harry&#x27;s first impression of her was that she looked &quot;like the most defeated person he had ever seen&quot;. She married Tom Riddle Sr and became pregnant within three months of the wedding. It is suggested that she tricked her husband into loving her by using a love potion, but sometime during her pregnancy, chose to stop administering the potion. It is implied that Merope had grown tired of living the lie and thought that her husband might have grown to love her, or that he might have stayed for the sake of their unborn child; however, he left her. Desperate, Merope wandered through the streets of London. The only thing she had left was the heavy gold locket that had once belonged to Salazar Slytherin, one of her family&#x27;s most treasured items, which she sold for a small amount. When she was due to give birth, she stumbled into a Muggle orphanage, where she gave birth to her only son. She died within the next hour.

== Reception ==
Several people have drawn a parallel between Voldemort and some politicians. Rowling has said that Voldemort was &quot;a sort of&quot; Adolf Hitler, and that there is some parallel with Nazism in her books. Rowling also compared Voldemort to Joseph Stalin. Alfonso Cuarón, director of &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; compared Voldemort to George W. Bush and Saddam Hussein, who he said &quot;...have selfish interests and are very much in love with power. Also, a disregard for the environment. A love for manipulating people.&quot; Andrew Slack and the Harry Potter Alliance compare media consolidation in the US to Voldemort&#x27;s regime in &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot; and its control over the &quot;Daily Prophet&quot; and other media saying that &quot;Once Voldemort took over every form of media in the wizarding world, Dumbledore&#x27;s Army and the Order of the Phoenix formed an independent media movement called &#x27;Potterwatch&#x27;. Now the HP Alliance and Wizard Rock have come together to fight for a Potterwatch movement in the real world to fight back against Big VoldeMedia from further pushing out local and foreign news, minority representation, and the right to a Free Press.&quot; Julia Turner of &quot;Slate Magazine&quot; also noted similarities between the events of &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot; and the War on Terror. She said that Voldemort commits acts of terrorism such as destroying bridges, murdering innocents, and forcing children to kill their elders. Rowling compared Voldemort to Donald Trump during his 2016 presidential campaign.

Voldemort has also been compared to other fictional characters, such as Sauron from &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;; they are, during the time when the main plot takes place, seeking to recover their lost power after having been considered dead or at least no longer a threat, and are also so feared that they are sometimes unnamed.

The entertainment website &quot;IGN&quot; listed Voldemort as the seventh best &quot;Harry Potter&quot; character, calling him &quot;truly frightening&quot;.

== In popular culture ==
Several campaigns have used Voldemort to compare his evil to the influence of politicians, large media and corporations. &quot;Lord Voldemort&quot; is a nickname sometimes used for Peter Mandelson. Voldemort is also a recurring theme among wizard rock bands. &quot;Voldemort Can&#x27;t Stop the Rock!&quot; is the second album from Harry and the Potters, and the character is mentioned in songs such as &quot;The Dark Lord Lament&quot; and &quot;Flesh, Blood, and Bone&quot;.

Voldemort also appears in the &quot;Potter Puppet Pals&quot; sketches by Neil Cicierega. One of the episodes including him was the seventeenth most viewed video of all time as of 2008 and the winner for &quot;Best Comedy&quot; of the year 2007 at YouTube.

&quot;Continuing the Magic&quot;, an article in the 21 May 2007 issue of &quot;Time&quot;, includes mock book covers designed by author Lon Tweeten, laced with pop culture references. One of them, the &quot;Dark Lord of the Dance&quot;, shows Voldemort teaming up with Harry on Broadway. In the &quot;MAD Magazine&quot; parodies of the films, the character is called Lord Druckermort, a backwards reference to the magazine&#x27;s longtime caricaturist Mort Drucker. In Alan Moore&#x27;s &quot;League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: 1969&quot;, a young Tom Marvolo Riddle (introduced as &quot;Tom&quot;, whose middle name is a &quot;marvel&quot; and last name is a &quot;conundrum&quot;) appears, and becomes the new avatar of Oliver Haddo at the story&#x27;s conclusion. In &quot;A Very Potter Musical&quot;, Voldemort is played by actor Joe Walker.

In a segment celebrating British children&#x27;s literature at the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony in London, an inflatable Voldemort appeared alongside other villains, The Queen of Hearts, Captain Hook, and Cruella de Vil, to haunt children&#x27;s dreams, before the arrival of a group of over thirty Mary Poppins who descended with their umbrellas to defeat them.

In 2015, British activist Majid Nawaz used and popularized the term &quot;Voldemort effect&quot; to describe the inability to name, shame and isolate Islamist extremism from the moderate Muslim community.

During the 2016 United States elections, Daniel Radcliffe was asked by Sky News journalist Craig Dillon if he would compare Donald Trump to Lord Voldemort; Radcliffe responded, &quot;Trump is worse&quot;.

Voldemort appears in &quot;The Lego Batman Movie&quot; as one of the prisoners in the Phantom Zone that Joker recruits to take over Gotham City. Though Ralph Fiennes is featured in this movie as the voice of the British butler Alfred Pennyworth, he does not reprise his role as Voldemort. Instead, Voldemort is voiced by Eddie Izzard.

Outside of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; video games, Voldemort is also a playable character in &quot;Lego Dimensions&quot;, with archive audio of Fiennes&#x27; portrayal in the films used for his voiceovers.

A 2018 Italian fan film titled &quot;&quot; depicts the story of Tom Riddle&#x27;s rise to power.

Voldemort appears in &quot;Space Jam: A New Legacy&quot;, in the crowd for the game between the Tune Squad and the Goon Squad.

An upcoming French fan-made short-film titled &quot;The House of Gaunt&quot; &quot;- Lord Voldemort Origins&quot; explores the origin story of Voldemort and The Gaunt family.

In the &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; spinoff &quot;Better Call Saul&quot;, Saul Goodman, speaking to Mike Ehrmantraut, nicknames the drug lord Gus Fring &#x27;He Who Shall Not Be Named&#x27; in reference to Voldemort.

In May 2022, senior Australian Labor Party MP Tanya Plibersek compared former defence minister Peter Dutton from the Liberal Party of Australia to Voldemort. During a discussion about Dutton&#x27;s prospects of becoming Liberal Party leader on Brisbane radio station 4BC, she said: &quot;I think there will be a lot of children who have watched a lot of Harry Potter films who will be very frightened of what they are seeing on TV at night, that&#x27;s for sure... I am saying he looks a bit like Voldemort and we will see whether he can do what he promised he would do when he was last running for leader which is smile more.&quot; A spokesperson from Plibersek&#x27;s office said that she had reached out to Dutton soon after the interview to offer an unreserved apology and to say that she should have not made the remark. Labor Party leader, prime minister Anthony Albanese said Pilbersek&#x27;s comments were &quot;not acceptable&quot; and that she had done the right thing in offering an apology. Dutton confirmed Plibersek had apologised. In response, Dutton said that while the comments were unfortunate, they were &quot;water off a duck&#x27;s back.&quot; He said that he realised that he was &quot;not the prettiest bloke on the block&quot; and said that he was bald due to being diagnosed with a skin condition.

<doc id="45107" wikidata="Q27697" url="?curid=45107" title="Madeira wine">
<text>Madeira is a fortified wine made on the Portuguese island of Madeira, in the North Atlantic Ocean. Madeira is produced in a variety of styles ranging from dry wines which can be consumed on their own, as an apéritif, to sweet wines usually consumed with dessert. Cheaper cooking versions are often flavoured with salt and pepper for use in cooking, but these are not fit for consumption as a beverage.

The islands of Madeira have a long winemaking history, dating back to the Age of Exploration (approximately from the end of the 15th century), when Madeira was a standard port of call for ships heading to the New World or East Indies. To prevent the wine from spoiling, the local vintners began adding neutral grape spirits. On the long sea voyages, the wine would be exposed to excessive heat and movement, which benefited its flavour. This was discovered when an unsold shipment of wine was returned to the islands after a round trip.

Today, Madeira is noted for its unique winemaking process which involves oxidizing the wine through heat and ageing. The younger blends (three and five years old) are produced with the aid of artificial application of heat to accelerate the aging process; the older blends, colheitas and frasqueiras, are produced by the canteiro method. Because of the way these wines are aged, they are very long-lived in the bottle, and those produced by the canteiro method will survive for decades and even centuries, even after being opened. Wines that have been in barrels for many decades are often removed and stored in demijohns where they may remain unharmed indefinitely.

Some wines produced in small quantities in Crimea, California, and Texas are also referred to as &quot;Madeira&quot; or &quot;Madera&quot;; however, most countries conform to the EU PDO regulations and limit the use of the term &quot;Madeira&quot; or &quot;Madère&quot; to wines that come from the Madeira Islands.

== History of Madeira ==
===Development and success (15th–18th centuries)===

The roots of Madeira&#x27;s wine industry date back to the Age of Exploration, when Madeira was a regular port of call for ships travelling to the East Indies. By the 16th century, records indicate that a well-established wine industry on the island supplied these ships with wine for the long voyages across the sea. The earliest examples of Madeira were unfortified and tended to spoil before reaching their destination. However, following the example of port, a small amount of distilled alcohol made from cane sugar was added to stabilize the wine by boosting the alcohol content (the modern process of fortification using brandy did not become widespread until the 18th century). The Dutch East India Company became a regular customer, picking up large, casks of wine known as &quot;pipes&quot; for their voyages to India.

The intense heat in the holds of the ships had a transforming effect on the wine, as discovered by Madeira producers when one shipment was returned to the island after a long trip. The customer was found to prefer the taste of this style of wine, and Madeira labeled as &quot;vinho da roda&quot; (wines that have made a round trip) became very popular. Madeira producers found that aging the wine on long sea voyages was very costly, so they began to develop methods on the island to produce the same aged and heated style. They began storing the wines on trestles at the winery or in special rooms known as &quot;estufas&quot;, where the heat of the island sun would age the wine.

With the increase of commercial treaties with England such as the Marriage Treaty in 1662, important English merchants settled on the island and, ultimately, controlled the increasingly important island wine trade. The English traders settled in the Funchal as of the seventeenth century, consolidating the markets from North America, the West Indies and England itself. Notable brands include Cossart and Gordon founded in 1745 and Blandy&#x27;s in 1811.

The eighteenth century was the &quot;golden age&quot; for Madeira. The wine&#x27;s popularity extended from the American colonies and Brazil in the New World to Great Britain, Russia, and Northern Africa. The American colonies, in particular, were enthusiastic customers, consuming as much as 95% of all wine produced on the island each year.

=== Early American history (17th–18th centuries) ===
Madeira was a very important wine in the history of the United States of America. No wine-quality grapes were grown among the thirteen colonies, so imports were needed, with a great focus on Madeira. One of the major events on the road to the American Revolution in which Madeira played a key role was the seizure of John Hancock&#x27;s sloop by Boston customs officials on 9 May 1768. Hancock&#x27;s boat was seized after he had unloaded a cargo of 25 pipes () of Madeira, and a dispute arose over import duties. The seizure of &quot;Liberty&quot; caused riots to erupt in Boston.

Madeira was a favorite of Thomas Jefferson, and it was used to toast the Declaration of Independence. George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, Benjamin Franklin and John Adams are also said to have appreciated the qualities of Madeira. The wine was mentioned in Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s autobiography. On one occasion, Adams wrote to his wife, Abigail, of the great quantities of Madeira he consumed while a Massachusetts delegate to the Continental Congress. A bottle of Madeira was used by visiting Captain James Sever to christen in 1797. Chief Justice John Marshall was also known to appreciate Madeira, as were his cohorts on the early U.S. Supreme Court. Madeira and walnuts were often served together as a last course at dinner parties in Washington in the early decades of the 1800s.

===Modern era (19th century – present)===
The mid-19th century ushered an end to the industry&#x27;s prosperity. First came the 1851 discovery of powdery mildew, which severely reduced production over the next three years. Just as the industry was recovering through the use of the copper-based Bordeaux mixture fungicide, the phylloxera epidemic that had plagued France and other European wine regions reached the island. By the end of the 19th century, most of the island&#x27;s vineyards had been uprooted, and many were converted to sugar cane production. The majority of the vineyards that did replant chose to use American vine varieties, such as &quot;Vitis labrusca, Vitis riparia and Vitis rupestris&quot; or hybrid grape varieties rather than replant with the &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; varieties that were previously grown.

By the turn of the 20th century, sales started to slowly return to normal, until the industry was rocked again by the Russian Civil War and American Prohibition, which closed off two of Madeira&#x27;s biggest markets. After the repeal of Prohibition, improved shipping technology meant that ships no longer needed to stop off in Madeira, the island which was directly in the trade winds between Europe and America. The wine became known as The Forgotten Island Wine. The rest of the 20th century saw a downturn for Madeira, both in sales and reputation, as low-quality &quot;cooking wine&quot; became primarily associated with the island—much as it had for Marsala.

In 1988, the Symington family of Portugal invested in the Madeira Wine Company which owned many of the Madeira brand names. They asked Bartholomew Broadbent to re-launch Madeira and create a market for it again in America, which he did in 1989, establishing a firm rebirth of Madeira.

Towards the end of the 20th century, some producers started a renewed focus on quality—ripping out the hybrid and American vines and replanting with the &quot;noble grape&quot; varieties of Sercial, Verdelho, Terrantez, Bual and Malvasia. The &quot;workhorse&quot; varieties of Tinta Negra Mole now known officially as just Tinta Negra, and Complexa are still present and in high use, but hybrid grapes were officially banned from wine production in 1979. Today, Madeira&#x27;s primary markets are in the Benelux countries, France (where it is only used for cooking, salt and pepper having been added prior to bottling), and Germany; emerging markets are growing in Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

== Viticulture ==
===Climate and geography===
The island of Madeira has an oceanic climate with some tropical influences. With high rainfall and average mean temperature of 66 °F (19 °C), the threats of fungal grape diseases and botrytis rot are constant viticultural hazards. To combat these threats, Madeira vineyards are often planted on low trellises, known as &quot;latada&quot;, that raise the canopy of the vine off the ground similar to a style used in the Vinho Verde region of Portugal. The terrain of the mountainous volcanic island is difficult to cultivate, so vineyards are planted on man-made terraces of red and brown basaltic bedrock. These terraces, known as &quot;poios&quot;, are very similar to the terraces of the Douro that make Port wine production possible. The use of mechanical harvesting and vineyard equipment is near impossible, making wine grape growing a costly endeavor on the island. Many vineyards have in the past been ripped up for commercial tourist developments or replanted with such products as bananas for commercial concerns. Some replanting is taking place on the island; however, the tourist trade is generally seen as a more lucrative business than wine-making. Most of the grapes, grown by around 2100 grape growers are from vines planted on small plots of land off of which the grape growers survive by making an income from a variety of different inter-grown crops.

=== Grape varieties ===
Approximately 85% of Madeira is produced with the red grape, Negra Mole. The four major white grape varieties used for Madeira production are (from sweetest to driest) Malvasia, Bual, Verdelho, and Sercial. These varieties also lend their names to Madeira labelling, as discussed below. Occasionally one sees Terrantez, Bastardo and Moscatel varieties, although these are now rare on the island because of oidium and phylloxera. Since 2016, to encourage more growers to plant Terrantez, Madeira&#x27;s fifth noble grape variety, the government Wine, Embroidery and Handicraft Institute of Madeira (IVBAM) has offered growers free viticultural advice and a €1.30 subsidy per kilogram of Terrantez fruit harvested. As of 2016, Terrantez production stood at . After the phylloxera epidemic, many wines were &quot;mislabelled&quot; as containing one of these noble grape varieties, which were reinterpreted as &quot;wine styles&quot; rather than true varietal names. Since the epidemic, Tinta Negra (or Negra Mole) and Complexa are the workhorse varieties on the island and are found in various concentrations in many blends and vintage wines. Bastardo, Complexa, and Tinta Negra are red grape varieties.

Grown exclusively on the neighboring island of Porto Santo, which is also permitted under the appellation law to provide grapes for Madeira wine, are the varieties Listrão (Palomino Fino) and Caracol. Listrão Madeira was formerly made by a few companies such as Blandy&#x27;s and Artur de Barros e Sousa, the latter being the last old producer to utilize the variety when they closed their doors in 2013, but Madeira Vintners founded in that year subsequently restarted production of, and released in 2020, a 5-year-old Listrão Reserve Madeira. Caracol, an obscure grape believed to be unique to Porto Santo and only used for the local production of dry table wine in the past, was turned into fortified Madeira for the first time by Madeira Vintners, becoming the first new grape in over a century to be used for high-quality single-varietal Madeira wine. The company&#x27;s stocks are still aging as of 2023 and no wine is on the market yet.

Regulations enacted recently by the European Union have applied the rule that 85% of the grapes in the wine must be of the variety on the label. Thus, wines from before the late 19th century (pre-phylloxera) and after the late 20th century conform to this rule. Many &quot;varietally labelled&quot; Madeiras, from most of the 20th century, do not. Modern Madeiras which do not carry a varietal label are generally made from Negra Mole.

Other varieties planted on the island, though not legally permitted for Madeira production, include Arnsburger, Cabernet Sauvignon, and the American hybrids Cunningham and Jacquet.

=== Winemaking ===

The initial winemaking steps of Madeira start out like most other wines: grapes are harvested, crushed, pressed, and then fermented in either stainless steel or oak casks. The grape varieties destined for sweeter winesBual and Malvasiaare often fermented on their skins to leach more phenols from the grapes to balance the sweetness of the wine. Drier winesmade from Sercial, Verdelho, and Negra Moleare separated from their skins prior to fermentation. Depending on the level of sweetness desired, fermentation of the wine is halted at some point by the addition of neutral grape spirits.

Younger wines (typically 3 and 5 years old) undergo the &quot;estufagem&quot; aging process to produce Madeira&#x27;s distinctive flavor by artificial heating, whereas the wines destined for long aging are barrel-aged using only the naturally high temperatures of the barrel storage rooms (see &quot;canteiro process&quot;).

Colourings such as caramel colouring have been used in the past to give some consistency (see also whiskey), although this practice is decreasing.

=== The aging process ===
 What makes Madeira wine production unique is how the wines are aged in relatively high temperatures, meant to duplicate the effect of a long sea voyage on the aging barrels through tropical climates. Three main methods are used to heat the wine during aging. The two processes belong to the &quot;estufagem&quot; process (&quot;estufa&quot; means hothouse or stove in Portuguese), in which artificial heat is used to accelerate the aging process of the wines, whereas the &quot;canteiro&quot; process is used for the older and more expensive wines and employs only the natural heat of the barrel warehouses.

&quot;Estufagem&quot; processes:
* &quot;Armazém de Calor&quot;: Only used by the Madeira Wine Company, this method involves storing the wine in large wooden casks in a specially designed room outfitted with steam-producing tanks or pipes that heat the room, creating a type of sauna. This process more gently exposes the wine to heat and can last from six months to over a year.
* &quot;Cuba de Calor&quot;: The most common, used for low-cost Madeira, is bulk aging in low stainless steel or concrete tanks surrounded by either heat coils or piping that allow hot water to circulate around the container. The wine is heated to temperatures as high as 130 °F (55 °C) for a minimum of 90 days as regulated by the Madeira Wine Institute. However, the Madeira is most commonly heated to approximately 115 °F (46 °C)

Barrel-aging process:
* &quot;Canteiro&quot;: Used for the highest quality Madeiras, these wines are aged without the use of any artificial heat, being stored by the winery in warm rooms that are heated only by the warm climate of the Madeira island. In cases such as &quot;Frasqueira&quot; (vintage) Madeira, this heating process can last from 20 years to even more than 100 years. The term &quot;Canteiro&quot; comes from &quot;canteiros&quot;the wooden staves that keep the barrels in their places. &quot;Canteiro&quot; process is used by all of the top Madeira brands, including Blandy&#x27;s, Borges, Broadbent, d&#x27;Oliveiras and Justino&#x27;s.

Much of the characteristic flavour of Madeira is due to this practice, which hastens the mellowing of the wine and also tends to check secondary fermentation in as much as it is, in effect, a mild kind of pasteurization. Furthermore, the wine is deliberately exposed to air, causing it to oxidize. The resulting wine has a colour similar to a tawny port wine. Wine tasters sometimes describe a wine that has been exposed to excessive heat during its storage as being cooked or &quot;maderized&quot;.

== Styles ==
===The noble varieties===
The four major styles of Madeira are synonymous with the names of the four best-known white grapes used to produce the wine. Ranging from the sweetest style to the driest style, the Madeira types are:
* &quot;Malvasia&quot; (also known as &quot;Malvazia&quot; or &quot;Malmsey&quot;) has its fermentation halted when its sugars are between 3.5 and 6.5° Baumé (63-117 g/L). This style of wine is characterised by its dark colour, rich texture, and coffee-caramel flavours. Like other Madeiras made from noble grape varieties, the Malvasia grape used in Malmsey production has naturally high levels of acidity in the wine, which balances with the high sugar levels so the wines do not taste cloyingly sweet.
* &quot;Bual&quot; (also called &quot;Boal&quot;) has its fermentation halted when its sugars are between 2.5 and 3.5° Baumé (45-63 g/L). This style of wine is characterized by its dark colour, medium-rich texture, and raisin flavours.
* &quot;Verdelho&quot; has its fermentation halted a little earlier than Sercial, when its sugars are between 1.5 and 2.5° Baumé (27-45 g/L). This style of wine is characterized by smokey notes and high acidity.
* &quot;Sercial&quot; is nearly fermented completely dry, with very little residual sugar (0.5 to 1.5° on the Baumé scale, or 9-27 g/L). This style of wine is characterised by high-toned colours, almond flavours, and high acidity.
A fifth noble grape, &quot;Terrantez&quot;, almost became extinct on the island but has been making a comeback. Its style ranges in sweetness from that of Verdelho to that of Bual, never being quite as dry as Sercial nor quite as sweet as Malvasia.

=== Other labelling ===

Wines made from at least 85% of the noble varieties of Sercial, Verdelho, Bual, and Malvasia are usually labelled based on the amount of time they were aged:
* Colheita or Harvest – This style includes wines from a single vintage, but aged for a shorter period than true Vintage Madeira. The wine can be labelled with a vintage date but includes the word &quot;colheita&quot; on it. Colheita must be a minimum of five years of age before being bottled and may be bottled any time after that. Effectively, most wineries would drop the word Colheita once bottling a wine at over 19 years of age because it is entitled to be referred to as vintage once it is 20 years of age. At that point, the wine can command a higher price than if it were still to be bottled as Colheita. This differs from Colheita Port which is a minimum of seven years of age before bottling.
*A wine labeled as Finest has been aged for at least three years. This style is usually reserved for cooking.
* Reserve (five years) – This is the minimum amount of aging a wine labelled with one of the noble varieties are permitted to have.
* Special Reserve (10 years) – At this point, the wines are often aged naturally without any artificial heat source.
* Extra Reserve (over 15 years) – This style is rare to produce, with many producers extending the aging to 20 years for a vintage or producing a &quot;colheita&quot;. It is richer in style than a Special Reserve Madeira.
* Vintage or Frasqueira – This style must be aged at least 19 years in a cask and one year in bottle, therefore cannot be sold until it is at least 20 years of age. The word &quot;vintage&quot; does not appear on bottles of vintage Madeira because, in Portugal, the word &quot;Vintage&quot; is a trademark belonging to the Port traders.
The terms pale, dark, full, and rich can also be included to describe the wine&#x27;s colour.

Madeira produced from Negra Mole grapes used to be legally restricted to use generic terms on the label to indicate the level of sweetness as &quot;seco&quot; (dry), &quot;meio seco&quot; (medium dry), &quot;meio doce&quot; (medium sweet) and &quot;doce&quot; (sweet). However, in 2015 the Madeira Wine Institute announced that producers may officially recognise Tinta Negra on their front labels and that all &quot;expressions&quot; must state their bottling date.

Wines listed with &quot;Solera&quot; were made in a style similar to sherry, with a fractional blending of wines from different vintages in a solera system. The Solera method of blending is most widely practiced in the sherry production of Spain. However, the rules for Madeira soleras are different. When it comes to sherry, as wine is used for bottling, new wine is added to the barrels of older wine and this continuous addition of young wine to old would result in very little wine being from the original vintage. With Madeira, approximately 50% of a bottle would likely be from the stated year because they are only allowed to add up to 10%, not more than 10 times. Another interesting peculiarity of old solera Madeiras is that they were initially developed as a result of trying to extend the stocks of vintages when the vines had stopped being productive due to Phylloxera. Therefore, as there was no younger wine to add to the vintage, it was usually older wines that were added. In recent years, vintage Madeiras have been commanding higher prices than soleras, but, from 1966 (when Michael Broadbent started wine auctions at Christie&#x27;s), until about the end of the 20th century, solera Madeiras always fetched a premium at auction over the vintage ones.

=== Rainwater ===
A style called &quot;Rainwater&quot; is one of the largest-selling styles of Madeira in the United States, most commonly drunk as an apéritif. Nowadays it is almost always an inexpensive medium-dry style of wine made entirely from Tinta Negra grapes, and aged for around three years including a period in an estufa, but Barbeito continues to produce a more expensive Rainwater in the old pre-phylloxera style by blending Sercial and Verdelho grapes.

Accounts conflict as to how this style was developed and named. The most common one derives from the vineyards on the steep hillsides, where irrigation was difficult, and the vines were dependent on the local rainwater for survival. Another involves a shipment destined for the American colonies that was accidentally diluted by rainwater while it sat on the docks in Savannah, Georgia, or Funchal. Rather than dump the wines, the merchants tried to pass it off as a &quot;new style&quot; of Madeira and were surprised at its popularity among the Americans. Another story relates that a gentleman in Savannah, Georgia tasted such a Madeira and declared, &quot;This is as fine as Rainwater.&quot;

== Characteristics ==

Exposure to extreme temperature and oxygen accounts for Madeira&#x27;s stability; an opened bottle will survive unharmed indefinitely. As long as a cork is put into the top of the bottle to prevent the effects of evaporation, fruit flies, and dust, a vintage Madeira, once opened, can last for decades. Properly sealed in bottles, it is one of the longest-lasting wines; Madeiras have been known to survive over 200 years in excellent condition. It is not uncommon to see 150-year-old Madeiras for sale at stores that specialize in rare wine. Vintages dating back to 1780 are known to exist. The oldest bottle that has come onto the market is a 1715 Terrantez.

Before the advent of artificial refrigeration, Madeira wine was particularly prized in areas where it was impractical to construct wine cellars (as in parts of the southern United States) because, unlike many other fine wines, it could survive being stored over hot summers without significant damage. In the Americas, Madeira was traditionally stored in the warm attics of houses. 

==Uses==
Popular uses include apéritifs (pre-meal) and digestifs (post-meal). In Britain it has traditionally been associated with Madeira cake.

Madeira is also used as a flavouring agent in cooking. Lower-quality Madeira wines may be flavored with salt and pepper to prevent their sale as Madeira wine, and then exported for cooking purposes. Madeira wine is commonly used in tournedos Rossini and &quot;sauce madère&quot; (Madeira sauce). Unflavored Madeira may also be used in cooking, such as the dessert dish &quot;Plum in madeira&quot;.
== Intangible Cultural Heritage ==
The 11 September 2024, the University of Madeira announced the intention to lead the drafting of an application of the Madeira wine traditions to the Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity (official announcement here).

<text>Marie Antoinette (; ; Maria Antonia Josefa Johanna; 2 November 1755 – 16 October 1793) was the last Queen of France before the French Revolution and the establishment of the French First Republic. She was the wife of Louis XVI. Born Archduchess Maria Antonia of Austria, she was the penultimate child and youngest daughter of Empress Maria Theresa and Emperor Francis I. She married Louis Auguste, Dauphin of France, in May 1770 at the age of 14. She then became the Dauphine of France. On 10 May 1774, her husband ascended the throne as Louis XVI and she became queen.

As queen, Marie Antoinette became increasingly a target of criticism by opponents of the domestic and foreign policies of Louis XVI, and those opposed to the monarchy in general. The French &quot;libelles&quot; accused her of being profligate, promiscuous, having illegitimate children, and harboring sympathies for France&#x27;s perceived enemies, including her native Austria. She was falsely accused of defrauding the Crown&#x27;s jewelers in the Affair of the Diamond Necklace, but the accusations damaged her reputation further. During the French Revolution, she became known as &quot;Madame Déficit&quot; because the country&#x27;s financial crisis was blamed on her lavish spending and her opposition to social and financial reforms proposed by Anne Robert Jacques Turgot and Jacques Necker.

Several events were linked to Marie Antoinette during the Revolution after the government placed the royal family under house arrest in the Tuileries Palace in October 1789. The June 1791 attempted flight to Varennes and her role in the War of the First Coalition were immensely damaging to her image among French citizens. On 10 August 1792, the attack on the Tuileries forced the royal family to take refuge at the Assembly, and they were imprisoned in the Temple Prison on 13 August 1792. On 21 September 1792, France was declared a republic and the monarchy was abolished. Louis XVI was executed by guillotine on 21 January 1793. Marie Antoinette&#x27;s trial began on 14 October 1793; two days later, she was convicted by the Revolutionary Tribunal of high treason and executed by beheading by guillotine on 16 October 1793 at the Place de la Révolution during the French Revolution.

==Early life (1755–1770)==
Marie Antoinette, full name Maria Antonia Josepha Johanna, was born on 2 November 1755 at the Hofburg Palace in Vienna, Archduchy of Austria, at 20:30. She was the youngest daughter and 15th child 
of Empress Maria Theresa, ruler of the Habsburg monarchy, and her husband Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor. Maria Theresa gave birth to all of her previous children without any problems. During the birth of her last daughter, serious complications arose, and doctors even feared for the life of the mother. Her godparents were Joseph I and Mariana Victoria, King and Queen of Portugal; Archduke Joseph and Archduchess Maria Anna acted as proxies for their newborn sister.

Maria Antonia was born on All Souls&#x27; Day, a Catholic day of mourning, and during her childhood her birthday was instead celebrated the day before, on All Saints&#x27; Day, due to the connotations of the date. Shortly after her birth she was placed under the care of the governess of the imperial children, Countess von Brandeis. Maria Antonia was raised together with her sister, Maria Carolina of Austria, who was three years older, and with whom she had a lifelong close relationship. Maria Antonia had a difficult but ultimately loving relationship with her mother, who referred to her as &quot;the little Madame Antoine&quot;.

Maria Antonia spent her formative years between the Hofburg Palace and Schönbrunn, the imperial summer residence in Vienna, where on 13 October 1762, when she was seven, she met Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, two months her junior and a child prodigy. Despite the private tutoring she received, the results of her schooling were less than satisfactory. At the age of 10 she could not write correctly in German or in any language commonly used at court, such as French or Italian, and conversations with her were stilted. Under the teaching of Christoph Willibald Gluck, Maria Antonia developed into a good musician. She learned to play the harp, the harpsichord and the flute. She sang during the family&#x27;s evening gatherings, as she was known to have had a beautiful voice. She also excelled at dancing, had &quot;exquisite&quot; poise, and loved dolls.
The death of her older sister Maria Josepha from smallpox during the epidemic in Vienna in October 1767 made an everlasting impression on the young Maria Antonia. Maria Antonia, in her later life, recalled the ailing Maria Josepha taking her in her arms. She told her that she would not be traveling to Naples to marry King Ferdinand IV of Naples, to whom she was betrothed, but for the family vault.

Later in 1768, Mathieu-Jacques de Vermond was dispatched by Louis XV to tutor Marie Antoinette as she became the future wife to Louis XVI. Serving as an educator, Abbé de Vermond found her to be unsatisfactorily educated and lacking in, at the age of 13, important writing skills. Nonetheless, he also complimented her, stating &quot;her character, her heart, are excellent&quot;. He found her &quot;more intelligent than has been generally supposed,&quot; but since &quot;she is rather lazy and extremely frivolous, she is hard to teach&quot;.

Under the recommendation of Étienne François de Choiseul, Duke of Choiseul, a strong supporter of her prospective marriage, Maria Antonia also received a makeover to bring her more in line with the fashion of French royalty. This included the straightening of her teeth by a French dentist, the diversification of her wardrobe, and hairstyles reminiscent of Madame de Pompadour. She was also instructed by Jean-Georges Noverre, who taught her to walk in the gliding fashion characteristic of the court of Versailles.

==Dauphine of France (1770–1774)==
Following the Seven Years&#x27; War and the Diplomatic Revolution of 1756, Empress Maria Theresa decided to end hostilities with her longtime enemy, King Louis XV of France. Their common desire to destroy the ambitions of Prussia and Great Britain, and to secure a definitive peace between their respective countries led them to seal their alliance with a marriage: on 7 February 1770, Louis XV formally requested the hand of Maria Antonia for his eldest surviving grandson and heir, Louis Auguste, Duke of Berry and Dauphin of France.

Maria Antonia formally renounced her rights to Habsburg domains, and on 19 April 1770 she was married by proxy with Louis Auguste at the Augustinian Church, Vienna, with her brother Archduke Ferdinand standing in for the Dauphin. On 14 May 1770 she met her husband at the edge of the forest of Compiègne. Upon her arrival in France, she adopted the French version of her name: Marie Antoinette. A further ceremonial wedding took place on 16 May 1770 in the Palace of Versailles and, after the festivities, the day ended with the ritual bedding. The couple&#x27;s longtime failure to consummate the marriage plagued the reputations of the royal couple for the next seven years.

The initial reaction to the marriage between Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI was mixed. On the one hand, the Dauphine was beautiful, personable and well-liked by the common people. Her first official appearance in Paris on 8 June 1773 was a resounding success. On the other hand, those opposed to the alliance with Austria had a difficult relationship with Marie Antoinette, as did others who disliked her for more personal or petty reasons.

Madame du Barry proved a troublesome foe to the new dauphine. She was Louis XV&#x27;s mistress and had considerable political influence over him. In 1770 she was instrumental in ousting Étienne François, duc de Choiseul, who had helped orchestrate the Franco-Austrian Alliance and Marie Antoinette&#x27;s marriage, and in exiling his sister, the Duchess of Gramont, one of Marie Antoinette&#x27;s ladies-in-waiting. Marie Antoinette was persuaded by her husband&#x27;s aunts to refuse to acknowledge du Barry, which some saw as a political blunder that jeopardized Austria&#x27;s interests at the French court. Marie Antoinette&#x27;s mother and the Austrian ambassador to France, Comte de Mercy-Argenteau, who sent the Empress secret reports on Marie Antoinette&#x27;s behaviour, pressured Marie Antoinette to speak to Madame du Barry, which she grudgingly agreed to do on New Year&#x27;s Day 1772. She merely commented to her, &quot;There are a lot of people at Versailles today&quot;, but it was enough for Madame du Barry, who was satisfied with this recognition, and the crisis passed.

Two days after the death of Louis XV in 1774, Louis XVI exiled du Barry to the Abbaye du Pont-aux-Dames in Meaux, pleasing both his wife and aunts. Two and a half years later, at the end of October 1776, Madame du Barry&#x27;s exile ended and she was allowed to return to her beloved château at Louveciennes, but she was never permitted to return to Versailles.

==Queen of France and Navarre (1774–1792)==
===Early years (1774–1778)===
On 10 May 1774, upon the death of Louis XV, the Dauphin ascended the throne as King Louis XVI of France and Navarre with Marie Antoinette as his queen consort. At the outset, the new queen had limited political influence with her husband, who, with the support of his two most important ministers, Chief Minister Maurepas and Foreign Minister Vergennes, blocked several of her candidates from assuming important positions, including Choiseul. The queen did play a decisive role in the disgrace and exile of the most powerful of Louis XV&#x27;s ministers, the Duc d&#x27;Aiguillon.

On 24 May 1774, two weeks after the death of Louis XV, the king gave his wife the Petit Trianon, a small château on the grounds of Versailles that had been built by Louis XV for his mistress, Madame de Pompadour. Louis XVI allowed Marie Antoinette to renovate it to suit her own tastes; soon rumours circulated that she had plastered the walls with gold and diamonds.
The Queen spent heavily on fashion, luxuries, and gambling, though the country was facing a grave financial crisis and the population was suffering. Rose Bertin created dresses for her, and hairstyles such as &quot;poufs&quot;, up to three feet (90 cm) high, and the &quot;panache—&quot;a spray of feather plumes. She and her court also adopted the English fashion of dresses made of indienne, a material banned in France from 1686 until 1759 to protect local French woolen and silk industries, percale and muslin. As a result of all these fashion activities, Marie Antoinette presided over one of the most important and fashionable courts in history and she was dominant over all of the other ladies of the court; as for her bearing and appearance the queen was very majestic and charismatic in spite of the fact that she gained much weight over the years due to her many pregnancies.

By the time of the Flour War of 1775, a series of riots, due to the high price of flour and bread, had damaged her reputation among the general public. Eventually, Marie Antoinette&#x27;s reputation was no better than that of the favourites of previous kings. Many French people were beginning to blame her for the degrading economic situation, suggesting the country&#x27;s inability to pay off its debt was the result of her wasting the crown&#x27;s money. In her correspondence, Marie Antoinette&#x27;s mother, Maria Theresa, expressed concern over her daughter&#x27;s spending habits, citing the civil unrest it was beginning to cause.

As early as 1774, Marie Antoinette had begun to befriend some of her male admirers, such as the Baron de Besenval, the Duc de Coigny, and Count Valentin Esterházy, and also formed deep friendships with various ladies at court. Most noted was Marie-Louise, Princesse de Lamballe, related to the royal family through her marriage into the Penthièvre family. On 19 September 1774, she appointed her superintendent of her household, an appointment she soon transferred to her new favourite, the Duchess of Polignac.

In 1774, she took under her patronage her former music teacher, the German opera composer Christoph Willibald Gluck, who remained in France until 1779.

===Motherhood, changes at court and intervention in politics (1778–1781)===
Amidst the atmosphere of a wave of &quot;libelles&quot;, the Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II came to France incognito, using the name Comte de Falkenstein, for a six-week visit during which he toured Paris extensively and was a guest at Versailles. He met his sister and her husband on 18 April 1777 at the Château de la Muette, and spoke frankly to his brother-in-law, curious as to why the royal marriage had not been consummated, arriving at the conclusion that no obstacle to the couple&#x27;s conjugal relations existed save the Queen&#x27;s lack of interest and the King&#x27;s unwillingness to exert himself.

In a letter to his brother Leopold, Grand Duke of Tuscany, Joseph II described them as &quot;a couple of complete blunderers.&quot; He disclosed to Leopold that the inexperienced—then still only 22-year-old—Louis XVI had confided in him the course of action he had been undertaking in their marital bed; saying Louis XVI &quot;introduces the member,&quot; but then &quot;stays there without moving for about two minutes,&quot; withdraws without having completed the act and &quot;bids goodnight.&quot;

Suggestions that Louis suffered from phimosis, which was relieved by circumcision, have been discredited. Nevertheless, following Joseph&#x27;s intervention, the marriage was finally consummated in August 1777. Eight months later, in April 1778, it was suspected that the queen was pregnant, which was officially announced on 16 May. Marie Antoinette&#x27;s daughter, Marie-Thérèse Charlotte, &quot;Madame Royale&quot;, was born at Versailles on 19 December 1778. The child&#x27;s paternity was contested in the &quot;libelles&quot;, as were all her children&#x27;s.

In the middle of the queen&#x27;s pregnancy, two events occurred which had a profound effect on her later life: the return of her friend, the Swedish diplomat Count Axel von Fersen the Younger to Versailles for two years, and her brother&#x27;s claim to the throne of Bavaria, contested by Saxony and Prussia. Marie Antoinette pleaded with her husband for the French to intercede on behalf of Austria. The Peace of Teschen, signed on 13 May 1779, ended the brief conflict, with the Queen imposing French mediation at her mother&#x27;s insistence and Austria&#x27;s gaining the Innviertel territory of at least 100,000 inhabitants—a strong retreat from the early French position which was hostile towards Austria. This gave the impression, partially justified, that the Queen had sided with Austria against France.

Meanwhile, the Queen began to institute changes in court customs. Some of them met with the disapproval of the older generation, such as the abandonment of heavy make-up and the popular wide-hooped panniers. The new fashion called for a simpler feminine look, typified first by the rustic &quot;robe à la polonaise&quot; style and later by the &quot;gaulle&quot;, a layered muslin dress Marie Antoinette wore in a 1783 Vigée-Le Brun portrait. In 1780 she began to participate in amateur plays and musicals in the Théâtre de la Reine built for her by Richard Mique.
Repayment of the French debt remained a difficult problem, further exacerbated by Vergennes and also by Marie Antoinette prodding Louis XVI to involve France in the American Revolutionary War. The primary motive for the queen&#x27;s involvement in political affairs in this period may arguably have had more to do with court factionalism than any true interest on her part in politics themselves, but she played an important role in aiding the American Revolution by securing Austrian and Russian support for France, which resulted in the establishment of the First League of Armed Neutrality that stopped Britain&#x27;s attack, and by weighing in decisively for the nomination of Philippe Henri, Marquis de Ségur, as Minister of War and Charles Eugène Gabriel de La Croix as Secretary of the Navy in 1780, who helped George Washington defeat the British in the American Revolutionary War, which ended in 1783.

Marie Antoinette&#x27;s second pregnancy ended in a miscarriage early in July 1779, as confirmed by letters between the Queen and her mother, although some historians believed that she may have experienced bleeding related to an irregular menstrual cycle, which she mistook for a lost pregnancy.

Her third pregnancy was affirmed in March 1781, and on 22 October she gave birth to Louis Joseph Xavier François, Dauphin of France.

Empress Maria Theresa died on 29 November 1780 in Vienna. Marie Antoinette feared that the death of her mother would jeopardise the Franco-Austrian alliance, as well as, ultimately, herself, but her brother, Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, wrote to her that he had no intention of breaking the alliance.

A second visit from Joseph II, which took place in July 1781 to reaffirm the Franco-Austrian alliance and also to see his sister, was tainted by false rumours that Marie Antoinette was sending money to him from the French treasury.

===Declining popularity (1782–1785)===
Despite the general celebration over the birth of an heir, Marie Antoinette&#x27;s political influence, such as it was, was perceived to greatly benefit Austria. During the Kettle War, in which her brother Joseph attempted to open the Scheldt river for naval passage, Marie Antoinette succeeded in obliging Vergennes to pay huge financial compensation to Austria. Finally, the Queen was able to obtain her brother&#x27;s support against Great Britain in the American Revolution and she neutralized French hostility to his alliance with Russia.

In 1782, after the governess of the royal children, the Princesse de Guéméné, went bankrupt and resigned, Marie Antoinette appointed her favourite, the Duchess of Polignac, to the position. This decision met with disapproval from the court as the duchess was considered to be of too modest origins to occupy such an exalted position. In contrast, both the king and the queen trusted Madame de Polignac completely, gave her a thirteen-room apartment in Versailles and paid her well. The entire Polignac family benefited greatly from royal favour in titles and positions, but its sudden wealth and lavish lifestyle outraged most aristocratic families, who resented the Polignacs&#x27; dominance at court, and also fueled the increasing popular disapproval of Marie Antoinette, mostly in Paris. De Mercy wrote to the empress: &quot;It is almost unexampled that in so short a time, the royal favour should have brought such overwhelming advantages to a family&quot;.

In June 1783, Marie Antoinette&#x27;s new pregnancy was announced, but on the night of 1–2 November, her 28th birthday, she suffered a miscarriage.

In 1783 the Queen played a decisive role in the nomination of Charles Alexandre de Calonne, a close friend of the Polignacs, as Controller-General of Finances, and of the Baron de Breteuil as the Minister of the Royal Household, making him perhaps the strongest and most conservative minister of the reign. The result of these two nominations was that Marie Antoinette&#x27;s influence became paramount in government, and the new ministers rejected any major change to the structure of the old regime. More than that, the decree by de Ségur, the minister of war, requiring four quarterings of nobility as a condition for the appointment of officers, mainly served the interest of older noble families including poorer provincial ones, who were widely seen as a reactionary interest group by ambitious members of the middle and professional classes, by some more recent nobility, and even by the Parisian populace and press. The measure also blocked the access of &#x27;commoners&#x27;, mainly sons of members of the professional classes, and of more recently elevated nobility to important positions in the armed forces. As such, the decree became an important grievance for social classes that had been habitually supportive of the monarchy and established order, and which went on to supply the bulk of the early leadership of the French Revolution.

Count Axel von Fersen, after his return from America in June 1783, was accepted into the Queen&#x27;s private society. There were claims that the two were romantically involved, but since most of their correspondence has been lost, destroyed, or redacted, for many years there was no conclusive evidence. Starting in 2016, scientists at the Centre for Research and Restoration of Museums of France (CRCC), uncovered some of the redacted text of the queen&#x27;s letters to Fersen. The revealed texts do not mention a physical relationship, but do confirm a very strong emotional relationship.

Around this time, pamphlets describing farcical sexual deviance including the Queen and her friends in the court were growing in popularity around the country. The &quot;Portefeuille d&#x27;un talon rouge&quot; was one of the earliest, including the queen and a variety of other nobles in a political statement decrying the immoral practices of the court. As time went on, these came to focus more on the queen. They described amorous encounters with a wide range of figures, from the Duchess of Polignac to Louis XV. As these attacks increased, they were connected with the public&#x27;s dislike of her association with the rival nation of Austria. It was publicly suggested that her supposed behaviour was learned at the Austrian court, particularly lesbianism, which was known as the &quot;German vice&quot;. Her mother again expressed concern for the safety of her daughter, and she began to use Austria&#x27;s ambassador to France, Comte de Mercy, to provide information on Marie Antoinette&#x27;s safety and movements.

In 1783, the Queen was busy with the creation of her &quot;hamlet&quot;, a rustic retreat built by her favoured architect, Richard Mique, according to the designs of the painter Hubert Robert. Its creation, however, caused another uproar when its cost became widely known. However, the hamlet was not an eccentricity of Marie Antoinette&#x27;s. It was en vogue at the time for nobles to have recreations of small villages on their properties. In fact, the design was copied from that of Louis Joseph, Prince of Condé. It was also significantly smaller and less intricate than many other nobles&#x27;. Around this time she accumulated a library of 5,000 books. Those on music, often dedicated to her, were the most read, though she also liked to read history.

She sponsored the arts, in particular music. Marie Antoinette preferred to hold her musicales in the salon of her &quot;Petit appartement de la reine&quot; in the Palace of Versailles, or in the Théâtre de la Reine. She limited the audience to her intimate circle and a few musicians, among them the Chevalier de Saint-Georges. &quot;Admitted to perform music with the Queen,&quot; Saint-Georges probably played his violin sonatas for two instruments, with Her Majesty playing the fortepiano. She also supported some scientific endeavours, encouraging and witnessing the first launch of a &quot;Montgolfière&quot;, a hot air balloon for the first time in human history; this extraordinary feat which represented a turning point in human civilization was done by Jean-François Pilâtre de Rozier.

On 27 April 1784, Pierre Beaumarchais&#x27;s play &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; premiered in Paris. Initially banned by the king due to its negative portrayal of the nobility, the play was finally allowed to be publicly performed because of the Queen&#x27;s support and its overwhelming popularity at court, where secret readings of it had been given by Marie Antoinette. The play was a disaster for the image of the monarchy and aristocracy. It inspired Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;, which premiered in Vienna on 1 May 1786.
On 24 October 1784, putting the Baron de Breteuil in charge of its acquisition, Louis XVI bought the Château de Saint-Cloud from Louis Philippe I, Duke of Orléans in the name of his wife, which she wanted due to their expanding family. She wanted to be able to own her own property, one that was actually hers, to then have the authority to bequeath it to &quot;whichever of my children I wish,&quot; choosing the child she thought could use it rather than it going through patriarchal inheritance laws or whims. It was proposed that the cost could be covered by other sales, such as that of the &quot;château Trompette&quot; in Bordeaux. This was unpopular, particularly with those factions of the nobility who disliked the Queen, but also with a growing percentage of the population, who disapproved of a queen of France independently owning a private residence. The purchase of Saint-Cloud thus damaged the public&#x27;s image of the Queen even further. The château&#x27;s high price, almost 6 million livres, plus the substantial extra cost of redecorating, ensured that much less money was going towards repaying France&#x27;s substantial debt.

On 27 March 1785, Marie Antoinette gave birth to a second son, Louis Charles, who bore the title of Duke of Normandy. The fact that the birth occurred exactly nine months after Fersen&#x27;s return did not escape the attention of many, leading to doubt as to the parentage of the child and to a noticeable decline of the Queen&#x27;s reputation in public opinion. The majority of Marie Antoinette&#x27;s and Louis XVII&#x27;s biographers believe that the young prince was the biological son of Louis XVI, including Stefan Zweig and Antonia Fraser, who believe that Fersen and Marie Antoinette were indeed romantically involved. Fraser has also noted that the birthdate matches up perfectly with a known conjugal visit from the King.

Courtiers at Versailles noted in their diaries that the date of the child&#x27;s conception corresponded perfectly with a period when the King and the Queen had spent much time together, but these details were ignored amid attacks on the Queen&#x27;s character. These suspicions of illegitimacy, along with the continued publication of the &quot;libelles&quot; and never-ending cavalcades of court intrigues, the actions of Joseph II in the Kettle War, the purchase of Saint-Cloud and the Affair of the Diamond Necklace combined to turn popular opinion sharply against the Queen, and the image of a licentious, spendthrift, empty-headed foreign queen was quickly taking root in the French psyche.

A second daughter, her last child, Marie Sophie Hélène Béatrix, &quot;Madame Sophie&quot;, was born on 9 July 1786 and lived only eleven months until 19 June 1787. She was named after the King&#x27;s aunt, Princess Sophie of France.

===Prelude to the Revolution: scandals and the failure of reforms (1786–1789)===
====Diamond necklace scandal====
Marie Antoinette began to abandon her more carefree activities to become increasingly involved in politics in her role as queen of France. By publicly showing her attention to the education and care of her children, the queen sought to improve the dissolute image she had acquired in 1785 from the &quot;Diamond Necklace Affair&quot;, in which public opinion had falsely accused her of criminal participation in defrauding the jewelers Boehmer and Bassenge of the price of an expensive diamond necklace they had originally created for Madame du Barry.

The main actors in the scandal were Cardinal de Rohan, Prince de Rohan-Guéméné, Grand Almoner of France, and Jeanne de Valois-Saint-Rémy, Countess de La Motte, a descendant of an illegitimate child of Henry II of France of the House of Valois. Marie Antoinette had profoundly disliked Rohan since the time he had been the French ambassador to Vienna when she was a child. Despite his high clerical position at the Court, she never addressed a word to him. Others involved were Nicole Lequay, alias &quot;Baronne d&#x27;Oliva&quot;, a prostitute who happened to look like Marie Antoinette; Rétaux de Villette, a forger; Alessandro Cagliostro, an Italian adventurer; and the Count de La Motte, Jeanne de Valois&#x27; husband. Madame de La Motte tricked Rohan into buying the necklace as a gift to Marie Antoinette, for him to gain the queen&#x27;s favour.

When the affair was discovered, those involved, except de La Motte and Rétaux de Villette, who both managed to flee, were arrested, tried, convicted, and either imprisoned or exiled. Madame de La Motte was sentenced for life to confinement in the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, which also served as a prison for women. Judged by the Parlement of Paris, Rohan was found innocent of any wrongdoing and allowed to leave the Bastille. Marie Antoinette, who had insisted on the arrest of the Cardinal, was dealt a heavy personal blow, as was the monarchy, and despite the fact that the guilty parties were tried and convicted, the affair proved to be extremely damaging to her reputation, which never recovered from it.

====Failure of political and financial reforms====
Suffering from an acute case of depression, the King began to seek the advice of his wife. In her new role and with increasing political power, the Queen tried to improve the awkward situation brewing between the Parlement and the King. This change of the queen&#x27;s position signaled the end of the Polignacs&#x27; influence and their impact on the finances of the Crown.

Continuing deterioration of the financial situation despite cutbacks to the royal retinue and court expenses ultimately forced the King, the Queen and the Controller-General of Finances, Charles Alexandre de Calonne, at the urging of Vergennes, to call a session of the Assembly of Notables, after a hiatus of 160 years. The assembly was held for the purpose of initiating necessary financial reforms, but the Assembly refused to cooperate. The first meeting took place on 22 February 1787, nine days after the death of Vergennes on 13 February. Marie Antoinette did not attend the meeting and her absence resulted in accusations that the Queen was trying to undermine its purpose. The Assembly was a failure. It did not pass any reforms and, instead, fell into a pattern of defying the King. On the urging of the Queen, Louis XVI dismissed Calonne on 8 April 1787.

On 1 May 1787 Étienne Charles de Loménie de Brienne, Archbishop of Toulouse and one of the queen&#x27;s political allies was appointed by the King at her urging to replace Calonne, first as Controller-General of Finances and then as Chief Minister. He began to institute more cutbacks at court while trying to restore the royal absolute power weakened by the Parlement. Brienne was unable to improve the financial situation, and since he was the Queen&#x27;s ally, this failure adversely affected her political position. The continued poor financial climate of the country resulted in the 25 May dissolution of the Assembly of Notables because of its inability to function, and the lack of solutions was blamed on the Queen.

France&#x27;s financial problems were the result of a combination of factors: several expensive wars; a large royal family whose expenditures were paid for by the state; and an unwillingness on the part of most members of the privileged classes, aristocracy, and clergy, to help defray the costs of the government out of their own pockets by relinquishing some of their financial privileges. As a result of the public perception that she had single-handedly ruined the national finances, Marie Antoinette was given the nickname of &quot;Madame Déficit&quot; in the summer of 1787. While the sole fault for the financial crisis did not lie with her, Marie Antoinette was the biggest obstacle to any major reform effort. She had played a decisive role in the disgrace of the reformer ministers of finance, Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot (in 1776), and Jacques Necker (first dismissal in 1781). If the secret expenses of the Queen were taken into account, court expenses were much higher than the official estimate of 7% of the state budget.

The queen attempted to fight back with propaganda portraying her as a caring mother, most notably in the painting by Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun exhibited at the &quot;Royal Académie Salon de Paris&quot; in August 1787, showing her with her children. Around the same time, Jeanne de Valois-Saint-Rémy escaped from prison and fled to London, where she published damaging slander concerning her supposed amorous affair with the Queen.

The political situation in 1787 worsened when, at Marie Antoinette&#x27;s urging, the &quot;Parlement of Paris&quot; was exiled to Troyes on 15 August. It further deteriorated when Louis XVI tried to use a &quot;lit de justice&quot; on 11 November to impose legislation. The new Duke of Orléans publicly protested the king&#x27;s actions, and was subsequently exiled to his Château de Villers-Cotterêts. The May Edicts issued on 8 May 1788 were also opposed by the public and parlement. Finally, on 8 August, Louis XVI announced his intention to bring back the Estates General, the traditional elected legislature of the country, which had not been convened since 1614.

While from late 1787 up to his death in June 1789 Marie Antoinette&#x27;s primary concern was the continued deterioration of the health of the Dauphin, who suffered from tuberculosis, she was directly involved in the exile of the &quot;Parlement&quot;, the May Edicts, and the announcement regarding the Estates General. She did participate in the King Council, the first queen to do this in over 175 years (since Marie de&#x27; Medici had been named &quot;Chef du Conseil du Roi&quot;, between 1614 and 1617), and she was making the major decisions behind the scene and in the Royal Council.

Marie Antoinette was instrumental in the reinstatement of Jacques Necker as Finance Minister on 26 August 1788, a popular move, even though she herself was worried that it would go against her if Necker proved unsuccessful in reforming the country&#x27;s finances. She accepted Necker&#x27;s proposition to double the representation of the Third Estate (&quot;tiers état&quot;) in an attempt to check the power of the aristocracy.

On the eve of the opening of the Estates General the Queen attended the mass celebrating its return. As soon as it opened on 5 May 1789, the fracture between the democratic Third Estate (consisting of bourgeois and radical aristocrats) and the conservative nobility of the Second Estate widened, and Marie Antoinette knew that her rival, the Duke of Orléans, who had given money and bread to the people during the winter, would be acclaimed by the crowd, much to her detriment.

The death of the Dauphin on 4 June, which deeply affected his parents, was virtually ignored by the French people, who were instead preparing for the next meeting of the Estates General and hoping for a resolution to the bread crisis. As the Third Estate declared itself a National Assembly and took the Tennis Court Oath, and as people either spread or believed rumours that the Queen wished to bathe in their blood, Marie Antoinette went into mourning for her eldest son. Her role was decisive in urging the King to remain firm and not concede to popular demands for reforms. In addition, she showed her determination to use force to crush the forthcoming revolution.

==French Revolution before Varennes (1789–1791)==
The situation escalated on 20 June as the Third Estate, which had been joined by several members of the clergy and radical nobility, found the door to its appointed meeting place closed by order of the King. It thus met at the tennis court in Versailles and took the Tennis Court Oath not to separate before it had given a constitution to the nation.

On 11 July at Marie Antoinette&#x27;s urging, Necker was dismissed and replaced by Breteuil, the queen&#x27;s choice to crush the Revolution with mercenary Swiss troops under the command of one of her favourites, Pierre Victor, Baron de Besenval de Brünstatt. At the news, Paris was besieged by riots that culminated in the storming of the Bastille on 14 July. On 15 July Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette was named commander-in-chief of the newly formed National Guard.

In the days following the storming of the Bastille, for fear of assassination, and ordered by the King, the emigration of members of the high aristocracy began on 17 July with the departure of the Count of Artois, the Condés, cousins of the King, and the unpopular Polignacs. Marie Antoinette, whose life was as much in danger, remained with the King, whose power was gradually being taken away by the National Constituent Assembly.

The abolition of feudal privileges by the National Constituent Assembly on 4 August 1789 and the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (&quot;La Déclaration des Droits de l&#x27;Homme et du Citoyen&quot;), drafted by Lafayette with the help of Thomas Jefferson and adopted on 26 August, paved the way to a Constitutional Monarchy (4 September 1791 – 21 September 1792). Despite these dramatic changes, life at the court continued, while the situation in Paris was becoming critical because of bread shortages in September. On 5 October, a crowd from Paris descended upon Versailles and forced the royal family to move to the Tuileries Palace in Paris, where they lived under a form of house arrest under the watch of Lafayette&#x27;s National Guard, while the Count of Provence and his wife were allowed to reside in the Petit Luxembourg, where they remained until they went into exile on 20 June 1791.

Marie Antoinette continued to perform charitable functions and attend religious ceremonies, but dedicated most of her time to her children. She also played an important political, albeit not public, role between 1789 and 1791 when she had a complex set of relationships with several key actors of the early period of the French Revolution. One of the most important was Necker, the Prime Minister of Finances (&quot;Premier ministre des finances&quot;). Despite her dislike of him, she played a decisive role in his return to the office. She blamed him for his support of the Revolution and did not regret his resignation in 1790.

Lafayette, one of the former military leaders in the American War of Independence (1775–1783), served as the warden of the royal family in his position as commander-in-chief of the National Guard. Despite his dislike of the Queen—he detested her as much as she detested him and at one time had even threatened to send her to a convent—he was persuaded by the mayor of Paris, Jean Sylvain Bailly, to work and collaborate with her, and allowed her to see Fersen a number of times. He even went as far as exiling the Duke of Orléans, who was accused by the queen of fomenting trouble. His relationship with the King was more cordial. As a liberal aristocrat, he did not want the fall of the monarchy but rather the establishment of a liberal one, similar to that of Great Britain, based on cooperation between the King and the people, as was to be defined in the Constitution of 1791.

Despite her attempts to remain out of the public eye, Marie Antoinette was falsely accused in the &quot;libelles&quot; of having an affair with Lafayette, whom she loathed. Publication of such calumnies continued to the end, climaxing at her trial with an accusation of incest with her son. There is no evidence to support the accusations.

===Mirabeau===
A significant achievement of Marie Antoinette in that period was the establishment of an alliance with Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, Comte de Mirabeau, the most important lawmaker in the assembly. Like Lafayette, Mirabeau was a liberal aristocrat. He had joined the Third Estate and was not against the monarchy, but wanted to reconcile it with the Revolution. He also wanted to be a minister and was not immune to corruption. On the advice of Mercy, Marie Antoinette opened secret negotiations with him and both agreed to meet privately at the Château de Saint-Cloud on 3 July 1790, where the royal family was allowed to spend the summer, free of the radical elements who watched their every move in Paris. At the meeting, Mirabeau was much impressed by the queen, and remarked in a letter to Auguste Marie Raymond d&#x27;Arenberg, Comte de la Marck, that she was the only person the King had by him: &quot;La Reine est le seul homme que le Roi ait auprès de Lui.&quot; An agreement was reached turning Mirabeau into one of her political allies: Marie Antoinette promised to pay him 6000 livres per month and one million if he succeeded in his mission to restore the King&#x27;s authority.

The only time the royal couple returned to Paris in that period was on 14 July to attend the &quot;Fête de la Fédération&quot;, an official ceremony held at the Champ de Mars in commemoration of the fall of the Bastille one year earlier. At least 300,000 persons participated from all over France, including 18,000 National Guards, with Talleyrand, bishop of Autun, celebrating a mass at the &quot;autel de la Patrie&quot; (&quot;altar of the fatherland&quot;). The King was greeted at the event with loud cheers of &quot;Long live the King!&quot;, especially when he took the oath to protect the nation and to enforce the laws voted by the Constitutional Assembly. There were even cheers for the Queen, particularly when she presented the dauphin to the public.

Mirabeau sincerely wanted to reconcile the Queen with the people, and she was happy to see him restoring much of the King&#x27;s powers, such as his authority over foreign policy, and the right to declare war. Over the objections of Lafayette and his allies, the King was given a suspensive veto allowing him to veto any laws for a period of four years. With time, Mirabeau would support the Queen, even more, going as far as to suggest that Louis XVI &quot;adjourn&quot; to Rouen or Compiègne. This leverage with the Assembly ended with the death of Mirabeau in April 1791, despite the attempt of several moderate leaders of the Revolution to contact the queen to establish some basis of cooperation with her.

===Civil Constitution of the Clergy===
In March 1791 Pope Pius VI had condemned the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, reluctantly signed by Louis XVI, which reduced the number of bishops from 132 to 93, imposed the election of bishops and all members of the clergy by departmental or district assemblies of electors, and reduced the pope&#x27;s authority over the Church. Religion played an important role in the life of Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI, both raised in the Roman Catholic faith. The Queen&#x27;s political ideas and her belief in the absolute power of monarchs were based on France&#x27;s long-established tradition of the divine right of kings.

On 18 April, as the royal family prepared to leave for Saint-Cloud to attend Easter mass celebrated by a refractory priest, a crowd, soon joined by the National Guard (disobeying Lafayette&#x27;s orders), prevented their departure from Paris, prompting Marie Antoinette to declare to Lafayette that she and her family were no longer free. This incident fortified her in her determination to leave Paris for personal and political reasons, not alone, but with her family. Even the King, who had been hesitant, accepted his wife&#x27;s decision to flee with the help of foreign powers and counter-revolutionary forces. Fersen and Breteuil, who represented her in the courts of Europe, were put in charge of the escape plan, while Marie Antoinette continued her negotiations with some of the moderate leaders of the French Revolution.

==Flight, arrest at Varennes and return to Paris (21–25 June 1791)==

There had been several plots designed to help the royal family escape, which the Queen had rejected because she would not leave without the King, or which had ceased to be viable because of the King&#x27;s indecision. Once Louis XVI finally did commit to a plan, its poor execution was the cause of its failure. In an elaborate attempt known as the Flight to Varennes to reach the royalist stronghold of Montmédy, some members of the royal family were to pose as the servants of an imaginary &quot;Mme de Korff&quot;, a wealthy Russian baroness, a role played by Louise-Élisabeth de Croÿ de Tourzel, governess of the royal children.

After many delays, the escape was ultimately attempted on 21 June 1791, but the entire family was arrested less than 24 hours later at Varennes and taken back to Paris within a week. The escape attempt destroyed much of the remaining support of the population for the King.

Upon learning of the capture of the royal family, the National Constituent Assembly sent three representatives, Antoine Barnave, Jérôme Pétion de Villeneuve and Charles César de Fay de La Tour-Maubourg to Varennes to escort Marie Antoinette and her family back to Paris. On the way to the capital they were jeered and insulted by the people as never before. The prestige of the French monarchy had never been at such a low level. During the trip, Barnave, the representative of the moderate party in the Assembly, protected Marie Antoinette from the crowds, and even Pétion took pity on the royal family. Brought safely back to Paris, they were met with total silence by the crowd. Thanks to Barnave, the royal couple was not brought to trial and was publicly exonerated of any crime in relation with the attempted escape.

Marie Antoinette&#x27;s first Lady of the Bedchamber, Jeanne-Louise-Henriette Campan, wrote about what happened to the Queen&#x27;s hair on the night of 21–22 June, &quot;...in a single night, it had turned white as that of a seventy-year-old woman.&quot; (&quot;En une seule nuit ils étaient devenus blancs comme ceux d&#x27;une femme de soixante-dix ans.&quot;)

==Radicalization of the Revolution after Varennes (1791–1792)==
After their return from Varennes and until the storming of the Tuileries on 10 August 1792, the Queen, her family and entourage were held under tight surveillance by the National Guard in the Tuileries, where the royal couple was guarded night and day. Four guards accompanied the Queen wherever she went, and her bedroom door had to be left open at night. Her health also began to deteriorate, thus further reducing her physical activities.

On 17 July 1791, with the support of Barnave and his friends, Lafayette&#x27;s &quot;Garde Nationale&quot; opened fire on the crowd that had assembled on the Champ de Mars to sign a petition demanding the deposition of the King. The estimated number of those killed varies between 12 and 50. Lafayette&#x27;s reputation never recovered from the event and, on 8 October, he resigned as commander of the National Guard. Their enmity continuing, Marie Antoinette played a decisive role in defeating him in his aims to become the mayor of Paris in November 1791.

As her correspondence shows, while Barnave was taking great political risks in the belief that the Queen was his political ally and had managed, despite her unpopularity, to secure a moderate majority ready to work with her, Marie Antoinette was not considered sincere in her cooperation with the moderate leaders of the French Revolution, which ultimately ended any chance to establish a moderate government. Moreover, the view that the unpopular queen was controlling the King further degraded the royal couple&#x27;s standing with the people, which the Jacobins successfully exploited after their return from Varennes to advance their radical agenda to abolish the monarchy. This situation lasted until the spring of 1792.

Marie Antoinette continued to hope that the military coalition of European kingdoms would succeed in crushing the Revolution. She counted most on the support of her Austrian family. After the death of her brother Joseph II in 1790, his successor and younger brother, Leopold II, was willing to support her to a limited degree. It was her hope that the threat of Austria&#x27;s advancing military would deter further escalation of revolutionary violence. In a letter to her brother, penned in September 1791, Marie Antoinette expressed how she expected the revolution to react: &quot;...it will be effected by the approach of the war and not by the war itself. The King, his powers restored, will be entrusted with negotiations with the foreign powers, and the princes will return, in the general tranquillity, to reassume their ranks at his court and in the nation.&quot; In the same letter, she wrote that the fall of France&#x27;s monarchy and the subsequent rise of revolutionary principles would be &quot;destructive to all governments.&quot;

Upon Leopold&#x27;s death in 1792, his son, Francis, a conservative ruler, was ready to support the cause of the French royal couple more vigorously because he feared the consequences of the French Revolution and its ideas for the monarchies of Europe, particularly, for Austria&#x27;s influence in the continent.

Barnave had advised the Queen to call back Mercy, who had played such an important role in her life before the Revolution, but Mercy had been appointed to another foreign diplomatic position and could not return to France. At the end of 1791, ignoring the danger she faced, the &quot;Princesse de Lamballe&quot;, who was in London, returned to the Tuileries. As for Fersen, despite the strong restrictions imposed on the Queen, he was able to see her a final time in February 1792.

==Events leading to the abolition of the monarchy on 10 August 1792==
Leopold&#x27;s and Francis II&#x27;s strong action on behalf of Marie Antoinette led to France&#x27;s declaration of war on Austria on 20 April 1792. This resulted in the Queen being viewed as an enemy, although she was personally against Austrian claims to French territories on European soil. That summer, the situation was compounded by multiple defeats of the French Revolutionary Army by the Austrians, in part because Marie Antoinette passed on military secrets to them. In addition, at the insistence of his wife, Louis XVI vetoed several measures that would have further restricted his power, earning the royal couple the nicknames &quot;Monsieur Veto&quot; and &quot;Madame Veto&quot;, nicknames then prominently featured in different contexts, including La Carmagnole.

Barnave remained the most important advisor and supporter of the Queen, who was willing to work with him as long as he met her demands, which he did to a large extent. Barnave and the moderates comprised about 260 lawmakers in the new Legislative Assembly; the radicals numbered around 136, and the rest around 350. Initially, the majority was with Barnave, but the Queen&#x27;s policies led to the radicalization of the Assembly and the moderates lost control of the legislative process. The moderate government collapsed in April 1792 to be replaced by a radical majority headed by the &quot;Girondins&quot;. The Assembly then passed a series of laws concerning the Church, the aristocracy and the formation of new National Guard units; all were vetoed by Louis XVI. While Barnave&#x27;s faction had dropped to 120 members, the new &quot;Girondin&quot; majority controlled the legislative assembly with 330 members. The two strongest members of that government were Jean Marie Roland, who was minister of interior, and General Charles François Dumouriez, the minister of foreign affairs. Dumouriez sympathized with the royal couple and wanted to save them but he was rebuffed by the Queen.

Marie Antoinette&#x27;s actions in refusing to collaborate with the &quot;Girondins&quot;, in power between April and June 1792, led them to denounce the treason of the Austrian comity, a direct allusion to the Queen. After Madame Roland sent a letter to the King denouncing the Queen&#x27;s role in these matters, urged by the Queen, Louis XVI disbanded the government, thus losing his majority in the Assembly. Dumouriez resigned and refused a post in any new government. At this point, the tide against royal authority intensified in the population and political parties, while Marie Antoinette encouraged the King to veto the new laws voted by the Legislative Assembly in 1792. In August 1791, the Declaration of Pillnitz threatened an invasion of France. This led in turn to a French declaration of war in April 1792, which led to the French Revolutionary Wars and to the events of August 1792, which ended the monarchy.

On 20 June 1792, &quot;a mob of terrifying aspect&quot; broke into the Tuileries, made the King wear the &quot;bonnet rouge&quot; (red Phrygian cap) to show his loyalty to the Revolution, insulted Marie Antoinette, accusing her of betraying France, and threatened her life. In consequence, the Queen asked Fersen to urge the foreign powers to carry out their plans to invade France and to issue a manifesto in which they threatened to destroy Paris if anything happened to the royal family. The Brunswick Manifesto, issued on 25 July 1792, triggered the Insurrection of 10 August when the approach of an armed mob on its way to the Tuileries Palace forced the royal family to seek refuge at the Legislative Assembly. Ninety minutes later, the palace was invaded by the mob, who massacred the Swiss Guards. On 13 August the royal family was imprisoned in the tower of the Temple in the Marais under conditions considerably harsher than those of their previous confinement in the Tuileries.

A week later, several of the royal family&#x27;s attendants, among them the &quot;Princesse de Lamballe&quot;, were taken for interrogation by the Paris Commune. Transferred to the La Force Prison, after a rapid judgment, Marie Louise de Lamballe was savagely killed on 3 September. Her head was affixed on a pike and paraded through the city to the Temple for the Queen to see. Marie Antoinette was prevented from seeing it, but fainted upon learning of it.

On 21 September 1792, France was declared a republic, the monarchy was abolished and the National Convention became the governing body of the French First Republic. The royal family name was downgraded to the non-royal &quot;Capets&quot;. Preparations began for the trial of the former king in a court of law.

===Louis XVI&#x27;s trial and execution===

Charged with treason against the French Republic, Louis XVI was separated from his family and tried in December. He was found guilty by the Convention, led by the Jacobins who rejected the idea of keeping him as a hostage. On 15 January 1793, by a majority of six votes, he was condemned to death by guillotine and executed on 21 January 1793.

==Marie Antoinette in the Temple==
The former queen, now called &quot;Widow Capet&quot;, plunged into deep mourning. She still hoped her son Louis-Charles, whom the exiled Count of Provence, Louis XVI&#x27;s brother, had recognized as Louis XVI&#x27;s successor, would one day rule France. The royalists and the refractory clergy, including those preparing the insurrection in Vendée, supported Marie Antoinette and the return to the monarchy. Throughout her imprisonment and up to her execution, Marie Antoinette could count on the sympathy of conservative factions and social-religious groups which had turned against the Revolution, and also on wealthy individuals ready to bribe republican officials to facilitate her escape. These plots all failed. While imprisoned in the Tower of the Temple, Marie Antoinette, her children and Élisabeth were insulted, some of the guards going as far as blowing smoke in the former queen&#x27;s face. Strict security measures were taken to assure that Marie Antoinette was not able to communicate with the outside world. Despite these measures, several of her guards were open to bribery and a line of communication was kept with the outside world.

After Louis&#x27;s execution, Marie Antoinette&#x27;s fate became a central question of the National Convention. While some advocated her death, others proposed exchanging her for French prisoners of war or for a ransom from the Holy Roman Emperor. Thomas Paine advocated exile to America. In April 1793, during the Reign of Terror, a Committee of Public Safety, dominated by Maximilien Robespierre, was formed, and men such as Jacques Hébert began to call for Marie Antoinette&#x27;s trial. By the end of May, the &quot;Girondins&quot; had been chased from power. Calls were also made to &quot;retrain&quot; the eight-year-old Louis XVII, to make him pliant to revolutionary ideas. To carry this out, Louis Charles was separated from his mother on 3 July after a struggle during which his mother fought in vain to retain her son, who was handed over to Antoine Simon, a cobbler and representative of the Paris Commune. Until her removal from the Temple, Marie Antoinette spent hours trying to catch a glimpse of her son, who, within weeks, had been made to turn against her, accusing his mother of wrongdoing.

===Conciergerie===
On the night of 1 August, at 1:00 in the morning, Marie Antoinette was transferred from the Temple to an isolated cell in the Conciergerie as &#x27;Prisoner nº 280&#x27;. Leaving the Tower she bumped her head against the lintel of a door, which prompted one of her guards to ask her if she was hurt, to which she answered, &quot;No! Nothing now can hurt me.&quot; This was the most difficult period of her captivity. She was under constant surveillance with no privacy. The &quot;Carnation Plot&quot; (), an attempt to help her escape at the end of August, was foiled due to the inability to corrupt all the guards. She was attended by Rosalie Lamorlière, who took care of her as much as she could. At least once she received a visit by a Catholic priest.

==Trial and execution (14–16 October 1793)==
Marie Antoinette was tried by the Revolutionary Tribunal on 14 October 1793. Some historians believe the outcome of the trial had been decided in advance by the Committee of Public Safety around the time the Carnation Plot was uncovered. She and her lawyers were given less than one day to prepare her defense. Among the accusations, many previously published in the &quot;libelles&quot;, were: orchestrating orgies in Versailles, sending millions of livres of treasury money to Austria, planning the massacre of the National Guards in 1792, declaring her son to be the new king of France, and incest, a charge made by her son Louis-Charles, pressured into doing so by the radical Jacques Hébert who controlled him.

This last accusation drew an emotional response from Marie Antoinette, who refused to respond to this charge, instead appealing to all mothers present in the room. Their reaction comforted her since these women were not otherwise sympathetic to her. Upon being pressed further by a juror to address the accusations of incest, the queen replied, &quot;If I did not respond, it was because it would be against nature for a mother to reply to such an accusation. On this I appeal to all mothers who may be here.&quot; When a juror, Joachim Vilate, told Robespierre of this over dinner, Robespierre broke his plate in anger, declaring &quot;That imbecile Hébert!&quot;

Early on 16 October, Marie Antoinette was declared guilty of the three main charges against her: depletion of the national treasury, conspiracy against the internal and external security of the State, and high treason because of her intelligence activities in the interest of the enemy; the latter charge alone was enough to condemn her to death. At worst, she and her lawyers had expected life imprisonment. In the hours left to her, she composed a letter to her sister-in-law Madame Élisabeth, affirming her clear conscience, her Catholic faith, and her love and concern for her children. The letter did not reach Élisabeth. Her will was part of the collection of papers of Robespierre found under his bed and was published by Edme-Bonaventure Courtois.

Preparing for her execution, she had to change clothes in front of her guards. She wanted to wear a black dress but was forced to wear a plain white dress, white being the colour worn by widowed queens of France. Her hair was shorn, her hands bound painfully behind her back and she was put on a rope leash. Unlike her husband, who had been taken to his execution in a carriage (&quot;carrosse&quot;), she had to sit in an open cart (&quot;charrette&quot;) for the hour it took to convey her from the Conciergerie via the rue Saint-Honoré thoroughfare to reach the guillotine erected in the Place de la Révolution, the present-day Place de la Concorde. She maintained her composure, despite the insults of the jeering crowd. A constitutional priest was assigned to hear her final confession. He sat by her in the cart, but she ignored him all the way to the scaffold as he had pledged his allegiance to the republic.

Marie Antoinette was executed by beheading by guillotine at 12:15pm on 16 October 1793 during the French Revolution. Her last words are recorded as, &quot;Pardonnez-moi, monsieur. Je ne l&#x27;ai pas fait exprès&quot; or &quot;Pardon me, sir, I did not do it on purpose&quot;, after accidentally stepping on her executioner&#x27;s shoe. Marie Tussaud was employed to make a death mask of her head. Her body was thrown into an unmarked grave in the Madeleine cemetery, located close by in rue d&#x27;Anjou. Because its capacity was exhausted, the cemetery was closed the following year, on 25 March 1794.

===Foreign response===
After her execution, Marie Antoinette became a symbol abroad, and a controversial figure of the French Revolution. Some used her as a scapegoat to blame for the events of the Revolution. Thomas Jefferson, writing in 1821, claimed that &quot;Her inordinate gambling and dissipations, with those of the Count d&#x27;Artois, and others of her clique, had been a sensible item in the exhaustion of the treasury, which called into action the reforming hand of the nation; and her opposition to it, her inflexible perverseness, and dauntless spirit, led herself to the Guillotine,&quot; adding that &quot;I have ever believed that, had there been no Queen, there would have been no revolution.&quot;

In his 1790 treatise, &quot;Reflections on the Revolution in France&quot;, which was written during Marie Antoinette&#x27;s imprisonment in Paris, but prior to her execution, Edmund Burke lamented that &quot;the age of chivalry is gone. That of sophisters, economists, and calculators has succeeded, and the glory of Europe is extinguished forever&quot; and now &quot;Never, never more, shall we behold that generous loyalty to rank and sex.&quot; After receiving the news, Maria Carolina, Queen of Naples and close sister to Marie Antoinette, spiraled into a state of mourning and an anger against the revolutionaries. She quickly suspended protections of reformers and intellectuals in Naples, allowed Neapolitan bishops wide latitude to halt the secularization of the country, and offered succor to the overflowing number of &quot;émigrés&quot; fleeing from revolutionary France, many of whom were granted pensions.

===Bourbon Restoration===
Both Marie Antoinette&#x27;s and Louis XVI&#x27;s bodies were exhumed on 18 January 1815, during the Bourbon Restoration, when the Count of Provence ascended the newly reestablished throne as Louis XVIII, King of France and of Navarre. Christian burial of the royal remains took place three days later, on 21 January, in the necropolis of French kings at the Basilica of Saint-Denis.

==Legacy==
For many revolutionary figures, Marie Antoinette was the symbol of what was wrong with the old regime in France. The onus of having caused the financial difficulties of the nation was placed on her shoulders by the revolutionary tribunal, and under the new republican ideas of what it meant to be a member of a nation, her Austrian descent and continued correspondence with the competing nation made her a traitor. The people of France saw her death as a necessary step toward completing the revolution. Furthermore, her execution was seen as a sign that the revolution had done its work.

Marie Antoinette is also known for her taste for fine things, and her commissions from famous craftsmen, such as Jean Henri Riesener, suggest more about her enduring legacy as a woman of taste and patronage. For instance, a writing table attributed to Riesener, now located at Waddesdon Manor, bears witness to Marie Antoinette&#x27;s desire to escape the oppressive formality of court life, when she decided to move the table from the queen&#x27;s boudoir, de la Meridienne, at Versailles to her humble interior, the Petit Trianon. Her favourite objects filled her small, private chateau and reveal aspects of Marie Antoinette&#x27;s character that have been obscured by satirical political prints, such as those in Les Tableaux de la Révolution. She owned several instruments. In 1788 she bought a piano made by Sébastien Érard.

A catalog of Marie Antoinette&#x27;s personal library of 736 volumes was published by Paul Lacroix in 1863, using his pseudonym P. L. Jacob. The listed books were from her library at the Petit Trianon, including many found in her boudoir, and mostly consist of novels and plays. A random selection of her books includes &quot;Histoire de Mademoiselle de Terville&quot; by Madeleine d&#x27;Arsant de Puisieux, &quot;Le Philosophe parvenu ou Lettres et pièces originales contenant les aventures d&#x27;Eugène Sans-Pair&quot; by Robert-Martin Lesuire, and &quot;Oeuvres mêlées... contenant des tragédies et différents ouvrages en vers et en prose&quot; by Madeleine-Angélique de Gomez. A larger and more official library belonging to Marie Antoinette was kept at the Tuileries Palace in Paris.

Long after her death, Marie Antoinette remains a major historical figure linked with conservatism, the Catholic Church, wealth and fashion. She has been the subject of a number of books, films, and other media. Politically engaged authors have deemed her the quintessential representative of class conflict, western aristocracy and absolutism. Some of her contemporaries, such as Thomas Jefferson, attributed to her the start of the French Revolution.

==In popular culture==

The phrase &quot;let them eat cake&quot; is often conventionally attributed to Marie Antoinette, but there is no evidence that she ever uttered it, and it is now generally regarded as a journalistic cliché. This phrase originally appeared in Book VI of the first part of Jean-Jacques Rousseau&#x27;s autobiographical work &quot;Les Confessions&quot;, finished in 1767 and published in 1782: &quot;Enfin Je me rappelai le pis-aller d&#x27;une grande Princesse à qui l&#x27;on disait que les paysans n&#x27;avaient pas de pain, et qui répondit: Qu&#x27;ils mangent de la brioche&quot; (&quot;Finally I recalled the stopgap solution of a great princess who was told that the peasants had no bread, and who responded: &#x27;Let them eat brioche). Rousseau ascribes these words to a &quot;great princess&quot;, but the purported writing date precedes Marie Antoinette&#x27;s arrival in France. Some think that he invented it altogether.

In the United States, expressions of gratitude to France for its help in the American Revolution included naming a city Marietta, Ohio, in 1788. Her life has been the subject of many films, such as &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot; (1938) and &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot; (2006). There is a book about Marie Antoinette by Antonia Fraser called &quot;Marie Antoinette: The Journey&quot;.

In 2020, a silk shoe that belonged to her was sold in an auction in the Palace of Versailles for 43,750 euros ($51,780).

In 2022, her story was dramatised by a Canal+ and BBC English-language television series.

In the 2024 Summer Olympics opening ceremony in Paris, heavy metal band Gojira&#x27;s performance showed a depiction of the freshly severed head of Marie Antoinette singing, in reference to the French Revolution.

Notes:
Solid vertical lines indicate parent-child relationship, while dashed lines represent more distant ancestor-descendant connections.


==Children==


In addition to her biological children, Marie Antoinette adopted four children: &quot;Armand&quot; Francois-Michel Gagné, a poor orphan adopted in 1776; Jean Amilcar, a Senegalese slave boy given to the queen as a present by Chevalier de Boufflers in 1787, but whom she instead freed, baptized, adopted and placed in a pension; Ernestine Lambriquet, daughter of two servants at the palace, who was raised as the playmate of her daughter Marie-Thérèse and whom she adopted after the death of her mother in 1788; and &quot;Zoe&quot; Jeanne Louise Victoire, who was adopted in 1790 along with her two older sisters when her parents, an usher and his wife in service of the King, had died.

Of these, only Armand, Ernestine, and Zoe actually lived with the royal family: Jean Amilcar, along with the elder siblings of Zoe and Armand who were also formally foster children of the royal couple, simply lived at the queen&#x27;s expense until her imprisonment, which proved fatal for at least Amilcar, as he was evicted from the boarding school when the fee was no longer paid, and reportedly starved to death on the street, but in actuality was taken in by one of his teachers, and passed a few years later of illness.

Armand and Zoe had a position which was more similar to that of Ernestine; Armand lived at court with the king and queen until he left them at the outbreak of the Revolution because of his republican sympathies, and Zoe was chosen to be the playmate of the dauphin, just as Ernestine had once been selected as the playmate of Marie-Thérèse, and later sent away to her sisters in a convent boarding school before the Flight to Varennes in 1791.

<text>Lunokhod (, &quot;Moonwalker&quot;) was a series of Soviet robotic lunar rovers designed to land on the Moon between 1969 and 1977. Lunokhod 1 was the first roving remote-controlled robot to land on an extraterrestrial body.

The 1969 Lunokhod 1A (Lunokhod 0, Lunokhod No. 201) was destroyed during launch, the 1970 &quot;Lunokhod 1&quot; and the 1973 &quot;Lunokhod 2&quot; landed on the Moon, and &quot;Lunokhod 3&quot; (Lunokhod No. 205, planned for 1977) was never launched. The successful missions were in operation concurrently with the Zond and Luna series of Moon flyby, orbiter and landing missions.

The Lunokhods were primarily designed to support the Soviet human Moon missions during the Moon race. Instead, they were used as remote-controlled robots for exploration of the lunar surface and returning pictures, after the Apollo human lunar landings and cancellation of the Soviet human Moon programme.

The Lunokhods were transported to the lunar surface by Luna spacecraft, which were launched by Proton-K rockets.

==Development==
Lunokhod&#x27;s original primary mission was to be the back-up for L3 crewed Moon expeditions and for the later Zvezda lunar base. For mission safety, weeks before the human mission on a LK lander, an LK-R uncrewed lander from the L3 lunar expedition complex and two Lunokhod automated rovers would be sent to the Moon for a preliminary study of the surface around LK-R and LK sites, to act as radio beacons for precision landings of LK-R and LK, and for a visual evaluation of the status of the site.

In mid-1968, at the facility KIP-10 or NIP-10 (КИП-10 or НИП-10, located at ) in the closed town , near Simferopol, Crimea, a lunodrom (лунодром - Moondrome, located at ) was built. It covered an area of one hectare (120 meters by 70 meters) and was very similar to some parts of the lunar surface. It was constructed using more than 3,000 cubic meters of soil, and included 54 craters up to 16 m in diameter and around about 160 rocks of various sizes. The whole area was surrounded with bricks, painted in gray and black. It was used to analyze problems with the Lunokhod chassis and cosmonaut&#x27;s skill to control one. 

Closed town Simferopol-28 contained the most significant tracking facility in the Soviet Union, having the largest number of antennas, the largest area, and the most personnel of any of the Soviet tracking facilities. The facility was one of a network of ten facilities which contain earth satellite vehicle tracking equipment and provide command/control for Soviet near-space civil and military events. Additionally, this facility supported all lunar programmes of the Soviet Union, in association with the Evpatoria Deep Space Tracking Facility.

At least four complete vehicles were constructed, with the serial numbers 201, 203, 204 and 205.

==Rover design==

The Lunokhod rovers were lunar vehicles formed of a tub-like compartment with a large convex lid on eight independently-powered wheels. They were equipped with a cone-shaped antenna, a highly directional helical antenna, television cameras, and special extendable devices to impact the lunar soil for density measurements and mechanical property tests, plus a scientific payload which varied with the mission.

The Lunokhods were designed under the leadership of Georgy Babakin at Lavochkin design bureau. The metal chassis themselves were designed by Alexander Kemurdzhian.

The vehicles were powered by batteries. The rover ran during the lunar day, stopping occasionally to recharge its batteries using its solar panels. The power was supplied during the lunar day by a GaAs solar array on the inside of a round hinged lid which covered the instrument bay, which would charge the batteries when opened. During the lunar nights, the lid was closed and a polonium-210 radioisotope heater unit kept the internal components at operating temperature.

To be able to work in a vacuum a special fluoride-based lubricant was used for the rover&#x27;s mechanical parts, and the electric motors, one in each wheel hub, were enclosed in pressurised containers.

The rovers stood high and had a mass of . It was about long and wide and had eight wheels each with an independent suspension, motor and brake. The rover had two speeds, approximately .

The Lunokhods were transported to the lunar surface by Luna spacecraft, which were launched by Proton-K rockets. The Moon lander part of the Luna spacecraft for Lunokhods was similar to the one for sample-return missions.

==Lunokhod Rovers==

===Lunokhod 201===
After years of secret engineering development and training, the first Lunokhod (vehicle 8ЕЛ№201) was launched on February 19, 1969. Within a few seconds the rocket disintegrated and the first Lunokhod was lost. The rest of the world did not learn of the rocket&#x27;s valuable payload until years later. The failure resulted in the radioactive heat source, polonium 210, being spread over a large region of Russia.

===&quot;Lunokhod 1&quot;===

After the destruction of the original Lunokhod, Soviet engineers began work immediately on another lunar vehicle. &quot;Lunokhod 1&quot; (vehicle 8ЕЛ№203) was the first of two uncrewed lunar rovers successfully landed on the Moon by the Soviet Union as part of its Lunokhod programme. The spacecraft which carried &quot;Lunokhod 1&quot; was named &quot;Luna 17&quot;. &quot;Lunokhod 1&quot; was the first roving remote-controlled robot to land on another world.

&quot;Luna 17&quot; was launched on November 10, 1970 at 14:44:01 UTC. After reaching Earth parking orbit, the final stage of &quot;Luna 17&quot;″s launching rocket fired to place it into a trajectory towards the Moon (November 10, 1970 at 14:54 UTC). After two course correction manoeuvres (on November 12 and 14) it entered lunar orbit on November 15, 1970 at 22:00 UTC.

The spacecraft soft-landed on the Moon in the Sea of Rains on November 17, 1970 at 03:47 UTC. The lander had dual ramps from which the payload, &quot;Lunokhod 1&quot;, could descend to the surface. At 06:28 UT the rover moved down the ramps and onto the Moon.

The rover&#x27;s payload included cameras (two television and four panoramic telephotometers), a RIFMA X-ray fluorescence spectrometer, an RT-1 X-ray telescope, a PrOP odometer/penetrometer, a RV-2N radiation detector, and a TL laser retroreflector.

An urban legend was spread among the Soviet Union that the Lunokhod rover was driven by a “KGB Dwarf”, however it was never explained how supplies were stored to keep them alive for an 11-month mission.

===&quot;Lunokhod 2&quot;===


&quot;Lunokhod 2&quot; (vehicle 8ЕЛ№204) was the second and more advanced of the two Lunokhod rovers. The launcher put the spacecraft into Earth parking orbit on January 8, 1973, followed by a translunar injection. On January 12, 1973, &quot;Luna 21&quot; was braked into a lunar orbit.

The &quot;Luna 21&quot; spacecraft landed on the Moon to deploy the second Soviet lunar rover, &quot;Lunokhod 2&quot;. The primary objectives of the mission were to collect images of the lunar surface, examine ambient light levels to determine the feasibility of astronomical observations from the Moon, perform laser ranging experiments from Earth, observe solar X-rays, measure local magnetic fields, and study mechanical properties of the lunar surface material.

The landing occurred on January 15, 1973 at 23:35 UT in Le Monnier crater (25.85 degrees N, 30.45 degrees E).

After landing the &quot;Lunokhod 2&quot; took television images of the surrounding area, then rolled down a ramp to the surface at 01:14 UT on 1973-01-16. It then took pictures of the &quot;Luna 21&quot; lander and landing site.

The rover was equipped with three slow-scan television cameras, one mounted high on the rover for navigation, which could return high resolution images at different rates—3.2, 5.7, 10.9 or 21.1 seconds per frame (not frames per second). These images were used by the five-man team of controllers on Earth who sent driving commands to the rover in real time. There were four panoramic cameras mounted on the rover.

Scientific instruments included a soil mechanics tester, solar X-ray experiment, an astrophotometer to measure visible and ultraviolet light levels, a magnetometer deployed in front of the rover on the end of a 2.5 m (8 ft 2 in) boom, a radiometer, a photodetector (Rubin-1) for laser detection experiments, and a French-supplied laser corner reflector.

====Payload====
* Cameras (three television and four panoramic telephotometers)
* RIFMA-M X-ray fluorescence spectrometer
* X-ray telescope
* PROP odometer/penetrometer
* RV-2N-LS radiation detector
* TL laser retroreflector
* AF-3L UV/visible astrophotometer
* SG-70A magnetometer
* Rubin 1 photodetector

===&quot;Lunokhod 3&quot;===

Lunokhod 3 (vehicle 8ЕЛ№205) was built for a Moon landing in 1977 as &quot;Luna 25&quot;, but never flew to the Moon due to lack of launchers and funding. It remains at the NPO Lavochkin museum.

==Results==
During its 322 Earth days of operations, &quot;Lunokhod 1&quot; travelled and returned more than 20,000 television images and 206 high-resolution panoramas. In addition, it performed twenty-five soil analyses with its RIFMA x-ray fluorescence spectrometer and used its penetrometer at 500 different locations.

&quot;Lunokhod 2&quot; operated for about four months, covered of terrain, including driving into hilly upland areas and rilles. &quot;Lunokhod 2&quot; held the record for the longest distance of surface travel of any extraterrestrial vehicle until 2014. It sent back 86 panoramic images and over 80,000 television pictures. Many mechanical tests of the Moon&#x27;s surface, laser ranging measurements, and other experiments were completed during this time.

In 2010, nearly forty years after the 1971 loss of signal from &quot;Lunokhod 1&quot;, the NASA Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter photographed its tracks and final location, and researchers, using a telescopic pulsed-laser rangefinder, detected the robot&#x27;s retroreflector.

Not until Mars Pathfinder&#x27;s deployment of the &quot;Sojourner&quot; Rover in 1997 was another remote-controlled vehicle put on an extraterrestrial body. For comparison, the similarly sized NASA Mars Exploration Rovers, &quot;Spirit&quot; and &quot;Opportunity&quot; had, by their fifth anniversary in January 2009, traveled a total of and transmitted over 125,000 images.

==Chernobyl legacy==
According to a French documentary television film &quot;Tank on the Moon&quot; by Jean Afanassieff, the Lunokhod design returned to the limelight 15 years later due to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster on April 26, 1986. The East German-built remote controlled bulldozers available to Soviet civil defense troops weighed dozens of tons too heavy to operate on the remaining parts of the partially collapsed reactor building roof. Human labourers could not be employed to shovel debris since work shifts were limited to 90-second intervals due to intense ionizing radiation.

Lunokhod designers were called back from retirement, and in two weeks rovers were made which used nuclear decay heat sources for internal rack climate control, their electronic systems were already hardened to partly resist radiation. This benefit allowed the 1986 designers to quickly devise a derived vehicle type for nuclear disaster recovery work. On July 15, two rovers, called STR-1, were delivered to the Chernobyl accident zone and proved useful for clearing debris, earning awards for the designers. Due to extremely high radiation levels, both STR-1 rovers eventually failed, and human workers (later named liquidators) were called in once again.

==Locations and ownership==
Until 2010, the final location of &quot;Lunokhod 1&quot; was uncertain by a few kilometers. Lunar laser ranging experiments had failed to detect a return signal from its retroreflector since the 1970s. On March 17, 2010, Albert Abdrakhimov found both the lander and the rover in Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter image M114185541RC. On April 22, Tom Murphy (UCSD) and Russet McMillan at the Apache Point Observatory detected the robot&#x27;s retroreflector using the Apache Point telescopic pulsed-laser rangefinder.

&quot;Lunokhod 2&quot; continues to be detected by lunar laser ranging experiments and its position is known to sub-metre accuracy. Ownership of &quot;Lunokhod 2&quot; and the &quot;Luna 21&quot; lander was sold by the Lavochkin Association for in December 1993 at a Sotheby&#x27;s auction in New York (although the catalogue incorrectly lists lot 68A as &quot;Luna 17/Lunokhod 1&quot;). The buyer was computer gaming entrepreneur and astronaut&#x27;s son Richard Garriott, who is also known by the name of his gaming character Lord British. Garriott stated in a 2001 interview: &quot;I purchased &quot;Lunakod 21&quot; from the Russians. I am now the world&#x27;s only private owner of an object on a foreign celestial body. Though there are international treaties that say no government shall lay claim to geography off planet earth, I am not a government. Summarily, I claim the Moon in the name of Lord British!&quot; In 2007, Garriott said he is still the owner of &quot;Lunokhod 2&quot;.

<text>Lunokhod 1 (Russian: Луноход-1 &quot;Moonwalker 1&quot;), also known as Аппарат 8ЕЛ № 203 (&quot;Device 8EL No. 203&quot;) was the first robotic rover on the Moon and the first to freely move across the surface of an astronomical object beyond the Earth. Sent by the Soviet Union it was part of the robotic rovers Lunokhod program. The &quot;Luna 17&quot; spacecraft carried &quot;Lunokhod 1&quot; to the Moon in 1970. Lunokhod 0 (No.201), the previous and first attempt to land a rover, launched in February 1969 but failed to reach Earth orbit.

Although only designed for a lifetime of three lunar days (approximately three Earth months), &quot;Lunokhod 1&quot; operated on the lunar surface for eleven lunar days (321 Earth days) and traversed a total distance of 10.54 km.

==Rover description==
&quot;Lunokhod 1&quot; was a lunar vehicle formed of a tub-like compartment with a large convex lid on eight independently powered wheels. The rover stood high and had a mass of . It was about long and wide.

&quot;Lunokhod 1&quot; was equipped with a cone-shaped antenna, a highly directional helical antenna, four television cameras, and special extendable devices to test the lunar soil for soil density and mechanical properties. 

An X-ray spectrometer, an X-ray telescope, cosmic ray detectors, and a laser retro-reflector (supplied by France) were also included. 

The vehicle was powered by batteries which were recharged during the lunar day by a solar cell array mounted on the underside of the lid. To be able to work in a vacuum, special fluoride-based lubricant was used for the mechanical parts, and the electric motors (one in each wheel hub) were enclosed in pressurized containers. 

During the lunar nights, the lid was closed, and a polonium-210 radioisotope heater unit kept the internal components at operating temperature. 

&quot;Lunokhod 1&quot; was intended to operate through three lunar days (approximately three Earth months), but actually operated for eleven lunar days.

==Launch and lunar orbit==
&quot;Luna 17&quot; was launched on November 10, 1970, at 14:44:01 UTC. After reaching earth parking orbit, the final stage of &quot;Luna 17&quot;″s launching rocket fired to place it into a trajectory towards the Moon (1970-11-10 at 14:54 UTC). After two course correction maneuvers (on November 12 and 14), it entered lunar orbit on November 15, 1970, at 22:00 UTC.

==Landing and surface operations==

The spacecraft soft-landed on the Moon in the Mare Imbrium (&quot;Sea of Rains&quot;) on November 17 at 03:47 UTC. It landed in western Mare Imbrium, about 60 km south of the Promontorium Heraclides. The lander had dual ramps from which the payload, &quot;Lunokhod 1&quot;, could descend to the lunar surface. 

At 06:28 UTC the rover moved onto the Moon&#x27;s surface. The rover would run during the lunar day, stopping occasionally to recharge its batteries via the solar panels. At night the rover hibernated until the next sunrise, heated by the radioactive source.

Small craters along its traverse were named unofficially during the mission. The names were officially approved by the IAU in 2012. They are called Albert, Leonid, Kolya, Valera, Borya, Gena, Vitya, Kostya, Igor, Slava, Nikolya, and Vasya.

Operations during 1970:
*November 17–22: The rover drove 197 m, returned 14 close-up pictures of the Moon and 12 panoramic views, during 10 communication sessions. It also conducted analyses of the lunar soil.
*December 9–22: 1,522 m
Operations during 1971:
*January 8–20: 1,936 m
*February 8–19: 1,573 m
*March 9–20: 2,004 m
*April 8–20: 1,029 m
*May 7–20: 197 m
*June 5–18: 1,559 m
*July 4–17: 220 m
*August 3–16: 215 m
*August 31 – September 14: 88 m

==Location==

The final location of &quot;Lunokhod 1&quot; was uncertain until 2010, as lunar laser ranging experiments had failed to detect a return signal from it since 1971. On March 17, 2010, Albert Abdrakhimov found both the lander and the rover in Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter image M114185541RC (Line 21977, Sample 3189). In April 2010, the Apache Point Observatory Lunar Laser-ranging Operation (APOLLO) team from the University of California at San Diego used the LRO images to locate the rover closely enough for laser range (distance) measurements. On April 22, 2010, and days following, the team successfully measured the distance several times. The intersection of the spheres described by the measured distances then pinpoint the current location of Lunokhod 1 to within 1 meter. APOLLO is now using &quot;Lunokhod 1&quot;″s reflector for experiments, as they discovered, to their surprise, that it was returning much more light than other reflectors on the Moon. According to a NASA press release, APOLLO researcher Tom Murphy said, &quot;We got about 2,000 photons from Lunokhod 1 on our first try. After almost 40 years of silence, this rover still has a lot to say.&quot;

By November 2010, the location of the rover had been determined to within about a centimeter. The location near the limb of the Moon, combined with the ability to range the rover even when it is in sunlight, promises to be particularly useful for determining aspects of the Earth–Moon system.

In a report released in May 2013, French scientists at the Côte d&#x27;Azur Observatory led by Jean-Marie Torre reported replicating the 2010 laser ranging experiments by American scientists after research using images from the NASA Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. In both cases, laser pulses were returned from the &quot;Lunokhod 1&quot; retroreflector.

==End of mission and results==
Controllers finished the last communications session with &quot;Lunokhod 1&quot; at 13:05 UT on September 14, 1971. Attempts to re-establish contact were finally discontinued and the operations of &quot;Lunokhod 1&quot; officially ceased on October 4, 1971, the anniversary of Sputnik 1. During its 322 Earth days of operations, &quot;Lunokhod 1&quot; travelled 10,540 metres (6.55 miles) and returned more than 20,000 TV images and 206 high-resolution panoramas. In addition, it performed 25 lunar soil analyses with its RIFMA x-ray fluorescence spectrometer and used its penetrometer at 500 different locations.

<text>Lunokhod 2 ( (&quot;Moonwalker 2&quot;), also known as Аппарат 8ЕЛ № 204 (&quot;Device 8EL No. 204&quot;)) was the second of two uncrewed lunar rovers that landed on the Moon by the Soviet Union as part of the Lunokhod programme.

The &quot;Luna 21&quot; spacecraft landed on the Moon and deployed the second Soviet lunar rover, &quot;Lunokhod 2&quot;, in January 1973. The lander and rover together massed 1814 kg. 

The primary objectives of the mission were to collect images of the lunar surface, examine ambient light levels to determine the feasibility of astronomical observations from the Moon, perform laser ranging experiments from Earth, observe solar X-rays, measure local magnetic fields, and study the soil mechanics of the lunar surface material.

== &quot;Lunokhod 2&quot; rover and subsystems ==
The rover stood high and had a mass of . It was about long and wide and had eight wheels each with an independent suspension, electric motor and brake. The rover had two speeds, about . 
&quot;Lunokhod 2&quot; was equipped with three television cameras, one mounted high on the rover for navigation, which could return high resolution images at different frame rates—3.2, 5.7, 10.9 or 21.1 seconds per frame. These images were used by a five-man team of controllers on Earth who sent driving commands to the rover in real time. 

Power was supplied by a solar panel on the inside of a round hinged lid which covered the instrument bay, which would charge the batteries when opened. A polonium-210 radioisotope heater unit was used to keep the rover warm during the long lunar nights. 

There were four panoramic cameras mounted on the rover. Scientific instruments included a soil mechanics tester, solar X-ray experiment, an astrophotometer to measure visible and ultraviolet light levels, a magnetometer deployed in front of the rover on the end of a 2.5 m (8 ft 2 in) boom, a radiometer, a photodetector (Rubin-1) for laser detection experiments, and a French-supplied laser corner reflector. 

The lander carried a bas relief of Vladimir Lenin and the State Emblem of the Soviet Union.

== Mission ==
The Proton-K/D launcher put the spacecraft into Earth parking orbit followed by translunar injection. On January 12, 1973, &quot;Luna 21&quot; was braked into a lunar orbit. On January 13 and 14, the perilune was lowered to altitude.

== Landing and surface operations ==

On January 15, 1973, after 40 orbits, the descent of the craft was commenced as the braking rocket was fired at altitude, and the craft began to de-orbit. At an altitude of the main thrusters began firing, slowing the fall until a height of was reached. At this point the main thrusters shut down and the secondary thrusters ignited, slowing the fall until the lander was above the surface, where the engine was switched off. Landing occurred at 23:35 UT in Le Monnier crater at 25.85 degrees N, 30.45 degrees E.

After landing, the &quot;Lunokhod 2&quot; took TV images of the surrounding area, then rolled down a ramp to the surface at 01:14 UT on January 16 and took pictures of the &quot;Luna 21&quot; lander and landing site, driving for 30 metres. After a period of charging up its batteries, it took more pictures of the site and the lander, and then set off to explore the Moon.

The rover would run during the lunar day, stopping occasionally to recharge its batteries with the solar panels. At night the rover hibernated until the next sunrise, heated by the radioactive source.

* January 18, 1973 to January 24, 1973: The rover drives 1,260 metres
* February 8 to 23: The rover drives 9,086 metres further
* March 11 to 23: The rover drives 16,533 metres further
* April 9 to 22: The rover drives 8,600 metres further
* May 8 to June 3: The rover drives 880 metres further
== End of mission ==
On June 4, 1973, it was announced that the program was completed, leading to speculation that the vehicle probably failed in mid-May or could not be revived after the lunar night of May–June.

More recently, Alexander Basilevsky related an account in which on May 9, the rover&#x27;s open lid touched a crater wall and became covered with dust. When the lid was closed, this dust (a very good insulator) was dumped on to the radiators. The following day, May 10, controllers saw the internal temperature of &quot;Lunokhod 2&quot; climb as it was unable to cool itself, eventually rendering the rover inoperable. On May 11, signal from the rover was lost.

== Results ==

&quot;Lunokhod 2&quot; operated for about four months, and the original estimate was that it covered of terrain, including hilly upland areas and rilles, and sent back 86 panoramic images and over 80,000 TV pictures. Many mechanical tests of the surface, laser ranging measurements, and other experiments were completed during this time. &quot;Lunokhod 2&quot; was thought to have covered based on wheel rotations but Russian scientists at the Moscow State University of Geodesy and Cartography (MIIGAiK) revised that to an estimated distance of about based on Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) images of the lunar surface. Subsequent discussions with their American counterparts ended with an agreed-upon final distance of ; an international team has confirmed that the methods used to calculate the two rovers&#x27; odometry is consistent and comparable from the Moon to Mars.

&quot;Lunokhod 2&quot; held the record for off-Earth roving distance until July 27, 2014, when NASA&#x27;s Mars &quot;Opportunity&quot; rover exceeded it after having traveled over .

== Current status ==

&quot;Lunokhod 2&quot; continues to be detected by lunar laser ranging experiments and its position is known to sub-meter accuracy. On March 17, 2010, Phil Stooke at the University of Western Ontario announced that he had located &quot;Lunokhod 2&quot; in NASA Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) images, but later images showed the initial identification was incorrect (the identified point was a mark in the rover tracks near the end of the route, made as &quot;Lunokhod 2&quot; turned around), and the LRO LROC team identified the correct location of the rover in March 2012. Excellent &quot;Lunokhod 2&quot; images from LROC were published by Mark Robinson on SESE site of ASU.

== Present ownership ==
Ownership of &quot;Lunokhod 2&quot; and the &quot;Luna 21&quot; lander was sold by the Lavochkin Association for $68,500 in December 1993 at a Sotheby&#x27;s auction in New York. (The catalog incorrectly lists lot 68A as &quot;Luna 17&quot;/&quot;Lunokhod 1&quot;).

The buyer was computer game entrepreneur and space tourist Richard Garriott (son of the astronaut Owen K. Garriott), who stated in a 2001 interview with &quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot;&#x27;s Cindy Yans that:

:I purchased Lunakod 21 from the Russians. I am now the world&#x27;s only private owner of an object on a foreign celestial body. Though there are international treaties that say, no government shall lay claim to geography off planet earth, I am not a government. Summarily, I claim the moon in the name of Lord British!

Garriott later confirmed that he is the owner of &quot;Lunokhod 2&quot;.

<text>The Alans (Latin: &quot;Alani&quot;) were an ancient and medieval Iranic nomadic pastoral people who migrated to what is today North Caucasus – while some continued on to Europe and later North Africa. They are generally regarded as part of the Sarmatians, and possibly related to the Massagetae. Modern historians have connected the Alans with the Central Asian Yancai of Chinese sources and with the Aorsi of Roman sources. Having migrated westwards and becoming dominant among the Sarmatians on the Pontic–Caspian steppe, the Alans are mentioned by Roman sources in the . At that time they had settled the region north of the Black Sea and frequently raided the Parthian Empire and the South Caucasus provinces of the Roman Empire. From the Goths broke their power on the Pontic Steppe, thereby assimilating a sizeable portion of the associated Alans.

Upon the Hunnic defeat of the Goths on the Pontic Steppe around , many of the Alans migrated westwards along with various Germanic tribes. They crossed the Rhine in 406CE along with the Vandals and Suebi, settling in Orléans and Valence. Around 409 CE they joined the Vandals and Suebi in crossing the Pyrenees into the Iberian Peninsula, settling in Lusitania and Hispania Carthaginensis. The Iberian Alans, soundly defeated by the Visigoths in 418 CE, subsequently surrendered their authority to the Hasdingi Vandals. In 428CE, the Vandals and Alans crossed the Strait of Gibraltar into North Africa, where they founded a kingdom which lasted until its conquest by forces of the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I in 534.

Eventually in the 9th century those Alans who remained under Hunnic rule established the regionally powerful kingdom of Alania. It survived until the Mongol invasions of the 13th century CE. Various scholars regard these Alans as the ancestors of the modern Ossetians.

The Alans spoke an Eastern Iranian language which derived from Scytho-Sarmatian and which in turn evolved into the modern Ossetian language. The name &quot;Alan&quot; represents an Eastern Iranian dialectal form of Old Iranian term &quot;Aryan&quot;, and so is cognate with the name of the country &quot;Īrān&quot; (from the gen. plur. &quot;*aryānām&quot;).

==Name==
The Alans were documented by foreign observers from the 1st century CE onward under similar names: ; &#x27;; &#x27; (Pinyin; &quot;Alan&quot; + &quot;Liu&quot;) in the 2nd century, &#x27; in the 3rd century, later &quot;Alanguo&quot; (); Parthian and Middle Persian &quot;Alānān&quot; (plural); Arabic &quot;Alān&quot; (singular); Syriac &quot;Alānayē&quot;; Classical Armenian &quot;Alank; Georgian &quot;Alaneti&quot; (&#x27;country of the Alans&#x27;); Hebrew &quot;Alan&quot; (pl. &quot;Alanim&quot;). Rarer Latin spellings include &quot;Alauni&quot; or &quot;Halani&quot;. The name was also preserved in the modern Ossetian language as &quot;Allon&quot;.

The ethnonym &quot;Alān&quot; is a dialectal variant of the Old Iranian *&quot;Aryāna&quot;, itself derived from the root &quot;arya&quot;-, meaning &#x27;Aryan&#x27;, the common self-designation of Indo-Iranian peoples. It probably came in use in the early history of the Alans for the purpose of uniting a heterogeneous group of tribes through the invocation of a common, ancestral &#x27;Aryan&#x27; origin. Like the name of Iran (*&quot;Aryānām&quot;), the adjective *&quot;aryāna&quot; is related to &quot;Airyanəm Waēǰō&quot; (&#x27;stretch of the Aryas&#x27;), the mythical homeland of the early Iranians mentioned in the &quot;Avesta&quot;.

Some other ethnonyms also bear the name of the Alans: the &quot;Rhoxolāni&quot; (&#x27;Bright Alans&#x27;), an offshoot of the Alans whose name may be linked to religious practices, and the &quot;Alanorsoi&quot; (&#x27;White Alans&#x27;), perhaps a conglomerate of Alans and Aorsi. The personal names &quot;Alan&quot; and &quot;Alain&quot; (from Latin &quot;Alanus&quot;) may have been introduced by Alan settlers to Western Europe during the first millennium CE.

The Alans were also known over the course of their history by another group of related names including the variations &quot;Asi&quot;, &quot;As&quot;, and &quot;Os&quot; (Romanian &#x27;, Bulgarian &#x27;, Hungarian &#x27;, Russian &#x27;, Georgian &quot;&quot;). It is this name at the root of the modern &quot;Ossetian&quot;.

==History==

===Timeline===
===Origin===
The Alans were formed out of the merger of the Massagetae, a Central Asian Iranian nomadic people, with some old tribal groups. Related to the Asii who had invaded Bactria in the 2nd century BCE, the Alans were pushed west by the Kangju people (known to Graeco-Roman authors as the in Greek, and the in Latin), the latter of whom were living in the Syr Darya basin, from where they expanded their rule from Fergana to the Aral Sea region.

===Early Alans===

The first mentions of names that historians link with the &quot;Alani&quot; appear at almost the same time in texts from the Mediterranean, Middle East and China.

In the 1st century CE, the Alans migrated westwards from Central Asia, achieving a dominant position among the Sarmatians living between the Don River and the Caspian Sea. The Alans are mentioned in the Vologases inscription which reads that Vologases I, the Parthian king between around45 and 78 CE, in the 11th year of his reign (62 CE), battled Kuluk, king of the Alani. The 1st century CE Jewish historian Josephus supplements this inscription. Josephus reports in the &quot;Jewish Wars&quot; (book7, ch.7.4) how Alans (whom he calls a &quot;Scythian&quot; tribe) living near the Sea of Azov crossed the Iron Gates for plunder (72CE) and defeated the armies of Pacorus, king of Media, and Tiridates, King of Armenia, two brothers of Vologeses I (for whom the above-mentioned inscription was made):

The fact that the Alans invaded Parthia through Hyrcania shows that at the time many Alans were still based north-east of the Caspian Sea. By the early 2nd century CE the Alans were in firm control of the Lower Volga and Kuban. These lands had earlier been occupied by the Aorsi and the Siraces, whom the Alans apparently absorbed, dispersed and/or destroyed, since they were no longer mentioned in contemporaneous accounts. It is likely that the Alans&#x27; influence stretched further westwards, encompassing most of the Sarmatian world, which by then possessed a relatively homogenous culture.

In , the Alans made a huge raid into Asia Minor via the Caucasus, ravaging Media and Armenia. They were eventually driven back by Arrian, the governor of Cappadocia, who wrote a detailed report (&quot;Ektaxis kata Alanoon&quot; or &#x27;War Against the Alans&#x27;) that is a major source for studying Roman military tactics.

From 215 to 250, the Germanic Goths expanded south-eastwards and broke the Alan dominance on the Pontic Steppe. The Alans however seem to have had a significant influence on the culture of the Goths, who became excellent horsemen and adopted the Alanic animal style art. (The Roman Empire, during the chaos of the 3rd century civil wars, suffered damaging raids by the Gothic armies with their heavy cavalry before the Illyrian Emperors adapted to the Gothic tactics, reorganized and expanded the Roman heavy cavalry, and defeated the Goths under Gallienus, Claudius II and Aurelian.)

After the Gothic entry to the steppe, many of the Alans seem to have retreated eastwards towards the Don, where they seem to have established contacts with the Huns. Ammianus writes that the Alans were &quot;somewhat like the Huns, but in their manner of life and their habits they are less savage.&quot; Jordanes contrasted them with the Huns, noting that the Alans &quot;were their equals in battle, but unlike them in their civilisation, manners and appearance&quot;. In the late 4th century, Vegetius conflates Alans and Huns in his military treatise &quot;Hunnorum Alannorumque natio&quot;, the &quot;nation of Huns and Alans&quot;and collocates Goths, Huns and Alans, &quot;exemplo Gothorum et Alannorum Hunnorumque&quot;.

The 4th century Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus noted that the Alans were &quot;formerly called Massagetae,&quot; while Dio Cassius wrote that &quot;they are Massagetae.&quot; It is likely that the Alans were an amalgamation of various Iranian peoples, including Sarmatians, Massagetae and Sakas. Scholars have connected the Alans to the nomadic state of Yancai mentioned in Chinese sources. The Yancai are first mentioned in connection with late 2nd century BCE diplomat Zhang Qian&#x27;s travels in Chapter 123 of &quot;Shiji&quot; (whose author, Sima Qian, died c. 90 BCE). The Yancai of Chinese records has again been equated with the Aorsi, a powerful Sarmatian tribe living between the Don River and the Aral Sea, mentioned in Roman records, in particular Strabo.

===Link to &quot;Yancai&quot; (奄蔡) / &quot;Hesu&quot; (闔蘇) / &quot;Alan&quot; (阿蘭) ===
The Later Han dynasty Chinese chronicle, the &quot;Hou Hanshu&quot;, 88 (covering the period 25–220 and completed in the 5th century), mentioned a report that the &quot;Yancai&quot; nation (奄蔡 lit &quot;Vast Steppes&quot; or &quot;Extensive Grasslands&quot; &lt; LHC *&quot;ʔɨamB&quot;-&quot;sɑC&quot;; a.k.a. &quot;Hesu&quot; (闔蘇), compare Latin &quot;Abzoae&quot;, identified with the Aorsi (Ancient Greek &quot;Αορσιοι&quot;)) had become a vassal state of the Kangju and was now known as &quot;Alan&quot; (&lt; LHC: *&quot;ʔɑ-lɑn&quot; 阿蘭)

Y. A. Zadneprovskiy suggests that the Kangju subjugation of Yancai occurred in the 1st century BCE, and that this subjugation caused various Sarmatian tribes, including the Aorsi, to migrate westwards, which played a major role in starting the Migration Period. The 3rd century Weilüe also notes that Yancai was then known to be Alans, although they were no longer vassals of the Kangju.

Dutch Sinologist A. F. P. Hulsewé noted that:

===Migration to Gaul===

Around 370, according to Ammianus, the peaceful relations between the Alans and Huns were broken, after the Huns attacked the Don Alans, killing many of them and establishing an alliance with the survivors. These Alans successfully invaded the Goths in 375 together with the Huns. They subsequently accompanied the Huns in their westward expansion.

Following the Hunnic invasion in 370, other Alans, along with other Sarmatians, migrated westward. One of these Alan groups fought together with the Goths in the decisive Battle of Adrianople in 378CE, in which emperor Valens was killed. As the Roman Empire continued to decline, the Alans split into various groups; some fought for the Romans while others joined the Huns, Visigoths or Ostrogoths. A portion of the western Alans joined the Vandals and the Suebi in their invasion of Roman Gaul. Gregory of Tours mentions in his &quot;Liber historiae Francorum&quot; (&quot;Book of Frankish History&quot;) that the Alan king Respendial saved the day for the Vandals in an armed encounter with the Franks at the crossing of the Rhine on 31 December 406). According to Gregory, another group of Alans, led by Goar, crossed the Rhine at the same time, but immediately joined the Romans and settled in Gaul.

Under Beorgor (), they moved throughout Gaul, till the reign of Petronius Maximus, when they crossed the Alps in the winter of 464, into Liguria, but were there defeated, and Beorgor slain, by Ricimer, commander of the Emperor&#x27;s forces.

In 442, after it became clear to Aetius that he could no longer rely upon the Huns for support, he turned to Goar and persuaded him to move some of his people to settlements in the Orleanais in order to control the bacaudae of Armorica and to keep the Visigoths from expanding their territories northward across the Loire. Goar settled a substantial number of his followers in the Orleanais and the area to the north and personally moved his own capital to the city of Orleans.

Under Goar, they allied with the Burgundians led by Gundaharius, with whom they installed the Emperor Jovinus as usurper. Under Goar&#x27;s successor Sangiban, the Alans of Orléans played a critical role in repelling the invasion of Attila the Hun at the Battle of Châlons. In 463 the Alans defeated the Goths at the battle of Orléans, and they later defeated the Franks led by Childeric in 466. Around 502–503 Clovis attacked Armorica but was defeated by the Alans. However, the Alans, who were Chalcedonian Christians like Clovis, desired cordial relations with him to counterbalance the hostile Arian Visigoths who coveted the land north of the Loire. Therefore, an accord was arranged by which Clovis came to rule the various peoples of Armorica and the military strength of the area was integrated into the Merovingian military.

===Hispania and Africa===

Following the fortunes of the Vandals and Suebi into the Iberian peninsula (Hispania, comprising modern Portugal and Spain) in 409, the Alans led by Respendial settled in the provinces of Lusitania and Carthaginensis. The Kingdom of the Alans was among the first Barbarian kingdoms to be founded. The Siling Vandals settled in Baetica, the Suebi in coastal Gallaecia, and the Asding Vandals in the rest of Gallaecia. Although the newcomers controlled Hispania they were still a tiny minority among a larger Hispano-Roman population, approximately 200,000 out of 6,000,000.

In 418 (or 426 according to some authors), the Alan king, Attaces, was killed in battle against the Visigoths, and this branch of the Alans subsequently appealed to the Asding Vandal king Gunderic to accept the Alan crown. The separate ethnic identity of Respendial&#x27;s Alans dissolved. Although some of these Alans are thought to have remained in Iberia, most went to North Africa with the Vandals in 429. Later the rulers of the Vandal Kingdom in North Africa styled themselves &quot;Rex Wandalorum et Alanorum&quot; (&quot;King of the Vandals and Alans&quot;).

There are some vestiges of the Alans in Portugal, namely in Alenquer (whose name may be Germanic for the &quot;Temple of the Alans&quot;, from &quot;Alan Kerk&quot;, and whose castle may have been established by them; the Alaunt is still represented in that city&#x27;s coat of arms), in the construction of the castles of Torres Vedras and Almourol, and in the city walls of Lisbon, where vestiges of their presence may be found under the foundations of the Church of &quot;Santa Luzia&quot;.

In the Iberian peninsula the Alans settled in Lusitania (Alentejo) and the Cartaginense provinces. They became known in retrospect for their massive hunting and fighting running mastiff-type dogs, the Alaunt, which they apparently introduced to Europe. The breed is extinct, but its name is carried by a Spanish breed of dog still called &quot;Alano&quot;, traditionally used in boar hunting and cattle herding. The Alano name, however, has historically been used for a number of dog breeds in a few European countries thought to descend from the original dog of the Alans, such as the German mastiff (Great Dane) and the French Dogue de Bordeaux, among others.

===Medieval Alania===

The Alans who remained in their original area of settlement north of the Caucasus (and for a time east of the Caspian Sea as well), came into contact and conflict with the Bulgars, the Gökturks, and the Khazars, who drove most of them from the plains and into the mountains.

The Alans converted to Byzantine Orthodoxy in the first quarter of the 10th century, during the patriarchate of Nicholas I Mystikos. Al-Mas‘udi reports that they apostasized in 932, but this seems to have been short-lived. The Alans are collectively mentioned as Byzantine-rite Christians in the 13th century. The Caucasian Alans were the ancestors of the modern Ossetians, whose ethnonym derives from the name &quot;Ās&quot; (very probably the ancient &quot;Aorsi&quot;; al-Ma&#x27;sudi mentions &quot;al-Arsiyya&quot; as guards among the Khazars, and the Rus&#x27; called the Alans &quot;Yasi&quot;), a sister tribe of the Alans. The &quot;Armenian Geography&quot; uses the name &quot;Ashtigor&quot; for the most westerly located Alans, a name which survives as &quot;Digor&quot; and still refers to the western division of the Ossetians. Furthermore, in Ossetian, &quot;Asi&quot; refers to the region around Mount Elbrus, where they probably formerly lived.
Some of the other Alans remained under the rule of the Huns. Those of the eastern division, though dispersed about the steppes until late medieval times, were forced by the Mongols into the Caucasus, where they remain as the Ossetians. Between the 9th and 12th centuries, they formed a network of tribal alliances that gradually evolved into the Christian kingdom of Alania. Most Alans submitted to the Mongol Empire in 1239–1277. They participated in Mongol invasions of Europe and the Song dynasty in Southern China, and the Battle of Kulikovo under Mamai of the Golden Horde.

In 1253, the Franciscan friar William of Rubruck reported numerous Europeans in Central Asia. It is also known that 30,000 Alans formed the royal guard (Asud) of the Yuan court in Dadu (Beijing). Marco Polo later reported their role in the Yuan dynasty in his book &quot;Il Milione&quot;. It is said that those Alans contributed to a modern Mongol clan, Asud. John of Montecorvino, archbishop of Dadu (Khanbaliq), reportedly converted many Alans to Roman Catholic Christianity in addition to Armenians in China. In Poland and Lithuania, Alans were also part of the powerful Clan of Ostoja.

According to the missionary Pian de Carpine, a part of the Alans had successfully resisted a Mongol siege on a mountain for 12 years:

This twelve-year-long siege is not found in any other report, however the Russian historian A. I. Krasnov connected this battle with two Chechen folktales he recorded in 1967 that spoke of an old hunter named Idig who with his companions defended the Dakuoh mountain for 12 years against Tatar-Mongols. He also reported to have found several arrowheads and spears from the 13th century near the very mountain the battle took place at:

Against the Alans and the Cumans (Kipchaks), the Mongols used divide-and-conquer tactics by first telling the Cumans to stop allying with the Alans and, after the Cumans followed their suggestion, the Mongols then attacked the Cumans after defeating the Alans. Alans were recruited into the Mongol forces with one unit called &quot;Right Alan Guard&quot; which was combined with &quot;recently surrendered&quot; soldiers, Mongols, and Chinese soldiers stationed in the area of the former Kingdom of Qocho and in Besh Balikh the Mongols established a Chinese military colony led by Chinese general Qi Kongzhi (Ch&#x27;i Kung-chih). Alan and Kipchak guards were used by Kublai Khan. In 1368 at the end of the Yuan dynasty in China Toghan Temür was accompanied by his faithful Alan guards. Mangu enlisted in his bodyguard half the troops of the Alan prince, Arslan, whose younger son Nicholas took a part in the expedition of the Mongols against Karajang (Yunnan). This Alan imperial guard was still in existence in 1272, 1286 and 1309, and it was divided into two corps with headquarters in the Ling pei province (Karakorúm). The French-Flemish friar and traveler William of Rubruck mentions Alans numerous times in the account of his 1253–1255 journey through Eurasia to the Great Khan, e.g. Alans living as Mongol subjects in Crimea, Old Astrakhan, the Khan&#x27;s capital Karakorum, and also still as freemen in their Caucasian homeland (&quot;the Alans or Aas, who are Christians and still fight the Tartars&quot;). The reason why the earlier Persian word tersa was gradually abandoned by the Mongols in favour of the Syro-Greek word arkon, when speaking of Christians, manifestly is that no specifically Greek Church was ever heard of in China until the Russians had been conquered; besides, there were large bodies of Russian and Alan guards at Peking throughout the last half of the thirteenth and first half of the fourteenth century, and the Catholics there would not be likely to encourage the use of a Persian word which was most probably applicable in the first instance to the Nestorians they found so degenerated. The Alan guards converted to Catholicism as reported by Odorico. They were a &quot;Russian guard&quot;.
It is believed that some Alans resettled to the North (Barsils), merging with Volga Bulgars and Burtas, eventually transforming to Volga Tatars. It is supposed that the Iasi, a group of Alans founded a town in the northeast of Romania (about 1200–1300), near the Prut river, called Iași. The latter became the capital of Moldavia in the Middle Ages.

Alan mercenaries were involved in the affair with the Catalan Company.

===Later history===
Descendants of the Alans who live in the autonomous republics of Russia and Georgia speak the Ossetian language which belongs to the Northeastern Iranian language group and is the only remnant of the Scytho-Sarmatian dialect continuum left, which once stretched over much of the Pontic steppe and Central Asia. Modern Ossetian has two major dialects: &quot;Digor&quot;, spoken in the western part of North Ossetia; and &quot;Iron&quot;, spoken in the rest of Ossetia. A third branch of Ossetian, &quot;Jassic&quot; (&quot;Jász&quot;), was formerly spoken in Hungary. The literary language, based on the Iron dialect, was fixed by the national poet, Kosta Khetagurov (1859–1906).

==Physical appearance==
The fourth-century Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus wrote this on the appearance of the Alans:

==Genetics==
In a study conducted in 2014 by V. V.Ilyinskyon on bone fragments from 10 Alanic burials on the Don River, DNA could be abstracted from a total of seven. Four of them turned out to belong to yDNA Haplogroup G2 and six of them had mtDNAI. The fact that many of the samples share the same y- and mtDNA raises the possibility that the tested individuals belonged to the same tribe or even were close relatives. Nevertheless, this supports the argument for a direct Alan ancestry of Ossetians, competing with the hypothesis that Ossetians are alanized Caucasic-speakers, as the main haplogroup among Ossetians is also G2.

In 2015, the Institute of Archaeology in Moscow conducted research on various Sarmato-Alan and Saltovo-Mayaki culture Kurgan burials. In this analysis, the two Alan samples from the 4th to 6th century CE had yDNAs G2a-P15 and R1a-z94, while from the three Sarmatian samples from 2nd to 3rd century CE two had yDNA J1-M267 and one possessed R1a. Also, the three Saltovo-Mayaki samples from 8th to 9th century CE turned out to have yDNAs G, J2a-M410 and R1a-z94 respectively.

A genetic study published in &quot;Nature&quot; in May 2018 examined the remains of six Alans buried in the Caucasus from c. 100 CE to 1400 CE. The sample of Y-DNA extracted belonged to haplogroup R1 and haplogroup Q-M242. One of the Q-M242 samples found in Beslan, North Ossetia from 200 CE found 4 relatives among Chechens from the Shoanoy Teip. The samples of mtDNA extracted belonged to HV2a1, U4d3, X2f, H13a2c, H5, and W1.

==Archaeology==

Archaeological finds support the written sources. P. D. Rau (1927) first identified late Sarmatian sites with the historical Alans. Based on the archaeological material, they were one of the Iranian-speaking nomadic tribes that began to enter the Sarmatian area between the middle of the 1st and the 2nd centuries.

==Language==
==Religion==

Prior to their Christianisation, the Alans were Indo-Iranian polytheists, subscribing either to the poorly understood Scythian pantheon or to a polytheistic form of Zoroastrianism. Some traditions were directly inherited from the Scythians, like embodying their dominant god in elaborate rituals.

In the 4th5th centuries the Alans were at least partially Christianized by Byzantine missionaries of the Arian church. In the 13th century, invading Mongol hordes pushed the eastern Alans further south into the Caucasus, where they mixed with native Caucasian groups and successively formed three territorial entities each with different developments. Around 1395, Timur&#x27;s army invaded the Northern Caucasus and massacred much of the Alanian population.

As time went by, Digor in the west came under Kabard and Islamic influence. It was through the Kabardians (an East Circassian tribe) that Islam was introduced into the region in the 17th century. After 1767, all of Alania came under Russian rule, which strengthened Orthodox Christianity in that region considerably. A substantial minority of today&#x27;s Ossetians are followers of the traditional Ossetian religion, revived in the 1980s as Assianism (Ossetian: &quot;Uatsdin&quot; = &#x27;true faith&#x27;).

<text>Anne of the Thousand Days is a 1969 British historical drama film based on the life of Anne Boleyn, directed by Charles Jarrott and produced by Hal B. Wallis. The screenplay by Bridget Boland and John Hale is an adaptation of the 1948 play of the same name by Maxwell Anderson.

The film stars Richard Burton as King Henry VIII and Geneviève Bujold as Anne Boleyn. Irene Papas plays Catherine of Aragon, Anthony Quayle plays Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, and John Colicos plays Thomas Cromwell. Others in the cast include Michael Hordern, Katharine Blake, Peter Jeffrey, Joseph O&#x27;Conor, William Squire, Vernon Dobtcheff, Denis Quilley, Esmond Knight, and T. P. McKenna, who later played Henry VIII in &quot;Monarch&quot;. Burton&#x27;s wife Elizabeth Taylor makes a brief, uncredited appearance.

Despite receiving some negative reviews and mixed reviews from &quot;The New York Times&quot; and Pauline Kael, the film was nominated for 10 Academy Awards and won the award for best costumes. Geneviève Bujold&#x27;s portrayal of Anne, her first role in an English language film, was very highly praised, even by &quot;Time&quot; magazine, which otherwise skewered the movie. According to the Academy Awards exposé &quot;Inside Oscar&quot;, an expensive advertising campaign was mounted by Universal Studios that included serving champagne and filet mignon to members of the Academy following each screening.

==Plot==
In London, 1536, Henry VIII considers whether or not he should sign the warrant for the execution of his second wife, Anne Boleyn.

Nine years earlier, Henry has a problem: he reveals his dissatisfaction with his wife Catherine of Aragon. He is enjoying a discreet affair with Mary Boleyn, a daughter of one of his courtiers, Sir Thomas Boleyn; but the king is bored with her too. At a court ball, he notices Mary&#x27;s 18-year-old sister Anne, who has returned from her education in France. She is engaged to the son of the Earl of Northumberland, and they have received their parents&#x27; permission to marry. The king, however, is enraptured with Anne&#x27;s beauty and orders Cardinal Wolsey, his Lord Chancellor, to break the engagement.

When news of this decision is carried to Anne, she reacts furiously. She blames the cardinal and the king for ruining her happiness. When Henry makes a rather clumsy attempt to seduce her, Anne bluntly informs him how she finds him.

Henry brings her back to court with him, and she continues to resist his advances out of a mixture of repulsion for Henry and her lingering anger over her broken engagement. However, she becomes intoxicated with the power that the king&#x27;s love gives her. Using this power, she continually undermines Cardinal Wolsey, who initially sees Anne as a passing love interest for the king.

When Henry again presses Anne to become his mistress, she repeats that she never will give birth to an illegitimate child. Desperate to have a son, Henry suddenly comes up with the idea of marrying Anne in Catherine&#x27;s place. Anne is stunned, but she agrees. Wolsey begs the king to abandon the idea because of the political consequences of divorcing Catherine. Henry refuses to listen.

When Wolsey fails to persuade the pope to give Henry his divorce, Anne points out this failing to an enraged Henry. Wolsey is dismissed from office, and his magnificent palace in London is given as a present to Anne, who realizes she has finally fallen in love with Henry. They sleep together, and after discovering that she is pregnant, they secretly are married. Anne is given a splendid coronation, but the people jeer at her in disgust.

Months later, Anne gives birth to a daughter: Princess Elizabeth. Henry is displeased because he wanted a son, and their marital relationship begins to cool. His attentions are soon diverted to Lady Jane Seymour, one of Anne&#x27;s maids. Once she discovers this liaison, Anne banishes Jane from court.

During a row over Sir Thomas More&#x27;s opposition to Anne&#x27;s queenship, Anne refuses to sleep with her husband unless More is put to death. More is executed, but Anne&#x27;s subsequent pregnancy ends with a stillborn boy.

Henry demands that his new minister Thomas Cromwell find a way to get rid of Anne. Cromwell tortures a servant in her household into confessing to adultery with the queen; he then arrests four other courtiers who are also accused of being Anne&#x27;s lovers. Anne is taken to the Tower and placed under arrest. When she is told that she has been accused of adultery, Anne laughs until she sees her brother being brought into the Tower and learns he faces the same accusation.

At Anne&#x27;s trial, she manages to cross-question Mark Smeaton, the tortured servant who finally admits that the charges against Anne are lies. Henry makes an appearance, then visits Anne in her chambers that night. He offers her freedom if she will agree to annul their marriage and make their daughter illegitimate. Anne refuses, saying that she would rather die than betray their daughter. Henry slaps her and tells her that her disobedience will mean her death.

Henry decides to execute Anne. A few days later, Anne is taken to the scaffold and beheaded by a French swordsman. Henry rides off to marry Jane Seymour, and their young daughter, Elizabeth, toddles alone in the garden as she hears the cannon firing to announce her mother&#x27;s death.

==Cast==
Elizabeth Taylor has an uncredited cameo appearance as a masked courtesan who interrupts Queen Catherine&#x27;s prayers. Kate Burton makes her acting debut as a maid.

==Background and production==
The play &quot;Anne of the Thousand Days&quot;, the film&#x27;s basis, was first enacted on Broadway in the Shubert Theatre on 8 December 1948; staged by H. C. Potter, with Rex Harrison and Joyce Redman as Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn respectively, running 288 performances; Harrison won a Tony Award for his performance.

Cinematically, &quot;Anne of the Thousand Days&quot; took 20 years to reach the screen because its themes – adultery, illegitimacy, incest – were then unacceptable to the U.S. motion picture production code. The film was made on such locations as Penshurst Place and Hever Castle, and at Pinewood and Shepperton Studios.
Hever Castle was one of the main settings for the film; it was also the childhood home of Anne Boleyn.

British actress Olivia Hussey was the first choice for the role of Anne Boleyn. When producer Hal B. Wallis first met Hussey in New York in November 1967 at a party for her then upcoming film &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (1968), he offered her the title role. In addition, he also offered her to star with John Wayne in &quot;True Grit&quot; (1969). In her 2019 memoir, Hussey stated that she had &quot;mumbled something about being interested in &quot;Anne of the Thousand Days&quot;” but added that she &quot;couldn’t see herself with Wayne&quot;. She claims that this &quot;adolescent and opinionated&quot; remark inevitably ended her professional relationship with Wallis, and he immediately withdrew his offer from her. &quot;It had taken me less than a minute to talk my way out of it&quot; Hussey stated.

Maxwell Anderson employed blank verse for parts of his play, but most examples of this were removed from the screenplay. One blank verse episode that was retained was Anne&#x27;s soliloquy in the Tower of London. The opening of the play was changed, with Thomas Cromwell&#x27;s telling Henry VIII the outcome of the trial and Henry&#x27;s recalling his marriage to Anne rather than Anne&#x27;s speaking first and then Henry&#x27;s remembering in flashback.

==Historicity==
*Antonia Fraser has noted that the &quot;beating heart at the center of the film&quot; — that is, the unrequited passion of Henry for Anne, which undergoes a complete reversal by the end of the story — is entirely unhistorical. She observed that &quot;Monster that Henry might have been, all six of his wives married him willingly&quot; and that this depiction is &quot;very far away from history — and the mentality of the sixteenth century.&quot; In short, &quot;the real Anne Boleyn was delighted to receive the king&#x27;s attentions&quot;.
* Historians dispute King Henry VIII&#x27;s paternity of one or both of Mary Boleyn&#x27;s children. &quot;Henry VIII: The King and His Court&quot; by Alison Weir questions the paternity of Henry Carey; Dr. G. W. Bernard (&quot;The King&#x27;s Reformation&quot;) and Joanna Denny (&quot;Anne Boleyn: A New Life of England&#x27;s Tragic Queen&quot;) argue that Henry VIII was their father.
* Anne Boleyn might not have been 18 years old in 1527; her birth date is unrecorded. Most historians today believe that she was in her early to mid 20s in 1527.
* There is no proof that Henry VIII ordered the breaking of Henry Percy and Anne Boleyn&#x27;s engagement because he wanted Anne for himself. Percy&#x27;s family, the Northumberlands, were one of the leading families in the North of England, and they always wanted Henry Percy to marry Mary Talbot, a rich heiress from the same region, and not a girl from a comparatively lower status family. They might have asked for the king&#x27;s and Cardinal Wolsey&#x27;s intervention when the engagement was made public. In fact, in order to have no impediment for Henry VIII&#x27;s and Anne&#x27;s marriage, all parties always denied that any engagement had taken place.
* Most histories of the period say nothing about Anne&#x27;s pressuring Henry to have More executed.
* Catherine of Aragon&#x27;s daughter, Mary, was not present at the time of Catherine&#x27;s final illness and death; they were being kept apart forcibly.
* Catherine of Aragon&#x27;s depiction by Irene Papas was wrong in terms of appearance; it is well documented that the queen had auburn hair and a very pale complexion, and that she had become fat by the time she was in her middle thirties. Papas was chosen as she has a stereotypical Mediterranean appearance, matching false popular assumptions on how a &#x27;Spanish&#x27; noble would look. The same goes for Jane Seymour: here depicted as a brunette, she was in fact a blonde.
* The meeting between Anne and Henry shortly before her execution is fictional, and even if such a meeting had taken place, some details of their discussion are implausible. Anne&#x27;s marriage was annulled anyway, and she never was offered a deal that would have given her her freedom. Elizabeth and Mary were both declared illegitimate, but were nevertheless in the line of succession, but not until after Anne&#x27;s death. Thus, at that point, the chance of Elizabeth&#x27;s inheriting the crown must have seemed small.
* Henry did not intervene in Anne&#x27;s trial; she was disallowed the right to question the witnesses against her. She and the king met last at a joust the day before her arrest.
* &quot;Anne of the Thousand Days&quot; depicts Anne as innocent of the charges laid against her, and this is considered historically correct in the biographies by Eric W. Ives, Retha Warnicke, Joanna Denny, and David Starkey, which all assert her innocence of adultery, incest, and witchcraft.

==Reception==
The film received mixed reviews from critics, as most commonly they considered the plot dull and plodding. Beyond the story itself, the performances of Geneviève Bujold, Richard Burton, and Irene Papas were met with universal acclaim, especially that of Bujold. Bujold remains the only actress to have been nominated for an Oscar for playing Anne Boleyn.

The film was one of the more popular movies of 1970 at the British box office.

<text>The term Moor is an exonym first used by Christian Europeans to designate the Muslim populations of the Maghreb, al-Andalus (Iberian Peninsula), Sicily and Malta during the Middle Ages. Moors are not a single, distinct or self-defined people. The 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; observed that the term had &quot;no real ethnological value.&quot; Europeans of the Middle Ages and the early modern period variously applied the name to Arabs, Berbers, and Muslim Europeans.

The term has also been used in Europe in a broader sense to refer to Muslims in general, especially those of Arab or Berber descent, whether living in al-Andalus or North Africa. During the colonial era, the Portuguese introduced the names &quot;Ceylon Moors&quot; and &quot;Indian Moors&quot; in South Asia and Sri Lanka, now official ethnic designations on the island nation, and the Bengali Muslims were also called Moors. In the Philippines, the longstanding Muslim community, which predates the arrival of the Spanish, now self-identifies as the &quot;Moro people&quot;, an exonym introduced by Spanish colonizers due to their Muslim faith.

In 711, troops mostly formed by Moors from northern Africa led the Umayyad conquest of Hispania. The Iberian Peninsula then came to be known in Classical Arabic as al-Andalus, which at its peak included most of Septimania and modern-day Spain and Portugal. In 827, the Aghlabid Moors occupied Mazara on Sicily, developing it as a port. They eventually went on to consolidate the rest of the island. Differences in religion and culture led to a centuries-long conflict with the Christian kingdoms of Europe, which tried to reclaim control of Muslim areas; this conflict was referred to as the Reconquista. In 1224, the Muslims were expelled from Sicily to the settlement of Lucera, which was destroyed by European Christians in 1300. The fall of Granada in 1492 marked the end of Muslim rule in Spain, although a Muslim minority persisted until their expulsion in 1609.

==Name==
===Etymology===

The etymology of the word &quot;Moor&quot; is uncertain, although it can be traced back to the Phoenician term &quot;Mahurin&quot;, meaning &quot;Westerners&quot;. From &quot;Mahurin&quot;, the ancient Greeks derive &quot;Mauro&quot;, from which Latin derives &quot;Mauri&quot;. The word &quot;Moor&quot; is presumably of Phoenician origin. Some sources attribute a Hebrew origin to the word.

During the classical period, the Romans interacted with, and later conquered, parts of Mauretania, a state that covered modern northern Morocco, western Algeria, and the Spanish cities Ceuta and Melilla. The Berber tribes of the region were noted in the Classics as &quot;Mauri&quot;, which was subsequently rendered as &quot;Moors&quot; in English and in related variations in other European languages. &quot;Mauri&quot; (Ancient Greek: Μαῦροι) is recorded as the native name by Strabo in the early 1st century. This appellation was also adopted into Latin, whereas the Greek name for the tribe was &quot;Maurusii&quot; (). The Moors were also mentioned by Tacitus as having revolted against the Roman Empire in 24 AD.

During the Latin Middle Ages, &quot;Mauri&quot; was used to refer to Berbers and Arabs in the coastal regions of Northwest Africa. The 16th century scholar Leo Africanus (c. 1494–1554) identified the Moors (&quot;Mauri&quot;) as the native Berber inhabitants of the former Roman Africa Province (Roman Africans).

===Modern meanings===
In medieval Romance languages, variations of the Latin word for the Moors (for instance, Italian and Spanish: &quot;moro&quot;, French: &quot;maure&quot;, Portuguese: &quot;mouro&quot;, Romanian: &quot;maur&quot;) developed different applications and connotations. The term initially denoted a specific Berber people in western Libya, but the name acquired more general meaning during the medieval period, associated with &quot;Muslim&quot;, similar to associations with &quot;Saracens&quot;. During the context of the Crusades and the Reconquista, the term Moors included the derogatory suggestion of &quot;infidels&quot;.

Apart from these historic associations and context, &quot;Moor&quot; and &quot;Moorish&quot; designate a specific ethnic group speaking Hassaniya Arabic. They inhabit Mauritania and parts of Algeria, Western Sahara, Tunisia, Morocco, Niger, and Mali. In Niger and Mali, these peoples are also known as the Azawagh Arabs, after the Azawagh region of the Sahara.

The authoritative dictionary of the Spanish language does not list any derogatory meaning for the word &quot;moro&quot;, a term generally referring to people of Maghrebian origin in particular or Muslims in general. Some authors have pointed out that in modern colloquial Spanish use of the term &quot;moro&quot; is derogatory for Moroccans in particular and Muslims in general.

In the Philippines, a former Spanish colony, many modern Filipinos call the large, local Muslim minority concentrated in Mindanao and other southern islands &quot;Moros&quot;. The word is a catch-all term, as &quot;Moro&quot; may come from several distinct ethno-linguistic groups such as the Maranao people. The term was introduced by Spanish colonisers, and has since been appropriated by Filipino Muslims as an endonym, with many self-identifying as members of the &quot;Bangsamoro&quot; &quot;Moro Nation&quot;.

&quot;&quot; can mean &quot;dark-skinned&quot; in Spain, Portugal, Brazil, and the Philippines. Also in Spanish, &quot;morapio&quot; is a humorous name for &quot;wine&quot;, especially that which has not been &quot;baptized&quot; or mixed with water, i.e., pure unadulterated wine. Among Spanish speakers, &quot;moro&quot; came to have a broader meaning, applied to both Filipino Moros from Mindanao, and the moriscos of Granada. &quot;Moro&quot; refers to all things dark, as in &quot;Moor&quot;, &quot;moreno&quot;, etc. It was also used as a nickname; for instance, the Milanese Duke Ludovico Sforza was called &quot;Il Moro&quot; because of his dark complexion.
In Portugal, &quot;mouro&quot; (feminine,&quot; moura&quot;) may refer to supernatural beings known as enchanted &quot;moura&quot;, where &quot;Moor&quot; implies &quot;alien&quot; and &quot;non-Christian&quot;. These beings were siren-like fairies with golden or reddish hair and a fair face. They were believed to have magical properties. From this root, the name moor is applied to unbaptized children, meaning not Christian. In Basque, &quot;mairu&quot; means moor and also refers to a mythical people.

Muslims located in South Asia were distinguished by the Portuguese historians into two groups: Mouros da Terra (&quot;Moors of the Land&quot;) and the Mouros da Arabia/Mouros de Meca (&quot;Moors from Arabia/Mecca&quot; or &quot;Paradesi Muslims&quot;). The Mouros da Terra were either descendants of any native convert (mostly from any of the former lower or untouchable castes) to Islam or descendants of a marriage alliance between a Middle Eastern individual and an Indian woman.

Within the context of Portuguese colonization, in Sri Lanka (Portuguese Ceylon), Muslims of Arab origin are called &quot;Ceylon Moors&quot;, not to be confused with &quot;Indian Moors&quot; of Sri Lanka (see Sri Lankan Moors). Sri Lankan Moors (a combination of &quot;Ceylon Moors&quot; and &quot;Indian Moors&quot;) make up 12% of the population. The Ceylon Moors (unlike the Indian Moors) are descendants of Arab traders who settled there in the mid-6th century. When the Portuguese arrived in the early 16th century, they labelled all the Muslims in the island as Moors as they saw some of them resembling the Moors in North Africa. The Sri Lankan government continues to identify the Muslims in Sri Lanka as &quot;Sri Lankan Moors&quot;, sub-categorised into &quot;Ceylon Moors&quot; and &quot;Indian Moors&quot;.

The Goan Muslims—a minority community who follow Islam in the western Indian coastal state of Goa—are commonly referred as &quot;Moir&quot; () by Goan Catholics and Hindus. &quot;Moir&quot; is derived from the Portuguese word &quot;mouro&quot; (&quot;Moor&quot;).

== Moors of the Maghreb ==

In the late 7th and early 8th centuries CE, the Islamic Umayyad Caliphate, established after the death of Muhammad, underwent a period of rapid growth. In 647 CE, 40,000 Arabs forced the Byzantine governor of northern Africa to submit and pay tribute, but failed to permanently occupy the region. After an interlude, during which the Muslims fought a civil war, the invasions resumed in 665, seizing Byzantine North Africa up to Bugia over the course of a series of campaigns, lasting until 689. A Byzantine counterattack largely expelled the Arabs but left the region vulnerable. Intermittent war over the inland provinces of North Africa continued for the next two decades. Further civil war delayed the continuation of further conquest, but an Arab assault took Carthage and held it against a Byzantine counterattack.

Although a Christian and pagan Berber rebellion pushed out the Arabs temporarily, the Romanized urban population preferred the Arabs to the Berbers and welcomed a renewed and final conquest that left northern Africa in Muslim hands by 698. Over the next decades, the Berber and urban populations of northern Africa gradually converted to Islam, although for separate reasons. The Arabic language was also adopted. Initially, the Arabs required only vassalage from the local inhabitants rather than assimilation, a process which took a considerable time. The groups that inhabited the Maghreb following this process became known collectively as Moors. Although a Kharijite rebellion would later push out Umayyad rule from the western Maghreb and form temporarily independent Arab, Berber and Persian dynasties, that effort failed to dislodge the usage of the collective term.

=== Modern use in parts of the Maghreb ===
The term has been applied at times to urban and coastal populations of the Maghreb, the term in these regions nowadays is rather used to denote the Arab-Berber populations (occasionally somewhat mixed-race) living in Western Sahara, and Hassaniya-speaking populations, mainly in Mauritania, Western Sahara, and Northwestern Mali.

==Moors of Iberia==

In 711 the Islamic Arabs and Moors of Berber descent in northern Africa crossed the Strait of Gibraltar onto the Iberian Peninsula, and in a series of raids they conquered Visigothic Christian Hispania. Their general, Tariq ibn Ziyad, brought most of Iberia under Islamic rule in an eight-year campaign. They continued northeast across the Pyrenees Mountains but were defeated by the Franks under Charles Martel at the Battle of Tours in 732.

The Maghreb fell into a civil war in 739 that lasted until 743 known as the Berber Revolt. The Berbers revolted against the Umayyads, putting an end to Eastern dominion over the Maghreb. Despite racial tensions, Arabs and Berbers intermarried frequently. A few years later, the Eastern branch of the Umayyad dynasty was dethroned by the Abbasids and the Umayyad Caliphate overthrown in the Abbasid revolution (746–750). Abd al-Rahman I, who was of Arab-Berber lineage, managed to evade the Abbasids and flee to the Maghreb and then Iberia, where he founded the Emirate of Córdoba and the Andalusian branch of the Umayyad dynasty. The Moors ruled northern Africa and Al-Andalus for several centuries thereafter. Ibn Hazm, the polymath, mentions that many of the Caliphs in the Umayyad Caliphate and the Caliphate of Córdoba were blond and had light eyes. Ibn Hazm mentions that he preferred blondes, and notes that there was much interest in blondes in al-Andalus amongst the rulers and regular Muslims:

The languages spoken in the parts of the Iberian Peninsula under Muslim rule were Andalusian Arabic and Mozarabic; they became extinct after the expulsion of the Moriscos, but Arabic language influence on the Spanish language can still be found today. The Muslims were resisted in parts of the Iberian Peninsula in areas of the northwest (such as Asturias, where they were defeated at the battle of Covadonga) and the largely Basque Country in the Pyrenees. Though the number of Moorish colonists was small, many native Iberian inhabitants converted to Islam. By 1000, according to Ronald Segal, some 5,000,000 of Iberia&#x27;s 7,000,000 inhabitants, most of them descended from indigenous Iberian converts, were Muslim. There were also Sub-Saharan Africans who had been absorbed into al-Andalus to be used as soldiers and slaves. The Berber and Sub-Saharan African soldiers were known as &quot;tangerines&quot; because they were imported through Tangier.

The Caliphate of Córdoba collapsed in 1031 and the Islamic territory in Iberia fell under the rule of the Almohad Caliphate in 1153. This second stage was guided by a version of Islam that left behind the more tolerant practices of the past. Al-Andalus broke up into a number of taifas (fiefs), which were partly consolidated under the Caliphate of Córdoba.

The Kingdom of Asturias, a small northwestern Christian Iberian kingdom, initiated the &quot;Reconquista&quot; (&quot;Reconquest&quot;) soon after the Islamic conquest in the 8th century. Christian states based in the north and west slowly extended their power over the rest of Iberia. The Kingdom of Navarre, the Kingdom of Galicia, the Kingdom of León, the Kingdom of Portugal, the Kingdom of Aragon, the &quot;Marca Hispánica&quot;, and the Crown of Castile began a process of expansion and internal consolidation during the next several centuries under the flag of Reconquista. In 1212, a coalition of Christian kings under the leadership of Alfonso VIII of Castile drove the Muslims from Central Iberia. The Portuguese side of the Reconquista ended in 1249 with the conquest of the Algarve ( – &quot;al-Gharb&quot;) under Afonso III. He was the first Portuguese monarch to claim the title &quot;King of Portugal and the Algarve&quot;.

The Moorish Kingdom of Granada continued for three more centuries in southern Iberia. On 2 January 1492, the leader of the last Muslim stronghold in Granada surrendered to the armies of a recently united Christian Spain (after the marriage of Ferdinand II of Aragón and Isabella I of Castile, the &quot;Catholic Monarchs&quot;). The Moorish inhabitants received no military aid or rescue from other Muslim nations. The remaining Jews were also forced to leave Spain, convert to Roman Catholic Christianity, or be killed for refusing to do so. In 1480, to exert social and religious control, Isabella and Ferdinand agreed to allow the Inquisition in Spain. The Muslim population of Granada rebelled in 1499. The revolt lasted until early 1501, giving the Castilian authorities an excuse to void the terms of the Treaty of Granada (1491). In 1501, Castilian authorities delivered an ultimatum to the Muslims of Granada: they could either convert to Christianity or be expelled.
The Inquisition was aimed mostly at Jews and Muslims who had overtly converted to Christianity but were thought to be practicing their faiths secretly. They were respectively called &quot;marranos&quot; and &quot;moriscos&quot;. However, in 1567 King Philip II directed Moriscos to give up their Arabic names and traditional dress, and prohibited the use of Arabic. In reaction, there was a Morisco uprising in the Alpujarras from 1568 to 1571. In the years from 1609 to 1614, the government expelled Moriscos. The historian Henri Lapeyre estimated that this affected 300,000 out of an estimated total of 8 million inhabitants.

Some Muslims converted to Christianity and remained permanently in Iberia. This is indicated by a &quot;high mean proportion of ancestry from North African (10.6%)&quot; that &quot;attests to a high level of religious conversion (whether voluntary or enforced), driven by historical episodes of social and religious intolerance, that ultimately led to the integration of descendants.&quot; According to historian Richard A. Fletcher, &quot;the number of Arabs who settled in Iberia was very small. &#x27;Moorish&#x27; Iberia does at least have the merit of reminding us that the bulk of the invaders and settlers were Moors, i.e., Berbers from Algeria and Morocco.&quot;

In the meantime, Spanish and Portuguese expeditions westward from the New World spread Christianity to India, the Malay Peninsula, Indonesia, and the Philippines. By 1521, the ships of Magellan had reached that island archipelago, which they named &quot;Las Islas Filipinas&quot;, after Philip II of Spain. In Mindanao, the Spaniards named the kris-bearing people as Moros or &#x27;Moors&#x27;. Today this ethnic group in Mindanao, who are generally Filipino Muslim, are called &quot;Moros&quot;.

==Moors of Sicily==

The first Muslim conquest of Sicily began in 827, though it was not until 902 that almost the entire island was in the control of the Aghlabids, from their capital Kairouan (Tunisia), with the exception of some minor strongholds in the rugged interior. During that period some parts of southern Italy fell under Muslim control, most notably the port city of Bari, which formed the Emirate of Bari from 847 to 871. In 909, the Aghlabids was replaced by the Isma&#x27;ili rulers of the Fatimid Caliphate. Four years later, the Fatimid governor was ousted from Palermo when the island declared its independence under Emir Ahmed ibn-Kohrob. The language spoken in Sicily under Muslim rule was Siculo-Arabic.

In 1038, a Byzantine army under George Maniakes crossed the strait of Messina. This army included a corps of Normans that saved the situation in the first clash against the Muslims from Messina. After another decisive victory in the summer of 1040, Maniaces halted his march to lay siege to Syracuse. Despite his success, Maniaces was removed from his position, and the subsequent Muslim counter-offensive reconquered all the cities captured by the Byzantines.

The Norman Robert Guiscard, son of Tancred, invaded Sicily in 1060. The island was split between three Arab emirs, and the Christian population in many parts of the island rose up against the ruling Muslims. One year later, Messina fell, and in 1072 Palermo was taken by the Normans. The loss of the cities, each with a splendid harbor, dealt a severe blow to Muslim power on the island. Eventually all of Sicily was taken. In 1091, Noto in the southern tip of Sicily and the island of Malta, the last Arab strongholds, fell to the Christians. Islamic authors noted the tolerance of the Norman kings of Sicily. Ali ibn al-Athir wrote: &quot;They [the Muslims] were treated kindly, and they were protected, even against the Franks. Because of that, they had great love for King Roger.&quot;

The Muslim problem characterized Hohenstaufen rule in Sicily under Holy Roman Emperors Henry VI and his son, Frederick II. Many repressive measures were introduced by Frederick II to appease the popes, who were intolerant of Islam in the heart of Christendom. This resulted in a rebellion by Sicilian Muslims, which in turn triggered organized resistance and systematic reprisals and marked the final chapter of Islam in Sicily. The complete eviction of Muslims and the annihilation of Islam in Sicily was completed by the late 1240s when the final deportations to Lucera took place.

The remaining population of Sicilian Muslims converted to Catholicism due to the incentives put in place by Fredrich II. Some Muslims from Lucera would also later convert due to oppression on the mainland and had their property returned to them and returned to Sicily.

During the reigns of Frederick II as well as his son, Manfred, a large amount of Muslims were brought, as slaves, to farm lands and perform domestic labor. Enslaved persons in Sicily were not afforded the same privileges as the Muslims in mainland Italy. The trend of importing a considerable amount of slaves from the Muslim world did not stop with the Hohenstaufen but was amplified under the Aragonese and Spanish crowns, and was in fact continued until as late as 1838 The majority of which would also come receive the label &#x27;Moors&#x27;

== Architecture ==
Moorish architecture is the articulated Islamic architecture of northern Africa and parts of Spain and Portugal, where the Moors were dominant between 711 and 1492. The best surviving examples of this architectural tradition are the Mosque–Cathedral of Córdoba and the Alhambra in Granada (mainly 1338–1390), as well as the Giralda in Seville (1184). Other notable examples include the ruined palace city of Medina Azahara (936–1010) and the Mosque of Cristo de la Luz, now a church, in Toledo, the Aljafería in Zaragoza and baths such as those at Ronda and Alhama de Granada.

==In heraldry==


Moors—or more frequently their heads, often crowned—appear with some frequency in medieval European heraldry, though less so since the Middle Ages. The term ascribed to them in Anglo-Norman &quot;blazon&quot; (the language of English heraldry) is &quot;maure&quot;, though they are also sometimes called &quot;moore&quot;, &quot;blackmoor&quot;, &quot;blackamoor&quot; or &quot;negro&quot;. Maures appear in European heraldry from at least as early as the 13th century, and some have been attested as early as the 11th century in Italy, where they have persisted in the local heraldry and vexillology well into modern times in Corsica and Sardinia.

Armigers bearing moors or moors&#x27; heads may have adopted them for any of several reasons, to include symbolizing military victories in the Crusades, as a pun on the bearer&#x27;s name in the canting arms of Morese, Negri, Saraceni, etc., or in the case of Frederick II, possibly to demonstrate the reach of his empire. The arms of Pope Benedict XVI feature a moor&#x27;s head, crowned and collared red, in reference to the arms of Freising, Germany. In the case of Corsica and Sardinia, the blindfolded moors&#x27; heads in the four quarters have long been said to represent the four Moorish emirs who were defeated by Peter I of Aragon and Pamplona in the 11th century, the four moors&#x27; heads around a cross having been adopted to the arms of Aragon around 1281–1387, and Corsica and Sardinia having come under the dominion of the king of Aragon in 1297. In Corsica, the blindfolds were lifted to the brow in the 18th century as a way of expressing the island&#x27;s newfound independence.

The use of Moors (and particularly their heads) as a heraldic symbol has been deprecated in modern North America. For example, the College of Arms of the Society for Creative Anachronism urges applicants to use them delicately to avoid causing offence.

== In popular culture ==

<doc id="45132" wikidata="Q2891657" url="?curid=45132" title="Truth condition">
<text>In semantics and pragmatics, a truth condition is the condition under which a sentence is . For example, &quot;It is snowing in Nebraska&quot; is true precisely when it is snowing in Nebraska. Truth conditions of a sentence do not necessarily reflect current reality. They are merely the conditions under which the statement would be true.

More formally, a truth condition makes for the truth of a sentence in an inductive definition of truth (for details, see the semantic theory of truth). Understood this way, truth conditions are theoretical entities. To illustrate with an example: suppose that, in a particular truth theory which is a theory of truth where truth is somehow made acceptable despite semantic terms as close as possible, the word &quot;Nixon&quot; refers to Richard M. Nixon, and &quot;is alive&quot; is associated with the set of currently living things. Then one way of representing the truth condition of &quot;Nixon is alive&quot; is as the ordered pair &lt;Nixon, {x: x is alive}&gt;. And we say that &quot;Nixon is alive&quot; is true if and only if the referent (or referent of) &quot;Nixon&quot; belongs to the set associated with &quot;is alive&quot;, that is, if and only if Nixon is alive.

In semantics, the truth condition of a sentence is almost universally considered distinct from its meaning. The meaning of a sentence is conveyed if the truth conditions for the sentence are understood. Additionally, there are many sentences that are understood although their truth condition is uncertain. One popular argument for this view is that some sentences are necessarily true—that is, they are true whatever happens to obtain. All such sentences have the same truth conditions, but arguably do not thereby have the same meaning. Likewise, the sets {x: x is alive} and {x: x is alive and x is not a rock} are identical—they have precisely the same members—but presumably the sentences &quot;Nixon is alive&quot; and &quot;Nixon is alive and is not a rock&quot; have different meanings.

<doc id="45133" wikidata="Q936276" url="?curid=45133" title="The Wind in the Willows">
<text>The Wind in the Willows is a children&#x27;s novel by the British novelist Kenneth Grahame, first published in 1908. It details the story of Mole, Ratty, and Badger as they try to help Mr. Toad, after he becomes obsessed with motorcars and gets into trouble. It also details short stories about them that are disconnected from the main narrative. The novel was based on bedtime stories Grahame told his son Alastair. It has been adapted numerous times for both stage and screen.

&quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; received negative reviews upon its initial release, but it has since become a classic of British literature. It was listed at No. 16 in the BBC&#x27;s survey The Big Read and has been adapted multiple times in different media.

==Background==

In 1899, at age 40, Kenneth Grahame married Elspeth Thomson, the daughter of Robert William Thomson. The next year they had their only child, a boy named Alastair (nicknamed &quot;Mouse&quot;). He was born premature, blind in one eye, and plagued by health problems throughout his life. When Alastair was about four years old, Grahame would tell him bedtime stories, some of which were about a toad, and on his frequent boating holidays without his family he would write further tales of Toad, Mole, Ratty, and Badger in letters to Alastair.

In 1908, Grahame took early retirement from his position as secretary of the Bank of England. He moved with his wife and son to an old farmhouse in Blewbury, Berkshire. There, he used the bedtime stories he had told Alastair as a basis for the manuscript of &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot;.

==Plot summary==
With the arrival of spring and fine weather outside, the good-natured Mole loses patience with spring cleaning, exclaiming, &quot;Hang spring cleaning!&quot; He leaves behind his underground home and comes up at the bank of the river, which he has never seen before. Here he meets Rat, a water vole, who takes Mole for a ride in his rowing boat. They get along well and spend many more days boating, with &quot;Ratty&quot; teaching Mole the ways of the river, with the two friends living together in Ratty&#x27;s riverside home.

One summer day, Rat and Mole disembark near the grand Toad Hall and pay a visit to Toad. Toad is rich, jovial, friendly, and kindhearted, but sometimes arrogant and rash; he regularly becomes obsessed with current fads, only to abandon them abruptly. His current craze is his horse-drawn caravan. When a passing car scares his horse and causes the caravan to overturn into a ditch, Toad&#x27;s craze for caravan travel is immediately replaced by an obsession with motorcars.

Mole goes to the Wild Wood on a snowy winter&#x27;s day, hoping to meet the elusive but virtuous and wise Badger. He gets lost in the woods, succumbs to fright, and hides among the sheltering roots of a tree. Rat finds him as snow begins to fall in earnest. Attempting to find their way home, Mole barks his shin on the boot scraper on Badger&#x27;s doorstep. Badger welcomes Rat and Mole to his large, cosy underground home, providing them with hot food, dry clothes, and reassuring conversation. Badger learns from his visitors that Toad has crashed seven cars, has been in hospital three times, and has spent a fortune on fines.

With the arrival of spring, the three of them put Toad under house arrest with themselves as the guards, but Toad pretends to be sick and tricks Ratty to leave so he can escape. Badger and Mole continue to live in Toad Hall in the hope that Toad may return. Toad orders lunch at The Red Lion Inn and then sees a motorcar pull into the courtyard. Taking the car, he drives it recklessly, is caught by the police, and is sent to prison for 20 years.

In prison, Toad gains the sympathy of the gaoler&#x27;s daughter, who helps him to escape disguised as a washerwoman. After a long series of misadventures, he returns to the hole of the Water Rat. Rat hauls Toad inside and informs him that Toad Hall has been taken over by weasels, stoats, and ferrets from the Wild Wood, who have driven out Mole and Badger. Armed to the teeth, Badger, Rat, Mole, and Toad enter through the tunnel and pounce upon the unsuspecting Wild-Wooders who are holding a celebratory party. Having driven away the intruders, Toad holds a banquet to mark his return, during which he behaves both quietly and humbly. He makes up for his earlier excesses by seeking out and compensating those he has wronged, and the four friends live happily ever after.

In addition to the main narrative, the book contains several independent short stories featuring Rat and Mole, such as an encounter with the wild god Pan while searching for Otter&#x27;s son Portly, and Ratty&#x27;s meeting with a Sea Rat. These appear for the most part between the chapters chronicling Toad&#x27;s adventures, and they are often omitted from adaptations of the story, as well as some abridged versions.

==Main characters==
* Mole: known as &quot;Moley&quot; to his friends. An independent, timid, genial, thoughtful, home-loving animal and the first character introduced in the story. Discontent with spring cleaning in his secluded home, he ventures into the outside world. Initially intimidated by the hectic lifestyle of the riverbank, he eventually adapts with the support of his new friend Rat. He has a spontaneous intelligence moment with his trickery against the Wild Wooders before the battle to retake Toad Hall.
* Rat: known as &quot;Ratty&quot; to his friends (though actually a water vole), he is astute, charming, and affable. He enjoys a life of leisure; when not spending time on the river, he composes doggerel. Ratty loves the river and befriends Mole. He can be very unsettled about subjects and endeavours outside his preferred routine, but is persistently loyal and does the right thing when needed, such as when he risks his life to save Mole in the Wild Wood, and helps rid Toad Hall of the unruly weasels. Ratty is the free and easy sort, as well as a dreamer, and he has a poetic thought process, finding deeper meaning, beauty, and intensity in situations others may see through more practical eyes.
* Mr. Toad: known as &quot;Toady&quot; to his friends, the wealthy scion of Toad Hall who inherited his wealth from his late father. He is gregarious and well-meaning, but as a fixated control freak, he is sometimes inclined to boast lavishly and make outrageous outbursts when held back by another character, regardless of their intentions with him. He is prone to obsessions (such as punting, houseboats, and horse-drawn caravans) but gets dissatisfied with each of these activities and drops them fairly quickly, finally settling on motorcars. His motoring craze degenerates into a sort of addiction that lands him in the hospital a few times, subjects him to expensive fines for his unlawfully erratic driving, and eventually gets him imprisoned for theft, dangerous-driving, and severe impertinence to the police. Two chapters of the book chronicle his daring escape from prison.
* Mr. Badger: a firm but considerate animal, Badger embodies the &quot;wise hermit&quot; figure. A friend of Toad&#x27;s deceased father, he is strict with the immature Toad, yet hopes that his good qualities will prevail through his shortcomings. He lives in a vast underground sett, part of which incorporates the remains of a buried Roman settlement. A fearless and powerful fighter, Badger helps clear the Wild-Wooders from Toad Hall with his large stick.

==Supporting characters==
* Otter and Portly: a good friend of Ratty with a stereotypical &quot;Cockney costermonger&quot; character, Otter is confident, respected and headstrong. Portly is his young son.
* The weasels, ferrets, and stoats: the story&#x27;s main antagonists. They plot to take over Toad Hall. Although they are unnamed, the leader is referred to as &quot;Chief Weasel&quot;.
* Pan: a gentle and wise god of the wild who makes a single, anomalous appearance in Chapter 7, &quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot;, when he helps Portly and looks after him until Ratty and Mole find him.
* The Gaoler&#x27;s Daughter: the only major human character, she embodies the youth perspective toward the situation faced by Toad whilst he is incarcerated in prison; a &quot;good, kind, clever girl&quot;, she helps Toad escape.
* The Wayfarer: a vagabond seafaring rat, who also makes a single appearance in Chapter 9, &quot;Wayfarers All&quot;. Ratty briefly contemplates accompanying him on his adventures, before Mole convinces him otherwise.
* Squirrels and rabbits, who are generally good-natured (although rabbits are described as &quot;a mixed lot&quot;).
* Inhabitants of the Wild Wood: weasels, stoats, and foxes who are described by Ratty as &quot;All-right in a way but well, you can&#x27;t really trust them&quot;.
* The Engine Driver: An unnamed man who drives a steam engine on the railway. When Toad is in his washerwoman disguise and unable to purchase a ticket to the station nearest to Toad Hall, the driver takes sympathy upon hearing Toad&#x27;s false tale of woe and gives him a free ride on the engine, with the promise that he wash a few of the driver&#x27;s clothes. During the journey, the driver becomes aware that Toad isn&#x27;t really a washerwoman, upon sighting a single engine that is following them and carrying officials of the law who try to get his attention. Once Toad confesses his actions, the driver thinks he should turn Toad in, but not having a fancy for motorcars nor being ordered about on his own engine, he allows Toad to escape after the train has passed through a tunnel.
* The Barge Woman: An unnamed woman who owns a barge. Like the Engine Driver, she is briefly fooled by Toad&#x27;s washerwoman disguise and offers Toad a ride, with the promise that he wash her clothes. Upon realising that he is actually a toad, she throws him off the barge and into a river flowing by. Toad gets infuriated and decides to take revenge by leaving the river and stealing the horse of the barge woman.

==Editions==
The original publication of the book was plain text, with a frontispiece illustrated by Graham Robertson, but many illustrated, comic, and annotated versions have been published over the years. Notable illustrators include Paul Bransom (1913), Nancy Barnhart (1922), Wyndham Payne (1927), Ernest H. Shepard (1931), Arthur Rackham (1940), Richard Cuffari (1966), Tasha Tudor (1966), Michael Hague (1980), Scott McKowen (2005), and Robert Ingpen (2007).

* The 1927 edition illustrated by Wyndham Payne was noted for its use of a distinctive colour of yellow, described by some cultural commentators as canary yellow.
* The most popular illustrations are probably by E. H. Shepard, originally published in 1931, and believed to be authorised as Grahame was pleased with the initial sketches, although he did not live to see the completed work.
* &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; was the last work illustrated by Arthur Rackham. The book with his illustrations was issued posthumously in a limited edition by the Folio Society with 16 colour plates in 1940 in the US. It was not issued with the Rackham illustrations in the UK until 1950.
* The Folio Society 2006 edition featured 85 illustrations, 35 in colour, by Charles van Sandwyk. A fancier centenary edition was produced two years later.
* Michel Plessix created a &quot;Wind in the Willows&quot; watercolour comic album series, which helped to introduce the stories to France. They have been translated into English by Cinebook Ltd.
* Patrick Benson re-illustrated the story in 1994 and HarperCollins published it in 1994 together with the William Horwood sequels &quot;The Willows in Winter, Toad Triumphant&quot; and &quot;The Willows and Beyond&quot;. It was published in the US in 1995 by St. Martin&#x27;s Press.
* Inga Moore&#x27;s edition, abridged and illustrated by her, is arranged so that a featured line of the text also serves as a caption to a picture.
* Barnes &amp; Noble Classics featured an introduction by Gardner McFall in 2007. New York, 
* Egmont Press produced a 100th Anniversary paperback edition, with Shepard&#x27;s illustrations, in 2008. 
* Belknap Press, a division of Harvard University Press, published Seth Lerer&#x27;s annotated edition in 2009.
* W. W. Norton published Annie Gauger&#x27;s and Brian Jacques&#x27;s annotated edition in 2009.
* Jamie Hendry Productions published a special edition of the novel in 2015 and donated it to schools in Plymouth and Salford to celebrate the World Premiere of the musical version of &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; by Julian Fellowes, George Stiles, and Anthony Drewe.
* IDW Publishing published an illustrated edition of the novel in 2016. The hardcover novel features illustrations from Eisner Award-winning artist David Petersen, who is best known for creating and drawing the comic series &quot;Mouse Guard&quot;.
* Simon &amp; Schuster published a lavishly illustrated edition in 2017. Illustrator Sebastian Meschenmoser created more than 100 expressive watercolour vignettes and a dozen lush oil paintings.

==Reception==
A number of publishers rejected the manuscript. It was published in the UK by Methuen and Co., and later in the US by Scribner. The critics, who were hoping for a third volume in the style of Grahame&#x27;s earlier works, &quot;The Golden Age&quot; and &quot;Dream Days&quot;, generally gave negative reviews. The public loved it, however, and within a few years it sold in such numbers that many reprints were required, with 100 editions reached in Britain alone by 1951. In 1909, then US President Theodore Roosevelt wrote to Grahame to tell that he had &quot;read it and reread it, and have come to accept the characters as old friends&quot;.

In &quot;The Enchanted Places&quot;, Christopher Robin Milne wrote of &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot;:

It was to mix live action with CG animation, and the director explained why he had to leave the helm. &quot;It was a beautiful book, and then I went to meet with the executives and they said, &#x27;Could you give Toad a skateboard and make him say, &quot;radical dude&quot; things?&#x27; and that&#x27;s when I said, &#x27;It&#x27;s been a pleasure ...

===Sequels and alternative versions===
* Jan Needle&#x27;s &quot;Wild Wood&quot; was published in 1981 with illustrations by William Rushton (). It is a re-telling of the story of &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; from the point of view of the working-class inhabitants of the Wild Wood. For them, money is short and employment hard to find. They have a very different perspective on the wealthy, easy, careless lifestyle of Toad and his friends.
* Dixon Scott&#x27;s &quot;A Fresh Wind in the Willows&quot;, illustrated by Jonathon Coudrille, was published by Heinemann/Quixote in England in 1983 and Dell Yearling in the United States in 1987.
* William Horwood created several sequels to &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot;: &quot;The Willows in Winter&quot;, &quot;Toad Triumphant&quot;, &quot;The Willows and Beyond&quot;, and &quot;The Willows at Christmas&quot; (1999). These books include some of the same incidents as Scott&#x27;s sequel, including a climax in which Toad steals a Bleriot monoplane.
* Jacqueline Kelly&#x27;s sequel &quot;Return to the Willows&quot; was published in 2012.
* Kij Johnson published &quot;The River Bank&quot; in 2017. If &quot;Wild Wood&quot; reimagined Grahame&#x27;s work through a shift of class, Johnson&#x27;s work may be said to do the same thing through shift of gender.
* Daniel Mallory Ortberg included the story &quot;Some of Us Had Been Threatening Our Friend Mr. Toad,&quot; which blends &quot;Wind in the Willows&quot; with the Donald Barthelme short story &quot;Some of Us Had Been Threatening Our Friend Colby,&quot; in his 2018 collection &quot;The Merry Spinster: Tales of Everyday Horror&quot;. In Ortberg&#x27;s retelling, Toad&#x27;s friends are abusive and use the guise of &quot;rescuing&quot; their friend to justify violence and manipulation.
* Frederick Thurber&#x27;s &quot;In the Wake of the Willows&quot; was published in 2019. It is the New World version of the original, recounting the adventures of the same set of characters and their children, who lived on a coastal estuary in southern New England.
* Dina Gregory released an all-female adaptation on Audible in 2020. The story sticks very closely to the original, but with Lady Toad, Mistress Badger, Miss Water Rat, and Mrs Mole.
* Peter Darne’s and Leon Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; was published as an audiobook in 2024 with original illustrations by Peter Darnes. The illustrations are based on the early artistic style of Peter Darnes drawings from his childhood, using soft pastel pencils. The adaptation is an infusion of telling the story of &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; with the classic texts and characters, supported by newly produced music and soundscapes to give the audiobook a modern take. The audiobook was produced by British award winning director and BAFTA member Leon Mitchell.

==Awards==
* Mr. Toad was voted Number 38 among the 100 Best Characters in Fiction Since 1900 by &quot;Book&quot; magazine in their March/April 2002 issue.

==Inspiration==
Mapledurham House in Oxfordshire was an inspiration for Toad Hall, although Hardwick House and Fawley Court also make this claim.

The village of Lerryn in Cornwall claims to be the setting for the book.

Simon Winchester suggested that the character of Ratty was based on Frederick Furnivall, a keen oarsman and acquaintance of Grahame. However, Grahame himself said that this character was inspired by his good friend, the writer Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch. Grahame wrote this in a signed copy he gave to Quiller-Couch&#x27;s daughter, Foy Felicia.

&quot;The Scotsman&quot; and &quot;Oban Times&quot; suggested was inspired by the Crinan Canal, because Grahame spent some of his childhood in Ardrishaig.

There is a proposal that the idea for the story arose when its author saw a water vole beside the River Pang in Berkshire, southern England. A 29 hectare extension to the nature reserve at Moor Copse, near Tidmarsh Berkshire, was acquired in January 2007 by the Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust.

Peter Ackroyd, in his book &quot;Thames: Sacred River&quot;, asserts that &quot;Quarry Wood, bordering on the river [Thames] at Cookham Dean, is the original of [the] &#x27;Wild Wood&#x27;...&quot;

===Adventure rides===
* Mr. Toad&#x27;s Wild Ride is the name of a ride at Disneyland in Anaheim, California, and a former attraction at Disney&#x27;s Magic Kingdom in Orlando, Florida, inspired by Toad&#x27;s motorcar adventure. It is the only ride with an alternative Latin title, given as the inscription on Toad&#x27;s Hall: &quot;Toadi Acceleratio Semper Absurda&quot; (&quot;Toad&#x27;s Ever-Absurd Acceleration&quot;). After the removal of the ride from the Magic Kingdom, a statue of Toad was added to the cemetery outside the Haunted Mansion attraction in the same park.
* The Toad Hall Restaurant inspired by Toad’s home is located in Fantasyland at Disneyland Paris and serves traditional English fish and chips, tea and cake.

<text>Discourse is a generalization of the notion of a conversation to any form of communication. Discourse is a major topic in social theory, with work spanning fields such as sociology, anthropology, continental philosophy, and discourse analysis. Following work by Michel Foucault, these fields view discourse as a system of thought, knowledge, or communication that constructs our world experience. Since control of discourse amounts to control of how the world is perceived, social theory often studies discourse as a window into power. Within theoretical linguistics, discourse is understood more narrowly as linguistic information exchange and was one of the major motivations for the framework of dynamic semantics. In these expressions, denotations are equated with their ability to update a discourse context.

== Social theory==
In the humanities and social sciences, discourse describes a formal way of thinking that can be expressed through language. Discourse is a social boundary that defines what statements can be said about a topic. Many definitions of discourse are primarily derived from the work of French philosopher Michel Foucault. In sociology, &quot;discourse&quot; is defined as &quot;any practice (found in a wide range of forms) by which individuals imbue reality with meaning&quot;.

Political science sees discourse as closely linked to politics and policy making. Likewise, different theories among various disciplines understand discourse as linked to power and state, insofar as the control of &quot;discourses&quot; is understood as a hold on reality itself (e.g. if a state controls the media, they control the &quot;truth&quot;). In essence, &quot;discourse&quot; is inescapable, since any use of language will have an effect on individual perspectives. In other words, the chosen discourse provides the vocabulary, expressions, or style needed to communicate. For example, two notably distinct discourses can be used about various guerrilla movements, describing them either as &quot;freedom fighters&quot; or &quot;terrorists&quot;.

In psychology, discourses are embedded in different rhetorical genres and meta-genres that constrain and enable them—language talking about language. This is exemplified in the APA&#x27;s &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot;, which tells of the terms that have to be used in speaking about mental health, thereby mediating meanings and dictating practices of professionals in psychology and psychiatry.

===Modernism===
Modernist theorists focused on achieving progress and believed in natural and social laws that could be used universally to develop knowledge and, thus, a better understanding of society. Such theorists would be preoccupied with obtaining the &quot;truth&quot; and &quot;reality&quot;, seeking to develop theories which contained certainty and predictability. Modernist theorists therefore understood discourse to be functional. Discourse and language transformations are ascribed to progress or the need to develop new or more &quot;accurate&quot; words to describe discoveries, understandings, or areas of interest. In modernist theory, language and discourse are dissociated from power and ideology and instead conceptualized as &quot;natural&quot; products of common sense usage or progress. Modernism further gave rise to the liberal discourses of rights, equality, freedom, and justice; however, this rhetoric masked substantive inequality and failed to account for differences, according to Regnier.

===Structuralism (Saussure and Lacan)===
Structuralist theorists, such as Ferdinand de Saussure and Jacques Lacan, argue that all human actions and social formations are related to language and can be understood as systems of related elements. This means that the &quot;individual elements of a system only have significance when considered about the structure as a whole, and that structures are to be understood as self-contained, self-regulated, and self-transforming entities&quot;. In other words, it is the structure itself that determines the significance, meaning, and function of the individual elements of a system. Structuralism has contributed to our understanding of language and social systems. Saussure&#x27;s theory of language highlights the decisive role of meaning and signification in structuring human life more generally.

===Poststructuralism (Foucault)===
Following the perceived limitations of the modern era, emerged postmodern theory. Postmodern theorists rejected modernist claims that there was one theoretical approach that explained all aspects of society. Rather, postmodernist theorists were interested in examining the variety of experiences of individuals and groups and emphasized differences over similarities and shared experiences.

In contrast to modernist theory, postmodern theory is pessimistic regarding universal truths and realities. Hence, it has attempted to be fluid, allowing for individual differences as it rejects the notion of social laws. Postmodern theorists shifted away from truth-seeking and sought answers to how truths are produced and sustained. Postmodernists contended that truth and knowledge are plural, contextual, and historically produced through discourses. Postmodern researchers, therefore, embarked on analyzing discourses such as texts, language, policies, and practices.

=== Foucault ===
In the works of the philosopher Michel Foucault, a &quot;discourse&quot; is &quot;an entity of sequences, of signs, in that they are enouncements (&quot;énoncés&quot;).&quot; The enouncement (&quot;l’énoncé&quot;, &quot;the statement&quot;) is a linguistic construct that allows the writer and the speaker to assign meaning to words and to communicate repeatable semantic relations to, between, and among the statements, objects, or subjects of the discourse. Internal ties exist between the signs (semiotic sequences). The term discursive formation identifies and describes written and spoken statements with semantic relations that produce discourses. As a researcher, Foucault applied the discursive formation to analyses of large bodies of knowledge, e.g. political economy and natural history.

In &quot;The Archaeology of Knowledge&quot; (1969), a treatise about the methodology and historiography of systems of thought (&quot;epistemes&quot;) and knowledge (&quot;discursive formations&quot;), Michel Foucault developed the concepts of discourse. The sociologist Iara Lessa summarizes Foucault&#x27;s definition of discourse as &quot;systems of thoughts composed of ideas, attitudes, courses of action, beliefs, and practices that systematically construct the subjects and the worlds of which they speak.&quot; Foucault traces the role of discourse in the legitimation of society&#x27;s power to construct contemporary truths, to maintain said truths, and to determine what relations of power exist among the constructed truths; therefore discourse is a communications medium through which power relations produce men and women who can speak.

The interrelation between power and knowledge renders every human relationship into a power negotiation, Because power is always present and so produces and constrains the truth. Power is exercised through rules of exclusion (discourses) that determine what subjects people can discuss; when, where, and how a person may speak; and determines which persons are allowed to speak. That knowledge is both the &quot;creator&quot; of power and the &quot;creation&quot; of power, Foucault coined &quot;power/knowledge&quot; to show that it is &quot;an abstract force which determines what will be known, rather than assuming that individual thinkers develop ideas and knowledge.&quot; 

Interdiscourse studies the external semantic relations among discourses, as discourses exists in relation to other discourses.

== Discourse analysis ==
There is more than one type of discourse analysis, and the definition of &quot;discourse&quot; shifts slightly between types. Generally speaking, discourse analyses can be divided into those concerned with &quot;little d&quot; discourse and &quot;big D&quot; Discourse. The former (&quot;little d&quot;) refers to language-in-use, such as spoken communication; the latter (&quot;big D&quot;) refers to sociopolitical discourses (language plus social and cultural contexts).

Common forms of discourse analysis include: 

* Critical discourse analysis
* Conversation analysis
* Foucauldian discourse analysis
* Genre analysis
* Narrative analysis

== Formal semantics and pragmatics ==
In formal semantics and pragmatics, discourse is often viewed as the process of refining the information in a common ground. In some theories of semantics, such as discourse representation theory, sentences&#x27; denotations themselves are equated with functions that update a common ground.

<text>Georg Major (April 25, 1502 – November 28, 1574) was a Lutheran theologian of the Protestant Reformation. 

==Life==
Major was born in Nuremberg in 1502. At the age of nine he was sent to Wittenberg, and in 1521 he entered the university there. He was a student of Martin Luther and Philip Melanchthon, the latter being a particular influence. When Cruciger returned to Wittenberg in 1529, Major was appointed rector of the Johannisschule in Magdeburg, but in 1537 he became court preacher at Wittenberg and was ordained by Martin Luther. He began to lecture on theology in 1541.

In 1545 he joined the theological faculty, and his authority increased to such an extent that in the following year the elector sent him to the Conference of Regensburg, where he was soon captivated by the personality of Butzer. Like Philipp Melanchthon, he fled before the disastrous close of the Schmalkald war, and found refuge in Magdeburg. In the summer of 1547, he returned to Wittenberg, and in the same year became cathedral superintendent at Merseburg, although he resumed his activity at the university in the following year.

In the negotiations of the Augsburg Interim, he took the part of Melanchthon in first opposing it and then making concessions. This attitude incurred the enmity of the opponents of the Interim, especially after he cancelled a number of passages in the second edition of his &quot;Psalterium&quot; in which he had violently attacked the position of Maurice, Elector of Saxony, whom he now requested to prohibit all polemical treatises proceeding from Magdeburg, while he condemned the preachers of Torgau who were imprisoned in Wittenberg on account of their opposition to the Interim. He was even accused of accepting bribes from Maurice.

In 1552, Count Hans Georg, who favored the Interim, appointed him superintendent of Eisleben, on the recommendation of Melchior Kling. The orthodox clergy of the County of Mansfeld, however, immediately suspected him of being an interimist and adiaphorist, and he tried to defend his position in public, but his apology resulted in a dispute called the Majoristic Controversy.

At Christmas, 1552, Count Albrecht expelled him without trial and he fled to Wittenberg, where he resumed his activity as professor and member of the Wittenberg Consistory. Thence forth he was an important and active member in the circle of the Wittenberg Philippists.

From 1558 to 1574 he was dean of the theological faculty and repeatedly held the rectorate of the university. He lived long enough to experience the first overthrow of Crypto-Calvinism in the Electorate of Saxony, and Paul Crell, his son-in-law, signed for him at Torgau in May 1574 the articles which repudiated Calvinism and acknowledged the unity of Luther and Melanchthon.

He died at Wittenberg in 1574.

==Works==
His significant writings include:

* A text edition of &quot;Justini ex Trogo Pompejo historia&quot; (Hagenau, 1526);
* an edition of Luther&#x27;s smaller catechism in Latin and Low German (Magdeburg, 1531);
* &quot;Sententiae veterum poetarum&quot; (1534);
* &quot;Quaestiones rhetoricae&quot; (1535);
* &quot;Vita Patrum&quot; (Wittenberg, 1544);
* &quot;Psalterium Davidis juxta translationem veterem repurgatum&quot; (1547);
* &quot;De origine et auctoritate verbi Dei&quot; (1550);
* &quot;Commonefactio ad ecclesiam catholicam, orthodoxam, de fugiendis ... blasphemiis Samosatenicis&quot; (1569).

He also wrote commentaries on the Pauline epistles and homilies on the pericopes.

<text>Chennai (; , ISO: ), formerly known as Madras, is the capital and largest city of Tamil Nadu, the southernmost state of India. It is located on the Coromandel Coast of the Bay of Bengal. According to the 2011 Indian census, Chennai is the sixth-most-populous city in India and forms the fourth-most-populous urban agglomeration. Incorporated in 1688, the Greater Chennai Corporation is the oldest municipal corporation in India and the second oldest in the world after London.

Historically, the region was part of the Chola, Pandya, Pallava and Vijayanagara kingdoms during various eras. The coastal land which then contained the fishing village Madrasapattinam, was purchased by the British East India Company from the Nayak ruler Chennapa Nayaka in the 17th century. The British garrison established the Madras city and port and built Fort St. George, the first British fortress in India. The city was made the winter capital of the Madras Presidency, a colonial province of the British Raj in the Indian subcontinent. After India gained independence in 1947, Madras continued as the capital city of the Madras State and present-day Tamil Nadu. The city was officially renamed as Chennai in 1996.

The city is coterminous with Chennai district, which together with the adjoining suburbs constitutes the Chennai Metropolitan Area, the 35th-largest urban area in the world by population and one of the largest metropolitan economies of India. Chennai has the fifth-largest urban economy and the third-largest expatriate population in India. Known as the gateway to South India, Chennai is amongst the most-visited Indian cities by international tourists and was ranked 36th among the most-visited cities in the world in 2019 by Euromonitor. Ranked as a beta-level city in the Global Cities Index, it was ranked as the second most safest city in India by National Crime Records Bureau in 2023.

Chennai is a major centre for medical tourism and is termed &quot;India&#x27;s health capital&quot;. Chennai houses a major portion of India&#x27;s automobile industry, hence the name &quot;Detroit of India&quot;. It was the only South Asian city to be ranked among National Geographic&#x27;s &quot;Top 10 food cities&quot; in 2015 and ranked ninth on Lonely Planet&#x27;s best cosmopolitan cities in the world. In October 2017, Chennai was added to the UNESCO Creative Cities Network (UCCN) list. It is a major film production centre and home to the Tamil-language film industry.

== Etymology ==

The name &quot;Chennai&quot; was derived from the name of Chennappa Nayaka, a Nayak ruler who served as a general under Venkata Raya of the Vijayanagara Empire from whom the British East India Company acquired the town in 1639. The first official use of the name was in August 1639 in a sale deed to Francis Day of the East India Company. A land grant was given to the Chennakesava Perumal Temple in Chennapatanam later in 1646, which some scholars argue to be the first use of the name.

The name &quot;Madras&quot; is of native origin, and has been shown to have been in use before the British established a presence in India. A Vijayanagara-era inscription found in 2015 was dated to the year 1367 and mentions the port of Mādarasanpattanam, along with other small ports on the east coast, and it was theorized that the aforementioned port is the fishing port of Royapuram. &quot;Madras&quot; might have been derived from Madraspattinam, a fishing village north of Fort St. George but it is uncertain whether the name was in use before the arrival of Europeans.

In July 1996, the Government of Tamil Nadu officially changed the name from Madras to Chennai. The name &quot;Madras&quot; continues to be used occasionally for the city as well as for places or things named after the city in the past.

==History==
Stone Age implements have been found near Pallavaram in Chennai and according to the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), Pallavaram was a megalithic cultural establishment, and pre-historic communities resided in the settlement. The region around Chennai was an important administrative, military, and economic centre for many centuries. During the 1st century CE, Tamil poet named Thiruvalluvar lived in the town of Mylapore, a neighbourhood of present-day Chennai. The region was part of Tondaimandalam which was ruled by the Early Cholas in the 2nd century CE by subduing Kurumbas, the original inhabitants of the region. Pallavas of Kanchi became independent rulers of the region from 3rd to 9th century CE and the areas of Mahabalipuram and Pallavaram were built during the reign of Mahendravarman I. In 879, Pallavas were defeated by the Later Cholas led by Aditya I and Jatavarman Sundara Pandyan later brought the region under the Pandya rule in 1264. The region came under the influence of Vijayanagara Empire in the 15th century CE.

The Portuguese arrived in 1522 and built a port named São Tomé after the Christian apostle, St. Thomas, who is believed to have preached in the area between 52 and 70 CE. In 1612, the Dutch established themselves near Pulicat, north of Chennai. On 20 August 1639, Francis Day of the British East India Company along with the Nayak of Kalahasti Chennappa Nayaka met with the Vijayanager Emperor Peda Venkata Raya at Chandragiri and obtained a grant for land on the Coromandel coast on which the company could build a factory and warehouse for their trading activities. On 22 August, he secured the grant for a strip of land about long and inland in return for a yearly sum of five hundred lakh pagodas. The region was then formerly a fishing village known as &quot;Madraspatnam&quot;. A year later, the company built Fort St. George, the first major English settlement in India, which became the nucleus of the growing colonial city and urban Chennai.

In 1746, Fort St. George and the town were captured by the French under General La Bourdonnais, the Governor of Mauritius, who plundered the town and its outlying villages. The British regained control in 1749 through the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle and strengthened the town&#x27;s fortress wall to withstand further attacks from the French and Hyder Ali, the king of Mysore. They resisted a French siege attempt in 1759. In 1769, the city was threatened by Hyder Ali during the First Anglo-Mysore War with the Treaty of Madras ending the conflict. By the 18th century, the British had conquered most of the region and established the Madras Presidency with Madras as the capital.

The city became a major naval base and became the central administrative centre for the British in South India. The city was the baseline for the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India, which was started on 10 April 1802. With the advent of railways in India in the 19th century, the city was connected to other major cities such as Bombay and Calcutta, promoting increased communication and trade with the hinterland.

After India gained its independence in 1947, the city became the capital of Madras State, the predecessor of the current state of Tamil Nadu. The city was the location of the hunger strike and death of Potti Sreeramulu which resulted in the formation of Andhra State in 1953 and eventually the re-organization of Indian states based on linguistic boundaries in 1956.

In 1965, agitations against the imposition of Hindi and in support of continuing English as a medium of communication arose which marked a major shift in the political dynamics of the city and eventually led to English being retained as an official language of India alongside Hindi. On 17 July 1996, the city was officially renamed from Madras to Chennai, in line with then a nationwide trend to using less Anglicised names. On 26 December 2004, a tsunami lashed the shores of Chennai, killing 206 people in Chennai and permanently altering the coastline. The 2015 Chennai Floods submerged major portions of the city, killing 269 people and resulting in damages of .

== Environment ==
=== Geography ===


Chennai is located on the southeastern coast of India in the northeastern part of Tamil Nadu on a flat coastal plain known as the Eastern Coastal Plains with an average elevation of and highest point at . Chennai&#x27;s soil is mostly clay, shale and sandstone. Clay underlies most of the city with sandy areas found along the river banks and coasts where rainwater runoff percolates quickly through the soil. Certain areas in South Chennai have a hard rock surface. As of 2018, the city had a green cover of 14.9 per cent, with a per capita green cover of 8.5 square metres against the World Health Organization recommendation of nine square metres.

, water bodies cover an estimated area of the city. Two major rivers flow through Chennai, the Cooum River (or &quot;Koovam&quot;) through the centre and the Adyar River to the south. A section of the Buckingham Canal built in 1877-78, runs parallel to the Bay of Bengal coast, linking the two rivers. Kosasthalaiyar River traverses through the northern fringes of the city before draining into the Bay of Bengal, at Ennore Creek. The Otteri Nullah, an east–west stream, runs through north Chennai and meets the Buckingham Canal at Basin Bridge. The groundwater table in Chennai is at below ground level on average and is replenished mainly by rainwater. Of the coastline of the city, experiences erosion, with sand accretion along the shoreline at the Marina beach and the area between the Ennore Port and Kosasthalaiyar river.

=== Geology ===
Chennai is situated in Seismic Zone III, indicating a moderate risk of damage from earthquakes. Owing to the tectonic zone the city falls in, the city is considered a potential geothermal energy site. The crust has old granite rocks dating back nearly a billion years indicating volcanic activities in the past with expected temperatures of at depth.

=== Climate ===
Under the Köppen climate classification, Chennai has the dry-summer version of a tropical savanna climate (&quot;As&quot;), closely bordering the dry-winter version (&quot;Aw&quot;) due to a February average rainfall of . The city lies on the thermal equator and as it is also located on the coast, there is no extreme variation in seasonal temperature. The hottest time of the year is from April to June with an average temperature of . The highest recorded temperature was on 31 May 2003. The coldest time of the year is in DecemberJanuary, with average temperature of and the lowest recorded temperature of on 11 December 1895 and 29 January 1905.

Chennai receives most of its rainfall from the northeast monsoon between October and December while smaller amounts of rain also come from the southwest monsoon between June and September. The dry season is between January and May, with March having the least average rainfall at . The average annual rainfall is about . The highest annual rainfall recorded was in 2005. Prevailing winds in Chennai are usually southwesterly between April and October and northeasterly during the rest of the year. The city relies on the annual monsoon rains to replenish water reservoirs. Cyclones and depressions are common features during the season. Water inundation and flooding happen in low-lying areas during the season with significant flooding in 2015 and 2023.

=== Flora and fauna ===


A protected estuary on the Adyar River forms a natural habitat for several species of birds and animals. Chennai is also a popular city for birding with more than 130 recorded species of birds have been recorded in the city. Marshy wetlands such as Pallikaranai and inland lakes also host a number of migratory birds during the monsoon and winter. The southern stretch of Chennai&#x27;s coast from Tiruvanmiyur to Neelangarai are favoured by the endangered olive ridley sea turtles to lay eggs every winter. Guindy National Park is a protected area within the city limits and wildlife conservation and research activities take place at Arignar Anna Zoological Park. Madras Crocodile Bank Trust is a herpetology research station, located south of Chennai. The city&#x27;s tree cover is estimated to be around with 121 recorded species belonging to 94 genera and 42 families. Major species include Copper pod, Indian beech, Gulmohar, Raintree, Neem, and Tropical Almond.

<doc id="45144" wikidata="Q1970098" url="?curid=45144" title="Shavian alphabet">
<text>The Shavian alphabet ( ; also known as the Shaw alphabet) is a constructed alphabet conceived as a way to provide simple, phonemic orthography for the English language to replace the inefficiencies and difficulties of conventional spelling using the Latin alphabet. It was posthumously funded by and named after Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw and designed by Ronald Kingsley Read. 

Shaw set three main criteria for the new alphabet. It should be: 
# at least 40 letters;
# as phonetic as possible (that is, letters should have a 1:1 correspondence to phonemes);
# distinct from the Latin alphabet to avoid the impression that the new spellings were simply misspellings.

== Letters ==
The Shavian alphabet consists of three types of letters: tall (with an ascender), deep (with a descender) and short. All vowels but the consonant–vowel ligature &quot;yew&quot; are short. Among consonants, the short letters are liquids (r, l) and nasals (m, n); these, the semivowels (y, w) and the heng letters (h, ng) are derived from each other through rotation or reflection. Tall letters are voiceless consonants, excepting Yea and Hung . A tall letter rotated 180°, with the tall part now extending below the baseline, becomes a deep letter, representing the corresponding voiced consonants (except Haha ). These rotation pairs, with the exception of the &quot;heng&quot; consonants, are the same letters that are paired in Pitman shorthand. Affricates, several diphthongs, and rhotic vowels are ligatures. The alphabet is therefore to some extent featural.

There are no separate uppercase or lowercase letters as in the Latin script; instead of using capitalization to mark proper nouns, a &quot;namer-dot&quot; (·) is placed before a name. Sentences are typically not started with a namer-dot, unless it is otherwise called for. All other punctuation and word spacing is similar to conventional orthography.

Each character in the Shavian alphabet requires only a single stroke to be written on paper. The writing utensil needs to be lifted up only once when writing each character, thus enabling faster overall writing than Latin script.

Spelling in &quot;Androcles&quot; follows the phonemic distinctions of Received Pronunciation except for explicitly indicating vocalic &quot;r&quot; with the above ligatures. Most dialectal variations of English pronunciation can be regularly produced from this spelling, but those who do not make certain distinctions, particularly in the vowels, find it difficult to produce the canonical spellings spontaneously. For instance, most North American dialects merge and (the father–bother merger), though standard English orthography is a guide.

There is no ability to indicate word stress; however, in most cases the reduction of unstressed vowels is sufficient to distinguish word pairs that are distinguished only by stress in spoken discourse. For instance, the noun &quot;convict&quot; and the verb &quot;convict&quot; can be spelled &quot;ˈkɒnvɪkt&quot; and &quot;kənvɪkt&quot;, respectively.

Additionally, five common words are abbreviated as single letters. The words the&quot; (), &quot;of (), &quot;and&quot; (), to&quot; (), and often for&quot; () are written with the single letters indicated.

== History ==
George Bernard Shaw, the writer, critic and playwright, was a vocal critic of English spelling because it often deviates from the alphabetic principle. Shaw had served from 1926 to 1939 on the BBC&#x27;s Advisory Committee on Spoken English, which included several exponents of phonetic writing. He also knew Henry Sweet, creator of Current Shorthand (and a prototype for the character of Henry Higgins), although Shaw himself for years wrote his literary works in Pitman shorthand. However, he found its limitations frustrating as well and realized that it was not a suitable replacement for traditional orthography, making the production of printed material difficult and impossible to type. Shaw desired and advocated a phonetic spelling reform, and this called for a new alphabet.

All of his interest in spelling and alphabet reform was made clear in Shaw&#x27;s will of June 1950, in which provision was made for (Isaac) James Pitman, with a grant in aid from the Public Trustee, to establish a Shaw Alphabet. Following Shaw&#x27;s death in November 1950, and after some legal dispute, the Trustee announced a worldwide competition to design such an alphabet, with the aim of producing a system that would be an economical way of writing and of printing the English language. a contest for the design of the new alphabet was won by four people, including Ronald Kingsley Read who had corresponded extensively with Shaw for several years regarding such an alphabet. Read was then appointed to amalgamate the four designs to produce the new alphabet.

Due to the contestation of Shaw&#x27;s will, the trust charged with developing the new alphabet could afford to publish only one book: a version of Shaw&#x27;s play &quot;Androcles and the Lion&quot;, in a bi-alphabetic edition with both conventional and Shavian spellings. (1962 Penguin Books, London). Copies were sent to major libraries in English-speaking countries.

== Other print literature ==
Between 1963 and 1965, 8 issues of the journal, &quot;Shaw-script&quot;, were published by Read in Worcester, U.K. The journal used Shaw&#x27;s Alphabet, and much of the content was submitted by Shaw enthusiasts. In more recent years, there have been several published works of classical literature transliterated into Shavian.

The first, released in 2012, was the works of Edgar Allan Poe entitled &quot;Poe Meets Shaw: The Shaw Alphabet Edition of Edgar Allan Poe&quot;, by Tim Browne. This book was published via Shaw Alphabet Books and had two editions in its original release. One, like &quot;Androcles and the Lion&quot;, had Shavian side-by-side with the Latin equivalent and the other was a Shavian-only edition.

The second, released in 2013, was an edition of &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, transcribed into Shavian by Thomas Thurman. This was published as a Shaw-only edition with no side-by-side Latin equivalent. The Shavian fonts were designed by Michael Everson.

In 2019, a print version of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; was published in Shaw-only form by the website Shavian.info. 

== Disagreement ==

Some disagreement has arisen among the Shavian community in regard to sound–symbol assignments, which have been the topic of frequent arguments. Primarily, this has concerned the alleged reversal of two pairs of letters.

=== Haha–Hung reversal ===
The most frequent disagreement of the letter reversals has been over the Haha–Hung pair. The most convincing evidence suggesting this reversal is in the names of the letters: the unvoiced letter Haha is deep, while the voiced Hung, which suggests a lower position, is tall. This is often assumed to be a clerical error introduced in the rushed printing of the Shavian edition of &quot;Androcles and the Lion&quot;. This reversal obscures the system of tall letters as voiceless consonants and deep letters as voiced consonants.

Proponents of traditional Shavian, however, have suggested that Kingsley Read may not have intended for this system to be all-encompassing, though it seems that vertical placement alone served this purpose in an earlier version of Shavian, before the rotations were introduced. Also, Read may have intentionally reversed these letters, perhaps to emphasize that these letters represent unrelated sounds, which happen to occur in complementary distribution.

Both sides of the debate have suggested other reasons, including associations with various styles of Latin letters (namely, the in , often written with a bottom-loop in script) and the effect of letter-height on the coastlines of words, but whether Read considered any of these is uncertain. Since the letter representing the same sound in Read&#x27;s Quikscript appears identical to &quot;Hung&quot;, it is doubtful that Read reversed the letter twice by mistake. Either he always intended that letter shape or he thought it best to leave things as they were, especially as a corrected in hasty or careless writing might be confused with Hung &quot;𐑣&quot;.

=== Air–Err reversal ===
Two other letters that are often alleged to have been reversed—intentionally or not—are the ligatures Air &quot;𐑺&quot; and Err &quot;𐑻&quot;. They are both made up of Roar &quot;𐑮&quot; and an unknown first part. Attempts to construct derivations of the ligatures suggest that the pronunciations and the shapes are reversed, and may assure a less conservative pronunciation of Air &quot;𐑩&quot;, though this is not necessary.

Though the shape of Air &quot;𐑺&quot; suggests a derivation from Ado &quot;𐑩&quot; + Ado &quot;𐑩&quot; + Roar &quot;𐑮&quot; (which would give ), its name suggests a derivation either from Egg &quot;𐑧&quot; + Ado &quot;𐑩&quot; + Roar &quot;𐑮&quot; (reflecting the conservative pronunciation ) or from Egg &quot;𐑧&quot; + Egg &quot;𐑧&quot; + Roar &quot;𐑮&quot; (reflecting the contemporary pronunciation ).

In contrast, the name of Err &quot;𐑻&quot; suggests a derivation from Ado &quot;𐑩&quot; + Ado &quot;𐑩&quot; + Roar &quot;𐑮&quot; (which would suggest &quot;𐑺&quot;), both because the closest short approximation of the conservative pronunciation is and because the contemporary pronunciation is . Its shape suggests a derivation either from Egg &quot;𐑧&quot; + Ado &quot;𐑩&quot; + Roar &quot;𐑮&quot; (reflecting the conservative pronunciation ) or from Egg &quot;𐑧&quot; + Egg &quot;𐑧&quot; + Roar &quot;𐑮&quot; (which would give ).

Read, being a likely RP speaker born in 1887, would almost certainly not have had the contemporary pronunciation of Air, so that is unlikely to be relevant. It is possible that he approximated Err as (which would not contradict with his for Air) and flipped the initial stroke of Air from something like &quot;𐑸&quot; to &quot;𐑺&quot; so as to avoid confusion with Are &quot;𐑸&quot;, or that the hypothesised derivations of the ligatures are incorrect and bear no relation to pronunciation.

== Variants ==
=== Quikscript ===
Some years after the initial publication of the Shaw alphabet, Read expanded it to create Quikscript, also known as the Read Alphabet. Quikscript is intended to be more useful for handwriting, and to that end is more cursive and uses more ligatures. Many letter forms are roughly the same in both alphabets; see the separate article for more details.

=== Shavian in Esperanto (Ŝava alfabeto) ===

An adaptation of Shavian to another language, Esperanto, was developed by John Wesley Starling; though not widely used, at least one booklet has been published with transliterated sample texts. As that language is already spelled phonemically, direct conversion between Latin and Shavian letters can be performed, though several ligatures are added for the common combinations of vowels with &quot;n&quot; and &quot;s&quot; and some common short words. Vowels use the letters of the orthographically equivalent short vowels in English (i.e. &quot;ă ĕ ĭ ŏ ŭ&quot;), except that &quot;o&quot; and &quot;u&quot; are reversed, as are &quot;j&quot; and &quot;w&quot;. The &quot;oo&quot;-vowel letters are reassigned to &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot;, and the unneeded letters for &quot;th&quot; and &quot;ng&quot; are assigned to &quot;c&quot; and &quot;ĥ&quot;.

Pronunciations that differ from their English values are marked in bold blue.

=== Shaw Alphabet ===
In 1996, Paul Vandenbrink devised the self-styled Shaw Alphabet, or the Revised Shaw Abjad, which was further revised in 2001. It is based on the Hebrew script and makes many changes to the shapes and names of the letters, though it is largely unknown.

== Unicode ==
Shavian was added to the Unicode Standard in April 2003 with the release of version 4.0. Esperanto ligatures are not supported. 

=== Block ===
The Unicode block for Shavian is U+10450–U+1047F and is in Plane 1 (the Supplementary Multilingual Plane).

=== Fonts ===
While the Shavian alphabet was added to Unicode 4.0 in 2003, Unicode Shavian fonts are still quite rare. Before it was standardized, fonts were made that include Shavian letters in the places of Roman letters, and/or in an agreed-upon location in the Unicode private use area, allocated from the ConScript Unicode Registry and now superseded by the official Unicode standard.

<doc id="45145" wikidata="Q208620" url="?curid=45145" title="Hubble sequence">
<text>The Hubble sequence is a morphological classification scheme for galaxies published by Edwin Hubble in 1926. It is often colloquially known as the Hubble tuning-fork diagram because the shape in which it is traditionally represented resembles a tuning fork.
It was invented by John Henry Reynolds and Sir James Jeans.

The tuning fork scheme divided regular galaxies into three broad classes – ellipticals, lenticulars and spirals – based on their visual appearance (originally on photographic plates). A fourth class contains galaxies with an irregular appearance. The Hubble sequence is the most commonly used system for classifying galaxies, both in professional astronomical research and in amateur astronomy.

==Classes of galaxies==

===Ellipticals===

On the left (in the sense that the sequence is usually drawn) lie the ellipticals. Elliptical galaxies have relatively smooth, featureless light distributions and appear as ellipses in photographic images. They are denoted by the letter E, followed by an integer representing their degree of ellipticity in the sky. By convention, is ten times the ellipticity of the galaxy, rounded to the nearest integer, where the ellipticity is defined as for an ellipse with the semi-major axis length and the semi-minor axis length. The ellipticity increases from left to right on the Hubble diagram, with near-circular (E0) galaxies situated on the very left of the diagram. It is important to note that the ellipticity of a galaxy on the sky is only indirectly related to the true 3-dimensional shape (for example, a flattened, discus-shaped galaxy can appear almost round if viewed face-on or highly elliptical if viewed edge-on). Observationally, the most flattened &quot;elliptical&quot; galaxies have ellipticities (denoted E7). However, from studying the light profiles and the ellipticity profiles, rather than just looking at the images, it was realised in the 1960s that the E5–E7 galaxies are probably misclassified lenticular galaxies with large-scale disks seen at various inclinations to our line-of-sight. Observations of the kinematics of early-type galaxies further confirmed this.

Examples of elliptical galaxies: M49, M59, M60, M87, NGC 4125.

===Lenticulars===
At the centre of the Hubble tuning fork, where the two spiral-galaxy branches and the elliptical branch join, lies an intermediate class of galaxies known as lenticulars and given the symbol S0. These galaxies consist of a bright central bulge, similar in appearance to an elliptical galaxy, surrounded by an extended, disk-like structure. Unlike spiral galaxies, the disks of lenticular galaxies have no visible spiral structure and are not actively forming stars in any significant quantity.

When simply looking at a galaxy&#x27;s image, lenticular galaxies with relatively face-on disks are difficult to distinguish from ellipticals of type E0–E3, making the classification of many such galaxies uncertain. When viewed edge-on, the disk becomes more apparent and prominent dust-lanes are sometimes visible in absorption at optical wavelengths.

At the time of the initial publication of Hubble&#x27;s galaxy classification scheme, the existence of lenticular galaxies was purely hypothetical. Hubble believed that they were necessary as an intermediate stage between the highly flattened &quot;ellipticals&quot; and spirals. Later observations (by Hubble himself, among others) showed Hubble&#x27;s belief to be correct and the S0 class was included in the definitive exposition of the Hubble sequence by Allan Sandage. Missing from the Hubble sequence are the early-type galaxies with intermediate-scale disks, in between the E0 and S0 types, Martha Liller denoted them ES galaxies in 1966.

Lenticular and spiral galaxies, taken together, are often referred to as disk galaxies. The bulge-to-disk flux ratio in lenticular galaxies can take on a range of values, just as it does for each of the spiral galaxy morphological types (Sa, Sb, etc.).

Examples of lenticular galaxies: M85, M86, NGC 1316, NGC 2787, NGC 5866, Centaurus A.

===Spirals===

On the right of the Hubble sequence diagram are two parallel branches encompassing the spiral galaxies. A spiral galaxy consists of a flattened disk, with stars forming a (usually two-armed) spiral structure, and a central concentration of stars known as the bulge. Roughly half of all spirals are also observed to have a bar-like structure, with the bar extending from the central bulge, and the arms begin at the ends of the bar. In the tuning-fork diagram, the regular spirals occupy the upper branch and are denoted by the letter S, while the lower branch contains the barred spirals, given the symbol SB. Both type of spirals are further subdivided according to the detailed appearance of their spiral structures. Membership of one of these subdivisions is indicated by adding a lower-case letter to the morphological type, as follows:
* Sa (SBa) – tightly wound, smooth arms; large, bright central bulge
* Sb (SBb) – less tightly wound spiral arms than Sa (SBa); somewhat fainter bulge
* Sc (SBc) – loosely wound spiral arms, clearly resolved into individual stellar clusters and nebulae; smaller, fainter bulge

Hubble originally described three classes of spiral galaxy. This was extended by Gérard de Vaucouleurs to include a fourth class:
* Sd (SBd) – very loosely wound, fragmentary arms; most of the luminosity is in the arms and not the bulge

Although strictly part of the de Vaucouleurs system of classification, the Sd class is often included in the Hubble sequence. The basic spiral types can be extended to enable finer distinctions of appearance. For example, spiral galaxies whose appearance is intermediate between two of the above classes are often identified by appending two lower-case letters to the main galaxy type (for example, Sbc for a galaxy that is intermediate between an Sb and an Sc).

Our own Milky Way is generally classed as Sc or SBc, making it a barred spiral with well-defined arms.

Examples of regular spiral galaxies: (visually) M31 (Andromeda Galaxy), M74, M81, M104 (Sombrero Galaxy), M51a (Whirlpool Galaxy), NGC 300, NGC 772.

Examples of barred spiral galaxies: M91, M95, NGC 1097, NGC 1300, NGC1672, NGC 2536, NGC 2903.

===Irregulars===
Galaxies that do not fit into the Hubble sequence, because they have no regular structure (either disk-like or ellipsoidal), are termed irregular galaxies. Hubble defined two classes of irregular galaxy:
* Irr I galaxies have asymmetric profiles and lack a central bulge or obvious spiral structure; instead they contain many individual clusters of young stars
* Irr II galaxies have smoother, asymmetric appearances and are not clearly resolved into individual stars or stellar clusters
In his extension to the Hubble sequence, de Vaucouleurs called the Irr I galaxies &#x27;Magellanic irregulars&#x27;, after the Magellanic Clouds – two satellites of the Milky Way which Hubble classified as Irr I. The discovery of a faint spiral structure in the Large Magellanic Cloud led de Vaucouleurs to further divide the irregular galaxies into those that, like the LMC, show some evidence for spiral structure (these are given the symbol Sm) and those that have no obvious structure, such as the Small Magellanic Cloud (denoted Im). In the extended Hubble sequence, the Magellanic irregulars are usually placed at the end of the spiral branch of the Hubble tuning fork.

Examples of irregular galaxies: M82, NGC 1427A, Large Magellanic Cloud, Small Magellanic Cloud.

==Physical significance==

Elliptical and lenticular galaxies are commonly referred to together as &quot;early-type&quot; galaxies, while spirals and irregular galaxies are referred to as &quot;late types&quot;. This nomenclature is the source of the common, but erroneous, belief that the Hubble sequence was intended to reflect a supposed evolutionary sequence, from elliptical galaxies through lenticulars to either barred or regular spirals. In fact, Hubble was clear from the beginning that no such interpretation was implied:

The nomenclature, it is emphasized, refers to position in the sequence, and temporal connotations are made at one&#x27;s peril. The entire classification is purely empirical and without prejudice to theories of evolution...

The evolutionary picture appears to be lent weight by the fact that the disks of spiral galaxies are observed to be home to many young stars and regions of active star formation, while elliptical galaxies are composed of predominantly old stellar populations. In fact, current evidence suggests the opposite: the early Universe appears to be dominated by spiral and irregular galaxies. In the currently favored picture of galaxy formation, present-day ellipticals formed as a result of mergers between these earlier building blocks; while some lenticular galaxies may have formed this way, others may have accreted their disks around pre-existing spheroids. Some lenticular galaxies may also be evolved spiral galaxies, whose gas has been stripped away leaving no fuel for continued star formation, although the galaxy LEDA 2108986 opens the debate on this.

==Shortcomings==

A common criticism of the Hubble scheme is that the criteria for assigning galaxies to classes are subjective, leading to different observers assigning galaxies to different classes (although experienced observers usually agree to within less than a single Hubble type). Although not really a shortcoming, since the 1961 &quot;Hubble Atlas of Galaxies&quot;, the primary criteria used to assign the morphological type (a, b, c, etc.) has been the nature of the spiral arms, rather than the bulge-to-disk flux ratio, and thus a range of flux ratios exist for each morphological type, as with the lenticular galaxies.

Another criticism of the Hubble classification scheme is that, being based on the appearance of a galaxy in a two-dimensional image, the classes are only indirectly related to the true physical properties of galaxies. In particular, problems arise because of orientation effects. The same galaxy would look very different, if viewed edge-on, as opposed to a face-on or &#x27;broadside&#x27; viewpoint. As such, the early-type sequence is poorly represented: The ES galaxies are missing from the Hubble sequence, and the E5–E7 galaxies are actually S0 galaxies. Furthermore, the barred ES and barred S0 galaxies are also absent.
Visual classifications are also less reliable for faint or distant galaxies, and the appearance of galaxies can change depending on the wavelength of light in which they are observed.

Nonetheless, the Hubble sequence is still commonly used in the field of extragalactic astronomy and Hubble types are known to correlate with many physically relevant properties of galaxies, such as luminosities, colours, masses (of stars and gas) and star formation rates.

In June 2019, citizen scientists in the Galaxy Zoo project argued that the usual Hubble classification, particularly concerning spiral galaxies, may not be supported by evidence. Consequently, the scheme may need revision.

<text>CP/M, originally standing for Control Program/Monitor and later Control Program for Microcomputers, is a mass-market operating system created in 1974 for Intel 8080/85-based microcomputers by Gary Kildall of Digital Research, Inc. CP/M is a disk operating system and its purpose is to organize files on a magnetic storage medium, and to load and run programs stored on a disk. Initially confined to single-tasking on 8-bit processors and no more than 64 kilobytes of memory, later versions of CP/M added multi-user variations and were migrated to 16-bit processors.

CP/M eventually became the &quot;de facto&quot; standard and the dominant operating system for microcomputers, in combination with the S-100 bus computers. This computer platform was widely used in business through the late 1970s and into the mid-1980s. CP/M increased the market size for both hardware and software by greatly reducing the amount of programming required to port an application to a new manufacturer&#x27;s computer. An important driver of software innovation was the advent of (comparatively) low-cost microcomputers running CP/M, as independent programmers and hackers bought them and shared their creations in user groups. CP/M was eventually displaced in popularity by DOS following the 1981 introduction of the IBM PC.

== History ==
=== Early history ===

Gary Kildall originally developed CP/M during 1974, as an operating system to run on an Intel Intellec-8 development system, equipped with a Shugart Associates 8-inch floppy-disk drive interfaced via a custom floppy-disk controller. It was written in Kildall&#x27;s own PL/M (&quot;Programming Language for Microcomputers&quot;). Various aspects of CP/M were influenced by the TOPS-10 operating system of the DECsystem-10 mainframe computer, which Kildall had used as a development environment.

CP/M supported a wide range of computers based on the 8080 and Z80 CPUs. An early outside licensee of CP/M was Gnat Computers, an early microcomputer developer out of San Diego, California. In 1977, the company was granted the license to use CP/M 1.0 for any micro they desired for $90. Within the year, demand for CP/M was so high that Digital Research was able to increase the license to tens of thousands of dollars.

Under Kildall&#x27;s direction, the development of CP/M 2.0 was mostly carried out by John Pierce in 1978. Kathryn Strutynski, a friend of Kildall from Naval Postgraduate School (NPS), became the fourth employee of Digital Research Inc. in early 1979. She started by debugging CP/M 2.0, and later became influential as key developer for CP/M 2.2 and CP/M Plus. Other early developers of the CP/M base included Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Silberstein and David &quot;Dave&quot; K. Brown.

CP/M originally stood for &quot;Control Program/Monitor&quot;, a name which implies a resident monitor—a primitive precursor to the operating system. However, during the conversion of CP/M to a commercial product, trademark registration documents filed in November 1977 gave the product&#x27;s name as &quot;Control Program for Microcomputers&quot;. The CP/M name follows a prevailing naming scheme of the time, as in Kildall&#x27;s PL/M language, and Prime Computer&#x27;s PL/P (&quot;Programming Language for Prime&quot;), both suggesting IBM&#x27;s PL/I; and IBM&#x27;s CP/CMS operating system, which Kildall had used when working at the NPS. This renaming of CP/M was part of a larger effort by Kildall and his wife with business partner, Dorothy McEwen to convert Kildall&#x27;s personal project of CP/M and the Intel-contracted PL/M compiler into a commercial enterprise. The Kildalls intended to establish the Digital Research brand and its product lines as synonymous with &quot;microcomputer&quot; in the consumer&#x27;s mind, similar to what IBM and Microsoft together later successfully accomplished in making &quot;personal computer&quot; synonymous with their product offerings. Intergalactic Digital Research, Inc. was later renamed via a corporation change-of-name filing to Digital Research, Inc.

=== Initial success ===
By September 1981, Digital Research had sold more than CP/M licenses; &quot;InfoWorld&quot; stated that the actual market was likely larger because of sublicenses. Many different companies produced CP/M-based computers for many different markets; the magazine stated that &quot;CP/M is well on its way to establishing itself as &quot;the&quot; small-computer operating system&quot;. Even companies with proprietary operating systems, such as Heath/Zenith (HDOS), offered CP/M as an alternative for their 8080/Z80-based systems; by contrast, no comparable standard existed for computers based on the also popular 6502 CPU. They supported CP/M because of its large library of software. The Xerox 820 ran the operating system because &quot;where there are literally thousands of programs written for it, it would be unwise not to take advantage of it&quot;, Xerox said. (Xerox included a Howard W. Sams CP/M manual as compensation for Digital Research&#x27;s documentation, which &quot;InfoWorld&quot; described as atrocious, incomplete, incomprehensible, and poorly indexed.) By 1984, Columbia University used the same source code to build Kermit binaries for more than a dozen different CP/M systems, plus two generic versions. The operating system was described as a &quot;software bus&quot;, allowing multiple programs to interact with different hardware in a standardized way. Programs written for CP/M were typically portable among different machines, usually requiring only the specification of the escape sequences for control of the screen and printer. This portability made CP/M popular, and much more software was written for CP/M than for operating systems that ran on only one brand of hardware. One restriction on portability was that certain programs used the extended instruction set of the Z80 processor and would not operate on an 8080 or 8085 processor. Another was graphics routines, especially in games and graphics programs, which were generally machine-specific as they used direct hardware access for speed, bypassing the OS and BIOS (this was also a common problem in early DOS machines).

Bill Gates claimed that the Apple II with a Z-80 SoftCard was the single most-popular CP/M hardware platform. Many different brands of machines ran the operating system, some notable examples being the Altair 8800, the IMSAI 8080, the Osborne 1 and Kaypro luggables, and MSX computers. The best-selling CP/M-capable system of all time was probably the Amstrad PCW. In the UK, CP/M was also available on Research Machines educational computers (with the CP/M source code published as an educational resource), and for the BBC Micro when equipped with a Z80 co-processor. Furthermore, it was available for the Amstrad CPC series, the Commodore 128, TRS-80, and later models of the ZX Spectrum. CP/M 3 was also used on the NIAT, a custom handheld computer designed for A. C. Nielsen&#x27;s internal use with 1 MB of SSD memory.

=== Multi-user ===
In 1979, a multi-user compatible derivative of CP/M was released. MP/M allowed multiple users to connect to a single computer, using multiple terminals to provide each user with a screen and keyboard. Later versions ran on 16-bit processors.

=== CP/M Plus ===

The last 8-bit version of CP/M was version 3, often called CP/M Plus, released in 1983. Its BDOS was designed by David K. Brown. It incorporated the bank switching memory management of MP/M in a single-user single-task operating system compatible with CP/M 2.2 applications. CP/M 3 could therefore use more than 64 KB of memory on an 8080 or Z80 processor. The system could be configured to support date stamping of files. The operating system distribution software also included a relocating assembler and linker. CP/M 3 was available for the last generation of 8-bit computers, notably the Amstrad PCW, the Amstrad CPC, the ZX Spectrum +3, the Commodore 128, MSX machines and the Radio Shack TRS-80 Model 4.

=== 16-bit versions ===
There were versions of CP/M for some 16-bit CPUs as well.

The first version in the 16-bit family was CP/M-86 for the Intel 8086 in November 1981. Kathryn Strutynski was the project manager for the evolving CP/M-86 line of operating systems. At this point, the original 8-bit CP/M became known by the retronym &quot;CP/M-80&quot; to avoid confusion.

CP/M-86 was expected to be the standard operating system of the new IBM PCs, but DRI and IBM were unable to negotiate development and licensing terms. IBM turned to Microsoft instead, and Microsoft delivered PC DOS based on 86-DOS. Although CP/M-86 became an option for the IBM PC after DRI threatened legal action, it never overtook Microsoft&#x27;s system. Most customers were repelled by the significantly greater price IBM charged for CP/M-86 over PC DOS ( and , respectively).

When Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) put out the Rainbow 100 to compete with IBM, it came with CP/M-80 using a Z80 chip, CP/M-86 or MS-DOS using an 8088 microprocessor, or CP/M-86/80 using both. The Z80 and 8088 CPUs ran concurrently. A benefit of the Rainbow was that it could continue to run 8-bit CP/M software, preserving a user&#x27;s possibly sizable investment as they moved into the 16-bit world of MS-DOS. A similar dual-processor adaption for the was named CP/M 8-16. The CP/M-86 adaptation for the 8085/8088-based Zenith Z-100 also supported running programs for both of its CPUs.

Soon following CP/M-86, another 16-bit version of CP/M was &quot;CP/M-68K&quot; for the Motorola 68000. The original version of CP/M-68K in 1982 was written in Pascal/MT+68k, but it was ported to C later on. CP/M-68K, already running on the Motorola EXORmacs systems, was initially to be used in the Atari ST computer, but Atari decided to go with a newer disk operating system called GEMDOS. CP/M-68K was also used on the SORD M68 and M68MX computers.

In 1982, there was also a port from CP/M-68K to the 16-bit Zilog Z8000 for the Olivetti M20, written in C, named &quot;CP/M-8000&quot;.

These 16-bit versions of CP/M required application programs to be re-compiled for the new CPUs. Some programs written in assembly language could be automatically translated for a new processor. One tool for this was Digital Research&#x27;s XLT86, which translated .ASM source code for the Intel 8080 processor into .A86 source code for the Intel 8086. The translator would also optimize the output for code size and take care of calling conventions, so that CP/M-80 and MP/M-80 programs could be ported to the CP/M-86 and MP/M-86 platforms automatically. XLT86 itself was written in PL/I-80 and was available for CP/M-80 platforms as well as for VAX/VMS.

=== Displacement by MS-DOS ===

Many expected that CP/M would be the standard operating system for 16-bit computers. In 1980 IBM approached Digital Research, at Bill Gates&#x27; suggestion, to license a forthcoming version of CP/M for its new product, the IBM Personal Computer. Upon the failure to obtain a signed non-disclosure agreement, the talks failed, and IBM instead contracted with Microsoft to provide an operating system. The resulting product, MS-DOS, soon began outselling CP/M.

Many of the basic concepts and mechanisms of early versions of MS-DOS resembled those of CP/M. Internals like file-handling data structures were identical, and both referred to disk drives with a letter (codice_1, codice_2, etc.). MS-DOS&#x27;s main innovation was its FAT file system. This similarity made it easier to port popular CP/M software like WordStar and dBase. However, CP/M&#x27;s concept of separate user areas for files on the same disk was never ported to MS-DOS. Since MS-DOS had access to more memory (as few IBM PCs were sold with less than 64 KB of memory, while CP/M could run in 16 KB if necessary), more commands were built into the command-line shell, making MS-DOS somewhat faster and easier to use on floppy-based computers.

Although one of the first peripherals for the IBM PC was a SoftCard-like expansion card that let it run 8-bit CP/M software, &quot;InfoWorld&quot; stated in 1984 that efforts to introduce CP/M to the home market had been largely unsuccessful and most CP/M software was too expensive for home users. In 1986 the magazine stated that Kaypro had stopped production of 8-bit CP/M-based models to concentrate on sales of MS-DOS compatible systems, long after most other vendors had ceased production of new equipment and software for CP/M. CP/M rapidly lost market share as the microcomputing market moved to the IBM-compatible platform, and it never regained its former popularity. &quot;Byte&quot; magazine, at the time one of the leading industry magazines for microcomputers, essentially ceased covering CP/M products within a few years of the introduction of the IBM PC. For example, in 1983 there were still a few advertisements for S-100 boards and articles on CP/M software, but by 1987 these were no longer found in the magazine.

Later versions of CP/M-86 made significant strides in performance and usability and were made compatible with MS-DOS. To reflect this compatibility the name was changed, and CP/M-86 became DOS Plus, which in turn became DR-DOS.

=== ZCPR ===

ZCPR (the Z80 Command Processor Replacement) was introduced on 2 February 1982 as a drop-in replacement for the standard Digital Research console command processor (CCP) and was initially written by a group of computer hobbyists who called themselves &quot;The CCP Group&quot;. They were Frank Wancho, Keith Petersen (the archivist behind Simtel at the time), Ron Fowler, Charlie Strom, Bob Mathias, and Richard Conn. Richard was, in fact, the driving force in this group (all of whom maintained contact through email).

ZCPR1 was released on a disk put out by SIG/M (Special Interest Group/Microcomputers), a part of the Amateur Computer Club of New Jersey.

ZCPR2 was released on 14 February 1983. It was released as a set of ten disks from SIG/M. ZCPR2 was upgraded to 2.3, and also was released in 8080 code, permitting the use of ZCPR2 on 8080 and 8085 systems.

ZCPR3 was released on 14 July 1984, as a set of nine disks from SIG/M. The code for ZCPR3 could also be compiled (with reduced features) for the 8080 and would run on systems that did not have the requisite Z80 microprocessor. Features of ZCPR as of version 3 included shells, aliases, I/O redirection, flow control, named directories, search paths, custom menus, passwords, and online help. In January 1987, Richard Conn stopped developing ZCPR, and Echelon asked Jay Sage (who already had a privately enhanced ZCPR 3.1) to continue work on it. Thus, ZCPR 3.3 was developed and released. ZCPR 3.3 no longer supported the 8080 series of microprocessors, and added the most features of any upgrade in the ZCPR line. ZCPR 3.3 also included a full complement of utilities with considerably extended capabilities. While enthusiastically supported by the CP/M user base of the time, ZCPR alone was insufficient to slow the demise of CP/M.

== Hardware model ==

A minimal 8-bit CP/M system would contain the following components:
* A computer terminal using the ASCII character set
* An Intel 8080 (and later the 8085) or Zilog Z80 microprocessor
** The NEC V20 and V30 processors support an 8080-emulation mode that can run 8-bit CP/M on a PC-DOS/MS-DOS computer so equipped, though any PC clone could run CP/M-86.
* At least 16 kilobytes of RAM, beginning at address 0
* A means to bootstrap the first sector of the diskette
* At least one floppy-disk drive

The only hardware system that CP/M, as sold by Digital Research, would support was the Intel 8080 Development System. Manufacturers of CP/M-compatible systems customized portions of the operating system for their own combination of installed memory, disk drives, and console devices. CP/M would also run on systems based on the Zilog Z80 processor since the Z80 was compatible with 8080 code. While the Digital Research distributed core of CP/M (BDOS, CCP, core transient commands) did not use any of the Z80-specific instructions, many Z80-based systems used Z80 code in the system-specific BIOS, and many applications were dedicated to Z80-based CP/M machines.

Digital Research subsequently partnered with Zilog and American Microsystems to produce Personal CP/M, a ROM-based version of the operating system aimed at lower-cost systems that could potentially be equipped without disk drives. First featured in the Sharp MZ-800, a cassette-based system with optional disk drives, Personal CP/M was described as having been &quot;rewritten to take advantage of the enhanced Z-80 instruction set&quot; as opposed to preserving portability with the 8080. American Microsystems announced a Z80-compatible microprocessor, the S83, featuring 8 KB of in-package ROM for the operating system and BIOS, together with comprehensive logic for interfacing with 64-kilobit dynamic RAM devices. Unit pricing of the S83 was quoted as $32 in 1,000 unit quantities.

On most machines the bootstrap was a minimal bootloader in ROM combined with some means of minimal bank switching or a means of injecting code on the bus (since the 8080 needs to see boot code at Address 0 for start-up, while CP/M needs RAM there); for others, this bootstrap had to be entered into memory using front-panel controls each time the system was started.

CP/M used the 7-bit ASCII set. The other 128 characters made possible by the 8-bit byte were not standardized. For example, one Kaypro used them for Greek characters, and Osborne machines used the 8th bit set to indicate an underlined character. WordStar used the 8th bit as an end-of-word marker. International CP/M systems most commonly used the ISO 646 norm for localized character sets, replacing certain ASCII characters with localized characters rather than adding them beyond the 7-bit boundary.

== Components ==
In the 8-bit versions, while running, the CP/M operating system loaded into memory has three components:

* &quot;Basic Input/Output System&quot; (BIOS),
* &quot;Basic Disk Operating System&quot; (BDOS),
* &quot;Console Command Processor&quot; (CCP).

The BIOS and BDOS are memory-resident, while the CCP is memory-resident unless overwritten by an application, in which case it is automatically reloaded after the application finished running. A number of transient commands for standard utilities are also provided. The transient commands reside in files with the extension .COM on disk.

The BIOS directly controls hardware components other than the CPU and main memory. It contains functions such as character input and output and the reading and writing of disk sectors. The BDOS implements the CP/M file system and some input/output abstractions (such as redirection) on top of the BIOS. The CCP takes user commands and either executes them directly (internal commands such as DIR to show a directory or ERA to delete a file) or loads and starts an executable file of the given name (transient commands such as PIP.COM to copy files or STAT.COM to show various file and system information). Third-party applications for CP/M are also essentially transient commands.

The BDOS, CCP and standard transient commands are the same in all installations of a particular revision of CP/M, but the BIOS portion is always adapted to the particular hardware.

Adding memory to a computer, for example, means that the CP/M system must be reinstalled to allow transient programs to use the additional memory space. A utility program (MOVCPM) is provided with system distribution that allows relocating the object code to different memory areas. The utility program adjusts the addresses in absolute jump and subroutine call instructions to new addresses required by the new location of the operating system in processor memory. This newly patched version can then be saved on a new disk, allowing application programs to access the additional memory made available by moving the system components. Once installed, the operating system (BIOS, BDOS and CCP) is stored in reserved areas at the beginning of any disk which can be used to boot the system. On start-up, the bootloader (usually contained in a ROM firmware chip) loads the operating system from the disk in drive codice_1.

By modern standards CP/M is primitive, owing to the extreme constraints on program size. With version 1.0 there is no provision for detecting a changed disk. If a user changes disks without manually rereading the disk directory the system writes on the new disk using the old disk&#x27;s directory information, ruining the data stored on the disk. From version 1.1 or 1.2 onwards, changing a disk then trying to write to it before its directory is read will cause a fatal error to be signalled. This avoids overwriting the disk but requires a reboot and loss of the data to be stored on disk.

The majority of the complexity in CP/M is isolated in the BDOS, and to a lesser extent, the CCP and transient commands. This meant that by porting the limited number of simple routines in the BIOS to a particular hardware platform, the entire OS would work. This significantly reduced the development time needed to support new machines, and was one of the main reasons for CP/M&#x27;s widespread use. Today this sort of abstraction is common to most OSs (a hardware abstraction layer), but at the time of CP/M&#x27;s birth, OSs were typically intended to run on only one machine platform, and multilayer designs were considered unnecessary.

=== Console Command Processor ===
The Console Command Processor, or CCP, accepts input from the keyboard and conveys results to the terminal. CP/M itself works with either a printing terminal or a video terminal. All CP/M commands have to be typed in on the command line. The console most often displays the codice_4 prompt, to indicate the current default disk drive. When used with a video terminal, this is usually followed by a blinking cursor supplied by the terminal. The CCP awaits input from the user. A CCP internal command, of the form drive letter followed by a colon, can be used to select the default drive. For example, typing codice_2 and pressing enter at the command prompt changes the default drive to B, and the command prompt then becomes codice_6 to indicate this change.

CP/M&#x27;s command-line interface was patterned after the operating systems from Digital Equipment, such as RT-11 for the PDP-11 and OS/8 for the PDP-8. Commands take the form of a keyword followed by a list of parameters separated by spaces or special characters. Similar to a Unix shell builtin, if an internal command is recognized, it is carried out by the CCP itself. Otherwise it attempts to find an executable file on the currently logged disk drive and (in later versions) user area, loads it, and passes it any additional parameters from the command line. These are referred to as &quot;transient&quot; programs. On completion, BDOS will reload the CCP if it has been overwritten by application programs — this allows transient programs a larger memory space.

The commands themselves can sometimes be obscure. For instance, the command to duplicate files is named codice_7 (Peripheral-Interchange-Program), the name of the old DEC utility used for that purpose. The format of parameters given to a program was not standardized, so that there is no single option character that differentiated options from file names. Different programs can and do use different characters.

The CP/M Console Command Processor includes DIR, ERA, REN, SAVE, TYPE, and USER as built-in commands. Transient commands in CP/M include ASM, DDT, DUMP, ED, LOAD, , PIP, STAT, SUBMIT, and SYSGEN.

CP/M Plus (CP/M Version 3) includes DIR (display list of files from a directory except those marked with the SYS attribute), DIRSYS / DIRS (list files marked with the SYS attribute in the directory), ERASE / ERA (delete a file), RENAME / REN (rename a file), TYPE / TYP (display contents of an ASCII character file), and USER / USE (change user number) as built-in commands: CP/M 3 allows the user to abbreviate the built-in commands. Transient commands in CP/M 3 include COPYSYS, DATE, DEVICE, DUMP, ED, GET, HELP, HEXCOM, INITDIR, LINK, MAC, PIP, PUT, RMAC, SET, SETDEF, SHOW, SID, SUBMIT, and XREF.

=== Basic Disk Operating System ===

The Basic Disk Operating System, or BDOS, provides access to such operations as opening a file, output to the console, or printing. Application programs load processor registers with a function code for the operation, and addresses for parameters or memory buffers, and call a fixed address in memory. Since the address is the same independent of the amount of memory in the system, application programs run the same way for any type or configuration of hardware.

=== Basic Input Output System ===
The Basic Input Output System or BIOS, provides the lowest level functions required by the operating system.

These include reading or writing single characters to the system console and reading or writing a sector of data from the disk. The BDOS handles some of the buffering of data from the diskette, but before CP/M 3.0 it assumes a disk sector size fixed at 128 bytes, as used on single-density 8-inch floppy disks. Since most 5.25-inch disk formats use larger sectors, the blocking and deblocking and the management of a disk buffer area is handled by model-specific code in the BIOS.

Customization is required because hardware choices are not constrained by compatibility with any one popular standard. For example, some manufacturers designed built-in integrated video display systems, while others relied on separate computer terminals. Serial ports for printers and modems can use different types of UART chips, and port addresses are not fixed. Some machines use memory-mapped I/O instead of the 8080 I/O address space. All of these variations in the hardware are concealed from other modules of the system by use of the BIOS, which uses standard entry points for the services required to run CP/M such as character I/O or accessing a disk block. Since support for serial communication to a modem is very rudimentary in the BIOS or may be absent altogether, it is common practice for CP/M programs that use modems to have a user-installed overlay containing all the code required to access a particular machine&#x27;s serial port.

== Applications ==

WordStar, one of the first widely used word processors, and dBase, an early and popular database program for microcomputers, were originally written for CP/M. Two early outliners, KAMAS (Knowledge and Mind Amplification System) and its cut-down successor Out-Think (without programming facilities and retooled for 8080/V20 compatibility) were also written for CP/M, though later rewritten for MS-DOS. Turbo Pascal, the ancestor of Borland Delphi, and Multiplan, the ancestor of Microsoft Excel, also debuted on CP/M before MS-DOS versions became available. VisiCalc, the first-ever spreadsheet program, was made available for CP/M. Another company, Sorcim, created its SuperCalc spreadsheet for CP/M, which would go on to become the market leader and de facto standard on CP/M. Supercalc would go on to be a competitor in the spreadsheet market in the MS-DOS world. AutoCAD, a CAD application from Autodesk debuted on CP/M. A host of compilers and interpreters for popular programming languages of the time (such as BASIC, Borland&#x27;s Turbo Pascal, FORTRAN and even PL/I) were available, among them several of the earliest Microsoft products.

CP/M software often came with installers that adapted it to a wide variety of computers. The source code for BASIC programs was easily accessible, and most forms of copy protection were ineffective on the operating system. A Kaypro II owner, for example, would obtain software on Xerox 820 format, then copy it to and run it from Kaypro-format disks.

The lack of standardized graphics support limited video games, but various character and text-based games were ported, such as &quot;Telengard&quot;, &quot;Gorillas&quot;, &quot;Hamurabi&quot;, &quot;Lunar Lander&quot;, along with early interactive fiction including the &quot;Zork&quot; series and &quot;Colossal Cave Adventure&quot;. Text adventure specialist Infocom was one of the few publishers to consistently release their games in CP/M format. Lifeboat Associates started collecting and distributing user-written &quot;free&quot; software. One of the first was XMODEM, which allowed reliable file transfers via modem and phone line. Another program native to CP/M was the outline processor KAMAS.

=== Transient Program Area ===

The read/write memory between address 0100 hexadecimal and the lowest address of the BDOS was the &quot;Transient Program Area&quot; (TPA) available for CP/M application programs. Although all Z80 and 8080 processors could address 64 kilobytes of memory, the amount available for application programs could vary, depending on the design of the particular computer. Some computers used large parts of the address space for such things as BIOS ROMs, or video display memory. As a result, some systems had more TPA memory available than others. Bank switching was a common technique that allowed systems to have a large TPA while switching out ROM or video memory space as needed. CP/M 3.0 allowed parts of the BDOS to be in bank-switched memory as well.

=== Debugging application ===

CP/M came with a Dynamic Debugging Tool, nicknamed DDT (after the insecticide, i.e. a bug-killer), which allowed memory and program modules to be examined and manipulated, and allowed a program to be executed one step at a time.

=== Resident programs ===

CP/M originally did not support the equivalent of terminate and stay resident (TSR) programs as under DOS. Programmers could write software that could intercept certain operating system calls and extend or alter their functionality. Using this capability, programmers developed and sold auxiliary desk accessory programs, such as SmartKey, a keyboard utility to assign any string of bytes to any key.
CP/M 3, however, added support for dynamically loadable &quot;Resident System Extensions&quot; (RSX). A so-called &quot;null command file&quot; could be used to allow CCP to load an RSX without a transient program. Similar solutions like RSMs (for &quot;Resident System Modules&quot;) were also retrofitted to CP/M 2.2 systems by third-parties.

=== Software installation ===

Although CP/M provided some hardware abstraction to standardize the interface to disk I/O or console I/O, application programs still typically required installation to make use of all the features of such equipment as printers and terminals. Often these were controlled by escape sequences which had to be altered for different devices. For example, the escape sequence to select bold face on a printer would have differed among manufacturers, and sometimes among models within a manufacturer&#x27;s range. This procedure was not defined by the operating system; a user would typically run an installation program that would either allow selection from a range of devices, or else allow feature-by-feature editing of the escape sequences required to access a function. This had to be repeated for each application program, since there was no central operating system service provided for these devices.

The initialization codes for each model of printer had to be written into the application. To use a program such as Wordstar with more than one printer (say, a fast dot-matrix printer or a slower but presentation-quality daisy wheel printer), a separate version of Wordstar had to be prepared, and one had to load the Wordstar version that corresponded to the printer selected (and exiting and reloading to change printers).

== Disk formats ==
IBM System/34 and IBM 3740&#x27;s 128 byte/sector, single-density, single-sided format is CP/M&#x27;s standard 8-inch floppy-disk format. No standard 5.25-inch CP/M disk format exists, with Kaypro, Morrow Designs, Osborne, and others each using their own. Certain formats were more popular than others. Most software was available in the Xerox 820 format, and other computers such as the Kaypro II were compatible with it, but &quot;InfoWorld&quot; estimated in September 1981 that &quot;about two dozen formats were popular enough that software creators had to consider them to reach the broadest possible market&quot;. JRT Pascal, for example, provided versions on 5.25-inch disk for North Star, Osborne, Apple, Heath/Zenith hard sector and soft sector, and Superbrain, and one 8-inch version. Ellis Computing also offered its software for both Heath formats, and 16 other 5.25-inch formats including two different TRS-80 CP/M modifications.

Various formats were used depending on the characteristics of particular systems and to some degree the choices of the designers. CP/M supported options to control the size of reserved and directory areas on the disk, and the mapping between logical disk sectors (as seen by CP/M programs) and physical sectors as allocated on the disk. There were many ways to customize these parameters for every system but once they had been set, no standardized way existed for a system to load parameters from a disk formatted on another system.

While almost every CP/M system with 8-inch drives can read the aforementioned IBM single-sided, single-density format, for other formats the degree of portability between different CP/M machines depends on the type of disk drive and controller used since many different floppy types existed in the CP/M era in both 8-inch and 5.25-inch sizes. Disks can be hard or soft sectored, single or double density, single or double sided, 35 track, 40 track, 77 track, or 80 track, and the sector layout, size and interleave can vary widely as well. Although translation programs can allow the user to read disk types from different machines, the drive type and controller are also factors. By 1982, soft-sector, single-sided, 40-track 5.25-inch disks had become the most popular format to distribute CP/M software on as they were used by the most common consumer-level machines of that time, such as the Apple II, TRS-80, Osborne 1, Kaypro II, and IBM PC. A translation program allows the user to read any disks on his machine that had a similar format; for example, the Kaypro II can read TRS-80, Osborne, IBM PC, and Epson disks. Other disk types such as 80 track or hard sectored are completely impossible to read. The first half of double-sided disks (like those of the Epson QX-10) can be read because CP/M accessed disk tracks sequentially with track 0 being the first (outermost) track of side 1 and track 79 (on a 40-track disk) being the last (innermost) track of side 2. Apple II users are unable to use anything but Apple&#x27;s GCR format and so have to obtain CP/M software on Apple format disks or else transfer it via serial link.

The fragmented CP/M market, requiring distributors either to stock multiple formats of disks or to invest in multiformat duplication equipment, compared with the more standardized IBM PC disk formats, was a contributing factor to the rapid obsolescence of CP/M after 1981.

One of the last notable CP/M-capable machines to appear was the Commodore 128 in 1985, which had a Z80 for CP/M support in addition to its native mode using a 6502-derivative CPU. Using CP/M required either a 1571 or 1581 disk drive which could read soft-sector 40-track MFM-format disks.

The first computer to use a 3.5-inch floppy drive, the Sony SMC-70, ran CP/M 2.2. The Commodore 128, Bondwell-2 laptop, Micromint/Ciarcia SB-180, MSX and TRS-80 Model 4 (running Montezuma CP/M 2.2) also supported the use of CP/M with 3.5-inch floppy disks. CP/AM, Applied Engineering&#x27;s version of CP/M for the Apple II, also supported 3.5-inch disks (as well as RAM disks on RAM cards compatible with the Apple II Memory Expansion Card). The Amstrad PCW ran CP/M using 3-inch floppy drives at first, and later switched to the 3.5 inch drives.

=== File system ===

File names were specified as a string of up to eight characters, followed by a period, followed by a file name extension of up to three characters (&quot;8.3&quot; filename format). The extension usually identified the type of the file. For example, codice_8 indicated an executable program file, and codice_9 indicated a file containing ASCII text. Characters in filenames entered at the command prompt were converted to upper case, but this was not enforced by the operating system. Programs (MBASIC is a notable example) were able to create filenames containing lower-case letters, which then could not easily be referenced at the command line.

Each disk drive was identified by a drive letter, for example, drive codice_10 and drive codice_11. To refer to a file on a specific drive, the drive letter was prefixed to the file name, separated by a colon, e.g., codice_12. With no drive letter prefixed, access was to files on the current default drive.

File size was specified as the number of 128-byte &quot;records&quot; (directly corresponding to disk sectors on 8-inch drives) occupied by a file on the disk. There was no generally supported way of specifying byte-exact file sizes. The current size of a file was maintained in the file&#x27;s File Control Block (FCB) by the operating system. Since many application programs (such as text editors) prefer to deal with files as sequences of characters rather than as sequences of records, by convention text files were terminated with a control-Z character (ASCII SUB, hexadecimal 1A). Determining the end of a text file therefore involved examining the last record of the file to locate the terminating control-Z. This also meant that inserting a control-Z character into the middle of a file usually had the effect of truncating the text contents of the file.

With the advent of larger removable and fixed disk drives, disk de-blocking formulas were employed which resulted in more disk blocks per logical file allocation block. While this allowed for larger file sizes, it also meant that the smallest file which could be allocated increased in size from 1 KB (on single-density drives) to 2 KB (on double-density drives) and so on, up to 32 KB for a file containing only a single byte. This made for inefficient use of disk space if the disk contained a large number of small files.

File modification time stamps were not supported in releases up to CP/M 2.2, but were an optional feature in MP/M and CP/M 3.0.

CP/M 2.2 had no subdirectories in the file structure, but provided 16 numbered user areas to organize files on a disk. To change user one had to simply type &quot;User X&quot; at the command prompt, X being the user number. Security was non-existent and considered unnecessary on a personal computer. The user area concept was to make the single-user version of CP/M somewhat compatible with multi-user MP/M systems. A common patch for the CP/M and derivative operating systems was to make one user area accessible to the user independent of the currently set user area. A USER command allowed the user area to be changed to any area from 0 to 15. User 0 was the default. If one changed to another user, such as USER 1, the material saved on the disk for this user would only be available to USER 1; USER 2 would not be able to see it or access it. However, files stored in the USER 0 area were accessible to all other users; their location was specified with a prefatory path, since the files of USER 0 were only visible to someone logged in as USER 0. The user area feature arguably had little utility on small floppy disks, but it was useful for organizing files on machines with hard drives. The intent of the feature was to ease use of the same computer for different tasks. For example, a secretary could do data entry, then, after switching USER areas, another employee could use the machine to do billing without their files intermixing.

== Graphics ==

Although graphics-capable S-100 systems existed from the commercialization of the S-100 bus, CP/M did not provide any standardized graphics support until 1982 with GSX (Graphics System Extension). Owing to the small amount of available memory, graphics was never a common feature associated with 8-bit CP/M operating systems. Most systems could only display rudimentary ASCII art charts and diagrams in text mode or by using a custom character set. Some computers in the Kaypro line and the TRS-80 Model 4 had video hardware supporting block graphics characters, and these were accessible to assembler programmers and BASIC programmers using the codice_13 command. The Model 4 could display 640 by 240 pixel graphics with an optional high resolution board.

== Derivatives ==

=== Official ===

Some companies made official enhancements of CP/M based on Digital Research source code.
An example is IMDOS for the IMSAI 8080 computer made by IMS Associates, Inc., a clone of the famous Altair 8800.

=== Compatible ===
Other CP/M compatible OSes were developed independently and made no use of Digital Research code. Some contemporary examples were:

* Cromemco CDOS from Cromemco
* MSX-DOS for the MSX range of computers is CP/M-compatible and can run CP/M programs.
* The Epson QX-10 shipped with a choice of CP/M or the compatible TPM-II or TPM-III.
* The British ZX Spectrum compatible SAM Coupé had an optional CP/M-2.2 compatible OS called Pro-DOS.
* The Amstrad/Schneider CPC series 6xx (disk-based) and PCW series computers were bundled with an CP/M disk pack.
* The Husky (computer) ran a ROM-based menu-driven program loader called DEMOS which could run many CP/M applications.
* ZSDOS is a replacement BDOS for CP/M-80 2.2 written by Harold F. Bower and Cameron W. Cotrill.
* CPMish is a new FOSS CP/M 2.2-compatible operating system which originally contained no DR code. It includes ZSDOS as its BDOS and ZCPR (see earlier) as the command processor. Since Bryan Sparks, the president of DR owners Lineo, granted permission in 2022 to modify and redistribute CP/M code, developer David Given is updating CPMish with some parts of the original DR CP/M.
* LokiOS is a CP/M 2.2 compatible OS. Version 0.9 was publicly released in 2023 by David Kitson as a solo-written Operating System exercise, intended for the Open Spectrum Project and includes source code for the BIOS, BDOS and Command-line interface as well as other supporting applications and drivers. The distribution also includes original DR Source code and a utility to allow users to hot-swap OS components (e.g., BDOS, CCP) on the fly.
* IS-DOS for the Enterprise computers, written by Intelligent Software.
* VT-DOS for the Videoton TV Computer, written by Intelligent Software.

=== Enhancements ===

Some CP/M compatible operating systems extended the basic functionality so far that they far exceeded the original, for example the multi-processor capable TurboDOS.

=== Eastern bloc ===

A number of CP/M-80 derivatives existed in the former Eastern Bloc under various names, including SCP (), SCP/M, CP/A, CP/J, CP/KC, CP/KSOB, CP/L, CP/Z, MICRODOS, BCU880, ZOAZ, OS/M, TOS/M, ZSDOS, M/OS, COS-PSA, DOS-PSA, CSOC, CSOS, CZ-CPM, DAC, HC and others. There were also CP/M-86 derivatives named SCP1700, CP/K and K8918-OS. They were produced by the East German VEB Robotron and others.

== Legacy ==

A number of behaviors exhibited by Microsoft Windows are a result of backward compatibility with MS-DOS, which in turn attempted some backward compatibility with CP/M. The drive letter and 8.3 filename conventions in MS-DOS (and early Windows versions) were originally adopted from CP/M. The wildcard matching characters used by Windows (? and *) are based on those of CP/M, as are the reserved filenames used to redirect output to a printer (&quot;PRN:&quot;), and the console (&quot;CON:&quot;). The drive names A and B were used to designate the two floppy disk drives that CP/M systems typically used; when hard drives appeared, they were designated C, which survived into MS-DOS as the codice_14 command prompt. The control character codice_15 marking the end of some text files can also be attributed to CP/M. Various commands in DOS were modelled after CP/M commands; some of them even carried the same name, like DIR, REN/RENAME, or TYPE (and ERA/ERASE in DR-DOS). File extensions like codice_16 or codice_17 are still used to identify file types on many operating systems.

In 1997 and 1998, Caldera released some CP/M 2.2 binaries and source code under an open source license, also allowing the redistribution and modification of further collected Digital Research files related to the CP/M and MP/M families through Tim Olmstead&#x27;s &quot;The Unofficial CP/M Web site&quot; since 1997. After Olmstead&#x27;s death on 12 September 2001, the distribution license was refreshed and expanded by Lineo, who had meanwhile become the owner of those Digital Research assets, on 19 October 2001.
In October 2014, to mark the 40th anniversary of the first presentation of CP/M, the Computer History Museum released early source code versions of CP/M.

, there are a number of active vintage, hobby and retro-computer people and groups, and some small commercial businesses, still developing and supporting computer platforms that use CP/M (mostly 2.2) as the host operating system.

<text>In computer architecture, 8-bit integers or other data units are those that are 8 bits wide (1 octet). Also, 8-bit central processing unit (CPU) and arithmetic logic unit (ALU) architectures are those that are based on registers or data buses of that size. Memory addresses (and thus address buses) for 8-bit CPUs are generally larger than 8-bit, usually 16-bit. 8-bit microcomputers are microcomputers that use 8-bit microprocessors.

The term &#x27;8-bit&#x27; is also applied to the character sets that could be used on computers with 8-bit bytes, the best known being various forms of extended ASCII, including the ISO/IEC 8859 series of national character sets especially Latin 1 for English and Western European languages.

The IBM System/360 introduced byte-addressable memory with 8-bit bytes, as opposed to bit-addressable or decimal digit-addressable or word-addressable memory, although its general-purpose registers were 32 bits wide, and addresses were contained in the lower 24 bits of those addresses. Different models of System/360 had different internal data path widths; the IBM System/360 Model 30 (1965) implemented the 32-bit System/360 architecture, but had an 8-bit native path width, and performed 32-bit arithmetic 8 bits at a time.

The first widely adopted 8-bit microprocessor was the Intel 8080, being used in many hobbyist computers of the late 1970s and early 1980s, often running the CP/M operating system; it had 8-bit data words and 16-bit addresses. The Zilog Z80 (compatible with the 8080) and the Motorola 6800 were also used in similar computers. The Z80 and the MOS Technology 6502 8-bit CPUs were widely used in home computers and second- and third-generation game consoles of the 1970s and 1980s. Many 8-bit CPUs or microcontrollers are the basis of today&#x27;s ubiquitous embedded systems.

== Historical context ==
8-bit microprocessors were the first widely used microprocessors in the computing industry, marking a major shift from mainframes and minicomputers to smaller, more affordable systems. The introduction of 8-bit processors in the 1970s enabled the production of personal computers, leading to the popularization of computing and setting the foundation for the modern computing landscape.

The 1976 Zilog Z80, one of the most popular 8-bit CPUs (though with 4-bit ALU, at least in the original), was discontinued in 2024 (its product line Z84C00), with Last Time Buy (LTB) orders by June 14, 2024.

== Details ==

An 8-bit register can store 28 different values. The range of integer values that can be stored in 8 bits depends on the integer representation used. With the two most common representations, the range is 0 through 255 for representation as an (unsigned) binary number, and −128 through 127 for representation as two&#x27;s complement.

8-bit CPUs use an 8-bit data bus and can therefore access 8 bits of data in a single machine instruction. The address bus is typically a double octet (16 bits) wide, due to practical and economical considerations. This implies a direct address space of 64 KB (65,536 bytes) on most 8-bit processors.

Most home computers from the 8-bit era fully exploited the address space, such as the BBC Micro (Model B) with 32 KB of RAM plus 32 KB of ROM. Others like the very popular Commodore 64 had full 64 KB RAM, plus 20 KB ROM, meaning with 16-bit addressing not all of the RAM could be used by default (e.g. from the included BASIC language interpreter in ROM); without exploiting bank switching, which allows for breaking the 64 KB (RAM) limit in some systems. Other computers would have as low as 1 KB (plus 4 KB ROM), such as the Sinclair ZX80 (while the later very popular ZX Spectrum had more memory), or even only 128 bytes of RAM (plus storage from a ROM cartridge), as in an early game console Atari 2600 and thus 8-bit addressing would have been enough for the RAM, if it would not have needed to cover ROM too). The Commodore 128, and other 8-bit systems, meaning still with 16-bit addressing, could use more than 64 KB, i.e. 128 KB RAM, also the BBC Master with it expandable to 512 KB of RAM.

While in general 8-bit CPUs have 16-bit addressing, in some architectures you have both, such as in the MOS Technology 6502 CPU, where the zero page is used extensively, saving one byte in the instructions accessing that page, and also having 16-bit addressing instructions that take 2 bytes for the address plus 1 for the opcode. 

Some index registers, such as the two in the 6502, are 8-bit. This limits the size of the arrays addressed using indexed addressing instructions to objects of up to 256 bytes without requiring more complicated code. Other 8-bit CPUs, such as the Motorola 6800 and Intel 8080, have 16-bit index registers.

== Notable 8-bit CPUs ==
The first commercial 8-bit processor was the Intel 8008 (1972) which was originally intended for the Datapoint 2200 intelligent terminal. Most competitors to Intel started off with such character oriented 8-bit microprocessors. Modernized variants of these 8-bit machines are still one of the most common types of processor in embedded systems.

The MOS Technology 6502, and variants of it, were used in personal computers, such as the Apple I, Apple II, Atari 8-bit computers, BBC Micro, PET, VIC-20, and in home video game consoles such as the Atari 2600 and the Nintendo Entertainment System.

== Use for training, prototyping, and general hardware education ==
8-bit processors continue to be designed for general education about computer hardware, as well as for hobbyists&#x27; interests. One such CPU was designed and implemented using 7400-series integrated circuits on a breadboard. Designing 8-bit CPU&#x27;s and their respective assemblers is a common training exercise for engineering students, engineers, and hobbyists. FPGAs are used for this purpose.

<text>Elián González Brotons (born December 6, 1993) is a Cuban engineer and politician. As a young child, he was at the center of a high-profile international custody dispute between family members and involving Cuba and the United States.

On November 21, 1999, Elián&#x27;s mother, her partner, and Elián fled Cuba by boat as part of a group of refugees attempting to reach the United States. The boat sank during the journey, and Elián&#x27;s mother, along with most of the passengers, drowned. Elián was found floating on an inner tube and rescued by two fishermen, who turned him over to the U.S. Coast Guard. Elián was taken to a hospital and treated for dehydration and minor cuts. In addition to Elián, a young couple survived and reached shore separately.

The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) granted Elián temporary permission to stay in the U.S. and placed him with his great-uncle, Lázaro González, in Miami. His great-uncle wanted Elián to remain in the country, while his father, Juan Miguel González, sought his return to Cuba. This led to a high-profile and protracted custody battle involving his father, his Miami relatives, and U.S. and Cuban officials. Elián was returned to his father&#x27;s custody after an INS raid on his Miami relatives&#x27; home on April 22, 2000. They returned to Cuba when the legal dispute concluded on June 28, 2000.

Elián González grew up in Cuba, earned an engineering degree, and worked as an industrial engineer. In 2023, he was elected to the National Assembly of People&#x27;s Power, representing Cárdenas, Cuba.

==Early life==
Elián González was born December 6, 1993, to divorced parents. Although his parents divorced in 1991 after six years of marriage, the couple would separate for good in 1996, but both remained close with their son. They split custody of Elián, who spent up to five nights a week with his father or one of his grandmothers and the rest of the time with his mother.

===Journey to Florida===

On November 21, 1999, González, his mother Elizabeth Brotons Rodríguez, and twelve others left Cuba on a small aluminum boat with a faulty engine; González&#x27;s mother and ten others died in the crossing, and their bodies were never recovered. González floated at sea on an inner tube until he was rescued by two fishermen, who handed him over to the United States Coast Guard. The two other survivors of the journey, a young couple, made it to the Florida coast separately.

González&#x27;s cousin Marisleysis said that Elián had told her that the boat&#x27;s motor broke down and they tried in vain to bail out the water with nylon bags, but a storm doomed their efforts. He told her he tried to help get the water out and his mother&#x27;s boyfriend placed him in an inner tube for safety. &quot;He said afterwards that he fell asleep and that when he woke up he never saw his mother again&quot;. He said, &quot;I think she drowned too because she didn&#x27;t know how to swim&quot;.

Nivaldo Fernández Ferrán, one of the three survivors on the boat, said &quot;Elizabeth protected her son to the end&quot;. According to Fernández Ferrán, they set out on their trip at 4 am, dragging inflated rubber floats, or inner tubes, in case they needed them. As they encountered bad weather, the boat&#x27;s engine failed and the craft began to fill with water. After it went under, the passengers clung to the inner tubes in cold water, with waves reaching heights of three to four meters (10 to 13 feet).

Afterwards, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) released González to his paternal great-uncle, Lázaro. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, González&#x27;s father, Juan Miguel González Quintana, had telephoned Lázaro from Cuba on November 22, 1999, to advise that González and his mother had left Cuba without Juan Miguel&#x27;s knowledge, and to watch for their arrival.

===Custody dispute in the United States===
The U.S. legislation system had enacted the Cuban Adjustment Act in 1966, which sought to provide political asylum for Cubans who fled their country in the hopes of a new life. Under the act, Cuban refugees without visas entering the United States were paroled, and after a year could apply for permanent resident status. The US also issued 20,000 lottery visas every year to Cuban emigrants under the wet foot, dry foot policy. Under this policy, those who reached the mainland were granted asylum, while those who were intercepted at sea by the U.S. Coast Guard were sent back to Cuba.

Lázaro González, backed by local Cuban Americans, took the position that the boy should remain in the United States and not be returned to his father. Marisleysis González (Lázaro&#x27;s adult daughter) became Elián González&#x27;s caretaker and spokesperson for the paternal relatives. Also, Armando Gutierrez, a local Cuban-American businessman, became a spokesman. At the same time, Juan Miguel, with the support of Cuban authorities, demanded that his son be returned to Cuba.

On January 21, 2000, Elián González&#x27;s grandmothers, Mariela Quintana and Raquel Rodríguez, flew from Havana to the United States to seek their grandson&#x27;s return to Cuba. While they were able to meet with the boy only once at the Miami Beach home of Barry University president Sister Jeanne O&#x27;Laughlin, they journeyed to Washington and met with congressmen and Attorney General Janet Reno. After nine days of media coverage (during which Republican lawmakers acknowledged they did not have the votes to pass a bill to give González U.S. citizenship), they returned to Cuba to &quot;a hero&#x27;s welcome&quot;.

On January 28, the Spanish foreign minister Abel Matutes called for the boy&#x27;s return to Cuba, stating that international law dictated the return. Meanwhile, the González family in Miami denied allegations that they had offered Juan Miguel a house and a car if he abandoned the action and joined his son in Miami. Juan Miguel was uninterested in emigrating.

Through January and February, Juan Miguel sent a number of open letters to the U.S. government—published in, among other places, the Cuban newspaper &quot;Granma&quot;—demanding the return of his son and refusing the Miami relatives&#x27; demands.

Chicago-based fathers&#x27; rights attorney Jeffery M. Leving spearheaded the amicus brief, which set the foundation of the custody case to reunite González with his father in Cuba. Manuel González, Elián Gonzalez&#x27;s great uncle, later retained Leving to reunite González with his father.

On March 21, Judge Kevin Michael Moore of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida dismissed the relatives&#x27; petition for asylum which they had filed on behalf of Elián González. Lázaro vowed to appeal. On March 29, Miami-Dade County mayor Alex Penelas was joined by 22 other civic leaders in a speech in downtown Miami. Penelas indicated that the municipality would not cooperate with Federal authorities on any repatriation of the boy, and would not lend police assets or any other assistance in taking the boy.

On April 14, a video was released in which Elián González told Juan Miguel that he wanted to stay in the United States. However, many thought that he had been coached, as a male voice was heard off-camera directing the young boy. In a September 2005 interview with &quot;60 Minutes&quot; after being sent back to Cuba, González stated that during his stay in the U.S., his family members were &quot;telling me bad things about [my father]&quot;, and &quot;were also telling me to tell him that I did not want to go back to Cuba, and I always told them I wanted to.&quot;

Elián González remained a subject of media attention as he went to Walt Disney World Resort one day, then met with politicians the next. Throughout the custody battle, opinion polls showed that a majority of Americans believed González should be returned to his father in Cuba, and that doing so was in the boy&#x27;s best interest.

Attorney General Janet Reno ordered the return of Elián González to his father and set a deadline of April 13, 2000, but the Miami relatives defied the order. Negotiations continued for several days as the house was surrounded by protesters as well as police. The relatives insisted on guarantees that they could live with the child for several months and retain custody, and that González would not be returned to Cuba. Negotiations carried on throughout the night, but Reno stated that the relatives rejected all workable solutions.

On April 19, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in Atlanta ruled that González must remain in the U.S. until his family in Miami could appeal for an asylum hearing in May.

On January 10, 2000, a Florida state court had ruled that the Florida family court was able to decide the merit of motion related with temporary custody by Lázaro González, stating that Elián should stay with the Miami relatives until a further custody hearing. However, Attorney General Janet Reno declared that the federal courts are responsible for deciding this case, and that the Miami relatives must appeal to the federal court. Here, the objective of Reno was to provide the relatives with a chance to provide &quot;any information&quot; they could that would be &quot;relevant in the decision&quot;. She again emphasized that the INS commissioner had declared that the father speaks for the son, and that his wishes were to have his son returned to him.

The judge&#x27;s order cleared the way for González to be returned to his father&#x27;s custody. On April 19, Reno accepted a last-ditch offer at mediation between González&#x27;s relatives from University of Miami president Edward T. Foote II, Carlos Saladrigas, and Carlos de la Cruz. However, a day later Reno made the decision to remove González from the house if the negotiations failed and instructed law enforcement officials to determine the best time to obtain the boy. They decided to hold the raid on either Saturday, April 22, or Monday, April 24, to avoid Good Friday or Easter Sunday. President Bill Clinton urged Reno to keep the negotiations going but approved the raid if they failed.

De la Cruz and Saladrigas convinced Gonzalez&#x27;s relatives in Miami and their attorney Aaron Podhurst to allow Juan Miguel temporary custody over Elián while custody negotiations took place in a safe house in Miami. However, Juan Miguel and his attorney Gregory B. Craig rejected the deal and demanded that the boy be brought to Washington, D.C. They announced their reservations to the deal on the early morning of April 22, a matter of hours before the raid. Reno subsequently called Lázaro González at 2:00 am asking him to hand Elián over to the United States Marshals Service with the promise that she would fly to Miami in the morning to personally negotiate. However, the family refused out of fear that the government would remove Elián from Miami and that doing so would allow Cuban diplomats to abduct him. Fifteen minutes later, President Clinton and Chief of Staff John Podesta told Reno that she could have more time to negotiate with the family, but that she could order the raid if she so chose. Reno subsequently demanded that the family hand over Elian by 4 am without informing them of the impending raid. After being informed of the decision, Marisleysis said to a United States Department of Justice community relations officer, &quot;You think we just have cameras in the house? If people try to come in, they could be hurt.&quot;

===Seizure and reactions===
In the pre-dawn hours of Saturday, April 22, agents of the United States Border Patrol&#x27;s special BORTAC unit, as part of an operation in which more than 130 Immigration and Naturalization Service personnel took part, approached the house, knocked on the door, and identified themselves. When no one responded, they entered. At the same time, pepper-spray and mace were employed against persons outside who attempted to interfere. In the confusion, Armando Gutierrez called in Alan Diaz, of the Associated Press, to enter the house and enter a room with González, his great uncle&#x27;s wife Angela Lázaro, her niece, the niece&#x27;s young son, and Donato Dalrymple (one of the two men who had rescued him from the ocean). They waited in the room listening to agents searching the house. Diaz took a widely publicized photograph of a border patrol agent confronting Dalrymple and the boy. INS subsequently flew Elian out of Miami aboard a Justice Prisoner and Alien Transportation System aircraft.

INS also stated in the days after the raid that they had identified as many as two dozen persons who were &quot;prepared to thwart any government operation&quot;, some of whom had concealed weapons while others had criminal records.

Approximately 100 people protested against the raid as it took place, with some calling the INS agents &quot;assassins&quot;. Then-New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani described BORTAC agents involved in the seizure of Elian as &quot;storm troopers&quot; at least six times. Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association reacted with &quot;strong disgust and dismay&quot; to the Nazi imagery and demanded Giuliani&#x27;s apology. Hillary Clinton, then running against Giuliani for the 2000 United States Senate election in New York, agreed with FLEOA in asking for an apology. Giuliani refused to apologize, although he stated his criticism was aimed at President Clinton and Attorney General Reno. He later withdrew from the race for unrelated reasons.

Public opinion about the INS raid on the Miami González&#x27;s house was widely polarized. There were two major focuses in media coverage of the event: the raid and the family reunions. A &quot;Time&quot; magazine issue showed a photo of a joyful González being reunited with his father (the caption says &quot;Papa!&quot;), while &quot;Newsweek&quot; ran an issue that focused on the raid, entitled &quot;Seizing Elián&quot;.

The struggle between González&#x27;s American family and his father was portrayed in the 2000 television film, &quot;A Family In Crisis: The Elian Gonzales Story&quot;, which starred Esai Morales as Elián&#x27;s father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez; Laura Harring as Elián&#x27;s cousin Marisleysis Gonzalez; and Alec Roberts in the title role.

===Return to father&#x27;s custody===
Four hours after he was taken from the house in Miami, González and his father were reunited at Andrews Air Force Base. The next day, the White House released a photograph showing a smiling González reunited with his father, which the Miami relatives disputed by stating that it was a fake González in the photograph. Later, González and his family were taken to the Aspen Institute Wye River Conference Center in Maryland (formerly known as &quot;Wye Plantation&quot;). The media were barred from access to the family.

While the family was still at Andrews, the Miami González relatives flew to Washington demanding to see Elián. They and their escort, New Hampshire senator Bob Smith, were turned away from the base by guards. The May 5, 2000, &quot;Miami Herald&quot; reported that González was joined by his classmates (without their parents) and his teacher from his hometown, Cárdenas. The newspaper &quot;Granma&quot; released pictures of Elián in his José Martí Pioneer Organization uniform. On May 6, 2000, attorney Craig took González and Juan Miguel to a dinner in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, DC, hosted by Smith and Elizabeth Bagley.

After González was returned to his father&#x27;s custody, he remained in the U.S. while the Miami relatives exhausted their legal options. A three-judge federal panel had ruled that he could not go back to Cuba until he was granted an asylum hearing, but the case turned on the right of the relatives to request that hearing on behalf of the boy. On June 1, 2000, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Elián was too young to file for asylum; only his father could speak for him, and the relatives lacked legal standing. On June 28, 2000, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the decision. In the afternoon of the same day, seven months and one week after Elián González left Cuba, he and his family, along with his classmates and teacher, boarded two chartered planes at Dulles International Airport in Dulles, Virginia, for José Martí International Airport in Havana.

===Political ramifications===

Commentators have suggested that the Elián González affair may have been a factor in voters&#x27; decisions in the 2000 United States presidential election, which was decided by the United States Supreme Court&#x27;s &quot;Bush v. Gore&quot; decision halting the 2000 United States presidential election recount in Florida and awarding the state&#x27;s 25 electoral votes to the Republican Party candidate George W. Bush. The Gonzalez case is believed to have been a major factor in Bush&#x27;s narrow lead in the state as the raid caused Cuban-Americans in Florida to strongly favor him over the Democratic Party nominee Al Gore. Polls in 2001 indicated that Bush captured 80 percent of the Florida Cuban-American vote in 2000, 50,000 votes more than the previous Republican nominee Bob Dole&#x27;s 65 percent of the Florida Cuban-American vote in the 1996 United States presidential election. Later, the 2020 HBO documentary &quot;537 Votes&quot; argued that Bush may have achieved as high as 88 percent of the Florida Cuban-American vote. Gore&#x27;s handling of the matter may have angered the predominantly Republican Cuban community over the boy&#x27;s return to Cuba. Gore initially supported Republican legislation to give the boy and his father permanent residence status, but later supported the administration position. He was attacked by both sides in the dispute for his equivocal position.

In Cuba, the Elián González matter generated popular mobilization across the island seeking González&#x27;s return. Acting on the popular sentiment, Fidel Castro launched a campaign called the Battle of Ideas, which centered on a series of educational initiatives designed to advance socialist ideals including the revolutionary New Man.

==Life in Cuba==
=== Youth and schooling ===
After his return to Cuba, Elián González lived with his father, stepmother, and three brothers in Cárdenas, where his father, Juan Miguel, was a waiter at an Italian restaurant at Josone Park, in Varadero, near Cárdenas. Elián&#x27;s father was interviewed at the restaurant in 2004 by Keith Morrison of the NBC News program &quot;Dateline NBC&quot; and &quot;Cover to Cover&quot; on CNBC. Juan Miguel filmed a home video on which González was shown doing his arithmetic homework with him in their dining room, going to bed in his bedroom with his two younger half-brothers, and attending karate lessons.

Morrison&#x27;s TV report also showed an 18th-century building in Cárdenas which was previously used as a fire station and which was renovated and inaugurated on July 14, 2001, as a museum, called &quot;Museo de la Batalla de Ideas&quot; (&quot;Museum of the Battle of Ideas&quot;), which includes an exhibition room dedicated to González, which houses a life-size bronze statue of González raising a clenched fist. The former González home in Miami has similarly been turned into a museum, with the boy&#x27;s bedroom left unaltered. Juan Miguel is also a member of the National Assembly of People&#x27;s Power and has attended events for the Communist Party of Cuba with González, who has been called up to the stage to meet Fidel Castro.

In September 2005, González was interviewed by &quot;60 Minutes&quot; and stated during the interview that Fidel Castro was a friend, and that he considers Castro &quot;not only as a friend but as a father&quot;; González&#x27;s aunt, Angela González, said she doubted whether the interview represented his true beliefs because of the controls imposed by Cuba on information. In December 2006, an ill Fidel Castro was unable to attend González&#x27;s 13th birthday celebration, so his brother Raúl attended instead.

On August 16, 2006, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the dismissal of an excessive force lawsuit brought by Dalrymple and others against the federal government and Reno.

González joined the Young Communist Union of Cuba in June 2008 shortly after graduating from junior high school. At age 15, he began military school. In a November 2013 speech, González described his time in the United States as &quot;very sad times for me, which marked me for my whole life&quot;, asserting that the Cuban Adjustment Act led to the denial of his rights, including &quot;the right to be together with my father, the right to keep my nationality and to remain in my cultural context&quot;.

=== College and political career ===
In the 2010s, González studied to be an industrial engineer, and hoped to marry his high school girlfriend and fiancée after finishing college. In July 2016, he received a degree in industrial engineering from the University of Matanzas, and read a letter to Fidel Castro from his graduating class, vowing &quot;to fight from whatever trench the revolution demands&quot;. After graduating in 2016, González began working as a technology specialist at a state-run company that makes large plastic water tanks. On Father&#x27;s Day in 2020, González announced that he and his fiancée were expecting a daughter within the following months.

In 2013 González led the Cuban delegation to the 18th World Festival of Youth and Students in Quito, Ecuador. In an interview with CNN en Español he blamed his mother&#x27;s death on economic impact of the United States embargo against Cuba, which he held to be responsible for the economic underdevelopment of the country. González also stated that he was happy that he did not stay in the United States, saying that he would have been manipulated into becoming a &quot;performer&quot; for the Cuban dissident movement and the American media. He also stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t profess to have any religion, but if I did my God would be Fidel Castro.&quot;

In 2015, González was elected to lead his local Committee for the Defense of the Revolution, prompting speculation that he was preparing for a political career. In an interview with the Communist Party of Cuba&#x27;s official newspaper &quot;Granma&quot; that year&quot;,&quot; Gonzalez defended socialism and stated that economic liberalization could result in Cuba becoming a poorer &quot;colony&quot; dominated by the United States. In another interview with ABC News he reiterated his condemnation of the embargo and satisfaction with the outcome of the custody dispute, but expressed hope for better Cuba–United States relations in the future and stated he would like to return to the United States one day &quot;to give my love to the American people&quot;.

In 2017, a documentary on his life called &quot;Elián&quot; was released. The film premiered on April 19, 2017, at the Tribeca Film Festival. It opened in limited release in May, and appeared on CNN Films in August 2017.

González was nominated by the municipal assembly of Cárdenas to run as its candidate for the National Assembly of People&#x27;s Power in the 2023 Cuban parliamentary election. He was elected unopposed along with the CPC&#x27;s slate of 470 candidates and sworn into office in April 2023.

<text>Tatian of Adiabene, or Tatian the Syrian or Tatian the Assyrian, (; ; ; ; – ) was an Assyrian Christian writer and theologian of the 2nd century.

Tatian&#x27;s most influential work is the Diatessaron, a Biblical paraphrase, or &quot;harmony&quot;, of the four gospels that became the standard text of the four gospels in the Syriac-speaking churches until the 5th-century, after which it gave way to the four separate gospels in the Peshitta version.

== Life ==
Concerning the date and place of his birth, little is known beyond what Tatian tells about himself in his &quot;Oratio ad Graecos&quot;, chap. xlii (&quot;Ante-Nicene Fathers&quot;, ii. 81–82): that he was born in &quot;the land of the Assyrians&quot;, scholarly consensus is that he died , perhaps in Adiabene.

He travelled to Rome, where he first encountered Christianity. During his prolonged stay in Rome, according to his own representation, his abhorrence of the pagan cults sparked deep reflections on religious problems. Through the Old Testament, he wrote, he grew convinced of the unreasonableness of paganism. He adopted the Christian religion and became the pupil of Justin Martyr. During this period Christian philosophers competed with Greek sophists. Like Justin, Tatian opened a Christian school in Rome.

Knowledge of Tatian&#x27;s life following the death of Justin in AD 165 is to some extent obscure. Irenaeus remarks (&quot;Haer.&quot;, I., xxviii. 1, &quot;Ante-Nicene Fathers,&quot; i. 353) that after the death of Justin, he was expelled from the church for his Encratitic (ascetic) views, as well as for being a follower of the gnostic leader Valentinius. Eusebius refers to a belief that Tatian had founded the Encratitic sect. It is clear that Tatian left Rome, perhaps to reside for a while in either Greece or Alexandria, where he may have taught Clement of Alexandria. Epiphanius relates that Tatian established a school in Mesopotamia, the influence of which extended to Antioch in Assyria, and was felt in Cilicia and especially in Pisidia.

The early development of the Assyrian church furnishes a commentary on the attitude of Tatian in practical life. Thus for Aphrahat baptism conditions the taking of a vow in which the catechumen promises celibacy. This shows how firmly the views of Tatian were established in Assyria, and it supports the supposition that Tatian was the missionary of the countries around the Euphrates.

== Writings ==
His &quot;Oratio ad Graecos&quot; (Address to the Greeks) condemns paganism as worthless, and praises the reasonableness and high antiquity of Christianity. As early as Eusebius, Tatian was praised for his discussions of the antiquity of Moses and of Jewish legislation, and it was because of this chronological section that his &quot;Oratio&quot; was not generally condemned.

His other major work was the &quot;Diatessaron&quot;, a &quot;harmony&quot; or synthesis of the four New Testament Gospels into a combined narrative of the life of Jesus. Ephrem the Syrian referred to it as the &quot;Evangelion da Mehallete&quot; (&quot;The Gospel of the Mixed&quot;), and it was practically the only gospel text used in Assyria during the 3rd and 4th centuries.

In the mid 5th century the Diatessaron was replaced in those Assyrian churches that used it by the four original Gospels. Rabbula, Bishop of Edessa, ordered the priests and deacons to see that every church should have a copy of the separate Gospels (&quot;Evangelion da Mepharreshe&quot;), and Theodoret, Bishop of Cyrus, removed more than two hundred copies of the &quot;Diatessaron&quot; from the churches in his diocese. The Syriac Sinaitic manuscript of gospels was produced in between AD 411 and 435 as a result of his edict.

A number of recensions of the &quot;Diatessaron&quot; are extant. The earliest, part of the Eastern family of recensions, is preserved in Ephrem&#x27;s &quot;Commentary&quot; on Tatian&#x27;s work, which itself is preserved in two versions: an Armenian translation preserved in two copies, and a copy of Ephrem&#x27;s original Syriac text from the late 5th/early 6th century, which has been edited by Louis Leloir (Paris, 1966). Other translations include translations made into Arabic, Persian, and Old Georgian. A fragment of a narrative about the Passion found in the ruins of Dura-Europos in 1933 was once thought to have been from the &quot;Diatessaron&quot;, but more recent scholarly judgement does not connect it directly to Tatian&#x27;s work.

The earliest member of the Western family of recensions is the Latin Codex Fuldensis, written at the request of bishop Victor of Capua in 545 AD. Although the text is clearly dependent on the Vulgate, the order of the passages is distinctly how Tatian arranged them. Tatian&#x27;s influence can be detected much earlier in such Latin manuscripts as the Old Latin translation of the Bible, in Novatian&#x27;s surviving writings, and in the Roman Antiphony. After the Codex Fuldensis, it would appear that members of the Western family led an underground existence, popping into view over the centuries in an Old High German translation (), a Dutch (), a Venetian manuscript of the 13th century, and a Middle English manuscript from 1400 that was once owned by Samuel Pepys.

In a lost writing entitled &quot;On Perfection according to the Doctrine of the Savior,&quot; Tatian designates matrimony as a symbol of the tying of the flesh to the perishable world and ascribed the &quot;invention&quot; of matrimony to the devil. He distinguishes between the old and the new man; the old man is the law, the new man the Gospel. Other lost writings of Tatian include a work written before the &quot;Oratio ad Graecos&quot; that contrasts the nature of man with the nature of the animals, and a &quot;Problematon biblion&quot;, which aimed to present a compilation of obscure Scripture sayings.

== Theology ==
The starting-point of Tatian&#x27;s theology is a strict monotheism which becomes the source of the moral life. Originally, the human soul possessed faith in one God, but lost it with the fall. In consequence, under the rule of demons, man sank into the abominable error of polytheism. By monotheistic faith, the soul is delivered from the material world and from demonic rule and is united with God. God is spirit (&quot;pneuma&quot;), but not the physical or stoical &quot;pneuma;&quot; he was alone before the creation, but he had within himself potentially the whole creation. Some scholars consider Tatian&#x27;s creation theology as the beginning of teaching &quot;ex nihilo&quot; (creation from &quot;nothing&quot;).

The means of creation was the &quot;dynamis logike&quot; (&quot;power expressed in words&quot;). At first there
proceeded from God the Logos who, generated in the beginning, was to produce the world by creating matter from which the whole creation sprang. Creation is penetrated by the &quot;pneuma hylikon&quot;, &quot;world spirit,&quot; which is common to angels, stars, men, animals, and plants. This world spirit is lower than the divine &quot;pneuma,&quot; and becomes in man the &quot;psyche&quot; or &quot;soul,&quot; so that on the material side and in his soul man does not differ essentially from the animals; though at the same time he is called to a peculiar union with the divine spirit, which raises him above the animals. This spirit is the image of God in man, and to it man&#x27;s immortality is due.

The first-born of the spirits (identified with Satan) fell and caused others to fall, and thus the demons originated. The fall of the spirits was brought about through their desire to separate man from God, in order that he might serve not God but them. Man, however, was implicated in this fall, lost his blessed abode and his soul was deserted by the divine spirit, and sank into the material sphere, in which only a faint reminiscence of God remained alive.

As by freedom man fell, so by freedom he may turn again to God. The Spirit unites with the souls of those who walk uprightly; through the prophets he reminds men of their lost likeness to God. Although Tatian does not mention the name of Jesus, his doctrine of redemption culminates in his Christology.

== Historiography ==
Unlike Justin, who had related the new Christian doctrine to philosophy, Tatian manifests a violent rejection of the forms of philosophical literature with which he is familiar and consequently turns to a safer literary genre: the writing of history.
He thus recapitulates his treatise: Thus I believe I have summarily but with all my rigor analyzed the treatises of the sages, their &#x27;chronologies&#x27; (χρόνοι) and their archives (ναγραφαί), each one in particular&quot; (Tatian Oratio ad Graecos 41.2-3).
Tatian gives the voice for the first time in the Christian lexicon to ναγραφή, annals or documentary chronology.
Tatian claims that the Greeks learned historiography from the Egyptians (Oratio ad Graecos 1.1), who possessed exact techniques for chronology (38.1). For the Syriac the Greeks are skillful literati, bad philosophers, but they can never be good historians, for &quot;for those who have a disjointed chronology it is impossible to say what is true of history&quot; (31.4). The Greeks are embellishers of language and, in general, with respect to productive and artistic techniques they are skilled imitators, not creators or discoverers: &quot;stop calling imitations inventions&quot; (Oratio ad Graecos 1.1).
He then asserts that the Greeks received from other cultures all the disciplines that they managed to practice: divination by dreams, prognostication by the stars, observation of the flight of birds, the art of sacrifice, astronomy, magic, geometry, the alphabet, poetry, singing, the mysteries, plastic arts, anagraphic records, the manufacture of musical instruments and metallurgy (1.1-2) he specifies in each case the nation from which the knowledge that the Greeks have of the arts comes from.
However, although he does not recognize the inventive capacity of the Greeks, Tatian describes himself as a prudent historian on the model of Thucydides, whom he never names. He presents himself as a scholar of documentation &quot;with all my rigor &lt;for you&gt;&quot; (Oratio 41.2.13) Thucydides&#x27; principle. He also distinguishes between annals and documents that are within the historian&#x27;s reach and things that fall outside his direct knowledge (Oratio ad Graecos 20.2), another of Thucydides&#x27; principles. He then accepts the caution of the Greek historians who rejected the mythological &#x27;archaeology&#x27; with which the ancient ethnographers and historians (Titus Livy) had covered the dark path between the known facts and the legendary origin of each city or ethnic group. Another characteristic of the rigorous historian is the personal inspection of places and cities with the discernment of the various types of documentation and sources:
Well then, all these things I do not expound because I learned them from another but because, traveling through many lands I have been a teacher of your own doctrines and have examined many arts and conceptions and finally I was able to study with attention the variety of statues brought by you to the city of Rome. For I do not seek to confirm my doctrines, as the vulgar do, with opinions foreign to my own, but &#x27;I wish to compose anagraphs&#x27; (τὴν ἀναγραφὴν συντάσσσειν βούλομαι) on all those things which by myself I have understood (Oratio ad Graecos 35.1).
What Tatian seems to propose is thus not a philosophy, theology, or exegesis of some revealed text, but a historical truth that attentive study can achieve. 
Nor does he do mythology because in impugning the mythologists as a whole, he uses an argument consonant with the critical historians: Greek theology is mythology, literary invention, with no content of truth. For the first time the voice μυθολογία appears in the Christian lexicon (Oratio ad Graecos 40.1); it specifically signifies the falsification of the philosophy of Moses perpetrated by the Greeks. Their poetry is shameful but, nevertheless, not false in an absolute way, because the &#x27;gods&#x27; exist and act: they are the &#x27;demons&#x27;, who impinge on the deviation of human behavior and are the ones who manage the destructive and evil culture of the whole Greek παιδεία. Greek theology, then, is seen not as a praeparatio evangelica but as a degradatio mosaica, that is, as an imitative corruption of the writings of the Bible (40.1).
Consequently he ends up sustaining several theses, the main one being that Moses is older than all the legislators and writers of humanity (31; 36.2-40.1); that there is no plurality of gods but creational monarchy (Oratio ad Graecos 29.2); that there is no plurality of worlds but only one with only one final judgment to come, which is to be universal (Oratio ad Graecos 6.1).
The literary genre of the Oratio is still that of apologetics, with elements of diatribe and protreptic. Sterling has called it &quot;apologetic historiography.&quot;

<doc id="45159" wikidata="Q22693" url="?curid=45159" title="Olivine">
<text>The mineral olivine () is a magnesium iron silicate with the chemical formula . It is a type of nesosilicate or orthosilicate. The primary component of the Earth&#x27;s upper mantle, it is a common mineral in Earth&#x27;s subsurface, but weathers quickly on the surface. Olivine has many uses, such as the gemstone peridot (or chrysolite), as well as industrial applications like metalworking processes. 

The ratio of magnesium to iron varies between the two endmembers of the solid solution series: forsterite (Mg-endmember: ) and fayalite (Fe-endmember: ). Compositions of olivine are commonly expressed as molar percentages of forsterite (Fo) and/or fayalite (Fa) (&quot;e.g.&quot;, Fo70Fa30, or just Fo70 with Fa30 implied). Forsterite&#x27;s melting temperature is unusually high at atmospheric pressure, almost , while fayalite&#x27;s is much lower – about . Melting temperature varies smoothly between the two endmembers, as do other properties. Olivine incorporates only minor amounts of elements other than oxygen (O), silicon (Si), magnesium (Mg) and iron (Fe). Manganese (Mn) and nickel (Ni) commonly are the additional elements present in highest concentrations.

Olivine gives its name to the group of minerals with a related structure (the olivine group) – which includes tephroite (Mn2SiO4), monticellite (CaMgSiO4), larnite (Ca2SiO4) and kirschsteinite (CaFeSiO4) (commonly also spelled kirschteinite).

Olivine&#x27;s crystal structure incorporates aspects of the orthorhombic P Bravais lattice, which arise from each silica (SiO4) unit being joined by metal divalent cations with each oxygen in SiO4 bound to three metal ions. It has a spinel-like structure similar to magnetite but uses one quadrivalent and two divalent cations M22+ M4+O4 instead of two trivalent and one divalent cations.

==Identification and paragenesis==
Olivine is named for its typically olive-green color, though it may alter to a reddish color from the oxidation of iron.

Translucent olivine is sometimes used as a gemstone called peridot (&quot;péridot&quot;, the French word for olivine). It is also called chrysolite (or &quot;chrysolithe&quot;, from the Greek words for gold and stone), though this name is now rarely used in the English language. Some of the finest gem-quality olivine has been obtained from a body of mantle rocks on Zabargad Island in the Red Sea.

Olivine occurs in both mafic and ultramafic igneous rocks and as a primary mineral in certain metamorphic rocks. Mg-rich olivine crystallizes from magma that is rich in magnesium and low in silica. That magma crystallizes to mafic rocks such as gabbro and basalt. Ultramafic rocks usually contain substantial olivine, and those with an olivine content of over 40% are described as peridotites. Dunite has an olivine content of over 90% and is likely a cumulate formed by olivine crystallizing and settling out of magma or a vein mineral lining magma conduits. Olivine and high pressure structural variants constitute over 50% of the Earth&#x27;s upper mantle, and olivine is one of the Earth&#x27;s most common minerals by volume. The metamorphism of impure dolomite or other sedimentary rocks with high magnesium and low silica content also produces Mg-rich olivine, or forsterite.

Fe-rich olivine fayalite is relatively much less common, but it occurs in igneous rocks in small amounts in rare granites and rhyolites, and extremely Fe-rich olivine can exist stably with quartz and tridymite. In contrast, Mg-rich olivine does not occur stably with silica minerals, as it would react with them to form orthopyroxene ().

Mg-rich olivine is stable to pressures equivalent to a depth of about within Earth. Because it is thought to be the most abundant mineral in Earth&#x27;s mantle at shallower depths, the properties of olivine have a dominant influence upon the rheology of that part of Earth and hence upon the solid flow that drives plate tectonics. Experiments have documented that olivine at high pressures (12 GPa, the pressure at depths of about ) can contain at least as much as about 8900 parts per million (weight) of water, and that such water content drastically reduces the resistance of olivine to solid flow. Moreover, because olivine is so abundant, more water may be dissolved in olivine of the mantle than is contained in Earth&#x27;s oceans.

Olivine pine forest (a plant community) is unique to Norway. It is rare and found on dry olivine ridges in the fjord districts of Sunnmøre and Nordfjord.

===Extraterrestrial occurrences===
Mg-rich olivine has also been discovered in meteorites, on the Moon and Mars, falling into infant stars, as well as on asteroid 25143 Itokawa. Such meteorites include chondrites, collections of debris from the early Solar System; and pallasites, mixes of iron-nickel and olivine. The rare A-type asteroids are suspected to have a surface dominated by olivine.

The spectral signature of olivine has been seen in the dust disks around young stars. The tails of comets (which formed from the dust disk around the young Sun) often have the spectral signature of olivine, and the presence of olivine was verified in samples of a comet from the Stardust spacecraft in 2006. Comet-like (magnesium-rich) olivine has also been detected in the planetesimal belt around the star Beta Pictoris.

==Crystal structure==

Minerals in the olivine group crystallize in the orthorhombic system (space group P&quot;bnm&quot;) with isolated silicate tetrahedra, meaning that olivine is a nesosilicate. The structure can be described as a hexagonal, close-packed array of oxygen ions with half of the octahedral sites occupied with magnesium or iron ions and one-eighth of the tetrahedral sites occupied by silicon ions.

There are three distinct oxygen sites (marked O1, O2 and O3 in figure 1), two distinct metal sites (M1 and M2) and only one distinct silicon site. O1, O2, M2 and Si all lie on mirror planes, while M1 exists on an inversion center. O3 lies in a general position.

==High-pressure polymorphs==
At the high temperatures and pressures found at depth within the Earth the olivine structure is no longer stable. Below depths of about olivine undergoes an exothermic phase transition to the sorosilicate, wadsleyite and, at about depth, wadsleyite transforms exothermically into ringwoodite, which has the spinel structure. At a depth of about , ringwoodite decomposes into silicate perovskite () and ferropericlase () in an endothermic reaction. These phase transitions lead to a discontinuous increase in the density of the Earth&#x27;s mantle that can be observed by seismic methods. They are also thought to influence the dynamics of mantle convection in that the exothermic transitions reinforce flow across the phase boundary, whereas the endothermic reaction hampers it.

The pressure at which these phase transitions occur depends on temperature and iron content. At , the pure magnesium end member, forsterite, transforms to wadsleyite at and to ringwoodite at pressures above . Increasing the iron content decreases the pressure of the phase transition and narrows the wadsleyite stability field. At about 0.8 mole fraction fayalite, olivine transforms directly to ringwoodite over the pressure range . Fayalite transforms to spinel at pressures below . Increasing the temperature increases the pressure of these phase transitions.

==Weathering==
Olivine is one of the less stable common minerals on the surface according to the Goldich dissolution series. It alters into iddingsite (a combination of clay minerals, iron oxides and ferrihydrite) readily in the presence of water. Artificially increasing the weathering rate of olivine, e.g. by dispersing fine-grained olivine on beaches, has been proposed as a cheap way to sequester CO2. The presence of iddingsite on Mars would suggest that liquid water once existed there, and might enable scientists to determine when there was last liquid water on the planet.

Because of its rapid weathering, olivine is rarely found in sedimentary rock.

==Mining==
===Norway===
Norway is the main source of olivine in Europe, particularly in an area stretching from Åheim to Tafjord, and from Hornindal to Flemsøy in the Sunnmøre district. There is also olivine in Eid municipality. About 50% of the world&#x27;s olivine for industrial use is produced in Norway. At Svarthammaren in Norddal olivine was mined from around 1920 to 1979, with a daily output up to 600 metric tons. Olivine was also obtained from the construction site of the hydro power stations in Tafjord. At Robbervika in Norddal municipality an open-pit mine has been in operation since 1984. The characteristic red color is reflected in several local names with &quot;red&quot; such as &quot;Raudbergvik&quot; (Red rock bay) or &quot;Raudnakken&quot; (Red ridge).

Hans Strøm in 1766 described the olivine&#x27;s typical red color on the surface and the blue color within. Strøm wrote that in Norddal district large quantities of olivine were broken from the bedrock and used as sharpening stones.

Kallskaret near Tafjord is a nature reserve with olivine.

==Applications==
Olivine is used as a substitute for dolomite in steel works.

The aluminium foundry industry uses olivine sand to cast objects in aluminium. Olivine sand requires less water than silica sands while still holding the mold together during handling and pouring of the metal. Less water means less gas (steam) to vent from the mold as metal is poured into the mold.

In Finland, olivine is marketed as an ideal rock for sauna stoves because of its comparatively high density and resistance to weathering under repeated heating and cooling.

Gem-quality olivine is used as a gemstone called peridot.
==Experimental uses==
Removal of atmospheric CO2 via reaction with crushed olivine has been considered. The end-products of the very slow reaction are silicon dioxide, magnesium carbonate, and iron oxides. A nonprofit, Project Vesta, is investigating this approach on beaches which increase the agitation and surface area of crushed olivine through wave action.

<text>Peridot ( ), sometimes called chrysolite, is a yellow-green transparent variety of olivine. Peridot is one of the few gemstones that occur in only one color.

Peridot can be found in mafic and ultramafic rocks occurring in lava and peridotite xenoliths of the mantle. The gem occurs in silica-deficient rocks such as volcanic basalt and pallasitic meteorites. Along with diamonds, peridot is one of only two gems observed to be formed not in Earth&#x27;s crust, but in the molten rock of the upper mantle. Gem-quality peridot is rare on Earth&#x27;s surface due to its susceptibility to alteration during its movement from deep within the mantle and weathering at the surface. Peridot has a chemical formula of .

Peridot is one of the birthstones for the month of August.

==Etymology==
The origin of the name &quot;peridot&quot; is uncertain. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; suggests an alteration of Anglo–Norman (classical Latin -), a kind of opal, rather than the Arabic word , meaning &quot;gemstone&quot;.

The &quot;Middle English Dictionary&quot;″s entry on &quot;peridot&quot; includes several variations: , , and  — other variants substitute &quot;y&quot; for letter &quot;i&quot; used here.

The earliest use of the word in English is possibly in the 1705 register of the St. Albans Abbey: The dual entry is in Latin with the translation to English listed as &quot;peridot&quot;. It records that on his death in 1245, Bishop John bequeathed various items, including peridot gems, to the Abbey.

==Appearance==
Peridot is one of the few gemstones that occur in only one color: an olive-green. The intensity and tint of the green, however, depends on the percentage of iron in the crystal structure, so the color of individual peridot gems can vary from yellow, to olive, to brownish-green. In rare cases, peridot may have a medium-dark toned, pure green with no secondary yellow hue or brown mask. Lighter-colored gems are due to lower iron concentrations.

== Mineral properties ==

=== Crystal structure ===

The molecular structure of peridot consists of isomorphic olivine, silicate, magnesium and iron in an orthorhombic crystal system. In an alternative view, the atomic structure can be described as a hexagonal, close-packed array of oxygen ions with half of the octahedral sites occupied by magnesium or iron ions and one-eighth of the tetrahedral sites occupied by silicon ions.

=== Surface property ===
Oxidation of peridot does not occur at natural surface temperature and pressure but begins to occur slowly at with rates increasing with temperature. The oxidation of the olivine occurs by an initial breakdown of the fayalite component, and subsequent reaction with the forsterite component, to give magnetite and orthopyroxene.

==Occurrence==
===Geologically===
Olivine, of which peridot is a type, is a common mineral in mafic and ultramafic rocks, often found in lava and in peridotite xenoliths of the mantle, which lava carries to the surface; however, gem-quality peridot occurs in only a fraction of these settings. Peridots can also be found in meteorites.

Peridots can be differentiated by size and composition. A peridot formed as a result of volcanic activity tends to contain higher concentrations of lithium, nickel and zinc than those found in meteorites.

Olivine is an abundant mineral, but gem-quality peridot is rather rare due to its chemical instability on Earth&#x27;s surface. Olivine is usually found as small grains and tends to exist in a heavily weathered state, unsuitable for decorative use. Large crystals of forsterite, the variety most often used to cut peridot gems, are rare; as a result, peridot is considered to be precious.

In the ancient world, the mining of peridot was called &quot;topazios&quot; then, on St. John&#x27;s Island, in the Red Sea began about 300 .

The principal source of peridot olivine today is the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation in Arizona.
It is also mined at another location in Arizona, and in Arkansas, Hawaii, Nevada, and New Mexico at Kilbourne Hole, in the US; and in Australia, Brazil, China, Egypt, Kenya, Mexico, Myanmar (Burma), Norway, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Sri Lanka, and Tanzania.

===In meteorites===

Peridot crystals have been collected from some pallasite meteorites. The most commonly studied pallasitic peridot belongs to the Indonesian Jeppara meteorite, but others exist such as the Brenham, Esquel, Fukang, and Imilac meteorites. Pallasitic (extraterrestrial) peridot differs chemically from its earthbound counterpart, in that pallasitic peridot lacks nickel.

==Gemology==

Orthorhombic minerals, like peridot, have biaxial birefringence defined by three principal axes: , and . Refractive index readings of faceted gems can range around = 1.651, = 1.668, and = 1.689, with a biaxial positive birefringence of 0.037–0.038. With decreasing magnesium and increasing iron concentration, the specific gravity, color darkness and refractive indices increase, and the shifts toward the index. Increasing iron concentration ultimately forms the iron-rich end-member of the olivine solid solution series fayalite.
A study of Chinese peridot gem samples determined the hydro-static specific gravity to be 3.36 . The visible-light spectroscopy of the same Chinese peridot samples showed light bands between 493.0–481.0 nm, the strongest absorption at 492.0 nm.

The largest cut peridot olivine is a specimen in the gem collection of the Smithsonian Museum in Washington, D.C.

Inclusions are common in peridot crystals but their presence depends on the location where it was found and the geological conditions that led to its crystallization.
* Primary negative crystals – rounded gas bubbles – form in situ with peridot, and are common in Hawaiian peridots.
* Secondary negative crystals form in peridot fractures.
* &quot;Lily pad&quot; cleavages are often seen in San Carlos peridots, and are a type of secondary negative crystal. They can easily be seen under reflected light as circular discs surrounding a negative crystal.
* Silky and rod-like inclusions are common in Pakistani peridots.
* The most common mineral inclusion in peridot is the chromium-rich mineral chromite.
* Magnesium-rich minerals also can exist in the form of pyrope and magnesiochromite. These two types of mineral inclusions are typically surrounded &quot;lily-pad&quot; cleavages. 
* Biotite flakes appear flat, brown, translucent, and tabular.

== Cultural history ==
Peridot has been prized since the earliest civilizations for its claimed protective powers to drive away fears and nightmares, according to superstitions. There is a superstition that it carries the gift of &quot;inner radiance&quot;, sharpening the mind and opening it to new levels of awareness and growth, helping one to recognize and realize one&#x27;s destiny and spiritual purpose. 

Peridot olivine is the birthstone for the month of August.

Peridot has often been mistaken for emerald beryl and other green gems. Noted gemologist G.F. Kunz discussed the confusion between beryl and peridot in many church treasures, most notably the &quot;Three Magi treasure&quot; in the Dom of Cologne, Germany.

<text>Orthoclase, or orthoclase [[feldspar]] (endmember formula KAlSi3O8), is an important tectosilicate mineral which forms igneous rock. The name is from the Ancient Greek for &quot;straight fracture&quot;, because its two cleavage planes are at right angles to each other. It is a type of alkali feldspar, also known as potassium feldspar or K-spar. The gem known as moonstone (see below) is largely composed of orthoclase.

== Formation and subtypes ==

Orthoclase is a common constituent of most granites and other felsic igneous rocks and often forms huge crystals and masses in pegmatite.

Typically, the pure potassium endmember of orthoclase forms a solid solution with albite, the sodium endmember (NaAlSi3O8) of plagioclase. While slowly cooling within the earth, sodium-rich albite lamellae form by exsolution, enriching the remaining orthoclase with potassium. The resulting intergrowth of the two feldspars is called perthite.

The higher-temperature polymorph of KAlSi3O8 is sanidine. Sanidine is common in rapidly cooled volcanic rocks such as obsidian and felsic pyroclastic rocks, and is notably found in trachytes of the Drachenfels, Germany. The lower-temperature polymorph of KAlSi3O8 is microcline.

Adularia is a low temperature form of either microcline or orthoclase originally reported from the low temperature hydrothermal deposits in the Adula Alps of Switzerland. It was first described by Ermenegildo Pini in 1781. The optical effect of adularescence in moonstone is typically due to adularia.

The largest documented single crystal of orthoclase was found in the Ural Mountains in Russia. It measured around and weighed around .

==Applications==

Together with the other potassium feldspars, orthoclase is a common raw material for the manufacture of some glasses and some ceramics such as porcelain, and as a constituent of scouring powder.

Some intergrowths of orthoclase and albite have an attractive pale luster and are called moonstone when used in jewelry. Most moonstones are translucent and white, although grey and peach-colored varieties also occur. In gemology, their luster is called adularescence and is typically described as creamy or silvery white with a &quot;billowy&quot; quality. It is the state gem of Florida.

The gemstone commonly called &quot;rainbow moonstone&quot; is more properly a colorless form of labradorite and can be distinguished from &quot;true&quot; moonstone by its greater transparency and play of color, although their value and durability do not greatly differ.

Orthoclase is one of the ten defining minerals of the Mohs scale of mineral hardness, on which it is listed as having a hardness of 6.

NASA&#x27;s &quot;Curiosity&quot; rover discovery of high levels of orthoclase in Martian sandstones suggested that some Martian rocks may have experienced complex geological processing, such as repeated melting.

<text>Microcline (KAlSi3O8) is an important igneous rock-forming tectosilicate mineral. It is a potassium-rich alkali feldspar. Microcline typically contains minor amounts of sodium. It is common in granite and pegmatites. Microcline forms during slow cooling of orthoclase; it is more stable at lower temperatures than orthoclase. Sanidine is a polymorph of alkali feldspar stable at yet higher temperature. Microcline may be clear, white, pale-yellow, brick-red, or green; it is generally characterized by cross-hatch twinning that forms as a result of the transformation of monoclinic orthoclase into triclinic microcline.

The chemical compound name is potassium aluminium silicate, and it is known as E number reference E555.

==Geology==

Microcline may be chemically the same as monoclinic orthoclase, but because it belongs to the triclinic crystal system, the prism angle is slightly less than right angles; hence the name &quot;microcline&quot; from the Greek &quot;small slope&quot;. It is a fully ordered triclinic modification of potassium feldspar and is dimorphous with orthoclase. Microcline is identical to orthoclase in many physical properties, and can be distinguished by x-ray or optical examination. When viewed under a polarizing microscope, microcline exhibits a minute multiple twinning which forms a grating-like structure that is unmistakable.

Perthite is either microcline or orthoclase with thin lamellae of exsolved albite.

Amazon stone, or amazonite, is a green variety of microcline. It is not found anywhere in the Amazon Basin, however. The Spanish explorers who named it apparently confused it with another green mineral from that region.

The largest documented single crystals of microcline were found in Devil&#x27;s Hole Beryl Mine, Colorado, US and measured ~50 × 36 × 14 m. This could be one of the largest crystals of any material found so far.

Microcline is exceptionally active ice-nucleating agent in the atmosphere. Recently it has been possible to understand how water binds to the microcline surface.

==As food additive==
The chemical compound name is potassium aluminium silicate, and it is known as E number reference E555. It was the subject in 2018 of a Call for technical and toxicological data from the EFSA.

In 2008, it (along with other Aluminum compounds) was the subject of 
a Scientific Opinion of the Panel on Food Additives, Flavourings, Processing Aids and Food Contact Materials from the EFSA.

<text>The mineral anorthoclase ((Na,K)AlSi3O8) is a crystalline solid solution in the alkali feldspar series, in which the sodium-aluminium silicate member exists in larger proportion. It typically consists of between 10 and 36 percent of KAlSi3O8 and between 64 and 90 percent of NaAlSi3O8.
==Structure and stability==
Anorthoclase is an intermediate member of the high albite – sanidine alkali feldspar solid solution series. Intermediate members of this series, high albite, anorthoclase and high sodium sanidine are stable at temperatures of and above. Below only very limited solution exists (less than about 5% on both the low albite and microcline ends). Anorthoclase and high albite exhibit triclinic symmetry, whereas sanidine and the low temperature orthoclase have monoclinic symmetry. If the high temperature intermediate composition alkali feldspars are allowed to cool slowly, exsolution occurs and a perthite structure results.

==Occurrence==

Anorthoclase occurs in high temperature sodium rich volcanic and hypabyssal (shallow intrusive) rocks. The mineral is typically found as a constituent of the fine grained matrix or as small phenocrysts which may occur as loose crystals in a weathered rock.

It was first described in 1885 for an occurrence on Pantelleria Island, Trapani Province, Sicily. The name is from the Greek αν-, ορθός and κλάσις (not cleaving at right-angles), for its oblique cleavage.

<text>Plagioclase ( ) is a series of tectosilicate (framework silicate) minerals within the feldspar group. Rather than referring to a particular mineral with a specific chemical composition, plagioclase is a continuous solid solution series, more properly known as the plagioclase feldspar series. This was first shown by the German mineralogist Johann Friedrich Christian Hessel (1796–1872) in 1826. The series ranges from albite to anorthite endmembers (with respective compositions NaAlSi3O8 to CaAl2Si2O8), where sodium and calcium atoms can substitute for each other in the mineral&#x27;s crystal lattice structure. Plagioclase in hand samples is often identified by its polysynthetic crystal twinning or &quot;record-groove&quot; effect.

Plagioclase is a major constituent mineral in Earth&#x27;s crust and is consequently an important diagnostic tool in petrology for identifying the composition, origin and evolution of igneous rocks. Plagioclase is also a major constituent of rock in the highlands of the Moon. Analysis of thermal emission spectra from the surface of Mars suggests that plagioclase is the most abundant mineral in the crust of Mars.

Its name comes , in reference to its two cleavage angles.

== Properties ==
Plagioclase is the most common and abundant mineral group in the Earth&#x27;s crust. Part of the feldspar family of minerals, it is abundant in igneous and metamorphic rock, and it is also common as a detrital mineral in sedimentary rock. It is not a single mineral, but is a solid solution of two end members, albite or sodium feldspar () and anorthite or calcium feldspar (). These can be present in plagioclase in any proportion from pure anorthite to pure albite. The composition of plagioclase can thus be written as where &quot;x&quot; ranges from 0 for pure albite to 1 for pure anorthite. This solid solution series is known as the plagioclase series. The composition of a particular sample of plagioclase is customarily expressed as the mol% of anorthite in the sample. For example, plagioclase that is 40 mol% anorthite would be described as An40 plagioclase.

The ability of albite and anorthite to form solid solutions in any proportions at elevated temperature reflects the ease with which calcium and aluminium can substitute for sodium and silicon in the plagioclase crystal structure. Although a calcium ion has a charge of +2, versus +1 for a sodium ion, the two ions have very nearly the same effective radius. The difference in charge is accommodated by the coupled substitution of aluminium (charge +3) for silicon (charge +4), both of which can occupy tetrahedral sites (surrounded by four oxygen ions). This contrasts with potassium, which has the same charge as sodium, but is a significantly larger ion. As a result of the size and charge difference between potassium and calcium, there is a very wide miscibility gap between anorthite and potassium feldspar, (), the third common rock-forming feldspar end member. Potassium feldspar does form a solid solution series with albite, due to the identical charges of sodium and potassium ions, which is known as the alkali feldspar series. Thus, almost all feldspar found on Earth is either plagioclase or alkali feldspar, with the two series overlapping for pure albite. When a plagioclase composition is described by its anorthite mol% (such as An40 in the previous example) it is assumed that the remainder is albite, with only a minor component of potassium feldspar.

Plagioclase of any composition shares many basic physical characteristics, while other characteristics vary smoothly with composition. The Mohs hardness of all plagioclase species is 6 to 6.5, and cleavage is perfect on [001] and good on [010], with the cleavage planes meeting at an angle of 93 to 94 degrees. It is from this slightly oblique cleavage angle that plagioclase gets its name, Ancient Greek ( &#x27;oblique&#x27;) + ( &#x27;fracture&#x27;). The name was introduced by August Breithaupt in 1847. There is also a poor cleavage on [110] rarely seen in hand samples.

The luster is vitreous to pearly and the diaphaneity is transparent to translucent. The tenacity is brittle, and the fracture is uneven or conchoidal, but the fracture is rarely observed due to the strong tendency of the mineral to cleave instead. At low temperature, the crystal structure belongs to the triclinic system, space group &quot;P&quot; Well-formed crystals are rare and are most commonly sodic in composition. Well-shaped samples are instead typically cleavage fragments. Well-formed crystals are typically bladed or tabular parallel to [010].

Plagioclase is usually white to greyish-white in color, with a slight tendency for more calcium-rich samples to be darker. Impurities can infrequently tint the mineral greenish, yellowish, or flesh-red. Ferric iron (Fe3+) gives a pale yellow color in plagioclase feldspar from Lake County, Oregon. The specific gravity increases smoothly with calcium content, from 2.62 for pure albite to 2.76 for pure anorthite, and this can provide a useful estimate of composition if measured accurately. The index of refraction likewise varies smoothly from 1.53 to 1.58, and, if measured carefully, this also gives a useful composition estimate.

Plagioclase almost universally shows a characteristic polysynthetic twinning that produces twinning striations on [010]. These striations allow plagioclase to be distinguished from alkali feldspar. Plagioclase often also displays Carlsbad, Baveno, and Manebach Law twinning.

== Plagioclase series members ==
The composition of a plagioclase feldspar is typically denoted by its overall fraction of anorthite (%An) or albite (%Ab). There are several named plagioclase feldspars that fall between albite and anorthite in the series. The following table shows their compositions in terms of constituent anorthite and albite percentages.

The distinction between these minerals cannot easily be made in the field. The composition can be roughly determined by specific gravity, but accurate measurement requires chemical or optical tests. The composition in a crushed grain mount can be obtained by the Tsuboi method, which yields an accurate measurement of the minimum refractive index that in turn gives an accurate composition. In thin section, the composition can be determined by either the Michel Lévy or Carlsbad-albite methods. The former relies on accurate measure of minimum index of refraction, while the latter relies on measuring the &quot;extinction angle&quot; under a polarizing microscope. The extinction angle is an optical characteristic and varies with the albite fraction (%Ab).

=== Endmembers ===

*Anorthite was named by Gustav Rose in 1823 from Greek (&#x27;not&#x27;) + (&#x27;straight&#x27;), literally &#x27;oblique&#x27;, referring to its triclinic crystallization. Anorthite is a comparatively rare mineral but occurs in the basic plutonic rocks of some orogenic calc-alkaline suites.
*Albite is named from the Latin , in reference to its unusually pure white color. The name was first applied by Johan Gottlieb Gahn and Jöns Jacob Berzelius in 1815. It is a relatively common and important rock-making mineral associated with the more silica-rich rock types, in hydrothermal veins, with greenschist facies metamorphic rocks, and in pegmatite dikes, often as the variety &quot;cleavelandite&quot; and associated with rarer minerals like tourmaline and beryl.

=== Intermediate members ===
The intermediate members of the plagioclase group are very similar to each other and normally cannot be distinguished except by their optical properties. The specific gravity in each member (albite 2.62) increases 0.02 per 10% increase in anorthite (2.75).

*Bytownite, named after the former name for Ottawa, Ontario, Canada—Bytown— is a rare mineral occasionally found in more basic rocks.
*Labradorite is the characteristic feldspar of the more basic rock types such as gabbro or basalt. Labradorite frequently shows an iridescent display of colors due to light refracting within the lamellae of the crystal. It is named after Labrador, where it is a constituent of the intrusive igneous rock anorthosite which is composed almost entirely of plagioclase. A variety of labradorite known as spectrolite is found in Finland.
*Andesine is a characteristic mineral of rocks such as diorite which contain a moderate amount of silica and related volcanics such as andesite.
*Oligoclase is common in granite and monzonite. The name &quot;oligoclase&quot; is derived from the Greek (&#x27;small, slight&#x27;) + (&#x27;fracture&#x27;), in reference to the fact that its cleavage angle differs significantly from 90°. The term was first used by Breithaupt in 1826. Sunstone is mainly oligoclase (sometimes albite) with flakes of hematite.

== Petrogenesis ==
Plagioclase is the primary aluminium-bearing mineral in mafic rocks formed at low pressure. It is normally the first and most abundant feldspar to crystallize from a cooling primitive magma. Anorthite has a much higher melting point than albite, and, as a result, calcium-rich plagioclase is the first to crystallize. The plagioclase becomes more enriched in sodium as the temperature drops, forming Bowen&#x27;s continuous reaction series. However, the composition with which plagioclase crystallizes also depends on the other components of the melt, so it is not by itself a reliable thermometer.

The liquidus of plagioclase (the temperature at which the plagioclase first begins to crystallize) is about for olivine basalt, with a composition of 50.5 wt% silica; in andesite with a silica content of 60.7 wt%; and in dacite with a silica content of 69.9 wt%. These values are for dry magma. The liquidus is greatly lowered by the addition of water, and much more for plagioclase than for mafic minerals. The eutectic (minimum melting mixture) for a mixture of anorthite and diopside shifts from 40 wt% anorthite to 78 wt% anorthite as the water vapor pressure goes from 1 bar to 10 kbar. The presence of water also shifts the composition of the crystallizing plagioclase towards anorthite. The eutectic for this wet mixture drops to about .

Crystallizing plagioclase is always richer in anorthite than the melt from which it crystallizes. This &quot;plagioclase effect&quot; causes the residual melt to be enriched in sodium and silicon and depleted in aluminium and calcium. However, the simultaneous crystallization of mafic minerals not containing aluminium can partially offset the depletion in aluminium. In volcanic rock, the crystallized plagioclase incorporates most of the potassium in the melt as a trace element.

New plagioclase crystals nucleate only with difficulty, and diffusion is very slow within the solid crystals. As a result, as a magma cools, increasingly sodium-rich plagioclase is usually crystallized onto the rims of existing plagioclase crystals, which retain their more calcium-rich cores. This results in compositional zoning of plagioclase in igneous rocks. In rare cases, plagioclase shows reverse zoning, with a more calcium-rich rim on a more sodium-rich core. Plagioclase also sometimes shows oscillatory zoning, with the zones fluctuating between sodium-rich and calcium-rich compositions, though this is usually superimposed on an overall normal zoning trend.

=== Classification of igneous rocks ===
Plagioclase is very important for the classification of crystalline igneous rocks. Generally, the more silica is present in the rock, the fewer the mafic minerals, and the more sodium-rich the plagioclase. Alkali feldspar appears as the silica content becomes high. Under the QAPF classification, plagioclase is one of the three key minerals, along with quartz and alkali feldspar, used to make the initial classification of the rock type. Low-silica igneous rocks are further divided into dioritic rocks having sodium-rich plagioclase (An&lt;50) and gabbroic rocks having calcium-rich plagioclase (An&gt;50). Anorthosite is an intrusive rock composed of at least 90% plagioclase.

Albite is an end member of both the alkali and plagioclase series. However, it is included in the alkali feldspar fraction of the rock in the QAPF classification.

=== In metamorphic rocks ===
Plagioclase is also common in metamorphic rock. Plagioclase tends to be albite in low-grade metamorphic rock, while oligoclase to andesine are more common in medium- to high-grade metamorphic rock. Metacarbonate rock sometimes contains fairly pure anorthite.

=== In sedimentary rocks ===
Feldspar makes up between 10 and 20 percent of the framework grains in typical sandstones. Alkali feldspar is usually more abundant than plagioclase in sandstone because Alkali feldspars are more resistant to chemical weathering and more stable, but sandstone derived from volcanic rock contains more plagioclase. Plagioclase weathers relatively rapidly to clay minerals such as smectite.

=== At the Mohorovičić discontinuity ===
The Mohorovičić discontinuity, which defines the boundary between the Earth&#x27;s crust and the upper mantle, is thought to be the depth where feldspar disappears from the rock. While plagioclase is the most important aluminium-bearing mineral in the crust, it breaks down at the high pressure of the upper mantle, with the aluminium tending to be incorporated into clinopyroxene as &quot;Tschermak&#x27;s molecule&quot; () or in jadeite . At still higher pressure, the aluminium is incorporated into garnet.

=== Exsolution ===

At very high temperatures, plagioclase forms a solid solution with potassium feldspar, but this becomes highly unstable on cooling. The plagioclase separates from the potassium feldspar, a process called &quot;exsolution&quot;. The resulting rock, in which fine streaks of plagioclase (&quot;lamellae&quot;) are present in potassium feldspar, is called perthite.

The solid solution between anorthite and albite remains stable to lower temperatures, but ultimately becomes unstable as the rock approaches ambient surface temperatures. The resulting exsolution results in very fine lamellar and other intergrowths, normally detected only by sophisticated means. However, exsolution in the andesine to labradorite compositional range sometimes produces lamellae with thicknesses comparable to the wavelength of visible light. This acts like a diffraction grating, causing the labradorite to show the beautiful play of colors known as &quot;chatoyance&quot;.

== Uses ==
In addition to its importance to geologists in classifying igneous rocks, plagioclase finds practical use as construction aggregate, as dimension stone, and in powdered form as a filler in paint, plastics, and rubber. Sodium-rich plagioclase finds use in the manufacture of glass and ceramics.

Anorthosite could someday be important as a source of aluminium.

<text>The Godfather is a crime novel by American author Mario Puzo. Originally published on 10 March 1969 by G. P. Putnam&#x27;s Sons, the novel details the story of a fictional Mafia family in New York City and Long Island, headed by Vito Corleone: the Godfather. The novel covers the years 1945 to 1955 and includes the backstory of Vito Corleone from early childhood to adulthood.

The first in a series of novels, &quot;The Godfather&quot; is noteworthy for introducing Italian words like &quot;consigliere&quot;, &quot;caporegime&quot;, &quot;Cosa Nostra&quot;, and &quot;omertà&quot; to an English-speaking audience. It inspired a 1972 film of the same name. Two film sequels, including new contributions by Puzo himself, were made in 1974 and 1990.

==Summary==
The Corleone family is one of the Five Families of the New York Mafia. After World War II, the families avoid open warfare in favour of mutual cooperation. The peace is broken after Don Vito Corleone is shot by men working for drug kingpin Virgil &quot;The Turk&quot; Sollozzo. Two of Corleone&#x27;s sons, Santino (Sonny) and Michael, take an active role in the family business with the help of &quot;consigliere&quot; Tom Hagen and the family&#x27;s two &quot;caporegimes&quot;, Peter Clemenza and Salvatore Tessio. When Michael murders Sollozzo and his bodyguard, corrupt NYPD Captain Mark McCluskey, the conflict escalates into a full-scale war which results in Sonny&#x27;s murder. Michael must return from hiding in Sicily to assume control of the family as the new Don. Under his retired father&#x27;s tutelage, Michael orchestrates a plan to exact revenge, while relocating the Corleone family&#x27;s power base to Las Vegas in order to further his goal of legitimizing the family and getting them out of organized crime. This encompasses the murder of all of the Corleone family&#x27;s enemies, including Michael&#x27;s brother-in-law Carlo Rizzi, who played a part in Sonny&#x27;s murder. After selling all of the family&#x27;s remaining businesses in New York, the Corleones permanently move to Las Vegas.

==Main characters==
The Corleone family patriarch is Vito Corleone (the Don), whose surname represents the Sicilian town of his birth, Corleone. His birth name is Vittorio Andolini, but after immigrating to the United States following the deaths of his parents and brother, he changed it to the name of his home village as one of his few acts of sentimentality. Vito fathered four children: Sonny Corleone, Fredo Corleone, Michael Corleone, and Connie Corleone. He also has an informally adopted Irish son, Tom Hagen, who became the Corleone family&#x27;s &quot;consigliere&quot; (counselor). Vito Corleone is also godfather to the famous singer and movie star Johnny Fontane. The godfather referred to in the title is Vito, but the story&#x27;s main character becomes Michael. The novel&#x27;s central storyline details Michael&#x27;s destiny to succeed his father as the head of the family empire, despite his desire to lead an Americanized life with his girlfriend (and eventual wife) Kay Adams.

The Corleone family is a criminal organization with national influence, notably protection, gambling, and union racketeering. Serving as the Don&#x27;s underboss is his oldest son, Sonny. The operational side of the organization is headed by two &quot;caporegimes&quot;, Peter Clemenza and Salvatore Tessio. Other significant members of the organization include Connie&#x27;s abusive husband Carlo Rizzi and enforcers Luca Brasi and Al Neri.

==Reception==

In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Roger Jellinek wrote that the book was &quot;bound to be hugely successful, and not simply because the Mafia is in the news. Mr. Puzo&#x27;s novel is a voyeur’s dream, a skillful fantasy of violent personal power without consequences. The victims of the Corleone &#x27;family&#x27; are hoods, or corrupt cops – nobody you or I would actually want to know. Just business, as Don Vito would say, not personal. You never glimpse regular people in the book, let alone meet them, so there is no opportunity to sympathize with anyone but the old patriarch, as he makes the world safe for his beloved &#x27;family.&#x27;&quot; The novel remained on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for 67 weeks and sold over nine million copies in two years.

The novel is #53 on the PBS The Great American Read list of &quot;America&#x27;s 100 most-loved books&quot;. In the UK, the novel was #91 on the 2003 BBC The Big Read list of the top 200 novels in the United Kingdom, based on the goal of finding the &quot;Nation&#x27;s Best-loved Novel&quot;.

==Film adaptation==
The 1972 film adaptation of the novel was released with Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone and Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, directed by Francis Ford Coppola. Mario Puzo assisted with both the writing of the screenplay and other production tasks. The film grossed approximately $269 million worldwide and won various awards, including three Academy Awards, five Golden Globes and one Grammy. The film is considered to be tremendously significant in cinematic history. The sequel, &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; won six Oscars, and became the first sequel to win the Academy Award for Best Picture.

The film&#x27;s plot follows the novel except for such details as backstories of some characters that are excluded, although they were filmed. Some of this footage was included in later re-edited versions such as, &quot;The Godfather Saga.&quot; The subplot involving Johnny Fontane in Hollywood was not filmed. The most significant deviation of the film from the novel was that the latter had a more positive ending than the film in which Kay Corleone accepts Michael&#x27;s decision to take over his father&#x27;s business. The film ends with Kay&#x27;s realization of Michael&#x27;s callousness, a theme that would develop in the second and third films, which are largely not based on the original novel. Vito Corleone&#x27;s backstory appeared in the second film, with his character portrayed by Robert De Niro.

==Sequels==
In 1984, Puzo&#x27;s literary sequel to &quot;The Godfather&quot; was published. Titled &quot;The Sicilian&quot;, it chronicles the life of &quot;Giuliano&quot; (Salvatore Giuliano) but the Corleone family is featured heavily throughout, Michael Corleone in particular. Chronologically this story sits between Michael&#x27;s exile to Sicily in 1950 (Book VI) and his return to the United States (Book VII). For copyright reasons, the Corleone family involvement was cut from the Michael Cimino film adaptation, which is not considered part of the &quot;Godfather&quot; film series.

In 2004, Random House published a sequel to Puzo&#x27;s &quot;The Godfather&quot;, &quot;The Godfather Returns&quot;, by Mark Winegardner. A further sequel by Winegardner, &quot;The Godfather&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, was released in 2006. These novels continue the story from Puzo&#x27;s novel.

&quot;The Godfather Returns&quot; picks up the story immediately after the end of Puzo&#x27;s &quot;The Godfather&quot;. It covers the years 1955 to 1962, as well as providing significant backstory for Michael Corleone&#x27;s character prior to the events of the first novel. The events of the film &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; all take place within the timeframe of this novel, but are only mentioned in the background. The novel contains an appendix that attempts to correlate the events of the novels with the events of the films.

&quot;The Godfather&#x27;s Revenge&quot; covers the years 1963 to 1964.

Continuing Puzo&#x27;s habit, as seen in &quot;The Godfather&quot;, of featuring characters who are close analogs of real-life events and public figures (as Johnny Fontane is an analog of Frank Sinatra), Winegardner features in his two &quot;Godfather&quot; novels analogs of Joseph, John F. and Robert F. Kennedy, as well as alleged organized crime figure Carlos Marcello (Carlo Tramonti). In &quot;The Godfather Returns&quot;, Winegardner also dramatizes the sweep of organized crime arrests that took place in Apalachin, New York, in 1957.

Winegardner uses all of the characters from the Puzo novels and created a few of his own, most notably Nick Geraci, a Corleone soldier who plays a pivotal role in the sequel novels. Winegardner further develops characters from the original novel, such as Fredo Corleone, Tom Hagen, and Johnny Fontane.

In 2012, a prequel based on an unproduced screenplay by Mario Puzo titled &quot;The Family Corleone&quot;, was written by Ed Falco. It tells the story of how Vito Corleone rises to Don and how Sonny Corleone and Tom Hagen enter the family business.

==Literary references==
The Corleone family closely resembles the Karamazov family in &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot;: a powerful father, an impulsive oldest son, a philosophical son, a sweet-tempered son, and an adopted stepson who is maintained as an employee. Honoré de Balzac&#x27;s novel &quot;Le Père Goriot&quot; (1835) has been the inspiration for notable lines that have gained wide popularity in cinema history. Similarly, Puzo opened his 1969 novel with an epigraph popularly attributed to Balzac: &quot;Behind every great fortune there is a crime.&quot; The saying is most likely evolved over time from Balzac&#x27;s original text: &quot;The secret of a great success for which you are at a loss to account is a crime that has never been found out because it was properly executed.&quot;

&quot;I&#x27;m gonna make him an offer he can&#x27;t refuse&quot; was included in both the original Puzo novel and in the film adaptation. It is the second-ranking cinematic quote included in AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes (2005) by the American Film Institute. Its origin may be from the same work to which Balzac is credited with the opening epigraph. Balzac wrote of Vautrin telling Eugene: &quot;In that case, I will make you an offer that no one would decline.&quot;

==Real-life influences==
Large parts of the novel are based upon reality, notably the history of the &quot;Five Families&quot;, the Mafia organization in New York and the surrounding area. The novel also includes many allusions to real-life mobsters and their associates. For example, Johnny Fontane is based on Frank Sinatra, and Moe Greene on Bugsy Siegel. In addition, the character of Vito Corleone was a composite of real-life organized crime bosses Frank Costello and Carlo Gambino.
