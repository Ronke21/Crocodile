<text>Molfetta (; Molfettese: ) is a town located in the northern side of the Metropolitan City of Bari, Apulia, southern Italy.

It has a well restored old city, and its own dialect.

==History==
The earliest local signs of permanent habitation are at the Neolithic site of Pulo, one of the most important such sites in southern Italy. The origins of the city can be traced to a small fishing port; antique graves testify to a fisherman&#x27;s village in the fourth century BC. The position of the future city offered a valid landing to the commerce of Roman Rubo. The first indication of a toponym on the coast between &quot;Turenum&quot; (Trani) and &quot;Natiolum&quot; (Giovinazzo) is in the &quot;Itinerarium Provinciarum Antonini Augusti&quot;, edited from a third-century core. The place denominated &quot;Respa&quot; was probably a wrong transcript of the toponym &quot;Melpha&quot;, referring to a small village of fishermen.

The first official document that mentions the city dates to November 925; it documents a &quot;civitas&quot; denominated Melfi, situated on a peninsula named Sant&#x27;Andrea. The city developed under Byzantine dominion, and was later conquered by the Lombards, who included it in the Duchy of Benevento. The city repelled repeated assaults by the Emirate of Bari. As an independent seaport, Molfetta traded with other Mediterranean markets, including Venice, Alexandria, Constantinople, Syria, Amalfi and Ragusa.

At the beginning of the 11th century the Normans arrived, and the autonomy that the city preserved helped foster its development as both a commercial port with the east, and as port of embarcation for pilgrims heading to the Holy Land. The Crusades permitted the city to assume a wider importance. Among the many pilgrims was Conrad of Bavaria, who was so enamoured of the city that he became venerated as San Corrado, the protecting saint of Molfetta. During the Angevin dominion the city succeeded in remaining autonomous. However, the arrival of the Aragonese kingdom to Southern Italy, spurred turbulent struggles between French, Spanish and Italians. These wars provoked death and destruction in the whole south of Italy: the Sack of Molfetta at the hands of the French, 18–19 July 1529, was an episode that stalled the economic rebirth of the city.

In February 2006, Molfetta hosted International Youth Parliament, an event which took place the previous year in Canterbury.

==Geography==
Located in the north-western corner of its province, near the borders with the one of Barletta-Andria-Trani, and by the Adriatic Coast, Molfetta borders with the municipalities of Bisceglie (BT), Giovinazzo, Terlizzi and Ruvo di Puglia. The town is 27 km from Andria, 31 from Barletta and 34 from Bari.

==Main sights==
*&quot;Il Pulo&quot; is one of the most important Neolithic sites of southern Italy. It is a circular cave deep with grottoes and remains of old constructions.
*The Old Cathedral (&quot;:it:Duomo di San Corrado&quot;) was built in the twelfth–thirteenth centuries in Apulian-Romanesque style, using local stone on a basilica plan, a nave with two aisles divided by four central cross-shaped pilasters. The floor has two domes. From the apse area rise two towers, one of which acted as watchtower, the other has the usual campanile. The interior has some notable religious furnishings from the sixteenth century.
*Several watchtowers, such as the &quot;Torre Calderina&quot; (fifteenth century) on the seaside, and the &quot;Torrione Passari&quot;, inglobated in the town&#x27;s walls.
*The New Cathedral, or church of &quot;S. Maria Assunta in Cielo&quot;, was built by the Jesuits from 1610. It houses the remains of the city&#x27;s patron, &quot;San Corrado of Bavaria&quot;, in a silver reliquary bust of the saint (seventeenth century) by G. Todaro.
*The church of &quot;San Bernardino da Siena&quot; (1451, rebuilt in 1585) includes a triptych by Duccio d&#x27;Andrea (fifteenth century) and other later paintings. Notable is the Renaissance choir. The annexed convent is now the Palazzo Civico (town hall).
*The church of &quot;Santo Stefano&quot;, built from 1286, but with a Renaissance stone façade added in 1586.
*&quot;Palazzo Giovene&quot; is a 16th-century palace, now used as Town Hall. It has a notable Renaissance style portal.
*The church of &quot;Santa Maria Consolatrice degli Afflitti&quot;, simply known as Chiesa del Purgatorio, dating from 1643 and consecrated in 1667. The façade has statues representing Sts. Stephen, Peter, Paul and Lawrence and, on the two side summits, those of St. Joaquim and St. Anne. The interior houses paintings by Bernardo Cavallino and native-son Corrado Giaquinto.
*The church of &quot;San Pietro Apostolo&quot;, simply called &quot;San Pietro&#x27;s Church&quot;, just existing in the twelfth century, but with the actual Baroque façade and bell tower, situated in the old town, at the begin of the street of the some name, near the Municipio Square.
*The &quot;Temple of Calvary&quot;, a small Neo-Gothic construction built in 1856 and designed by the local architect Corrado De Judicibus.
*Two km outside the city in the direction of Bisceglie, is the basilica-sanctuary of the &quot;Madonna dei Martiri&quot;. The current nave of the church is partially built over the old eleventh-century church, of which only a dome and the underlying structure remain, in today&#x27;s altar area. Annexed is the Crusaders Hospital, also from the eleventh century. The basilica conserves an image that was a votive gift of some Crusaders in 1188.
* The Molfetta Lighthouse on the eastern pier; still active today.

== People ==
Personalities from Molfetta include Cardinal Angelo Amato, Rossella Biscotti (artist), Luigi Capotorti (19th-century composer), Leonardo Andriani (immigrant), Corrado Giaquinto (Rococo painter), Domenico Leccisi (notorious for stealing Mussolini&#x27;s corpse), Riccardo Muti (conductor), Girolamo Minervini (assassinated magistrate), Caparezza (rapper), Gaetano Salvemini (anti-fascist politician and writer), and Vitangelo Spadavecchia (goalkeeper).

==Migration==
During the times of the mass migration of Italians, mainly following World War II, many Molfettese residents migrated to Fremantle in Western Australia and to a town in South Australia called Port Pirie. The culture of Molfetta is celebrated in Fremantle and Port Pirie. Officials of both Port Pirie and Molfetta have close links today. In the United States, many Molfettese immigrants settled in the city of Hoboken, New Jersey, where a substantial enclave still exists today.

<doc id="45340" wikidata="Q227967" url="?curid=45340" title="Pope Paschal II">
<text>Pope Paschal II (; 1050  1055 – 21 January 1118), born Ranierius, was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 13 August 1099 to his death in 1118. A monk of the Abbey of Cluny, he was created the cardinal-priest of San Clemente by Pope Gregory VII (1073–85) in 1073. He was consecrated as pope in succession to Pope Urban II (1088–99) on 19 August 1099. His reign of almost twenty years was exceptionally long for a medieval pope.

==Early career==
Ranierius was born in Bleda, near Forlì, Romagna. He became a monk at Cluny at an early age.

== Papacy ==

After Pope Urban II&#x27;s death, Paschal reacted to the success of the First Crusade by preaching the penitential Crusade of 1101. 

During the long struggle of the papacy with the Holy Roman emperors over investiture, Paschal II zealously carried on the Hildebrandine policy in favor of papal privilege, but with only partial success. Henry V, son of Emperor Henry IV, took advantage of his father&#x27;s excommunication to rebel, even to the point of seeking out Paschal II for absolution for associating with his father. But, Henry V was even more persistent in maintaining the right of investiture than Emperor Henry IV had been before his death in 1106. The imperial Diet at Mainz invited Paschal II to visit Germany and settle the trouble in January 1106, but the pope in the Council of Guastalla (October 1106) simply renewed the prohibition of investiture.

In the same year he brought to an end the investiture struggle in England, in which Anselm, archbishop of Canterbury, had been engaged with King Henry I, by retaining to himself exclusive right to invest with the ring and crozier, but recognizing the royal nomination to vacate benefices and the oath of fealty for temporal domains. Paschal went to France at the close of 1106 to seek the mediation of King Philip I and his son Louis in the imperial struggle, but he returned to Italy in September 1107, his negotiations remaining without result. When Henry V advanced with an army into Italy in order to be crowned, the pope agreed to a compact in February 1111 which stipulated that before receiving the imperial crown, Henry was to abjure all claims to investitures, whilst the pope undertook to compel the prelates and abbots of the empire to restore all the temporal rights and privileges which they held from the crown. Preparations were made for the coronation on 12 February 1111, but the Romans rose in revolt against Henry, and the German king retired, taking the pope and Curia with him.

After 61 days of harsh imprisonment, during which Prince Robert I of Capua&#x27;s Norman army was repulsed on its rescue mission, Paschal II yielded and guaranteed investiture to the emperor. Henry V was then crowned in St. Peter&#x27;s on 13 April 1111, and, after exacting a promise that no revenge would be taken for what had happened, withdrew beyond the Alps. The Hildebrandine party was aroused to action, however; a Lateran council of March 1112 declared null and void the concessions extorted by violence; a council held at Vienne in October 1111 excommunicated the emperor; and Paschal II sanctioned the proceeding.
Pope Paschal II ordered the building of the basilica of Santi Quattro Coronati on the ashes of the one burned during the Norman sack of Rome in 1084.

During Paschal&#x27;s trip to France in 1106–1107, he consecrated the Cluniac church of Notre Dame at La Charité-sur-Loire, the second largest church in Europe at the time.

Towards the end of his pontificate trouble began anew in England; Paschal II complained in 1115 that councils were held and bishops translated without his authorization, and he threatened Henry I with excommunication. Matilda of Tuscany was said to have bequeathed all her allodial lands to the Church upon her death in 1115, but the donation was neither publicly acknowledged in Rome nor is any documentary record of the donation preserved. Emperor Henry V at once laid claim to Matilda&#x27;s lands as imperial fiefs and forced the pope to flee from Rome. Paschal II returned after the emperor&#x27;s withdrawal at the beginning of 1118, but died within a few days, on 21 January 1118.

In 1116, Paschal II, at the behest of Count Ramon Berenguer III of Barcelona, issued a crusade for the capture of Tarragona.

During Paschal&#x27;s papacy some efforts were made by the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I to bridge the schism between the Orthodox and the Catholic Church, but these failed, as Paschal pressed the demand that the patriarch of Constantinople recognise the pope&#x27;s primacy over &quot;all the churches of God throughout the world&quot; in late 1112. This was something Orthodox Patriarchs Nicholas Grammaticus and John Agapetus could not do in face of opposition from the majority of clergy, the monastic world, and the laity.

Pope Paschal II issued the bull &quot;Pie postulatio voluntatis&quot; on 15 February 1113. It brought under Papal protection and confirmed as a religious order the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem, later known as the Knights Hospitaller and today known as the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. It also confirmed the order&#x27;s acquisitions and donations in Europe and Asia and exempted it from all authority save that of the pope.

<doc id="45342" wikidata="Q208375" url="?curid=45342" title="William Byrd">
<text>William Byrd (; 4 July 1623) was an English Renaissance composer. Considered among the greatest composers of the Renaissance, he had a profound influence on composers both from his native country and on the Continent. He is often considered along with John Dunstaple and Henry Purcell as one of England&#x27;s most important composers of early music.

Byrd wrote in many of the forms current in England at the time, including various types of sacred and secular polyphony, keyboard (the so-called Virginalist school), and consort music. He produced sacred music for Anglican services, but during the 1570s became a Roman Catholic, and wrote Catholic sacred music later in his life.

==Life==

===Birth and background===
Richard Byrd of Ingatestone, Essex, the paternal grandfather of Thomas Byrd, probably moved to London in the 15th century. Thereafter succeeding generations of the Byrd family are described as gentlemen.

William Byrd was probably born in London, the third surviving son of Thomas Byrd and his wife, Margery. No record of his birth has survived, and the year of his birth is not known for certain, but a document dated 2 October 1598, and written by William Byrd, states that he is &quot;58 yeares or ther abouts&quot;, making the year he was born to be 1539 or 1540. Byrd&#x27;s will of November 1622 provides a later date for his birth, as in it Byrd states that he was then in the &quot;80th year of mine age&quot;. The historian Kerry McCarthy has suggested that discrepancy over these dates may have been due to the will not being kept up to date over a period of several years.

Byrd was born into a musical and relatively wealthy family. He had two older brothers, Symond and John, who became London merchants and active members of their respective livery companies. One of his four sisters, Barbara, was married to a maker of musical instruments who kept a shop; his three other sisters, Martha, Mary and Alice, were probably also married to merchants.

===Youth and early career===
Details of Byrd&#x27;s childhood are speculative. There is no documentary evidence concerning Byrd&#x27;s education or early musical training. His two brothers were choristers at St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, and Byrd may have been a chorister there as well, although it is possible that he was a chorister with the Chapel Royal. According to Anthony Wood, Byrd was &quot;bred up to musick under Tho. Tallis&quot;, and a reference in the &quot;Cantiones sacrae&quot;, published by Byrd and Thomas Tallis in 1575, tends to confirm that Byrd was a pupil of Tallis in the Chapel Royal. If he was—and conclusive evidence has not emerged to verify it—it seems likely that once Byrd&#x27;s voice broke, the boy stayed on at the Chapel Royal as Tallis&#x27;s assistant.

Byrd produced student compositions, including &quot;Sermone Blando&quot; for consort, and a &quot;Miserere&quot;. Church music for the Catholic rite reintroduced by Mary would have been composed before her death in 1558, which occurred when Byrd was eighteen. His early compositions suggest he was taught polyphony when a student.

===Lincoln===

Byrd&#x27;s first known professional employment was his appointment in 1563 as organist and master of the choristers at Lincoln Cathedral. Residing at what is now 6 Minster Yard Lincoln, he remained in post until 1572. His period at Lincoln was not entirely trouble-free, for on 19 November 1569 the Dean and Chapter cited him for &#x27;certain matters alleged against him&#x27; as the result of which his salary was suspended. Since Puritanism was influential at Lincoln, it is possible that the allegations were connected with over-elaborate choral polyphony or organ playing. A second directive, dated 29 November, issued detailed instructions regarding Byrd&#x27;s use of the organ in the liturgy. 

On 14 September 1568, Byrd was married in the church of St Margaret-in-the-Close, Lincoln. His wife, Juliana, came from the Birley family of Lincolnshire. The baptism records mention two of their children, Christopher and Elizabeth, but the marriage produced at least seven children.

===The Chapel Royal===

In 1572, following the death of the composer Robert Parsons, who drowned in the Trent near Newark on 25 January of that year, Byrd obtained the post of Gentleman of the Chapel Royal, the largest choir of its kind in England. The appointment, which was for life, came with a good salary. Almost from the outset Byrd is named as &#x27;organist&#x27;, which however was not a designated post but an occupation for any Chapel Royal member capable of filling it. 

Byrd&#x27;s appointment at the Chapel Royal increased his opportunities to widen his scope as a composer and also to make contacts at the court of Queen Elizabeth. The Queen was a moderate Protestant who eschewed the more extreme forms of Puritanism and retained a fondness for elaborate ritual, besides being a music lover and keyboard player herself. Byrd&#x27;s output of Anglican church music (defined in the strictest sense as sacred music designed for performance in church) is small, but it stretches the limits of elaboration then regarded as acceptable by some reforming Protestants who regarded highly wrought music as a distraction from the Word of God.

In 1575 Byrd and Tallis were jointly granted a monopoly for the printing of music and ruled music paper for 21 years, one of a number of patents issued by the Crown for the printing of books, which was the first known issuing of letters patent. The two musicians used the services of the French Huguenot printer Thomas Vautrollier, who had settled in England and previously produced an edition of a collection of Lassus chansons in London (&quot;&quot;, 1570). 

The two monopolists took advantage of the patent to produce a grandiose joint publication under the title &quot;Cantiones quae ab argumento sacrae vocantur&quot;. It was a collection of 34 Latin motets dedicated to the Queen herself, accompanied by elaborate prefatory matter including poems in Latin elegiacs by the schoolmaster Richard Mulcaster and the young courtier Ferdinand Heybourne (aka Richardson). There are 17 motets each by Tallis and Byrd, one for each year of the Queen&#x27;s reign.

The &quot;Cantiones&quot; were a financial failure. In 1577 Byrd and Tallis were forced to petition Queen Elizabeth for financial help, pleading that the publication had &quot;fallen oute to oure greate losse&quot; and that Tallis was now &quot;verie aged&quot;. They were subsequently granted the leasehold on various lands in East Anglia and the West Country for a period of 21 years.

===Catholicism===
From the early 1570s onwards Byrd became increasingly involved with Catholicism, which, as the scholarship of the last half-century has demonstrated, became a major factor in his personal and creative life. As John Harley has shown, it is probable that Byrd&#x27;s parental family were Protestants, though whether by deeply felt conviction or nominal conformism is not clear. Byrd himself may have held Protestant beliefs in his youth, for a recently discovered fragment of a setting of an English translation of Martin Luther&#x27;s hymn &quot;&quot;, which bears an attribution to &quot;Birde&quot; includes the line &quot;From Turk and Pope defend us Lord&quot;. However, from the 1570s onwards he is found associating with known Catholics, including Lord Thomas Paget, to whom he wrote a petitionary letter on behalf of an unnamed friend in about 1573. Byrd&#x27;s wife Julian was first cited for recusancy (refusing to attend Anglican services) at Harlington in Middlesex, where the family then lived, in 1577. Byrd himself appears in the recusancy lists from 1584.

His involvement with Catholicism took on a new dimension in the 1580s. Following Pope Pius V&#x27;s papal bull &quot;Regnans in Excelsis&quot;, in 1570, which absolved Elizabeth&#x27;s subjects from allegiance to her and effectively made her an outlaw in the eyes of the Catholic Church, Catholicism became increasingly identified with sedition in the eyes of the Tudor authorities. With the influx of missionary priests trained at the English College, Douai (now in France but then part of the Spanish Netherlands), and in Rome from the 1570s onwards, relations between the authorities and the Catholic community took a further turn for the worse. Byrd himself is found in the company of prominent Catholics. In 1583 he got into serious trouble because of his association with Paget, who was suspected of involvement in the Throckmorton Plot, and for sending money to Catholics abroad. As a result of this, Byrd&#x27;s membership of the Chapel Royal was apparently suspended for a time, restrictions were placed on his movements, and his house was placed on the search list. In 1586 he attended a gathering at a country house in the company of Father Henry Garnett (later executed for complicity in the Gunpowder Plot) and the Catholic poet Robert Southwell.

===Stondon Massey===
In about 1594 Byrd&#x27;s career entered a new phase. He was now in his early fifties, and seems to have gone into semi-retirement from the Chapel Royal. He moved with his family from Harlington to Stondon Massey, a small village near Chipping Ongar in Essex. His ownership of Stondon Place, where he lived for the rest of his life, was contested by Joanna Shelley, with whom he engaged in a legal dispute lasting about a decade and a half. The main reason for the move was apparently the proximity of Byrd&#x27;s patron Sir John Petre, son of Sir William Petre. A wealthy local landowner, Petre was a discreet Catholic who maintained two local manor houses, Ingatestone Hall and Thorndon Hall, the first of which still survives in a much-altered state (the latter has been rebuilt). Petre held clandestine Mass celebrations, with music provided by his servants, which were subject to the unwelcome attention of spies and paid informers working for the Crown.

Byrd&#x27;s acquaintance with the Petre family extended back at least to 1581 (as his surviving autograph letter of that year shows) and he spent two weeks at the Petre household over Christmas in 1589. He was ideally equipped to provide elaborate polyphony to adorn the music making at the Catholic country houses of the time. The ongoing adherence of Byrd and his family to Catholicism continued to cause him difficulties, though a surviving reference to a lost petition apparently written by Byrd to Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury sometime between 1605 and 1612 suggests that he had been allowed to practise his religion under licence during the reign of Elizabeth. Nevertheless, he regularly appeared in the quarterly local assizes and was reported to the archdeaconry court for non-attendance at the parish church. He was required to pay heavy fines for recusancy.

===Anglican church music===
Byrd&#x27;s staunch adherence to Catholicism did not prevent him from contributing memorably to the repertory of Anglican church music. Byrd&#x27;s small output of church anthems ranges in style from relatively sober early examples (&quot;O Lord, make thy servant Elizabeth our queen&quot; (a6) and &quot;How long shall mine enemies&quot; (a5) ) to other, evidently late works such as &quot;Sing joyfully&quot; (a6) which is close in style to the English motets of Byrd&#x27;s 1611 set, discussed below. Byrd also played a role in the emergence of the new verse anthem, which seems to have evolved in part from the practice of adding vocal refrains to consort songs. Byrd&#x27;s four Anglican service settings range in style from the unpretentious Short Service, already discussed, to the magnificent so-called Great Service, a grandiose work which continues a tradition of opulent settings by Richard Farrant, William Mundy and Parsons. Byrd&#x27;s setting is on a massive scale, requiring five-part &quot;Decani&quot; and &quot;Cantoris&quot; groupings in antiphony, block homophony and five, six and eight-part counterpoint with verse (solo) sections for added variety. This service setting, which includes an organ part, must have been sung by the Chapel Royal Choir on major liturgical occasions in the early seventeenth century, though its limited circulation suggests that many other cathedral choirs must have found it beyond them. Nevertheless, the source material shows that it was sung in York Minster as well as Durham, Worcester and Cambridge, in the early seventeenth century. The Great Service was in existence by 1606 (the last copying date entered in the so-called Baldwin Commonplace Book) and may date back as far as the 1590s. Kerry McCarthy has pointed out that the York Minster manuscript of the Great Service was copied by a vicar-choral named John Todd, apparently between 1597 and 1599, and is described as &#x27;Mr Byrd&#x27;s new sute of service for means&#x27;. This suggests the possibility that the work may have been Byrd&#x27;s next compositional project after the three Mass settings.

===Later years===
During his later years Byrd also added to his output of consort songs, a number of which were discovered by Philip Brett and Thurston Dart when Brett was a university student in the early 1960s. They probably reflect Byrd&#x27;s relationship with the Norfolk landowner and music-lover Sir Edward Paston (1550–1630) who may have written some of the poems. The songs include elegies for public figures such as the Earl of Essex (1601), the Catholic matriarch and viscountess Montague Magdalen Dacre (&quot;With Lilies White&quot;, 1608) and Henry Prince of Wales (1612). Others refer to local notabilities or incidents from the Norfolk area.

Byrd remained in Stondon Massey until his death, due to heart failure, on 4 July 1623, which was noted in the Chapel Royal Check Book in a unique entry describing him as &quot;a Father of Musick&quot;. Despite repeated citations for recusancy and persistent heavy fines, he died a rich man, having rooms at the time of his death at the London home of the Earl of Worcester.

==Music==
During his lifetime, Byrd published three volumes of &quot;Cantiones Sacrae&quot; (1575, co-written with Tallis; 1589; 1591), two volumes of &quot;Gradualia&quot; (1605; 1607), &quot;Psalmes, Sonets, and Songs of Sadnes and Pietie&quot; (1588), &quot;Songs of Sundrie Natures&quot; (1589), and &quot;Psalmes, Songs, and Sonnets&quot; (1611). He also composed other vocal and instrumental pieces; three Masses, music for the &quot;Fitzwilliam Virginal Book&quot;, and motets.

===Early compositions===
One of Byrd&#x27;s earliest compositions was a collaboration with two Chapel Royal singing-men, John Sheppard and William Mundy, on a setting for four male voices of the psalm &quot;In exitu Israel&quot; for the procession to the font in Easter week. It was probably composed near the end of the reign of Queen Mary Tudor (1553–1558), who revived Sarum liturgical practices.

A few other compositions by Byrd also probably date from his teenage years. These include his setting of the Easter responsory &quot;Christus resurgens&quot; (a4) which was not published until 1605, but which as part of the Sarum liturgy could also have been composed during Mary&#x27;s reign, as well as &quot;Alleluia confitemini (a3)&quot; which combines two liturgical items for Easter week. Some of the hymns and antiphons for keyboard and for consort may also date from this period, though it is also possible that the consort pieces may have been composed in Lincoln for the musical training of choirboys.

The 1560s were also important formative years for Byrd the composer. His &quot;Short Service&quot;, an unpretentious setting of items for the Anglican Matins, Communion and Evensong services, which seems to have been designed to comply with the Protestant reformers&#x27; demand for clear words and simple musical textures, may well have been composed during the Lincoln years. It is at any rate clear that Byrd was composing Anglican church music, for when he left Lincoln the Dean and Chapter continued to pay him at a reduced rate on condition that he would send the cathedral his compositions. Byrd had also taken serious strides with instrumental music. The seven &quot;In Nomine&quot; settings for consort (two a4 and five a5), at least one of the consort fantasias (&quot;Neighbour&quot; F1 a6) and a number of important keyboard works were apparently composed during the Lincoln years. The latter include the &quot;Ground in Gamut&quot; (described as &quot;Mr Byrd&#x27;s old ground&quot;) by his future pupil Thomas Tomkins, the A minor Fantasia, and probably the first of Byrd&#x27;s great series of keyboard pavanes and galliards, a composition which was transcribed by Byrd from an original for five-part consort. All these show Byrd gradually emerging as a major figure on the Elizabethan musical landscape.

Some sets of keyboard variations, such as &quot;The Hunt&#x27;s Up&quot; and the imperfectly preserved set on &quot;Gypsies&#x27; Round&quot; also seem to be early works. As we have seen, Byrd had begun setting Latin liturgical texts as a teenager, and he seems to have continued to do so at Lincoln. Two exceptional large-scale psalm motets, &quot;Ad Dominum cum tribularer&quot; (a8) and &quot;Domine quis habitabit&quot; (a9), are Byrd&#x27;s contribution to a paraliturgical form cultivated by Robert White and Parsons. &quot;De lamentatione&quot;, another early work, is a contribution to the Elizabethan practice of setting groups of verses from the &quot;Lamentations of Jeremiah&quot;, following the format of the &quot;Tenebrae&quot; lessons sung in the Catholic rite during the last three days of Holy Week. Other contributors in this form include Tallis, White, Parsons and the elder Ferrabosco. It is likely that this practice was an expression of Elizabethan Catholic nostalgia, as a number of the texts suggest.

===&quot;Cantiones sacrae&quot; (1575)===
Byrd&#x27;s contributions to the &quot;Cantiones&quot; are in various different styles, although his forceful musical personality is stamped on all of them. The inclusion of &quot;Laudate pueri&quot; (a6) which proves to be an instrumental fantasia with words added after composition, is one sign that Byrd had some difficulty in assembling enough material for the collection. &quot;Diliges Dominum&quot; (a8), which may also originally have been untexted, is an eight-in-four retrograde canon of little musical interest. Also belonging to the more archaic stratum of motets is &quot;Libera me Domine&quot; (a5), a &quot;cantus firmus&quot; setting of the ninth responsory at Matins for the Office for the Dead, which takes its point of departure from the setting by Parsons, while &quot;Miserere mihi&quot; (a6), a setting of a Compline antiphon often used by Tudor composers for didactic &quot;cantus firmus&quot; exercises, incorporates a four-in-two canon. &quot;Tribue Domine&quot; (a6) is a large-scale sectional composition setting from a medieval collection of &quot;Meditationes&quot; which was commonly attributed to St Augustine, composed in a style which owes much to earlier Tudor settings of votive antiphons as a mosaic of full and semichoir passages. Byrd sets it in three sections, each beginning with a semichoir passage in archaic style.

Byrd&#x27;s contribution to the &quot;Cantiones&quot; also includes compositions in a more forward-looking manner which point the way to his motets of the 1580s. Some of them show the influence of the motets of Ferrabosco I, a Bolognese musician who worked in the Tudor court at intervals between 1562 and 1578. Ferrabosco&#x27;s motets provided direct models for Byrd&#x27;s &quot;Emendemus in melius&quot; (a5), &quot;O lux beata Trinitas&quot; (a6), &quot;Domine secundum actum meum&quot; (a6) and &quot;Siderum rector&quot; (a5) as well as a more generalised paradigm for what Joseph Kerman has called Byrd&#x27;s &#x27;affective-imitative&#x27; style, a method of setting pathetic texts in extended paragraphs based on subjects employing curving lines in fluid rhythm and contrapuntal techniques which Byrd learnt from his study of Ferrabosco.

===&quot;Cantiones sacrae&quot; (1589 and 1591)===
Byrd&#x27;s commitment to the Catholic cause found expression in his motets, of which he composed about 50 between 1575 and 1591. While the texts of the motets included by Byrd and Tallis in the 1575 &quot;Cantiones&quot; have a High Anglican doctrinal tone, scholars such as Joseph Kerman have detected a profound change of direction in the texts which Byrd set in the motets of the 1580s. In particular there is a persistent emphasis on themes such as the persecution of the chosen people (&quot;Domine praestolamur&quot; a5) the Babylonian or Egyptian captivity (&quot;Domine tu iurasti&quot;) and the long-awaited coming of deliverance (&quot;Laetentur caeli&quot;, &quot;Circumspice Jerusalem&quot;). This has led scholars from Kerman onwards to believe that Byrd was reinterpreting biblical and liturgical texts in a contemporary context and writing laments and petitions on behalf of the persecuted Catholic community, which seems to have adopted Byrd as a kind of &#x27;house&#x27; composer. Some texts should probably be interpreted as warnings against spies (&quot;Vigilate, nescitis enim&quot;) or lying tongues (&quot;Quis est homo&quot;) or celebration of the memory of martyred priests (&quot;O quam gloriosum&quot;). Byrd&#x27;s setting of the first four verses of Psalm 78 (&quot;Deus venerunt gentes&quot;) is widely believed to refer to the brutal execution of Fr Edmund Campion in 1581 an event that caused widespread revulsion on the Continent as well as in England. Finally, and perhaps most remarkably, Byrd&#x27;s &quot;Quomodo cantabimus&quot; is the result of a motet exchange between Byrd and Philippe de Monte, who was director of music to Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor, in Prague. In 1583 De Monte sent Byrd his setting of verses 1–4 of Vulgate Psalm 136 (&quot;Super flumina Babylonis&quot;), including the pointed question &quot;How shall we sing the Lord&#x27;s song in a strange land?&quot; Byrd replied the following year with a setting of the defiant continuation, set, like de Monte&#x27;s piece, in eight parts and incorporating a three-part canon by inversion.

Thirty-seven of Byrd&#x27;s motets were published in two sets of &quot;Cantiones sacrae&quot;, which appeared in 1589 and 1591. Together with two sets of English songs, discussed below, these collections, dedicated to powerful Elizabethan lords (Edward Somerset, 4th Earl of Worcester and John Lumley, 1st Baron Lumley), probably formed part of Byrd&#x27;s campaign to re-establish himself in Court circles after the reverses of the 1580s. They may also reflect the fact that Byrd&#x27;s fellow monopolist Tallis and his printer Thomas Vautrollier had died, thus creating a more propitious climate for publishing ventures. Since many of the motet texts of the 1589 and 1591 sets are pathetic in tone, it is not surprising that many of them continue and develop the &#x27;affective-imitative&#x27; vein found in some motets from the 1570s, though in a more concise and concentrated form. &quot;Domine praestolamur&quot; (1589) is a good example of this style, laid out in imitative paragraphs based on subjects which characteristically emphasise the expressive minor second and minor sixth, with continuations which subsequently break off and are heard separately (another technique which Byrd had learnt from his study of Ferrabosco). Byrd evolved a special &quot;cell&quot; technique for setting the petitionary clauses such as &quot;miserere mei&quot; or &quot;libera nos Domine&quot; which form the focal point for a number of the texts. Particularly striking examples of these are the final section of &quot;Tribulatio proxima est&quot; (1589) and the multi-sectional &quot;Infelix ego&quot; (1591), a large-scale motet which takes its point of departure from &quot;Tribue Domine&quot; of 1575.

There are also a number of compositions which do not conform to this stylistic pattern. They include three motets which employ the old-fashioned cantus firmus technique as well as the most famous item in the 1589 collection, &quot;Ne irascaris Domine&quot;. the second part of which is closely modelled on Philip van Wilder&#x27;s popular &quot;Aspice Domine&quot;. A few motets, especially in the 1591 set, abandon traditional motet style and resort to vivid word painting which reflects the growing popularity of the madrigal (&quot;Haec dies&quot;, &quot;Laudibus in sanctis&quot;, 1591). A famous passage from Thomas Morley&#x27;s &quot;A Plaine and Easie Introduction to Practicall Musicke&quot; (1597) supports the view that the madrigal had superseded the motet in the favour of Catholic patrons, a fact which may explain why Byrd composed few non-liturgical motets after 1591.

===The English song-books of 1588 and 1589===
In 1588 and 1589 Byrd also published two collections of English songs. The first, &quot;Psalms, Sonnets and Songs of Sadness and Pietie&quot; (1588), contains the first madrigals published in England. It consists mainly of adapted consort songs, which Byrd, probably guided by commercial instincts, had turned into vocal part-songs by adding words to the accompanying instrumental parts and labelling the original solo voice as &quot;the first singing part&quot;. The consort song, which was the most popular form of vernacular polyphony in England in the third quarter of the sixteenth century, was a solo song for a high voice (often sung by a boy) accompanied by a consort of four consort instruments (normally viols). As the title of Byrd&#x27;s collection implies, consort songs varied widely in character. Many were settings of metrical psalms, in which the solo voice sings a melody in the manner of the numerous metrical psalm collections of the day (e.g. &quot;Sternhold and Hopkins Psalter&quot;, 1562) with each line prefigured by imitation in the accompanying instruments. Others are dramatic elegies, intended to be performed in the boy-plays which were popular in Tudor London. A popular source for song settings was Richard Edwards&#x27; &quot;The paradyse of dainty devices&quot; (1576) of which seven settings in consort song form survive.

Byrd&#x27;s 1588 collection, which complicates the form as he inherited it from Parsons, Richard Farrant and others, reflects this tradition. The &quot;psalms&quot; section sets texts drawn from Sternhold&#x27;s psalter of 1549 in the traditional manner, while the &#x27;sonnets and pastorals&#x27; section employs lighter, more rapid motion with crotchet (quarter-note) pulse, and sometimes triple metre (&quot;Though Amaryllis dance in green, If women could be fair&quot;). Poetically, the set (together with other evidence) reflects Byrd&#x27;s involvement with the literary circle surrounding Sir Philip Sidney, whose influence at Court was at its height in the early 1580s. Byrd set three of the songs from Sidney&#x27;s sonnet sequence &quot;Astrophel and Stella&quot;, as well as poems by other members of the Sidney circle, and also included two elegies on Sidney&#x27;s death in the Battle of Zutphen in 1586. But the most popular item in the set was the Lullaby (&quot;Lullay lullaby&quot;) which blends the tradition of the dramatic lament with the cradle-songs found in some early boy-plays and medieval mystery plays. It long retained its popularity. In 1602, Byrd&#x27;s patron Edward Somerset, 4th Earl of Worcester, discussing Court fashions in music, predicted that &quot;in winter lullaby, an owld song of Mr Birde, wylbee more in request as I thinke.&quot;

The &quot;Songs of Sundrie Natures&quot; (1589) contain sections in three, four, five and six parts, a format which follows the plan of many Tudor manuscript collections of household music and was probably intended to emulate the madrigal collection Musica transalpina, which had appeared in print the previous year. Byrd&#x27;s set contains compositions in a wide variety of musical styles, reflecting the variegated character of the texts which he was setting. The three-part section includes settings of metrical versions of the seven penitential psalms, in an archaic style which reflects the influence of the psalm collections. Other items from the three-part and four-part section are in a lighter vein, employing a line-by-line imitative technique and a predominant crotchet pulse (&quot;The nightingale so pleasant (a3), Is love a boy? (a4)&quot;). The five-part section includes vocal part-songs which show the influence of the &quot;adapted consort song&quot; style of the 1588 set but which seem to have been conceived as all-vocal part-songs. Byrd also bowed to tradition by setting two carols in the traditional form with alternating verses and burdens, (&quot;From Virgin&#x27;s womb this day did spring, An earthly tree, a heavenly fruit, both a6&quot;) and even included an &quot;anthem&quot;, a setting of the Easter prose &quot;Christ rising again&quot; which also circulated in church choir manuscripts with organ accompaniment.

===&quot;My Ladye Nevells Booke&quot;===
The 1580s were also a productive decade for Byrd as a composer of instrumental music. On 11 September 1591 John Baldwin, a tenor lay-clerk at St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor and later a colleague of Byrd in the Chapel Royal, completed the copying of &quot;My Ladye Nevells Booke&quot;, a collection of 42 of Byrd&#x27;s keyboard pieces, which was probably produced under Byrd&#x27;s supervision and includes corrections which are thought to be in the composer&#x27;s hand. Byrd would almost certainly have published it if the technical means had been available to do so. The dedicatee long remained unidentified, but John Harley&#x27;s researches into the heraldic design on the fly-leaf have shown that she was Lady Elizabeth Neville, the third wife of Sir Henry Neville of Billingbear House, Berkshire, who was a justice of the peace and a warden of Windsor Great Park. Under her third married name, Lady Periam, she also received the dedication of Thomas Morley&#x27;s two-part canzonets of 1595. The contents show Byrd&#x27;s mastery of a wide variety of keyboard forms, though liturgical compositions based on plainsong are not represented. The collection includes a series of ten pavans and galliards in the usual three-strain form with embellished repeats of each strain. (The only exception is the Ninth Pavan, which is a set of variations on the passamezzo antico bass.)
There are indications that the sequence may be a chronological one, for the First Pavan is labelled &quot;the first that ever hee made&quot; in the &quot;Fitzwilliam Virginal Book&quot;, and the Tenth Pavan, which is separated from the others, evidently became available at a late stage before the completion date. It is dedicated to William Petre (the son of Byrd&#x27;s patron Sir John Petre, 1st Baron Petre) who was only 15 years old in 1591 and could hardly have played it if it had been composed much earlier. The collection also includes two famous pieces of programme music. &quot;The Battle&quot;, which was apparently inspired by an unidentified skirmish in Elizabeth&#x27;s Irish wars, is a sequence of movements bearing titles such as &quot;The marche to fight&quot;, &quot;The battells be joyned&quot; and &quot;The Galliarde for the victorie&quot;. Although not representing Byrd at his most profound, it achieved great popularity and is of incidental interest for the information which it gives on sixteenth-century English military calls. It is followed by &quot;The Barley Break&quot; (a mock-battle follows a real one), a light-hearted piece which follows the progress of a game of &quot;barley-break&quot;, a version of the game now known as &quot;piggy in the middle&quot;, played by three couples with a ball. &quot;My Ladye Nevells Booke&quot; also contains two monumental Grounds, and sets of keyboard variations of variegated character, notably the huge set on &quot;Walsingham&quot; and the popular variations on &quot;Sellinger&#x27;s Round&quot;, &quot;Carman&#x27;s Whistle&quot; and &quot;My Lord Willoughby&#x27;s Welcome Home&quot;. The fantasias and voluntaries in Nevell also cover a wide stylistic range, some being austerely contrapuntal (&quot;A voluntarie&quot;, no. 42) and others lighter and more Italianate in tone. (&quot;A Fancie&quot; no 36). Like the five-and six-part consort fantasias, they sometimes feature a gradual increase in momentum after an imitative opening paragraph.

===Consort music===
The period up to 1591 also saw important additions to Byrd&#x27;s output of consort music, some of which have probably been lost. Two magnificent large-scale compositions are the &quot;Browning&quot;, a set of 20 variations on a popular melody (also known as &quot;The leaves be green&quot;) which evidently originated as a celebration of the ripening of nuts in autumn, and an elaborate ground on the formula known as the &quot;Goodnight Ground&quot;. The smaller-scale fantasias (those a3 and a4) use a light-textured imitative style which owes something to Continental models, while the five and six-part fantasias employ large-scale cumulative construction and allusions to snatches of popular songs. A good example of the last type is the &quot;Fantasia a6 (No 2)&quot; which begins with a sober imitative paragraph before progressively more fragmented textures (working in a quotation from &quot;Greensleeves&quot; at one point). It even includes a complete three-strain galliard, followed by an expansive coda (for a performance on YouTube, see under &#x27;External links&#x27; below). The single five-part fantasia, which is apparently an early work, includes a canon at the upper fourth.

===Masses===
Byrd now embarked on a programme to provide a cycle of liturgical music covering all the principal feasts of the Catholic Church calendar. The first stage in this undertaking comprised the three Ordinary of the Mass cycles (in four, three and five parts), which were published by Thomas East between 1592 and 1595. The editions are undated (dates can be established only by close bibliographic analysis), do not name the printer and consist of only one bifolium per partbook to aid concealment, reminders that the possession of heterodox books was still highly dangerous. All three works contain retrospective features harking back to the earlier Tudor tradition of Mass settings which had lapsed after 1558, along with others which reflect Continental influence and the liturgical practices of the foreign-trained incoming missionary priests. &quot;Mass for Four Voices&quot;, or the Four-Part Mass, which according to Joseph Kerman was probably the first to be composed, is partly modelled on John Taverner&#x27;s &quot;Mean Mass&quot;, a highly regarded early Tudor setting which Byrd would probably have sung as a choirboy. Taverner&#x27;s influence is particularly clear in the scale figures rising successively through a fifth, a sixth and a seventh in Byrd&#x27;s setting of the &quot;Sanctus&quot;.

All three Mass cycles employ other early Tudor features, notably the mosaic of semichoir sections alternating with full sections in the four-part and five-part Masses, the use of a semichoir section to open the &quot;Gloria&quot;, &quot;Credo&quot;, and &quot;Agnus Dei&quot;, and the head-motif which links the openings of all the movements of a cycle. However, all three cycles also include &quot;Kyrie&quot;s, a rare feature in Sarum Rite Mass settings, which usually omitted it because of the use of tropes on festal occasions in the Sarum Rite. The &quot;Kyrie&quot; of the three-part Mass is set in a simple litany-like style, but the other &quot;Kyrie&quot; settings employ dense imitative polyphony. A special feature of the four-part and five-part Masses is Byrd&#x27;s treatment of the &quot;Agnus Dei&quot;, which employ the technique which Byrd had previously applied to the petitionary clauses from the motets of the 1589 and 1591 &quot;Cantiones sacrae&quot;. The final words &quot;dona nobis pacem&quot; (&quot;grant us peace&quot;), which are set to chains of anguished suspensions in the Four-Part Mass and expressive block homophony in the five-part setting, almost certainly reflect the aspirations of the troubled Catholic community of the 1590s.

===Gradualia===
The second stage in Byrd&#x27;s programme of liturgical polyphony is formed by the &quot;Gradualia&quot;, two cycles of motets containing 109 items and published in 1605 and 1607. They are dedicated to two members of the Catholic nobility, Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton and Byrd&#x27;s own patron Sir John Petre, who had been elevated to the peerage in 1603 under the title Lord Petre of Writtle. The appearance of these two monumental collections of Catholic polyphony reflects the hopes which the recusant community must have harboured for an easier life under the new king James I, whose mother, Mary Queen of Scots, had been a Catholic. Addressing Petre (who is known to have lent him money to advance the printing of the collection), Byrd describes the contents of the 1607 set as &quot;blooms collected in your own garden and rightfully due to you as tithes&quot;, thus making explicit the fact that they had formed part of Catholic religious observances in the Petre household.

The greater part of the two collections consists of settings of the &quot;Proprium Missae&quot; for the major feasts of the church calendar, thus supplementing the Mass Ordinary cycles which Byrd had published in the 1590s. Normally, Byrd includes the &quot;Introit&quot;, the Gradual, the &quot;Alleluia&quot; (or Tract in Lent if needed), the Offertory and Communion. The feasts covered include the major feasts of the Virgin Mary (including the votive masses for the Virgin for the four seasons of the church year), All Saints and &quot;Corpus Christi&quot; (1605) followed by the feasts of the &quot;Temporale&quot; (Christmas, Epiphany, Easter, Ascension, Whitsun, and Feast of Saints Peter and Paul (with additional items for St Peter&#x27;s Chains and the Votive Mass of the Blessed Sacrament) in 1607. The verse of the &quot;Introit&quot; is normally set as a semichoir section, returning to full choir scoring for the &quot;Gloria Patri&quot;. Similar treatment applies to the Gradual verse, which is normally attached to the opening &quot;Alleluia&quot; to form a single item. The liturgy requires repeated settings of the word &quot;Alleluia&quot;, and Byrd provides a wide variety of different settings forming brilliantly conceived miniature fantasias which are one of the most striking features of the two sets. The &quot;Alleluia&quot; verse, together with the closing &quot;Alleluia&quot;, normally form an item in themselves, while the Offertory and the Communion are set as they stand.

In the Roman liturgy there are many texts which appear repeatedly in different liturgical contexts. To avoid having to set the same text twice, Byrd often resorted to a cross-reference or &quot;transfer&quot; system which allowed a single setting to be slotted into a different place in the liturgy. This practice sometimes causes confusion, partly because normally no rubrics are printed to make the required transfer clear and partly because there are some errors which complicate matters still further. A good example of the transfer system in operation is provided by the first motet from the 1605 set (&quot;Suscepimus Deus&quot; a5) in which the text used for the &quot;Introit&quot; has to be reused in a shortened form for the Gradual. Byrd provides a cadential break at the cut-off point.

The 1605 set also contains a number of miscellaneous items which fall outside the liturgical scheme of the main body of the set. As Philip Brett has pointed out, most of the items from the four- and three-part sections were taken from the Primer (the English name for the &quot;Book of hours&quot;), thus falling within the sphere of private devotions rather than public worship. These include, &quot;inter alia&quot;, settings of the four Marian antiphons from the Roman Rite, four Marian hymns set a3, a version of the Litany, the gem-like setting of the Eucharistic hymn &quot;Ave verum Corpus&quot;, and the &quot;Turbarum voces&quot; from the St John Passion, as well as a series of miscellaneous items.

In stylistic terms the motets of the &quot;Gradualia&quot; form a sharp contrast to those of the &quot;Cantiones sacrae&quot; publications. The vast majority are shorter, with the discursive imitative paragraphs of the earlier motets giving place to double phrases in which the counterpoint, though intricate and concentrated, assumes a secondary level of importance. Long imitative paragraphs are the exception, often kept for final climactic sections in the minority of extended motets. The melodic writing often breaks into quaver (eighth-note) motion, tending to undermine the minim (half-note) pulse with surface detail. Some of the more festive items, especially in the 1607 set, feature vivid madrigalesque word-painting. The Marian hymns from the 1605 &quot;Gradualia&quot; are set in a light line-by-line imitative counterpoint with crotchet pulse which recalls the three-part English songs from Songs of sundrie natures (1589). For obvious reasons, the &quot;Gradualia&quot; never achieved the popularity of Byrd&#x27;s earlier works. The 1607 set omits several texts, which were evidently too sensitive for publication in the light of the renewed anti-Catholic persecution which followed the failure of the Gunpowder Plot in 1605. A contemporary account which sheds light on the circulation of the music between Catholic country houses, refers to the arrest of a young Frenchman named Charles de Ligny, who was followed from an unidentified country house by spies, apprehended, searched and found to be carrying a copy of the 1605 set. Nevertheless, Byrd felt safe enough to reissue both sets with new title pages in 1610

===Psalms, songs and sonnets (1611)===
Byrd&#x27;s last collection of English songs was&quot; Psalms, Songs and Sonnets&quot;, published in 1611 (when Byrd was over 70) and dedicated to Francis Clifford, 4th Earl of Cumberland, who later also received the dedication of Thomas Campion&#x27;s&quot; First Book of Songs&quot; in about 1613. The layout of the set broadly follows the pattern of Byrd&#x27;s 1589 set, being laid out in sections for three, four, five and six parts like its predecessor and embracing an even wider miscellany of styles (perhaps reflecting the influence of another Jacobean publication, Michael East&#x27;s &quot;Third Set of Books&quot; (1610)). Byrd&#x27;s set includes two consort fantasias (a4 and a6) as well as eleven English motets, most of them setting prose texts from the Bible. These include some of his most famous compositions, notably &quot;Praise our Lord, all ye Gentiles&quot; (a6), &quot;This day Christ was born&quot; (a6) and &quot;Have mercy upon me&quot; (a6), which employs alternating phrases with verse and full scoring and was circulated as a church anthem. There are more carols set in verse and burden form as in the 1589 set as well as lighter three- and four-part songs in Byrd&#x27;s &quot;sonnets and pastorals&quot; style. Some items are, however, more tinged with madrigalian influence than their counterparts in the earlier set, making clear that the short-lived madrigal vogue of the 1590s had not completely passed Byrd by. Many of the songs follow, and develop further, types already established in the 1589 collection.

===Last works===
Byrd also contributed eight keyboard pieces to &quot;Parthenia&quot; (winter 1612–13), a collection of 21 keyboard pieces engraved by William Hole, and containing music by Byrd, John Bull and Orlando Gibbons. It was issued in celebration of the forthcoming marriage of James I&#x27;s daughter Princess Elizabeth to Frederick V, Elector Palatine, which took place on 14 February 1613. The three composers are nicely differentiated by seniority, with Byrd, Bull and Gibbons represented respectively by eight, seven and six items. Byrd&#x27;s contribution includes the famous &quot;Earle of Salisbury Pavan&quot;, composed in memory of Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, who had died on 24 May 1612, and its two accompanying galliards. Byrd&#x27;s last published compositions are four English anthems printed in Sir William Leighton&#x27;s &quot;Teares or Lamentacions of a Sorrowfull Soule&quot; (1614).

==Legacy==
Byrd&#x27;s output of about 470 compositions amply justifies his reputation as one of the great masters of European Renaissance music. Perhaps his most impressive achievement as a composer was his ability to transform so many of the main musical forms of his day and stamp them with his own identity. Having grown up in an age in which Latin polyphony was largely confined to liturgical items for the Sarum rite, he assimilated and mastered the Continental motet form of his day, employing a highly personal synthesis of English and continental models. He virtually created the Tudor consort and keyboard fantasia, having only the most primitive models to follow. He also raised the consort song, the church anthem and the Anglican service setting to new heights. Finally, despite a general aversion to the madrigal, he succeeded in cultivating secular vocal music in an impressive variety of forms in his three sets of 1588, 1589 and 1611.

Byrd enjoyed a high reputation among English musicians. As early as 1575 Richard Mulcaster and Ferdinand Haybourne praised Byrd, together with Tallis, in poems published in the Tallis/Byrd &quot;Cantiones&quot;. Despite the financial failure of the publication, some of his other collections sold well, while Elizabethan scribes such as the Oxford academic Robert Dow, Baldwin, and a school of scribes working for the Norfolk country gentleman Sir Edward Paston copied his music extensively. Dow included Latin distichs and quotations in praise of Byrd in his manuscript collection of music, the Dow Partbooks (GB Och 984–988), while Baldwin included a long doggerel poem in his Commonplace Book (GB Lbm Roy App 24 d 2) ranking Byrd at the head of the musicians of his day:

:Yet let not straingers bragg, nor they these soe commende,
:For they may now geve place and sett themselves behynde,
:An Englishman, by name, William BIRDE for his skill
:Which I shoulde heve sett first, for soe it was my will,
:Whose greater skill and knowledge dothe excelle all at this time
:And far to strange countries abrode his skill dothe shyne...

In 1597 Byrd&#x27;s pupil Thomas Morley dedicated his treatise &quot;A Plaine and Easie Introduction to Practicall Musicke&quot; to Byrd in flattering terms, though he may have intended to counterbalance this in the main text by some sharply satirical references to a mysterious &quot;Master Bold&quot;. In &quot;The Compleat Gentleman&quot; (1622) Henry Peacham (1576–1643) praised Byrd in lavish terms as a composer of sacred music:

:&quot;For Motets and musick of piety and devotion, as well as for the honour of our Nation, as the merit of the man, I prefer above all our Phoenix M[aster] William Byrd, whom in that kind, I know not whether any may equall, I am sure none excel, even by the judgement of France and Italy, who are very sparing in the commendation of strangers, in regard of that conceipt they hold of themselves. His Cantiones Sacrae, as also his Gradualia, are mere Angelicall and Divine; and being of himself naturally disposed to Gravity and Piety, his vein is not so much for leight Madrigals or Canzonets, yet his Virginella and some others in his first Set, cannot be mended by the best Italian of them all.&quot;

Finally, and most intriguingly, it has been suggested that a reference to &quot;the bird of loudest lay&quot; in Shakespeare&#x27;s mysterious allegorical poem &quot;The Phoenix and the Turtle&quot; may be to the composer. The poem as a whole has been interpreted as an elegy for the Catholic martyr St Anne Line, who was executed at Tyburn on 27 February 1601 for harbouring priests.

Byrd was an active and influential teacher. As well as Morley, his pupils included Peter Philips, Tomkins and probably Thomas Weelkes, the first two of whom were important contributors to the Elizabethan and Jacobean virginalist school. However, by the time Byrd died in 1623 the English musical landscape was undergoing profound changes. The principal virginalist composers died off in the 1620s (except for Giles Farnaby, who died in 1640, and Thomas Tomkins, who lived on until 1656) and found no real successors. Thomas Morley, Byrd&#x27;s other major composing pupil, devoted himself to the cultivation of the madrigal, a form in which Byrd himself took little interest. The native tradition of Latin music which Byrd had done so much to keep alive more or less died with him, while consort music underwent a huge change of character at the hands of a brilliant new generation of professional musicians at the Jacobean and Caroline courts. The English Civil War, and the change of taste brought about by the Stuart Restoration, created a cultural hiatus which adversely affected the cultivation of Byrd&#x27;s music together with that of Tudor composers in general.

In a small way, it was his Anglican church music which came closest to establishing a continuous tradition, at least in the sense that some of it continued to be performed in choral foundations after the Restoration and into the eighteenth century. Byrd&#x27;s exceptionally long lifespan meant that he lived into an age in which many of the forms of vocal and instrumental music which he had made his own were beginning to lose their appeal to most musicians. Despite the efforts of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century antiquarians, the reversal of this judgement had to wait for the pioneering work of twentieth-century scholars from E. H. Fellowes onwards.

In more recent times, Joseph Kerman, Oliver Neighbour, Philip Brett, John Harley, Richard Turbet, Alan Brown, Kerry McCarthy, and others have made major contributions to increasing our understanding of Byrd&#x27;s life and music. In 1999, Davitt Moroney&#x27;s recording of Byrd&#x27;s complete keyboard music was released on Hyperion (CDA66551/7; re-issued as CDS44461/7). This recording, which won the 2000 Gramophone Award in the Early Music category and a 2000 Jahrespreis der deutschen Schallplattenkritik, came with a 100-page essay by Moroney on Byrd&#x27;s keyboard music. In 2010, The Cardinall&#x27;s Musick, under the direction of Andrew Carwood, completed their recorded survey of Byrd&#x27;s Latin church music. This series of thirteen recordings marks the first time that all of Byrd&#x27;s Latin music has been available on disc.

<text>Erich Seligmann Fromm (; ; March 23, 1900 – March 18, 1980) was a German-American social psychologist, psychoanalyst, sociologist, humanistic philosopher, and democratic socialist. He was a German Jew who fled the Nazi regime and settled in the United States. He was one of the founders of The William Alanson White Institute of Psychiatry, Psychoanalysis and Psychology in New York City and was associated with the Frankfurt School of critical theory.

==Life==
Erich Fromm was born on March 23, 1900, at Frankfurt am Main, the only child of Rosa (Krause) and Naphtali Fromm. He started his academic studies in 1918 at the University of Frankfurt am Main with two semesters of jurisprudence. During the summer semester of 1919, Fromm studied at the University of Heidelberg, where he began studying sociology under Alfred Weber (brother of sociologist Max Weber), psychiatrist-philosopher Karl Jaspers, and Heinrich Rickert. Fromm received his Ph.D. in sociology from Heidelberg in 1922 with a dissertation &quot;On Jewish Law&quot;.

Fromm at the time became strongly involved in Zionism, under the influence of the religious Zionist rabbi Nehemia Anton Nobel. He was very active in Jewish &quot;Studentenverbindungen&quot; and other Zionist organisations.
But he soon turned away from Zionism, saying that it conflicted with his ideal of a &quot;universalist Messianism and Humanism&quot;.

During the mid-1920s, he trained to become a psychoanalyst through Frieda Reichmann&#x27;s psychoanalytic sanatorium in Heidelberg. They married in 1926, but separated shortly after and divorced in 1942. He began his own clinical practice in 1927. In 1930 he joined the Frankfurt Institute for Social Research and completed his psychoanalytical training.

After the Nazi takeover of power in Germany, Fromm moved first to Geneva and then, in 1934, to Columbia University in New York. Together with Karen Horney and Harry Stack Sullivan, Fromm belongs to a Neo-Freudian school of psychoanalytical thought. Horney and Fromm each had a marked influence on the other&#x27;s thought, with Horney illuminating some aspects of psychoanalysis for Fromm and the latter elucidating sociology for Horney. Their relationship ended in the late 1930s. After leaving Columbia, Fromm helped form the New York branch of the Washington School of Psychiatry in 1943, and in 1946 co-founded the William Alanson White Institute of Psychiatry, Psychoanalysis, and Psychology. He was on the faculty of Bennington College from 1941 to 1949, and taught courses at the New School for Social Research in New York from 1941 to 1959.

When Fromm moved to Mexico City in 1949, he became a professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and established a psychoanalytic section at the medical school there. Meanwhile, he taught as a professor of psychology at Michigan State University from 1957 to 1961 and as an adjunct professor of psychology at the graduate division of Arts and Sciences at New York University after 1962. He taught at UNAM until his retirement, in 1965, and at the Mexican Society of Psychoanalysis (SMP) until 1974. In 1974, he moved from Mexico City to Muralto, Switzerland, and died at his home in 1980, five days before his eightieth birthday. All the while, Fromm maintained his own clinical practice and published a series of books.

Fromm was reportedly an atheist but described his position as &quot;nontheistic mysticism&quot;.

==Psychological theory==
Beginning with his first work of 1941, &quot;Escape from Freedom&quot; (known in Britain as &quot;The Fear of Freedom&quot;), Fromm&#x27;s writings were notable as much for their social and political commentary as for their philosophical and psychological underpinnings. Indeed, &quot;Escape from Freedom&quot; is viewed as one of the founding works of political psychology. His second important work, &quot;Man for Himself: An Inquiry into the Psychology of Ethics&quot;, first published in 1947, continued and enriched the ideas of &quot;Escape from Freedom&quot;. Taken together, these books outlined Fromm&#x27;s theory of human character, which was a natural outgrowth of Fromm&#x27;s theory of human nature. Fromm&#x27;s most popular book was &quot;The Art of Loving&quot;, an international bestseller first published in 1956, which recapitulated and complemented the theoretical principles of human nature found in &quot;Escape from Freedom&quot; and &quot;Man for Himself&quot;—principles which were revisited in many of Fromm&#x27;s other major works.

Central to Fromm&#x27;s world view was his interpretation of the Talmud and Hasidism. He began studying Talmud as a young man under Rabbi J. Horowitz and later under Rabbi Salman Baruch Rabinkow, a Chabad Hasid. While working towards his doctorate in sociology at the University of Heidelberg, Fromm studied the Tanya by the founder of Chabad, Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi. Fromm also studied under Nehemia Nobel and Ludwig Krause while studying in Frankfurt. Fromm&#x27;s grandfather and two great-grandfathers on his father&#x27;s side were rabbis, and a great uncle on his mother&#x27;s side was a noted Talmudic scholar. However, Fromm turned away from orthodox Judaism in 1926, towards secular interpretations of scriptural ideals.

The cornerstone of Fromm&#x27;s humanistic philosophy is his interpretation of the biblical story of Adam and Eve&#x27;s exile from the Garden of Eden. Drawing on his knowledge of the Talmud, Fromm pointed out that being able to distinguish between good and evil is generally considered to be a virtue, but that biblical scholars generally consider Adam and Eve to have &quot;sinned&quot; by disobeying God and eating from the Tree of Knowledge. However, departing from traditional religious orthodoxy on this, Fromm &quot;extolled&quot; the virtues of humans taking independent action and using reason to establish moral values rather than adhering to authoritarian moral values.

Beyond a simple condemnation of authoritarian value systems, Fromm used the story of Adam and Eve as an allegorical explanation for human biological evolution and existential angst, asserting that when Adam and Eve ate from the Tree of Knowledge, they became aware of themselves as being separate from nature while still being part of it. This is why they felt &quot;naked&quot; and &quot;ashamed&quot;: they had evolved into human beings, conscious of themselves, their own mortality, and their powerlessness before the forces of nature and society, and no longer united with the universe as they were in their instinctive, pre-human existence as animals. According to Fromm, the awareness of a disunited human existence is a source of guilt and shame, and the solution to this existential dichotomy is found in the development of one&#x27;s uniquely human powers of love and reason. However, Fromm distinguished &quot;his&quot; concept of love from unreflective &quot;popular&quot; notions as well as &quot;Freudian paradoxical&quot; love (see the criticism by Marcuse below).

Fromm considered love an interpersonal creative capacity rather than an emotion, and he distinguished this creative capacity from what he considered to be various forms of narcissistic neuroses and sado-masochistic tendencies that are commonly held out as proof of &quot;true love&quot;. Indeed, Fromm viewed the experience of &quot;falling in love&quot; as evidence of one&#x27;s failure to understand the true nature of love, which he believed always had the common elements of &quot;care&quot;, &quot;responsibility&quot;, &quot;respect&quot;, and &quot;knowledge&quot;. Drawing from his knowledge of the Torah, Fromm pointed to the story of Jonah, who did not wish to save the residents of Nineveh from the consequences of their sin, as demonstrative of his belief that the qualities of &quot;care&quot; and &quot;responsibility&quot; are generally absent from most human relationships. Fromm also asserted that few people in modern society had &quot;respect&quot; for the autonomy of their fellow human beings, much less the objective &quot;knowledge&quot; of what other people truly wanted and needed.

Fromm believed that freedom was an aspect of human nature that we either embrace or escape. He observed that embracing our freedom of will was healthy, whereas escaping freedom through the use of escape mechanisms was the root of psychological conflicts. Fromm outlined three of the most common escape mechanisms:
*&quot;Automaton conformity&quot;: changing one&#x27;s ideal self to conform to a perception of society&#x27;s preferred type of personality, losing one&#x27;s true self in the process; &quot;Automaton conformity&quot; displaces the burden of choice from self to society;
*&quot;Authoritarianism&quot;: giving control of oneself to another. By submitting one&#x27;s freedom to someone else, this act removes the freedom of choice almost entirely.
*&quot;Destructiveness&quot;: any process which attempts to eliminate others or the world as a whole, all to escape freedom. Fromm said that &quot;the destruction of the world is the last, almost desperate attempt to save myself from being crushed by it&quot;.

The word biophilia was frequently used by Fromm as a description of a productive psychological orientation and &quot;state of being&quot;. For example, in an addendum to his book &quot;The Heart of Man: Its Genius For Good and Evil&quot;, Fromm wrote as part of his humanist credo:

&quot;I believe that the man choosing progress can find a new unity through the development of all his human forces, which are produced in three orientations. These can be presented separately or together: biophilia, love for humanity and nature, and independence and freedom.&quot;

Erich Fromm postulated the following basic needs:

Fromm&#x27;s thesis of the &quot;escape from freedom&quot; is epitomized in the following passage. The &quot;individualized man&quot; referenced by Fromm is man bereft of the &quot;primary ties&quot; of belonging (such as nature, family, etc.), also expressed as &quot;freedom from&quot;:

===Five basic orientations===
In his book &quot;Man for Himself&quot;, Fromm spoke of &quot;orientation of character&quot;. He differentiates his theory of character from that of Freud by focusing on two ways an individual relates to the world. Freud analyzed character in terms of libido organization, whereas Fromm says that in the process of living, we relate to the world by: 1) acquiring and assimilating things—&quot;Assimilation&quot;, and 2) reacting to people—&quot;Socialization&quot;. Fromm asserted that these two ways of relating to the world were not instinctive, but an individual&#x27;s response to the peculiar circumstances of his or her life; he also believed that people are never exclusively one type of orientation. These two ways of relating to life&#x27;s circumstances lead to basic character-orientations.

Fromm lists four types of nonproductive character orientation, which he called receptive, exploitative, hoarding, and marketing, and one positive character orientation, which he called productive. Receptive and exploitative orientations are basically how an individual may relate to other people and are socialization attributes of character. A hoarding orientation is an acquiring and assimilating materials/valuables character trait. The marketing orientation arises in response to the human situation in the modern era. The current needs of the market determine value. It is a relativistic ethic. In contrast, the productive orientation is an objective ethic. Despite the existential struggles of humanity, each human has the potential for love, reason and productive work in life. Fromm writes, &quot;It is the paradox of human existence that man must simultaneously seek for closeness and for independence; for oneness with others and at the same time for the preservation of his uniqueness and particularity. ...the answer to this paradox – and to the moral problems of man – is productiveness.&quot;

===Fromm&#x27;s influence on other notable psychologists===
Fromm&#x27;s four non-productive orientations were subject to validation through a psychometric test, &quot;The Person Relatedness Test&quot; by Elias H. Porter, PhD in collaboration with Carl Rogers, PhD at the University of Chicago&#x27;s Counseling Center between 1953 and 1955. Fromm&#x27;s four non-productive orientations also served as basis for the &quot;LIFO&quot; test, first published in 1967 by Stuart Atkins, Alan Katcher, PhD, and Elias Porter, PhD and the &quot;Strength Deployment Inventory&quot;, first published in 1971 by Elias H. Porter, PhD. Fromm also influenced his student Sally L. Smith who went on to become the founder of the Lab School of Washington and the Baltimore Lab School.

==Critique of Freud==
Fromm examined the life and work of Sigmund Freud at length. He identified a discrepancy between early and later Freudian theory: namely that, prior to World War I, Freud had described human drives as a tension between desire and repression, but after the end of the war, began framing human drives as a struggle between biologically universal Life and Death (Eros and Thanatos) instincts. Fromm charged Freud and his followers with never acknowledging the contradictions between the two theories.

Fromm also criticized Freud&#x27;s dualistic thinking. According to Fromm, Freudian descriptions of human consciousness as struggles between two poles were narrow and limiting. Fromm also condemned Freud as a misogynist unable to think outside the patriarchal milieu of early 20th century Vienna. However, in spite of these criticisms, Fromm nonetheless expressed a great respect for Freud and his accomplishments. Fromm contended that Freud was one of the &quot;architects of the modern age&quot;, alongside Albert Einstein and Karl Marx, but emphasized that he considered Marx both far more historically important than Freud and a finer thinker.

==Political ideas and activities==
Fromm&#x27;s best known work, &quot;Escape from Freedom&quot;, focuses on the human urge to seek a source of authority and control upon reaching a freedom that was thought to be an individual&#x27;s true desire. Fromm&#x27;s critique of the modern political order and capitalist system led him to seek insights from medieval feudalism. In &quot;Escape from Freedom&quot;, he found value in the lack of individual freedom, rigid structure, and obligations required on the members of medieval society:

The culmination of Fromm&#x27;s social and political philosophy was his book The Sane Society, published in 1955, which argued in favor of a humanistic and democratic socialism. Building primarily upon the early works of Karl Marx, Fromm sought to re-emphasise the ideal of freedom, missing from most Soviet Marxism and more frequently found in the writings of libertarian socialists and liberal theoreticians. Fromm&#x27;s brand of socialism rejected both Western capitalism and Soviet communism, which he saw as dehumanizing, and which resulted in the virtually universal modern phenomenon of alienation. He became one of the founders of socialist humanism, promoting the early writings of Marx and his humanist messages to the US and Western European public. He engaged with a Christian-Marxist intellectual dialogue group organized by Milan Machovec and others in 1960s Communist Czechoslovakia.

In the early 1960s, Fromm published two books dealing with Marxist thought (&quot;Marx&#x27;s Concept of Man&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Chains of Illusion: My Encounter with Marx and Freud&quot;). In 1965, working to stimulate the Western and Eastern cooperation between Marxist humanists, Fromm published a series of articles entitled &quot;Socialist Humanism: An International Symposium&quot;. In 1966, the American Humanist Association named him Humanist of the Year.

For a period, Fromm was also active in U.S. politics. He joined the Socialist Party of America in the mid-1950s, and did his best to help them provide an alternative viewpoint to McCarthyist trends in some US political thought. This alternative viewpoint was best expressed in his 1961 paper &quot;May Man Prevail? An Inquiry into the Facts and Fictions of Foreign Policy&quot;. However, as a co-founder of SANE, Fromm&#x27;s strongest political activism was in the international peace movement, fighting against the nuclear arms race and U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. After supporting Senator Eugene McCarthy&#x27;s losing bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, Fromm more or less retreated from the American political scene, although he did write a paper in 1974 entitled &quot;Remarks on the Policy of Détente&quot; for a hearing held by the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. Fromm was awarded the Nelly Sachs Prize in 1979.

==Criticism==
In &quot;Eros and Civilization&quot;, Herbert Marcuse is critical of Fromm: In the beginning, he was a radical theorist, but later he turned to conformity. Marcuse also noted that Fromm, as well as his close colleagues Sullivan and Karen Horney, removed Freud&#x27;s libido theory and other radical concepts, which thus reduced psychoanalysis to a set of idealist ethics, which only embrace the status quo. Fromm&#x27;s response, in both &quot;The Sane Society&quot; and in &quot;The Anatomy of Human Destructiveness&quot;, argues that Freud indeed deserves substantial credit for recognizing the central importance of the unconscious, but also that he tended to reify his own concepts that depicted the self as the passive outcome of instinct and social control, with minimal volition or variability. Fromm argues that later scholars such as Marcuse accepted these concepts as dogma, whereas social psychology requires a more dynamic theoretical and empirical approach. In reference to Fromm&#x27;s leftist political activism as a public intellectual, Noam Chomsky said &quot;I liked Fromm&#x27;s attitudes but thought his work was pretty superficial&quot;.

<doc id="45344" wikidata="Q1195184" url="?curid=45344" title="Hash collision">
<text>In computer science, a hash collision or hash clash is when two distinct pieces of data in a hash table share the same hash value. The hash value in this case is derived from a hash function which takes a data input and returns a fixed length of bits.

Although hash algorithms, especially cryptographic hash algorithms, have been created with the intent of being collision resistant, they can still sometimes map different data to the same hash (by virtue of the pigeonhole principle). Malicious users can take advantage of this to mimic, access, or alter data.

Due to the possible negative applications of hash collisions in data management and computer security (in particular, cryptographic hash functions), collision avoidance has become an important topic in computer security.

== Background ==
Hash collisions can be unavoidable depending on the number of objects in a set and whether or not the bit string they are mapped to is long enough in length. When there is a set of &quot;n&quot; objects, if &quot;n&quot; is greater than |&quot;R&quot;|, which in this case &quot;R&quot; is the range of the hash value, the probability that there will be a hash collision is 1, meaning it is guaranteed to occur.

Another reason hash collisions are likely at some point in time stems from the idea of the birthday paradox in mathematics. This problem looks at the probability of a set of two randomly chosen people having the same birthday out of &quot;n&quot; number of people. This idea has led to what has been called the birthday attack. The premise of this attack is that it is difficult to find a birthday that specifically matches your birthday or a specific birthday, but the probability of finding a set of &quot;any&quot; two people with matching birthdays increases the probability greatly. Bad actors can use this approach to make it simpler for them to find hash values that collide with any other hash value – rather than searching for a specific value.

The impact of collisions depends on the application. When hash functions and fingerprints are used to identify similar data, such as homologous DNA sequences or similar audio files, the functions are designed so as to &quot;maximize&quot; the probability of collision between distinct but similar data, using techniques like locality-sensitive hashing. Checksums, on the other hand, are designed to minimize the probability of collisions between similar inputs, without regard for collisions between very different inputs. Instances where bad actors attempt to create or find hash collisions are known as collision attacks.

In practice, security-related applications use cryptographic hash algorithms, which are designed to be long enough for random matches to be unlikely, fast enough that they can be used anywhere, and safe enough that it would be extremely hard to find collisions.

== Collision resolution ==
In hash tables, since hash collisions are inevitable, hash tables have mechanisms of dealing with them, known as collision resolutions. Two of the most common strategies are open addressing and separate chaining. The cache-conscious collision resolution is another strategy that has been discussed in the past for string hash tables.

=== Open addressing ===
Cells in the hash table are assigned one of three states in this method – occupied, empty, or deleted. If a hash collision occurs, the table will be probed to move the record to an alternate cell that is stated as empty. There are different types of probing that take place when a hash collision happens and this method is implemented. Some types of probing are linear probing, double hashing, and quadratic probing. Open Addressing is also known as closed hashing.

=== Separate chaining ===
This strategy allows more than one record to be &quot;chained&quot; to the cells of a hash table. If two records are being directed to the same cell, both would go into that cell as a linked list. This efficiently prevents a hash collision from occurring since records with the same hash values can go into the same cell, but it has its disadvantages. Keeping track of so many lists is difficult and can cause whatever tool that is being used to become very slow. Separate chaining is also known as open hashing.

=== Cache-conscious collision resolution ===

Although much less used than the previous two, has proposed the cache-conscious collision resolution method in 2005. It is a similar idea to the separate chaining methods, although it does not technically involve the chained lists. In this case, instead of chained lists, the hash values are represented in a contiguous list of items. This is better suited for string hash tables and the use for numeric values is still unknown.

<doc id="45345" wikidata="Q172377" url="?curid=45345" title="Pope Hilarius">
<text>Pope Hilarius (also Hilarus, Hilary; died 29 February 468) was the bishop of Rome from 461 to 468.

In 449, Hilarius served as a legate for Pope Leo I at the Second Council of Ephesus. His opposition to the condemnation of Flavian of Constantinople incurred the enmity of Dioscurus of Alexandria, who attempted to prevent him from leaving the city. Hilarius was able to make his escape and returned to Rome by an indirect route. He later erected an oratory at the Lateran in honor of John the Evangelist, to whom he attributed his safe passage.

Much of his pontificate was spent in maintaining ecclesiastical discipline in conformity with canon law, and in settling jurisdictional disputes among the bishops of both Gaul and Spain.

==Early career==
Hilarius was born in Sardinia. As archdeacon under Pope Leo I, he fought vigorously for the rights of the Roman See.

In 449, Hilarius and Bishop Julius of Puteoli served as papal legates to the Second Council of Ephesus. Pope Leo had sent a letter with the legates to be read at the council. However, the head notary declared that the emperor&#x27;s letter should be read first and as the Council proceeded, Leo&#x27;s letter ended up not being read at all. Hilarius vigorously opposed the condemnation of Flavian of Constantinople, pronouncing the single word in Latin, &quot;Contradicitur&quot;, annulling the sentence in Leo&#x27;s name.

For this he incurred the displeasure of Pope Dioscorus I of Alexandria, who presided over the synod. Flavian died shortly afterwards, on 11 August 449, from injuries incurred from a physical assault by the followers of Dioscurus. According to a letter to Empress Pulcheria collected among the letters of Leo I, Hilarius apologized for not delivering to her the pope&#x27;s letter after the synod, but owing to Dioscurus of Alexandria, who tried to hinder his going either to Rome or to Constantinople by having Ephesus&#x27; roads and docks watched, he had great difficulty in making his escape in order to bring to the pontiff the news of the result of the council. Flavian and Eusebius of Dorylaeum appealed to the pope, and their letters were probably taken by Hilarus to Rome.

==Papacy==

As pope, he continued the policy of his predecessor, Leo I, who, in his contest with Hilary of Arles, had obtained from Emperor Valentinian III a famous rescript of 444 (called &quot;Novel 17)&quot; confirming the supremacy of the bishop of Rome. Hilarius continued to strengthen ecclesiastical government in Gaul and Spain. 

In Rome, Hilarius worked zealously to counter the new emperor&#x27;s 467 edict of toleration for schismatic sects, which had been inspired, according to a letter of Pope Gelasius I, by a favourite of Emperor Anthemius named Philotheus, who espoused the Macedonian heresy. On one of the emperor&#x27;s visits to St Peter&#x27;s Basilica, the pope openly called him to account for his favourite&#x27;s conduct, exhorting him by the grave of St Peter to promise that he would allow no schismatical assemblies in Rome.

===Ecclesiastical disputes===
Hermes, a former archdeacon of Narbonne, had illegally acquired the bishopric of that town. Two Gallican prelates were dispatched to Rome to lay before the pope this and other matters concerning the Church in Gaul. A Roman synod held on 19 November, 462, passed judgment upon these matters. Hilarius sent an Encyclical advising the provincial bishops of Vienne, Lyons, Narbonne, and the Alps that Hermes was to remain titular bishop of Narbonne, but his episcopal faculties were withheld.

Other decisions expressed in an encyclical were in the interests of increased discipline. A synod was to be convened yearly by the bishop of Arles, but all important matters were to be submitted to the Apostolic See. No bishop could leave his diocese without a written permission from his metropolitan, with a right of appeal to the Bishop of Arles. Respecting the parishes (&quot;paroeciae&quot;) claimed by Bishop Leontius of Arles as belonging to his jurisdiction, the Gallican bishops could decide, after an investigation. Church property could not be alienated until a synod had looked into the purpose of the sale.

Shortly after this, the pope found himself involved in another diocesan quarrel. In 463, Mamertus of Vienne had consecrated a bishop of Die, although this Church, by a decree of Leo I, belonged to the metropolitan Diocese of Arles. When Hilarius heard of it, he deputed Leontius of Arles to summon a great synod of the bishops of several provinces to investigate the matter. The synod took place and, on the strength of the report given him by Bishop Antonius, he issued an edict dated 25 February 464 in which Bishop Veranus was commissioned to warn Mamertus that, if in the future he did not refrain from irregular ordinations, his faculties would be withdrawn. Consequently, the consecration of the Bishop of Die would be sanctioned by Leontius of Arles. Thus the primatial privileges of the See of Arles were upheld as Leo I had defined them. At the same time, the bishops were admonished not to overstep their boundaries and to assemble in a yearly synod presided over by the Bishop of Arles. The metropolitan rights of the See of Embrun over the dioceses of the Maritime Alps were protected against the encroachments of a certain Bishop Auxanius, particularly in connection with the two Churches of Nice and Cimiez.

Hilarius gave decisions to the churches of Hispania, which tended to operate outside the papal orbit in the 5th century. Bishop Silvanus of Calahorra had violated the church laws by his episcopal ordinations, and the pope was asked for his decision. Before an answer came to their petition, the same bishops had recourse to the Holy See for an entirely different matter. Before his death, Nundinarius, Bishop of Barcelona, expressed a wish that Irenaeus might be chosen his successor, and he himself had made Irenaeus bishop of another See. The request was granted and the Synod of Tarragona confirmed the nomination of Irenaeus, after which the bishops sought the pope&#x27;s approval. The Roman synod of 19 November 465, held in the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore, which decided that Irenaeus, the nominated bishop, should quit the see of Barcelona and return to his former one, while the Spanish bishops were directed to condone the acts of Silvanus. This is the oldest Roman synod whose original records have survived.

===Construction projects===
Hilarius erected several churches and other buildings in Rome, for which the &quot;Liber Pontificalis,&quot; the main source for information about Hilarius, praises him. He also erected a chapel of the Holy Cross in the baptistery, convents, two public baths, and libraries near the Basilica of St. Lawrence outside the Walls. He built two oratories in the baptistery of the Lateran, one in honor of John the Baptist, the other of John the Apostle, to whom he attributed his safe escape from the Council of Ephesus, thus satisfying the question as to which saints the Lateran had been dedicated.

==Death==
Hilarius died on 29 February 468 and was buried in Basilica of St. Lawrence outside the Walls. His feast day is celebrated on 17 November in the Roman Catholic Church and 28 February in the Eastern Orthodox Church.

<text>Planning theory is the body of scientific concepts, definitions, behavioral relationships, and assumptions that define the body of knowledge of urban planning. There is no one unified planning theory but various. Whittemore identifies nine procedural theories that dominated the field between 1959 and 1983: the Rational-Comprehensive approach, the Incremental approach, the Transformative Incremental (TI) approach, the Transactive approach, the Communicative approach, the Advocacy approach, the Equity approach, the Radical approach, and the Humanist or Phenomenological approach.

==Background==
Urban planning can include urban renewal, by adapting urban planning methods to existing cities suffering from decline. Alternatively, it can concern the massive challenges associated with urban growth, particularly in the Global South. All in all, urban planning exists in various forms and addresses many different issues. The modern origins of urban planning lie in the movement for urban reform that arose as a reaction against the disorder of the industrial city in the mid-19th century. Many of the early influencers were inspired by anarchism, which was popular in the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. The new imagined urban form was meant to go hand-in-hand with a new society, based upon voluntary co-operation within self-governing communities.

In the late 20th century, the term sustainable development has come to represent an ideal outcome in the sum of all planning goals. Sustainable architecture involves renewable materials and energy sources and is increasing in importance as an environmentally friendly solution

== Blueprint planning ==

Since at least the Renaissance and the Age of Enlightenment, urban planning had generally been assumed to be the physical planning and design of human communities. Therefore, it was seen as related to architecture and civil engineering, and thereby to be carried out by such experts. This kind of planning was physicalist and design-orientated, and involved the production of masterplans and blueprints which would show precisely what the &#x27;end-state&#x27; of land use should be, similar to architectural and engineering plans. Similarly, the theory of urban planning was mainly interested in visionary planning and design which would demonstrate how the ideal city should be organised spatially.

=== Sanitary movement ===
Although it can be seen as an extension of the sort of civic pragmatism seen in Oglethorpe&#x27;s plan for Savannah or William Penn&#x27;s plan for Philadelphia, the roots of the rational planning movement lie in Britain&#x27;s Sanitary movement (1800–1890). During this period, advocates such as Charles Booth argued for central organized, top-down solutions to the problems of industrializing cities. In keeping with the rising power of industry, the source of the planning authority in the Sanitary movement included both traditional governmental offices and private development corporations. In London and its surrounding suburbs, cooperation between these two entities created a network of new communities clustered around the expanding rail system.

=== Garden city movement ===

The Garden city movement was founded by Ebenezer Howard (1850-1928). His ideas were expressed in the book Garden Cities of To-morrow (1898). His influences included Benjamin Walter Richardson, who had published a pamphlet in 1876 calling for low population density, good housing, wide roads, an underground railway and for open space; Thomas Spence who had supported common ownership of land and the sharing of the rents it would produce; Edward Gibbon Wakefield who had pioneered the idea of colonizing planned communities to house the poor in Adelaide (including starting new cities separated by green belts at a certain point); James Silk Buckingham who had designed a model town with a central place, radial avenues and industry in the periphery; as well as Alfred Marshall, Peter Kropotkin and the back-to-the-land movement, which had all called for the moving of masses to the countryside.

Howards&#x27; vision was to combine the best of both the countryside and the city in a new environment called Town-Country. To make this happen, a group of individuals would establish a limited-dividend company to buy cheap agricultural land, which would then be developed with investment from manufacturers and housing for the workers. No more than 32,000 people would be housed in a settlement, spread over 1,000 acres. Around it would be a permanent green belt of 5,000 acres, with farms and institutions (such as mental institutions) which would benefit from the location. After reaching the limit, a new settlement would be started, connected by an inter-city rail, with the polycentric settlements together forming the &quot;Social City&quot;. The lands of the settlements would be jointly owned by the inhabitants, who would use rents received from it to pay off the mortgage necessary to buy the land and then invest the rest in the community through social security. Actual garden cities were built by Howard in Letchworth, Brentham Garden Suburb, and Welwyn Garden City. The movement would also inspire the later New towns movement.

=== Linear city ===

Arturo Soria y Mata&#x27;s idea of the Linear city (1882) replaced the traditional idea of the city as a centre and a periphery with the idea of constructing linear sections of infrastructure - roads, railways, gas, water, etc.- along an optimal line and then attaching the other components of the city along the length of this line. As compared to the concentric diagrams of Ebenezer Howard and other in the same period, Soria&#x27;s linear city creates the infrastructure for a controlled process of expansion that joins one growing city to the next in a rational way, instead of letting them both sprawl. The linear city was meant to ‘ruralize the city and urbanize the countryside’, and to be universally applicable as a ring around existing cities, as a strip connecting two cities, or as an entirely new linear town across an unurbanized region. The idea was later taken up by Nikolay Alexandrovich Milyutin in the planning circles of the 1920s Soviet Union. The Ciudad Lineal was a practical application of the concept.

=== Regional planning movement ===

Patrick Geddes (1864-1932) was the founder of regional planning. His main influences were the geographers Élisée Reclus and Paul Vidal de La Blache, as well as the sociologist Pierre Guillaume Frédéric le Play. From these he received the idea of the natural region. According to Geddes, planning must start by surveying such a region by crafting a &quot;Valley Section&quot; which shows the general slope from mountains to the sea that can be identified across scale and place in the world, with the natural environment and the cultural environments produced by it included. This was encapsulated in the motto &quot;Survey before Plan&quot;. He saw cities as being changed by technology into more regional settlements, for which he coined the term &quot;conurbation&quot;. Similar to the garden city movement, he also believed in adding green areas to these urban regions. The Regional Planning Association of America advanced his ideas, coming up with the &#x27;regional city&#x27; which would have a variety of urban communities across a green landscape of farms, parks and wilderness with the help of telecommunication and the automobile. This had major influence on the County of London Plan, 1944.

=== City Beautiful movement ===

The City Beautiful movement was inspired by 19th century European capital cities such as Georges-Eugène Haussmann&#x27;s Paris or the Vienna Ring Road. An influential figure was Daniel Burnham (1846-1912), who was the chief of construction of the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in 1893. Urban problems such as the 1886 Haymarket affair in Chicago had created a perceived need to reform the morality of the city among some of the elites. Burnham&#x27;s greatest achievement was the Chicago plan of 1909. His aim was &quot;to restore to the city a lost visual and aesthetic harmony, thereby creating the physical prerequisite for the emergence of a harmonious social order&quot;, essentially creating social reform through new slum clearance and creating public space, which also endeared it the support of the Progressivist movement. This was also believed to be economically advantageous by drawing in tourists and wealthy migrants. Because of this it has been referred to as &quot;trickle-down urban development&quot; and as &quot;centrocentrist&quot; for focusing only on the core of the city. Other major cities planned according to the movement principles included British colonial capitals in New Delhi, Harare, Lusaka Nairobi and Kampala, as well as that of Canberra in Australia, and Albert Speer&#x27;s plan for the Nazi capital Germania.

=== Towers in the park ===

Le Corbusier (1887–1965) pioneered a new urban form called towers in the park. His approach was based on defining the house as &#x27;a machine to live in&#x27;. The Plan Voisin he devised for Paris, which was never fulfilled, would have involved the demolition of much of historic Paris in favour of 18 uniform 700-foot tower blocks. Ville Contemporaine and the Ville Radieuse formulated his basic principles, including decongestion of the city by increased density and open space by building taller on a smaller footprint. Wide avenues should also be built to the city centre by demolishing old structures, which was criticized for lack of environmental awareness. His generic ethos of planning was based on the rule of experts who would &quot;work out their plans in total freedom from partisan pressures and special interests&quot; and that &quot;once their plans are formulated, they must be implemented without opposition&quot;. His influence on the Soviet Union helped inspire the &#x27;urbanists&#x27; who wanted to build planned cities full of massive apartment blocks in Soviet countryside. The only city which he ever actually helped plan was Chandigarh in India. Brasília, planned by Oscar Niemeyer, also was heavily influenced by his thought. Both cities suffered from the issue of unplanned settlements growing outside them.

=== Decentralised planning ===
In the United States, Frank Lloyd Wright similarly identified vehicular mobility as a principal planning metric. Car-based suburbs had already been developed in the Country Club District in 1907-1908 (including later the world&#x27;s first car-based shopping centre of Country Club Plaza), as well as in Beverly Hills in 1914 and Palos Verdes Estates in 1923. Wright began to idealise this vision in his Broadacre City starting in 1924, with similarities to the garden city and regional planning movements. The fundamental idea was for technology to liberate individuals. In his Usonian vision, he described the city as&quot;spacious, well-landscaped highways, grade crossings eliminated by a new kind of integrated by-passing or over- or under-passing all traffic in cultivated or living areas … Giant roads, themselves great architecture, pass public service stations . . . passing by farm units, roadside markets, garden schools, dwelling places, each on its acres of individually adorned and cultivated ground&quot;.This was justified as a democratic ideal, as &quot;“Democracy is the ideal of reintegrated decentralization … many free units developing strength as they learn by function and grow together in spacious mutual freedom.” This vision was however criticized by Herbert Muschamp as being contradictory in its call for individualism while relying on the master-architect to design it all.

After World War II, suburbs similar to Broadacre City spread throughout the US, but without the social or economic aspects of his ideas. A notable example was that of Levittown, built 1947 to 1951. The suburban design was criticized for their lack of form by Lewis Mumford as it lacked clear boundaries, and by Ian Nairn because &quot;Each building is treated in isolation, nothing binds it to the next one&quot;.

In the Soviet Union too, the so-called deurbanists (such as Moisei Ginzburg and Mikhail Okhitovich) advocated for the use of electricity and new transportation technologies (especially the car) to disperse the population from the cities to the countryside, with the ultimate aim of a &quot;townless, fully decentralized, and evenly populated country&quot;. However, in 1931 the Communist Party ruled such views as forbidden.

=== Opposition to blueprint planning ===
Throughout both the United States and Europe, the rational planning movement declined in the latter half of the 20th century. Key events in the United States include the demolition of the Pruitt-Igoe housing project in St. Louis and the national backlash against urban renewal projects, particularly urban expressway projects. An influential critic of such planning was Jane Jacobs, who wrote &quot;The Death and Life of Great American Cities&quot; in 1961, claimed to be &quot;one of the most influential books in the short history of city planning&quot;. She attacked the garden city movement because its &quot;prescription for saving the city was to do the city in&quot; and because it &quot;conceived of planning also as essentially paternalistic, if not authoritarian&quot;. The Corbusians on the other hand were claimed to be egoistic. In contrast, she defended the dense traditional inner-city neighborhoods like Brooklyn Heights or North Beach, San Francisco, and argued that an urban neighbourhood required about 200-300 people per acre, as well as a high net ground coverage at the expense of open space. She also advocated for a diversity of land uses and building types, with the aim of having a constant churn of people throughout the neighbourhood across the times of the day. This essentially meant defending urban environments as they were before modern planning had aimed to start changing them. As she believed that such environments were essentially self-organizing, her approach was effectively one of laissez-faire, and has been criticized for not being able to guarantee &quot;the development of good neighbourhoods&quot;.

The most radical opposition to blueprint planning was declared in 1969 in a manifesto on the &quot;New Society&quot;, with the words that: The whole concept of planning (the town-and-country kind at least) has gone cockeyed … Somehow, everything must be watched; nothing must be allowed simply to “happen.” No house can be allowed to be commonplace in the way that things just are commonplace: each project must be weighed, and planned, and approved, and only then built, and only after that discovered to be commonplace after all.Another form of opposition came from the advocacy planning movement, opposes to traditional top-down and technical planning.

== Modernist planning ==
Cybernetics and modernism inspired the related theories of rational process and systems approaches to urban planning in the 1960s. They were imported into planning from other disciplines. The systems approach was a reaction to the issues associated with the traditional view of planning. It did not understand the social and economic sides of cities, the complexity and interconnectedness of urban life, as well as lacking in flexibility. The &#x27;quantitative revolution&#x27; of the 1960s also created a drive for more scientific and precise thinking, while the rise of ecology made the approach more natural.

=== Systems theory ===

Systems theory is based on the conception of phenomena as &#x27;systems&#x27;, which are themselves coherent entities composed of interconnected and interdependent parts. A city can in this way be conceptualised as a system with interrelated parts of different land uses, connected by transport and other communications. The aim of urban planning thereby becomes that of planning and controlling the system. Similar ideas had been put forward by Geddes, who had seen cities and their regions as analogous to organisms, though they did not receive much attention while planning was dominated by architects.

The idea of the city as a system meant that it became critical for planners to understand how cities functioned. It also meant that a change to one part in a city would have effects on others parts as well. There were also doubts raised about the goal of producing detailed blueprints of how cities should look like in the end, instead suggesting the need for more flexible plans with trajectories instead of fixed futures. Planning should also be an ongoing process of monitoring and taking action in the city, rather than just producing the blueprint at one time. The systems approach also necessitated taking into account the economic and social aspects of cities, beyond just the aesthetic and physical ones.

=== Rational process approach ===
The focus on the procedural aspect of planning had already been pioneered by Geddes in his Survey-Analysis-Plan approach. However, this approach had several shortfalls. It did not consider the reasons for doing a survey in the first place. It also suggested that there should be simply a single plan to be considered. Finally, it did not take into account the implementation stage of the plan. There should also be further action in monitoring the outcomes of the plan after that. The rational process, in contrast, identified five different stages: (1) the definition of problems and aims; (2) the identification of alternatives; (3) the evaluation of alternatives; (4) implementation: (5) monitoring. This new approach represented a rejection of blueprint planning.

=== Incrementalism ===

Beginning in the late 1950s and early 1960s, critiques of the rational paradigm began to emerge and formed into several different schools of planning thought. The first of these schools is Lindblom&#x27;s incrementalism. Lindblom describes planning as &quot;muddling through&quot; and thought that practical planning required decisions to be made incrementally. This incremental approach meant choosing from small number of policy approaches that can only have a small number consequences and are firmly bounded by reality, constantly adjusting the objectives of the planning process and using multiple analyses and evaluations.

=== Mixed scanning model ===
The mixed scanning model, developed by Etzioni, takes a similar approach to Lindblom. Etzioni (1968) suggested that organizations plan on two different levels: the tactical and the strategic. He posited that organizations could accomplish this by essentially scanning the environment on multiple levels and then choose different strategies and tactics to address what they found there. While Lindblom&#x27;s approach only operated on the functional level Etzioni argued, the mixed scanning approach would allow planning organizations to work on both the functional and more big-picture oriented levels.

==Postmodern planning==
Modernism sought to design and plan cities that followed the logic of the new model of industrial mass production; reverting to large-scale solutions, aesthetic standardization, and prefabricated design solutions. This approach was found to have eroded urban living by its failure to recognize differences and aim towards homogeneous landscapes. Jane Jacobs&#x27;s 1961 book &quot;The Death and Life of Great American Cities,&quot; was a sustained critique of urban planning as it had developed within modernism, and played a major role in turning public opinion against modernist planners, notably Robert Moses.

Postmodern urban planning involves theories that embrace and aim to create diversity, elevating uncertainty, flexibility, and change, and rejecting utopianism while embracing a utopian way of thinking and acting. The postmodernity of &quot;resistance&quot; seeks to deconstruct modernism, a critique of the origins without necessarily returning to them. As a result, planners are much less inclined to lay a firm or steady claim to there being one single &quot;right way&quot; of engaging in urban planning and are more open to different styles and ideas of &quot;how to plan&quot;.

This postmodern reaction is often compared with the modernist Chicago School, the then dominant movement founded at the University of Chicago in the 1920s. Sociologist Ernest Burgess&#x27;s prominent concentric circle model depicted urban areas as a series of concentric functional zones that sorted population groups. It proposed a central business core, circled by transitional immigrant and working class areas, then by more affluent outer commuter rings. In contrast, for example, the postmodernist Los Angeles School, primarily associated with the University of California at LA, viewed Los Angeles as a prototypical postmodern city, a &quot;multi-nucleated megacity encompassing hundreds of municipalities&quot;, sprawling and centerless. The LA School analysis emphasized the global-local connection, pervasive social fragmentation, and a &quot;reterritorialization of the urban process in which hinterland organizes the center (in direct contradiction to the Chicago model)&quot;.

A review of postmodern urbanism literature, published in 2018 in the &quot;Journal of Architectural and Planning Research&quot;, examined coverage of style, epoch, and method, noting a general lack of cohesive definition, and the use of questionable interpretation to form conceptual statements. The review concluded that as a theoretical construct, postmodern urbanism &quot;is relevant to planning and design theory insofar as it rejects modernist &#x27;rational&#x27; planning.&quot; However, given that urban planning and design are grounded in practice, postmodern theoretical ideas offer &quot;little insight that professionals can use.&quot;

== Political planning ==
In the 1960s, a view emerged of planning as an inherently normative and political activity. Advocates of this approach included Norman Dennis, Martin Meyerson, Edward C. Banfield, Paul Davidoff, and Norton E. Long, the latter remarking that:Plans are policies and policies, in a democracy at any rate, spell politics. The question is not whether planning will reflect politics but whose politics it will reflect. What values and whose values will planners seek to implement? . . . No longer can the planner take refuge in the neutrality of the objectivity of the personally uninvolved scientist.The choices between alternative end points in planning was a key issue which was seen as political.

=== Participatory planning ===
Participatory planning is an urban planning paradigm that emphasizes involving the entire community in the strategic and management processes of urban planning; or, community-level planning processes, urban or rural. It is often considered as part of community development. Participatory planning aims to harmonize views among all of its participants as well as prevent conflict between opposing parties. In addition, marginalized groups have an opportunity to participate in the planning process.

Patrick Geddes had first advocated for the &quot;real and active participation&quot; of citizens when working in the British Raj, arguing against the &quot;Dangers of Municipal Government from above&quot; which would cause &quot;detachment from public and popular feeling, and consequently, before long, from public and popular needs and usefulness&quot;. Further on, self-build was researched by Raymond Unwin in the 1930s in his &quot;Town Planning in Practice&quot;. The Italian anarchist architect Giancarlo De Carlo then argued in 1948 that &quot;“The housing problem cannot be solved from above. It is a problem of the people, and it will not be solved, or even boldly faced, except by the concrete will and action of the people themselves&quot;, and that planning should exist &quot;as the manifestation of communal collaboration&quot;. Through the Architectural Association School of Architecture, his ideas caught John Turner, who started working in Peru with Eduardo Neira. He would go on working in Lima from the mid-&#x27;50s to the mid-&#x27;60s. There he found that the &quot;barrios&quot; were not slums, but were rather highly organised and well-functioning. As a result, he came to the conclusion that:&quot;When dwellers control the major decisions and are free to make their own contributions in the design, construction or management of their housing, both this process and the environment produced stimulate individual and social well-being. When people have no control over nor responsibility for key decisions in the housing process, on the other hand, dwelling environments may instead become a barrier to personal fulfillment and a burden on the economy.&quot;The role of the government was to provide a framework within which people would be able to work freely, for example by providing them the necessary resources, infrastructure and land. Self-build was later again taken up by Christopher Alexander, who led a project called People Rebuild Berkeley in 1972, with the aim to create &quot;self-sustaining, self-governing&quot; communities, though it ended up being closer to traditional planning.

=== Synoptic planning ===
After the &quot;fall&quot; of blueprint planning in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the synoptic model began to emerge as a dominant force in planning. Lane (2005) describes synoptic planning as having four central elements:

:&quot;(1) an enhanced emphasis on the specification of goals and targets; (2) an emphasis on quantitative analysis and predication of the environment; (3) a concern to identify and evaluate alternative policy options; and (4) the evaluation of means against ends (page 289).&quot;

Public participation was first introduced into this model and it was generally integrated into the system process described above. However, the problem was that the idea of a single public interest still dominated attitudes, effectively devaluing the importance of participation because it suggests the idea that the public interest is relatively easy to find and only requires the most minimal form of participation.

==== Transactive planning ====

Transactive planning was a radical break from previous models. Instead of considering public participation as a method that would be used in addition to the normal training planning process, participation was a central goal. For the first time, the public was encouraged to take on an active role in the policy-setting process, while the planner took on the role of a distributor of information and a feedback source. Transactive planning focuses on interpersonal dialogue that develops ideas, which will be turned into action. One of the central goals is mutual learning where the planner gets more information on the community and citizens to become more educated about planning issues.

=== Advocacy planning ===
Formulated in the 1960s by lawyer and planning scholar Paul Davidoff, the advocacy planning model takes the perspective that there are large inequalities in the political system and in the bargaining process between groups that result in large numbers of people unorganized and unrepresented in the process. It concerns itself with ensuring that all people are equally represented in the planning process by advocating for the interests of the underprivileged and seeking social change. Again, public participation is a central tenet of this model. A plurality of public interests is assumed, and the role of the planner is essentially the one as a facilitator who either advocates directly for underrepresented groups directly or encourages them to become part of the process.

===Radical planning===
Radical planning is a stream of urban planning which seeks to manage development in an equitable and community-based manner. The seminal text to the radical planning movement is &quot;Foundations for a Radical Concept in Planning&quot; (1973), by Stephen Grabow and Allen Heskin. Grabow and Heskin provided a critique of planning as elitist, centralizing and change-resistant, and proposed a new paradigm based upon systems change, decentralization, communal society, facilitation of human development and consideration of ecology. Grabow and Heskin were joined by &quot;Head of Department of Town Planning&quot; from the Polytechnic of the South Bank Shean McConnell, and his 1981 work &quot;Theories for Planning&quot;.

In 1987 John Friedmann entered the fray with &quot;Planning in the Public Domain: From Knowledge to Action&quot;, promoting a radical planning model based on &quot;decolonization&quot;, &quot;democratization&quot;, &quot;self-empowerment&quot; and &quot;reaching out&quot;. Friedmann described this model as an &quot;Agropolitan development&quot; paradigm, emphasizing the re-localization of primary production and manufacture. In &quot;Toward a Non-Euclidian Mode of Planning&quot; (1993) Friedmann further promoted the urgency of decentralizing planning, advocating a planning paradigm that is normative, innovative, political, transactive and based on a social learning approach to knowledge and policy.

=== Bargaining model ===
The bargaining model views planning as the result of giving and take on the part of a number of interests who are all involved in the process. It argues that this bargaining is the best way to conduct planning within the bounds of legal and political institutions. The most interesting part of this theory of planning is that it makes public participation the central dynamic in the decision-making process. Decisions are made first and foremost by the public, and the planner plays a more minor role.

=== Communicative approach ===

The communicative approach to planning is perhaps the most difficult to explain. It focuses on using communication to help different interests in the process to understand each other. The idea is that each individual will approach a conversation with his or her own subjective experience in mind and that from that conversation shared goals and possibilities will emerge. Again, participation plays a central role in this model. The model seeks to include a broad range of voice to enhance the debate and negotiation that is supposed to form the core of actual plan making. In this model, participation is actually fundamental to the planning process happening. Without the involvement of concerned interests, there is no planning. Looking at each of these models it becomes clear that participation is not only shaped by the public in a given area or by the attitude of the planning organization or planners that work for it. In fact, public participation is largely influenced by how planning is defined, how planning problems are defined, the kinds of knowledge that planners choose to employ and how the planning context is set. Though some might argue that is too difficult to involve the public through transactive, advocacy, bargaining and communicative models because transportation is some ways more technical than other fields, it is important to note that transportation is perhaps unique among planning fields in that its systems depend on the interaction of a number of individuals and organizations.

== Process ==
=== Changes to the planning process ===

Strategic Urban Planning over past decades have witnessed the metamorphosis of the role of the urban planner in the planning process. More citizens calling for democratic planning &amp; development processes have played a huge role in allowing the public to make important decisions as part of the planning process. Community organizers and social workers are now very involved in planning from the grassroots level. The term advocacy planning was coined by Paul Davidoff in his influential 1965 paper, &quot;Advocacy and Pluralism in Planning&quot; which acknowledged the political nature of planning and urged planners to acknowledge that their actions are not value-neutral and encouraged minority and underrepresented voices to be part of planning decisions. Benveniste argued that planners had a political role to play and had to bend some truth to power if their plans were to be implemented.

Developers have also played huge roles in development, particularly by planning projects. Many recent developments were results of large and small-scale developers who purchased land, designed the district and constructed the development from scratch. The Melbourne Docklands, for example, was largely an initiative pushed by private developers to redevelop the waterfront into a high-end residential and commercial district.

Recent theories of urban planning, espoused, for example by Salingaros see the city as an adaptive system that grows according to process similar to those of plants. They say that urban planning should thus take its cues from such natural processes. Such theories also advocate participation by inhabitants in the design of the urban environment, as opposed to simply leaving all development to large-scale construction firms.

In the process of creating an urban plan or urban design, carrier-infill is one mechanism of spatial organization in which the city&#x27;s figure and ground components are considered separately. The urban figure, namely buildings, is represented as total possible building volumes, which are left to be designed by architects in the following stages. The urban ground, namely in-between spaces and open areas, are designed to a higher level of detail. The carrier-infill approach is defined by an urban design performing as the carrying structure that creates the shape and scale of the spaces, including future building volumes that are then infilled by architects&#x27; designs. The contents of the carrier structure may include street pattern, landscape architecture, open space, waterways, and other infrastructure. The infill structure may contain zoning, building codes, quality guidelines, and Solar Access based upon a solar envelope. Carrier-Infill urban design is differentiated from complete urban design, such as in the monumental axis of Brasília, in which the urban design and architecture were created together.

In carrier-infill urban design or urban planning, the negative space of the city, including landscape, open space, and infrastructure is designed in detail. The positive space, typically building a site for future construction, is only represented in unresolved volumes. The volumes are representative of the total possible building envelope, which can then be infilled by individual architects.

<doc id="45352" wikidata="Q457293" url="?curid=45352" title="Richard Barthelmess">
<text>Richard Semler Barthelmess (May 9, 1895 – August 17, 1963) was an American film actor, principally of the Hollywood silent era. He starred opposite Lillian Gish in D. W. Griffith&#x27;s &quot;Broken Blossoms&quot; (1919) and &quot;Way Down East&quot; (1920) and was among the founders of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 1927. The following year, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for two films: &quot;The Patent Leather Kid&quot; and &quot;The Noose&quot;.

==Early life==
Barthelmess was born in New York City, the son of Caroline W. Harris, a stage actress, and Alfred W. Barthelmess. His father died when he was a year old. Through his mother, he grew up in the theatre, doing &quot;walk-ons&quot; from an early age. In contrast to that, he was educated at Hudson River Military Academy at Nyack, New York and Trinity College at Hartford, Connecticut. He did some acting in college and other amateur productions. By 1919 he had five years in stock company experience.

==Career==
Russian actress Alla Nazimova, a friend of the family, was taught English by Caroline Barthelmess. Nazimova convinced Richard Barthelmess to try acting professionally, and he made his debut screen appearance in 1916 in the serial &quot;Gloria&#x27;s Romance&quot; as an uncredited extra. He also appeared as a supporting player in several films starring Marguerite Clark.

His next role, in &quot;War Brides&quot; opposite Nazimova, attracted the attention of director D.W. Griffith, who offered him several important roles, finally casting him opposite Lillian Gish in &quot;Broken Blossoms&quot; (1919) and &quot;Way Down East&quot; (1920). He founded his own production company, Inspiration Film Company, together with Charles Duell and Henry King. One of their films, &quot;Tol&#x27;able David&quot; (1921), in which Barthelmess starred as a teenage mailman who finds courage, was a major success. In 1922, &quot;Photoplay&quot; described him as the &quot;idol of every girl in America.&quot;
Barthelmess had a large female following during the 1920s. An admirer wrote to the editor of &quot;Picture-Play Magazine&quot; in 1921:Different fans have different opinions, and although Wallace Reid, Thomas Meighan, and Niles Welch are mighty fine chaps, I think that Richard Barthelmess beats them all. Dick is getting more and more popular every day, and why? Because his wonderful black hair and soulful eyes are enough to make any young girl adore him. The first play I saw Dick in was &quot;Boots&quot;—Dorothy Gish playing the lead. This play impressed me so that I went to see every play in which he appeared—&quot;Three Men and a Girl,&quot; &quot;Scarlet Days,&quot; &quot;The Love Flower,&quot; and &quot;Broken Blossoms,&quot; in which I decided that Dick was my favorite. I am looking forward to &quot;Way Down East&quot; as being a great success, because I know Dick will play a good part.

Barthelmess soon became one of Hollywood&#x27;s higher paid performers, starring in such classics as &quot;The Patent Leather Kid&quot; in 1927 and &quot;The Noose&quot; in 1928; he was nominated for Best Actor at the first Academy Awards for his performance in both films. In addition, he won a special citation for producing &quot;The Patent Leather Kid&quot;.

With the advent of the sound era, Barthelmess remained a star for a number of years. He played numerous leads in talkie films, most notably &quot;Son of the Gods&quot; (1930), &quot;The Dawn Patrol&quot; (1930), &quot;The Last Flight&quot; (1931), &quot;The Cabin in the Cotton&quot; (1932) and &quot;Heroes for Sale&quot; (1933). He was able to choose his own material and often played in controversial or socially conscious films. However, his popularity began to wane in the 1930s. He became too old for the boyish leads he usually played. In his later films (between 1939 and his retirement in 1942), he turned towards character roles – most notably, his supporting role as the disgraced pilot and husband of Rita Hayworth&#x27;s character in &quot;Only Angels Have Wings&quot; (1939).

===Post-acting career===
Barthelmess failed to maintain the stardom of his silent film days and gradually left entertainment. He enlisted in the United States Navy Reserve during World War II, and served as a lieutenant commander, stationed at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard. He never returned to film, preferring to live off his real estate investments.

==Personal life==
On June 18, 1920, Barthelmess married Mary Hay, a stage and screen star, in New York. They had one daughter, Mary Barthelmess, before divorcing on January 15, 1927.

In August 1927, Barthelmess became engaged to Katherine Young Wilson, a Broadway actress. However, the engagement was called off due to Wilson&#x27;s stated desire to continue acting, or possibly his affair around this time with the journalist Adela Rogers St. Johns.

On April 21, 1928, Barthelmess married Jessica Stewart Sargent. He later adopted her son, Stewart, from a previous marriage. They remained married until Barthelmess&#x27; death in 1963.

==Death==
Barthelmess died of throat cancer on August 17, 1963, aged 68, in Southampton, New York. He was interred at the Ferncliff Cemetery and Mausoleum in Hartsdale, New York.

<text>A writer is a person who uses written words in different writing styles, genres and techniques to communicate ideas, to inspire feelings and emotions, or to entertain. Writers may develop different forms of writing such as novels, short stories, monographs, travelogues, plays, screenplays, teleplays, songs, and essays as well as reports, educational material, and news articles that may be of interest to the general public. Writers&#x27; works are nowadays published across a wide range of media. Skilled writers who are able to use language to express ideas well, often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society.

The term &quot;writer&quot; is also used elsewhere in the arts and music, such as songwriter or a screenwriter, but also a stand-alone &quot;writer&quot; typically refers to the creation of written language. Some writers work from an oral tradition.

Writers can produce material across a number of genres, fictional or non-fictional. Other writers use multiple media such as graphics or illustration to enhance the communication of their ideas. Another recent demand has been created by civil and government readers for the work of non-fictional technical writers, whose skills create understandable, interpretive documents of a practical or scientific kind. Some writers may use images (drawing, painting, graphics) or multimedia to augment their writing. In rare instances, creative writers are able to communicate their ideas via music as well as words.

As well as producing their own written works, writers often write about &quot;how&quot; they write (their writing process); &quot;why&quot; they write (that is, their motivation); and also comment on the work of other writers (criticism). Writers work professionally or non-professionally, that is, for payment or without payment and may be paid either in advance, or on acceptance, or only after their work is published. Payment is only one of the motivations of writers and many are not paid for their work.

The term &quot;writer&quot; has been used as a synonym of &quot;author&quot;, although the latter term has a somewhat broader meaning and is used to convey legal responsibility for a piece of writing, even if its composition is anonymous, unknown or collaborative. Author most often refers to the writer of a book.

==Types==

Writers choose from a range of literary genres to express their ideas. Most writing can be adapted for use in another medium. For example, a writer&#x27;s work may be read privately or recited or performed in a play or film. Satire for example, may be written as a poem, an essay, a film, a comic play, or a part of journalism. The writer of a letter may include elements of criticism, biography, or journalism.

Many writers work across genres. The genre sets the parameters but all kinds of creative adaptation have been attempted: novel to film; poem to play; history to musical. Writers may begin their career in one genre and change to another. For example, historian William Dalrymple began in the genre of travel literature and also writes as a journalist. Many writers have produced both fiction and non-fiction works and others write in a genre that crosses the two. For example, writers of historical romances, such as Georgette Heyer, create characters and stories set in historical periods. In this genre, the accuracy of the history and the level of factual detail in the work both tend to be debated. Some writers write both creative fiction and serious analysis, sometimes using other names to separate their work. Dorothy Sayers, for example, wrote crime fiction but was also a playwright, essayist, translator, and critic.

===Literary and creative===
====Poet====
Poets make maximum use of the language to achieve an emotional and sensory effect as well as a cognitive one. To create these effects, they use rhyme and rhythm and they also apply the properties of words with a range of other techniques such as alliteration and assonance. A common topic is love and its vicissitudes. Shakespeare&#x27;s best-known love story &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, for example, written in a variety of poetic forms, has been performed in innumerable theaters and made into at least eight cinematic versions. John Donne is another poet renowned for his love poetry.

====Novelist====


====Satirist====
A satirist uses wit to ridicule the shortcomings of society or individuals, with the intent of revealing stupidity. Usually, the subject of the satire is a contemporary issue such as ineffective political decisions or politicians, although human vices such as greed are also a common and prevalent subject. Philosopher Voltaire wrote a satire about optimism called &quot;Candide&quot;, which was subsequently turned into an opera, and many well known lyricists wrote for it. There are elements of Absurdism in &quot;Candide&quot;, just as there are in the work of contemporary satirist Barry Humphries, who writes comic satire for his character Dame Edna Everage to perform on stage.

Satirists use different techniques such as irony, sarcasm, and hyperbole to make their point and they choose from the full range of genres – the satire may be in the form of prose or poetry or dialogue in a film, for example. One of the most well-known satirists is Jonathan Swift who wrote the four-volume work &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; and many other satires, including &quot;A Modest Proposal&quot; and &quot;The Battle of the Books&quot;.

====Short story writer====

A short story writer is a writer of short stories, works of fiction that can be read in a single sitting.

===Performative===
====Librettist====
Libretti (the plural of libretto) are the texts for musical works such as operas. The Venetian poet and librettist Lorenzo Da Ponte, for example, wrote the libretto for some of Mozart&#x27;s greatest operas. Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa were Italian librettists who wrote for Giacomo Puccini. Most opera composers collaborate with a librettist but unusually, Richard Wagner wrote both the music and the libretti for his works himself.
====Lyricist====

Usually writing in verses and choruses, a lyricist specializes in writing lyrics, the words that accompany or underscore a song or opera. Lyricists also write the words for songs. In the case of Tom Lehrer, these were satirical. Lyricist Noël Coward, who wrote musicals and songs such as &quot;Mad Dogs and Englishmen&quot; and the recited song &quot;I Went to a Marvellous Party&quot;, also wrote plays and films and performed on stage and screen as well. Writers of lyrics, such as these two, adapt other writers&#x27; work as well as create entirely original parts.
====Playwright====

A playwright writes plays which may or may not be performed on a stage by actors. A play&#x27;s narrative is driven by dialogue. Like novelists, playwrights usually explore a theme by showing how people respond to a set of circumstances. As writers, playwrights must make the language and the dialogue succeed in terms of the characters who speak the lines as well as in the play as a whole. Since most plays are performed, rather than read privately, the playwright has to produce a text that works in spoken form and can also hold an audience&#x27;s attention over the period of the performance. Plays tell &quot;a story the audience should care about&quot;, so writers have to cut anything that worked against that. Plays may be written in prose or verse. Shakespeare wrote plays in iambic pentameter as does Mike Bartlett in his play &quot;King Charles III&quot; (2014).

Playwrights also adapt or re-write other works, such as plays written earlier or literary works originally in another genre. Famous playwrights such as Henrik Ibsen or Anton Chekhov have had their works adapted several times. The plays of early Greek playwrights Sophocles, Euripides, and Aeschylus are still performed. Adaptations of a playwright&#x27;s work may be honest to the original or creatively interpreted. If the writers&#x27; purpose in re-writing the play is to make a film, they will have to prepare a screenplay. Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, for example, while still regularly performed in the original form, are often adapted and abridged, especially for the cinema. An example of a creative modern adaptation of a play that nonetheless used the original writer&#x27;s words, is Baz Luhrmann&#x27;s version of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. The amendment of the name to &quot;Romeo + Juliet&quot; indicates to the audience that the version will be different from the original. Tom Stoppard&#x27;s play &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead&quot; is a play inspired by Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; that takes two of Shakespeare&#x27;s most minor characters and creates a new play in which they are the protagonists.

====Screenwriter====
Screenwriters write a screenplay – or script – that provides the words for media productions such as films, television series and video games. Screenwriters may start their careers by writing the screenplay speculatively; that is, they write a script with no advance payment, solicitation or contract. On the other hand, they may be employed or commissioned to adapt the work of a playwright or novelist or other writer. Self-employed writers who are paid by contract to write are known as freelancers and screenwriters often work under this type of arrangement.

Screenwriters, playwrights and other writers are inspired by the classic themes and often use similar and familiar plot devices to explore them. For example, in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; is a &quot;play within a play&quot;, which the hero uses to demonstrate the king&#x27;s guilt. Hamlet hives the co-operation of the actors to set up the play as a thing &quot;wherein I&#x27;ll catch the conscience of the king&quot;. Teleplay writer Joe Menosky deploys the same &quot;play within a play&quot; device in an episode of the science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;. The bronze-age playwright/hero enlists the support of a &quot;Star Trek&quot; crew member to create a play that will convince the ruler (or &quot;patron&quot; as he is called), of the futility of war.

====Speechwriter====

A speechwriter prepares the text for a speech to be given before a group or crowd on a specific occasion and for a specific purpose. They are often intended to be persuasive or inspiring, such as the speeches given by skilled orators like Cicero; charismatic or influential political leaders like Nelson Mandela; or for use in a court of law or parliament. The writer of the speech may be the person intended to deliver it, or it might be prepared by a person hired for the task on behalf of someone else. Such is the case when speechwriters are employed by many senior-level elected officials and executives in both government and private sectors.

===Interpretive and academic===
====Biographer====

Biographers write an account of another person&#x27;s life. Richard Ellmann (1918–1987), for example, was an eminent and award-winning biographer whose work focused on the Irish writers James Joyce, William Butler Yeats, and Oscar Wilde. For the Wilde biography, he won the 1989 Pulitzer Prize for Biography.

====Critic====

Critics consider and assess the extent to which a work succeeds in its purpose. The work under consideration may be literary, theatrical, musical, artistic, or architectural. In assessing the success of a work, the critic takes account of why it was done – for example, why a text was written, for whom, in what style, and under what circumstances. After making such an assessment, critics write and publish their evaluation, adding the value of their scholarship and thinking to substantiate any opinion. The theory of criticism is an area of study in itself: a good critic understands and is able to incorporate the theory behind the work they are evaluating into their assessment. Some critics are already writers in another genre. For example, they might be novelists or essayists. Influential and respected writer/critics include the art critic Charles Baudelaire (1821–1867) and the literary critic James Wood (born 1965), both of whom have books published containing collections of their criticism. Some critics are poor writers and produce only superficial or unsubstantiated work. Hence, while anyone can be an uninformed critic, the notable characteristics of a good critic are understanding, insight, and an ability to write well.

====Editor====

An editor prepares literary material for publication. The material may be the editor&#x27;s own original work but more commonly, an editor works with the material of one or more other people. There are different types of editor. Copy editors format text to a particular style and/or correct errors in grammar and spelling without changing the text substantively. On the other hand, an editor may suggest or undertake significant changes to a text to improve its readability, sense or structure. This latter type of editor can go so far as to excise some parts of the text, add new parts, or restructure the whole. The work of editors of ancient texts or manuscripts or collections of works results in differing editions. For example, there are many editions of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays by notable editors who also contribute original introductions to the resulting publication. Editors who work on journals and newspapers have varying levels of responsibility for the text. They may write original material, in particular editorials, select what is to be included from a range of items on offer, format the material, and/or fact check its accuracy.

====Encyclopaedist====

Encyclopaedists create organised bodies of knowledge. Denis Diderot (1713–1784) is renowned for his contributions to the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;. The encyclopaedist Bernardino de Sahagún (1499–1590) was a Franciscan whose &quot;Historia general de las cosas de Nueva España&quot; is a vast encyclopedia of Mesoamerican civilization, commonly referred to as the &quot;Florentine Codex&quot;, after the Italian manuscript library which holds the best-preserved copy.

====Essayist====
Essayists write essays, which are original pieces of writing of moderate length in which the author makes a case in support of an opinion. They are usually in prose, but some writers have used poetry to present their argument.

====Historian====

A historian is a person who studies and writes about the past and is regarded as an authority on it. The purpose of a historian is to employ historical analysis to create coherent narratives that explain &quot;what happened&quot; and &quot;why or how it happened&quot;. Professional historians typically work in colleges and universities, archival centers, government agencies, museums, and as freelance writers and consultants. Edward Gibbon&#x27;s six-volume &quot;History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; influenced the development of historiography.

====Lexicographer====

Writers who create dictionaries are called lexicographers. One of the most famous is Samuel Johnson (1709–1784), whose &quot;Dictionary of the English Language&quot; was regarded not only as a great personal scholarly achievement but was also a dictionary of such pre-eminence, that would have been referred to by such writers as Jane Austen.

====Researcher/Scholar====
Researchers and scholars who write about their discoveries and ideas sometimes have profound effects on society. Scientists and philosophers are good examples because their new ideas can revolutionise the way people think and how they behave. Three of the best known examples of such a revolutionary effect are Nicolaus Copernicus, who wrote &quot;De revolutionibus orbium coelestium&quot; (1543); Charles Darwin, who wrote &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; (1859); and Sigmund Freud, who wrote &quot;The Interpretation of Dreams&quot; (1899).

These three highly influential, and initially very controversial, works changed the way people understood their place in the world. Copernicus&#x27;s heliocentric view of the cosmos displaced humans from their previously accepted place at the center of the universe; Darwin&#x27;s evolutionary theory placed humans firmly within, as opposed to above, the order of manner; and Freud&#x27;s ideas about the power of the unconscious mind overcame the belief that humans were consciously in control of all their own actions.

====Translator====

Translators have the task of finding some equivalence in another language to a writer&#x27;s meaning, intention and style. Translators whose work has had very significant cultural effect include Al-Ḥajjāj ibn Yūsuf ibn Maṭar, who translated &quot;Elements&quot; from Greek into Arabic and Jean-François Champollion, who deciphered Egyptian hieroglyphs with the result that he could publish the first translation of the Rosetta Stone hieroglyphs in 1822. Difficulties with translation are exacerbated when words or phrases incorporate rhymes, rhythms, or puns; or when they have connotations in one language that are non-existent in another. For example, the title of &quot;Le Grand Meaulnes&quot; by Alain-Fournier is supposedly untranslatable because &quot;no English adjective will convey all the shades of meaning that can be read into the simple [French] word &#x27;grand&#x27; which takes on overtones as the story progresses.&quot; Translators have also become a part of events where political figures who speak different languages meet to look into the relations between countries or solve political conflicts. It is highly critical for the translator to deliver the right information as a drastic impact could be caused if any error occurred.

===Reportage===

====Blogger====

Writers of blogs, which have appeared on the World Wide Web since the 1990s, need no authorisation to be published. The contents of these short opinion pieces or &quot;posts&quot; form a commentary on issues of specific interest to readers who can use the same technology to interact with the author, with an immediacy hitherto impossible. The ability to link to other sites means that some blog writers – and their writing – may become suddenly and unpredictably popular. Malala Yousafzai, a young Pakistani education activist, rose to prominence due to her blog for BBC.

A blog writer is using the technology to create a message that is in some ways like a newsletter and in other ways, like a personal letter. &quot;The greatest difference between a blog and a photocopied school newsletter, or an annual family letter photocopied and mailed to a hundred friends, is the potential audience and the increased potential for direct communication between audience members&quot;. Thus, as with other forms of letters the writer knows some of the readers, but one of the main differences is that &quot;some of the audience will be random&quot; and &quot;that presumably changes the way we [writers] write.&quot; It has been argued that blogs owe a debt to Renaissance essayist Michel de Montaigne, whose &quot;Essais&quot; (&quot;attempts&quot;), were published in 1580, because Montaigne &quot;wrote as if he were chatting to his readers: just two friends, whiling away an afternoon in conversation&quot;.

====Columnist====

Columnists write regular parts for newspapers and other periodicals, usually containing a lively and entertaining expression of opinion. Some columnists have had collections of their best work published as a collection in a book so that readers can re-read what would otherwise be no longer available. Columns are quite short pieces of writing so columnists often write in other genres as well. An example is the female columnist Elizabeth Farrelly, who besides being a columnist, is also an architecture critic and author of books.

====Diarist====
Writers who record their experiences, thoughts, or emotions in a sequential form over a period of time in a diary are known as diarists. Their writings can provide valuable insights into historical periods, specific events, or individual personalities. Examples include Samuel Pepys (1633–1703), an English administrator and Member of Parliament, whose detailed private diary provides eyewitness accounts of events during the 17th century, most notably of the Great Fire of London. Anne Frank (1929–1945) was a 13-year-old Dutch girl whose diary from 1942 to 1944 records both her experiences as a persecuted Jew in World War II and an adolescent dealing with intra-family relationships.

====Journalist====

Journalists write reports about current events after investigating them and gathering information. Some journalists write reports about predictable or scheduled events such as social or political meetings. Others are investigative journalists who need to undertake considerable research and analysis in order to write an explanation or account of something complex that was hitherto unknown or not understood. Often investigative journalists are reporting criminal or corrupt activity which puts them at risk personally and means that what it is likely that attempts may be made to attack or suppress what they write. An example is Bob Woodward, a journalist who investigated and wrote about criminal activities by the US President.
====Memoirist====
Writers of memoirs produce accounts from the memories of their own lives, which are considered unusual, important, or scandalous enough to be of interest to general readers. Although meant to be factual, readers are alerted to the likelihood of some inaccuracies or bias towards an idiosyncratic perception by the choice of genre. A memoir, for example, is allowed to have a much more selective set of experiences than an autobiography which is expected to be more complete and make a greater attempt at balance. Well-known memoirists include Frances Vane, Viscountess Vane, and Giacomo Casanova.

===Utilitarian===

====Ghostwriter====

Ghostwriters write for, or in the style of, someone else so the credit goes to the person on whose behalf the writing is done.

====Letter writer====

Writers of letters use a reliable form of transmission of messages between individuals, and surviving sets of letters provide insight into the motivations, cultural contexts, and events in the lives of their writers. Peter Abelard (1079–1142), philosopher, logician, and theologian is known not only for the heresy contained in some of his work, and the punishment of having to burn his own book, but also for the letters he wrote to Héloïse d&#x27;Argenteuil .

The letters (or epistles) of Paul the Apostle were so influential that over the two thousand years of Christian history, Paul became &quot;second only to Jesus in influence and the amount of discussion and interpretation generated&quot;.

====Report writer====
Report writers are people who gather information, organise and document it so that it can be presented to some person or authority in a position to use it as the basis of a decision. Well-written reports influence policies as well as decisions. For example, Florence Nightingale (1820–1910) wrote reports that were intended to effect administrative reform in matters concerning health in the army. She documented her experience in the Crimean War and showed her determination to see improvements: &quot;...after six months of incredible industry she had put together and written with her own hand her &quot;Notes affecting the Health, Efficiency and Hospital Administration of the British Army.&quot; This extraordinary composition, filling more than eight hundred closely printed pages, laying down vast principles of far-reaching reform, discussing the minutest detail of a multitude of controversial subjects, containing an enormous mass of information of the most varied kinds – military, statistical, sanitary, architectural&quot; became for a long time, the &quot;leading authority on the medical administration of armies&quot;.

The logs and reports of Master mariner William Bligh contributed to his being honourably acquitted at the court-martial inquiring into the loss of .

====Scribe====

A scribe writes ideas and information on behalf of another, sometimes copying from another document, sometimes from oral instruction on behalf of an illiterate person, sometimes transcribing from another medium such as a tape recording, shorthand, or personal notes.

Being able to write was a rare achievement for over 500 years in Western Europe so monks who copied texts were scribes responsible for saving many texts from first times. The monasteries, where monks who knew how to read and write lived, provided an environment stable enough for writing. Irish monks, for example, came to Europe in about 600 and &quot;found manuscripts in places like Tours and Toulouse&quot; which they copied. The monastic writers also illustrated their books with highly skilled art work using gold and rare colors.

====Technical writer====
A technical writer prepares instructions or manuals, such as user guides or owner&#x27;s manuals for users of equipment to follow. Technical writers also write different procedures for business, professional or domestic use. Since the purpose of technical writing is practical rather than creative, its most important quality is clarity. The technical writer, unlike the creative writer, is required to adhere to the relevant style guide.

==Process and methods==

===Writing process===
There is a range of approaches that writers take to the task of writing. Each writer needs to find their own process and most describe it as more or less a struggle.
Sometimes writers have had the bad fortune to lose their work and have had to start again. Before the invention of photocopiers and electronic text storage, a writer&#x27;s work had to be stored on paper, which meant it was very susceptible to fire in particular. (In very earlier times, writers used vellum and clay which were more robust materials.) Writers whose work was destroyed before completion include L. L. Zamenhof, the inventor of Esperanto, whose years of work were thrown into the fire by his father because he was afraid that &quot;his son would be thought a spy working code&quot;.
Essayist and historian Thomas Carlyle, lost the only copy of a manuscript for &quot;The French Revolution: A History&quot; when it was mistakenly thrown into the fire by a maid. He wrote it again from the beginning. Writers usually develop a personal schedule. Angus Wilson, for example, wrote for a number of hours every morning.

Writer&#x27;s block is a relatively common experience among writers, especially professional writers, when for a period of time the writer feels unable to write for reasons other than lack of skill or commitment.

====Sole====
Most writers write alone – typically they are engaged in a solitary activity that requires them to struggle with both the concepts they are trying to express and the best way to express it. This may mean choosing the best genre or genres as well as choosing the best words. Writers often develop idiosyncratic solutions to the problem of finding the right words to put on a blank page or screen. &quot;Didn&#x27;t Somerset Maugham also write facing a blank wall? ... Goethe couldn&#x27;t write a line if there was another person anywhere in the same house, or so he said at some point.&quot;

====Collaborative====
Collaborative writing means that other authors write and contribute to a part of writing. In this approach, it is highly likely the writers will collaborate on editing the part too. The more usual process is that the editing is done by an independent editor after the writer submits a draft version.

In some cases, such as that between a librettist and composer, a writer will collaborate with another artist on a creative work. One of the best known of these types of collaborations is that between Gilbert and Sullivan. Librettist W. S. Gilbert wrote the words for the comic operas created by the partnership.

====Committee====
Occasionally, a writing task is given to a committee of writers. The most well-known example is the task of translating the Bible into English, sponsored by King James VI of England in 1604 and accomplished by six committees, some in Cambridge and some in Oxford, who were allocated different sections of the text. The resulting Authorized King James Version, published in 1611, has been described as an &quot;everlasting miracle&quot; because its writers (that is, its Translators) sought to &quot;hold themselves consciously poised between the claims of accessibility and beauty, plainness and richness, simplicity and majesty, the people and the king&quot;, with the result that the language communicates itself &quot;in a way which is quite unaffected, neither literary nor academic, not historical, nor reconstructionist, but transmitting a nearly incredible immediacy from one end of human civilisation to another.&quot;

====Multimedia====

Some writers support the verbal part of their work with images or graphics that are an integral part of the way their ideas are communicated. William Blake is one of rare poets who created his own paintings and drawings as integral parts of works such as his &quot;Songs of Innocence and of Experience&quot;. Cartoonists are writers whose work depends heavily on hand drawn imagery. Other writers, especially writers for children, incorporate painting or drawing in more or less sophisticated ways. Shaun Tan, for example, is a writer who uses imagery extensively, sometimes combining fact, fiction and illustration, sometimes for a didactic purpose, sometimes on commission. Children&#x27;s writers Beatrix Potter, May Gibbs, and Theodor Seuss Geisel are as well known for their illustrations as for their texts.

====Crowd sourced====

Some writers contribute very small sections to a part of writing that cumulates as a result. This method is particularly suited to very large works, such as dictionaries and encyclopaedias. The best known example of the former is the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, under the editorship of lexicographer James Murray, who was provided with the prolific and helpful contributions of W.C. Minor, at the time an inmate of a hospital for the criminally insane.

The best known example of the latter – an encyclopaedia that is crowdsourced – is Wikipedia, which relies on millions of writers and editors such as Simon Pulsifer worldwide.

===Motivations===
Writers have many different reasons for writing, among which is usually some combination of self-expression and recording facts, history or research results. The many physician writers, for example, have combined their observation and knowledge of the human condition with their desire to write and contributed many poems, plays, translations, essays and other texts. Some writers write extensively on their motivation and on the likely motivations of other writers. For example, George Orwell&#x27;s essay &quot;Why I Write&quot; (1946) takes this as its subject. As to &quot;what constitutes success or failure to a writer&quot;, it has been described as &quot;a complicated business, where the material rubs up against the spiritual, and psychology plays a big part&quot;.

====Command====
Some writers are the authors of specific military orders whose clarity will determine the outcome of a battle. Among the most controversial and unsuccessful was Lord Raglan&#x27;s order at the Charge of the Light Brigade, which being vague and misinterpreted, led to defeat with many casualties.

====Develop skill/explore ideas====
Some writers use the writing task to develop their own skill (in writing itself or in another area of knowledge) or explore an idea while they are producing a piece of writing. Philologist J. R. R. Tolkien, for example, created a new language for his fantasy books.

====Entertain====
Some genres are a particularly appropriate choice for writers whose chief purpose is to entertain. Among them are limericks, many comics and thrillers. Writers of children&#x27;s literature seek to entertain children but are also usually mindful of the educative function of their work as well.

====Influence====

Anger has motivated many writers, including Martin Luther, angry at religious corruption, who wrote the &quot;Ninety-five Theses&quot; in 1517, to reform the church, and Émile Zola (1840–1902) who wrote the public letter, &quot;J&#x27;Accuse&quot; in 1898 to bring public attention to government injustice, as a consequence of which he had to flee to England from his native France. Such writers have affected ideas, opinion or policy significantly.

====Payment====
Writers may write a particular piece for payment (even if at other times, they write for another reason), such as when they are commissioned to create a new work, transcribe an original one, translate another writer&#x27;s work, or write for someone who is illiterate or inarticulate. In some cases, writing has been the only way an individual could earn an income. Frances Trollope is an example of women who wrote to save herself and her family from penury, at a time when there were very few socially acceptable employment opportunities for them. Her book about her experiences in the United States, called &quot;Domestic Manners of the Americans&quot; became a great success, &quot;even though she was over fifty and had never written before in her life&quot; after which &quot;she continued to write hard, carrying this on almost entirely before breakfast&quot;. According to her writer son Anthony Trollope &quot;her books saved the family from ruin&quot;.

====Teach====
Aristotle, who was tutor to Alexander the Great, wrote to support his teaching. He wrote two treatises for the young prince: &quot;On Monarchy&quot;, and &quot;On Colonies&quot; and his dialogues also appear to have been written either &quot;as lecture notes or discussion papers for use in his philosophy school at the Athens Lyceum between 334 and 323 BC.&quot; They encompass both his &#x27;scientific&#x27; writings (metaphysics, physics, biology, meteorology, and astronomy, as well as logic and argument) the &#x27;non-scientific&#x27; works (poetry, oratory, ethics, and politics), and &quot;major elements in traditional Greek and Roman education&quot;.

Writers of textbooks also use writing to teach and there are numerous instructional guides to writing itself. For example, many people will find it necessary to make a speech &quot;in the service of your company, church, civic club, political party, or other organization&quot; and so, instructional writers have produced texts and guides for speechmaking.

====Tell a story====
Many writers use their skill to tell the story of their people, community or cultural tradition, especially one with a personal significance. Examples include Shmuel Yosef Agnon; Miguel Ángel Asturias; Doris Lessing; Toni Morrison; Isaac Bashevis Singer; and Patrick White.
Writers such as Mario Vargas Llosa, Herta Müller, and Erich Maria Remarque write about the effect of conflict, dispossession and war.

====Seek a lover====
Writers use prose, poetry, and letters as part of courtship rituals. Edmond Rostand&#x27;s play &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot;, written in verse, is about both the power of love and the power of the self-doubting writer/hero&#x27;s writing talent.

==Authorship==
===Pen names===
Writers sometimes use a pseudonym, otherwise known as a pen name or &quot;nom de plume&quot;. The reasons they do this include to separate their writing from other work (or other types of writing) for which they are known; to enhance the possibility of publication by reducing prejudice (such as against women writers or writers of a particular race); to reduce personal risk (such as political risks from individuals, groups or states that disagree with them); or to make their name better suit another language.

Examples of well-known writers who used a pen name include: George Eliot (1819–1880), whose real name was Mary Anne (or Marian) Evans; George Orwell (1903–1950), whose real name was Eric Blair; George Sand (1804–1876), whose real name was Lucile Aurore Dupin; Dr. Seuss (1904–1991), whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel; Stendhal (1783–1842), whose real name was Marie-Henri Beyle; and Mark Twain (1835–1910), whose real name was Samuel Langhorne Clemens.

Apart from the large numbers of works attributable only to &quot;Anonymous&quot;, there are a large number of writers who were once known and are now unknown. Efforts are made to find and re-publish these writers&#x27; works. One example is the publication of books like &quot;Japan As Seen and Described by Famous Writers&quot; (a 2010 reproduction of a pre-1923 publication) by &quot;Anonymous&quot;. Another example is the founding of a Library and Study Centre for the Study of Early English Women&#x27;s Writing in Chawton, England.

===Fictional writers===
Some fictional writers are very well known because of the strength of their characterization by the real writer or the significance of their role as writer in the plot of a work. Examples of this type of fictional writer include Edward Casaubon, a fictional scholar in George Eliot&#x27;s &quot;Middlemarch&quot;, and Edwin Reardon, a fictional writer in George Gissing&#x27;s &quot;New Grub Street&quot;. Casaubon&#x27;s efforts to complete an authoritative study affect the decisions taken by the protagonists in Eliot&#x27;s novel and inspire significant parts of the plot. In Gissing&#x27;s work, Reardon&#x27;s efforts to produce high quality writing put him in conflict with another character, who takes a more commercial approach. Robinson Crusoe is a fictional writer who was originally credited by the real writer (Daniel Defoe) as being the author of the confessional letters in the work of the same name. Bridget Jones is a comparable fictional diarist created by writer Helen Fielding. Both works became well-known and popular; their protagonists and story were developed further through many adaptations, including film versions. Cyrano de Bergerac was a real writer who created a fictional character with his own name. The &quot;Sibylline Books&quot;, a collection of prophecies were supposed to have been purchased from the Cumaean Sibyl by the last king of Rome. Since they were consulted during periods of crisis, it could be said that they are a case of real works created by a fictional writer.

===Writers of sacred texts===

Religious texts or scriptures are the texts which different religious traditions consider to be sacred, or of central importance to their religious tradition. Some religions and spiritual movements believe that their sacred texts are divinely or supernaturally revealed or inspired, while others have individual authors.

==Controversial writing==

Skilled writers influence ideas and society, so there are many instances where a writer&#x27;s work or opinion has been unwelcome and controversial. In some cases, they have been persecuted or punished. Aware that their writing will cause controversy or put themselves and others into danger, some writers self-censor; or withhold their work from publication; or hide their manuscripts; or use some other technique to preserve and protect their work. Two of the most famous examples are Leonardo da Vinci and Charles Darwin. Leonardo &quot;had the habit of conversing with himself in his writings and of putting his thoughts into the clearest and most simple form&quot;. He used &quot;left-handed or mirror writing&quot; (a technique described as &quot;so characteristic of him&quot;) to protect his scientific research from other readers. The fear of persecution, social disgrace, and being proved incorrect are regarded as contributing factors to Darwin&#x27;s delaying the publication of his radical and influential work &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;.

One of the results of controversies caused by a writer&#x27;s work is scandal, which is a negative public reaction that causes damage to reputation and depends on public outrage. It has been said that it is possible to scandalise the public because the public &quot;wants to be shocked in order to confirm its own sense of virtue&quot;. The scandal may be caused by what the writer wrote or by the style in which it was written. In either case, the content or the style is likely to have broken with tradition or expectation. Making such a departure may in fact, be part of the writer&#x27;s intention or at least, part of the result of introducing innovations into the genre in which they are working. For example, novelist D H Lawrence challenged ideas of what was acceptable as well as what was expected in form. These may be regarded as literary scandals, just as, in a different way, are the scandals involving writers who mislead the public about their identity, such as Norma Khouri or Helen Darville who, in deceiving the public, are considered to have committed fraud.

Writers may also cause the more usual type of scandal – whereby the public is outraged by the opinions, behaviour or life of the individual (an experience not limited to writers). Poet Paul Verlaine outraged society with his behaviour and treatment of his wife and child as well as his lover. Among the many writers whose writing or life was affected by scandals are Oscar Wilde, Lord Byron, Jean-Paul Sartre, Albert Camus, and H. G. Wells. One of the most famously scandalous writers was the Marquis de Sade who offended the public both by his writings &quot;and&quot; by his behaviour.

===Punishment===

The consequence of scandal for a writer may be censorship or discrediting of the work, or social ostracism of its creator. In some instances, punishment, persecution, or prison follow. The list of journalists killed in Europe, list of journalists killed in the United States and the list of journalists killed in Russia are examples. Others include:
* The Balibo Five, a group of Australian television journalists who were killed while attempting to report on Indonesian incursions into Portuguese Timor in 1975.
* Dietrich Bonhoeffer (1906–1945), an influential theologian who wrote &quot;The Cost of Discipleship&quot; and was hanged for his resistance to Nazism.
* Galileo Galilei (1564–1642), who was sentenced to imprisonment for heresy as a consequence of writing in support of the then controversial theory of heliocentrism, although the sentence was almost immediately commuted to house arrest.
* Antonio Gramsci (1891–1937), who wrote political theory and criticism and was imprisoned for this by the Italian Fascist regime.
* Günter Grass (1927–2015), whose poem &quot;What Must Be Said&quot; led to his being declared &quot;persona non grata&quot; in Israel.
* Peter Greste (born 1965), a journalist who was imprisoned in Egypt for news reporting which was &quot;damaging to national security.&quot;
* Primo Levi (1919–1987) who, among many Jews imprisoned during World War II, wrote an account of his incarceration called &quot;If This Is a Man&quot;.
* Sima Qian (145 or 135 BC – 86 BC) who &quot;successfully defended a vilified master from defamatory charges&quot; and was given &quot;the choice between castration or execution.&quot; He &quot;became a eunuch and had to bury his own book ... in order to protect it from the authorities.&quot;
* Salman Rushdie (born 1947), whose novel &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot; was banned and burned internationally after causing such a worldwide storm that a fatwā was issued against him. Though Rushdie survived, numerous others were killed in incidents connected to the novel.
* Roberto Saviano (born 1979), whose best-selling book &quot;Gomorrah&quot; provoked the Neapolitan Camorra, annoyed Silvio Berlusconi and led to him receiving permanent police protection.
* Simon Sheppard (born 1957) who was imprisoned in the UK for inciting racial hatred.
* Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn (1918–2008), who used his experience of imprisonment as the subject of his writing in &quot;One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich&quot; and &quot;Cancer Ward&quot;—the latter, while legally published in the Soviet Union, had to gain the approval of the USSR Union of Writers.
* William Tyndale ( – 1536), who was executed because he translated the Bible into English.

==Protection and representation==
The organisation Reporters Without Borders (also known by its French name: Reporters Sans Frontières) was set up to help protect writers and advocate on their behalf.

The professional and industrial interests of writers are represented by various national or regional guilds or unions. Examples include writers guilds in Australia and Great Britain and unions in Arabia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Canada, Estonia, Hungary, Ireland, Moldova, Philippines, Poland, Quebec, Romania, Russia, Sudan, and Ukraine. In the United States, there is both a writers guild and a National Writers Union.

==Awards==

There are many awards for writers whose writing has been adjudged excellent. Among them are the many literary awards given by individual countries, such as the Prix Goncourt and the Pulitzer Prize, as well as international awards such as the Nobel Prize in Literature. Russian writer Boris Pasternak (1890–1960), under pressure from his government, reluctantly declined the Nobel Prize that he won in 1958.

<text>Victor Andrew de Bier Everleigh McLaglen (10 December 1886 – 7 November 1959) was a British-American actor and boxer. His film career spanned from the early 1920s through the 1950s, initially as a leading man, though he was better known for his character acting. He was a well-known member of John Ford’s Stock Company, appearing in 12 of the director’s films, seven of which co-starred John Wayne.

For his performance as a treacherous Irish Republican in the 1935 film &quot;The Informer&quot;, he won the Academy Award for Best Actor, and was nominated for Best Supporting Actor for his role in &quot;The Quiet Man,&quot; both directed by Ford. In 1960, he was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

==Early life and education==
McLaglen claimed to have been born in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, although his birth certificate records 505 Commercial Road, Stepney in the East End of London as his true birthplace. His father, Andrew Charles Albert Mclaglen, was a missionary in the Free Protestant Church in South Africa, and was later a bishop of the Free Protestant Episcopal Church of England.

The McLaglen family is ultimately of Scottish origin, descended from a MacLachlan who settled in South Africa in the 19th century. The name was rendered into McLaglen from Dutch pronunciation. A.C.A. McLaglen was christened Andries Carel Albertus McLaglen in Cape Town on 4 April 1851.

One of ten siblings, Victor had eight brothers and a sister. Four of his brothers also became actors: Arthur, an actor and sculptor, and Clifford, Cyril, and Kenneth.

Other siblings included Frederick, Lewis, and a sister, Lily. Another brother, Sydney Temple Leopold McLaglen, who appeared in one film, gained notoriety prior to World War I as a showman and self-proclaimed world jujutsu champion, who authored a book on the subject.

Victor moved with his family to South Africa for a time, where his father was Bishop of Claremont.

==Army service and boxing career==
McLaglen left home at 14 to join the British Army with the intention of fighting in the Second Boer War, but much to his chagrin, he was stationed at Windsor Castle in the Life Guards and was later forced to leave the army when his true age was discovered.

Four years later, he moved to Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, where he became a local celebrity, earning a living as a wrestler and heavyweight boxer, with several notable wins in the ring. He also briefly served as a constable in the Winnipeg Police Force in 1907.

One of his most famous fights was against heavyweight champion Jack Johnson in a six-round exhibition bout at the Vancouver Athletic Club on 10 March 1909. This was Johnson&#x27;s first bout since winning the heavyweight title from Tommy Burns. Between bouts, McLaglen toured with a circus, which offered $25 to anyone who could go three rounds with him.

He returned to Britain in 1913, and during the First World War was commissioned as a Second lieutenant in the 10th Battalion, Middlesex Regiment, on 19 June 1915. He landed at Basra on 10 August 1916 and served as an Assistant Provost Marshal in Mesopotamia, ending the war as a Temporary Captain. (He may also have seen some service with the Royal Irish Fusiliers.) He continued boxing, and was named heavyweight champion of the British Army in 1918.

After the war, he continued boxing, including a defeat at the hands of British champion Frank Goddard. His final fight was a loss by knockout to Arthur Townley in October 1920. He finished his professional career with a record of 16 wins, eight losses, and a draw.

==Acting career==
===Britain===
McLaglen was visiting a sporting club when spotted by a film producer who was looking for a boxer to play the lead in a film, &quot;The Call of the Road&quot; (1920). Although McLaglen had never acted before, he auditioned and got the part.

He was in the adventure films: &quot;Corinthian Jack&quot; (1921) and &quot;The Prey of the Dragon&quot; (1921). He followed it with &quot;The Sport of Kings&quot; (1921). Donald Crisp cast him in &quot;The Glorious Adventure&quot; (1922) and he was in &quot;A Romance of Old Baghdad&quot; (1922), &quot;Little Brother of God&quot; (1922), &quot;A Sailor Tramp&quot; (1922), &quot;The Crimson Circle&quot; (1922), &quot;The Romany&quot; (1922), and &quot;Heartstrings&quot; (1922).

McLaglen played leads in &quot;M&#x27;Lord of the White Road&quot; (1923), &quot;In the Blood&quot; (1923), &quot;The Boatswain&#x27;s Mate&quot; (1923), &quot;Women and Diamonds&quot; (1924), and &quot;The Gay Corinthian&quot; (1924). He was in &quot;The Passionate Adventure&quot; (1924), co-written by Alfred Hitchcock, and &quot;The Beloved Brute&quot; (1924), &quot;The Hunted Woman&quot; (1925), and &quot;Percy&quot; (1925).

===Hollywood===
McLaglen&#x27;s career took a surprise turn in 1925 when he moved to Hollywood. He became a popular character actor, with a particular knack for playing drunks. He also usually played Irishmen, leading many film fans to mistakenly assume he was Irish rather than English. McLaglen played one of the titular characters of &quot;The Unholy Three&quot; (1925) in Lon Chaney Sr.&#x27;s original silent version of the macabre crime drama.

McLaglen had a support part in &quot;Winds of Chance&quot; (1925), directed by Frank Lloyd, then made &quot;The Fighting Heart&quot; (1925) at Fox, directed by John Ford. Ford would have a major impact on McLaglen&#x27;s career. McLaglen was in &quot;The Isle of Retribution&quot; (1925), &quot;Men of Steel&quot; (1926), and &quot;Beau Geste&quot; (1926), playing Hank in the last.

===&quot;What Price Glory?&quot; and stardom===

McLaglen was the top-billed leading man in director Raoul Walsh&#x27;s First World War classic &quot;What Price Glory?&quot; (1926) with Edmund Lowe and Dolores del Río. The film was a huge success, making over $2 million, and Fox signed McLaglen to a long-term contract.

Fox put McLaglen in &quot;The Loves of Carmen&quot; (1927) with del Río, directed by Walsh. He was top-billed in &quot;Mother Machree&quot; (1928), directed by Ford. He was top-billed in &quot;A Girl in Every Port&quot; (1928), co-starring Robert Armstrong and Louise Brooks. He starred in &quot;Hangman&#x27;s House&quot; (1928) for Ford, a romantic drama set in Ireland, and &quot;The River Pirate&quot; (1928), and &quot;Captain Lash&quot; (1929). McLaglen then made two films for Ford: &quot;Strong Boy&quot; (1929) and &quot;The Black Watch&quot; (1929).

===Talking movies===

McLaglen was one of many Fox stars who had cameos in the musical &quot;Happy Days&quot; (1929). He was reunited with Edmund Lowe and Raoul Walsh in a sequel to &quot;What Price Glory?&quot;, &quot;The Cock-Eyed World&quot; (1929), which was another huge success at the box office.

McLaglen made a musical with Walsh, &quot;Hot for Paris&quot; (1930), then made &quot;On the Level&quot; (1930). &quot;A Devil with Women&quot; (1931) was a buddy comedy with Humphrey Bogart in which Bogart played McLaglen&#x27;s sidekick. He was borrowed by Paramount for &quot;Dishonored&quot; (1931), starring Marlene Dietrich and directed by Joseph von Sternberg. He was in &quot;Not Exactly Gentlemen&quot; (1931) and had a cameo in the short film &quot;The Stolen Jools&quot; (1931). McLaglen, Lowe, and Walsh reunited for a second sequel to &quot;What Price Glory?&quot;, &quot;Women of All Nations&quot; (1931). He was in &quot;Annabelle&#x27;s Affairs&quot; (1931), &quot;Wicked&quot; (1931), &quot;The Gay Caballero&quot; (1932), and &quot;Devil&#x27;s Lottery&quot; (1932). McLaglen and Lowe went to Paramount for &quot;Guilty as Hell&quot; (1932).

Back at Fox he was in &quot;Rackety Rax&quot; (1932) then made a fourth &quot;What Price Glory?&quot; film with Lowe, &quot;Hot Pepper&quot; (1933). McLaglen starred in &quot;Laughing at Life&quot; (1933) and returned to Britain to make &quot;Dick Turpin&quot; (1933).

McLaglen starred opposite Boris Karloff&#x27;s crazed religious fanatic in John Ford&#x27;s &quot;The Lost Patrol&quot; (1934) at RKO, a picture about desperate soldiers gradually losing their minds fighting Arabs in the desert of what is now Iraq.

At Paramount, McLaglen and Lowe were in &quot;No More Women&quot; (1934) (a non-&quot;What Price Glory?&quot; film), then McLaglen made &quot;Wharf Angel&quot; (1934). He was one of many stars in &quot;Murder at the Vanities&quot; (1934). At Columbia, McLaglen starred in &quot;The Captain Hates the Sea&quot; (1934) with John Gilbert. Lowe and he reunited at Fox for &quot;Under Pressure&quot; (1935) (directed by Walsh) and &quot;The Great Hotel Murder&quot; (1935).

===&quot;The Informer&quot;===

Another highlight of his career was winning an Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in Ford&#x27;s &quot;The Informer&quot; (1935), shot at RKO, based on a novel of the same name by Liam O&#x27;Flaherty. In 1945, McLaglen said that winning the Oscar had no economic benefit and that he didn&#x27;t know where it was because his son had taken it to college for use as a paperweight.

Back at Fox – now 20th Century Fox – McLaglen made &quot;Professional Soldier&quot; (1935) with Freddie Bartholomew. At Paramount, he was teamed with Mae West in &quot;Klondike Annie&quot; (1936), then he went back to Fox for &quot;Under Two Flags&quot; (1936) with Rosalind Russell and Ronald Colman.

McLaglen starred in &quot;The Magnificent Brute&quot; (1936) for Universal, &quot;Sea Devils&quot; (1937) for RKO and &quot;Nancy Steele Is Missing!&quot; (1937) for Fox. He stayed at Fox to support Robert Taylor in &quot;This Is My Affair&quot; (1937), and notably, Shirley Temple in &quot;Wee Willie Winkie&quot; (1937) directed by John Ford at Fox. He had a cameo in &quot;Ali Baba Goes to Town&quot; (1937). Brian Donlevy and he made a comedy &quot;Battle of Broadway&quot; (1938) at Fox, then he went to Universal for &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Party&quot; (1938).

===&quot;Gunga Din&quot;===

McLaglen returned to Britain for &quot;We&#x27;re Going to Be Rich&quot; (1938) with Gracie Fields. Back in Hollywood, he did some films for RKO: &quot;Pacific Liner&quot; (1939) and &quot;Gunga Din&quot; (1939). The latter, with Cary Grant and Douglas Fairbanks Jr., was an adventure epic loosely based on Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s poem that served as the template decades later for &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; (1984).

He supported Nelson Eddy in &quot;Let Freedom Ring&quot; (1939) at MGM, and was in &quot;Ex-Champ&quot; (1939). He supported Brian Aherne in &quot;Captain Fury&quot; (1939), and starred in &quot;Full Confession&quot; (1939) for John Farrow at RKO, the latter film being somewhat a remake of &quot;The Informer&quot;.

At Universal, McLaglen teamed with Basil Rathbone in &quot;Rio&quot; (1939) and Jackie Cooper in &quot;The Big Guy&quot; (1939). He was top-billed in Edward Small&#x27;s South Seas adventure, &quot;South of Pago Pago&quot; (1940). He remained top-billed for &quot;Diamond Frontier&quot; (1940) and &quot;Broadway Limited&quot; (1941).

McLaglen and Lowe reprised their roles from &quot;What Price Glory?&quot; in the radio program &quot;Captain Flagg and Sergeant Quirt&quot;, broadcast on the Blue Network (28 September 1941 – 25 January 1942, and on NBC 13 February 1942 – 3 April 1942).

McLaglen and Lowe then played basically the same roles, but under different names in &quot;Call Out the Marines&quot; (1942) at RKO. He starred in &quot;Powder Town&quot; (1942), and went to Fox to support Gene Tierney in &quot;China Girl&quot; (1942). He was one of many stars in &quot;Forever and a Day&quot; (1943), and had a support role in &quot;Tampico&quot; (1943) and &quot;Roger Touhy, Gangster&quot; (1944). McLaglen was a villain in Bob Hope&#x27;s &quot;The Princess and the Pirate&quot; (1944), and he was in &quot;Rough, Tough and Ready&quot;.

===Supporting actor===
McLaglen began to be exclusively a supporting actor, with parts in &quot;Love, Honor and Goodbye&quot; (1945), &quot;Whistle Stop&quot; (1946) with George Raft and Ava Gardner, &quot;Calendar Girl&quot; (1947), &quot;The Michigan Kid&quot; (1947), and &quot;The Foxes of Harrow&quot; (1947).

McLaglen was back with John Ford for &quot;Fort Apache&quot; (1948) with John Wayne and Henry Fonda. It was very much a support part, as a cavalry sergeant, but so well received that McLaglen basically reprised it in the other two films in the Ford-Wayne &quot;cavalry trilogy&quot;: &quot;She Wore a Yellow Ribbon&quot; (1949) and &quot;Rio Grande&quot; (1950) with Maureen O&#x27;Hara and Ben Johnson.

McLaglen was later nominated for another Oscar, this time for a Best Supporting Actor for his role opposite John Wayne in &quot;The Quiet Man&quot; (1952). He continued to be in demand as a support actor in action films: &quot;Fair Wind to Java&quot; (1953) with Fred MacMurray and &quot;Prince Valiant&quot; (1954) with James Mason and Robert Wagner. He went to Britain for &quot;Trouble in the Glen&quot; (1954), an unsuccessful attempt to do for Scotland what &quot;The Quiet Man&quot; did for Ireland. Back in Hollywood, he was in &quot;Many Rivers to Cross&quot; (1955) at MGM with Robert Taylor and Eleanor Parker.

===Later career===
McLaglen had a rare late career lead role in &quot;City of Shadows&quot; (1955) at Republic with Patricia Crowley, and he was second-billed in &quot;Bengazi&quot; (1955), but he went back to supports with &quot;Lady Godiva of Coventry&quot; (1955). He had a cameo in &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; (1956) with David Niven and Cantinflas, then had another lead in &quot;The Abductors&quot; (1957), directed by his son, Andrew V. McLaglen.

Toward the end of his career, McLaglen made several guest appearances on television, particularly in Western series such as &quot;Have Gun, Will Travel&quot; and &quot;Rawhide&quot;. The episodes in which McLaglen guest-starred were both directed by his son, Andrew, who later became a film director frequently directing John Wayne.

He went to Italy for &quot;Gli Italiani sono matti&quot;, and had a good part in &quot;Sea Fury&quot; (1958) with Stanley Baker.

==Activism==
In 1933, he founded the California Light Horse Regiment, which included a &quot;riding parade club, a polo-playing group and a precision motorcycle contingent&quot;. He described it in a press interview as promoting &quot;Americanism&quot;. He said it was organized to fight communists and others &quot;opposed to the American ideal&quot;, both inside and outside the country. McLaglen was attacked by some on the left as fascist, which he denied. He said he was a &quot;patriot of the good old-fashioned American kind&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1935, McLaglen spent a reported $40,000 (equal to $ today) to build his own stadium near Riverside Drive and Hyperion Avenue, near Griffith Park and the Atwater Village neighborhood of Los Angeles. The stadium was used for football and many other activities. The Los Angeles River flood of 1938 seriously damaged the stadium, and it fell into disuse thereafter. In 1941, he was selected as the grand marshal of the Clovis Rodeo parade in Clovis, California.

McLaglen was married three times. He first married Enid Lamont in 1919. The couple had two sons, Andrew, Walter, and one daughter, Sheila. Andrew McLaglen was a television and film director who worked on several film projects with John Wayne. Andrew&#x27;s children, Mary and Josh McLaglen, are both film producers and directors. Sheila&#x27;s daughter, Gwyneth Horder-Payton, is a television director. Enid Lamont McLaglen died in 1942 as a result of a horse-riding accident.

His second marriage was to Suzanne M. Brueggeman. That marriage lasted from 1943 until 1948. His third and final marriage was to divorcée Margaret McNichols Pumphrey, a Seattle socialite he married in 1948. They remained married until his death from congestive heart failure in 1959.

He had by that time become a naturalized U.S. citizen. His cremated remains are interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale, in the Garden of Memory, Columbarium of Eternal Light.

On 8 February 1960, McLaglen received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1735 Vine Street, for his contributions to the motion-picture industry.

McLaglen spoke five languages, including Arabic.

<text> (; : ; meaning &#x27;old one&#x27; or simply &#x27;old&#x27;) is a category of aged, male characters from Italian commedia dell&#x27;arte theatre. The primary members of this group are Pantalone, il Dottore, and il Capitano. Pantalone and il Dottore are the alter ego of each other: Pantalone being the decadent wealthy merchant, and il Dottore being the decadent erudite.

They are overwhelmingly the antagonists, opposing the love of the ; the comic ending is produced when the Zanni manage to overcome them and unite the lovers.

<doc id="45364" wikidata="Q17307" url="?curid=45364" title="Pantalone">
<text>Pantalone (), spelled Pantaloon in English, is one of the most important principal characters found in commedia dell&#x27;arte. With his exceptional greed and status at the top of the social order, Pantalone is &quot;money&quot; in the &quot;commedia&quot; world. His full name, including family name, is &quot;Pantalon de&#x27; Bisognosi&quot;, Italian for &#x27;Pantalone of the Needy&#x27;.

==Character==
Pantalone originated as part of a master/servant duo and was the original &quot;Il Magnifico&quot; stock character. Carlo Goldoni, in his memoirs, named Pantalone as one of the four primary commedia dell&#x27;arte characters. Among other things, Pantalone is a character of Venetians; one theory is that his name derives from Saint Pantaleon (&quot;San Pantalone&quot;), a popular saint in Venice. Another theory is that his name derives from Venetian merchants who were called Piantaleoni. While the theories of the St. Pantaleone and the lion of St. Mark are common, they are both now considered unlikely origins, and the true origin is unknown. The name Pantaloon generally means &#x27;old fool&#x27; or &#x27;dotard&#x27;. The role of Pantalone is usually spoken entirely in the Venetian language. The character of Pantalone is entirely based on currency and ego, for he has the highest regard for his intelligence, &quot;but at every step he becomes the butt for every conceivable kind of trick&quot;. With little else to occupy his thoughts after a life as a tradesman or merchant, Pantalone is the metaphorical representation of money in the &quot;commedia&quot; world. While the social standing of merchants may have changed through many centuries, the intent for Pantalone was to ensure that he had the status that allowed him to meddle in the affairs of others. Pantalone is usually the father to one of the &quot;innamorati&quot; (the lovers), another stock character found in &quot;commedia&quot;. He is driven to keep his child and their respective lover apart. Pantalone is presented either as a widower or bachelor, and despite his age, makes numerous passes at the women within the &quot;commedia&quot; world, &quot;though he is always rejected&quot;. Pantalone never forgets a deal and his merit is based on actions, not words. He is also described as being petty, and he never forgets or forgives even the smallest things.

Pantalone is characterized as loving his money and having emotional extremes. With his sinister and often inhumane treatment towards his fellows, Pantalone is perceived to be a pivotal part of &quot;commedia&quot;. His importance is represented in almost every &quot;commedia&quot; production; often placing him at the beginning of the comedy. In a &quot;commedia&quot; drama, many Zanni or &quot;lazzi&quot; routines will begin by an action delivered by Pantalone himself. Pantalone is described as being too self-absorbed to notice and interact much with the audience, but he is so oblivious that it serves the same purpose.

Pantalone is also displayed either as a single man or a widower, and not withstanding his age, makes various &quot;attempts&quot; at the ladies inside the &quot;commedia&quot; world and is always rejected. Due to his portrayal as an older, single man, it might be claimed that Pantalone is a very one-sided representation of old age. However, he is actually a very rounded and multifaceted depiction of the suggestive natures of old age.

Pantalone&#x27;s inappropriate enthusiasm for the young ladies inside the &quot;commedia&quot; world is abundantly borne out in the previously mentioned &quot;Capriccii&quot;. &quot;Of all the twenty-seven pieces, ten allude to ladies in their titles alone, either just as a lady (&quot;donna&quot;), or as spouse (&quot;mogier&quot;), house cleaner and courtesan (&quot;Massara&quot;, &quot;Padrona&quot;) whores (&quot;puttane&quot;), sweetheart (&quot;morosa&quot;), and darling (&quot;innamorata&quot;).&quot;

Sexual symbolism is very prominent as illustrated in &quot;Della bellezza, and crudeltà d&#x27;una donna&quot;, one elderly person communicates along these lines:

:&quot;vorria d&#x27;amante libero&quot;
:&quot;farme servo, e desidero&quot;
:&quot;nel mar de l&#x27;appetito&quot;
:&quot;tegnir el timon dritto&quot;
:&quot;al vassello, e d&#x27;accorto&quot;
:&quot;vorria ficcarme in porto&quot;

:&quot;[I would like, as a free lover,&quot;
:&quot;to help myself, and I desire&quot;
:&quot;in the sea of appetite&quot;
:&quot;to keep the ship&#x27;s rudder&quot;
:&quot;straight, and smartly,&quot;
:&quot;would I like to thrust myself into port].&quot;

===Stance===
The traditional Pantalone stance is that of a hunch-backed old man. He walks with his hips forward, allowing him to make larger strides when he walks. The hunched shape restricts his legs, which are bent and turned out at the knees. The feet have the heels together with the toes facing apart. His hands and feet move quickly, although his body is stiff, and his head is constantly moving. When he walks, his feet should be picked up more than would occur naturally. Pantalone is slow moving, and he has bouts of agility when there is high emotion, but it is followed by asthmatic breathing and panting. Pantalone is often short and skinny. A lot of Pantalone&#x27;s comedy stems from the fact that his excitable actions greatly contradict the senile position that the actor takes. He often falls backwards, generally to bad news related in some way or another to his financials. When this occurs, he is often amusingly &quot;turtle-like&quot; and is often stuck in that position until assisted. Pantalone can do all of the movements of the other characters, but they are greatly hindered because of his old age. None of Pantalone&#x27;s physical actions should look easy, for his is truly &quot;the oldest of the old&quot;. In the well-known &quot;all the world&#x27;s a stage&quot; speech in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;As You Like It&quot; (II, vii), Jacques describes the second-last stage of life as &quot;the lean and slippered pantaloon&quot;.

===Costume===
Pantalone&#x27;s costume was designed with the inappropriateness intended to comically entertain. The costume for Pantalone is characterized by the use of red for almost the entire costume. The characteristics of the costume also include a Greek style hat, a jacket, a pair of long trousers or breeches with stockings, a tight jacket, a woollen skullcap, a robe or cape, a prominent codpiece or strategically placed coin purse, a black and red robe and yellow Turkish slippers. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, a sword or dagger and gold medallion often accompanied the purse. The Pantalone mask is a half-mask with accents on bony structure, big, bushy eyebrows, a long, hooked nose, a mustache, and a long, pointed or forked beard. He occasionally is noted as having horn spectacles. He occasionally carries a walking stick, but it is used more as an aggravating weapon than an actual walking tool. Because of his skinny legs, Pantalone is often portrayed wearing trousers rather than knee-breeches (which Jacques refers to as &quot;his youthful hose, well sav&#x27;d, a world too wide/For his shrunk shank&quot;). He therefore became the origin of the name of a type of trouser called &quot;pantaloons&quot;, which was later shortened to &quot;pants&quot;.

==Related==
Angela Carter&#x27;s &quot;The Bloody Chamber&quot; (in the short story &quot;Puss in Boots&quot;) gives another representation of Pantalone. The interpretation uses the spelling &#x27;Pantaloon&#x27;, but he follows a very similar description and ends up dead.

<doc id="45368" wikidata="Q313246" url="?curid=45368" title="David Foster Wallace">
<text>David Foster Wallace (February 21, 1962 – September 12, 2008) was an American novelist, short story writer, essayist, and university professor of English and creative writing. Wallace&#x27;s 1996 novel &quot;Infinite Jest&quot; was cited by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as one of the 100 best English-language novels from 1923 to 2005. His posthumous novel, &quot;The Pale King&quot; (2011), was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 2012. David Ulin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called Wallace &quot;one of the most influential and innovative writers of the last twenty years&quot;.

Wallace grew up in Illinois and attended Amherst College and the University of Arizona in Tucson, where he earned his MFA. He taught English at Emerson College, Illinois State University, and Pomona College. After struggling with depression for many years, he died by suicide in 2008, at age 46.

==Early life and education==
David Foster Wallace was born in Ithaca, New York, to Sally Jean Wallace (&quot;&quot; Foster) and James Donald Wallace. The family moved to Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, where he was raised along with his younger sister, Amy Wallace-Havens. His father was a philosophy professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. His mother was an English professor at Parkland College, a community college in Champaign, which recognized her work with a &quot;Professor of the Year&quot; award in 1996. From fourth grade, Wallace lived with his family in Urbana, where he attended Yankee Ridge Elementary School, Brookens Junior High School and Urbana High School. 

As an adolescent, Wallace was a regionally ranked junior tennis player. He wrote about this period in the essay &quot;Derivative Sport in Tornado Alley&quot;, originally published in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; as &quot;Tennis, Trigonometry, Tornadoes&quot;. Although his parents were atheists, Wallace twice attempted to join the Catholic Church, but &quot;flunk[ed] the period of inquiry&quot;. He later attended a Mennonite church.

Wallace attended Amherst College, his father&#x27;s alma mater, where he majored in English and philosophy and graduated &quot;summa cum laude&quot; in 1985. Among other extracurricular activities, he participated in glee club; his sister recalls that he &quot;had a lovely singing voice&quot;. In studying philosophy, Wallace pursued modal logic and mathematics, and presented in 1985 a senior thesis in philosophy and modal logic that was awarded the Gail Kennedy Memorial Prize and posthumously published as &quot;Fate, Time, and Language: An Essay on Free Will&quot; (2010).

Wallace adapted his honors thesis in English as the manuscript of his first novel, &quot;The Broom of the System&quot; (1987), and committed to being a writer. He told David Lipsky: &quot;Writing &quot;The Broom of the System&quot;, I felt like I was using 97 percent of me, whereas philosophy was using 50 percent.&quot; Wallace completed a Master of Fine Arts degree in creative writing at the University of Arizona in 1987. He moved to Massachusetts to attend graduate school in philosophy at Harvard University, but soon left the program.

== Later life ==

In 2002, Wallace met the painter Karen L. Green, whom he married on December 27, 2004.
Wallace struggled with depression, alcoholism, drug addiction, and suicidal tendencies, and was repeatedly hospitalized for psychiatric care. In 1989, he spent four weeks at McLean Hospital—a psychiatric institute in Belmont, Massachusetts, affiliated with Harvard Medical School—where he completed a drug and alcohol detoxification program. He later said his time there changed his life.

Dogs were important to Wallace, and he spoke of opening a shelter for stray canines. According to his friend Jonathan Franzen, he &quot;had a predilection for dogs who&#x27;d been abused, and [were] unlikely to find other owners who were going to be patient enough for them&quot;.

===Abuse allegations===

In the early 1990s, Wallace was in a relationship with writer Mary Karr. She later described Wallace as obsessive about her and said the relationship was volatile, with Wallace once throwing a coffee table at her as well as physically forcing her out of a car, leaving her to walk home. In 2018, she alleged that Wallace&#x27;s biographer D. T. Max underreported Wallace&#x27;s abuse. Of Max&#x27;s account of their relationship, she tweeted: &quot;That&#x27;s about 2% of what happened.&quot; She said that Wallace kicked her, climbed up the side of her house at night, and followed her five-year-old son home from school. Wallace also attempted to buy a gun to kill Karr&#x27;s ex-husband. In a 2015 interview, Karr said: &quot;I&#x27;m not the only woman he was violent with. It was—it&#x27;s common knowledge among women who dated him, you know, that he was violent.&quot; Since publicizing Wallace&#x27;s abuse, Karr says women (including his former students) have contacted her to share stories of Wallace hitting, lying to, and preying on them.

==Work==
===Career===
&quot;The Broom of the System&quot; (1987) garnered national attention and critical praise. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Caryn James called it a &quot;manic, human, flawed extravaganza ... emerging straight from the excessive tradition of Stanley Elkin&#x27;s &quot;The Franchiser&quot;, Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s &quot;V.&quot;, [and] John Irving&#x27;s &quot;World According to Garp&quot;&quot;.
In 1991, Wallace began teaching literature as an adjunct professor at Emerson College in Boston. The next year, at the suggestion of colleague and supporter Steven Moore, Wallace obtained a position in the English department at Illinois State University. He had begun work on his second novel, &quot;Infinite Jest&quot;, in 1991, and submitted a draft to his editor in December 1993. After the publication of excerpts throughout 1995, the book was published in 1996.

In 1997, Wallace received a MacArthur Fellowship. He also received the Aga Khan Prize for Fiction, awarded by editors of &quot;The Paris Review&quot; for one of the stories in &quot;Brief Interviews with Hideous Men&quot;, which had been published in the magazine.

In 2002, Wallace moved to Claremont, California, to become the first Roy E. Disney endowed Professor of Creative Writing and Professor of English at Pomona College. He taught one or two undergraduate courses per semester and focused on writing.

Wallace delivered the commencement address to the 2005 graduating class at Kenyon College. The speech was published as a book, &quot;This Is Water&quot;, in 2009. In May 2013, parts of the speech were used in a popular online video, also titled &quot;This Is Water&quot;.

Bonnie Nadell was Wallace&#x27;s literary agent during his entire career. Michael Pietsch was his editor on &quot;Infinite Jest&quot;.

Wallace died in 2008. In March 2009, Little, Brown and Company announced that it would publish the manuscript of an unfinished novel, &quot;The Pale King&quot;, that Wallace had been working on before his death. Pietsch pieced the novel together from pages and notes Wallace left behind. Several excerpts were published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and other magazines. &quot;The Pale King&quot; was published on April 15, 2011, and received generally positive reviews. Michiko Kakutani of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;The Pale King&quot; &quot;showcases [Wallace&#x27;s] embrace of discontinuity; his fascination with both the meta and the microscopic, postmodern pyrotechnics and old-fashioned storytelling; and his ongoing interest in contemporary America&#x27;s obsession with self-gratification and entertainment.&quot; The book was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize.

Throughout his career, Wallace published short fiction in periodicals such as &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;GQ&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, &quot;Playboy&quot;, &quot;The Paris Review&quot;, &quot;Mid-American Review&quot;, &quot;Conjunctions&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;Open City&quot;, &quot;Puerto del Sol&quot;, and &quot;Timothy McSweeney&#x27;s Quarterly Concern&quot;.

===Themes and styles===
Wallace wanted to progress beyond the irony and metafiction associated with postmodernism and explore a post-postmodern or metamodern style. In the essay &quot;E Unibus Pluram: Television and U.S. Fiction&quot; (written 1990, published 1993), he proposed that television has an ironic influence on fiction, and urged literary authors to eschew TV&#x27;s shallow rebelliousness: 
Wallace used many forms of irony, but tended to focus on individual persons&#x27; continued longing for earnest, unself-conscious experience and communication in a media-saturated society.

Wallace&#x27;s fiction combines narrative modes and authorial voices that incorporate jargon and invented vocabulary, such as self-generated abbreviations and acronyms, long, multi-clause sentences, and an extensive use of explanatory endnotes and footnotes, as in &quot;Infinite Jest&quot; and the story &quot;Octet&quot; (collected in &quot;Brief Interviews with Hideous Men&quot;), and most of his non-fiction after 1996. In a 1997 interview on &quot;Charlie Rose&quot;, Wallace said that the notes were to disrupt the linear narrative, to reflect his perception of reality without jumbling the narrative structure, and that he could have jumbled the sentences &quot;but then no one would read it&quot;.

D. T. Max has described Wallace&#x27;s work as an &quot;unusual mixture of the cerebral and the hot-blooded&quot;, often featuring multiple protagonists and spanning different locations in a single work. His writing comments on the fragmentation of thought, the relationship between happiness and boredom, and the psychological tension between the beauty and hideousness of the human body. According to Wallace, &quot;fiction&#x27;s about what it is to be a fucking human being&quot;, and he said he wanted to write &quot;morally passionate, passionately moral fiction&quot; that could help the reader &quot;become less alone inside&quot;. In his Kenyon College commencement address, Wallace described the human condition as daily crises and chronic disillusionment and warned against succumbing to solipsism, invoking the existential values of compassion and mindfulness:

===Nonfiction===
Wallace covered Senator John McCain&#x27;s 2000 presidential campaign and the September 11 attacks for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;; cruise ships (in what became the title essay of his first nonfiction book), state fairs, and tornadoes for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;; the US Open tournament for &quot;Tennis&quot; magazine; Roger Federer for &quot;The New York Times&quot;; the director David Lynch and the pornography industry for &quot;Première&quot; magazine; the tennis player Michael Joyce for &quot;Esquire&quot;; the movie-special-effects industry for &quot;Waterstone&#x27;s&quot; magazine; conservative talk radio host John Ziegler for &quot;The Atlantic&quot;; and a Maine lobster festival for &quot;Gourmet&quot; magazine. He also reviewed books in several genres for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;. In the November 2007 issue of &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, which commemorated the magazine&#x27;s 150th anniversary, Wallace was among the authors, artists, politicians and others who wrote short pieces on &quot;the future of the American idea&quot;.

These and other essays appear in three collections, &quot;A Supposedly Fun Thing I&#x27;ll Never Do Again&quot;, &quot;Consider the Lobster&quot; and the posthumous &quot;Both Flesh and Not&quot;, the last of which contains some of Wallace&#x27;s earliest work, including his first published essay, &quot;Fictional Futures and the Conspicuously Young&quot;. Wallace&#x27;s tennis writing was compiled into a volume titled &quot;String Theory: David Foster Wallace on Tennis&quot;, published in 2016.
Some writers have found parts of Wallace&#x27;s nonfiction implausible. Jonathan Franzen has said that he believes Wallace made up dialogue and incidents: &quot;those things didn&#x27;t actually happen&quot;. Of the essays &quot;Shipping Out&quot; and &quot;Ticket to the Fair&quot;, John Cook has remarked that in Wallace&#x27;s nonfiction: Wallace encounters pitch-perfect characters who speak comedically crystalline lines and place him in hilariously absurd situations...I used both stories [when teaching journalism] as examples of the inescapable temptation to shave, embellish, and invent narratives.

==Death==
Wallace&#x27;s father said that David had suffered from major depressive disorder for more than 20 years and that antidepressant medication had allowed him to be productive. Wallace suffered what was believed to be a severe interaction of the medication with the food he had eaten one day at a restaurant, and in June 2007, on his doctor&#x27;s advice, he stopped taking phenelzine, his primary antidepressant drug. His depression recurred, and he tried other treatments, including electroconvulsive therapy. Eventually he went back on phenelzine but found it ineffective. On September 12, 2008, at age 46, Wallace wrote a private two-page suicide note to his wife, arranged part of the manuscript for &quot;The Pale King&quot;, and hanged himself on the back porch of his house in Claremont, California.

Memorial gatherings were held at Pomona College, Amherst College, the University of Arizona, Illinois State University, and on October 23, 2008, at New York University (NYU). The eulogists at NYU included his sister, Amy Wallace-Havens; his literary agent, Bonnie Nadell; Gerry Howard, editor of his first two books; Colin Harrison, an editor at &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;; Michael Pietsch, editor of &quot;Infinite Jest&quot; and later works; Deborah Treisman, fiction editor at &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine; and the writers Don DeLillo, Zadie Smith, George Saunders, Mark Costello, Donald Antrim, and Jonathan Franzen.

== Legacy ==
In March 2010, it was announced that Wallace&#x27;s personal papers and archives—drafts of books, stories, essays, poems, letters, and research, including the handwritten notes for &quot;Infinite Jest&quot;—had been purchased by the University of Texas at Austin. They are held at that university&#x27;s Harry Ransom Center.

Since 2011, Loyola University New Orleans has offered English seminar courses on Wallace. Similar courses have also been taught at Harvard University. The first David Foster Wallace Conference was hosted by the Illinois State University Department of English in May 2014; the second was held in May 2015.

In January 2017, the International David Foster Wallace Society and the &quot;Journal of David Foster Wallace Studies&quot; were launched.

Among the writers who have cited Wallace as an influence are Dave Eggers, Jonathan Franzen, Rivka Galchen, Matthew Gallaway, David Gordon, John Green, Porochista Khakpour, George Saunders, Michael Schur, Zadie Smith, Darin Strauss, Deb Olin Unferth, Elizabeth Wurtzel, and Charles Yu.

===Adaptations===
====Film and television====
A feature-length film adaptation of &quot;Brief Interviews with Hideous Men&quot;, directed by John Krasinski with an ensemble cast, was released in 2009 and premiered at the Sundance Film Festival.

The 19th episode of the 23rd season of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;A Totally Fun Thing Bart Will Never Do Again&quot; (2012), is loosely based on Wallace&#x27;s essay &quot;Shipping Out&quot; from his 1997 collection, &quot;A Supposedly Fun Thing I&#x27;ll Never Do Again&quot;. The Simpson family takes a cruise, and Wallace appears in the background of a scene, wearing a tuxedo T-shirt while eating in the ship&#x27;s dining room. 

The 2015 film &quot;The End of the Tour&quot; is based on conversations David Lipsky had with Wallace, transcribed in &quot;Although of Course You End Up Becoming Yourself&quot; (2010). Jason Segel played Wallace, and Jesse Eisenberg played Lipsky. The film won an Audience Award for Best Narrative Feature at the Sarasota Film Festival, and Segel was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Male Lead.

&quot;Partridge&quot;, a Season 5 episode of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot;, repeatedly references &quot;Infinite Jest&quot;, of which the show&#x27;s co-creator, Michael Schur, is a noted fan. Schur also directed the music video for The Decemberists&#x27; &quot;Calamity Song&quot;, which depicts the Eschaton game from &quot;Infinite Jest.&quot;

==== Stage and music adaptations====
Twelve of the interviews from &quot;Brief Interviews with Hideous Men&quot; were adapted as a stage play in 2000 by Dylan McCullough. This was the first theatrical adaptation of Wallace&#x27;s work. The play, &quot;Hideous Men&quot;, was also directed by McCullough, and premiered at the New York International Fringe Festival in August 2000.

&quot;Brief Interviews&quot; was also adapted by director Marc Caellas as a play, &quot;Brief Interviews with Hideous Writers&quot;, which premiered at Fundación Tomás Eloy Martinez in Buenos Aires on November 4, 2011. In 2012 it was adapted as a play by artist Andy Holden for a two-night run at the ICA in London.

The short story &quot;Tri-Stan: I Sold Sissee Nar to Ecko&quot;, from &quot;Brief Interviews with Hideous Men&quot;, was adapted by composer Eric Moe into a 50-minute operatic piece, to be performed with accompanying video projections. The piece was described as having &quot;subversively inscribed classical music into pop culture&quot;.

&quot;Infinite Jest&quot; was performed once as a stage play by Germany&#x27;s experimental theater Hebbel am Ufer. The play was staged in various locations throughout Berlin, and the action took place over a 24-hour period.

&quot;Good Old Neon&quot;, from &quot;&quot;, was adapted and performed by Ian Forester at the 2011 Hollywood Fringe Festival, produced by the Los Angeles independent theater company Needtheater.

The song &quot;Surrounded by Heads and Bodies&quot;, from the album &quot;A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships&quot; by The 1975, borrows its title from the opening line of &quot;Infinite Jest&quot;. Matty Healy, The 1975&#x27;s lead singer, said in an interview with &quot;Pitchfork&quot; that he was inspired by the novel after reading it during a stint in rehabilitation:

<text>The Garonne ( , ; Catalan, Basque and , ; 
or ) is a river that flows in southwest France and northern Spain. It flows from the central Spanish Pyrenees to the Gironde estuary at the French port of Bordeaux – a length of , of which is in Spain (Val d&#x27;Aran); the total length extends to if one includes the Gironde estuary between the river and the sea. Its basin area is , which increases to if the Dordogne River, which flows from the east and joins the Garonne at Bec d&#x27;Ambès to form the Gironde estuary, is included.

Umayyad and Aquitanian forces fought the Battle of the River Garonne in 732 beside the river near present-day Bordeaux.

==Etymology==
The name derives from &quot;Garumna&quot;, a Latinized version of the Aquitanian name meaning &quot;stony river&quot; (&quot;kar&quot; relating to &quot;stone&quot; and &quot;-ona&quot; relating to &quot;river&quot;).

==Geography==

===Sources===


The Garonne&#x27;s headwaters are to be found in the Aran Valley in the Spanish Pyrenees, though three different locations have been proposed as the true source: the &quot;Uelh deth Garona&quot; at Plan de Beret (), the Ratera-Saboredo cirque ), or the slopes of Pic Aneto (Salterillo-Barrancs ravine according to the season).

The &quot;Uelh deth Garona&quot; at above sea level has been traditionally considered as the source of the Garonne. From this point a brook (called the &quot;Beret-Garona&quot;) runs for to the bed of the main upper Garonne valley. The river runs for another to the French border at &quot;Pont de Rei&quot;, in total.

The Ratera-Saboredo cirque is the head of the upper Garonne valley, and its upper lake at above sea level is the origin of the Ruda-Garona river, running for to the confluence with the Beret-Garona brook and another to the French border at &quot;Pont del Rei&quot;, in total. At the confluence, the Ruda-Garona carries of water. The Ratera-Saboredo cirque is considered by many researchers to be the origin of the Garonne.

The third theory holds that the river rises on the slopes of Pic Aneto at above sea level and flows by way of a sinkhole known as the &quot;Forau de Aigualluts&quot; () through the limestone of the Tuca Blanca de Pomèro and a resurgence in the Val dera Artiga above the Aran Valley in the Spanish Pyrenees. This underground route was suggested by the geologist Ramond de Carbonnières in 1787 but there was no confirmation until 1931, when caver Norbert Casteret poured fluorescein dye into the flow and noted its emergence a few hours later away at &quot;Uelhs deth Joèu&quot; (&quot;Jove&#x27;s eyes&quot; ) in the Artiga de Lin on the other side of the mountain. From Aigualluts to the confluence with the main river at the bed of the upper Garonne valley at above sea level, the Joèu has run for (16 kilometres more to get to the French border), carrying of water, whilst the main river is carrying .

Despite the lack of universal agreement on definition for determining a stream&#x27;s source, the United States Geological Survey, the National Geographic Society and the Smithsonian Institution agree that a stream&#x27;s source should be considered as the most distant point (along watercourses from the river mouth) in the drainage basin from which water runs.

The Ratera-Saboredo cirque is the &quot;most distant point (along watercourses from the river mouth) in the drainage basin from which water runs&quot; and the source of the Garonne, according to the United States Geological Survey, the National Geographic Society and the Smithsonian Institution convention on determining a stream&#x27;s source.

===Course===
The Garonne follows the Aran Valley northwards into France, flowing via Toulouse and Agen towards Bordeaux, where it meets the Gironde estuary. The Gironde flows into the Atlantic Ocean (Bay of Biscay). Along its course, the Garonne is joined by three other major rivers: the Ariège, the Tarn, and the Lot. Just after Bordeaux, the Garonne meets the Dordogne at the Bec d&#x27;Ambès, forming the Gironde estuary, which after approximately empties into the Atlantic Ocean. Other tributaries include the Save and the Gers.

The Garonne is one of the few rivers in the world that exhibit a tidal bore. Surfers and jet skiers could ride the tidal bore at least as far as the village of Cambes, from the Atlantic, and even further upstream to Cadillac, although the tidal bore appears and disappears in response to changes in the channel bathymetry. In 2010 and 2012, some detailed field studies were conducted in the Garonne&#x27;s Arcins channel between Arcins Island and the right bank close to Lastrene township. A striking feature of the field data sets was the large and rapid fluctuations in turbulent velocities and turbulent stresses during the tidal bore and flood flow.

===European sea sturgeon conservation===

The European sea sturgeon (Acipenser sturio), also known as the Atlantic sturgeon or common sturgeon, is now a Critically Endangered species (IUCN) status. This species of sturgeon can reach a length of , weigh up to and reach an age of 100 years. Previously found on most coasts of Europe, it has now become so rare that it breeds only in the Garonne river basin in France. Conservation projects are under way to save this fish from extinction via species reintroduction from aquaculture, with the first releases having been made in 1995.

===Towns along the river===
* Aran Valley (Spain): Vielha, Bossòst
* Haute-Garonne (31): Saint-Gaudens, Muret, Toulouse
* Tarn-et-Garonne (82): Castelsarrasin

==Navigation==

The Garonne plays an important role in inland shipping. The river not only allows seagoing vessels to reach the port of Bordeaux but also forms part of the Canal des Deux Mers, linking the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean.

From the ocean, ships pass through the Gironde estuary up to the mouth of the Garonne (to the right of the Dordogne when sailing upstream). Ships continue on the tidal river Garonne up to the &quot;Pont de Pierre&quot; (stone bridge) in Bordeaux. Inland vessels continue upstream to Castets-en-Dorthe, where the Canal de Garonne joins the river. Prior to the building of the Canal lateral à la Garonne, between 1838 and 1856, shallow-draught boats used the Garonne itself as far as Toulouse. However, navigation on the upper river was very uncertain, and this stretch of the river is no longer considered navigable. Instead the lateral canal takes boats through 53 locks to the town of Toulouse, where the canal meets the Canal du Midi.

== Hydrography ==
The upstream part of the river, upstream from Toulouse depends primarily on snow and snow melt. The lower/downstream part is rain fed as well as its main tributaries.

The Garonne also feeds several channels/canals:

* The Saint-Martory canal – Saint-Martory water intake takes 10 m3/s from the river;
* The canal latéral à la Garonne – with the water intake in Toulouse by the Brienne canal.

SANDRE assigns to the Garonne a hydrographic identity number 0 --- 00000 and the generic code O --- 000014,15.

== Floods ==

A flood of the Garonne in 1930 broke the dike in Thivras (Marmande).

In Toulouse, the Garonne has been the cause of many floods, especially since its left bank is inhabited.

The earliest records of floods are from around 1177. It is also recorded to have flooded in 1220, 1258, 1430, 1523, 1536 and in 1589, 1608, 1658, 1673, 1675, 1709, 1712, 1727, 1750, 1772, 1788, 1804 and 1810. In 1772, the Garonne reached 8 meters 50. In the recent centuries, in 1827, 1835, 1855 and 1856/7.

In Toulouse, in 1827, the water level of the Garonne rose four meters above the ordinary level and filled the arches of the Pont de Pierre and Pont Neuf.

In 1835, the Garonne rose to five meters above normal and 35 meters above the low water level and flowed through the four arcs of the Pont de Pierre.

Flood of the Garonne in 1835: 7,50 m at Toulouse Pont-Neuf

Flood of the Garonne in 1855: 7.25 m at Toulouse Pont-Neuf

Flood of the Garonne in 1875: 9,70 m to Toulouse Pont-Neuf (or 8m32 according to vigicrue).

Flood of the Garonne in 1879: 4,87 m at Toulouse Pont-Neuf

Flood of the Garonne in 1890: 3.30 m at Toulouse Pont-Neuf

Flood of the Garonne in 1900: 4,00 m in Toulouse Pont-Neuf

Flood of the Garonne in 1905: 4.24 m at Toulouse Pont-Neuf

Crete of 1927 in Aquitaine, particularly imposing after the confluence of the Garonne with the Lot (of which it remained raw reference), insignificant upstream18.

Flood of the Garonne in 1952: 4,57 m at Toulouse Pont-Neuf

Flood of the Garonne in 1977: 4,31 m in Toulouse Pont-Neuf

Flood of the Garonne in 2000: 4.38 m at Toulouse Pont-Neuf

Flood of the Garonne in 2004: 3,52 m at Toulouse Pont-Neuf

In 1777, the Garonne suffered an extraordinary flood to the point that the priest of Bourdelles took the trouble to retranscribe the event, at the end of the acts of the year, in the parish register of baptisms, marriages and deaths.

== Future Water Resource Management ==
The &quot;Garonne 2050&quot; project, initiated by the Adour-Garonne water agency in 2010, aims to address the future challenges facing the Garonne River basin regarding its water resources. With an anticipated surge of an additional 1 million inhabitants by 2050, the basin confronts a demographic challenge. The study aims to inform stakeholders and devise an adaptation strategy within the local master plan of water management and development (SDAGE), considering the impact of the predicted demographic shifts.  Central to the &quot;Garonne 2050&quot; study is its examination of the Garonne River basin&#x27;s agricultural sector. Detailed insights into changes in irrigated agricultural areas, crop rotation, and farm numbers are essential for informing effective water management strategies. Notably, the allocation of water volume to agriculture highlights a delicate balance between sustaining local economic activities and the necessity for agricultural adaptation amid decreasing water availability.

<text>Toulouse (, ; ; ) is the prefecture of the French department of Haute-Garonne and of the larger region of Occitania. The city is on the banks of the River Garonne, from the Mediterranean Sea, from the Atlantic Ocean and from Paris. It is the fourth-largest city in France after Paris, Marseille and Lyon, with 511,684 inhabitants within its municipal boundaries (2022); its metropolitan area has a population of 1,513,396 inhabitants (2022). Toulouse is the central city of one of the 22 metropolitan councils of France. Between the 2014 and 2020 censuses, its metropolitan area was the third fastest growing among metropolitan areas larger than 500,000 inhabitants in France.

Toulouse is the centre of the European aerospace industry, with the headquarters of Airbus, the SPOT satellite system, ATR and the Aerospace Valley. It hosts the CNES&#x27;s Toulouse Space Centre (CST) which is the largest national space centre in Europe, but also, on the military side, the newly created NATO space centre of excellence and the French Space Command and Space Academy. Safran, Thales Alenia Space, Airbus Defence and Space, Collins Aerospace and Liebherr-Aerospace also have a significant presence in Toulouse.

The air route between Toulouse–Blagnac and the Parisian airports is the busiest in France, transporting 3.2 million passengers in 2019. According to the rankings of and &quot;Challenges&quot;, Toulouse is the most dynamic French city.

Founded by the Romans, the city was the capital of the Visigothic Kingdom in the 5th century and the capital of the province of Languedoc in the Late Middle Ages and early modern period (provinces were abolished during the French Revolution), making it the unofficial capital of the cultural region of Occitania (Southern France). It is now the capital of the administrative region of Occitania, the second largest region in Metropolitan France.

The University of Toulouse is one of the oldest in Europe (founded in 1229). Toulouse is also the home of prestigious higher education schools, notably in the field of aerospace engineering. Together with the university, they have turned Toulouse into the fourth-largest student city in France, with a university population of nearly 140,000 students.

Toulouse counts three UNESCO World Heritage Sites: the Canal du Midi (designated in 1996 and shared with other cities), and the Basilica of St. Sernin, the largest remaining Romanesque building in Europe, designated in 1998 along with the former hospital Hôtel-Dieu Saint-Jacques because of their significance to the Santiago de Compostela pilgrimage route. The city&#x27;s unique architecture made of pinkish terracotta bricks has earned Toulouse the nickname &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Pink city&quot;).

==Geography==
Toulouse is in the south of France, north of the department of Haute-Garonne, on the axis of communication between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. The city is about 80 km from the Pyrenees and the borders with Andorra and Spain.
===Hydrography===
The city is traversed by the Canal de Brienne, the Canal du Midi, the Canal de Garonne and the rivers Garonne, Touch and Hers-Mort.
===Climate===
Toulouse has a four-season humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot; in the Köppen climate classification). Too much precipitation during the summer months prevents the city from being classified in the Mediterranean climate zone.


==History==

===Early history===
The Garonne Valley was a central point for trade between the Pyrenees, the Mediterranean and the Atlantic since at least the Iron Age. The historical name of the city, &quot;Tolosa&quot; (Τολῶσσα in Greek, and of its inhabitants, the &quot;Tolosates&quot;, first recorded in the 2nd century BC), is of unknown meaning or origin, possibly from Aquitanian or Iberian, but it has also been connected to the name of the Gaulish Volcae Tectosages, or to the as Irish &quot;tulach&quot; or Welsh &quot;twlch&quot;, (little hill).

====Toulouse refounded by the Romans on the banks of the Garonne====
Tolosa enters the historical period in the 2nd century BC, when it became a Roman military outpost. After the conquest of Gaul, it was developed as a Roman city in Gallia Narbonensis. Under the reign of Emperor Augustus and thanks to the Pax Romana, the Romans moved the city a few kilometres from the hills where it was an &quot;oppidum&quot; to the banks of the Garonne, which were more suitable for trade.

In the second half of the 1st century, the emperor Domitian distinguished Toulouse by placing it under the patronage of the goddess Pallas Athena, so that the Latin poets Martial, Ausonius and Sidonius Apollinaris called the city &quot;Palladia Tolosa&quot; (Palladian Toulouse), a term that was still used in the Renaissance and even today when the city is presented as propitious to the arts and letters.

Around the year 250, Toulouse was marked by the martyrdom of Saturnin, the first bishop of Toulouse. This episode illustrates the difficult beginnings of Christianity in Roman Gaul.

====Capital of the Visigothic kingdom====
In the 5th century, Toulouse fell to the Visigothic kingdom and became one of its major cities, even serving as its capital, before it fell to the Franks under Clovis in 507 during the Battle of Vouillé. From that time, Toulouse was the capital of Aquitaine within the Frankish realm.

====Under Frankish rule====
In 721, Duke Odo of Aquitaine defeated an invading Umayyad Muslim army at the Battle of Toulouse. Many Arab chroniclers consider that Odo&#x27;s victory was the real stop to Muslim expansion into Christian Europe, incursions of the following years being simple raids without real will of conquest (including the one that ended with Charles Martel&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Tours, also called the Battle of Poitiers).

The Frankish conquest of Septimania followed in the 750s, and a quasi-independent County of Toulouse emerged within the Carolingian sub-kingdom of Aquitaine by the late 8th century. The Battle of Toulouse of 844, pitting Charles the Bald against Pepin II of Aquitaine, was key in the Carolingian Civil War.

===County of Toulouse===



Charlemagne had created the county of Toulouse in 778 to guard the border of Muslim Spain, but the disintegration of the kingdom of Aquitaine and the weakness of royal power in the following centuries led to the &quot;de facto&quot; independence of the county of Toulouse and many provinces.

In the 11th and 12th centuries, southern France was still steeped in Latin culture. Unlike the north of France, justice followed written Roman law and the nobles were highly educated. This was the time of the troubadours who wrote their poetry in Occitan (called &quot;Provençal&quot; at the time), then one of the most sophisticated languages in Europe. Like the other great lords of the Midi, the counts of Toulouse maintained and favoured these poets, this is how Count Raymond V employed for some time the famous Bernard de Ventadour, expert in singing courtly love.

In 1096, Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse, left with his army at the call of the Pope Urban II to join the First Crusade, of which he was one of the main leaders. This exodus of its warriors and nobles, reinforced by the creation of the faraway County of Tripoli by Raymond IV at the beginning of the 12th century, weakened the city militarily as well as the ascendancy that its counts had over it. The Duke William IX of Aquitaine challenged the possession of the city on the grounds that it should have been inherited by his wife Philippa (daughter of the previous count of Toulouse, whereas Raymond IV was only his brother). More than 50 years later his granddaughter Eleanor of Aquitaine still claimed the inheritance in vain.

In the 12th century the city left its Roman limits and a new district developed around the church of Saint-Sernin: the &quot;Bourg&quot;. The church of Saint-Sernin was famous and revered for its many relics, and the chapter of its canons, which had possessions as far away as Spain, was powerful enough to free itself from the control of the bishop of Toulouse. This dissent had important local political repercussions, making the &quot;Bourg&quot; in practice a separate district from the city. In 1152, the notables of Toulouse took advantage of a weakening of the county power to obtain for their city a great autonomy, they created a municipal body of consuls, called capitouls in Toulouse, to lead the city. The &quot;Bourg&quot;, which had only a quarter of the inhabitants of Toulouse, obtained as many capitouls as the rest of the city. Economically, Toulouse, which was at the center of a large cereal-growing plain, was distinguished by its numerous mills that took advantage of the force of the Garonne, among which the Bazacle Milling Company was the first recorded European joint-stock company.

==== The fight against Catharism and its various aspects ====
At the beginning of the thirteenth century the County of Toulouse was caught up in another crusade that would last twenty years (1209-1229), of which it was the target this time. The reason for this was the development of Catharism in the south of France, which the Pope Innocent III wanted to eradicate by all possible means.

After an initial victory of the crusaders led by Simon de Montfort who defeated the combined forces of Count Raymond VI of Toulouse and King Peter II of Aragon at the Battle of Muret, the following years saw the fate of the county of Toulouse swing alternately in favour of one party or the other. Finally, a late intervention by King Louis VIII of France in 1226 tipped the balance in favour of the crusaders, resulting in the submission of Count Raymond VII to the French Crown and the end of the independence of the County of Toulouse.

But beyond the military crusade, this struggle took on several important aspects for the city of Toulouse:
* The Dominican Order was founded in Toulouse by Saint Dominic in 1215. Spanish priest Dominic de Guzmán wanted to convert the Cathars to Catholicism peacefully, by preaching and by living a poor and exemplary life. After years of criss-crossing the Lauraguais countryside between Carcassonne and Toulouse, he changed his method and decided to preach in town. In 1215 he settled in Toulouse and founded a mendicant order which, within a few decades, would cover Europe with hundreds of convents: The Order of Preachers, also known as the Dominicans.
* Under the impulse of the bishop of Toulouse, Foulques, an original and austere architectural style was born in Toulouse, designed to break with the display of luxury of the Catholic church which drove the faithful towards the Cathars: the Southern French Gothic.
* In the Treaty of Paris of 1229, Toulouse formally submitted to the crown of France. The county&#x27;s sole heiress Joan was engaged to Alphonse, Count of Poitiers, a younger brother of Louis IX of France. The marriage became legal in 1241, but it remained childless and so after Joan&#x27;s death, the county fell to the Crown of France by inheritance.
* Another consequence of the Treaty of Paris was the creation of the University of Toulouse, established on the Parisian model, strongly sponsored by the pope and intended as a means to dissolve the heretic movement.
* Also in 1229, the Council of Toulouse was held, which laid the foundations for the long period of Inquisition that was to eradicate Catharism in the region after the military victory of the Crusade.

===Kingdom of France===
In 1271, Joan of Toulouse and her husband Alphonse of Poitiers died without heirs. Toulouse, which since the treaty of 1229 had been subordinate to the kingdom of France, no longer had a count and was annexed to the royal domain. The installation of numerous royal officers and the development of trade and crafts, which favoured the social ascension of merchants, renewed the city&#x27;s elites. In 1298, King Philip the Fair greatly facilitated the possibility of ennobling the capitouls, whose council, renewed every year, was increasingly made up of rich merchants.

The first half of the 14th century was a prosperous period, despite the dismemberment in 1317 of the very large bishopric of Toulouse (which lost two thirds of its area and a large part of its income, a loss only partially compensated by its elevation to the rank of archbishopric), and the episode of the Shepherds&#x27; Crusade which brought a pogrom against Toulouse&#x27;s Jewish population in 1320. In 1335, Toulouse had between 35,000 and 40,000 inhabitants.

In 1323, the &quot;Consistori del Gay Saber&quot; was created in Toulouse to preserve the lyric art of the troubadours by organizing a poetry contest; and Toulouse became the centre of Occitan literary culture for the following centuries. The &quot;Consistori&quot; is considered to be the oldest literary society in Europe, at the origin of one of the most sophisticated treatise on grammar and rhetoric of the Middle Ages, and in 1694 it was transformed into the Royal Academy of the Floral Games (&quot;Académie des Jeux Floraux&quot;), still active today, by king Louis XIV.

The 14th century also saw a significant increase in the influence of the University of Toulouse, particularly following the move of the papacy from Rome to Avignon. Many law graduates from the University of Toulouse had brilliant careers in the Avignon curia, several became cardinals and three became popes: John XXII, Innocent VI and Urban V. These powerful prelates financed the establishment of colleges in the university towns of southern France, not only Toulouse but also Montpellier, Cahors and Avignon.

The Black Death in 1348, then the Hundred Years&#x27; War caused a major crisis that lasted until the following century. Despite strong immigration, the population lost more than 10,000 inhabitants in 70 years. By 1405 Toulouse had only 19,000 people. In these hardships, the city was the key stronghold of the French defence in the south of France during the worst years of the Hundred Years&#x27; War, when the English troops from Aquitaine had taken Montauban and only Toulouse remained as an obstacle to their conquest of southern France. This military threat to the city and especially to the surrounding countryside was not conducive to its development, despite the strengthening of ties with the royalty that it entailed.

In 1369, pope Urban V attributed to the Dominican church of the Jacobins of Toulouse the bones of the Dominican theologian Saint Thomas Aquinas, perhaps to honor the city that had been the cradle of the Dominican order at the beginning of the previous century.

The political and economic situation improved by the middle of the 15th century. In 1443 King Charles VII established the second parliament of France after that of Paris. Reinforcing its place as an administrative and judicial center, the city grew richer, participating in the trade of Bordeaux wine with England, as well as cereals and textiles. A major source of income was the production and export of &quot;pastel&quot;, a blue dye made from woad.

Toulouse suffered several fires, but it was in 1463 that the Great Fire of Toulouse broke out, ravaging the city for fifteen days. After this dramatic event, King Louis XIII exempted the city from taxes for 100 years. The capitouls issued municipal decrees favouring the use of brick in buildings, rather than excessively flammable wood or cob.

In the 16th century, and until 1562, the economy of Toulouse experienced a golden age: its Parliament made it the judicial capital of a large part of southern France, and the city became the first European centre for the trade in woad, the only blue dye then known in Europe which was very much in demand in the textile industry at the time. Its humanist milieu developed thanks to its university and parliament, which trained and attracted intellectual elites. The wealth generated by this culturally and economically dynamic environment is the source of the superb Renaissance mansions in Toulouse. In 1550 the population of the city made it the second or third largest city in France. It was estimated to have 50,000 inhabitants, a figure it would not regain until the 18th century.

In 1562, the French Wars of Religion began and Toulouse became an ultra-Catholic stronghold in a predominantly Protestant region, the era of economic prosperity came to an end. The governor of Languedoc, Henri II de Montmorency, who had rebelled, was executed in 1632 in the Capitole in the presence of King Louis XIII and Cardinal Richelieu.

In 1666, Pierre-Paul Riquet started the construction of the Canal du Midi which links Toulouse to the Mediterranean Sea, and is considered one of the greatest construction works of the 17th century. Completed in 1681, the canal stimulated the economy of Toulouse by promoting the export of cereals and the import of olive oil, wine and other goods from the Mediterranean regions.

In the 18th century, Toulouse was a provincial capital that prided itself on its royal academies (the only city in France, along with Paris, to have three royal academies), but sometimes seemed far removed from the debates of ideas that agitated the Enlightenment. A famous example illustrates this backwardness of Toulouse mentalities of the time: in 1762 its powerful parliament sentenced Jean Calas to death. The philosopher Voltaire then accused the Parlement of Toulouse of religious intolerance (Calas was a Protestant), gave the affair a European repercussion and succeeded in having the judgment of the parliament quashed by the King&#x27;s Council, which did much damage to the reputation of the parliament. It was on this occasion that Voltaire published one of his major philosophical works: his famous &quot;Treatise on Tolerance&quot;.

With the French Revolution of 1789 and the reform or suppression of all royal institutions, Toulouse lost much of its power and influence: until then the capital of the vast province of Languedoc, with a parliament ruling over an even larger territory, the city then found itself simply at the head of the single small department of Haute-Garonne.

===19th century===
On 10 April 1814, four days after Napoleon&#x27;s surrender of the French Empire to the nations of the Sixth Coalition (a fact that the two armies involved were not yet aware of), the Battle of Toulouse pitted the Hispanic-British troops of Field Marshal Wellington against the French troops of Napoleonic Marshal Soult, who, although they managed to resist, were forced to withdraw. Toulouse was thus the scene of the last Franco-British battle on French territory.

Unlike most large French cities, there was no real industrial revolution in 19th century Toulouse. The most important industries were the gunpowder factory, to meet military needs, and the tobacco factory. In 1856 the railway arrived in Toulouse and the city was modernised: the ramparts were replaced by large boulevards, and major avenues such as the &quot;rue d&#x27;Alsace-Lorraine&quot; and the &quot;rue de Metz&quot; opened up the historic centre.

In 1875, a flood of the Garonne devastated more than 1,000 houses and killed 200 people. It also destroyed all the bridges in Toulouse, except the Pont-Neuf.

===20th and 21st centuries===

World War I brought to Toulouse (geographically sheltered from enemy attacks) chemical industries as well as aviation workshops (Latécoère, Dewoitine), which launched the city&#x27;s aeronautical construction tradition and gave birth after the war to the famous &quot;Aéropostale&quot;, a pioneering airmail company based in Toulouse and whose epics were popularised by the novels of writers such as Joseph Kessel and Antoine de Saint-Exupéry (himself an &quot;Aéropostale&quot; pilot).

In the 1920s and 1930s the rise of the Toulouse population was increased by the arrival of Italians and Spaniards fleeing the fascist regimes of their country. Then, in the early 1960s, French repatriates from Algeria swelled the city&#x27;s population.

In 1963, Toulouse was chosen to become one of the country&#x27;s eight &quot;balancing Metropolis&quot;, regaining a position among the country&#x27;s major cities that it had always had, but lost in the 19th century. The French state then encouraged the city&#x27;s specialisation in aeronautics and space activities, sectors that had experienced strong growth in recent decades, fueling economic and population growth.

On 21 September 2001, an explosion occurred at the AZF fertiliser factory, causing 31 deaths, about 30 seriously wounded and 2,500 light casualties. The blast measured 3.4 on the Richter scale and the explosion was heard away.

In 2016, a territorial reform made Toulouse the regional prefecture of Occitanie, the second largest region in metropolitan France, giving it a role commensurate with its past as a provincial capital among the most important in France.

==Population==
The population of the city proper (French: &quot;commune&quot;) was 511,684 as of January 2022, with 1,513,396 inhabitants in the metropolitan area, up from 1,268,438 at the January 2009 census. Thus, the metropolitan area registered a population growth rate of +1.63% per year between 2009 and 2021, the third-highest growth rate of any French metropolitan area larger than 500,000 inhabitants in France, after Montpellier and Bordeaux, although it was slightly lower than the growth rate registered between the 1990 and 2009 censuses. Toulouse is the fourth most populated city in France, after Paris, Marseille and Lyon, and the fifth most populated metropolitan area after Paris, Lyon, Marseille, and Lille. During the next census 2023 or 2024, the city of Toulouse should become the 3rd most populous city in France ahead of Lyon because its growth is stronger.

Fueled by booming aerospace and high-tech industries, the Toulouse metropolitan area&#x27;s population grew by 57.3% between the 1990 and 2020 censuses (within its 2020 borders), which means +1.52% per year on average during those 30 years, compared with a growth of 15.3% for metropolitan France between 1990 and 2020, i.e. +0.48% per year. This was the second-highest population growth of any French metropolitan area larger than 500,000 inhabitants (only the Montpellier metropolitan area grew more than Toulouse between 1990 and 2019).

The Toulouse metropolitan area reached 1,513,396 inhabitants in January 2022, and stood as the 5th most populated metropolitan area in France, behind the metropolitan areas of Paris, Lyon, Marseille, and Lille, but ahead of the metropolitan area of Bordeaux, which the Toulouse metropolitan area passed in population in the 1990s. During the next census 2023, the metropolitan area of Toulouse will become the 4th most populous in France ahead of Lille because its growth is stronger.

A local Jewish group estimates there are about 2,500 Jewish families in Toulouse. A Muslim association has estimated there are some 35,000 Muslims in town.

==Government and politics==

===Toulouse Métropole===
The Community of Agglomeration of Greater Toulouse (&quot;Communauté d&#x27;agglomération du Grand Toulouse&quot;) was created in 2001 to better coordinate transport, infrastructure and economic policies between the city of Toulouse and its immediate independent suburbs. It succeeds a previous district which had been created in 1992 with fewer powers than the current council. It combines the city of Toulouse and 24 independent &quot;communes&quot;, covering an area of , totalling a population of 583,229 inhabitants (as of 1999 census), 67% of whom live in the city of Toulouse proper. As of February 2004 estimate, the total population of the Community of Agglomeration of Greater Toulouse was 651,209 inhabitants, 65.5% of whom live in the city of Toulouse. Due to local political feuds, the Community of Agglomeration only hosts 61% of the population of the metropolitan area, the other independent suburbs having refused to join in. Since 2009, the Community of agglomeration has become an urban community (in French: communauté urbaine). This has become a métropole in 2015, spanning 37 communes with 806,503 inhabitants in 2020 census.

===Local politics===


One of the major political figures in Toulouse was Dominique Baudis, the mayor of Toulouse between 1983 and 2001, member of the centrist UDF. First known as a journalist known for his coverage of the war in Lebanon, 36-year-old Dominique Baudis succeeded his father Pierre Baudis in 1983 as mayor of Toulouse. (Pierre Baudis was mayor from 1971 to 1983.)

Baudis tried to strengthen the international role of Toulouse (such as its Airbus operations), as well as revive the cultural heritage of the city. The Occitan cross, flag of Languedoc and symbol of the counts of Toulouse, was chosen as the new flag of the city, instead of the traditional coat of arms of Toulouse (which included the fleur de lis of the French monarchy). Many cultural institutions were created, in order to attract foreign expatriates and emphasise the city&#x27;s past. For example, monuments dating from the time of the counts of Toulouse were restored, the city&#x27;s symphonic concert hall (&quot;Halle aux Grains&quot;) was refurbished, a city theater was built, a Museum of Modern Art was founded, the Bemberg Foundation (European paintings and bronzes from the Renaissance to the 20th century) was established, a huge pop music concert venue (&quot;Zénith&quot;, the largest in France outside Paris) was built, the space museum and educational park &quot;Cité de l&#x27;Espace&quot; was founded, etc.

To deal with growth, major housing and transportation projects were launched. Line A of the underground was opened in 1993, and line B opened in 2007. The creation of a system of underground car parking structures in Toulouse city centre was sharply criticised by the Green Party.

In 2000, Dominique Baudis was at the zenith of his popularity, with approval rates of 85%. He announced that he would not run for a fourth (6-year) term in 2001. He explained that with 3 terms he was already the longest-serving mayor of Toulouse since the French Revolution; he felt that change would be good for the city, and that the number of terms should be limited. He endorsed Philippe Douste-Blazy, then UDF mayor of Lourdes as his successor. Baudis has since been appointed president of the CSA (&quot;Conseil supérieur de l&#x27;audiovisuel&quot;) in Paris, the French equivalent of the American FCC.

Philippe Douste-Blazy narrowly won in the 2001 elections, which saw the left making its best showing in decades. Douste-Blazy had to deal with a reinvigorated political opposition, as well as with the dramatic explosion of the AZF plant in late 2001.

In March 2004, he entered the national government, and left Toulouse in the hands of his second-in-command Jean-Luc Moudenc, elected mayor by the municipal council. In March 2008, Moudenc was defeated by the Socialist Party&#x27;s candidate Pierre Cohen.

At the next elections in 2014 Moudenc defeated Cohen in a rematch to re-take the job with more than 52% of the votes, and he was re-elected with almost the same score in 2020.

==Sights and architecture==
Classified &quot;City of Art and History&quot;, Toulouse has a very rich architectural heritage ranging from large Romanesque and Gothic churches to neo-classical facades such as that of the Capitole, to the prestigious mansions of the Renaissance. This ancient heritage is mainly enclosed within the 220 hectares of the city&#x27;s inner boulevard (one of the largest protected urban areas in France).

Almost all the buildings of the historical centre were made with the traditional building material of the region: the &quot;foraine&quot; brick that has earned the city the nickname of &quot;Ville rose&quot; (Pink city). Medieval heir to the Roman brick, the &quot;foraine&quot; brick is characterised by its large dimensions, its flat appearance and its colour ranging from orange/pink to red.

White stone is also present in smaller quantities. As there were no stone quarries near Toulouse, it was transported from the Pyrenees via the Garonne river and was for a long time rare and therefore expensive, considered in Toulouse as a luxury material. However, it is enough to give Toulouse&#x27;s architecture one of its characteristics: red/white polychromy.

===Romanesque architecture (11th-12th c.)===
The Romanesque architecture of Toulouse is largely dominated by the presence of the Basilica of Saint-Sernin, one of the most important churches of its time in Europe, and fortunate enough to keep its Romanesque character virtually intact.

====Basilica of Saint-Sernin====
Basilica of Saint-Sernin, part of the Way of Saint James UNESCO World Heritage Site, was also in itself a major place of pilgrimage. It is one of the two largest surviving Romanesque churches in Europe. With more than two hundred relics (including that of Saint Saturnin who gave his name to the church), many of which were donated by Charlemagne to the shrine that preceded the present church, Saint-Sernin is the church with the most relics after Saint Peter of Rome.

Conceived from the outset as a gigantic reliquary, the church was mainly built at the end of the 11th century and at the beginning of the 12th century to welcome the crowds of pilgrims, its double-sided aisles and the ambulatory surrounding the apse make it the archetype of the great pilgrimage church, where pilgrims could make the circuit around the church and were able to stop for meditation and prayer at the apsidal chapels of the transept and the radiating chapels of the choir. The church is also particularly noteworthy for the quality of its Romanesque sculptures, including numerous capitals and the historiated tympanum of the Miègeville gate, one of the first of its kind.

===Gothic architecture (13th c.-early 16th c.)===

====Southern French Gothic: a militant religious architecture====
At the beginning of the 13th century, the Catholic clergy of the South of France, seeing a growing number of the faithful turning to the Catharism which advocated a more pious austerity, showed the will to correct the defects of the Catholic Church which indulged in luxury. Under the impulse of the bishop of Toulouse, Foulques, an austere and militant architectural style was born with the reconstruction of the Cathedral of Toulouse: the Southern French Gothic. Conceived according to an ideal of poverty and humility to bring the faithful together in a single, vast nave to facilitate preaching, this architectural style then developed during the 13th century in the grand mendicant convents of the city, before spreading in the 14th century to a large number of churches and cathedrals in the region.

Several churches or convents in Toulouse belong to this architectural trend, but two of them are particularly symbolic and remarkable:

* Cathedral of Saint-Étienne (Saint Stephen) is the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Toulouse. Its construction, which was mainly done at the beginning and then at the end of the 13th century, reflects the history of this decisive century which saw the city lose its independence to become a French city. The single nave is the first example of Southern French Gothic, at 19 metres wide it probably was at its completion the widest in Western Europe (1210-1220). The higher choir that adjoins it was built in the Gothic style of northern France shortly after the city became part of the Crown of France in 1271.
* Convent of the Jacobins (13th century / early 14th century) was the Dominican convent of Toulouse and is considered to be, together with the Albi Cathedral, the pinnacle of Southern French Gothic architecture. Like all Southern French Gothic churches it has a deliberately austere exterior, but on the inside its alignment of cylindrical columns form one of the tallest colonnades ever erected in Gothic architecture (28 metres high). The masterpiece of this church is the column that closes the choir (1275-1292), its palm tree shape was a hundred years ahead of the flamboyant gothic fan vaults. Because he thought that the bones of Saint Thomas Aquinas deserved «the most beautiful and most splendid surroundings», in 1368 Pope Urban V made the church of the Jacobins the burial place of the famous Dominican friar, one of the most notable philosophers and theologians of the Middle Ages.

====Gothic civil architecture====
Toulouse has preserved about thirty Gothic stair towers (plus a dozen Renaissance or later towers), the remains of private mansions (called &quot;hôtels particuliers&quot;) from the Middle Ages and the early 16th century. Often hidden in courtyards, some of these towers are high enough to exceed their function of serving the floors and display the ambition of their owners.

At a time when most of the houses in Toulouse were built in wood or cob, the brick construction of these towers and &quot;hôtels&quot; also testifies to their quality.

===Renaissance architecture (16th c.-early 17th c.)===

In the 16th century, Toulouse experienced a golden age coinciding with the Renaissance in France. The woad trade (&quot;pastel&quot;) brought merchants of international stature to the city, and the Parlement of Toulouse made the city the judicial capital of a large part of the south of France. These wealthy elites had private mansions built, remarkable for their architecture inspired by architectural treatises such as those of Serlio, Alberti or Vitruvius, but also by the royal castles of the Loire Valley and the Île-de-France.

Renowned for the quality of their architecture, the private mansions of the Toulouse Renaissance that have survived to the present day were built over more than a century (around 1515–1620) by reputed architects such as Louis Privat, Nicolas Bachelier, Dominique Bachelier or Pierre Souffron. The most famous of these &quot;hôtels&quot; are those of Assézat, Bernuy, Vieux-Raisin or Clary...


===17th century architecture===

====17th century religious architecture====
The French Wars of Religion, which started in the second half of the 16th century, brought to the city many religious orders who came to seek asylum in this solid Catholic bastion. They had baroque churches built in the 17th century: among them, the Order of Carthusians, expelled by the Protestants from the region of Castres, founded the church of Saint-Pierre des Chartreux, the order of the Discalced Carmelites built the church of Saint-Exupère, the blue penitents founded the church of Saint-Jérôme and the order of Carmelite nuns created a convent of which a remarkable painted chapel remains.

====17th century civil architecture====
After the Renaissance, the decorations in civil architecture became less numerous and ostentatious, due to the importance given to the moderation of the architectural structures and the development of interior decorations. The play of colours (between brick and stone) and reliefs (bossing) were less costly and nevertheless effective solutions for livening up facades. The 17th century is the century that gave Toulouse the largest number of its private mansions, most of them built by members of parliament.

===18th century architecture===
In the 18th century Toulouse made its living from its Parliament and from the wheat and corn trade, which was boosted by the creation of the Canal du Midi at the end of the previous century. Among the major architectural achievements, the most notable were undoubtedly the construction of the quays of the Garonne and the new facade of the Capitole (1750-1760), designed by architect Guillaume Cammas.

In the last third of the 18th century, the ever increasing influence of the Parisian model meant that red brick was no longer popular: the city facades were then whitewashed to imitate stone. This is why nowadays, even though the white paint has generally been removed, there are walls with deep grooves carved in brick to imitate ashlar architecture.

===19th century architecture===
Toulouse&#x27;s 19th century architecture can be divided into three periods, which sometimes overlapped. In the first half of the century, at the instigation of architect Jacques-Pascal Virebent, the main architecturally unified squares were created: the &quot;Place du Capitole&quot; and the &quot;Place Wilson&quot; (called &quot;place Villeneuve&quot; when it was built), whose uniform architecture was inspired by Rue de Rivoli in Paris.

From 1830 onwards, Auguste Virebent and his brothers (sons of Jacques-Pascal) developed a factory of low-cost moulded decorations which met with great success and adorned Toulouse facades with numerous terracotta ornaments, far from the austere architecture of their father.

Then, in the last third of the 19th century, large Haussmann-style avenues were opened in the town centre, such as the central Alsace-Lorraine street, built in yellow brick to imitate Parisian stone.

===20th and 21st centuries architecture===
From the middle of the 19th century, the arrival of the railway in Toulouse facilitated the supply of stone and made it cheaper for construction, and architects did not hesitate to play on the old traditional Toulouse codes linked to the prestige of stone construction, even if these no longer had the economic justification of yesteryear. Thus, at the beginning of the 20th century, the main railway station was built entirely in white stone.

Subsequently, concrete replaced the traditional materials, but brick and stone were still used for cladding, as shown recently by the work of prestigious architects such as Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown for the seat of the departmental council, or Shelley McNamara and Yvonne Farrell for the Toulouse School of Economics building.

=== Banks of the Garonne, Canal du Midi, parks ===

The banks of the Garonne river offer an interesting urban panorama of the city. Red brick dykes from the 18th century enclose the river which was subject to destructive floods. The Pont-Neuf took almost a century to build as the project was so ambitious (1545-1632). It was a very modern bridge for its time, removing the housing on the deck and using techniques such as lowered arches, openings in the piers and stacked spouts to spread the water, making it the only bridge in Toulouse to withstand the violent floods of the past. Further downstream, the Bazacle is a ford across the Garonne river, in the 12th century the Bazacle Milling Company was the first recorded European joint-stock company. On the left bank of the river, historically a flood-prone bank, stand two former hospitals whose origins date back to the 12th century: the Hôtel-Dieu Saint-Jacques and the Hôpital de La Grave. Isolated on the left bank, victims of the plague and other sick people were thus kept away from the city by the width of the river.

Built at the end of the 17th century, the Canal du Midi bypasses the city centre and has linked Toulouse to the Mediterranean Sea ever since. Its 240 kilometres were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996.

The &quot;Jardin des Plantes&quot;, the &quot;Grand Rond&quot; and the &quot;Jardin Royal&quot; form a set of adjacent parks that span several blocks and include the Museum of Natural History, cafés, children&#x27;s activities and a botanical garden (18th-19th century). The &quot;Prairie des Filtres&quot;, the Raymond VI garden and the Japanese garden are other interesting parks that border the center of Toulouse.

=== Museums and theme parks ===
Toulouse has many museums, the most important of which are:
* &quot;Musée des Augustins&quot; is the fine arts museum of Toulouse, it is located in the former Augustinian convent.
* Bemberg Foundation, housed in the Hôtel d&#x27;Assézat, presents to the public one of the major private collections of art in Europe.
* &quot;Musée Saint-Raymond&quot; is the archeological museum of Toulouse, located in a former college of the university it presents the ancient history of Toulouse and a very rich collection of Roman sculptures from the imperial Roman villa of Chiragan.
* &quot;Musée Paul Dupuy&quot; is the museum of Decorative Arts and Graphic Arts, including a very rich collection of clocks and watches.
* &quot;Musée Georges Labit&quot; is dedicated to artifacts from the Far-Eastern and Ancient Egyptian civilizations.
* &quot;Muséum de Toulouse&quot; is one of the most important natural history museums in France, housed in the former convent of the Discalced Carmelites.
* &quot;Les Abattoirs&quot; is the museum of modern and contemporary art of the city, opened in a former municipal slaughterhouse.

Toulouse also has several theme parks, notably highlighting its aeronautical and space heritage:
* &quot;Cité de l&#x27;espace&quot; is a scientific discovery centre focused on spaceflight.
* &quot;Aeroscopia&quot; is an aeronautical theme park located near Toulouse–Blagnac Airport, dedicated to the preservation of aeronautical historical heritage (it hosts for example two Concorde airliners).
* &quot;L&#x27;Envol des pionniers&quot; is a museum that traces the great adventure of l&#x27;Aéropostale, a pioneering airmail company based in Toulouse which operated between France and South America from 1918 to 1933, and employed legendary pilots such as Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, Jean Mermoz or Henri Guillaumet...
* &quot;Halle de La Machine&quot; is a vast hall that houses numerous small or giant animated machines, often inspired by the world of aeronautics, human or technological epics.

==Economy==
Since 2003, Toulouse has been the French city with the fastest growing GDP per capita, a performance driven by growing high-tech industries.

Toulouse economy can rely on three pillars: large industrial companies, research laboratories and a huge pool of students, engineers and scientists. Indeed, Toulouse is home to the second largest research and education centre in France, it has a high quality of education, first class engineering schools, powerful industries supported by world leaders, such as Airbus or Thales Alenia for aeronautics and space. This ecosystem fosters innovation in fields such as artificial intelligence, IOT, robotics, avionics, embedded systems, biotechnology, health etc.

Toulouse can particularly be described as the &#x27;capital&#x27; of the European aerospace industry: it hosts the Airbus headquarters and assembly-lines of Airbus A320, A330, and A350. The A380 was also produced here (the last completed in 2021), as was the Concorde supersonic aircraft. Toulouse also hosts the headquarters of ATR, one of the two headquarters of Liebherr Aerospace and Groupe Latécoère. As for the space industry, with 12,000 jobs, 400 companies and 25% of the European workforce, Toulouse is the main European hub.
==Education==

Toulouse has the fourth-largest student population in France after Paris, Lyon and Lille with 103,000 students (2012).

===Colleges and universities===

The University of Toulouse (&quot;Université de Toulouse&quot;) was established in 1229 (now split into three separate universities). Like the universities in Oxford and Paris, the University of Toulouse was established at a time when Europeans were starting to translate the writings of Arabs of Andalus and Greek philosophers. These writings challenged European ideology—inspiring scientific discoveries and advances in the arts—as society began seeing itself in a new way. These colleges were supported by the Church, in hopes of reconciling Greek philosophy and Christian theology.
* Catholic University of Toulouse
* Université Toulouse I, Toulouse School of Economics, Toulouse School of Management and Institut d&#x27;études politiques de Toulouse
* University of Toulouse-Jean Jaurès (Formerly University of Toulouse II – Le Mirail)
* Université Paul Sabatier (Toulouse III)

Toulouse is also the home of Toulouse Business School (TBS), Toulouse School of Economics (TSE), the Institut supérieur européen de gestion group (ISEG Group), the Institut supérieur européen de formation par l&#x27;action (ISEFAC), E-Artsup and several engineering schools:
* ICAM Toulouse (Institut catholique d&#x27;arts et métiers)

==Transport==


=== Train ===
The main railway station, with regional and national services, is Toulouse-Matabiau station. In addition, there are several smaller stations in the city: Toulouse-Saint-Agne, Gallieni-Cancéropôle, Toulouse-Saint-Cyprien-Arènes, Le TOEC, Lardenne, Saint-Martin-du-Touch, Les Ramassiers, Montaudran and Lacourtensourt. The stations of Lalande-L&#x27;Eglise and Route-de-Launaguet were served until 2016.

=== Metro ===
All urban bus, metro and tram services are operated by Tisséo. In addition to an extensive bus system (145 lines), the Toulouse Metro is a VAL (Véhicule Automatique Léger) metro system made up of driverless (automatic) rubber-tyred trains:

* Line A runs for from Balma-Gramont in the north-east to Basso Cambo in the south-west.
* Line B, which opened in June 2007, serves 20 stations north to south and intersects line A at Jean Jaurès.

Line C is under construction for an opening in 2028 with 21 stations over 27 km. It will cross line B at 2 stations (La Vache and François Verdier) and will cross line A at Matabiau Gares (central train station)

Actual Line C has existed since line A was completed. It is not VAL but an urban railway line operated by SNCF. It connects to line A at Arènes. Two other stations located in Toulouse are also served by line C. Lardenne, formerly named &quot;Gare des Capelles&quot;, changed its name in September 2003 when line C opened. Le TOEC station opened on 1 September 2003 with the creation of line C, allowing an urban train service in Toulouse and close western suburbs. Since 2023, the service is now named &quot;Arènes-Colomiers&quot; train line to leave the name for the new metro line.

Similarly, Line D runs south from Toulouse Matabiau to Muret.

=== Tramway ===
The Toulouse conurbation has two tram lines:

* The tramway line T1, with 25 stations and 14.8 km long, has been in service since December 2010. It links Toulouse to the new MEETT Exhibition and Convention Centre in Beauzelle, via Blagnac.
* The tramway line T2, which connects Toulouse-Blagnac airport, is a branch of the first line. It is currently stopped to transform it into an airport express tram which will be connected to metro line C in 2028.

=== Cable car ===
Since 13 May 2022, the city of Toulouse has had a new mode of public transportation called Téléo. This is a cable car that links Paul-Sabatier University to Rangueil Hospital and the Oncopole (a major cancer research centre). It allows to fly over the Garonne and the hill of Pech David and, with its 3 kilometres, it is the longest urban cable car in France. It is presented as the first link in a public transport belt that is not radial and oriented towards the city centre, but designed to encircle the south of Toulouse.

=== Bicycle ===
In 2007, a citywide bicycle rental scheme called VélôToulouse was introduced, with bicycles available from automated stations for a daily, weekly, monthly or yearly subscription.

=== Airports ===
Airports include:
* Toulouse Blagnac: the principal local airport
* Toulouse Francazal: former principal airport, then former military airfield, its activity is nowadays reduced
* Toulouse Lasbordes: this airfield is dedicated to leisure aviation and flying clubs

=== Canal ===
The Canal du Midi begins in Toulouse and runs up to Sète.

===Toulouse public transportation statistics===
The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Toulouse on a weekday is 44 minutes. 9.1% of public transit riders ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 9 minutes, while 10.4% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is , while 8% travel for over in a single direction.

==Communications==
Toulouse is the home of Bonhoure Radio Tower, a lattice tower used for FM and TV transmission. In 2001 a optical fiber (symmetric 360 Gbit/s) network named
&quot;Infrastructure Métropolitaine de Télécommunications&quot; was deployed around the city and suburbs.

==Culture==
The Théâtre du Capitole is the home of opera and ballet; there has been a theatre on the site since 1736. The Orchestre National du Capitole, long associated with Michel Plasson, plays at the Halle aux Grains. On 31 October 2023, Toulouse was named UNESCO City of Music.

Le Château d&#x27;Eau, an old 19th-century water-tower, was converted as a gallery in 1974 by Jean Dieuzaide, a French photographer from Toulouse and is now one of the oldest public places dedicated to photography in the world. Toulouse&#x27;s art museums include the Musée des Augustins, the Musée des Abattoirs, the Musée Georges Labit, and the Fondation Bemberg in the Hôtel d&#x27;Assézat. The Musée Saint-Raymond is devoted to Antiquity and the Muséum de Toulouse to natural history.

Toulouse is the seat of the Académie des Jeux Floraux, the equivalent of the French Academy for the Occitan-speaking regions of southern France, making Toulouse the unofficial capital of Occitan culture. The traditional Cross of Toulouse (from Provence, under the name of cross of Provence), emblem of the County of Toulouse and commonly widespread around all of Occitania during the Middle Ages is the symbol of the city and of the newly founded Midi-Pyrénées &quot;région&quot;, as well as a popular Occitan symbol.

The city&#x27;s gastronomic specialties include the Saucisse de Toulouse, a type of sausage, &quot;cassoulet&quot; Toulousain, a bean and pork stew, and &quot;garbure&quot;, a cabbage soup with poultry.

Toulouse was also a host of EuroBasket 1999.



==Notable people==
Several notable Toulousains have been scientists, such as Jean Dausset (1916–2009), 1980 winner of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine; 17th-century mathematician Pierre de Fermat (1607–1665), who spent his life in Toulouse, where he wrote Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem and was a lawyer in the city&#x27;s Parlement; Paul Sabatier (1854–1941), 1912 winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry; Albert Fert (b. 1938), 2007 winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics who grew up in Toulouse where he attended the Lycée Pierre-de-Fermat and Jean Tirole (b. 1953), owner of the 2014 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences, chairman and founder of the Toulouse School of Economics along with Jean-Jacques Laffont.

Musically, Toulouse is one of the two controversial, disputed birthplaces of Carlos Gardel (1890–1935) (the other being Tacuarembo, Uruguay), probably the most prominent figure in the history of the tango. The city&#x27;s most renowned songwriter is Claude Nougaro (1929-2004). The composer and organist Georges Guiraud (1868–1928) and songwriter Jain (b. 1992) were born in Toulouse.

Concerning arts, Toulouse is the birthplace of Impressionist painter Henri Martin (1860–1943) as well as sculptors Alexandre Falguière (1831–1900), Antonin Mercié (1845–1916) and illustrator Edmund Dulac (1882–1953). Moreover, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres (1780–1867) and Antoine Bourdelle (1861–1929) were trained at the Toulouse fine arts school. Post Impressionist painter Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec&#x27;s (1864–1901) father was Count Alphonse Charles de Toulouse-Lautrec Monfa (1838–1913) and was part of an aristocratic family of Counts of Toulouse, Odet de Foix, Vimcomte de Lautrec and the Viscounts of Montfa.

Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse (–1105), one of the leaders of the First Crusade, was born in Toulouse. Aviation pioneer Clément Ader (1841–1925), acrobatic performer Jules Léotard (1838–1870) who gave his name to the leotard, and psychiatrist Jean-Étienne Dominique Esquirol (1772–1840) were also natives. French football legend Just Fontaine (1933–2023), record holder for the most goals in a single FIFA World Cup (thirteen in six games in 1958), lived in Toulouse for the last 60 years of his life. Léon Marchand (b. 2002), swimmer and four-time Olympic gold medalist grew up in Toulouse where he attended Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier University.

==International relations==

<text>Joseph Nathan &quot;King&quot; Oliver (December 19, 1881 – April 8/10, 1938) was an American jazz cornet player and bandleader. He was particularly recognized for his playing style and his pioneering use of mutes in jazz. Also a notable composer, he wrote many tunes still played today, including &quot;Dippermouth Blues&quot;, &quot;Sweet Like This&quot;, &quot;Canal Street Blues&quot;, and &quot;Doctor Jazz&quot;. He was the mentor and teacher of Louis Armstrong. His influence was such that Armstrong claimed, &quot;if it had not been for Joe Oliver, jazz would not be what it is today.&quot;

==Biography==
===Life===
Joseph Nathan Oliver was born in Aben, Louisiana, near Donaldsonville in Ascension Parish, to 
Nathan Oliver and Virginia &quot;Jinnie&quot; Jones. He claimed 1881 as his year of birth in his draft registration in September 1918 (two months before the end of World War I) but that year is open to debate, with some census records and other sources suggesting 1884 or 1885 as his true year of birth.

He moved to New Orleans in his youth. He first studied the trombone, then changed to cornet. From 1908 to 1917, he played cornet in New Orleans brass bands and dance bands and in the city&#x27;s red-light district, which came to be known as Storyville. A band he co-led with trombonist Kid Ory was considered one of the best and hottest in New Orleans in the late 1910s. He was popular in New Orleans across economic and racial lines and was in demand for music jobs of all kinds.

According to an oral history interview at Tulane University&#x27;s Hogan Jazz Archive with Oliver&#x27;s widow, Stella, a fight broke out at a dance where Oliver was playing, and the police arrested him, his band, and the fighters.

He was living in Chicago with his wife, Estelle &quot;Stella&quot; Dominick, whom he had married in New Orleans in September 1911. He continued to work at the Dreamland, forming a band there in January 1920, which included Johnny Dodds, Honoré Dutrey, and Lil Hardin, the nucleus of his famous Creole Jazz Band. After Storyville closed, he moved to Chicago in 1918 with his wife and step-daughter, Ruby Tuesday Oliver (born 1905).

Noticeably different in his approach were faster tempos, unlike the slow drags in the African-American dance halls of New Orleans. In Chicago, he found work with colleagues from New Orleans, such as clarinetist Lawrence Duhé, bassist Bill Johnson, trombonist Roy Palmer, and drummer Paul Barbarin. He became leader of Duhé&#x27;s band, playing at a number of Chicago clubs. In the summer of 1921, he took a group to the West Coast, playing engagements in San Francisco and Oakland, California. On the west coast, Oliver and his band engaged with the vaudeville tradition, performing in plantation outfits.

Oliver and his band returned to Chicago in 1922, where they started playing in the Lincoln Gardens as King Oliver and his Creole Jazz Band. In addition to Oliver on cornet, the personnel included his protégé Louis Armstrong on second cornet, Baby Dodds on drums, Johnny Dodds on clarinet, Lil Hardin (later Armstrong&#x27;s wife) on piano, Honoré Dutrey on trombone, and Bill Johnson on double bass. Recordings made by this group in 1923 for Gennett, Okeh, Paramount, and Columbia demonstrated the New Orleans style of collective improvisation, also known as Dixieland, and brought it to a larger audience. Because they were recording acousticly into a horn that was directly connected to the needle making the record master, Armstrong notably had to stand in the corner of the room, away from the horn, because his powerful playing bounced the needle off the master. In addition, white musicians would visit Lincoln Gardens in order to learn from Oliver and his band. Because Lincoln Gardens was in Chicago&#x27;s black neighborhood and only admitted blacks, the white players listened outside near the front door. A prospective tour in the midwestern states ultimately broke up the band in 1924.

In the mid-1920s Oliver enlarged his band to nine musicians, performing under the name King Oliver and his Dixie Syncopators, and began using more written arrangements with jazz solos. This band led by Oliver at the Plantation Café was in direct competition with Louis Armstrong&#x27;s Sunset Stompers, who performed at the Sunset Café. In 1927 the band went to New York, but he disbanded it to do freelance jobs. In the later 1920s, he struggled with playing trumpet due to his gum disease, so he employed others to handle the solos, including his nephew Dave Nelson, Louis Metcalf, and Red Allen. He reunited the band in 1928, recording for Victor Talking Machine Company one year later. He continued with modest success until a downturn in the economy made it more difficult to find bookings. His periodontitis made playing the trumpet progressively difficult. He quit playing music in 1937.

===Work and influence===
As a player, Oliver took great interest in altering his horn&#x27;s sound. He pioneered the use of mutes, including the rubber plumber&#x27;s plunger, derby hat, bottles and cups. His favorite mute was a small metal mute made by the C.G. Conn Instrument Company, with which he played his famous solo on his composition the &quot;Dippermouth Blues&quot; (an early nickname for fellow cornetist Louis Armstrong). His recording &quot;Wa Wa Wa&quot; with the Dixie Syncopators can be credited with giving the name wah-wah to such techniques. This &quot;freak&quot; style of trumpet playing was also featured in his composition, &quot;Eccentric.&quot; One of his protégés, Louis Panico (cornetist with the Isham Jones Orchestra), authored a book entitled &quot;The Novelty Cornetist&quot;, which is illustrated with photos showing some of the mute techniques he learned from Oliver.

Oliver was also a talented composer, and wrote many tunes that are still regularly played, including &quot;Dippermouth Blues,&quot; &quot;Sweet Like This,&quot; &quot;Canal Street Blues,&quot; and &quot;Doctor Jazz.&quot; &quot;Dippermouth Blues,&quot; for example, was adapted by Don Redman for Fletcher Henderson&#x27;s Orchestra under the new name of &quot;Sugar Foot Stomp&quot;.

Oliver performed mostly on cornet, but like many cornetists he switched to trumpet in the late 1920s. He credited jazz pioneer Buddy Bolden as an early influence, and in turn was a major influence on numerous younger cornet/trumpet players in New Orleans and Chicago, including Tommy Ladnier, Paul Mares, Muggsy Spanier, Johnny Wiggs, Frank Guarente and, the most famous of all, Armstrong. 

As mentor to Armstrong in New Orleans, Oliver taught young Louis and gave him his job in Kid Ory&#x27;s band when he went to Chicago. A few years later Oliver summoned him to Chicago to play with his band. Louis remembered Oliver as &quot;Papa Joe&quot; and considered him his idol and inspiration. In his autobiography, &quot;Satchmo: My Life in New Orleans&quot;, Armstrong wrote: &quot;It was my ambition to play as he did. I still think that if it had not been for Joe Oliver, Jazz would not be what it is today. He was a creator in his own right.&quot;

==Hardships in later years, decline and death==
Oliver&#x27;s business acumen could not equal his musical skill. A succession of managers stole money from him, and he tried to negotiate more money for his band than the Savoy Ballroom was willing to pay – losing the job. He lost the chance of an important engagement at New York City&#x27;s famous Cotton Club when he held out for more money; young Duke Ellington took the job and subsequently catapulted to fame.

The Great Depression brought hardship to Oliver. He lost his life savings to a collapsed bank in Chicago, and he struggled to keep his band together through a series of hand-to-mouth gigs until the group broke up.

Oliver also had health problems, such as pyorrhea, a gum disease that was partly caused by his love of sugar sandwiches and it made it very difficult for him to play and he soon began delegating solos to younger players, but by 1935, he could no longer play the trumpet at all. Oliver was stranded in Savannah, Georgia, where he pawned his trumpet and finest suits and briefly ran a fruit stall, then he worked as a janitor at Wimberly&#x27;s Recreation Hall (526–528 West Broad Street).

Oliver died in poverty &quot;of arteriosclerosis, too broke to afford treatment&quot; in a Savannah rooming house on April 8 or 10, 1938. His sister spent her rent money to have his body brought to New York, where he was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx. Armstrong and other loyal musician friends were in attendance.

==Honors and awards==
Oliver was inducted as a charter member of the Gennett Records Walk of Fame in Richmond, Indiana in 2007.

<text>Baccarat or baccara (; ) is a card game. It is now mainly played at casinos, but formerly popular at house-parties and private gaming rooms. The game&#x27;s origins are a mix of precursors from China, Japan, and Korea, which then gained popularity in Europe with a faster French rendition following, and today the most common version played derives from Cuba. 

It is a comparing card game played between two hands, the &quot;player&quot; and the &quot;banker&quot;. Each baccarat coup (round of play) has three possible outcomes: &quot;player&quot; (player has the higher score), &quot;banker&quot;, and &quot;tie&quot;.

There are three popular variants of the game: &quot;punto banco&quot;, &quot;baccarat chemin de fer&quot;, and &quot;baccarat banque&quot; (or &quot;à deux tableaux&quot;). In &quot;punto banco&quot;, each player&#x27;s moves are forced by the cards the player is dealt. In &quot;baccarat chemin de fer&quot; and &quot;baccarat banque&quot;, by contrast, both players can make choices. The winning odds are in favour of the bank, with a house edge of at least 1 percent.

== History ==

The origins of the game are disputed. Some sources claim that it dates to the 19th century, others that the game was introduced into France from Italy at the end of the 15th century by soldiers returning from the Italian Wars during the reign of King of France Charles VIII.

David Parlett considers Macao as the immediate precursor to baccarat. Its name and rules suggest it may have been brought over by sailors returning from Asia where similar card games have been played since the early 17th century such as San zhang, Oicho-Kabu, and Gabo japgi. Macao appeared in Europe at the end of the 18th century and was popular for all classes. Its notoriety led to King Victor-Amadeus III banning it in all his realms in 1788. It was the most popular game in Watier&#x27;s, an exclusive gentlemen&#x27;s club in London, where it led to the ruin of Beau Brummell. It was declared illegal late in the 19th century, as a gambling game of almost pure chance; however it remained wildly popular in high society, with HRH the Prince of Wales (the future Edward VII) shockingly implicated in the scandalous Tranby Croft case. The match in Arthur Schnitzler&#x27;s 1926 novella &quot;Night Games&quot; (&quot;Spiel im Morgengrauen&quot;) contains instructions for Macao under the name of &quot;baccarat&quot;. Its popularity in the United States waned after the early 20th century. The game still has a following in Continental Europe, especially in Russia. Like Macao and Victoria, baccarat was banned in Russia during the 19th century though the rules continued to be printed in game books.

Baccarat has been popular among the French nobility since the 19th century. During the Napoleonic era and before the legalization of casino gambling in 1907, people in France commonly played baccarat in private gaming rooms. Dating to this time period, &quot;Baccarat Banque&quot; is the earliest form of baccarat; it is a three-person game and mentioned in &quot;Album des jeux&quot; by Charles Van-Tenac. Later, &quot;Chemin de Fer&quot; emerged as a two-person, zero-sum game from &quot;Baccarat Banque&quot;. &quot;Chemin de fer&quot; is a version which first appeared in the late 19th century. Its name, which is the French term for &quot;railway&quot;, comes from the version being quicker than the original game, the railway being at that time the fastest means of transport. It is still the most popular version in France.

&quot;Baccarat Punto Banco&quot;, in which the bettor bets on whether the Player or the Banker hand wins, was a significant change in the development of modern baccarat. It developed into a house-banked game in Havana in the 1940s, and is the most popular modern form.

==Valuation of hands==
In baccarat, the 2 through 9 cards (of any suit) are worth face value (in points); the 10, jack, queen, and king have no point value and are thus worth zero; aces are worth one point; jokers are not used. Hands are valued modulo 10; i.e., according to the units digit of the sum of their constituent cards. For example, a hand consisting of 2 and 3 is worth five, while a hand consisting of 6 and 7 is worth three, that being the value of the units digit in the combined point total of thirteen. The highest possible hand value in baccarat is therefore nine.

==Versions==
===Punto banco===
&quot;Punto banco&quot; is nowadays the most played version of baccarat in the United States. In punto banco, the casino banks the game at all times, and commits to playing out both hands according to fixed drawing rules, known as the &quot;tableau&quot; (French: &quot;board&quot;), in contrast to more historic baccarat games where each hand is associated with an individual who makes drawing choices. The player (&quot;punto&quot;) and banker (&quot;banco&quot;) are simply designations for the two hands dealt out in each coup, two outcomes which the bettor can back; the player hand has no particular association with the gambler, nor the banker hand with the house.

Punto banco is dealt from a shoe containing 6 or 8 decks of cards shuffled together; a cut-card is placed in front of the seventh from last card, and the drawing of the cut-card indicates the last coup of the shoe. The dealer burns the first card face up and then based on its respective numerical value, with aces worth 1 and face cards worth 10, the dealer burns that many cards face down. For each coup, two cards are dealt face up to each hand, starting from &quot;player&quot; and alternating between the hands. The croupier may call the total (e.g., &quot;five player, three banker&quot;). If either the player or banker or both achieve a total of 8 or 9 at this stage, the coup is finished and the result is announced: a player win, a banker win, or tie. If neither hand has eight or nine, the drawing rules are applied to determine whether the player should receive a third card. Then, based on the value of any card drawn to the player, the drawing rules are applied to determine whether the banker should receive a third card. The coup is then finished, the outcome is announced, and winning bets are paid out.

&quot;Punto banco&quot; is a pure game of chance and therefore it is not possible for a gambler&#x27;s bets to be rationally motivated.

====Tableau of drawing rules====
If neither the player nor the banker is dealt a total of 8 or 9 in the first two cards (known as a &quot;natural&quot;), the tableau is consulted, first for the player&#x27;s rules, then the banker&#x27;s.

; Player&#x27;s rule
: If the player has an initial total of 5 or less, they draw a third card. If the player has an initial total of 6 or 7, they stand.

; Banker&#x27;s rule
: If the player stood pat (i.e. has only two cards), the banker regards only their own hand and acts according to the same rule as the player, i.e. the banker draws a third card with hands 5 or less and stands with 6 or 7.
: If the player drew a third card, the banker acts according to the following more complex rules:
* If the banker total is 2 or less, they draw a third card regardless of what the player&#x27;s third card is.
* If the banker total is 3, they draw a third card unless the player&#x27;s third card is an 8.
* If the banker total is 4, they draw a third card if the player&#x27;s third card is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.
* If the banker total is 5, they draw a third card if the player&#x27;s third card is 4, 5, 6, or 7.
* If the banker total is 6, they draw a third card if the player&#x27;s third card is a 6 or 7.
* If the banker total is 7, they stand.
The croupier will deal the cards according to the tableau and the croupier will announce the winning hand, either the player or the banker. Losing bets will be collected and the winning bets will be paid according to the rules of the house. Usually, 1-to-1 even money will be paid on player bets and 19-to-20 on banker bets (even money with &quot;5% commission to the house on the win&quot;).

Should both the player and banker have the same value at the end of the deal the croupier shall announce &quot;égalité — tie bets win.&quot; All tie bets will be paid at 8-to-1 odds and all bets on player or banker remain in place and active for the next game (the customer may or may not be able to retract these bets depending on casino rules).

====Casino provision====

In the US, the full-scale version of punto banco is usually played at large tables in roped off areas or private rooms separated from the main gaming floor. The game is frequented by high rollers, who may wager tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars on a single hand. Minimum bets are relatively high, often starting at $100 and going as high as $500. Posted maximum bets are often arranged to suit a player. The table is staffed by a croupier, who directs the play of the game, and two dealers who calculate tax and collect and pay bets. Six or eight decks of cards are used, normally shuffled only by the croupier and dealers. The shoe is held by one of the players, who deals the cards on the instructions of the croupier according to the tableau. On a player win, the shoe moves either to the highest winning bettor, or to the next person in clockwise order around the table, depending on the casino&#x27;s conventions. The shoe may be refused or the croupier may be requested to deal.

====Odds and strategy====
Punto banco has both some of the lowest house edges among casino table games, and some of the highest. The player bet has, relative to most casino bets, a low house edge of 1.24%, and the banker bet (accounting for the 5% commission on the win) is even lower, at 1.06%. In contrast, the tie bet, which pays 8-to-1, has a high house edge of 14.4%. Most casinos in the United Kingdom pay the tie at 9-to-1, resulting in a house edge of approximately 4.85%.

Card counting can be employed to reduce the house edge by about 0.05%. If paired with a technique known as edge sorting, baccarat players can obtain a significant edge versus the casino.

House edge details (8 decks)
====Variations====
Mini-baccarat is a version of banco punto played on a small table with smaller minimums/maximums. It is popular with more casual players, particularly those from Asia.

A mini-baccarat variation where even money is paid on winning banker bets (rather than 95%), except when the banker wins with 6, which pay only 50% of the bet, goes under various names including &quot;Super 6&quot; and &quot;Punto 2000&quot;. The house edge on a banker bet under Super 6 is 1.46% compared with regular commission baccarat at 1.058%. This is equivalent to increasing the commission by 17.45% to 5.87%. The banker wins with a 6 about five times every eight-deck shoe. As well as its increased house edge, the Super 6 variation is used by casinos for its speed, since it partially does away with the time-consuming process of calculating and collecting commission on winning banker bets except for winning with a 6.

In a similar variation called &quot;EZ-baccarat&quot;, even money is paid on both winning banker or player bets, except when the banker wins with a total of 7 after the third card is drawn, which results in a push on banker bets. The game has two additional options, the &quot;Dragon 7&quot;, a specific bet of a winning three-card 7 on the banker side, which pays 40-to-1 instead of pushing, and &quot;Panda 8&quot;, a bet of a winning three-card 8 on the player side, which pays 25-to-1.

===Chemin de fer===
Six decks of cards are used, shuffled together. Players are seated in random order, typically around an oval table; discarded cards go to the center. Play begins to the right of the croupier and continues counterclockwise.

Once play begins, one player is designated as the banker; this player also deals. The other players are &quot;punters&quot;. The position of banker passes counterclockwise in the course of the game. In each round, the banker wagers the amount they are willing to risk. Each other player, in order, then declares whether they will &quot;go bank&quot;, playing against the entire current bank with a matching wager. A maximum of one player may &quot;go bank&quot;. If no one &quot;goes bank&quot;, players make their wagers in order. If the total wagers from the players are less than the bank, observing bystanders may also wager up to the amount of the bank. If the total wagers from the players are greater than the bank, the banker may choose to increase the bank to match; otherwise, the excess wagers are removed in reverse play order.

The banker deals four cards face-down: two to themselves and two held in common by the remaining players. The player with the highest individual wager (or first in play order if tied for highest wager) is selected to represent the group of non-banker players. The banker and player both look at their cards; if either has an eight or a nine, this is immediately announced and the hands are turned face-up and compared. If neither hand is an eight or nine, the player has a choice to accept or refuse a third card; if accepted, it is dealt face-up. Traditional practice – grounded in mathematics, similar to basic strategy in blackjack, but further enforced via social sanctions by the other individuals whose money is at stake – dictates that one always accept a card if one&#x27;s hand totals between 0 and 4, inclusive, and always refuse a card if it totals 6 or 7. After the player finishes, the banker, in turn, decides either to accept or to refuse another card. Once both the banker and the representative player have made their decision, the hands are turned face-up and compared.

If the player&#x27;s hand exceeds the banker&#x27;s hand when they are compared, each wagering player receives back their wager and a matching amount from the bank, and the position of banker passes to the next player in order. If the banker&#x27;s hand exceeds the player&#x27;s hand, all wagers are forfeit and placed into the bank, and the banker position does not change. If there is a tie, wagers remain as they are for the next hand.

If the banker wishes to withdraw, the new banker is the first player in order willing to stake an amount equal to the current bank total. If no one is willing to stake this amount, the new banker is instead the next player in order, and the bank resets to whatever they wish to stake. Many games have a set minimum bank or wager amount.

Unlike &quot;punto banco&quot;, which is purely a game of chance, &quot;chemin de fer&quot; includes an element of player skill.

===Baccarat banque===
In &quot;Baccarat banque&quot; the position of banker is more permanent compared to &quot;Chemin de fer&quot;. The shoe contains three inter-shuffled decks. The banker, unless they retire because they wish to or ran out of money to stake, keeps their role until all these cards have been dealt.

The banker is initially determined via auctioning, i.e. is given to the player who will undertake to risk the largest amount. In some circles, the person who has first set down their name on the list of players has the right to hold the first bank, risking such amount as they may think proper.

When a banker is determined, they sit opposite the croupier with the discard area between. On both sides of the banker are the punters (traditionally, ten such constituting a full table). Other players cannot sit directly and may only bet when active players&#x27; bets don&#x27;t cover the banker&#x27;s stakes.

The croupier shuffles the cards then prompts one punter from their right, one from their left then the banker to reshuffle and finally selects a random player to cut. After every player has bet, the banker deals one card to one of the right punters, the second to one of the left punters, and the third to themselves. This is done twice, resulting in 6 cards on the table. Each side wins or loses depending on the cards dealt to that side only. The rules as to turning up with eight or nine, offering and accepting cards, and so on, are the same as &quot;Chemin de fer&quot;.

Each punter continues to hold the cards for their side so long as they win or tie. If they lose, the next hand is dealt to the player next following them in rotation.

In each side, any player may &quot;go bank&quot;, like in &quot;Chemin de fer&quot;. If two players on opposite sides desire to &quot;go bank&quot;, each player bets half the bank.

A player going bank may either do so for as many times as they like until they lose, or as a cheval, i.e. on two hands separately, one-half of the stake being played upon each hand. A player going bank and losing may go bank again, until they lose for the third time.

A banker must play out one hand, but may retire at any time afterwards. On retiring, they must state the amount they retire with. It is then open to any other player (in order of rotation) to continue the bank, starting with the same stake and dealing from undealt cards. The outgoing banker takes the place previously occupied by their successor.

Should the bank empty, the banker may freely put more money at stake without losing their right to bank.

If all punters&#x27; bets exceed the bank stake, the banker does not need to put more money. In the event of their losing, the croupier pays the punters in order of rotation until the bank runs out of money. The remainders are returned. The banker may, however, choose to accept the bets and increase their own stakes anyway. If they do so, the bank becomes unlimited and the banker must either cover all bets posted by all players or give up the bank.

===Macao===
Macao uses two decks of cards shuffled together. Punters place their bets (within the agreed limits) against the banker. Initially, one card is dealt clockwise and face down to every player by the banker. The punters&#x27; objective is to beat the banker&#x27;s card value or risk losing their bet. In case of a tie, whoever has the same value with fewer cards wins. The banker wins if there is a tie in both value and number of cards (in an early version, all bets are off). Any punter who receives a natural 9 receives triple the amount of the bet as long as the banker does not have a natural 9 too. Winning with a natural 8 awards double while winning with a 7 or under is only equal to the bet. Players can request additional cards which are dealt face up; if it is a ten or a face card, they can reject it and ask for another. In an early version of this game, going over 9 with extra cards amounts to a &quot;bust&quot; as in blackjack, later versions use modulo 10 arithmetic as in the other games. Beating the banker with a pair only awards an equal amount to the bet. When the deck is exhausted, the player to the banker&#x27;s left becomes the new banker.

Victoria is a variation of Macao where players are initially dealt two cards.

==Economy==
American casinos are generating an increasing amount of their revenue from baccarat play. For example, in May 2012, Nevada only generated 18.3% of its total table gaming win from baccarat. However, in May 2013, this percentage increased to 33.1% and in May 2014 it rose to 45.2%.

Baccarat is the most important table game in Macau, with taxes from baccarat play constituting the largest single source of public funding in Macau. About 91% of total income from Macau casinos in 2014 came from the punto banco variation.

==In popular culture==

===Royal baccarat scandal===

The Tranby Croft affair in 1891 and William Gordon Cumming&#x27;s subsequent lawsuit were known together as the royal baccarat scandal, due to the involvement of the future King Edward VII. Since the Prince of Wales was involved in the incident, it inspired a huge amount of media interest in the game, bringing baccarat to the attention of the public at large. Accounts of the scandal in newspapers also included the rules for the game. The scandal became the subject of music hall songs and a stage play.

===James Bond===
Baccarat &quot;chemin-de-fer&quot; is the favoured game of James Bond, the fictional secret agent created by Ian Fleming. Bond plays the game in numerous novels, most notably his 1953 debut, &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, in which much of the plot revolves around a game between Bond and SMERSH trade union operative Le Chiffre; the unabridged version of the novel includes a primer to the game for readers who are unfamiliar with it. It is also featured in several filmed versions of the character, including the 1954 television adaptation of &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, where Bond bankrupts Le Chiffre in order to have him eliminated by his Soviet superiors; &quot;Dr. No&quot;, where Bond is first introduced while playing the game in film; &quot;Thunderball&quot;; the 1967 version of &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, which is the most detailed treatment of a baccarat game in any Bond film; &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;; &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;; and &quot;GoldenEye&quot;.

In the 2006 movie adaptation of &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, baccarat is replaced by Texas hold &#x27;em poker, largely due to the poker boom at the time of filming.

===Phil Ivey controversy===
The card counting technique gained attention in 2012 when a casino in the United Kingdom refused to pay professional gambler Phil Ivey about $11 million because he had used edge sorting to gain an advantage. The same year, Ivey and a female companion won $9.6 million at the Borgata casino in Atlantic City using edge sorting and another $500,000 playing craps using his gains as a stake in the game. The Borgata paid him after his win but then sued Ivey in 2014 after surveillance video showed he had manipulated the dealer into rotating certain cards in the deck to exploit the flaw on the back of the cards. The Borgata prevailed and won $10.1 million, which Ivey refused to pay. In February 2019, the Borgata received approval from the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey to go after Ivey&#x27;s assets in the state of Nevada, since he had no assets in the state of New Jersey to pursue. Ivey and the Borgata reached a settlement in July 2020.

<text>Bactria (; Bactrian: , ), or Bactriana, was an ancient Iranian civilization in Central Asia based in the area south of the Oxus River (modern Amu Darya) and north of the mountains of the Hindu Kush, an area within the north of modern Afghanistan. Bactria was strategically located south of Sogdia and the western part of the Pamir Mountains. The extensive mountain ranges acted as protective &quot;walls&quot; on three sides, with the Pamir on the north and the Hindu Kush on south forming a junction with the Karakoram range towards the east.

Called &quot;beautiful Bactria, crowned with flags&quot; by the Avesta, the region is considered, in the Zoroastrian faith, to be one of the &quot;sixteen perfect Iranian lands&quot; that the supreme deity, Ahura Mazda, had created. It was once a small and independent kingdom struggling to exist against nomadic Turanians. One of the early centres of Zoroastrianism, and capital of the legendary Kayanian dynasty, Bactria is mentioned in the Behistun Inscription of Darius the Great as one of the satrapies of the Achaemenid Empire; it was a special satrapy, ruled by a crown prince or an intended heir. Bactria was the centre of Iranian resistance against the Greek Macedonian invaders after the fall of the Achaemenid Empire in the 4th century BC, but eventually fell to Alexander the Great. After the death of Alexander, Bactria was annexed by his general, Seleucus I.

The Seleucids lost the region after the declaration of independence by the satrap of Bactria, Diodotus I; thus began the history of the Greco-Bactrian, and later the Indo-Greek, Kingdoms. By the second century BC, Bactria was conquered by the Parthian Empire, and, in the early first century, the Kushan Empire was formed by the Yuezhi within Bactrian territories. Shapur I, the second Sasanian King of Kings of Iran, conquered western parts of the Kushan Empire in the 3rd century, and the Kushano-Sasanian Kingdom was formed. The Sasanians lost Bactria in the 4th century, but reconquered it in the 6th century. Bactrian (natively known as , &#x27;Iranian&#x27;), an Eastern Iranian language, was the common language of Bactria and surroundings areas in ancient and early medieval times.

The Islamization of Bactria began with the Muslim conquest of Iran in the 7th century. The capital city of Bactra was centre of an Iranian Renaissance in the 8th and 9th centuries, and New Persian as an independent literary language first emerged in this region. The Samanid Empire was formed in Eastern Iran by the descendants of Saman Khuda, a Persian from Bactria, beginning the spread of the Persian language in the region and the decline of the Bactrian language.

== Etymology ==

The modern English name of the region is Bactria. Historically, the region was first mentioned in Avestan as &quot;Bakhdi&quot; in Old Persian. This later developed into &quot;Bāxtriš&quot; in Middle Persian and &quot;Baxl in&quot; New Persian. The modern name is derived from the (Romanized Greek term: &quot;Baktrianē&quot;), which is the Hellenized version of the Bactrian endonym. Other cognates include (Romanized: ). بلخ (Romanized: &quot;Balx&quot;), Chinese 大夏 (pinyin: &quot;Dàxià&quot;), Latin Bactriana. The region was mentioned in ancient Sanskrit texts as बाह्लीक or &quot;Bāhlīka&quot;. 

Wilhelm Eilers proposed that the region was named after the Balkh River (in Greek transliteration &quot;Βάκτρος&quot;) from underlying &quot;Bāxtri-&quot;, itself meaning &#x27;she who divides&#x27;, from the Proto-Indo-European root *&quot;&quot; &#x27;to divide&#x27; (whence also Avestan and Old Indic ).

Bactria is the geographic location Bactrian camels are named after.

== Geography ==
The Bactrian plain lay between the Amu Darya (ancient Oxus River) to the north and the Hindu Kush mountain range to the south and east. On its western side, the region was bordered by the great Carmanian desert and the plain of Margiana.
The Amu Darya and smaller rivers such as (from west to east) the Shirin Tagab River, Sari Pul River, Balkh River and Kunduz River have been used for irrigation for millennia. The land was noted for its fertility and its ability to produce most ancient Greek agricultural products, with the notable exception of olives.

According to Pierre Leriche:
== History ==

=== Bronze Age ===

The Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex (BMAC, also known as the &quot;Oxus civilization&quot;) is the modern archaeological designation for a Bronze Age archaeological culture of Central Asia, dated to –1700 BC, located in present-day eastern Turkmenistan, northern Afghanistan, southern Uzbekistan and western Tajikistan, centred on the upper Amu Darya (known to the ancient Greeks as the Oxus River), an area covering ancient Bactria. Its sites were discovered and named by the Soviet archaeologist Viktor Sarianidi (1976). Bactria was the Greek name for Old Persian &quot;Bāxtriš&quot; (from native *&quot;Bāxçiš&quot;) (named for its capital Bactra, modern Balkh), in what is now northern Afghanistan, and &quot;Margiana&quot; was the Greek name for the Persian satrapy of Margu, the capital of which was Merv, in today&#x27;s Turkmenistan.

The early Greek historian Ctesias, (followed by Diodorus Siculus), alleged that the legendary Assyrian king Ninus had defeated a Bactrian king named Oxyartes in , or some 1000 years before the Trojan War. Since the decipherment of cuneiform script in the 19th century, however, which enabled actual Assyrian records to be read, historians have ascribed little value to the Greek account.

According to some writers, Bactria was the homeland (Airyanem Vaejah) of Indo-Iranians who moved south-west into Iran and the north-west of the South Asian subcontinent around 2500–2000 BC. Later, it became the northern province of the Achaemenid Empire in Central Asia. It was in these regions, where the fertile soil of the mountainous country is surrounded by the Turan Depression, that the prophet Zoroaster was said to have been born and gained his first adherents. Avestan, the language of the oldest portions of the Zoroastrian &quot;Avesta&quot;, was one of the Old Iranian languages, and is the oldest attested member of the Eastern Iranian languages.

=== Achaemenid Empire ===

Ernst Herzfeld suggested that Bactria belonged to the Medes before its annexation to the Achaemenid Empire by Cyrus the Great in sixth century BC, after which it and Margiana formed the twelfth satrapy of Persia. After Darius III had been defeated by Alexander the Great, the satrap of Bactria, Bessus, attempted to organize a national resistance but was captured by other warlords and delivered to Alexander. He was then tortured and killed.

Under Persian rule, many Greeks were deported to Bactria, so that their communities and language became common in the area. During the reign of Darius I, the inhabitants of the Greek city of Barca, in Cyrenaica, were deported to Bactria for refusing to surrender assassins. In addition, Xerxes also settled the &quot;Branchidae&quot; in Bactria; they were the descendants of Greek priests who had once lived near Didyma (western Asia Minor) and betrayed the temple to him. Herodotus also records a Persian commander threatening to enslave daughters of the revolting Ionians and send them to Bactria. Persia subsequently conscripted Greek men from these settlements in Bactria into their military, as did Alexander later.

=== Alexander The Great ===

Alexander conquered Sogdiana. In the south, beyond the Oxus, he met strong resistance, but ultimately conquered the region through both military force and diplomacy, marrying Roxana, daughter of the defeated Satrap of Bactria, Oxyartes. He founded two Greek cities in Bactria, including his easternmost, Alexandria Eschate (Alexandria the Furthest).

After Alexander&#x27;s death, Diodorus Siculus tells us that Philip received dominion over Bactria, but Justin names Amyntas to that role. At the Treaty of Triparadisus, both Diodorus Siculus and Arrian agree that the satrap Stasanor gained control over Bactria. Eventually, Alexander&#x27;s empire was divided up among the generals in Alexander&#x27;s army. Bactria became a part of the Seleucid Empire, named after its founder, Seleucus I.

=== Seleucid Empire ===
The Macedonians, especially Seleucus I and his son Antiochus I, established the Seleucid Empire and founded a number of Greek towns. The Greek language became dominant for some time there.

The paradox that Greek presence was more prominent in Bactria than in areas far closer to Greece can possibly be explained by past deportations of Greeks to Bactria. When Alexander&#x27;s troops entered Bactria they discovered communities of Greeks who appeared to have been deported to the region by the Persians in previous centuries.

=== Greco-Bactrian Kingdom ===


Considerable difficulties faced by the Seleucid kings and the attacks of Pharaoh Ptolemy II Philadelphus gave the satrap of Bactria, Diodotus I, the opportunity to declare independence about 245 BC and conquer Sogdia. He was the founder of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom. Diodotus and his successors were able to maintain themselves against the attacks of the Seleucids—particularly from Antiochus III the Great, who was ultimately defeated by the Romans (190 BC).

The Greco-Bactrians were so powerful that they were able to expand their territory as far as South Asia:
The last Greco-Bactrian king Heliocles I lost control of Bactria to nomadic invaders near the end of the 2nd century BC, at which point Greek political power ceased in Bactria, but Greek cultural influence continued for many more centuries. The Greco-Bactrians used the Greek language for administrative purposes, and the local Bactrian language was also Hellenized, as suggested by its adoption of the Greek alphabet and Greek loanwords.

=== Indo-Greek Kingdom ===

The Bactrian king Euthydemus I and his son Demetrius I crossed the Hindu Kush mountains and began the conquest of the Indus valley. For a short time, they wielded great power: a great Greek empire seemed to have arisen far in the East. But this empire was torn by internal dissension and continual usurpations. When Demetrius advanced far east of the Indus River, one of his generals, Eucratides, made himself king of Bactria, and soon in every province there arose new usurpers, who proclaimed themselves kings and fought against each other. For example Eucratides is known to have battled another king named Demetrius of India, probably Demetrius II, the latter ultimately being defeated according to the historian Justin.

Most of them we know only by their coins, a great many of which are found in Afghanistan. By these wars, the dominant position of the Greeks was undermined even more quickly than would otherwise have been the case. After Demetrius and Eucratides, the kings abandoned the Attic standard of coinage and introduced a native standard, no doubt to gain support from outside the Greek minority.

In the Indus valley, this went even further. The Indo-Greek king Menander I (known as Milinda in South Asia), recognized as a great conqueror, converted to Buddhism. His successors managed to cling to power until the last known Indo-Greek ruler, a king named Strato II, who ruled in the Punjab region until around 55 BC. Other sources, however, place the end of Strato II&#x27;s reign as late as 10 AD.

===Daxia, Tukhara and Tokharistan===
&quot;Daxia&quot;, &quot;Ta-Hsia&quot;, or &quot;Ta-Hia&quot; () was the name given in antiquity by the Han Chinese to Tukhara or Tokhara: the central part of Bactria. The name &quot;Daxia&quot; appears in Chinese from the 3rd century BC to designate a little-known kingdom located somewhere west of China. This was possibly a consequence of the first contacts between China and the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom.

During the 2nd century BC, the Greco-Bactrians were conquered by nomadic Indo-European tribes from the north, beginning with the Sakas (160 BC). The Sakas were overthrown in turn by the Da Yuezhi (&quot;Greater Yuezhi&quot;) during subsequent decades. The Yuezhi had conquered Bactria by the time of the visit of the Chinese envoy Zhang Qian (circa 127 BC), who had been sent by the Han emperor to investigate lands to the west of China. The first mention of these events in European literature appeared in the 1st century BC, when Strabo described how &quot;the Asii, Pasiani, Tokhari, and Sakarauli&quot; had taken part in the &quot;destruction of the Greco-Bactrian kingdom&quot;. Ptolemy subsequently mentioned the central role of the Tokhari among other tribes in Bactria. As &quot;Tukhara&quot; or &quot;Tokhara&quot; it included areas that were later part of Surxondaryo Region in Uzbekistan, southern Tajikistan and northern Afghanistan. The Tokhari spoke a language known later as Bactrian – an Iranian language. (The Tokhari and their language should not be confused with the Tocharian people who lived in the Tarim Basin between the 3rd and 9th centuries AD, or the Tocharian languages that form another branch of Indo-European languages.)


The name Daxia was used in the &quot;Shiji&quot; (&quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;) by Sima Qian. Based on the reports of Zhang Qian, the &quot;Shiji&quot; describe Daxia as an important urban civilization of about one million people, living in walled cities under small city kings or magistrates. Daxia was an affluent country with rich markets, trading in an incredible variety of objects, coming from as far as Southern China. By the time Zhang Qian visited, there was no longer a major king, and the Bactrians were under the suzerainty of the Yuezhi. Zhang Qian depicted a rather sophisticated but demoralised people who were afraid of war. Following these reports, the Chinese emperor Wu Di was informed of the level of sophistication of the urban civilizations of Ferghana, Bactria and Parthia, and became interested in developing commercial relationship with them: These contacts immediately led to the dispatch of multiple embassies from the Chinese, which helped to develop trade along the Silk Roads.


Kujula Kadphises, the &quot;xihou&quot; (prince) of the Yuezhi, united the region in the early 1st century and laid the foundations for the powerful, but short-lived, Kushan Empire. In the 3rd century AD, Tukhara was under the rule of the &quot;Kushanshas&quot; (Indo-Sasanians).

====Tokharistan====

The form Tokharistan – the suffix &quot;-stan&quot; means &quot;place of&quot; in Persian – appeared for the first time in the 4th century, in Buddhist texts, such as the &quot;Vibhasa-sastra&quot;. Tokhara was known in Chinese sources as &quot;Tuhuluo&quot; (吐呼羅) which is first mentioned during the Northern Wei era. In the Tang dynasty, the name is transcribed as Tuhuoluo (土豁羅). Other Chinese names are Doushaluo 兜沙羅, Douquluo 兜佉羅 or Duhuoluo 覩貨羅. During the 5th century AD, Bactria was controlled by the Xionites and the Hephthalites, but was subsequently reconquered by the Sassanid Empire.

=== Introduction of Islam ===

By the mid-7th century AD, Islam under the Rashidun Caliphate had come to rule much of the Middle East and western areas of Central Asia.

In 663 AD, the Umayyad Caliphate attacked the Buddhist Shahi dynasty ruling in Tokharistan. The Umayyad forces captured the area around Balkh, including the Buddhist monastery at Nava Vihara, causing the Shahis to retreat to the Kabul Valley.

In the 8th century AD, a Persian from Balkh known as Saman Khuda left Zoroastrianism for Islam while living under the Umayyads. His children founded the Samanid Empire (875–999 AD). Persian became the official language and had a higher status than Bactrian, because it was the language of Muslim rulers. It eventually replaced the latter as the common language due to the preferential treatment as well as colonization.

== Bactrian people ==

Several important trade routes from India and China (including the Silk Road) passed through Bactria and, as early as the Bronze Age, this had allowed the accumulation of vast amounts of wealth by the mostly nomadic population. The first proto-urban civilization in the area arose during the 2nd millennium BC.

Control of these lucrative trade routes, however, attracted foreign interest, and in the 6th century BC the Bactrians were conquered by the Persians, and in the 4th century BC by Alexander the Great. These conquests marked the end of Bactrian independence. From around 304 BC the area formed part of the Seleucid Empire, and from around 250 BC it was the centre of a Greco-Bactrian kingdom, ruled by the descendants of Greeks who had settled there following the conquest of Alexander the Great.

The Greco-Bactrians, also known in Sanskrit as Yavanas, worked in cooperation with the native Bactrian aristocracy. By the early 2nd century BC the Greco-Bactrians had created an impressive empire that stretched southwards to include north-west India. By about 135 BC, however, this kingdom had been overrun by invading Yuezhi tribes, an invasion that later brought about the rise of the powerful Kushan Empire.

Bactrians were recorded in Strabo&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot;:
&quot;Now in early times the Sogdians and Bactrians did not differ much from the nomads in their modes of life and customs, although the Bactrians were a little more civilised; however, of these, as of the others, Onesicritus does not report their best traits, saying, for instance, that those who have become helpless because of old age or sickness are thrown out alive as prey to dogs kept expressly for this purpose, which in their native tongue are called &quot;undertakers,&quot; and that while the land outside the walls of the metropolis of the Bactrians looks clean, yet most of the land inside the walls is full of human bones; but that Alexander broke up the custom.&quot;

The Bactrians spoke Bactrian, a north-eastern Iranian language. Bactrian became extinct, replaced by north-eastern Iranian languages such as Munji, Yidgha, Ishkashimi, and Pashto. The &quot;Encyclopaedia Iranica&quot; states: The principal religions of the area before the Islamic invasion were Zoroastrianism and Buddhism.

Contemporary Tajiks are the descendants of ancient Eastern Iranian inhabitants of Central Asia, in particular, the Sogdians and the Bactrians, and possibly other groups, with an admixture of Western Iranian Persians and non-Iranian peoples. The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; states:

== In popular culture ==
* The six-part documentary &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Lost World&quot; explores the possible sites of Bactrian cities that historians believe were founded by Alexander the Great, including Alexandria on the Oxus. The series also explores the pre-existing Oxus civilization.
* The site was portrayed in the 2004 film &quot;Alexander&quot; where Darius III was found dying.

<text>Catherine Fabienne Dorléac (born 22 October 1943), known professionally as Catherine Deneuve (, , ), is a French actress. She is considered one of the greatest European actresses on film. In 2020, &quot;The New York Times&quot; ranked her as one of the greatest actors of the 21st century.

Deneuve made her screen debut in 1957 at age 13, in a film shot the previous year when she was only 12. A major figure of the New Wave, she became, like Brigitte Bardot and Alain Delon, one of the best-known French artists in the world. In a career spanning nearly 70 years, she has played more than a hundred roles and is recognized in France and internationally for being one of the key faces of the musical film genre with appearances in &quot;The Umbrellas of Cherbourg&quot;, &quot;The Young Girls of Rochefort,&quot; &quot;Donkey Skin&quot;, &quot;8 Women&quot; and &quot;The Beloved.&quot; Early in her career, she gained acclaim for her portrayals of aloof and mysterious beauties while working for well-known directors such as Luis Buñuel, François Truffaut, Jacques Demy, Roman Polanski, and Agnès Varda. She played in films attracting a total of nearly 99 million spectators in theaters, making her the working actress with the most admissions in France. In 1985, she succeeded Mireille Mathieu as the official face of Marianne, France&#x27;s national symbol of liberty.

She has received numerous accolades over her career including two César Awards and the Venice Film Festival&#x27;s Volpi Cup for Best Actress as well as nominations for an Academy Award and BAFTA Award. She has received honorary awards, including the Berlin International Film Festival&#x27;s Golden Bear in 1998, the Cannes Film Festival&#x27;s Honorary Palme d&#x27;Or in 2005, and the Venice Film Festival&#x27;s Golden Lion in 2022.

==Early life==

Deneuve was born Catherine Fabienne Dorléac in Paris, the daughter of French stage actors Maurice Dorléac and Renée Simonot. Deneuve had two sisters, Françoise Dorléac (21 March 1942 – 26 June 1967) and Sylvie Dorléac (born 14 December 1946), as well as a maternal half-sister, Danièle, whom their mother had out of wedlock in 1936 with Aimé Clariond. Deneuve used her mother&#x27;s maiden name, which she chose for her stage name, in order to differentiate herself from her sisters. Deneuve attended Catholic schools.

==Film career==
=== 1957–1970: Breakthrough and acclaim ===

Deneuve made her film debut with a small role in André Hunebelle&#x27;s &quot;Les Collégiennes&quot; (1957) with her younger sister Sylvie Dorléac who, like their older half-sister Daniele, was an occasional child actress. She subsequently appeared in several films for director Roger Vadim as well as in &quot;L&#x27;Homme à femmes&quot; (1960), which caught the eye of Jacques Demy, who cast Deneuve as Geneviève Emery in his romantic film musical &quot;The Umbrellas of Cherbourg&quot; (1964), the film that brought her to stardom. The film received critical acclaim winning the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 1964 Cannes Film Festival. &quot;Variety&quot; praised her performance describing her writing, &quot;Catherine Deneuve, a winsome-looking type that other directors have forced to act, here is allowed to be herself. She etches a fine portrait of a 16-year-old in love.&quot; The same year she acted in several films including the anthology film &quot;The World&#x27;s Most Beautiful Swindlers&quot; in a segment directed by Claude Chabrol and the comedy &quot;Male Hunt&quot; directed by Édouard Molinaro. 

In her English-language debut, Deneuve played the cold but erotic persona, for which she would be nicknamed the &quot;ice maiden&quot;, in Roman Polanski&#x27;s psychological horror thriller &quot;Repulsion&quot; (1965). For her performance she was nominated for the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress. Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote, &quot;Catherine Deneuve&#x27;s glassy stare of anxiety dominates the movie&quot; comparing her to Janet Leigh in &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960). In 1966 she starred in the Agnès Varda fantasy film &quot;Les Créatures&quot; and Jean-Paul Rappeneau&#x27;s &quot;A Matter of Resistance&quot;. The following year, she reunited with Demy for another musical &quot;The Young Girls of Rochefort&quot; (1967) acting alongside George Chakiris and Gene Kelly. She played a twin to her real-life older sister, Françoise Dorléac (as Solange), in what would be their only film together, Dorléac died in a car accident a few months after the movie opened. That same year she starred in Luis Buñuel&#x27;s psychological erotic drama &quot;Belle de Jour&quot; (1967). Deneuve stars as a young woman who spends her midweek afternoons as a high-class prostitute, while her husband is at work. For her performance, she received a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role. Melissa Anderson writing for Criterion declared, &quot;Deneuve&#x27;s performance in &quot;Belle de jour&quot; turned out to be one of her most iconic&quot;.

In 1969, Deneuve starred in Stuart Rosenberg&#x27;s American romantic comedy film &quot;The April Fools&quot;, starring opposite Jack Lemmon. That same year she acted in François Truffaut&#x27;s romantic crime drama &quot;Mississippi Mermaid&quot; acting alongside Jean-Paul Belmondo. &quot;The New York Times&quot; film critic Vincent Canby praised the film writing, &quot;As in all of Truffaut&#x27;s films, love leads only to an uncertain future that, at best, may contain some joy along with the inevitable misery. Truffaut&#x27;s special talent, however, is for communicating a sense of the value of that joy.&quot; She reunited with Buñel for the drama &quot;Tristana&quot; (1970) acting alongside Fernando Rey and Franco Nero. Her work for Buñuel would be her best known. That same year, she reunited with Jacques Demy for the musical fantasy &quot;Donkey Skin&quot; (1970) based on the 1965 fairy tale of the same name by Charles Perrault. Roger Ebert praised the film writing, &quot;It provides a visual feast and fanciful imaginations, and Deneuve was then, as she was before and since, a great beauty with the confidence such beauty requires.&quot;

=== 1971–1989: Established actress ===

In 1971, Deneuve starred in Nadine Trintignant&#x27;s &quot;It Only Happens to Others&quot; opposite Marcello Mastroianni. She also starred in Marco Ferreri&#x27;s Italian drama &quot;Liza&quot; (1972), Jean-Pierre Melville&#x27;s French crime film &quot;Un flic&quot; (1972), and Jacques Demy&#x27;s French comedy &quot;A Slightly Pregnant Man&quot; (1973). She starred in Robert Aldrich&#x27;s crime film &quot;Hustle&quot; (1975) with Burt Reynolds. Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; awarded a full four stars out of four and wrote that &quot;violence takes a back seat to character development and storytelling techniques that are classical. &quot;Hustle&quot; is the kind of picture you don&#x27;t want to see end. It&#x27;s going to be a cult favorite.&quot; That same year, she acted in Jean-Paul Rappeneau&#x27;s adventure film &quot;Le Sauvage&quot; (1975) with Yves Montand. The following year, she acted in Claude Lelouch&#x27;s &quot;Second Chance&quot; (1976).

In the 1980s, Deneuve&#x27;s films included François Truffaut&#x27;s &quot;Le Dernier métro&quot; (1980) with Gérard Depardieu for which she won the César Award for Best Actress and the David di Donatello Award for Best Actress. She gained acclaim for her role in Tony Scott&#x27;s &quot;The Hunger&quot; (1983) as a bisexual vampire, co-starring with David Bowie and Susan Sarandon, a role which brought her a significant lesbian following, mostly among the gothic subculture. During this time, she received César Award for Best Actress nominations for her roles in André Téchiné&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;Hotel America&quot; (1981), Jean-Pierre Mocky&#x27;s French drama film &quot;Agent trouble&quot; (1987), and François Dupeyron&#x27;s drama &quot;Drôle d&#x27;endroit pour une rencontre&quot; (1988).

Deneuve&#x27;s part in Lars von Trier&#x27;s musical drama &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot; (2000), alongside Icelandic singer Björk was subject to considerable critical scrutiny.

Though she later apologized to all the victims who felt offended by the letter, she defended her involvement by saying there were &quot;nothing in the letter&quot; to &quot;Le Monde&quot; that said &quot;anything good about harassment, otherwise [she] wouldn&#x27;t have signed it&quot;.

==Personal life==
Besides her native French, Deneuve speaks fluent Italian and English, and has some knowledge of Spanish. Her hobbies and passions include gardening, drawing, photography, reading, music, cinema, fashion, antiques and decoration. According to a 1996 &quot;The New York Times&quot; article, she is a practising Roman Catholic.

For decades, Deneuve has had an apartment on Place Saint-Sulpice in the 6th arrondissement of Paris. From 1989 to 2014, she also owned Château de Primard, a mansion in Guainville.

=== Marriage and family ===
Deneuve has been married once: to photographer David Bailey from 1965 to 1972, though they separated in 1967. She has lived with director Roger Vadim, actor Marcello Mastroianni, cinematographer Hugh Johnson, and Canal+ tycoon Pierre Lescure.

Deneuve has two children: actor Christian Vadim (born 18 June 1963), from her relationship with Roger Vadim, and actress Chiara Mastroianni (born 28 May 1972), from her relationship with Marcello Mastroianni. She has five grandchildren. Deneuve has not had a public relationship since her breakup with Lescure in 1991, with whom she remains friends; Deneuve&#x27;s two children consider him their stepfather.

She is also rumoured to have had a brief relationship with TV host .

In recent decades, Deneuve&#x27;s highly private life has prompted speculation about her sexual orientation, which she acknowledged in a 2002 interview with &quot;Knack&quot; magazine: &quot;Now that people know nothing about my private life, they start guessing: is there still a man in her life and who is he then? When they see me two or three times with a female friend they say: we&#x27;ve always known that.&quot; Reports from 2000 said her beau was a 25-year-old technician she had met on a recent film, but no writer could identify him. In 2006, Deneuve told &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; that she was in a relationship, though she did not disclose his name.

A 2020 biography of Johnny Hallyday by Gilles Lhote says the singer maintained a carefully hidden, 56-year affair with Deneuve that started when they were teenagers in 1961 and continued until Hallyday&#x27;s death in 2017. 

Deneuve was a close friend of the artist Nall, and owns some of his works.

=== Health === 
On 6 November 2019, BBC News reported that Deneuve suffered a mild stroke and was recuperating in a Paris hospital. Despite the health scare, there was no damage to her motor functions. Five weeks later, she was released from hospital, and spent the remainder of 2019 recuperating at her Paris home.

Deneuve began smoking in 1960 at age 16, and has been known to smoke up to three packs a day. She quit in 1985 with the aid of hypnotherapy, but started again in 1996. She quit again after her 2019 stroke, but by 2025, had resumed the habit using an electronic cigarette.

She received nominations for an Academy Award for Best Actress for &quot;Indochine&quot; and a BAFTA Award for Best Actress for &quot;Belle de Jour&quot; (1968). She received the Venice Film Festival&#x27;s Volpi Cup for Best Actress for her role in &quot;Place Vendôme&quot; (1998).

In 2000, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars was dedicated to her. In 2013, she was honored for her lifetime achievement at the 26th European Film Awards. In 2015, she received the Lifetime Achievement Golden Orange Award from International Antalya Film Festival, Turkey. In 2020, &quot;The New York Times&quot; ranked her number 21 in its list of the 25 Greatest Actors of the 21st Century.

<text>Jean-Paul Charles Belmondo (; 9 April 19336 September 2021) was a French actor. Initially associated with the New Wave of the 1960s, he was a major French film star for several decades from the 1960s onward, frequently portraying police officers and criminals in action thriller films. His best known credits include &quot;Breathless&quot; (1960), &quot;That Man from Rio&quot; (1964), &quot;Pierrot le Fou&quot; (1965), &quot;Borsalino&quot; (1970), and &quot;The Professional&quot; (1981). An undisputed box-office champion like Louis de Funès and Alain Delon of the same period, Belmondo attracted nearly 160 million spectators in his 50-year career. Between 1969 and 1982 he played four times in the most popular films of the year in France: &quot;The Brain&quot; (1969), &quot;Fear Over the City&quot; (1975), &quot;Animal&quot; (1977), &quot;Ace of Aces&quot; (1982), being surpassed on this point only by Louis de Funès.

Belmondo frequently played heroic, brave, and virile characters, which made him popular with a wide audience both in France and abroad. Despite being heavily courted by Hollywood, Belmondo refused to appear in English-language films . During his career, he was called the French counterpart of actors such as James Dean, Marlon Brando and Humphrey Bogart. Described as an icon and national treasure of France, Belmondo was seen as an influential actor in French cinema and an important figure in shaping European cinema. In 1989, Belmondo won the César Award for Best Actor for his performance in &quot;Itinéraire d&#x27;un enfant gâté&quot;. He was nominated for two BAFTA Awards throughout his career. In 2011, Belmondo received the Palme d&#x27;honneur at the Cannes Film Festival, and in 2017 he received the César d&#x27;honneur at the 42nd César Awards.

==Early life==
Jean-Paul Belmondo was born in Neuilly-sur-Seine, a suburb of Paris, on 9 April 1933. Belmondo&#x27;s father, Paul Belmondo, was a &quot;Pied-Noir&quot; sculptor who was born in Algeria of Italian descent, whose parents were of Sicilian and Piedmontese origin. His mother, 
Sarah Madeleine Rainaud-Richard, was a painter. As a boy, he was more interested in sport than school, developing a particular interest in boxing and soccer.

Belmondo made his amateur boxing debut on 10 May 1949 in Paris when he knocked out René Desmarais in one round. Belmondo&#x27;s boxing career was undefeated, but brief. He won three straight first-round knockout victories from 1949 to 1950. &quot;I stopped when the face I saw in the mirror began to change&quot;, he later said.

He did his National Service in French North Africa where he hit himself with a rifle butt to end his military service.

Belmondo was interested in acting. His late teenage years were spent at a private drama school, and he began performing comedy sketches in the provinces. He studied under Raymond Giraud and then attended the Conservatoire of Dramatic Arts when he was twenty. He studied there for three years. He probably would have won the prize for best actor, but he participated in a sketch mocking the school, which offended the jury; this resulted in his getting only an honourable mention, &quot;which nearly set off a riot among his incensed fellow students&quot; in August 1956, according to one report. The incident made front-page news.

==Career==
===1950s===

Belmondo&#x27;s acting career properly began in 1953, with two performances at the Théâtre de l&#x27;Atelier in Paris in Jean Anouilh&#x27;s &quot;Médée&quot; and Georges Neveux&#x27;s &quot;Zamore&quot;. Belmondo began touring the provinces with friends including Annie Girardot and Guy Bedos.

Belmondo first appeared in the short &quot;Moliere&quot; (1956). His first film role was a scene with Jean-Pierre Cassel in &quot;On Foot, on Horse, and on Wheels&quot; (1957), which was cut from the final film; however he had a bigger part in the follow-up &quot;A Dog, a Mouse, and a Sputnik&quot; (1958).

Belmondo had a small role in the comedy &quot;Be Beautiful But Shut Up&quot; (1958), appearing with Alain Delon, followed by a role as a gangster in &quot;Young Sinners&quot; (1958), directed by Marcel Carné.

Belmondo supported Bourvil and Arletty in &quot;Sunday Encounter&quot; (1958). Jean-Luc Godard directed him in a short, &quot;Charlotte and Her Boyfriend&quot; (1958), where Belmondo&#x27;s voice was dubbed by Godard after Belmondo was conscripted into the army. As part of his compulsory military service, he served in Algeria as a private for six months.

Belmondo&#x27;s first lead role was in &quot;Les Copains du dimanche&quot; (1958). He later had a supporting part in &quot;An Angel on Wheels&quot; (1959) with Romy Schneider then appeared in &quot;Web of Passion&quot; (1959) for Claude Chabrol. He played D&#x27;Artagnan in &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1959) for French television.

===1960s===

Belmondo starred in &quot;Consider All Risks&quot; (1960), a gangster story with Lino Ventura. He then played the lead role in Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s &quot;Breathless&quot; (&quot;À Bout de Souffle&quot;, 1960), which made him a major figure in the French New Wave.

&quot;Breathless&quot; was a major success in France and overseas and launched Belmondo internationally and as the face of the New Wave – even though, as he said &quot;I don&#x27;t know what they mean&quot; when people used that term. In the words of &quot;The New York Times&quot; it led to his having &quot;more acting assignments than he can handle.&quot;

He followed it with &quot;Trapped by Fear&quot; (1960), then the Italian film &quot;Letters By a Novice&quot; (1960). With Jeanne Moreau and director Peter Brook he made &quot;Seven Days... Seven Nights&quot; (1961) which he later called &quot;very boring.&quot;

Belmondo appeared as a gigolo in the anthology film &quot;Love and the Frenchwoman&quot; (1960). Then he made two Italian films, supporting Sophia Loren in &quot;Two Women&quot; (1961) as a bespectacled country boy (&quot;It may disappoint those who&#x27;ve got me typed&quot; said Belmondo. &quot;But so much the better.&quot;), then opposite Claudia Cardinale in &quot;The Lovemakers&quot; (1961).

&quot;Two Women&quot; and &quot;Breathless&quot; were widely seen in the United States and the UK. In 1961, &quot;The New York Times&quot; called him &quot;the most impressive young French actor since the advent of the late Gérard Philipe&quot;.

He was reunited with Godard for &quot;A Woman Is a Woman&quot; (1961) and made another all-star anthology comedy, &quot;Famous Love Affairs&quot; (1961).

Later, he acted in Jean-Pierre Melville&#x27;s philosophical movie &quot;Léon Morin, Priest&quot; (1961), playing a priest. He was a retired gangster in &quot;A Man Named Rocca&quot; (1962), then had a massive hit with the swashbuckler &quot;Cartouche&quot; (1962), directed by Philippe de Broca. Also popular was &quot;A Monkey in Winter&quot; (1962), a comedy where he and Jean Gabin played alcoholics.
François Truffaut wanted Belmondo to play the lead in an adaptation of &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;. This did not happen (the film was made several years later with Oskar Werner); instead Belmondo made two movies with Jean-Pierre Melville: the film noir crime film &quot;The Fingerman&quot; (&quot;Le Doulos&quot;, 1963) and &quot;Magnet of Doom&quot; (1963). He co-starred with Gina Lollobrigida in &quot;Mad Sea&quot; (1963) and appeared in another comedy anthology, &quot;Sweet and Sour&quot; (1963). There was some controversy when he was arrested for insulting a policeman, when the policeman was charged with assaulting Belmondo.

&quot;Banana Peel&quot; (1963), with Jeanne Moreau, was a popular comedy. Even more successful was the action-adventure tale &quot;That Man from Rio&quot; (1964), directed by Philippe de Broca - a massive hit in France, and popular overseas as well. A 1965 profile compared him to Humphrey Bogart and James Dean. It stated Belmondo was:
A later manifestation of youthful rejection... His disengagement from a society his parents made is total. He accepts corruption with a cynical smile, not even bothering to struggle. He is out entirely for himself, to get whatever he can, while he can. The Belmondo type is capable of anything. He knows he is defeated anyway... He represents something tough yet vulnerable, laconic but intense, notably lacking in neuroses or the stumbling insecurities of homus Americanus. He is the man of the moment, completely capable of taking care of himself - and ready to take on the girl of the moment too.
Belmondo&#x27;s own tastes ran to Tintin comics, sports magazines, and detective novels. He said he preferred &quot;making adventure films like &quot;Rio&quot; to the intellectual movies of Alain Resnais or Alain Robbe-Grillet. But with François Truffaut I&#x27;d be willing to try.&quot; His fee was said to be between US$150,000–$200,000 per film. Belmondo said he was open to making Hollywood films but he wanted to play an American rather than a Frenchman and was interested in Cary Grant type roles instead of James Dean/Bogart ones.

Belmondo made &quot;Greed in the Sun&quot; (1964) with Lino Ventura for director Henri Verneuil, who said Belmondo was &quot;one of the few young actors in France who is young and manly.&quot; &quot;Backfire&quot; (1964) reunited him with Jean Seberg, his &quot;Breathless&quot; co-star. After a role in &quot;Male Hunt&quot; (1964) he played the lead in &quot;Weekend at Dunkirk&quot; (1965), another big hit in France.

Belmondo dominated the French box office for 1964 – &quot;That Man from Rio&quot; was the fourth most popular movie in the country, &quot;Greed in the Sun&quot; was seventh, &quot;Weekend at Dunkirk&quot; ninth, and &quot;Backfire&quot; 19th.

&quot;Crime on a Summer Morning&quot; (1965) was less successful, though it still performed well on the strength of Belmondo&#x27;s name. &quot;Up to His Ears&quot; (1965) was an attempt to repeat the popularity of &quot;That Man Rio&quot;, from the same director, but did less well.

There were Hollywood offers, but Belmondo turned them down. &quot;He won&#x27;t make films outside of France&quot;, said director Mark Robson, who wanted him for &quot;Lost Command&quot; (1966). &quot;He has scripts stacked up and he doesn&#x27;t see why he should jeopardise his great success by speaking English instead of French.&quot;

Belmondo was reunited with Godard for &quot;Pierrot le Fou&quot; (1965) then made a comedy, &quot;Tender Scoundrel&quot; (1966). He had small roles in two predominantly English speaking films, &quot;Is Paris Burning?&quot; (1966) and &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (1967).

After making &quot;The Thief of Paris&quot; (1967) for Louis Malle, Belmondo took an acting hiatus for over a year. &quot;One day it seemed that life was passing me by&quot;, he said. &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to work. So I stopped. Then one day I felt like starting again. So I started.&quot;

Belmondo spent three months of that time off in Hollywood but did not accept any offers. He did not want to learn English and appear in English-language films:
Every Frenchman dreams of making a Western, of course but America has plenty of good actors. I&#x27;m not being falsely modest but why would they need me? I prefer a national film to an international film. Something is lost. Look at what happened to Italy when they went international.

Belmondo returned to filmmaking with the crime movie, &quot;Ho!&quot; (1968), then had a massive hit with a comedy co-starring David Niven, &quot;The Brain&quot; (1969). He later appeared in &quot;Mississippi Mermaid&quot; (1969) for François Truffaut with Catherine Deneuve and the romantic drama &quot;Love Is a Funny Thing&quot; (1969).

===1970s===

Belmondo starred alongside Alain Delon in &quot;Borsalino&quot; (1970), a successful gangster film. The latter produced the film and Belmondo ended up suing Delon over billing.

&quot;The Married Couple of the Year Two&quot; (1971) was also popular; even more so was &quot;The Burglars&quot; (1971).

Inspired by the success Alain Delon had producing his own films, Belmondo formed his own production company, Cerito Films (named after his grandmother, Rosina Cerrito), to develop movies for Belmondo. The first Cerito film was the black comedy &quot;Dr. Popaul&quot; (1972), with Mia Farrow, the biggest hit to date for director Claude Chabrol.

&quot;La scoumoune&quot; (1972) was a new version of &quot;A Man Named Rocca&quot; (1961). &quot;The Inheritor&quot; (1973) was an action film; &quot;Le Magnifique&quot; (1974), a satiric action romance reunited him with Philippe de Broca.

He produced as well as starred in &quot;Stavisky&quot; (1974). Then he made a series of purely commercial films: &quot;Incorrigible&quot; (1974), &quot;Fear Over the City&quot; (1975; one of Belmondo&#x27;s biggest hits of the decade and the first time he played a policeman on screen), &quot;Hunter Will Get You&quot; (1976), and &quot;Body of My Enemy&quot; (1977). &quot;Animal&quot; (1977) cast him as a stuntman opposite Raquel Welch and he starred as a policeman in &quot;Cop or Hood&quot; (1979).

===1980s===

In 1980, Belmondo starred in another comedy, &quot;Le Guignolo&quot;. He was a secret service agent in &quot;The Professional&quot; (1981) and a pilot in &quot;Ace of Aces&quot; (1982).

&quot;What intellectuals don&#x27;t like is success&quot;, said Belmondo. &quot;Success in France is always looked down on, not by the public, but by intellectuals. If I&#x27;m nude in a film, that&#x27;s fine for the intellectuals. But if I jump from a helicopter, they think it&#x27;s terrible.&quot;

Belmondo kept to commercial films: &quot;Le Marginal&quot; (1983) as a policeman, &quot;Les Morfalous&quot; (1984) as a sergeant in the French Foreign Legion, &quot;Hold-Up&quot; (1985) as a bank robber, and &quot;Le Solitaire&quot; (1987), again playing another policeman in the last one, the latter one was a big box office disappointment and Belmondo returned to theatre shortly afterwards.

In 1987, he returned to the theatre after a 26-year absence in a production of &quot;Kean&quot;, adapted by Jean-Paul Sartre from the novel by Alexandre Dumas. &quot;I did theatre for 10 years before going into movies and every year I planned to go back&quot;, he recalled. &quot;I returned before I became an old man.&quot;

For Claude Lelouch, Belmondo starred in and co-produced &quot;Itinerary of a Spoiled Child&quot; (1988). For his performance in the film, also titled as &quot; Itineraire d&#x27;un Enfant Gate&quot;, he won a César.

Belmondo claimed there were &quot;several reasons&quot; why he made fewer films in the 1980s. &quot;I&#x27;m now a producer so it takes time to organise things&quot;, he said. &quot;But it&#x27;s also difficult to find good screenplays in France. We have serious writing problems here. And I&#x27;d prefer to do theatre for a long time than take on a mediocre film.&quot;

===1990s and later career===
In 1990, he played the title role in &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; on the stage in Paris, another highly successful production. He had a small role in &quot;One Hundred and One Nights&quot; (1995) then the lead in Lelouch&#x27;s version of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (1995). He also appeared in the comedy &quot;Désiré&quot; (1996), &quot;Une chance sur deux&quot; (1998), and in the science fiction comedy &quot;Peut-être&quot; (1999).

In 2009, Belmondo starred in &quot;A Man and His Dog&quot; (&quot;Un homme et son chien&quot;), his final film role. Despite his difficulty in walking and speaking, he played a character who had the same disability. Following this film he was forced into retirement in 2011 having earlier suffered a stroke in 2001.

==Honours and awards==

In 1989, Belmondo won the César Award for Best Actor for his performance in &quot;Itinéraire d&#x27;un enfant gâté&quot;.

Belmondo was made a &quot;Chevalier&quot; (Knight) of the , promoted to &quot;Officier&quot; (Officer) in 1986 and promoted to &quot;Commandeur&quot; (Commander) in 1994. He was also made a &quot;Chevalier&quot; (Knight) of the Ordre National de la Légion d&#x27;Honneur, promoted &quot;Officier&quot; (Officer) in 1991, and promoted to &quot;Commandeur&quot; (Commander) in 2007.

During his career, he was nominated for two BAFTA Awards.

Belmondo received several honorary awards – Palme d&#x27;Or at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, Golden Lion at the 2016 Venice Film Festival, and César in 2017. In 2009, the Los Angeles Film Critics Association gave him a career achievement award.

In 2017, he was received a lifetime achievement honor at the 42nd César Awards accompanied by a two-minute standing ovation.

==Personal life and death==
On 4 December 1952, Belmondo married Élodie Constantin, with whom he had three children: Patricia (1953–1993), who was killed in a fire, Florence (born 1958), and Paul (born 1963). Belmondo and Constantin separated in 1965. She filed for divorce in September 1966, and it was finalised on 5 January 1968.

He had relationships with Ursula Andress from 1965 to 1972, Laura Antonelli from 1972 to 1980, Brazilian actress and singer Maria Carlos Sotto Mayor from 1980 to 1987, and Barbara Gandolfi from 2008 to 2012.

In 1989, Belmondo was in his mid-50s when he met 24-year-old dancer Natty Tardivel. The couple lived together for over a decade before marrying in 2002. On 13 August 2003, Tardivel gave birth to then 70-year-old Belmondo&#x27;s fourth child, Stella Eva Angelina. Belmondo and Tardivel divorced in 2008.

Belmondo was a supporter of football club Paris Saint-Germain.

Belmondo died on 6 September 2021 at his home in Paris, aged 88. He had been in failing health since he suffered a stroke a decade earlier. A national tribute was held on 9 September in Hôtel des Invalides. President Emmanuel Macron called Belmondo a &quot;national hero&quot;. The last tribute melody was &quot;Chi Mai&quot; by Ennio Morricone (from The 1981 film &quot;The Professional&quot;). The next day, 10 September, his funeral took place at the Saint-Germain-des-Prés church in the presence of relatives and family. The actors Alain and Anthony Delon also were present. His remains were cremated at the Père Lachaise Cemetery. Unlike his father, the sculptor Paul Belmondo, who was buried at the Montparnasse Cemetery, Jean-Paul&#x27;s ashes were scattered in the garden of his childhood home in Piriac-sur-Mer, in Loire-Atlantique.

==Legacy==

Throughout his career, he was called the French counterpart of actors such as James Dean, Marlon Brando, and Humphrey Bogart. On the day of his death, television channels in France altered their schedules to add screenings of his films, which drew over 6.5 million viewers cumulatively. For his performances as a police officer in many films, the National Police said that &quot;Even if it was just cinema you were in a way one of us, Mr. Belmondo&quot;. Throughout his career, he was regarded as an influential French actor and was often seen as the face of the French New Wave. Belmondo was described as the &quot;figurehead&quot; of the French New Wave, with his acting techniques often seen as capturing the style and imagination of France in the 1960s.

Many of his film roles, especially as Michel Poiccard, were regarded as &quot;legendary&quot; and highly influential. Despite his reluctance to learn English, many often believed had he accepted offers from Hollywood, his success there would have been comparable to that of French actors Charles Boyer or Maurice Chevalier. In an obituary for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, they hailed Belmondo as an &quot;integral part of the history of French cinema, and France itself&quot;. He was described as the &quot;epitome of cool&quot;.

American film director Quentin Tarantino cited Belmondo as an influence and called Belmondo &quot;a verb that represents vitality, charisma, a force of will, it represents super coolness&quot;. English director Edgar Wright said that &quot;cinema will never be quite as cool again&quot; following Belmondo&#x27;s death. He was described as an icon of French cinema and being influential in shaping modern European cinema.

<text>Pope Gelasius II (c. 1060/1064 – 29 January 1119), born Giovanni Caetani or Giovanni da Gaeta (also called &quot;Coniulo&quot;), was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 24 January 1118 to his death in 1119. A monk of Monte Cassino and chancellor of Pope Paschal II, Caetani was unanimously elected to succeed him. In doing so, he also inherited the conflict with Emperor Henry V over investiture. Gelasius spent a good part of his brief papacy in exile.

==Biography==
===Early life===
He was born between 1060 and 1064 at Gaeta into the Pisan branch of the Caetani family, and he became a monk of Monte Cassino. Pope Urban II, who wished to improve the style of papal documents, brought him to Rome and made Caetani a papal subdeacon (August 1088) and cardinal deacon of Santa Maria in Cosmedin (probably on 23 September 1088). As chancellor of the Holy Roman Church from 1089 to 1118, he drastically reformed the papal administration, establishing a permanent staff of clerks for the papacy, overcoming the previous custom of relying on Roman notaries to write papal documents, and introducing the minuscule curial script. His tenure also established the precedent of the papal chancellor always being a cardinal and holding the office for life or until elected pope.

===Pontificate===
Shortly after his unanimous election to succeed Pope Paschal II in 1118, he was seized by Cencio II Frangipane, a partisan of Emperor Henry V, but was freed by a general uprising of the Romans on his behalf.

Henry V sought to enforce the privilege of investiture conceded (and later revoked in 1112) by the papacy, under duress, by Paschal II. He drove Gelasius II from Rome in March 1118, pronounced his election null and void, and set up Maurice Bourdin, Archbishop of Braga, as antipope under the name of Gregory VIII.

Gelasius II fled to Gaeta, where he was ordained a priest on 9 March 1118 and on the following day received episcopal consecration. He at once excommunicated Henry V and the antipope and, under Norman protection, was able to return to Rome in July. But the disturbances of the imperialist party, especially those of the Frangipani, who attacked the Pope while celebrating Mass in the church of St. Prassede, compelled Gelasius II to go once more into exile. He set out for France, consecrating the cathedral of Pisa on the way, and arrived at Marseille in October. He was received with great enthusiasm at Avignon, Montpellier and other cities, held a synod at Vienne in January 1119, and was planning to hold a general council to settle the investiture contest when he died at the Abbey of Cluny.

<text>An ecoregion (ecological region) is an ecologically and geographically defined area that is smaller than a bioregion, which in turn is smaller than a biogeographic realm. Ecoregions cover relatively large areas of land or water, and contain characteristic, geographically distinct assemblages of natural communities and species. The biodiversity of flora, fauna and ecosystems that characterise an ecoregion tends to be distinct from that of other ecoregions. In theory, biodiversity or conservation ecoregions are relatively large areas of land or water where the probability of encountering different species and communities at any given point remains relatively constant, within an acceptable range of variation (largely undefined at this point).
Ecoregions are also known as &quot;ecozones&quot; (&quot;ecological zones&quot;), although that term may also refer to biogeographic realms.

Three caveats are appropriate for all bio-geographic mapping approaches. Firstly, no single bio-geographic framework is optimal for all taxa. Ecoregions reflect the best compromise for as many taxa as possible. Secondly, ecoregion boundaries rarely form abrupt edges; rather, ecotones and mosaic habitats bound them. Thirdly, most ecoregions contain habitats that differ from their assigned biome. Biogeographic provinces may originate due to various barriers, including physical (plate tectonics, topographic highs), climatic (latitudinal variation, seasonal range) and ocean chemical related (salinity, oxygen levels).

==History==
The history of the term is somewhat vague. It has been used in many contexts: forest classifications (Loucks, 1962), biome classifications (Bailey, 1976, 2014), biogeographic classifications (WWF/Global 200 scheme of Olson &amp; Dinerstein, 1998), etc.

The phrase &quot;ecological region&quot; was widely used throughout the 20th century by biologists and zoologists to define specific geographic areas in research. In the early 1970s, the term &#x27;ecoregion&#x27; was introduced (short for ecological region), and R.G. Bailey published the first comprehensive map of U.S. ecoregions in 1976. The term was used widely in scholarly literature in the 1980s and 1990s, and in 2001 scientists at the U.S. conservation organization World Wildlife Fund (WWF) codified and published the first global-scale map of Terrestrial Ecoregions of the World (TEOW), led by D. Olsen, E. Dinerstein, E. Wikramanayake, and N. Burgess. While the two approaches are related, the Bailey ecoregions (nested in four levels) give more importance to ecological criteria and climate zones, while the WWF ecoregions give more importance to biogeography, that is, the distribution of distinct species assemblages.

The TEOW framework originally delineated 867 terrestrial ecoregions nested into 14 major biomes, contained with the world&#x27;s 8 major biogeographical realms. Subsequent regional papers by the co-authors covering Africa, Indo-Pacific, and Latin America differentiate between ecoregions and bioregions, referring to the latter as &quot;geographic clusters of ecoregions that may span several habitat types, but have strong biogeographic affinities, particularly at taxonomic levels higher than the species level (genus, family)&quot;. The specific goal of the authors was to support global biodiversity conservation by providing a &quot;fourfold increase in resolution over that of the 198 biotic provinces of Dasmann (1974) and the 193 units of Udvardy (1975).&quot; In 2007, a comparable set of Marine Ecoregions of the World (MEOW) was published, led by M. Spalding, and in 2008 a set of Freshwater Ecoregions of the World (FEOW) was published, led by R. Abell.

Bailey&#x27;s ecoregion concept prioritizes ecological criteria and climate, while the WWF concept prioritizes biogeography, that is, the distribution of distinct species assemblages.

In 2017, an updated terrestrial ecoregions dataset was released in the paper &quot;An Ecoregion-Based Approach to Protecting Half the Terrestrial Realm&quot; led by E. Dinerstein with 48 co-authors. Using recent advances in satellite imagery the ecoregion perimeters were refined and the total number reduced to 846 (and later 844), which can be explored on a web application developed by Resolve and Google Earth Engine.

== Definition and categorization ==


An ecoregion is a &quot;recurring pattern of ecosystems associated with characteristic combinations of soil and landform that characterise that region&quot;. Omernik (2004) elaborates on this by defining ecoregions as: &quot;areas within which there is spatial coincidence in characteristics of geographical phenomena associated with differences in the quality, health, and integrity of ecosystems&quot;. &quot;Characteristics of geographical phenomena&quot; may include geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, hydrology, terrestrial and aquatic fauna, and soils, and may or may not include the impacts of human activity (e.g. land use patterns, vegetation changes). There is significant, but not absolute, spatial correlation among these characteristics, making the delineation of ecoregions an imperfect science. Another complication is that environmental conditions across an ecoregion boundary may change very gradually, e.g. the prairie-forest transition in the midwestern United States, making it difficult to identify an exact dividing boundary. Such transition zones are called ecotones.

Ecoregions can be categorized using an algorithmic approach or a holistic, &quot;weight-of-evidence&quot; approach where the importance of various factors may vary. An example of the algorithmic approach is Robert Bailey&#x27;s work for the U.S. Forest Service, which uses a hierarchical classification that first divides land areas into very large regions based on climatic factors, and subdivides these regions, based first on dominant potential vegetation, and then by geomorphology and soil characteristics. The weight-of-evidence approach is exemplified by James Omernik&#x27;s work for the United States Environmental Protection Agency, subsequently adopted (with modification) for North America by the Commission for Environmental Cooperation.

The intended purpose of ecoregion delineation may affect the method used. For example, the WWF ecoregions were developed to aid in biodiversity conservation planning, and place a greater emphasis than the Omernik or Bailey systems on floral and faunal differences between regions. The WWF classification defines an ecoregion as:

A large area of land or water that contains a geographically distinct assemblage of natural communities that:
:(a) Share a large majority of their species and ecological dynamics;
:(b) Share similar environmental conditions, and;
:(c) Interact ecologically in ways that are critical for their long-term persistence.

According to WWF, the boundaries of an ecoregion approximate the original extent of the natural communities prior to any major recent disruptions or changes. WWF has identified 867 terrestrial ecoregions, and approximately 450 freshwater ecoregions across the Earth.

== Importance ==
The use of the term ecoregion is an outgrowth of a surge of interest in ecosystems and their functioning. In particular, there is awareness of issues relating to spatial scale in the study and management of landscapes. It is widely recognized that interlinked ecosystems combine to form a whole that is &quot;greater than the sum of its parts&quot;. There are many attempts to respond to ecosystems in an integrated way to achieve &quot;multi-functional&quot; landscapes, and various interest groups from agricultural researchers to conservationists are using the &quot;ecoregion&quot; as a unit of analysis.

The &quot;Global 200&quot; is the list of ecoregions identified by WWF as priorities for conservation.

== Terrestrial ==

Terrestrial ecoregions are land ecoregions, as distinct from freshwater and marine ecoregions. In this context, &quot;terrestrial&quot; is used to mean &quot;of land&quot; (soil and rock), rather than the more general sense &quot;of Earth&quot; (which includes land and oceans).

WWF (World Wildlife Fund) ecologists currently divide the land surface of the Earth into eight biogeographical realms containing 867 smaller terrestrial ecoregions (see list). The WWF effort is a synthesis of many previous efforts to define and classify ecoregions.

The eight realms follow the major floral and faunal boundaries, identified by botanists and zoologists, that separate the world&#x27;s major plant and animal communities. Realm boundaries generally follow continental boundaries, or major barriers to plant and animal distribution, like the Himalayas and the Sahara. The boundaries of ecoregions are often not as decisive or well recognized, and are subject to greater disagreement.

Ecoregions are classified by biome type, which are the major global plant communities determined by rainfall and climate. Forests, grasslands (including savanna and shrubland), and deserts (including xeric shrublands) are distinguished by climate (tropical and subtropical vs. temperate and boreal climates) and, for forests, by whether the trees are predominantly conifers (gymnosperms), or whether they are predominantly broadleaf (Angiosperms) and mixed (broadleaf and conifer). Biome types like Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub; tundra; and mangroves host very distinct ecological communities, and are recognised as distinct biome types as well.

== Marine ==


Marine ecoregions are: &quot;Areas of relatively homogeneous species composition, clearly distinct from adjacent systems….In ecological terms, these are strongly cohesive units, sufficiently large to encompass ecological or life history processes for most sedentary species.&quot; They have been defined by The Nature Conservancy (TNC) and World Wildlife Fund (WWF) to aid in conservation activities for marine ecosystems. Forty-three priority marine ecoregions were delineated as part of WWF&#x27;s Global 200 efforts. The scheme used to designate and classify marine ecoregions is analogous to that used for terrestrial ecoregions. Major habitat types are identified: polar, temperate shelves and seas, temperate upwelling, tropical upwelling, tropical coral, pelagic (trades and westerlies), abyssal, and hadal (ocean trench). These correspond to the terrestrial biomes.

The Global 200 classification of marine ecoregions is not developed to the same level of detail and comprehensiveness as that of the terrestrial ecoregions; only the priority conservation areas are listed.

See Global 200 Marine ecoregions for a full list of marine ecoregions.

In 2007, TNC and WWF refined and expanded this scheme to provide a system of comprehensive near shore (to 200 meters depth) Marine Ecoregions of the World (MEOW). The 232 individual marine ecoregions are grouped into 62 marine provinces, which in turn group into 12 marine realms, which represent the broad latitudinal divisions of polar, temperate, and tropical seas, with subdivisions based on ocean basins (except for the southern hemisphere temperate oceans, which are based on continents).

Major marine biogeographic realms, analogous to the eight terrestrial biogeographic realms, represent large regions of the ocean basins: Arctic, Temperate Northern Atlantic, Temperate Northern Pacific, Tropical Atlantic, Western Indo-Pacific, Central Indo-Pacific, Eastern Indo-Pacific, Tropical Eastern Pacific, Temperate South America, Temperate Southern Africa, Temperate Australasia, and Southern Ocean.

A similar system of identifying areas of the oceans for conservation purposes is the system of large marine ecosystems (LMEs), developed by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

== Freshwater ==

A freshwater ecoregion is a large area encompassing one or more freshwater systems that contains a distinct assemblage of natural freshwater communities and species. The freshwater species, dynamics, and environmental conditions within a given ecoregion are more similar to each other than to those of surrounding ecoregions and together form a conservation unit. Freshwater systems include rivers, streams, lakes, and wetlands. Freshwater ecoregions are distinct from terrestrial ecoregions, which identify biotic communities of the land, and marine ecoregions, which are biotic communities of the oceans.

A map of Freshwater Ecoregions of the World, released in 2008, has 426 ecoregions covering virtually the entire non-marine surface of the earth.

World Wildlife Fund (WWF) identifies twelve major habitat types of freshwater ecoregions: Large lakes, large river deltas, polar freshwaters, montane freshwaters, temperate coastal rivers, temperate floodplain rivers and wetlands, temperate upland rivers, tropical and subtropical coastal rivers, tropical and subtropical floodplain rivers and wetlands, tropical and subtropical upland rivers, xeric freshwaters and endorheic basins, and oceanic islands. The freshwater major habitat types reflect groupings of ecoregions with similar biological, chemical, and physical characteristics and are roughly equivalent to biomes for terrestrial systems.

The Global 200, a set of ecoregions identified by WWF whose conservation would achieve the goal of saving a broad diversity of the Earth&#x27;s ecosystems, includes a number of areas highlighted for their freshwater biodiversity values. The Global 200 preceded Freshwater Ecoregions of the World and incorporated information from regional freshwater ecoregional assessments that had been completed at that time.

<text>Sardis ( ) or Sardes ( ; Lydian: , ; ; ) was an ancient city best known as the capital of the Lydian Empire. After the fall of the Lydian Empire, it became the capital of the Persian satrapy of Lydia and later a major center of Hellenistic and Byzantine culture. Now an active archaeological site, it is located in modern day Turkey, in Manisa Province, near the town of &quot;Sart&quot;.

==History==
Sardis was occupied for at least 3500 years. In that time, it fluctuated between a wealthy city of international importance and a collection of modest hamlets.

=== Early settlement ===

Sardis was settled before 1500 BC. However, the size and nature of early settlement is not known since only small extramural portions of these layers have been excavated. Evidence of occupation consists largely of Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age pottery which shows affinities with Mycenaean Greece and the Hittites. No early monumental architecture had been found as of 2011.

The site may have been occupied as early as the Neolithic, as evidenced by scattered finds of early ceramic fragments. However, these were found out of context, so no clear conclusions can be drawn. Early Bronze Age cemeteries were found 7 miles away along Lake Marmara, near elite graves of the later Lydian and Persian periods.

In the Late Bronze Age, the site would have been in the territory of the Seha River Land, whose capital is thought to have been located at nearby Kaymakçı. Hittite texts record that Seha was originally part of Arzawa, a macrokingdom which the Hittite king Mursili II defeated and partitioned. After that time, Seha became a vassal state of the Hittites and served as an important intermediary with the Mycenaean Greeks. The relationship between the people of Seha and the later Lydians is unclear, since there is evidence of both cultural continuity and disruption in the region. Neither the term &quot;Sardis&quot; nor its alleged earlier name of &quot;Hyde&quot; (in Ancient Greek, which may have reflected a Hittite name &quot;Uda&quot;) appears in any extant Hittite text.

=== Lydian Period ===


In the seventh century BC, Sardis became the capital city of Lydia. From there, kings such as Croesus ruled an empire that reached as far as the Halys River in the east. The city itself covered 108 hectares including extramural areas and was protected by walls twenty meters thick. The acropolis was terraced with white ashlar masonry to tame the naturally irregular mountainside. Visitors could spot the site from a distance by the three enormous burial tumuli at Bin Tepe.

The city&#x27;s layout and organization is only partly known at present. To the north/northwest, the city had a large extramural zone with residential, commercial, and industrial areas. Settlement extended to the Pactolus Stream, near which archaeologists have found the remains of work installations where alluvial metals were processed.

Multiroom houses around the site match Herodotus&#x27;s description of fieldstone and mudbrick construction. Most houses had roofs of clay and straw while wealthy residents had roof tiles, similar to public buildings. Houses often have identifiable courtyards and food preparation areas but no complete house has been excavated so few generalizations can be drawn about Sardian houses&#x27; internal layout.

Religious remains include a modest altar which may have been dedicated to Cybele, given a pottery fragment found there with her name on it. A possible sanctuary to Artemis was found elsewhere in the site, whose remains include marble statues of lions. Vernacular worship is evidenced in extramural areas by dinner services buried as offerings.

Textual evidence regarding Lydian-era Sardis include Pliny&#x27;s account of a mudbrick building that had allegedly been the palace of Croesus and was still there in his own time.

The material culture of Sardis is largely a distinctive twist on Anatolian and Aegean styles. The city&#x27;s artisans seemed to specialize in glyptic art including seals and jewelry. Their pottery blended Aegean and Anatolian pottery styles, in addition to distinctive twists which included the &quot;lydion&quot; shape and decorative techniques known as streaky-glaze and marbled-glaze. Narrative scenes on Sardian pottery are rare. Imported Greek pottery attests to the Lydians&#x27; &quot;Hellenophile attitude&quot; commented on by contemporary Greek writers. While those Greek authors were in turn impressed by Lydians&#x27; music and textiles, these aspects of Lydian culture are not visible in the archaeological record.

=== Destruction by Cyrus the Great ===
Sardis was conquered by Cyrus the Great around 547 BC. Having defeated the Lydian king Croesus at the Battle of Pteria and Battle of Thymbra, the Persians followed the retreating army back to Sardis and sacked it after a brief siege.
 Details of this event are largely known from Herodotus&#x27;s semi-mythicized account, but the destruction is highly visible in the archaeological record. In the words of excavator Nicholas Cahill:

It is rare that an important and well-known historical event is so vividly preserved in the archaeological record, but the destruction of Cyrus left clear and dramatic remains throughout the city.

The city&#x27;s fortifications burned in a massive fire that spread to parts of the adjoining residential areas. Wooden structures and objects inside buildings were reduced to charcoal. Mudbrick from the fortifications were toppled over on adjacent structures, preventing looting and salvage and thus preserving their remains.

Skeletons were found buried haphazardly among the debris, including those of Lydian soldiers who died violently. One soldier&#x27;s forearm bones had been snapped, likely a &quot;parry fracture&quot; indicating a failed attempt to counter the head injuries that killed him. A partly healed rib fracture suggests he was still recovering from an earlier injury during the battle. In a destroyed house, archaeologists found the partial skeleton of an arthritic man in his forties. The skeleton was so badly burned that archaeologists cannot determine whether it was deliberately mutilated or if the missing bones were carried away by animals.

Arrowheads and other weaponry turn up in debris all around the city, suggesting a major battle in the streets. The varying styles suggest the mixed background of both armies involved. Household implements such as iron spits and small sickles were found mixed in with ordinary weapons of war, suggesting that civilians attempted to defend themselves during the sack.

=== Persian Period ===
After the destruction, Sardis was rebuilt and continued to be an important and prosperous city. Though it was never again the capital of an independent state, it did serve as the capital for the satrapy of Sparda and formed the end station of the Persian Royal Road which began in Persepolis. It acted as a gateway to the Greek world, and was visited by notable Greek leaders such as Lysander and Alcibiades, as well as the Persian kings Darius I and Xerxes.

Relatively little of Persian Sardis is visible in the archaeological record. The city may even have been rebuilt outside the limits of the Lydian-era walls, as evidenced by authors such as Herodotus who place the Persian era central district along the Pactolus stream. The material culture of the city was largely continuous with the Lydian era, to the point that it can be hard to precisely date artifacts based on style.

Notable developments of this period include adoption of the Aramaic script alongside the Lydian alphabet and the &quot;Achaemenid bowl&quot; pottery shape. Jewelry of the period shows Persian-Anatolian cultural hybridization. In particular, jewelers turned to semi-precious stones and colored frit due to a Persian prohibition on gold jewelry among the priestly class. Similarly, knobbed pins and fibulae disappear from the archaeological record, reflecting changes in the garments with which they would have been used.

Buildings from this era include a possible predecessor of the later temple to Artemis as well as a possible sanctuary of Zeus. Textual evidence suggests that the city was known for its paradisoi as well as orchards and hunting parks built by Tissaphernes and Cyrus the Younger Burials of this period include enormous tumuli with extensive grave goods.

In 499 BC, Sardis was attacked and burned by the Ionians as part of the Ionian Revolt against Persian rule. The subsequent destruction of mainland Greek cities was said to be retribution for this attack. When Themistocles later visited Sardis, he came across a votive statue he had personally dedicated at Athens, and requested its return.

=== Hellenistic and Byzantine Sardis ===
In 334 BC, Sardis was conquered by Alexander the Great. The city was surrendered without a fight, the local satrap having been killed during the Persian defeat at Granikos. After taking power, Alexander restored earlier Lydian customs and laws. For the next two centuries, the city passed between Hellenistic rulers including Antigonus Monophthalmos, Lysimachus, the Seleucids, and the Attalids. It was besieged by Seleucus I in 281 BC and by Antiochus III in 215–213 BC, but neither succeeded at breaching the acropolis, regarded as the strongest fortified place in the world. The city sometimes served as a royal residence, but was itself governed by an assembly. 

In this era, the city took on a strong Greek character. The Greek language replaces the Lydian language in most inscriptions, and major buildings were constructed in Greek architectural styles to meet the needs of Greek cultural institutions. These new buildings included a prytaneion, gymnasion, theater, hippodrome, as well as the massive Temple of Artemis still visible to modern visitors. Jews were settled at Sardis by the Hellenistic king Antiochos III, where they built the Sardis Synagogue and formed a community which continued for much of late antiquity.

In 129 BC, Sardis passed to the Romans, under whom it continued its prosperity and political importance as part of the province of Asia. The city received three neocorate honors and was granted ten million sesterces as well as a temporary tax exemption to help it recover after a devastating earthquake in 17 AD.

Sardis had an early Christian community and is referred to in the New Testament as one of the seven churches of Asia. In the Book of Revelation, Jesus refers to the Sardians as not finishing what they started, being about image rather than substance. 

Later, trade and the organization of commerce continued to be sources of great wealth. After Constantinople became the capital of the East, a new road system grew up connecting the provinces with the capital. Sardis then lay rather apart from the great lines of communication and lost some of its importance.

During the cataclysmic 7th-century Byzantine–Sasanian War, Sardis was in 615 one of the cities sacked in the invasion of Asia Minor by the Persian Shahin. Though the Byzantines eventually won the war, the damage to Sardis was never fully repaired.

Sardis retained its titular supremacy and continued to be the seat of the metropolitan bishop of the province of Lydia, formed in 295 AD. It was enumerated as third, after Ephesus and Smyrna, in the list of cities of the Thracesion thema given by Constantine Porphyrogenitus in the 10th century. However, over the next four centuries it was in the shadow of the provinces of Magnesia-upon-Sipylum and Philadelphia, which retained their importance in the region.

===Later history===

Sardis began to decline in the 600s AD. It remained part of the Byzantine Empire until 1078 AD, by the Seljuk Turks. It was reconquered in 1097 by the Byzantine general John Doukas and came under the rule of the Byzantine Empire of Nicaea when Constantinople was taken by the Venetians and crusaders in 1204. However, once the Byzantines retook Constantinople in 1261, Sardis and surrounding areas fell under the control of Ghazw emirs. The Cayster valleys and a fort on the citadel of Sardis were handed over to them by treaty in 1306. The city continued its decline until its capture and probable destruction by the Turco-Mongol warlord Timur in 1402.

By the 1700s, only two small hamlets existed at the site. In the 20th century, a new town was built.

== Foundation stories ==
Herodotus recounts a legend that the city was founded by the sons of Heracles, the Heracleidae. According to Herodotus, the Heraclides ruled for five hundred and five years beginning with Agron, 1220 BC, and ending with Candaules, 716 BC. They were followed by the Mermnades, which began with Gyges, 716 BC, and ended with Croesus, 546 BC. 

The name &quot;Sardis&quot; appears first in the work of the Archaic era poet Sappho. Strabo claims that the city&#x27;s original name was &quot;Hyde&quot;.

==Geography==
Sardis was situated in the middle of Hermus River Valley, about south of the river. Its citadel was built on Mount Tmolus, a steep and lofty spur, while a lower town extended to the area of the Pactolus stream.

Today, the site is located by the present day village of &quot;Sart&quot;, near Salihli in the Manisa province of Turkey, close to the Ankara - İzmir highway (approximately from İzmir). The site is open to visitors year-round, where notable remains include the bath-gymnasium complex, synagogue and Byzantine shops is open to visitors year-round.

==Excavation history==


By the 19th century, Sardis was in ruins, with mainly visible remains mostly from the Roman period. Early excavators included the British explorer George Dennis, who uncovered an enormous marble head of Faustina the Elder. Found in the precinct of the Temple of Artemis, it probably formed part of a pair of colossal statues devoted to the Imperial couple. The 1.76 metre high head is now kept at the British Museum.

The first large-scale archaeological expedition in Sardis was directed by a Princeton University team led by Howard Crosby Butler between years 1910–1914, unearthing a temple to Artemis, and more than a thousand Lydian tombs. The excavation campaign was halted by World War I, followed by the Turkish War of Independence, though it briefly resumed in 1922. Some surviving artifacts from the Butler excavation were added to the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

A new expedition known as the Archaeological Exploration of Sardis was founded in 1958 by G.M.A. Hanfmann, professor in the Department of Fine Arts at Harvard University, and by Henry Detweiler, dean of the Architecture School at Cornell University. Hanfmann excavated widely in the city and the region, excavating and restoring the major Roman bath-gymnasium complex, the synagogue, late Roman houses and shops, a Lydian industrial area for processing electrum into pure gold and silver, Lydian occupation areas, and tumulus tombs at Bintepe.

During the 1960s, the acknowledgment of the local significance of the Jewish community in Sardis received notable confirmation through the identification of a substantial assembly hall in the northwestern part of the city, now known as the Sardis Synagogue. This site, adorned with inscriptions, menorahs, and various artifacts, establishes its function as a synagogue from the 4th to the 6th century. Excavations in adjacent residential and commercial areas have also uncovered additional evidence of Jewish life.

From 1976 until 2007, excavation continued under Crawford H. Greenewalt, Jr., professor in the Department of Classics at the University of California, Berkeley. Since 2008, the excavation has been under the directorship of Nicholas Cahill, professor at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.

Some of the important finds from the site of Sardis are housed in the Archaeological Museum of Manisa, including Late Roman mosaics and sculpture, a helmet from the mid-6th century BC, and pottery from various periods.

<text>Polish literature is the literary tradition of Poland. Most Polish literature has been written in the Polish language, though other languages used in Poland over the centuries have also contributed to Polish literary traditions, including Latin, Yiddish, Lithuanian, Russian, German and Esperanto. According to Czesław Miłosz, for centuries Polish literature focused more on drama and poetic self-expression than on fiction (dominant in the English speaking world). The reasons were manifold but mostly rested on the historical circumstances of the nation. Polish writers typically have had a more profound range of choices to motivate them to write, including past cataclysms of extraordinary violence that swept Poland (as the crossroads of Europe), but also, Poland&#x27;s collective incongruities demanding an adequate reaction from the writing communities of any given period.

The period of Polish Enlightenment began in the 1730s–40s and peaked in the second half of the 18th century. Leading Polish Enlightenment authors included Ignacy Krasicki (1735–1801) and Jan Potocki (1761–1815). Polish Romanticism, unlike Romanticism elsewhere in Europe, was largely a movement for independence against the foreign occupation. Early Polish Romantics were heavily influenced by other European Romantics. Notable writers included Adam Mickiewicz, Seweryn Goszczyński, Tomasz Zan and Maurycy Mochnacki.

In the second period, many Polish Romantics worked abroad. Influential poets included Adam Mickiewicz, Juliusz Słowacki and Zygmunt Krasiński.

In the aftermath of the failed January uprising, the new period of Polish Positivism began to advocate skepticism and the exercise of reason. The modernist period known as the Young Poland movement in visual arts, literature and music, came into being around 1890, and concluded with the Poland&#x27;s return to independence (1918). Notable authors included Kazimierz Przerwa-Tetmajer, Stanisław Przybyszewski and Jan Kasprowicz. The neo-Romantic era was exemplified by the works of Stefan Żeromski, Władysław Reymont, Gabriela Zapolska, and Stanisław Wyspiański. In 1905 Henryk Sienkiewicz received a Nobel Prize in literature for his &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; inspiring a new sense of hope. Literature of the Second Polish Republic (1918–1939) encompasses a short, though exceptionally dynamic period in Polish literary consciousness. The socio-political reality has changed radically with Poland&#x27;s return to independence. New avant-garde writers included Julian Tuwim, Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz, Witold Gombrowicz, Czesław Miłosz, Maria Dąbrowska and Zofia Nałkowska.

In the years of German and Soviet occupation of Poland, all artistic life was dramatically compromised. Cultural institutions were lost. Out of 1,500 clandestine publications in Poland, about 200 were devoted to literature. 
Much of Polish literature written during the Occupation of Poland appeared in print only after the conclusion of World War II, including books by Nałkowska, Rudnicki, Borowski and others. The situation began to worsen dramatically around 1949–1950 with the introduction of the Stalinist doctrine by minister Sokorski. Poland had three Nobel Prize winning authors in the later 20th century: Isaac Bashevis Singer (1978), Czesław Miłosz (1980) and Wisława Szymborska (1996). In the early 21st century, yet another writer was awarded the Prize: Olga Tokarczuk.

==Middle Ages==
Almost nothing remains of Polish literature prior to the country&#x27;s Christianization in 966. Poland&#x27;s pagan inhabitants certainly possessed an oral literature extending to Slavic songs, legends and beliefs, but early Christian writers did not deem it worthy of mention in the obligatory Latin, and so it has perished.

Within the Polish literary tradition, it is customary to include works that have dealt with Poland, even if not written by ethnic Poles. This is the case with Gallus Anonymus, the first historian to have described Poland in his work entitled &quot;Cronicae et gesta ducum sive principum Polonorum&quot; (Deeds of the Princes of the Poles), composed in sophisticated Latin. Gallus was a foreign monk who accompanied King Bolesław III Wrymouth in his return from Hungary to Poland. The important tradition of Polish historiography was continued by Wincenty Kadłubek, a thirteenth-century Bishop of Kraków, as well as Jan Długosz, a Polish priest and secretary to Bishop Zbigniew Oleśnicki.

The first recorded sentence in the Polish language reads: &quot;Day ut ia pobrusa, a ti poziwai&quot; (&quot;Let me grind, and you take a rest&quot;) – a paraphrase of the Latin &quot;Sine, ut ego etiam molam.&quot; The work in which this phrase appeared reflects the culture of early Poland. The sentence was written within the Latin language chronicle &quot;Liber fundationis&quot; from between 1269 and 1273, a history of the Cistercian monastery in Henryków, Silesia. It was recorded by an abbot known simply as Piotr (Peter), referring to an event almost a hundred years earlier. The sentence was supposedly uttered by a Bohemian settler, Bogwal (&quot;Bogwalus Boemus&quot;), a subject of Bolesław the Tall, expressing compassion for his own wife who &quot;very often stood grinding by the quern-stone.&quot; Most notable early medieval Polish works in Latin and the Old Polish language include the oldest extant manuscript of fine prose in the Polish language entitled the &quot;Holy Cross Sermons&quot;, as well as the earliest Polish-language &quot;Bible of Queen Zofia&quot; and the from the 14th century, not to mention the .

Most early texts in Polish vernacular were influenced heavily by the Latin sacred literature. They include &quot;Bogurodzica&quot; (Mother of God), a hymn in praise of the Virgin Mary written down in the 15th century, although popular at least a century earlier. &quot;Bogurodzica&quot; served as a national anthem. It was one of the first texts reproduced in Polish on a printing press; and so was the &quot;Master Polikarp&#x27;s Conversation with Death&quot; (Rozmowa mistrza Polikarpa ze śmiercią). At that time several Catholic Marian songs were written, with many of them being considered the most notable art pieces of the Medieval polish literature, including &quot;Lament of the Holy Cross&quot; that presents Mary in more humane and emotional way. Also, various hagiographic legends were created and Legenda o świętym Aleksym (The Legend of the Saint Alexius) is considered the most prominent. The legend treats about the figure of the Saint Alexius that chose the path of lifelong asceticism as a sacrifice of worldly goods in the name of God.

In the early 1470s, one of the first printing houses in Poland was set up by Kasper Straube in Kraków (see: spread of the printing press). In 1475 Kasper Elyan of Głogów (Glogau) set up a printing shop in Wrocław (Breslau), Silesia. Twenty years later, the first Cyrillic printing house was founded at Kraków by Schweipolt Fiol for Eastern Orthodox Church hierarchs. The most notable texts produced in that period include &quot;Saint Florian&#x27;s Breviary,&quot; printed partially in Polish in the late 14th century; &quot;Statua synodalia Wratislaviensia&quot; (1475): a printed collection of Polish and Latin prayers; as well as Jan Długosz&#x27;s &quot;Chronicle&quot; from the 15th century and his &quot;Catalogus archiepiscoporum Gnesnensium&quot;.

== Renaissance ==
With the advent of the Renaissance, the Polish language was finally accepted on an equal footing with Latin. Polish culture and art flourished under Jagiellonian rule, and many foreign poets and writers settled in Poland, bringing with them new literary trends. Such writers included Kallimach (Filippo Buonaccorsi) and Conrad Celtis. Many Polish writers studied abroad, and at the Kraków Academy, which became a melting pot for new ideas and currents. In 1488, the world&#x27;s first literary society, the &quot;Sodalitas Litterarum Vistulana&quot; (Vistula Literary Society) was founded in Kraków. Notable members included Conrad Celtes, Albert Brudzewski, Filip Callimachus and Laurentius Corvinus.

A Polish writer who used Latin as his principal vehicle of expression was Klemens Janicki (&quot;Ianicius&quot;), who became one of the most notable Latin poets of his time and was laureled by the Pope. Other writers such as Mikołaj Rej, and Jan Kochanowski, laid the foundations for the Polish literary language and modern Polish grammar. The first book written entirely in the Polish language appeared in this period – It was a prayer-book by Biernat of Lublin (c. 1465 – after 1529) called &quot;Raj duszny&quot; (&quot;Hortulus Animae&quot;, Eden of the Soul), printed in Kraków in 1513 at one of Poland&#x27;s first printing establishments, operated by Florian Ungler (originally from Bavaria). The most notable Polish writers and poets active in the 16th century include:
==Baroque==
The literature in the period of Polish Baroque (between 1620 and 1764) was significantly influenced by the great popularization of Jesuit high schools, which offered education based on Latin classics as part of a preparation for a political career. The studies of poetry required the practical knowledge of writing both Latin and Polish poems, which radically increased the number of poets and versifiers countrywide. On the soil of humanistic education some exceptional writers grew as well: Piotr Kochanowski (1566–1620) gave his translation of Torquato Tasso&#x27;s &quot;Jerusalem Delivered&quot;; Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski, a poet laureate, became known among European nations as &quot;Horatius christianus &quot; (Christian Horace) for his Latin writings; Jan Andrzej Morsztyn (1621–1693), an epicurean courtier and diplomat, extolled in his sophisticated poems the valors of earthly delights; and Wacław Potocki (1621–1696), the most productive writer of the Polish Baroque, unified the typical opinions of Polish szlachta with some deeper reflections and existential experiences. Notable Polish writers and poets active in this period include:
==Enlightenment==
The period of Polish Enlightenment began in the 1730s–40s and peaked in the second half of the 18th century during the reign of Poland&#x27;s last king, Stanisław August Poniatowski. It went into sharp decline with the Third and final Partition of Poland (1795), followed by political, cultural and economic destruction of the country, and leading to the Great Emigration of Polish elites. The Enlightenment ended around 1822, and was replaced by Polish Romanticism at home and abroad.

One of the leading Polish Enlightenment poets was Ignacy Krasicki (1735–1801), known locally as &quot;the Prince of Poets&quot; and Poland&#x27;s La Fontaine, author of the first Polish novel called &quot;The Adventures of Mr. Nicholas Wisdom&quot; (Mikołaja Doświadczyńskiego przypadki); he was also a playwright, journalist, encyclopedist and translator from French and Greek. Another prominent writer of the period was Jan Potocki (1761–1815), a Polish nobleman, Egyptologist, linguist, and adventurer, whose travel memoirs made him legendary in his homeland. Outside Poland he is known chiefly for his novel, &quot;The Manuscript Found in Saragossa,&quot; which has drawn comparisons to such celebrated works as the &quot;Decameron&quot; and &quot;the Arabian Nights&quot;.
Notable Polish writers and poets of the Enlightenment period include:
== Romanticism ==
Due to partitions carried out by the neighboring empires – which ended the existence of the sovereign Polish state in 1795 – Polish Romanticism, unlike Romanticism elsewhere in Europe, was largely a movement for independence against the foreign occupation, and expressed the ideals and the traditional way of life of the Polish people. The period of Romanticism in Poland ended with the Tsarist suppression of the January 1863 Uprising, marked by public executions by the Russians and deportations to Siberia.

The literature of Polish Romanticism falls into two distinct periods, both defined by insurgencies: the first around 1820–1830, ending with the November uprising of 1830; and the second between 1830 and 1864, giving birth to Polish Positivism. In the first period, Polish Romantics were heavily influenced by other European Romantics – Their art featured emotionalism and imagination, folklore, country life, as well as the propagation of the ideals of independence. The most famous writers of the period were: Adam Mickiewicz, Seweryn Goszczyński, Tomasz Zan and Maurycy Mochnacki. In the second period (after the January uprising), many Polish Romantics worked abroad, often banished from the Polish soil by the occupying power. Their work became dominated by the ideals of freedom and the struggle for regaining their country&#x27;s lost sovereignty. Elements of mysticism became more prominent. Also in that period, the idea of the &quot;poeta-wieszcz&quot; (nation&#x27;s bard) developed. The &quot;wieszcz&quot; functioned as spiritual leader to the suppressed people. The most notable poet among the &quot;leading bards of Romanticism, so recognized in both periods, was Adam Mickiewicz. Other two national poets were: Juliusz Słowacki and Zygmunt Krasiński. Polish writers and poets of the Romantic period include:
==Positivism==
In the aftermath of the failed January 1863 Uprising against Russian occupation, the new period of Polish Positivism—which took its name from Auguste Comte&#x27;s philosophy of Positivism—advocated skepticism and the exercise of reason. Questions addressed by Poland&#x27;s Positivist writers revolved around &quot;organic work,&quot; which included the establishment of equal rights for all members of society, including feminists; the assimilation of Poland&#x27;s Jewish minority; and the defense of the Polish population in the German-ruled part of Poland against &quot;Kulturkampf&quot; Germanization and the displacement of the Polish population by German settlers. The writers worked to educate the public about constructive patriotism, which would enable Polish society to function as a fully integrated &quot;social organism&quot;, regardless of adverse circumstances. Poland&#x27;s Positivist period lasted until the turn of the 20th century and the advent of the Young Poland movement.

=== Henryk Sienkiewicz ===
Several positivistic Polish writers&#x27; work was considered pivotal for the progress of Polish literature. Among them, Henryk Sienkiewicz received the greatest critical acclaim by being awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature as the first Polish writer. At first, he was appreciated for his journalism work. Next, he started to publish novellas that were widely admired, including &quot;Orso&quot; (a novella about a half-Indian and his partner who work together in a circus and are being physically abused by a circus owner), &quot;Bartek the Conqueror&quot; (a story of a Polish peasant that is forced to join Prussian army), &quot;Janko the Musician&quot; (a novella about a sickly boy who is exceptionally talented in music which frightens villagers), &quot;The Lighhouse Keeper&quot; (a deeply emotional novella treating about nostalgia and loneliness), &quot;From the Diary of a Poznań Teacher&quot; (a novella that criticizes prussian education system that polish people were forced into), and &quot;Sachem&quot; (a story about town in America that was built on the ruin of former Indian hamlet).
Sienkiewicz&#x27;s novellas were successful and popular, however they were completely overstrided by his novels&#x27; excellence. In 1884, 1886, and 1888, he released three volumes of his Trilogy: &quot;With Fire and Sword&quot; (Ogniem i Mieczem), &quot;The Deluge&quot; (Potop), and &quot;Pan Michael&quot; (Pan Wołodyjowski), respectively. The books were written &quot;to lift up the heart&quot; of the Polish nation during the era of the partitions and because of that the epic plot and heroic actions were favored over historical accuracy. Yet, Sienkiewicz tried to preserve the historical context of the books by using the archaic language. The novels also served as descriptions of potential causes of Poland&#x27;s fall. Having risen to international fame, Sienkiewicz continued to publish novels embedded in historical context. First, in 1896 he published Quo Vadis about ancient Rome under the rule of emperor Nero. The book was written in an extensively detailed way to depict the Roman Empire accurately. Next, he decided to reflect again on Poland&#x27;s most magnificent historic victories and released The &quot;Knights of the Cross&quot; (Krzyżacy) in 1900. The novel portrays medieval life in Poland, depicting the ongoing customs of life, and centers its plot on defeating the German Order of the Teutonic Knights. 5 years later, he won a Nobel Prize for his accomplishments (not for a single book) and dedicated his recognition to being a citizen of Poland, which at the time did not exist.

=== Bolesław Prus ===
Another prominent figure of Polish Positivism was Bolesław Prus. He debuted as a journalist, but soon he started publishing novellas. Their main motif was simple people who were emotionally hurt. Just as in &quot;The Barrel Organ&quot; (1880) Prus portrays a retired lawyer who excelled at his job and became a professional, yet, he suffers from the lack of a lifetime partner. The author symbolically uses the barrel organ as a means of uniting the lawyer with his new neighbors. Prus also published several novels that were the most representative literature pieces of positivistic philosophy. He wrote books like &quot;The Doll&quot; or &quot;The Outpost&quot;, which presented complex psychological portraits of the characters, encompassed several naturalistic descriptions of life in 19th-century Polish cities, and disseminated concepts of social equality, feminism, and work ideology. Especially, the novel &quot;The Doll&quot; became one of the most significant books of Polish literature. Prus depicted 19th-century Warsaw in an extensively detailed way, including thorough descriptions of the architecture, real-life events, social life, and customs, where Polish citizens lived along with Jews. The writer delves into not only the lives of aristocrats and upper-class citizens but also attempts to present the lives of poor and homeless people. Each character of the novel, despite their social class origin, is scrupulously portrayed. The author tries to convey multifaceted aspects of the life of each character, often ambiguously presenting them. By doing this, he preserves the realistic approach that dominated the literature of that time.
Prominent writers and poets of Polish Positivism included:
==Young Poland (1890–1918)==
The modernist period known as the Young Poland movement in visual arts, literature and music, came into being around 1890, and concluded with the Poland&#x27;s return to independence (1918). The period was based on two concepts. Its early stage was characterized by a strong aesthetic opposition to the ideals of its own predecessor (promoting &quot;organic work&quot; in the face of foreign occupation). Artists following this early philosophy of Young Poland believed in decadence, symbolism, conflict between human values and civilization, and the existence of art for art&#x27;s sake. Prominent authors who followed this trend included Kazimierz Przerwa-Tetmajer, Stanisław Przybyszewski and Jan Kasprowicz. The later ideology emerged in conjunction with the socio-political upheavals across Europe such as the 1905 Revolution against Nicholas II of Russia, the Norwegian independence, the Moroccan Crisis and others. It was a continuation of romanticism, often called neo-romanticism. The artists and writers following this idea covered a large variety of topics: from the sense of personal mission of a Pole exemplified by Stefan Żeromski&#x27;s prose, through condemnation of social inequality in works by Władysław Reymont and Gabriela Zapolska, to criticism of Polish society and Polish revolutionary history by Stanisław Wyspiański. In 1905 Henryk Sienkiewicz received a Nobel Prize in literature for his patriotic Trilogy inspiring a new sense of hope. Writers of this period include:
==Interbellum (1918–39)==
Literature of the Second Polish Republic (1918–1939) encompasses a short, though exceptionally dynamic period in Polish literary consciousness. The socio-political reality has changed radically with Poland&#x27;s return to independence. In large part, derivative of these changes was the collective and unobstructed development of programs for artists and writers. New avant-garde trends had emerged. The period, spanning just twenty years, was full of notable individualities who saw themselves as exponents of changing European civilization, including Tuwim, Witkacy, Gombrowicz, Miłosz, Dąbrowska and Nałkowska (PAL). They all contributed to a new model of the twentieth-century Polish culture echoing its own language of everyday life.

The two decades of Interbellum were marked by rapid development in the field of poetry, undivided and undiminished for the first time in over a century. From 1918 to 1939, the gradual and successive introduction of new ideas resulted in the formation of separate and distinct trends. The first decade of Polish interwar poetry was clear, constructive, and optimistic; as opposed to the second decade marked by dark visions of the impending war, internal conflicts within the Polish society, and growing pessimism. The whole period was amazingly rich nevertheless. In 1933 the Polish Academy of Literature (PAL) was founded by a decree of the Council of Ministers of the Republic (Rada Ministrów RP); as the highest opinion-forming authority in the country; it awarded Gold and the Silver Laurels (Złoty, and Srebrny Wawrzyn), the two highest national honors for contributions to literature until invasion of Poland in 1939. One of the most prominent poets of the interwar period was Bolesław Leśmian (member of PAL), whose creative personality developed before 1918, and in large part influenced both Interbellum decades (until his death in 1937). The literary life of his contemporaries revolved mostly around the issues of independence. All Polish poets treated the concept of freedom with extreme seriousness, and many patriotic works had emerged at that time, not to mention a particular variant of a poetic cult of Piłsudski.

==World War II==
In the years of German and Soviet occupation of Poland, all artistic life was dramatically compromised. Cultural institutions were lost. The environment was chaotic, and the writers scattered: some found themselves in concentration and labor camps (or Nazi-era ghettos), others were deported out of the country; some emigrated (Tuwim, Wierzyński), many more joined the ranks of the Polish underground resistance movement (Baczyński, Borowski, Gajcy). All literary outlets were forced to cease operation. Writers who remained at home began organizing literary life in conspiracy, including lectures, evenings of poetry, and secret meetings in the homes of writers and art facilitators. Polish cities where such meetings were held most frequently were: Warsaw, Kraków and Lwów. Writers participated in setting-up of the underground presses (out of 1,500 clandestine publications in Poland, about 200 were devoted to literature). Many fought in the Polish army in exile or resisted the Holocaust in a civil capacity. The generation of the &quot;Kolumbs,&quot; born around 1920, were active during the Warsaw uprising. Best-known representatives of the war years are:

==1945–56==
All texts published under Soviet rules were strictly censored.
Much of Polish literature written during the Occupation of Poland appeared in print only after the conclusion of World War II, including books by Nałkowska, Rudnicki, Borowski and others. The Soviet takeover of the country did not discourage Émigrés and exiles from returning, especially before the advent of Stalinism. Indeed, many writers attempted to recreate the Polish literary scene, often with a touch of nostalgia for the prewar reality, including Jerzy Andrzejewski, author of &quot;Ashes and Diamonds&quot;, describing (according to Communist design) Anti-communist resistance in Poland. His novel was adapted into film a decade later by Wajda. The new emerging prose writers such as Stanisław Dygat and Stefan Kisielewski approached the catastrophe of war from their own perspective. Kazimierz Wyka coined a term &quot;borderline novel&quot; for documentary fiction.

The situation began to worsen dramatically around 1949–1950 with the introduction of the Stalinist doctrine by minister Sokorski, on behalf of the increasingly violent Communist regime, which engaged in gross violations of human rights. In the years 1944–1956, around 300,000 Polish citizens were arrested, of whom many thousands were sentenced to long-term imprisonment. There were 6,000 death sentences pronounced against political prisoners, the majority of them carried out &quot;in the majesty of the law&quot;. Fearing for their proper jobs, many writers associated with the Borejsza&#x27;s publishing empire embraced the Sovietization of Polish culture. In 1953 the ZLP Union, run by Kruczkowski with a slew of prominent signatories, declared full support to persecution of religious leaders by the Ministry of Public Security. Death sentences were not enforced, although Father Fudali died in unexplained circumstances, as had 37 other priest and 54 friars already before 1953. Likewise, writer Kazimierz Moczarski from Armia Krajowa (the Home Army), tortured in jail by Romkowski&#x27;s subordinates for several years and sentenced to death, was pardoned and released only at the end of this period.

<text>Karl Jochen Rindt (; 18 April 1942 – 5 September 1970) was a racing driver, who competed under the Austrian flag in Formula One from to . Rindt won the Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Championship in with Lotus, and remains the only driver to have won the World Drivers&#x27; Championship posthumously, following his death at the ; he won six Grands Prix across seven seasons. In endurance racing, Rindt won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1965 with NART.

Born in Germany and raised in Austria, Rindt started motor racing in 1961. Switching to single-seaters in 1963, he was successful in both Formula Junior and Formula Two. In , Rindt made his debut in Formula One at the Austrian Grand Prix, before securing a full drive with Cooper for . After mixed results with the team, he moved to Brabham for and then Lotus in . It was at Lotus that Rindt found a competitive car, although he was often concerned about the safety of the notoriously unreliable Lotus vehicles. He won his first Formula One race at the 1969 United States Grand Prix. He had a very successful 1970 season, mainly racing the revolutionary Lotus 72, and won five of the first nine races. In practice for the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, he spun into the guardrails after a failure on his car&#x27;s brake shaft, and a poorly installed crash barrier gave way. Rindt was pronounced dead while on the way to hospital. As his closest competitor Jacky Ickx was unable to score sufficient points in the remaining races of the season, Rindt was awarded the World Championship posthumously. Rindt left behind his wife, Nina, and a daughter, Natasha.

Overall, he competed in 62 Grands Prix, winning six and achieving 13 podium finishes. He was also successful in sports car racing, winning the 1965 24 Hours of Le Mans paired with Masten Gregory in a Ferrari 250LM. Rindt was a popular figure in Austria and his success resulted in increased interest in motorsport and Formula One in particular. He hosted a monthly television show titled &quot;Motorama&quot; and set up a successful exhibition of racing cars in Vienna. During his time in Formula One, he was involved alongside Jackie Stewart in a campaign to improve safety in Formula One.

==Early life and family==
Jochen Rindt was born on 18 April 1942 in Mainz, Germany, to an Austrian mother and German father. His mother had been a successful tennis player in her youth and, like her father, studied law. Rindt&#x27;s parents owned a spice mill in Mainz, which he later inherited. They were killed in a bombing raid in Hamburg during the Second World War when he was 15 months old, after which he was raised by his grandparents in Graz, Austria. Although his grandfather chose to retain Rindt&#x27;s German citizenship, for his entire career he drove under an Austrian racing licence. In an interview, he described his heritage as a &quot;terrible mixture&quot; and, when asked if he felt more Austrian or German, said that he felt &quot;like a European&quot;. Rindt had one half-brother, Uwe, through his mother.

Rindt&#x27;s childhood friends and his brother described him as a &quot;laddish child&quot; who often performed tricks to amuse others. While on a skiing holiday, he broke his femoral neck, leading to several surgeries that left one leg shorter than the other. As a result of this, Rindt limped slightly for the rest of his life. At the age of sixteen, he received a moped and started racing his friends on motocross tracks. His time in school was troubled and he was excluded from schools several times. He said:

His chances of obtaining a licence were put into further jeopardy because he had collected eight recorded misdemeanours with the police during his youth. In 1960, he received his first car, an old Volkswagen Beetle. His interest in motorsport greatly increased when he visited the 1961 German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring with school friends, including fellow future Formula One driver Helmut Marko.

==Racing career==
===Beginnings===
Rindt drove his first race at the &quot;Flugplatzrennen&quot; in 1961, in his grandmother&#x27;s Simca Montlhéry. After missing the official application period, he only entered after a friendly high-ranking motorsport functionary from Graz intervened on his behalf. During the race, he was black flagged for his dangerous driving style and therefore disqualified; he did not immediately return to the pit lane as he was unaware of the regulations. Rindt entered several rallies with his Simca but did not achieve good results. It was only when he was provided with a race-prepared at cost price and with free servicing by a local dealer that he became more successful. In the Alfa Romeo, he achieved eight victories.

In 1963, Rindt switched to Formula Junior with the assistance of Kurt Bardi-Barry, a wealthy owner of a travel agency and one of Austria&#x27;s leading drivers at the time; Barry gave him his one-year-old Cooper T67 and the two men formed a partnership, driving to races together. Rindt was fastest in practice for his first race in Vallelunga, a race won by Barry, and took victory in his second at Cesenatico. In the race, Rindt had taken advantage of an accident in the early stages. While most drivers slowed for the incoming ambulance, he raced ahead between the straw barriers and the parked medical vehicle to take the lead. At the time, he was notorious for his dangerous style, almost crashing into the spectators at a race in the streets of Budapest.

===Formula Two===

Rindt was highly successful in Formula Two racing, amassing a total of 29 victories. He once again entered the series in partnership with Barry, driving Brabham cars. The engines provided by Cosworth were slower and inconsistent in performance; Rindt responded to his reduced pace by declaring: &quot;Then I just brake two metres later.&quot; He entered his first F2 race in April 1964 at the &quot;Preis von Wien&quot; at Aspern, retiring from both heats. The international motor racing world first took notice of him on 18 May 1964, when Rindt won the &quot;London Trophy&quot; race at the Crystal Palace circuit in a Brabham BT10 ahead of Graham Hill.

Like many other drivers at the time, Rindt continued to race in Formula Two races alongside his duties in Formula One; his last F2 appearance was the &quot;Festspielpreis der Salzburg&quot; in August 1970. In 1967, he dominated Formula Two, winning nine races in his Brabham BT23. As an experienced Formula One driver, he was graded &quot;A&quot;, meaning his results did not count towards the championship, and the title went to Jacky Ickx. Still, his performances led him to be called &quot;king of Formula 2&quot; by the racing press. He had a long-standing relationship with Roy Winkelmann, and drove with his team until it closed at the end of 1969.

===Sports cars===

Along with single-seater racing, Rindt took up sports car racing in the mid-1960s. Rindt started at the 24 Hours of Le Mans a total of four times. At his debut in , sharing a Ferrari 250LM with David Piper, the car retired too early for Rindt even to take the wheel.

Rindt&#x27;s best result came the following year at the 1965 24 Hours of Le Mans. Sharing the drive of a Ferrari 250LM with American Masten Gregory for the North American Racing Team, Rindt won the event. Neither driver was happy to race in a seemingly uncompetitive car. A 1998 article in &quot;Motor Sport&quot; stated that neither appeared to show much interest in the race, but instead it was &quot;more a case of &#x27;hope it breaks soon&#x27; so they could draw their money and split&quot;. At the start, the drivers had to run to their cars; Rindt entered with a forward roll that allowed him to get his foot on the throttle instantly and take an early lead. The pair experienced considerable trouble in the early part of the race; the car did not restart during Gregory&#x27;s first pit stop. Later, the engine failed partially and Gregory brought the car into the pits on only six of twelve cylinders. At this point, Rindt had already changed back into his civilian clothes, expecting their race to be over. After thirty minutes of repairs, the car restarted and Rindt and Gregory agreed to drive the rest of the event &quot;flat out&quot;, at full speed and with the accompanying risk. Rindt drove most of the night, advancing from 18th to third position by dawn. Gregory persuaded Rindt to let him drive the closing part of the race, suspecting that his young teammate might not drive moderately enough to nurse the car to the finish. Jacky Ickx later recalled that the two had driven &quot;like maniacs&quot;. Even so, the car survived, handing the pair what Ickx called an &quot;unexpected victory&quot;.

Later that year, Rindt drove, again in a Ferrari 250LM, at the 500 kilometre race at Zeltweg. He was able to win ahead of the better powered Ferrari of Mike Parkes owing to a special lever that manually activated the brake lights. Using the tool shortly before his actual braking point, Rindt was able to force Parkes to brake earlier than him which allowed him to stay ahead.

Apart from his 1965 victory, he never finished the race in Le Mans. In 1966, his Ford GT40 (shared with Innes Ireland) suffered an engine failure. A year later, he drove a Porsche 907 with Gerhard Mitter until their camshaft failed.

===Formula One===
====Cooper (1964–1967)====
Rindt made his Formula One debut at his home race, the 1964 Austrian Grand Prix, in a loaned Brabham BT11 supplied by the Rob Walker Racing Team. He retired on the 58th lap with a broken steering column in his only Grand Prix of the season.
For the 1965 Formula One season, Rindt signed as a permanent driver with Cooper, paired with Bruce McLaren. He was not immediately successful as Cooper, formerly a top team, were struggling at the time. In his first race, the 1965 South African Grand Prix, he developed transistor trouble; the damage was initially repaired but the problem recurred and Rindt had to retire from the race. His best result was a fourth place at the German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring. He ended the season with four points, 13th in the championship.
For , Cooper introduced the T81 chassis and used nine-year old Maserati V12 engines, which were powerful but heavy. A new engine formula was introduced for the season, with the capacity doubled to three litres. Many teams struggled with the new rules, leaving Cooper competitive even with their old Maserati V12s. After McLaren left, Rindt became team leader until world champion John Surtees joined from Ferrari. At the second race of the year, the , Rindt overcame an engine failure in practice to qualify second, next to Surtees on the front row of the grid. In a race affected by heavy rain, he overtook Surtees for the lead on lap four. He spun several times on the wet track and suffered from a limited-slip differential, but held onto the lead until lap 21, when Surtees repassed him and won. It was Rindt&#x27;s first ever podium finish in Formula One, after what &quot;Motor Sport&quot; magazine called a &quot;very courageous&quot; drive. Overall, he achieved three podium positions, handing him third place in the championship at the end of the year.

 was less successful, as Rindt only finished two races, the Belgian and Italian Grands Prix, both in fourth place. Six points meant that he ended the season in 13th place in the championship.

====Brabham (1968)====
Prior to , Rindt received offers from every team except Lotus and Honda, and moved to Brabham, who had been world champions in the two previous seasons. Technical problems restricted him that year. Brabham&#x27;s Repco V8 engine was not competitive against the now widely used Cosworth DFV and Rindt finished just two races, both in third place. At the season opener in South Africa on New Year&#x27;s Day, Rindt placed third, being elevated by a late retirement from Jackie Stewart and closing on second-placed Graham Hill towards the end. The race was won by Jim Clark, a close friend of Rindt&#x27;s. It was Clark&#x27;s final Formula One race; he died three months later at a Formula Two race at Hockenheim. Rindt was deeply affected by his death, telling Austrian journalist Heinz Prüller: &quot;If Jim Clark is not safe, what can happen to us?&quot; His second podium finish came in heavy rain and fog at the Nürburgring at the , a race dominated by Stewart, who finished four minutes ahead of Hill in second place. Rindt had closed on Hill in the latter stages of the race after the Englishman spun, and finished just four seconds behind after a close battle during the last lap. His eight points placed him twelfth in the championship at the end of the season.

During these years, he also raced in the Indianapolis 500 in both 1967 and 1968, but finished only 24th and 32nd, completing only five laps in 1968 after finishing slightly more than half of the 1967 race. After dropping out of the 1967 race, Rindt was interviewed on the radio network by Luke Walton. When asked what he thought of the &quot;500&quot;, he said &quot;not much&quot;. In an interview in 2014, Heinz Prüller recalled Rindt speaking about Indianapolis in 1967: &quot;In Indianapolis, I always feel like I am on my way to my own funeral.&quot; At another occasion, he said about the track: &quot;It is catastrophic, I only drive there because of the money.&quot;

====Team Lotus (1969–1970)====
=====1969 season=====

For the 1969 season, Rindt signed for the 1968 World Constructors&#x27; Champion Lotus, where he joined the defending Drivers&#x27; Champion Graham Hill. Rindt felt uncomfortable with the move, owing to the notorious unreliability of the Lotus car; in a twenty-month period between 1967 and 1969, the team was involved in 31 accidents. Hill alone had nine crashes between 1968 and 1970, which led him to joke: &quot;Every time I am being overtaken by my own wheel, I know I am in a Lotus.&quot; When Rindt joined Lotus, his friend and &quot;de facto&quot; manager Bernie Ecclestone, who had negotiated the deal, remarked that they were aware that Brabham may have been a better choice of team but the speed of the Lotus gave Rindt a chance to win the championship. Rindt commented: &quot;At Lotus, I can either be world champion or die.&quot; Because of his uncertainty about the wisdom of joining the team, Rindt did not sign the Lotus contract until shortly before the 1969 Spanish Grand Prix.

Rindt&#x27;s hesitancy appeared justified when both he and Hill suffered high speed crashes at the Spanish Grand Prix at Montjuïc. In both instances, the suspension mounted wings on the cars broke off, causing accidents that could have killed either driver. The effect of the failure lifted Rindt&#x27;s car off the track and into the barriers, where it collided with the stationary car of Hill, whose accident occurred at the same spot. Although Rindt only suffered a broken nose, one marshal lost an eye and another had his foot broken. Rindt was furious with Lotus&#x27;s team owner, Colin Chapman, over the failure; he told a reporter after the accident: &quot;I place the blame on him [Chapman] and rightfully so, because he should have calculated that the wing would break.&quot; In an interview on Austrian television a day later, he said: &quot;These wings are insanity [&quot;ein Wahnsinn&quot;] in my eyes and should not be allowed on racing cars. ... But to get any wisdom into Colin Chapman&#x27;s head is impossible.&quot; Asked whether he had lost trust in Lotus after the accident, he replied: &quot;I never had any trust in Lotus&quot;, going on to describe his relationship with the team as &quot;purely business&quot;. His accident left him sidelined for the , a race that Hill won.

Jackie Stewart later described Rindt&#x27;s 1969 season as the year that he &quot;came of age&quot;. At the end of the year, &quot;Motor Sport&quot; magazine called him &quot;[t]he only driver to challenge Stewart seriously throughout the season&quot;, albeit placing only fourth in the championship. The poor reliability of the Lotus 49B affected him; he retired from seven races. At the , Rindt fought a close battle with Stewart for the lead; both men were 90 seconds ahead of third-placed Jacky Ickx. The race was decided in Stewart&#x27;s favour only when Rindt had to enter the pits after part of his car&#x27;s bodywork started to rub on the tyre; he finished fourth. At the , he was involved in a memorable finish. Having started from pole position, he traded the lead with Stewart and Piers Courage several times. During the last lap, Rindt, Stewart, McLaren, and Jean-Pierre Beltoise were running close together as they approached the finish line. Stewart took the win, only eight hundredths of a second ahead of Rindt, while fourth placed McLaren was also within two tenths of a second. It was the closest 1–2–3–4 finish in the history of the sport. Rindt recorded his maiden Grand Prix win at the penultimate race of the season at Watkins Glen, winning $50,000—the largest monetary prize in Formula One history at the time. His victory was overshadowed by a serious accident involving his teammate Hill, who crashed after a high speed puncture and suffered major leg injuries.

=====1970 season=====
For , Rindt&#x27;s partner at Lotus was John Miles; Graham Hill had left the team to drive for Rob Walker&#x27;s customer franchise. Rindt became the clear team leader. At the first Grand Prix of the season in South Africa, he qualified fourth, but eventually retired with an engine failure after a first lap incident with Chris Amon and Jack Brabham, the latter of whom went on to win for the final time in his career. At the following race, the , Lotus introduced their revolutionary new car design. Instead of one conventional front radiator, the Lotus 72 featured two, one on each side of the cockpit. Further innovations included torsion bar suspension in place of the widely used coil-springs, and all four brakes mounted inboard to reduce unsprung weight. During its first practice session, the left semi-axle of the car broke, sending Rindt into a spin. The car also proved ineffective in the race; Rindt retired after nine laps.

As the Lotus 72 was not as effective as the team hoped, it was returned to the factory to be re-built and Rindt used the old Lotus 49 for the next race in Monaco. The necessity of using tyres intended for the new design made the older car unstable. Seemingly unaffected by this, Rindt produced what his race engineer Herbie Blash called &quot;the race of his life&quot;. From eighth on the grid, he worked his way through the field on a track notorious for presenting few overtaking opportunities. In the closing stages, he was second, steadily closing the gap on leader Jack Brabham. On the final lap, on the final corner, Brabham braked too late, touched the kerbstone and went straight ahead into the straw bales, allowing Rindt through to take his first victory of the season. Rindt used the Lotus 49 one last time at the , a race at which he heavily criticised the organisers for installing guardrails that had gaps of several metres between them. He had originally started practice in the remodelled 72, but the car came to a halt early in the session with a broken lower wishbone, forcing Rindt to switch cars once more. Despite engine troubles during the rest of practice, he managed to qualify on the front row, but later retired with another engine failure.
At the , Rindt eventually used the new Lotus 72, better sorted after alterations had been made. He set pole position in the final practice session, almost a quarter of a second ahead of his closest challenger, Stewart. Rindt went on to take his maiden victory in the Lotus 72, but it was not a joyful occasion for him; on lap 23, his close friend Piers Courage, with whom he had eaten dinner just the night before, died in a fiery crash. Rindt was heavily shaken by the loss of yet another fellow driver and contemplated retirement.

After the success at Zandvoort, Rindt gained confidence in the new Lotus 72, describing it as &quot;the best racing car that exists at the moment&quot;. But he continued to have problems. During practice for the , Rindt opted to drop his new all-enveloping Bell-Star crash helmet, finding it too hot. He went back to using his open-front helmet, only to be hit in the face by a stone from another car, causing a deep cut on his right cheek. He also suffered a steering failure on his car. Furious over yet another mechanical problem, he stormed into the Lotus garage and yelled at Colin Chapman: &quot;If this happens again and I survive, I will kill all of you!&quot; Rindt was still able to win the race, taking the lead in the championship. The next race was the at Brands Hatch. Jacky Ickx established an early lead ahead of Brabham and Rindt, but when Ickx&#x27;s transmission failed, Rindt seized the opportunity to pass Brabham for the lead. Brabham was then able to regain the top spot on lap 69 as Rindt missed a gear and looked the certain winner, only to repeat his misfortune of Monaco: on the last lap, he ran out of fuel, allowing Rindt to take his third win in a row. His victory was cast into doubt shortly after the race when Chief Scrutineer Cecil Mitchell found the rear aerofoil not at the regulated height. Rindt was provisionally disqualified, only to be reinstated as winner after three hours of deliberation.

The was originally set to take place at its traditional venue, the Nürburgring. The Grand Prix Drivers&#x27; Association (GPDA), represented by Rindt and Graham Hill, demanded changes to the circuit to increase safety, including Armco barriers along the entire of the &quot;Nordschleife&quot;. No agreement was reached and the Grand Prix moved to Hockenheim, where Rindt took his fourth victory in succession. The race was another two-way fight, this time between Rindt and Ickx, who exchanged the lead several times. This meant that he could have secured the drivers&#x27; title at his home event at the . He set the Lotus 72 on pole position, to the delight of the crowd, but retired from the race with an engine failure. The title decision was therefore postponed to the next race in Monza.

==Death and legacy==

The paddock moved to the at Monza, a track known for high speeds; drivers often used the slipstream of cars in front to increase their pace. Because of this, many teams, including Lotus, opted to drop the rear wings mounted on the cars to reduce drag and further increase speeds. The more powerful flat-12 Ferraris of Jacky Ickx and Clay Regazzoni had been up to faster than the Lotus at the previous race in Austria. Rindt&#x27;s teammate John Miles was unhappy with the wingless setup in Friday practice, reporting that the car &quot;wouldn&#x27;t run straight&quot;. Rindt reported no such problems, and Chapman recalled that Rindt reported the car to be &quot;almost 800 rpm faster on the straight&quot; without wings.

On the following day, Rindt ran with higher gear ratios fitted to his car to take advantage of the reduced drag, increasing the car&#x27;s potential top speed to . On his fifth lap of his practice session, he crashed heavily at the approach to the Parabolica corner. Denny Hulme, who was following Rindt at the time, described the accident as follows:
Upon impact, a joint in the crash barrier parted, the suspension of the vehicle went under the barrier, and the car hit a stanchion head-on. The front end was destroyed. Rindt was in the habit of using only four points on the five-point harness then available and did not wear the crotch straps, as he wanted to be able to exit the car quickly in the event of fire. As a result, upon impact he slid under the belts, and the belts fatally slit open Rindt&#x27;s throat. Later investigations found that the accident was initiated by a failure of the car&#x27;s right front inboard brake shaft, but that Rindt&#x27;s death was caused by poorly installed crash barriers.
Chapman rejected the assertion that the broken brake shaft had caused the accident, arguing that the shaft broke when the wheel hit the crash barrier.

Rindt was pronounced dead on the way to hospital in Milan and Lotus withdrew all cars from the race, including the Lotus 72 entered by Rob Walker. The Grand Prix went ahead and Clay Regazzoni took his maiden victory, but celebrations were muted. There was a lengthy investigation into Rindt&#x27;s death in Italy, leading to a trial against Colin Chapman; he was cleared of all charges in 1976. The destroyed Lotus 72 remained in Italy after the trial, going to a scrapyard near Monza. In 1985, a real estate agent found the wreckage and bought it from the authorities, later trading it in 1993 for a Lola Formula 3 car. Since then, the car has rested in a garage near Milan.
Rindt was buried at the central cemetery (Zentralfriedhof) in Graz on 11 September 1970. At his funeral, Joakim Bonnier gave the eulogy, saying:
At the time he died Rindt had won five of that year&#x27;s ten Grands Prix, which meant that he had a substantial lead in the Drivers&#x27; Championship. After winning the next race in Canada, Jacky Ickx moved within 17 points of Rindt in the Championship, giving him a chance to win the title if he won the two remaining races. At the , a race won by Rindt&#x27;s replacement at Lotus, Emerson Fittipaldi, Ickx placed only fourth, making Rindt motor racing&#x27;s only posthumous world champion. The championship trophy was handed to his widow Nina by Jackie Stewart on 18 November 1970 in a ceremony near the Place de la Concorde in Paris.

Rindt was commemorated in many ways. The early season BARC 200 Formula Two race was renamed the &quot;Jochen Rindt Memorial Trophy&quot; for as long as the series existed. In 2000, on the 30th anniversary of his death, the city of Graz unveiled a bronze plaque in remembrance of Rindt, with wife Nina and daughter Natasha present. The penultimate corner at the Red Bull Ring in Austria is named after Rindt.

The Historic Sports Car Club in the United Kingdom hosts a historic Formula 2 championship, whose pre-1972 category is called the &quot;Class A Jochen Rindt Trophy&quot;.

==Personal life==
In March 1967, Rindt married Nina Lincoln, a Finnish model and daughter of racing driver Curt Lincoln, whom he had raced in the early part of his career. After becoming engaged, Lincoln had originally broken up with Rindt and sent the engagement ring back. Rindt then put it back into the box with a note telling her to keep it until she changed her mind, which she did upon receiving the package, later explaining: &quot;I like men who know what they want.&quot; The couple moved to Switzerland, near Begnins, where they built a house together. The Rindts had one daughter, Natasha, who was two years old at the time of her father&#x27;s death. Nina Rindt married twice more after Rindt&#x27;s death, first Philip Martyn, with whom she had another daughter, and then Alexander Hood, 4th Viscount Bridport, making her Nina Hood, Lady Bridport. The couple had a son, Anthony. Their daughter Natasha later worked with Bernie Ecclestone for several years after he had taken over the commercial rights of Formula One.

Rindt had met Bernie Ecclestone during his time at Cooper and the two became friends. Noticing his commercial talent, Rindt allowed Ecclestone to manage his professional contracts, without ever officially employing him as a manager. Ecclestone said of the relationship: &quot;I was never his manager, we were good friends. I helped him with any help he ever needed.&quot; After Rindt&#x27;s accident, it was Ecclestone who carried his bloody helmet back to the pit lane.

In Formula One, Rindt had several friendly relationships with other drivers, most notably Jackie Stewart. They met at a Formula Two event in 1964 and soon became friends, often going on holiday together and living near each other in Switzerland. Until his death, they were sometimes accompanied by Jim Clark. Rindt became involved in Stewart&#x27;s fight for increased safety in Formula One, being one of the leading figures of the GPDA. For his role in the safety campaign, Rindt was criticised by fellow drivers and the press alike; reporters derogatively called Stewart, Rindt and Joakim Bonnier the &quot;Geneva connection&quot;, due to their residence in Switzerland. Stewart said that it took Rindt some time to understand the graveness of the situation but after that, he was a &quot;good ally&quot;. After Rindt&#x27;s death, his wife Nina stayed close with the Stewarts and can be seen visiting them at the 1971 Monaco Grand Prix in the Roman Polanski-produced film &quot;Weekend of a Champion&quot;.

Privately, Rindt was known to family and friends as an often reckless driver when on public roads. During the early years of his career, he took his Jaguar E-Type out in the streets of Vienna, where he lived, and drifted through the streets. He sparked public criticism in 1968 when he flipped over a Mini Cooper during a demonstration run at an autocross event in Großhöflein, while his pregnant wife was on board.

Rindt&#x27;s success popularised motorsport in Austria. Helmut Zwickl called him &quot;the driving instructor of the nation&quot;. In 1965, Rindt put together the first exhibition of racing cars in Austria, the &quot;Jochen-Rindt-Show&quot; in Vienna. It was an immediate success, with 30,000 visitors on the first weekend alone. Using his connections, he brought in his friend Joakim Bonnier and former Mercedes Grand Prix manager Alfred Neubauer as opening speakers, with other drivers such as Jackie Stewart attending. The show soon became an annual event and later moved to the German city of Essen in 1970, shortly after Rindt&#x27;s death, and remains there as the Essen Motor Show. Rindt, with the help of Ecclestone, was able to successfully promote himself, including lucrative sponsorship and advertising contracts. Following his ascent in racing, two race tracks were built in Austria, the Österreichring (now Red Bull Ring), for which Rindt worked as a consultant, and the Salzburgring. Rindt&#x27;s popularity was further increased through the TV show &quot;Motorama&quot;, which he hosted. The monthly programme included tips for driving on public roads, reports from Grands Prix and interviews of fellow drivers by Rindt.

<text>The year 585 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. In the Roman Empire, it was known as year 169 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;. The denomination 585 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

<text>The Nearctic realm is one of the eight biogeographic realms constituting the Earth&#x27;s land surface.

The Nearctic realm covers most of North America, including Greenland, Central Florida, and the highlands of Mexico. The parts of North America that are not in the Nearctic realm include most of coastal Mexico, southern Mexico, southern Florida, coastal central Florida, Central America, and the Caribbean islands. Together with South America, these regions are part of the Neotropical realm.

==Major ecological regions==
The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) divides the Nearctic into four bioregions, defined as &quot;geographic clusters of ecoregions that may span several habitat types, but have strong biogeographic affinities, particularly at taxonomic levels higher than the species level (genus, family).&quot;

===Canadian Shield===
The Canadian Shield bioregion extends across the northern portion of the continent, from the Aleutian Islands to Newfoundland. It includes the Nearctic&#x27;s arctic tundra and boreal forest ecoregions.

In terms of floristic provinces, it is represented by part of the Canadian Province of the Circumboreal Region.

===Eastern North America===

The Eastern North America bioregion includes the temperate broadleaf and mixed forests of the Eastern United States and southeastern Canada, the Great Plains temperate grasslands of the central United States and south-central Canada, the temperate coniferous forests of the southeastern United States, including central Florida. In terms of floristic provinces, it is represented by the North American Atlantic Region and part of the Canadian Province of the Circumboreal Region.

===Western North America===
The Western North America bioregion includes the temperate coniferous forests of the coastal and mountain regions of southern Alaska, western Canada, and the western United States from the Pacific Coast and Northern California to the Rocky Mountains (known as the Cascadian bioregion), as well as the cold-winter intermountain deserts and xeric shrublands and temperate grasslands and shrublands of the Western United States.

In terms of floristic provinces, it is represented by the Rocky Mountain region.

===Northern Mexico===
The Northern Mexico bioregion includes the mild-winter to cold-winter deserts and xeric shrublands, warm temperate and subtropical pine and pine-oak forests, and Mediterranean climate ecoregions of the Mexican Plateau, Baja California peninsula, and the southwestern United States, bordered to the south by the Neotropical Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. This region also includes the only subtropical dry broadleaf forest in the Nearctic realm, the Sonoran–Sinaloan transition subtropical dry forest.

In terms of floristic provinces, it is represented by the Madrean Region.

==History==
Although North America and South America are presently joined by the Isthmus of Panama, these continents were separated for about 180 million years, and evolved very different plant and animal lineages. When the ancient supercontinent of Pangaea split into two about 180 million years ago, North America remained joined to Eurasia as part of the supercontinent of Laurasia, while South America was part of the supercontinent of Gondwana. North America later split from Eurasia. North America has been joined by land bridges to both Asia and South America since then, which allowed an exchange of plant and animal species between the continents, the Great American Interchange.

A former land bridge across the Bering Strait between Asia and North America allowed many plants and animals to move between these continents, and the Nearctic realm shares many plants and animals with the Palearctic. The two realms are sometimes included in a single Holarctic realm.

Many large animals, or megafauna, including horses, camels, tapirs, mammoths, mastodons, ground sloths, sabre-tooth cats (&quot;Smilodon&quot;), short-faced bears and the American cheetah, became extinct in North America at the end of the Pleistocene epoch (ice ages) in what is called the Quaternary extinction event.

==Flora and fauna==

===Flora and fauna that originated in the Nearctic===
Mammals originally unique to the Nearctic include:
* Order Primates – the first primate/proto-primate, &quot;Purgatorius&quot;, originated in the Early Paleocene of the Nearctic.
* Family Canidae – dogs, wolves, foxes, and coyotes.
* Family Camelidae – camels and their South American relatives including the llama. Now extinct in the Nearctic
* Family Equidae – horses, donkeys and their relatives. Now only found in the Nearctic as feral horses.
* Family Tapiridae – tapirs now extinct in the Nearctic.
* Family Antilocapridae – last survivor of which is the pronghorn.
* Subfamily Tremarctinae (short-faced bears) – including the giant short-faced bear (&quot;Arctodus simus&quot;). The only surviving member of the group is the spectacled bear (&quot;Tremarctos ornatus&quot;) of South America. 

===Flora and fauna endemic to the Nearctic===
One bird family, the wrentits (Timaliinae), is endemic to the Nearctic region. Two mammal families are endemic to the Nearctic, the pronghorns (Antilocapridae) and the mountain beaver (Aplodontiidae). The Holarctic has four endemic families: divers (Gaviidae), grouse (Tetraoninae), auks (Alcidae), and the waxwings (Bombycillidae). The scarab beetle families Pleocomidae and Diphyllostomatidae (Coleoptera) are also endemic to the Nearctic. The fly species &quot;Cynomya cadaverina&quot; is also found in high numbers in this area.

Plant families endemic or nearly endemic to the Nearctic include the Crossosomataceae, Simmondsiaceae, and Limnanthaceae.

<text>The Neotropical realm is one of the eight biogeographic realms constituting Earth&#x27;s land surface. Physically, it includes the tropical terrestrial ecoregions of the Americas and the entire South American temperate zone.

==Definition==
In biogeography, the Neotropic or Neotropical realm is one of the eight terrestrial realms. This realm includes South America, Central America, the Caribbean Islands, and southern North America. In Mexico, the Yucatán Peninsula and southern lowlands, and most of the east and west coastlines, including the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula are Neotropical. In the United States southern Florida and coastal Central Florida are considered Neotropical.

The realm also includes temperate southern South America. In contrast, the Neotropical Floristic Kingdom excludes southernmost South America, which instead is placed in the Antarctic kingdom.

The Neotropic is delimited by similarities in fauna or flora. Its fauna and flora are distinct from the Nearctic realm (which includes most of North America) because of the long separation of the two continents. The formation of the Isthmus of Panama joined the two continents two to three million years ago, precipitating the Great American Interchange, an important biogeographical event.
The Neotropic includes more tropical rainforest (tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests) than any other realm, extending from southern Mexico through Central America and northern South America to southern Brazil, including the vast Amazon rainforest. These rainforest ecoregions are one of the most important reserves of biodiversity on Earth. These rainforests are also home to a diverse array of indigenous peoples, who to varying degrees persist in their autonomous and traditional cultures and subsistence within this environment. The number of these peoples who are as yet relatively untouched by external influences continues to decline significantly, however, along with the near-exponential expansion of urbanization, roads, pastoralism and forest industries which encroach on their customary lands and environment. Nevertheless, amidst these declining circumstances this vast &quot;reservoir&quot; of human diversity continues to survive, albeit much depleted. In South America alone, some 350–400 indigenous languages and dialects are still living (down from an estimated 1,500 at the time of first European contact), in about 37 distinct language families and a further number of unclassified and isolate languages. Many of these languages and their cultures are also endangered. Accordingly, conservation in the Neotropical realm is a hot political concern, and raises many arguments about development versus indigenous versus ecological rights and access to or ownership of natural resources.

== Major ecological regions ==
The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) subdivides the realm into &quot;bioregions&quot;, defined as &quot;geographic clusters of ecoregions that may span several habitat types, but have strong biogeographic affinities, particularly at taxonomic levels higher than the species level (genus, family).&quot;

Laurel forest and other cloud forest are subtropical and mild temperate forest, found in areas with high humidity and relatively stable and mild temperatures. Tropical rainforest, tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests are highlight in Southern North America, Amazonia, Caribbean, Central America, Northern Andes and Central Andes.

=== Amazonia ===
The Amazonia bioregion is mostly covered by tropical moist broadleaf forest, including the vast Amazon rainforest, which stretches from the Andes Mountains to the Atlantic Ocean, and the lowland forests of the Guianas. The bioregion also includes tropical savanna and tropical dry forest ecoregions.

=== Caribbean ===
===Central America===
=== Central Andes ===
The Central Andes lie between the gulfs of Guayaquil and Penas and thus encompass southern Ecuador, Chile, Peru, western Bolivia, and northwest and western Argentina.

===Eastern South America===
Eastern South America includes the Caatinga xeric shrublands of northeastern Brazil, the broad Cerrado grasslands and savannas of the Brazilian Plateau, and the Pantanal and Chaco grasslands. The diverse Atlantic forests of eastern Brazil are separated from the forests of Amazonia by the Caatinga and Cerrado, and are home to a distinct flora and fauna.

=== Northern Andes ===
North of the Gulf of Guayaquil in Ecuador and Colombia, a series of accreted oceanic terranes (discrete allochthonous fragments) have developed that constitute the Baudo, or Coastal, Mountains and the Cordillera Occidental.

===Orinoco===
The Orinoco is a region of humid forested broadleaf forest and wetland primarily comprising the drainage basin for the Orinoco River and other adjacent lowland forested areas. This region includes most of Venezuela and parts of Colombia, as well as Trinidad and Tobago.

=== Southern South America ===
The temperate forest ecoregions of southwestern South America, including the temperate rain forests of the Valdivian temperate rain forests and Magellanic subpolar forests ecoregions, and the Juan Fernández Islands and Desventuradas Islands, are a refuge for the ancient Antarctic flora, which includes trees like the southern beech (&quot;Nothofagus&quot;), podocarps, the alerce (&quot;Fitzroya cupressoides&quot;), and Araucaria pines like the monkey-puzzle tree (&quot;Araucaria araucana&quot;). These rainforests are endangered by extensive logging and their replacement by fast-growing non-native pines and eucalyptus.

== History ==
South America was originally part of the supercontinent of Gondwana, which included Africa, Australia, India, New Zealand, and Antarctica, and the Neotropic shares many plant and animal lineages with these other continents, including marsupial mammals and the Antarctic flora.

After the final breakup of the Gondwana about 110 million years ago, South America was separated from Africa and drifted north and west. 66 million years ago, the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event altered local flora and fauna.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1126/science.abf1969&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Much later, about two to three million years ago, South America was joined with North America by the formation of the Isthmus of Panama, which allowed a biotic exchange between the two continents, the Great American Interchange. South American species like the ancestors of the Virginia opossum (&quot;Didelphis virginiana&quot;) and the armadillo moved into North America, and North Americans like the ancestors of South America&#x27;s camelids, including the llama (&quot;Lama glama&quot;), moved south. The long-term effect of the exchange was the extinction of many South American species, mostly by outcompetition by northern species.

== Endemic animals and plants ==
===Animals===
The Neotropical realm has 31 endemic bird families, which is over twice the number of any other realm. They include tanagers, rheas, tinamous, curassows, antbirds, ovenbirds, toucans, and seriemas. Bird families originally unique to the Neotropics include hummingbirds (family Trochilidae) and wrens (family Troglodytidae).

Mammal groups originally unique to the Neotropics include:
* Order &quot;Xenarthra&quot;: anteaters, sloths, and armadillos
* New World monkeys
* Solenodontidae, the solenodons
* Caviomorpha rodents, including capybaras, guinea pigs, hutias, and chinchillas
* American opossums (order &quot;Didelphimorphia&quot;) and shrew opossums (order &quot;Paucituberculata&quot;)

The Neotropical realm has 63 endemic fish families and subfamilies, which is more than any other realm. Neotropical fishes include more than 5,700 species, and represent at least 66 distinct lineages in continental freshwaters (Albert and Reis, 2011). The well-known red-bellied piranha is endemic to the Neotropic realm, occupying a larger geographic area than any other piranha species. Some fish groups originally unique to the Neotropics include:
* Order Gymnotiformes: Neotropical electric fishes
* Family Characidae: tetras and allies
* Family Loricariidae: armoured catfishes
* Subfamily Cichlinae: Neotropical cichlids
* Subfamily Poeciliinae: guppies and relatives

Examples of other animal groups that are entirely or mainly restricted to the Neotropical region include:

According to Simberloff. as of 1984 there were a total of 92,128 species of flowering plants (Angiosperms) in the Neotropics.
Plant families endemic and partly subendemic to the realm are, according to Takhtajan (1978), Hymenophyllopsidaceae, Marcgraviaceae, Caryocaraceae, Pellicieraceae, Quiinaceae, Peridiscaceae, Bixaceae, Cochlospermaceae, Tovariaceae, Lissocarpaceae (&quot;Lissocarpa&quot;), Brunelliaceae, Dulongiaceae, Columelliaceae, Julianiaceae, Picrodendraceae, Goupiaceae, Desfontainiaceae, Plocospermataceae, Tropaeolaceae, Dialypetalanthaceae (&quot;Dialypetalanthus&quot;), Nolanaceae (&quot;Nolana&quot;), Calyceraceae, Heliconiaceae, Cannaceae, Thurniaceae and Cyclanthaceae.

Plant families that originated in the Neotropic include Bromeliaceae, Cannaceae and Heliconiaceae.

<text>Rodolfo Pietro Filiberto Raffaello Guglielmi di Valentina d&#x27;Antonguella (May 6, 1895 – August 23, 1926), known professionally as Rudolph Valentino and nicknamed The Latin Lover, was an Italian actor who starred in several well-known silent films including &quot;The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse&quot;, &quot;The Sheik&quot;, &quot;Blood and Sand&quot;, &quot;The Eagle&quot;, 
and &quot;The Son of the Sheik&quot;.

Valentino was a sex symbol of the 1920s, known in Hollywood as the &quot;Latin Lover&quot; (a title invented for him by Hollywood moguls), the &quot;Great Lover&quot;, or simply Valentino. His early death at the age of 31 caused mass hysteria among his fans, further cementing his place in early cinematic history as a cultural film icon.

==Early life==
===Childhood and emigration===

Valentino was born in Castellaneta, Apulia, Italy and named Rodolfo Pietro Filiberto Raffaello Guglielmi di Valentina d&#x27;Antonguella. His father, Giovanni Antonio Giuseppe Fedele Guglielmi di Valentina d&#x27;Antonguella, was an Italian from Martina Franca, Apulia; he was a captain of cavalry in the Italian Army, later a veterinarian, who died of malaria when Valentino was 11. His mother, Marie Berthe Gabrielle Barbin (1856–1918), was French with Torinese ancestry (the original family name was Barbini, gallicized to Barbin later on), born in Lure in the Franche-Comté region. She was lady-in-waiting to a local marquess. Valentino had an older brother, Alberto (1892–1981), a younger sister, Maria, and an older sister, Beatrice, who had died in infancy.

As a child, Valentino was indulged because of his exceptional looks and his playful personality. His mother coddled him, while his father disapproved of him. He did poorly in school and was eventually enrolled in agricultural school in Genoa, where he earned a certificate.

After living in Paris in 1912, he soon returned to Italy. Unable to secure employment, he departed for the United States in 1913. He was processed at Ellis Island at age 18 on December 23, 1913.

Valentino never applied for United States citizenship, and retained his Italian citizenship.

===New York===
Arriving in New York City, he supported himself with odd jobs such as busing tables in restaurants and gardening. Valentino once worked as a bus boy at Murray&#x27;s on 42nd Street and was well liked, but didn&#x27;t do a good job and was fired. While he was living on the streets, Valentino would occasionally come back to Murray&#x27;s for lunch and the staff would slip him some food. Around 1914, restaurateur Joe Pani who owned Castles-by-the-Sea, the Colony, and the Woodmansten Inn was the first to hire Rudolph to dance the tango with Joan Sawyer for $50 per week. Eventually, he found work as a taxi dancer at Maxim&#x27;s Restaurant-Cabaret. Among the other dancers at Maxim&#x27;s were several displaced members of European nobility, for whom a premium demand existed.

Valentino eventually befriended Chilean heiress Blanca de Saulles, who was unhappily married to businessman John de Saulles, with whom she had a son. Whether Blanca and Valentino actually had a romantic relationship is unknown, but when the de Saulles divorced, Valentino took the stand to support Blanca de Saulles&#x27;s claims of infidelity on her husband&#x27;s part. Following the divorce, John de Saulles reportedly used his political connections to have Valentino arrested, along with a Mrs. Thyme, a known madam, on some unspecified vice charges. The evidence was flimsy at best, and after a few days in jail, Valentino&#x27;s bail was lowered from $10,000 to $1,500.

Shortly after the trial, Blanca de Saulles fatally shot her ex-husband during a custody dispute over their son. Following his own well-publicized trial and the subsequent scandal over the murder, Valentino could not find employment. Fearful of being called in as a witness in another sensational trial, Valentino left town and joined a traveling musical that led him to the West Coast.

==Film career==
===Before fame===

In 1917, Valentino joined an operetta company that traveled to Utah, where it disbanded. He then joined an Al Jolson production of &quot;Robinson Crusoe, Jr.&quot;, which was travelling to Los Angeles. By fall, he was in San Francisco with a bit part in a theatrical production of &quot;Nobody Home&quot;. While in town, Valentino met actor Norman Kerry, who convinced him to try a career in cinema, which was still in the silent film era.

Valentino and Kerry moved back to Los Angeles and became roommates at the Alexandria Hotel. He continued dancing, teaching dance, and building up a following that included older female clientele who would let him borrow their luxury cars. At one point after the United States entered World War I, both Kerry and Valentino tried to get into the Canadian Air Force to fly and fight in France.

With his dancing success, Valentino found a room of his own on Sunset Boulevard and began actively seeking screen roles. His first part was as an extra in the film &quot;Alimony&quot;, moving on to small parts in several films. Despite his best efforts, he was typically cast as a &quot;heavy&quot; (villain) or gangster. At the time, the archetypal major male star was Wallace Reid, with a fair complexion, light eyes, and an All-American look, with Valentino the opposite; he eventually supplanted Sessue Hayakawa as Hollywood&#x27;s most popular &quot;exotic&quot; male lead.

By 1919, he had carved out a career in bit parts. It was a bit part as a &quot;cabaret parasite&quot; in the drama &quot;Eyes of Youth&quot;, starring Clara Kimball Young, that caught the attention of screenwriter June Mathis, who thought he would be perfect for her next movie. Young would later say it was she and Lewis J. Selznick who discovered him, and that they were disappointed when Valentino accepted a lucrative offer at Metro.

He appeared as second lead in &quot;The Delicious Little Devil&quot; (1919) with star Mae Murray. In 1919, Valentino impulsively married actress Jean Acker. Their marriage was purportedly never consummated.

===Acting===
Displeased with playing &quot;heavies,&quot; Valentino briefly entertained the idea of returning to New York permanently. He returned for a visit in 1917, staying with friends in Greenwich Village, eventually settling in Bayside, Queens. There he met Paul Ivano, who would greatly help his career.

While traveling to Palm Springs, California, to film &quot;Stolen Moments&quot;, Valentino read the novel &quot;The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse&quot; by Vicente Blasco Ibáñez. Seeking out a trade paper, he discovered that Metro had bought the film rights to the story. In New York, he sought out Metro&#x27;s office, only to discover that June Mathis had been trying to find him. She cast him in the role of Julio Desnoyers. For the director, Mathis had chosen Rex Ingram, with whom Valentino did not get along, leading Mathis to play the role of peacekeeper between the two.

&quot;The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse&quot; was released in 1921 and became a commercial and critical success. It was one of the first films to make $1,000,000 at the box office, the sixth-highest grossing silent film ever.

Metro Pictures seemed unwilling to acknowledge that it had made a star. Most likely due to Rex Ingram&#x27;s lack of faith in Valentino, the studio refused to give him a raise beyond the $350 a week he had made for &quot;Four Horsemen&quot;. For his follow-up film, they forced him into a bit part in a B-film called &quot;Uncharted Seas&quot;. On this film, Valentino met his second wife, Natacha Rambova. That same year, Valentino&#x27;s legal wife, Jean Acker, successfully sued for divorce.

Rambova, Mathis, Ivano, and Valentino began work on the Alla Nazimova film &quot;Camille&quot;. Valentino was cast in the role of Armand, Nazimova&#x27;s love interest. The film, mostly under the control of Rambova and Nazimova, was considered too &quot;avant garde&quot; by critics and the public.

Valentino&#x27;s final film for Metro was the Mathis-penned &quot;The Conquering Power&quot;. The film received critical acclaim and did well at the box office. After the film&#x27;s release, Valentino made a trip to New York, where he met with several French producers. Yearning for Europe, better pay, and more respect, Valentino returned and promptly quit Metro.

===&quot;The Sheik&quot;===

After quitting Metro, Valentino took up with Famous Players–Lasky, forerunner of the present-day Paramount Pictures, a studio known for films that were more commercially focused. Mathis soon joined him, angering both Ivano and Rambova.

Jesse L. Lasky intended to capitalize on the star power of Valentino, and cast him in a role that solidified his reputation as the &quot;Latin lover&quot;. In &quot;The Sheik&quot; (1921), Valentino played the starring role of Sheik Ahmed Ben Hassan. The film was a major success and defined not only his career but his image and legacy. Valentino tried to distance the character from a stereotypical portrayal of an Arab man. Asked if Lady Diana (his love interest) would have fallen for a &quot;savage&quot; in real life, Valentino replied, &quot;People are not savages because they have dark skins. The Arabian civilization is one of the oldest in the world ... the Arabs are dignified and keen-brained.&quot;

Famous Players produced four more feature-length films over the next 15 months. His leading role in &quot;Moran of the Lady Letty&quot; was of a typical Douglas Fairbanks nature; however, to capitalize on Valentino&#x27;s bankability, his character was given a Spanish name and ancestry. The film received mixed reviews, but was still a hit with audiences.

In November 1921, Valentino starred alongside Gloria Swanson in &quot;Beyond the Rocks&quot;. The film contained lavish sets and extravagant costumes, though &quot;Photoplay&quot; magazine said the film was &quot;a little unreal and hectic.&quot; Released in 1922, the film was a critical disappointment. Years after its release, &quot;Beyond the Rocks&quot; was thought to be lost, save for a one-minute portion. But in 2002, the film was discovered by the Netherlands Film Museum. The restored version was released on DVD in 2006.

In February, 1922 &quot;Life&quot; magazine reported that, according to the Famous Players press office, Valentino would henceforth be known as &quot;Rodolph&quot; rather than &quot;Rudolph.&quot;

In 1922, Valentino began work on another Mathis-penned film, &quot;Blood and Sand&quot;. He played the lead—bullfighter Juan Gallardo—and co-starred with Lila Lee and Nita Naldi. Initially believing the film would be shot in Spain, Valentino was upset to learn that the studio planned on shooting on a Hollywood back lot. He was further irritated by changes in production, including a director of whom he did not approve.

After finishing the film, Valentino married Rambova, which led to a bigamy trial, as he had been divorced from his first wife, Jean Acker, for less than a full year, as required by California law at the time. The trial was a sensation and the pair was forced to have their marriage annulled and to be separated for a year. Despite the trial, the film was still a success, with critics calling it a masterpiece on par with &quot;Broken Blossoms&quot; and &quot;Four Horsemen&quot;. &quot;Blood and Sand&quot; became one of the four top-grossing movies of 1922, breaking attendance records, and grossing $37,400 at the Rivoli Theatre alone. Valentino considered this one of his best films.

During his forced break from Rambova, the pair began working separately on the Mathis-penned &quot;The Young Rajah&quot;. Only fragments of this film, recovered in 2005, still remain. The film did not live up to expectations and underperformed at the box office. Valentino felt he had underperformed in the film, being upset over his separation with Rambova. Missing Rambova, Valentino returned to New York after the release of &quot;The Young Rajah&quot;. They were spotted and followed by reporters constantly. During this time, Valentino began to contemplate not returning to Famous Players, although Jesse Lasky already had his next picture, &quot;The Spanish Cavalier&quot;, in preparation. After speaking with Rambova and his lawyer Arthur Butler Graham, Valentino declared a &#x27;one-man strike&#x27; against Famous Players.

===Strike against Famous Players===
Valentino went on strike for financial reasons. At the time of his lawsuit against the studio, he was earning $1,250 per week, with an increase to $3,000 after three years. This was $7,000 per week less than Mary Pickford made in 1916. He was also upset over the broken promise of filming &quot;Blood and Sand&quot; in Spain, and the failure to shoot the next proposed film in either Spain or at least New York. Valentino had hoped while filming in Europe he could see his family, whom he had not seen in 10 years.

In September 1922, he refused to accept paychecks from Famous Players until the dispute was solved, although he owed them money he had spent to pay off Jean Acker. Angered, Famous Players, in turn, filed suit against him.

Valentino did not back down, and Famous Players realized how much they stood to lose. In trouble after shelving Roscoe Arbuckle pictures, the studio tried to settle by upping his salary from $1,250 to $7,000 a week. &quot;Variety&quot; erroneously announced the salary increase as a &quot;new contract&quot; before news of the lawsuit was released, and Valentino angrily rejected the offer.

Valentino went on to claim that artistic control was more of an issue than the money. He wrote an open letter to &quot;Photoplay&quot; magazine, titled &quot;Open Letter to the American Public&quot;, in which he argued his case, although the average American had trouble sympathizing, as most made $2,000 a year. Famous Players made their own public statements deeming him more trouble than he was worth (the divorce, bigamy trials, debts) and that he was temperamental, almost diva-like. They claimed to have done all they could and that they had made him a real star.

Other studios began courting him. Joseph Schenck was interested in casting his wife, Norma Talmadge, opposite Valentino in a version of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. June Mathis had moved to Goldwyn Pictures, where she was in charge of the &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; project, and interested in casting Valentino in the film. However, Famous Players exercised its option to extend his contract, preventing him from accepting any employment other than with the studio. By this point, Valentino was about $80,000 in debt. He filed an appeal, a portion of which was granted. Although he was still not allowed to work as an actor, he could accept other types of employment.

===Mineralava Dance Tour===
In late 1922, Valentino met George Ullman, who soon became his manager. Ullman had previously worked with Mineralava Beauty Clay Company, and convinced them that Valentino would be perfect as a spokesman with his legions of female fans.

The tour was a tremendous success, with Valentino and Rambova performing in 88 cities in the United States and Canada. In addition to the tour, Valentino also sponsored Mineralava beauty products and judged Mineralava-sponsored beauty contests. One beauty contest was filmed by a young David O. Selznick, who titled it &quot;Rudolph Valentino and his 88 Beauties.&quot;

===Return to films===

Valentino returned to the United States in reply to an offer from Ritz-Carlton Pictures (working through Famous Players), which included $7,500 a week, creative control, and filming in New York. Rambova negotiated a two-picture deal with Famous Players and four pictures for Ritz-Carlton. He accepted, turning down an offer to film an Italian production of &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; in Italy.

The first film under the new contract was &quot;Monsieur Beaucaire,&quot; wherein Valentino played the lead, the Duke of Chartres. The film did poorly and American audiences found it &quot;effeminate&quot;. The failure of the film, under Rambova&#x27;s control, is often seen as proof of her controlling nature and later caused her to be barred from Valentino sets. Valentino made one final movie for Famous Players. In 1924, he starred in &quot;A Sainted Devil,&quot; now one of his lost films. It had lavish costumes, but apparently a weak story. It opened to strong sales, but soon dropped off in attendance and ended up as another disappointment.

With his contract fulfilled, Valentino was released from Famous Players, but was still obligated to Ritz-Carlton for four films. His next film was a pet project titled &quot;The Hooded Falcon.&quot; The production was beset with problems from the start, beginning with the script written by June Mathis. The Valentinos were dissatisfied with Mathis&#x27;s version and requested that it be rewritten. Mathis took it as a great insult and did not speak to Valentino for almost two years. While Rambova worked designing costumes and rewriting the script for &quot;Falcon,&quot; Valentino was persuaded to film &quot;Cobra&quot; with Nita Naldi. He agreed only on condition that it not be released until after &quot;The Hooded Falcon&quot; debuted.

After filming &quot;Cobra,&quot; the cast of &quot;The Hooded Falcon&quot; sailed for France to be fitted for costumes. After three months, they returned to the United States, where Valentino&#x27;s new beard, which he had grown for the film, caused a sensation. &quot;I opened once a paper and I tell you what was in. It was Rudolph Valentino with a beard upon his chin. My heart stopped off from beating and I fainted dead away, and I never want to come to life until the judgement day,&quot; was soon printed in &quot;Photoplay.&quot; The cast and crew left for Hollywood to begin preparations for the film, but much of the budget was taken up during preproduction. Due to the Valentinos&#x27; lavish spending on costumes and sets, Ritz-Carlton terminated the deal with the couple, effectively ending Valentino&#x27;s contract with them.

===United Artists===

During the filming of &quot;Monsieur Beaucaire&quot;, both Charlie Chaplin and Douglas Fairbanks approached Valentino privately, due to his contract with Ritz-Carlton, about joining with United Artists. Valentino&#x27;s contract with United Artists provided $10,000 a week for only three pictures a year, plus a percentage of his films. The contract excluded Rambova from production of his films and the film set. Valentino&#x27;s acceptance of the terms caused a major rift in his marriage to Rambova. George Ullman, who had negotiated the contract with United Artists, offered Rambova $30,000 to finance a film of her own. It became her only film, titled &quot;What Price Beauty?&quot; and starred Myrna Loy.

Valentino chose his first UA project, &quot;The Eagle&quot;. With the marriage under strain, Valentino began shooting and Rambova announced that she needed a &quot;marital vacation&quot;. During the filming of &quot;The Eagle&quot;, rumors of an affair with co-star Vilma Bánky were reported and ultimately denied by both Bánky and Valentino. The film opened to positive reviews, but a moderate box office.

For the film&#x27;s release, Valentino travelled to London, staying there and in France, spending money with abandon while his divorce took place. Quite some time elapsed before he made another film, &quot;The Son of the Sheik,&quot; despite his hatred of the sheik image. The film began shooting in February 1926, with Valentino given his choice of director, and pairing him again with Vilma Bánky. The film used the authentic costumes he bought abroad and allowed him to play a dual role. Valentino was ill during production, but he needed the money to pay his many debts. The film opened on July 9, 1926, to great fanfare. During the premiere, Valentino was reconciled with Mathis; the two had not spoken in almost two years.

==Public image==

Dating back to the de Saulles trial in New York, during which his &quot;masculinity&quot; had been questioned in print, Valentino had been very sensitive about his public perception. 
With the Fairbanks-type being the supposed epitome of manhood, Valentino was sometimes portrayed as a threat to the &quot;All American&quot; man. One man, asked in a street interview in 1922 what he thought of Valentino, replied,
: &quot;Many other men desire to be another Douglas Fairbanks. But Valentino? I wonder ...&quot;
Women in the same interview found Valentino
: &quot;triumphantly seductive. Puts the love-making of the average husband or sweetheart into discard as tame, flat, and unimpassioned.&quot;

Some journalists were still calling his &quot;masculinity&quot; into question, going on at length about his pomaded hair, his dandyish clothing, his treatment of women, his views on women, and whether he was &quot;effeminate&quot;. 
Valentino hated these stories and was known to carry clippings of the newspaper articles around with him and criticize them.

In July 1926, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; reported that a vending machine dispensing pink talcum powder (face powder) had appeared in an upscale hotel&#x27;s men&#x27;s washroom. An editorial that followed used the story to protest the supposed feminization of American men, and blamed the talcum powder on Valentino and his films. The piece infuriated Valentino and he challenged the writer to his choice of a boxing or wrestling match, since dueling was illegal. Neither challenge was answered.

Shortly afterward, Valentino met with journalist H. L. Mencken for advice on how best to deal with the incident. Mencken advised Valentino to &quot;let the dreadful farce roll along to exhaustion&quot;, but Valentino insisted the editorial was &quot;infamous&quot;.

Mencken found Valentino to be likable and gentlemanly and wrote sympathetically of him in an article published in &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; a week after Valentino&#x27;s death:

After Valentino challenged the &quot;Tribune&#x27;s&quot; anonymous writer to a boxing match, the &quot;New York Evening Journal&quot; boxing writer, Frank O&#x27;Neill, volunteered to fight in his place. Valentino won the bout, which took place on the roof of New York&#x27;s Ambassador Hotel.
Heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey, who trained Valentino and other Hollywood notables of the era in boxing, said of him:
: &quot;He was the most virile and masculine of men. The women were like flies to a honeypot. He could never shake them off, anywhere he went. What a lovely, lucky guy.&quot;
Valentino&#x27;s sex symbol status and his untimely death were a biographical part in John Dos Passos&#x27; &quot;The Big Money&quot; in the U.S.A. trilogy. His title was the Adagio Dancer.

==Other ventures==

In 1923, Valentino published a book of poetry titled &quot;Day Dreams&quot;. He later serialized events in various magazines. With &quot;Liberty&quot; magazine, he wrote a series entitled, &quot;How You Can Keep Fit&quot; in 1923. &quot;My Life Story&quot; was serialized in &quot;Photoplay&quot; during his dance tour. The March issue was one of the best-selling ever for the magazine. He followed that with &quot;My Private Diary&quot;, serialized in &quot;Movie Weekly&quot; magazine. Most of the serials were later published as books after his death.

Valentino was fascinated with every part of movie-making. During production on a Mae Murray film, he spent time studying the director&#x27;s plans. He craved authenticity and wished to shoot on location, finally forming his own production company, Rudolph Valentino Productions, in 1925. Valentino, George Ullman, and Beatrice Ullman were the incorporators.

On May 14, 1923, while in New York City, Valentino made his only two vocal recordings for Brunswick Records; &quot;Kashmiri Song&quot; (&quot;The Sheik&quot;) and &quot;El Relicario&quot; (&quot;Blood and Sand&quot;). The recordings were not released until after Valentino&#x27;s death by the Celebrity Recording Company; Brunswick did not release them because Valentino&#x27;s English/Spanish pronunciation was subpar.

Valentino was one of the first in Hollywood to offer an award for artistic accomplishments in films; the Academy Awards later followed suit. In 1925, he gave out his only medal to John Barrymore for his performance in &quot;Beau Brummel&quot;. The award, named the Rudolph Valentino Medal, required the agreement of Valentino, two judges, and the votes of 75 critics. Everyone other than Valentino himself was eligible.

==Personal life==
Valentino once told gossip columnist Louella Parsons that:
: &quot;The women I love don&#x27;t love me. The others don&#x27;t matter.&quot;
He claimed that despite his success as a sex symbol, in his personal love life he never achieved happiness.
In 1919 – just before the rise of his career – Valentino impulsively married actress Jean Acker, who was involved with actresses Grace Darmond and Alla Nazimova. Acker became involved with Valentino in part to remove herself from the lesbian love triangle, quickly regretted the marriage, and locked Valentino out of their room on their wedding night. The couple separated soon after, and the marriage was never consummated. The couple remained legally married until 1921, when Acker sued Valentino for divorce, citing desertion. The divorce was granted, with Acker receiving alimony. She and Valentino eventually renewed their friendship, and remained friends until his death.

Valentino first met Winifred Shaughnessy, known by her stage name, Natacha Rambova—an American silent film costume and set designer, art director, and protégée of Nazimova—on the set of &quot;Uncharted Seas&quot; in 1921. The two worked together on the Nazimova production of &quot;Camille,&quot; by which time they were romantically involved. They married on May 13, 1922, in Mexicali, Mexico, which resulted in Valentino&#x27;s arrest for bigamy, since he had not been divorced for a full year, as required by California law at the time. Days passed and &quot;Famous Players–Lasky&quot; (his studio at the time) refused to post bail. Eventually, a few friends were able to post the cash bail. He was also investigated for a possible violation of the Mann Act.

Having to wait the year or face the possibility of being arrested again, Rambova and Valentino lived in separate apartments in New York City, each with their own roommates. On 14 March 1923, they legally remarried at the Lake County Court House in Crown Point, Indiana.

Many of Valentino&#x27;s friends disliked Rambova and found her controlling. During his relationship with her, he lost many friends and business associates, including June Mathis. Towards the end of their marriage, Rambova was banned from his sets by contract. Valentino and Rambova divorced in 1925. The end of the marriage was bitter, with Valentino bequeathing Rambova one dollar in his will.

From the time he died in 1926 until the 1960s, Valentino&#x27;s sexuality was not generally questioned in print. At least four books, including the notoriously libelous &quot;Hollywood Babylon&quot;, suggested that he may have been gay despite his marriage to Rambova. For some, the marriages to Acker and Rambova, as well as the relationship with Pola Negri, add to the suspicion that Valentino was gay and that these were &quot;lavender marriages&quot;.

Some claim that Valentino had a relationship with Ramón Novarro, despite Novarro stating they barely knew each other. &quot;Hollywood Babylon&quot; recounts a story that Valentino had given Novarro an art deco dildo as a gift, which was found stuffed in his throat at the time of his murder. It is believed that no such gift existed. There were also claims that he may have had relationships with both roommates Paul Ivano and Douglas Gerrad, as well as Norman Kerry, and openly gay French theatre director and poet Jacques Hébertot. However, Ivano maintained that it was untrue and both he and Valentino were heterosexual. Biographers Emily Leider and Allan Ellenberger generally agree that he was most likely straight.

There was further supposed evidence that Valentino was gay; documents in the estate of the late author Samuel Steward indicated that Valentino and Steward were sexual partners. However, evidence found in Steward&#x27;s claim was subsequently found to be false, as Valentino was in New York on the date Steward claimed a sexual encounter occurred in Ohio.

Shortly before his death, Valentino was dating &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; showgirl Marion Wilson Benda while he was also involved in a relationship with actress Pola Negri. Upon his death, Negri made a scene at his funeral, claiming they had been engaged, in spite of the fact that Valentino himself had never mentioned this engagement to anyone.

==Death==
On August 15, 1926, Valentino collapsed at the Hotel Ambassador on Park Avenue in Manhattan. He was hospitalized at the New York Polyclinic Hospital. Following an examination, he was diagnosed with appendicitis and gastric ulcers, and surgery was performed immediately. (His condition would eventually be referred to as &quot;Valentino&#x27;s syndrome&quot;—perforated ulcers mimicking appendicitis.) After surgery, Valentino developed peritonitis. On August 18, his doctors were optimistic about his prognosis. The media were told that unless Valentino&#x27;s condition deteriorated, no updates would be given. However, his condition worsened on August 21. He was stricken with a severe relapse of pleuritis, which developed rapidly in his left lung due to his weakened condition. The doctors realized that Valentino was going to die, but as was common at the time, chose to withhold this information. Valentino reportedly believed that he would recover. During the early hours of Monday, August 23, Valentino was briefly conscious and chatted with his doctors about his future, but soon lapsed into a coma. He died a few hours later at the age of 31. Following Valentino&#x27;s death, doctors who treated him later confirmed that the actor had contracted sepsis, an overwhelming infection.

===Funeral===
An estimated 100,000 people lined the streets of Manhattan to pay their respects at his funeral, handled by the Frank Campbell Funeral Home. Suicides of despondent fans were reported. Windows were smashed as fans tried to get in and an all-day riot erupted on August 24. Over 100 mounted officers and NYPD&#x27;s Police Reserve were used to restore order. A phalanx of officers lined the streets for the remainder of the viewing. Polish actress Pola Negri, claiming to be Valentino&#x27;s fiancée, collapsed in hysterics while standing over the coffin, and Campbell hired four actors to impersonate a Fascist Blackshirt honor guard, purportedly sent by Benito Mussolini. Media reports that the body on display in the main salon was not Valentino but a decoy were continually denied by Campbell.
Valentino&#x27;s funeral mass in Manhattan was held on Monday, August 30 at Saint Malachy&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church, often called &quot;The Actor&#x27;s Chapel,&quot; as it is located on West 49th Street in the Broadway theater district, and has a long association with show-business figures.

After Valentino&#x27;s remains were taken by train from New York to California, a second funeral was held on the West Coast, at the Catholic Church of the Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills. Valentino had no final burial arrangements and his friend June Mathis arranged a temporary solution when she offered a crypt that she had purchased for the husband whom she had since divorced. Coincidentally, she died the following year and was interred in the adjoining crypt that she had purchased for herself; Valentino was never moved to a new location and he remained in the crypt next to Mathis. The two are still interred side by side at Hollywood Forever Cemetery (originally Hollywood Memorial Park Cemetery) in Hollywood, California.

===Estate===
Valentino left his estate to his brother, sister, and Rambova&#x27;s aunt Teresa Werner, who was left the share originally bequeathed to Rambova. His Beverly Hills mansion, Falcon Lair, was later owned by heiress Doris Duke, who died there in 1993. The home was later sold and underwent major renovations. The main building of the estate was razed in 2006, and the property was then put back on the market.

==Legacy==
After Valentino&#x27;s death, many of his films were reissued to help pay his estate expenses. Many were reissued well into the 1930s, long after the demise of silent film. Several books were written, including one by Rambova. A photo montage print showed Valentino arriving in Heaven and being greeted by Enrico Caruso.

Over the years, a &quot;woman in black&quot; carrying a red rose has come to mourn at Valentino&#x27;s crypt, usually on the anniversary of his death. Several myths surround the woman, though it seems the first woman in black was actually a publicity stunt cooked up by press agent Russel Birdwell in 1928. A woman named Ditra Flame claimed to be the original &quot;woman in black&quot;. Several copycats have followed over the years. Although originally a PR stunt, it has become a tradition. The current &quot;woman in black&quot; is motion picture historian Karie Bible. This myth of &quot;woman in black&quot; was also a source of inspiration for the song &quot;Long Black Veil.&quot;

Valentino&#x27;s hometown of Castellaneta, Italy, has created several services in his honor. The Museo Rodolfo Valentino was opened in his childhood home and a memorial designed by architect Nicola Cantore with a blue ceramic statue of Valentino by Luigi Gheno was unveiled in 1961. 
The dedication of the memorial is the subject of a vignette in the documentary &quot;Mondo Cane&quot;. Fondazione Rodolfo Valentino was created to promote his life and his work. In 2009, a film school was also opened in his hometown, Centro Studi Cine Club Rodolfo Valentino Castellaneta. At the 1995 centennial of his birth, several events were held in his honor. From 1972 to 2006, an Italian acting award—The Rudolph Valentino Award—was handed out every year. Several actors from all over the world received this award, including Leonardo DiCaprio and Elizabeth Taylor.

In 1994, an opera by Dominick Argento (libretto by Charles Nolte) entitled &quot;The Dream of Valentino&quot; was premiered by the Washington National Opera in the District of Columbia . Reviews were not enthusiastic. The opera was revived by the Minnesota Opera in 2014, with similar reviews.

In Italy in 2006, a one-off film festival was planned to celebrate the opening of the Museo Rodolfo Valentino. In May 2010, the American Society held the Rudolph Valentino Film Festival in Los Angeles, California.

Valentino&#x27;s syndrome, the type of medically emergent abdominal pain that caused his death, is named after him. Hollywood High School&#x27;s mascot, the Sheiks, is a tribute to a Valentino character.

Italian fashion designer Valentino is named after him.

===Films===
The life of Rudolph Valentino has been filmed several times for television and the big screen.

In 1923, he was referenced in the film &quot;Mud and Sand&quot;, a parody of &quot;Blood and Sand&quot;, which starred Stan Laurel as a bullfighter named Rhubarb Vaseline.

A 1951 feature film about Valentino&#x27;s life, called &quot;Valentino&quot;, starred Anthony Dexter in the title role.

In the 1971 film &quot;They Might Be Giants&quot;, Oliver Clark makes a cameo, as a nonverbal psychiatric patient nicknamed Mr. Small, who is under the delusion that he is Valentino and refuses to speak until recognized. His delusion is quickly deduced by the main character, who is himself under the delusion that he is Sherlock Holmes.

In 1975, American Broadcasting Company produced the television movie &quot;The Legend of Valentino&quot;, with Franco Nero as Valentino.

In 1977, Ken Russell&#x27;s film &quot;Valentino&quot;, Rudolf Nureyev portrays Valentino.

In 2013, Valentino is played by actor/director Alex Monty Canawati in the motion picture &quot;Return to Babylon&quot;.

In 2015, Valentino is a supporting character in the fifth season of the horror anthology series &quot;American Horror Story&quot;. In the series, Valentino, who is played by Finn Wittrock, fakes his own death in 1926 after being transformed into a vampire. Valentino then turns his fictional lover, Elizabeth Johnson (Lady Gaga), into a vampire, as well. Elizabeth goes on to become the Countess, the central antagonist of the show&#x27;s fifth season, while Valentino is eventually killed by Donovan (Matt Bomer), one of Elizabeth&#x27;s many lovers, in a jealous rage.

In 2018, Vladislav Alex Kozlov had been set to play Valentino and direct an upcoming indie biopic &quot;Silent Life&quot;, with Franco Nero playing Valentino&#x27;s spirit. Written by Vladislav Alex Kozlov, Ksenia Jarova, and Natalia Dar, the film stars Terry Moore, Isabella Rossellini, Franco Nero, Sherilyn Fenn, Jeff DuJardin, Paul Rodriguez, and Monte Markham. Dreamer Pictures, and Vladislav Alex Kozlov produces, and Joy Boileau, Tyler Cassity, and Yogu Kanthiah, executive produce. On 19 February 2023, &quot;Silent Life: The Story of the Lady In Black&quot; U.S. premiered at the Sedona International Film Festival.&lt;ref name=&quot;deadline/1235249623&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
