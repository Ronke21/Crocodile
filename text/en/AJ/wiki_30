<text>Enrico Berlinguer (; 25 May 1922 – 11 June 1984) was an Italian politician and statesman. Considered the most popular leader of the Italian Communist Party (PCI), he led the PCI as the national secretary from 1972 until his death during a tense period in Italy&#x27;s history, which was marked by the Years of Lead and social conflicts, such as the Hot Autumn of 1969–1970. Berlinguer was born into a middle-class family; his father was a socialist who became a deputy and later senator. After leading the party&#x27;s youth wing in his hometown, he led the PCI&#x27;s youth wing, the Italian Communist Youth Federation (FGCI), at the national level from 1949 to 1956. In 1968, he was elected to the country&#x27;s Chamber of Deputies, and he became the leader of the PCI in 1972; he remained a deputy until his death in 1984. Under his leadership, the number of votes for the PCI peaked. The PCI&#x27;s results in 1976 remain the highest for any Italian left-wing or centre-left party both in terms of votes and vote share, and the party&#x27;s results in 1984, just after his death, remain the best result for an Italian left-wing party in European elections, and were toppled, in terms of vote share in a lower-turnout election, in the 2014 European Parliament election in Italy.

During his leadership, Berlinguer distanced the party from the influence of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and pursued a moderate line, repositioning the party within Italian politics and advocating accommodation and national unity. This strategy came to be termed Eurocommunism, and he was seen as its main spokesperson. It came to be adopted by Western Europe&#x27;s other significant like-minded parties, such as the Communist Party of Spain and later the French Communist Party; its significance as a political force was cemented by a 1977 meeting in Madrid between Berlinguer, Georges Marchais, and Santiago Carrillo. Berlinguer described his alternative model of socialism, distinct from both the Soviet bloc and the capitalism practised by the Western bloc during the Cold War, as &quot;terza via&quot;. His usage of the term has no relation to the Third Way practised by subsequent prime ministers Romano Prodi and Matteo Renzi, but actually refers to a &quot;third way&quot; to Socialism after the emergence of the Social democratic parties of the late nineteenth century and the communist revolutions in Russia or China.

Under Berlinguer, the PCI reached the height of its success, winning significant victories in the country&#x27;s regional and local elections in 1975, and 34% of the vote in the 1976 Italian general election, its highest share of the vote and number of seats. With these gains, he negotiated the Historic Compromise with the DC, lending support to their government in exchange for consultation on policy decisions, as well as social reforms. He took a firm stand against terrorism after the kidnapping and murder of Aldo Moro, and used the PCI&#x27;s influence to steer Italian labour unions towards moderating wage demands to cope with the country&#x27;s severe inflation rate after the 1973 oil crisis. These stands were not reciprocated with sufficient concessions from Giulio Andreotti&#x27;s government, leading the PCI to leave the coalition in 1979. The combination of austerity advocacy, hard line against the Red Brigades, and attempts at an accommodation with the DC affected the PCI&#x27;s vote at the 1979 Italian general election and the compromise was ultimately ended in 1980. The PCI remained in national opposition for the rest of Berlinguer&#x27;s tenure, retaining a solid core of support at the 1983 Italian general election; its main strength from that point would remain at the regional and local level. Also a member of the European Parliament from 1979 to 1982, the PCI became the largest party for the first and only time in the 1984 European Parliament election in Italy, which was held a week after his premature death.

One of the most important figures of the First Italian Republic, Berlinguer had an austere and modest but charismatic personality, and despite the difficulties that confronted the PCI during the Historic Compromise, he remained a popular politician, respected for his principles, conviction, and bold stands. He characterised the PCI as an honest party in Italy&#x27;s corruption-ravaged politics, an image that preserved the party&#x27;s reputation during the &quot;Mani pulite&quot; corruption scandals. He was characterised by Patrick McCarthy as &quot;the last great communist leader in Western Europe&quot;, and remains identified with the causes of Eurocommunism, opposition to Soviet repression in Eastern Europe, and democratic change in Italy.

== Family and early political career ==

The son of Mario Berlinguer and Maria &quot;Mariuccia&quot; Loriga, Enrico Berlinguer was born in Sassari on 25 May 1922, five months before the March on Rome orchestrated by Benito Mussolini and Italian fascists, to a noble Sardinian family in a notable cultural context, with family ties and political contacts that would heavily influence his life and career. On 29 March 1777, the family had obtained from Vittorio Amedeo III, the then King of Sardinia, the concession to Giovanni and Angelo Ignazio of the noble titles of &quot;Cavaliere&quot; and &quot;Nobile&quot; with the honorific of &quot;Don&quot; and &quot;Donna&quot;; it was also registered in the &quot;Stamenti nobiliari della Sardegna&quot;, Sardinia&#x27;s Italian nobility register, and was linked by a dense network of relatives to other families of the Sardinian aristocracy and bourgeoisie.

Berlinguer&#x27;s father was a socialist and anti-fascist; as many of his ancestors, he belonged to the Italian Freemasonry and was Great Master (33rd Scottish Rite Mason) of the regular lodge of Sassari. His cousin, Luigi Berlinguer, followed this tradition of left-wing members of Freemasonry. Another cousin of his was Sergio Berlinguer, who was a diplomat. His brother, Giovanni Berlinguer, was a medician and politician who died in 2015. His surname is of Catalan language origin, a reminder of the period when Sardinia was part of the dominions of the Crown of Aragon. He was a second cousin of Francesco Cossiga, who was a leader of Christian Democracy (DC) and later became president of Italy, and both were relatives of Antonio Segni, another DC leader and president of Italy.

Giovanni Loriga and Cossiga&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Antonio Zanfarino, were half-brothers on their mother side; Loriga was Berlinguer&#x27;s maternal grandfather. His paternal grandfather, Enrico Berlinguer Sr., was a co-founder of the Sardinian newspaper &quot;La Nuova Sardegna&quot; and a personal friend of Giuseppe Garibaldi and Giuseppe Mazzini, whom he had helped in his attempts, through his parliamentary work, to improve the sad conditions on the island. Berlinguer&#x27;s grandmother, Giuseppina Satta Branca, had a brother, Pietro Satta Branca, who was an Italian Republican Party (PRI) member and progressive mayor of Sassari during an era marked by Giovanni Giolitti&#x27;s rule; Berlinguer Sr. also took part in Satta Branca&#x27;s administration. Pietro Sanna, one of Berlinguer&#x27;s childhood friends, recalled: &quot;The Berlinguers, we called them Piringhieri because for us ordinary people a difficult name like theirs was difficult to pronounce. Giovanni, very open and carefree, played boccette, carambola, and sometimes cards, Enrico instead preferred to read.&quot;

About his adolescence, Berlinguer recalled the feeling of rebellion that was in him. He was against everything: the state, religion, clichés, and social customs. Politically, he felt anarchist when in the library of one of his uncles, a humanitarian socialist, he found a book of Mikhail Bakunin. As a member of the bourgeoisie, he was attracted to the world of the workers and craftsmen, who were followers of Amadeo Bordiga and kept their ideals even under Fascist Italy. He said: &quot;They exerted a strong attraction on me ... there was, in their stories, a lot of suggestion.&quot; When meeting Palmiro Togliatti, leader of the Communist Party of Italy (PCd&#x27;I), Berlinguer revoked the importance of Sardians to the PCd&#x27;I, citing Antonio Gramsci, Velio Spano, and Togliatti, the latter having moved to the Sardianian island.

In 1937, Berlinguer had his first contacts with Sardinian anti-fascists and formally entered the renamed Italian Communist Party (PCI) in 1943, soon becoming the secretary of the Sassari section. The following year, a riot exploded in the town, and he was involved in the disorders and arrested but was discharged after three months of prison. Immediately after his detention ended, his father brought him to Salerno, the town in which the House of Savoy, Italy&#x27;s royal family, and the government had taken refuge after the armistice of Cassibile between Italy and the Allies of World War II. In Salerno, his father introduced him to Togliatti, the most important leader of the PCI. Togliatti sent Berlinguer back to Sardinia to prepare for his political career; he also met Benedetto Croce, and said that for a period he was a follower of his.
At the end of 1944, Berlinguer was appointed by Togliatti to the national secretariat of the Italian Communist Youth Federation (FGCI). As a secretary of the FGCI, Berlinguer at one point presented Maria Goretti as an example for activists. Berlinguer was soon sent to Milan, and he was appointed to the central committee as a member in 1945. In 1946, Togliatti became the national secretary (the highest political position) of the PCI and called Berlinguer to Rome, where his talents let him enter the national leadership two years later in 1948; at the age of 26, he was one of the youngest members to be admitted. In 1949, he was named national secretary of the FGCI, a post he held until 1956. In 1950, he became president of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, an international anti-fascist youth organisation.

In the post-war years, the PCI respected Joseph Stalin and the Soviet Union for their anti-fascist role in World War II and the Italian resistance movement, and thus avoided criticism; the PCI accepted the 1956 Soviet thesis that denounced Stalin&#x27;s crimes and at the same time opened up the different national roads to communism. In 1957, as a member of the central school of the PCI, he abolished the obligatory visit to the Soviet Union, including political training there, which had been necessary for admission to the highest positions in the PCI. At the party&#x27;s twelfth congress in 1969, Berlinguer reiterated the need to &quot;deepen the knowledge of the reality of the socialist countries ... through a historical, critical, objective judgement&quot;, which would capture both the positive and negative elements, and &quot;their interweaving and contradictions that derive from it&quot;. About the October Revolution and what ensued, he said that it remained &quot;the fundamental discriminant of the contemporary world&quot;, and that the PCI would fight for socialism &quot;not looking at an abstract model, nor at the Soviet model ... but along an original path ... that is profoundly new&quot;, which entailed full autonomy of elaboration and judgement. In this sense, Berlinguer concluded that &quot;our way of placing ourselves in the face of this reality of socialist countries is therefore, today, new at least in part, and different from the past.&quot;

== Secretary of the Italian Communist Party ==
Berlinguer&#x27;s career was carrying him towards the highest positions in the party. After having held many responsible posts, he was elected in the 1968 Italian general election for the first time a member of the country&#x27;s Chamber of Deputies in the electoral district of Rome. The following year, he was elected deputy national secretary of the party, the secretary being Luigi Longo. In this role, he took part in the 1969 International Meeting of Communist and Workers Parties in Moscow, where his delegation disagreed with the official political line and refused to support the final report. Berlinguer&#x27;s unexpected stance made waves, as he gave the strongest speech by a major Communist leader ever heard in Moscow. He refused to excommunicate the Chinese Communists and directly told Leonid Brezhnev that the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, which he termed &quot;the tragedy in Prague&quot;, had made clear the considerable differences within the international Communist movement on fundamental questions, such as national sovereignty, socialist democracy, and the freedom of culture. This dissent, which was termed &quot;the new course&quot;, was followed by further condemnations in the 1980s.

Already a prominent leader in the party, Berlinguer was elected to the position of national secretary in 1972, when Longo resigned on grounds of ill health. At the party&#x27;s thirteenth congress that elected him, Berlinguer said that he would be neither Togliatti nor Longo. In 1973, having been hospitalised after a car accident during a visit to the People&#x27;s Republic of Bulgaria, which is now widely considered an attempt on his life on orders from Moscow, Berlinguer wrote three famous articles (&quot;Reflections on Italy&quot;, &quot;After the Facts of Chile&quot;, and &quot;After the Coup [in Chile]&quot;) for the party&#x27;s intellectual weekly magazine &quot;Rinascita&quot;. In these, he presented the strategy of the Historic Compromise, a proposed coalition between the PCI and the DC to grant Italy a period of political stability, at a time of severe economic crisis, and in a context in which, after &quot;Piano Solo&quot; and &quot;Golpe Borghese&quot; had been revealed, some forces were allegedly manoeuvering for a coup d&#x27;état in Italy.

In &quot;Reflections of Italy&quot;, Berlinguer explicitly cited the &quot;historic compromise&quot; and wrote: &quot;The seriousness of the country&#x27;s problems, the ever looming threats of reactionary adventures, and the need to finally open up to the nation a sure path of economic development, social renewal, and democratic progress make it ever more urgent and mature that we reach what can be defined as the great new &#x27;historic compromise&#x27; between the forces that gather and represent the great majority of the Italian people.&quot; By this, Berlinguer meant that it was illusory to believe that, even if left-wing parties had managed to reach 51 per cent of the votes and parliamentary representation, this would have guaranteed the life of a government that was the expression of that 51 per cent as opposed to the oppositional front at 49 per cent. Within this context, over a left-wing alternative, he proposed a democratic alternative that would have resulted in a collaboration between communists, socialists, and Christian democrats. This policy was not popular among the party and its base. It was not well received by Longo, who became the party&#x27;s president in August 1972 and did not like the &quot;compromise&quot; phrasing. Among the working-class base, Berlinguer was asked in some meetings with workers whether there was no &quot;risk of yielding to the bosses&quot; or whether this policy did not &quot;weaken the spirit of the Communists&quot;.

=== International relations ===

In 1973, Berlinguer went to Belgrade, the capital of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, to meet with Yugoslav president Josip Broz Tito, with a view to further developing his relationships with the major Communist parties of Europe, Asia, and Africa. In 1976, Berlinguer confirmed the autonomous position of the PCI vis-à-vis the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). Before 5,000 Communist delegates in Moscow, he spoke of &quot;pluralistic system&quot;, which was translated by the interpreter as &quot;multiform&quot;, and referred to the PCI&#x27;s intentions to build &quot;a socialism that we believe necessary and possible only in Italy&quot;. In one of his speeches in Moscow, Igor Ponomariov, Leonid Brezhnev&#x27;s closest collaborator, left the room visibly annoyed. In September 1976, during the Festa dell&#x27;Unità in Turin, Mikhail Gorbachev, the then secretary of the Russian district of Stavropol, having learned about his speeches in Moscow, asked to meet Berlinguer. In November 1977, upon the celebration of the 60th anniversary of the October Revolution, Berlinguer held another speech in Moscow titled &quot;Democracy is a Universal Value&quot;.

When Berlinguer secured the PCI&#x27;s condemnation of any kind of interference, the rupture with the Soviets was effectively complete, although the party still for some years received money from Moscow. Since Italy was suffering the interference of NATO, the Soviets said it seemed that the only interference that the Italian Communists could not suffer was the Soviet one. In an interview held on 10 June 1976 with &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot;, Berlinguer declared that he felt &quot;safer under NATO&#x27;s umbrella&quot;. Berlinguer&#x27;s acceptance of NATO did not dent American suspicion of him; appearing on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; on 14 June 1976, he was named &quot;The Red Threat&quot;. In a 1975 speech to Italy&#x27;s Chamber of Deputies, Berlinguer had said that the Italian Communists had sympathy for the American people and wanted to cultivate a friendship with the United States but that the &quot;respect for alliances does not mean that Italy has to keep its head down&quot;. At the same time, he ruled out Italy leaving NATO on the grounds that unilateral exits of individual countries from the NATO or the Warsaw Pact would have disturbed the process of international détente.

=== Eurocommunism ===
In a 1975 speech for Dolores Ibárruri, Berlinguer stated: &quot;It is necessary that with audacity and intelligence we know how to free ourselves from any scholastic application of our doctrine understood as dogma, or from orientations that are no longer adequate to current experience and historical conditions, to walk towards new ways of advancing towards socialism.&quot; That same year also saw the joint statement of Berlinguer and Santiago Carrillo of the Spanish Communist Party, which said: &quot;The Italian and Spanish Communists solemnly declare that — in their conception of a democratic advance towards socialism in peace and freedom — what is expressed is not a tactical attitude but a strategic conviction.&quot; Berlinguer reiterated this feeling in a 1976 meeting in Moscow, where he said: &quot;We are fighting for a socialist society which is the highest point in the development of all democratic achievements and guarantees respect for all individual and collective freedoms, religious freedoms and freedom of culture, art and science. We think that in Italy we can and must ... build a socialist society with the contribution of political forces, organisations, different parties, and that the working class can and must affirm its historical function in a pluralistic and democratic system.&quot;

In 1977, at a meeting in Madrid between Berlinguer, Carrillo, and Georges Marchais of the French Communist Party, the fundamental lines of Eurocommunism were laid out. A few months later, Berlinguer was again in Moscow, where he gave another speech that was poorly received by his hosts and published by &quot;Pravda&quot;, the PCSU&#x27;s official newspaper, in a censored version. About democracy, Berlinguer said: &quot;The experience gained has led us to the conclusion that democracy today is not only the ground on which the class adversary is forced to retreat, but it is also the historically universal value on which to found an original socialist society.&quot; The years after Communists first joined the European Parliament in 1969 saw a process towards pro-Europeanism that culminated, for the 1976 Italian general election, in the candidacy within the PCI&#x27;s electoral list of Altiero Spinelli, the Italian father of European federalism and one of the founding fathers of the European Union. In the words of historian Antonio Varsori, the PCI interpreted the pro-European option as &quot;an opportunity to overcome the division of the old continent and for the birth of a socialist, neutralist, and tendentially pro-Third World Europe&quot;.

=== Historic Compromise ===

Moving step by step, Berlinguer was building a consensus in the PCI towards a rapprochement with other components of society. After the surprising opening of 1970 toward conservatives and the still discussed proposal of the Historic Compromise, he published a correspondence with Monsignor Luigi Bettazzi, the Bishop of Ivrea; it was an astonishing event since Pope Pius XII had excommunicated the communists soon after World War II and the possibility of any relationship between communists and Catholics seemed very unlikely. This act also served to counteract the allegation, commonly and popularly expressed, that the PCI was protecting leftist terrorists in the harshest years of terrorism in Italy. In this context, the PCI opened its doors to many Catholics and a debate started about the possibility of contact. Notably, Berlinguer&#x27;s Catholic family was not brought in out of its strictly respected privacy. In the 1975 Italian regional elections, the left-wing coalition led by the PCI added to Emilia-Romagna, Tuscany, and Umbria the regions of Piedmont, Liguria, Marche, and Lazio. As a party, the PCI confirmed itself in the 1975 Italian local elections, which were held on the same day on 15–16 June, where it won 33.4% of the votes compared to the 35.3% of the votes of the DC. In June 1976, the PCI obtained what would be its best result in the party&#x27;s history and gained 34.4% of the vote.

In Italy, while a government of national solidarity was ruling, Berlinguer said that in an emergency government a strong and powerful cabinet to solve a crisis of exceptional gravity was needed. On 16 March 1978, Aldo Moro, president of the DC, was kidnapped by the Red Brigades, a Marxist–Leninist terrorist group, on the day that the new government was going to be sworn in before the Italian Parliament. During this crisis, Berlinguer adhered to the &quot;fronte della fermezza&quot; (front of firmness), refusing to negotiate with terrorists, who had proposed to liberate Moro in exchange for the release of some imprisoned terrorists. Despite the PCI&#x27;s firm stand against terrorism, the Moro incident left the party more isolated. In June 1978, the PCI gave its approval and ultimately active support to a campaign against Giovanni Leone, the then president of Italy who was accused of being involved in the Lockheed bribery scandal, which resulted in his resignation. Berlinguer supported the election of the veteran socialist Sandro Pertini as president of Italy; his presidency did not produce the effects that the PCI had hoped for. In Italy, after a new president is elected, the government resigns. The PCI expected Pertini to use his influence in its favour but was instead influenced by other political leaders like Giovanni Spadolini of the PRI and Bettino Craxi of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), and thus the PCI remained out of the government. About Craxi, Berlinguer said: &quot;The thing that worries me about Craxi is that sometimes it seems to me that he thinks only of power for power&#x27;s sake.&quot;

The Historic Compromise ended in 1979 when the PCI exited from the parliamentary majority, amid negative electoral trends. The policy was unpopular among its base and was criticised for its contradictions, such as how to start a path towards socialism through a compromise with the DC, which was not economically socialist and from 1947 onwards had always been considered by the PCI as its historical enemy, what would have been the most urgent socialist-leaning measures, and the fact that on those points Berlinguer remained vague. Another contradiction was that, in the winter of 1976–1977, severe deflationary economic maneuvers were implemented and mostly hit the working class; before the Historic Compromise, the PCI would have defined those maneuvers as a sting to be fought firmly but now accepted it as part of a two-stage policy (first the recovery measures, then the reforms), which was similar to that adopted by the PSI in the Organic centre-left governments that the PCI had criticised. At the same time, the policy is praised for its uncompromising support of democracy and civil rights.

Berlinguer continued with the policy on the grounds that the process of legitimising communists would be long (the United States were bitterly opposed even under Jimmy Carter), and that choosing the election route, in the middle of serious economic and terrorist crises, would favour the political right. In early 1978, the Historic Compromise led to the contracted, recognised, and explicit&quot; participation of the PCI in the majority government that would support Giulio Andreotti&#x27;s new cabinet that was defined as one of national solidarity. The beginnings of this government were negative for the PCI because Moro had introduced personalities deeply disliked by Communists, in order to bring the whole DC to this agreement with the PCI, including the currents that opposed it, and Berlinguer thought of voting negative in a motion of confidence. Before this could happen, Moro was kidnapped and killed, and the PCI suffered losses in the 1979 Italian general election held in June.

=== Domestic policies and views ===

During the 1970s, the PCI governed many Italian regions, sometimes more than half of them. Notably, the regional governments of Emilia-Romagna and Tuscany were concrete proof of PCI&#x27;s governmental capabilities. In this period, Berlinguer turned his attention to the exercise of local power to show that &quot;the trains could run on time&quot; under the PCI. He personally took part in electoral campaigns in the provinces and local councils. While other parties sent only local leaders, this helped the party to win many elections at these levels. In the June 1975 regional elections, the PCI&#x27;s gap from the DC, which had been 10% points in the 1970 Italian regional elections, narrowed to less than two per cent at 1.8%, the PCI having jumped to 33.4% after a surge of 6.2%, while the DC fell to 35.2%, with a loss of 3.6%. In the June 1976 national elections, the PCI continued to grow at 34.4%; while the DC recovered and achieved 38.7%, the minor parties had dropped, and there were no longer the numbers for centrist governments. About the future, in an interview in June 1981 to &quot;Moby Dick&quot;, the monthly of the Sicilian FGCI, Berlinguer said: &quot;We save ourselves and move forward if we act together and not just one by one.&quot;

In a 1980 interview with Oriana Fallaci, Berlinguer said: &quot;We are communists. We are communists with originality and peculiarity, distinguishing ourselves from all the other communist parties: but we are communists, we remain communists.&quot; About fanaticism, he told Fallaci: &quot;I don&#x27;t throw rants at anyone, I don&#x27;t like to hurl curses, curses are expressions of fanaticism and there is too much fanaticism in the world.&quot; That same year, he stated on &quot;Tribuna politica&quot; that communism is &quot;the just transformation of society&quot;. In an interview in 1981 with Eugenio Scalfari of &quot;la Repubblica&quot;, Berlinguer outlined the &quot;questione morale&quot;, or moral question. He said: &quot;Today&#x27;s parties are above all machines of power and &quot;clientela&quot;.&quot; About the moral question, he added: &quot;The moral question has existed for some time, but it has now become the first and essential political question because the recovery of trust in the institutions, the effective governance of the country, and the stability of the democratic regime depend on its solution.&quot; About capitalism, he said: &quot;We think that the capitalist type of economic and social development is the cause of serious distortions, of immense costs and social inequalities, of enormous waste of wealth.&quot;

In a 1981 interview to &quot;Critica marxista&quot;, Berlinguer outlined the difference from other parties. He said: &quot;Our main difference from the others is that we Communists do not give up working and fighting for a radical transformation of society and the construction of a society of free and equal people. They would like left-wing parties that would limit themselves to correcting some flaws in the current system: we are not that type of party and we never will be.&quot; In the same interview, he reiterated: &quot;We do not give up building a &#x27;society of free and equal&#x27;, we do not give up leading the struggle of men and women for the production of the conditions of their lives.&quot; He stated that this was the main difference from social democrats and other socialists, and said that &quot;they put the commitment to change the given structure between parents, leading them to the obfuscation and loss of their own ideal and political autonomy. Our difference from social democracy lies in the fact that we communists will never give up that transforming commitment. About other Communist parties, he said: &quot;Our main &#x27;anomaly&#x27; compared to several other communist and workers&#x27; parties is that we are convinced that in the process towards this goal we must remain — and we will remain — faithful to the method of democracy. The &#x27;assault on heaven&#x27; — this beautiful image of Marx — is not for us Italian communists a project of irrationalistic climbing to the absolute.&quot; In a speech delivered by Berlinguer at the FGCI congress held in Milan in 1982, he said: &quot;If young people organise themselves, take over every branch of knowledge, and fight with the workers and the oppressed, there is no escape for an old order founded on privilege and injustice.&quot;

In an article written for &quot;Rinascita&quot; on 6 December 1982, titled &quot;Party and Society in the Reality of the 1980s&quot;, Berlinguer said: &quot;There can be no inventiveness, imagination, creation of the new if you start by burying yourself, your history and reality.&quot; In an interview in 1983 with Ferdinando Adornato, he said about communism that &quot;scientists are discussing more about the &quot;sole dell&#x27;avvenire&quot; [the establishment of socialism] today than the communists.&quot; That same year, in an interview with Giovanni Minoli about the labour movement, he stated: &quot;We refuse to let the usual ones pay, the workers, the popular masses. And we believe that if there must be sacrifices, and everyone must contribute proportionately, they must contribute to achieving certain goals, not to make the country go backwards.&quot; In his last rally, held on 7 June 1984, before his death, Berlinguer said: &quot;We are convinced that the world, even this terrible, intricate world of today, can be known, interpreted, transformed, and put at the service of man, his well-being, his happiness. The test for this goal is a test that can worthily fill a life.&quot; During his final rally, held just days later in Padua, he stated: &quot;Everyone work, house by house, company by company, street by street, in dialogue with the citizens, with trust for the battles we have waged, for the proposals we are presenting, for what we were and are. It is possible to win new and wider support for our lists, for our cause, which is the cause of peace, freedom, work, the progress of our civilisation!&quot;

=== Break with the Soviet Union and the Democratic Alternative ===
In 1980, the PCI publicly condemned the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and Moscow then immediately sent Georges Marchais to Rome to try to bring Berlinguer into line; he was received with perceptible coldness. The break with the Soviets and other Communist parties became clear when the PCI did not participate in the 1980 International Conference of Communist Parties held in Paris. Instead, Berlinguer made an official visit to China. In November 1980, Berlinguer declared in Salerno that the idea of a possible Historic Compromise had been put aside, and it would be replaced with the idea of the Democratic Alternative to both the real socialism of the East and the then social democracy of the West.

In 1981, Berlinguer said that, in his personal opinion, the progressive force of the October Revolution had been exhausted. The PCI criticised the martial law in Poland and soon the PCI&#x27;s split with the CPSU became definitive and official, followed by a long polemic between &quot;Pravda&quot; and &quot;l&#x27;Unità&quot; (the official newspaper of PCI), not made any milder after an October meeting with Cuban leader Fidel Castro in Havana; the PCI joked that they succeeded where the CIA failed when Berlinguer closed the hand of Castro&#x27;s security chief in the door of a GAZ Chaika who let out a single stoic moan (&quot;l&#x27;Unità&quot;″s Havana correspondent recalled that &quot;a sinister noise of broken bones&quot; was heard) before being hospitalised but the episode did not spoil Berlinguer&#x27;s visit. Nonetheless, his last years were marked by attempts for unity among the national and international political left. He also continued to underline the necessary link between democracy and socialism, which was followed by a strong commitment on the issues of nuclear disarmament and détente.

== Death and funeral ==

Berlinguer&#x27;s last major statement was a call for the solidarity among the leftist parties. On 7 June 1984, he suffered a brain haemorrhage while giving a speech at a public meeting in Padua. He entered a coma on the same day and died on 11 June, four days later. During this time, Sandro Pertini, the then Italian president, remained at the hospital with Berlinguer&#x27;s family. More than a million people attended his funeral in the Archbasilica of St. John Lateran at Piazza San Giovanni, the largest funeral in Italy&#x27;s history at the time. Reflecting his stature in Italian politics, the leaders of all parties paid tribute to his career and the Vatican expressed condolences.

Apart from all the major politicians across the political spectrum, many international figures, such as the Soviet deputy leader Mikhail Gorbachev and Chinese prime minister Zhao Ziyang, attended his funeral. From Gorbachev and Zhao to Georges Marchais, Santiago Carrillo, Yasser Arafat, and the Communists of the Philippines, Israel, Yugoslavia, and North Korea, to Giancarlo Pajetta and Pietro Ingrao, who said that the party would not deny him and that Communists would try to carry his name, they respended him and recognised him as an international leader. At his funeral, Tomaso Albinoni&#x27;s &quot;Adagio in G minor&quot; and Johann Sebastian Bach and Franz Schubert&#x27;s music were played. Much discussed, including from other parties like the DC and PSI and their representatives, such as Ciriaco De Mita, who praised the Historic Compromise, and Rino Formica, who said that the PCI had to decide between the left-wing alternative and the Historic Compromise, was the future of the PCI.

After his funeral, Berlinguer was interred in Rome&#x27;s Cimitero di Prima Porta. His death took place six days before the 1984 European Parliament election in Italy. The PCI gained a significant sympathy vote as a result, winning the most votes for the only time. His death remains controversial due to the fact he was taken back to the hotel to rest and an ambulance was called only two hours after he first fell ill. According to sociologist and journalist Rocco Turi, Berlinguer died not as a result of a cerebral stroke but for the direct responsibilities that he links to a series of delays in the same first aid operations. He said that &quot;we are now able to deny the theses of those years. They waited too long to take Berlinguer to the hospital; after the first illness, Berlinguer was in fact transported slowly first to the hotel, and then after more than two hours an ambulance was finally called. A completely crazy choice.&quot; Additionally, Turi said that Berlinguer was not operated on as soon as he arrived at the hospital, as is commonly understood, but that he was only taken to the operating room at 1:00 pm, after about two hours spent in the hotel, and two and a half hours later from his illness in Piazza della Frutta. He tied his death to that of Aldo Moro.

== Personal life ==
A non-believer, Berlinguer married in a civil ceremony the religious Letizia Laurenti (1928–2017), whom he met during a holiday in the Aosta Valley, on 26 September 1957 in the Capitoline Hill; they had been engaged for ten years, and both the PCI and her family were against it. While seemingly cold in public and in front of their children, their relationship has been described as &quot;a love from Romeo and Juliet&quot;. Together, they had four children: former &quot;TG3&quot; journalist Biancamaria (born 1959), RAI journalist Maria Stella (born 1961), Communist Refoundation Party politician Marco (born 1963), and Mediaset journalist Laura (born 1970). He often used to give his children tutoring lessons, including after a political meeting was concluded, on topics like Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and pre-Socratic philosophers but never in a forceful way; he did not expect them to follow his path in politics. Berlinguer said that they &quot;must be able to make their choices freely, without any prejudice&quot;.

As a Sardinian, Berlinguer said that he was a supporter of Cagliari Calcio; like many other communist and left-wing leaders, including Palmiro Togliatti and allegedly Antonio Gramsci, he was said to have been a supporter of Juventus. As many of his security escorts were supporters of SS Lazio, Berlinguer was forced to watch the club&#x27;s matches. He once left in the middle of a lunch with party members to watch a Juventus match. Another time, near the government building of the Palazzo della Farnesina, he saw a group of kids playing association football and started playing with them. Outside of politics and his passion for football, which he played as a child with his brother, Berlinguer played Rummy and loved the sea and sailing. Whenever he could, he would go on his cousin&#x27;s boat in Stintino, manoeuvring the mainsails and jibs with dexterity. In 1977, he risked his life when, not following the recommendation by relatives and sailors, he went out by boat because he could not return to Stintino for safety reasons. When the wind picked up, the sea got rough, and for several hours no one heard news about Berlinguer until his cousin Francesco Cossiga, the then interior minister, sent patrol boats to search for him.

Berlinguer was a lover of ballet and opera, the last one he had seen was Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Parsifal&quot; in Rome. Apart from philosophical and ideological readings, such as Gramsci&#x27;s &quot;mistica&quot; and the modern Machiavellian Prince, Berlinguer was an avid reader of novels; before his death, he last finished reading one by Marguerite Yourcenar. Very close to his family, he spent every Christmas with his brother and sister-in-law, and never had an hour of vacation without at least one of his children; he also gave regular visits to his ninety-year-old aunt, Iole Siglienti, every time she came in Cagliari. He was a fan of Roberto Benigni, about whom he said that he made him laugh even before he said his jokes, and iconic is the photo of him, laughing in Benigni&#x27;s arms at the Villa Borghese Festival. Berlinguer almost never understood Giorgio Forattini&#x27;s cartoons, and said: &quot;He&#x27;s our enemy.&quot; Within the context of the Years of Lead, Berlinguer had a security escort that included an armoured Alfa Romeo 2000 Berlina. Alberto Menichelli, Berlinguer&#x27;s personal car driver, said that &quot;if Moro had had it, they wouldn&#x27;t have been able to do what happened in via Fani&quot;. Menichelli, who said that it was an honour to be able to accompagny Berlinguer for fifteen years, continued to keep his memory alive with the Enrico Berlinguer Quadraro-Cinecittà cultural association, exhibitions, and other initiatives and about 300 members. A fan of motorcycles, Berlinguer came to be the owner of an Harley Davidson. Renzo Trivelli told &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot; that Berlinguer bought &quot;a Harley Davidson that [was] too big for him; when he arrives at the [PCI] offices, his supervisors help him get on and off the vehicle. A few months later, citing security reasons, the party forbade him to use it.&quot;

=== Personality ===
Not many journalists could have interviewed Berlinguer, as he could not bear fame and discouraged anecdotes. He was described as reserved, &quot;bashful, probably shy&quot;, and not much was known about his private life, including his music preferences, whether Bach or Wagner, when he was alive. A Sardinian fisherman who had known him in distant times told a reporter that &quot;[Berlinguer] was a serious, very reserved child. He never laughed.&quot; Berlinguer was so shy that, before a rally, he sipped a little whiskey that the driver Alberto Menichelli handed him from a small bottle kept in his jacket pocket. His notable 1983 television interview with Giovanni Minoli on &quot;Mixer&quot; is seen as evidence of Berlinguer not being corroded by vanity. In that same interview, asked about which was the quality he was most fond of, Berlinguer responded: &quot;That of having remained faithful to the ideals of my youth.&quot;

Berlinguer has been described in many ways but was generally recognised for political coherence and courage, together with a rare personal and political intelligence. A serious and morally rigorous man, he was sincerely respected even by his opponents, such as the Italian Social Movement leader Giorgio Almirante, who paid his homage to Berlinguer and lowered himself in front to his coffin at Botteghe Oscure. Riccardo Bisognero, the then Commander-General of the Carabinieri, said: &quot;He was not only the leader of a political party, but a point of reference for Italian democracy.&quot; His three days of agony were followed with great attention by the general population. Attended by more than a million people, his funeral was among the highest ever seen in Rome, and was reminiscent of the funeral of Palmiro Togliatti in 1964; in both cases, a group of directors filmed the event for a documentary. From Almirante to the then president of the Senate, Francesco Cossiga, to then interior minister Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, from all the major Italian personalities across the political spectrum to common people, including women and the youth, they all paid their respect to Berlinguer.

=== Politics ===
Berlinguer&#x27;s most important political act of his career in the PCI was the break with Soviet Communism, together with the creation of Eurocommunism and his substantial work towards contact with the moderate and particularly the Catholic half of the country. As evidence of his legacy, the Five Star Movement (M5S) put him in their pantheon and the former M5S leader Luigi Di Maio, who culturally formed himself on the political right, claimed Berlinguer&#x27;s legacy. Pierpaolo Farina, a young blogger, built a website about Berlinguer for the youth and those who had not known him, and soon reached 300,000 contacts. The fact that Berlinguer went down in history for preaching austerity, in Pier Paolo Pasolini&#x27;s terms expressed as a warning in 1974 that &quot;true fascism is the consumer society&quot;, is seen as a testament to his durature legacy and thinking. Even after 35 years since his death, in the words of Eugenio Scalfari, &quot;Enrico Berlinguer had a somewhat similar role in Italian politics (and not only) to the one Pope Francis is having today in the Catholic religion (and not only). Both followed a path of reformism so radical as to produce revolutionary effects; both were loved and respected even by their adversaries; both had a charisma that grasped reality and fueled a dream.&quot;

In the words of Giorgio Bocca, in his analysis after his death, Berlinguer had understood that, after &quot;the lacerations, the convulsions, the loss of prestige, of dynamism, of leadership of the PCI and of the left in general in the Seventies&quot; that had derived &quot;above all from the cultural inadequacy of a sclerotic Marxism and a formalist anti-fascism&quot;, he needed &quot;to bring back to the party and the left what remains alive of Marxism, its humanism, the defence of man from the exploitation and alienation that continue and perhaps worsen in post-industrial society.&quot; In the words of sociologist Francesco Alberoni, Berlinguer&#x27;s critique of Soviet Communism was &quot;never crude or hostile&quot;, and he had &quot;always considered it a deviation from an original project, an error, understandable in those historical situations, and correctable in the future. This is typical of the great ideological, intellectual leader who interprets history with a view to the future. It was these merits of him, as leader of an Italian party, as a democrat, as an outstanding ideological figure of international Communism, that provoked the sense of loss everywhere and even the homage of enemies.&quot;

Berlinguer&#x27;s search for a new socialism was to find a solution to the bipolar international blocs, and his name is thus associated to that of Willy Brandt and Olof Palme. In October 2012, Nichi Vendola said of his alternative Europeanism that &quot;the one that we continue to dream is not the unbalanced power that rules today, with an unknown identity. No: it is the Europe of Willy Brandt, of Olof Palme, of Enrico Berlinguer.&quot; Within the broad international Communist movement, Berlinguer had many opponents. The more orthodox Marxist–Leninist opposition argued that he had turned a workers&#x27; party into a bourgeois, revisionist one. External opponents said that the &quot;strappo&quot;, the break with the CPSU, took several years to be completed; this was seen as evidence that there had been no definitive decision on the point. The acceptance of NATO is generally seen as evidence of the genuine autonomy of the PCI&#x27;s position, and Berlinguer was seen in declassified CIA documents as the strongest critic of Soviet actions, such as their role in suppressing the Prague Spring of 1968, which was a turning point. Despite notably successful Communist local governments, Berlinguer&#x27;s efforts failed to bring the PCI into government. His final platform, &quot;The Democratic Alternative&quot;, was never realised. Within a decade of his death, the Soviet Union and the DC and PCI parties all disappeared, leading to the Second Italian Republic and transforming Italian politics beyond recognition. For some, for the vast population on the political left, which felt dispersed, his death marked the end of the PCI. On his death, not only the head of the largest Communist party in the West died but also an idea to which millions of Italians had dedicated a good part of their existence during the 20th century, what Francesco Guccini called &quot;the timeless dreams&quot;.

=== Impact on Italian society ===

As one of the most important figures of the First Italian Republic, Berlinguer&#x27;s impact on Italian society is reflected in references in popular culture, with a general love, admiration, and respect that transcended political affiliations. Italian actor and director Roberto Benigni declared publicly his admiration and personal love for Berlinguer. Besides making him the protagonist of the movie &quot;Berlinguer, I Love You&quot;, Benigni appeared with Berlinguer during a public political demonstration of the PCI, of which he was a sympathiser. Italian singer-songwriter Antonello Venditti posthumously dedicated a song, &quot;Dolce Enrico&quot; (&quot;Sweet Enrico&quot;), to Berlinguer. Italian folk music band Modena City Ramblers wrote a song about Berlinguer&#x27;s funeral, which was published on their first full-length album &quot;Riportando tutto a casa&quot; and was titled &quot;I funerali di Berlinguer&quot;.

An &quot;il Giornale nuovo&quot; article after his death proposed the psychological thesis that Berlinguer was not really loved but that people were forced to admire him and recognise his virtues. His qualities, such as reserve, honesty, seriousness, and puritanical rigour, made him a foreigner at home, and his death freed many people of a burden but also created a sense of guilt that was reflected in collective mourning and tributes from his adversaries.

<doc id="46654" wikidata="Q118886" url="?curid=46654" title="Four Cardinal Principles">
<text>The Four Cardinal Principles () were stated by Deng Xiaoping in March 1979 at the CCP Theory Conference, during the early phase of Reform and Opening-up, and are the four issues for which debate was not allowed within the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The Four Cardinal Principles were one of Deng&#x27;s Two Basic Points, the other of which was the Chinese economic reform.

The principles include:
# The principle of upholding the socialist path
# The principle of upholding the people&#x27;s democratic dictatorship
# The principle of upholding the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)
# The principle of upholding Mao Zedong Thought and Marxism–Leninism

Such principles marked a relaxation of control over ideology. In stating the four cardinal principles, an implication was that these four topics could not be questioned, but political ideas other than those in the list could be debated. Moreover, while the principles themselves are not subject to debate, the interpretations of those principles are.

On the other hand, the principles were proclaimed as a sign of adherence to the communist ideology, thus paving the secure way to reevaluation of the Cultural Revolution while preserving ideological stability and legitimacy of the CCP as a response to the Democracy Wall movement. 

The Four Cardinal Principles were emphasized in the 1981 &quot;Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party since the Founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China&quot; and were enshrined in Constitution of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1982.

<text>A radio telescope is a specialized antenna and radio receiver used to detect radio waves from astronomical radio sources in the sky. Radio telescopes are the main observing instrument used in radio astronomy, which studies the radio frequency portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, just as optical telescopes are used to make observations in the visible portion of the spectrum in traditional optical astronomy. Unlike optical telescopes, radio telescopes can be used in the daytime as well as at night. 

Since astronomical radio sources such as planets, stars, nebulas and galaxies are very far away, the radio waves coming from them are extremely weak, so radio telescopes require very large antennas to collect enough radio energy to study them, and extremely sensitive receiving equipment. Radio telescopes are typically large parabolic (&quot;dish&quot;) antennas similar to those employed in tracking and communicating with satellites and space probes. They may be used individually or linked together electronically in an array. Radio observatories are preferentially located far from major centers of population to avoid electromagnetic interference (EMI) from radio, television, radar, motor vehicles, and other man-made electronic devices.

Radio waves from space were first detected by engineer Karl Guthe Jansky in 1932 at Bell Telephone Laboratories in Holmdel, New Jersey using an antenna built to study radio receiver noise. The first purpose-built radio telescope was a 9-meter parabolic dish constructed by radio amateur Grote Reber in his back yard in Wheaton, Illinois in 1937. The sky survey he performed is often considered the beginning of the field of radio astronomy.

==Early radio telescopes==

The first radio antenna used to identify an astronomical radio source was built by Karl Guthe Jansky, an engineer with Bell Telephone Laboratories, in 1932. Jansky was assigned the task of identifying sources of static that might interfere with radiotelephone service. Jansky&#x27;s antenna was an array of dipoles and reflectors designed to receive short wave radio signals at a frequency of 20.5 MHz (wavelength about 14.6 meters). It was mounted on a turntable that allowed it to rotate in any direction, earning it the name &quot;Jansky&#x27;s merry-go-round.&quot; It had a diameter of approximately and stood tall. By rotating the antenna, the direction of the received interfering radio source (static) could be pinpointed. A small shed to the side of the antenna housed an analog pen-and-paper recording system. After recording signals from all directions for several months, Jansky eventually categorized them into three types of static: nearby thunderstorms, distant thunderstorms, and a faint steady hiss above shot noise, of unknown origin. Jansky finally determined that the &quot;faint hiss&quot; repeated on a cycle of 23 hours and 56 minutes. This period is the length of an astronomical sidereal day, the time it takes any &quot;fixed&quot; object located on the celestial sphere to come back to the same location in the sky. Thus Jansky suspected that the hiss originated outside of the Solar System, and by comparing his observations with optical astronomical maps, Jansky concluded that the radiation was coming from the Milky Way Galaxy and was strongest in the direction of the center of the galaxy, in the constellation of Sagittarius.

An amateur radio operator, Grote Reber, was one of the pioneers of what became known as radio astronomy. He built the first parabolic &quot;dish&quot; radio telescope, in diameter, in his back yard in Wheaton, Illinois in 1937. He repeated Jansky&#x27;s pioneering work, identifying the Milky Way as the first off-world radio source, and he went on to conduct the first sky survey at very high radio frequencies, discovering other radio sources. The rapid development of radar during World War II created technology which was applied to radio astronomy after the war, and radio astronomy became a branch of astronomy, with universities and research institutes constructing large radio telescopes.

==Types==
The range of frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum that makes up the radio spectrum is very large. As a consequence, the types of antennas that are used as radio telescopes vary widely in design, size, and configuration. At wavelengths of 30 meters to 3 meters (10–100 MHz), they are generally either directional antenna arrays similar to &quot;TV antennas&quot; or large stationary reflectors with movable focal points. Since the wavelengths being observed with these types of antennas are so long, the &quot;reflector&quot; surfaces can be constructed from coarse wire mesh such as chicken wire.
 At shorter wavelengths parabolic &quot;dish&quot; antennas predominate. The angular resolution of a dish antenna is determined by the ratio of the diameter of the dish to the wavelength of the radio waves being observed. This dictates the dish size a radio telescope needs for a useful resolution. Radio telescopes that operate at wavelengths of 3 meters to 30 cm (100 MHz to 1 GHz) are usually well over 100 meters in diameter. Telescopes working at wavelengths shorter than 30 cm (above 1 GHz) range in size from 3 to 90 meters in diameter.

===Frequencies===
The increasing use of radio frequencies for communication makes astronomical observations more and more difficult (see Open spectrum).
Negotiations to defend the frequency allocation for parts of the spectrum most useful for observing the universe are coordinated in the Scientific Committee on Frequency Allocations for Radio Astronomy and Space Science.

Some of the more notable frequency bands used by radio telescopes include:
* Every frequency in the United States National Radio Quiet Zone
* Channel 37: 608 to 614 MHz
* The &quot;Hydrogen line&quot;, also known as the &quot;21 centimeter line&quot;: 1,420.40575177 MHz, used by many radio telescopes including The Big Ear in its discovery of the Wow! signal
* 1,406 MHz and 430 MHz 
* The Waterhole: 1,420 to 1,666 MHz
* The Arecibo Observatory had several receivers that together covered the whole 1–10 GHz range.
* The Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe mapped the cosmic microwave background radiation in 5 different frequency bands, centered on 23 GHz, 33 GHz, 41 GHz, 61 GHz, and 94 GHz.

===Big dishes===
The world&#x27;s largest filled-aperture (i.e. full dish) radio telescope is the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) completed in 2016 by China. The dish with an area as large as 30 football fields is built into a natural karst depression in the landscape in Guizhou province and cannot move; the feed antenna is in a cabin suspended above the dish on cables. The active dish is composed of 4,450 moveable panels controlled by a computer. By changing the shape of the dish and moving the feed cabin on its cables, the telescope can be steered to point to any region of the sky up to 40° from the zenith. Although the dish is 500 meters in diameter, only a 300-meter circular area on the dish is illuminated by the feed antenna at any given time, so the actual effective aperture is 300 meters. Construction began in 2007 and was completed July 2016 and the telescope became operational September 25, 2016.

The world&#x27;s second largest filled-aperture telescope was the Arecibo radio telescope located in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, though it suffered catastrophic collapse on 1 December 2020. Arecibo was one of the world&#x27;s few radio telescope also capable of active (i.e., transmitting) radar imaging of near-Earth objects (see: radar astronomy); most other telescopes employ passive detection, i.e., receiving only. Arecibo was another stationary dish telescope like FAST. Arecibo&#x27;s dish was built into a natural depression in the landscape, the antenna was steerable within an angle of about 20° of the zenith by moving the suspended feed antenna, giving use of a 270-meter diameter portion of the dish for any individual observation.

The largest individual radio telescope of any kind is the RATAN-600 located near Nizhny Arkhyz, Russia, which consists of a 576-meter circle of rectangular radio reflectors, each of which can be pointed towards a central conical receiver.

The above stationary dishes are not fully &quot;steerable&quot;; they can only be aimed at points in an area of the sky near the zenith, and cannot receive from sources near the horizon. The largest fully steerable dish radio telescope is the 100 meter Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia, United States, constructed in 2000. The largest fully steerable radio telescope in Europe is the Effelsberg 100-m Radio Telescope near Bonn, Germany, operated by the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy, which also was the world&#x27;s largest fully steerable telescope for 30 years until the Green Bank antenna was constructed. The third-largest fully steerable radio telescope is the 76-meter Lovell Telescope at Jodrell Bank Observatory in Cheshire, England, completed in 1957. The fourth-largest fully steerable radio telescopes are six 70-meter dishes: three Russian RT-70, and three in the NASA Deep Space Network. The planned Qitai Radio Telescope, at a diameter of , is expected to become the world&#x27;s largest fully steerable single-dish radio telescope when completed in 2028.

A more typical radio telescope has a single antenna of about 25 meters diameter. Dozens of radio telescopes of about this size are operated in radio observatories all over the world.

===Radio Telescopes in space===

Since 1965, humans have launched three space-based radio telescopes. The first one, KRT-10, was attached to Salyut 6 orbital space station in 1979. In 1997, Japan sent the second, HALCA. The last one was sent by Russia in 2011 called Spektr-R.
==Radio interferometry==

One of the most notable developments came in 1946 with the introduction of the technique called astronomical interferometry, which means combining the signals from multiple antennas so that they simulate a larger antenna, in order to achieve greater resolution. Astronomical radio interferometers usually consist either of arrays of parabolic dishes (e.g., the One-Mile Telescope), arrays of one-dimensional antennas (e.g., the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope) or two-dimensional arrays of omnidirectional dipoles (e.g., Tony Hewish&#x27;s Pulsar Array). All of the telescopes in the array are widely separated and are usually connected using coaxial cable, waveguide, optical fiber, or other type of transmission line. Recent advances in the stability of electronic oscillators also now permit interferometry to be carried out by independent recording of the signals at the various antennas, and then later correlating the recordings at some central processing facility. This process is known as Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI). Interferometry does increase the total signal collected, but its primary purpose is to vastly increase the resolution through a process called aperture synthesis. This technique works by superposing (interfering) the signal waves from the different telescopes on the principle that waves that coincide with the same phase will add to each other while two waves that have opposite phases will cancel each other out. This creates a combined telescope that is equivalent in resolution (though not in sensitivity) to a single antenna whose diameter is equal to the spacing of the antennas furthest apart in the array.

A high-quality image requires a large number of different separations between telescopes. Projected separation between any two telescopes, as seen from the radio source, is called a baseline. For example, the Very Large Array (VLA) near Socorro, New Mexico has 27 telescopes with 351 independent baselines at once, which achieves a resolution of 0.2 arc seconds at 3 cm wavelengths. Martin Ryle&#x27;s group in Cambridge obtained a Nobel Prize for interferometry and aperture synthesis. The Lloyd&#x27;s mirror interferometer was also developed independently in 1946 by Joseph Pawsey&#x27;s group at the University of Sydney. In the early 1950s, the Cambridge Interferometer mapped the radio sky to produce the famous 2C and 3C surveys of radio sources. An example of a large physically connected radio telescope array is the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope, located in Pune, India. The largest array, the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR), finished in 2012, is located in western Europe and consists of about 81,000 small antennas in 48 stations distributed over an area several hundreds of kilometers in diameter and operates between 1.25 and 30 m wavelengths. VLBI systems using post-observation processing have been constructed with antennas thousands of miles apart. Radio interferometers have also been used to obtain detailed images of the anisotropies and the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background, like the CBI interferometer in 2004.

The world&#x27;s largest physically connected telescope, the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), is planned to start operations in 2027, Although the first stations had &quot;first fringes&quot; in 2024.

==Astronomical observations==

Many astronomical objects are not only observable in visible light but also emit radiation at radio wavelengths. Besides observing energetic objects such as pulsars and quasars, radio telescopes are able to &quot;image&quot; most astronomical objects such as galaxies, nebulae, and even radio emissions from planets.

<doc id="46658" wikidata="Q747405" url="?curid=46658" title="Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme">
<text>Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme is the third studio album by the American folk rock duo Simon &amp; Garfunkel. Produced by Bob Johnston, the album was released on October 24, 1966, in the United States by Columbia Records. Following the success of the re-release of their debut single &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot;, Simon &amp; Garfunkel regrouped after a time apart while Columbia issued their second album, a rushed collection titled &quot;Sounds of Silence&quot;. For their third album, the duo spent almost three months in the studio working on instrumentation and production.

The album largely consists of acoustic pieces that were mostly written during Paul Simon&#x27;s period in England the previous year, including some songs recycled from his debut solo record, &quot;The Paul Simon Songbook&quot;. The album includes the Garfunkel-led piece &quot;For Emily, Whenever I May Find Her&quot;, as well as &quot;7 O&#x27;Clock News/Silent Night&quot;, a combination of news reports of the day (the Vietnam War, the civil rights movement, the death of comedian Lenny Bruce), and the Christmas carol &quot;Silent Night&quot;.

Many critics consider it a breakthrough in recording for the duo, and one of their best efforts. &quot;Homeward Bound&quot; had already been a top five hit in numerous countries and &quot;Scarborough Fair/Canticle&quot; performed similarly. The album peaked at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Album Chart and was eventually certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. In 1999, the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

== Recording and production ==
Simon &amp; Garfunkel were given four months to record the album, which allowed the duo considerable freedom in terms of creativity. The band&#x27;s previous album, &quot;Sounds of Silence&quot;, was a &quot;rush job&quot; produced to capitalize on the success of their first hit single, &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot;. The studio time for &quot;Parsley&quot; caused its budget to increase into an unusual cost for albums at that time—around $30,000 (US$ in dollars), Simon speculated. &quot;Parsley&quot; was the first time Simon insisted on total control in aspects of recording. The album was the duo&#x27;s first to be recorded on an eight-track recorder, which the duo persuaded Columbia Records to use. Vocal takes were overdubbed, as they found it difficult to get &quot;decent separation&quot; between Simon&#x27;s voice and guitar. Columbia executives took notice of the longer production time, commenting, &quot;Boy, you really take a lot of time to make records.&quot;

The bulk of &quot;Parsley&quot; was recorded over a week in June 1966, with an additional recording date in July and two in August. Two previously released songs from the December 1965 &quot;Sounds of Silence&quot; sessions were also added to the track listing: &quot;Homeward Bound&quot; had originally been released as the second single from that album but had been left off the track listing of the US LP release; and &quot;Flowers Never Bend with the Rainfall&quot; had already appeared on the B-side of &quot;I Am a Rock&quot;. Garfunkel considered the recording of &quot;Scarborough Fair&quot; to be the moment the duo stepped into the role of producer because they were constantly beside Roy Halee mixing the track.

== Composition ==

&quot;Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme&quot; is largely characterized by sharp contrasts from song to song. Simon found it difficult to write new songs; biographer Peter Ames Carlin notes that the sequence of promotion, including concerts and interviews, made Simon feel out of his element. &quot;He needed things to be familiar&quot;, he wrote. In addition, sudden fame had affected both his relationships and him personally. Much of the album is composed of recycled songs written by Simon during his period in England in 1965. Three songs on the album—&quot;Patterns&quot;, &quot;Flowers Never Bend with the Rainfall&quot;, and &quot;A Simple Desultory Philippic&quot;—also appear on Simon&#x27;s first solo effort, &quot;The Paul Simon Songbook&quot; (&quot;Canticle&quot;, the second half of opening ballad &quot;Scarborough Fair&quot;, is also culled from another song on the record, &quot;The Side of a Hill&quot;).

&quot;Scarborough Fair&quot;, the title track, a traditional ballad, combines &quot;fingerpicked guitar accompaniment, delicate chimes, harpsichord embellishments, and the vocal blend&quot;. &quot;Patterns&quot; posits that the average life is no less predetermined than that of a rat in a maze. String snaps are used prominently in &quot;Patterns&quot;, as well as a &quot;syncopated bass and frenetic bongo part&quot;. Much of the original guitar line remains the same from its earlier incarnation. &quot;Cloudy&quot; revolves around &quot;a hitchhiker&#x27;s meanderings in northern California&quot;. It employs a &quot;breezy, almost jazzy musical style&quot;. &quot;Homeward Bound&quot; carries a sense of melancholia, which biographer Marc Eliot attributed to an &quot;echo of longing&quot; that had resurfaced during the recording process over the failed relationship with Kathy Chitty. &quot;The Big Bright Green Pleasure Machine&quot; is a &quot;satirical appropriation of an electric, organ-heavy psychedelic rock style,&quot; in which the singer complains of various woes in his life, which can be &quot;readily eased&quot; by purchasing the titular device. &quot;The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin&#x27; Groovy)&quot; is a brief vignette &quot;made up of variations on a two-bar ostinato figure,&quot; in which the protagonist goes about a carefree morning.

&quot;The Dangling Conversation&quot; concerns a dying relationship, but Garfunkel disliked the song, feeling it pretentious. In contrast to its earlier appearance on &quot;The Paul Simon Songbook&quot;, &quot;Flowers Never Bend with the Rainfall&quot; appears here as a &quot;folk combo that produces a bright, almost bluegrass sound&quot;. &quot;A Simple Desultory Philippic&quot; is a &quot;satirical rant about the singer&#x27;s confrontations with a wide variety of pop-culture personalities and phenomena&quot;. In the song, Simon vocally imitates Bob Dylan, as well as his harmonica interjections. &quot;For Emily, Whenever I May Find Her&quot; has sometimes been thought to be named after poet Emily Dickinson. Simon later explained that &quot;For Emily&quot; is not about an imaginary girl Emily, but about the belief in true love, while the song &quot;Overs&quot; (from the album &quot;Bookends&quot;) is about the loss of that belief. While other songs, such as &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot;, had taken months for Simon to complete writing, others, such as &quot;For Emily&quot;, were written in a single night. &quot;A Poem on the Underground Wall&quot; largely revolves around a man creating graffiti on a sign in a subway station, with Simon also bringing into play &quot;a variety of visceral and religious images&quot;.

&quot;7 O&#x27;Clock News/Silent Night&quot; is a sound collage consisting of the duo singing &quot;Silent Night&quot; in two-part harmony over an arpeggiated piano part while a news report plays. &quot;The result rather bluntly makes an ironic commentary on various social ills by juxtaposing them with tenderly expressed Christmas sentiments.&quot; The simulated newscast was voiced by Charlie O&#x27;Donnell, then a radio disc jockey.

== Cover artwork ==
Shot by photographer Bob Cato, the cover depicts Simon &amp; Garfunkel in a flower garden. &quot;Artie is sprawled in jeans and a royal blue sweater, while Paul rises just behind, the modern poet-troubadour clad in cambric and shadow,&quot; wrote Peter Ames Carlin in Simon&#x27;s biography, &quot;Homeward Bound&quot;. The original back cover of the LP includes an essay by music critic Ralph J. Gleason.

== Songwriting credit disputes ==
There were some copyright disputes about the album&#x27;s contents. &quot;Cloudy&quot; was co-written by Bruce Woodley, who did not initially receive credit upon the album&#x27;s release. He still collected royalty payments for the song, but was not listed as an official writer as Simon &quot;needed&quot; it to be credited to him alone. Martin Carthy, who had first introduced Simon to &quot;Scarborough Fair&quot; during his time in England, was never credited. Worse, according to Peter Ames Carlin, &quot;it credited Paul and Artie as co-authors, as if the centuries-old tune had emerged entirely from their imaginations.&quot; Columbia was contacted by Carthy&#x27;s publishing company, Sparta Florida, to claim royalties, and they complied. However, as Carlin notes, &quot;none of the money ever got to Carthy&quot; due to fine-print on a contract he had never read that ceded his stake in the song.

== Release ==
After issuing several singles and receiving sold-out college campus shows, &quot;Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme&quot; was released by Columbia Records on October 24, 1966. The duo resumed their trek on the college circuit eleven days following the release, crafting an image that was described as &quot;alienated&quot;, &quot;weird&quot;, and &quot;poetic&quot;. Manager Mort Lewis also was largely responsible for this public perception, as he withheld them from television appearances (unless they were allowed to play an uninterrupted set or choose the setlist).

== Reception ==
Bruce Eder of AllMusic called it the duo&#x27;s &quot;first masterpiece&quot;, one that regarded &quot;youthful exuberance and alienation, [proving] perennially popular among older, more thoughtful high-school students and legions of college audiences across generations.&quot; Andy Fyfe of BBC Music wrote in 2009 that he felt the record carried a sense of timelessness, calling its &quot;boldest themes [...] still worryingly pertinent today,&quot; while remarking that the record as a whole &quot;reflected the social upheaval of the mid-60s while playing as substantial a part in folk rock&#x27;s evolution.&quot;

In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; listed the album at number 201 on their list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, dropping one position to number 202 in a 2012 revised list.
Disc jockey and author Pete Fornatale wrote that &quot;Few others have come close to the intelligence, beauty, variety, creativity, and craftsmanship that &quot;Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme&quot; captured.&quot; Andrew Gilbert, in &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;, called it &quot;their first great album,&quot; producing &quot;a sense of impending doom and Simon&#x27;s insistence on emotional connection that makes the album such an enduring work.&quot;

<text>The Graduate is a 1968 album of songs and music from the soundtrack of Mike Nichols&#x27; movie &quot;The Graduate&quot;. It includes five songs from the folk-rock duo Simon &amp; Garfunkel, including &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot;, a work in progress which Simon adapted to fit the movie, along with several instrumental pieces by Dave Grusin. Released January 21 on Columbia Masterworks, the album was produced by Teo Macero. In March of the following year, Simon and Grusin won the 1968 Grammy Award for &quot;Best Original Score Written for a Motion Picture or Television Special&quot;. &quot;Mrs Robinson&quot; received the Grammy for &quot;Record of the Year&quot;, whilst Simon &amp; Garfunkel collected the &quot;Best Contemporary-pop Performance, Vocal Duo or Group&quot; award.

Although the album features two versions of &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot;, neither is the full version as featured on &quot;Bookends&quot;, which was composed later. The first consists of relentless, sharp guitar chords, with the &quot;dee-de-dee-dee&quot; sung motif, while the second includes a chorus, before tapering off as it does in the film. The other major song of the album, the 1965 hit &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot;, is used three times in the film. Both songs have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame (in 1999 and 2004 respectively).

<text>Bookends is the fourth studio album by the American folk rock duo Simon &amp; Garfunkel. Produced by Paul Simon, Art Garfunkel and Roy Halee, the album was released on April 3, 1968, in the United States by Columbia Records. The duo had risen to fame two years prior with the albums &quot;Sounds of Silence&quot; and &quot;Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme&quot; and the soundtrack album for the 1967 film &quot;The Graduate&quot;.

&quot;Bookends&quot; is a concept album that explores a life journey from childhood to old age. Side one of the album marks successive stages in life, the theme serving as bookends to the life cycle. Side two largely consists of previously-released singles and of unused material for &quot;The Graduate&quot; soundtrack. Simon&#x27;s lyrics concern youth, disillusionment, relationships, old age, and mortality. Much of the material was crafted alongside producer John Simon (no relation), who joined the recording when Paul Simon suffered from writer&#x27;s block. The album was recorded gradually over the period of a year, with production speeding up around the later months of 1967.

Initial sales for &quot;Bookends&quot; were substantial in the US, and the album produced the number-one single &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot;. The album sold well in the US and in the United Kingdom, where it peaked at number one. &quot;Bookends&quot; was considered a breakthrough for the duo, placing them on the same level as artists such as Aretha Franklin, The Beatles, Bob Dylan, and The Rolling Stones at the forefront of the countercultural movement in the 1960s. The album has continued to receive critical acclaim and is often debated by critics as to whether it or &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot; is Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#x27;s best album.

==Background==
Simon &amp; Garfunkel first became prominent on American radio in 1965 with their record &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot;, which became a hit during a period in which the duo had broken up due to the failure of their debut album, &quot;Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.&quot; (1964). Following another release, &quot;Sounds of Silence&quot; (1965), the duo recorded and released &quot;Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme&quot; (1966), which brought new critical and commercial success to the duo. Simon, then 25, felt he had finally &quot;made it&quot; into an upper echelon of rock and roll, while most importantly retaining artistic integrity (&quot;making him spiritually closer to Bob Dylan than to, say, Bobby Darin&quot;, wrote biographer Marc Eliot). The duo chose William Morris as their booking agency after a recommendation from Wally Amos, a mutual friend through their producer, Tom Wilson.

During the sessions for &quot;Parsley&quot;, the duo cut &quot;A Hazy Shade of Winter&quot; and decided to release it as a single then, where it peaked at number 13 on the national charts. Similarly, they recorded &quot;At the Zoo&quot; for single release in early 1967 (it charted lower, at number 16). Simon began work for &quot;Bookends&quot; around this time, noting to a writer at &quot;High Fidelity&quot; that &quot;I&#x27;m not interested in singles anymore&quot;. He had hit a dry spell in his writing, which led to no Simon &amp; Garfunkel album on the horizon for 1967. Artists at the time were expected to release two, perhaps three albums each year and the lack of productivity from the duo worried executives at Columbia Records. Amid concerns for Simon&#x27;s idleness, Columbia Records chairman Clive Davis arranged for up-and-coming record producer John Simon to kick-start the recording. Simon was distrustful of &quot;suits&quot; at the label; on one occasion, he and Garfunkel brought a tape recorder into a meeting with Davis, who was giving a &quot;fatherly talk&quot; on speeding up production, in order to laugh at it later.

Meanwhile, director Mike Nichols, then filming &quot;The Graduate&quot;, had become fascinated with the duo&#x27;s past two efforts, listening to them nonstop before and after filming. After two weeks of this obsession, he met with Clive Davis to ask for permission to license Simon &amp; Garfunkel music for his film. Davis viewed it as a perfect fit and envisioned a best-selling soundtrack album. Simon was not as immediately receptive, viewing movies akin to &quot;selling out&quot;, creating a damper on his artistic integrity. However, after meeting Nichols and becoming impressed by his wit and the script, he agreed to write at least one or two new songs for the film. Leonard Hirshan, a powerful agent at William Morris, negotiated a deal that paid Simon $25,000 (US$ in dollars) to submit three songs to Nichols and producer Lawrence Turman. Several weeks later, Simon re-emerged with two new tracks, &quot;Punky&#x27;s Dilemma&quot; and &quot;Overs&quot;, neither of which Nichols was particularly taken with. The duo offered another new song, which later became &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot;, that was not as developed. Nichols loved it.

==Recording and production==

&quot;Bookends&quot; was recorded sporadically from 1966 to 1968. John Simon&#x27;s first session with the group was for &quot;Fakin&#x27; It&quot; in June 1967. The duo were signed under an older contract that specified that the label pay for sessions (&quot;As a folk duo, how much could recording costs be?&quot; said John Simon). Simon &amp; Garfunkel took advantage of this indulgence, hiring viola and brass players, as well as percussionists. When the viola players arrived, the duo were so intrigued with the sound of the musicians tuning their instruments before recording that they spent nearly all night (at Columbia&#x27;s expense) trying to find the random sound.

The record&#x27;s brevity reflects its concise and perfectionistic production. The team spent over 50 studio hours recording &quot;Punky&#x27;s Dilemma&quot;, for example, and re-recorded vocal parts, sometimes note by note, until they were satisfied. Simon paid close attention to his vocal takes, and he strived to get each line perfect. He took a bigger role in all aspects of production, and harmonies for which the band was famous gradually disappeared in favor of songs sung solo by each member. Although the album had been planned long in advance, work did not begin in earnest until the late months of 1967.

John Simon&#x27;s work with the duo produced several tracks that ended up on &quot;Bookends&quot;, such as &quot;Punky&#x27;s Dilemma&quot;, &quot;Save the Life of My Child&quot;, and &quot;Overs&quot;. In October 1967, Morgan Ames, writer for &quot;High Fidelity&quot; magazine, attended a recording session with the duo, Simon, Halee and an assistant engineer at Columbia&#x27;s recording studio on 52nd Street in New York City. Her observations were reported in the November edition of the magazine:

Work on &quot;Bookends&quot; slowed by the beginning of the new year, with John Simon&#x27;s departure from Columbia. The duo and Halee completed production themselves, recording &quot;America&quot; on February 1, the final version of &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot; on February 2, and &quot;Old Friends&quot; and the closing &quot;Bookends Theme&quot; on March 8. Simon felt the album &quot;had the most use of the studio&quot; of all of the duo&#x27;s albums.

==Composition==
===Music===

The &quot;Bookends Theme&quot; that opens and closes side one is played on the acoustic guitar, with no additional instruments. An audio sample of the band&#x27;s first hit, &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot;, softly plays during a cacophony of sounds near the end of the second track, &quot;Save the Life of My Child&quot;. John Simon, who was credited with production assistance on the song, created the bassline by playing a Moog synthesizer with help from Robert Moog himself. James Bennighof, author of &quot;The Words and Music of Paul Simon&quot;, finds that &quot;textural elements are variously supported by a churning groove, percussive, and distorted electronic sounds&quot; that complement the song&#x27;s subject matter, suicide suburban youth. The song &quot;America&quot; explores the search of meaning in the life of a young adult. &quot;Overs&quot; explores a more jazz-oriented style, with a larger selection of chords and looser form than the group&#x27;s previous styles.

&quot;Voices of Old People&quot; is a sound collage, and was recorded on tape by Garfunkel at the United Home for Aged Hebrews in New Rochelle, New York, and the California Home for the Aged at Reseda. The collection of audio recordings of the elderly find them musing on treasured photographs, illness and living conditions. In &quot;Old Friends&quot;, the title generally conveys the introduction or ending of sections through repetition, and the song builds upon a &quot;rather loose formal structure&quot; that at first includes an acoustic guitar and soft mood. An additional element is introduced midway through the track: an orchestral arrangement conducted by Jimmie Haskell, dominated by strings and xylophone notes. Horns and other instruments are added when the duo cease singing, creating a turbulence that builds to a single high, sustained note on the strings. The song then segues into the final song of side one, the reprise of the &quot;Bookends Theme&quot;.

Side two consists of miscellaneous unrelated songs unused for &quot;The Graduate&quot;, with many possessing a more rock-based sound than the unified folk songs that precede it. Simon felt the album&#x27;s second side was composed of throwaway tracks: &quot;They didn&#x27;t mean a lot. They weren&#x27;t well recorded.&quot; In &quot;Fakin&#x27; It&quot;, melodies are occasionally deleted to suit lyrics, but the song generally follows a similar chord structure and melodic outline over a &quot;funky rock beat&quot; that sonically references the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;. &quot;Punky&#x27;s Dilemma&quot; is breezy and minimal musically, with a soft jazz-style percussion and seemingly improvised guitar lines dominated by major and minor seventh chords. &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot; opens with an &quot;instantly recognizable&quot; pop rock guitar hook that carries throughout the track. The first verse consists only of syllables—&quot;dee-dee-dee&quot; and &quot;doo-doo-doo&quot;—that form stable harmonic foundation. The inclusion of the meaningless syllables arises from the unfinished nature of the song when pitched to director Mike Nichols, who particularly liked the verse. &quot;A Hazy Shade of Winter&quot; follows a more rock-tinged sound, with a fairly straightforward verse-refrain structure. &quot;At the Zoo&quot; uses a rock groove that settles into the key of G major.

===Lyrics===

According to disc jockey and author Pete Fornatale, the album perhaps shares thematic qualities with another concept album, the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, released ten months prior. He equates &quot;At the Zoo&quot; and &quot;Old Friends&quot; to &quot;Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!&quot; and &quot;When I&#x27;m Sixty-Four&quot;, respectively. Fornatale notes, however, that while &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; was notable for sonically colorful, psychedelic shapes, &quot;Bookends&quot; is starkly contrasted by moody, &quot;black-and-white and gray&quot; sounds. While concept albums were fairly common among rock groups at this time—such as The Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Their Satanic Majesties Request&quot;, The Byrds&#x27; &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; and Iron Butterfly&#x27;s &quot;In-a-Gadda-Da-Vida&quot;—&quot;Bookends&quot; enjoyed massive success with the format not unlike the Beatles nearly one year before. Garfunkel confirmed the influence of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s&quot; in a 2015 interview, commenting, &quot;We were terribly impressed, and that shone a light on the path that led to &quot;Bookends&quot;.&quot; Simon often smoked hashish when writing, and he was convinced he must be high to write. He felt the drug had a negative effect and caused him to &quot;retreat more into myself.&quot; He often found himself alone while on tour, and his thoughts grew dark during these times. He attributed &quot;the pain that comes out in some of the songs is due to the exaggeration of being high.&quot;

&quot;Bookends&quot; contains many of Paul Simon&#x27;s major themes, including &quot;youth, alienation, life, love, disillusionment, relationships, old age, and mortality&quot;. Simon&#x27;s work on &quot;Bookends&quot; is loosely autobiographical, designed to function as both a personal and artistic statement. Simon, &quot;feeling especially auteurist in the Dylan style of the day&quot;, had planned out the album&#x27;s concept before he began writing, telling Garfunkel &quot;I&#x27;m going to start writing a whole side of an album—a cycle of songs. I want the early ones to be about youth and the last song to be about old age, and I want the feel of each song to fit.&quot; &quot;Bookends&quot;, originally released primarily as a vinyl LP, opens and closes side one of the disc with the &quot;Bookends Theme&quot;, a brief acoustic piece (once compared to the work of English rock band the Moody Blues) that evokes &quot;a time of innocence&quot;. &quot;Save the Life of My Child&quot; is a dramatic story involving drugs, violence and a mother-and-child relationship. According to James Bennighof, the song &quot;deals with individual crises in crowded urban settings, along with references to larger societal forces and at least a hint of some transcendent perspective&quot;. The song crossfades into &quot;America&quot;, which follows two young lovers—&quot;an apparently impromptu romantic traveling alliance&quot;—as they board a Greyhound bus &quot;to look for America&quot;. It is a protest song that &quot;creates a cinematic vista that tells of the singer&#x27;s search for a literal and physical America that seems to have disappeared, along with the country&#x27;s beauty and ideals&quot;. &quot;Overs&quot; includes themes regarding the disintegration of love and marriage. &quot;Old Friends&quot; paints a portrait of two old men reminiscing on the years of their youth. The two men &quot;sit on a park bench like bookends&quot;, and ponder how strange it feels to be nearing the end of their lifetimes. The song is joined with the &quot;Bookends Theme&quot;, this time with vocal accompaniment from the duo. The piece closes the entire suite with the &quot;resigned admonition&quot; to &quot;Preserve your memories / They&#x27;re all that&#x27;s left you&quot;.

&quot;Fakin&#x27; It&quot; opens side two and finds the protagonist mulling over his insecurities and shortcomings. It has been suggested that &quot;Fakin&#x27; It&quot; may be an allegory for Simon&#x27;s relationship with Art Garfunkel. &quot;Punky&#x27;s Dilemma&quot; employs breakfast-food images to lampoon Hollywood and the film industry. It improbably takes an &quot;abrupt left turn&quot; in its third verse, when the singer begins to fantasize himself an admired soldier. &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot; collects wide-ranging images to address social milieu, with a constant reassurance that Jesus loves the eponymous character, God will bless her, and heaven will welcome her. The song includes a famous reference to athlete Joe DiMaggio of the New York Yankees, one of Simon&#x27;s favorite baseball teams. It also features an explicit homage to the Beatles, with Simon uttering the meaningless phrase &quot;coo-coo-ca-choo&quot; based on the line &quot;Goo goo g&#x27;joob,&quot; sung by John Lennon in &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot;. &quot;A Hazy Shade of Winter&quot; is an older track that dates back to Simon&#x27;s days in England in 1965. The song follows a hopeless poet, with &quot;manuscripts of unpublished rhyme&quot;, unsure of his achievements in life. In sharp contrast, the whimsical, Orwellian &quot;At the Zoo&quot; both concludes the album and what Simon described as the &quot;cycle of life&quot;. The song indicates that the personalities of certain zoo animals may represent particular walks of people. The song was originally intended as a possible children&#x27;s book. According to rock journalist Bud Scoppa, &quot;the record is a meditation on the passage of life and the psychological impact of life&#x27;s irreversible, ever-accumulating losses&quot;. The song cycle also describes the life and death of the romantic ideal of the American Dream.

==Release and commercial performance==

Prior to the release of the album, the band helped put together, and performed at, the Monterey Pop Festival. &quot;Fakin&#x27; It&quot; was issued as a single that summer, but the duo was much more focused on the rising FM format, which played album cuts. On the label of the original 45 RPM single, the 3:14-long &quot;Fakin&#x27; It&quot; was shown as having a run time of &quot;2:74&quot;, to try to get past radio programmers who were still strictly applying the &quot;under 3 minutes&quot; pop single formula. &quot;Fakin&#x27; It&quot; had only modest success on AM radio. In January 1968, the duo appeared on a Kraft Music Hall special, &quot;Three for Tonight&quot;, performing ten songs largely culled from their third album. Richard Avedon, regarded then as one of the best photographers, was commissioned to shoot the album cover. When viewed closely, one can see Avedon&#x27;s reflection in Simon&#x27;s irises.

&quot;Bookends&quot; was released by Columbia Records on April 3, 1968. In a historical context, that was just 24 hours before the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., which spurred nationwide outrage and riots. Fornatale opines that the album served as &quot;comfort food&quot; during rather tumultuous times within the nation. The album debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Album Chart in the issue dated April 27, 1968, climbing to number one and staying at that position for seven non-consecutive weeks, remaining on the chart for a total of 66 weeks. &quot;Bookends&quot; received such heavy orders weeks in advance of its release that Columbia was able to apply for award certification before copies had left the warehouse, a fact that was touted in magazine ads. The record became the duo&#x27;s best-selling album to date. It fed off the buzz created by the release of &quot;The Graduate&quot; soundtrack album ten weeks earlier, creating an initial combined sales figure of over five million units. In the United Kingdom, &quot;Bookends&quot; was a number one hit. The album charted highly in both Australia and France, peaking in both countries at number three.

The duo had a complicated relationship with Davis; Simon was particularly outraged when Davis suggested raising the list price of &quot;Bookends&quot; to $5.79 (US$ in dollars), one dollar above the standard retail price. Davis explained that including a large poster with each copy made it necessary to charge an extra dollar to cover the cost. Simon scoffed and viewed it as charging a premium on &quot;what was sure to be that year&#x27;s best-selling Columbia album&quot;. According to biographer Marc Eliot, Davis was &quot;offended by what he perceived as their lack of gratitude for what he believed was his role in turning them into superstars&quot;. Rather than implement Davis&#x27; price increase plan, Simon &amp; Garfunkel signed a contract extension with Columbia that guaranteed them a higher royalty rate.

==Critical reception==
Reviews of &quot;Bookends&quot; upon its release in 1968 were largely positive. Allen Evans of the British publication &quot;New Musical Express&quot; (NME) gave the record four out of five stars and called it &quot;inspiring, descriptive music,&quot; while noting the album is &quot;Imaginative and at times confusing to know what the composer is getting at, if anything.&quot; Rival newspaper &quot;Melody Maker&quot; did not use a ratings system, but called &quot;Bookends&quot; a &quot;thoughtful, clever and well-produced album.&quot; Reviewer Chris Welch criticized the songs as &quot;not particularly tuneful,&quot; but performed with &quot;Beatles fervour and Beatles conviction,&quot; praising the lyricism, opining that &quot;The words capture part of America today, a lot of its sickness and tragedy.&quot; In the US, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reviewer Arthur Schmidt wrote that &quot;The music is, for me, questionable, but I&#x27;ve always found their music questionable. It is nice enough, and I admit to liking it, but it exudes a sense of process, and it is slick, and nothing too much happens.&quot;

Later reviews were more positive. &quot;In just over 29 minutes, &quot;Bookends&quot; is stunning in its vision of a bewildered America in search of itself&quot;, said AllMusic writer Thom Jurek, who gave it five stars out of five. Pitchfork Media&#x27;s Stephen M. Deusner called &quot;Bookends&quot; the moment in which the duo &quot;were settling into themselves, losing their folk revival pretensions and emphasizing quirky production techniques to match their soaring vocals&quot;. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; called it the group&#x27;s &quot;most musically and conceptually daring album&quot;.

===Accolades===
&quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot; became the first rock and roll song to win Record of the Year at the 11th Annual Grammy Awards in 1969; it was also afforded the honor of Best Contemporary Pop Performance by a Duo or Group.

In 2000, &quot;Bookends&quot; was voted number 338 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.

==Legacy==
The album, alongside &quot;The Graduate&quot; soundtrack, propelled Simon &amp; Garfunkel to become the biggest rock duo in the world. Simon was approached by numerous film producers who wished him to write music for their films or license a track; he turned down Franco Zeffirelli, who was preparing to film &quot;Brother Sun, Sister Moon&quot;, and John Schlesinger, who likewise was readying to shoot &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot;. In addition to Hollywood proposals, producers from the Broadway show &quot;Jimmy Shine&quot; (starring Simon&#x27;s friend Dustin Hoffman, also the lead in &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot;) asked for two original songs and Simon declined. He eventually paired with Leonard Bernstein, with whom he collaborated for a short time on a sacred mass (he eventually withdrew from the project, &quot;finding it perhaps too far afield from his comfort zone&quot;).

Disc jockey and author Pete Fornatale writes that &quot;Bookends&quot; represents &quot;a once-in-a-career convergence of musical, personal, and societal forces that placed Simon &amp; Garfunkel squarely at the center of the cultural zeitgeist of the sixties&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; credited the record with striking a chord among lonely, adrift young adults near the end of the decade, writing that a lyric in &quot;A Hazy Shade of Winter&quot;—&quot;Time, time, time, see what’s become of me...&quot;—&quot;defined the moment for a generation on the edge of adulthood&quot;. Many viewed &quot;Bookends&quot; as the band&#x27;s most accomplished work at the time, a breakthrough in production and songwriting. &quot;&quot;Bookends&quot; was our first serious piece of work, I&#x27;d say&quot;, said Simon in a 1984 interview with &quot;Playboy&quot;.

In 2010, &quot;All gone to look for America&quot;—a reference to a line from the song &quot;America&quot;—began appearing spray-painted on vacant buildings and abandoned factories in the town of Saginaw, Michigan, which is mentioned in the song. A loose group of artists, who eventually became known as &quot;Paint Saginaw&quot;, began duplicating the phrase after the city population had dwindled vastly, noting that the song now encapsulated a sense of nostalgia for a bygone era among the city residents.

&quot;America&quot; was also featured in an eponymously-titled television advertisement for the presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders during the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries. The campaign sought permission to use it from Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel themselves, who both agreed. Garfunkel stated that he was a supporter of Sanders and his campaign, and that the usage of &quot;America&quot; did not take away from the song&#x27;s original premise.

&quot;Bookends&quot; was the last Simon &amp; Garfunkel album to be mixed in separate mono and stereo mixes, as manufacturing of mono LP&#x27;s alongside concurrent stereo issues was in the final stages of being discontinued in 1968. The mono mix was released as a promo issue to radio stations and given a very limited run for commercial sale. It was out-of-print very soon after release, and , it has yet to see a digital re-release.

<text>The Pirates of Penzance; or, The Slave of Duty is a comic opera in two acts, with music by Arthur Sullivan and libretto by W. S. Gilbert. Its official premiere was at the Fifth Avenue Theatre in New York City on 31 December 1879, where it was well received by both audiences and critics. Its London debut was on 3 April 1880, at the Opera Comique, where it ran for 363 performances.

The story concerns Frederic, who, having completed his 21st year, is released from his apprenticeship to a band of tender-hearted pirates. He meets the daughters of the incompetent Major-General Stanley, including Mabel, and the two young people fall instantly in love. Frederic soon learns, however, that he was born on 29 February, and so, technically, he has a birthday only once each leap year. His indenture specifies that he remain apprenticed to the pirates until his &quot;twenty-first birthday&quot;, meaning that he must serve for another 63 years. Bound by his own sense of duty to honour his bond with the pirates, Frederic&#x27;s only solace is that Mabel agrees to wait for him faithfully. The pirates&#x27; maid-of-all-work, Ruth, eventually reveals a fact that saves the day.

&quot;Pirates&quot; was the fifth Gilbert and Sullivan collaboration and introduced the much-parodied &quot;Major-General&#x27;s Song&quot;. The opera was performed for over a century by the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company in Britain until the copyrights expired and by many other opera companies and repertory companies worldwide. Modernized productions include Joseph Papp&#x27;s 1981 Broadway production, which ran for 787 performances, winning the Tony Award for Best Revival and the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Musical, and spawning many imitations and a 1983 film adaptation. &quot;Pirates&quot; remains popular today, taking its place along with &quot;The Mikado&quot; and &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; as one of the most frequently played Gilbert and Sullivan operas.

==Background==

&quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; was the only Gilbert and Sullivan opera to have its official premiere in the United States. At the time, American law offered no copyright protection to foreigners. After the pair&#x27;s previous opera, &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;, achieved success in London in 1878, approximately 150 American companies quickly mounted unauthorised productions that often took considerable liberties with the text and paid no royalties to the creators. Gilbert and Sullivan hoped to forestall further &quot;copyright piracy&quot; by mounting the first production of their next opera in America, before others could copy it, and by delaying publication of the score and libretto. They succeeded in keeping for themselves the direct profits of the first American production of &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; by opening the production themselves on Broadway, prior to the London production, and they also operated profitable US touring companies of &quot;Pirates&quot; and &quot;Pinafore&quot;. However, Gilbert, Sullivan, and their producer, Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte, failed in their efforts, over the next decade, to control the American performance copyrights to &quot;Pirates&quot; and their other operas.

Fiction and plays about pirates were ubiquitous in the 19th century. Walter Scott&#x27;s &quot;The Pirate&quot; (1822) and James Fenimore Cooper&#x27;s &quot;The Red Rover&quot; were key sources for the romanticised, dashing pirate image and the idea of repentant pirates. Both Gilbert and Sullivan had parodied these ideas early in their careers. Sullivan had written a comic opera, &quot;The Contrabandista&quot;, in 1867, about a hapless British tourist who is captured by bandits and forced to become their chief. Gilbert had written several comic works that involved pirates or bandits. In Gilbert&#x27;s 1876 opera &quot;Princess Toto&quot;, the title character is eager to be captured by a brigand chief. Gilbert had translated Jacques Offenbach&#x27;s operetta &quot;Les brigands&quot;, in 1871. As in &quot;Les brigands&quot;, &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; absurdly treats stealing as a professional career path, with apprentices and tools of the trade such as the crowbar and life preserver.

===Genesis===
While &quot;Pinafore&quot; was running strongly at the Opera Comique in London, Gilbert was eager to get started on his and Sullivan&#x27;s next opera, and he began working on the libretto in December 1878. He re-used several elements of his 1870 one-act piece, &quot;Our Island Home&quot;, which had introduced a pirate &quot;chief&quot;, Captain Bang. Bang was mistakenly apprenticed to a pirate band as a child by his deaf nursemaid. Also, Bang, like Frederic in &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;, had never seen a woman before and felt a keen sense of duty, as an apprenticed pirate, until the passage of his 21st birthday freed him from his articles of indenture. Bernard Shaw believed that Gilbert drew on ideas in &quot;Les brigands&quot; for his new libretto, including the businesslike bandits and the bumbling police. Gilbert and Sullivan also inserted into Act II an idea they first considered for a one-act opera parody in 1876 about burglars meeting police, while their conflict escapes the notice of the oblivious father of a large family of girls. As in &quot;Pinafore&quot;, &quot;there was a wordful self-descriptive set-piece for Stanley [&quot;The Major-General&#x27;s Song&quot;], introducing himself much as Sir Joseph Porter had done ... a lugubrious comic number for the Sergeant of Police ... a song of confession for Ruth, the successor [to] Little Buttercup&quot;, romantic material for Frederic and Mabel, and &quot;ensemble and chorus music in turn pretty, parodic and atmospheric.&quot;

Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte met by 24 April 1879 to make plans for a production of &quot;Pinafore&quot; and the new opera in America. Carte travelled to New York in the summer of 1879 and made arrangements with theatre manager John T. Ford to present, at the Fifth Avenue Theatre, the authorised productions. He then returned to London. Meanwhile, once &quot;Pinafore&quot; became a hit in London, the author, composer and producer had the financial resources to produce future shows themselves, and they executed a plan to free themselves from their financial backers in the &quot;Comedy Opera Company&quot;. Carte formed a new partnership with Gilbert and Sullivan to divide profits equally among themselves after the expenses of each of their shows. Sullivan wrote to a former producer, John Hollingshead of the Gaiety Theatre, saying: &quot;You once settled a precedent for me which may just at present be of great importance to me. I asked you for the band parts of the &quot;Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; ... and [you] said, &#x27;They are yours, as our run is over...&#x27; Now will you please let me have them, and the parts of &quot;Thespis&quot; also at once. I am detaining the parts of &quot;Pinafore&quot;, so that the directors shall not take them away from the Comique tomorrow, and I base my claim on the precedent &quot;you&quot; set.&quot; See Rees, p. 89. The Comedy Opera Company directors engaged another theatre to play a rival production of &quot;Pinafore&quot;, but they had no scenery. On 31 July, they sent a group of thugs to the Opera Comique to seize the scenery and props during the evening performance of &quot;Pinafore&quot;. See Ainger, p. 170 and Jacobs, pp. 124–125. Stagehands and cast members managed to ward off their backstage attackers and protect the scenery. The police arrived to restore order, and the show continued. See Stedman, pp. 170–171 and Gillan, Don. &quot;The Fracas at the Opera Comique&quot;, &quot;The Theatre&quot;, 1 September 1879, reprinted at the Stage Beauty website, accessed 6 May 2009. See also &quot;The Fracas at the Opera Comique&quot;, &quot;The Era&quot;, 10 August 1879, p. 5 and &quot;The Fracas at the Opera Comique&quot;, &quot;The Leeds Mercury&quot;, 13 August 1879, p. 8. The matter was eventually settled in court, where a judge ruled in Carte&#x27;s favour about two years later. See Ainger, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1879, Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte sailed to America with a company of singing actors, to play both &quot;Pinafore&quot; and the new opera, including J. H. Ryley as Sir Joseph, Blanche Roosevelt as Josephine, Alice Barnett as Little Buttercup, Furneaux Cook as Dick Deadeye, Hugh Talbot as Ralph Rackstraw and Jessie Bond as Cousin Hebe, some of whom had been in the &quot;Pinafore&quot; cast in London. To these, he added some American singers, including Signor Brocolini as Captain Corcoran. Alfred Cellier came to assist Sullivan, while his brother François Cellier remained in London to conduct &quot;Pinafore&quot; there. Gilbert and Sullivan cast talented actors who were not well-known stars and did not command high fees. They then tailored their operas to the particular abilities of these performers. The skill with which Gilbert and Sullivan used their performers had an effect on the audience: as critic Herman Klein wrote, &quot;we secretly marvelled at the naturalness and ease with which [the Gilbertian quips and absurdities] were said and done. For until then no living soul had seen upon the stage such weird, eccentric, yet intensely human beings ... [They] conjured into existence a hitherto unknown comic world of sheer delight.&quot; Gilbert acted as stage director for his own plays and operas. He sought naturalism in acting, which was unusual at the time, just as he strove for realistic visual elements. He deprecated self-conscious interaction with the audience and insisted on a style of portrayal in which the characters were never aware of their own absurdity but were coherent internal wholes. Sullivan conducted the music rehearsals.
Sullivan had sketched out the music for &quot;Pirates&quot; in England. When he arrived in New York, however, he found that he had left the sketches for Act I behind, and he had to reconstruct the first act from memory, or compose new numbers. Gilbert told a correspondent many years later that Sullivan was unable to recall his setting of the entrance of the women&#x27;s chorus, so they substituted the chorus &quot;Climbing over rocky mountain&quot; from their earlier opera, &quot;Thespis&quot;. Sullivan&#x27;s manuscript for &quot;Pirates&quot; contains pages removed from a &quot;Thespis&quot; score, with the vocal parts of this chorus altered from their original arrangement as a four-part chorus. Some scholars (e.g. Tillett and Spencer, 2000) have suggested that Gilbert and Sullivan had planned all along to re-use &quot;Climbing over rocky mountain,&quot; and perhaps other parts of &quot;Thespis&quot;. They argue that Sullivan&#x27;s having brought the unpublished &quot;Thespis&quot; score to New York, when there were no plans to revive &quot;Thespis&quot;, might not have been accidental. In any case, on 10 December 1879, Sullivan wrote a letter to his mother about the new opera, upon which he was hard at work in New York. &quot;I think it will be a great success, for it is exquisitely funny, and the music is strikingly tuneful and catching.&quot; As was his usual practice in his operas, Sullivan left the overture for the last moment, often sketching it out and entrusting completion of &quot;the details&quot; to an assistant, in this case the company&#x27;s music director, Alfred Cellier.

&quot;Pinafore&quot; opened in New York on 1 December 1879 and ran for the rest of December. After a reasonably strong first week, audiences quickly fell off, since most New Yorkers had already seen local productions of &quot;Pinafore&quot;. In the meantime, Gilbert and Sullivan raced to complete and rehearse &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;. The work&#x27;s title is a multi-layered joke. On the one hand, Penzance was a docile seaside resort in 1879, and not the place where one would expect to encounter pirates. On the other hand, the title was also a jab at the theatrical &quot;pirates&quot; who had staged unlicensed productions of &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; in America. To secure the British copyright, a D&#x27;Oyly Carte touring company gave a perfunctory copyright performance of &quot;Pirates&quot; the afternoon before the New York premiere, at the Royal Bijou Theatre in Paignton, Devon, organised by Helen Lenoir, who would later marry Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte. The cast, which was performing &quot;Pinafore&quot; in the evenings in Torquay, received some of the music for &quot;Pirates&quot; only two days beforehand. Having had only one rehearsal, they travelled to nearby Paignton for the matinee, where they read their parts from scripts carried onto the stage, making do with whatever costumes they had on hand.

===Original production and aftermath===

&quot;Pirates&quot; premiered on 31 December 1879 in New York and was an immediate hit. On 2 January 1880, Sullivan wrote, in another letter to his mother from New York, &quot;The libretto is ingenious, clever, wonderfully funny in parts, and sometimes brilliant in dialogue – beautifully written for music, as is all Gilbert does. ... The music is infinitely superior in every way to the &quot;Pinafore&quot; – &#x27;tunier&#x27; and more developed, of a higher class altogether. I think that in time it will be very popular.&quot; Shortly thereafter, Carte sent three touring companies around the United States East Coast and Midwest, playing &quot;Pirates&quot; and &quot;Pinafore&quot;. Sullivan&#x27;s prediction was correct. After a strong run in New York and several American tours, &quot;Pirates&quot; opened in London on 3 April 1880, running for 363 performances there. It remains one of the most popular G&amp;S works. The London sets were designed by John O&#x27;Connor.

The critics&#x27; notices were generally excellent in both New York and London. The character of Major-General Stanley was widely taken to be a caricature of the popular general Sir Garnet Wolseley. The biographer Michael Ainger, however, doubts that Gilbert intended a caricature of Wolseley, identifying instead General Henry Turner, uncle of Gilbert&#x27;s wife, as the pattern for the &quot;modern Major-General&quot;. Gilbert disliked Turner, who, unlike the progressive Wolseley, was of the old school of officers. Nevertheless, in the original London production, George Grossmith imitated Wolseley&#x27;s mannerisms and appearance, particularly his large moustache, and the audience recognised the allusion. Wolseley himself, according to his biographer, took no offence at the caricature and sometimes sang &quot;I am the very model of a modern Major-General&quot; for the private amusement of his family and friends.

==Synopsis==
=== Act I ===
On the coast of Cornwall, during Queen Victoria&#x27;s reign, Frederic celebrates the completion of his twenty-first year and the end of his apprenticeship to a gentlemanly band of pirates (&quot;Pour, oh pour the pirate sherry&quot;). The pirates&#x27; maid of all work, Ruth, appears and reveals that, as Frederic&#x27;s nursemaid long ago, she made a mistake &quot;through being hard of hearing&quot;: Mishearing Frederic&#x27;s father&#x27;s instructions, she apprenticed him to a pirate, instead of to a ship&#x27;s &quot;pilot&quot; (&quot;When Frederic was a little lad&quot;).

Frederic has never seen any woman other than Ruth, and he believes her to be beautiful. The pirates know better and suggest that Frederic take Ruth with him when he returns to civilisation. Frederic announces that, although it pains him, so strong is his sense of duty that, once free from his apprenticeship, he will be forced to devote himself to the pirates&#x27; extermination. He also points out that they are not successful pirates: since they are all orphans, they allow their prey to go free if they too are orphans. Frederic notes that word of this has got about, so captured ships&#x27; companies routinely claim to be orphans. Frederic invites the pirates to give up piracy and go with him, so that he need not destroy them, but the Pirate King says that, contrasted with respectability, piracy is comparatively honest (&quot;Oh! better far to live and die&quot;). The pirates depart, leaving Frederic and Ruth. Frederic sees a group of beautiful young girls approaching the pirate lair, and realises that Ruth misled him about her appearance (&quot;Oh false one! You have deceived me!&quot;). Sending Ruth away, Frederic hides before the girls arrive.
The girls burst exuberantly upon the secluded spot (&quot;Climbing over rocky mountain&quot;). Frederic reveals himself (&quot;Stop, ladies, pray!&quot;), startling them. He appeals to them to help him reform (&quot;Oh! is there not one maiden breast?&quot;). The girls are fascinated by him, but all reject him, except one: Mabel responds to his plea, chiding her sisters for their lack of charity (&quot;Oh sisters deaf to pity&#x27;s name for shame!&quot;). She offers Frederic her pity (&quot;Poor wand&#x27;ring one&quot;), and the two quickly fall in love. The other girls discuss whether to eavesdrop or to leave the new couple alone (&quot;What ought we to do?&quot;), deciding to &quot;talk about the weather,&quot; although they steal glances at the affectionate couple (&quot;How beautifully blue the sky&quot;).

Frederic warns the young ladies that his old associates will soon return (&quot;Stay, we must not lose our senses&quot;), but before they can flee, the pirates arrive and capture the girls, intending to marry them (&quot;Here&#x27;s a first rate opportunity&quot;). Mabel warns the pirates that the girls&#x27; father is a Major-General (&quot;Hold, monsters!&quot;), who soon arrives and introduces himself (&quot;I am the very model of a modern Major-General&quot;). He appeals to the pirates not to take his daughters, leaving him to face his old age alone. Having heard of the famous Pirates of Penzance, he pretends that he is an orphan to elicit their sympathy (&quot;Oh, men of dark and dismal fate&quot;). The soft-hearted pirates release the girls (&quot;Hail, Poetry!&quot;), making Major-General Stanley and his daughters honorary members of their band (&quot;Pray observe the magnanimity&quot;).

=== Act II ===
The Major-General sits in a ruined chapel on his estate, surrounded by his daughters. His conscience is tortured by the lie that he told the pirates, and the girls attempt to console him (&quot;Oh dry the glist&#x27;ning tear&quot;). The Sergeant of Police and his corps arrive to announce their readiness to arrest the pirates (&quot;When the foeman bares his steel&quot;). The girls loudly express their admiration of the police for facing likely slaughter by fierce and merciless foes. The police are unnerved by this and leave reluctantly.
Left alone, Frederic, who is to lead the police, reflects on his opportunity to atone for a life of piracy (&quot;Now for the pirates&#x27; lair&quot;), at which point he encounters Ruth and the Pirate King. They have realised that Frederic&#x27;s apprenticeship was worded so as to bind him to them until his twenty-first &quot;birthday&quot; – and, because that birthday happens to be on 29 February (in a leap year), it means that technically only five birthdays have passed (&quot;When you had left our pirate fold&quot;), and he will not reach his twenty-first birthday until he is in his eighties. Frederic is convinced by this logic and agrees to rejoin the pirates. He then sees it as his duty to inform the Pirate King of the Major-General&#x27;s deception. The outraged outlaw declares that the pirates&#x27; &quot;revenge will be swift and terrible&quot; (&quot;Away, away, my heart&#x27;s on fire&quot;).

Frederic meets Mabel (&quot;All is prepared&quot;), and she pleads with him to stay (&quot;Stay Frederic, stay&quot;), but he feels bound by his duty to the pirates until his 21st birthday – in 1940. They agree to be faithful to each other until then, though to Mabel &quot;It seems so long&quot; (&quot;Oh, here is love, and here is truth&quot;); Frederic departs. Mabel steels herself (&quot;No, I&#x27;ll be brave&quot;) and tells the police that they must go alone to face the pirates. The police muse that an outlaw might be just like any other man, and it is a shame to deprive him of &quot;that liberty which is so dear to all&quot; (&quot;When a felon&#x27;s not engaged in his employment&quot;). The police hide on hearing the approach of the pirates (&quot;A rollicking band of pirates we&quot;), who have stolen onto the estate, intending to take revenge for the Major-General&#x27;s lie (&quot;With cat-like tread&quot;).

Just then, Major-General Stanley appears, sleepless with guilt, and the pirates also hide (&quot;Hush, hush! not a word&quot;), while the Major-General listens to the soothing breeze (&quot;Sighing softly to the river&quot;). The girls come looking for him. The pirates leap out to seize them, and the Pirate King urges the captured Major-General to prepare for death. The police rush to their defence but are easily defeated. The Sergeant has one stratagem left: he demands that the pirates yield &quot;in Queen Victoria&#x27;s name&quot;; the pirates, overcome with loyalty to their Queen, do so. Ruth appears and reveals that the pirates are &quot;all noblemen who have gone wrong&quot;. The Major-General is impressed by this and all is forgiven. Frederic and Mabel are reunited, and the Major-General is happy to marry his daughters to the noble ex-pirates after all (&quot;Poor Wand&#x27;ring Ones&quot; (reprise)).

==Critical reception==
The notices from critics were generally excellent in both New York and London in 1880. In New York, the &quot;Herald&quot; and the &quot;Tribune&quot; both dedicated considerable space to their reviews. The &quot;Herald&quot; took the view that &quot;the new work is in every respect superior to the &quot;Pinafore&quot;, the text more humorous, the music more elegant and more elaborate.&quot; The &quot;Tribune&quot; called it &quot;a brilliant and complete success&quot;, commenting, &quot;The humor of the &quot;Pirates&quot; is richer, but more recondite. It demands a closer attention to the words [but] there are great stores of wit and drollery ... which will well repay exploration. ... The music is fresh, bright, elegant and merry, and much of it belongs to a higher order of art than the most popular of the tunes of &quot;Pinafore&quot;.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; also praised the work, writing, &quot;it would be impossible for a confirmed misanthrope to refrain from merriment over it&quot;, though the paper doubted if &quot;Pirates&quot; could repeat the prodigious success of &quot;Pinafore&quot;.

After the London premiere, the critical consensus, led by the theatrical newspaper &quot;The Era&quot;, was that the new work marked a distinct advance on Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s earlier works. &quot;The Pall Mall Gazette&quot; said, &quot;Of Mr. Sullivan&#x27;s music we must speak in detail on some other occasion. Suffice it for the present to say that in the new style which he has marked out for himself it is the best he has written.&quot; &quot;The Graphic&quot; wrote:

There were a few dissenting comments: &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; thought both author and composer had drawn on the works of their predecessors: &quot;Mr. Gilbert ... seems to have borrowed an idea from Sheridan&#x27;s &quot;The Critic&quot;; Mr. Sullivan&#x27;s music is sprightly, tuneful and full of &#x27;go&#x27;, although it is certainly lacking in originality.&quot; &quot;The Sporting Times&quot; noted, &quot;It doesn&#x27;t appear to have struck any of the critics yet that the central idea in &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; is taken from &quot;Our Island Home&quot;, which was played by the German Reeds some ten years ago.&quot; &quot;The Times&quot; thought Gilbert&#x27;s wit outran his dramatic invention, and Sullivan&#x27;s music for the new work was not quite as good as his score for &quot;The Sorcerer&quot;, which the &quot;Times&quot; critic called a masterpiece.

==Musical analysis==
The overture to &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; was composed by Sullivan and his musical assistant Alfred Cellier. It follows the pattern of most Savoy opera overtures: a lively opening (the melody of &quot;With cat-like tread&quot;), a slow middle section (&quot;Ah, leave me not to pine alone&quot;), and a concluding allegro in a compressed sonata form, in which the themes of &quot;How beautifully blue the sky&quot; and &quot;A paradox, a paradox&quot; are combined.

===Parody===
The score parodies several composers, most conspicuously Verdi. &quot;Come, friends, who plough the sea&quot; and &quot;You triumph now&quot; are burlesques of &quot;Il trovatore&quot;, and one of the best-known choral passages from the finale to Act I, &quot;Hail Poetry&quot;, is, according to the Sullivan scholar, Arthur Jacobs, a burlesque of the prayer scene, &quot;La Vergine degli Angeli&quot;, in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;La forza del destino&quot;. However, another musicologist, Nicholas Temperley, writes, &quot;The choral outburst &#x27;Hail, Poetry&#x27; in &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; would need very little alteration to turn it into a Mozart string quartet.&quot; Another well-known parody number from the work is the song for coloratura, &quot;Poor wand&#x27;ring one&quot;, which is generally thought to burlesque Gounod&#x27;s waltz-songs, though the music critic of &quot;The Times&quot; called it &quot;mock-Donizetti&quot;. In a scene in Act II, Mabel addresses the police, who chant their response in the manner of an Anglican church service.

Sullivan even managed to parody two composers at once. The critic Rodney Milnes describes the Major-General&#x27;s Act II song, &quot;Sighing softly to the river&quot;, &quot;as plainly inspired by – and indeed worthy of – Sullivan&#x27;s hero Schubert&quot;, and Amanda Holden speaks of the song&#x27;s &quot;Schubertian water-rippling accompaniment&quot;, but adds that it simultaneously spoofs Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Il trovatore&quot;, with the soloist unaware of a concealed male chorus singing behind him.

===Patter, counterpoint, and vocal writing===

Writing about patter songs, Shaw, in his capacity as a music critic, praised &quot;the time-honored lilt which Sir Arthur Sullivan, following the example of Mozart and Rossini, chose for the lists of accomplishments of the Major-General in &quot;The Pirates&quot; or the Colonel in &quot;Patience&quot;.&quot;

This opera contains two well-known examples of Sullivan&#x27;s characteristic combination of two seemingly disparate melodies. Jacobs suggests that Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;La damnation de Faust&quot;, a great favourite in Sullivan&#x27;s formative years, may have been the model for Sullivan&#x27;s trademark contrapuntal mingling of the rapid prattle of the women&#x27;s chorus in Act I (&quot;How beautifully blue the sky&quot;) in 2/4 time with the lovers&#x27; duet in waltz time. Jacobs writes that &quot;the whole number [shifts] with Schubertian ease from B to G and back again.&quot; In Act II, a double chorus combines the policemen&#x27;s dogged tune, &quot;When the foeman bares his steel&quot; and the soaring line for the women, &quot;Go, ye heroes, go to glory&quot;. In adapting the four-part chorus &quot;Climbing over rocky mountain&quot; from &quot;Thespis&quot; for re-use in &quot;Pirates&quot;, Sullivan took less trouble: he wrote only a single vocal line, suitable for soprano voices. Despite this, the number ends with another example of Sullivan&#x27;s counterpoint, with the chorus singing the second melody of the piece (&quot;Let us gaily tread the measure&quot;) while the orchestra plays the first (&quot;Climbing over rocky mountain&quot;).

Sullivan set a particular vocal challenge for the soprano who portrays Mabel. The Sullivan scholar Gervase Hughes wrote, &quot;Mabel ... &quot;must&quot; be a coloratura because of &#x27;Poor wand&#x27;ring one!&#x27;, yet &#x27;Dear father, why leave your bed&#x27; demands steady beauty of tone throughout the octave F to F, and &#x27;Ah, leave me not to pine&#x27; goes a third lower still.&quot; In &quot;The Music of Arthur Sullivan&quot; (1959), Hughes quoted four extracts from &quot;Pirates&quot;, saying that if hearing each out of context one might attribute it to Schubert, Mendelssohn, Gounod or Bizet respectively, &quot;yet on learning the truth one would kick oneself for not having recognised Sullivan&#x27;s touch in all four.&quot; Hughes concluded by quoting the introductory bars of &quot;When a felon&#x27;s not engaged in his employment&quot;, adding, &quot;There could never be any doubt as to who wrote &quot;that&quot;, and it is as English as our wonderful police themselves.&quot;

==Versions==

Because the work was premiered in three different places (the Paignton performance and the full productions in New York and London), there are more variations in the early libretto and score of &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; than in other Gilbert and Sullivan works. Songs sent from New York to the D&#x27;Oyly Carte touring company in England for the Paignton premiere were then altered or omitted during Broadway rehearsals. Gilbert and Sullivan trimmed the work for the London premiere, and Gilbert made further alterations up to and including the 1908 Savoy revival. For example, early versions depicted the Pirate King as the servant of the pirate band, and the words of the opening chorus were, &quot;Pour, O King, the pirate sherry&quot;. In the original New York production the revelation by Ruth that the pirates are &quot;all noblemen who have gone wrong&quot; prompted the following exchange (recalling a famous passage in &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;):

In the original London production, this exchange was shortened to the following:
Gilbert deleted the exchange in the 1900 revival, and the Chappell vocal score was revised accordingly. For the 1908 revival Gilbert had the pirates yielding &quot;in good King Edward&#x27;s name&quot;. Despite Helen Carte&#x27;s repeated urging, Gilbert did not prepare an authorised version of the libretti of the Savoy operas.

In its 1989 production, the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company restored one of the original versions of the finale, which finishes with a variation of &quot;I am the very model of a modern major-general&quot;, rather than with the customary reprise of &quot;Poor wand&#x27;ring one&quot;, but in later revivals, it reverted to the more familiar text.

==Subsequent production history==

&quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; has been one of Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s most popular comic operas. After its unique triple opening in 1879–80, it was revived in London at the Savoy Theatre in 1888 and in 1900, and for the Savoy&#x27;s repertory season of 1908–09. In the British provinces, the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company toured it almost continuously from 1880 to 1884, and again in 1888. It re-entered the D&#x27;Oyly Carte touring repertory in 1893 and was never again absent until the company&#x27;s closure in 1982. New costumes were designed by Percy Anderson in 1919 and George Sheringham in 1929 (who also executed a new Act I set). Peter Goffin created a new touring set in 1957.

In America, after the New York opening on New Year&#x27;s Eve, 1879, Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte launched four companies that covered the United States on tours that lasted through the following summer. Gilbert and Sullivan themselves trained each of the touring companies through January and early February 1880, and each company&#x27;s first performance – whether it was in Philadelphia, Newark, or Buffalo – was conducted by the composer. In Australia, its first authorised performance was on 19 March 1881 at the Theatre Royal, Sydney, produced by J. C. Williamson. There was still no international copyright law in 1880, and the first &quot;unauthorised&quot; New York production was given by the Boston Ideal Opera Company at Booth&#x27;s Theatre in September of that year. The opera premiered in a German translation by Richard Genée and Camillo Walzel (&quot;Die Piraten&quot;) in Austria at the Theater an der Wien on 1 March 1889, and in Düsseldorf, Germany, on 1 December 1936. The first non-D&#x27;Oyly Carte professional production in a country that had been subject to Gilbert&#x27;s copyright (other than Williamsons&#x27; authorised productions) was in Stratford, Ontario, Canada, in September 1961, as the copyright expired. In 1979, the Torbay branch of the Gilbert and Sullivan Society presented a centenary tribute to the world premiere performance of &quot;Pirates&quot; in Paignton, with a production at the Palace Avenue Theatre (situated a few metres from the former Bijou Theatre).

New York has seen over forty major revivals since the premiere. One of these, produced and directed by Winthrop Ames in 1926 at the Plymouth Theatre, ran for 128 performances and gained good notices. A brief 1952 Broadway staging starring Martyn Green, earned Lehman Engel a Tony Award as conductor. Repertory companies that have mounted &quot;Pirates&quot; numerous times Off-Broadway and on tour in the US have included the American Savoyards (1953–67), the Light Opera of Manhattan (1968–89) and the New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players (1976–present).

As discussed below, Joseph Papp&#x27;s 1980–83 &quot;Pirates&quot; ran for nearly two years each on Broadway and in the West End, boosting the opera&#x27;s popularity. Professional and amateur productions of the opera continue with frequency. For example, in 2004, there was a West End production at the Savoy Theatre, and the Chicago Lyric Opera and English National Opera each also staged the work. From 2006 to 2007 an Opera Australia production toured Australia starring Anthony Warlow as the Pirate King, and in 2007 New York City Opera mounted a new production. In 2013, Scottish Opera produced a British touring production co-produced by the trustees of the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company. Richard Suart played Major-General Stanley and Nicholas Sharratt played Frederic. 

A Broadway production titled &quot;Pirates! The Penzance Musical&quot; is set to run at the Todd Haimes Theatre, with previews from 4 April 2025, and an official opening on 24 April; it is expected to play through 22 June 2025. It is set to star David Hyde Pierce as Gilbert/Major General Stanley; Ramin Karimloo as the Pirate King, Jinkx Monsoon as Ruth, Nicholas Barasch as Frederic, Samantha Williams as Mabel and Preston Truman Boyd as Sullivan/Sergeant of Police. Rupert Holmes adapted the libretto with a New Orleans setting. New orchestrations with Caribbean and French Quarter influences are by Joseph Joubert and Daryl Waters, with Joubert serving as music director; dance arrangements are by John O&#x27;Neill. Scott Ellis is set to direct, with choreography by Warren Carlyle. Roundabout Theatre Company is producing. Designs are by David Rockwell (sets), Linda Cho (costumes), Donald Holder (lighting) and Mikaal Sulaiman (sound). A concert of this concept was staged in October 2022 by, and for the benefit of, Roundabout, at the same theatre, with the same creative team, starring Pierce and Karimloo, with Colton Ryan as Frederic.

==Joseph Papp&#x27;s &quot;Pirates&quot;==

In 1980, Joseph Papp and the Public Theater of New York City produced a new version of &quot;Pirates&quot;, directed by Wilford Leach and choreographed by Graciela Daniele, at the Delacorte Theatre in Central Park, as a Shakespeare in the Park summer event. Musical direction and arrangements were by William Elliott. The show played for 10 previews and 35 performances. It then transferred to Broadway, opening on 8 January 1981 for a run of 20 previews and 787 regular performances at the Uris and Minskoff Theatres, the longest run of any Gilbert and Sullivan production in history. This take on &quot;Pirates&quot; earned enthusiastic reviews and seven Tony Award nominations, winning three, including the award for Best Revival and for Leach as director. It was also nominated for eight Drama Desk Awards, winning five, including Outstanding Musical and director.

Compared with traditional productions of the opera, Papp&#x27;s &quot;Pirates&quot; featured a more swashbuckling Pirate King and Frederic, and a broader, more musical comedy style of singing and humour. It did not significantly change the libretto, but it used a new orchestration and arrangements that changed keys, added repeats, lengthened dance music and made other minor changes in the score. The &quot;Matter Patter&quot; trio from &quot;Ruddigore&quot; and &quot;Sorry her lot&quot; from &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;, two other Gilbert and Sullivan operas, were interpolated into the show. The production also restored Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s original New York ending, with a reprise of the Major-General&#x27;s song in the Act II finale. Linda Ronstadt starred as Mabel, Rex Smith as Frederic, Kevin Kline as the Pirate King, Patricia Routledge as Ruth (replaced by Estelle Parsons for the Broadway transfer), George Rose as the Major-General, and Tony Azito as the Sergeant of Police. Kline won a Tony Award for his performance. Smith won a Theatre World Award, and Kline and Azito won Drama Desk Awards. Notable replacements during the Broadway run included Karla DeVito, Maureen McGovern and Pam Dawber as Mabel; Robby Benson, Patrick Cassidy and Peter Noone as Frederic; Treat Williams, Gary Sandy, James Belushi and Wally Kurth as the Pirate King; David Garrison as the Sergeant; George S. Irving as the Major-General; and Kaye Ballard as Ruth. The Los Angeles cast of the production featured Barry Bostwick as the Pirate King, Jo Anne Worley as Ruth, Clive Revill as the Major-General, Dawber as Mabel, Paxton Whitehead as the Sergeant, Caroline Peyton as Edith and Andy Gibb as Frederic.

The production opened at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, London, on 26 May 1982, to generally warm reviews, for a run of 601 performances, earning an Olivier Award nomination as Outstanding Musical and another for Tim Curry as the Pirate King. Among the cast were George Cole and Ronald Fraser as the Major-General; Pamela Stephenson as Mabel; Michael Praed and Peter Noone as Frederic; Curry, Timothy Bentinck, Oliver Tobias and Paul Nicholas as the Pirate King; Chris Langham as the Sergeant; Annie Ross as Ruth; Bonnie Langford as Kate; and Louise Gold as Isabel. The Australian production opened in Melbourne in January 1984, opening the new Victorian Arts Centre, directed by John Feraro. It starred Jon English as the Pirate King, Simon Gallaher as Frederic, June Bronhill as Ruth, David Atkins as the Sergeant and Marina Prior as Mabel. The six-week limited season was followed by an Australian national tour from 1984 to 1986 and another tour with same cast in the mid-1990s. In 1985, Papp&#x27;s &quot;Pirates&quot; opened the new Queensland Performing Arts Centre in Brisbane. Gallaher&#x27;s Essgee Entertainment version of &quot;Pirates&quot; was inspired by the Papp version. The Papp version also inspired foreign-language productions in Germany and elsewhere in Europe.
The Papp production was turned into a film in 1983, with the original Broadway principal cast reprising their roles, except that Angela Lansbury replaced Estelle Parsons as Ruth. The minor roles used British actors miming to their Broadway counterparts. The film has been shown occasionally on television. Another film based loosely on the opera and inspired by the success of the Papp version, &quot;The Pirate Movie&quot;, was released during the Broadway run.
The Papp production design has been widely imitated in later productions of &quot;Pirates&quot;, even where traditional orchestration and the standard score are used. Some modern productions are also influenced by the Disney film franchise &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot;, combining aspects of the Papp production with the Disney design concepts. Not all of these revivals have generated the same enthusiasm as Papp&#x27;s 1980s productions: a 1999 UK touring production received this critique: &quot;No doubt when Papp first staged this show in New York and London it had some quality of cheek or chutzpah or pizzazz or irony or something that accounted for its success. But all that&#x27;s left now ... is a crass Broadway-style musical arrangement ... and the worst kind of smutty send-up of a historic piece of art.&quot;

==Recordings==
&quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; has been recorded many times, and the critical consensus is that it has fared well on record. The first complete recording of the score was in 1921, under the direction of Rupert D&#x27;Oyly Carte, but with established recording singers rather than D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company performers. In 1929, &quot;The Gramophone&quot; said of a new set with a mainly D&#x27;Oyly Carte cast, &quot;This new recording represents the high-water mark so far as Gilbert and Sullivan opera is concerned. In each of the previous Savoy albums there have been occasional lapses which prevented one from awarding them unqualified praise; but with the &quot;Pirates&quot; it is happily otherwise; from first to last, and in every bar, a simply delightful production.&quot; Of later recordings by the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company, the 1968 recording (with complete dialogue) is highly regarded: The online &quot;Gilbert and Sullivan Discography&quot; says, &quot;This recording is one of the best D&#x27;Oyly Carte sets of all time, and certainly the best &quot;Pirates&quot;&quot;, and the &quot;Penguin Guide to Opera on Compact Disc&quot; also recommends it. So too does the &quot;Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music&quot;, alongside the 1993 Mackerras recording. The opera critic Alan Blyth recommended the D&#x27;Oyly Carte recording of 1990: &quot;a performance full of the kind of life that can only come from the experience of stage performances&quot;. The online &quot;Discography&quot; site also mentions the 1981 Papp recording as &quot;excellent&quot;, despite its inauthentic 1980 re-orchestrations that &quot;changed some of the timbres so as to appeal to a rock-oriented public&quot;.

Of the available commercial videos, the &quot;Discography&quot; site considers the Brent Walker better than the Papp version. More recent professional productions have been recorded on video by the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival.

==Cultural impact==
===Major-General&#x27;s Song===
&quot;Pirates&quot; is one of the most frequently referenced works of Gilbert and Sullivan. The Major-General&#x27;s Song, in particular, is frequently parodied, pastiched and used in advertising. Parody versions have been used in political commentary as well as entertainment media. Its challenging patter has proved interesting to comedians; notable examples include Tom Lehrer&#x27;s song &quot;The Elements&quot; and David Hyde Pierce&#x27;s monologue, as host of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. In 2010, comedian Ron Butler released a YouTube pastiche of the song in character as President Obama which, as of September 2021, had garnered more than 1.9 million views.

Pastiche examples include the &quot;Animaniacs&quot; version, &quot;I am the very model of a cartoon individual&quot;, in the episode &quot;H.M.S. Yakko&quot;; the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio &quot;I am the very model of a Gallifreyan buccaneer&quot; in &quot;Doctor Who and the Pirates&quot;; the &quot;Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip&quot; version in the episode &quot;The Cold Open&quot; (2006), where the cast performs &quot;We&#x27;ll be the very model of a modern network TV show&quot;; and the &quot;Mass Effect 2&quot; video game version, where the character Mordin Solus sings: &quot;I am the very model of a scientist Salarian&quot;.

The song is often used in film and on television, unchanged in many instances, as a character&#x27;s audition piece, or seen in a &quot;school play&quot; scene. Examples include a &quot;VeggieTales&quot; episode entitled &quot;The Wonderful World of Auto-Tainment!&quot;; the &quot;Frasier&quot; episode &quot;Fathers and Sons&quot;; &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Deep Space Homer&quot;; and the &quot;Mad About You&quot; episode &quot;Moody Blues&quot;, where Paul directs a charity production of &quot;Penzance&quot; starring his father, Burt, as the Major-General. In &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; (season 3, episode 4) guest host, comedian Gilda Radner, sings the song with a talking carrot (Parodying the pilot/pirate confusion in &quot;Pirates&quot;, Radner had requested a talking &quot;parrot&quot;, but was misheard). In an episode of &quot;Home Improvement&quot;, Al Borland begins to sing the song when tricked into thinking he is in a soundproof booth. In the &quot;Babylon 5&quot; episode &quot;Atonement&quot;, Marcus Cole uses the song to drive Dr Stephen Franklin crazy on a long journey to Mars.

Examples of the use of the song in advertising include Martyn Green&#x27;s pastiche of the song listing all of the varieties of Campbell&#x27;s Soup and a 2011 Geico commercial in which a couple that wants to save money, but still listen to musicals, finds a roommate, dressed as the Major-General, who awkwardly begins the song while dancing on a coffee table. Gimbels department store had a campaign sung to the tune of the Major-General&#x27;s Song that began, &quot;We are the very model of a modern big department store.&quot; George Washington, in the number &quot;Right Hand Man&quot; from the 2015 musical &quot;Hamilton&quot; by Lin-Manuel Miranda, refers to himself with irony as &quot;The model of a modern major general&quot;, which he rhymes with &quot;men are all&quot; and &quot;pedestal&quot;. Miranda commented: &quot;I always felt like &#x27;mineral&#x27; wasn&#x27;t the best possible rhyme.&quot;

===Film and television===
Other film references to &quot;Pirates&quot; include &quot;Kate &amp; Leopold&quot;, where there are multiple references, including a scene where Leopold sings &quot;I Am The Very Model of A Modern Major-General&quot; while accompanying himself on the piano; and in &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;, Edward Lewis (Richard Gere) covers a social gaffe by prostitute Vivian Ward (Julia Roberts), who comments that the opera &quot;La traviata&quot; was so good that she almost &quot;peed [her] pants&quot;, by saying that she had said that she liked it better than &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;&quot;. In Walt Disney&#x27;s cartoon &quot;Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers&quot; (2004), there is a performance of &quot;Pirates&quot; that becomes the setting for the climactic battle between the Musketeers and Captain Pete. &quot;Pirates&quot; songs sung in the cartoon are &quot;With cat-like tread&quot;, &quot;Poor wand&#x27;ring one&quot;, &quot;Climbing over rocky mountain&quot; and the Major-General&#x27;s song. &quot;Poor wand&#x27;ring one&quot; was used in the movie &quot;An American Tail&quot;. The soundtrack of the 1992 film &quot;The Hand That Rocks the Cradle&quot; includes &quot;Poor Wand&#x27;ring One&quot; and &quot;Oh Dry the Glistening Tear&quot;. A nonsense pastiche of the Major-General&#x27;s song in the 2017 film &quot;Despicable Me 3&quot;, sung by Minions, was termed &quot;amusing&quot; and &quot;the film&#x27;s finest moment&quot;; it was uploaded to YouTube by Illumination Entertainment as a singalong challenge, which has garnered more than 19 million views as of 2023.

Television references, in addition to those mentioned above, included the series &quot;The West Wing&quot;, where &quot;Pirates&quot; and other Gilbert and Sullivan operas are mentioned in several episodes, especially by Deputy Communications Director, Sam Seaborn, who was recording secretary of his school&#x27;s Gilbert and Sullivan society. In &quot;Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip&quot;, a poster from &quot;Pirates&quot; hangs on Matt Albie&#x27;s office wall. Both TV series were created by Aaron Sorkin. In the pilot episode of the 2008 CTV series &quot;Flashpoint&quot;, a police officer and his partner sing the policeman&#x27;s song. In an &quot;Assy McGee&quot; episode entitled &quot;Pegfinger&quot;, Detective Sanchez&#x27;s wife is a member of a community theatre that performs the opera. In a 1986 episode of the animated television adaptation of &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; entitled &quot;A Producer&#x27;s Lot&quot;, several characters put on a production of &quot;Pirates&quot;. In a 2005 &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;Peter&#x27;s Got Woods&quot;, Brian Griffin sings &quot;Sighing Softly&quot;, with Peter Griffin&#x27;s assistance. In a 2012 episode, &quot;Killer Queen&quot;, Peter gives a garbled rendition of the Major-General&#x27;s Song. In the 2009 &quot;Criminal Minds&quot; episode &quot;The Slave of Duty&quot;, Hotch quotes &quot;Oh dry the glist&#x27;ning tear&quot;. In the 1992 episode &quot;The Understudy&quot; of &quot;Clarissa Explains it All&quot;, the title character is chosen to understudy Mabel in a school production of &quot;Pirates&quot; and is unprepared when she must go on; a scene from &quot;The Mikado&quot; is also heard.

===Other references===

Other notable instances of references to &quot;Pirates&quot; include a &quot;New York Times&quot; article on 29 February 1940, memorialising that Frederic was finally out of his indentures. Six years previously, the arms granted to the municipal borough of Penzance in 1934 contain a pirate dressed in Gilbert&#x27;s original costuming, and Penzance had a rugby team called the Penzance Pirates, which is now called the Cornish Pirates. In 1980, Isaac Asimov wrote a short story called &quot;The Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Mystery&quot; (later retitled &quot;The Year of the Action&quot;), concerning whether the action of &quot;Pirates&quot; took place on 1 March 1873, or 1 March 1877 (depending on whether Gilbert took into account the fact that 1900 was not a leap year). The plot of Laurie R. King&#x27;s 2011 novel &quot;Pirate King&quot; centers on a 1924 silent movie adaptation of &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;.

The music from the chorus of &quot;With cat-like tread&quot;, which begins &quot;Come, friends, who plough the sea,&quot; was used in the popular American song, &quot;Hail, Hail, the Gang&#x27;s All Here.&quot; &quot;With cat-like tread&quot; is also part of the soundtrack, along with other Gilbert and Sullivan songs, in the 1981 film, &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;, and it was pastiched in the &quot;HMS Yakko&quot; episode of &quot;Animaniacs&quot; in a song about surfing a whale. In the case &quot;Pierson v. Ray&quot;, which established the doctrine of qualified immunity for police officers, the United States Supreme Court held that &quot;[a] policeman&#x27;s lot is not so unhappy that he must choose between being charged with dereliction of duty if he does not arrest when he had probable cause, and being punished with damages if he does.&quot; State courts have cited the same song for other purposes: &quot;Where does this extraordinary situation leave the lower... Courts and State Courts in their required effort to apply the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States...? Like the policeman in Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;, their &#x27;lot is not a happy one.&#x27;&quot;

<doc id="46670" wikidata="Q41663" url="?curid=46670" title="Constantine VIII">
<text>Constantine VIII 
(, &quot;Kōnstantinos&quot;; 960 – 11/12 November 1028) was &quot;de jure&quot; Byzantine emperor from 962 until his death. He was the younger son of Emperor Romanos II and Empress Theophano. He was nominal co-emperor from 962, successively with his father; stepfather, Nikephoros II Phokas; uncle, John I Tzimiskes; and brother, Basil II. Basil&#x27;s death in 1025 left Constantine as the sole emperor. He occupied the throne for 66 years in total, making him &quot;de jure&quot; the longest-reigning amongst all Roman emperors since Augustus.

Constantine displayed a lifelong lack of interest in politics, statecraft and the military, and during his brief sole reign the government of the Byzantine Empire suffered from mismanagement and neglect. He had no sons and was instead succeeded by Romanos Argyros, husband of his daughter Zoe.

==Family==

Constantine was born in 960, two years after his brother Basil. Their parents were Romanos II, the sixth Byzantine emperor of the Macedonian dynasty, and his second wife Theophano, an innkeeper&#x27;s daughter described by contemporaries as ambitious and amoral. Aged eight, Constantine was engaged to a daughter of Emperor Boris II of Bulgaria but in the end, he married a Byzantine aristocrat, Helena, daughter of Alypius. Of their three daughters, Eudokia became a nun after contracting smallpox, Zoe was empress for 22 years, and Theodora reigned for 18 months as the last monarch of the Macedonian line.

==Life==
===Childhood===
Romanos died suddenly in 963. Although Constantine was only three years old, he had already been crowned co-emperor in the preceding year, probably on 30 March. The widowed Theophano installed herself as regent for her sons and stocked the imperial government with supporters, but she faced competition for power with Joseph Bringas, a former advisor of Romanos. Theophano allied with Nikephoros Phokas, a celebrated general and opponent of Bringas. In return for her hand, the childless Nikephoros gave his sacred pledge to protect her children and their interests. Three months after Romanos&#x27; death, supporters of Nikephoros ousted Bringas from power. Nikephoros was crowned emperor in the presence of his nominal co-emperors, Constantine and Basil. A month later he married their mother.

Six years later, Nikephoros was murdered at Theophano&#x27;s instigation and her lover and co-conspirator John Tzimiskes was acclaimed emperor. Fearing that the empress&#x27; many enemies would damage his political prospects, Tzimiskes turned against Theophano and sent her into exile. Constantine and Basil stayed in the capital and retained their status as co-emperors.

===Adulthood===
Tzimiskes died in January 976, when Constantine was sixteen years old. Basil and Constantine became the new heads of state; nominally the brothers were equals, but Basil devoted himself to the responsibilities of his office and emerged as the senior &quot;Basileus&quot;. Constantine had no comparable interest in state business, and never developed any. Apart from participating in a military campaign in 989, which ended without any combat, he occupied his years as Basil&#x27;s colleague with private interests.

In his youth Constantine was tall, graceful, and athletic, with an excellent speaking voice and a good grasp of rhetoric. He participated in wrestling competitions— which he brought back into fashion— and in the training and riding of horses. Alongside these active pursuits he was a gourmet and a gourmand, leading in later years to chronic gout which impaired his ability to walk.

===Emperor===
Basil II had an illustrious reign, pursuing both government reforms and a series of successful wars. He died childless on 15 December 1025 and Constantine, a sixty-five-year-old widower, became the sole emperor as Constantine VIII. During his long term as co-emperor, he had been content to enjoy the privileges of imperial status, without concerning himself with state affairs. Sole rulership did not fundamentally alter this desire &quot;to pass his life wallowing in extravagant pleasures&quot;.

The Byzantine aristocracy had been rigorously controlled by Basil II. By comparison, they judged Constantine to be &quot;[d]evoid of any semblance of moral fibre&quot;, and worked steadily to extract concessions from him. Unqualified men received senior government posts, and Basil&#x27;s land laws were dropped under pressure from the aristocracy of Anatolia. These interactions with Constantine were not without risk; when challenged, or led to suspect conspiracies, the emperor responded with impulsive cruelty. Condemned members of the elite suffered torture or were sentenced to blinding.
The start of the decline of the Byzantine Empire has been linked to Constantine&#x27;s accession to the throne. His reign has been described as &quot;an unmitigated disaster&quot;, &quot;a break up of the system&quot; and the cause of &quot;a collapse of the military power of the Empire&quot;.

He ruled for less than three years before his death, on 11 or 12 November 1028. On his deathbed and without a male heir, Constantine named as successor Constantine Dalessenos, Duke of Antioch, a senior aristocrat and member of one of the few powerful patrician families who had been unswervingly loyal to the Macedonian dynasty. Constantine Dalassenos was summoned from his estates in the Armeniac Theme, with the intention that he should certify his position as successor by marrying the emperor&#x27;s daughter Zoe. Before Dalassenos completed his journey to Constantinople, the situation had changed. The emperor&#x27;s advisors preferred a different candidate, Romanos Argyros, who showed promise of being a weak ruler whom they could control. Characteristically, Constantine acquiesced to this preference. Romanos was named as the new imperial heir, and compelled to divorce his wife and marry Zoe. The wedding took place on 12 November and Romanos was crowned four days later.

<text>The history of what is now Wales () begins with evidence of a Neanderthal presence from at least 230,000 years ago, while &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; arrived by about 31,000 BC. However, continuous habitation by modern humans dates from the period after the end of the last ice age around 9000 BC, and Wales has many remains from the Mesolithic, Neolithic, and Bronze Age. During the Iron Age, as in all of Britain south of the Firth of Forth, the culture had become Celtic, with a common Brittonic language. The Romans, who began their conquest of Britain in AD 43, first campaigned in what is now northeast Wales in 48 against the Deceangli, and gained total control of the region with their defeat of the Ordovices in 79. The Romans departed from Britain in the 5th century, opening the door for the Anglo-Saxon settlement. Thereafter, the culture began to splinter into a number of kingdoms. The Welsh people formed with English encroachment that effectively separated them from the other surviving Brittonic-speaking peoples in the early middle ages.

In the post-Roman period, a number of Welsh kingdoms formed in present-day Wales, including Gwynedd, Powys, Ceredigion, Dyfed, Brycheiniog, Ergyng, Morgannwg, and Gwent. While some rulers extended their control over other Welsh territories and into western England, none were able to unite Wales for long. Internecine struggles and external pressure from the English, and later the Norman conquerors of England, led to the Welsh kingdoms coming gradually under the sway of the English crown. In 1282, the death of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd led to the conquest of the Principality of Wales by King Edward I of England; since then, the heir apparent to the English monarch has borne the title &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;. The Welsh launched several revolts against English rule, the last significant one being that led by Owain Glyndŵr in the early 15th century. In the 16th century Henry VIII, himself of Welsh extraction as a great-grandson of Owen Tudor, passed the Laws in Wales Acts aiming to fully incorporate Wales into the Kingdom of England.

Wales became part of the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707 and then the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801. Yet, the Welsh retained their language and culture despite heavy English dominance. The publication of the extremely significant first complete Welsh translation of the Bible by William Morgan in 1588 greatly advanced the position of Welsh as a literary language. The 18th century saw the beginnings of two changes that would greatly affect Wales: the Welsh Methodist revival, which led the country to turn increasingly nonconformist in religion, and the Industrial Revolution. During the rise of the British Empire, 19th century Southeast Wales in particular experienced rapid industrialisation and a dramatic rise in population as a result of the explosion of the coal and iron industries. Wales played a full and willing role in World War One. The industries of the Empire in Wales declined in the 20th century with the end of the British Empire following the Second World War, while nationalist sentiment and interest in self-determination rose. The Labour Party replaced the Liberal Party as the dominant political force in the 1920s. Wales played a considerable role during World War Two, along with the rest of the United Kingdom and its allies, and its cities were bombed extensively during the Blitz. The nationalist party Plaid Cymru gained momentum from the 1960s. In a 1997 referendum, Welsh voters approved the devolution of governmental responsibility to a National Assembly for Wales which first met in 1999, and was renamed as the Senedd Cymru/Welsh Parliament in May 2020.

==Prehistoric era==

===Paleolithic===
The earliest known item of human remains discovered in modern-day Wales is a Neanderthal jawbone, found at the Bontnewydd Palaeolithic site in the valley of the River Elwy in North Wales; it dates from about 230,000 years before present (BP) in the Lower Palaeolithic period, and from then, there have been skeletal remains found of the Paleolithic Age man in multiple regions of Wales, including South Pembrokeshire and Gower. It is known that Britain was visited over a long period during interglacial periods, perhaps as far back as far as an interstadial period of the Mindel glaciation, some 300,000 years ago, but in the last Glacial Maximum, 26,000-20,000 BP, most of Wales was covered in an ice sheet. Despite this, Wales has been inhabited by modern humans for at least 29,000 years. The Red Lady of Paviland, a human skeleton dyed in red ochre, was discovered in 1823 in one of the Paviland limestone caves of the Gower Peninsula in Swansea, South Wales. Despite the name, the skeleton is that of a young man who lived about 33,000 BP at the end of the Upper Paleolithic Period (Old Stone Age). Paviland cave lay just to the south of the ice sheet and the sea level was lower, so the cave was inland at the time. It is considered to be the oldest known ceremonial burial in Western Europe. The skeleton was found along with jewellery made from ivory and seashells and a mammoth&#x27;s skull.

===Mesolithic and Neolithic===

Continuous human habitation dates from the end of the last ice age, between 12,000 and 10,000 years before present (BP), when Mesolithic (middle stone age) hunter-gatherers from Central Europe began to migrate to Great Britain. At that time, sea levels were much lower than today. Wales was free of glaciers by about 10,250 BP, the warmer climate allowing the area to become heavily wooded. The post-glacial rise in sea level separated Wales and Ireland, forming the Irish Sea. By 8,000 BP the British Peninsula had become an island. Following the last ice age, Wales became roughly the shape it is today by about 8000 BC and was inhabited by small numbers (a few hundred) of Mesolithic hunter-gatherers. These people lived in caves and wood-contructed houses, the latter of which have not stood the test of time. The earliest farming communities are now believed to date from about 4000 BC, marking the beginning of the Neolithic period. This period saw the construction of many chambered tombs, particularly dolmens or &quot;cromlechs&quot;. The most notable examples of megalithic tombs include Bryn Celli Ddu and Barclodiad y Gawres on Anglesey, Pentre Ifan in Pembrokeshire, and Tinkinswood Burial Chamber in the Vale of Glamorgan. By the beginning of the Neolithic () sea levels in the Bristol Channel were still about lower than today. The historian John Davies theorised that the story of Cantre&#x27;r Gwaelod&#x27;s drowning and tales in the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;, of the waters between Wales and Ireland being narrower and shallower, may be distant folk memories of this time.

Neolithic (new stone age) colonists integrated with the indigenous people, gradually changing their lifestyles from a nomadic life of hunting and gathering, to become settled farmers about 6,000 BP – the Neolithic Revolution. They cleared the forests to establish pasture and to cultivate the land, developed new technologies such as ceramics and textile production, and built cromlechs such as Pentre Ifan, Bryn Celli Ddu, and Parc Cwm long cairn between about 5,800 BP and 5,500 BP.

===Bronze Age===
Metal tools first appeared in Wales about 2500 BC, initially copper followed by bronze. The climate during the Early Bronze Age (c. 5000–1400 BC) is thought to have been warmer than at present, as there are many remains from this period in what are now bleak uplands. The Late Bronze Age (c. 1400–750 BC) saw the development of more advanced bronze implements. Much of the copper for the production of bronze probably came from the copper mine on the Great Orme, where prehistoric mining on a very large scale dates largely from the middle Bronze Age. Radiocarbon dating has shown the earliest hillforts in what would become Wales to have been constructed during this period. Historian John Davies theorises that a worsening climate after around 1250 BC (lower temperatures and heavier rainfall) required more productive land to be defended.

Over the centuries following their initial settlement, the Neolithic population assimilated immigrants and adopted ideas from Bronze Age and Iron Age Celtic cultures. Some historians, such as John T. Koch, consider Wales in the Late Bronze Age as part of a maritime trading-networked culture that included other Celtic nations. This &quot;Atlantic-Celtic&quot; view is opposed by others who hold that the Celtic languages derive their origins from the more easterly Hallstatt culture.

===Iron Age===

The earliest iron implement found in Wales is a sword from Llyn Fawr which overlooks the head of the Vale of Neath, which is thought to date to about 600 BC. Hillforts continued to be built during the British Iron Age. Nearly 600 hillforts are in Wales, over 20% of those found in Britain, examples being Pen Dinas near Aberystwyth and Tre&#x27;r Ceiri on the Llŷn peninsula. A particularly significant find from this period was made in 1943 at Llyn Cerrig Bach on Anglesey when the ground was being prepared for the construction of a Royal Air Force base. The cache included weapons, shields, chariots along with their fittings and harnesses, and slave chains and tools. Many had been deliberately broken and seem to have been votive offerings.

A tendency to see the creation of hillforts as evidence of a Celtic invasion that also brought a Celtic language to the Britain has been dealt a blow by recognition that the earliest forts predate the arrival of Iron Age Celtic culture by hundreds of years. The present tendency is to reject the hypothesis of mass invasion in favour of more sporadic migration and a cultural spread of language and ideas, a &quot;culminative Celticity&quot;. Then, with the coming of the Celts, there was an agricultural improvement of farming in Britain. This is evident with the then new use of the iron ploughshare, a type of Plough.

====Iron Age Celts====
During the late Bronze Age or early Iron Age in Celtic Britain () is when modern-day Wales was split into 4 regional tribes. They were, the Ordovices (Mid Wales to North West Wales), the Deceangli (North East Wales, North Wales), the Silures (South East Wales, Mid Wales) and the Demetae (South West Wales). A second wave () of migration of Celtic tribes from Eastern Europe emerged in Britain and established stone hut circle roundhouse settlements within or near the previously inhabited hillfort enclosures. Hut circles were used as dwellings until after the end of Roman rule in Britain. During the Roman occupation, another Celtic Briton tribe in modern-day Wales was identified as the Gangani (Llŷn Peninsula, North West Wales), they were a tribe with connections to Ireland.

The Roman conquest of Wales began in AD 48 and took 30 years to complete; the occupation lasted over 300 years. The most famous resistance was led by Caratacus of the Catuvellauni tribe (modern day Essex), who were defeated by the Romans. Caratacus then fled to the Silures (of present day Monmouthshire) and the Ordovices (of North Wales) and led them in a war against the Romans. His forces were eventually defeated and Caratacus was handed over to the Romans. He was taken to Rome and gave a speech, impressing the Roman emperor to the extent that he was pardoned and allowed to live peacefully in Rome.

The Roman conquest was completed in 78, with Roman rule lasting until 383. Roman rule in Wales was a military occupation, save for the southern coastal region of South Wales east of the Gower Peninsula, where there is a legacy of Romanisation. The only town in Wales founded by the Romans, Caerwent, is located in South Wales. Both Caerwent and Carmarthen, also in southern Wales, would become Roman &quot;civitates&quot;.
By AD 47, Rome had invaded and conquered all of southernmost and southeastern Britain under the first Roman governor of Britain. As part of the Roman conquest of Britain, a series of campaigns to conquer Wales was launched by his successor in 48 and would continue intermittently under successive governors until the conquest was completed in 78. It is these campaigns of conquest that are the most widely known feature of Wales during the Roman era due to the spirited but unsuccessful defence of their homelands by two native tribes, the Silures and the Ordovices.

The Demetae of southwestern Wales seem to have quickly made their peace with the Romans, as there is no indication of war with Rome, and their homeland was not heavily planted with forts nor overlaid with roads. The Demetae would be the only Welsh tribe to emerge from Roman rule with their homeland and tribal name intact.

Wales was a rich source of mineral wealth, and the Romans used their engineering technology to extract large amounts of gold, copper, and lead, as well as modest amounts of some other metals such as zinc and silver. When the mines were no longer practical or profitable, they were abandoned. Roman economic development was concentrated in southeastern Britain, with no significant industries located in Wales. This was largely a matter of circumstance, as Wales had none of the needed materials in suitable combination, and the forested, mountainous countryside was not amenable to development. Latin became the official language of Wales, though the people continued to speak in Brythonic. While Romanisation was far from complete, the upper classes came to consider themselves Roman, particularly after the ruling of 212 that granted Roman citizenship to all free men throughout the Empire. Further Roman influence came through the spread of Christianity, which gained many followers when Christians were allowed to worship freely; state persecution ceased in the 4th century, as a result of Constantine the Great issuing an edict of toleration in 313.

Early historians, including the 6th-century cleric Gildas, have noted 383 as a significant point in Welsh history. In that year, the Roman general Magnus Maximus stripped Britain of troops to launch a successful bid for imperial power, continuing to rule Britain from Gaul as emperor from 383 to 388, and transferring power to local leaders. Subsequent medieval Welsh lore developed a series of legends around Macsen Wledig, a literary and mythical figure derived from Magnus Maximus. Several medieval Welsh dynasties claimed that they were descended from Macsen, thereby linking their origins to the legitimacy and prestige of a Roman past. Thus, the earliest Welsh genealogies cite Maximus as the founder of several royal dynasties, and as the father of the Welsh nation. He is given as the ancestor of a Welsh king on the Pillar of Eliseg in the 9th century, erected nearly 500 years after he left Britain, and he appears in lists of the Fifteen Tribes of Wales. Later Welsh genealogies, medieval poetry, for example the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;, and chronicles such as the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; and &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot;, used myths and legends to give roles in Welsh history to historical and quasi-historical figures from the Roman and Sub-Roman periods. Aside from Macsen Wledig, other such figures include St Helena, the Emperor Constantine and Coel Hen.

== Early Middle Ages: 383–1066 ==


The 400-year period following the collapse of Roman rule is the most difficult to interpret in the history of Wales. When the Roman garrison of Britain was withdrawn in 410, the various British states were left self-governing. Evidence for a continuing Roman influence after the departure of the Roman legions is provided by an inscribed stone from Gwynedd dated between the late 5th and mid-6th centuries commemorating a certain Cantiorix who was described as a citizen (&quot;cives&quot;) of Gwynedd and a cousin of Maglos the magistrate (&quot;magistratus&quot;). There was considerable Irish colonisation in Dyfed, where there are many stones with ogham inscriptions. Wales had become Christian under the Romans, and the Age of the Saints (approximately 500–700) was marked by the establishment of monastic settlements throughout the country, by religious leaders such as Saint David, Illtud and Saint Teilo.


One of the reasons for the Roman withdrawal was the pressure put upon the empire&#x27;s military resources by the incursion of barbarian tribes from the east. These tribes, including the Angles and Saxons, gradually took control of eastern and southern Britain. After the Roman departure in AD 410, much of the lowlands of Britain to the east and south-east was overrun by various Germanic peoples, commonly known as Anglo-Saxons. Some have theorized that the cultural dominance of the Anglo-Saxons was due to apartheid-like social conditions in which the Britons were at a disadvantage.

By AD 500 the land that would become Wales had divided into a number of kingdoms free from Anglo-Saxon rule. The kingdoms of Gwynedd, Powys, Dyfed, Caredigion, Morgannwg, the Ystrad Tywi, and Gwent emerged as independent Welsh successor states. The largest of these being Gwynedd in northwest Wales and Powys in the east. Gwynedd was the most powerful of these kingdoms in the 6th and 7th centuries, under rulers such as Maelgwn Gwynedd (died 547) and Cadwallon ap Cadfan (died 634/5) who in alliance with Penda of Mercia was able to lead his armies as far as the Kingdom of Northumbria and control it for a period. Following Cadwallon&#x27;s death in battle the following year, his successor Cadafael Cadomedd ap Cynfeddw also allied himself with Penda against Northumbria but thereafter Gwynedd, like the other Welsh kingdoms, was mainly engaged in defensive warfare against the growing power of Mercia.

Archaeological evidence, in the Low Countries and what was to become England, shows early Anglo-Saxon migration to Great Britain reversed between 500 and 550, which concurs with Frankish chronicles. John Davies notes this as consistent with a victory for the Celtic Britons at Badon Hill against the Saxons, which was attributed to Arthur by Nennius.

At the Battle of Chester in 616, the forces of Powys and other British kingdoms were defeated by the Northumbrians under Æthelfrith, with king Selyf ap Cynan among the dead. It has been suggested that this battle finally severed the land connection between Wales and the kingdoms of the Hen Ogledd (&quot;Old North&quot;), the Brittonic-speaking regions of what is now southern Scotland and northern England, including Rheged, Strathclyde, Elmet and Gododdin, where Old Welsh was also spoken. From the 8th century on, Wales was by far the largest of the three remnant Brittonic areas in Britain, the other two being the Hen Ogledd and Cornwall.

Having lost much of what is now the West Midlands to Mercia in the 6th and early 7th centuries, a resurgent late-7th-century Powys checked Mercian advances. Æthelbald of Mercia, looking to defend recently acquired lands, had built Wat&#x27;s Dyke. According to Davies, this had been with the agreement of king Elisedd ap Gwylog of Powys, as this boundary, extending north from the valley of the River Severn to the Dee estuary, gave him Oswestry. Another theory, after carbon dating placed the dyke&#x27;s existence 300 years earlier, is that it was built by the post-Roman rulers of Wroxeter. King Offa of Mercia seems to have continued this initiative when he created a larger earthwork, now known as Offa&#x27;s Dyke (). Davies wrote of Cyril Fox&#x27;s study of Offa&#x27;s Dyke: &quot;In the planning of it, there was a degree of consultation with the kings of Powys and Gwent. On the Long Mountain near Trelystan, the dyke veers to the east, leaving the fertile slopes in the hands of the Welsh; near Rhiwabon, it was designed to ensure that Cadell ap Brochwel retained possession of the Fortress of Penygadden.&quot; And, for Gwent, Offa had the dyke built &quot;on the eastern crest of the gorge, clearly with the intention of recognizing that the River Wye and its traffic belonged to the kingdom of Gwent.&quot; However, Fox&#x27;s interpretations of both the length and purpose of the Dyke have been questioned by more recent research.

The southern and eastern parts of Great Britain lost to English settlement became known in Welsh as (Modern Welsh ), which may have referred to the kingdom of Mercia originally and which came to refer to England as a whole. The Germanic tribes who now dominated these lands were invariably called , meaning &quot;Saxons&quot;. The Anglo-Saxons called the Romano-British , meaning &#x27;Romanised foreigner&#x27; or &#x27;stranger&#x27;. The Welsh continued to call themselves (Brythons or Britons) well into the Middle Ages, though the first written evidence of the use of and is found in a praise poem to (, by ) . In , believed to be written around 930–942, the words and are used as often as 15 times. However, from the Anglo-Saxon settlement onwards, the people gradually begin to adopt the name over .

From 800 onwards, a series of dynastic marriages led to &#x27;s ( 844–77) inheritance of and . His sons founded the three dynasties of for , for and for . &#x27;s grandson (r. 900–50) founded out of his maternal and paternal inheritances of and in 930, ousted the dynasty from and and then codified Welsh law in the 940s.

===Rise and fall Gwynedd: 401–1283===

Eventually, after the 5th century, Wales was unified and ruled again by the Brythonic Celtic tribes who inhabited the lands. The Kingdom of Gwynedd was established in North West Wales during the year 401 by Cunedda Wledig, a Roman soldier who hailed from Manaw Gododdin (Scotland) to pacify the invading fellow Celts from Ireland.

The rulers of Gwynedd would establish a Kingdom as descendants of the final Kings of Britain. During the age of Cadwaladr (last King of Britain, Prince of Gwynedd ), his family settled the lands of Southwest Anglesey as patrons of St Cadwaladr&#x27;s Church, Llangadwaladr, an inscription in Latin is still found in the Church today speaks of his grandfather (Cadfan ap Iago), &quot;the Wisest and Most Renowned of All Kings&quot;.

By the 700s, Powys as the easternmost of the major kingdoms of Wales came under the most pressure from the English in Cheshire, Shropshire and Herefordshire. This kingdom originally extended east into areas now in England, and its ancient capital, Pengwern, has been variously identified as modern Shrewsbury or a site north of Baschurch. These areas were lost to the kingdom of Mercia. The construction of the earthwork known as Offa&#x27;s Dyke (usually attributed to Offa of Mercia in the 8th century) may have marked an agreed border.

For a single man to rule the whole country during this period was rare. This is often ascribed to the inheritance system practised in Wales. All sons received an equal share of their father&#x27;s property (including illegitimate sons), resulting in the division of territories. However, the Welsh laws prescribe this system of division for land in general, not for kingdoms, where there is provision for an &quot;edling&quot; (or heir) to the kingdom to be chosen, usually by the king. Any son, legitimate or illegitimate, could be chosen as edling and there were frequently disappointed candidates prepared to challenge the chosen heir.

The King Rhodri Mawr later established a new dynasty () by constructing a royal palace at Aberffraw, it was named after the village it was located at, the &quot;House of Aberffraw&quot; on Anglesey, then in the Kingdom of Gwynedd. Rhodri was able to extend his rule to Powys and Ceredigion. On his death his realms were divided between his sons. Rhodri&#x27;s grandson, Hywel Dda (Hywel the Good), formed the kingdom of Deheubarth by joining smaller kingdoms in the southwest and had extended his rule to most of Wales by 942. He is traditionally associated with the codification of Welsh law at a council which he called at Whitland, the laws from then on usually being called the &quot;Laws of Hywel&quot;. Hywel followed a policy of peace with the English. On his death in 949 his sons were able to keep control of Deheubarth but lost Gwynedd to the traditional dynasty of this kingdom.

Wales was now coming under increasing attack by Vikings, particularly Danish raids in the period between 950 and 1000. According to the chronicle &quot;Brut y Tywysogion&quot;, Godfrey Haroldson carried off two thousand captives from Anglesey in 987, and the king of Gwynedd, Maredudd ab Owain is reported to have redeemed many of his subjects from slavery by paying the Danes a large ransom.

In 853, the Vikings raided Anglesey, but in 856, Rhodri Mawr defeated and killed their leader, Gorm. The Celtic Britons of Wales made peace with the Vikings and Anarawd ap Rhodri allied with the Norsemen occupying Northumbria to conquer the north. This alliance later broke down and Anarawd came to an agreement with Alfred, king of Wessex, with whom he fought against the west Welsh. According to , in 894, &quot;Anarawd came with the Angles and laid waste to Ceredigion and Ystrad Tywi.&quot;

Gruffydd ap Llywelyn was the only ruler to be able to unite the Welsh kingdoms under his rule. Originally king of Gwynedd, by 1055 he was ruler of almost all of Wales and had annexed parts of England around the border. However, he was defeated by Harold Godwinson in 1063 and killed by his own men. His territories were again divided into the traditional kingdoms. Llywelyn II (the last) became the first official Prince of Wales and inherited the lands gained by his father, Llywelyn the Great. He was appointed Prince by the English Crown in 1267. In 1282, he was ambushed and killed without a male heir. The execution of his brother Dafydd ap Gruffydd in 1283 on the orders of King Edward I of England effectively ended Welsh independence. The title of Prince of Wales was then used by the English monarchy as the heir to the English throne.

Gruffydd ap Llywelyn was the only ruler to unite all of Wales under his rule, described by one chronicler after his death as king of Wales. In 1055 Gruffydd ap Llywelyn killed his rival Gruffydd ap Rhydderch in battle and recaptured . Originally king of Gwynedd, by 1057 he was ruler of Wales and had annexed parts of England around the border. He ruled Wales with no internal battles. His territories were again divided into the traditional kingdoms. John Davies states that was &quot;the only Welsh king ever to rule over the entire territory of Wales... Thus, from about 1057 until his death in 1063, the whole of Wales recognised the kingship of . For about seven brief years, Wales was one, under one ruler, a feat with neither precedent nor successor.&quot; Owain Gwynedd (1100–1170) of the Aberffraw line was the first Welsh ruler to use the title (prince of the Welsh), a title of substance given his victory on the Berwyn range, according to Davies. During this time, between 1053 and 1063, Wales lacked any internal strife and was at peace.

== High Middle Ages: 1066–1283 ==


=== Norman invasion ===
Within four years of the Battle of Hastings (1066), England had been completely subjugated by the Normans. William I of England established a series of lordships, allocated to his most powerful warriors, along the Welsh border, their boundaries fixed only to the east (where they met other feudal properties inside England). Starting in the 1070s, these lords began conquering land in southern and eastern Wales, west of the River Wye. The frontier region, and any English-held lordships in Wales, became known as , the Welsh Marches, in which the Marcher lords were subject to neither English nor Welsh law. The extent of the March varied as the fortunes of the Marcher lords and the Welsh princes ebbed and flowed.

At the time of the Norman conquest of England in 1066, the dominant ruler in Wales was Bleddyn ap Cynfyn, who was king of Gwynedd and Powys. The initial Norman successes were in the south, where William Fitz Osbern overran Gwent before 1070. By 1074, the forces of the Earl of Shrewsbury were ravaging Deheubarth.

The killing of Bleddyn ap Cynfyn in 1075 led to civil war and gave the Normans an opportunity to seize lands in North Wales. In 1081 Gruffudd ap Cynan, who had just won the throne of Gwynedd from Trahaearn ap Caradog at the Battle of Mynydd Carn was enticed to a meeting with the Earl of Chester and Earl of Shrewsbury and promptly seized and imprisoned, leading to the seizure of much of Gwynedd by the Normans. In the south William the Conqueror advanced into Dyfed founding castles and mints at St David&#x27;s and Cardiff. Rhys ap Tewdwr of Deheubarth was killed in 1093 in Brycheiniog, and his kingdom was seized and divided between various Norman lordships. The Norman conquest of Wales appeared virtually complete.In 1094, however, there was a general Welsh revolt against Norman rule, and gradually territories were won back. Gruffudd ap Cynan was eventually able to build a strong kingdom in Gwynedd. His son, Owain Gwynedd, allied with Gruffydd ap Rhys of Deheubarth won a crushing victory over the Normans at the Battle of Crug Mawr in 1136 and annexed Ceredigion. Owain followed his father on the throne of Gwynedd the following year and ruled until his death in 1170. He was able to profit from disunity in England, where King Stephen and Empress Matilda were engaged in a struggle for the throne, to extend the borders of Gwynedd further east than ever before.

Powys also had a strong ruler at this time in Madog ap Maredudd, but when his death in 1160 was quickly followed by the death of his heir, Llywelyn ap Madog, Powys was split into two parts and never subsequently reunited. In the south, Gruffydd ap Rhys was killed in 1137, but his four sons, who all ruled Deheubarth in turn, were eventually able to win back most of their grandfather&#x27;s kingdom from the Normans. The youngest of the four, Rhys ap Gruffydd (Lord Rhys) ruled from 1155 to 1197. In 1171 Rhys met King Henry II and came to an agreement with him whereby Rhys had to pay a tribute but was confirmed in all his conquests and was later named Justiciar of South Wales. Rhys held a festival of poetry and song at his court at Cardigan over Christmas 1176 which is generally regarded as the first recorded Eisteddfod. Owain Gwynedd&#x27;s death led to the splitting of Gwynedd between his sons, while Rhys made Deheubarth dominant in Wales for a time.

=== Dominance of Gwynedd and Edwardian conquest: 1216–1283 ===

Out of the power struggle in Gwynedd eventually arose one of the greatest of Welsh leaders, &#x27;s grandson, Llywelyn ab Iorwerth, also known as Llywelyn Fawr (the Great). Llywelyn ab Iorwerth was sole ruler of Gwynedd by 1200 and by his death in 1240 was effectively ruler of much of Wales. Llywelyn made his &#x27;capital&#x27; and headquarters at Abergwyngregyn on the north coast, overlooking the Menai Strait. In 1200 he became King of Gwynedd and agreed to a treaty of peace with King John of England, marrying his illegitimate daughter Joan. In 1208, Llywelyn claimed the Kingdom of Powys after the arrest of Gwenwynwyn ap Owain by King John, who disapproved of his attacks on Marcher Lords of the South. Friendship broke down and John invaded parts of Gwynedd in 1211, taking Llywelyn&#x27;s eldest son as hostage, and also forcing the surrender of territory in north-east Wales. Llywelyn&#x27;s son, Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, and other hostages were used as security by the king. However the Welsh and Scots joined English rebel Barons in forcing John to sign the Magna Carta of 1215. The document therefore holds specific Welsh provisions. These included the return of lands and liberties to Welshmen if those lands and liberties had been taken by English (and vice versa) without a law abiding judgement of their peers. Also the immediate return of Gruffydd and the other Welsh hostages. Llywelyn went on to gain dominance over all Wales the following year.

After the death of John in 1216, Llywelyn ab Iorwerth and the new King Henry III agreed to the treaty of Worcester in 1218, which confirmed Llywelyn&#x27;s right to Wales until his death, recognising him as Prince of Wales. Llywelyn ab Iorwerth received the fealty of other Welsh lords in 1216 at the council at , becoming in effect the first prince of Wales. His son Dafydd ap Llywelyn followed him as ruler of Gwynedd, but King Henry III of England would not allow him to inherit his father&#x27;s position elsewhere in Wales. War broke out in 1241 and then again in 1244, and the issue was still in the balance when Dafydd died suddenly at Abergwyngregyn, without leaving an heir in early 1246. Llywelyn the Great&#x27;s other son, Gruffudd had been killed trying to escape from the Tower of London in 1244. Gruffudd had left four sons, and a period of internal conflict between three of these ended in the rise to power of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd (also known as &quot;Llywelyn Ein Llyw Olaf&quot;; &quot;Llywelyn, Our Last Leader&quot;).

Llywelyn ab Iorwerth&#x27;s grandson secured the recognition of the title &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; from Henry III with the Treaty of Montgomery in 1267. This treaty confirmed Llywelyn in control, directly or indirectly, over a large part of Wales. A series of subsequent disputes, including the imprisonment of &#x27;s wife Eleanor, culminated in a declaration of war and the first invasion by King Edward I of England in November 1276. Realising his position was hopeless, Llywelyn II surrendered without battle. Edward negotiated a settlement, the Treaty of Aberconwy, which greatly restricted Llywelyn&#x27;s authority and exacted &#x27;s fealty to England in 1277.

War broke out again when Llywelyn&#x27;s brother Dafydd ap Gruffudd attacked Hawarden Castle on Palm Sunday 1282. On 11 December 1282, Llywelyn was lured into a meeting in Cilmeri in Builth Wells castle with unknown Marchers, where he was killed and his army subsequently destroyed. His brother Dafydd ap Gruffudd continued an increasingly forlorn resistance. He was captured in June 1283 and was hanged, drawn and quartered at Shrewsbury. Following the deaths of Llywelyn and Dafydd, Edward ended Welsh independence, introducing the royal ordinance of the Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284. The statute was a constitutional change annexing the Principality of Wales to the Realm of England, completing the Edwardian conquest.

==Late middle ages: 1283–1542==
The Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284 provided the constitutional basis for a post-conquest government of the Principality of North Wales from 1284 until 1535/36. It defined Wales as &quot;annexed and united&quot; to the English Crown, separate from England but under the same monarch. The king ruled directly in two areas: the Statute divided the north and delegated administrative duties to the Justice of Chester and Justiciar of North Wales, and further south in western Wales the King&#x27;s authority was delegated to the Justiciar of South Wales. The existing royal lordships of Montgomery and remained unchanged. Wales became, effectively, part of England, even though its people spoke a different language and had a different culture. English kings appointed a Council of Wales, sometimes presided over by the heir to the throne. This Council normally sat in Ludlow, now in England but at that time still part of the disputed border area in the Welsh Marches. Welsh literature, particularly poetry, continued to flourish however, with the lesser nobility now taking over from the princes as the patrons of the poets. Dafydd ap Gwilym, who flourished in the middle of the 14th century, is considered by many to be the greatest of the Welsh poets.

After passing the Statute of Rhuddlan, which restricted Welsh law, Edward constructed a series of castles to maintain his dominance: Beaumaris, , Harlech and . This ring of impressive stone castles assisted the domination of Wales, and he crowned his conquest by giving the title Prince of Wales to his son and heir in 1301. This son, the future Edward II, was born at in 1284. When he became the first English prince of Wales in 1301, this provided an income from northwest Wales known as the Principality of Wales. 

There were a number of rebellions including ones led by Madog ap Llywelyn – who styled himself Prince of Wales in the Penmachno Document – in 1294–1295 and by Llywelyn Bren, Lord of Senghenydd, in 1316–1318. In the 1370s the last representative in the male line of the ruling house of Gwynedd, Owain Lawgoch, twice planned an invasion of Wales with French support. The English government responded to the threat by sending an agent to assassinate Owain in Poitou in 1378.

The last uprising was led by , against Henry IV of England. In 1400, Owain Glyndŵr, then a Welsh nobleman, revolted. Owain inflicted a number of defeats on the English forces and for a few years controlled most of Wales. In 1404, was crowned prince of Wales in the presence of emissaries from France, Spain (Castille) and Scotland. went on to hold parliamentary assemblies at several Welsh towns, including a Welsh parliament () at . Some of Glyndŵr&#x27;s achievements included holding the first Welsh Parliament at Machynlleth and plans for two universities. The rebellion was eventually defeated by 1412. Having failed Glyndŵr went into hiding and nothing was known of him after 1413. Glyndŵr&#x27;s rebellion caused a great upsurge in Welsh identity and he was widely supported by Welsh people throughout the country.

As a response to Glyndŵr&#x27;s rebellion, the English parliament passed the Penal Laws against the Welsh in 1402. These prohibited the Welsh from carrying arms, from holding office and from dwelling in fortified towns. These prohibitions also applied to Englishmen who married Welsh women. These laws remained in force after the rebellion, although in practice they were gradually relaxed. The laws made the Welsh second-class citizens. With hopes of independence ended, there were no further wars or rebellions against English colonial rule and the laws remained on the statute books until 1624.

In the Wars of the Roses, which began in 1455, both sides made considerable use of Welsh troops. The main figures in Wales were the two Earls of Pembroke, the Yorkist William Herbert and the Lancastrian Jasper Tudor. A Council of Wales and the Marches was created to rule Wales, by the Lancastrian Henry VI for his son Edward of Westminster in 1457. The Council was created again in 1471 by Edward IV for his son Edward V.

In 1485 Jasper&#x27;s nephew, Henry Tudor, landed in Wales with a small force to launch his bid for the throne of England. Henry was of Welsh descent, counting princes such as Rhys ap Gruffydd among his ancestors, and his cause gained much support in Wales. Henry defeated King Richard III of England at the Battle of Bosworth Field with an army containing many Welsh soldiers and gained the throne as Henry VII of England. Henry VII again created a Council of Wales and the Marches for his son Prince Arthur. Henry Tudor (born in Wales in 1457) seized the throne of England from Richard III of England in 1485, uniting England and Wales under one royal house.

Welsh law was abolished and replaced by English law by the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 during the reign of Henry VII&#x27;s son, Henry VIII. These laws integrated Wales with England in legal terms. As well as abolishing the Welsh legal system, the Welsh language could not be used for any official role. The laws also, for the first time, defined the Wales–England border and allowed members representing constituencies in Wales to be elected to the English Parliament. They also abolished any legal distinction between the Welsh and the English, thereby effectively ending the Penal Code although this was not formally repealed. In the legal jurisdiction of England and Wales, Wales became unified with the kingdom of England; the &quot;Principality of Wales&quot; began to refer to the whole country, though it remained a &quot;principality&quot; only in a ceremonial sense. The Marcher lordships were abolished, and Wales began electing members of the Westminster parliament.

==Early modern period==

In 1536 Wales had around 278,000 inhabitants, which increased to around 360,000 by 1620. This was primarily due to rural settlement, where animal farming was central to the Welsh economy. Increase in trade and increased economic stability occurred due to the increased diversity of the Welsh economy and the passing of the Laws in Wales Acts. 

Following Henry VIII&#x27;s break with Rome and the Pope, Wales for the most part followed England in accepting Anglicanism, although a number of Catholics were active in attempting to counteract this and produced some of the earliest books printed in Welsh. In 1588, William Morgan produced the first complete translation of the Welsh Bible. Morgan&#x27;s Bible is one of the most significant books in the Welsh language, and its publication greatly increased the stature and scope of the Welsh language and literature.

Bishop Richard Davies and dissident Protestant cleric John Penry introduced Calvinist theology to Wales. Calvinism developed through the Puritan period, following the restoration of the monarchy under Charles II, and within Wales&#x27; Methodist movement. However, few copies of Calvin&#x27;s works were available before the mid-19th century. In 1567, Davies, William Salesbury, and Thomas Huet completed the first modern translation of the New Testament and the first translation of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; (). In 1588, William Morgan completed a translation of the whole Bible. These translations were as important to the survival of the Welsh language and had the effect of conferring status on Welsh as a liturgical language and vehicle for worship. This had a significant role in its continued use as a means of everyday communication and as a literary language down to the present day despite the pressure of English.
Wales was overwhelmingly Royalist in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms in the early 17th century, though there were some notable exceptions such as John Jones Maesygarnedd and the Puritan writer Morgan Llwyd. Wales was an important source of men for the armies of King Charles I of England, though no major battles took place in Wales. The Second English Civil War began when unpaid Parliamentarian troops in Pembrokeshire changed sides in early 1648. Colonel Thomas Horton defeated the Royalist rebels at the battle of St. Fagans in May and the rebel leaders surrendered to Cromwell on 11 July after the protracted two-month siege of Pembroke.

Education in Wales was at a very low ebb in this period, with the only education available being in English while the majority of the population spoke only Welsh. In 1731, Griffith Jones started circulating schools in Carmarthenshire, held in one location for about three months before moving (or &quot;circulating&quot;) to another location. The language of instruction in these schools was Welsh. By Griffith Jones&#x27; death, in 1761, it is estimated that up to 250,000 people had learnt to read in schools throughout Wales.The 18th century also saw the Welsh Methodist revival, led by Daniel Rowland, Howell Harris and William Williams Pantycelyn.

Nonconformity was a significant influence in Wales from the eighteenth to the twentieth centuries. The Welsh Methodist revival of the 18th century was one of the most significant religious and social movements in the history of Wales. The revival began within the Church of England in Wales and at the beginning remained as a group within it, but the Welsh revival differed from the Methodist revival in England in that its theology was Calvinist rather than Arminian. In the early 19th century the Welsh Methodists broke away from the Anglican church and established their own denomination, now the Presbyterian Church of Wales. This also led to the strengthening of other nonconformist denominations, and by the middle of the 19th century, Wales was largely Nonconformist in religion. This had considerable implications for the Welsh language as it was the main language of the nonconformist churches in Wales. The Sunday schools which became an important feature of Welsh life made a large part of the population literate in Welsh, which was important for the survival of the language as it was not taught in the schools. Welsh Methodists gradually built up their own networks, structures, and even meeting houses (or chapels), which led eventually to the secession of 1811 and the formal establishment of the Calvinistic Methodist Presbyterian Church of Wales in 1823. The Welsh Methodist revival also had an influence on the older nonconformist churches, or dissenters the Baptists and the Congregationalists who in turn also experienced growth and renewal. As a result, by the middle of the nineteenth century, Wales was predominantly a nonconformist country.

Prior to the Industrial Revolution in Wales, there were small-scale industries scattered throughout Wales. These ranged from those connected to agriculture, such as milling and the manufacture of woollen textiles, through to mining and quarrying. Agriculture remained the dominant source of wealth. The emerging industrial period saw the development of copper smelting in the Swansea area. With access to local coal deposits and a harbour that connected it with Cornwall&#x27;s copper mines in the south and the large copper deposits at Parys Mountain on Anglesey, Swansea developed into the world&#x27;s major centre for non-ferrous metal smelting in the 19th century. The second metal industry to expand in Wales was iron smelting, and iron manufacturing became prevalent in both the north and the south of the country. In the north, John Wilkinson&#x27;s Ironworks at Bersham was a major centre, while in the south, at Merthyr Tydfil, the ironworks of Dowlais, Cyfarthfa, Plymouth and Penydarren became the most significant hub of iron manufacture in Wales. By the 1820s, south Wales produced 40 per cent of all Britain&#x27;s pig iron.

In the late 18th century, slate quarrying began to expand rapidly, most notably in North Wales. The Penrhyn quarry, opened in 1770 by Richard Pennant, 1st Baron Penrhyn, was employing 15,000 men by the late 19th century, and along with Dinorwic quarry, it dominated the Welsh slate trade. Although slate quarrying has been described as &quot;the most Welsh of Welsh industries&quot;, it is coal mining which became the industry synonymous with Wales and its people. Initially, coal seams were exploited to provide energy for local metal industries but, with the opening of canal systems and later the railways, Welsh coal mining saw an explosion in demand. As the South Wales Coalfield was exploited, Cardiff, Swansea, Penarth and Barry grew as world exporters of coal. By its height in 1913, Wales was producing almost 60 million tonnes of coal.

The end of the 18th century saw the beginnings of the Industrial Revolution, and the presence of iron ore, limestone and large coal deposits in south-east Wales meant that this area soon saw the establishment of ironworks and coal mines, notably the Cyfarthfa Ironworks and the Dowlais Ironworks at Merthyr Tydfil.

== Modern history ==

=== 1800–1914 ===

The modern history of Wales starts in the 19th century when South Wales became heavily industrialised with ironworks; this, along with the spread of coal mining to the Cynon and Rhondda valleys from the 1840s, led to an increase in population. The social effects of industrialisation resulted in armed uprisings against the mainly English owners. Socialism developed in South Wales in the latter part of the century, accompanied by the increasing politicisation of religious Nonconformism. The first Labour MP, Keir Hardie, was elected as a junior member for the Welsh constituency of Merthyr Tydfil and Aberdare in 1900.
The population of Wales doubled to over one million between 1801 and 1851 and doubled again, reaching 2,421,000 by 1911. Most of the increase came in the coal mining districts especially Glamorganshire. Part of this increase can be attributed to the demographic transition seen in most industrialising countries during the Industrial Revolution, as death rates dropped and birth rates remained steady. However, there was also a large-scale migration of people into Wales during the industrial revolution. The English were the most numerous group, but there were also considerable numbers of Irish and smaller numbers of Italians, migrating to South Wales, as well as Russian and Polish Jews.

The first decade of the 20th century was the period of the coal boom in South Wales when population growth exceeded 20 per cent. Demographic changes affected the language frontier; the proportion of Welsh speakers in the Rhondda valley fell from 64 per cent in 1901 to 55 per cent ten years later, and similar trends were evident elsewhere in South Wales.

The 1904–1905 Welsh Revival was the largest full-scale Christian revival of Wales of the 20th century. It is believed that at least 100,000 people became Christians during the 1904–1905 revival, but despite this it did not put a stop to the gradual decline of Christianity in Wales, only holding it back slightly.

Historian Kenneth O. Morgan described Wales on the eve of the First World War as a &quot;relatively placid, self-confident and successful nation&quot;. The output from the coalfields continued to increase, with the Rhondda Valley recording a peak of 9.6 million tons of coal extracted in 1913. The First World War (1914–1918) saw a total of 272,924 Welshmen under arms, representing 21.5 per cent of the male population. Of these, roughly 35,000 were killed, with particularly heavy losses of Welsh forces at Mametz Wood on the Somme and the Battle of Passchendaele.

Kenneth O. Morgan argues that the 1850-1914 era:

=== 1914–1945 ===

The world wars and interwar period were hard times for Wales, in terms of the faltering economy of antiwar losses. Men eagerly volunteered for war service. The First World War and its aftermath had severe impact on Wales in terms of economic impact as well as war-time casualties. The result was significant social deprivation.

The first quarter of the 20th century also saw a shift in the political landscape of Wales. Since 1865, the Liberal Party had held a parliamentary majority in Wales and, following the general election of 1906, only one non-Liberal Member of Parliament, Keir Hardie of Merthyr Tydfil, represented a Welsh constituency at Westminster. Yet by 1906, industrial dissension and political militancy had begun to undermine Liberal consensus in the southern coalfields. In 1916, David Lloyd George became the first and only Welshman to become Prime Minister of Britain. In December 1918, Lloyd George was re-elected as the head of a Conservative-dominated coalition government, and his poor handling of the 1919 coal miners&#x27; strike was a key factor in destroying support for the Liberal party in south Wales. The industrial workers of Wales began shifting towards the Labour Party. When in 1908 the Miners&#x27; Federation of Great Britain became affiliated to the Labour Party, the four Labour candidates sponsored by miners were all elected as MPs. By 1922, half the Welsh seats at Westminster were held by Labour politicians—the start of a Labour dominance of Welsh politics that continued into the 21st century. The Labour Party replaced the Liberals as the dominant party in Wales, particularly in the industrial valleys of South Wales. Plaid Cymru was formed in 1925, but initially, its growth was slow and it gained few votes at parliamentary elections. Plaid Cymru sought sufficient autonomy or independence from the rest of the UK to ensure the survival of Welsh identity.

After economic growth in the first two decades of the 20th century, Wales&#x27;s staple industries endured a prolonged slump from the early 1920s to the late 1930s, leading to widespread unemployment and poverty. For the first time in centuries, the population of Wales went into decline; unemployment reduced only with the production demands of the Second World War. The war saw Welsh servicemen and women fight in all major theatres, with some 15,000 of them killed. Bombing raids brought high loss of life as the German Air Force targeted the docks at Swansea, Cardiff and Pembroke. After 1943, 10 per cent of Welsh conscripts aged 18 were sent to work in the coal mines, where there were labour shortages; they became known as Bevin Boys. Pacifist numbers during both World Wars were fairly low, especially in the Second World War, which was seen as a fight against fascism.

=== Post war ===

In the immediate period after the Second World War there was a strong revival in economic growth, accompanied by greater personal material well-being for the poorer elements of society as a result of the new systems of social welfare. Support for political nationalism strengthened with some success for Plaid Cymru and increasing pressure for Welsh devolution. Personal incomes rose during the post war period; In 1962, for example, the average weekly wage of male manual workers stood at 315s 8d, compared with the UK average of 312s 10d. According to one study, “Only in the Midlands and the south of England were male manual wages higher than in Wales.” Nevertheless, the coal industry steadily declined after 1945. By the early 1990s, there was only one deep pit still working in Wales. There was a similar catastrophic decline in the steel industry (the steel crisis), and the Welsh economy, like that of other developed societies, tilted increasingly towards the expanding service sector.

The term &quot;England and Wales&quot; became common for describing the area to which English law applied, and in 1955 Cardiff was proclaimed as Wales&#x27;s capital. &quot;Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg&quot; (The Welsh Language Society) was formed in 1962, in response to fears that the language might die out if not required in government business. Nationalist sentiment grew following the flooding of the Tryweryn valley in 1965 to create a reservoir to supply water to the English city of Liverpool. Although 35 of the 36 Welsh MPs voted against the bill (one abstained), Parliament passed the bill in 1957 and the village of Capel Celyn was submerged. This highlighted Welsh powerlessness in the face of the numerical superiority of English MPs in Parliament. Separatist groupings, such as the Free Wales Army and &quot;Mudiad Amddiffyn Cymru&quot; were formed, conducting campaigns from 1963. Prior to the investiture of Charles III in 1969, these groups were responsible for a number of bomb attacks on infrastructure. At a by-election in 1966, Gwynfor Evans won the parliamentary seat of Carmarthen, Plaid Cymru&#x27;s first Parliamentary seat.

By the end of the 1960s, the policy of bringing businesses into disadvantaged areas of Wales through financial incentives had proven very successful in diversifying the industrial economy. This policy, begun in 1934, was enhanced by the construction of industrial estates and improvements in transport communications, most notably the M4 motorway linking south Wales directly to London. It was believed that the foundations for stable economic growth had been firmly established in Wales during this period, but this was shown to be optimistic after the recession of the early 1980s saw the collapse of much of the manufacturing base that had been built over the preceding forty years.

=== Devolution ===
Meanwhile growing calls to recognise the Welsh language at an institutional level led to the passing of the Welsh Language Act 1967. The Welsh language was thus formally recognised as a legitimate language in legal and administrative contexts for the first time in English law. The proportion of the Welsh population able to speak the Welsh language was declining, falling from just under 50% in 1901 to 43.5% in 1911 and reaching a low of 18.9% in 1981. It has risen slightly since.

The Welsh Language Act 1967 repealed a section of the Wales and Berwick Act and thus &quot;Wales&quot; was no longer part of the legal definition of England. This essentially defined Wales as a separate entity legally (but within the UK), for the first time since before the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 which defined Wales as a part of the Kingdom of England. The Welsh Language Act 1967 also expanded areas where use of Welsh was permitted, including in some legal situations.
In a referendum in 1979, Wales voted against devolution for Wales by an 80 per cent majority. In 1997, a second referendum on the same issue secured a very narrow majority (50.3 per cent). The National Assembly for Wales (&quot;Cynulliad Cenedlaethol Cymru&quot;) was set up in 1999 (under the Government of Wales Act 1998) with the power to determine how Wales&#x27; central government budget is spent and administered, although the UK Parliament reserved the right to set limits on its powers.

The Government of Wales Act 2006 (c 32) of the UK Parliament reformed the National Assembly for Wales and allowed further powers to be granted to it more easily. The Act created a system of government with a separate executive drawn from and accountable to the legislature. Following a successful referendum in 2011 on extending the law-making powers of the National Assembly, it was then able to make laws, known as Acts of the Assembly, on all matters in devolved subject areas, without needing the UK Parliament&#x27;s agreement.

After the Senedd and Elections (Wales) Act 2020, in May 2020 the National Assembly was renamed &quot;&quot; in Welsh and the &quot;Welsh Parliament&quot; in English, which was seen as a better reflection of the body&#x27;s expanded legislative powers, commonly known as the &quot;Senedd&quot; in both English and Welsh.

==Welsh language==

The Welsh language () is an Indo-European language of the Celtic family; the most closely related languages are Cornish and Breton. Most linguists believe that the Celtic languages arrived in Britain around 600 BC. The Brythonic languages ceased to be spoken in England and were replaced by the English language, a Germanic language which arrived in Wales around the end of the eighth century due to the defeat of the Kingdom of Powys.

The Bible translations into Welsh and the Protestant Reformation, which encouraged use of the vernacular in religious services, helped the language survive after Welsh elites abandoned it in favour of English in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.

Successive Welsh Language Acts, in 1942, 1967 and 1993, improved the legal status of Welsh. The Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011 modernised the 1993 Welsh Language Act and gave Welsh an official status in Wales for the first time, a major landmark for the language. The Measure also created the post of Welsh Language Commissioner, replacing the Welsh Language Board. 

Starting in the 1960s, many road signs have been replaced by bilingual versions. Various public and private sector bodies have adopted bilingualism to a varying degree and (since 2011) Welsh is the only official (&quot;de jure&quot;) language in any part of Great Britain.

==Historiography==

Until recently, says Martin Johnes:
:the historiography of modern Wales was rather narrow. Its domain was the fortunes of the Liberals and Labour, the impact of trade unions and protest, and the cultural realms of nonconformity and the Welsh language. This was not surprising—all emergent fields start with the big topics and the big questions—but it did give much of Welsh academic history a rather particular flavour. It was institutional and male, and yet still concerned with fields of enquiry that lay outside the confines of the British establishment.

<text>The Battle of Tours, also called the Battle of Poitiers and the Battle of the Highway of the Martyrs (), was fought on 10 October 732, and was an important battle during the Umayyad invasion of Gaul. It resulted in victory for the Frankish and Aquitanian forces, led by Charles Martel, over the invading Umayyad forces, led by Abd al-Rahman al-Ghafiqi, governor of al-Andalus. Several historians, such as Edward Gibbon, have credited the Christian victory in the battle as an important factor in curtailing the spread of Islam in Western Europe.

Details of the battle, including the number of combatants and its exact location, are unclear from the surviving sources. Most sources agree that the Umayyads had a larger force and suffered heavier casualties. Notably, the Frankish troops apparently fought without heavy cavalry. The battlefield was located somewhere between the cities of Poitiers and Tours, in northern Aquitaine in western France, near the border of the Frankish realm and the then-independent Duchy of Aquitaine under Odo the Great.

Al-Ghafiqi was killed in combat, and the Umayyad army withdrew after the battle. The battle helped lay the foundations of the Carolingian Empire and Frankish domination of western Europe for the next century. Most historians agree that &quot;the establishment of Frankish power in western Europe shaped the continent&#x27;s destiny and the Battle of Tours confirmed that power.&quot;

==Background==
The Battle of Tours followed two decades of Umayyad conquests in Europe which had begun with the invasion of the Christian Visigothic Kingdom of the Iberian Peninsula in 711. These were followed by military expeditions into the Frankish territories of Gaul, former provinces of the Roman Empire. Umayyad military campaigns reached northward into Aquitaine and Burgundy, including a major engagement at Bordeaux and a raid on Autun. Charles&#x27;s victory is widely believed to have stopped the northward advance of Umayyad forces from the Iberian Peninsula and to have prevented the Islamization of Western Europe.

Most historians assume that the two armies met where the rivers Clain and Vienne join between Tours and Poitiers. The number of troops in each army is not known. The &quot;Mozarabic Chronicle of 754&quot;, a Latin contemporary source which describes the battle in greater detail than any other Latin or Arabic source, states that &quot;the people of Austrasia [the Frankish forces], greater in number of soldiers and formidably armed, killed the king, Abd ar-Rahman&quot;, which agrees with many Arab and Muslim historians. However, virtually all Western sources disagree, estimating the Franks as numbering 30,000, less than half the Muslim force.

Some modern historians, using estimates of what the land was able to support and what Martel could have raised from his realm and supported during the campaign, believe the total Muslim force outnumbered the Franks if one counts the outlying raiding parties which rejoined the main body before Tours. Drawing on non-contemporary Muslim sources, Creasy describes the Umayyad forces as 80,000 strong or more. Writing in 1999, Paul K. Davis estimates the Umayyad forces at 80,000 and the Franks at about 30,000, while noting that modern historians have estimated the strength of the Umayyad army at Tours at between 20,000–80,000. However, Edward J. Schoenfeld, rejecting the older figures of 60,000–400,000 Umayyads and 75,000 Franks, contends that &quot;estimates that the Umayyads had over fifty thousand troops (and the Franks even more) are logistically impossible.&quot; Similarly, historian Victor Davis Hanson believes both armies were roughly the same size, between 20,000 and 30,000 men.

Modern historical analysis may be more accurate than the medieval sources, as the modern figures are based on estimates of the logistical ability of the countryside to support these numbers of men and animals. Davis and Hanson point out that both armies had to live off the countryside, neither having a logistical system sufficient to provide supplies for a campaign. Other sources give the following estimates: &quot;Gore places the Frankish army at 15,000–20,000, although other estimates range from 30,000 to 80,000. In spite of wildly varying estimates of the Muslim force, he places that army as around 20,000–25,000. Other estimates also range up to 80,000, with 50,000 not an uncommon estimate.&quot;

Losses during the battle are unknown, but chroniclers later claimed that Charles Martel&#x27;s force lost about 1,500 while the Umayyad force was said to have suffered massive casualties of up to 375,000 men. However, these same casualty figures were recorded in the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot; for Duke Odo the Great&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Toulouse (721). Paul the Deacon reported correctly in his &quot;History of the Lombards&quot; (written around 785) that the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot; mentioned these casualty figures in relation to Odo&#x27;s victory at Toulouse (though he claimed that Charles Martel fought in the battle alongside Odo), but later writers, probably &quot;influenced by the &quot;Continuations of Fredegar&quot;, attributed the Muslims casualties solely to Charles Martel, and the battle in which they fell became unequivocally that of [Tours-Poitiers].&quot; The &quot;Vita Pardulfi&quot;, written in the middle of the eighth century, reports that after the battle &#x27;Abd-al-Raḥmân&#x27;s forces burned and looted their way through the Limousin region on their way back to Al-Andalus, which implies that they were not destroyed to the extent imagined in the &quot;Continuations of Fredegar&quot;.

===Umayyads===
The invasion of Hispania, and then Gaul, was conducted by the Umayyad dynasty ( also &quot;Umawi&quot;), the first dynasty of Sunni caliphs of the Sunni Islamic empire after the reign of the Rashidun Caliphs (Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, and Ali) ended. The Umayyad Caliphate, at the time of the Battle of Tours, was perhaps the world&#x27;s foremost military power. The great expansion of the Caliphate occurred under the reign of the Umayyads. Muslim armies pushed east across Persia and west across North Africa through the late 7th century.

The Umayyad empire was now a vast domain that ruled a diverse array of peoples. It had defeated and completely absorbed the Sasanian Empire, while also conquering much of the Byzantine Empire, including Syria, Armenia, and North Africa, although Leo the Isaurian stemmed the tide when his army defeated the Umayyads at the Battle of Akroinon (740), their final campaign in Anatolia.

===Franks===
The Frankish realm under Charles Martel was the foremost military power of western Europe. During most of his tenure in office as commander-in-chief of the Franks, the Frankish kingdom consisted of north and eastern France (Austrasia, Neustria and Burgundy), most of western Germany, and the Low Countries (Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands). This domain had begun to progress towards becoming the first real imperial power in western Europe since the fall of Rome. However, it continued to struggle against external forces such as the Saxons, Frisians, and other opponents such as the Basque-Aquitanians led by Odo the Great (Old French: Eudes, or Eudo), Duke of Aquitaine and Vasconia.

===Umayyad conquests from Hispania===

The Umayyad troops, under Al-Samh ibn Malik al-Khawlani, the governor-general of al-Andalus, overran Septimania by 719, following their sweep up the Iberian Peninsula. Al-Samh set up his capital from 720 at Narbonne, which the Moors called Arbūna. With the port of Narbonne secure, the Umayyads swiftly subdued without much resistance the cities of Alet, Béziers, Agde, Lodève, Maguelonne, and Nîmes, still controlled by their Visigothic counts.

The Umayyad campaign into Aquitaine suffered a temporary setback at the Battle of Toulouse. Duke Odo the Great broke the siege of Toulouse, taking Al-Samh ibn Malik&#x27;s forces by surprise. Al-Samh ibn Malik was mortally wounded. This defeat did not stop incursions into old Roman Gaul, as Moorish forces, soundly based in Narbonne and easily resupplied by sea, struck eastwards in the 720s, penetrating as far as Autun in Burgundy in 725.

Threatened by both the Umayyads in the south and by the Franks in the north, in 730 Odo allied himself with the Berber commander Uthman ibn Naissa, called &quot;Munuza&quot; by the Franks, the deputy governor of what would later become Catalonia. To seal the alliance, Uthman was given Odo&#x27;s daughter Lampagie in marriage, and the Moors ceased their raids across the Pyrenees, Odo&#x27;s southern border. However, the next year, the Berber leader killed the bishop of Urgell Nambaudus and detached himself from his Arab masters in Cordova. Abd Al Raḥman in turn sent an expedition to crush his revolt, and next directed his attention against Uthman&#x27;s ally Odo.

Odo collected his army at Bordeaux, but was defeated, and Bordeaux was plundered. During the following Battle of the River Garonne, the &quot;Chronicle of 754&quot; commented that &quot;God alone knows the number of the slain&quot;. The chronicle added that they &quot;pierced through the mountains, trampled over rough and level ground, plundered far into the country of the Franks, and smote all with the sword, insomuch that when Eudo came to battle with them at the River Garonne, he fled.&quot;

===Odo&#x27;s appeal to the Franks===

Odo set about reorganizing his troops despite his heavy losses, and gave the Frankish leader notice of the impending danger to the heartland of his realm while appealing to the Franks for assistance, which Charles Martel only granted after Odo agreed to submit to Frankish authority.

It appears that the Umayyads were not aware of the true strength of the Franks. The Umayyad forces were not particularly concerned about any of the Germanic tribes, including the Franks, and the Arab chronicles of that age show that awareness of the Franks as a growing military power only came after the Battle of Tours.

Further, the Umayyads appear not to have scouted northward for potential foes, for if they had, they surely would have noted Charles Martel as a force to be reckoned with on his own, because of his growing domination of much of Europe since 717.

===Umayyad advance towards the Loire===
In 732, the Umayyad advance force was proceeding north towards the Loire River, having outpaced their supply wagons and a large part of their army. Having easily destroyed all resistance in that part of Gaul, the invading army had split off into several raiding parties, while the main body advanced more slowly.

The Umayyads delayed their campaign late in the year probably because the army needed to live off the land as they advanced. They had to wait until the area&#x27;s wheat harvest was ready and then until a reasonable amount of the harvest had been stored.

Odo was defeated so easily at Bordeaux and Garonne, despite winning eleven years earlier at the Battle of Toulouse, because at Toulouse he had managed a surprise attack against an overconfident and unprepared foe: the Umayyad forces were mostly infantry, and what cavalry they did have were never mobilized. As Herman of Carinthia wrote in one of his translations of a history of al-Andalus, Odo managed a highly successful encircling envelopment which took the attackers completely by surprise, resulting in the slaughter of the Muslim forces.

At Bordeaux and again at Garonne, the Umayyad forces were mostly cavalry and had the chance to mobilize, which led to the devastation of Odo&#x27;s army. Odo&#x27;s forces, like other European troops of that era, had no stirrups at that time and therefore no heavy cavalry. Most of their troops were infantry. The Umayyad heavy cavalry broke Odo&#x27;s infantry in their first charge and then slaughtered them as they fled.

The invading force went on to devastate southern Gaul. A possible motive, according to the second continuator of the &quot;Chronicle of Fredegar&quot;, were the riches of the Abbey of Saint Martin of Tours, the most prestigious and holiest shrine in western Europe at the time. Upon hearing this, Austrasia&#x27;s Mayor of the Palace, Charles Martel, prepared his army and marched south, avoiding the old Roman roads, hoping to take the Muslims by surprise.

==Battle (October 732)==

===Preparations and manœuvre===
By all accounts, the invading forces were caught off guard to discover a large force sitting directly in their path to Tours. Charles achieved the total surprise he had hoped for. He then chose not to attack but rather set up a defensive, phalanx-like formation. According to Arab sources, the Franks drew up in a large square, with hills and trees in their front to impede or break up Muslim cavalry charges.

For one week, the two armies engaged in minor skirmishes while the Umayyads waited for their full strength to arrive. &#x27;Abd-al-Raḥmân, despite being a proven commander, had been outmanœuvred by allowing Charles to concentrate his forces and pick the field of battle. Furthermore, the Umayyads could not judge the size of Charles&#x27; army since he had used the forest to conceal his true numbers.

Charles&#x27; infantry was his best hope for victory. Seasoned and battle-hardened, most of them had fought under him for years, some as far back as 717. In addition to his army, he also had levies of militia which had not seen significant military use except for gathering food and harassing the Muslim army.

While many historians through the centuries have believed that the Franks were outnumbered at the onset of battle by at least two to one, some sources, such as the Mozarabic Chronicle of 754, contradict that assertion.

Charles correctly assumed that &#x27;Abd-al-Raḥmân would feel compelled to give battle, and move on and try to loot Tours. Neither side wanted to attack. Abd-al-Raḥmân felt he had to sack Tours, which meant he had to go through the Frankish army on the hill in front of him. Charles&#x27; decision to stay in the hills proved crucial, as it forced the Umayyad cavalry to charge uphill and through trees, diminishing their effectiveness.

Charles had been preparing for this confrontation since the Battle of Toulouse a decade earlier. Gibbon believes, as do most historians, that Charles had made the best of a bad situation. Though allegedly outnumbered and without any heavy cavalry, he had tough, battle-hardened infantrymen who believed in him implicitly. At a time in the Middle Ages when permanent armies had been non-existent in Europe, Charles even took out a large loan from the Pope after convincing him of the impending emergency, to properly train and maintain a full-size army largely composed of professional infantry. Moreover, as Davis points out, these infantrymen were heavily armed.

Formed into a phalanx formation, they were able to withstand a cavalry charge better than might be expected, especially as Charles had secured the high ground – with trees before him to further impede any cavalry charges. The failure of Arab enemy intelligence extended to the fact that they were unaware of the specific level of reliability that the combat forces that he commanded were in possession of; however he had trained them for a decade. And while he was well aware of the Caliphate&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses, he was aware they knew nothing about the Franks.

Furthermore, the Franks were dressed for the cold, whereas the Arabs wore very light clothing more suitable for North African winters than European winters.

The battle eventually became a waiting game in which the Muslims did not want to attack an army that could be numerically superior and wanted the Franks to come out into the open. The Franks formed up in a thick defensive formation and waited for them to charge uphill. The battle finally began on the seventh day, as &#x27;Abd-al-Raḥmân did not want to wait any longer, with winter approaching.

===Engagement===
&#x27;Abd-al-Raḥmân trusted in the tactical superiority of his cavalry and had them charge repeatedly throughout the day. The disciplined Frankish soldiers withstood the assaults, though according to Arab sources, the Arab cavalry broke into the Frankish square several times. Despite this, the Franks did not break. The well-trained Frankish soldiers accomplished what was not thought possible at that time: infantry withstanding a heavy cavalry charge. Paul Davis says the core of Charles&#x27; army was a professional infantry that was both highly disciplined and well-motivated, &quot;having campaigned with him all over Europe&quot;.

===Contemporary accounts===
The Mozarabic Chronicle of 754 &quot;describes the battle in greater detail than any other Latin or Arabic source&quot;. It says of the encounter that,
Charles Martel&#x27;s family composed, for the fourth book of the &quot;Continuations of Fredegar&#x27;s Chronicle&quot;, a stylized summary of the battle:

This source details further that &quot;he (Charles Martel) came down upon them like a great man of battle&quot;. It goes on to say Charles &quot;scattered them like the stubble&quot;.

The Latin word used for &quot;warrior&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;is from the Book of Maccabees, chapters 15 and 16&quot;, which describe huge battles.

It is thought that Bede&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot; (Book V, Chapter XXIV) includes a reference to the Battle of Tours: &quot;...a dreadful plague of Saracens ravaged France with miserable slaughter, but they not long after in that country received the punishment due to their wickedness&quot;.

===Strategic analysis===
Gibbon makes the point that &#x27;Abd-al-Raḥmân did not move at once against Charles Martel, and was surprised by him at Tours as Charles had marched over the mountains while avoiding the roads to surprise the Muslim invaders. Thus, Charles selected the time and place they would fight.

&#x27;Abd-al-Raḥmân was a good general, but failed to do two things he should have done before the battle:
* He either assumed that the Franks would not come to the aid of their Aquitanian rivals, or was indifferent, and he thus failed to assess their strength before the invasion.
* He failed to scout the movements of the Frankish army.

These failures disadvantaged the Muslim army in the following ways:
* The invaders were burdened with riches that they stole that played a role in the battle.
* They had casualties before they fought the battle.
* Weaker opponents such as Odo were not bypassed, whom they could have picked off at will later, while moving at once to force battle with the real power in Europe and at least partially pick the battlefield.

While some military historians point out that leaving enemies in your rear is not generally wise, the Mongols proved that indirect attack, and bypassing weaker foes to eliminate the strongest first, can be a devastatingly effective mode of invasion. In this case, those enemies were virtually no danger, given the ease with which the Muslims destroyed them. The real danger was Charles, and the failure to scout Gaul adequately was disastrous.

According to Creasy, both western and Muslim histories agree the battle was hard fought, and that the Umayyad heavy cavalry had broken into the square, but agreed that the Franks were in formation still strongly resisting.

Charles could not afford to stand idly by while Frankish territories were threatened. He would have to face the Umayyad armies sooner or later, and his men were enraged by the utter devastation of the Aquitanians and wanted to fight. But Sir Edward Creasy noted that,

Both Hallam and Watson argue that had Charles failed, there was no remaining force to protect Western Europe. Hallam perhaps said it best: &quot;It may justly be reckoned among those few battles of which a contrary event would have essentially varied the drama of the world in all its subsequent scenes: with Marathon, Arbela, the Metaurus, Châlons and Leipzig.&quot;

Strategically, and tactically, Charles probably made the best decision he could in waiting until his enemies least expected him to intervene, and then marching by stealth to catch them by surprise at a battlefield of his choosing. Probably he and his own men did not realize the seriousness of the battle they had fought, as one historian put it: &quot;few battles are remembered over 1,000 years after they are fought, but the Battle of [Tours-Poitiers] is an exception ... Charles Martel turned back a Muslim raid that had it been allowed to continue, might have conquered Gaul.&quot; Roger Collins disputes interpretations of ever-expanding Umayyad forces, reminding their internal cohesion problems and the capture of Autun in 725, when the Burgundian stronghold was captured and sacked, then just abandoned by Anbasa&#x27;s raiding forces.

== Victory for Charles Martel ==
===Umayyad retreat and second invasion===
The Umayyad army retreated south over the Pyrenees. Charles continued to expand south in subsequent years. After the death of Odo (c. 735), who had reluctantly acknowledged Charles&#x27; suzerainty in 719, Charles wished to unite Odo&#x27;s duchy to himself and went there to elicit the proper homage of the Aquitanians. But the nobility proclaimed Hunald, Odo&#x27;s son, as the duke, and Charles recognized his legitimacy when the Umayyads entered Provence as part of an alliance with Duke Maurontus the next year.

Hunald, who originally resisted acknowledging Charles as an overlord, soon had little choice. He acknowledged Charles as his overlord, albeit not for long, and Charles confirmed his duchy.

====Umayyad invasion (735–39)====
In 735, Uqba ibn al-Hajjaj, the new governor of al-Andalus, invaded Gaul. Antonio Santosuosso and other historians detail how he advanced into France to avenge the defeat at Tours and to spread Islam. According to Santosuosso, Uqba ibn al-Hajjaj converted about 2,000 Christians he had captured over his career. In the last major attempt at an invasion of Gaul through Iberia, a sizable expedition was assembled at Saragossa and entered what is now French territory in 735, crossed the River Rhone, and captured and looted Arles. From there, he struck into the heart of Provence, ending with the capture of Avignon, despite strong resistance.

Uqba ibn al-Hajjaj&#x27;s forces remained in Septimania and part of Provence for four years, carrying raids to Lyons, Burgundy, and Piedmont. Charles Martel invaded Septimania in two campaigns in 736 and 739, but was forced back again to Frankish territory under his control. Alessandro Santosuosso strongly argues that the second (Umayyad) expedition was probably more dangerous than the first. The second expedition&#x27;s failure put an end to any serious Muslim expedition across the Pyrenees, although raids continued. Plans for further large-scale attempts were hindered by internal turmoil in the Umayyad lands which often made enemies out of their own kind.

===Advance to Narbonne===
Despite the defeat at Tours, the Umayyads remained in control of parts of Septimania for another 27 years, though they could not expand further. The treaties reached earlier with the local population stood firm and were further consolidated in 734 when the governor of Narbonne, Yusuf ibn Abd al-Rahman al-Fihri, concluded agreements with several towns on common defense arrangements against the encroachments of Charles Martel, who had systematically brought the south to heel as he extended his domains. He conquered Umayyad fortresses and destroyed their garrisons at the Siege of Avignon and the Siege of Nîmes.

The army attempting to relieve Narbonne met Charles in open battle at the Battle of the River Berre and was destroyed. However, Charles failed in his attempt to take Narbonne at the Siege of Narbonne in 737, when the city was jointly defended by its Muslim Arab and Berber, and its Christian Visigothic citizens.

===Carolingian dynasty===
Reluctant to tie down his army for a siege that could last years, and believing he could not afford the losses of an all-out frontal assault such as he had used at Arles, Charles was content to isolate the few remaining invaders in Narbonne and Septimania. The threat of invasion was diminished after the Umayyad defeat at Narbonne, and the unified Caliphate would collapse into civil war in 750 at the Battle of the Zab.

It was left to Charles&#x27; son, Pepin the Short, to force Narbonne&#x27;s surrender in 759, thus bringing it into the Frankish domains. The Umayyad dynasty was expelled, driven back to Al-Andalus where Abd al-Rahman I established an emirate in Córdoba in opposition to the Abbasid caliph in Baghdad.

In the northeast of Spain, the Frankish emperors established the Marca Hispanica across the Pyrenees in part of what today is Catalonia, reconquering Girona in 785 and Barcelona in 801. This formed a buffer zone against Muslim lands across the Pyrenees. Historian J.M. Roberts said in 1993 of the Carolingian dynasty:

Before the Battle of Tours, stirrups may have been unknown in the west. Lynn Townsend White Jr. argues that the adoption of the stirrup for cavalry was the direct cause of the development of feudalism in the Frankish realm by Charles Martel and his heirs.

==Historical and macrohistorical views==
The historical views of this battle fall into three great phases, both in the East and especially in the West. Western historians, beginning with the &quot;Mozarabic Chronicle of 754&quot;, stressed the macrohistorical impact of the battle, as did the &quot;Continuations of Fredegar&quot;. This became a claim that Charles had saved Christianity, as Gibbon and his generation of historians agreed that the Battle of Tours was unquestionably decisive in world history.

Modern historians have essentially fallen into two camps on the issue. The first camp essentially agrees with Gibbon, and the other argues that the battle has been massively overstated – turned from a raid in force to an invasion, and from a mere annoyance to the Caliph to a shattering defeat that helped end the Islamic Expansion Era. It is essential, however, to note that within the first group, those who agree the battle was of macrohistorical importance, there are a number of historians who take a more moderate and nuanced view of the significance of the battle, in contrast to the more dramatic and rhetorical approach of Gibbon. The best example of this school is William E. Watson, who does believe the battle has such importance, as will be discussed below, but analyzes it militarily, culturally, and politically, rather than seeing it as a classic &quot;Muslim versus Christian&quot; confrontation.

In the East, Arab histories followed a similar path. First, the battle was regarded as a disastrous defeat; then, it largely faded from Arab histories, leading to a modern dispute which regards it as either a second loss to the great defeat of the Second Siege of Constantinople, where the Bulgarian Emperor Tervel played a crucial role, or a part of a series of great macrohistorical defeats which together brought about the fall of the first Caliphate. With the Byzantines and Bulgarians together with the Franks both successfully blocking further expansion, internal social troubles came to a head, starting with the Great Berber Revolt of 740, and ending with the Battle of the Zab, and the destruction of the Umayyad Caliphate.

===In Western history===
The first wave of modern historians, especially scholars on Rome and the medieval period, such as Edward Gibbon, contended that had Charles fallen, the Umayyad Caliphate would have easily conquered a divided Europe. Gibbon famously observed:

Nor was Gibbon alone in lavishing praise on Charles as the savior of Christendom and western civilization. H. G. Wells wrote: &quot;The Moslim when they crossed the Pyrenees in 720 found this Frankish kingdom under the practical rule of Charles Martel, the Mayor of the Palace of a degenerate descendant of Clovis, and experienced the decisive defeat of [Tours-Poitiers] (732) at his hands. This Charles Martel was practically overlord of Europe north of the Alps from the Pyrenees to Hungary. He ruled over a multitude of subordinate lords speaking French-Latin and High and Low German languages.&quot;

Gibbon was echoed a century later by the Belgian historian Godefroid Kurth, who wrote that the Battle of Tours &quot;must ever remain one of the great events in the history of the world, as upon its issue depended whether Christian Civilization should continue or Islam prevail throughout Europe.&quot;

German historians were especially ardent in their praise of Charles Martel; Schlegel speaks of this &quot;mighty victory&quot;, and tells how &quot;the arm of Charles Martel saved and delivered the Christian nations of the West from the deadly grasp of all-destroying Islam.&quot; Creasy quotes Leopold von Ranke&#x27;s opinion that this period was

The German military historian Hans Delbrück said of this battle &quot;there was no more important battle in the history of the world.&quot; (&quot;The Barbarian Invasions&quot;, p. 441.) Had Charles Martel failed, Henry Hallam argued, there would have been no Charlemagne, no Holy Roman Empire or Papal States; all these depended upon Charles&#x27;s containment of Islam from expanding into Europe while the Caliphate was unified and able to mount such a conquest. Another great mid era historian, Thomas Arnold, ranked the victory of Charles Martel even higher than the victory of Arminius in its impact on all of modern history: &quot;Charles Martel&#x27;s victory at Tours was among those signal deliverances which have affected for centuries the happiness of mankind.&quot; Louis Gustave and Charles Strauss said &quot;The victory gained was decisive and final, The torrent of Arab conquest was rolled back and Europe was rescued from the threatened yoke of the Saracens.&quot;

Charles Oman concluded that:

John Bagnell Bury, writing at the beginning of the 20th century, said &quot;The Battle of Tours ... has often been represented as an event of the first magnitude for the world&#x27;s history, because after this, the penetration of Islam into Europe was finally brought to a standstill.&quot;

Modern Western historians are clearly divided on the importance of the battle, and where it should rank in military history; see below.

===Adolf Hitler on the Battle of Tours===
Albert Speer, Hitler&#x27;s Armaments Minister, described how Hitler expressed approval of Islam, saying that Hitler had been particularly impressed by what he had heard from a delegation of Arabs. When the Arabs had tried to penetrate Central Europe in the 8th century, they had been driven back at the Battle of Tours; if they had won that battle, the world would have become Muslim (maybe). Hitler considered that Islam was more suited to the &quot;Germanic&quot; temperament and would have been more compatible to the Germans than Christianity.

===In Muslim history===
Eastern historians, like their Western counterparts, have not always agreed on the importance of the battle. According to Bernard Lewis, &quot;The Arab historians, if they mention this engagement [the Battle of Tours] at all, present it as a minor skirmish,&quot; and Gustave von Grunebaum writes: &quot;This setback may have been important from the European point of view, but for Muslims at the time, who saw no master plan imperiled thereby, it had no further significance.&quot; Contemporary Arab and Muslim historians and chroniclers were much more interested in the second Umayyad siege of Constantinople in 718, which ended in a disastrous defeat.

However, Creasy has claimed: &quot;The enduring importance of the battle of Tours in the eyes of the Muslims is attested not only by the expressions of &#x27;the deadly battle&#x27; and &#x27;the disgraceful overthrow&#x27; which their writers constantly employ when referring to it but also by the fact that no more serious attempts at conquest beyond the Pyrenees were made by the Saracens.&quot;

Thirteenth-century Moroccan author Ibn Idhari al-Marrakushi, mentioned the battle in his history of the Maghrib, &quot;&quot;al-Bayan al-Mughrib fi Akhbar al-Maghrib&quot;.&quot; According to Ibn Idhari, &quot;Abd ar-Rahman and many of his men found martyrdom on the balat ash-Shuhada&#x27;i (the path of the martyrs).&quot; Antonio Santosuosso points that &quot;they (the Muslims) called the battle&#x27;s location, the road between Poitiers and Tours, &#x27;the pavement of Martyrs&#x27;.&quot; However, as Henry Coppée pointed out, &quot;The same name was given to the battle of Toulouse and is applied to many other fields on which the Moslemah were defeated: they were always martyrs for the faith.&quot;

Khalid Yahya Blankinship argued that the military defeat at Tours was one of the failures that contributed to the decline of the Umayyad caliphate:

===Supporting the significance of Tours as a world-altering event===
Ninth-century chroniclers recorded the outcome of the battle as a divine judgment in favor of Charles and gave him the nickname &quot;Martellus&quot; (&quot;The Hammer&quot;). Later Christian chroniclers and pre-20th century historians praised Charles Martel as the champion of Christianity, characterizing the battle as the decisive turning point in the struggle against Islam, a struggle which preserved Christianity as the religion of Europe. According to modern military historian, Victor Davis Hanson &quot;most of the 18th and 19th century historians like Gibbon saw Tours as a landmark battle that marked the high tide of the Muslim advance into Europe.&quot; Leopold von Ranke felt that Tours-Poitiers &quot;was the turning point of one of the most important epochs in the history of the world.&quot;

William E. Watson writes that &quot;the subsequent history of the West would have proceeded along vastly different currents had &#x27;Abd ar-Rahman been victorious at Tours-Poitiers in 732&quot; and that &quot;[a]fter examining the motives for the Muslim drive north of the Pyrenees, one can attach a macrohistorical significance to the encounter ... especially when one considers the attention paid to the Franks in Arabic literature and the successful expansion of Muslims elsewhere in the medieval period.&quot;

Victorian writer John Henry Haaren says in &quot;Famous Men of the Middle Ages&quot; &quot;The battle of Tours or Poitiers as it should be called is regarded as one of the decisive battles of the world. It decided that Christians and not Muslims should be the ruling power in Europe.&quot; Bernard Grun delivers this assessment in his &quot;Timetables of History&quot;, reissued in 2004: &quot;In 732 Charles Martel&#x27;s victory over the Arabs at the Battle of Tours stems the tide of their westward advance.&quot;

Historian and humanist Michael Grant lists the battle of Tours in the macrohistorical dates of the Roman era. Historian Norman Cantor who specialized in the medieval period, teaching and writing at Columbia and New York University said in 1993: &quot;It may be true that the Arabs had now fully extended their resources and they would not have conquered France, but their defeat (at Tours) in 732 put a stop to their advance to the North.&quot;

Military historian Robert W. Martin considers Tours &quot;one of the most decisive battles in all of history.&quot; Additionally, historian Hugh Kennedy says &quot;it was clearly significant in establishing the power of Charles Martel and the Carolingians in France, but it also had profound consequences in Muslim Spain. It signaled the end of the &quot;ghanima&quot; (booty) economy.&quot;

Military Historian Paul Davis argued in 1999 &quot;had the Muslims been victorious at Tours, it is difficult to suppose what population in Europe could have organized to resist them.&quot; Likewise, George Bruce in his update of Harbottle&#x27;s classic military history &quot;Dictionary of Battles&quot; maintains that &quot;Charles Martel defeated the Moslem army effectively ending Moslem attempts to conquer western Europe.&quot;

History professor Antonio Santosuosso comments on Charles, Tours, and the subsequent campaigns against Rahman&#x27;s son in 736–737, that these later defeats of invading Muslim armies were at least as important as Tours in their defense of Western Christendom and its monasteries, the centers of learning that ultimately led Europe out of her Middle Ages. He also makes an argument, after studying the Arab histories of the period, that these were armies of invasion sent by the Caliph not just to avenge Tours, but to begin the end of Christian Europe and bring it into the Caliphate.

Professor of religion Huston Smith says in &quot;The World&#x27;s Religions: Our Great Wisdom Traditions&quot; &quot;But for their defeat by Charles Martel in the Battle of Tours in 732, the entire Western world might today be Muslim.&quot; Historian Robert Payne on page 142 in &quot;The History of Islam&quot; said &quot;The more powerful Muslims and the spread of Islam were knocking on Europe&#x27;s door. And the spread of Islam was stopped along the road between the towns of Tours and Poitiers, France, with just its head in Europe.&quot;

Victor Davis Hanson has commented that

Paul Davis, another modern historian, says &quot;whether Charles Martel saved Europe for Christianity is a matter of some debate. What is sure, however, is that his victory ensured that the Franks would dominate Gaul for more than a century.&quot; Davis writes, &quot;Moslem defeat ended the Moslems&#x27; threat to western Europe, and Frankish victory established the Franks as the dominant population in western Europe, establishing the dynasty that led to Charlemagne.&quot;

===Objecting to the significance of Tours as a world-altering event===
Other historians disagree with this assessment. Alessandro Barbero writes, &quot;Today, historians tend to play down the significance of the battle of [Tours-Poitiers], pointing out that the purpose of the Muslim force defeated by Charles Martel was not to conquer the Frankish kingdom, but simply to pillage the wealthy monastery of St-Martin of Tours&quot;. Similarly, Tomaž Mastnak writes:

The historian Philip Khuri Hitti believes that &quot;In reality, nothing was decided on the battlefield of Tours.

<doc id="46675" wikidata="Q122811" url="?curid=46675" title="Xylem">
<text>Xylem is one of the two types of transport tissue in vascular plants, the other being phloem; both of these are part of the vascular bundle. The basic function of the xylem is to transport water upward from the roots to parts of the plants such as stems and leaves, but it also transports nutrients. The word &quot;xylem&quot; is derived from the Ancient Greek word, &quot;&quot; (&quot;xylon&quot;), meaning &quot;wood&quot;; the best-known xylem tissue is wood, though it is found throughout a plant. The term was introduced by Carl Nägeli in 1858.

== Structure ==
The most distinctive xylem cells are the long tracheary elements that transport water. Tracheids and vessel elements are distinguished by their shape; vessel elements are shorter, and are connected together into long tubes that are called &quot;vessels&quot;.

Xylem also contains two other type of cells: parenchyma and fibers.

Xylem can be found:
* in vascular bundles, present in non-woody plants and non-woody parts of woody plants
* in secondary xylem, laid down by a meristem called the vascular cambium in woody plants
* as part of a stelar arrangement not divided into bundles, as in many ferns.

In transitional stages of plants with secondary growth, the first two categories are not mutually exclusive, although usually a vascular bundle will contain &quot;primary xylem&quot; only.

The branching pattern exhibited by xylem follows Murray&#x27;s law.

== Primary and secondary xylem ==
Primary xylem is formed during primary growth from procambium. It includes protoxylem and metaxylem. Metaxylem develops after the protoxylem but before secondary xylem. Metaxylem has wider vessels and tracheids than protoxylem.

Secondary xylem is formed during secondary growth from vascular cambium. Although secondary xylem is also found in members of the gymnosperm groups Gnetophyta and Ginkgophyta and to a lesser extent in members of the Cycadophyta, the two main groups in which secondary xylem can be found are:
# conifers (&quot;Coniferae&quot;): there are approximately 600 known species of conifers. All species have secondary xylem, which is relatively uniform in structure throughout this group. Many conifers become tall trees: the secondary xylem of such trees is used and marketed as softwood.
# angiosperms (&quot;Angiospermae&quot;): there are approximately 250,000 known species of angiosperms. Within this group secondary xylem is rare in the monocots. Many non-monocot angiosperms become trees, and the secondary xylem of these is used and marketed as hardwood.

== Main function – upwards water transport ==
The xylem, vessels and tracheids of the roots, stems and leaves are interconnected to form a continuous system of water-conducting channels reaching all parts of the plants. The system transports water and soluble mineral nutrients from the roots throughout the plant. It is also used to replace water lost during transpiration and photosynthesis. Xylem sap consists mainly of water and inorganic ions, although it can also contain a number of organic chemicals as well. The transport is passive, not powered by energy spent by the tracheary elements themselves, which are dead by maturity and no longer have living contents. Transporting sap upwards becomes more difficult as the height of a plant increases and upwards transport of water by xylem is considered to limit the maximum height of trees. Three phenomena cause xylem sap to flow:
* Pressure flow hypothesis: Sugars produced in the leaves and other green tissues are kept in the phloem system, creating a solute pressure differential versus the xylem system carrying a far lower load of solutes—water and minerals. The phloem pressure can rise to several MPa, far higher than atmospheric pressure. Selective inter-connection between these systems allows this high solute concentration in the phloem to draw xylem fluid upwards by negative pressure.
* Transpirational pull: Similarly, the evaporation of water from the surfaces of mesophyll cells to the atmosphere also creates a negative pressure at the top of a plant. This causes millions of minute menisci to form in the mesophyll cell wall. The resulting surface tension causes a negative pressure or tension in the xylem that pulls the water from the roots and soil.
* Root pressure: If the water potential of the root cells is more negative than that of the soil, usually due to high concentrations of solute, water can move by osmosis into the root from the soil. This causes a positive pressure that forces sap up the xylem towards the leaves. In some circumstances, the sap will be forced from the leaf through a hydathode in a phenomenon known as guttation. Root pressure is highest in the morning before the opening of stomata and allow transpiration to begin. Different plant species can have different root pressures even in a similar environment; examples include up to 145 kPa in &quot;Vitis riparia&quot; but around zero in &quot;Celastrus orbiculatus&quot;.

The primary force that creates the capillary action movement of water upwards in plants is the adhesion between the water and the surface of the xylem conduits. Capillary action provides the force that establishes an equilibrium configuration, balancing gravity. When transpiration removes water at the top, the flow is needed to return to the equilibrium.

Transpirational pull results from the evaporation of water from the surfaces of cells in the leaves. This evaporation causes the surface of the water to recess into the s of the cell wall. By capillary action, the water forms concave menisci inside the pores. The high surface tension of water pulls the outwards, generating enough force to lift water as high as a hundred meters from ground level to a tree&#x27;s highest branches.

Transpirational pull requires that the vessels transporting the water be very small in diameter; otherwise, cavitation would break the water column. And as water evaporates from leaves, more is drawn up through the plant to replace it. When the water pressure within the xylem reaches extreme levels due to low water input from the roots (if, for example, the soil is dry), then the gases come out of solution and form a bubble – an embolism forms, which will spread quickly to other adjacent cells, unless bordered pits are present (these have a plug-like structure called a torus, that seals off the opening between adjacent cells and stops the embolism from spreading). Even after an embolism has occurred, plants are able to refill the xylem and restore the functionality.

=== Cohesion-tension theory ===
The &quot;cohesion-tension theory&quot; is a theory of intermolecular attraction that explains the process of water flow upwards (against the force of gravity) through the xylem of plants. It was proposed in 1894 by John Joly and Henry Horatio Dixon. Despite numerous objections, this is the most widely accepted theory for the transport of water through a plant&#x27;s vascular system based on the classical research of Dixon-Joly (1894), Eugen Askenasy (1845–1903) (1895), and Dixon (1914,1924).

Water is a polar molecule. When two water molecules approach one another, the slightly negatively charged oxygen atom of one forms a hydrogen bond with a slightly positively charged hydrogen atom in the other. This attractive force, along with other intermolecular forces, is one of the principal factors responsible for the occurrence of surface tension in liquid water. It also allows plants to draw water from the root through the xylem to the leaf.

Water is constantly lost through transpiration from the leaf. When one water molecule is lost another is pulled along by the processes of cohesion and tension. Transpiration pull, utilizing capillary action and the inherent surface tension of water, is the primary mechanism of water movement in plants. However, it is not the only mechanism involved. Any use of water in leaves forces water to move into them.

Transpiration in leaves creates tension (differential pressure) in the cell walls of mesophyll cells. Because of this tension, water is being pulled up from the roots into the leaves, helped by cohesion (the pull between individual water molecules, due to hydrogen bonds) and adhesion (the stickiness between water molecules and the hydrophilic cell walls of plants). This mechanism of water flow works because of water potential (water flows from high to low potential), and the rules of simple diffusion.

Over the past century, there has been a great deal of research regarding the mechanism of xylem sap transport; today, most plant scientists continue to agree that the &quot;cohesion-tension theory&quot; best explains this process, but multiforce theories that hypothesize several alternative mechanisms have been suggested, including longitudinal cellular and xylem osmotic pressure gradients, axial potential gradients in the vessels, and gel- and gas-bubble-supported interfacial gradients.

=== Measurement of pressure ===
Until recently, the differential pressure (suction) of transpirational pull could only be measured indirectly, by applying external pressure with a pressure bomb to counteract it. When the technology to perform direct measurements with a pressure probe was developed, there was initially some doubt about whether the classic theory was correct, because some workers were unable to demonstrate negative pressures. More recent measurements do tend to validate the classic theory, for the most part. Xylem transport is driven by a combination of transpirational pull from above and root pressure from below, which makes the interpretation of measurements more complicated.

== Evolution ==
Xylem appeared early in the history of terrestrial plant life. Fossil plants with anatomically preserved xylem are known from the Silurian (more than 400 million years ago), and trace fossils resembling individual xylem cells may be found in earlier Ordovician rocks. The earliest true and recognizable xylem consists of tracheids with a helical-annular reinforcing layer added to the cell wall. This is the only type of xylem found in the earliest vascular plants, and this type of cell continues to be found in the &quot;protoxylem&quot; (first-formed xylem) of all living groups of vascular plants. Several groups of plants later developed pitted tracheid cells independently through convergent evolution. In living plants, pitted tracheids do not appear in development until the maturation of the &quot;metaxylem&quot; (following the &quot;protoxylem&quot;).

In most plants, pitted tracheids function as the primary transport cells. The other type of vascular element, found in angiosperms, is the vessel element. Vessel elements are joined end to end to form vessels in which water flows unimpeded, as in a pipe. The presence of xylem vessels (also called trachea) is considered to be one of the key innovations that led to the success of the angiosperms. However, the occurrence of vessel elements is not restricted to angiosperms, and they are absent in some archaic or &quot;basal&quot; lineages of the angiosperms: (e.g., Amborellaceae, Tetracentraceae, Trochodendraceae, and Winteraceae), and their secondary xylem is described by Arthur Cronquist as &quot;primitively vesselless&quot;. Cronquist considered the vessels of &quot;Gnetum&quot; to be convergent with those of angiosperms. Whether the absence of vessels in basal angiosperms is a primitive condition is contested, the alternative hypothesis states that vessel elements originated in a precursor to the angiosperms and were subsequently lost.

To photosynthesize, plants must absorb from the atmosphere. However, this comes at a price: while stomata are open to allow to enter, water can evaporate. Water is lost much faster than is absorbed, so plants need to replace it, and have developed systems to transport water from the moist soil to the site of photosynthesis. Early plants sucked water between the walls of their cells, then evolved the ability to control water loss (and acquisition) through the use of stomata. Specialized water transport tissues soon evolved in the form of hydroids, tracheids, then secondary xylem, followed by an endodermis and ultimately vessels.

The high levels of Silurian-Devonian times, when plants were first colonizing land, meant that the need for water was relatively low. As was withdrawn from the atmosphere by plants, more water was lost in its capture, and more elegant transport mechanisms evolved. As water transport mechanisms, and waterproof cuticles, evolved, plants could survive without being continually covered by a film of water. This transition from poikilohydry to homoiohydry opened up new potential for colonization. Plants then needed a robust internal structure that held long narrow channels for transporting water from the soil to all the different parts of the above-soil plant, especially to the parts where photosynthesis occurred.

During the Silurian, was readily available, so little water needed expending to acquire it. By the end of the Carboniferous, when levels had lowered to something approaching today&#x27;s, around 17 times more water was lost per unit of uptake. However, even in these &quot;easy&quot; early days, water was at a premium, and had to be transported to parts of the plant from the wet soil to avoid desiccation. This early water transport took advantage of the &quot;cohesion-tension&quot; mechanism inherent in water. Water has a tendency to diffuse to areas that are drier, and this process is accelerated when water can be wicked along a fabric with small spaces. In small passages, such as that between the plant cell walls (or in tracheids), a column of water behaves like rubber – when molecules evaporate from one end, they pull the molecules behind them along the channels. Therefore, transpiration alone provided the driving force for water transport in early plants. However, without dedicated transport vessels, the cohesion-tension mechanism cannot transport water more than about 2 cm, severely limiting the size of the earliest plants. This process demands a steady supply of water from one end, to maintain the chains; to avoid exhausting it, plants developed a waterproof cuticle. Early cuticle may not have had pores but did not cover the entire plant surface, so that gas exchange could continue. However, dehydration at times was inevitable; early plants cope with this by having a lot of water stored between their cell walls, and when it comes to it sticking out the tough times by putting life &quot;on hold&quot; until more water is supplied.

To be free from the constraints of small size and constant moisture that the parenchymatic transport system inflicted, plants needed a more efficient water transport system. During the early Silurian, they developed specialized cells, which were lignified (or bore similar chemical compounds) to avoid implosion; this process coincided with cell death, allowing their innards to be emptied and water to be passed through them. These wider, dead, empty cells were a million times more conductive than the inter-cell method, giving the potential for transport over longer distances, and higher diffusion rates.

The earliest macrofossils to bear water-transport tubes are Silurian plants placed in the genus &quot;Cooksonia&quot;. The early Devonian pretracheophytes &quot;Aglaophyton&quot; and &quot;Horneophyton&quot; have structures very similar to the hydroids of modern mosses.
Plants continued to innovate new ways of reducing the resistance to flow within their cells, thereby increasing the efficiency of their water transport. Bands on the walls of tubes, in fact apparent from the early Silurian onwards, are an early improvisation to aid the easy flow of water. Banded tubes, as well as tubes with pits in their walls, were lignified and, when they form single celled conduits, are considered to be &quot;tracheids&quot;. These, the &quot;next generation&quot; of transport cell design, have a more rigid structure than hydroids, allowing them to cope with higher levels of water pressure. Tracheids may have a single evolutionary origin, possibly within the hornworts, uniting all tracheophytes (but they may have evolved more than once).

Water transport requires regulation, and dynamic control is provided by stomata.
By adjusting the amount of gas exchange, they can restrict the amount of water lost through transpiration. This is an important role where water supply is not constant, and indeed stomata appear to have evolved before tracheids, being present in the non-vascular hornworts.

An endodermis probably evolved during the Silu-Devonian, but the first fossil evidence for such a structure is Carboniferous. This structure in the roots covers the water transport tissue and regulates ion exchange (and prevents unwanted pathogens etc. from entering the water transport system). The endodermis can also provide an upwards pressure, forcing water out of the roots when transpiration is not enough of a driver.

Once plants had evolved this level of controlled water transport, they were truly homoiohydric, able to extract water from their environment through root-like organs rather than relying on a film of surface moisture, enabling them to grow to much greater size. As a result of their independence from their surroundings, they lost their ability to survive desiccation – a costly trait to retain.

During the Devonian, maximum xylem diameter increased with time, with the minimum diameter remaining pretty constant. By the middle Devonian, the tracheid diameter of some plant lineages (Zosterophyllophytes) had plateaued. Wider tracheids allow water to be transported faster, but the overall transport rate depends also on the overall cross-sectional area of the xylem bundle itself. The increase in vascular bundle thickness further seems to correlate with the width of plant axes, and plant height; it is also closely related to the appearance of leaves and increased stomatal density, both of which would increase the demand for water.
While wider tracheids with robust walls make it possible to achieve higher water transport tensions, this increases the likelihood of cavitation. Cavitation occurs when a bubble of air forms within a vessel, breaking the bonds between chains of water molecules and preventing them from pulling more water up with their cohesive tension. A tracheid, once cavitated, cannot have its embolism removed and return to service (except in a few advanced angiosperms which have developed a mechanism of doing so). Therefore, it is well worth plants&#x27; while to avoid cavitation occurring. For this reason, pits in tracheid walls have very small diameters, to prevent air entering and allowing bubbles to nucleate. Freeze-thaw cycles are a major cause of cavitation. Damage to a tracheid&#x27;s wall almost inevitably leads to air leaking in and cavitation, hence the importance of many tracheids working in parallel.

Once cavitation has occurred, plants have a range of mechanisms to contain the damage. Small pits link adjacent conduits to allow fluid to flow between them, but not air – although these pits, which prevent the spread of embolism, are also a major cause of them. These pitted surfaces further reduce the flow of water through the xylem by as much as 30%. The diversification of xylem strand shapes with tracheid network topologies increasingly resistant to the spread of embolism likely facilitated increases in plant size and the colonization of drier habitats during the Devonian radiation. Conifers, by the Jurassic, developed bordered pits had valve-like structures to isolate cavitated elements. These torus-margo structures have an impermeable disc (torus) suspended by a permeable membrane (margo) between two adjacent pores. When a tracheid on one side depressurizes, the disc is sucked into the pore on that side, and blocks further flow. Other plants simply tolerate cavitation. For instance, oaks grow a ring of wide vessels at the start of each spring, none of which survive the winter frosts. Maples use root pressure each spring to force sap upwards from the roots, squeezing out any air bubbles.

Growing to height also employed another trait of tracheids – the support offered by their lignified walls. Defunct tracheids were retained to form a strong, woody stem, produced in most instances by a secondary xylem. However, in early plants, tracheids were too mechanically vulnerable, and retained a central position, with a layer of tough sclerenchyma on the outer rim of the stems. Even when tracheids do take a structural role, they are supported by sclerenchymatic tissue.

Tracheids end with walls, which impose a great deal of resistance on flow; vessel members have perforated end walls, and are arranged in series to operate as if they were one continuous vessel. The function of end walls, which were the default state in the Devonian, was probably to avoid embolisms. An embolism is where an air bubble is created in a tracheid. This may happen as a result of freezing, or by gases dissolving out of solution. Once an embolism is formed, it usually cannot be removed (but see later); the affected cell cannot pull water up, and is rendered useless.

End walls excluded, the tracheids of prevascular plants were able to operate under the same hydraulic conductivity as those of the first vascular plant, &quot;Cooksonia&quot;.

The size of tracheids is limited as they comprise a single cell; this limits their length, which in turn limits their maximum useful diameter to 80 μm. Conductivity grows with the fourth power of diameter, so increased diameter has huge rewards; &quot;vessel elements&quot;, consisting of a number of cells, joined at their ends, overcame this limit and allowed larger tubes to form, reaching diameters of up to 500 μm, and lengths of up to 10 m.

Vessels first evolved during the dry, low periods of the late Permian, in the horsetails, ferns and Selaginellales independently, and later appeared in the mid Cretaceous in angiosperms and gnetophytes.
Vessels allow the same cross-sectional area of wood to transport around a hundred times more water than tracheids! This allowed plants to fill more of their stems with structural fibers, and also opened a new niche to vines, which could transport water without being as thick as the tree they grew on. Despite these advantages, tracheid-based wood is a lot lighter, thus cheaper to make, as vessels need to be much more reinforced to avoid cavitation.

== Development ==
Xylem development can be described by four terms: &quot;centrarch, exarch, endarch&quot; and &quot;mesarch&quot;. As it develops in young plants, its nature changes from &quot;protoxylem&quot; to &quot;metaxylem&quot; (i.e. from &quot;first xylem&quot; to &quot;after xylem&quot;). The patterns in which protoxylem and metaxylem are arranged are essential in studying plant morphology.

=== Protoxylem and metaxylem ===
As a young vascular plant grows, one or more strands of primary xylem form in its stems and roots. The first xylem to develop is called &#x27;protoxylem&#x27;. In appearance, protoxylem is usually distinguished by narrower vessels formed of smaller cells. Some of these cells have walls that contain thickenings in the form of rings or helices. Functionally, protoxylem can extend: the cells can grow in size and develop while a stem or root is elongating. Later, &#x27;metaxylem&#x27; develops in the strands of xylem. Metaxylem vessels and cells are usually larger; the cells have thickenings typically either in the form of ladderlike transverse bars (scalariform) or continuous sheets except for holes or pits (pitted). Functionally, metaxylem completes its development after elongation ceases when the cells no longer need to grow in size.

=== Patterns of protoxylem and metaxylem ===
There are four primary patterns to the arrangement of protoxylem and metaxylem in stems and roots.
* &quot;Centrarch&quot; refers to the case in which the primary xylem forms a single cylinder in the center of the stem and develops from the center outwards. The protoxylem is thus found in the central core, and the metaxylem is in a cylinder around it. This pattern was common in early land plants, such as &quot;rhyniophytes&quot;, but is not present in any living plants.

The other three terms are used where there is more than one strand of primary xylem.
* &quot;Exarch&quot; is used when there is more than one strand of primary xylem in a stem or root, and the xylem develops from the outside inwards towards the center, i.e., centripetally. The metaxylem is thus closest to the center of the stem or root, and the protoxylem is closest to the periphery. The roots of vascular plants are generally considered to have exarch development.
* &quot;Endarch&quot; is used when there is more than one strand of primary xylem in a stem or root, and the xylem develops from the inside outwards towards the periphery, i.e., centrifugally. The protoxylem is thus closest to the center of the stem or root, and the metaxylem is closest to the periphery. The stems of seed plants typically have endarch development.
* &quot;Mesarch&quot; is used when there is more than one strand of primary xylem in a stem or root, and the xylem develops from the middle of a strand in both directions. The metaxylem is thus on both the peripheral and central sides of the strand, with the protoxylem between the metaxylem (possibly surrounded by it). The leaves and stems of many ferns have mesarch development.

== History ==

In his book &quot;De plantis libri XVI&quot; (On Plants, in 16 books) (1583), the Italian physician and botanist Andrea Cesalpino proposed that plants draw water from soil not by magnetism (&quot;ut magnes ferrum trahit&quot;, as magnetic iron attracts) nor by suction (&quot;vacuum&quot;), but by absorption, as occurs in the case of linen, sponges, or powders. The Italian biologist Marcello Malpighi was the first person to describe and illustrate xylem vessels, which he did in his book &quot;Anatome plantarum&quot; ... (1675). Although Malpighi believed that xylem contained only air, the British physician and botanist Nehemiah Grew, who was Malpighi&#x27;s contemporary, believed that sap ascended both through the bark and through the xylem. However, according to Grew, capillary action in the xylem would raise the sap by only a few inches; to raise the sap to the top of a tree, Grew proposed that the parenchymal cells become turgid and thereby not only squeeze the sap in the tracheids but force some sap from the parenchyma into the tracheids. In 1727, English clergyman and botanist Stephen Hales showed that transpiration by a plant&#x27;s leaves causes water to move through its xylem. By 1891, the Polish-German botanist Eduard Strasburger had shown that the transport of water in plants did not require the xylem cells to be alive.

<text>In mathematics, the Banach fixed-point theorem (also known as the contraction mapping theorem or contractive mapping theorem or Banach–Caccioppoli theorem) is an important tool in the theory of metric spaces; it guarantees the existence and uniqueness of fixed points of certain self-maps of metric spaces and provides a constructive method to find those fixed points. It can be understood as an abstract formulation of Picard&#x27;s method of successive approximations. The theorem is named after Stefan Banach (1892–1945) who first stated it in 1922.

==Statement==
&quot;Definition.&quot; Let formula_1 be a metric space. Then a map formula_2 is called a contraction mapping on &quot;X&quot; if there exists formula_3 such that
:formula_4
for all formula_5
Banach fixed-point theorem. Let formula_1 be a non-empty complete metric space with a contraction mapping formula_7 Then &quot;T&quot; admits a unique fixed-point formula_8 in &quot;X&quot; (i.e. formula_9). Furthermore, formula_8 can be found as follows: start with an arbitrary element formula_11 and define a sequence formula_12 by formula_13 for formula_14 Then formula_15.

&quot;Remark 1.&quot; The following inequalities are equivalent and describe the speed of convergence:

:formula_16

Any such value of &quot;q&quot; is called a &quot;Lipschitz constant&quot; for formula_17, and the smallest one is sometimes called &quot;the best Lipschitz constant&quot; of formula_17.

&quot;Remark 2.&quot; formula_19 for all formula_20 is in general not enough to ensure the existence of a fixed point, as is shown by the map
:formula_21
which lacks a fixed point. However, if formula_22 is compact, then this weaker assumption does imply the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point, that can be easily found as a minimizer of formula_23, indeed, a minimizer exists by compactness, and has to be a fixed point of formula_24 It then easily follows that the fixed point is the limit of any sequence of iterations of formula_24

&quot;Remark 3.&quot; When using the theorem in practice, the most difficult part is typically to define formula_22 properly so that formula_27

==Proof==

Let formula_11 be arbitrary and define a sequence formula_12 by setting formula_13. We first note that for all formula_31 we have the inequality

:formula_32

This follows by induction on formula_33, using the fact that formula_17 is a contraction mapping. Then we can show that formula_12 is a Cauchy sequence. In particular, let formula_36 such that formula_37:

: formula_38

Let formula_39 be arbitrary. Since formula_40, we can find a large formula_41 so that

:formula_42

Therefore, by choosing formula_43 and formula_33 greater than formula_45 we may write:

:formula_46

This proves that the sequence formula_12 is Cauchy. By completeness of formula_1, the sequence has a limit formula_49 Furthermore, formula_8 must be a fixed point of formula_17:

:formula_52

As a contraction mapping, formula_17 is continuous, so bringing the limit inside formula_17 was justified. Lastly, formula_17 cannot have more than one fixed point in formula_1, since any pair of distinct fixed points formula_57 and formula_58 would contradict the contraction of formula_17:

:formula_60

==Applications==
* A standard application is the proof of the Picard–Lindelöf theorem about the existence and uniqueness of solutions to certain ordinary differential equations. The sought solution of the differential equation is expressed as a fixed point of a suitable integral operator on the space of continuous functions under the uniform norm. The Banach fixed-point theorem is then used to show that this integral operator has a unique fixed point.
* One consequence of the Banach fixed-point theorem is that small Lipschitz perturbations of the identity are bi-lipschitz homeomorphisms. Let Ω be an open set of a Banach space &quot;E&quot;; let denote the identity (inclusion) map and let &quot;g&quot; : Ω → &quot;E&quot; be a Lipschitz map of constant &quot;k&quot; &lt; 1. Then 
# Ω′ := (&quot;I&quot; + &quot;g&quot;)(Ω) is an open subset of &quot;E&quot;: precisely, for any &quot;x&quot; in Ω such that one has 
# &quot;I&quot; + &quot;g&quot; : Ω → Ω′ is a bi-Lipschitz homeomorphism; 
: precisely, (&quot;I&quot; + &quot;g&quot;)−1 is still of the form with &quot;h&quot; a Lipschitz map of constant &quot;k&quot;/(1 − &quot;k&quot;). A direct consequence of this result yields the proof of the inverse function theorem.
* It can be used to give sufficient conditions under which Newton&#x27;s method of successive approximations is guaranteed to work, and similarly for Chebyshev&#x27;s third-order method.
* It can be used to prove existence and uniqueness of solutions to integral equations.
* It can be used to give a proof to the Nash embedding theorem.
* It can be used to prove existence and uniqueness of solutions to value iteration, policy iteration, and policy evaluation of reinforcement learning.
* It can be used to prove existence and uniqueness of an equilibrium in Cournot competition, and other dynamic economic models.

==Converses==
Several converses of the Banach contraction principle exist. The following is due to Czesław Bessaga, from 1959:

Let &quot;f&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;X&quot; be a map of an abstract set such that each iterate &quot;fn&quot; has a unique fixed point. Let formula_61 then there exists a complete metric on &quot;X&quot; such that &quot;f&quot; is contractive, and &quot;q&quot; is the contraction constant.

Indeed, very weak assumptions suffice to obtain such a kind of converse. For example if formula_62 is a map on a &quot;T&quot;1 topological space with a unique fixed point &quot;a&quot;, such that for each formula_63 we have &quot;fn&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) → &quot;a&quot;, then there already exists a metric on &quot;X&quot; with respect to which &quot;f&quot; satisfies the conditions of the Banach contraction principle with contraction constant 1/2. In this case the metric is in fact an ultrametric.

==Generalizations==
There are a number of generalizations (some of which are immediate corollaries).

Let &quot;T&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;X&quot; be a map on a complete non-empty metric space. Then, for example, some generalizations of the Banach fixed-point theorem are:
*Assume that some iterate &quot;Tn&quot; of &quot;T&quot; is a contraction. Then &quot;T&quot; has a unique fixed point.
*Assume that for each &quot;n&quot;, there exist &quot;cn&quot; such that &quot;d&quot;(&quot;T&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), &quot;T&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;y&quot;)) ≤ &quot;c&quot;&quot;n&quot;&quot;d&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) for all &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;, and that

In applications, the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point often can be shown directly with the standard Banach fixed point theorem, by a suitable choice of the metric that makes the map &quot;T&quot; a contraction. Indeed, the above result by Bessaga strongly suggests to look for such a metric. See also the article on fixed point theorems in infinite-dimensional spaces for generalizations.

In a non-empty compact metric space, any function formula_17 satisfying formula_19 for all distinct formula_67, has a unique fixed point. The proof is simpler than the Banach theorem, because the function formula_68 is continuous, and therefore assumes a minimum, which is easily shown to be zero.

A different class of generalizations arise from suitable generalizations of the notion of metric space, e.g. by weakening the defining axioms for the notion of metric. Some of these have applications, e.g., in the theory of programming semantics in theoretical computer science.

==Example==

An application of the Banach fixed-point theorem and fixed-point iteration can be used to quickly obtain an approximation of with high accuracy. Consider the function formula_69. It can be verified that is a fixed point of &quot;f&quot;, and that &quot;f&quot; maps the interval formula_70 to itself. Moreover, formula_71, and it can be verified that

:formula_72

on this interval. Therefore, by an application of the mean value theorem, &quot;f&quot; has a Lipschitz constant less than 1 (namely formula_73). Applying the Banach fixed-point theorem shows that the fixed point is the unique fixed point on the interval, allowing for fixed-point iteration to be used.

For example, the value 3 may be chosen to start the fixed-point iteration, as formula_74. The Banach fixed-point theorem may be used to conclude that

: formula_75

Applying &quot;f&quot; to 3 only three times already yields an expansion of accurate to 33 digits:

<text>(, &quot;The Flittermouse&quot; or &quot;The Bat&quot;, sometimes called &quot;The Revenge of the Bat&quot;) is an operetta composed by Johann Strauss II to a German libretto by Karl Haffner and Richard Genée, which premiered in 1874.

==Background==
The original literary source for &#x27; was &#x27; (&quot;The Prison&quot;), a farce by German playwright Julius Roderich Benedix that premiered in Berlin in 1851. On 10 September 1872, a three-act French vaudeville play by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy, &quot;&quot;, loosely based on the Benedix farce, opened at the Théâtre du Palais-Royal. Meilhac and Halévy had provided several successful libretti for Offenbach and &quot;Le Réveillon&quot; later formed the basis for the 1926 silent film &quot;So This Is Paris&quot;, directed by Ernst Lubitsch.

Meilhac and Halévy&#x27;s play was soon translated into German by Karl Haffner (1804–1876), at the instigation of Max Steiner, as a non-musical play for production in Vienna. The French custom of a New Year&#x27;s Eve &quot;réveillon&quot;, or supper party, was not considered to provide a suitable setting for the Viennese theatre, so it was decided to substitute a ball for the &quot;réveillon&quot;. Haffner&#x27;s translation was then passed to the playwright and composer Richard Genée, who had provided some of the lyrics for Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Der Karneval in Rom&quot; the year before, and he completed the libretto.

==Performance history==

The operetta premiered on 5 April 1874 at the Theater an der Wien in Vienna and has been part of the regular repertoire ever since.

It was performed in New York under Rudolf Bial at the Stadt Theatre on 21 November 1874. The German première took place at Munich&#x27;s Gärtnerplatztheater in 1875. &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot; was sung in English at London&#x27;s Alhambra Theatre on 18 December 1876, with its score modified by Hamilton Clarke.

When the operetta came to Paris in 1877 at the Théâtre de la Renaissance, as &quot;La Tzigane&quot;, with Ismaël and Zulma Bouffar in the cast, it was not a success; only in 1904, with Meilhac and Halevy&#x27;s original roles names and the words adapted by Paul Ferrier to the music (with Max Dearly and Ève Lavallière in the cast) did it find success in Paris and enter the repertoire there.

The first London performance in German did not take place until 1895. According to the archivist of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, &quot;Twenty years after its production as a lyric opera in Vienna, [composer and conductor Gustav] Mahler raised the artistic status of Strauss&#x27;s work by producing it at the Hamburg Opera House [...] all the leading opera houses in Europe, notably Vienna and Munich, have brightened their regular repertoire by including it for occasional performance.&quot;

The role of Eisenstein was originally written for a tenor but is now frequently sung by a baritone. The role of Orlofsky is a trouser role, usually performed by a mezzo-soprano, sometimes by a countertenor and occasionally – an octave lower – by a tenor.

The party of act 2 allows productions to insert a variety of additional entertainment acts, such as music, comedy, or dance. The lengthy drunken soliloquy by Frosch (a comedy speaking role) in act 3 also permits variety in performance.

==Roles==
==Synopsis==

===Act 1===

&quot;Eisenstein&#x27;s apartment&quot;

Gabriel von Eisenstein, a Viennese man-about-town, has been sentenced to eight days in prison for insulting an official, partially due to the incompetence of his attorney, Dr. Blind. Adele, Eisenstein&#x27;s maid, receives a forged letter, allegedly from her sister who is in the company of the ballet, but actually written by Eisenstein&#x27;s friend Falke, inviting her to Prince Orlofsky&#x27;s ball. She pretends the letter says that her aunt is very sick, and asks her mistress Rosalinde (Eisenstein&#x27;s wife) for an evening off (&quot;Da schreibt meine Schwester Ida&quot;/&quot;My sister Ida writes to me&quot;). Falke arrives to invite him to the ball (Duet: &quot;Komm mit mir zum Souper&quot;/&quot;Come with me to the supper&quot;). Together, they recall a practical joke which Eisenstein played on Falke a few years ago, for which Falke is secretly planning a light-hearted revenge in kind. Eisenstein bids farewell to Adele and his wife Rosalinde, pretending he is going to prison (Trio: &quot;O Gott, wie rührt mich dies!&quot;/&quot;Oh dear, oh dear, how sorry I am&quot;) but really intending to postpone jail for one day and have fun at the ball.

After Eisenstein leaves, Rosalinde is visited by her former lover, the singing teacher Alfred, who serenades her (&quot;Täubchen, das entflattert ist&quot;/&quot;Dove that has escaped&quot;). Frank, the governor of the prison, arrives to take Eisenstein to jail, and finds Alfred instead. In order not to compromise Rosalinde, Alfred agrees to pretend to be Eisenstein and to accompany Frank. (Finale, drinking song: &quot;Glücklich ist, wer vergisst&quot;/&quot;Happy is he who forgets&quot; followed by Rosalinde&#x27;s defence when Frank arrives: &quot;Mit mir so spät im tête-à-tête&quot;/&quot;In tête-à-tête with me so late&quot;, and Frank&#x27;s invitation: &quot;Mein schönes, großes Vogelhaus&quot;/&quot;My beautiful, large bird-cage&quot;.)

===Act 2===

&quot;A summer house in the Villa Orlofsky&quot;

It transpires that Falke, with Prince Orlofsky&#x27;s permission, is using the ball as a way of getting revenge on Eisenstein. Some time before, after a costume-party, Eisenstein had abandoned Falke, very drunk and dressed in a bat-costume, in the center of town, exposing him to ridicule the next day. As part of his scheme, Falke has invited Frank, Adele, and Rosalinde to come the ball, all concealing their identities as well. Rosalinde pretends to be a masked Hungarian countess, Eisenstein goes by the name &quot;Marquis Renard&quot;, Frank is &quot;Chevalier Chagrin&quot;, and Adele, who has borrowed one of Rosalinde&#x27;s dresses without permission, pretends she is an actress.

The ball is in progress (Chorus: &quot;Ein Souper heut&#x27; uns winkt&quot;/&quot;A supper is before us&quot;) and the Prince welcomes his guests (&quot;Ich lade gern mir Gäste ein&quot;/&quot;I love to invite my friends&quot;). Eisenstein is introduced to Adele, but is confused as to who she really is because of her striking resemblance to his maid. (&quot;Mein Herr Marquis&quot;/&quot;My lord marquis&quot;, sometimes referred to as &quot;Adele&#x27;s Laughing Song&quot;). Frank arrives. He and Eisenstein, who are both posing as Frenchmen, attempt to conceal their identities by repeating common French phrases to each other, to Orlofsky&#x27;s great amusement. Since neither actually knows French, both are fooled. As the party progresses, they both experience alcohol-induced good-feeling and manly camaraderie for each other.

Then Falke introduces the masked Rosalinde to the company. She convinces everyone that she is Hungarian by singing the &quot;Czardas&quot;, a sentimental dancing-song (&quot;Klänge der Heimat&quot;/&quot;Sounds from home&quot;). During an amorous tête-à-tête, Eisenstein tries unsuccessfully to persuade the mystery-woman to unmask. She succeeds in extracting a valuable watch from her husband&#x27;s pocket, something which she can use in the future as evidence of his impropriety. (Watch duet: &quot;Dieser Anstand, so manierlich&quot;/&quot;Her bearing, so well-mannered&quot;). In a rousing finale, Orlofsky makes a toast to champagne, and the company celebrates (The Champagne song: &quot;Im Feuerstrom der Reben&quot;/&quot;In the fire stream of the grape&quot;; followed by the canon: &quot;Brüderlein, Brüderlein und Schwesterlein&quot;/&quot;Brothers, brothers and sisters&quot; and the waltz finale, &quot;Ha, welch ein Fest, welche Nacht voll Freud&#x27;!&quot;/&quot;Ha, what joy, what a night of delight&quot;.) Eisenstein and Frank dash off as the clock strikes six in the morning.

(Note: The &quot;Champagne song&quot;, which is sung by the entire ensemble, should not be confused with the baritone aria &quot;Fin ch&#x27; han dal vino&quot; from &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, which is often called the &quot;Champagne aria&quot;.)

===Act 3===

&quot;In the prison offices of Warden Frank&quot;

The next morning they all find themselves at the prison where the confusion increases and is compounded by the jailer, Frosch, who has profited by Warden Frank&#x27;s absence to become gloriously drunk. Alfred, still in jail in Eisenstein&#x27;s place, irritates the other prisoners by singing operatic arias.

Adele arrives to ask the Chevalier Chagrin (actually Frank) to sponsor her career as an actress, but Frank is not wealthy enough to do this (Melodrama; Couplet of Adele: &quot;Spiel&#x27; ich die Unschuld vom Lande&quot;/&quot;If I play the innocent peasant maid&quot;). Meanwhile, Alfred asks Frosch to summon Dr. Blind to help get him released; Frank agrees to allow this and Dr. Blind arrives. Eisenstein enters and says he has come to serve his sentence. He is surprised when Frank tells him that his cell is already occupied by a man who claims to be Eisenstein and whom Frank had arrested in Eisenstein&#x27;s apartment. Frank further tells Eisenstein that the man he arrested was singing amorous songs to Rosalinde at the time of his arrest, and warmly kissed her goodbye. Enraged, Eisenstein takes Dr. Blind&#x27;s wig and glasses in order to disguise himself and confront the impersonator Alfred, who Eisenstein now believes has cuckolded him. Rosalinde enters. Eisenstein takes off his disguise and accuses her of being unfaithful to him with Alfred. Eisenstein, Rosalinde, and Alfred sing a trio in which Eisenstein angrily claims the right of vengeance (Trio: &quot;Ja, ich bin&#x27;s, den ihr betrogen...Ra-ra-ra-ra-Rache will ich!&quot;/&quot;I&#x27;m the one who was mistreated...Ve-ve-ve-ve-vengeance is mine!&quot;). However, Rosalinde produces his watch, and he realizes that the Hungarian mystery-woman he tried to seduce at Orlofsky&#x27;s party was actually Rosalinde in disguise and that he, not she, is at fault.

Falke enters with all the guests from the party and explains that the whole thing was payback for Eisenstein&#x27;s practical joke on him three years before. Eisenstein is delighted by the prank, and he begs Rosalinde to forgive him for his attempted infidelity. Rosalinde refuses at first and threatens to divorce him, but Eisenstein tells her that his misbehavior was caused by the champagne. She accepts this explanation and immediately forgives him unconditionally. Orlofsky promises to finance Adele&#x27;s acting career, and the company joyfully reprises the &quot;Champagne song&quot; from act 2.

<text>In information theory, an entropy coding (or entropy encoding) is any lossless data compression method that attempts to approach the lower bound declared by Shannon&#x27;s source coding theorem, which states that any lossless data compression method must have an expected code length greater than or equal to the entropy of the source.

More precisely, the source coding theorem states that for any source distribution, the expected code length satisfies formula_1, where formula_2 is the number of symbols in a code word, formula_3 is the coding function, formula_4 is the number of symbols used to make output codes and formula_5 is the probability of the source symbol. An entropy coding attempts to approach this lower bound.

Two of the most common entropy coding techniques are Huffman coding and arithmetic coding.
If the approximate entropy characteristics of a data stream are known in advance (especially for signal compression), a simpler static code may be useful.
These static codes include universal codes (such as Elias gamma coding or Fibonacci coding) and Golomb codes (such as unary coding or Rice coding).

Since 2014, data compressors have started using the asymmetric numeral systems family of entropy coding techniques, which allows combination of the compression ratio of arithmetic coding with a processing cost similar to Huffman coding.

== Entropy as a measure of similarity ==

Besides using entropy coding as a way to compress digital data, an entropy encoder can also be used to measure the amount of similarity between streams of data and already existing classes of data. This is done by generating an entropy coder/compressor for each class of data; unknown data is then classified by feeding the uncompressed data to each compressor and seeing which compressor yields the highest compression. The coder with the best compression is probably the coder trained on the data that was most similar to the unknown data.

<doc id="46683" wikidata="Q80563" url="?curid=46683" title="Amalfi">
<text>Amalfi (, , ) is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Salerno, in the region of Campania, Italy, on the Gulf of Salerno. It lies at the mouth of a deep ravine, at the foot of Monte Cerreto (1,315 metres, 4,314 feet), surrounded by dramatic cliffs and coastal scenery. The town of Amalfi was the capital of the maritime republic known as the Duchy of Amalfi, an important trading power in the Mediterranean between 839 and around 1200.

The town became a popular seaside resort beginning in the Edwardian era, with members of the British upper class spending their winters in Amalfi. Amalfi is included in the UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

==History==

Amalfi began as a maritime power, trading grain from its neighbours, salt from Sardinia and slaves from the interior, and even timber, in exchange for the gold dinars minted in Egypt and Syria, in order to buy the Byzantine silks that it resold in the West. Grain-bearing Amalfi traders enjoyed privileged positions in the Islamic ports, Fernand Braudel notes. The Amalfi tables (&quot;&quot;) provided a maritime code that was widely used by the Christian port cities. Merchants of Amalfi were using gold coins to purchase land in the 9th century, while most of Italy worked in a barter economy. During the late 9th century, long-distance trade revived between Amalfi and Gaeta with Byzantine, the latter which benefited from a flourishing trade network with the Arabs. Karl Marx in &quot;The German Ideology&quot; acknowledged the role of Amalfi in the very beginning of European mercantile Capitalism. 

An independent republic from the 7th century until 1073, Amalfi extracted itself from Byzantine vassalage in 839 and first elected a duke in 958; it rivalled Pisa and Genoa in its domestic prosperity and maritime importance before the rise of the Republic of Venice. In spite of some devastating setbacks it had a population of some 70,000 to 80,000 reaching a peak about the turn of the millennium, during the reign of Duke Manso (966–1004). Under his line of dukes, Amalfi remained independent, except for a brief period of Salernitan dependency under Guaimar IV.

In 1073, the republic fell to the Norman countship of Apulia, but was granted many rights. A prey to the Normans who encamped in the south of Italy, it became one of their principal posts. However, in 1131, it was reduced by Roger II of Sicily, who had been refused the keys to its citadel. The Holy Roman Emperor Lothair, fighting in favour of Pope Innocent II against Roger, who sided with the Antipope Anacletus, took him prisoner in 1133, assisted by forty-six Pisan ships. The Pisans, commercial rivals of the Amalfitani, sacked the city; Lothair claimed as part of the booty a copy of the Pandects of Justinian which was found there.

In 1135 and 1137, it was taken by the Pisans and rapidly declined in importance, though the Amalfian Laws were recognized in the Mediterranean until 1570. A tsunami in 1343 destroyed the port and lower town, and Amalfi never recovered to anything more than local importance.

In medieval culture Amalfi was famous for its flourishing schools of law and mathematics. Flavio Gioia, traditionally considered the first to introduce the mariner&#x27;s compass to Europe, is said to have been a native of Amalfi.

Amalfi has a long history of catering to visitors, with two former monasteries being converted to hotels at a relatively early date, the Luna Convento in the second decade of the 19th century and the Cappuccini Convento in the 1880s. Celebrated visitors to Amalfi included the composer Richard Wagner and the playwright Henrik Ibsen, both of whom completed works while staying in Amalfi. 

==Main sights==
Amalfi occupied a high position in medieval architecture; its cathedral of Sant&#x27;Andrea (Saint Andrew, 11th century), the campanile, the convent of the Cappuccini, founded by the Amalfitan Cardinal Pietro Capuano, richly represent the artistic movement prevailing in Southern Italy at the time of the Normans, with its tendency to blend the Byzantine style with the forms and sharp lines of the northern architecture.

===Cathedral===

At the top of a flight of steps, Saint Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral (Duomo) overlooks the Piazza Duomo, the heart of Amalfi. The cathedral dates back to the 11th century; its interior is adorned in the late Baroque style with a nave and two aisles divided by 20 columns. The façade of the cathedral is Byzantine in style and is adorned with various paintings of saints, including a large fresco of Saint Andrew.

The gold caisson ceiling has four large paintings by Andrea dell&#x27;Asta. They depict the flagellation of Saint Andrew, the miracle of Manna, the crucifixion of Saint Andrew and the Saint on the cross. From the left hand nave there is a flight of stairs which leads to the crypt. These stairs were built in 1203 for Cardinal Pietro Capuano, who, on 18 May 1208, brought Saint Andrew&#x27;s remains to the cathedral from Constantinople.

The bronze statue of Saint Andrew in the cathedral was sculpted by Michelangelo Naccherino, a pupil of Michelangelo; also present are Pietro Bernini marble sculptures of St. Stephen and St. Lawrence.

In 1206, Saint Andrew&#x27;s relics were brought to Amalfi from Constantinople by the Pietro Capuano following the Sack of Constantinople (an event of the 4th Crusade) after the completion of the town&#x27;s cathedral. The cathedral contains a tomb in its crypt that it maintains still holds a portion of the relics of the apostle. A golden reliquary which originally housed his skull and another one used for processions through Amalfi on holy days can also be seen.

===Arsenal of the Maritime Republic (&quot;Gli Arsenali della Repubblica&quot;)===
The structure of the arsenal consists of two large stone-built halls with vaulting supported by repeated pointed arches. The vaulting rests on ten piers, originally there were twenty two, the missing twelve and the structure they supported having been lost to centuries of coastal erosion. The main function of the arsenal was the building, repair and storage of warships. Amalfitan war-galleys were among the largest to be found in the Mediterranean during the Early Middle Ages. The building now contains architectural and sculptural remains, a row-barge used in the Historical Regatta, a number of models of ships and it also acts as a venue for visual art exhibitions. Starting from December 2010, the Ancient Arsenals of Amalfi host the Compass Museum on the premises of the two aisles of the building, which were spared by the Amalfi seaquake of 1343.

===Museum of Handmade Paper (&quot;Museo della Carta&quot;)===
The Museum of Handmade Paper, located in Mill Valley in the northern part of the modern town, celebrates the long-established paper making tradition in Amalfi. The town was one of the first centres of paper making in Europe, the skill having been acquired by the Amalfitans from the Arabs. The museum is housed in an ancient paper mill which was once owned by the Milano family, a family famous in Amalfi for its involvement in the production and manufacture of paper. In 1969 the building was converted into a museum as a result of the will of Nicholas Milano, the mill&#x27;s then owner. The museum contains the machinery and equipment (restored and fully functional) that was once used to manufacture paper by hand.

==Culture==
The Amalfi coast is famed for its production of Limoncello liqueur and the area is a known cultivator of lemons. The correct name is &quot;sfusato amalfitano&quot;, and they are typically long and at least double the size of other lemons, with a thick and wrinkled skin and a sweet and juicy flesh without many pips. It is common to see lemons growing in the terraced gardens along the entire Amalfi coast between February and October. Amalfi is also a known maker of a hand-made thick paper which is called &quot;bambagina&quot;. It is exported to many European countries and to America and has been used throughout Italy for wedding invitations, visiting cards and elegant writing paper. The paper has a high quality and has been used by artists such as Giuseppe Leone, who described it: &quot;There is a whole world that the Amalfi paper evokes and an artist who is sensitive to the suggestion of these places is aware that it is unique and exciting&quot;.

Three traditional events draw numerous visitors to Amalfi. First are the feast days of Saint Andrew (25–27 June, and 30 November), celebrating the city&#x27;s patron saint. Then there is &quot;Byzantine New Year&#x27;s Eve&quot; (31 August) celebrating the beginning of the New Year according to the old civil calendar of the Byzantine Empire. The third event is the Historical Regatta (first Sunday in June), a traditional rowing competition among the four best known Italian historical maritime republics: Amalfi, Genoa, Pisa, and Venice. This event is hosted by a different city every year, so it comes to Amalfi once every four years.

==Transportation== 
Amalfi can be reached using the SS163 Amalfitana state road, the SR366 regional road and the SP252 provincial road.

The port of Amalfi has passenger connections to Capri, Positano, Maiori, Minori, Cetara, and Salerno.

<doc id="46684" wikidata="Q119702" url="?curid=46684" title="Anne, Queen of Great Britain">
<text>Anne (6 February 1665 – 1 August 1714) was Queen of England, Scotland, and Ireland from 8 March 1702, and Queen of Great Britain and Ireland following the ratification of the Acts of Union 1707 merging the kingdoms of Scotland and England, until her death in 1714.

Anne was born during the reign of her uncle King Charles II. Her father was Charles&#x27;s younger brother and heir presumptive, James, whose suspected Roman Catholicism was unpopular in England. On Charles&#x27;s instructions, Anne and her elder sister Mary were raised as Anglicans. Mary married their Dutch Protestant cousin, William III of Orange, in 1677, and Anne married the Lutheran Prince George of Denmark in 1683. On Charles&#x27;s death in 1685, James succeeded to the throne, but just three years later he was deposed in the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Mary and William became joint monarchs. Although the sisters had been close, disagreements over Anne&#x27;s finances, status, and choice of acquaintances arose shortly after Mary&#x27;s accession and they became estranged. William and Mary had no children. After Mary&#x27;s death in 1694, William reigned alone until his own death in 1702, when Anne succeeded him.

During her reign, Anne favoured moderate Tory politicians, who were more likely to share her Anglican religious views than their opponents, the Whigs. The Whigs grew more powerful during the course of the War of the Spanish Succession, until 1710 when Anne dismissed many of them from office. Her close friendship with Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, turned sour as the result of political differences. The Duchess took revenge with an unflattering description of the Queen in her memoirs, which was widely accepted by historians until Anne was reassessed in the late 20th century.

Anne was plagued by poor health throughout her life, and from her thirties she grew increasingly ill and obese. Despite 17 pregnancies, she died without surviving issue and was the last monarch of the House of Stuart. Under the Act of Settlement 1701, which excluded all Catholics, she was succeeded by her second cousin George I of the House of Hanover.

==Early life==

Anne was born at 11:39 p.m. on 6 February 1665 at St James&#x27;s Palace, London, the fourth child and second daughter of the Duke of York (later King James II and VII), and his first wife, Anne Hyde. Her father was the younger brother of King Charles II, who ruled the three kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland, and her mother was the daughter of Lord Chancellor Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon. At her Anglican baptism in the Chapel Royal at St James&#x27;s, her older sister, Mary, was one of her godparents, along with the Duchess of Monmouth and the Archbishop of Canterbury, Gilbert Sheldon. Anne&#x27;s parents had eight children, but Anne and Mary were the only ones to survive into adulthood.

As a child, Anne had an eye condition, which manifested as excessive watering known as &quot;defluxion&quot;. For medical treatment, she was sent to France, where she lived with her paternal grandmother, Henrietta Maria of France, at the Château de Colombes near Paris. Following her grandmother&#x27;s death in 1669, Anne lived with an aunt, Henrietta Anne, Duchess of Orléans. On the sudden death of her aunt in 1670, Anne returned to England. Her mother died the following year.

As was traditional in the royal family, Anne and her sister were brought up separated from their father in their own establishment at Richmond in Surrey. On the instructions of Charles II, they were raised as Protestants, despite their father being a Catholic. Placed in the care of Colonel Edward and Lady Frances Villiers, their education was focused on the teachings of the Anglican church. Henry Compton, Bishop of London, was appointed as Anne&#x27;s preceptor.

Around 1671, Anne first made the acquaintance of Sarah Jennings, who later became her close friend and one of her most influential advisors. Jennings married John Churchill (the future Duke of Marlborough) in about 1678. His sister, Arabella, was the Duke of York&#x27;s mistress, and he was to be Anne&#x27;s most important general.

In 1673, James&#x27;s conversion to Catholicism became public, and he married a Catholic princess, Mary of Modena, who was only six and a half years older than Anne. Charles II had no legitimate children, and so James was next in the line of succession, followed by his two surviving daughters from his first marriage, Mary and Anne—as long as he had no son. Over the next ten years, Mary of Modena had ten children, but all were either stillborn or died in infancy, leaving Mary and Anne second and third in the line of succession after their father. There is every indication that, throughout Anne&#x27;s early life, she and her stepmother got on well together, and James was a conscientious and loving father.

== Marriage ==

In November 1677, Anne&#x27;s sister, Mary, married their Dutch first cousin William III of Orange at St James&#x27;s Palace, but Anne could not attend the wedding because she was confined to her room with smallpox. By the time she recovered, Mary had already left for her new life in the Netherlands. Lady Frances Villiers contracted the disease and died. Anne&#x27;s aunt Lady Henrietta Hyde (the wife of Laurence Hyde) was appointed as her new governess. A year later, Anne and her stepmother visited Mary in Holland for two weeks.

The Duke and Duchess of York retired to Brussels in March 1679 in the wake of anti-Catholic hysteria fed by the Popish Plot, and Anne visited them from the end of August. In October, all three returned to Britain: Anne to England, and her father and stepmother to Scotland. She joined them at Holyrood Palace in Edinburgh from July 1681 until May 1682. It was her last journey outside England.

Anne&#x27;s second cousin George of Hanover visited London for three months from December 1680, sparking rumours of a potential marriage between them. Historian Edward Gregg dismissed the rumours as ungrounded, as her father was essentially exiled from court, and the Hanoverians planned to marry George to his first cousin Sophia Dorothea of Celle as part of a scheme to unite the Hanoverian inheritance. Other rumours claimed she was courted by Lord Mulgrave, although he denied it. Nevertheless, as a result of the gossip, he was temporarily dismissed from court.

With George of Hanover out of contention as a suitor for Anne, King Charles looked elsewhere for an eligible prince who would be welcomed as a groom by his Protestant subjects but also acceptable to his Catholic ally Louis XIV of France. The Danes were Protestant allies of the French, and Louis XIV was keen on an Anglo-Danish alliance to contain the power of the Dutch. A marriage treaty between Anne and Prince George of Denmark, younger brother of King Christian V, was negotiated by Anne&#x27;s uncle Laurence Hyde, who had been made Earl of Rochester, and the English Secretary of State for the Northern Department, Robert Spencer, 2nd Earl of Sunderland. Anne and George were second cousins once removed. Anne&#x27;s father consented to the marriage eagerly because it diminished the influence of his other son-in-law, William of Orange, who was naturally unhappy at the match.

Bishop Compton officiated at Anne and George&#x27;s wedding on 28 July 1683 in the Chapel Royal at St James&#x27;s Palace. Although it was an arranged marriage, they were faithful and devoted partners. They were given a set of buildings, known as the Cockpit, in the Palace of Whitehall as their London residence, and Sarah Churchill was appointed one of Anne&#x27;s ladies of the bedchamber. Within months of the marriage, Anne was pregnant, but the baby was stillborn in May. Anne recovered at the spa town of Tunbridge Wells, and over the next two years, gave birth to two daughters in quick succession: Mary and Anne Sophia.

== Accession of James II ==
When Charles II died in 1685, Anne&#x27;s father became King James II of England and VII of Scotland. To the consternation of the English people, James began to give Catholics military and administrative offices, in contravention of the Test Acts that were designed to prevent such appointments. Anne shared the general concern, and continued to attend Anglican services. As her sister Mary lived in the Netherlands, Anne and her family were the only members of the royal family attending Protestant religious services in England. When her father tried to get Anne to baptise her youngest daughter into the Catholic faith, Anne burst into tears. &quot;[T]he doctrine of the Church of Rome is wicked and dangerous&quot;, she wrote to her sister, &quot;their ceremonies—most of them—plain downright idolatry.&quot; Anne became estranged from her father and stepmother, as James moved to weaken the Church of England&#x27;s power.

In early 1687, within a matter of days, Anne miscarried, her husband caught smallpox, and their two young daughters died of the same infection. Lady Rachel Russell wrote that George and Anne had &quot;taken [the deaths] very heavily ... Sometimes they wept, sometimes they mourned in words; then sat silent, hand in hand; he sick in bed, and she the carefullest nurse to him that can be imagined.&quot; Later that year, she suffered another stillbirth.

Public alarm at James&#x27;s Catholicism increased when his wife, Mary of Modena, became pregnant for the first time since James&#x27;s accession. In letters to her sister Mary, Anne raised suspicions that the Queen was faking her pregnancy in an attempt to introduce a false heir. She wrote, &quot;they will stick at nothing, be it never so wicked, if it will promote their interest ... there may be foul play intended.&quot; Anne had another miscarriage in April 1688, and left London to recuperate in the spa town of Bath.

Anne&#x27;s stepmother gave birth to a son, James Francis Edward Stuart, on 10 June 1688, and a Catholic succession became more likely. Anne was still at Bath, so she did not witness the birth, which fed the belief that the child was spurious. Anne may have left the capital deliberately to avoid being present, or because she was genuinely ill, but it is also possible that James desired the exclusion of all Protestants, including his daughter, from affairs of state. &quot;I shall never now be satisfied&quot;, Anne wrote to her sister Mary, &quot;whether the child be true or false. It may be it is our brother, but God only knows ... one cannot help having a thousand fears and melancholy thoughts, but whatever changes may happen you shall ever find me firm to my religion and faithfully yours.&quot;

To dispel rumours of a supposititious child, James had 40 witnesses to the birth attend a Privy Council meeting, but Anne claimed she could not attend because she was pregnant (which she was not) and then declined to read the depositions because it was &quot;not necessary&quot;.

== Glorious Revolution ==

William of Orange invaded England on 5 November 1688 in an action known as the Glorious Revolution, which ultimately deposed King James. Forbidden by James to pay Mary a projected visit in the spring of 1687, Anne corresponded with her and was aware of the plans to invade. On the advice of the Churchills, she refused to side with James after William landed and instead wrote to William on 18 November declaring her approval of his action. Churchill abandoned the unpopular King James on the 24th. George followed suit that night, and in the evening of the following day James issued orders to place Sarah Churchill under house arrest at St James&#x27;s Palace. Anne and Sarah fled from Whitehall by a back staircase, putting themselves under the care of Bishop Compton. They spent one night in his house, and subsequently arrived at Nottingham on 1 December. Two weeks later and escorted by a large company, Anne arrived at Oxford, where she met George in triumph. &quot;God help me!&quot;, lamented James on discovering Anne&#x27;s desertion on 26 November, &quot;Even my children have forsaken me.&quot; On 19 December, Anne returned to London, where she was at once visited by William. James fled to France on the 23rd. Anne showed no concern at the news of her father&#x27;s flight, and instead merely asked for her usual game of cards. She justified herself by saying that she &quot;was used to play and never loved to do anything that looked like an affected constraint&quot;.

In January 1689, a Convention Parliament assembled in England and declared that James had effectively abdicated when he fled, and that the thrones of England and Ireland were therefore vacant. The Parliament or Estates of Scotland took similar action, and William and Mary were declared monarchs of all three realms. The Bill of Rights 1689 and Claim of Right Act 1689 settled the succession. Anne and her descendants were to be in the line of succession after William and Mary, and they were to be followed by any descendants of William by a future marriage. On 24 July 1689, Anne gave birth to a son, Prince William, Duke of Gloucester, who, though ill, survived infancy. As William and Mary had no children, it looked as though Anne&#x27;s son would eventually inherit the Crown.

== William and Mary ==
Soon after their accession, William and Mary rewarded John Churchill by granting him the Earldom of Marlborough and George was made Duke of Cumberland. Anne requested the use of Richmond Palace and a parliamentary allowance. William and Mary refused the first, and unsuccessfully opposed the latter, both of which caused tension between the two sisters. Anne&#x27;s resentment grew worse when William refused to allow George to serve in the military in an active capacity. The new king and queen feared that Anne&#x27;s financial independence would weaken their influence over her and allow her to organise a rival political faction. From around this time, at Anne&#x27;s request she and Sarah Churchill, Lady Marlborough, began to call each other the pet names Mrs. Morley and Mrs. Freeman, respectively, to facilitate a relationship of greater equality between the two when they were alone. In January 1692, suspecting that Marlborough was secretly conspiring with James&#x27;s followers, the Jacobites, William and Mary dismissed him from all his offices. In a public show of support for the Marlboroughs, Anne took Sarah to a social event at the palace, and refused her sister&#x27;s request to dismiss Sarah from her household. Lady Marlborough was subsequently removed from the royal household by the Lord Chamberlain, and Anne angrily left her royal lodgings and took up residence at Syon House, the home of the Duke of Somerset. Anne was stripped of her guard of honour; courtiers were forbidden to visit her, and civic authorities were instructed to ignore her. In April, Anne gave birth to a son who died within minutes. Mary visited her, but instead of offering comfort took the opportunity to berate Anne once again for her friendship with Sarah. The sisters never saw each other again. Later that year, Anne moved to Berkeley House in Piccadilly, London, where she had a stillborn daughter in March 1693.

When Mary died of smallpox in 1694, William continued to reign alone. Anne became his heir apparent, since any children he might have by another wife were assigned to a lower place in the line of succession, and the two reconciled publicly. He restored her previous honours, allowed her to reside in St James&#x27;s Palace, and gave her Mary&#x27;s jewels, but excluded her from government and refrained from appointing her regent during his absences abroad. Three months later, William restored Marlborough to his offices. With Anne&#x27;s restoration at court, Berkeley House became a social centre for courtiers who had previously avoided contact with Anne and her husband.

According to James, Anne wrote to him in 1696 requesting his permission to succeed William, and thereafter promising to restore the Crown to James&#x27;s line at a convenient opportunity; he declined to give his consent. She was probably trying to ensure her own succession by attempting to prevent a direct claim by James.

=== Act of Settlement ===

Anne&#x27;s final pregnancy ended on 25 January 1700 with a stillbirth. She had been pregnant at least 17 times over as many years, and had miscarried or given birth to stillborn children at least 12 times. Of her five liveborn children, four died before the age of two. Anne experienced bouts of &quot;gout&quot; (pains in her limbs and eventually stomach and head) from at least 1698. Based on her foetal losses and physical symptoms, she may have had systemic lupus erythematosus, or antiphospholipid syndrome. Alternatively, pelvic inflammatory disease could explain why the onset of her symptoms roughly coincided with her penultimate pregnancy. Other suggested causes of her failed pregnancies are listeriosis, diabetes, intrauterine growth retardation, and rhesus incompatibility. Rhesus incompatibility, however, generally worsens with successive pregnancies, and so does not fit the pattern of Anne&#x27;s pregnancies, as her only son to survive infancy, Prince William, Duke of Gloucester, was born after a series of stillbirths. Experts also believe syphilis, porphyria and pelvic deformation to be unlikely as the symptoms are incompatible with her medical history.

Anne&#x27;s gout rendered her lame for much of her later life. Around the court, she was carried in a sedan chair, or used a wheelchair. Around her estates, she used a one-horse chaise, which she drove herself &quot;furiously like Jehu and a mighty hunter like Nimrod&quot;. She gained weight as a result of her sedentary lifestyle; in Sarah&#x27;s words, &quot;she grew exceeding gross and corpulent. There was something of majesty in her look, but mixed with a gloominess of soul&quot;. Sir John Clerk, 1st Baronet, described her in 1706:
Anne&#x27;s sole surviving child, the Duke of Gloucester, died at age 11 on 30 July 1700. She and her husband were &quot;overwhelmed with grief&quot;. Anne ordered her household to observe a day of mourning every year on the anniversary of his death. With William childless and Gloucester dead, Anne was the only person remaining in the line of succession established by the Bill of Rights 1689. To address the succession crisis and preclude a Catholic restoration, the Parliament of England enacted the Act of Settlement 1701, which provided that, failing the issue of Anne and of William III by any future marriage, the Crown of England and Ireland would go to Sophia, Electress of Hanover, and her Protestant descendants. Sophia was the granddaughter of James VI and I through his daughter Elizabeth, who was the sister of Anne&#x27;s grandfather Charles I. Over 50 Catholics with stronger claims were excluded from the line of succession. Anne&#x27;s father died in September 1701. His widow, the former queen, wrote to Anne to inform her that her father forgave her and to remind her of her promise to seek the restoration of his line, but Anne had already acquiesced to the line of succession created by the Act of Settlement.

== Reign ==
Anne became queen upon the death of King William III on 8 March 1702, and was immediately popular. In her first speech to the English Parliament, on 11 March, she distanced herself from her late Dutch brother-in-law and said, &quot;As I know my heart to be entirely English, I can very sincerely assure you there is not anything you can expect or desire from me which I shall not be ready to do for the happiness and prosperity of England.&quot;

Soon after her accession, Anne appointed her husband Lord High Admiral, giving him nominal control of the Royal Navy. Anne gave control of the army to Lord Marlborough, whom she appointed Captain-General. Marlborough also received numerous honours from the Queen; he was created a Knight of the Garter and was elevated to the rank of duke. The Duchess of Marlborough was appointed Groom of the Stool, Mistress of the Robes, and Keeper of the Privy Purse.

Anne was crowned on St George&#x27;s Day, 23 April 1702. Affected by gout, she was carried to Westminster Abbey in an open sedan chair, with a low back to permit her train to flow out behind her. On 4 May, England became embroiled in the War of the Spanish Succession, in which England, Austria, and the Dutch Republic fought against France and Bourbon Spain. Charles II of Spain had died childless in 1700, and the succession was disputed by two claimants: the Habsburg Archduke Charles of Austria and the Bourbon Philip, Duke of Anjou.

She took a lively interest in affairs of state, and was a patron of theatre, poetry and music. She subsidised George Frideric Handel with £200 a year. She sponsored high-quality medals as rewards for political or military achievements. They were produced at the Mint by Isaac Newton and John Croker. She knighted Newton when she visited Cambridge in 1705.

=== Acts of Union ===

While Ireland was subordinate to the English Crown and Wales formed part of the kingdom of England, Scotland remained an independent sovereign state with its own parliament and laws. The Act of Settlement 1701, passed by the English Parliament, applied in the kingdoms of England and Ireland but not Scotland, where a strong minority wished to preserve the Stuart dynasty and its right of inheritance to the throne. Anne had declared it &quot;very necessary&quot; to conclude a union of England and Scotland in her first speech to the English Parliament, and a joint Anglo-Scots commission met at her former residence, the Cockpit, to discuss terms in October 1702. The negotiations broke up in early February 1703 having failed to reach an agreement. The Estates of Scotland responded to the Act of Settlement by passing the Act of Security, which gave the Estates the power, if the Queen had no further children, to choose the next Scottish monarch from among the Protestant descendants of the royal line of Scotland. The individual chosen by the Estates could not be the same person who came to the English throne, unless England granted full freedom of trade to Scottish merchants. At first, Anne withheld royal assent to the act, but she granted it the following year when the Estates threatened to withhold supply, endangering Scottish support for England&#x27;s wars.
In its turn, the English Parliament responded with the Alien Act 1705, which threatened to impose economic sanctions and declare Scottish subjects aliens in England, unless Scotland either repealed the Act of Security or moved to unite with England. The Estates chose the latter option; the English Parliament agreed to repeal the Alien Act, and new commissioners were appointed by Queen Anne in early 1706 to negotiate the terms of a union. The articles of union approved by the commissioners were presented to Anne on 23 July 1706 and ratified by the Scottish and English Parliaments on 16 January and 6 March 1707, respectively. Under the Acts of Union, England and Scotland were united into a single kingdom called Great Britain, with one parliament, on 1 May 1707. A consistent and ardent supporter of union despite opposition on both sides of the border, Anne attended a thanksgiving service in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. The Scot Sir John Clerk, 1st Baronet, who also attended, wrote, &quot;nobody on this occasion appeared more sincerely devout and thankful than the Queen herself&quot;.

=== Two-party politics ===

Anne&#x27;s reign was marked by the further development of a two-party system. In general, the Tories were supportive of the Anglican church and favoured the landed interest of the country gentry, while the Whigs were aligned with commercial interests and Protestant Dissenters. As a committed Anglican, Anne was inclined to favour the Tories. Her first ministry was predominantly Tory, and contained such High Tories as Daniel Finch, 2nd Earl of Nottingham, and her uncle Laurence Hyde, 1st Earl of Rochester. It was headed by Lord Treasurer Lord Godolphin and Anne&#x27;s favourite the Duke of Marlborough, who were considered moderate Tories, along with the Speaker of the House of Commons, Robert Harley.

Anne supported the Occasional Conformity Bill of 1702, which was promoted by the Tories and opposed by the Whigs. The bill aimed to disqualify Protestant Dissenters from public office by closing a loophole in the Test Acts, legislation that restricted public office to Anglican conformists. The existing law permitted nonconformists to take office if they took Anglican communion once a year. Anne&#x27;s husband was placed in an unfortunate position when Anne forced him to vote for the bill, even though, being a Lutheran, he was an occasional conformist himself. The Whigs successfully blocked the bill for the duration of the parliamentary session. Anne reinstituted the traditional religious practice of touching for the king&#x27;s evil that had been eschewed by William as papist superstition. After the Great Storm of 1703, Anne declared a general fast to implore God &quot;to pardon the crying sins of this nation which had drawn down this sad judgement&quot;. The Occasional Conformity Bill was revived in the wake of the storm, but Anne withheld support, fearing its reintroduction was a ruse to cause a political quarrel. Once again it failed. A third attempt to introduce the bill as an amendment to a money bill in November 1704 was also thwarted.

The Whigs vigorously supported the War of the Spanish Succession and became even more influential after the Duke of Marlborough won a great victory at the Battle of Blenheim in 1704. Many of the High Tories, who opposed British involvement in the land war against France, were removed from office. Godolphin, Marlborough, and Harley, who had replaced Nottingham as Secretary of State for the Northern Department, formed a ruling &quot;triumvirate&quot;. They were forced to rely more and more on support from the Whigs, and particularly from the Whig Junto—Lords Somers, Halifax, Orford, Wharton and Sunderland—whom Anne disliked. Sarah, the Duchess of Marlborough, incessantly badgered the Queen to appoint more Whigs and reduce the power of the Tories, whom she considered little better than Jacobites, and the Queen became increasingly discontented with her.

In 1706, Godolphin and the Marlboroughs forced Anne to accept Lord Sunderland, a Junto Whig and the Marlboroughs&#x27; son-in-law, as Harley&#x27;s colleague as Secretary of State for the Southern Department. Although this strengthened the ministry&#x27;s position in Parliament, it weakened the ministry&#x27;s position with the Queen, as Anne became increasingly irritated with Godolphin and with her former favourite, the Duchess of Marlborough, for supporting Sunderland and other Whig candidates for vacant government and church positions. The Queen turned for private advice to Harley, who was uncomfortable with Marlborough and Godolphin&#x27;s turn towards the Whigs. She also turned to Abigail Hill, a woman of the bedchamber whose influence grew as Anne&#x27;s relationship with Sarah deteriorated. Abigail was related to both Harley and the Duchess, but was politically closer to Harley, and acted as an intermediary between him and the Queen.

The division within the ministry came to a head on 8 February 1708, when Godolphin and the Marlboroughs insisted that the Queen had to either dismiss Harley or do without their services. When the Queen seemed to hesitate, Marlborough and Godolphin refused to attend a cabinet meeting. Harley attempted to lead business without his former colleagues, and several of those present including Charles Seymour, Duke of Somerset refused to participate until they returned. Her hand forced, the Queen dismissed Harley.

The following month, Anne&#x27;s Catholic half-brother, James Francis Edward Stuart, attempted to land in Scotland with French assistance in an attempt to establish himself as king. Anne withheld royal assent from the Scottish Militia Bill 1708 in case the militia raised in Scotland was disloyal and sided with the Jacobites. She was the last British sovereign to veto a parliamentary bill, although her action was barely commented upon at the time. The invasion fleet never landed and was chased away by British ships commanded by Sir George Byng. As a result of the Jacobite invasion scare, support for the Tories fell and the Whigs were able to secure a majority in the 1708 British general election.

The Duchess of Marlborough was angered when Abigail moved into rooms at Kensington Palace that Sarah considered her own, though she rarely if ever used them. In July 1708, she came to court with a bawdy poem written by a Whig propagandist, probably Arthur Maynwaring, that implied a lesbian relationship between Anne and Abigail. The Duchess wrote to Anne telling her she had damaged her reputation by conceiving &quot;a great passion for such a woman ... strange and unaccountable&quot;. Sarah thought Abigail had risen above her station, writing &quot;I never thought her education was such as to make her fit company for a great queen. Many people have liked the humour of their chambermaids and have been very kind to them, but &#x27;tis very uncommon to hold a private correspondence with them and put them upon the foot of a friend.&quot; While some modern commentators have concluded Anne was a lesbian, most have rejected this analysis. In the opinion of Anne&#x27;s biographers, she considered Abigail nothing more than a trusted servant and was a woman of strong traditional beliefs who was devoted to her husband.

At a thanksgiving service for a victory at the Battle of Oudenarde, Anne did not wear the jewels that Sarah had selected for her. At the door of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, they had an argument that culminated in Sarah offending the Queen by telling her to be quiet. Anne was dismayed. When Sarah forwarded an unrelated letter from her husband to Anne, with a covering note continuing the argument, Anne wrote back pointedly, &quot;After the commands you gave me on the thanksgiving day of not answering you, I should not have troubled you with these lines, but to return the Duke of Marlborough&#x27;s letter safe into your hands, and for the same reason do not say anything to that, nor to yours which enclosed it.&quot;

=== Death of Prince George ===

Anne was devastated by Prince George&#x27;s death in October 1708, and it proved a turning point in her relationship with the Duchess of Marlborough. The Duchess arrived at Kensington Palace shortly before George died, and after his death insisted that Anne leave Kensington for St James&#x27;s Palace against her wishes. Anne resented the Duchess&#x27;s intrusive actions, which included removing a portrait of George from the Queen&#x27;s bedchamber and then refusing to return it in the belief that it was natural &quot;to avoid seeing of papers or anything that belonged to one that one loved when they were just dead&quot;.

The Whigs used George&#x27;s death to their own advantage. The leadership of the Admiralty was unpopular among the Whig leaders, who had blamed Prince George and his deputy George Churchill (who was Marlborough&#x27;s brother) for mismanagement of the navy. With Whigs now dominant in Parliament, and Anne distraught at the loss of her husband, they forced her to accept the Junto leaders Lords Somers and Wharton into the cabinet. Anne, however, insisted on carrying out the duties of Lord High Admiral herself, without appointing a member of the government to take George&#x27;s place. Undeterred, the Junto demanded the appointment of the Earl of Orford, another member of the Junto and one of the prince&#x27;s leading critics, as First Lord of the Admiralty. Anne appointed the moderate Earl of Pembroke, on 29 November 1708. Pressure mounted on Pembroke, Godolphin and the Queen from the dissatisfied Junto Whigs, and Pembroke resigned after less than a year in office. Another month of arguments followed before the Queen finally consented to put Orford in control of the Admiralty as First Lord in November 1709.

Sarah continued to berate Anne for her friendship with Abigail and, in October 1709, Anne wrote to the Duke of Marlborough asking that his wife &quot;leave off teasing &amp; tormenting me &amp; behave herself with the decency she ought both to her friend and Queen&quot;. On Maundy Thursday 6 April 1710, Anne and Sarah saw each other for the last time. According to Sarah, the Queen was taciturn and formal, repeating the same phrases—&quot;Whatever you have to say you may put in writing&quot; and &quot;You said you desired no answer, and I shall give you none&quot;—over and over.

=== War of the Spanish Succession ===

As the expensive War of the Spanish Succession grew unpopular, so did the Whig administration. The impeachment of Henry Sacheverell, a high church Tory Anglican who had preached anti-Whig sermons, led to further public discontent. Anne thought Sacheverell ought to be punished for questioning the Glorious Revolution, but that his punishment should only be a mild one to prevent further public commotion. In London, riots broke out in support of Sacheverell, but the only troops available to quell the disturbances were Anne&#x27;s guards, and Secretary of State Sunderland was reluctant to use them and leave the Queen less protected. Anne declared God would be her guard and ordered Sunderland to redeploy her troops. In line with Anne&#x27;s views, Sacheverell was convicted, but his sentence—suspension of preaching for three years—was so light as to render the trial a mockery.

The Queen, increasingly disdainful of the Marlboroughs and her ministry, finally took the opportunity to dismiss Sunderland in June 1710. Godolphin followed in August. The Junto Whigs were removed from office, although Marlborough, for the moment, remained as commander of the army. In their place, she appointed a new ministry headed by Harley, which began to seek peace with France. Unlike the Whigs, Harley and his ministry were ready to compromise by giving Spain to the Bourbon claimant, Philip of Anjou, in return for commercial concessions. In the parliamentary elections that soon followed his appointment, Harley, aided by government patronage, secured a large Tory majority. In January 1711, Anne forced Sarah to resign her court offices, and Abigail took over as Keeper of the Privy Purse. Harley was stabbed by a disgruntled French refugee, the Marquis de Guiscard, in March, and Anne wept at the thought he would die. He recovered slowly. Godolphin&#x27;s death from natural causes in September 1712 reduced Anne to tears; she blamed their estrangement on the Marlboroughs.

The elder brother of Archduke Charles, Emperor Joseph I, died in April 1711 and Charles succeeded him in Austria, Hungary and the Holy Roman Empire. To also give him the Spanish throne was no longer in Britain&#x27;s interests, but the proposed Peace of Utrecht submitted to Parliament for ratification did not go as far as the Whigs wanted to curb Bourbon ambitions. In the House of Commons, the Tory majority was unassailable, but the same was not true in the House of Lords. The Whigs secured the support of the Earl of Nottingham against the treaty by promising to support his Occasional Conformity bill. Seeing a need for decisive action to erase the anti-peace majority in the House of Lords, and seeing no alternative, Anne reluctantly created twelve new peers, even though such a mass creation of peers was unprecedented. Abigail&#x27;s husband, Samuel Masham, was made a baron, although Anne protested to Harley that she &quot;never had any design to make a great lady of [Abigail], and should lose a useful servant&quot;. On the same day, Marlborough was dismissed as commander of the army. The peace treaty was ratified and Britain&#x27;s military involvement in the War of the Spanish Succession ended.

By signing the Treaty of Utrecht, Louis XIV of France recognised the Hanoverian succession in Britain. Nevertheless, gossip that Anne and her ministers favoured the succession of her half-brother rather than the Hanoverians continued, despite Anne&#x27;s denials in public and in private. The rumours were fed by her consistent refusals to permit any of the Hanoverians to visit or move to England, and by the intrigues of Harley and the Tory Secretary of State Lord Bolingbroke, who were in separate and secret discussions with her half-brother about a possible Stuart restoration until early 1714.

=== Death ===
Anne was unable to walk between January and July 1713. At Christmas, she was feverish, and lay unconscious for hours, leading to rumours of her impending death. She recovered, but was seriously ill again in March. By July, Anne had lost confidence in Harley; his secretary recorded that Anne told the cabinet &quot;that he neglected all business; that he was seldom to be understood; that when he did explain himself, she could not depend upon the truth of what he said; that he never came to her at the time she appointed; that he often came drunk; [and] last, to crown all, he behaved himself towards her with ill manner, indecency and disrespect.&quot; On 27 July 1714, during Parliament&#x27;s summer recess, she dismissed Harley as Lord Treasurer. Despite failing health, which her doctors blamed on the emotional strain of matters of state, she attended two late-night cabinet meetings that failed to determine Harley&#x27;s successor. A third meeting was cancelled when she became too ill to attend. She was rendered unable to speak by a stroke on 30 July 1714, the anniversary of Gloucester&#x27;s death, and on the advice of the Privy Council handed the treasurer&#x27;s staff of office to Whig grandee Charles Talbot, 1st Duke of Shrewsbury.

Anne died around 7:30 a.m. on 1 August 1714. John Arbuthnot, one of her doctors, thought her death was a release from a life of ill-health and tragedy; he wrote to Jonathan Swift, &quot;I believe sleep was never more welcome to a weary traveller than death was to her.&quot; She was buried beside her husband and children in the Henry VII Chapel on the South Aisle of Westminster Abbey on 24 August.

=== Succession ===

The Electress Sophia had died on 28 May, two months before Anne, so the Electress&#x27;s son, George, Elector of Hanover, succeeded pursuant to the Act of Settlement 1701. The possible Catholic claimants, including Anne&#x27;s half-brother, James Francis Edward Stuart, were ignored. The Elector&#x27;s accession was relatively stable: a Jacobite rising in 1715 failed. Marlborough was reinstated, and the Tory ministers were replaced by Whigs.

== Legacy ==

The Duchess of Marlborough &quot;unduly disparaged&quot; Anne in her memoirs, and her prejudiced recollections persuaded many early biographers that Anne was &quot;a weak, irresolute woman beset by bedchamber quarrels and deciding high policy on the basis of personalities&quot;. The Duchess wrote of Anne:

Historians have since viewed Anne more favourably. In his biography of 1980, Edward Gregg presents the Queen as a woman of invincible stubbornness, who was the central figure of her age. Gregg&#x27;s argument depicts her reign as: 

In the opinion of modern historians, traditional assessments of Anne as fat, constantly pregnant, under the influence of favourites, and lacking political astuteness or interest may derive from sexist prejudices against women. Author David Green noted, &quot;Hers was not, as used to be supposed, petticoat government. She had considerable power; yet time and time again she had to capitulate.&quot; Gregg concluded that Anne was often able to impose her will, even though, as a woman in an age of male dominance and preoccupied by her health, her reign was marked by an increase in the influence of ministers and a decrease in the influence of the Crown. She attended more cabinet meetings than any of her predecessors or successors, and presided over an age of artistic, literary, scientific, economic and political advancement that was made possible by the stability and prosperity of her reign. In architecture, Sir John Vanbrugh constructed Blenheim Palace and Castle Howard. Queen Anne-style architecture and Queen Anne-style furniture were named after her. Writers such as Daniel Defoe, Alexander Pope, and Jonathan Swift flourished. Henry Wise laid out new gardens at Blenheim, Kensington, Windsor and St James&#x27;s. The union of England and Scotland, which Anne had fervently supported, created Europe&#x27;s largest free trade area. The political and diplomatic achievements of Anne&#x27;s governments, and the absence of constitutional conflict between monarch and parliament during her reign, indicate that she chose ministers and exercised her prerogatives wisely.

== Titles, styles, honours and arms ==
=== Titles and styles ===
* 6 February 1665 – 28 July 1683: &quot;Her Highness&quot; The Lady Anne
* 28 July 1683 – 8 March 1702: &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot; The Princess Anne of Denmark
* 8 March 1702 – 1 August 1714: &quot;Her Majesty&quot; The Queen

The official style of Anne before 1707 was &quot;Anne, by the Grace of God, Queen of England, Scotland, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, etc.&quot; After the union, her style was &quot;Anne, by the Grace of God, Queen of Great Britain, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, etc.&quot; In line with other monarchs of England between 1340 and 1800, Anne was styled &quot;Queen of France&quot;, but did not actually reign in France.

=== Arms ===
As queen regnant, Anne&#x27;s coat of arms before the union were the Stuart royal arms, in use since 1603: Quarterly; I and IV grandquarterly, Azure three fleurs-de-lis Or (for France) and Gules three lions passant guardant in pale Or (for England); II, Or, a lion rampant within a double tressure flory-counter-flory Gules (for Scotland); III, Azure, a harp Or stringed Argent (for Ireland). In 1702, Anne adopted the motto &quot;semper eadem&quot; (&quot;always the same&quot;), the same motto used by Queen Elizabeth I.
The Acts of Union declared that: &quot;the Ensigns Armorial of the said United Kingdom be such as Her Majesty shall appoint&quot;. In 1707, the union was heraldically expressed by the impalement, or placing side by side in the same quarter, of the arms of England and Scotland, which had previously been in different quarters. The new arms were: Quarterly; I and IV, Gules three lions passant guardant in pale Or (for England) impaling Or a lion rampant within a double tressure flory-counter-flory Gules (for Scotland); II, Azure, three fleurs-de-lis Or (for France); III, Azure, a harp Or stringed Argent (for Ireland). In Scotland, a separate form of arms was used on seals until the Act of Union.

== Pregnancies and issue==
Anne had seventeen pregnancies, of which five were live births. None of her children survived to adulthood.

<text>Charles II (29 May 1630 – 6 February 1685) was King of Scotland from 1649 until 1651 and King of England, Scotland, and Ireland from the 1660 Restoration of the monarchy until his death in 1685.

Charles II was the eldest surviving child of Charles I of England, Scotland and Ireland and Henrietta Maria of France. After Charles I&#x27;s execution at Whitehall on 30 January 1649, at the climax of the English Civil War, the Parliament of Scotland proclaimed Charles II king on 5 February 1649. However, England entered the period known as the English Interregnum or the English Commonwealth with a republican government eventually led by Oliver Cromwell. Cromwell defeated Charles II at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651, and Charles fled to mainland Europe. Cromwell became Lord Protector of England, Scotland and Ireland. Charles spent the next nine years in exile in France, the Dutch Republic and the Spanish Netherlands. A political crisis after Cromwell&#x27;s death in 1658 resulted in the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, and Charles was invited to return to Britain. On 29 May 1660, his 30th birthday, he was received in London to public acclaim. After 1660, all legal documents stating a regnal year did so as if he had succeeded his father as king in 1649.

Charles&#x27;s English Parliament enacted the Clarendon Code, to shore up the position of the re-established Church of England. Charles acquiesced to these new laws even though he favoured a policy of religious tolerance. The major foreign policy issue of his early reign was the Second Anglo-Dutch War. In 1670, he entered into the Treaty of Dover, an alliance with his cousin, King Louis XIV of France. Louis agreed to aid him in the Third Anglo-Dutch War and pay him a pension, and Charles secretly promised to convert to Catholicism at an unspecified future date. Charles attempted to introduce religious freedom for Catholics and Protestant dissenters with his 1672 Royal Declaration of Indulgence, but the English Parliament forced him to withdraw it. In 1679, Titus Oates&#x27;s fabrication of a supposed Popish Plot sparked the Exclusion Crisis when it was revealed that Charles&#x27;s brother and heir presumptive, James, Duke of York, had become a Catholic. The crisis saw the birth of the pro-exclusion Whig and anti-exclusion Tory parties. Charles sided with the Tories and, after the discovery of the Rye House Plot to murder Charles and James in 1683, some Whig leaders were executed or forced into exile. Charles dissolved the English Parliament in 1681 and ruled alone until his death in 1685.

A patron of the arts and sciences, Charles became known for his affability and friendliness, and for allowing his subjects easy access to his person. But he also showed an almost impenetrable reserve, especially concerning his political agendas. His court gained a reputation for moral laxity. Charles&#x27;s marriage to Catherine of Braganza produced no surviving children, but the king acknowledged at least 12 illegitimate children by various mistresses. He was succeeded by his brother James.

== Early life, civil war and exile ==
Charles was born at St James&#x27;s Palace on 29 May 1630, eldest surviving son of Charles I, king of England, Scotland and Ireland, and his wife Henrietta Maria, sister of Louis XIII of France. Charles was their second child (the first being a son born about a year before, who had died within a day). He was baptised on 27 June in the Chapel Royal by William Laud, a future archbishop of Canterbury, and during his infancy was supervised by the Protestant Countess of Dorset. His godparents included his maternal uncle Louis XIII and maternal grandmother, Marie de&#x27; Medici, the Dowager Queen of France, both of whom were Catholics. At birth, Charles automatically became Duke of Cornwall and Duke of Rothesay, and the possessor of several other associated titles. At or around his eighth birthday, he was designated Prince of Wales, though he was never formally invested.

In August 1642, the long-running dispute between Charles I and Parliament culminated in the outbreak of the First English Civil War. In October, Prince Charles and his younger brother James were present at the Battle of Edgehill and spent the next two years based in the Royalist capital of Oxford. In January 1645, Charles was given his own Council and made titular head of Royalist forces in the West Country. By spring 1646, most of the region had been occupied by Parliamentarian forces and Charles went into exile to avoid capture. From Falmouth, he went first to the Isles of Scilly, then to Jersey, and finally to France, where his mother was already living under the protection of his first cousin, the eight-year-old Louis XIV. Charles I surrendered into captivity in May 1646.

During the Second English Civil War in 1648, Charles moved to The Hague, where his sister Mary and his brother-in-law William II, Prince of Orange, seemed more likely to provide substantial aid to the Royalist cause than his mother&#x27;s French relations. Although part of the Parliamentarian fleet defected, it did not reach Scotland in time to join up with the Royalist Engager army led by the Duke of Hamilton before it was defeated at Preston by the New Model Army.

At The Hague, Charles had a brief affair with Lucy Walter, who later falsely claimed that they had secretly married. Her son, James Crofts (afterwards Duke of Monmouth and Duke of Buccleuch), was one of Charles&#x27;s many illegitimate children who became prominent in British society. Despite his son&#x27;s diplomatic efforts to save him, the execution of Charles I took place in January 1649, and England became a republic. On 5 February, the Covenanter Parliament of Scotland proclaimed Charles II as &quot;King of Great Britain, France and Ireland&quot; at the Mercat Cross, Edinburgh, but refused to allow him to enter Scotland unless he agreed to establish Presbyterianism as the state religion in all three of his kingdoms.

When negotiations with the Scots stalled, Charles authorised Lord Montrose to land in the Orkney Islands with a small army to threaten the Scots with invasion, in the hope of forcing an agreement more to his liking. Montrose feared that Charles would accept a compromise, and so chose to invade mainland Scotland anyway. He was captured and executed. Charles reluctantly promised that he would abide by the terms of a treaty agreed between him and the Scots Parliament at Breda, and support the Solemn League and Covenant, which authorised Presbyterian church governance across Britain. Upon his arrival in Scotland on 23 June 1650, he formally agreed to the Covenant; his abandonment of Episcopal church governance, although winning him support in Scotland, left him unpopular in England. Charles himself soon came to despise the &quot;villainy&quot; and &quot;hypocrisy&quot; of the Covenanters. Charles was provided with a Scottish court, and the record of his food and household expenses at Falkland Palace and Perth survives.

Charles&#x27;s alliance with the Scots led to the Anglo-Scottish War of 1650 to 1652. On 3 September 1650, the Covenanters were defeated at Dunbar by a much smaller force commanded by Oliver Cromwell. The Scots were divided between moderate Engagers and the more radical Kirk Party, who even fought each other. Disillusioned by these divisions, Charles rode north to join an Engager force in October, an event which became known as &quot;the Start&quot;, but within two days members of the Kirk Party had recovered him. Nevertheless, the Scots remained Charles&#x27;s best hope of restoration, and he was crowned King of Scotland at Scone Abbey on 1 January 1651. With Cromwell&#x27;s forces threatening Charles&#x27;s position in Scotland, it was decided to mount an attack on England, but many of their most experienced soldiers had been excluded on religious grounds by the Kirk Party, whose leaders also refused to participate, among them Lord Argyll. Opposition to what was primarily a Scottish army meant few English Royalists joined as it moved south, and the invasion ended in defeat at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651. Charles managed to escape and landed in Normandy six weeks later on 16 October, even though there was a reward of £1,000 on his head, anyone caught helping him was at risk of being put to death, and he was difficult to disguise, being over , which was unusually tall for the time.

Under the Instrument of Government passed by Parliament, Cromwell was appointed Lord Protector of England, Scotland and Ireland in 1653, effectively placing the British Isles under military rule. Charles lived a life of leisure at Saint-Germain-en-Laye near Paris, living on a grant from Louis XIV of 600 livres a month. Charles could not obtain sufficient finance or support to mount a serious challenge to Cromwell&#x27;s government. Despite the Stuart family connections through Henrietta Maria and the Princess of Orange, France and the Dutch Republic allied themselves with Cromwell&#x27;s government from 1654, forcing Charles to leave France and turn to Spain for aid, which at that time ruled the Southern Netherlands.

Charles made the Treaty of Brussels with Spain in 1656. This gathered Spanish support for a restoration in return for Charles&#x27;s contribution to the war against France. Charles raised a ragtag army from his exiled subjects; this small, underpaid, poorly-equipped and ill-disciplined force formed the nucleus of the post-Restoration army. The Commonwealth made the Treaty of Paris with France in 1657 to join them in war against Spain in the Netherlands. Royalist supporters in the Spanish force were led by Charles&#x27;s younger brother James, Duke of York. At the Battle of the Dunes in 1658, as part of the larger Spanish force, Charles&#x27;s army of around 2,000 clashed with Commonwealth troops fighting with the French. By the end of the battle Charles&#x27;s force was about 1,000 and with Dunkirk given to the English the prospect of a Royalist expedition to England was dashed.

== Restoration ==

After Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s death in 1658, Charles&#x27;s initial chances of regaining the Crown seemed slim; Cromwell was succeeded as Lord Protector by his son Richard. But the new Lord Protector had little experience of either military or civil administration. In 1659, the Rump Parliament was recalled and Richard Cromwell resigned. During the civil and military unrest that followed, George Monck, the Governor of Scotland, was concerned that the nation would descend into anarchy. Monck and his army marched into the City of London, and forced the Rump Parliament to readmit members of the Long Parliament who had been excluded in December 1648, during Pride&#x27;s Purge. Parliament dissolved itself, and there was a general election for the first time in almost 20 years. The outgoing Parliament defined the electoral qualifications intending to bring about the return of a Presbyterian majority.

The restrictions against royalist candidates and voters were widely ignored, and the elections resulted in a House of Commons that was fairly evenly divided on political grounds between Royalists and Parliamentarians and on religious grounds between Anglicans and Presbyterians. The so-called Convention Parliament assembled on 25 April 1660, and soon afterwards welcomed the Declaration of Breda, in which Charles promised lenience and tolerance. There would be liberty of conscience, and Anglican church policy would not be harsh. He would not exile past enemies nor confiscate their wealth. There would be pardons for nearly all his opponents except the regicides. Above all, Charles promised to rule in cooperation with Parliament. The English Parliament resolved to proclaim Charles king and invite him to return, a message that reached Charles at Breda on 8 May 1660. In Ireland, a convention had been called earlier in the year and had already declared for Charles. On 14 May, he was proclaimed king in Dublin.
Charles set out for England from Scheveningen, arrived in Dover on 25 May 1660 and reached London on 29 May, his 30th birthday. Although Charles and Parliament granted amnesty to nearly all of Cromwell&#x27;s supporters in the Act of Indemnity and Oblivion, 50 people were specifically excluded. In the end nine of the regicides were executed: they were hanged, drawn and quartered, whereas others were given life imprisonment or excluded from office for life. The bodies of Oliver Cromwell, Henry Ireton and John Bradshaw were subjected to posthumous decapitations.

The English Parliament granted Charles an annual income to run the government of £1.2 million, generated largely from customs and excise duties. The grant, however, proved to be insufficient for most of Charles&#x27;s reign. For the most part, the actual revenue was much lower, which led to attempts to economise at court by reducing the size and expenses of the royal household and raising money through unpopular innovations such as the hearth tax.

In the latter half of 1660, Charles&#x27;s joy at the Restoration was tempered by the deaths of his siblings Henry and Mary of smallpox. At around the same time, Anne Hyde, the daughter of Lord Chancellor Edward Hyde, revealed that she was pregnant by Charles&#x27;s brother James, whom she had secretly married. Edward Hyde, who had not known of either the marriage or the pregnancy, was created Earl of Clarendon and his position as Charles&#x27;s favourite minister was strengthened.

=== Clarendon Code ===

The Convention Parliament was dissolved in December 1660, and, shortly after Charles&#x27;s English coronation, the second English Parliament of the reign assembled. Dubbed the Cavalier Parliament, it was overwhelmingly Royalist and Anglican. It sought to discourage non-conformity to the Church of England and passed several acts to secure Anglican dominance. The Corporation Act 1661 required municipal officeholders to swear allegiance; the Act of Uniformity 1662 made the use of the 1662 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; compulsory; the Conventicle Act 1664 prohibited religious assemblies of more than five people, except under the auspices of the Church of England; and the Five Mile Act 1665 prohibited expelled non-conforming clergymen from coming within five miles (8 km) of a parish from which they had been banished. The Conventicle and Five Mile Acts remained in effect for the remainder of Charles&#x27;s reign. The Acts became known as the Clarendon Code, after Lord Clarendon, even though he was not directly responsible for them and even spoke against the Five Mile Act.

The Restoration was accompanied by social change. Puritanism lost its momentum. Theatres reopened after having been closed during the protectorship of Oliver Cromwell, and bawdy &quot;Restoration comedy&quot; became a recognisable genre. Theatre licences granted by Charles required that female parts be played by &quot;their natural performers&quot;, rather than by boys as was often the practice before; and Restoration literature celebrated or reacted to the restored court, which included libertines such as Lord Rochester. Of Charles II, Rochester supposedly said:

To which Charles is reputed to have replied &quot;that the matter was easily accounted for: For that his discourse was his own, his actions were the ministry&#x27;s&quot;.

=== Great Plague and Great Fire ===
In 1665, the Great Plague of London began, peaking in September with up to 7,000 deaths per week. Charles, his family, and the court fled London in July to Salisbury; Parliament met in Oxford. Plague cases ebbed over the winter, and Charles returned to London in February 1666.

After a long spell of hot and dry weather through mid-1666, the Great Fire of London started on 2 September 1666 in Pudding Lane. Fanned by strong winds and fed by wood and fuel stockpiled for winter, the fire destroyed about 13,200 houses and 87 churches, including St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. Charles and his brother James joined and directed the firefighting effort. The public blamed Catholic conspirators for the fire.

== Foreign policy and marriage ==

Since 1640, Portugal had been fighting a war against Spain to restore its independence after a dynastic union of 60 years between the crowns of Spain and Portugal. Portugal had been helped by France, but in the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659 Portugal was abandoned by its French ally. Negotiations with Portugal for Charles&#x27;s marriage to Catherine of Braganza began during his father&#x27;s reign. Upon the restoration, Queen Luísa of Portugal, acting as regent, reopened negotiations with England that resulted in an alliance. On 23 June 1661, a marriage treaty was signed; England acquired Catherine&#x27;s dowry of the port of Tangier in North Africa, the Seven Islands of Bombay in India (which had a major influence on the development of the British Empire), valuable trading privileges in Brazil and the East Indies, religious and commercial freedom in Portugal, and two million Portuguese crowns (equivalent to £300,000 then). Portugal obtained military and naval support against Spain and liberty of worship for Catherine. Catherine journeyed from Portugal to Portsmouth on 13–14 May 1662, but was not visited by Charles there until 20 May. The next day the couple were married at Portsmouth in two ceremonies—a Catholic one conducted in secret, followed by a public Anglican service.

The same year, in an unpopular move, Charles sold Dunkirk to King Louis XIV of France for about £375,000. The channel port, although a valuable strategic outpost, was a drain on Charles&#x27;s limited finances, as it cost the Treasury £321,000 per year.
Before Charles&#x27;s restoration, the Navigation Acts of 1650 had hurt Dutch trade by giving English vessels a monopoly, and had started the First Dutch War (1652–1654). To lay foundations for a new beginning, envoys of the States General appeared in November 1660 with the Dutch Gift. The Second Dutch War (1665–1667) was started by English attempts to muscle in on Dutch possessions in Africa and North America. The conflict began well for the English, with the capture of New Amsterdam (renamed New York in honour of Charles&#x27;s brother James, Duke of York) and a victory at the Battle of Lowestoft, but in 1667 the Dutch launched a surprise attack on England (the Raid on the Medway) when they sailed up the River Thames to where a major part of the English fleet was docked. Almost all of the ships were sunk except for the flagship, &quot;Royal Charles&quot;, which was taken back to the Netherlands as a prize. The Second Dutch War ended with the signing of the Treaty of Breda.

As a result of the Second Dutch War, Charles dismissed Lord Clarendon, whom he used as a scapegoat for the war. Clarendon fled to France when impeached for high treason (which carried the penalty of death). Power passed to five politicians known collectively by a whimsical acronym as the Cabal—the Baron &quot;Clifford&quot;, Earl of &quot;Arlington&quot;, Duke of &quot;Buckingham&quot;, Baron &quot;Ashley&quot; (afterwards Earl of Shaftesbury) and Duke of &quot;Lauderdale&quot;. In fact, the Cabal rarely acted in concert, and the court was often divided between two factions led by Arlington and Buckingham, with Arlington the more successful.

In 1668, England allied itself with Sweden and with its former enemy the Netherlands to oppose Louis XIV in the War of Devolution. Louis made peace with the Triple Alliance, but he continued to maintain his aggressive intentions towards the Netherlands. In 1670, Charles, seeking to solve his financial troubles, agreed to the Treaty of Dover, under which Louis would pay him £160,000 each year. In exchange, Charles agreed to supply Louis with troops and to announce his conversion to Catholicism &quot;as soon as the welfare of his kingdom will permit&quot;. Louis was to provide him with 6,000 troops to suppress those who opposed the conversion. Charles endeavoured to ensure that the Treaty—especially the conversion clause—remained secret. It remains unclear whether Charles ever seriously intended to convert.

Meanwhile, by a series of five charters, Charles granted the East India Company the rights to autonomous government of its territorial acquisitions, to mint money, to command fortresses and troops, to form alliances, to make war and peace, and to exercise both civil and criminal jurisdiction over its possessions in the Indies. Earlier in 1668 he leased the islands of Bombay to the company for a nominal sum of £10 paid in gold. The Portuguese territories that Catherine brought with her as a dowry proved too expensive to maintain; Tangier was abandoned in 1684. In 1670, Charles granted control of the entire Hudson Bay drainage basin to the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company by royal charter, and named the territory Rupert&#x27;s Land, after his cousin Prince Rupert of the Rhine, the company&#x27;s first governor.

== Conflict with Parliament ==
Although previously favourable to the Crown, the Cavalier Parliament was alienated by the king&#x27;s wars and religious policies during the 1670s. In 1672, Charles issued the Royal Declaration of Indulgence, in which he purported to suspend all penal laws against Catholics and other religious dissenters. In the same year, he openly supported Catholic France and started the Third Anglo-Dutch War.

The Cavalier Parliament opposed the Declaration of Indulgence on constitutional grounds by claiming that the king had no right to arbitrarily suspend laws passed by Parliament. Charles withdrew the Declaration, and also agreed to the Test Act, which not only required public officials to receive the sacrament under the forms prescribed by the Church of England, but also later forced them to denounce transubstantiation and the Catholic Mass as &quot;superstitious and idolatrous&quot;. Clifford, who had converted to Catholicism, resigned rather than take the oath, and died shortly after, possibly from suicide. By 1674, England had gained nothing from the Anglo-Dutch War, and the Cavalier Parliament refused to provide further funds, forcing Charles to make peace. The power of the Cabal waned, and that of Clifford&#x27;s replacement Lord Danby grew.
Queen Catherine was unable to produce an heir; her four pregnancies had ended in miscarriages and stillbirths in 1662, February 1666, May 1668, and June 1669. Charles&#x27;s heir presumptive was therefore his unpopular Catholic brother, James, Duke of York. Partly to assuage public fears that the royal family was too Catholic, Charles agreed that James&#x27;s daughter Mary should marry the Protestant William of Orange. In 1678, Titus Oates, who had been alternately an Anglican and Jesuit priest, falsely warned of a &quot;Popish Plot&quot; to assassinate the king, even accusing the queen of complicity. Charles did not believe the allegations, but ordered his chief minister Lord Danby to investigate. While Danby seems to have been rightly sceptical of Oates&#x27;s claims, the Cavalier Parliament took them seriously. The people were seized with an anti-Catholic hysteria; judges and juries across the land condemned the supposed conspirators; numerous innocent individuals were executed.

Later in 1678, the House of Commons impeached Danby for high treason. Although much of the nation had sought war with Catholic France, Charles had secretly negotiated with Louis XIV, trying to reach an agreement under which England would remain neutral in return for money. Danby had publicly professed that he was hostile to France, but had reservedly agreed to abide by Charles&#x27;s wishes. Unfortunately for him, the House of Commons failed to view him as a reluctant participant in the scandal, instead believing that he was the author of the policy. To save Danby from the impeachment trial, Charles dissolved the Cavalier Parliament in January 1679.

The new English Parliament, which met in March of the same year, was quite hostile to Charles. Many members feared that he had intended to use the standing army to suppress dissent or impose Catholicism. However, with insufficient funds voted by Parliament, Charles was forced to gradually disband his troops. Having lost the support of Parliament, Danby resigned his post of Lord High Treasurer, but received a pardon from the king. In defiance of the royal will, the House of Commons declared that the dissolution of Parliament did not interrupt impeachment proceedings, and that the pardon was therefore invalid. When the House of Lords attempted to impose the punishment of exile—which the Commons thought too mild—the impeachment became stalled between the two Houses. As he had been required to do so many times during his reign, Charles bowed to his opponents&#x27; wishes, committing Danby to the Tower of London, in which he was held for another five years.

== Science ==

In Charles&#x27;s early childhood, William Cavendish, Earl of Newcastle, was governor of the royal household and Brian Duppa, the Dean of Christ Church, Oxford, was his tutor. Neither man thought that the study of science subjects was appropriate for a future king, and Newcastle even advised against studying any subject too seriously. However, as Charles grew older, the surgeon William Harvey was appointed his tutor. He was famous for his work on blood circulation in the human body and already held the position of physician to Charles I; his studies were to influence Charles&#x27;s own attitude to science. As the king&#x27;s chief physician, Harvey accompanied Charles I to the Battle of Edgehill and, although some details are uncertain, he had charge of Prince Charles and the Duke of York in the morning, but the two boys were back with the king for the start of battle. Later in the afternoon, with their father concerned for their safety, the two princes left the battlefield accompanied by Sir W. Howard and his pensioners.

During his exile, in France, Charles continued his education, including physics, chemistry and mathematics. His tutors included the cleric John Earle, well known for his satirical book &quot;Microcosmographie&quot;, with whom he studied Latin and Greek, and Thomas Hobbes, the philosopher and author of &quot;Leviathan&quot;, with whom he studied mathematics. In France, Charles assisted his childhood friend, the Earl of Buckingham, with his experiments in chemistry and alchemy, with the Earl convinced he was close to producing the philosopher&#x27;s stone. Although some of Charles&#x27;s studies, while abroad, may have helped to pass the time, on his return to England he was already knowledgeable in the mathematics of navigation and was a competent chemist. Such was his knowledge of naval architecture that he was able to participate in technical discussions on the subject with Samuel Pepys, William Petty and John Evelyn.

The new concepts and discoveries being found at this time fascinated Charles, not only in science and medicine, but in topics such as botany and gardening. A French traveller, Sorbier, while visiting the English court, was astonished by the extent of the king&#x27;s knowledge. The king freely indulged in his many interests, including astronomy, which had been stimulated by a visit to Gresham College, in October 1660, to see the telescopes made by the astronomer Sir Paul Neile. Charles was so impressed by what he saw that he ordered his own 36&#x27; telescope, which he had installed in the Privy Garden at Whitehall. He would invite his friends and acquaintances to view the heavens through his new telescope and, in May 1661, Evelyn describes his visit to the Garden, with several other scientists, to view Saturn&#x27;s rings. Charles also had a laboratory installed in Whitehall, within easy access to his bedroom.

From the beginning of his reign, Charles appointed experts to assist him in his scientific pursuits. These included: Timothy Clarke, a celebrated anatomist, who performed some dissections for the king; Robert Morison as his chief botanist (Charles had his own botanical garden); Edmund Dickinson, a chemist and alchemist, who was tasked with carrying out experiments in the king&#x27;s laboratory; Sir Thomas Williams, who was skillful in compounding and inventing medicines, some of which were prepared in the royal presence; and Nicasius le Febure (or Nicolas LeFevre), who was invited to England as royal professor of chemistry and apothecary to the king&#x27;s household. Evelyn visited his laboratory with the king.

In addition to his many other interests, the king was fascinated by clock mechanisms and had clocks distributed all around Whitehall, including seven of them in his bedroom. Robert Bruce (later Earl of Ailesbury), a Gentleman of the Bedchamber, complained that the continual noise of the clocks chiming disturbed his sleep, whenever it was necessary for him to stay close by to the king. Also, Charles had a sundial installed in the Privy Garden, by which he could set his personal pocket watch. (For a while, the king personally recorded the performance of the latest spring-balance watch, presented to him by Robert Hooke.)

In 1662, Charles was pleased to grant a royal charter to a group of scientists and others who had established a formal society in 1660 to give a more academic and learned approach to science and to conduct experiments in physics and mathematics. Sir Robert Moray, a member of Charles&#x27;s court, played an important part in achieving this outcome, and he was to be the first president of this new Royal Society. Over the years, Moray was an important go-between for Charles and the Society, and his standing with the king was so high that he was given access to the royal laboratory to perform his own experiments there.

Charles never attended a Society meeting, but he remained aware of the activities there from his discussions with Society members, especially Moray. In addition, Robert Boyle gave him a private viewing of the Boyle/Hooke air-pump, which was used at many of the Wednesday meetings. However, Charles preferred experiments that had an immediate practical outcome and he laughed at the efforts of the Society members &quot;to weigh air&quot;. He seemed unable to grasp the significance of the basic laws of physics being established at that time, including Boyle&#x27;s Law and Hooke&#x27;s Law and the concept of atmospheric pressure and the barometer and the importance of air for the support of life.

Although Charles lost interest in the activities of the society, he continued to support scientific and commercial endeavours. He founded the Mathematical School at Christ&#x27;s Hospital in 1673 and, two years later, following concerns over French advances in astronomy, he founded the Royal Observatory at Greenwich. He maintained an interest in chemistry and regularly visited his private laboratory. There, dissections observed by the king were occasionally carried out. Pepys noted in his diary that on the morning of Friday, 15 January 1669, while he was walking to Whitehall, he met the king, who invited him to view his chemistry laboratory. Pepys confessed to finding what he saw there beyond him.

Charles developed painful gout in later life which limited the daily walks that he took regularly when younger. His keenness was now channelled to his laboratory where he would devote himself to his experiments for hours at a time, sometimes helped by Moray. Charles was particularly interested in alchemy, which he had first encountered many years earlier during his exile with the Duke of Buckingham. Charles resumed his experiments with mercury and would spend whole mornings attempting to distill it. Heating mercury in an open crucible releases mercury vapour, which is toxic and may have contributed to his later ill health.

== Later years ==
Charles faced a political storm over his brother James, a Catholic, being next in line to the throne. The prospect of a Catholic monarch was vehemently opposed by the 1st Earl of Shaftesbury (a former member of the Cabal, which had fallen apart in 1673). Lord Shaftesbury&#x27;s power base was strengthened when the House of Commons of 1679 introduced the Exclusion Bill, which sought to exclude the Duke of York from the line of succession. Some even sought to confer the Crown on the Protestant Duke of Monmouth, the eldest of Charles&#x27;s illegitimate children. The &quot;Abhorrers&quot;—those who thought the Exclusion Bill was abhorrent—were named Tories (after a term for dispossessed Irish Catholic bandits), while the &quot;Petitioners&quot;—those who supported a petitioning campaign in favour of the Exclusion Bill—were called Whigs (after a term for rebellious Scottish Presbyterians).

===Absolute monarch===
Fearing that the Exclusion Bill would be passed, and bolstered by some acquittals in the continuing Plot trials, which seemed to him to indicate a more favourable public mood towards Catholicism, Charles dissolved the English Parliament, for a second time that year, in mid-1679. Charles&#x27;s hopes for a more moderate Parliament were not fulfilled; within a few months he had dissolved Parliament yet again, after it sought to pass the Exclusion Bill. When a new Parliament assembled at Oxford in March 1681, Charles dissolved it for a fourth time after just a few days. During the 1680s, however, popular support for the Exclusion Bill ebbed, and Charles experienced a nationwide surge of loyalty. Lord Shaftesbury was prosecuted (albeit unsuccessfully) for treason in 1681 and later fled to Holland, where he died. For the remainder of his reign, Charles ruled without Parliament.

Charles&#x27;s opposition to the Exclusion Bill angered some Protestants. Protestant conspirators formulated the Rye House Plot, a plan to murder him and the Duke of York as they returned to London after horse races in Newmarket. A great fire, however, destroyed Charles&#x27;s lodgings at Newmarket, which forced him to leave the races early, thus inadvertently avoiding the planned attack. News of the failed plot was leaked. Protestant politicians such as the Earl of Essex, Algernon Sydney, Lord Russell and the Duke of Monmouth were implicated in the plot. Essex slit his own throat while imprisoned in the Tower of London; Sydney and Russell were executed for high treason on very flimsy evidence; and the Duke of Monmouth went into exile at the court of William of Orange. Lord Danby and the surviving Catholic lords held in the Tower were released and the king&#x27;s Catholic brother, James, acquired greater influence at court. Titus Oates was convicted and imprisoned for defamation.

Thus through the last years of Charles&#x27;s reign, his approach towards his opponents changed, and he was compared by Whigs to the contemporary Louis XIV of France, with his form of government in those years termed &quot;slavery&quot;. Many of them were prosecuted and their estates seized, with Charles replacing judges and sheriffs at will and packing juries to achieve conviction. To destroy opposition in London, Charles first disenfranchised many Whigs in the 1682 municipal elections, and in 1683 the London charter was forfeited. In retrospect, the use of the judicial system by Charles (and later his brother and heir James) as a tool against opposition helped establish the idea of separation of powers between the judiciary and the Crown in Whig thought.

=== Death ===
Charles suffered a sudden apoplectic fit on the morning of 2 February 1685, and died four days later at the Palace of Whitehall, at 11:45 am, aged 54. The suddenness of his illness and death led to suspicion of poison in the minds of many, including one of the royal doctors, but a more modern medical analysis has held that the symptoms of his final illness are similar to those of uraemia, a clinical syndrome due to kidney dysfunction. Charles had a laboratory among his many interests where, prior to his illness, he had been experimenting with mercury. Mercuric poisoning can produce irreversible kidney damage, but the case for that being a cause of his death is unproven. In the days between his collapse and his death, Charles endured a variety of torturous treatments, including bloodletting, purging and cupping, in the hope of effecting a recovery, which may have exacerbated his uraemia through dehydration, rather than helping to alleviate it.

On his deathbed, Charles asked his brother, James, to look after his mistresses: &quot;be well to Portsmouth, and let not poor Nelly starve&quot;. He told his courtiers, &quot;I am sorry, gentlemen, for being such a time a-dying&quot;, and expressed regret at his treatment of his wife. On the last evening of his life he was received into the Catholic Church, in the presence of Father John Huddleston, though the extent to which he was fully conscious or committed, and with whom the idea originated, is unclear. He was buried in Westminster Abbey &quot;without any manner of pomp&quot; on 14 February.

Charles was succeeded by his brother James II and VII.

== Legacy ==
The escapades of Charles after his defeat at the Battle of Worcester remained important to him throughout his life. He delighted and bored listeners with tales of his escape for many years. Numerous accounts of his adventures were published, particularly in the immediate aftermath of the Restoration. Though not averse to his escape being ascribed to divine providence, Charles himself seems to have delighted most in his ability to sustain his disguise as a man of ordinary origins, and to move unrecognised through his realm. Ironic and cynical, Charles took pleasure in stories that demonstrated the undetectable nature of any inherent majesty he possessed.

Charles had no legitimate children, but acknowledged a dozen by seven mistresses, including five by Barbara Villiers, Lady Castlemaine, for whom the Dukedom of Cleveland was created. His other mistresses included Moll Davis, Nell Gwyn, Elizabeth Killigrew, Catherine Pegge, Lucy Walter and Louise de Kérouaille, Duchess of Portsmouth. As a result, in his lifetime he was often nicknamed &quot;Old Rowley&quot;, the name of his favourite racehorse, notable as a stallion.

Charles&#x27;s subjects resented paying taxes that were spent on his mistresses and their children, many of whom received dukedoms or earldoms. The present Dukes of Buccleuch, Richmond, Grafton and St Albans descend from Charles in unbroken male line. Charles II is an ancestor of both King Charles III&#x27;s first wife, Diana, Princess of Wales, and his second wife, Queen Camilla. Charles and Diana&#x27;s son, William, Prince of Wales, is likely to be the first British monarch descended from Charles II.

Charles&#x27;s eldest son, the Duke of Monmouth, led a rebellion against James II, but was defeated at the Battle of Sedgemoor on 6 July 1685, captured and executed. James was eventually dethroned in 1688, in the course of the Glorious Revolution.

In the words of his contemporary John Evelyn, &quot;a prince of many virtues and many great imperfections, debonair, easy of access, not bloody or cruel&quot;. John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester, wrote more lewdly of Charles:

Looking back on Charles&#x27;s reign, Tories tended to view it as a time of benevolent monarchy whereas Whigs perceived it as a terrible despotism. Professor Ronald Hutton summarises a polarised historiography:

Hutton says Charles was a popular king in his own day and a &quot;legendary figure&quot; in British history.

The anniversary of the Restoration (which was also Charles&#x27;s birthday)—29 May—was recognised in England until the mid-nineteenth century as Oak Apple Day, after the Royal Oak in which Charles hid during his escape from the forces of Oliver Cromwell. Traditional celebrations involved the wearing of oak leaves but these have now died out. Charles II is depicted extensively in art, literature and media. Charleston, South Carolina, and South Kingstown, Rhode Island, are named after him. King Charles&#x27;s Island and Charles Island are previous names of both Floreana Island and Española Island in the Galapagos Archipelago, both in his honour.

== Titles, styles, honours and arms ==
=== Titles and styles ===
The official style of Charles II was &quot;Charles the Second, by the Grace of God, King of England, Scotland, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, etc.&quot; The claim to France was only nominal, and had been asserted by every English monarch since Edward III, regardless of the amount of French territory actually controlled.

=== Honours ===
* KG: Knight of the Garter, &quot;21 May 1638&quot;

=== Arms ===
Charles&#x27;s coat of arms as Prince of Wales was the royal arms (which he later inherited), differenced by a label of three points Argent. His arms as monarch were: Quarterly, I and IV Grandquarterly, Azure three fleurs-de-lis Or (for France) and Gules three lions passant guardant in pale Or (for England); II Or a lion rampant within a double tressure flory-counter-flory Gules (for Scotland); III Azure a harp Or stringed Argent (for Ireland).

==Issue==
By Lucy Walter (c. 1630 – 1658):

* James Crofts, later Scott (1649–1685), created Duke of Monmouth (1663) in England and Duke of Buccleuch (1663) in Scotland. Monmouth was born nine months after Walter and Charles II first met, and was acknowledged as his son by Charles II, but James II suggested that he was the son of another of her lovers, Colonel Robert Sidney, rather than Charles. Lucy Walter had a daughter, Mary Crofts, born after James in 1651, but Charles II was not the father, since he and Walter parted in September 1649.

By Elizabeth Killigrew (1622–1680), daughter of Sir Robert Killigrew, married Francis Boyle, 1st Viscount Shannon, in 1660:

* Charlotte Jemima Henrietta Maria FitzRoy (1650–1684), married firstly James Howard and secondly William Paston, 2nd Earl of Yarmouth

By Catherine Pegge:

* Charles FitzCharles (1657–1680), known as &quot;Don Carlo&quot;, created Earl of Plymouth (1675)
* Catherine FitzCharles (born 1658; she either died young or became a nun at Dunkirk)

By Barbara Villiers (1641–1709), wife of Roger Palmer, 1st Earl of Castlemaine, and created Duchess of Cleveland in her own right:

* Lady Anne Palmer (Fitzroy) (1661–1722), married Thomas Lennard, 1st Earl of Sussex. She may have been the daughter of Roger Palmer, but Charles accepted her.
* Charles Fitzroy (1662–1730), created Duke of Southampton (1675), became 2nd Duke of Cleveland (1709)
* Henry Fitzroy (1663–1690), created Earl of Euston (1672), Duke of Grafton (1675)
* Charlotte Fitzroy (1664–1717), married Edward Lee, 1st Earl of Lichfield
* George Fitzroy (1665–1716), created Earl of Northumberland (1674), Duke of Northumberland (1678)
* (Barbara (Benedicta) Fitzroy (1672–1737) – She was probably the child of John Churchill, later Duke of Marlborough, who was another of Cleveland&#x27;s many lovers, and was never acknowledged by Charles as his own daughter.)

By Nell Gwyn (1650–1687):

* Charles Beauclerk (1670–1726), created Duke of St Albans (1684)
* James, Lord Beauclerk (1671–1680)

By Louise Renée de Penancoet de Kérouaille (1649–1734), created Duchess of Portsmouth in her own right (1673):

* Charles Lennox (1672–1723), created Duke of Richmond (1675) in England and Duke of Lennox (1675) in Scotland.

By Mary &#x27;Moll&#x27; Davis, courtesan and actress of repute:

* Lady Mary Tudor (1673–1726), married Edward Radclyffe, 2nd Earl of Derwentwater; after Edward&#x27;s death, she married Henry Graham (of Levens), and upon his death she married James Rooke.

Other probable mistresses include:

* Christabella Wyndham
* Hortense Mancini, Duchess of Mazarin
* Winifred Wells – one of Queen Catherine&#x27;s Maids of Honour
* Jane Roberts – the daughter of a clergyman
* Mrs Knight – a famous singer
* Elizabeth, Countess of Falmouth – the widow of Charles Berkeley, 1st Earl of Falmouth
* Elizabeth Fitzgerald, Countess of Kildare

Letters claiming that Marguerite or Margaret de Carteret bore Charles a son named James de la Cloche in 1646 are dismissed by historians as forgeries.

<doc id="46689" wikidata="Q105763" url="?curid=46689" title="Saracen">
<text>Saracen ( ) was a term used both in Greek and Latin writings between the 5th and 15th centuries to refer to the people who lived in and near what was designated by the Romans as Arabia Petraea and Arabia Deserta. The term&#x27;s meaning evolved during its history of usage. During the Early Middle Ages, the term came to be associated with the tribes of Arabia. 

The oldest known source mentioning &quot;Saracens&quot; in relation to Islam dates back to the 7th century, in the Greek-language Christian tract &quot;Doctrina Jacobi&quot;. Among other major events, the tract discusses the Muslim conquest of the Levant, which occurred after the rise of the Rashidun Caliphate following the death of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. The Roman Catholic Church and European Christian leaders used the term during the Middle Ages to refer to Muslims. 

By the 12th century, &quot;Saracen&quot; developed various overlapping definitions, generally conflating peoples and cultures associated with Islam, the Near East and the Abbasid Caliphate. Such an expansion in the meaning of the term had begun centuries earlier among the Byzantine Greeks, as evidenced in documents from the 8th century where &quot;Saracen&quot; is synonymous with &quot;Muslim&quot;. Before the 16th century, &quot;Saracen&quot; was commonly used in Western languages to refer to Muslims, and the terms &quot;Muslim&quot; and &quot;Islam&quot; were generally not used, with a few isolated exceptions. 

The term gradually became obsolete in favor of &quot;Muslim&quot; following the Age of Discovery.

==Early usage and origins==
The Latin term &quot;Saraceni&quot; is of unknown original meaning. There are claims of it being derived from the Semitic triliteral root &quot;šrq&quot; &quot;east&quot; and &quot;šrkt&quot; &quot;tribe, confederation&quot;. Another possible Semitic root is &quot;srq&quot; &quot;to steal, rob, thief&quot;, more specifically from the noun &quot;sāriq&quot; (), pl. &quot;sāriqīn&quot; (), which means &quot;thief, marauder&quot;. In his &quot;Levantine Diary&quot;, covering the years 1699–1740, the Damascene writer Hamad bin Kanan al-Salhi () used the term &quot;sarkan&quot; to mean &quot;travel on a military mission&quot; from the Near East to parts of Southern Europe which were under Ottoman Empire rule, particularly Cyprus and Rhodes. 

Ptolemy&#x27;s 2nd-century work, &quot;Geography&quot;, describes &quot;Sarakēnḗ&quot; () as a region in the northern Sinai Peninsula. Ptolemy also mentions a people called the &quot;Sarakēnoí&quot; () living in the northwestern Arabian Peninsula (near neighbor to the Sinai). Eusebius in his &quot;Ecclesiastical history&quot; narrates an account wherein Pope Dionysius of Alexandria mentions Saracens in a letter while describing the persecution of Christians by the Roman Emperor Decius: &quot;Many were, in the Arabian mountain, enslaved by the barbarous &#x27;sarkenoi&#x27;.&quot; The &quot;Augustan History&quot; also refers to an attack by &quot;Saraceni&quot; on Pescennius Niger&#x27;s army in Egypt in 193, but provides little information as to identifying them. 

Both Hippolytus of Rome and Uranius mention three distinct peoples in Arabia during the first half of the third century: the &quot;Taeni&quot;, the &quot;Saraceni&quot;, and the &quot;Arabes&quot;. The &quot;Taeni&quot;, later identified with the Arab people called &quot;Tayy&quot;, were located around Khaybar (an oasis north of Medina) and also in an area stretching up to the Euphrates. The &quot;Saraceni&quot; were placed north of them. These Saracens, located in the northern Hejaz, were described as people with a certain military ability who were opponents of the Roman Empire and who were classified by the Romans as barbarians. 

The Saracens are described as forming the &quot;equites&quot; from Phoenicia and Thamud. In one document, the defeated enemies of Diocletian&#x27;s campaign in the Syrian Desert are described as Saracens. Other 4th-century military reports make no mention of Arabs, but refer to &quot;Saracen&quot; groups ranging as far east as Mesopotamia who were involved in battles on both the Sasanian and Roman sides. The Saracens were named in the Roman administrative document &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot;, dating from the time of Theodosius I in the 4th century, as comprising distinctive units in the Roman army. They were distinguished in the document from Arabs.

==Medieval usage of the term ==
No later than the early fifth century, Jewish and Christian writers began to equate Saracens with Arabs. Saracens were associated with Ishmaelites (descendants of Abraham&#x27;s firstborn Ishmael) in some strands of Jewish, Christian, and Islamic genealogical thinking. The writings of Jerome (d. 420) are the earliest known version of the claim that Ishmaelites chose to be called Saracens in order to identify with Abraham&#x27;s &quot;free&quot; wife Sarah, rather than as Hagarenes, which would have highlighted their association with Abraham&#x27;s &quot;slave woman&quot; Hagar. This claim was popular during the Middle Ages, but derives more from Paul&#x27;s allegory in the New Testament letter to the Galatians than from historical data. The name &quot;Saracen&quot; was not indigenous among the populations so described but was applied to them by Greco-Roman historians based on Greek place names.

As the Middle Ages progressed, usage of the term in the Latin West changed, but its connotation remained associated with opponents of Christianity, and its exact definition is unclear. In an 8th-century polemical work, the Arab monk John of Damascus criticized the Saracens as followers of a &quot;false&quot; prophet and &quot;forerunner[s] to the Antichrist,&quot; and further connected their name to Ishmael and his expulsion.

By the 12th century, Medieval Europeans used the term &quot;Saracen&quot; as both an ethnic and religious marker. In some Medieval literature, Saracens were equated with Muslims in general and described as dark-skinned, while Christians lighter-skinned. An example is in &quot;The King of Tars&quot;, a medieval romance. &quot;The Song of Roland&quot;, an Old French 11th-century heroic poem, refers to the black skin of Saracens as their only exotic feature.

The term &quot;Saracen&quot; remained in use in the West as a synonym for &quot;Muslim&quot; until the 18th century. When the Age of Discovery commenced, it gradually lost popularity to the newer term &quot;Mohammedan&quot;, which came into usage from at least the 16th century. After this point, &quot;Saracen&quot; enjoyed only sporadic usage (for example, in the phrase &quot;Indo-Saracenic architecture&quot;) before being outmoded entirely. 

In the Wiltshire dialect, the meaning of &quot;Sarsen&quot; (Saracen) was eventually extended to refer to anything regarded as non-Christian, whether Muslim or pagan. From that derived the still current term &quot;sarsen&quot; (a shortening of &quot;Saracen stone&quot;), denoting the kind of stone used by the builders of Stonehenge, long predating Islam. 

===Use in medieval entertainment: Crusade cycle===

The rhyming stories of the Old French &quot;Crusade cycle&quot; were popular with medieval audiences in Northern France, Occitania and Iberia. Beginning in the late 12th century, stories about the sieges of Antioch and Jerusalem gave accounts of battle scenes and suffering, and of Saracen plunder, their silks and gold, and masterfully embroidered and woven tents. From the story of the Frankish knights at the tent of Saracen leader Corbaran:

&lt;poem&gt;The tent was very rich, draped with brilliant silk,
and patterned green silk was thrown over the grass,
with lengths of cut fabric worked with birds and beasts.
The cords with which it was tied are of silk,
and the quilt was sewn with a shining, delicate &quot;samit&quot;.&lt;/poem&gt;

==History==
===The Maghreb===
The Islamic conquest of countries such as Egypt and Syria had allowed the Muslims to create a fleet capable of undermining Byzantine supremacy in the Mediterranean in a relatively short time.

Especially on the Maghreb and Spanish coasts, various emirates had been established where the local component soon merged with the Arab and Berber ones. Each emirate was headed by an emir who, apart from formal subjection to one of the three caliphs who divided the Islamic Empire between themselves between the 8th and 9th centuries (Córdoba, Cairo and Baghdad), were substantially independent. 

===Crete and the return to the western Mediterranean===
The repression of the Umayyad insurrection in al-Andalus was bloody and it is in this period (818) that the mass emigration of Andalusians (so indicated, regardless of ethnic origin and religion) took place along two lines, partly to Morocco and others to Egypt. From here they supported their co-religionists for the 827 Muslim conquest of Sicily. Also in this year, an autonomous Andalusian kingdom was founded in Alexandria, Egypt, which the Abbasid Caliphate put an end to in 825. Then the Andalusians left for the Aegean, where they established the Emirate of Crete, independent and flourishing from a commercial and cultural point of view, as well as powerful from a military point of view, until the Byzantine reconquest in 961.

Crete became the center of numerous military expeditions in the Aegean, in southern Italy, where Traetto was also founded, and Rome was raided in 846, 849 and 876. In the western Mediterranean, due to the weakening of the Carolingian Empire and its fleet, Marseille was raided in 838 and 846, Arles in 842 and 850 and Fréjus in 869. The Muslims established a refuge in the Camargue in these years, as chronicled in the &quot;Annales Bertiniani&quot;, and from there they raged in the Rhône valley.

The Balearic Islands were finally conquered by the Andalusian Umayyad cause in 902. 

===The conquest of Sicily and the incursions into southern Italy===
 

From 827 the Aghlabid emirs of Kairouan, in today&#x27;s Tunisia, began the conquest of Sicily, which took a long time, but which marked the apogee of Saracen rule in the Mediterranean for at least two centuries. The conquest was completed in 902, thanks to the offensive against the Byzantines, who had cut off supplies by conquering Crete (827) and Malta (870). 

The settlement of the Saracens was sometimes also encouraged and supported by local lords, as help in disputes, as in the case of Andrea, consul of Naples, who was harassed by the Lombard prince of Benevento Sico and after turning in vain to Louis the Pious he asked the Saracens for help. The intervention was also requested again by his successor Sicard, with the cities of Amalfi, Sorrento and Gaeta joining the Neapolitans: the Saracens behaved correctly towards the cities of Campania, helping them to defeat the Beneventans and signing peace and trade agreements. In exchange the Neapolitans helped the Saracens during the siege of Messina in 843 and maintained a complicit neutrality when Punta Licosa and the islands of Ischia and Ponza fell under Islamic rule.

Again, the Neapolitans, to weaken Benevento, had invited the Saracens to attack Brindisi in 838, from which they extended to Taranto and Bari, which became the seat of the eponymous emirate from 840 to 871. 

Having defeated a Venetian fleet in the Kvarner Gulf, the Saracens now took advantage of the rivalries between the local powers, acting as masters and now also putting themselves at the service of the unscrupulous Beneventans themselves.

In the year 840, Siconulf, lord of Salerno, fighting with Radelchis and Landulf, lords of Benevento and Capua, called to his aid the Saracens settled in the colony under the Traetto hill, at the mouth of the Garigliano, often and willingly hired by the Duke of Naples, Andrew II. After bloody incursions into some parts of southern Italy, the Saracens found a way to prosper thanks to their raids and their offering themselves as mercenaries to the most diverse Christian lords of the time.

In 843 the Saracens went so far as to destroy Fondi and Monte Cassino, arriving in Ostia and going up the Tiber to reach Rome where they sacked St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in the Vatican and Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls in Rome. 

The gesture prompted a swift reaction against the Saracens. A first attempt to expel the Saracens from southern Italy was made in 866-871 by the emperor and king Louis II, who, having descended into Italy with an army of Franks, Burgundians and Provencals, in addition to the allied troops of Pope Sergius II, of the Doge of Venice, the Duke of Spoleto and that of Naples, he took back Benevento, Capua, Salerno, Bari, destroying Matera and Venosa. 

Now uncontrollable Saracen troops had been hired by Adelchis, Duke of Benevento: he forced the people of Bari to accept the protection of the Berber Khalfun, who as payment was promised nothing less than permission to sack and burn some sacred buildings in the area, but he went so far as to raze the city of Capua to the ground. Ludovico, then in Italy, managed to free Benevento from the mercenaries and pacify the Lombard princes, acting as guarantor for the division of the duchy into the two principalities of Salerno and Benevento and the county of Capua.

The compromise solution did not please Pope Leo IV, who in those years was having Rome surrounded with the &quot;Leonine belt&quot; of walls, as proof of the fear that was still alive, so the pontiff sponsored the formation of a Campanian fleet which in 849 defeated the Saracens off the coast of Ostia. Ludovico, nominated emperor in the meantime, moved towards Bari, also begged by the abbots of Monte Cassino and San Vincenzo al Volturno. In the meantime, an emir reigned in Bari who juggled between the various local powers, without denying the granting, upon payment, of safe conducts for pilgrims who wanted to embark for the Holy Land. He also protected the learned Jewish community of Oria. Expelled for the first time from Bari, a nucleus of them entrenched themselves near Monte Matino (Horace&#x27;s &quot;Mons matinus&quot;) on a hill which therefore took the name of Mount Saraceno on the Gargano. From there they often came down to plunder and burn towns, villages and cities, to desecrate temples and commit all sorts of cruelties and atrocities. Defeated numerous times by different peoples, the Saracens, who fled from the Gargano in 967, fortified themselves in Bari. The campaign against Bari was long and between various negotiations, alliances and treaties it took place from 855 to 871, with the active combat phase in the four years between 867 and 871. The emir Sawdan, who had also sacked the Sanctuary of Monte Sant&#x27;Angelo on the Gargano, was allowed to spend his life in golden captivity by his friend Adelchis, prince of Benevento. But this move turned out to be wrong for the German emperor due to the entry into the scene of the Byzantine emperor Basil I, who frowned upon the intervention in Southern Italy, a territory of Byzantine prerogative for centuries: Basil allied himself with Sawdan and he fomented a revolt of the Lombards of Benevento, who took the emperor prisoner for about two months, while a new Saracen army of twenty thousand men, sent by Kairouan, devastated Calabria and Campania. In 873 Ludovico returned to Campania and defeated the Saracens, but died two years later.

Therefore, the Saracen port of Taranto remained, from which a very rich slave trade took place. It was the Byzantines who recovered Taranto in 876. However, the Saracen raids in the Adriatic did not end with the reconquest of Taranto, indeed in those years the Muslims completed the conquest of Sicily (Syracuse in 878, Taormina in 902). In 882, once again allied with the Campanians, they destroyed the abbeys of San Vincenzo and Montecassino, establishing a nest at the mouth of the Garigliano (Traetto), from which they also held Rome at gunpoint: they were finally expelled only in 915, when the Byzantine empress Zoe Porphyrogenita managed to get the Italian lords to agree on the need to expel the Saracens from the Italian peninsula and began a campaign against them which - thanks to the commitment of Berengar I of Italy, of Pope John X, and of the Dukes of Spoleto and Camerino - reaped the promised fruit. In reality the raids continued, in fact one of the most serious episodes seems to be the new sack of Oria and Taranto which occurred in 925/926, on which occasion the family of the well-known Oritan Jewish scholar Shabbethai Donnolo was captured. 

In 970, they returned again to the Gargano, devastating places (the two Roman cities of Siponto and Matinum were razed to the ground), terrifying the inhabitants in massacres and robberies, who were forced to ask Otto the Great for help. It is on Mount Saraceno, where they were strongly entrenched for years, that the Saracens were defeated and driven from the place by Otto the Great.

In 1002/03 Doge Pietro II Orseolo successfully led a fleet of 100 ships against the Saracens who had been besieging Bari for months. As thanks, the Church of San Marco dei Veneziani was built in old Bari.

From Sicily in the 9th century the Arabs continued to plunder the coasts of southern Italy, also establishing new, occasional bridgeheads, such as at Agropoli or Santa Severina, which, despite the unsuccessful intervention of Otto II (in 982), they lasted for a long time, falling away only after 1036, when the death of the Sicilian emir of al-Akhal led to an irreversible fragmentation of power on the island. 

They were expelled from Sicily in 1071, after ten years of war, by the Normans. 

The chain of coastal towers along the Tyrrhenian coast, connected to each other within sight to exchange signals, had the purpose of spotting pirate ships from afar in order to give the alarm to the defenseless populations in time, but they were only built in the 16th century to protect themselves by the Ottoman fleet. The commonly used name &quot;Saracen Tower&quot; is incorrect.

<doc id="46693" wikidata="Q1425088" url="?curid=46693" title="Sherman Antitrust Act">
<text>The Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 (, ) is a United States antitrust law which prescribes the rule of free competition among those engaged in commerce and consequently prohibits unfair monopolies. It was passed by Congress and is named for Senator John Sherman, its principal author.

The Sherman Act broadly prohibits 1) anticompetitive agreements and 2) unilateral conduct that monopolizes or attempts to monopolize the relevant market. The Act authorizes the Department of Justice to bring suits to enjoin (i.e. prohibit) conduct violating the Act, and additionally authorizes private parties injured by conduct violating the Act to bring suits for treble damages (i.e. three times as much money in damages as the violation cost them). Over time, the federal courts have developed a body of law under the Sherman Act making certain types of anticompetitive conduct per se illegal, and subjecting other types of conduct to case-by-case analysis regarding whether the conduct unreasonably restrains trade.

The law attempts to prevent the artificial raising of prices by restriction of trade or supply. &quot;Innocent monopoly&quot;, or monopoly achieved solely by merit, is legal, but acts by a monopolist to artificially preserve that status, or nefarious dealings to create a monopoly, are not. The purpose of the Sherman Act is not to protect competitors from harm from legitimately successful businesses, nor to prevent businesses from gaining honest profits from consumers, but rather to preserve a competitive marketplace to protect consumers from abuses.

==Background==
In &quot;Spectrum Sports, Inc. v. McQuillan&quot; 506 U.S. 447 (1993) the Supreme Court said:

According to its authors, it was not intended to impact market gains obtained by honest means, by benefiting the consumers more than the competitors. Senator George Hoar of Massachusetts, another author of the Sherman Act, said the following:

At &quot;Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader&quot; 310 U.S. 469, 310 U. S. 492-93 and n. 15:

At &quot;Addyston Pipe and Steel Company v. United States&quot;, 85 F.2d 1, &quot;affirmed&quot;, 175 U. S. 175 U.S. 211;

At &quot;Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States&quot;, 221 U. S. 1, 221 U. S. 54-58.

==Provisions==
===Original text===
The Sherman Act is divided into three sections. Section 1 delineates and prohibits specific means of anticompetitive conduct, while Section 2 deals with end results that are anti-competitive in nature. Thus, these sections supplement each other in an effort to prevent businesses from violating the spirit of the Act, while technically remaining within the letter of the law. Section 3 simply extends the provisions of Section 1 to U.S. territories and the District of Columbia.

====Subsequent legislation expanding its scope====

The Clayton Antitrust Act, passed in 1914, proscribes certain additional activities that had been discovered to fall outside the scope of the Sherman Antitrust Act. The Clayton Antitrust Act added certain practices to the list of impermissible activities:
* price discrimination against competing companies
* conditioning sales on &quot;exclusive dealing&quot; agreements
* one person serving on the board of directors for two competing companies
* mergers and acquisitions that may significantly reduce market competition
The Clayton Antitrust Act specifically states that unions are exempt from this ruling.

The Robinson–Patman Act of 1936 amended the Clayton Act. The amendment proscribed certain anti-competitive practices in which manufacturers engaged in price discrimination against equally-situated distributors.

==Legacy==

The federal government began filing cases under the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890. Some cases were successful and others were not; many took several years to decide, including appeals.

Notable cases filed under the act include:
* &quot;United States v. Workingmen&#x27;s Amalgamated Council of New Orleans&quot; (1893), which was the first to hold that the law applied to labor unions.
* &quot;Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Fuel Co. v. United States&quot; (1902), in which the trust was dissolved
* &quot;Northern Securities Co. v. United States&quot; (1904), which reached the Supreme Court, dissolved the company and set many precedents for interpretation.
* &quot;Hale v. Henkel&quot; (1906) also reached the Supreme Court. Precedent was set for the production of documents by an officer of a company, and the self-incrimination of the officer in his or her testimony to the grand jury. Hale was an officer of the American Tobacco Co.

==Legal application==
===Constitutional basis for legislation===
Congress claimed power to pass the Sherman Act through its constitutional authority to regulate interstate commerce. Therefore, federal courts only have jurisdiction to apply the Act to conduct that restrains or substantially affects either interstate commerce. (Congress also has ultimate authority over economic rules within the District of Columbia and US territories under the 17th enumerated power and the Territorial Clause, respectively.) This requires that the plaintiff must show that the conduct occurred during the flow of interstate commerce or had an appreciable effect on some activity that occurs during interstate commerce.

===Elements===
A Section 1 violation has three elements:

# an agreement;
# which unreasonably restrains competition; and
# which affects interstate commerce.

A Section 2 monopolization violation has two elements:

# the possession of monopoly power in the relevant market; and
# the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power as distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of a superior product, business acumen, or historic accident.

Section 2 also bans attempted monopolization, which has the following elements:

# qualifying exclusionary or anticompetitive acts designed to establish a monopoly
# specific intent to monopolize; and
# dangerous probability of success (actual monopolization).

===Violations &quot;per se&quot; and violations of the &quot;rule of reason&quot;===
Violations of the Sherman Act fall (loosely) into two categories:

* Violations &quot;per se&quot;: These are violations that meet the strict characterization of Section 1 (&quot;agreements, conspiracies or trusts in restraint of trade&quot;). A per se violation requires no further inquiry into the practice&#x27;s actual effect on the market or the intentions of those individuals who engaged in the practice. Conduct characterized as unlawful per se is that which has been found to have a pernicious effect on competition&#x27; or &#x27;lack[s] ... any redeeming virtue Such conduct &quot;would always or almost always tend to restrict competition and decrease output&quot;. When a per se rule is applied (in contrast to a rule of reason analysis), a civil violation of the antitrust laws is found merely by proving that the conduct occurred and that it fell within a per se category. Conduct considered unlawful per se includes horizontal price-fixing, horizontal market division, and concerted refusals to deal.
* Violations of the &quot;rule of reason&quot;: A totality of the circumstances test, asking whether the challenged practice promotes or suppresses market competition. Unlike with per se violations, intent and motive are relevant when predicting future consequences. The rule of reason is said to be the &quot;traditional framework of analysis&quot; to determine whether Section 1 is violated. The court analyzes &quot;facts peculiar to the business, the history of the restraining, and the reasons why it was imposed&quot;, to determine the effect on competition in the relevant product market. A restraint violates Section 1 if it unreasonably restrains trade.
**Quick-look: A &quot;quick look&quot; analysis under the rule of reason may be used when &quot;an observer with even a rudimentary understanding of economics could conclude that the arrangements in question would have an anticompetitive effect on customers and markets&quot;, yet the violation is also not one considered unlawful per se. Taking a &quot;quick look&quot;, economic harm is presumed from the questionable nature of the conduct, and the burden is shifted to the defendant to prove harmlessness or justification. The quick-look became a popular way of disposing of cases where the conduct was in a grey area between illegality &quot;per se&quot; and demonstrable harmfulness under the &quot;rule of reason&quot;.

===Modern trends===
====Inference of conspiracy====
A modern trend has increased difficulty for antitrust plaintiffs as courts have come to hold plaintiffs to increasing burdens of pleading. Under older Section 1 precedent, it was not settled how much evidence was required to show a conspiracy. For example, a conspiracy could be inferred based on parallel conduct, etc. That is, plaintiffs were only required to show that a conspiracy was conceivable. Since the 1970s, however, courts have held plaintiffs to higher standards, giving antitrust defendants an opportunity to resolve cases in their favor before significant discovery under FRCP 12(b)(6). That is, to overcome a motion to dismiss, plaintiffs, under &quot;Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly&quot;, must plead facts consistent with FRCP 8(a) sufficient to show that a conspiracy is plausible (and not merely conceivable or possible). This protects defendants from bearing the costs of antitrust &quot;fishing expeditions&quot;; however it deprives plaintiffs of perhaps their only tool to acquire evidence (discovery).

=====Manipulation of market=====
Second, courts have employed more sophisticated and principled definitions of markets. Market definition is necessary, in rule of reason cases, for the plaintiff to prove a conspiracy is harmful. It is also necessary for the plaintiff to establish the market relationship between conspirators to prove their conduct is within the per se rule.

In early cases, it was easier for plaintiffs to show market relationship, or dominance, by tailoring market definition, even if it ignored fundamental principles of economics. In &quot;U.S. v. Grinnell&quot;, 384 U.S. 563 (1966), the trial judge, Charles Wyzanski, composed the market only of alarm companies with services in every state, tailoring out any local competitors; the defendant stood alone in this market, but had the court added up the entire national market, it would have had a much smaller share of the national market for alarm services that the court purportedly used. The appellate courts affirmed this finding; however, today, an appellate court would likely find this definition to be flawed. Modern courts use a more sophisticated market definition that does not permit as manipulative a definition.

===Monopoly===
Section 2 of the Act forbids monopoly. In Section 2 cases, the court has, again on its own initiative, drawn a distinction between coercive and innocent monopoly. The act is not meant to punish businesses that come to dominate their market passively or on their own merit, only those that intentionally dominate the market through misconduct, which generally consists of conspiratorial conduct of the kind forbidden by Section 1 of the Sherman Act, or Section 3 of the Clayton Act.

===Application of the act outside pure commerce===
While the Act was aimed at regulating businesses, its prohibition of contracts restricting commerce was applied to the activities of labor unions until the 1930s. This is because unions were characterized as cartels as well (cartels of laborers). In 1914 the Clayton Act created exceptions for certain union activities, but the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering&quot; that the actions allowed by the Act were already legal. Congress included provisions in the Norris–La Guardia Act in 1932 to more explicitly exempt organized labor from antitrust enforcement, and the Supreme Court upheld these exemptions in &quot;United States v. Hutcheson&quot; 312 U.S. 219.

==Preemption by Section 1 of state statutes that restrain competition==

To determine whether the Act preempts a state law, courts will engage in a two-step analysis, as set forth by the Supreme Court in &quot;Rice v. Norman Williams Co.&quot;

*First, they will inquire whether the state legislation &quot;mandates or authorizes conduct that necessarily constitutes a violation of the antitrust laws in all cases, or ... places irresistible pressure on a private party to violate the antitrust laws in order to comply with the statute.&quot; &quot;Rice v. Norman Williams Co.&quot;, 458 U.S. 654, 661; see also &quot;324 Liquor Corp. v. Duffy&quot;, 479 U.S. 335 (1987) (&quot;Our decisions reflect the principle that the federal antitrust laws pre-empt state laws authorizing or compelling private parties to engage in anticompetitive behavior.&quot;)
*Second, they will consider whether the state statute is saved from preemption by the state action immunity doctrine (aka Parker immunity). In &quot;California Retail Liquor Dealers Ass&#x27;n v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc.&quot;, 445 U.S. 97, 105 (1980), the Supreme Court established a two-part test for applying the doctrine: &quot;First, the challenged restraint must be one clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy; second, the policy must be actively supervised by the State itself.&quot; Id. (citation and quotation marks omitted).

The antitrust laws allow coincident state regulation of competition. The Supreme Court enunciated the test for determining when a state statute is in irreconcilable conflict with Section 1 of the Sherman Act in Rice v. Norman Williams Co. Different standards apply depending on whether a statute is attacked on its face or for its effects.

A statute can be condemned on its face only when it mandates, authorizes or places irresistible pressure on private parties to engage in conduct constituting a per se violation of Section 1.

If the statute does not mandate conduct violating a per se rule, the conduct is analyzed under the rule of reason, which requires an examination of the conduct&#x27;s actual effects on competition. If unreasonable anticompetitive effects are created, the required conduct violates Section 1 and the statute is in irreconcilable conflict with the Sherman Act. Then statutory arrangement is analyzed to determine whether it qualifies as &quot;state action&quot; and is thereby saved from preemption.

&quot;Rice&quot; sets out guidelines to aid in preemption analysis. Preemption should not occur &quot;simply because in a hypothetical situation a private party&#x27;s compliance with the statute might cause him to violate the antitrust laws&quot;. This language suggests that preemption occurs only if economic analysis determines that the statutory requirements create &quot;an unacceptable and unnecessary risk of anticompetitive effect&quot;, and does not occur simply because it is possible to use the statute in an anticompetitive manner. It should not mean that preemption is impossible whenever both procompetitive and anticompetitive results are conceivable. The per se rule &quot;reflects the judgment that such cases are not sufficiently common or important to justify the time and expense necessary to identify them&quot;.

Another important, yet, in the context of &quot;Rice&quot;, ambiguous guideline regarding preemption by Section 1 is the Court&#x27;s statement that a &quot;state statute is not preempted by the federal antitrust laws simply because the state scheme might have an anticompetitive effect&quot;. The meaning of this statement is clarified by examining the three cases cited in &quot;Rice&quot; to support the statement.

In &quot;New Motor Vehicle Board v. Orrin W. Fox Co.&quot;, automobile manufacturers and retail franchisees contended that the Sherman Act preempted a statute requiring manufacturers to secure the permission of a state board before opening a new dealership if and only if a competing dealer protested. They argued that a conflict existed because the statute permitted &quot;auto dealers to invoke state power for the purpose of restraining intrabrand competition&quot;.

In &quot;Exxon Corp. v. Governor of Maryland&quot;, oil companies challenged a state statute requiring uniform statewide gasoline prices in situations where the Robinson-Patman Act would permit charging different prices. They reasoned that the Robinson-Patman Act is a qualification of our &quot;more basic national policy favoring free competition&quot; and that any state statute altering &quot;the competitive balance that Congress struck between the Robinson-Patman and Sherman Acts&quot; should be preempted.

In both &quot;New Motor Vehicle&quot; and &quot;Exxon&quot;, the Court upheld the statutes and rejected the arguments presented as

This indicates that not every anticompetitive effect warrants preemption. In neither &quot;Exxon&quot; nor &quot;New Motor Vehicle&quot; did the created effect constitute an antitrust violation. The &quot;Rice&quot; guideline therefore indicates that only when the effect unreasonably restrains trade, and is therefore a violation, can preemption occur.

The third case cited to support the &quot;anticompetitive effect&quot; guideline is &quot;Joseph E. Seagram &amp; Sons v. Hostetter&quot;, in which the Court rejected a facial Sherman Act preemption challenge to a statute requiring that persons selling liquor to wholesalers affirm that the price charged was no higher than the lowest price at which sales were made anywhere in the United States during the previous month. Since the attack was a facial one, and the state law required no per se violations, no preemption could occur. The Court also rejected the possibility of preemption due to Sherman Act violations stemming from misuse of the statute. The Court stated that rather than imposing &quot;irresistible economic pressure&quot; on sellers to violate the Sherman Act, the statute &quot;appears firmly anchored to the assumption that the Sherman Act will deter any attempts by the appellants to preserve their ... price level [in one state] by conspiring to raise the prices at which liquor is sold elsewhere in the country&quot;. Thus, &quot;Seagram&quot; indicates that when conduct required by a state statute combines with other conduct that, taken together, constitutes an illegal restraint of trade, liability may be imposed for the restraint without requiring preemption of the state statute.

&quot;Rice v. Norman Williams Co.&quot; supports this misuse limitation on preemption. &quot;Rice&quot; states that while particular conduct or arrangements by private parties would be subject to per se or rule of reason analysis to determine liability, &quot;[t]here is no basis ... for condemning the statute itself by force of the Sherman Act.&quot;

Thus, when a state requires conduct analyzed under the rule of reason, a court must carefully distinguish rule of reason analysis for preemption purposes from the analysis for liability purposes. To analyze whether preemption occurs, the court must determine whether the inevitable effects of a statutory restraint unreasonably restrain trade. If they do, preemption is warranted unless the statute passes the appropriate state action tests. But, when the statutory conduct combines with other practices in a larger conspiracy to restrain trade, or when the statute is used to violate the antitrust laws in a market in which such a use is not compelled by the state statute, the private party might be subjected to antitrust liability without preemption of the statute.

===Evidence from legislative history===
The Act was not intended to regulate existing state statutes regulating commerce within state borders. The House committee, in reporting the bill which was adopted without change, declared:
See also the statement on the floor of the House by Mr. Culberson, in charge of the bill,
And see the statement of Senator Edmunds, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee which reported out the bill in the form in which it passed, that in drafting that bill the committee thought that &quot;we would frame a bill that should be clearly within our constitutional power, that we would make its definition out of terms that were well known to the law already, and would leave it to the courts in the first instance to say how far they could carry it or its particular definitions as applicable to each particular case as the occasion might arise.&quot;

Similarly Senator Hoar, a member of that committee who with Senator Edmunds was in charge of the bill, stated

== Criticism ==

Alan Greenspan, in his essay entitled &quot;Antitrust&quot;, described the Sherman Act as stifling innovation and harming society. &quot;No one will ever know what new products, processes, machines, and cost-saving mergers failed to come into existence, killed by the Sherman Act before they were born. No one can ever compute the price that all of us have paid for that Act which, by inducing less effective use of capital, has kept our standard of living lower than would otherwise have been possible.&quot; Greenspan summarized the nature of antitrust law as &quot;a jumble of economic irrationality and ignorance&quot;. Greenspan at that time was a disciple and friend of Ayn Rand, and he first published &quot;Antitrust&quot; in Rand&#x27;s monthly publication &quot;The Objectivist Newsletter.&quot; Rand, who described herself as &quot;a radical for capitalism&quot;, opposed antitrust law not only on economic grounds but also morally, as a violation of property rights, asserting that the &quot;meaning and purpose&quot; of antitrust law is &quot;the penalizing of ability for being ability, the penalizing of success for being success, and the sacrifice of productive genius to the demands of envious mediocrity&quot;.

In 1890, Representative William E. Mason said &quot;trusts have made products cheaper, have reduced prices; but if the price of oil, for instance, were reduced to one cent a barrel, it would not right the wrong done to people of this country by the trusts which have destroyed legitimate competition and driven honest men from legitimate business enterprise.&quot; Consequently, if the primary goal of the act is to protect consumers, and consumers are protected by lower prices, the act may be harmful if it reduces economy of scale, a price-lowering mechanism, by breaking up big businesses. Mason put small business survival, a justice interest, on a level concomitant with the pure economic rationale of consumer interest.

Economist Thomas DiLorenzo notes that Senator Sherman sponsored the 1890 William McKinley tariff just three months after the Sherman Act, and agrees with &quot;The New York Times&quot; which wrote on October 1, 1890: &quot;That so-called Anti-Trust law was passed to deceive the people and to clear the way for the enactment of this Pro-Trust law relating to the tariff.&quot; The &quot;New York Times&quot; went on to assert that Sherman merely supported this &quot;humbug&quot; of a law &quot;in order that party organs might say ... &#x27;Behold! We have attacked the trusts. The Republican Party is the enemy of all such rings. Dilorenzo writes: &quot;Protectionists did not want prices paid by consumers to fall. But they also understood that to gain political support for high tariffs they would have to assure the public that industries would not combine to increase prices to politically prohibitive levels. Support for both an antitrust law and tariff hikes would maintain high prices while avoiding the more obvious bilking of consumers.&quot;

Robert Bork was well known for his outspoken criticism of the antitrust regime. Another conservative legal scholar and judge, Richard Posner of the Seventh Circuit, does not condemn the entire regime, but expresses concern with the potential that it could be applied to create inefficiency, rather than to avoid inefficiency. Posner further believes, along with a number of others, including Bork, that genuinely inefficient cartels and coercive monopolies, the target of the act, would be self-corrected by market forces, making the strict penalties of antitrust legislation unnecessary. Conversely, liberal U.S. Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas criticized the judiciary for interpreting and enforcing the antitrust law unequally: &quot;From the beginning it [the Sherman Act] has been applied by judges hostile to its purposes, friendly to the empire builders who wanted it emasculated ... trusts that were dissolved reintegrated in new forms ... It is ironic that the Sherman Act was truly effective in only one respect, and that was when it was applied to labor unions. Then the courts read it with a literalness that never appeared in their other decisions.&quot;

According to a 2018 study in the journal &quot;Public Choice&quot;, &quot;Senator John Sherman of Ohio was motivated to introduce an antitrust bill in late 1889 partly as a way of enacting revenge on his political rival, General and former Governor Russell Alger of Michigan, because Sherman believed that Alger personally had cost him the presidential nomination at the 1888 Republican national convention ... Sherman was able to pursue his revenge motive by combining it with the broader Republican goals of preserving high tariffs and attacking the trusts.&quot;

<doc id="46696" wikidata="Q6723361" url="?curid=46696" title="Machaeridia (annelid)">
<text>Machaeridia is an extinct group of armoured, segmented annelid worms, known from the Early Ordovician (Late Tremadoc) to Carboniferous. It consists of three distinct families: the plumulitids, turrilepadids and lepidocoleids.

==Fossils==
Only the calcitic sclerites (&quot;armour plates&quot;) of these worms tend to be preserved in the fossil record. These are tiny, and usually found disarticulated: articulated specimens reach about a centimeter in length, and are incredibly rare – hence the limited degree of study since their description in 1857.

The machaeridians are characterized by having serialized rows of calcitic shell plates. The dorsal sclerites were convex and almost isometric; lateral sclerites were flatter and longer. The plates comprised two calcite layers: the outer layer is thin and formed by lamellar deposition, whereas new elements were added to the thicker inner layer as it grew. Scales are ridged with growth lines, implying that they grew episodically. A few taxa experimented with different approaches to scale formation; some were only very weakly calcified and may have mainly been organic in nature. They were never moulted, and each scale could be moved with an attached muscle.

The front two segments of the machaeridians were commonly different from the rest, bearing fewer spiny projections.

The plumulitids are flattened from above and looks much like the coat of mail armour of chitons. The two other families are laterally compressed and some lepidocoleids formed a dorsal hinge, which make these machaeridians look like a string of bivalves.

==Ecology==
Machaeridians are often found in association with stylophorans - the cornutes and mitrates. This suggests that they possessed a similar ecology. They probably fed on organic detritus, perhaps even the faeces of the accompanying stylophorans.

Their scales almost certainly performed a defensive role.

The organisms would have had limited ability to flex to the right and left (in the sagittal plane), but would have been able to roll up. While most possessed bilateral symmetry, the scales on the right and left side of &quot;Turrilepas wrightiana&quot; are different in shape and form.
The Plumulitid machaeridians would have moved across the surface of the sea floor using parapodia, whereas the fully armoured Turrelepids and Lepidocoelids burrowed in a peristaltic fashion reminiscent of their evolutionary cousins, the earthworms. This burrowing role has subjected them to the same evolutionary pressures which affect burrowing bivalves; convergent evolution as a result of their shared function probably contributed to early suggestions that the machaeridians should be classified with the molluscs.

==Taxonomic affinity==

Historically the group has been assigned to the echinoderms, barnacles, annelids and mollusks. Relationships to other Cambrian forms (such as the Halkieriids) have been proposed and discounted. In 2008, the discovery of a fossil preserving soft tissue (including chaetae and parapodia) established an annelid affinity. Machaeridians represent the only instance of this group developing calcitic armour (notwithstanding certain polychaetes that integrate calcite into their chaetae). The exact position with annelids remains unresolved, though some characters indicate a relationship to Aphroditacean annelids (Vinther et al. 2008). In an accompanying commentary, Jean-Bernard Caron suggested that machaeridians must be a stem group based on number of specialised features. However, one cannot assess crown group/stem group affinities based on autapomorphies, but on shared morphological traits or the lack thereof. He also suggested that machaeridians might be polyphyletic, but machaerdians are a well defined group with a number of shared characters and morphological gradations among all three families.

A study in 2019 recognized machaeridians as phyllodocids based on their jaws.

<text>Property damage (sometimes called damage to property), is the damage or destruction of real or tangible personal property, caused by negligence, willful destruction, or an act of nature. Destruction of property (sometimes called property destruction, or criminal damage in England and Wales) is a sub-type of property damage that involves damage to property that results from willful misconduct and is punishable as a crime.

Destruction of property encompasses vandalism (deliberate damage, destruction, or defacement), building implosion (destroying property with explosives), and arson (destroying property with fire), and similar crimes that involve unlawful infliction of damage to or destruction of personal property or real property.

<doc id="46699" wikidata="Q3822632" url="?curid=46699" title="Electoral fusion in the United States">
<text>Electoral fusion in the United States is an arrangement where two or more United States political parties on a ballot list the same candidate, allowing that candidate to receive votes on multiple party lines in the same election.

Electoral fusion is also known as fusion voting, cross endorsement, multiple party nomination, multi-party nomination, plural nomination, and ballot freedom.

Electoral fusion was once widespread in the U.S. and legal in every state. However, as of 2024, it remains legal and common only in New York and Connecticut.

==Overview==
In 2016, &quot;Business Insider&quot; wrote: &quot;Fusion voting gives voters a chance to support a major candidate while registering their unhappiness with that candidate&#x27;s party. A cross-endorsement from a smaller party like the Working Families Party can also help inform voters about where candidates stand on certain issues&quot;.

In 2019, &quot;The Nation&quot; wrote: &quot;Fusion is a response to the winner-take-all electoral system. It solves the &#x27;wasted vote&#x27; or &#x27;spoiler&#x27; dilemmas that otherwise plague third parties, and allows citizens who don&#x27;t fit neatly into the Democratic or Republican boxes to nevertheless participate constructively in politics&quot;.

Before the Civil War, fusion voting was a common electoral tactic of abolitionist forces, who formed a number of anti-slavery third parties, including the Liberty and Free Soil parties. These and other abolitionist third parties cross-nominated major party candidates running under the Whig label, fusing more than one party behind a single candidate.

After the Civil War, agrarian interest groups and the political parties they founded continued to use fusion voting to form alliances between third parties and the weaker of the two major parties, usually the Democrats in the West and Midwest. In the 19th and early 20th century, minor parties used fusion as a way to signal that their support for a major party candidate brought a meaningful number of voters to the candidate. Votes for fusion candidates were tallied first by party, then added together to produce the outcome. Historian Peter Argersinger argues that this helped &quot;maintain a significant third party tradition by guaranteeing that dissenters&#x27; votes could be more than symbolic protest&quot;. Fusion allowed minor parties to avoid the &quot;wasted vote&quot; and &quot;spoiler&quot; dilemmas that small parties face in a non-proportional voting system.

The People&#x27;s Party (also known as the Populists) is regarded as the most successful third party of the era. That success produced a counter-reaction from the dominant major parties, who then used state legislatures to enact bans against fusion in the late nineteenth and early 20th century. In northern and western states, fusion was largely banned by Republican-led legislatures. One Republican Minnesota state legislator said: &quot;We don&#x27;t propose to allow the Democrats to make allies of the Populists, Prohibitionists, or any other party, and get up combination tickets against us. We can whip them single-handed, but don&#x27;t intend to fight all creation.&quot; In southern states, fusion was largely banned by Democrats who supported Jim Crow, in an attempt to prevent political alliances between newly-enfranchised Black voters and poor white farmers.

Most states banned fusion by the early 20th century. South Dakota banned the practice in 1999, Delaware banned it in 2011, and South Carolina banned it in 2022. In &quot;Twin Cities Area New Party v. McKenna&quot; (1996), the US Supreme Court ruled that prohibiting electoral fusion does not violate the First Amendment of the Constitution.

Electoral fusion was once widespread in the US, but as of 2024, it remains legal and common only in New York and Connecticut. It is partially legal in three others: California allows fusion in presidential elections only, and Pennsylvania and Maryland permit it in certain elections, including but not limited to the judiciary. In Oregon and Vermont, a system of dual-labeling exists, which allows a candidate to list multiple party endorsements on a single line, but disallows the traditional fusion system in which a minor party has its own ballot line and votes are tallied by party. In New Hampshire, fusion is legal in rare cases when primary elections are won by write-in candidates.

As of 2024, the Alianza de País in Puerto Rico, the New Jersey Moderate Party, the Common Sense Party in Michigan and the United Kansas Party are attempting to use litigation to bring back fusion voting in their areas.

== Historical examples ==
===Presidential elections===
In 1872, both the newly formed Liberal Republican Party and the Democratic Party nominated the Liberal Republican Horace Greeley as their candidate for US President: &quot;If [the Democratic Party] was to stand any chance at all against Grant, it must avoid putting up a candidate of its own who would merely split the opposition vote. It must take Greeley.&quot;

In the presidential election of 1896, William Jennings Bryan was nominated by both the Democratic Party and the Populist Party, albeit with different vice presidential candidates, Arthur Sewall for the Democrats and Thomas E. Watson for the Populists. This election led to the downfall of the Populist Party, especially in Southern states (such as Watson&#x27;s Georgia, as well as North Carolina and Tennessee) where the Populist party had engaged in electoral fusion or other alliances with Republicans against the dominant Bourbon Democrats.

In the 1936 and 1940, the American Labor Party nominated Franklin Roosevelt for president, and in 1944, the Liberal Party of New York cross-nominated Roosevelt, fusing with the ALP. Roosevelt won the state of New York in each election, but in 1940 and 1944 he would not have won New York without the support of votes gained via the fusion parties and their voters.

Donald Trump appeared on the 2016 presidential ballot in California with two ballot labels by his name, as the nominee of both the Republican Party and the American Independent Party, a small far-right party. Trump was the first fusion presidential candidate on the California ballot in at least eighty years.

===New York===
In 1936, labor leaders in New York City took advantage of fusion and founded the American Labor Party (ALP). Their immediate goal was to provide a way for New Yorkers who despised the Tammany Hall political machine to support Franklin Roosevelt without voting for the Democratic Party. In its first showing at the polls, the party garnered a significant amount of the vote in New York City but was not important with regard to Roosevelt&#x27;s victory. In the 1937 election cycle, the ALP built on it past performance by electing members to the city council, and by delivering so many votes to Mayor Fiorello La Guardia that the &quot;New York Times&quot; ran a front page article declaring that the ALP held the balance of power in city and state politics. The importance of the ALP was demonstrated again in 1938 when the party provided the margin of victory for the Democratic candidate for Governor, and in 1940 when the ALP did the same for President Roosevelt. In the 1944 presidential election, fusion provided CIO unions in New York an opportunity to build and back a labor party, an uncommon occurrence in the US. Labor leaders knew that fusion permitted them to field candidates and win elections on the American Labor Party line in local elections, and to back Democrats in statewide or national races where they did not have the capacity to field successful candidates. Given the presence of fusion in New York, the Greater New York Industrial Union Council (GNYIUC), the CIO&#x27;s local labor federation in New York, formally affiliated with the party making it the political arm of the New York CIO. This relationship would continue until 1948 when the GNYIUC opted to back Henry Wallace for president, instead of using fusion to back President Truman. This led to internal conflicts within the CIO and ultimately contributed to the decision by the national CIO to revoke the charter of the GNYIUC, thereby ending its relationship with the ALP.

As of 2023, to obtain or maintain automatic ballot access, a party&#x27;s candidate for Governor in midterm election years or President in presidential years must receive either 130,000 votes or 2% of votes cast (whichever is greater) on that party&#x27;s line.

Other parties, such as the Libertarian Party of New York and the Green Party of New York, have sought ballot access by first getting a gubernatorial candidate on the ballot via petition (by collecting 45,000 valid signatures of registered voters), and then by getting 130,000 votes for that candidate on their line. As a general rule, neither party uses electoral fusion, and both rely on their own candidates. The Green Party, which had first achieved ballot status in 1998, failed to gain 50,000 votes (then the requirement) and also lost its ballot status in 2002, but regained its line when the 2010 election results were certified. In 2018, Larry Sharpe, the Libertarian Party candidate for governor in New York, received over 90,000 votes, giving the party ballot status for the first time in its history.

In July 2019, the New York Legislature passed a budget bill that included the creation of a Public Campaign Financing Commission, which was given authority to investigate and create rules for public financing of campaigns. The Conservative Party of New York and the Working Families Party each filed lawsuits against the state in response, alleging that the commission was a disguised attempt to end fusion voting and thus the existence of New York&#x27;s third parties.

===Oregon===
Prior to 1958, Oregon practiced a form of fusion that required the state to list multiple nominating parties on the candidate&#x27;s ballot line. Sylvester Pennoyer was elected governor in 1886 and 1890 as a candidate of the Democratic and People&#x27;s parties. In 1906, seven members of the Oregon House were also elected as candidates of the People&#x27;s Party and either the Democratic or Republican parties. In 2008, a lawsuit was brought by the Independent Party of Oregon against the Oregon Secretary of State claiming that modifications to the ballot design statute in 1995 once again required the state to list multiple nominating parties on the candidate&#x27;s ballot line. The lawsuit gave rise to legislation to allow candidates to list up to three party labels after their name. This bill passed both houses of the Oregon legislature during the 2009 legislative session. Governor Ted Kulongoski signed the bill into law on 23 July 2009.

===Pennsylvania===
In Pennsylvania, fusion can occur when members of a party write in the name of a member of a different party in a primary election and secure enough write-in votes to nominate that party&#x27;s candidate. For example, if Bob Jones is running for school board in a primary election as a Democrat and secures both enough votes from members of his own party as well as enough write-in votes from members of the Republican Party, then electoral fusion occurs, and Bob will appear on the ballot as both a Republican and a Democrat. Similarly, a member of one party may lose their own party&#x27;s nomination in a primary election but gain enough write-in votes from members of the opposing party to win that party&#x27;s nomination. For example, in May 2023, Stephen Zappala lost the Democratic primary for Allegheny County District Attorney to challenger Matt Dugan. However, although Zappala is a Democrat, he received the requisite number (500 or more) of write-in votes from Republicans to appear as a Republican on the ballot in November 2023. Running on the ballot as a Republican, Zappala won the general election in November 2023, beating Dugan.

===Wisconsin===
In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, during the heyday of the sewer socialists, the Republican and Democratic parties would agree not to run candidates against each other in some districts, concentrating instead on defeating the socialists. These candidates were usually called non-partisan, but sometimes were termed fusion candidates instead.

<doc id="46701" wikidata="Q4936615" url="?curid=46701" title="Bodily harm">
<text>Bodily harm is a legal term of art used in the definition of both statutory and common law offences in Australia, Canada, England and Wales and other common law jurisdictions. It is a synonym for injury or bodily injury and similar expressions, though it may be used with a precise and limited meaning in any given jurisdiction. The expression grievous bodily harm first appeared in a statute in Lord Ellenborough&#x27;s Act (1803).

==Canada==

In the Canadian Criminal Code, &quot;bodily harm&quot; is defined as &quot;any hurt or injury to a person that interferes with the health or comfort of the person and that is more than merely transient or trifling in nature.&quot;

==England and Wales==

The expression is not defined by any statute. It currently appears in a number of offences under the Offences against the Person Act 1861 (ss. 18, 20, 23, 26, 28, 29, 31, 35, and 47) and in the offence of burglary under the Theft Act 1968 (s. 9). It is also used in the definition of murder (as it appears in case law) in the guise of grievous bodily harm.

Psychiatric disorder

Non-physical or &quot;psychiatric injury&quot; can be considered &quot;bodily harm&quot; whether &quot;actual&quot; or &quot;grievous&quot;, but there must be formal medical evidence to verify the injury.

In R v Ireland, R v Burstow, Lord Steyn said:

In modern times, the practice of statutory interpretation frequently refers to the actual intention of the draftsman as expressed in the words of the Act, but considered in the light of contemporary knowledge. &quot;R v. Chan Fook&quot; applied this approach. Hobhouse LJ. said the prosecution &quot;chose to introduce into the case an allegation that even if Mr Martins had suffered no physical injury at all as a result of the assault upon him by the Appellant, he had nevertheless been reduced to a mental state which in itself, without more, amounted to actual bodily harm. The only evidence to which the prosecution could point in support of this allegation was the evidence of Mr Martins that he felt abused and humiliated, that he had been threatened with further violence, and that he was very frightened. There was no medical or psychiatric evidence to support the allegation. There was no evidence that he was in a state of shock at any time prior to receiving the injuries which he suffered as a result of falling from the window.&quot;

Hobhouse LJ. said:

He went on to say:

He said that juries &quot;should not be directed that an assault which causes a hysterical and nervous condition is an assault occasioning actual bodily harm&quot;.

This was followed by the Court of Appeal in R v Constanza, and the House of Lords which confirmed the principle in &quot;R v Burstow&quot;, &quot;R v Ireland&quot;. Ireland caused three women to develop psychiatric illnesses. Burstow&#x27;s victim was fearful of personal violence and was diagnosed with a severe depressive illness. The best medical practice today accepts a link between the body and psychiatric injury, so the words &quot;bodily harm&quot; in sections 20 and 47 were capable of covering recognised psychiatric illnesses, such as an anxiety disorders or a depressive disorder, which affect the central nervous system of the body. However, to qualify, those neuroses must be more than simple states of fear, or problems in coping with everyday life, which do not amount to psychiatric illnesses.

Venereal and other communicable disease

See R v. Dica [2004] EWCA Crim 1103

The Law Commission stated its view that &quot;the deliberate or reckless causing of disease should not be beyond the reach of the criminal law&quot; and there is continuing debate over whether the transmission of HIV is covered as grievous bodily harm or under sections 22 to 24 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861.

In R v Clarence, it appeared that at a time when the prisoner knew, but his wife did not know, that he had gonorrhoea, he had &quot;connection&quot; with her; that the result was that the disease was communicated to her, and that had she been aware of the prisoner&#x27;s condition she would not have submitted to the intercourse.

Lord Coleridge CJ., Pollock and Huddleston BB., Stephen, Manisty, Mathew, A L Smith, Wills and Grantham JJ., held that the conduct of the prisoner did not amount to an offence under either section 20 or section 47. Field, Hawkins, Day and Charles JJ. dissented.

Wills J. said &quot;the facts are ... that he infected her, and that from such infection she suffered grievous bodily harm&quot;.

Hawkins J. said:

Field J. said (a footnote has been included in the body of the text, indicated by &quot;(1)&quot;):

Unconsciousness

See T v. DPP [2003] EWHC 266 (Admin), [2003] Crim LR 622.

Hair

See DPP v. Smith [2006] EWHC 94 (Admin)

Pain or hurt such as persisting headaches, vomiting, pains in joints, stomach aches not caused by physical trauma

Mentioned in R v. Morris (Clarence Barrington) [1998] Cr App R 386

Great pain followed by tenderness and soreness for some time afterwards

This may constitute actual bodily harm, even though there is no physically discernible injury. See Reigate Justices ex p. Counsell (1984) 148 JP 193, DC

<doc id="46704" wikidata="Q500031" url="?curid=46704" title="Consumer Broadband and Digital Television Promotion Act">
<text>The Consumer Broadband and Digital Television Promotion Act (CBDTPA) () was a United States bill proposed in 2002 that would have prohibited any kind of technology that could be used to read digital content without digital rights management (DRM)—which prohibits copying and reading any content under copyright without permission of the copyright owner. The bill was known in early drafts as the Security Systems and Standards Certification Act (SSSCA) and was sometimes called the Consume But Don&#x27;t Try Programming Act.

==Legislation==
The CBDTPA was proposed by South Carolina senator Fritz Hollings (D-SC). Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, had stated that he could &quot;not support&quot; the proposed legislation and, as chairman, intended to block consideration of the controversial bill. This essentially killed the bill in 2002.

Proposed penalties for violating the CBDTPA ranged from five to twenty years in prison, and fines between $50,000 and $1 million.

Richard Stallman criticized this act due to the restrictions that it would place in the immediate and long-term future on free software, dubbing the bill the &quot;Consume But Don&#x27;t Try Programming Act.&quot;

Other U.S. senators named as sponsors of the CBDTPA bill include:
* John Breaux (D-LA)
* Dianne Feinstein (D-CA)
* Daniel Inouye (D-HI)
* Bill Nelson (D-FL)
* Ted Stevens (R-AK)

<doc id="46709" wikidata="Q162475" url="?curid=46709" title="County Cork">
<text>County Cork () is the largest and the southernmost county of Ireland, named after the city of Cork, the state&#x27;s second-largest city. It is in the province of Munster and the Southern Region. Its largest market towns are Mallow, Macroom, Midleton, and Skibbereen. , the county had a population of 584,156, making it the third-most populous county in Ireland. Cork County Council is the local authority for the county, while Cork City Council governs the city of Cork and its environs. Notable Corkonians include Michael Collins, Jack Lynch, Mother Jones, Roy Keane, Sonia O&#x27;Sullivan, Cillian Murphy and Graham Norton.

Cork borders four other counties: Kerry to the west, Limerick to the north, Tipperary to the north-east and Waterford to the east. The county contains a section of the Golden Vale pastureland that stretches from Kanturk in the north to Allihies in the south. The south-west region, including West Cork, is one of Ireland&#x27;s main tourist destinations, known for its rugged coast and megalithic monuments and as the starting point for the Wild Atlantic Way. The largest third-level institution is University College Cork, founded in 1845, and has a total student population of around 22,000. Local industry and employers include technology company Dell EMC, the European headquarters of Apple, and the farmer-owned dairy co-operative Dairygold.

The county is known as the &quot;rebel county&quot;, a name given to it by King Henry VII of England for its support, in a futile attempt at a rebellion in 1491, of Perkin Warbeck, who claimed to be Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York.

==Political and governance==
The local government areas of county Cork and the city of Cork are administered by the local authorities of Cork County Council and Cork City Council respectively. The boundary between these two areas was altered by the 2019 Cork boundary change. It is part of the Southern Region and has five representatives on the Southern Regional Assembly.

For elections to Dáil Éireann, the city and county are divided into five constituencies: Cork East, Cork North-Central, Cork North-West, Cork South-Central and Cork South-West. Together they return 18 deputies (TDs) to the Dáil. It is part of the South constituency for European elections.

==Geography==

Cork is the largest county in Ireland by land area, and the largest of Munster&#x27;s six counties by population and area. At the latest census in 2022, the population of the entire county stood at 584,156. Cork is the second-most populous county in the State, and the third-most populous county on the island of Ireland.

County Cork is located in the province of Munster, bordering Kerry to the west, Limerick to the north, Tipperary to the north-east and Waterford to the east. The county shares separate mountainous borders with Tipperary and Kerry. The terrain on the Kerry border was formed between 360 and 374 million years ago, as part of the rising of the MacGillycuddy&#x27;s Reeks and Caha Mountains mountains ranges. This occurred during the Devonian period when Ireland was part of a larger continental landmass and located south of the equator. The region&#x27;s topography of peaks and valleys are characterised by steep ridges formed during the Hercynian period of folding and mountain formation some 300 million years ago.

Twenty-four historic baronies are in the county—the most of any county in Ireland. While baronies continue to be officially defined units, they are no longer used for many administrative purposes. Their official status is illustrated by Placenames Orders made since 2003, where official Irish names of baronies are listed. The county has 253 civil parishes. Townlands are the smallest officially defined geographical divisions in Ireland, with about 5447 townlands in the county.

===Mountains and upland habitats===

The county&#x27;s mountains rose during a period mountain formation some 374 to 360 million years ago and include the Slieve Miskish and Caha Mountains on the Beara Peninsula, the Ballyhoura Mountains on the border with Limerick and the Shehy Mountains which contain Knockboy (706 m), the highest point in Cork. The Shehy Mountains are on the border with Kerry and may be accessed from the area known as Priests Leap, near the village of Coomhola. The upland areas of the Ballyhoura, Boggeragh, Derrynasaggart, and Mullaghareirk Mountain ranges add to the range of habitats found in the county. Important habitats in the uplands include blanket bog, heath, glacial lakes, and upland grasslands. Cork has the 13th-highest county peak in Ireland.

===Rivers and lakes===
Three rivers, the Bandon, Blackwater, and Lee, and their valleys dominate central Cork. Habitats of the valleys and floodplains include woodlands, marshes, fens, and species-rich limestone grasslands. The River Bandon flows through several towns, including Dunmanway to the west of the town of Bandon before draining into Kinsale Harbour on the south coast. Cork&#x27;s sea loughs include Lough Hyne and Lough Mahon, and the county also has many small lakes. An area has formed where the River Lee breaks into a network of channels weaving through a series of wooded islands, forming 85 hectares of swampland around Cork&#x27;s wooded area. The Environmental Protection Agency carried out a survey of surface waters in County Cork between 1995 and 1997, which identified 125 rivers and 32 lakes covered by the regulations.

===Land and forestry===
Like many parts of Munster, Cork has fertile agricultural land and many bog and peatlands. Cork has around 74,000 hectares of peatlands, which amount to 9.8% of the county&#x27;s total land area. Cork has the highest share of the national forest area, with around of forest and woodland area, constituting 11.6% of the national total and approximately 12% of Cork&#x27;s land area. It is home to one of the last remaining pieces of native woodland in Ireland and Europe.
===Wildlife===
The hooded crow, &quot;Corvus cornix&quot; is a common bird, particularly in areas nearer the coast. Due to this bird&#x27;s ability to (rarely) prey upon small lambs, the gun clubs of County Cork have killed many of these birds in modern times. A collection of the marine algae was housed in the herbarium of the botany department of the University College Cork. Parts of the South West coastline are hotspots for sightings of rare birds, with Cape Clear being a prime location for bird watching. The island is also home to one of only a few gannet colonies around Ireland and the UK. The coastline of Cork is sometimes associated with whale watching, with some sightings of fin whales, basking sharks, pilot whales, minke whales, and other species.

===Coastline===

Cork has a mountainous and flat landscape with many beaches and sea cliffs along its coast. The southwest of Ireland is known for its peninsulas and some in Cork include the Beara Peninsula, Sheep&#x27;s Head, Mizen Head, and Brow Head. Brow Head is the most southerly point of mainland Ireland. There are many islands off the coast of the county, in particular, off West Cork. Carbery&#x27;s Hundred Isles are the islands around Long Island Bay and Roaringwater Bay.

Fastnet Rock lies in the Atlantic Ocean 11.3  km south of mainland Ireland, making it the most southerly point of Ireland. Many notable islands lie off Cork, including Bere, Great Island, Sherkin, and Cape Clear. With an estimated of coastline, Cork is one of three counties which claims to have the longest coastline in Ireland, alongside Mayo and Donegal. Cork is also one of just three counties to border two bodies of water – the Celtic Sea to the south and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. Cork marks the end of the Wild Atlantic Way, the tourism trail from County Donegal&#x27;s Inishowen Peninsula to Kinsale

==History==

The county is colloquially referred to as &quot;The Rebel County&quot;, although uniquely Cork does not have an official motto. This name has 15th-century origins, but from the 20th century, the name has been more commonly attributed to the prominent role Cork played in the Irish War of Independence (1919–1921) when it was the scene of considerable fighting. In addition, it was an anti-Treaty stronghold during the Irish Civil War (1922–23). Much of what is now county Cork was once part of the Kingdom of &quot;Deas Mumhan&quot; (South Munster), anglicised as the &quot;Desmond&quot;, ruled by the MacCarthy Mór dynasty. After the Norman invasion in the 12th century, the McCarthy clan were pushed westward into what is now West Cork and County Kerry. Dunlough Castle, standing just north of Mizen Head, is one of the oldest castles in Ireland (AD 1207). The north and east of Cork were taken by the Hiberno-Norman FitzGerald dynasty, who became the Earls of Desmond. Cork City was given an English Royal Charter in 1318 and for many centuries was an outpost for Old English culture. The Fitzgerald Desmond dynasty was destroyed in the Desmond Rebellions of 1569–1573 and 1579–1583. Much of county Cork was devastated in the fighting, particularly in the Second Desmond Rebellion. In the aftermath, much of Cork was colonised by English settlers in the Plantation of Munster. 
In 1491 Cork played a part in the English Wars of the Roses when Perkin Warbeck, a pretender to the English throne spread the story that he was really Richard of Shrewsbury (one of the Princes in the Tower), landed in the city and tried to recruit support for a plot to overthrow King Henry VII of England. The Cork people supported Warbeck because he was Flemish and not English; Cork was the only county in Ireland to join the fight. The mayor of Cork and several important citizens went with Warbeck to England, but when the rebellion collapsed they were all captured and executed. Cork&#x27;s nickname of the &#x27;rebel county&#x27; (and Cork city&#x27;s of the &#x27;rebel city&#x27;) originates in these events.

In 1601 the decisive Battle of Kinsale took place in County Cork, which was to lead to English domination of Ireland for centuries. Kinsale had been the scene of the 4th Spanish Armada to help Irish rebels in the Nine Years&#x27; War (1594–1603). When this force was defeated, the rebel hopes for victory in the war were all but ended. County Cork was officially created by a division of the older County Desmond in 1606.

In the early 17th century, the townland of Leamcon (near Schull) was a pirate stronghold, and pirates traded easily in Baltimore and Whiddy Island.
In the 19th century, Cork was a centre for the Fenians and for the constitutional nationalism of the Irish Parliamentary Party, from 1910 that of the All-for-Ireland Party. The county was a hotbed of guerrilla activity during the Irish War of Independence (1919–1921). Three Cork Brigades of the Irish Republican Army operated in the county and another in the city. Prominent actions included the Kilmichael Ambush in November 1920 and the Crossbarry Ambush in March 1921. The activity of IRA flying columns, such as the one under Tom Barry in west Cork, was popularised in the Ken Loach film &quot;The Wind That Shakes The Barley&quot;. On 11 December 1920, Cork City centre was gutted by fires started by the Black and Tans in reprisal for IRA attacks. Over 300 buildings were destroyed; many other towns and villages around the county, including Fermoy, suffered a similar fate.

During the Irish Civil War (1922–23), most of the IRA units in Cork sided against the Anglo-Irish Treaty. From July to August 1922 they held the city and county as part of the so-called Munster Republic. However, Cork was taken by troops of the Irish Free State in August 1922 in the Irish Free State offensive, which included both overland and seaborne attacks. For the remainder of the war, the county saw sporadic guerrilla fighting until the Anti-Treaty side called a ceasefire and dumped their arms in May 1923. Michael Collins, a key figure in the War of Independence, was born near Clonakilty and assassinated during the civil war in Béal na Bláth, both in west Cork.

There are 14,829 Irish language speakers in County Cork, with 3,660 native speakers in the Cork Gaeltacht. In addition, in 2011 there were 6,273 pupils attending the 21 Gaelscoileanna and six Gaelcholáistí all across the county. According to the Irish Census 2006, there are 4,896 people in the county who identify themselves as being daily Irish speakers outside of the education system. The village of Ballingeary is a centre for Irish language tuition, with a summer school, Coláiste na Mumhan, or the College of Munster.

<text>Fort Ticonderoga (), formerly Fort Carillon, is a large 18th-century star fort built by the French at a narrows near the south end of Lake Champlain in northern New York. It was constructed between October 1755 and 1757 by French-Canadian military engineer Michel Chartier de Lotbinière, Marquis de Lotbinière during the action in the &quot;North American theater&quot; of the Seven Years&#x27; War, known as the French and Indian War in America. The fort was of strategic importance during the 18th-century colonial conflicts between Great Britain and France, and again played an important role during the American Revolutionary War.

The site controlled a river portage alongside the mouth of the rapids-infested La Chute River, in the between Lake Champlain and Lake George. It was strategically placed for the trade routes between the British-controlled Hudson River Valley and the French-controlled Saint Lawrence River Valley.

The terrain amplified the importance of the site. Both lakes were long and narrow and oriented north–south, as were the many ridge lines of the Appalachian Mountains which extend as far south as Georgia. The mountains created nearly impassable terrains to the east and west of the Great Appalachian Valley that the site commanded.

The name &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; comes from the Iroquois word &quot;tekontaró:ken&quot;, meaning &quot;it is at the junction of two waterways&quot;.

During the 1758 Battle of Carillon, 4,000 French defenders were able to repel an attack by 16,000 British troops near the fort. In 1759, the British returned and drove a token French garrison from the fort. The British controlled the fort at the beginning of the Revolutionary War, but the Green Mountain Boys and other state militia under the command of Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold captured it on May 10, 1775. Henry Knox led a party to transport many of the fort&#x27;s cannon to Boston to assist in the siege against the British, who evacuated the city in March 1776. The Americans held the fort until June 1777, when British forces under General John Burgoyne occupied high ground above it; the threat resulted in the Continental Army troops withdrawing from the fort and its surrounding defenses. The only direct attack on the fort during the Revolution took place in September 1777, when John Brown led 500 Americans in an unsuccessful attempt to capture it from about 100 British defenders.

The British abandoned the fort after the failure of the Saratoga campaign, and it ceased to be of military value after 1781. The United States allowed the fort to fall into ruin, and local residents stripped it of much of its usable materials. It was purchased by a private family in 1820 and became a stop on tourist routes of the area. Early in the 20th century, its private owners restored the fort. The Fort Ticonderoga Association now operates it as a tourist attraction, museum, and research center.

==Geography and early history==
Lake Champlain, which forms part of the border between New York and Vermont, and the Hudson River together formed an important travel route that was used by Native Americans long before the arrival of European colonists. The route was relatively free of obstacles to navigation, with only a few portages. One strategically important place on the route lies at a narrows near the southern end of Lake Champlain, where Ticonderoga Creek, known in colonial times as La Chute River, because it was named by French colonists, enters the lake, carrying water from Lake George. Although the site provides commanding views of the southern extent of Lake Champlain, Mount Defiance, at , and two other hills (Mount Hope and Mount Independence) overlook the area.
Native Americans had occupied the area for centuries before French explorer Samuel de Champlain first arrived there in 1609. Champlain recounted that the Algonquins, with whom he was traveling, battled a group of Iroquois nearby. In 1642, French missionary Isaac Jogues was the first white man to traverse the portage at Ticonderoga while escaping a battle between the Iroquois and members of the Huron tribe.

The French, who had colonized the Saint Lawrence River valley to the north, and the English, who had taken over the Dutch settlements that became the Province of New York to the south, began contesting the area as early as 1691, when Pieter Schuyler built a small wooden fort at the Ticonderoga point on the western shore of the lake. These colonial conflicts reached their height in the French and Indian War, which began in 1754 as the North American front of the Seven Years&#x27; War.

==Construction==

In 1755, following the Battle of Lake George, the French decided to construct a fort here. Marquis de Vaudreuil, the governor of the French Province of Canada, sent his cousin Michel Chartier de Lotbinière to design and construct a fortification at this militarily important site, which the French called Fort Carillon. The name &quot;Carillon&quot; has variously been attributed to the name of a former French officer, Philippe de Carrion du Fresnoy, who established a trading post at the site in the late 17th century, or (more commonly) to the sounds made by the rapids of La Chute River, which were said to resemble the chiming bells of a carillon. Construction on the star-shaped fort, which Lotbinière based on designs of the renowned French military engineer Vauban, began in October 1755 and then proceeded slowly during the warmer-weather months of 1756 and 1757, using troops stationed at nearby Fort St. Frédéric and from Canada.

The work in 1755 consisted primarily of beginning construction on the main walls and on the Lotbinière redoubt, an outwork to the west of the site that provided additional coverage of La Chute River. During the next year, the four main bastions were built, as well as a sawmill on La Chute. Work slowed in 1757, when many of the troops prepared for and participated in the attack on Fort William Henry. The barracks and demi-lunes were not completed until spring 1758.

===Walls and bastions===
The French built the fort to control the south end of Lake Champlain and prevent the British from gaining military access to the lake. Consequently, its most important defenses, the Reine and Germaine bastions, were directed to the northeast and northwest, away from the lake, with two demi-lunes further extending the works on the land side. The Joannes and Languedoc bastions overlooked the lake to the south, providing cover for the landing area outside the fort. The walls were high and thick, and the whole works was surrounded by a glacis and a dry moat deep and wide. When the walls were first erected in 1756, they were made of squared wooden timbers, with earth filling the gap. The French then began to dress the walls with stone from a quarry about one mile (1.6 km) away, although this work was never fully completed. When the main defenses became ready for use, the fort was armed with cannons hauled from Montreal and Fort St. Frédéric.

===Inside and outside===
The fort contained three barracks and four storehouses. One bastion held a bakery capable of producing 60 loaves of bread a day. A powder magazine was hacked out of the bedrock beneath the Joannes bastion. All the construction within the fort was of stone.

A wooden palisade protected an area outside the fort between the southern wall and the lake shore. This area contained the main landing for the fort and additional storage facilities and other works necessary for maintenance of the fort. When it became apparent in 1756 that the fort was too far to the west of the lake, the French constructed an additional redoubt to the east to enable cannon to cover the lake&#x27;s narrows.

==Analysis==
By 1758, the fort was largely complete; the only ongoing work thereafter consisted of dressing the walls with stone. Still, General Montcalm and two of his military engineers surveyed the works in 1758 and found something to criticize in almost every aspect of the fort&#x27;s construction; the buildings were too tall and thus easier for attackers&#x27; cannon fire to hit, the powder magazine leaked, and the masonry was of poor quality. The critics apparently failed to notice the fort&#x27;s significant strategic weakness: several nearby hills overlooked the fort and made it possible for besiegers to fire down on the defenders from above. Lotbinière, who may have won the job of building the fort only because he was related to Governor Vaudreuil, had lost a bid to become Canada&#x27;s chief engineer to Nicolas Sarrebource de Pontleroy, one of the two surveying engineers, in 1756, all of which may explain the highly negative report. Lotbinière&#x27;s career suffered for years afterwards.

William Nester, in his exhaustive analysis of the Battle of Carillon, notes additional problems with the fort&#x27;s construction. The fort was small for a Vauban-style fort, about wide, with a barracks capable of holding only 400 soldiers. Storage space inside the fort was similarly limited, requiring the storage of provisions outside the fort&#x27;s walls in exposed places. Its cistern was small, and the water quality was supposedly poor.

==Military history==
===French and Indian War===
In August 1757, the French captured Fort William Henry in an action launched from Fort Carillon. This, and a string of other French victories in 1757, prompted the British to organize a large-scale attack on the fort as part of a multi-campaign strategy against French Canada. In June 1758, British General James Abercromby began amassing a large force at Fort William Henry in preparation for a military campaign directed up the Champlain Valley. These forces landed at the north end of Lake George, only four miles from the fort, on July 6. The French general Louis-Joseph de Montcalm, who had only arrived at Carillon in late June, engaged his troops in a flurry of work to improve the fort&#x27;s outer defenses. They built, over two days, entrenchments around a rise between the fort and Mount Hope, about three-quarters of a mile (one kilometer) northwest of the fort, and then constructed an abatis (felled trees with sharpened branches pointing out) below these entrenchments. They conducted the work unimpeded by military action, as Abercromby failed to advance directly to the fort on July 7. Abercromby&#x27;s second-in-command, Brigadier General George Howe, had been killed when his column encountered a French reconnaissance troop. Abercromby &quot;felt [Howe&#x27;s death] most heavily&quot; and may have been unwilling to act immediately.

On July 8, 1758, Abercromby ordered a frontal attack against the hastily assembled French works. Abercromby tried to move rapidly against the few French defenders, opting to forgo field cannon and relying instead on the numerical superiority of his 16,000 troops. In the Battle of Carillon, the British were soundly defeated by the 4,000 French defenders. The battle took place far enough away from the fort that its guns were rarely used. The battle gave the fort a reputation for impregnability, which affected future military operations in the area, notably during the American Revolutionary War. Following the French victory, Montcalm, anticipating further British attacks, ordered additional work on the defenses, including the construction of the Germain and Pontleroy redoubts (named for the engineers under whose direction they were constructed) to the northeast of the fort. However, the British did not attack again in 1758, so the French withdrew all but a small garrison of men for the winter in November.

The British under General Jeffery Amherst captured the fort the following year in the 1759 Battle of Ticonderoga. In this confrontation 11,000 British troops, using emplaced artillery, drove off the token garrison of 400 Frenchmen. The French, in withdrawing, used explosives to destroy what they could of the fort and or dumped cannons that they did not take with them. Although the British worked in 1759 and 1760 to repair and improve the fort, it was not part of any further significant action in the war. After the war, the British garrisoned the fort with a small number of troops and allowed it to fall into disrepair. Colonel Frederick Haldimand, in command of the fort in 1773, wrote that it was in &quot;ruinous condition&quot;.

===Early Revolutionary War===
In 1775, Fort Ticonderoga, in disrepair, was still manned by a token British force. They found it extremely useful as a supply and communication link between Canada (which they had taken over after their victory in the Seven Years&#x27; War) and New York. On May 10, 1775, less than one month after the Revolutionary War was ignited with the battles of Lexington and Concord, the British garrison of 48 soldiers was surprised by a small force of Green Mountain Boys, along with militia volunteers from Massachusetts and Connecticut, led by Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold. Allen claimed to have said, &quot;Come out you old Rat!&quot; to the fort&#x27;s commander, Captain William Delaplace. He also later said that he demanded that the British commander surrender the fort &quot;In the name of the Great Jehovah and the Continental Congress!&quot;; however, his surrender demand was made to Lieutenant Jocelyn Feltham and not the fort&#x27;s commander, who did later appear and surrender his sword.

With the capture of the fort, the Patriot forces obtained a large supply of cannons and other armaments, much of which Henry Knox transported to Boston during the winter of 1775–1776. Ticonderoga&#x27;s cannons were instrumental in ending the siege of Boston when they were used to fortify Dorchester Heights. With Dorchester Heights secured by the Patriots, the British were forced to evacuate the city in March 1776. The capture of Fort Ticonderoga by the Patriots made communication between the British Canadian and American commands much more difficult.

Benedict Arnold remained in control of the fort until 1,000 Connecticut troops under the command of Benjamin Hinman arrived in June 1775. Because of a series of political maneuvers and miscommunications, Arnold was never notified that Hinman was to take command. After a delegation from Massachusetts (which had issued Arnold&#x27;s commission) arrived to clarify the matter, Arnold resigned his commission and departed, leaving the fort in Hinman&#x27;s hands.
Beginning in July 1775, Ticonderoga was used as a staging area for the invasion of Quebec, planned to begin in September. Under the leadership of generals Philip Schuyler and Richard Montgomery, men and materials for the invasion were accumulated there through July and August. On August 28, after receiving word that British forces at Fort Saint-Jean, not far from the New York–Quebec border, were nearing completion of boats to launch onto Lake Champlain, Montgomery launched the invasion, leading 1,200 troops down the lake. Ticonderoga continued to serve as a staging base for the action in Quebec until the battle and siege at Quebec City that resulted in Montgomery&#x27;s death.

In May 1776, British troops began to arrive at Quebec City, where they broke the Continental Army&#x27;s siege. The British chased the American forces back to Ticonderoga in June and, after several months of shipbuilding, moved down Lake Champlain under Guy Carleton in October. The British destroyed a small fleet of American gunboats in the Battle of Valcour Island in mid-October, but snow was already falling, so the British retreated to winter quarters in Quebec. About 1,700 troops from the Continental Army, under the command of Colonel Anthony Wayne, wintered at Ticonderoga. The British offensive resumed the next year in the Saratoga campaign under General John Burgoyne.

===Saratoga campaign===

During the summer of 1776, the Americans, under the direction of General Schuyler, and later under General Horatio Gates, added substantial defensive works to the area. Mount Independence, which is almost completely surrounded by water, was fortified with trenches near the water, a horseshoe battery part way up the side, a citadel at the summit, and redoubts armed with cannons surrounding the summit area. These defenses were linked to Ticonderoga with a pontoon bridge that was protected by land batteries on both sides. The works on Mount Hope, the heights above the site of Montcalm&#x27;s victory, were improved to include a star-shaped fort. Mount Defiance remained unfortified.
In March 1777, American generals were strategizing about possible British military movements and considered an attempt on the Hudson River corridor a likely possibility. General Schuyler, heading the forces stationed at Ticonderoga, requested 10,000 troops to guard Ticonderoga and 2,000 to guard the Mohawk River valley against British invasion from the north. George Washington, who had never been to Ticonderoga (his only visit was to be in 1783), believed that an overland attack from the north was unlikely, because of the alleged impregnability of Ticonderoga. This, combined with continuing incursions up the Hudson River valley by British forces occupying New York City, led Washington to believe that any attack on the Albany area would be from the south, which, as it was part of the supply line to Ticonderoga, would necessitate a withdrawal from the fort. As a result, no significant actions were taken to further fortify Ticonderoga or significantly increase its garrison. The garrison, about 2,000 men under General Arthur St. Clair, was too small to man all the defenses.

General Gates, who oversaw the northern defenses, was aware that Mount Defiance threatened the fort. John Trumbull had pointed this out as early as 1776, when a shot fired from the fort was able to reach Defiance&#x27;s summit, and several officers inspecting the hill noted that there were approaches to its summit where gun carriages could be pulled up the sides. As the garrison was too small to properly defend all the existing works in the area, Mount Defiance was left undefended. Anthony Wayne left Ticonderoga in April 1777 to join Washington&#x27;s army; he reported to Washington that &quot;all was well&quot;, and that the fort &quot;can never be carried, without much loss of blood&quot;.
General Burgoyne led 7,800 British and Hessian forces south from Quebec in June 1777. After occupying nearby Fort Crown Point without opposition on June 30, he prepared to besiege Ticonderoga. Burgoyne realized the tactical advantage of the high ground, and had his troops haul cannons to the top of Mount Defiance. Faced with bombardment from the heights (although no shots had yet been fired), General St. Clair ordered Ticonderoga abandoned on July 5, 1777. Burgoyne&#x27;s troops moved in the next day, with advance guards pursuing the retreating Patriot Americans. Washington, on hearing of Burgoyne&#x27;s advance and the retreat from Ticonderoga, stated that the event was &quot;not apprehended, nor within the compass of my reasoning&quot;. News of the abandonment of the &quot;Impregnable Bastion&quot; without a fight, caused &quot;the greatest surprise and alarm&quot; throughout the colonies. After public outcry over his actions, General St. Clair was court-martialed in 1778. He was cleared on all charges.

===One last attack===
Following the British capture of Ticonderoga, it and the surrounding defenses were garrisoned by 700 British and Hessian troops under the command of Brigadier General Henry Watson Powell. Most of these forces were on Mount Independence, with only 100 each at Fort Ticonderoga and a blockhouse they were constructing on top of Mount Defiance. George Washington sent General Benjamin Lincoln into Vermont to &quot;divide and distract the enemy&quot;. Aware that the British were housing American prisoners in the area, Lincoln decided to test the British defenses. On September 13, he sent 500 men to Skenesboro, which they found the British had abandoned, and 500 each against the defenses on either side of the lake at Ticonderoga. Colonel John Brown led the troops on the west side, with instructions to release prisoners if possible, and attack the fort if it seemed feasible.
Early on September 18, Brown&#x27;s troops surprised a British contingent holding some prisoners near the Lake George landing, while a detachment of his troops sneaked up Mount Defiance, and captured most of the sleeping construction crew. Brown and his men then moved down the portage trail toward the fort, surprising more troops and releasing prisoners along the way. The fort&#x27;s occupants were unaware of the action until Brown&#x27;s men and British troops occupying the old French lines skirmished. At this point Brown&#x27;s men dragged two captured six-pound guns up to the lines, and began firing on the fort. The men who had captured Mount Defiance began firing a twelve-pounder from that site. The column that was to attack Mount Independence was delayed, and its numerous defenders were alerted to the action at the fort below before the attack on their position began. Their musket fire, as well as grapeshot fired from ships anchored nearby, intimidated the Americans sufficiently that they never launched an assault on the defensive positions on Mount Independence. A stalemate persisted, with regular exchanges of cannon fire, until September 21, when 100 Hessians, returning from the Mohawk Valley to support Burgoyne, arrived on the scene to provide reinforcement to the besieged fort.
Brown eventually sent a truce party to the fort to open negotiations; the party was fired on, and three of its five members were killed. Brown, realizing that the weaponry they had was insufficient to take the fort, decided to withdraw. Destroying many bateaux and seizing a ship on Lake George, he set off to annoy British positions on that lake. His action resulted in the freeing of 118 Americans and the capture of 293 British troops, while suffering fewer than ten casualties.

===Abandonment===
Following Burgoyne&#x27;s defeat at Saratoga, the fort at Ticonderoga became increasingly irrelevant. The British abandoned it and nearby Fort Crown Point in November 1777, destroying both as best they could prior to their withdrawal. The fort was occasionally reoccupied by British raiding parties in the following years, but it no longer held a prominent strategic role in the war. It was finally abandoned by the British for good in 1781, following their surrender at Yorktown. In the years following the war, area residents stripped the fort of usable building materials, even melting some of the cannons down for their metal.

==Tourist attraction==
In 1785, the fort&#x27;s lands became the property of the state of New York. The state donated the property to Columbia and Union colleges in 1803. The colleges sold the property to William Ferris Pell in 1820.

Pell first used the property as a summer retreat. Completion of railroads and canals connecting the area to New York City brought tourists to the area, so he converted his summer house, known as The Pavilion, into a hotel to serve the tourist trade. In 1848, the Hudson River School artist Russell Smith painted &quot;Ruins of Fort Ticonderoga&quot;, depicting the condition of the fort.

The Pell family, a politically important clan with influence throughout American history (from William C. C. Claiborne, the first Governor of Louisiana, to a Senator from Rhode Island, Claiborne Pell), hired English architect Alfred Bossom to restore the fort and formally opened it to the public in 1909 as an historic site. The ceremonies, which commemorated the 300th anniversary of the discovery of Lake Champlain by European explorers, were attended by President William Howard Taft. Stephen Hyatt Pell, who spearheaded the restoration effort, founded the Fort Ticonderoga Association in 1931, which is now responsible for the fort. Funding for the restoration also came from Robert M. Thompson, father of Stephen Pell&#x27;s wife, Sarah Gibbs Thompson.

Between 1900 and 1950, the foundation acquired the historically important lands around the fort, including Mount Defiance, Mount Independence, and much of Mount Hope. The fort was rearmed with fourteen 24-pound cannons provided by the British government. These cannons had been cast in England for use during the American Revolution, but the war ended before they were shipped over.
Designated as a National Historic Landmark by the Department of Interior, the fort is now operated by the foundation as a tourist attraction, early American military museum, and research center. The fort opens annually around May 10, the anniversary of the 1775 capture, and closes in late October.

The fort has been on a watchlist of National Historic Landmarks since 1998, because of the poor condition of some of the walls and of the 19th-century pavilion constructed by William Ferris Pell. The pavilion was being restored in 2009. In 2008, the powder magazine, destroyed by the French in 1759, was reconstructed by Tonetti Associates Architects, based in part on the original 1755 plans. Also in 2008, the withdrawal of a major backer&#x27;s financial support forced the museum, which was facing significant budget deficits, to consider selling one of its major art works, Thomas Cole&#x27;s &quot;Gelyna, View near Ticonderoga&quot;. However, fundraising activities were successful enough to prevent the sale.

The not-for-profit Living History Education Foundation conducts teacher programs at Fort Ticonderoga during the summer that last approximately one week. The program trains teachers how to teach Living History techniques, and to understand and interpret the importance of Fort Ticonderoga during the French and Indian War and the American Revolution.

The fort conducts other seminars, symposia, and workshops throughout the year, including the annual War College of the Seven Years&#x27; War in May and the Seminar on the American Revolution in September.

The Pell family estate is located north of the fort. In 1921, Sarah Pell undertook reconstruction of the gardens. She hired Marian Cruger Coffin, one of the most famous American landscape architects of the period. In 1995, the gardens were restored and later opened for public visiting; they are known as the King&#x27;s Garden.

==Memorials==

The U.S. Navy has given the name &#x27;Ticonderoga&#x27; to five different vessels, as well as to entire classes of cruisers and aircraft carriers.

The fort was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1960. Included in the landmarked area are Mount Independence and Mount Defiance, as well as the fort. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. The Ticonderoga pencil, manufactured by the Dixon Ticonderoga Corporation, is named for the fort.
