<text>Frederick, Prince of Wales (Frederick Louis, German: &quot;Friedrich Ludwig&quot;; 31 January 1707 – 31 March 1751) was the eldest son and heir apparent of King George II of Great Britain. He grew estranged from his parents, King George and Queen Caroline. Frederick was the father of King George III.

Under the Act of Settlement passed by the English Parliament in 1701, Frederick was fourth in the line of succession to the British throne at birth, after his great-grandmother Sophia, Dowager Electress of Hanover; his grandfather George, Prince-Elector of Hanover; and his father, George. The Elector ascended the British throne in 1714. After his paternal grandfather died and his father became king in 1727, Frederick moved to Great Britain and was created Prince of Wales in 1729. He predeceased his father and upon the latter&#x27;s death in 1760, the throne passed to Frederick&#x27;s eldest son, George III.

==Early life==

Prince Frederick Louis was born on in Hanover, Holy Roman Empire (Germany), as Duke Friedrich Ludwig of Brunswick-Lüneburg, to Caroline of Ansbach and Prince George, son of George, Elector of Hanover (who was also one of Frederick&#x27;s two godfathers). The Elector was the son of Sophia of Hanover, who was heir presumptive to Queen Anne of Great Britain. However, in June 1714, Sophia died at the age of 83 before Anne, which elevated the Elector to heir presumptive. Queen Anne died on 1 August the same year, so the Elector became King George I. This made Frederick&#x27;s father first-in-line to the British throne and Frederick himself second-in-line. Frederick&#x27;s other godfather was his granduncle Frederick I, King in Prussia and Elector of Brandenburg-Prussia. Within the family, Frederick was nicknamed &quot;Griff&quot;.

In the year of Anne&#x27;s death and the coronation of George I, Frederick&#x27;s parents, George, Prince of Wales (later George II), and Caroline of Ansbach, were called upon to leave Hanover for Great Britain when Frederick was only 7 years old. He was left in the care of his granduncle Ernest Augustus, Prince-Bishop of Osnabrück, and did not see his parents again for 14 years.

In 1722, Frederick was inoculated against smallpox by Charles Maitland on the instructions of his mother, Caroline. His grandfather George I created him Duke of Edinburgh, Marquess of the Isle of Ely, Earl of Eltham in the county of Kent, Viscount of Launceston in the county of Cornwall, and Baron of Snaudon in the county of Carnarvon, on 26 July 1726. The latter two titles have been interpreted differently since: the &quot;of&quot;s are omitted and &quot;Snaudon&quot; rendered as &quot;Snowdon&quot;.

Frederick arrived in Great Britain in 1728, the year after his father had become King George II. By then, George and Caroline had several younger children, and Frederick was a high-spirited young man fond of drinking, gambling and women. The long separation had damaged the relationship with his parents, and they would never be close to him. That year also saw the foundation of Fredericksburg, Virginia, which was named after himhis other namesakes are Prince Frederick, Maryland (1722); Fort Frederick, Maine (1729–30); Fort Frederick, South Carolina (1730–34); Fort Frederick, New York (completed 1735); and Fort Frederica, Georgia (founded 1736); while Fort Frederick, Maryland; Point Frederick, Ontario; Fort Frederick, Ontario; and Fort Frederick, New Brunswick were also named after him posthumously.

==Prince of Wales==
The motives for the ill-feeling between Frederick and his parents may have included the fact that he had been set up by his grandfather, even as a small child, as the representative of the House of Hanover, and was used to presiding over official occasions in the absence of his parents. He was not permitted to go to Great Britain until after his father took the throne as George II on 11 June 1727. Frederick had continued to be known as Prince Friedrich Ludwig of Hanover (with his British HRH style) even after his father had been created Prince of Wales.

Frederick was created Prince of Wales on 7 January 1729. He served as the tenth chancellor of the University of Dublin from 1728 to 1751, and a portrait of him still enjoys a commanding position in the Hall of Trinity College Dublin.

Once established in London, Frederick sponsored a court of &#x27;opposition&#x27; politicians. They supported the Opera of the Nobility in Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields as a rival to George Frideric Handel&#x27;s royally sponsored opera at the King&#x27;s Theatre in the Haymarket. Frederick was a lover of music who played the viola and cello; he is depicted playing a cello in three portraits by Philippe Mercier of Frederick and his sisters. He enjoyed the natural sciences and the arts, and became a thorn in the side of his parents, making a point of opposing them in everything, according to the court gossip Lord Hervey. At court, the favourite of George II and Queen Caroline was Frederick&#x27;s younger brother, Prince William, Duke of Cumberland, to the extent that the king looked into ways of splitting his domains so that Frederick would succeed only in Britain, while Hanover would go to William.

Hervey and Frederick (using a pseudonym &quot;Captain Bodkin&quot;) wrote a theatrical comedy which was staged at the Drury Lane Theatre in October 1731. It was panned by the critics, and even the theatre&#x27;s manager thought it so bad that it was unlikely to play out even the first night. He had soldiers stationed in the audience to maintain order, and when the play flopped, the audience were given their money back. Hervey and Frederick also shared a mistress, Anne Vane, who had a son called FitzFrederick Vane in June 1732. Either of them or William Stanhope, 1st Earl of Harrington, another of her lovers, could have been the father. Jealousy between Frederick and Hervey may have contributed to a breach, and their friendship ended. Hervey later wrote bitterly that Frederick was &quot;false ... never having the least hesitation in telling any lie that served his present purpose.&quot;

==Patron of the arts==
A permanent result of Frederick&#x27;s patronage of the arts is &quot;Rule, Britannia!&quot;, one of the best-known British patriotic songs. It was composed by the English composer Thomas Arne with words written by the Scottish poet and playwright James Thomson as part of the masque &quot;Alfred&quot;, which was first performed on 1 August 1740 at Cliveden. Thomas Arne was also one of Frederick&#x27;s favourite artists. A masque linking the prince with both the Saxon hero-king Alfred the Great&#x27;s victories over the Vikings and with the contemporary issue of building up British sea power accorded well with Frederick&#x27;s political plans and aspirations. Later, the song gained a life of its own outside of the masque. Thomson, who supported the Prince of Wales politically, also dedicated an earlier work dedicated to him: &quot;Liberty&quot; (1734). 

Unlike the king, Frederick was a knowledgeable amateur of painting, patronising immigrant artists such as Jacopo Amigoni and Jean-Baptiste van Loo, who painted the portraits of the prince and his consort for Frederick&#x27;s champion William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath. The list of other artists whom he employed—Philippe Mercier, John Wootton, George Knapton, and the engraver Joseph Goupy—includes some of the principal painters of the English Rococo. The prince was also crucially important in furthering the popularity of the Rococo style in the decorative arts, with a clear predilection for French Huguenot craftsmen. He patronised silversmiths such as Nicolas Sprimont (1713–1771), &quot;toyshop&quot; owners such as Paul Bertrand, and also carvers and gilders. The most notable of the latter was Paul Petit (1729–c. 1756) who first worked for the prince on William Kent&#x27;s neo-Palladian state barge of 1732, which is still preserved in the National Maritime Museum. Petit worked on a handful of magnificent trophy frames in the Rococo style for Frederick, which are among the most significant remaining testaments to the prince&#x27;s patronage of the decorative arts. One frame, made in 1748 for his namesake cousin Frederick the Great of Prussia, was especially lavish and represented the esteem in which the prince held his cousin. This suggests the prince identified with Frederick the Great&#x27;s style of enlightened rule, more than that of his own father George II. Petit&#x27;s frame contained a portrait of Frederick the Great painted by Antoine Pesne, and remains today in the British Royal Collection.

None of Frederick&#x27;s homes are now left standing except for the country residence of Cliveden, which is in a much altered state. His London residences (Norfolk House, Carlton House, Leicester House, and Kew House or the White House) have all been demolished.

==Domestic life==
Negotiations between George II and his first cousin and brother-in-law Frederick William I of Prussia on a proposed marriage between the Prince of Wales and Frederick William&#x27;s daughter Wilhelmine were welcomed by Frederick even though the couple had never met. George II was not keen on the proposal but continued talks for diplomatic reasons. Frustrated by the delay, Frederick sent an envoy of his own to the Prussian court. When George II discovered the plan, he immediately arranged for Frederick to leave Hanover for England. The marriage negotiations floundered when Frederick William demanded that Frederick be made Regent in Hanover.

Frederick also almost married Lady Diana Spencer, daughter of Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland and Lady Anne Churchill. Lady Diana was the favourite grandchild of the powerful Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough. The duchess sought a royal alliance by marrying Lady Diana to the Prince of Wales with a massive dowry of £100,000. The prince, who was in great debt, agreed to the proposal, but the plan was vetoed by Robert Walpole and the king. Lady Diana soon married John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford.

Although in his youth he was a spendthrift and womaniser, Frederick settled down following his marriage to the sixteen-year-old Augusta of Saxe-Gotha on 27 April 1736. The wedding was held at the Chapel Royal at St James&#x27;s Palace in London, presided over by Edmund Gibson, Bishop of London and Dean of the Chapel Royal. Handel provided the new anthem &#x27;Sing unto God&#x27; for the service, and the wedding was also marked in London by two rival operas, Handel&#x27;s &quot;Atalanta&quot; and Porpora&#x27;s &quot;La festa d&#x27;Imeneo&quot;.

In May 1736, George II returned to Hanover, which was unpopular in England. A satirical notice was pinned to the gates of St James&#x27;s Palace decrying his absence: &quot;Lost or strayed out of this house&quot;, it read, &quot;a man who has left a wife and six children on the parish.&quot; The King made plans to return, in the face of inclement weather; when his ship was caught in a storm, gossip swept London that he had drowned. Eventually, in January 1737, he arrived back in England. Immediately he fell ill, with piles and a fever, and withdrew to his bed. The Prince of Wales put it about that the King was dying, with the result that George insisted on getting up and attending a social event to disprove the gossip-mongers.

Quickly accumulating large debts, Frederick relied for an income on his wealthy friend George Bubb Dodington. The prince&#x27;s father refused to make him a financial allowance of the size that the prince considered should have been his. Frederick&#x27;s public opposition to his father&#x27;s government continued; he opposed the unpopular Gin Act 1736, which tried to control the Gin Craze. Frederick applied to Parliament for an increased financial allowance, and public disagreement over the payment of the money drove a further wedge between parents and son. Frederick&#x27;s allowance was raised, but by less than he had asked for.

In June 1737, Frederick informed his parents that Augusta was pregnant, and was due to give birth in October. Traditionally, royal births were witnessed by members of the family and senior courtiers to guard against supposititious children. But in fact, Augusta&#x27;s due date was earlier. When she went into labour in July the Prince sneaked her out of Hampton Court Palace in the middle of the night, and forced her to ride in a rattling carriage to St James&#x27;s Palace, so that the King and Queen could not be present at the birth. When they learned of the Prince&#x27;s action, George and Caroline were horrified. With a party including two of her daughters and Lord Hervey, the Queen rushed to St James. There, Caroline was relieved to discover that Augusta had given birth to a &quot;poor, ugly little she-mouse&quot; rather than a &quot;large, fat, healthy boy&quot;. That made a supposititious child unlikely, since the baby was so pitiful. The circumstances of the birth deepened the estrangement between mother and son.

Frederick was banished from the king&#x27;s court, and a rival court grew up at Frederick&#x27;s new residence, Leicester House, where his father and mother had themselves lived after becoming estranged from George I. His mother fell fatally ill at the end of the year, but the king refused Frederick permission to see her. Frederick became a devoted family man, taking his wife and children to live in the countryside at Cliveden, where he fished, shot, and rowed. In 1742, Robert Walpole left office, and the realignment of the government led to a reconciliation between father and son, as Frederick&#x27;s friends in Parliament gained influence.

After the Jacobite Rising of 1745, Frederick met Flora MacDonald, who had been imprisoned in the Tower of London for aiding the escape of the Rising&#x27;s leader Charles Edward Stuart, and helped to secure her eventual release. In 1747, Frederick rejoined the political opposition, and the king responded by dissolving Parliament. In the subsequent early general election, Frederick&#x27;s allies lost.

==Cricket==
By the time Frederick arrived in Great Britain, cricket had developed into the country&#x27;s most popular team sport, and it thrived on gambling. Perhaps because he wished to anglicise and so fit in with society, Frederick developed an academic interest in cricket and soon became a genuine enthusiast. He began to make wagers and then to patronise and play the sport, even forming his own team on several occasions.

The earliest mention of Frederick in cricket annals is in a contemporary report of a match on 28 September 1731 between Surrey and London, played on Kennington Common. No post-match report was found despite advance promotion as &quot;likely to be the best performance of this kind that has been seen for some time&quot;. The records show that &quot;for the convenience of the gamesters, the ground is to be staked and roped out&quot; – a new practice in 1731 and possibly done partly for the benefit of a royal visitor. The advertisement refers to &quot;the whole county of Surrey&quot; as London&#x27;s opponents and states that the Prince of Wales is &quot;expected to attend&quot;.

In August 1732, the &quot;Whitehall Evening Post&quot; reported that Frederick attended &quot;a great cricket match&quot; at Kew on 27 July.

By the 1733 season, Frederick was seriously involved in the game, in effect as a county cricketer for Surrey. He was said to have given a guinea to each player in a Surrey vs. Middlesex game at Moulsey Hurst. Then he awarded a silver cup to a combined Surrey and Middlesex team which had just beaten Kent, arguably the best county team at the time, at Moulsey Hurst on 1 August. This is the first reference in cricket history to any kind of trophy (other than hard cash) being contested. On 31 August, the Prince of Wales XI played Sir William Gage&#x27;s XI on Moulsey Hurst. The result is unknown but the teams were said to be of county standard, so presumably it was in effect a Surrey vs. Sussex match.

In the years following 1733, there are frequent references to the Prince of Wales as a patron of cricket and as an occasional player.

When he died on 31 March 1751, cricket suffered a double blow as his death closely followed that of Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond, the game&#x27;s greatest financial patron at the time. The number of top-class matches declined for several years.

==Death==

His political ambitions unfulfilled, Frederick died at Leicester House at the age of 44 on 31 March 1751 (20 March OS). In the past, this has been attributed to a burst lung abscess caused by a blow from a cricket or a real tennis ball, but it is now thought to have been from a pulmonary embolism. He was buried at Westminster Abbey on 13 April 1751. He is the most recent Prince of Wales not to have acceded to the British throne.

The Prince of Wales&#x27;s epigram (quoted by William Makepeace Thackeray, &quot;Four Georges&quot;):
&lt;poem&gt;
 &quot;Here lies poor Fred who was alive and is dead,
 Had it been his father I had much rather,
 Had it been his sister nobody would have missed her,
 Had it been his brother, still better than another,
 Had it been the whole generation, so much better for the nation,
 But since it is Fred who was alive and is dead,
 There is no more to be said!&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Titles, honours and arms==
===British titles===
He was given the title Duke of Gloucester on 10 January 1717, but when he was raised to the peerage on 26 July 1726 it was as Duke of Edinburgh. He became Duke of Cornwall on 11 June 1727 and Prince of Wales on 7 January 1729.

===Honours===
* 3 July 1717: Royal Knight of the Garter

===Arms===
Between his creation as Duke of Edinburgh in 1726 and his creation as Prince of Wales, he bore the arms of the kingdom, differentiated by a &quot;label argent of three points, the centre point bearing a cross gules&quot;. As Prince of Wales, the difference changed to simply a &quot;label argent of three points&quot;. Frederick never succeeded his father as Treasurer of the Holy Roman Empire and so the red escutcheon in the centre of his Hanover quarter is empty.

<text>Marcy Playground is an American alternative rock band consisting of three members: John Wozniak (lead vocals, guitar), Dylan Keefe (bass), and Shlomi Lavie (drums). The band is best known for their 1997 hit &quot;Sex and Candy&quot;.

==History==

===Early years===
The band is named after the Marcy Open School in Minneapolis, which is the alternative school John Wozniak attended. He chose the name because many of his songs were inspired by his childhood. Marcy Playground emerged in the late 1990s. Influences include David Bowie, Paul Simon, Neil Young, Van Morrison, Jimi Hendrix, Syd Barrett of Pink Floyd, Nirvana, Wham! and the Beatles. Frontman John Wozniak&#x27;s first effort, &quot;Zog BogBean – From the Marcy Playground&quot;, was self-produced, recorded in his bedroom studio with some help from his then-girlfriend Sherry Fraser and her brother Scott in the early nineties. A limited run of CDs were self-released by Wozniak. &quot;Our Generation&quot; and &quot;Dog and His Master&quot;, two songs found on Wozniak&#x27;s &quot;Zog BogBean&quot; project, would appear on later Marcy Playground albums. As of April 2009, &quot;Zog BogBean&quot; was available for download at Marcy Playground&#x27;s official site as well as other outlets such as iTunes.

===&quot;Marcy Playground&quot; (1994–1998)===
After attending the Evergreen State College for two years, Wozniak moved east to New York, in order to work with multi-instrumentalist producer Jared Kotler, who John had known from suburban Philadelphia. Jared believed in John&#x27;s songwriting talent and put together money with his cousin Jeff White in order to pay for and produce the duo, along with studio musician Glenn Braver(bassist) to record at Sabella Recording Studios in nearby Roslyn, New York. After hearing the two records worth of material Jared produced of John&#x27;s songs, Capitol Records became interested in the music. Kurt Rosenwinkel, a mutual friend, introduced bassist Dylan Keefe to John Wozniak and Marcy Playground began performing in NYC. The band was signed to Capitol in 1995 and they performed a series of NYC club dates that would be the first incarnation of Marcy Playground as a band. Personal problems between John and Jared reached a peak after a year of playing the New York music scene and drummer Dan Rieser was brought in to replace Jared whose interest was producing other artists. The self-titled album was released in 1997, with the first single, &quot;Poppies&quot;, released soon after. 

Marcy Playground emerged into the mainstream with the success of the single &quot;Sex and Candy&quot;. The song spent 15 weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. The album went platinum and managed to spawn two other singles, &quot;Saint Joe on the School Bus&quot; and &quot;Sherry Fraser&quot;. &quot;Marcy Playground&quot; is quiet and minimalist in tone. Wozniak&#x27;s songs run in different styles: some are modern folk music; many have undertones reminiscent of children&#x27;s songs; the blurred sound of psychedelia makes appearances; and then there are the songs with a clear rock sound.

===&quot;Shapeshifter&quot; (1999–2000)===
Marcy Playground&#x27;s next outing was 1999&#x27;s &quot;Shapeshifter&quot;. Shapeshifter was released on November 2, 1999.

A minor controversy came to light when Paul Leary of the Butthole Surfers revealed on Marcy Playground&#x27;s website forum that the cover art (a painting by Mark Ryden) had originally been conceptualized and commissioned by Leary for his band&#x27;s aborted &quot;After the Astronaut&quot; album. He admitted to being a fan of Marcy Playground and Leary&#x27;s outrage was eased once he learned that Capitol Records, former home of the Butthole Surfers and then-current home of Marcy Playground, had pitched the artwork to Wozniak as original work from its own art department and that Marcy Playground had no knowledge of the work&#x27;s origins. Upon learning the truth, Wozniak proclaimed that he was &quot;honored&quot; to have an album cover designed by Paul Leary. 

&quot;It&#x27;s Saturday&quot;, the album&#x27;s lead single, managed to hit No. 23 on the Modern Rock Charts, and followed by a second single, &quot;Bye Bye&quot;.

After &quot;Shapeshifter,&quot; drummer Dan Rieser left the band to pursue other interests. The position was eventually filled on his recommendation by Gonzalo &quot;Gonz&quot; Martinez de la Cotera, a friend whose previous band Lincoln had opened for Marcy Playground.

===&quot;MP3&quot; (2004–2006)===
After a considerable hiatus, Marcy Playground recorded a follow-up to &quot;Shapeshifter&quot;. Marcy Playground&#x27;s third album, &quot;MP3&quot;, was released in 2004.

Marcy Playground did some touring in support of &quot;MP3&quot;. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Deadly Handsome Man&quot;, was a song featured on the &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot; movie soundtrack a few years earlier under its original title, &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Song&quot;. The second single, &quot;Punk Rock Superstar&quot;, surprised many fans while bringing in some new ones, when it was featured on the Xbox 360&#x27;s playlist upon its release in 2006. Other singles from the album include &quot;Blood in Alphabet Soup&quot; and &quot;No One&#x27;s Boy&quot;; both were featured on promotional ads for &quot;MP3&quot;. One album track, &quot;Paper Dolls&quot;, was co-written by Jimi Haha of the alternative rock band Jimmie&#x27;s Chicken Shack.
On the track titled &quot;Hotter Than the Sun&quot;, Wozniak reflects on the band&#x27;s one-time success and remains positive about the band&#x27;s future.

===&quot;Leaving Wonderland...in a Fit of Rage&quot; (2009)===
Marcy Playground&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Leaving Wonderland... in a Fit of Rage&quot;, was released on July 7, 2009. Originally conceived as a solo record by John Wozniak, he brought Dylan Keefe into the project and the record was released under the band&#x27;s name. &quot;Leaving Wonderland&quot; features 12 songs, including the singles &quot;Good Times&quot; and &quot;Blackbird&quot;. Also included on the record is a version of &quot;Memphis&quot;, a Marcy Playground B-side that Wozniak&#x27;s wife felt deserved a second breath of life. Sherry Fraser, Wozniak&#x27;s longtime friend and lead vocalist of Two Ton Boa (a.k.a. 222), designed the album cover. &quot;Leaving Wonderland&quot; was coproduced, recorded and mixed by Jeff Dawson.

After Gonzalo Martinez&#x27;s departure from the band, family friend Shlomi Lavie stepped in as drummer for the band&#x27;s 2009 tour. After a successful 4-day Carnival Cruise show in the Bahamas alongside post-grunge band Sponge, it was announced that the band would tour for the spring of 2009, playing in venues along the California coastline, including the Key Club, as well as cities in Canada and North Carolina.

===&quot;Indaba Remixes from Wonderland&quot; (2010–2011)===
Marcy Playground&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;Indaba Remixes from Wonderland,&quot; was released on September 28, 2010. &quot;Indaba Remixes from Wonderland&quot; is a new CD and digital collection of remixes from Marcy Playground&#x27;s 2009 album &quot;Leaving Wonderland...in a fit of rage&quot;. Marcy Playground partnered with Indaba Music to offer fans the opportunity to remix songs from the &quot;Leaving Wonderland&quot; album. Marcy Playground then selected its favorite mixes from hundreds submitted to be included on &quot;Indaba&quot;. This is the first time Marcy Playground had an album produced exclusively from fan submitted remixes to Indaba Music where the winners received royalties from album sales.

John Wozniak stated: &quot;I wanted to make this record to show people what the online music community is capable of. I believe the talent reflected in these tracks speaks for itself. This community is thriving. It&#x27;s thriving because musicians feed on inspiration they get from other musicians. Music is not meant to be a solitary endeavor; it&#x27;s something we like to do with other people.&quot;

Marcy Playground was to tour many venues in support of the album through 2010.

===&quot;Lunch, Recess &amp; Detention&quot; (2012)===
Marcy Playground announced in mid-June 2012 that they will be releasing a compilation of rarities, B-sides, and new material on July 17, 2012 titled &quot;Lunch, Recess &amp; Detention&quot;. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Mr. Fisher&quot;, was released on June 26, 2012. Marcy Playground joined Everclear, Sugar Ray, Lit, and the Gin Blossoms on the Summerland Tour 2012.

<text>Kill Rock Stars is an independent record label founded in February 1991 by Slim Moon and Tinuviel Sampson, and based in both Olympia, Washington, and Portland, Oregon. The label has released a variety of work in different genres, but it was originally known for its commitment to underground punk rock bands and the Olympia area music scene.

==History==
Sampson and Moon initially started the label because, in Moon&#x27;s words, &quot;I just wanted to put out my friends&#x27; records because nobody was putting out my friends&#x27; records. And to put out spoken word 7-inch records.&quot; KRS-101 (the label&#x27;s first release) was in fact a split 7-inch spoken-word record with Kathleen Hanna and Slim Moon; other &quot;Wordcore&quot; releases followed. The first major release was a compilation of Olympia-area bands simply titled &quot;Kill Rock Stars&quot; (&quot;Stars Kill Rock&quot; and &quot;Rock Stars Kill&quot; would follow in the same compilation series) and featured Bikini Kill, Bratmobile, Unwound, Nirvana, Mecca Normal, Heavens to Betsy, The Nation of Ulysses, and the Melvins, among others.

Although the label&#x27;s music has never reflected a singular genre or underground music movement, it is arguably most notable for releasing the work of various riot grrrl bands during the mid-&#x27;90s, some of which, especially Bikini Kill, generated a good deal of press attention. Other Kill Rock Stars releases in this genre includes albums by Bratmobile, Huggy Bear, Heavens to Betsy and Excuse 17.

The label continued its tradition of spoken word by releasing their first full-length spoken-word LP &quot;Big Broad&quot; by Juliana Luecking in 1995. This was also the year that Elliott Smith released his self-titled solo LP on the label. Another milestone was the 1997 release of Sleater-Kinney&#x27;s third LP (and first on Kill Rock Stars) &quot;Dig Me Out&quot;, which garnered national press attention in &quot;Spin&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

In 1997–98, the 5RC label was formed as a sister label to Kill Rock Stars; it released generally harsher-sounding and more experimental rock than Kill Rock Stars. The 5RC roster included Xiu Xiu, Deerhoof, Need New Body, The Mae Shi, The Robot Ate Me, and Metalux, among others. 1998 also marked the first-ever Mailorder Freak Singles Club, featuring Quasi, Small Stars, Sta-Prest, and Rock*A*Teens, among others.

Another popular band on Kill Rock Stars was the Decemberists, who released three full-length albums on the label between 2001 and 2005. The band&#x27;s singer, Colin Meloy, also released a solo album on the label in April 2008. Other notable releases by Kill Rock Stars include albums by the Paper Chase, Jeff Hanson, Unwound, Marnie Stern, the Gossip, Mecca Normal, Two Ton Boa and Comet Gain; spoken word albums by Kathy Acker and Miranda July; and reissues of work by earlier punk/post-punk bands such as Kleenex/Liliput, Essential Logic, and Delta 5.

In October 2006, Slim Moon, the label&#x27;s owner, announced he would be departing Kill Rock Stars to work as an A&amp;R representative at Nonesuch Records, a Warner Music Group subsidiary. Moon&#x27;s wife, Portia Sabin, then took over ownership of Kill Rock Stars. In 2007, the label released eleven records, including &quot;New Moon&quot;, a collection of songs recorded by Elliott Smith between 1994 and 1997. The label has begun to further diversify its roster: since 2013, Kill Rock Stars has released albums by comedians including W. Kamau Bell, Nathan Brannon, Kurt Braunohler, River Butcher, Cameron Esposito, Emily Heller, Hot Tub with Kurt and Kristen, Ian Karmel, Hari Kondabolu, and Amy Miller.

In September 2019, Kill Rock Stars issued a press release announcing Slim Moon&#x27;s return to management of the label after a thirteen-year hiatus, as well as the signing of Portland band MAITA; the press release described the signing as &quot;both previous label head Portia Sabin&#x27;s last act and the first initiative of Slim Moon in his second tenure as guiding light of KRS&quot;.

In February 2022, it was announced that independent music company Exceleration Music had acquired the Kill Rock Stars catalog and formed a partnership with its founder, Slim Moon. Under the deal, Moon would continue to handle A&amp;R and would be actively signing and developing new artists.

<doc id="50677" wikidata="Q67972035" url="?curid=50677" title="Laser printing">
<text>Laser printing is an electrostatic digital printing process. It produces high-quality text and graphics (and moderate-quality photographs) by repeatedly passing a laser beam back and forth over a negatively charged cylinder called a &quot;drum&quot; to define a differentially charged image. The drum then selectively collects electrically charged powdered ink (toner), and transfers the image to paper, which is then heated to permanently fuse the text, imagery, or both to the paper. As with digital photocopiers, laser printers employ a xerographic printing process. Laser printing differs from traditional xerography as implemented in analog photocopiers in that in the latter, the image is formed by reflecting light off an existing document onto the exposed drum.

The laser printer was invented at Xerox PARC in the 1970s. Laser printers were introduced for the office and then home markets in subsequent years by IBM, Canon, Xerox, Apple, Hewlett-Packard and many others. Over the decades, quality and speed have increased as prices have decreased, and the once cutting-edge printing devices are now ubiquitous.

==History==

In the 1960s, the Xerox Corporation held a dominant position in the photocopier market. In 1969, Gary Starkweather, who worked in Xerox&#x27;s product development department, had the idea of using a laser beam to &quot;draw&quot; an image of what was to be copied directly onto the copier drum. After transferring to the recently formed Palo Alto Research Center (Xerox PARC) in 1971, Starkweather adapted a Xerox 7000 copier to make SLOT (Scanned Laser Output Terminal). In 1972, Starkweather worked with Butler Lampson and Ronald Rider to add a control system and character generator, resulting in a printer called EARS (Ethernet, Alto Research character generator, Scanned laser output terminal)—which later became the Xerox 9700 laser printer. In 1976, the first commercial implementation of a laser printer, the IBM 3800, was released. It was designed for data centers, where it replaced line printers attached to mainframe computers. The IBM 3800 was used for high-volume printing on continuous stationery, and achieved speeds of 215 pages per minute (ppm), at a resolution of 240 dots per inch (dpi). Over 8,000 of these printers were sold. 

Soon after, in 1977, the Xerox 9700 was brought to market. Unlike the IBM 3800, the Xerox 9700 was not targeted to replace any particular existing printers; however, it did have limited support for the loading of fonts. The Xerox 9700 excelled at printing high-value documents on cut-sheet paper with varying content (e.g., insurance policies). Inspired by the Xerox 9700&#x27;s commercial success, Japanese camera and optics company Canon developed in 1979 the Canon LBP-10, a low-cost desktop laser printer. Canon then began work on a much-improved print engine, the Canon CX, resulting in the LBP-CX printer. Having no experience in selling to computer users, Canon sought partnerships with three Silicon Valley companies: Diablo Data Systems (who rejected the offer), Hewlett-Packard (HP), and Apple Computer. 

In 1981, the first small personal computer designed for office use, the Xerox Star 8010, reached market. The system used a desktop metaphor that was unsurpassed in commercial sales, until the Apple Macintosh. Although it was innovative, the Star workstation was a prohibitively expensive () system, affordable only to a fraction of the businesses and institutions at which it was targeted. Later, in 1984, the first laser printer intended for mass-market sales, the HP LaserJet, was released; it used the Canon CX engine, controlled by HP software. The LaserJet was quickly followed by printers from Brother Industries, IBM, and others. First-generation machines had large photosensitive drums, of circumference greater than the loaded paper&#x27;s length. Once faster-recovery coatings were developed, the drums could touch the paper multiple times in a pass, and therefore be smaller in diameter. A year later, Apple introduced the LaserWriter (also based on the Canon CX engine), but used the newly released PostScript page-description language (up until this point, each manufacturer used its own proprietary page-description language, making the supporting software complex and expensive). PostScript allowed the use of text, fonts, graphics, images, and color largely independent of the printer&#x27;s brand or resolution. PageMaker, developed by Aldus for the Macintosh and LaserWriter, was also released in 1985 and the combination became very popular for desktop publishing.
Laser printers brought exceptionally fast and high-quality text printing in multiple fonts on a page, to the business and home markets. No other commonly available printer during this era could also offer this combination of features.

==Printing process==
A laser beam projects an image of the page to be printed onto an electrically charged, photoconductive, rotating, cylindrical drum. Photoconductivity conducts charged electrons away from the areas exposed to laser light. Powdered ink (toner) particles are then electrostatically attracted to remaining areas of the drum that have not been laser-beamed. 

The drum then transfers the image onto paper which is passed through the machine by direct contact. Finally, the paper is passed onto a finisher, which uses heat to instantly fuse the toner that represents the image onto the paper.

The laser is typically an aluminium gallium arsenide (AlGaAs) semiconductor laser), which emits red or infrared light. 

The drum is coated with selenium, or more recently, with an organic photoconductor made of N-vinylcarbazole, an organic monomer.

There are typically seven steps involved in the process, detailed in the sections below.
&#x27;
===Raster image processing===
The document to be printed is encoded in a page description language such as PostScript, Printer Command Language (PCL), or Open XML Paper Specification (OpenXPS). The raster image processor (RIP) converts the page description into a bitmap which is stored in the printer&#x27;s raster memory. Each horizontal strip of dots across the page is known as a raster line or scan line.

Laser printing differs from other printing technologies in that each page is always rendered in a single continuous process without any pausing in the middle, while other technologies like inkjet can pause every few lines. To avoid a buffer underrun (where the laser reaches a point on the page before it has the dots to draw there), a laser printer typically needs enough raster memory to hold the bitmap image of an entire page.

Memory requirements increase with the square of the dots per inch, so 600 dpi requires a minimum of 4 megabytes for monochrome, and 16 megabytes for color (still at 600 dpi). For fully graphical output using a page description language, a minimum of 1 megabyte of memory is needed to store an entire monochrome letter- or A4-sized page of dots at 300 dpi. At 300 dpi, there are 90,000 dots per square inch (300 dots per linear inch). A typical 8.5 × 11 sheet of paper has margins, reducing the printable area to , or 84 square inches. 84 sq/in × 90,000 dots per sq/in = 7,560,000 dots. 1 megabyte = 1,048,576 bytes, or 8,388,608 bits, which is just large enough to hold the entire page at 300 dpi, leaving about 100 kilobytes to spare for use by the raster image processor.

In a color printer, each of the four CMYK toner layers is stored as a separate bitmap, and all four layers are typically preprocessed before printing begins, so a minimum of 4 megabytes is needed for a full-color letter-size or A4-size page at 300 dpi.

During the 1980s, memory chips were still very expensive, which is why entry-level laser printers in that era always came with four-digit suggested retail prices in US dollars. The primitive microprocessors in early personal computers were so underpowered and insufficient for graphics work that attached laser printers usually had more onboard processing power. Memory prices later decreased significantly, while rapid improvements in the performance of PCs and peripheral cables (most importantly, SCSI) enabled the development of low-end laser printers which offload rasterization to the sending PC. For such printers, the operating system&#x27;s print spooler renders the raw bitmap of each page into the PC&#x27;s system memory at the target resolution, then sends that bitmap directly to the laser (at the expense of slowing down all other programs on the sending PC). The appearance of so-called &quot;dumb&quot; or &quot;host-based&quot; laser printers from NEC made it possible for the retail cost of low-end 300-dpi laser printers to decrease to as low as US$700 by early 1994 and US$600 by early 1995. In September 1997, HP introduced the host-based LaserJet 6L, which could print 600 dpi text at up to six pages per minute for only US$400.

1200 dpi printers have been widely available in the home market since 2008. 2400 dpi electrophotographic printing plate makers, essentially laser printers that print on plastic sheets, are also available.

===Charging===

In older printers, a corona wire positioned parallel to the drum or, in more recent printers, a primary charge roller, projects an electrostatic charge onto the photoreceptor (otherwise named the photoconductor unit), a revolving photosensitive drum or belt, which is capable of holding an electrostatic charge on its surface while it is in the dark.

An AC bias voltage is applied to the primary charge roller to remove any residual charges left by previous images. The roller will also apply a DC bias on the drum surface to ensure a uniform negative potential.

Numerous patents describe the photosensitive drum coating as a silicon &quot;sandwich&quot; with a photocharging layer, a charge leakage barrier layer, as well as a surface layer. One version uses amorphous silicon containing hydrogen as the light-receiving layer, boron nitride as a charge leakage barrier layer, as well as a surface layer of doped silicon, notably silicon with oxygen or nitrogen which at sufficient concentration resembles machining silicon nitride.

===Exposing===
A laser printer uses a laser because lasers are able to form highly focused, precise, and intense beams of light, especially over the short distances inside of a printer. The laser is aimed at a rotating polygonal mirror which directs the light beam through a system of lenses and mirrors onto the photoreceptor drum, writing pixels at rates up to sixty-five million times per second. The drum continues to rotate during the sweep, and the angle of sweep is canted very slightly to compensate for this motion. The stream of rasterized data held in the printer&#x27;s memory rapidly turns the laser on and off as it sweeps.

The laser beam neutralizes (or reverses) the charge on the surface of the drum, leaving a static electric negative image on the drum&#x27;s surface which will repel the negatively charged toner particles. The areas on the drum which were struck by the laser, however, momentarily have no charge, and the toner being pressed against the drum by the toner-coated developer roll in the next step moves from the roll&#x27;s rubber surface to the charged portions of the surface of the drum.

Some non-laser printers (LED printers) use an array of light-emitting diodes spanning the width of the page to generate an image, rather than using a laser. &quot;Exposing&quot; is also known as &quot;writing&quot; in some documentation.

===Developing===
As the drums rotate, toner is continuously applied in a 15-micron-thick layer to the &quot;developer roll&quot;. The surface of the photoreceptor with the latent image is exposed to the toner-covered developer roll.

Toner consists of fine particles of dry plastic powder mixed with carbon black or coloring agents. The toner particles are given a negative charge inside the toner cartridge, and as they emerge onto the developer drum they are electrostatically attracted to the photoreceptor&#x27;s latent image (the areas on the surface of the drum which had been struck by the laser). Because negative charges repel each other, the negatively charged toner particles will not adhere to the drum where the negative charge (imparted previously by the charge roller) remains.

===Transferring===
A sheet of paper is then rolled under the photoreceptor drum, which has been coated with a pattern of toner particles in the exact places where the laser struck it moments before. The toner particles have a very weak attraction to both the drum and the paper, but the bond to the drum is weaker and the particles transfer once again, this time from the drum&#x27;s surface to the paper&#x27;s surface. Some machines also use a positively charged &quot;transfer roller&quot; on the backside of the paper to help pull the negatively charged toner from the photoreceptor drum to the paper.

===Fusing===

The paper passes through rollers in the fuser assembly, where temperatures up to and pressure are used to permanently bond the toner to the paper. One roller is usually a hollow tube (heat roller) and the other is a rubber-backed roller (pressure roller). A radiant heat lamp is suspended in the center of the hollow tube, and its infrared energy uniformly heats the roller from the inside. For proper bonding of the toner, the fuser roller must be uniformly hot.

Some printers use a very thin flexible metal foil roller, so there is less thermal mass to be heated and the fuser can more quickly reach operating temperature. If paper moves through the fuser more slowly, there is more roller contact time for the toner to melt, and the fuser can operate at a lower temperature. Smaller, inexpensive laser printers typically print slowly, due to this energy-saving design, compared to large high-speed printers where paper moves more rapidly through a high-temperature fuser with very short contact time.

===Cleaning and recharging===

As the drum completes a revolution, it is exposed to an electrically neutral soft plastic blade that cleans any remaining toner from the photoreceptor drum and deposits it into a waste reservoir. A charge roller then re-establishes a uniform negative charge on the surface of the now-clean drum, readying it to be struck again by the laser.

===Continuous printing===
Once the raster image generation is complete, all steps of the printing process can occur one after the other in rapid succession. This permits the use of a very small and compact unit, where the photoreceptor is charged, rotates a few degrees and is scanned, rotates a few more degrees, and is developed, and so forth. The entire process can be completed before the drum completes one revolution.

Different printers implement these steps in distinct ways. LED printers use a linear array of light-emitting diodes to &quot;write&quot; the light on the drum. The toner is based on either wax or plastic, so that when the paper passes through the fuser assembly, the particles of toner melt. The paper may or may not be oppositely charged. The fuser can be an infrared oven, a heated pressure roller, or (on some very fast, expensive printers) a xenon flash lamp. The warmup process that a laser printer goes through when power is initially applied to the printer consists mainly of heating the fuser element.

===Malfunctions===
The mechanism inside a laser printer is somewhat delicate and, once damaged, often impossible to repair. The drum, in particular, is a critical component: it must not be left exposed to ambient light for more than a few hours, as light is what causes it to lose its charge and will eventually wear it out. Anything that interferes with the operation of the laser such as a scrap of torn paper may prevent the laser from discharging some portion of the drum, causing those areas to appear as white vertical streaks. If the neutral wiper blade fails to remove residual toner from the drum&#x27;s surface, that toner may circulate on the drum a second time, causing smears on the printed page with each revolution. If the charge roller becomes damaged or does not have enough power, it may fail to adequately negatively charge the surface of the drum, allowing the drum to pick up excessive toner on the next revolution from the developer roll and causing a repeated but fainter image from the previous revolution to appear down the page.

If the toner doctor blade does not ensure that a smooth, even layer of toner is applied to the developer roll, the resulting printout may have white streaks from this in places where the blade has scraped off too much toner. Alternatively, if the blade allows too much toner to remain on the developer roll, the toner particles might come loose as the roll turns, precipitate onto the paper below, and become bonded to the paper during the fusing process. This will result in a general darkening of the printed page in broad vertical stripes with very soft edges.

If the fuser roller does not reach a high enough temperature or if the ambient humidity is too high, the toner will not fuse well to the paper and may flake off after printing. If the fuser is too hot, the plastic component of the toner may smear, causing the printed text to look like it is wet or smudged, or may cause the melted toner to soak through the paper to the backside.

Different manufacturers claim that their toners are specifically developed for their printers and that other toner formulations may not match the original specifications in terms of either tendency to accept a negative charge, to move to the discharged areas of the photoreceptor drum from the developer roll, to fuse appropriately to the paper, or to come off the drum cleanly in each revolution.

==Performance==
As with most electronic devices, the cost of laser printers has decreased significantly over the years. In 1984, the HP LaserJet sold for $3500, had trouble with even small, low-resolution graphics, and weighed . By the late 1990s, monochrome laser printers had become inexpensive enough for home-office use, having displaced other printing technologies, although color inkjet printers (see below) still had advantages in photo quality reproduction. , low-end monochrome laser printers can sell for less than $75, and while these printers tend to lack onboard processing and rely on the host computer to generate a raster image, they nonetheless outperform the 1984 LaserJet in nearly all situations.

Laser printer speed can vary widely, and depends on many factors, including the graphic intensity of the job being processed. The fastest models can print over 200 monochrome pages per minute (12,000 pages per hour). The fastest color laser printers can print over 100 pages per minute (6000 pages per hour). Very high-speed laser printers are used for mass mailings of personalized documents, such as credit card or utility bills, and are competing with lithography in some commercial applications.

The cost of this technology depends on a combination of factors, including the cost of paper, toner, drum replacement, as well as the replacement of other items such as the fuser assembly and transfer assembly. Often printers with soft plastic drums can have a very high cost of ownership that does not become apparent until the drum requires replacement.

Duplex printing (printing on both sides of the paper) can halve paper costs and reduce filing volumes, albeit at a slower page-printing speed because of the longer paper path. Formerly only available on high-end printers, duplexers are now common on mid-range office printers, though not all printers can accommodate a duplexing unit.

In a commercial environment such as an office, it is becoming increasingly common for businesses to use external software that increases the performance and efficiency of laser printers in the workplace. The software can be used to set rules dictating how employees interact with printers, such as setting limits on how many pages can be printed per day, limiting usage of color ink, and flagging jobs that appear to be wasteful.

==Color laser printers==

Color laser printers use colored toner (dry ink), typically cyan, magenta, yellow, and black (CMYK). While monochrome printers only use one laser scanner assembly, color printers often have two or more, often one for each of the four colors.

Color printing adds complexity to the printing process because very slight misalignments known as registration errors can occur between printing each color, causing unintended color fringing, blurring, or light/dark streaking along the edges of colored regions. To permit a high registration accuracy, some color laser printers use a large rotating belt called a &quot;transfer belt&quot;. The transfer belt passes in front of all the toner cartridges and each of the toner layers are precisely applied to the belt. The combined layers are then applied to the paper in a uniform single step.

Color printers usually have a higher cost per page than monochrome printers, even if printing monochrome-only pages.

Liquid electrophotography (LEP) is a similar process used in HP Indigo presses that uses electrostatically charged ink instead of toner, and using a heated transfer roller instead of a fuser, that melts the charged ink particles before applying them to the paper.

===Color laser transfer printers===

Color laser transfer printers are designed to produce transfer media which are transfer sheets designed to be applied by means of a heat press. These transfers are typically used to make custom T-shirts or custom logo products with corporate or team logos on them.

2-part Color laser transfers are part of a two-step process whereby the color laser printers use colored toner (dry ink), typically cyan, magenta, yellow, and black (CMYK); however, newer printers designed to print on dark T-shirts utilize a special white toner allowing them to make transfers for dark garments or dark business products.

The CMYK color printing process allows for millions of colors to be faithfully represented by the unique imaging process.

===Business-model comparison with inkjet printers===
Manufacturers use a similar business model for both low-cost color laser printers and inkjet printers: the printers are sold cheaply while replacement toners and inks are relatively expensive. A color laser printer&#x27;s average running cost per page is usually slightly less, even though both the laser printer and laser toner cartridge have higher upfront prices, as laser toner cartridges print many more sheets relative to their cost than inkjet cartridges. 

The print quality of color lasers is limited by their resolution (typically 600–1200 dpi) and their use of just four color toners. They often have trouble printing large areas of the same or subtle gradations of color. Inkjet printers designed for printing photos can produce much higher quality color images. An in-depth comparison of inkjet and laser printers suggest that laser printers are the ideal choice for a high quality, volume printer, while inkjet printers tend to focus on large-format printers and household units. Laser printers offer more precise edging and in-depth monochromatic color. In addition, color laser printers are much faster than inkjet printers, although being generally larger and bulkier.

===Anti-counterfeiting marks===
Many modern color laser printers mark printouts by a nearly invisible dot raster, for the purpose of traceability. The dots are yellow and about in size, with a raster of about . This is purportedly the result of a deal between the US government and printer manufacturers to help track counterfeiters. The dots encode data such as printing date, time, and printer serial number in binary-coded decimal on every sheet of paper printed, which allows pieces of paper to be traced by the manufacturer to identify the place of purchase, and sometimes the buyer.

Digital-rights advocacy groups such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation are concerned about this erosion of the privacy and anonymity of those who print. In particular, the tracking dots were implicated as a tool that directly lead to the arrest and conviction of whistleblower Reality Winner.

==Smart chips in toner cartridges==

Similar to inkjet printers, toner cartridges may contain smart chips that reduce the number of pages that can be printed with it (reducing the amount of usable ink or toner in the cartridge to sometimes only 50%), in an effort to increase sales of the toner cartridges. Besides being more expensive for printer users, this technique also increases waste, and thus increases pressure on the environment. For these toner cartridges (as with inkjet cartridges), reset devices can be used to override the limitation set by the smart chip. Also, for some printers, online walk-throughs have been posted to demonstrate how to use up all the ink in the cartridge. These chips offer no benefit to the end-user—some laser printers used an optical mechanism to assess the amount of remaining toner in the cartridge rather than using a chip to electrically count the number of printed pages, and the chip&#x27;s only function was as an alternate method to decrease the cartridge&#x27;s usable life.

==Safety hazards, health risks, and precautions==

===Toner clean-up===
Toner particles are formulated to have electrostatic properties and can develop static electric charges when they rub against other particles, objects, or the interiors of transport systems and vacuum hoses. Static discharge from charged toner particles can ignite combustible particles in a vacuum cleaner bag or cause a small dust explosion if sufficient toner is airborne. Toner particles are so fine that they are poorly filtered by conventional household vacuum cleaner filter bags and blow through the motor or back into the room.

If toner spills into the laser printer, a special type of vacuum cleaner with an electrically conductive hose and a high-efficiency (HEPA) filter may be needed for effective cleaning. These specialized tools are called &quot;ESD-safe&quot; (Electrostatic Discharge-safe) or &quot;toner vacuums&quot;.

===Ozone hazards===
As a normal part of the printing process, the high voltages inside the printer can produce a corona discharge that generates a small amount of ionized oxygen and nitrogen, which react to form ozone and nitrogen oxides. In larger commercial printers and copiers, an activated carbon filter in the air exhaust stream breaks down these noxious gases to prevent pollution of the office environment.

However, some ozone escapes the filtering process in commercial printers, and ozone filters are not used at all in most smaller home printers. When a laser printer or copier is operated for a long period of time in a small, poorly ventilated space, these gases can build up to levels at which the odor of ozone or irritation may be noticed. A potential health hazard is theoretically possible in extreme cases.

===Respiratory health risks===
According to a 2012 study conducted in Queensland, Australia, some printers emit sub-micrometer particles which some suspect may be associated with respiratory diseases. Of 63 printers evaluated in the Queensland University of Technology study, 17 of the strongest emitters were made by HP and one by Toshiba. The machine population studied, however, was only those machines already in place in the building and was thus biased toward specific manufacturers. The authors noted that particle emissions varied substantially even among the same model of machine. According to Professor Morawska of the Queensland University of Technology, one printer emitted as many particles as a burning cigarette:

In December 2011, the Australian government agency Safe Work Australia reviewed existing research and concluded that &quot;no epidemiology studies directly associating laser printer emissions with adverse health outcomes were located&quot; and that several assessments conclude that &quot;risk of direct toxicity and health effects from exposure to laser printer emissions is negligible&quot;. The review also observes that, because the emissions have been shown to be volatile or semi-volatile organic compounds, &quot;it would be logical to expect possible health effects to be more related to the chemical nature of the aerosol rather than the physical character of the &#x27;particulate&#x27; since such emissions are unlikely to be or remain as &#x27;particulates&#x27; after they come into contact with respiratory tissue&quot;.

The German Social Accident Insurance has commissioned a human study project to examine the effects on health resulting from exposure to toner dusts and from photocopying and printing cycles. Volunteers (23 control persons, 15 exposed persons and 14 asthmatics) were exposed to laser printer emissions under defined conditions in an exposure chamber. The findings from the study based on a broad spectrum of processes and subjects fail to confirm that exposure to high laser printer emissions initiates a verifiable pathological process resulting in the reported illnesses.

A much-discussed proposal for reducing emissions from laser printers is to retrofit them with filters. These are fixed with adhesive tape to the printer&#x27;s fan vents to reduce particle emissions. However, all printers have a paper output tray, which is an outlet for particle emissions. Paper output trays cannot be provided with filters, so it is impossible to reduce their contribution to overall emissions with retrofit filters.

===Air-transport ban===
After the 2010 cargo plane bomb plot, in which shipments of laser printers with explosive-filled toner cartridges were discovered on separate cargo airplanes, the US Transportation Security Administration prohibited pass-through passengers from carrying toner or ink cartridges weighing over on inbound flights, in both carry-on and checked luggage. &quot;PC Magazine&quot; noted that the ban would not impact most travelers, as the majority of cartridges do not exceed the prescribed weight.

<doc id="50678" wikidata="Q76747" url="?curid=50678" title="Matthias Jakob Schleiden">
<text>Matthias Jakob Schleiden (; 5 April 1804 – 23 June 1881) was a German botanist and co-founder of cell theory, along with Theodor Schwann and Rudolf Virchow. He published some poems and non-scientific work under the pseudonym Ernst. 

== Career==
Matthias Jakob Schleiden was born in Hamburg. on 5 April 1804. His father was the municipal physician of Hamburg. Schleiden pursued legal studies 
graduating in 1827. He then established a legal practice 

but after a period of emotional depression and attempted suicide, he changed professions. The suicide attempt left a prominent scar across his forehead.

He studied natural science at the University of Göttingen in Göttingen, Germany, but transferred to the University of Berlin in 1835 to study plants. Johann Horkel, Schleiden&#x27;s uncle, encouraged him to study plant embryology. 

He soon developed his love for botany and cats into a full-time pursuit. Schleiden preferred to study plant structure under the microscope. As a professor of botany at the University of Jena, he wrote &quot;Contributions to our Knowledge of Phytogenesis&quot; (1838), in which he stated that all plants are composed of cells. Thus, Schleiden and Schwann became the first to formulate what was then an informal belief as a principle of biology equal in importance to the atomic theory of chemistry. He also recognized the importance of the cell nucleus, discovered in 1831 by the Scottish botanist Robert Brown, and sensed its connection with cell division. In 1838, the two scientists M. J. Schleiden and Theodore Schwann formulated a theory about cellular structure which stated, &#x27;All the living organisms are made up of cells and the cell is the fundamental component of living organismus”. In 1885 Rudolf Virchow stated that all cells are formed from pre-existing cells.

Although Schleiden was not Jewish nor a historian by profession, he was noted for his defense of Judaism and against antisemitism, and wrote two works, &quot;Die Bedeutung der Juden für die Erhaltung und Wiederbelebung der Wissenschaften im Mittelalter&quot; (1877) and &quot;Die Romantik des Martyriums bei den Juden im Mittelalter&quot; (1878), published in English as &quot;The Sciences among the Jews Before and During the Middle Ages&quot; and &quot;The Importance of the Jews for the Preservation and Revival of Learning during the Middle Ages&quot;. 

He became a professor of botany at the University of Dorpat in 1863. He concluded that all plant parts are made of cells and that an embryonic plant organism arises from one cell.

He died in Frankfurt am Main on 23 June 1881. 

==Evolution==

Schleiden was an early advocate of evolution. In a lecture on the &quot;History of the Vegetable World&quot; published in his book &quot;Die Pflanze und ihr Leben&quot; (&quot;The Plant: A Biography&quot;) (1848) was a passage that embraced the transmutation of species. He was one of the first German biologists to accept Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution. He has been described as a leading proponent of Darwinism in Germany.

With &quot;Die Pflanze und ihr Leben&quot;, reprinted six times by 1864, and his &quot;Studien: Populäre Vorträge&quot; (&quot;Studies: Popular Lectures&quot;), both written in a way that was accessible to lay readers, Schleiden contributed to creating a momentum for popularizing science in Germany.

Schleiden’s popular writings included two volumes of poetry which appeared under the pseudonym “Ernst” in 1858 and 1873. American composer Harriet P. Sawyer set one of his poems to music with her song “Die ersten Tropfen fallen.”

<doc id="50679" wikidata="Q584101" url="?curid=50679" title="Dot matrix printing">
<text>Dot matrix printing, sometimes called impact matrix printing, is a computer printing process in which ink is applied to a surface using a relatively low-resolution dot matrix for layout. Dot matrix printers are a type of impact printer that prints using a fixed number of pins or wires and typically use a print head that moves back and forth or in an up-and-down motion on the page and prints by impact, striking an ink-soaked cloth ribbon against the paper. They were also known as serial dot matrix printers. Unlike typewriters or line printers that use a similar print mechanism, a dot matrix printer can print arbitrary patterns and not just specific characters.

The perceived quality of dot matrix printers depends on the vertical and horizontal resolution and the ability of the printer to overlap adjacent dots. 9-pin and 24-pin are common; this specifies the number of pins in a specific vertically aligned space. With 24-pin printers, the horizontal movement can slightly overlap dots, producing visually superior output (near letter-quality or NLQ), usually at the cost of speed.

Dot matrix printing is typically distinguished from non-impact methods, such as inkjet, thermal, or laser printing, which also use a bitmap to represent the printed work. These other technologies can support higher dot resolutions and print more quickly, with less noise. Unlike other technologies, impact printers can print on multi-part forms, allowing multiple copies to be made simultaneously, often on paper of different colors. They can also employ endless printing using continuous paper that is fanfolded and perforated so that pages can be easily torn from each other.

==History==
In 1925, Rudolf Hell invented the Hellschreiber, an early facsimile-like dot matrixbased teletypewriter device, patented in 1929.

Between 1952 and 1954 Fritz Karl Preikschat filed five patent applications for his so-called &quot;PKT printer&quot;, a dot matrix teletypewriter built between 1954 and 1956 in Germany. Like the earlier Hellschreiber, it still used electromechanical means of coding and decoding, but it used a start-stop method (asynchronous transmission) rather than synchronous transmission for communication. In 1956, while he was employed at Telefonbau und Normalzeit GmbH (TuN, later called Tenovis), the device was offered to the Deutsche Bundespost (German Post Office), which did not show interest.
When Preikschat emigrated to the US in 1957 he sold the rights to utilize the applications in any country (except the USA) to TuN. The prototype was also shown to General Mills in 1957. An improved transistorized design became the basis for a portable dot matrix facsimile machine, which was prototyped and evaluated for military use by Boeing around 1966–1967.

In 1968, the Japanese manufacturer OKI introduced its first serial impact dot matrix printer (SIDM), the OKI Wiredot. The printer supported a character generator for 128 characters with a print matrix of 7 × 5. It was aimed at governmental, financial, scientific and educational markets. For this achievement, OKI received an award from the Information Processing Society of Japan (IPSJ) in 2013.

In 1970 Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) introduced an impact dot matrix printer, the LA30, as did Centronics (then of Hudson, New Hampshire): the Centronics 101. The search for a reliable printer mechanism led it to develop a relationship with Brother Industries, Ltd of Japan, and the sale of Centronics-badged Brother printer mechanisms equipped with a Centronics print head and Centronics electronics. Unlike Digital, Centronics concentrated on the low-end line printer marketplace with their distinctive units. In the process, they designed the parallel electrical interface that was to become standard on most printers until it began to be replaced by the Universal Serial Bus (USB) in the late 1990s.

DEC was a major vendor, albeit with a focus on use with their PDP minicomputer line. Their LA30 30 character/second (CPS) dot matrix printer, the first of many, was introduced in 1970. In the mid-1980s, dot-matrix printers were dropping in price, and began to outsell daisywheel printers, due to their higher speed and versatility. The Apple ImageWriter was a popular consumer dot matrix printer in the 1980s until the mid-1990s.

In the 1970s and 1980s, dot matrix impact printers were generally considered the best combination of cost and versatility, and until the 1990s were by far the most common form of printer used with personal and home computers.

Increased pincount of the printhead from 7, 8, 9 or 12 pins to 18, 24, 27, or 36 permitted superior print quality, which was necessary for success in Asian markets to print legible CJKV characters. Epson&#x27;s 24-pin LQ-series rose to become the new de facto standard, at 24/180 inch (per pass – 7.5 lpi). Not only could a 24-pin printer lay down a denser dot-pattern in a single pass, it could simultaneously cover a larger area and print more quickly. Although the text quality of a 24-pin was still visibly inferior to a true letter-quality printer such as a daisy wheel or laser printer, print quality was greatly superior to a 9-pin printer. As manufacturing costs declined, 24-pin printers gradually replaced 9-pin printers.

By the dawn of the 1990s, inkjet printers became more common as PC printers.

==Design==


Dot matrix printing uses a print head that moves back-and-forth, or in an up-and-down motion, on the page and prints by impact, striking an ink-soaked cloth ribbon against the paper, much like the print mechanism on a typewriter. However, unlike a typewriter or daisy wheel printer, letters are drawn out of a dot matrix, and thus, varied fonts and arbitrary graphics can be produced.

Each dot is produced by a tiny metal rod, also called a &quot;wire&quot; or &quot;pin&quot;, which is driven forward by the power of a tiny electromagnet or solenoid, either directly or through small levers (pawls). Facing the ribbon and the paper is a small guide plate named ribbon mask holder or protector, sometimes also called &quot;butterfly&quot; for its typical shape. It is pierced with holes to serve as guides for the pins. The plate may be made of hard plastic or an artificial jewel such as sapphire or ruby.

The portion of the printer that contains the pin is called the print head. When running the printer, it generally prints one line of text at a time. The printer head is attached to a metal bar that ensures correct alignment, but horizontal positioning is controlled by a band that attaches to sprockets on two wheels at each side which is then driven with an electric motor. This band may be made of stainless steel, phosphor bronze or beryllium copper alloys, nylon or various synthetic materials with a twisted nylon core to prevent stretching. Actual position can be found out either by dead count using a stepper motor, rotary encoder attached to one wheel, or a transparent plastic band with markings that is read by an optical sensor on the printer head (common on inkjets).

Because the printing involves mechanical pressure, dot matrix printers can create carbon copies and carbonless copies.

Although nearly all inkjet, thermal, and laser printers also print closely spaced dots rather than continuous lines or characters, it is not customary to call them dot matrix printers.

Dot matrix printers have one of the lowest printing costs per page.

They are able to use fanfold continuous paper with tractor holes.

Dot matrix printers create noise when the pins or typeface strike the ribbon to the paper, and sound-damping enclosures may have to be used in quiet environments.

They can only print lower-resolution graphics, with limited color performance, limited quality, and lower speeds compared to non-impact printers.

==Variations==


The common serial dot matrix printers use a horizontally moving print head. The print head can be thought of featuring a single vertical column of seven or more pins approximately the height of a character box. In reality, the pins are arranged in up to four vertically or/and horizontally slightly displaced columns in order to increase the dot density and print speed through interleaving without causing the pins to jam. Thereby, up to 48 pins can be used to form the characters of a line while the print head moves horizontally. The printing speed of serial dot matrix printers with moving heads varies from 30 to 1550 characters per second (cps).

In a considerably different configuration, so called line dot matrix printers or line matrix printers use a fixed print head almost as wide as the paper path utilizing a horizontal line of thousands of pins for printing. Sometimes two horizontally slightly displaced rows are used to improve the effective dot density through interleaving. While still line-oriented, these printers for the professional heavy-duty market effectively print a whole line at once while the paper moves forward below the print head. Line matrix printers are capable of printing much more than 1000 cps, resulting in a throughput of up to 800 pages per hour.

A variation on the dot matrix printer was the cross hammer dot printer, patented by Seikosha in 1982. The smooth cylindrical roller of a conventional printer was replaced by a spinning, fluted cylinder. The print head was a simple hammer, with a vertical projecting edge, operated by an electromagnet. Where the vertical edge of the hammer intersected the horizontal flute of the cylinder, compressing the paper and ribbon between them, a single dot was marked on the paper. Characters were built up of multiple dots.

==Manufacturers and models==
===DEC===

Unlike the LA30&#x27;s 80-column, uppercase-only 5 x 7 dot matrix, DEC&#x27;s product line grew. New models included:
* LA36 (1974): supported upper and lower case, with up to 132 columns of text (also 30 CPS)
* LA34: a lower-cost alternative to the LA36
* LA38: an LA34 with more features
* LA180: 180 CPS
* LS120: 120 CPS
* LA120: 180 CPS (and some advanced features)
* LA12: a portable terminal – the DECwriter Correspondent

====LA30====
The DECwriter LA30 was a 30 character per second dot matrix printing terminal introduced in 1970 by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) of Maynard, Massachusetts

It printed 80 columns of uppercase-only 7 × 5 dot matrix characters across a unique-sized paper. The printhead was driven by a stepper motor and the paper was advanced by a noisy solenoid ratchet drive. The LA30 was available with both a parallel interface (LA30-P) and a serial interface (LA30-S); however, the serial LA30 required the use of fill characters during the carriage-return. In 1972, a receive-only variation named LA30A became available.

====LA36====
The LA30 was followed in 1974 by the LA36, which achieved far greater commercial success, becoming for a time the standard dot matrix computer terminal. The LA36 used the same print head as the LA30 but could print on forms of any width up to 132 columns of mixed-case output on standard green bar fanfold paper. The carriage was moved by a much-more-capable servo drive using a DC electric motor and an optical encoder / tachometer. The paper was moved by a stepper motor. The LA36 was only available with a serial interface but unlike the earlier LA30, no fill characters were required. This was possible because, while the printer never communicated at faster than 30 characters per second, the mechanism was actually capable of printing at 60 characters per second. During the carriage return period, characters were &quot;buffered&quot; for subsequent printing at full speed during a catch-up period. The two-tone buzz produced by 60-character-per-second catch-up printing followed by 30-character-per-second ordinary printing was a distinctive feature of the LA36, quickly copied by many other manufacturers well into the 1990s. Most efficient dot matrix printers used this buffering technique.

Digital technology later broadened the basic LA36 line into a wide variety of dot matrix printers.

====LA50====
The DEC LA50 was designed to be a &quot;compact, dot matrix&quot; printer. When in graphic mode (as opposed to text mode), the printhead can generate graphic images. When in (bitmap) graphics mode, the LA50 can receive and print Sixel graphics format.
===Centronics 101===

The Centronics 101 (introduced 1970) was highly innovative and affordable at its inception. Some selected specifications:
* Print speed: 165 characters per second
* Weight: 155 pounds (70.3 kg)
* Size: 27 ½&quot; W x 11 ¼&quot; H x 19 ¼ D (approx. 70 cm x 29 cm x 49 cm)
* Shipping: 200 pounds (approx. 91 kg), wooden crate, unpacked by removal of 36 screws
* Characters: 62: 10 numeric, 26 upper case, and 26 special characters (no lower case)
* Character size: 10 characters per inch (10 &quot;pitch&quot;)
* Line spacing: 6 lines per inch (6 LPI)
* Vertical control: punched tape reader for top of form and vertical tab
* Forms thickness: original plus four copies

===IBM 5103===

The IBM 5103 was the only IBM printer that could be attached to the IBM 5100, an early day portable computer. Printing was 8 DPI, 10 pitch, 6 LPI, and capable of printing bidirectionally from a 128-character set. Two models were offered: 80 and 120 characters per second.

====Near Letter Quality (NLQ)====

&quot;Near Letter Quality&quot; mode—informally specified as almost good enough to be used in a business letter—endowed dot-matrix printers with a simulated typewriter-like quality. By using multiple passes of the carriage, and higher dot density, the printer could increase the effective resolution. In 1985, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the use of &quot;&quot;near letter-quality,&quot; or NLQ&quot; as &quot;just a neat little bit of hype&quot; but acknowledged that they &quot;really show their stuff in the area of fonts, print enhancements and graphics.&quot;

NLQ printers could generally be set to print in &quot;draft mode&quot;, in which case a single pass of the print head per line would be used. This produced lower quality print at much higher output speed.

==PC usage==
In 1985, &quot;PC Magazine&quot; wrote &quot;for the average personal computer user dot matrix remains the most workable choice&quot;. At the time, IBM sold Epson&#x27;s MX-80 as their IBM 5152.

Another technology, inkjet printing, which uses the razor and blades business model (give away the razor handle, make money on the razor blade) has reduced the value of the low cost for the printer: &quot;a price per milliliter on par with liquid gold&quot; for the ink/toner.

===Personal computers===
In June 1978, the Epson TX-80/TP-80, an 8-pin dot-matrix printer mainly used for the Commodore PET computer, was released. This and its successor, the 9-pin MX-80/MP-80 (introduced in 1979–1980), sparked the popularity of impact printers in the personal computer market. The MX-80 combined affordability with good-quality text output (for its time). Early impact printers (including the MX) were notoriously loud during operation, a result of the hammer-like mechanism in the print head. The MX-80&#x27;s low dot density (60 dpi horizontal, 72 dpi vertical) produced printouts of a distinctive &quot;computerized&quot; quality. When compared to the crisp typewriter quality of a daisy-wheel printer, the dot-matrix printer&#x27;s legibility appeared especially bad. In office applications, output quality was a serious issue, as the dot-matrix text&#x27;s readability would rapidly degrade with each photocopy generation.

====PC software====
Initially, third-party printer enhancement software offered a quick fix to the quality issue. General strategies were:
* doublestrike (print each line twice), and
* double-density mode (slow the print head to allow denser and more precise dot placement).

Some newer dot-matrix impact printers could reproduce bitmap images via &quot;dot-addressable&quot; capability. In 1981, Epson offered a retrofit EPROM kit called Graftrax to add this to many early MX series printers. Banners and signs produced with software that used this ability, such as Broderbund&#x27;s Print Shop, became ubiquitous in offices and schools throughout the 1980s.

As carriage speed increased and dot density increased (from 60 dpi up to 240 dpi), with some adding color printing, additional typefaces allowed the user to vary the text appearance of printouts. Proportional-spaced fonts allowed the printer to imitate the non-uniform character widths of a typesetter, and also darker printouts. &#x27;User-downloadable fonts&#x27; gave until the printer was powered off or soft-reset. The user could embed up to two NLQ custom typefaces in addition to the printer&#x27;s built-in (ROM) typefaces.
===Contemporary use===
The desktop impact printer was gradually replaced by the inkjet printer. When Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s expired on steam-propelled photolithographically produced ink-jet heads in 2004, the inkjet mechanism became available to the printer industry. For applications that did not require impact (e.g. carbon-copy printing), the inkjet was superior in nearly all respects: comparatively quiet operation, faster print speed, and output quality almost as good as a laser printer. By 1995, inkjet technology had surpassed dot matrix impact technology in the mainstream market and relegated dot matrix to niche applications.

, dot matrix impact technology remains in use in devices and applications such as:
* Cash registers,
* ATMs,
* Banking, passbook and cashier&#x27;s checks,
* Time cards and parking stubs,
* Multi-layer contracts for signature,
* Fire alarm systems,
* Point-of-sale terminals,
* British and Irish fire stations for turnout sheets,
* Applications requiring continuous output on fan-fold paper.

Thermal printing is gradually supplanting them in some of these applications, but full-size dot-matrix impact printers are still used to print multi-part stationery. For example, dot matrix impact printers are still used at bank tellers and auto repair shops, and other applications where use of tractor feed paper is desirable such as data logging and aviation. Most of these printers now come with USB interfaces as a standard feature to facilitate connections to modern computers without legacy ports.

<doc id="50680" wikidata="Q142031" url="?curid=50680" title="Funicular">
<text>A funicular ( ) is a type of cable railway system that connects points along a railway track laid on a steep slope. The system is characterized by two counterbalanced carriages (also called cars or trains) permanently attached to opposite ends of a haulage cable, which is looped over a pulley at the upper end of the track. The result of such a configuration is that the two carriages move synchronously: as one ascends, the other descends at an equal speed. This feature distinguishes funiculars from inclined elevators, which have a single car that is hauled uphill.

The term &quot;funicular&quot; derives from the Latin word , the diminutive of , meaning &#x27;rope&#x27;.

==Operation==
In a funicular, both cars are permanently connected to the opposite ends of the same cable, known as a &quot;haul rope&quot;; this haul rope runs through a system of pulleys at the upper end of the line. If the railway track is not perfectly straight, the cable is guided along the track using sheaves – unpowered pulleys that simply allow the cable to change direction. While one car is pulled upwards by one end of the haul rope, the other car descends the slope at the other end. Since the weight of the two cars is counterbalanced (except for the weight of passengers), no lifting force is required to move them; the engine only has to lift the cable itself and the excess passengers, and supply the energy lost to friction by the cars&#x27; wheels and the pulleys.

For passenger comfort, funicular carriages are often (although not always) constructed so that the floor of the passenger deck is horizontal, and not necessarily parallel to the sloped track.

In some installations, the cars are also attached to a second cable – &quot;bottom towrope&quot; – which runs through a pulley at the bottom of the incline. In these designs, one of the pulleys must be designed as a tensioning wheel to avoid slack in the ropes. One advantage of such an installation is the fact that the weight of the rope is balanced between the carriages; therefore, the engine no longer needs to use any power to lift the cable itself. This practice is used on funiculars with slopes below 6%, funiculars using sledges instead of carriages, or any other case where it is not ensured that the descending car is always able to pull out the cable from the pulley in the station on the top of the incline. It is also used in systems where the engine room is located at the lower end of the track (such as the upper half of the Great Orme Tramway) – in such systems, the cable that runs through the top of the incline is still necessary to prevent the carriages from coasting down the incline.

===Types of power systems===
====Cable drive====

In most modern funiculars, neither of the two carriages is equipped with an engine of its own. Instead, the propulsion is provided by an electric motor in the engine room (typically at the upper end of the track); the motor is linked via a speed-reducing gearbox to a large pulley – a &quot;drive bullwheel&quot; – which then controls the movement of the haul rope using friction. Some early funiculars were powered in the same way, but using steam engines or other types of motor. The bullwheel has two grooves: after the first half turn around it the cable returns via an auxiliary pulley. This arrangement has the advantage of having twice the contact area between the cable and the groove, and returning the downward-moving cable in the same plane as the upward-moving one. Modern installations also use high friction liners to enhance the friction between the bullwheel grooves and the cable.

For emergency and service purposes two sets of brakes are used at the engine room: the emergency brake directly grips the bullwheel, and the service brake is mounted at the high speed shaft of the gear. In case of an emergency the cars are also equipped with spring-applied, hydraulically opened rail brakes.

The first funicular caliper brakes which clamp each side of the crown of the rail were invented by the Swiss entrepreneurs Franz Josef Bucher and Josef Durrer and implemented at the , opened in 1893. The Abt rack and pinion system was also used on some funiculars for speed control or emergency braking.
====Water counterbalancing====


Many early funiculars were built using water tanks under the floor of each car, which were filled or emptied until just sufficient imbalance was achieved to allow movement, and a few such funiculars still exist and operate in the same way. The car at the top of the hill is loaded with water until it is heavier than the car at the bottom, causing it to descend the hill and pull up the other car. The water is drained at the bottom, and the process repeats with the cars exchanging roles. The movement is controlled by a brakeman using the brake handle of the rack and pinion system engaged with the rack mounted between the rails.

The Bom Jesus funicular built in 1882 near Braga, Portugal is one of the extant systems of this type. Another example, the Fribourg funicular in Fribourg, Switzerland built in 1899, is of particular interest as it utilizes waste water, coming from a sewage plant at the upper part of the city.

Some funiculars of this type were later converted to electrical power. For example, the Giessbachbahn in the Swiss canton of Bern, opened in 1879, was originally powered by water ballast. In 1912 its energy provision was replaced by a hydraulic engine powered by a Pelton turbine. In 1948 this in turn was replaced by an electric motor.
===Track layout===

There are three main rail layouts used on funiculars; depending on the system, the track bed can consist of four, three, or two rails.

* Early funiculars were built to the four-rail layout, with two separate parallel tracks and separate station platforms at both ends for each vehicle. The two tracks are laid with sufficient space between them for the two carriages to pass at the midpoint. While this layout requires the most land area, it is also the only layout that allows both tracks to be perfectly straight, requiring no sheaves on the tracks to keep the cable in place. Examples of four-rail funiculars are the Duquesne Incline in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and most cliff railways in the United Kingdom.
* In three-rail layouts, the middle rail is shared by both carriages, while each car runs on a different outer rail. To allow the two cars to pass at the halfway point, the middle rail must briefly split into two, forming a passing loop. Such systems are narrower and require less rail to construct than four-rail systems; however, they still require separate station platforms for each vehicle.
* In a two-rail layout, both cars share the entire track except at the passing loop in the middle. This layout is the narrowest of all and needs only a single platform at each station (though sometimes two platforms are built: one for boarding, one for alighting). However, the required passing loop is more complex and costly to build, since special turnout systems must be in place to ensure that each car always enters the correct track at the loop. Furthermore, if a rack for braking is used, that rack can be mounted higher in three-rail and four-rail layouts, making it less sensitive to choking in snowy conditions compared to the two-rail layout.

Some funicular systems use a mix of different track layouts. An example of this arrangement is the lower half of the Great Orme Tramway, where the section &quot;above&quot; the passing loop has a three-rail layout (with each pair of adjacent rails having its own conduit which the cable runs through), while the section &quot;below&quot; the passing loop has a two-rail layout (with a single conduit shared by both cars). Another example is the Peak Tram in Hong Kong, which is mostly of a two-rail layout except for a short three-rail section immediately uphill of the passing loop.

Some four-rail funiculars have their tracks interlaced above and below the passing loop; this allows the system to be nearly as narrow as a two-rail system, with a single platform at each station, while also eliminating the need for the costly junctions either side of the passing loop. The Hill Train at the Legoland Windsor Resort is an example of this configuration.

====Turnout systems for two-rail funiculars====

In the case of two-rail funiculars, various solutions exist for ensuring that a carriage always enters the same track at the passing loop.

One such solution involves installing switches at each end of the passing loop. These switches are moved into their desired position by the carriage&#x27;s wheels during trailing movements (i.e. away from the passing loop); this procedure also sets the route for the next trip in the opposite direction. The Great Orme Tramway is an example of a funicular that utilizes this system.


Another turnout system, known as the Abt switch, involves no moving parts on the track at all. Instead, the carriages are built with an unconventional wheelset design: the outboard wheels have flanges on both sides, whereas the inboard wheels are unflanged (and usually wider to allow them to roll over the turnouts more easily). The double-flanged wheels keep the carriages bound to one specific rail at all times. One car has the flanged wheels on the left-hand side, so it follows the leftmost rail, forcing it to run via the left branch of the passing loop; similarly, the other car has them on the right-hand side, meaning it follows the rightmost rail and runs on the right branch of the loop. This system was invented by Carl Roman Abt and first implemented on the Lugano Città–Stazione funicular in Switzerland in 1886; since then, the Abt turnout has gained popularity, becoming a standard for modern funiculars. The lack of moving parts on the track makes this system cost-effective and reliable compared to other systems.

===Stations===
The majority of funiculars have two stations, one at each end of the track. However, some systems have been built with additional intermediate stations. Because of the nature of a funicular system, intermediate stations are usually built symmetrically about the mid-point; this allows both cars to call simultaneously at a station. Examples of funiculars with more than two stations include the Wellington Cable Car in New Zealand (five stations, including one at the passing loop) and the Carmelit in Haifa, Israel (six stations, three on each side of the passing loop).

A few funiculars with asymmetrically placed stations also exist. For example, the Petřín funicular in Prague has three stations: one at each end, and a third (Nebozízek) a short way up from the passing loop. Because of this arrangement, carriages are forced to make a technical stop a short distance down from the passing loop as well, for the sole purpose of allowing the other car to call at Nebozízek.
==History==
A number of cable railway systems which pull their cars on inclined slopes were built since the 1820s. 
In the second half of the 19th century the design of a funicular as a transit system emerged. 
It was especially attractive in comparison with the other systems of the time as counterbalancing of the cars was deemed to be a cost-cutting solution.

The first line of the Funiculars of Lyon () opened in 1862, followed by other lines in 1878, 1891 and 1900. The Budapest Castle Hill Funicular was built in 1868–69, with the first test run on 23 October 1869. 
The oldest funicular railway operating in Britain dates from 1875 and is in Scarborough, North Yorkshire.
In Istanbul, Turkey, the Tünel has been in continuous operation since 1875 and is both the first underground funicular and the second-oldest underground railway. 
It remained powered by a steam engine up until it was taken for renovation in 1968.

Until the end of the 1870s, the four-rail parallel-track funicular was the normal configuration. Carl Roman Abt developed the Abt Switch allowing the two-rail layout, which was used for the first time in 1879 when the Giessbach Funicular opened in Switzerland.

In the United States, the first funicular to use a two-rail layout was the Telegraph Hill Railroad in San Francisco, which was in operation from 1884 until 1886. The Mount Lowe Railway in Altadena, California, was the first mountain railway in the United States to use the three-rail layout. Three- and two-rail layouts considerably reduced the space required for building a funicular, reducing grading costs on mountain slopes and property costs for urban funiculars. These layouts enabled a funicular boom in the latter half of the 19th century.

Currently, the United States&#x27; oldest and steepest funicular in continuous use is the Monongahela Incline located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Construction began in 1869 and officially opened 28 May 1870 for passenger use. The Monongahela incline also has the distinction of being the first funicular in the United States for strictly passenger use and not freight.

In 1880 the funicular of Mount Vesuvius inspired the Italian popular song &quot;Funiculì, Funiculà&quot;. This funicular was destroyed repeatedly by volcanic eruptions and abandoned after the eruption of 1944.

== Exceptional examples ==
According to the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;, the smallest public funicular in the world is the Fisherman&#x27;s Walk Cliff Railway in Bournemouth, England, which is long.

Stoosbahn in Switzerland, with a maximum slope of 110% (47.7°), is the steepest funicular in the world.

The Lynton and Lynmouth Cliff Railway, built in 1888, is the steepest and longest water-powered funicular in the world. It climbs vertically on a 58% gradient.

The city of Valparaíso in Chile used to have up to 30 funicular elevators (). The oldest of them dates from 1883. 15 remain with almost half in operation, and others in various stages of restoration.

The Carmelit in Haifa, Israel, with six stations and a tunnel 1.8 km (1.1 mi) long, is claimed by the Guinness World Records as the &quot;least extensive metro&quot; in the world. Technically, it is an underground funicular.

The Dresden Suspension Railway (), which hangs from an elevated rail, is the only suspended funicular in the world.

The Fribourg funicular is the only funicular in the world powered by wastewater.

Standseilbahn Linth-Limmern, capable of moving 215 t, is said to have the highest capacity.

==Comparison with inclined elevators==

Some inclined elevators are incorrectly called funiculars. On an inclined elevator the cars operate independently rather than in interconnected pairs, and are lifted uphill.

A notable example is Paris&#x27; Montmartre Funicular. Its formal title is a relic of its original configuration, when its two cars operated as a counterbalanced, interconnected pair, always moving in opposite directions, thus meeting the definition of a funicular. However, the system has since been redesigned, and now uses two independently-operating cars that can each ascend or descend on demand, qualifying as a double inclined elevator; the term &quot;funicular&quot; in its title is retained as a historical reference.

<text>A line matrix printer is a computer printer that is a compromise between a line printer and a dot matrix printer. A line matrix printer prints page-wide lines of dots at a time, building up a line of text by printing lines of dots.

==Applications==
Line matrix printers are used for high-speed printing applications They are used to produce invoices, bank statements, product shipment and transportation documentation as well as product compliance labels.

Line matrix printers can print text, bar codes and graphics.

When implemented as impact printers, they can be the least expensive to operate per page.

==How it works==
Dot matrix printers are widely used because of their low cost per page. Dot matrix printers are divided into two main groups: serial dot matrix printers and line matrix printers.
A serial dot matrix printer has a print head that runs back and forth, or in an up and down motion, on the page and prints by impact, striking an ink-soaked cloth ribbon against the paper, much like the print mechanism on a typewriter. However, unlike a typewriter or daisy wheel printer, letters are drawn out of a dot matrix, and thus, varied fonts and arbitrary graphics can be produced. Because the printing involves mechanical pressure, these printers can create carbon copies and carbonless copies.

Both line matrix and serial dot matrix printers use pins to strike against the inked ribbon, making dots on the paper and forming the desired characters. The difference is that a line matrix printer uses a hammer bank (or print-shuttle) instead of print head. This print-shuttle has hammers instead of print wires, and these hammers are arranged in a horizontal row instead in vertical column. The hammer bank uses the same technology as the permanent magnet print head with the small difference that instead of print wires the print-shuttle has hammers.

The permanent magnetic field holds the hammer spring in stressed, ready to strike position. The driver sends electric current to hammer coil, which creates an electromagnetic field opposing the permanent magnetic field. When the two fields equalize, the energy stored in the spring is released to strike the hammer against the ribbon and print a dot on the paper.

During the printing process the print-shuttle vibrates in horizontal direction with high speed while the print hammers are fired selectively. Each hammer prints a series of dots in horizontal direction for one pass of the shuttle, then paper advances at one step and the shuttle prints the following row of dots.

<text>A page printer is a computer printer which processes and prints a whole page at a time, as opposed to printers which print one line or character at a time such as line printers and dot-matrix printers. Page printers are often all incorrectly termed “laser printers”—although virtually all laser printers are page printers, other page printing technologies also exist.

==Components==
The components of a page printer are:
*A print engine, &quot;the unit within a printer that does the actual printing.&quot; For example, in a laser printer this would consist of the laser and drum and the mechanical paper feeds.
* Memory to process input and build up the image of a page. The printer may have its own memory or may use the host computer&#x27;s memory.
* A page description language (PDL), with commands which tell the printer how to format the page. Popular PDLs are PCL (Printer Command Language) from Hewlett-Packard, PostScript from Adobe Systems and PostScript clones, and Windows’ Graphics Device Interface (GDI).
*A raster image processor (RIP), i.e. a processor which constructs the bitmap image of the page. Sometimes, this processing is done by the host computer. In other cases printers may have imbedded processors to perform this task.
*A printer driver, a program (device driver) which converts the computer&#x27;s information about the page into the actual PDL. Printer drivers may be included with the operating system, be distributed with the printer on CDs or DVDs, or be downloaded from the printer manufacturer&#x27;s home page or from independent web sites.
*A connection (interface) to the host computer. Many printers communicate by Wi-Fi. Other popular interfaces are USB and Ethernet. Many older printers also have a parallel (Centronics) interface. High-end printers often have a channel interface for direct connection to a mainframe computer.

==Page printing technologies==
There are several page printing technologies, for example:
*Laser printers, in which a laser beam draws the page image on charged drum which collects charged toner and transfers the image to paper.
*LED printers, which use light-emitting diodes instead of a laser beam, but are otherwise very similar to laser printers.
*Melted wax (“phaser”) printers, where solid ink is heated to the melting point and is applied on the print medium where it immediately solidifies.
*Dye-sublimation printers, where a solid ink (dye) is converted to a gaseous state (sublimation) and applied on the print medium, where it immediately solidifies.

==Properties==
*Resolution, 600 or 1200 dpi (dots per inch) is common in most modern page printers, often with resolution enhancement or anti-aliasing to smooth uneven lines. Higher resolutions are common. Before about 1992, the year Hewlett-Packard made the LaserJet 4, built around a Canon engine, most page printers had only 300 dpi, which made visible jagged lines and relatively poor image quality.
*Engine speed. In 1984 Canon introduced the first “small”—— laser printers which could sit on a (sturdy) desktop with a print speed of 8 pages per minute (ppm). Today, even the smallest page printers may be able to print 15–20 ppm, and the largest may print above 1000 ppm.
*Processing power. Usually larger printers have more powerful processors than small personal ones.
*Size, from personal page printers at to high-volume production printers which may not be installed by one person.
*Cost, both cost of the printer and the operating costs. Generally, the larger and more expensive printers have lower operating costs than the small and inexpensive ones.
*Paper-handling facilities for folding, stapling, etc., especially for the larger printers.
*Colour printing capability. Many printers print in black only. Colour printers usually have multiple toner cartridges, wax patrons etc. Printers using CMYK colour have four, one each for the colours cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. RGB printers have three, red, green, and blue, but may also have a &quot;true black&quot;. Some ink jet printers may have additional cartridges, for example light cyan and light magenta in addition to the others, but this is rarely found in page printers.
*Multi-function devices provide additional functions such as copying, scanning, or Fax.
*Media handling: Most page printers accept paper, transparencies, envelopes, labels etc. in formats up to A4 and letter. Some printers may also handle other media types such as larger formats and heavier paper.
*Energy consumption, noise, etc. Some page printers are too noisy to stay in the near vicinity of the users, even if page printers are quieter than the old line printers and other impact printers.

<text>A pulled rickshaw (from Japanese ) is a mode of human-powered transport by which a runner draws a two-wheeled cart which seats one or two people.

In recent times the use of human-powered rickshaws has been discouraged or outlawed in many countries due to concern for the welfare of rickshaw workers. Pulled rickshaws have been replaced mainly by cycle rickshaws and auto rickshaws.

==Overview==

Rickshaws are commonly believed to have been invented in Japan in the 1860s, at the beginning of a period of rapid technical advancement. In the 19th century, rickshaw pulling became an inexpensive, popular mode of transportation across Asia.

Peasants who migrated to large Asian cities often worked first as a rickshaw runner. It was &quot;the deadliest occupation in the East, [and] the most degrading for human beings to pursue.&quot;

The rickshaw&#x27;s popularity in Japan declined by the 1930s with the advent of automated forms of transportation, like automobiles and trains. In China, the rickshaw&#x27;s popularity began to decline in the 1920s. In Singapore, the rickshaw&#x27;s popularity increased into the 20th century. There were approximately 50,000 rickshaws in 1920 and that number doubled by 1930.

==Description==
The initial rickshaws rode on iron-shod wooden wheels and the passenger sat on hard, flat seats. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, rubber or pneumatic rubber tires, spring cushions, and backrests improved the passenger&#x27;s comfort. Other features, such as lights, were also added.

In the city of Shanghai, public rickshaws were painted yellow to differentiate from the private vehicles of the wealthy citizens, which were described as:
... always shiny, were carefully maintained, and sported &#x27;a spotless white upholstered double seat, a clean plaid for one&#x27;s lap, and a wide protective tarpaulin to protect the passenger (or passengers, since sometimes up to three people rode together) against the rain.

The rickshaws were a convenient means of travel, able to traverse winding, narrow city streets. During monsoon season, passengers might be carried out of the carriage, above the flooded streets, to the door of their arrival. They offered door-to-door travel, unlike scheduled public bus and tram service.

==Country overview==

===Africa===

====East Africa====
In the 1920s, it was used in Bagamoyo and Tanga in Tanzania, and other areas of East Africa for short distances.

====Madagascar====

Rickshaws, known as &quot;pousse-pousse&quot;, were introduced by British missionaries. The intention was to eliminate the slavery-associated palanquin. Its name pousse-pousse, meaning &quot;push-push&quot;, is reportedly gained from the need to have a second person to push the back of the rickshaw on Madagascar&#x27;s hilly roads. They are a common form of transport in a number of Malagasy cities, especially Antsirabe, but are not found in the towns or cities with very hilly roads. They are similar to Chinese rickshaws and are often brightly decorated.

====Nairobi====
Rickshaws operated in Nairobi in the beginning of the 20th century; pullers went on strike there in 1908.

====South Africa====
Durban is famous for its iconic Zulu rickshaw pullers navigating throughout the city. These colorful characters are famous for their giant, vibrant hats and costumes. They were introduced into Natal by Sir Marshall Campbell in the 1890s. There were about 2,000 registered men who pulled rickshaws in Durban in 1904. Since displaced by motorised transport, there are approximately 25 rickshaws left who mostly cater to tourists today.

===Asia===
====China====
In China, from the ancient times and until the 19th century, rich and important people, when traveling overland, were commonly transported in sedan chairs carried by bearers, rather than in wheeled vehicles. This was at least partly explained by road conditions.

It is thought that it was from China (or East Asia in general) that sedan chair (a.k.a. &quot;palanquin&quot;) designs were introduced into Western Europe in the 17th century.
 However, wheeled carts for one or two passengers, pushed (rather than pulled, like a proper rikshaw) by human servant, were attested as well.

In the 19th century, wheelbarrow is the most popular transportation for commoners. In the spring of 1873, the French merchant Menard introduced rickshaw from Japan. The original name is &quot;Jinrikisha&quot;, meaning &quot;man-power-vehicle&quot; in Japanese. Most of the rickshaws were owned by foreign investors at the beginning, but in around the 1900s, rickshaws were owned mostly by Chinese companies. The official name for rickshaw is &quot;renliche&quot;, meaning &quot;man-power-vehicle&quot; in Chinese, but it is more commonly called &quot;dongyangche&quot;, meaning &quot;east-foreign-vehicle&quot;, or &quot;huangbaoche&quot; in Shanghai, meaning &quot;yellow carriage for rent&quot;.

Rickshaw transportation was an important element in urban development in 20th century China, as a mode of transportation, source of employment and facilitation of migration for workers. According to author David Strand:
Sixty thousand men took as many as a half million fares a day in a city of slightly more than one million. Sociologist Li Jinghan estimated that one out of six males in the city between the ages of sixteen and fifty was a puller. Rickshaw men and their dependents made up almost 20 percent of Beijing&#x27;s population.

Most manual rickshaws – seen by many Maoists as a symbol of oppression of the working class – were eliminated in China after the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949.

=====Shanghai=====

Shanghai&#x27;s rickshaw industry began in 1874 with 1,000 rickshaws imported from Japan. By 1914 there were 9,718 vehicles. The pullers were a large group of the city&#x27;s working poor: 100,000 men pulled rickshaws by the early 1940s, up from 62,000 in the mid-1920s.

In contrary to coolies in Beijing, those in Shanghai mostly come from rural areas out of the city. With the destitution of their land, they poured into the city with their family. As the number of coolies rose up sharply, however, the number of rickshaw remained at 20,000 in Shanghai. Except private coolies, those for public work had to take turns, and thus their average income diminished to $9 per month. Therefore, many coolies worked in the factory and ran the rickshaw after work. However, many coolies were optimistic about life. They were satisfied about their income and dreamed of purchasing their own rickshaws and sending their kids to schools. Due to this low income, many coolies would not give customers a clear idea of standard price and thus charge higher at any chance they had. In response to this phenomenon, hotels would provide the distance to various streets and the price charged.

====Hong Kong====

Rickshaws were first imported to Hong Kong from Japan in 1880. They were a popular form of transport for many years, peaking at more than 3,000 in the 1920s. However, their popularity waned after World War II. No new licenses for rickshaws have been issued since 1975, and only a few old men—three as of 2017—still hold a license. It is reported that only one of them still offer rickshaw rides on The Peak, mainly for tourists.

====India====

Around 1880, rickshaws appeared in India, first in Simla. At the turn of the century it was introduced in Kolkata (Calcutta), India and in 1914 was a conveyance for hire.

=====Service availability=====
Though most cities offer auto rickshaw service, hand-pulled rickshaws do exist in some areas, such as Kolkata, &quot;the last bastion of human powered &quot;tana&quot; rickshaws&quot;. According to Trillin, most Kolkata rickshaws serve people &quot;just a notch above poor&quot; who tend to travel short distances. However, in a recent article by Hyrapiet and Greiner, the authors found that rickshaws also transport middle-class residents who use their services out of convenience and for short-distance trips to the local marketplace. Rickshaws are used to transport goods, shoppers, and school children. It is also used as a &quot;24-hour ambulance service.&quot; Also according to Hyrapiet and Greiner, rickshaw pullers have acted as peer-educators for the Calcutta Samaritans providing critical information on HIV/AIDS because of their access to marginalized groups within Kolkata&#x27;s red light districts.

Rickshaws are the most effective means of transportation through the flooded streets of the monsoon season. When Kolkata floods rickshaw business increases and prices rise.

The pullers live a life of poverty and many sleep under rickshaws. Rudrangshu Mukerjee, an academic, stated many people&#x27;s ambivalent feelings about riding a rickshaw: he does not like being carried about in a rickshaw but does not like the idea of &quot;taking away their livelihood&quot;.

Motor vehicles are banned in the Eco-sensitive zone area of Matheran, India, a tourist hill station near Mumbai so man-pulled rickshaws are still one of the major forms of transport there.

=====Legislation=====
In August 2005, the Communist government of West Bengal announced plans to completely ban pulled rickshaws, resulting in protests and strikes of the pullers. In 2006, the chief minister of West Bengal, Buddhadeb Bhattacharya, announced that pulled rickshaws would be banned and that rickshaw pullers would be rehabilitated.
====Indonesia====
Pulled rickshaws used to be in Indonesia a long time ago. Nowadays, they are replaced by &quot;Delman&quot; (the horse-drawn carriage) and &quot;Becak&quot; (cycle rickshaw/pedicab).
====Japan====
There are several theories about the invention of the rickshaw. Japan historian Seidensticker wrote of the theories:
Though the origins of the rickshaw are not entirely clear, they seem to be Japanese, and of Tokyo specifically. The most widely accepted theory offers the name of three inventors, and gives 1869 as the date of invention.

Starting in 1870, the Tokyo government issued a permission for Izumi Yosuke, Takayama Kosuke, and Suzuki Tokujiro to build and sell rickshaws. By 1872, they became the main mode of transportation in Japan, with about 40,000 rickshaws in service.

The rickshaw&#x27;s popularity in Japan declined by the 1930s with the advent of automated forms of transportation, like automobiles and trains. After World War II, when gasoline and automobiles were scarce, they made a temporary come-back. The rickshaw tradition has stayed alive in Kyoto and Tokyo&#x27;s geisha districts only for tourists as well as in other tourist places. The tradition completely disappeared once, but a few people revived jinrikisha (human-powered rickshaws) for tourists in the 1970s-1980s and the rickshaws became popular as a tourism resource in the 2000s. The modern rickshaw men are a kind of tourist guide, who take their clients to some tourist spots and explain about them. Many of them are part-time working students and athletes who like running or exchanging cultures.

====Malaysia====
Rickshaws were a common mode of transport in urban areas of Malaysia in the 19th and early 20th centuries until gradually replaced by cycle rickshaws.

====Pakistan====
Pulled and cycle rickshaw (&quot;qinqi&quot;) have been banned in Pakistan since April 1960. Prior to the introduction of auto rickshaws in cities, horse-drawn carriages (&quot;tongas&quot;) were a main source of public transportation.

====Philippines====
The pulled rickshaw never gained acceptance in the Philippines. Americans tried to introduce it to Manila in the early 20th century, but it was strongly opposed by local Filipinos who viewed it as an undignified mode of transport that turned humans into &quot;beasts&quot;. The main mode of public and private transportation in the Philippines from the 18th to the early 20th centuries was the &quot;kalesa&quot;, a two-wheeled horse-drawn carriage.

====Singapore====
Singapore had received its first rickshaws in 1880 and soon after they were prolific, making a &quot;noticeable change in the traffic on Singapore&#x27;s streets.&quot; Bullock carts and gharries were used prior to the introduction of rickshaws.

Many of the poorest individuals in Singapore in the late nineteenth century were poor, unskilled people of Chinese ancestry. Sometimes called coolies, the hardworking men found pulling rickshaws was a new means of employment. Rickshaw pullers experienced &quot;very poor&quot; living conditions, poverty and long hours of hard work. Income remained unchanged from 1876 to 1926, about $.60 per day.

Rickshaws popularity increased into the 20th century. There were approximately 50,000 rickshaws in 1920 and that number doubled by 1930. In or after the 1920s a union was formed, called the Rickshaw Association, to protect the welfare of rickshaw workers.

===North America===

====United States====

From &quot;A History of the Los Angeles City Market (1930-1950)&quot;, pulled rickshaws were operated in Los Angeles by high school teenagers during that time period.

====Canada====
Foot-driven rickshaws have enjoyed several decades of popularity in Halifax, Nova Scotia; in addition to providing tours of the historic Waterfront, rickshaws are also occasionally used for transportation by local residents. The city is home to the oldest rickshaw company in Canada.

Rickshaws are a popular mode of transportation in downtown Ottawa, Ontario, providing tours of historical Byward Market, in the summer. Ottawa&#x27;s rickshaws stay true to the traditional foot-driven rickshaw model, but feature modern sound-systems.

<text>Edmund Clerihew Bentley (10 July 1875 – 30 March 1956), who generally published under the names E. C. Bentley or E. Clerihew Bentley, was an English novelist and humorist, and inventor of the clerihew, an irregular form of humorous verse on biographical topics.

==Biography==
Bentley was born in London and educated at St Paul&#x27;s School and Merton College, Oxford. His father, John Edmund Bentley, was professionally a civil servant but was also a rugby union international having played in the first-ever international match for England against Scotland in 1871. Bentley worked as a journalist on several newspapers, including &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. He also worked for the weekly &quot;The Outlook&quot; during the editorship of James Louis Garvin. His first published collection of poetry, titled &quot;Biography for Beginners&quot; (1905), popularised the clerihew form; it was followed by two other collections, &quot;More Biography&quot; (1929) and &quot;Baseless Biography&quot; (1939). 

His detective novel &quot;Trent&#x27;s Last Case&quot; (1913) was much praised, numbering Dorothy L. Sayers among its admirers, and with its labyrinthine and mystifying plotting can be seen as the first truly modern mystery. It was adapted as a film in 1920, 1929, and 1952. The success of the work inspired him, after 23 years, to write a sequel, &quot;Trent&#x27;s Own Case&quot; (1936). There was also a book of Trent short stories, &quot;Trent Intervenes&quot; (1938).

From 1936 until 1949 Bentley was president of the Detection Club. He contributed to two crime stories for the club&#x27;s radio serials broadcast in 1930 and 1931, which were published in 1983 as &quot;The Scoop and Behind The Screen&quot;. In 1950 he contributed the introduction to a Constable &amp; Co omnibus edition of Damon Runyon&#x27;s &quot;Stories of the bandits of Broadway&quot;, which was republished by Penguin Books in 1990 as &quot;On Broadway&quot;.

He died in 1956 in London at the age of 80. His son Nicolas Bentley was an illustrator.

Phonographic recordings of his work &quot;Recordings for the Blind&quot; are heard in the film &quot;Places in the Heart&quot;, by the character Mr. Will.

G. K. Chesterton dedicated his popular detective novel, &quot;The Man Who Was Thursday&quot;, to Bentley, who was a school friend.

Although he is best known for his crime fiction and clerihews, Bentley also wrote at least one science fiction short story. This is the recently re-discovered &quot;Flying Visit&quot;, published in the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; on 31 March 1953.

<doc id="50687" wikidata="Q95474715" url="?curid=50687" title="Inkjet printing">
<text>Inkjet printing is a type of computer printing that recreates a digital image by propelling droplets of ink onto paper and plastic substrates. Inkjet printers were the most commonly used type of printer in 2008, and range from small inexpensive consumer models to expensive professional machines. By 2019, laser printers outsold inkjet printers by nearly a 2:1 ratio, 9.6% vs 5.1% of all computer peripherals.

The concept of inkjet printing originated in the 20th century, and the technology was first extensively developed in the early 1950s. While working at Canon in Japan, Ichiro Endo suggested the idea for a &quot;bubble jet&quot; printer, while around the same time Jon Vaught at Hewlett-Packard (HP) was developing a similar idea. In the late 1970s, inkjet printers that could reproduce digital images generated by computers were developed, mainly by Epson, HP and Canon. In the worldwide consumer market, four manufacturers account for the majority of inkjet printer sales: Canon, HP, Epson and Brother.

In 1982, Robert Howard came up with the idea to produce a small color printing system that used piezos to spit drops of ink. He formed the company, R.H. (Robert Howard) Research (named Howtek, Inc. in Feb 1984), and developed the revolutionary technology that led to the Pixelmaster color printer with solid ink using Thermojet technology. This technology consists of a tubular single nozzle acoustical wave drop generator invented originally by Steven Zoltan in 1972 with a glass nozzle and improved by the Howtek inkjet engineer in 1984 with a Tefzel molded nozzle to remove unwanted fluid frequencies.

The emerging ink jet material deposition market also uses inkjet technologies, typically printheads using piezoelectric crystals, to deposit materials directly on substrates.

The technology has been extended and the &#x27;ink&#x27; can now also comprise solder paste in PCB assembly, or living cells, for creating biosensors and for tissue engineering.

Images produced on inkjet printers are sometimes sold under trade names such as Digigraph, Iris prints, giclée, and Cromalin. Inkjet-printed fine art reproductions are commonly sold under such trade names to imply a higher-quality product and avoid association with everyday printing.

== Methods ==

Fluid surface tension naturally pulls a stream into droplets. Optimal drop sizes of require an inkjet nozzle size of about . Fluids with surface tension may be water based, wax or oil based and even melted metal alloys. Most drops can be electrically charged. There are two main technologies in use in contemporary inkjet printers: continuous (CIJ) and drop-on-demand (DOD). Continuous inkjet means the flow is pressurized and in a continuous stream. Drop-on-demand means the fluid is expelled from the jet nozzle one drop at a time. This can be done with a mechanical means with a push or some electrical method. A large electrical charge can pull drops out of a nozzle, sound waves can push fluid from a nozzle or a chamber volume expansion can expel a drop. Continuous streaming was investigated first many years ago. Drop-on-demand was only discovered in the 1920s.

=== Continuous inkjet ===
The continuous inkjet (CIJ) method is used commercially for marking and coding of products and packages. In 1867, Lord Kelvin patented the syphon recorder, which recorded telegraph signals as a continuous trace on paper using an ink jet nozzle deflected by a magnetic coil. The first commercial devices (medical strip chart recorders) were introduced in 1951 by Siemens. using the patent US2566443 invented by Rune Elmqvist dated September 4, 1951.

In CIJ technology, a high-pressure pump directs liquid ink from a reservoir through a gunbody and a microscopic nozzle (usually .003 inch diameter), creating a continuous stream of ink droplets via the Plateau-Rayleigh instability. A piezoelectric crystal may be used to create an acoustic wave as it vibrates within the gunbody and causes the stream of liquid to break into droplets at regular intervals: 64,000 to 165,000 irregular-sized ink droplets per second may be achieved. The ink droplets are subjected to an electrostatic field created by a charging electrode or by a magnetic flux field as they form; the field varies according to the degree of drop deflection desired. This results in a controlled deflection by electrostatic charge on each droplet. Charged droplets may be separated by one or more uncharged &quot;guard droplets&quot; to minimize electrostatic repulsion between neighboring droplets.

The droplets pass through another electrostatic or magnetic field and are directed (deflected) by electrostatic deflection plates or flux field to print on the receptor material (substrate), or allowed to continue on deflected to a collection gutter for re-use. The more highly charged droplets are deflected to a greater degree. Only a small fraction of the droplets is used to print, the majority being recycled.

CIJ is one of the oldest (1951) ink jet technologies in use and is fairly mature. Drop-on-demand was not invented until later. The major advantages of CIJ are the very high velocity (≈20 m/s) of the ink droplets, which allows for a relatively long distance between print head and substrate, and the very high drop ejection frequency, allowing for very high speed printing. Another advantage is freedom from nozzle clogging as the jet is always in use, therefore allowing volatile solvents such as ketones and alcohols to be employed, giving the ink the ability to &quot;bite&quot; into the substrate and dry quickly. The ink system requires active solvent regulation to counter solvent evaporation during the time of flight (time between nozzle ejection and gutter recycling), and from the venting process whereby air that is drawn into the gutter along with the unused drops is vented from the reservoir. Viscosity is monitored and a solvent (or solvent blend) is added to counteract solvent loss.

In the later 1950s, heated wax inks became popular with CIJ technologies. In 1971, Johannes F. Gottwald patent US3596285A, Liquid Metal Recorder used molten metal ink with a magnetic flux field to fabricate formed symbols for signage. This may have been the first 3D metal object printed using magnetic core memory as data to produce each symbol.

=== Drop-on-demand ===

There are many ways to produce a drop-on-demand (DOD) inkjet. Common methods include thermal DOD and piezoelectric DOD to speed up the frequency of drops. DOD may use a single nozzle or thousands of nozzles. One DOD process uses software that directs the heads to apply between zero and eight droplets of ink per dot, only where needed. Inkjet fluid materials have expanded to include pastes, epoxies, hot-melt inks, biological fluids, etc. DOD is very popular and has an interesting history. Mechanical DOD came first, followed by electrical methods including piezoelectric devices and then thermal or heat expansion methods.

; Thermal DOD printing: Most consumer inkjet printers, including those from Canon (FINE Cartridge system, see photo), Hewlett-Packard, and Lexmark, use the thermal inkjet process. The idea of using thermal excitation to move tiny drops of ink was developed independently by two groups at roughly the same time: John Vaught and a team at Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s Corvallis Division, and Canon engineer Ichiro Endo. Initially, in 1977, Endo&#x27;s team was trying to use the piezoelectric effect to move ink out of the nozzle but noticed that ink shot out of a syringe when it was accidentally heated with a soldering iron. Vaught&#x27;s work started in late 1978 with a project to develop fast, low-cost printing. The team at HP found that thin-film resistors could produce enough heat to fire an ink droplet. Two years later the HP and Canon teams found out about each other&#x27;s work.
; Thermal inkjet: In the thermal inkjet process, the print cartridges consist of a series of tiny chambers, each containing a heater, all of which are constructed by photolithography. To eject a droplet from each chamber, a pulse of current is passed through the heating element causing a rapid vaporization of the ink in the chamber and forming a bubble, which causes a large pressure increase, propelling a droplet of ink onto the paper (hence Canon&#x27;s trade name of &quot;Bubble Jet&quot;). Early thermal heads ran at just 600–700 dpi but improvements by HP increased the firing range of 8–12 kHz per chamber and as high as 18 kHz with 5-picoliter drop volume by the year 2000. Thermal printheads do not have the power of piezo DOD or continuous inkjet, so the gap between the face of the head and paper is critical. The ink&#x27;s surface tension, as well as the condensation and resultant contraction of the vapor bubble, pulls a further charge of ink into the chamber through a narrow channel attached to an ink reservoir. The inks involved are usually water-based and use either pigments or dyes as the colorant. The inks must have a volatile component to form the vapor bubble; otherwise droplet ejection cannot occur. As no special materials are required, the print head is generally cheaper to produce than in other inkjet technologies.
; Piezoelectric DOD printing: Piezos are electrically polarized ceramic devices, just as a magnet is polarized. Most commercial and industrial inkjet printers and some consumer printers (those produced by Epson (see photo) and Brother Industries) use a piezoelectric material in an ink-filled chamber behind each nozzle instead of a heating element. When a voltage is applied, the piezoelectric material changes shape, generating a pressure pulse in the fluid, which pushes a droplet of ink from the nozzle. Single nozzle tubular inkjets actually are fluid resonator chambers and the drops are expelled by sound waves in the ink chamber. The 1972 patent called them squeeze tube inkjets but later it was discovered to be acoustical inkjets. Piezoelectric (also called piezo) inkjet allows a wider variety of inks than thermal inkjet as there is no requirement for a volatile component, and no issue with kogation (buildup of ink residue), but the print heads are more expensive to manufacture due to the use of piezoelectric material (usually PZT, lead zirconium titanate). However, the ink cartridges can be separate from the head itself and individually be replaced as needed. Piezo, then has the potential for lower running costs. Piezo heads are said to achieve firing rates that are faster than thermal heads at comparable drop volumes.
; Piezo inkjet: Piezo inkjet technology is often used on production lines to mark products. For instance, the &quot;use-before&quot; date is often applied to products with this technique; in this application the head is stationary and the product moves past. This application requires a relatively large gap between the print head and the substrate, but also yields a high speed, a long service life, and low operating cost.
; Thermoplastic/3D printing: In the 1970s, the first DOD inks were water-based and higher-temperature use was not recommended. In the late 1970s, wax- and oil-based inks were used in the Silonics in 1975, Siemens PT-80i in 1977 and Epson and Exxon in 1980s DOD inkjets. In 1984, a small company, Howtek, Inc., found that solid ink materials (thermoplastics) could be jetted at by maintaining the piezo poling charge while printing. In 1986, Howtek launched the Pixelmaster solid ink-jetting printer, which opened the door to printing three-dimensional plastic inks and led to a 1992 3D patent, US5136515A. This patent was licensed by the first three major 3D printer companies (Sanders Prototype, Inc, Stratasys and 3D Systems).
; Braillemaster: In the late 1980s, Howtek introduced the Braillemaster, a printer that used four layers of solid ink per character to create documents in Braille that could be read by people who were blind.
; Howtek: Solidscape, Inc., currently uses the Howtek-style thermoplastic materials and Howtek-style single nozzle inkjets (see illustration) very successfully. Ballistic Particle Manufacturing also used the Howtek style materials and inkjets. These inkjets can produce up to 16,000 drops per second and shoot drops at 9 feet per second. Originally designed to only print on standard letter-sized paper sheets they now can print 3D models requiring hundreds of layers.
; Thermojet: The thermoplastic inks in piezoelectric inkjets (called Thermojet technology by Howtek) are sometimes confused with the thermal (heat expansion) bubble-jet technology but they are completely different. Bubble jet inks are not solid at room temp and are not heated. Thermojet inks require 125 °C to reduce fluid viscosity in jetting range. Howtek was the first to introduce an inkjet color printer using thermoplastic inks in 1984 at Comdex, Las Vegas.

== Ink formulations ==

The earliest reference to a continuous inkjet ink (CIJ) in the 1971 patent US3596285A states &quot; The preferred ink is characterized by viscosity and surface tension characteristics such that the liquid will be maintained over span under the force with which it is moving in bridge or stream. Implicit in such requirement is that the pressure applied to the ink in formation of said stream is sufficient to form a jet and to impart enough energy to carry the jet as a continuous liquid mass notwithstanding the defective forces which are or may be applied. Furthermore, the color of the ink and the color of the carrier should be such that good optical contrast is formed there between the following printing. The preferred ink is a &quot;hot-melt ink&quot;. That is to say it will assume a solid phase at the temperature of the carrier and liquid phase at some higher temperature. The range of commercially available ink compositions which could meet the requirement of the invention are not known at the present time. However, satisfactory printing according to the invention has been achieved with a conductive metal alloy as ink. It is extremely hard at room temperature and adheres well to the surface of the carrier.

The basic problem with inkjet inks is the conflicting requirements for a coloring agent that will stay on the surface versus rapid bleed through the carrier fluid.

Desktop inkjet printers, as used in offices and homes, tend to use aqueous ink based on a mixture of water, glycol and dyes or pigments. These inks are inexpensive to manufacture but difficult to control on the surface of media, often requiring specially coated media. HP inks contain sulfonated polyazo black dye (commonly used for dyeing leather), nitrates and other compounds. Aqueous inks are mainly used in printers with thermal inkjet heads, as these heads require water to perform the ink-expelling function.

While aqueous inks often provide the broadest color gamut and most vivid color, most are not waterproof without specialized coating or lamination after printing. Most dye-based inks, while usually the least expensive, are subject to rapid fading when exposed to light or ozone. Pigment-based aqueous inks are typically more costly but provide much better long-term durability and ultraviolet resistance. Inks marketed as &quot;archival quality&quot; are usually pigment-based.

Some professional wide format printers use aqueous inks, but the majority in professional use today employ a much wider range of inks, most of which require piezo inkjet heads and extensive maintenance.

; Solvent inks: The main ingredient of these inks are volatile organic compounds (VOCs), organic chemical compounds that have high vapor pressures. Color is achieved with pigments rather than dyes for excellent fade-resistance. The chief advantage of solvent inks is that they are comparatively inexpensive and enable printing on flexible, uncoated vinyl substrates, which are used to produce vehicle graphics, billboards, banners and adhesive decals. Disadvantages include the vapor produced by the solvent and the need to dispose of used solvent. Unlike most aqueous inks, prints made using solvent-based inks are generally waterproof and ultraviolet-resistant (for outdoor use) without special over-coatings. The high print speed of many solvent printers demands special drying equipment, usually a combination of heaters and blowers. The substrate is usually heated immediately before and after the print heads apply ink. Solvent inks are divided into two sub-categories: &quot;hard solvent&quot; ink offers the greatest durability without specialized over-coatings but requires specialized ventilation of the printing area to avoid exposure to hazardous fumes, while &quot;mild or &quot;eco&quot; solvent&quot; inks, while still not as safe as aqueous inks, are intended for use in enclosed spaces without specialized ventilation of the printing area. Mild solvent inks have rapidly gained popularity in recent years as their color quality and durability have increased while ink cost has dropped significantly.
; UV-curable inks: These inks consist mainly of acrylic monomers with an initiator package. After printing, the ink is cured by exposure to strong UV light. Ink is exposed to UV radiation where a chemical reaction takes place where the photo-initiators cause the ink components to cross-link into a solid. Typically a shuttered mercury-vapor lamp or UV LED is used for the curing process. Curing processes with high power for short periods of times (microseconds) allow curing inks on thermally sensitive substrates. UV inks do not evaporate, but rather cure or set as a result from this chemical reaction. No material is evaporated or removed, which means about 100% of the delivered volume is used to provide coloration. This reaction happens very quickly, which leads to instant drying that results in a completely cured graphic in a matter of seconds. This also allows for a very fast print process. As a result of this instant chemical reaction no solvents penetrate the substrate once it comes off the printer, which allows for high quality prints. The advantage of UV-curable inks is that they &quot;dry&quot; as soon as they are cured, they can be applied to a wide range of uncoated substrates, and they produce a very robust image. Disadvantages are that they are expensive, require expensive curing modules in the printer, and the cured ink has a significant volume and so gives a slight relief on the surface. Though improvements are being made in the technology, UV-curable inks, because of their volume, are somewhat susceptible to cracking if applied to a flexible substrate. As such, they are often used in large &quot;flatbed&quot; printers, which print directly to rigid substrates such as plastic, wood or aluminium where flexibility is not a concern.
; Dye sublimation inks: These inks contain special sublimation dyes and are used to print directly or indirectly on to fabrics which consist of a high percentage of polyester fibers. A heating step causes the dyes to sublimate into the fibers and create an image with strong color and good durability.
; Solid ink:These inks consist mainly of waxy compounds which are heated past their melting point to enable printing, and which harden upon hitting the cooled substrate. Hot-melt inks are typically used for masking processes and are found in graphic printing. The earliest hot-melt ink was patented in 1971 by Johannes F Gottwald, US3596285A, Liquid Metal Recorder was intended for printing. The patent states &quot;As used herein the term &quot;printing&quot; is not intended in a limited sense but includes writing or other symbol or pattern formulation with an ink. The term ink as used is intended to include not only dye or pigment-containing materials, but any flowable substance or composition suited for application to surface for forming symbols, characters or patterns of intelligence by marking. The materials employed in such process can be salvaged for reuse. Another object of the invention is to increase the size of characters...in terms of material requirements for such large and continuous displays&quot;.

== Printing heads ==
There are two main design philosophies in inkjet head design: &quot;fixed-head&quot; and &quot;disposable head&quot;. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses.

=== Fixed head ===

The &quot;fixed-head&quot; philosophy provides an inbuilt print head (often referred to as a &quot;gaiter-head&quot;) that is designed to last for the life of the printer. The idea is that because the head need not be replaced every time the ink runs out, consumable costs can be made lower and the head itself can be more precise than a cheap disposable one, typically requiring no calibration. On the other hand, if a fixed head is damaged, obtaining a replacement head can become expensive, if removing and replacing the head is even possible. If the printer&#x27;s head cannot be removed, the printer itself will then need to be replaced.

Fixed head designs are available in consumer products, but are more likely to be found on industrial high-end printers and large format printers. In the consumer space, fixed-head printers are manufactured primarily by Epson and Canon; however, many more recent Hewlett-Packard models use a fixed head, such as the Officejet Pro 8620 and HP&#x27;s Pagewide series.

=== Disposable head ===
The &quot;disposable head&quot; philosophy uses a print head which is supplied as a part of a replaceable ink cartridge. Every time a cartridge is exhausted, the entire cartridge and print head are replaced with a new one. This adds to the cost of consumables and makes it more difficult to manufacture a high-precision head at a reasonable cost, but also means that a damaged or clogged print head is only a minor problem: the user can simply buy a new cartridge. Hewlett-Packard has traditionally favored the disposable print head, as did Canon in its early models. This type of construction can also be seen as an effort by printer manufacturers to stem third party ink cartridge assembly replacements, as these would-be suppliers do not have the ability to manufacture specialized print heads.

An intermediate method does exist: a disposable ink tank connected to a disposable head, which is replaced infrequently (perhaps every tenth ink tank or so). Most high-volume Hewlett-Packard inkjet printers use this setup, with the disposable print heads used on lower volume models. A similar approach is used by Kodak, where the printhead intended for permanent use is nevertheless inexpensive and can be replaced by the user. Canon now uses (in most models) replaceable print heads which are designed to last the life of the printer, but can be replaced by the user should they become clogged.

=== Cleaning mechanisms ===
The primary cause of inkjet printing problems is ink drying on the printhead&#x27;s nozzles, causing the pigments and dyes to dry out and form a solid block of hardened mass that plugs the microscopic ink passageways. Most printers attempt to prevent this drying from occurring by covering the printhead nozzles with a rubber cap when the printer is not in use. Abrupt power losses, or unplugging the printer before it has capped the printhead, can cause the printhead to be left in an uncapped state. Even when the head is capped, this seal is not perfect, and over a period of several weeks the moisture (or other solvent) can still seep out, causing the ink to dry and harden. Once ink begins to collect and harden, the drop volume can be affected, drop trajectory can change, or the nozzle can completely fail to jet ink.

To combat this drying, nearly all inkjet printers include a mechanism to reapply moisture to the printhead. Typically there is no separate supply of pure ink-free solvent available to do this job, and so instead the ink itself is used to remoisten the printhead. The printer attempts to fire all nozzles at once, and as the ink sprays out, some of it wicks across the printhead to the dry channels and partially softens the hardened ink. After spraying, a rubber wiper blade is swept across the printhead to spread the moisture evenly across the printhead, and all jets are again fired to dislodge any ink clumps blocking the channels.

Some printers use a supplemental air-suction pump, using the rubber capping station to suck ink through a severely clogged cartridge. The suction pump mechanism is frequently driven by the page feed stepper motor: it is connected to the end of the shaft. The pump only engages when the shaft turns backwards, hence the rollers reversing while head cleaning. Due to the built-in head design, the suction pump is also needed to prime the ink channels inside a new printer, and to reprime the channels between ink tank changes.

Professional solvent- and UV-curable ink wide-format inkjet printers generally include a &quot;manual clean&quot; mode that allows the operator to manually clean the print heads and capping mechanism and to replace the wiper blades and other parts used in the automated cleaning processes. The volume of ink used in these printers often leads to &quot;overspray&quot; and therefore buildup of dried ink in many places that automated processes are not capable of cleaning.

The ink consumed in the cleaning process needs to be collected to prevent ink from leaking in the printer. The collection area is called the spittoon, and in Hewlett-Packard printers this is an open plastic tray underneath the cleaning/wiping station. In Epson printers, there is typically a large absorption pad in a pan underneath the paper feed platen. For printers that are several years old, it is common for the dried ink in the spittoon to form a pile that can stack up and touch the printheads, jamming the printer. Some larger professional printers using solvent inks may employ a replaceable plastic receptacle to contain waste ink and solvent, which must be emptied or replaced when full.

There is a second type of ink drying that most printers are unable to prevent. For ink to spray from the cartridge, air must enter to displace the removed ink. The air enters via an extremely long, thin labyrinth tube, up to long, wrapping back and forth across the ink tank. The channel is long and narrow to reduce moisture evaporation through the vent tube, but some evaporation still occurs and eventually the ink cartridge dries up from the inside out. To combat this problem, which is especially acute with professional fast-drying solvent inks, many wide-format printer cartridge designs contain the ink in an airtight, collapsible bag that requires no vent. The bag merely shrinks until the cartridge is empty.

The frequent cleaning conducted by some printers can consume quite a bit of ink and has a great impact on cost-per-page determinations.

Clogged nozzles can be detected by printing a standard test pattern on the page. Some software workaround methods are known for rerouting printing information from a clogged nozzle to a working nozzle.

=== Ink delivery developments ===

Ink cartridges have been the traditional method for delivering ink to the printhead. Continuous ink system (CISS) inkjet printers connect the printhead either to high-capacity ink tanks or packs, or replenish the built-in cartridges via external tanks connected via tubes, typically a retrofit configuration. Supertank printers–a subset of CISS printers–have high-capacity integrated ink tanks or ink packs, and are manually refilled via ink bottles. When supertank ink systems are paired with disposable printhead technology, replaceable cartridges are used to replace the exhausted print heads.

== Advantages ==
Compared to earlier consumer-oriented color printers, inkjet printers have a number of advantages. They are quieter in operation than impact dot matrix or daisywheel printers. They can print finer, smoother details through higher resolution. Consumer inkjet printers with photographic print quality are widely available.

In comparison to technologies like thermal wax, dye sublimation, and laser printing, inkjets have the advantage of practically no warm up time, and often lower cost per page. However, low-cost laser printers can have lower per-page costs, at least for black-and-white printing, and possibly for color.

For some inkjet printers, monochrome ink sets are available either from the printer manufacturer or from third-party suppliers. These allow the inkjet printer to compete with the silver-based photographic papers traditionally used in black-and-white photography, and provide the same range of tones: neutral, &quot;warm&quot; or &quot;cold&quot;. When switching between full-color and monochrome ink sets, it is necessary to flush out the old ink from the print head with a cleaning cartridge. Special software or at least a modified device driver are usually required, to deal with the different color mapping.

Some types of industrial inkjet printers are now capable of printing at very high speeds, in wide formats, or for a variety of industrial applications ranging from signage, textiles, optical media, ceramics and 3-D printing into biomedical applications and conductive circuitry. Leading companies and innovators in hardware include HP, Epson, Canon, Konica Minolta, Fujifilm, EFi, Durst, Brother, Roland DG, Mimaki, Mutoh and many others worldwide.

== Disadvantages ==

Many &quot;intelligent&quot; ink cartridges contain a microchip that communicates the estimated ink level to the printer; this may cause the printer to display an error message, or incorrectly inform the user that the ink cartridge is empty. In some cases, these messages can be ignored, but some inkjet printers will refuse to print with a cartridge that declares itself empty, to prevent consumers from refilling cartridges. For example, Epson embeds a chip which prevents printing when the chip claims the cartridge is empty, although a researcher who over-rode the system found that in one case he could print up to 38% more good quality pages, even though the chip stated that the cartridge was empty. Third-party ink suppliers sell ink cartridges at significant discounts (at least 10–30% off OEM cartridge prices, sometimes up to 95%, typically averaging around 50%), and also bulk ink and cartridge self-refill kits at even lower prices. Many vendors&#x27; &quot;intelligent&quot; ink cartridges have been reverse-engineered. It is now possible to buy inexpensive devices to reliably reset such cartridges to report themselves as full, so that they may be refilled many times.

The very narrow inkjet nozzles are prone to clogging. The ink consumed in cleaning them—either during cleaning invoked by the user, or in many cases, performed automatically by the printer on a routine schedule—can account for a significant proportion of the ink used in the machine. Inkjet printing head nozzles can be cleaned using specialized solvents, or by soaking in warm distilled water for short periods of time (for water-soluble inks.)

The high cost of OEM ink cartridges and the intentional obstacles to refilling them have been addressed by the growth of third-party ink suppliers. Many printer manufacturers discourage customers from using third-party inks, stating that they can damage the print heads due to not being the same formulation as the OEM inks, cause leaks, and produce inferior-quality output (e.g., of incorrect color gamut). &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; has noted that some third-party cartridges may contain less ink than OEM cartridges, and thus yield no cost savings, while Wilhelm Imaging Research claims that with third-party inks the lifetime of prints may be considerably reduced. However, an April 2007 review showed that, in a double-blind test, reviewers generally &quot;preferred&quot; the output produced using third-party ink over OEM ink. In general, OEM inks have undergone significant system reliability testing with the cartridge and print-head materials, whereas R&amp;D efforts on third-party ink material compatibility are likely to be significantly less. Some inkjet manufacturers have tried to prevent cartridges being refilled using various schemes including fitting chips to the cartridges that log how much the cartridge has printed and prevent the operation of a refilled cartridge.

The warranty on a printer may not apply if the printer is damaged by the use of non-approved supplies. In the US the Magnuson–Moss Warranty Act is a federal law which states that warrantors cannot require that only brand name parts and supplies be used with their products, as some printer manufacturers imply. However, this would not apply if non-approved items cause damage.

== Durability ==
Inkjet documents can have poor to excellent archival durability, depending on the quality of the inks and paper used. If low-quality paper is used, it can yellow and degrade due to residual acid in the untreated pulp; in the worst case, old prints can literally crumble into small particles when handled. High-quality inkjet prints on acid-free paper can last as long as typewritten or handwritten documents on the same paper.

Because the ink used in many low-cost consumer inkjets is water-soluble, care must be taken with inkjet-printed documents to avoid even the smallest drop of moisture, which can cause severe &quot;blurring&quot; or &quot;running&quot;. In extreme cases, even sweaty fingertips during hot humid weather could cause low-quality inks to smear. Similarly, water-based highlighter markers can blur inkjet-printed documents and discolor the highlighter&#x27;s tip. The lifetime of inkjet prints produced using aqueous inks is generally shorter (although UV-resistant inks are available) than those produced with solvent-based inkjets; however, so-called &quot;archival inks&quot; have been produced for use in aqueous-based machines which offer extended life.

In addition to smearing, gradual fading of many inks can be a problem over time. Print lifetime is highly dependent on the quality and formulation of the ink. The earliest inkjet printers, intended for home and small office applications, used dye-based inks. Even the best dye-based inks are not as durable as pigment-based inks, which are now available for many inkjet printers. Many inkjet printers now utilize pigment based inks which are highly water resistant: at least the black ink is often pigment-based. Resin or silicone protected photopaper is widely available at low cost, introducing complete water and mechanical rub resistance for dye and pigment inks. The photopaper itself must be designed for pigment or for dye inks, as pigment particles are too large to be able to penetrate through dye-only photopaper protection layer.

The highest-quality inkjet prints are often called &quot;giclée&quot; prints, to distinguish them from less-durable and lower-cost prints. However, the use of the term is no guarantee of quality, and the inks and paper used must be carefully investigated before an archivist can rely on their long-term durability.

To increase the durability of inkjet printer prints, more attention is needed for the inkjet ink cartridge. One way to treat ink cartridges on an inkjet printer is to maintain the temperature of the printer itself. Excessive variation in space temperature is very bad for printer ink cartridges. The user should prevent the printer becoming too hot or too chilly as the cartridges can dry up. For lasting printer efficiency, the user should ensure the area has a regular and steady temperature level.

== Operating cost tradeoffs ==
Inkjets use solvent-based inks which have much shorter expiration dates compared to laser toner, which has an indefinite shelf life. Inkjet printers tend to clog if not used regularly, whereas laser printers are much more tolerant of intermittent use. Inkjet printers require periodical head cleaning, which consumes a considerable amount of ink, and will drive printing costs higher especially if the printer is unused for long periods.

If an inkjet head becomes clogged, third-party ink solvents/head cleaners and replacement heads are available in some cases. The cost of such items may be less expensive compared to a transfer unit for a laser printer, but the laser printer unit has a much longer lifetime between required maintenance. Many inkjet printer models now have permanently installed heads, which cannot be economically replaced if they become irreversibly clogged, resulting in scrapping of the entire printer. On the other hand, inkjet printer designs which use a disposable printhead usually cost significantly more per page than printers using permanent heads. By contrast, laser printers do not have printheads to clog or replace frequently, and usually can produce many more pages between maintenance intervals.

Inkjet printers have traditionally produced better quality output than color laser printers when printing photographic material. Both technologies have improved dramatically over time, although the highest-quality giclée prints favored by artists use what is essentially a high-quality specialized type of inkjet printer.

== Business model ==

A common business model for inkjet printers involves selling the actual printer at or below production cost, while dramatically marking up the price of the (proprietary) ink cartridges (a profit model called the &quot;razor and blades model&quot;). Most current inkjet printers attempt to enforce this product tying by anticompetitive measures such as microchips in the cartridges to hinder the use of third-party or refilled ink cartridges. The microchips monitor usage and report the ink remaining to the printer. Some manufacturers also impose &quot;expiration dates&quot;. When the chip reports that the cartridge is empty (or out of date) the printer stops printing. Even if the cartridge is refilled, the microchip will indicate to the printer that the cartridge is depleted. For many models (especially from Canon), the &#x27;empty&#x27; status can be overridden by entering a &#x27;service code&#x27; (or sometimes simply by pressing the &#x27;start&#x27; button again). For some printers, special circuit &quot;flashers&quot; are available that reset the quantity of remaining ink to the maximum.

Some manufacturers, most notably Epson and Hewlett-Packard, have been accused of indicating that a cartridge is depleted while a substantial amount of ink remains. A 2007 study found that most printers waste a significant quantity of ink when they declare a cartridge to be empty. Single-ink cartridges were found to have on average 20% of their ink remaining, though actual figures range from 9% to 64% of the cartridge&#x27;s total ink capacity, depending on the brand and model of printer. This problem is further compounded with the use of one-piece multi-ink cartridges, which are declared empty as soon as one color runs low. Of great annoyance to many users are those printers that will refuse to print documents requiring only black ink, just because one or more of the color ink cartridges is depleted.

In recent years, many consumers have begun to challenge the business practices of printer manufacturers, such as charging up to US$8,000 per gallon (US$2,100 per liter) for printer ink. Alternatives for consumers are cheaper copies of cartridges, produced by third parties, and the refilling of cartridges, using refill kits. Due to the large differences in price caused by OEM markups, there are many companies selling third-party ink cartridges. Most printer manufacturers discourage refilling disposable cartridges or using aftermarket copy cartridges, and say that use of incorrect inks may cause poor image quality due to differences in viscosity, which can affect the amount of ink ejected in a drop, and color consistency, and can damage the printhead. Nonetheless, the use of alternative cartridges and inks has been gaining in popularity, threatening the business model of printer manufacturers. Printer companies such as HP, Lexmark, and Epson have used patents and the DMCA to launch lawsuits against third-party vendors. An anti-trust class-action lawsuit was launched in the US against HP and office supply chain Staples, alleging that HP paid Staples $100 million to keep inexpensive third-party ink cartridges off the shelves.

In Lexmark Int&#x27;l v. Static Control Components, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ruled that circumvention of this technique does not violate the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. The European Commission also ruled this practice anticompetitive: it will disappear in newer models sold in the European Union. Patents protecting the structure of their cartridges prevent the sale of cheaper copies of the cartridges. For some printer models (notably those from Canon), the manufacturer&#x27;s own microchip can be removed and fitted to a compatible cartridge thereby avoiding the need to replicate the microchip (and risk prosecution). Other manufacturers embed their microchips deep within the cartridge in an effort to prevent this approach.

In 2007, Eastman Kodak entered the inkjet market with its own line of All-In-One printers based on a marketing model that differed from the prevailing practice of selling the printer at a loss while making large profits on replacement ink cartridges. Kodak claimed that consumers could save up to 50 percent on printing by using its lower-cost cartridges filled with the company&#x27;s proprietary pigmented colorants while avoiding the potential problems associated with off-brand inks. This strategy proved unsuccessful, and Kodak exited the consumer inkjet printer business in 2012.

A more recent development is the supertank printer, which uses an integrated continuous ink system. Supertank printers are defined by their large, permanently installed ink tanks which are filled from ink bottles. The printer itself is typically sold at a substantial premium, but ink bottles are inexpensive and contain enough ink to print thousands of pages. Supertank printers generally ship with full bottles of ink in the box, allowing up to two years of printing before the tanks needs to be refilled. Epson pioneered this technology by launching the EcoTank range, first in Indonesia in 2010, with a North American launch in 2015. The supertank concept proved commercially successful, and Canon and HP launched their own lines of supertank printers, under the names MegaTank (Canon) and Smart Tank (HP).

=== Region-coding of printers and ink cartridges ===
Many manufacturers give their printers and cartridges region codes, comparable to those of DVDs, so customers cannot import them from a cheaper region. The region code can be changed a few times by the customer or the customer-service department of the manufacturer, but then, the printer is region-locked like a RPC-2 DVD drive.

One method to bypass printer-region-coding is to store empty cartridges from the old region and refill them with ink from the new region, but, as mentioned above, many modern ink cartridges have chips and sensors to prevent refilling, which makes the process more difficult. On the Internet, there are refill instructions for different printer models available. Another method is to have ink cartridges from the old region shipped to the new region.

Some manufacturers of region-coded printers also offer region-free printers specially designed for travelers.

== Printer types ==

=== Professional models ===

In addition to the widely used small inkjet printers for home and office, there are professional inkjet printers, some for &quot;page-width&quot; format printing and many for wide format printing. &quot;Page-width format&quot; means that the print width ranges from about . &quot;Wide format&quot; means print width ranging from 24&quot; up to 15&#x27; (about 60 cm to 5m). The most common application of page-width printers is in printing high-volume business communications that do not need high-quality layout and color. Particularly with the addition of variable data technologies, the page-width printers are important in billing, tagging, and individualized catalogs and newspapers. The application of most wide format printers is in printing advertising graphics; a lower-volume application is printing of design documents by architects or engineers. But nowadays, there are inkjet printers for digital textile printing up to 64&quot; wide with good high definition image of 1440×720 dpi.

Another specialty application for inkjets is producing prepress color proofs for printing jobs created digitally. Such printers are designed to give accurate color rendition of how the final image will look (a &quot;proof&quot;) when the job is finally produced on a large volume press such as a four-color offset lithography press. An example is an Iris printer, whose output is what the French term &quot;giclée&quot; was coined for.

The largest-volume supplier is Hewlett-Packard, which supplies over 90 percent of the market for printers for printing technical drawings. The major products in their Designjet series are the Designjet 500/800, the Designjet T Printer series (including the T1100 and T610), the Designjet 1050 and the Designjet 4000/4500. They also have the HP Designjet 5500, a six-color printer that is used especially for printing graphics as well as the new Designjet Z6100 which sits at the top of the HP Designjet range and features an eight color pigment ink system.

Epson, Kodak, and Canon also manufacture wide-format printers, sold in much smaller numbers than standard printers. Epson has a group of three Japanese companies around it that predominantly use Epson piezo printheads and inks: Mimaki, Roland, and Mutoh.

Scitex Digital Printing developed high-speed, variable-data, inkjet printers for production printing, but sold its profitable assets associated with the technology to Kodak in 2005 who now market the printers as Kodak Versamark VJ1000, VT3000, and VX5000 printing systems. These roll-fed printers can print at up to 305m per minute.

Professional high-volume inkjet printers are made by a range of companies. These printers can range in price from US$35,000 to $2 million. Carriage widths on these units can range from 54&quot; to 192&quot; (about 1.4 to 5 m), and ink technologies have tended toward solvent, eco-solvent, and UV-curing with a more recent focus toward water-based (aqueous) ink sets. Major applications where these printers are used are for outdoor settings for billboards, truck sides and truck curtains, building graphics and banners, while indoor displays include point-of-sales displays, backlit displays, exhibition graphics, and museum graphics.

The major suppliers for professional high-volume, wide- and grand-format printers include: EFI, LexJet, Grapo, Inca, Durst, Océ, NUR (now part of Hewlett-Packard), Lüscher, VUTEk, Scitex Vision (now part of Hewlett-Packard), Mutoh, Mimaki, Roland DG, Seiko I Infotech, IQDEMY, Leggett and Platt, Agfa, Raster Printers, DGI and MacDermid ColorSpan (now part of Hewlett-Packard), swissqprint, SPGPrints (formerly Stork Prints), MS Printing Systems and Digital Media Warehouse.

=== SOHO multifunction inkjet photo printers ===

SOHO multifunction inkjet printers for photo printing use up to 6 different inks:
* Canon: cyan, yellow, magenta, black, pigment black, gray. 1 pl thermal.
* Epson: cyan, yellow, magenta, light cyan, light magenta, black. 1.5 pl piezo variable. Also with A3 paper printing, or FAX and duplex ADF.

=== Professional inkjet photo printers ===

Inkjet printers for professional photo printing use up to twelve different inks:

* Canon: photo magenta, photo cyan, yellow, magenta, cyan, red, photo black, matte black, grey, plus either blue, photo gray, and one chroma optimiser for black density and uniform glossiness, or light gray, dark gray and one chroma optimiser, or green, blue, and photo gray. 4 pl thermal.
* Epson (10 colors from 12): vivid magenta, yellow, cyan, orange, green, vivid light magenta, light cyan, light black, matte black or photo black, plus an irreversible choice of either light light gray or violet (V not for photo). 3.5 pl piezo variable.
* HP: magenta, yellow, red, green, blue, light magenta, light cyan, gray, light gray, matte black, photo black, and one gloss enhancer. 4 pl thermal.

They can print an image of 36 megapixels on A3 borderless photo paper with 444 ppi.

=== Compact photo printers ===

A compact photo printer is a stand-alone inkjet printer designed to produce 4×6 or 2×3 inch prints from digital cameras. It works without the use of a computer. It is also known as a portable photo printer or a snapshot printer. Compact photo printers came on the market shortly after the popularity of home photo printing took off in the early 2000s. They were designed as an alternative to developing photos or printing them on a standard inkjet photo printer.

The majority of compact photo printers can only print pictures. Given this limitation, they are not meant to replace standard inkjets. Many manufacturers advertise the cost per page of photos printed on their machines; this theoretically convinces people that they can print their own pictures just as cheaply as retail stores or through online printing services. Most compact photo printers share a similar design. They are small units, usually with large LCDs in order to allow people to browse and edit their photos, as can be done on a computer. The editing options are usually somewhat advanced, allowing the user to crop photos, remove red eye, adjust color settings as well as other functions. Compact photo printers typically feature a large number of connection options, including USB and most memory card formats.

Compact photo printers are currently manufactured by most of the leading printer manufacturers such as Epson, Canon, HP, Lexmark and Kodak. While they have increased in popularity in recent years, they still make up a relatively small share of the inkjet printer market. LG&#x27;s Pocket Photo uses Zink thermal paper which has chemistries embedded on each inkless photo paper and the image will appear with the heat.

== Other uses ==

U.S. Patent 6,319,530 describes a &quot;Method of photocopying an image onto an edible web for decorating iced baked goods&quot;. In other words, this invention enables one to inkjet print a food-grade color photograph on a birthday cake&#x27;s surface. Many bakeries now carry these types of decorations, which are printable using edible inks and dedicated inkjet printers. Edible ink printing can be done using normal home use inkjet printers like Canon Bubble Jet printers with edible ink cartridges installed, and using rice paper or frosting sheets.

Inkjet printers and similar technologies are used in the production of many microscopic items. See Microelectromechanical systems.

Inkjet printers are used to form conductive traces for circuits, and color filters in LCD and plasma displays.

Inkjet printers, especially models produced by Dimatix (now part of Fujifilm), Xennia Technology and Pixdro, are in fairly common use in many labs around the world for developing alternative deposition methods that reduce consumption of expensive, rare, or problematic materials. These printers have been used in the printing of polymer, macromolecular, quantum dot, metallic nanoparticles, and carbon nanotubes. The applications of such printing methods include organic thin-film transistors, organic light emitting diodes, organic solar cells, and sensors.

Inkjet technology is used in the emerging field of bioprinting. They are also used for the production of OLED displays.

<text>Pseudotsuga macrocarpa, commonly called the bigcone spruce or bigcone Douglas-fir, is an evergreen conifer native to the mountains of southern California. It is notable for having the largest (by far) cones in the genus &quot;Pseudotsuga&quot;, hence the name.

The tree occurs from the San Rafael Mountains in central Santa Barbara County and the Tehachapi Mountains of southwestern Kern County, south through the Transverse Ranges, to the Cuyamaca Mountains in San Diego County. The tree is shade-tolerant and prefers to grow on slopes.

==Name==
&quot;Pseudotsuga macrocarpa&quot; is a Douglas-fir. The name &quot;bigcone spruce&quot;, though confusing as it is not a spruce species, is often still used, and occurs in place names.

==Description==
&quot;Pseudotsuga macrocarpa&quot; typically grows from in height and in trunk diameter. The growth form is straight, with a conical crown from broad, and a strong and spreading root system. The bark is deeply ridged, composed of thin, woodlike plates separating heavy layers of cork; bark of trees over in diameter is from thick. The main branches are long and spreading with pendulous side shoots.

The leaves are needle-like, long, and are shed when about five years old. The female cones are from long, larger and with thicker scales than those of other douglas-firs, and with exserted tridentine bracts. The seeds are large and heavy, 10 mm long and 8 mm broad, with a short rounded wing 13 mm long; they may be bird or mammal dispersed as the wing is too small to be effective for wind dispersal. Trees start producing seeds at about 20 years of age.

The largest known individual of this species is tall, in diameter, and is estimated to be from 600 to 700 years of age.

==Distribution==
&quot;Pseudotsuga macrocarpa&quot; is restricted to the California montane chaparral and woodlands and California coastal sage and chaparral ecoregions of California. It prefers a Mediterranean climate, characterized by hot dry summers and wet, mild winters. Annual rainfall during a 30-year period on a bigcone Douglas-fir site in the San Gabriel Mountains averaged and ranged from .

Bigcone Douglas-fir occurs between . At low elevation, it occurs near streams in moist, shaded canyons and draws where aspects are mostly north and east. At elevations from , aspects include south- and east-facing slopes. At these elevations, it also grows on sloping hillsides, ridges, and benches. At higher elevations, it occurs on south and west aspects on all types of terrain. The average angle of slope on which it grows is 35 degrees, ranging from level to 90 degrees, although these extremes are uncommon.

Ranges the tree is found in, south to north, include:
*Peninsular Ranges
**Cuyamaca Mountains
**Palomar Mountains
**Santa Ana Mountains
**San Jacinto Mountains
*Transverse Ranges
**San Bernardino Mountains
**San Gabriel Mountains
**Santa Susana Mountains
**San Emigdio Mountains
**Topatopa Mountains
**Santa Ynez Mountains
**San Rafael Mountains
**Sierra Madre Mountains

==Ecology==
&quot;Pseudotsuga macrocarpa&quot;, has several features to tolerate and survive wildfire, notably the very thick bark, and the presence of numerous adventitious buds on the upper side of the branches; this enables the trees to survive even crown fires which burn off all the branchlets, the apparently dead trees becoming green again the following spring. Wildfire frequencies in the chaparral habitats in which it often grows typically range from 15 to 50 year intervals. Bigcone Douglas-fir is closely associated with canyon live oak (&quot;Quercus chrysolepis&quot;) and often establishes itself in its shade; after about 50 years, it emerges above the oak canopy.

The number of plant associates in bigcone Douglas-fir communities is usually small. 
* Common overstory associates include: bigleaf maple (&quot;Acer macrophyllum&quot;), California bay laurel (&quot;Umbellularia californica&quot;), gray pine (&quot;Pinus sabiniana&quot;), and white alder (&quot;Alnus rhombifolia&quot;). 
* Shrub associates include bigpod ceanothus (&quot;Ceanothus megacarpus&quot;), red shank (&quot;Adenostoma sparsifolium&quot;), eastwood manzanita (&quot;Arctostaphylos glandulosa&quot;), toyon (&quot;Heteromoles arbutifolia&quot;), several species of sage (&quot;Salvia&quot;), and coastal sage scrub oak (&quot;Quercus dumosa&quot;).
* Ground cover associates are usually sparse, and may include California buckwheat (&quot;Eriogonum fasciculatum&quot;), wild onion (&quot;Allium&quot; spp.), scarlet beardtongue (&quot;Penstemon ternatus&quot;), giant chain fern (&quot;Woodwardia fimbriata&quot;), and western bracken (&quot;Pteridium aquilinum&quot; var. &quot;pubescens&quot;).

===Fire ecology===

&quot;Pseudotsuga macrocarpa&quot; populations are suspected to be declining due to possibly larger and more extreme wildland fires with greater frequencies. Major wildfires within its range, since 2003, have clearly proven a reduced extent when compared to early 1930s extents derived from historical aerial photos. Although historical information has provided the opportunity to detect stand level patch changes, post-fire resprouting of older more mature trees and natural regeneration and recruitment of the species into higher canopy has yet to be adequately quantified.

One tree species in direct competition with bigcone is &quot;Calocedrus decurrens&quot;, with preliminary post-fire regeneration of this species exponentially greater than bigcone. One or two years after the Station fire in 2009 on the Angeles National Forest, there was an estimated 20:1 cedar:bigcone seedling density in fixed radius plots on Mount Wilson. It may be more appropriate to perform population stability estimates up to five years or much later (i.e. 20 yrs) after a large conflagration due to the potential for immediate and delayed post-fire sprouting and regeneration and interplant competition, as well as the well-noted strategy of seed germination in shrub understories, which is likely to escape detection by surveyors until much later in its life.

Research related to the role of mycorrhizae and its relationship to seed establishment needs evaluated in these vegetation communities due to the suspected role it has with the relationship with water, especially in water-limited systems such as those in the wildlands of southern California. In addition, an aggressive seed cone collection strategy should be drafted for this species which includes extensive collection during large cone production years such as 2013, and should include a tracking system to determine correlations to climatic conditions in order to develop a foundation from which to perform species viability assessments w/ varying future climate scenarios.

This tree is being considered for more extensive plantings in semiarid locales. Its favorable qualities include resistance to drought, fire, insects, decay, and damage from ozone, and its aggressive rooting system and tolerance to variable growing medium. The needles of older trees sometimes fade to yellow, drop, and trees appear dead only to sprout with renewed vigor within two years. The reason is unknown, although drought or insects may be possible causes.

==Uses==

===Wildlife===
Bigcone Douglas-fir stands provide habitat for black-tailed deer, black bear, and various small animals. These trees provide preferred spring habitat for black bear in the San Bernardino Mountains.

The seeds are eaten by various rodents and birds.

===Restoration species===
Bigcone Douglas-fir is used for watershed and habitat restoration. The Los Angeles County Department of Forestry has extensively planted the tree over a 50-year period for that purpose.

Some hybrids of &quot;Pseudotsuga macrocarpa&quot; (Bigcone Douglas-fir) × &quot;Pseudotsuga menziesii&quot; (Coast Douglas-fir) show promise for planting on drier restoration sites within the &quot;P. menziesii&quot;−Douglas-fir natural range. These hybrids produce wood of comparable quality to that of Douglas-fir and have the drought tolerance of bigcone Douglas-fir.

===Timber===
There is no current commercial market for bigcone Douglas-fir wood due to limited distribution and access. It is heavy, hard, and fine grained but not durable. There is less sapwood than heartwood, and the latter contains pockets of resin.

In the past, the wood was used locally for fuel and lumber.

<text>The Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) is an evergreen conifer species in the pine family, Pinaceae. It is native to western North America and is also known as Douglas-fir, Douglas spruce, Oregon pine, and Columbian pine. There are three varieties: coast Douglas-fir (&quot;P. menziesii&quot; var. &quot;menziesii&quot;), Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir (&quot;P. menziesii&quot; var. &quot;glauca&quot;) and Mexican Douglas-fir (&quot;P. menziesii&quot; var. &quot;lindleyana&quot;).

Despite its common names, it is not a true fir (genus &quot;Abies&quot;), spruce (genus &quot;Picea&quot;), or pine (genus &quot;Pinus&quot;). It is also not a hemlock; the genus name &quot;Pseudotsuga&quot; means &quot;false hemlock&quot;.

==Description==
Douglas-firs are medium-sized to extremely large evergreen trees, tall (although only coast Douglas-firs, reach heights near 100 m) and commonly reach in diameter, although trees with diameters of almost exist. The largest coast Douglas-firs regularly live over 500 years, with the oldest specimens living for over 1,300 years. Rocky Mountain Douglas-firs, found further to the east, are less long-lived, usually not exceeding 400 years in age.

There are records of former coast Douglas-firs exceeding in height, which if alive today would make it the tallest tree species on Earth. Particular historical specimens with heights exceeding 400 ft include the Lynn Valley Tree and the Nooksack Giant.

The leaves are flat, soft, linear needles long, generally resembling those of the firs, occurring singly rather than in fascicles; they completely encircle the branches, which can be useful in recognizing the species. As the trees grow taller in denser forest, they lose their lower branches, such that the foliage may start as high as off the ground. Douglas-firs in environments with more light may have branches much closer to the ground.

The bark on young trees is thin, smooth, gray, and contains numerous resin blisters. On mature trees, usually exceeding 80 years, it is very thick and corky, growing up to thick with distinctive, deep vertical fissures caused by the gradual expansion of the growing tree. Some of the mature bark is brown, while other parts are lighter colored with a cork-like texture; these develop in multiple layers. This thick bark makes the Douglas-fir one of the most fire-resistant tree native to the Pacific Northwest.

The male cones are yellowish red, long. The female cones are green when young, maturing to reddish-brown or gray, long; they are pendulous, with persistent scales, unlike those of true firs. They have distinctive long, trifid (three-pointed) bracts which protrude prominently above each scale and are said to resemble the back half of a mouse, with two feet and a tail. The seeds are long, with a longer wing.

The massive mega-genome of Douglas-fir was sequenced in 2017 by the large PineRefSeq consortium, revealing a specialized photosynthetic apparatus in the light-harvesting complex of genes.

==Taxonomy==
The common name honors David Douglas, a Scottish botanist and collector who first reported the extraordinary nature and potential of the species. The common name is misleading since it is not a true fir, i.e., not a member of the genus &quot;Abies&quot;. For this reason, the name is often written as Douglas-fir (a name also used for the genus &quot;Pseudotsuga&quot; as a whole).

The specific epithet &quot;menziesii&quot; is after Archibald Menzies, a Scottish physician and rival naturalist to David Douglas. Menzies first documented the tree on Vancouver Island in 1791. Colloquially, the species is also known simply as Doug fir or Douglas pine (although the latter common name may also refer to &quot;Pinus douglasiana&quot;). Other names for this tree have included Oregon pine, British Columbian pine, Puget Sound pine, Douglas spruce, false hemlock, red fir, or red pine (although again red pine may refer to a different tree species, &quot;Pinus resinosa&quot;, and red fir may refer to &quot;Abies magnifica&quot;).

One Coast Salish name for the tree, used in the Halkomelem language, is . In the Lushootseed language, the tree is called .

==Distribution==
&quot;Pseudotsuga menziesii&quot; var. &quot;menziesii&quot;, the coast Douglas-fir, grows in the coastal regions from west-central British Columbia southward to Central California. In Oregon and Washington, its range is continuous from the eastern edge of the Cascades west to the Pacific Coast Ranges and Pacific Ocean. In California, it is found in the Klamath and California Coast Ranges as far south as the Santa Lucia Range, with a small stand as far south as the Purisima Hills in Santa Barbara County. One of the last remaining old growth stands of conifers is in the Mattole Watershed, and is under threat of logging. In the Sierra Nevada, it ranges as far south as the Yosemite region. It occurs from sea level along the coast to elevations of or higher, and inland in some cases up to .

Another variety exists further inland, &quot;Pseudotsuga menziesii&quot; var. &quot;glauca&quot;, the Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir or interior Douglas-fir. Interior Douglas-fir intergrades with coast Douglas-fir in the Cascades of northern Washington and southern British Columbia, and from there ranges northward to central British Columbia and southeastward to the Mexican border, becoming increasingly disjunct as latitude decreases and altitude increases. Mexican Douglas-fir (&quot;P. lindleyana&quot;), which ranges as far south as Oaxaca, is often considered a variety of &quot;P. menziesii&quot;.

Fossils (wood, pollen) of &quot;Pseudotsuga&quot; are recorded from the Miocene and Pliocene of Europe (Siebengebirge, Gleiwitz, Austria).

It is also naturalised throughout Europe, Argentina and Chile (called &quot;Pino Oregón&quot;). In New Zealand it is considered to be an invasive species, called a wilding conifer, and is subject to control measures. But is also one of the most common lumber trees used in forestry alongside Radiata pine with large plantations throughout the country. The species was introduced in the 20th century for its wood.

==Ecology==

=== Preferred sites ===
Douglas-fir prefers acidic or neutral soils, such as Olympic soil. However, it exhibits considerable morphological plasticity, and on drier sites &quot;P. menziesii&quot; var. &quot;menziesii&quot; will generate deeper taproots. &quot;Pseudotsuga menziesii&quot; var. &quot;glauca&quot; exhibits even greater plasticity, occurring in stands of interior temperate rainforest in British Columbia, as well as at the edge of semi-arid sagebrush steppe throughout much of its range, where it generates even deeper taproots still.

The coast Douglas-fir variety is the dominant tree west of the Cascade Mountains in the Pacific Northwest. It occurs in nearly all forest types and competes well on most parent materials, aspects, and slopes. Adapted to a more moist, mild climate than the interior subspecies, it grows larger and faster than Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir. Associated trees include western hemlock, Sitka spruce, sugar pine, western white pine, ponderosa pine, grand fir, coast redwood, western redcedar, California incense-cedar, Lawson&#x27;s cypress, tanoak, bigleaf maple and several others. Pure stands are also common, particularly north of the Umpqua River in Oregon. It is most dominant in areas with a more frequent fire regime that suppresses less fire-resistant conifers.

=== Use by animals ===
Douglas-fir seeds are an extremely important food source for small mammals such as moles, shrews, and chipmunks, which consume an estimated 65% of each annual seed crop. The Douglas squirrel harvests and hoards great quantities of Douglas-fir cones, and also consumes mature pollen cones, the inner bark, terminal shoots, and developing young needles.

Mature or &quot;old-growth&quot; Douglas-fir forest is the primary habitat of the red tree vole (&quot;Arborimus longicaudus&quot;) and the spotted owl (&quot;Strix occidentalis&quot;). Home range requirements for breeding pairs of spotted owls are at least of old growth. Red tree voles may also be found in immature forests if Douglas-fir is a significant component. The red vole nests almost exclusively in the foliage of the trees, typically above the ground, and its diet consists chiefly of Douglas-fir needles.

Douglas-fir needles are generally poor browse for ungulates, although in the winter when other food sources are lacking it can become important, and black-tailed deer browse new seedlings and saplings in spring and summer. The spring diet of the blue grouse features Douglas-fir needles prominently.

The leaves are also used by the woolly conifer aphid &quot;Adelges cooleyi&quot;; this 0.5 mm-long sap-sucking insect is conspicuous on the undersides of the leaves by the small white &quot;fluff spots&quot; of protective wax that it produces. It is often present in large numbers, and can cause the foliage to turn yellowish from the damage it causes. Exceptionally, trees may be partially defoliated by it, but the damage is rarely this severe. Among Lepidoptera, apart from some that feed on &quot;Pseudotsuga&quot; in general, the gelechiid moths &quot;Chionodes abella&quot; and &quot;C. periculella&quot; as well as the cone scale-eating tortrix moth &quot;Cydia illutana&quot; have been recorded specifically on &quot;P. menziesii&quot;.

The inner bark is the primary winter food for the North American porcupine.

Poriol is a flavanone, a type of flavonoid, produced by &quot;P. menziesii&quot; in reaction to infection by &quot;Poria weirii&quot;.

=== Value to other plants ===
A parasitic plant which uses &quot;P. menziesii&quot; is the Douglas-fir dwarf mistletoe (&quot;Arceuthobium douglasii&quot;). Epiphytes such as crustose lichens and mosses are common sights on Douglas-firs. As it is only moderately shade tolerant, undisturbed Douglas-fir stands in humid areas will eventually give way to later successional, more shade-tolerant associates such as the western redcedar and western hemlock—though this process may take a thousand years or more. It is more shade tolerant than some associated fire-dependent species, such as western larch and ponderosa pine, and often replaces these species further inland.

=== Diseases and insects ===
Fungal diseases such as laminated root rot and shoestring root-rot can cause significant damage, and in plantation settings dominated by Douglas-fir monocultures may cause extreme damage to vast swathes of trees. Interplanting with resistant or nonhost species such as western redcedar and beaked hazelnut can reduce this risk. Other threats to Douglas-fir include red ring rot and the Douglas-fir beetle.

==Uses==
Many different Native American groups used the bark, resin, and needles to make herbal treatments for various diseases. Native Hawaiians built &quot;waʻa kaulua&quot; (double-hulled canoes) from coast Douglas-fir logs that had drifted ashore. The wood has historically been favored as firewood, especially from the coastal variety. In addition early settlers used Douglas-fir for all forms of building construction, including floors, beams, and fine carving. 

The species is extensively used in forestry management as a plantation tree for softwood timber. Douglas-fir is one of the world&#x27;s best timber-producing species and yields more timber than any other species in North America, making the forestlands of western Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia the most productive on the continent. In 2011, Douglas-fir represented 34.2% of US lumber exports, to a total of 1.053 billion board-feet. Douglas-fir timber is used for timber frame construction and timber trusses using traditional joinery, veneer, and flooring due to its strength, hardness and durability. As of 2024, the only wooden ships still currently in use by the U.S. Navy in conventional naval operations are Avenger-class minesweepers, made of Douglas-fir.

Douglas-fir sees wide use in heavy timber structures, as its wood is strong, available in a number of specifications including kiln dried and grade stamped, and can be supplied in very long lengths to 60 feet. West coast mills are sophisticated in their processing of timbers, making lead times predictable and availability reliable. Paints adhere well to Douglas-fir. Stains perform well on Douglas-fir timbers with the mild caution that the natural color of this species varies and care must be taken to ensure uniformity of color. Pitch pockets that may ooze resin can be present in timbers that have not been kiln dried. Because of the timber sizes available, stamped timber grading, and relatively short lead times, Douglas-fir sees wide use in both public and residential projects.

The species has ornamental value in large parks and gardens. It has been commonly used as a Christmas tree since the 1920s, and the trees are typically grown on plantations.

The buds have been used to flavor eau de vie, a clear, colorless fruit brandy. Douglas-fir pine leaves can be used to make pine needle tea. They possess a tangy citrus flavor and may serve in some recipes as a wild substitute for rosemary.

<text>Pseudotsuga menziesii&quot; var. &quot;glauca, or Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, is an evergreen conifer native to the interior mountainous regions of western North America, from central British Columbia and southwest Alberta in Canada southward through the United States to the far north of Mexico. The range is continuous in the northern Rocky Mountains south to eastern Washington, eastern Oregon, Idaho, western and south-central Montana and western Wyoming, but becomes discontinuous further south, confined to &quot;sky islands&quot; on the higher mountains in Utah, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico, with only very isolated small populations in eastern Nevada, westernmost Texas, and northern Mexico. It occurs from 600 m altitude in the north of the range, up to 3,000 m, rarely 3,200 m, in the south. Further west towards the Pacific coast, it is replaced by the related coast Douglas-fir (&quot;Pseudotsuga menziesii&quot; var. &quot;menziesii&quot;), and to the south, it is replaced by Mexican Douglas-fir in high mountains as far south as Oaxaca. Some botanists have grouped Mexican Douglas-fir with &quot;P. menziesii&quot; var. &quot;glauca&quot;, but genetic and morphological evidence suggest that Mexican populations should be considered a different variety (&quot;Pseudotsuga menziesii var. lindleyana&quot;).

Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir is most commonly treated as a variety (&quot;Pseudotsuga menziesii&quot; var. &quot;glauca&quot;), but has also been called a subspecies (&quot;Pseudotsuga menziesii&quot; subsp. &quot;glauca&quot;) or more rarely (mainly in the past) a distinct species (&quot;Pseudotsuga glauca&quot;). The strong ecological and genetic differentiation with intergradation limited primarily to postglacial contact zones in British Columbia supports infraspecific groupings. Some botanists have further split Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir into two varieties, but these are not widely acknowledged and have only limited support from genetic testing.

==Characteristics==

Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir is a large tree, typically reaching in height and in diameter, with exceptional specimens known to tall, and in diameter. It commonly lives more than 500 years and occasionally more than 1,200 years. The bark on young trees is thin, smooth, gray, and covered with resin blisters. On mature trees, it is moderately thick (), furrowed and corky though much less so than coast Douglas-fir.
The shoots are brown to gray-brown, smooth, though not as smooth as fir shoots, and finely pubescent with scattered short hairs. The buds are a distinctive narrow conic shape, long, with red-brown bud scales. The leaves are spirally arranged but slightly twisted at the base to be upswept above the shoot, needle-like, long, gray-green to blue-green above with a single broad stomatal patch, and with two whitish stomatal bands below.

The male (pollen) cones are long, and are typically restricted to, or more abundant on, lower branches. Pollen cones develop over 1 year and wind-dispersed pollen is released for several weeks in the spring.

The mature female seed cones are pendent, long, broad when closed, opening to broad. They are produced in spring, purple (sometimes green) at first, maturing orange-brown in the autumn 5–7 months later. The seeds are long and broad, with a wing. Both coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir produce abundant crops of seed approximately every 2–11 years. Seed is produced annually except for about 1 year in any 4-to-5-year period.

==Growth==

Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir grows more slowly than coast Douglas-fir and is also much more cold tolerant. Tolerance of different environmental conditions varies among populations of Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, especially among populations from the northern and southern Rockies. However, even nearby populations can differ in cold hardiness.

Root morphology is variable, but when unimpeded, a taproot forms within several years. &quot;Platelike&quot; root morphologies occur where growth is impeded. The most prominent lateral roots begin in the 1st or 2nd year of growth. Most roots in surface soil are &quot;long ropelike laterals of secondary and tertiary origin&quot;. Fine-root production is episodic in response to changing environmental conditions; the average lifespan of fine roots is usually between several days and several weeks.

Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir reaches reproductive maturity at 12–15 years. It has winged seeds that are dispersed primarily by wind and gravity. In western Montana clearcuts, seeds were dispersed up to uphill from their source, but seedfall between was only 7% of that found in uncut stands. Other studies determined that seedfall in clearcuts beyond from seed trees was about 3% of seedfall in uncut stands where seed trees are close together. Well-stocked stands have resulted from seedfall from sources distant, but most Douglas-fir seeds fall within of their source. Small amounts of seed are dispersed by mice, chipmunks, and squirrels. Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir seeds are disseminated about twice as far as seeds of ponderosa pine.

==Longevity==
The oldest accurately-dated Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, 1275 years old, is in New Mexico. This longevity is apparently uncommon; growing on a relatively barren lava field has protected it from fire, animals, and humans. Growth typically slows dramatically between 90 and 140 years of age.

In the dry-belt forests of central British Columbia, ages can exceed 500 years on sites normal for the region. The oldest accurately-dated growth ring available for the region is 1475; dates in the 1500s and 1600s are more common for remnant patches that have escaped logging, fire, and other disturbances.

==Pathology==
It is affected by the diseases &quot;Phaeolus schweinitzii&quot;, &quot;Armillaria&quot;, &quot;Phellinus weirii&quot;, &quot;Fomes annosus&quot;, dwarf mistletoe, Dasyscypha canker and Rhabdocline needle cast.

==Insects==
It attracts the Douglas fir beetle, western budworm and tussock moth.

==Ecology==
Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir grows on a variety of sites across its wide geographic range. It grows at lower elevations adjacent to and within bunchgrass communities and is also found in upper-elevation subalpine forests. It tends to be most abundant in low- and middle-elevation forests, where it grows over a wide range of aspects, slopes, landforms, and soils.

In spring and winter (in British Columbia, Idaho, and Montana) elk browse on south- and southwest-facing Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine stands, particularly when shrubs and/or grasses are productive. In summer, elk generally are found at higher elevations (outside the Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir and Pacific ponderosa pine zones). During fall, elk use stands of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine, subalpine fir, western larch, or grand fir with high canopy cover.

In parts of Yellowstone National Park, elk browsing is so intensive that young Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir are stunted at in height, with live branches trailing very close to the ground, and branches on the upper two thirds of the tree dead. Low-elevation and south-facing open-structure Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir types are often important winter range for white-tailed deer and mule deer. Moose winter in low-elevation Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir types in areas where willow thickets, the preferred winter habitat, are lacking; in such areas Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir is an important moose food.

Chipmunks, mice, voles, and shrews eat large quantities of conifer seeds from the forest floor, and clipped cones are a staple and major part of storage of red squirrels. These animals store a large amount of Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir cones or seeds. American marten commonly den in hollow logs.

Numerous species of songbirds extract seeds from Douglas-fir cones or forage for seeds on the ground. The most common are the Clark&#x27;s nutcracker, black-capped chickadee, mountain chickadee, boreal chickadee, red-breasted nuthatch, pygmy nuthatch, red crossbill, white-winged crossbill, dark-eyed junco, and pine siskin. Migrating flocks of dark-eyed juncos may consume vast quantities of seeds and freshly germinated seedlings. Woodpeckers commonly feed in the bark of Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir. Blue grouse forage on needles and buds in winter; they and other birds rely heavily on Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir communities for cover.

The Douglas-fir is vulnerable to infestation by a woolly aphid, &quot;Adelges cooleyi&quot; that also infects the Engelmann spruce to complete its lifecycle.

==Uses==
Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir is a valuable timber tree. The wood is exceptionally strong and is used for structural timber as well as poles, plywood, pulp, dimensional lumber, railroad ties, mine timbers, log cabins, posts and poles, fencing, and firewood. Other uses listed include &quot;machine-stress-rated lumber&quot;, glued-laminated (Glulam) beams, pallets, furniture, cabinets, doors, flooring, window frames, and other miscellaneous woodwork and millwork. Rocky Mountain Douglas-firs are also cut and sold as Christmas trees.

<text>Sir Robert Eric Mortimer Wheeler CH CIE MC TD (10 September 1890 – 22 July 1976) was a British archaeologist and officer in the British Army. Over the course of his career, he served as Director of both the National Museum of Wales and London Museum, Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India, and the founder and Honorary Director of the Institute of Archaeology in London, in addition to writing twenty-four books on archaeological subjects.

Born in Glasgow to a middle-class family, Wheeler was raised largely in Yorkshire before moving to London in his teenage years. After studying classics at University College London (UCL), he began working professionally in archaeology, specialising in the Romano-British period. During World War I he volunteered for service in the Royal Artillery, being stationed on the Western Front, where he rose to the rank of major and was awarded the Military Cross. Returning to Britain, he obtained his doctorate from UCL before taking on a position at the National Museum of Wales, first as Keeper of Archaeology and then as Director, during which time he oversaw excavation at the Roman forts of Segontium, Y Gaer, and Isca Augusta with the aid of his first wife, Tessa Wheeler. Influenced by the archaeologist Augustus Pitt Rivers, Wheeler argued that excavation and the recording of stratigraphic context required an increasingly scientific and methodical approach, developing the &quot;Wheeler method&quot;. In 1926, he was appointed Keeper of the London Museum; there, he oversaw a reorganisation of the collection, successfully lobbied for increased funding, and began lecturing at UCL.

In 1934, he established the Institute of Archaeology as part of the federal University of London, adopting the position of Honorary Director. In this period, he oversaw excavations of the Roman sites at Lydney Park and Verulamium and the Iron Age hill fort of Maiden Castle. During World War II, he re-joined the Armed Forces and rose to the rank of brigadier, serving in the North African Campaign and then the Allied invasion of Italy. In 1944 he was appointed Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India, through which he oversaw excavations of sites at Harappa, Arikamedu, and Brahmagiri, and implemented reforms to the subcontinent&#x27;s archaeological establishment. Returning to Britain in 1948, he divided his time between lecturing for the Institute of Archaeology and acting as archaeological adviser to Pakistan&#x27;s government. In later life, his popular books, cruise ship lectures, and appearances on radio and television, particularly the BBC series &quot;Animal, Vegetable, Mineral?&quot;, helped to bring archaeology to a mass audience. Appointed Honorary Secretary of the British Academy, he raised large sums of money for archaeological projects, and was appointed British representative for several UNESCO projects.

Wheeler is recognised as one of the most important British archaeologists of the 20th century, responsible for successfully encouraging British public interest in the discipline and advancing methodologies of excavation and recording. Furthermore, he is widely acclaimed as a major figure in the establishment of South Asian archaeology. However, many of his specific interpretations of archaeological sites have been discredited or reinterpreted.

==Early life==

===Childhood: 1890–1907===
Mortimer Wheeler was born on 10 September 1890 in the city of Glasgow, Scotland. He was the first child of the journalist Robert Mortimer Wheeler and his second wife Emily Wheeler ( Baynes).

The son of a tea merchant based in Bristol, in youth Robert had considered becoming a Baptist minister, but instead became a staunch freethinker while studying at the University of Edinburgh. Initially working as a lecturer in English literature, Robert turned to journalism after his first wife died in childbirth. His second wife, Emily, shared her husband&#x27;s interest in English literature, and was the niece of Thomas Spencer Baynes, a Shakespearean scholar at St. Andrews University. Their marriage was emotionally strained, a situation exacerbated by their financial insecurity. Within two years of their son&#x27;s birth, the family moved to Edinburgh, where a daughter named Amy was born.

When Wheeler was four, his father was appointed chief leader writer for the &quot;Bradford Observer&quot;. The family relocated to Saltaire, a village northwest of Bradford, a cosmopolitan city in Yorkshire, northeast England, then in the midst of the wool trade boom. Wheeler was inspired by the moors surrounding Saltaire and fascinated by the area&#x27;s archaeology. He later wrote about discovering a late prehistoric cup-marked stone, searching for lithics on Ilkley Moor, and digging into a barrow on Baildon Moor. Although in ill health, Emily Wheeler taught her two children with the help of a maid up to the age of seven or eight. Mortimer remained emotionally distant from his mother, instead being far closer to his father, whose company he favoured over that of other children.

His father had a keen interest in natural history and a love of fishing and shooting, rural pursuits in which he encouraged Mortimer to take part. Robert acquired many books for his son, particularly on the subject of art history, with Wheeler loving to both read and paint.

In 1899, Wheeler joined Bradford Grammar School shortly before his ninth birthday, where he proceeded straight to the second form. In 1902, Robert and Emily had a second daughter, whom they named Betty; Mortimer showed little interest in this younger sister. In 1905, Robert agreed to take over as head of the London office of his newspaper, by then renamed the &quot;Yorkshire Daily Observer&quot;, so the family relocated to the southeast of the city in December 1905, settling into a house named Carlton Lodge on South Croydon Road, West Dulwich. In 1908, they moved to 14 Rollescourt Avenue in nearby Herne Hill. Rather than being sent for a conventional education, when he was 15 Wheeler was instructed to educate himself by spending time in London, where he frequented the National Gallery and the Victoria and Albert Museum.

===University and early career: 1907–14===

After passing the entrance exam on his second attempt, in 1907 Wheeler was awarded a scholarship to read classical studies at University College London (UCL), commuting daily from his parental home to the university campus in Bloomsbury, central London. At UCL, he was taught by the prominent classicist A. E. Housman. During his undergraduate studies, he became editor of the &quot;Union Magazine&quot;, for which he produced a number of illustrated cartoons. Increasingly interested in art, he decided to switch from classical studies to a course at UCL&#x27;s art school, the Slade School of Fine Art; he returned to his previous subject after coming to the opinion that – in his words – he never became more than &quot;a conventionally accomplished picture maker&quot;. This interlude had adversely affected his classical studies, and he received a second class BA on graduating.

Wheeler began studying for a Master of Arts degree in classical studies, which he attained in 1912. During this period, he also gained employment as the personal secretary of the UCL Provost Gregory Foster, although he later criticised Foster for transforming the university from &quot;a college in the truly academic sense [into] a hypertrophied monstrosity as little like a college as a plesiosaurus is like a man&quot;. It was also at this time of life that he met and began a relationship with Tessa Verney, a student then studying history at UCL, when they were both serving on the committee of the University College Literary Society.

During his studies, Wheeler had developed his love of archaeology, having joined an excavation of Viroconium Cornoviorum, a Romano-British settlement in Wroxeter, in 1913. Considering a profession in the discipline, he won a studentship that had been established jointly by the University of London and the Society of Antiquaries in memory of Augustus Wollaston Franks. The prominent archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans doubled the amount of money that went with the studentship. Wheeler&#x27;s proposed project had been to analyse Romano-Rhenish pottery, and with the grant he funded a trip to the Rhineland in Germany, there studying the Roman pottery housed in local museums; his research into this subject was never published.

At this period, there were very few jobs available within British archaeology; as the later archaeologist Stuart Piggott related, &quot;the young Wheeler was looking for a professional job where the profession had yet to be created.&quot; In 1913 Wheeler secured a position as junior investigator for the English Royal Commission on Historical Monuments, who were embarking on a project to assess the state of all structures in the nation that pre-dated 1714. As part of this, he was first sent to Stebbing in Essex to assess Late Medieval buildings, although once that was accomplished he focused on studying the Romano-British remains of that county. In summer 1914, he married Tessa in a low-key, secular wedding ceremony, before they moved into Wheeler&#x27;s parental home in Herne Hill.

===First World War: 1914–18===

After the United Kingdom&#x27;s entry into World War I in 1914, Wheeler volunteered for the armed forces. Although preferring solitary to group activities, Wheeler found that he greatly enjoyed soldiering, and on 9 November 1914 was commissioned a temporary second lieutenant in the University of London Officer Training Corps, serving with its artillery unit as an instructor. It was during this period, in January 1915, that a son was born to the Wheelers, and named Michael. Michael Wheeler was their only child, something that was a social anomaly at the time, although it is unknown whether or not this was by choice. In May 1915, Wheeler transferred to the 1st Lowland Brigade of the Royal Field Artillery (Territorial Force), and was confirmed in his rank on 1 July, with a promotion to temporary lieutenant from the same date. Shortly thereafter, on 16 July, Wheeler was promoted to temporary captain. In this position he was stationed at various bases across Britain, often bringing his wife and child with him; his responsibility was as a battery commander, initially of field guns and later of howitzers.

In October 1917 Wheeler was posted to the 76th Army Field Artillery Brigade, one of the Royal Field Artillery brigades under the direct control of the General Officer Commanding, Third Army. The brigade was then stationed in Belgium, where it had been engaged in the Battle of Passchendaele against German troops along the Western Front. By now a substantive lieutenant (temporary captain), on 7 October he was appointed second-in-command of an artillery battery with the acting rank of captain, but on 21 October became commander of a battery with the acting rank of major, replacing a major who had been poisoned by mustard gas. He was part of the Left Group of artillery covering the advancing Allied infantry in the battle. Throughout, he maintained correspondences with his wife, his sister Amy, and his parents. After the Allied victory in the battle, the brigade was transferred to Italy.

Wheeler and the brigade arrived in Italy on 20 November, and proceeded through the Italian Riviera to reach Caporetto, where it had been sent to bolster the Italian troops against a German and Austro-Hungarian advance. As the Russian Republic removed itself from the war, the German Army refocused its efforts on the Western Front, so in March 1918 Wheeler&#x27;s brigade was ordered to leave Italy, getting a train from Castelfranco to Vieux Rouen in France. Back on the Western Front, the brigade was assigned to the 2nd Division, again part of Julian Byng&#x27;s Third Army, reaching a stable area of the front in April. Here, Wheeler was engaged in artillery fire for several months, before the British went on the offensive in August. On 24 August, between the ruined villages of Achiet and Sapignies, he led an expedition that captured two German field guns while under heavy fire from a castle mound; he was later awarded the Military Cross for this action:

Wheeler continued as part of the British forces pushing westward until the German surrender in November 1918, receiving a mention in dispatches on 8 November. He was not demobilised for several months, instead being stationed at Pulheim in Germany until March; during this time he wrote up his earlier research on Romano-Rhenish pottery, making use of access to local museums, before returning to London in July 1919. Reverting to his permanent rank of lieutenant on 16 September, Wheeler was finally discharged from service on 30 September 1921, retaining the rank of major.

==Career==

===National Museum of Wales: 1919–26===

On returning to London, Wheeler moved into a top-floor flat near Gordon Square with his wife and child. He returned to working for the Royal Commission, examining and cataloguing the historic structures of Essex. In doing so, he produced his first publication, an academic paper on Colchester&#x27;s Roman Balkerne Gate which was published in the &quot;Transactions of the Essex Archaeological Society&quot; in 1920. He soon followed this with two papers in the &quot;Journal of Roman Studies&quot;; the first offered a wider analysis of Roman Colchester, while the latter outlined his discovery of the vaulting for the city&#x27;s Temple of Claudius which was destroyed by Boudica&#x27;s revolt. In doing so, he developed a reputation as a Roman archaeologist in Britain. He then submitted his research on Romano-Rhenish pots to the University of London, on the basis of which he was awarded his Doctorate of Letters; thenceforth until his knighthood he styled himself as Dr Wheeler. He was unsatisfied with his job in the commission, unhappy that he was receiving less pay and a lower status than he had had in the army, so began to seek alternative employment.

He obtained a post as the Keeper of Archaeology at the National Museum of Wales, a job that also entailed becoming a lecturer in archaeology at the University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire. Taking up this position, he moved to Cardiff with his family in August 1920, although he initially disliked the city. The museum was in disarray; before the war, construction had begun on a new purpose-built building to house the collections. This had ceased during the conflict and the edifice was left abandoned during Cardiff&#x27;s post-war economic slump. Wheeler recognised that Wales was very divided regionally, with many Welsh people having little loyalty to Cardiff; thus, he made a point of touring the country, lecturing to local societies about archaeology. According to the later archaeologist Lydia C. Carr, the Wheelers&#x27; work for the cause of the museum was part of a wider &quot;cultural-nationalist movement&quot; linked to growing Welsh nationalism during this period; for instance, the Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru was founded in 1925.

Wheeler was impatient to start excavations, and in July 1921 started a six-week project to excavate at the Roman fort of Segontium; accompanied by his wife, he used up his holiday to oversee the project. A second season of excavation at the site followed in 1922. Greatly influenced by the writings of the archaeologist Augustus Pitt-Rivers, Wheeler emphasised the need for a strong, developed methodology when undertaking an archaeological excavation, believing in the need for strategic planning, or what he termed &quot;controlled discovery&quot;, with clear objectives in mind for a project. Further emphasising the importance of prompt publication of research results, he wrote full seasonal reports for &quot;Archaeologia Cambrensis&quot; before publishing a full report, &quot;Segontium and the Roman Occupation of Wales&quot;. Wheeler was keen on training new generations of archaeologists, and two of the most prominent students to excavate with him at Segontium were Victor Nash-Williams and Ian Richmond.

Over the field seasons of 1924 and 1925, Wheeler ran excavations of the Roman fort of Y Gaer near Brecon, a project aided by his wife and two archaeological students, Nowell Myres and Christopher Hawkes. During this project, he was visited by the prominent Egyptologist Sir Flinders Petrie and his wife Hilda Petrie; Wheeler greatly admired Petrie&#x27;s emphasis on strong archaeological methodologies. Wheeler published the results of his excavation in &quot;The Roman Fort Near Brecon&quot;. He then began excavations at Isca Augusta, a Roman site in Caerleon, where he focused on revealing the Roman amphitheatre. Intent on attracting press attention to both raise public awareness of archaeology and attract new sources of funding, he contacted the press and organised a sponsorship of the excavation by the middle-market newspaper the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;. In doing so, he emphasised the folkloric and legendary associations that the site had with King Arthur. In 1925, Oxford University Press published Wheeler&#x27;s first book for a general audience, &quot;Prehistoric and Roman Wales&quot;; he later expressed the opinion that it was not a good book.

In 1924, the Director of the National Museum of Wales, William Evans Hoyle, resigned amid ill health. Wheeler applied to take on the role of his replacement, providing supportive testimonials from Charles Reed Peers, Robert Bosanquet, and H. J. Fleure. Although he had no prior museum experience, he was successful in his application and was appointed director. He then employed a close friend, Cyril Fox, to take on the vacated position of Keeper of Archaeology. Wheeler&#x27;s proposed reforms included extending the institution&#x27;s reach and influence throughout Wales by building affiliations with regional museums, and focusing on fundraising to finance the completion of the new museum premises. He obtained a £21,367 donation from the wealthy shipowner William Reardon Smith and appointed Smith to be the museum&#x27;s treasurer, and also travelled to Whitehall, London, where he successfully urged the British Treasury to provide further funding for the museum. As a result, construction on the museum&#x27;s new building was able to continue, and it was officially opened by King George V in 1927.

===London Museum: 1926–33===

Upon the retirement of the Keeper of the London Museum, Harmon Oates, Wheeler was invited to fill the vacancy. He had been considering a return to London for some time and eagerly agreed, taking on the post, which was based at Lancaster House in the St James&#x27;s area, in July 1926. In Wales, many felt that Wheeler had simply taken the directorship of the National Museum to advance his own career prospects, and that he had abandoned them when a better offer came along. Wheeler himself disagreed, believing that he had left Fox at the Museum as his obvious successor, and that the reforms he had implemented would therefore continue. The position initially provided Wheeler with an annual salary of £600, which resulted in a decline in living standards for his family, who moved into a flat near Victoria Station.

Tessa&#x27;s biographer L. C. Carr later commented that together, the Wheelers &quot;professionalized the London Museum&quot;. Wheeler expressed his opinion that the museum &quot;had to be cleaned, expurgated, and catalogued; in general, turned from a junk shop into a tolerably rational institution&quot;. Focusing on reorganising the exhibits and developing a more efficient method of cataloguing the artefacts, he also wrote &quot;A Short Guide to the Collections&quot;, before using the items in the museum to write three books: &quot;London and the Vikings&quot;, &quot;London and the Saxons&quot;, and &quot;London and the Romans&quot;. Upon his arrival, the Treasury allocated the museum an annual budget of £5,000, which Wheeler deemed insufficient for its needs. In 1930, Wheeler persuaded them to increase that budget, as he highlighted increasing visitor numbers, publications, and acquisitions, as well as a rise in the number of educational projects. With this additional funding, he was able to employ more staff and increase his own annual salary to £900.

Soon after joining the museum, Wheeler was elected to the council of the Society of Antiquaries. Through the Society, he became involved in the debate as to who should finance archaeological supervision of building projects in Greater London; his argument was that the City of London Corporation should provide the funding, although in 1926 it was agreed that the Society itself would employ a director of excavation based in Lancaster House to take on the position. Also involved in the largely moribund Royal Archaeological Institute, Wheeler organised its relocation to Lancaster House. In 1927, Wheeler took on an unpaid lectureship at University College London, where he established a graduate diploma course on archaeology; one of the first to enroll was Stuart Piggott. In 1928, Wheeler curated an exhibit at UCL on &quot;Recent Work in British Archaeology&quot;, for which he attracted much press attention.

Wheeler was keen to continue archaeological fieldwork outside London, undertaking excavations every year from 1926 to 1939. After completing his excavation of the Carlaeon amphitheatre in 1928, he began fieldwork at the Roman settlement and temple in Lydney Park, Gloucestershire, having been invited to do so by the aristocratic landowner, Charles Bathurst. It was during these investigations that Wheeler personally discovered the Lydney Hoard of coinage. Wheeler and his wife jointly published their excavation report in 1932 as &quot;Report on the Excavation of the Prehistoric, Roman and Post-Roman Site in Lydney Park, Gloucestershire&quot;, which Piggott noted had &quot;set the pattern&quot; for all Wheeler&#x27;s future excavation reports.

From there, Wheeler was invited to direct a Society of Antiquaries excavation at the Roman settlement of Verulamium, which existed on land recently acquired by the Corporation of St Albans. He took on this role for four seasons from 1930 to 1933, before leaving a fifth season of excavation under the control of the archaeologist Kathleen Kenyon and the architect A. W. G. Lowther. Wheeler enjoyed the opportunity to excavate at a civilian as opposed to military site, and also liked its proximity to his home in London. He was particularly interested in searching for a pre-Roman Iron Age oppidum at the site, noting that the existence of a nearby Catuvellauni settlement was attested to in both classical texts and numismatic evidence. With Wheeler focusing his attention on potential Iron Age evidence, Tessa concentrated on excavating the inside of the city walls; Wheeler had affairs with at least three assistants during the project. After Tessa wrote two interim reports, the final excavation report was finally published in 1936 as &quot;Verulamium: A Belgic and Two Roman Cities&quot;, jointly written by Wheeler and his wife. The report resulted in the first major published criticism of Wheeler, produced by the young archaeologist Nowell Myres in a review for &quot;Antiquity&quot;; although stating that there was much to praise about the work, he critiqued Wheeler&#x27;s selective excavation, dubious dating, and guesswork. Wheeler responded with a piece in which he defended his work and launched a personal attack on both Myres and Myres&#x27;s employer, Christ Church, Oxford.

===Institute of Archaeology: 1934–39===

Wheeler had long desired to establish an academic institution devoted to archaeology that could be based in London. He hoped that it could become a centre in which to establish the professionalisation of archaeology as a discipline, with systematic training of students in methodological techniques of excavation and conservation and recognised professional standards; in his words, he hoped &quot;to convert archaeology into a discipline worthy of that name in all senses&quot;. He further described his intention that the Institute should become &quot;a laboratory: a laboratory of archaeological science&quot;.
Many archaeologists shared his hopes, and to this end Petrie had donated much of his collection of Near Eastern artefacts to Wheeler, in the hope that it would be included in such an institution.

Wheeler was later able to persuade the University of London, a federation of institutions across the capital, to support the venture, and both he and Tessa began raising funds from wealthy backers. In 1934, the Institute of Archaeology was officially opened, albeit at this point without premises or academic staff; the first students to enroll were Rachel Clay and Barbara Parker, who went on to have careers in the discipline.

While Wheeler – who was still Keeper of the London Museum – took on the role of Honorary Director of the institute, he installed the archaeologist Kathleen Kenyon as secretary of the Management Committee, describing her as &quot;a level-headed person, with useful experience&quot;. That June, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of Saint John (OStJ).

After ending his work at Verulamium, Wheeler turned his attention to the late Iron Age hill-fort of Maiden Castle near Dorchester, Dorset, where he excavated for four seasons from 1934 to 1937. Co-directed by Mortimer and Tessa Wheeler, and the Curator of Dorset County Museum (Charles Drew), the project was carried out under the joint auspices of the Society of Antiquaries and the Dorset Field Club. With around 100 assistants each season, the dig constituted the largest excavation that had been conducted in Britain up to that point, with Wheeler organising weekly meetings with the press to inform them about any discoveries. He was keen to emphasise that his workforce consisted of many young people as well as both men and women, thus presenting the image of archaeology as a modern and advanced discipline. According to later historian Adam Stout, the Maiden Castle excavation was &quot;one of the most famous British archaeological investigations of the twentieth century. It was the classic &#x27;Wheeler dig&#x27;, both in terms of scale of operations and the publicity which it generated.&quot;

Wheeler&#x27;s excavation report was published in 1943 as &quot;Maiden Castle, Dorset&quot;. The report&#x27;s publication allowed further criticism to be voiced of Wheeler&#x27;s approach and interpretations; in his review of the book, the archaeologist W. F. Grimes criticised the highly selective nature of the excavation, noting that Wheeler had not asked questions regarding the socio-economic issues of the community at Maiden Castle, aspects of past societies that had come to be of increasing interest to British archaeology. Over coming decades, as further excavations were carried out at the site and archaeologists developed a greater knowledge of Iron Age Britain, much of Wheeler&#x27;s interpretation of the site and its development was shown to be wrong, in particular by the work of the archaeologist Niall Sharples.

In 1936, Wheeler embarked on a visit to the Near East, sailing from Marseille to Port Said, where he visited the Old Kingdom tombs of Sakkara. From there he went via Sinai to Palestine, Lebanon, and Syria. During this trip, he visited various archaeological projects, but was dismayed by the quality of their excavations; in particular, he noted that the American-run excavation at Tel Megiddo was adopting standards that had been rejected in Britain twenty-five years previously. He was away for six weeks, and upon his return to Europe discovered that his wife Tessa had died of a pulmonary embolism after a minor operation on her toe. According to Tessa&#x27;s biographer, for Wheeler this discovery was &quot;the peak of mental misery, and marked the end of his ability to feel a certain kind of love&quot;. That winter, his father also died. By the summer of 1937, he had embarked on a new romance, with a young woman named Mavis de Vere Cole, widow of Horace de Vere Cole, who had first met Wheeler when visiting the Maiden Castle excavations with her then-lover, the painter Augustus John. After she eventually agreed to his repeated proposals, the two were married early in 1939 in a ceremony held at Caxton Hall, with a reception at Shelley House. They proceeded on a honeymoon to the Middle East.

After a search that had taken several years, Wheeler was able to secure premises for the Institute of Archaeology: St. John&#x27;s Lodge in Regent&#x27;s Park, central London. Left empty since its use as a hospital during the First World War, the building was owned by the Crown and was controlled by the First Commissioner of Works, William Ormsby-Gore; he was very sympathetic to archaeology, and leased the building to the Institute at a low rent. The St. John&#x27;s Lodge premises were officially opened on 29 April 1937. During his speech at the ceremony, the University of London&#x27;s Vice-Chancellor Charles Reed Peers made it clear that the building was only intended as a temporary home for the institute, which it was hoped would be able to move to Bloomsbury, the city&#x27;s academic hub. In his speech, the university&#x27;s Chancellor, Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone, compared the new institution to both the Institute of Historical Research and the Courtauld Institute of Art.

Wheeler had also become President of the Museums Association, and in a presidential address given in Belfast talked on the topic of preserving museum collections in wartime, believing that Britain&#x27;s involvement in a second European conflict was imminent. In anticipation of this event, in August 1939 he arranged for the London Museum to place many of its most important collections into safe keeping. He was also awarded an honorary doctorate from Bristol University, and at the award ceremony met the Conservative Party politician Winston Churchill, who was then engaged in writing his multi-volume &quot;A History of the English-Speaking Peoples&quot;; Churchill asked Wheeler to help him in writing about late prehistoric and early medieval Britain, to which Wheeler agreed.

After Maiden Castle, Wheeler turned his attention to France, where the archaeological investigation of Iron Age sites had lagged behind developments in Britain. There, he oversaw a series of surveys and excavations with the aid of Leslie Scott, beginning with a survey tour of Brittany in the winter of 1936–37. After this, Wheeler decided to excavate the oppidum at Camp d&#x27;Artus, near Huelgoat, Finistère. In addition to bringing many British archaeologists to work on the site, he hired six local Breton workmen to assist the project, coming to the belief that the oppidum had been erected by local Iron Age tribes to defend themselves from the Roman invasion led by Julius Caesar. Meanwhile, Scott had been placed in charge of an excavation at the smaller nearby hill fort of Kercaradec, near Quimper. In July 1939, the project focused its attention on Normandy, with excavations beginning at the Iron Age hill forts of Camp de Canada and Duclair. They were brought to an abrupt halt in September 1939 as the Second World War broke out in Europe, and the team evacuated back to Britain. Wheeler&#x27;s excavation report, co-written with Katherine Richardson, was eventually published as &quot;Hill-forts of Northern France&quot; in 1957.

===Second World War: 1939–45===

Wheeler had been expecting and openly hoping for war with Nazi Germany for a year before the outbreak of hostilities; he believed that the United Kingdom&#x27;s involvement in the conflict would remedy the shame that he thought had been brought upon the country by its signing of the Munich Agreement in September 1938. Volunteering for the armed services, on 18 July 1939 he returned to active service as a major (Special List). He was assigned to assemble the 48th Light Anti-Aircraft Battery at Enfield, where he set about recruiting volunteers, including his son Michael. As the 48th swelled in size, it was converted into the 42nd Mobile Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment in the Royal Artillery, which consisted of four batteries and was led by Wheeler – now promoted to the temporary rank of lieutenant-colonel (effective 27 January 1940) – as Commanding Officer. Given the nickname of &quot;Flash Alf&quot; by those serving under him, he was recognised by colleagues as a ruthless disciplinarian and was blamed by many for the death of one of his soldiers from influenza during training. Having been appointed secretary of the Society of Antiquaries in 1939 and then director in 1940, he travelled to London to deal with society affairs on various occasions. In 1941 Wheeler was awarded a Fellowship of the British Academy. Mavis de Vere Cole - Wheeler’s wife, had meanwhile entered into an affair with a man named Clive Entwistle, who lambasted Wheeler as &quot;that whiskered baboon&quot;. When Wheeler discovered Entwistle in bed with her, he initiated divorce proceedings that were finalised in March 1942.

In the summer of 1941, Wheeler and three of his batteries were assigned to fight against German and Italian forces in the North African Campaign. In September, they set sail from Glasgow aboard the RMS &quot;Empress of Russia&quot;; because the Mediterranean was controlled largely by enemy naval forces, they were forced to travel via the Cape of Good Hope, before taking shore leave in Durban. There, Wheeler visited the local kraals to compare them with the settlements of Iron Age Britain. The ship docked in Aden, where Wheeler and his men again took shore leave. They soon reached the British-controlled Suez, where they disembarked and were stationed on the shores of the Great Bitter Lake. There, Wheeler took a brief leave of absence to travel to Jerusalem, where he visited Petrie on his hospital deathbed. Back in Egypt, he gained permission to fly as a front gunner in a Wellington bomber on a bombing raid against Axis forces, to better understand what it was like for aircrew to be fired on by an anti-aircraft battery.

Serving with the Eighth Army, Wheeler was present in North Africa when the Axis armies pushed the Allies back to El Alamein. He was also part of the Allied counter-push, taking part in the Second Battle of El Alamein and the advance on Axis-held Tripoli. On the way he became concerned that the archaeological sites of North Africa were being threatened both by the fighting and the occupying forces. After the British secured control of Libya, Wheeler visited Tripoli and Leptis Magna, where he found that Roman remains had been damaged and vandalised by British troops; he brought about reforms to prevent this, lecturing to the troops on the importance of preserving archaeology, making many monuments out-of-bounds, and ensuring that the Royal Air Force changed its plans to construct a radar station in the midst of a Roman settlement. Aware that the British were planning to invade and occupy the Italian island of Sicily, he insisted that measures be introduced to preserve the historic and archaeological monuments on the island.

Promoted to the acting rank of brigadier on 1 May 1943, after the German surrender in North Africa, Wheeler was sent to Algiers where he was part of the staff committee planning the invasion of Italy. There, he learned that the India Office had requested that the army relieve him of his duties to permit him to be appointed Director General of Archaeology in India. Although he had never been to the country, he agreed that he would take the job on the condition that he be permitted to take part in the invasion of Italy first. As intended, Wheeler and his 12th Anti-Aircraft Brigade then took part in the invasion of Sicily and then mainland Italy, where they were ordered to use their anti-aircraft guns to protect the British 10th Corps. As the Allies advanced north through Italy, Wheeler spent time in Naples and then Capri, where he met various aristocrats who had anti-fascist sympathies.

Wheeler left Italy in November 1943 and returned to London. There, he resigned as the director of the London Museum and focused on organising the Institute of Archaeology, preparing it for its adoption of a new director, V. Gordon Childe, after the war. He also resigned as director of the Society of Antiquaries, but was appointed the group&#x27;s representative to the newly formed Council for British Archaeology. He developed a relationship with a woman named Kim Collingridge, and asked her to marry him. As she was a devout Roman Catholic, he officially converted to the religion, something which shocked many of his friends, who believed that he was being dishonest because he did not genuinely believe in the doctrines of the faith. He then set sail for Bombay aboard a transport ship, the &quot;City of Exeter&quot;, in February 1944.

===Archaeological Survey of India: 1944–48===

Wheeler arrived in Bombay in the spring of 1944. There, he was welcomed by the city&#x27;s governor, John Colville, before heading by train to Delhi and then Shimla, where the headquarters of the Archaeological Survey of India were located. Wheeler had been suggested for the job by Archibald Wavell, the Viceroy of India, who had been acting on the recommendations of the archaeologist Leonard Woolley, who had written a report lamenting the state of the archaeological establishment in the British-controlled subcontinent. Wheeler recognised this state of affairs, in a letter to a friend complaining about the lack of finances and equipment, commenting that &quot;We&#x27;re back in 1850&quot;. He initially found much to dislike in India, and in his letters to friends in Britain expressed derogatory and racist sentiments toward Indians: he stated that &quot;they feed wrongly and think wrongly and live wrongly ... I already find myself regarding them as ill-made clockwork toys rather than as human beings, and I find myself bullying them most brutally.&quot; He expelled those staff members whom he deemed too idle, and physically beat others in an attempt to motivate them.

From the beginning of his tenure, he sought to distance himself from previous Directors-General and their administrations by criticising them in print and attempting to introduce new staff who had no loyalty to his predecessors. Assigned a four-year contract, Wheeler attempted to recruit two archaeologists from Britain, Glyn Daniel and Stuart Piggott, to aid him in reforming the Archaeological Survey, although they declined the offer. He then toured the subcontinent, seeking to meet all of the Survey&#x27;s staff members. He had drawn up a prospectus containing research questions that he wanted the Survey to focus on; these included understanding the period between the Bronze Age Indus Valley civilization and the Achaemenid Empire, discerning the socio-cultural background to the Vedas, dating the Aryan invasion, and establishing a dating system for southern India before the 6th century CE. During his time in office he also achieved a 25 per cent budget increase for the Archaeological Survey, and convinced the government to agree to the construction of a National Museum of Archaeology, to be built in New Delhi.

In October 1944, he opened his six-month archaeological field school in Taxila, where he instructed various students from across India in the methodologies of the discipline. Wheeler became very fond of his students, with one of them, B. B. Lal, later commenting that &quot;behind the gruff exterior, Sir Mortimer had a very kind and sympathetic heart&quot;. Throughout his period in India, his students were some of the only individuals to whom Wheeler warmed; more widely, he was annoyed by what he saw as the idleness, incompetence and corruption of Indian society. Initially focusing on the northwest of the subcontinent, Wheeler was particularly fascinated by the Bronze Age Indus Valley Civilization. On his initial inspection of the Indus Valley sites of Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, he organised a very brief excavation which revealed fortifications around both settlements. He later led a more detailed excavation at Harappa, where he exposed further fortifications and established a stratigraphy for the settlement.

Turning his attention to southern India, Wheeler discovered remnants of a Roman amphora in a museum, and began excavations at Arikamedu, revealing a port from the 1st century CE that had traded in goods from the Roman Empire. The excavation had been plagued by severe rains and tropical heat, although it was during the excavation that World War II ended; in celebration, Wheeler gave all his workers an extra rupee for the day. It has since been alleged that while Wheeler took credit for discovering the significance of this site, it had previously been established by A. Aiyappan, the Superintendent of the Government Museum in Madras, and the French archaeologist Jouveau Dubreuil, with Wheeler intentionally ignoring their contribution. He later undertook excavations of six megalithic tombs in Brahmagiri, Mysore, which enabled him to gain a chronology for the archaeology of much of southern India.

Wheeler established a new archaeological journal, &quot;Ancient India&quot;, planning for it to be published twice a year. He had trouble securing printing paper and faced various delays; the first issue was released in January 1946, and he would release three further volumes during his stay. Wheeler married Kim Collingridge in Simla, before he and his wife took part in an Indian Cultural Mission to Iran. The Indian government had deemed Wheeler ideal to lead the group, which departed via train to Zahidan before visiting Persepolis, Tehran, Isfahan, Shiraz, Pasargadae, and Kashan. Wheeler enjoyed the trip, and was envious of Tehran&#x27;s archaeological museum and library, which was far in advance of anything then found in India. Crossing into Iraq, in Baghdad the team caught a flight back to Delhi. In 1946, he was involved in a second cultural mission, this time to Afghanistan, where he expressed a particular interest in the kingdom of ancient Bactria and visited the archaeology of Balkh.

Wheeler was present during the 1947 Partition of India into the Dominion of Pakistan and the Union of India and the accompanying ethnic violence between Hindu and Muslim communities. He was unhappy with how these events had affected the Archaeological Survey, complaining that some of his finest students and staff were now citizens of Pakistan and no longer able to work for him. He was based in New Delhi when the city was rocked by sectarian violence, and attempted to help many of his Muslim staff members escape from the Hindu-majority city unharmed. He further helped smuggle Muslim families out of the city hospital, where they had taken refuge from a violent Hindu mob. As India neared independence from the British Empire, the political situation had changed significantly; by October 1947 he was one of the last British individuals in a senior position in the country&#x27;s governing establishment, and recognised that many Indian nationalists wanted him to leave as well. For his work in India, Wheeler was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire (CIE) in the final imperial honours list issued the day before Indian independence (gazetted in the 1948 New Year Honours).

As their relationship had become increasingly strained, his wife had left and returned to Britain. Although hoping to leave his post in India several months early, he was concerned for his economic prospects, and desperately searched for a new position. Through friends in the British archaeological community, he was offered a job as the Secretary of the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales, although he was upset that this would mean a drop in his professional status and income and decided to turn it down. Instead, he agreed to take up a chair in the Archaeology of the Roman Provinces at the Institute of Archaeology. In addition, the Pakistani Minister of Education invited him to become the Archaeological Adviser to the Pakistani government; he agreed also to take up this position, on the condition that he would only spend several months in the country each year over the next three. On 1 September 1948, having exceeded the age limit, he relinquished his Territorial Army commission, ending his military service as a war-substantive lieutenant-colonel (honorary brigadier). He was awarded the Territorial Decoration (TD) in September 1956.

==Later life==

===Between Britain and Pakistan: 1948–52===

Returning to London, Wheeler moved into the Hallam Street flat where his son and daughter-in-law were living. Wheeler and the latter disliked each other, so in summer 1950 he moved out and began renting an apartment in Mount Street. A year later he moved into his wife&#x27;s house in Mallord Street, in an unsuccessful hope of reigniting their relationship.
Taking up his part-time professorship at the Institute of Archaeology, he began to lecture to students almost every day. There, he found that he developed a relationship of mutual respect with the director, Childe, despite their strong personal and professional differences. In April 1949, after the retirement of Cyril Fox, Wheeler was nominated for the Presidency of the Society of Antiquaries, but lost to James Mann; many archaeologists, including Childe and O. G. S. Crawford, resigned from the Society in protest, deeming Wheeler to have been a far more appropriate candidate for the position. Wheeler was nevertheless elected director of the Society. In 1950 he was awarded the Petrie Medal, and was knighted in the 1952 Birthday Honours, with his investiture by the Queen taking place at Buckingham Palace on 8 July. That same year he was invited to give the Norton lectures for the Archaeological Institute of America, and while in the United States was also awarded the Lucy Wharton Drexel medal at Pennsylvania. He nevertheless disliked the country, and in later life exhibited anti-Americanism.

Wheeler spent three months in the Dominion of Pakistan during early 1949, where he was engaged in organising the fledgling Pakistani Archaeological Department with the aid of former members of the Archaeological Survey and new students whom he recruited. The Minister of Education, Fazlur Rahman, was sympathetic to Wheeler&#x27;s plans, and the government agreed to establish a National Museum of Pakistan in Karachi, which opened in April 1950. Wheeler himself was appointed the first President of the Pakistani Museums Association, and found himself as a mediator in the arguments between India and Pakistan over the redistribution of archaeological and historic artefacts following the partition. He also wrote a work of archaeological propaganda for the newly formed state, &quot;Five Thousand Years of Pakistan&quot; (1950).

To instruct new Pakistani students in the methods of archaeology, in early 1950 Wheeler ran a training excavation at Mohenjo-daro; there, he was joined by the British student Leslie Alcock, who spoke both Punjabi and Urdu and who was appointed a site supervisor by Wheeler. This excavation proved to be the only one for which Wheeler would not write and publish a full excavation report. Instead, he made reference to its findings in his book &quot;The Indus Civilization&quot;, published as part of the series The Cambridge History of India. His relationship with the Pakistani government had become strained, so he declined to return to work for them for a third year.

Wheeler had been keen to return to excavation in Britain. Based on the one he had organised in India, Wheeler developed an archaeological training course, which he ran at Verulamium in the summer of 1949 to instruct British students in the methodologies of excavation. In summer 1950, he was invited by the Royal Commission on Historical Monuments to direct a trial excavation at Bindon Hill in Dorset. It was a leisurely project which he treated as a seaside holiday. He was invited by the Ancient Monuments Department of the Ministry of Works to excavate the Stanwick Iron Age Fortifications in North Riding, Yorkshire, which he proceeded to do over the summers of 1951 and 1952. Aided by many old friends and colleagues from within the British archaeological scene, he was joined by Alcock and Alcock&#x27;s wife, among others. Wheeler published his report on the site in 1954.

In 1949, Wheeler was appointed Honorary Secretary of the British Academy after Frederic G. Kenyon stepped down from the position. According to Piggott, the institution had &quot;unhappily drifted into senility without the excuse of being venerable&quot;, and Wheeler devoted much time attempting to revitalise the organisation and ensured that Charles Webster was appointed president. Together, Wheeler and Webster sought to increase the number of younger members of the academy, increasing the number of Fellows who were permitted to join and proposing that those over 75 years of age not be permitted to serve on the organisation&#x27;s council; this latter measure was highly controversial, but, though defeated in 1951, Wheeler and Webster were able to push it through in 1952. In doing so, Piggott stated, Wheeler helped rid the society of its &quot;self-perpetuating gerontocracy&quot;. To help him in these projects, Wheeler employed a personal assistant, Molly Myers, who remained with him for the rest of his life.

===Popular fame: 1952–69===

In 1956, Wheeler retired from his part-time professorship at the Institute of Archaeology. Childe was also retiring from his position of director that year, and Wheeler involved himself in the arguments surrounding who should replace him. Wheeler vocally opposed the nomination of W.F. Grimes, deeming his career undistinguished; instead, he championed Glyn Daniel as a candidate, although ultimately Grimes was selected. That year, Wheeler&#x27;s marriage broke down, and he moved from his wife&#x27;s house to a former brothel at 27 Whitcomb Street in central London. From 1954 to 1959, he served as the President of the Society of Antiquaries, and after resigning supported Ian Richmond as his replacement; however, Joan Evans was selected. From 1964 to 1966 he served as Chairman of the Ancient Monuments Board, stepping down when he concluded that he was too old for the role.
In December 1963, Wheeler underwent a prostate operation that went wrong, and was hospitalised for over a month.
In November 1967, Wheeler became a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH), and in 1968 he became a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS).

====Media fame and public archaeology====

Wheeler became famous in Britain as &quot;the embodiment of popular archaeology through the medium of television&quot;. In 1952, Wheeler was invited to be a panelist on the new BBC television series &quot;Animal, Vegetable, Mineral?&quot;. Based on the American quiz programme &quot;What in the World?&quot;, the show was hosted by Glyn Daniel and featured three experts in archaeology, anthropology, and natural history being asked to identify artefacts that had been selected from various museums. Wheeler is alleged to have prepared for the show by checking beforehand which objects had been temporarily removed from display. The show proved popular with British audiences, and would air for six more years. It brought Wheeler to public attention, resulting in a Television Personality of the Year award for him in 1954. He also appeared in an episode of &quot;Buried Treasure&quot;, an archaeology show also hosted by Daniel, in which the pair travelled to Denmark to discuss Tollund Man. In 1957, he appeared in a second episode of &quot;Buried Treasure&quot;, for which he travelled to Pakistan to discuss that nation&#x27;s archaeology, and in 1958 again appeared in an episode, this time on the site of Great Zimbabwe in Southern Rhodesia. In 1959 he presented his own three-part series on &quot;The Grandeur That Was Rome&quot;, for which he travelled to Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, Pompeii, and Leptis Magna; the show failed to secure high ratings, and was Wheeler&#x27;s last major foray into television. Meanwhile, he also made appearances on BBC radio, initially featuring on the John Irving series &quot;The Archaeologist&quot;, but later presenting his own eight-part series on Roman Britain and also appearing on the series &quot;Asian Club&quot;, which was aimed primarily at newly arrived migrants from the Indian subcontinent.

From 1954 onward, Wheeler began to devote an increasing amount of his time to encouraging greater public interest in archaeology, and it was in that year that he obtained an agent. Oxford University Press also published two of his books in 1954. The first was a book on archaeological methodologies, &quot;Archaeology from the Earth&quot;, which was translated into various languages. The second was &quot;Rome Beyond the Imperial Frontier&quot;, discussing evidence for Roman activity at sites such as Arikamedu and Segontium. In 1955 Wheeler released his episodic autobiography, &quot;Still Digging&quot;, which had sold over 70,000 copies by the end of the year. In 1959, Wheeler wrote &quot;Early India and Pakistan&quot;, which was published as part as Daniel&#x27;s &quot;Ancient Peoples and Places&quot; series for Thames and Hudson; as with many earlier books, he was criticised for rushing to conclusions.

He wrote the section entitled &quot;Ancient India&quot; for Piggott&#x27;s edited volume &quot;The Dawn of Civilisation&quot;, which was published by Thames and Hudson in 1961, before writing an introduction for Roger Wood&#x27;s photography book &quot;Roman Africa in Colour&quot;, which was also published by Thames and Hudson. He then agreed to edit a series for the publisher, known as &quot;New Aspects of Antiquity&quot;, through which they released a variety of archaeological works. The rival publisher Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson had also persuaded Wheeler to work for them, securing him to write many sections of their book &quot;Splendours of the East&quot;. They also published his 1968 book &quot;Flames Over Persepolis&quot;, in which Wheeler discussed Persepolis and the Persian Empire in the year that it was conquered by Alexander the Great.

In 1954, the tour company R.K. Swan invited Wheeler to provide lectures on the archaeology of ancient Greece aboard their Hellenic cruise line, which he did in 1955. In 1957, he then gave a guided tour of the archaeology of the Indian subcontinent for the rival tour company Fairways and Swinford. After Swans appointed him to the position of chairman of their Hellenic Cruise division, he made two fortnight tours a year, in spring and summer. In late 1969 he conducted the Swans tour to the Indian subcontinent, visiting the south and east of the republic as well as Ceylon. During this period, Wheeler had kept in contact with many of his friends and colleagues in India and Pakistan, helping to secure them work and funding where possible.

Wheeler had continued his archaeological investigations, and in 1954 led an expedition to the Somme and Pas de Calais where he sought to obtain more information on the French Iron Age to supplement that gathered in the late 1930s. Pakistan&#x27;s Ministry of Education invited Wheeler to return to their country in October 1956. Here, he undertook test excavations at Charsada to determine a chronology of the site. In 1965, he agreed to take on the position of President of the Camelot Research Committee, which had been established to promote the findings of excavations at Cadbury Castle in Somerset run by his friends Ralegh Radford and Alcock; the project ended in 1970. He also agreed to sit as Chairman of the Archaeological Committee overseeing excavations at York Minster, work which occupied him into the 1970s. Wheeler had also continued his work with museums, campaigning for greater state funding for them. While he had become a trustee of the institution in 1963, he achieved publicity for vocally criticising the British Museum as &quot;a mountainous corpse&quot;, lambasting it as being poorly managed and overcrowded with artefacts. The BBC staged a public debate with the museum director Frank Francis.

====British Academy and UNESCO====

As Honorary Secretary of the British Academy, Wheeler focused on increasing the organisation&#x27;s revenues, thus enabling it to expand its remit. He developed personal relationships with various employees at the British Treasury, and offered the academy&#x27;s services as an intermediary in dealing with the Egypt Exploration Society, the British School at Athens, the British School at Rome, the British School at Ankara, the British School in Iraq, and the British School at Jerusalem, all of which were then directly funded independently by the Treasury. Accepting this offer, the Treasury agreed to double its funding of the academy to £5,000 a year. Approaching various charitable foundations, from 1955 Wheeler also secured funding from both the Pilgrim Trust and the Nuffield Foundation, and in 1957 then secured additional funding from the Rockefeller Foundation.

With this additional money, the academy was able to organise a survey of the state of the humanities and social sciences in the United Kingdom, authoring a report that was published by Oxford University Press in 1961 as &quot;Research in the Humanities and the Social Sciences&quot;. On the basis of this report, Wheeler was able to secure a dramatic rise in funding from the British Treasury; they increased their annual grant to £25,000, and promised that this would increase to £50,000 shortly after. According to his later biographer Jacquetta Hawkes, in doing so Wheeler raised the position of the academy to that of &quot;the main source of official patronage for the humanities&quot; within the United Kingdom, while Piggott stated that he set the organisation upon its &quot;modern course&quot;.

To improve Britain&#x27;s cultural influence abroad, Wheeler had been urging the establishment of a British Institute of History and Archaeology in East Africa, touring East Africa itself in August 1955. In 1956, the academy requested £6,000 from the Treasury to fund this new institution, to which they eventually agreed in 1959. The institute was initially established in Dar es Salaam in 1961, although later relocated to Nairobi. Meanwhile, Wheeler had also been campaigning for the establishment of a British Institute of Persian Studies, a project which was supported by the British Embassy in Tehran; they hoped that it would rival the successful French Institute in the city. In 1960, the Treasury agreed, with the new institution being housed on the premises of the University of Tehran. He further campaigned for the establishment of a British Institute in Japan, although these ideas were scrapped amid the British financial crisis of 1967.

Wheeler retained an active interest in the running of these British institutions abroad; in 1967 he visited the British School in Jerusalem amid the Six-Day War between Israel and its Arab neighbours, and in January 1968 visited the Persian institute with the archaeologist Max Mallowan and Mallowan&#x27;s wife Agatha Christie, there inspecting the excavations at Siraf. In 1969 he proceeded to the Italian city of Rome to inspect the British School there. That year, he resigned as Honorary Secretary of the academy. The position became a salaried, professional one, with the numismatist Derek Allen taking on the position.

Recognising his stature within the archaeological establishment, the government appointed Wheeler as the British representative on a UNESCO project to undertake a programme of rescue archaeology in the Nile Valley ahead of the construction of the Aswan Dam, which was going to flood large areas of Egypt and Sudan. Personally securing UK funding for the project, he deemed it an issue of national and personal shame when he was unable to persuade the British government to supply additional funding for the relocation of the Abu Simbel temples. In October 1968, he took part in a UNESCO visit to Pakistan to assess the state of Mohenjo-daro, writing the project&#x27;s report on how the archaeological site could best be preserved. His involvement with UNESCO continued for the rest of his life, and in March 1973 he was invited to the organisation&#x27;s conference in Paris.

===Final years: 1970–76===

During his final years, Wheeler remained involved in various activities, for instance sitting on the advisory panel of the &quot;Antiquity&quot; journal and the Management Committee of the Royal Archaeological Institute. In March 1971, the archaeologist Barry Cunliffe and a number of his undergraduate students at the University of Southampton organised a conference on the subject of &quot;The Iron Age and its Hillforts&quot; to celebrate Wheeler&#x27;s eightieth birthday. Wheeler attended the event, whose conference proceedings were published as a festschrift for the octogenarian. In spring 1973, Wheeler returned to BBC television for two episodes of the archaeology-themed series &quot;Chronicle&quot; in which he discussed his life and career. The episodes were well received, and Wheeler became a close friend of the show&#x27;s producer, David Collison. 1974 saw Wheeler appear in a series of six BBC TV interviews with presenter and broadcaster Magnus Magnusson called “Sir Mortimer and Magnus” during which he talked anecdotally about his life and work.

In the 1970s, Wheeler became increasingly forgetful and came to rely largely on his assistant, Molly Myres, to organise his affairs. Amid increasing ill health, in September 1973 he moved full-time into Myres&#x27;s house in Leatherhead, Surrey, although he continued to use his central London flat during day-trips to the city. There, he wrote a final book, &quot;My Archaeological Mission to India and Pakistan&quot;, although much of the text was culled from his previous publications; it was published by Thames and Hudson in 1976. Following a stroke, Wheeler died at Myers&#x27; home on 22 July 1976. In memoriam, the British Academy, Royal Academy, and Royal Society flew their flags at half-mast. Wheeler&#x27;s funeral was held with full military honours at a local crematorium, while a larger memorial service was held in St James&#x27;s Church, Piccadilly in November. His will was proven on 18 October, with his estate valued at £65,842 (equivalent to £ in ).

==Personal life==

Wheeler was known as &quot;Rik&quot; among friends. He divided opinion among those who knew him, with some loving and others despising him, and during his lifetime, he was often criticised on both scholarly and moral grounds.

Archaeologist Sir Max Mallowan asserted that he &quot;was a delightful, light-hearted and amusing companion, but those close to him knew that he could be a dangerous opponent if threatened with frustration&quot;.
His s were often condemned as being insincere.

During excavations, he was known as an authoritarian leader but favoured those who he thought exhibited bravery by standing up to his authority. Hence, he has been termed &quot;a benevolent dictator&quot;. He was meticulous in his writings, and would repeatedly revise and rewrite both pieces for publication and personal letters. Throughout his life, he was a heavy smoker.

Wheeler expressed the view that he was &quot;the least political of mortals&quot;. Despite not taking a strong interest in politics, Wheeler was described by his biographer as &quot;a natural conservative&quot;; for instance, during his youth he was strongly critical of the Suffragettes and their cause of greater legal rights for women.

Nevertheless, he was &quot;usually happy to advance young women professionally&quot;, something that may have been based largely on his sexual attraction toward them. He expressed little interest in his relatives; in later life, he saw no reason to have a social relationship with people purely on the basis of family ties.

Wheeler was married three times. In May 1914, Wheeler married Tessa Verney. Tessa became an accomplished archaeologist, and they collaborated until her death in 1936. Their only child, Michael Mortimer Wheeler, was born in January 1915; he became a barrister. Following Tessa&#x27;s death, in 1939, Wheeler married Mavis de Vere Cole, widow of prankster Horace de Vere Cole. Their relationship was strained; Cole&#x27;s diaries revealed that Wheeler hit her when she annoyed him, which he was later shocked at having done.

In 1945, Mortimer Wheeler married his third wife, Margaret Collingridge. Although they became estranged in 1956, Collingridge&#x27;s Catholicism prevented divorce. Meanwhile, Wheeler was well known for his conspicuous promiscuity, favouring young women for one-night stands, many of whom were his students. He was further known for having casual sex in public places. That behaviour led to much emotional suffering among his various wives and mistresses of which he was aware.

==Reception and legacy==

Wheeler has been termed &quot;the most famous British archaeologist of the twentieth century&quot; by archaeologists Gabriel Moshenska and Tim Schadla-Hall. Highlighting his key role in encouraging interest in archaeology throughout British society, they stated that his &quot;mastery of public archaeology was founded on his keen eye for value and a showman&#x27;s willingness to package
and sell the past&quot;. This was an issue about which Wheeler felt very strongly; writing his obituary for the &quot;Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society&quot;, the English archaeologist Stuart Piggott noted that Wheeler placed &quot;great importance to the archaeologist&#x27;s obligation to the public, on whose support the prosecution of his subject ultimately depended.&quot;

Piggott believed that Wheeler&#x27;s greatest impact was as &quot;the great innovator in field techniques&quot;, comparing him in this respect to Pitt-Rivers. Piggott stated that the &quot;importance of Wheeler&#x27;s contribution to archaeological technique, enormous and far-reaching, lies in the fact that in the early 1920s he not only appreciated and understood what Pitt-Rivers had done, but saw that his work could be used as a basis for adaptation, development and improvement.&quot; L. C. Carr stated that it was for his methodological developments, oft termed &quot;the Wheeler Method&quot;, that Wheeler was best known; in this she contrasted him with those archaeologists who were best known for their associations with a specific archaeological site, such as Arthur Evans and Knossos or Leonard Woolley and Ur.

Wheeler was well known for his publications on archaeological matters; Carr stated that both Wheeler and his first wife emphasised &quot;technical rigour and a full presentation of materials unearthed, as well as a literary discussion of their meaning calculated to appeal to a larger audience.&quot; Focusing on Wheeler&#x27;s publications regarding South Asian archaeology, Sudeshna Guha noted that he &quot;produced an assemblage of image-objects that embodied the precision he demanded from excavation photography.&quot;
Mallowan noted that &quot;Immediate and swift presentation of results was more important to him than profound scholarship, although his critical sense made him conscious that it was necessary to maintain high standards and he would approve of nothing that was slipshod.&quot; Jacquetta Hawkes commented that he made errors in his interpretation of the archaeological evidence because he was &quot;sometimes too sure of being right, too ready to accept his own authority&quot;. She asserted that while Wheeler was not an original thinker, he had &quot;a vision of human history that enabled him to see each discovery of its traces, however small, in its widest significance.&quot;

Piggott claimed that Wheeler&#x27;s appointment as Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India represented &quot;the most remarkable archaeological achievement of his career, an enormous challenge accepted and surmounted in the autocratic and authoritarian terms within which he could best deploy his powers as administrator and excavator. No other archaeologist of the time, it seems fair to remark, could have come near to attaining his command of incisive strategy and often ruthless tactics which won him the bewildered admiration and touching devotion of his Indian staff.&quot; The Indian archaeologist Dilip K. Chakrabarti later stated that Wheeler&#x27;s accomplishments while in India were &quot;considerable&quot;, particularly given the socio-political turmoil of independence and partition. Chakrabarti stated that Wheeler had contributed to South Asian archaeology in various ways: by establishing a &quot;total view&quot; of the region&#x27;s development from the Palaeolithic onward, by introducing new archaeological techniques and methodologies to the subcontinent, and by encouraging Indian universities to begin archaeological research. Ultimately, Chakrabarti was of the opinion that Wheeler had &quot;prepared the archaeology of the subcontinent for its transition to modernity in the post-Partition period.&quot; Similarly, Peter Johansen praised Wheeler for systematising and professionalising Indian archaeology and for &quot;instituting a clearly defined body of techniques and methods for field and laboratory work and training.&quot;

On Wheeler&#x27;s death, H. D. Sankalia of Deccan College, Pune, described him as &quot;well known among Old World archaeologists in the United States&quot;, particularly for his book &quot;Archaeology from the Earth&quot; and his studies of the Indus Valley Civilisation. In its 2013 obituary of the English archaeologist Mick Aston, &quot;British Archaeology&quot; magazine – the publication of the Council for British Archaeology – described Aston as &quot;the Mortimer Wheeler of our times&quot; because despite the strong differences between their personalities, both had done much to bring archaeology to the British public. However, writing in 2011, Moshenska and Schadla-Hall asserted that Wheeler&#x27;s reputation has not undergone significant revision among archaeologists, but that instead he had come to be remembered as &quot;a cartoonish and slightly eccentric figure&quot; whom they termed &quot;Naughty Morty&quot;.
Carr described the Institute of Archaeology as &quot;one of the [Wheeler] couple&#x27;s most permanent memorials.&quot;

===Mortimer Wheeler Archaeological Lectures===
On the proposal of Council of the British Academy, a lecture series was established to commemorate Sir Mortimer Wheeler&#x27;s 80th birthday. The lectures were given annually from 1971 to 1991 and then discontinued as a series of single lectures. In 1992 and again in 2001, Wheeler Lectures were keynote presentations in British Academy archaeological conferences.

===Biographies and studies===

In 1960, Ronald William Clark published a biography titled &quot;Sir Mortimer Wheeler&quot;. FitzRoy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan, reviewed the volume for the journal &quot;Man&quot;, describing &quot;this very readable little book&quot; as being &quot;adulatory&quot; in tone, &quot;but hardly more so than its subject deserves.&quot; In 1982, the archaeologist Jacquetta Hawkes published a second biography, &quot;Mortimer Wheeler: Adventurer in Archaeology&quot;. Hawkes admitted she had developed &quot;a very great liking&quot; for Wheeler, having first met him when she was an archaeology student at the University of Cambridge. She believed that he had &quot;a daemonic energy&quot;, with his accomplishments in India being &quot;almost superhuman&quot;. Ultimately, she thought of him as being &quot;an epic hero in an anti-heroic age&quot; in which growing social egalitarianism had stifled and condemned aspects of his greatness.

In the 2000 film &quot;Hey Ram&quot;, the lead character, Saket Ram (played by Kamal Haasan) and his friend, Amjad Khan (played by Shah Rukh Khan) are shown as employees of Wheeler, who was portrayed by Lewis K. Elbinger, before the 1947 Hindu–Muslim riots. In a 2003 volume of the &quot;South Asian Studies&quot; journal, Sudeshna Gusha published a research article examining Wheeler&#x27;s use of photography in his excavations and publications in the Indian subcontinent.
In 2011, the academic journal &quot;Public Archaeology&quot; published a research paper by Moshenska and Schadla-Hall that analysed Wheeler&#x27;s role in presenting archaeology to the British public. Two years later, the &quot;Papers from the Institute of Archaeology&quot; issued a short comic strip by Moshenska and Alex Salamunovich depicting Wheeler&#x27;s activities in studying the archaeology of Libya during World War II.

<text>Lieutenant General Augustus Henry Lane Fox Pitt Rivers (14 April 18274 May 1900) was an English officer in the British Army, ethnologist, and archaeologist. He was noted for innovations in archaeological methodology, and in the museum display of archaeological and ethnological collections. His international collection of about 22,000 objects was the founding collection of the Pitt Rivers Museum at the University of Oxford while his collection of English archaeology from the area around Stonehenge forms the basis of the collection at The Salisbury Museum in Wiltshire.

Throughout most of his life he used the surname Lane Fox, under which his early archaeological reports are published. In 1880 he adopted the Pitt Rivers name on inheriting from Lord Rivers (a cousin) an estate of more than 32,000 acres in Cranborne Chase.

His family name is often spelled as &quot;Pitt-Rivers&quot;. His middle name is sometimes spelled as &quot;Lane-Fox&quot;.

==Early life and family==
Born Augustus Henry Lane-Fox at Bramham cum Oglethorpe near Wetherby in Yorkshire, he was the son of William Lane-Fox and Lady Caroline Douglas, sister of George Douglas, 17th Earl of Morton. The politicians George Lane-Fox and Sackville Lane-Fox were his uncles.

In 1880, Lane Fox inherited the estates of his cousin, Horace Pitt-Rivers, 6th Baron Rivers and with it the remainder of the Richard Rigby fortune. It was &quot;an event that transformed his life&quot;. He was required to adopt the surname Pitt-Rivers as part of the bequest &#x27;either alone or in addition to his or their surname&#x27;. On 3 February 1853, Pitt-Rivers (still under the surname Fox) married The Honourable Alice Margaret Stanley (1828–1910), daughter of the politician Edward Stanley, 2nd Baron Stanley of Alderley and of the women&#x27;s education campaigner Henrietta Stanley, Baroness Stanley of Alderley. Alice had a slew of siblings active in the public issues of the day, several of whom married into prominent families. The Pitt Rivers Museum suggests that some of the founding collection, particularly some Indian items, may have come from John Constantine Stanley (1837–1878), younger brother of Alice.

==Descendants==
Augustus and Alice had nine children who reached adulthood; they were born between 1855 and 1866. As they were all born before Augustus took the new surname in 1880, their births are registered under the name of Fox (or Lane-Fox).

# Alexander Edward Lane Fox-Pitt-Rivers, 2 November 185519 August 1927. 
# St. George Lane Fox-Pitt, 14 September 18566 April 1932, electrical engineer, author, and student of psychic phenomena.

Augustus&#x27; descendants include his grandson, anthropologist, eugenicist, and anti-Semite George Pitt-Rivers, who was interned in 1940 under Defence Regulation 18B. George&#x27;s children included Michael Pitt-Rivers, and his brother, anthropologist and ethnographer Julian A. Pitt-Rivers. A further generation includes Augustus&#x27;s great-great-grandson, equestrian William Fox-Pitt.
==Military career==
Lane Fox had a long and successful military career as a staff officer. He was educated at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, for six months at the age of fourteen and was commissioned into the Grenadier Guards on 16 May 1845 as an ensign. In the course of a thirty-two-year military career, albeit much interrupted by leave, he only once saw major front line action, at the Battle of Alma in 1854. Soon after the battle, he was found unfit for active service and returned to England. In 1851 he became a member of the committee to experiment and report on the respective merits of the army&#x27;s smoothbore muskets. He was appointed to Woolwich to instruct in the use of the new Minié rifle in 1852. Subsequently, he was largely responsible for founding the Hythe school of Musketry in Kent and became its principal instructor, revising its &quot;Instruction of Musketry&quot; manual. The remainder of his service career revolved around musketry instruction and in 1858 he published a paper &quot;On the improvement of the rifle as a weapon for general use&quot;. He bought a promotion to captain on 2 August 1850. He was promoted to the brevet rank of lieutenant-colonel of the army &quot;for distinguished Service in the Field&quot; during the Crimean War. On 15 May 1857, he bought the rank of lieutenant-colonel in the Grenadier Guards. The then brevet-major Lane Fox was appointed a member of the Fifth Class of the Order of the Medjidie in 1858 for &quot;distinguished services before the enemy during the [Crimean War]&quot;. He was promoted to colonel on 22 January 1867 and major-general in 1877. Pitt Rivers retired in 1882 and was accorded the honorary rank of lieutenant-general.

==Archaeological career==
Pitt Rivers&#x27; interests in archaeology and ethnology began in the 1850s, during postings overseas, and he became a noted scientist while he was a serving military officer. His interest began with the evolution of the rifle, which extended to other weapons and tools, and he became a collector of artifacts illustrating the development of human invention. His collection became famous, and, after being exhibited in 1874–1875 at the Bethnal Green Museum, London, was presented in 1885 to the University of Oxford. He was elected, in the space of five years, to the Ethnological Society of London (1861), the Society of Antiquaries of London (1864) and the Anthropological Society of London (1865).

In 1867, Pitt Rivers left full-time military service and went on half pay. The same year, he visited an archaeological excavation being carried out in the Yorkshire Wolds by Canon William Greenwell, librarian of Durham Cathedral and an established archaeologist, to whom he may have been introduced by mutual friends George Rolleston or Albert Way. Pitt Rivers received his first instruction in excavation from Greenwell, and later described himself as Greenwell&#x27;s pupil. Greenwell viewed archaeology as a serious scholarly process of assembling evidence on periods which lacked written records, contrasted to the &quot;ignorant and greedy spirit of mere curiosity-hunting&quot;; views that would influence Pitt Rivers&#x27; own approach.

By the time he retired, he had amassed ethnographic collections numbering tens of thousands of items from all over the world. Influenced by the evolutionary writings of Charles Darwin and Herbert Spencer, he arranged them typologically and (within types) chronologically. He viewed archaeology as an extension of anthropology and, as consequence, built up matching collections of archaeological and ethnographic objects to show longer developmental sequences to support his views on cultural evolution. This style of arrangement, designed to highlight evolutionary trends in human artefacts, was a revolutionary innovation in museum design.

Pitt Rivers&#x27; ethnological collections form the basis of the Pitt Rivers Museum which is still one of Oxford&#x27;s attractions. His researches and collections cover periods from the Lower Paleolithic to Roman and medieval times, and extend all over the world. The Pitt Rivers Museum curates more than half a million ethnographic and archaeological artifacts, photographic and manuscript collections from all parts of the world. The museum was founded in 1884 when the university accepted the gift of more than 20,000 artifacts from Pitt Rivers. The university awarded him the Doctorate of Civil Law in 1886, and he was later named a Fellow of the Royal Society. The collections continue to grow, and the museum has been described as one of the &quot;six great ethnological museums of the world&quot;.

Pitt Rivers&#x27; Wessex Collection is housed in The Salisbury Museum, not far from Stonehenge. The Wessex Gallery of archaeology opened in 2014, funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund and other sources. Pitt Rivers and other early archaeologists such as William Stukeley who first investigated the prehistory of Wiltshire, Cranborne Chase, Avebury and Stonehenge, are celebrated in the gallery.

The estates Pitt Rivers inherited in 1880 contained a wealth of archaeological material from the Roman and Saxon periods. He excavated these over seventeen seasons, from the mid-1880s until his death. His approach was highly methodical by the standards of the time, and he is widely regarded as the first scientific archaeologist to work in Britain. His most important methodological innovation was his insistence that &quot;all&quot; artefacts, not just beautiful or unique ones, be collected and catalogued. This focus on everyday objects as the key to understanding the past broke decisively with earlier archaeological practice, which verged on treasure hunting. It is Pitt Rivers&#x27; most important, and most lasting, scientific legacy. His work inspired Mortimer Wheeler, among others, to add to the scientific approach of archaeological excavation techniques.

Following the passage of the Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882, Pitt Rivers became the first Inspector of Ancient Monuments: a post created by anthropologist and parliamentarian John Lubbock who married Pitt Rivers&#x27; daughter, Alice. Charged with cataloguing archaeological sites and protecting them from destruction, he worked with his customary methodical zeal but was hampered by the limitations of the law, which gave him little real power over the landowners on whose property the sites stood. On the advice of Pitt-Rivers, Kit&#x27;s Coty House and Little Kit&#x27;s Coty House, Kent, were among the first ancient British remains to be protected by the state. Railings were erected around the stones there to prevent vandalism.

Pitt Rivers was a leading member of the Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society, and was president of the society from 1890 to 1893.

== Other interests ==
The Rushmore estate near Tollard Royal in Wiltshire was part of his 1880 inheritance, and there he created the Larmer Tree Gardens, a pleasure garden which was opened to the public in 1885.

In 1884 he served as High Sheriff of Dorset.Pitt Rivers was an advocate for cremation. Even though many people believed that it was immoral to destroy a corpse, the cremation movement favoured a practical way to dispose of bodies. Pitt Rivers was cremated after his death in 1900.

<text>Environmental engineering is a professional engineering discipline related to environmental science. It encompasses broad scientific topics like chemistry, biology, ecology, geology, hydraulics, hydrology, microbiology, and mathematics to create solutions that will protect and also improve the health of living organisms and improve the quality of the environment. Environmental engineering is a sub-discipline of civil engineering and chemical engineering. While on the part of civil engineering, the Environmental Engineering is focused mainly on Sanitary Engineering.

Environmental engineering applies scientific and engineering principles to improve and maintain the environment to protect human health, protect nature&#x27;s beneficial ecosystems, and improve environmental-related enhancement of the quality of human life.
Environmental engineers devise solutions for wastewater management, water and air pollution control, recycling, waste disposal, and public health. They design municipal water supply and industrial wastewater treatment systems, and design plans to prevent waterborne diseases and improve sanitation in urban, rural and recreational areas. They evaluate hazardous-waste management systems to evaluate the severity of such hazards, advise on treatment and containment, and develop regulations to prevent mishaps. They implement environmental engineering law, as in assessing the environmental impact of proposed construction projects.

Environmental engineers study the effect of technological advances on the environment, addressing local and worldwide environmental issues such as acid rain, global warming, ozone depletion, water pollution and air pollution from automobile exhausts and industrial sources.

Most jurisdictions impose licensing and registration requirements for qualified environmental engineers.

== Etymology ==
The word environmental has its root in the late 19th-century French word environ (verb), meaning to encircle or to encompass. The word environment was used by Carlyle in 1827 to refer to the aggregate of conditions in which a person or thing lives. The meaning shifted again in 1956 when it was used in the ecological sense, where Ecology is the branch of science dealing with the relationship of living things to their environment.

The second part of the phrase environmental engineer originates from Latin roots and was used in the 14th century French as engignour, meaning a constructor of military engines such as trebuchets, harquebuses, longbows, cannons, catapults, ballistas, stirrups, armour as well as other deadly or bellicose contraptions. The word engineer was not used to reference public works until the 16th century; and it likely entered the popular vernacular as meaning a contriver of public works during John Smeaton&#x27;s time.

==History==
=== Ancient civilizations ===
Environmental engineering is a name for work that has been done since early civilizations, as people learned to modify and control the environmental conditions to meet needs. As people recognized that their health was related to the quality of their environment, they built systems to improve it. The ancient Indus Valley Civilization (3300 B.C.E. to 1300 B.C.E.) had advanced control over their water resources. The public work structures found at various sites in the area include wells, public baths, water storage tanks, a drinking water system, and a city-wide sewage collection system. They also had an early canal irrigation system enabling large-scale agriculture.

From 4000 to 2000 B.C.E., many civilizations had drainage systems and some had sanitation facilities, including the Mesopotamian Empire, Mohenjo-Daro, Egypt, Crete, and the Orkney Islands in Scotland. The Greeks also had aqueducts and sewer systems that used rain and wastewater to irrigate and fertilize fields.

The first aqueduct in Rome was constructed in 312 B.C.E., and the Romans continued to construct aqueducts for irrigation and safe urban water supply during droughts. They also built an underground sewer system as early as the 7th century B.C.E. that fed into the Tiber River, draining marshes to create farmland as well as removing sewage from the city.

=== Modern era ===
Very little change was seen from the decline of the Roman Empire until the 19th century, where improvements saw increasing efforts focused on public health. Modern environmental engineering began in London in the mid-19th century when Joseph Bazalgette designed the first major sewerage system following the Great Stink. The city&#x27;s sewer system conveyed raw sewage to the River Thames, which also supplied the majority of the city&#x27;s drinking water, leading to an outbreak of cholera. The introduction of drinking water treatment and sewage treatment in industrialized countries reduced waterborne diseases from leading causes of death to rarities.

The field emerged as a separate academic discipline during the middle of the 20th century in response to widespread public concern about water and air pollution and other environmental degradation. As society and technology grew more complex, they increasingly produced unintended effects on the natural environment. One example is the widespread application of the pesticide DDT to control agricultural pests in the years following World War II. The story of DDT as vividly told in Rachel Carson&#x27;s &quot;Silent Spring&quot; (1962) is considered to be the birth of the modern environmental movement, which led to the modern field of &quot;environmental engineering.&quot;

==Education==

Many universities offer environmental engineering programs through either the department of civil engineering or chemical engineering and also including electronic projects to develop and balance the environmental
conditions. Environmental engineers in a civil engineering program often focus on hydrology, water resources management, bioremediation, and water and wastewater treatment plant design. Environmental engineers in a chemical engineering program tend to focus on environmental chemistry, advanced air and water treatment technologies, and separation processes. Some subdivisions of environmental engineering include natural resources engineering and agricultural engineering.

Courses for students fall into a few broad classes:
* &quot;Mechanical engineering&quot; courses oriented towards designing machines and mechanical systems for environmental use such as water and wastewater treatment facilities, pumping stations, garbage segregation plants, and other mechanical facilities.
* &quot;Environmental engineering&quot; or &quot;environmental systems&quot; courses oriented towards a civil engineering approach in which structures and the landscape are constructed to blend with or protect the environment.
* &quot;Environmental chemistry&quot;, &quot;sustainable chemistry&quot; or &quot;environmental chemical engineering&quot; courses oriented towards understanding the effects of chemicals in the environment, including any mining processes, pollutants, and also biochemical processes.
* &quot;Environmental technology&quot; courses oriented towards producing electronic or electrical graduates capable of developing devices and artifacts able to monitor, measure, model and control environmental impact, including monitoring and managing energy generation from renewable sources.

== Applications ==

===Water supply and treatment===
Environmental engineers evaluate the water balance within a watershed and determine the available water supply, the water needed for various needs in that watershed, the seasonal cycles of water movement through the watershed and they develop systems to store, treat, and convey water for various uses.

Water is treated to achieve water quality objectives for the end uses. In the case of a potable water supply, water is treated to minimize the risk of infectious disease transmission, the risk of non-infectious illness, and to create a palatable water flavor. Water distribution systems are designed and built to provide adequate water pressure and flow rates to meet various end-user needs such as domestic use, fire suppression, and irrigation.

===Wastewater treatment===
There are numerous wastewater treatment technologies. A wastewater treatment train can consist of a primary clarifier system to remove solid and floating materials, a secondary treatment system consisting of an aeration basin followed by flocculation and sedimentation or an activated sludge system and a secondary clarifier, a tertiary biological nitrogen removal system, and a final disinfection process. The aeration basin/activated sludge system removes organic material by growing bacteria (activated sludge). The secondary clarifier removes the activated sludge from the water. The tertiary system, although not always included due to costs, is becoming more prevalent to remove nitrogen and phosphorus and to disinfect the water before discharge to a surface water stream or ocean outfall.

===Air pollution management===

Scientists have developed air pollution dispersion models to evaluate the concentration of a pollutant at a receptor or the impact on overall air quality from vehicle exhausts and industrial flue gas stack emissions. To some extent, this field overlaps the desire to decrease carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions from combustion processes.

===Environmental impact assessment and mitigation===
Environmental engineers apply scientific and engineering principles to evaluate if there are likely to be any adverse impacts to water quality, air quality, habitat quality, flora and fauna, agricultural capacity, traffic, ecology, and noise. If impacts are expected, they then develop mitigation measures to limit or prevent such impacts. An example of a mitigation measure would be the creation of wetlands in a nearby location to mitigate the filling in of wetlands necessary for a road development if it is not possible to reroute the road.

In the United States, the practice of environmental assessment was formally initiated on January 1, 1970, the effective date of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Since that time, more than 100 developing and developed nations either have planned specific analogous laws or have adopted procedure used elsewhere. NEPA is applicable to all federal agencies in the United States.

== Regulatory agencies ==

===Environmental Protection Agency===
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is one of the many agencies that work with environmental engineers to solve critical issues. An essential component of EPA&#x27;s mission is to protect and improve air, water, and overall environmental quality to avoid or mitigate the consequences of harmful effects.

<text>Construction engineering, also known as construction operations, is a professional subdiscipline of civil engineering that deals with the designing, planning, construction, and operations management of infrastructure such as roadways, tunnels, bridges, airports, railroads, facilities, buildings, dams, utilities and other projects. Construction engineers learn some of the design aspects similar to civil engineers as well as project management aspects.

At the educational level, civil engineering students concentrate primarily on the design work which is more analytical, gearing them toward a career as a design professional. This essentially requires them to take a multitude of challenging engineering science and design courses as part of obtaining a 4-year accredited degree. Education for construction engineers is primarily focused on construction procedures, methods, costs, schedules and personnel management. Their primary concern is to deliver a project on time within budget and of the desired quality.

Regarding educational requirements, construction engineering students take basic design courses in civil engineering, as well as construction management courses.

==Work activities==
Being a sub-discipline of civil engineering, construction engineers apply their knowledge and business, technical and management skills obtained from their undergraduate degree to oversee projects that include bridges, buildings and housing projects. Construction engineers are heavily involved in the design and management/ allocation of funds in these projects. They are charged with risk analysis, costing and planning. A career in design work does require a professional engineer license (PE). Individuals who pursue this career path are strongly advised to sit for the Engineer in Training exam (EIT), also, referred to as the Fundamentals of Engineering Exam (FE) while in college as it takes five years&#x27; (4 years in USA) post-graduate to obtain the PE license. Some states have recently changed the PE license exam pre-requisite of 4 years work experience after graduation to become a licensed Professional Engineer where an EIT is eligible to take the PE Exam in as little as 6 months after taking the FE exam.

Entry-level construction engineers position is typically project engineers or assistant project engineers. They are responsible for preparing purchasing requisitions, processing change orders, preparing monthly budgeting reports and handling meeting minutes. The construction management position does not necessarily require a PE license; however, possessing one does make the individual more marketable, as the PE license allows the individual to sign off on temporary structure designs.
==Abilities==
Construction engineers are problem solvers. They contribute to the creation of infrastructure that best meets the unique demands of its environment. They must be able to understand infrastructure life cycles. When compared and contrasted to design engineers, construction engineers bring to the table their own unique perspectives for solving technical challenges with clarity and imagination. While individuals considering this career path should certainly have a strong understanding of mathematics and science, many other skills are also highly desirable, including critical and analytical thinking, time management, people management and good communication skills.

==Educational requirements==
Individuals looking to obtain a construction engineering degree must first ensure that the program is accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). ABET accreditation is assurance that a college or university program meets the quality standards established by the profession for which it prepares its students. In the US there are currently twenty-five programs that exist in the entire country so careful college consideration is advised.

A typical construction engineering curriculum is a mixture of engineering mechanics, engineering design, construction management and general science and mathematics. This usually leads to a Bachelor of Science degree. The B.S. degree along with some design or construction experience is sufficient for most entry-level positions. Graduate schools may be an option for those who want to go further in depth of the construction and engineering subjects taught at the undergraduate level. In most cases construction engineering graduates look to either civil engineering, engineering management or business administration as a possible graduate degree.

==Job prospects==
Job prospects for construction engineers generally have a strong cyclical variation. For example, starting in 2008 and continuing until at least 2011, job prospects have been poor due to the collapse of housing bubbles in many parts of the world. This sharply reduced demand for construction, forced construction professionals towards infrastructure construction and therefore increased the competition faced by established and new construction engineers. This increased competition and a core reduction in quantity demand is in parallel with a possible shift in the demand for construction engineers due to the automation of many engineering tasks, overall resulting in reduced prospects for construction engineers. In early 2010, the United States construction industry had a 27% unemployment rate, this is nearly three times higher than the 9.7% national average unemployment rate. The construction unemployment rate (including tradesmen) is comparable to the United States 1933 unemployment rate—the lowest point of the Great Depression—of 25%.

==Remuneration==
The average salary for a civil engineer in the UK depends on the sector and more specifically the level of experience of the individual. A 2010 survey of the remuneration and benefits of those occupying jobs in construction and the built environment industry showed that the average salary of a civil engineer in the UK is £29,582. In the United States, as of May 2013, the average was $85,640. The average salary varies depending on experience, for example the average annual salary for a civil engineer with between 3 and 6 years&#x27; experience is £23,813. For those with between 14 and 20 years&#x27; experience the average is £38,214.

<text>is a Japanese military science fiction media franchise. Created by Yoshiyuki Tomino and Sunrise (now Bandai Namco Filmworks), the franchise features giant robots, or mecha, with the name &quot;Gundam&quot;. The franchise began on April 7, 1979, with &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot;, a TV series that defined the &quot;real robot&quot; mecha anime genre by featuring giant robots called mobile suits (including the original titular mecha) in a militaristic setting. The popularity of the series and its merchandise spawned a franchise that includes 50 TV series, films and OVAs as well as manga, novels and video games, along with a whole industry of plastic model kits known as Gunpla which makes up 90 percent of the Japanese character plastic-model market.

Academics in Japan have viewed the series as inspiration; in 2008, the virtual Gundam Academy was planned as the first academic institution based on an animated TV series.

As of March 2020, the franchise is fully owned by Bandai Namco Holdings through subsidiaries Sotsu and Sunrise. The &quot;Gundam&quot; franchise had grossed over in retail sales by 2000. By 2022, the annual revenue of the &quot;Gundam&quot; franchise reached ¥101.7 billion per year, ¥44.2 billion of which was retail sales of toys and hobby items.

==Overview==
===Concept===
&quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; was developed by animator Yoshiyuki Tomino and a changing group of Sunrise creators with the collective pseudonym of Hajime Yatate. The series was originally entitled &quot;Freedom Fighter Gunboy&quot; (or &quot;Gunboy&quot;) for the robot&#x27;s gun, with teen boys as the primary target demographic. Early production had a number of references to freedom: the White Base was originally &quot;Freedom&#x27;s Fortress&quot;, the Core Fighter was the &quot;Freedom Wing&quot; and the Gunperry was the &quot;Freedom Cruiser&quot;. The Yatate team combined the English word &quot;gun&quot; with the last syllable of the word &quot;freedom&quot; to form the portmanteau &quot;Gundom&quot;. Tomino changed it to &quot;Gundam&quot;, suggesting a unit wielding a gun powerful enough to hold back enemies like a hydroelectric dam holding back water. In keeping with the concept, Gundams are usually depicted as prototypes or limited-production, with higher capabilities than mass-produced units, which are often referred to simply as &quot;mobile suits&quot;.

Most Gundams are large, bipedal, humanoid vehicles controlled from a cockpit by a human pilot. The cockpit is located in the torso, while the head serves as a camera to transmit images back to the cockpit. Most of the series&#x27; protagonists are Newtypes, genetically advanced humans adapted for space. Newtypes have psychic abilities that enable them to sense each other across space and to utilize special mobile suits.

The series itself has been described as a space opera.

===Innovation===
&quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; reportedly pioneered the real robot subgenre of mecha anime. In contrast to its super robot cousins, &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; attempted realism in its robot design and weaponry by running out of energy and ammunition or malfunctioning. Its technology is derived from actual science (such as Lagrange points and the O&#x27;Neill cylinder in space, and the use of helium-3 as an energy source) or feasible technology requiring only a few fictional elements to function (such as Minovsky Physics).

===Timelines===
Most of the &quot;Gundam&quot; animation (including the earliest series) is set in what is known as the Universal Century (UC) calendar era, with later series set in alternate calendars or timelines. Although many new &quot;Gundam&quot; stories are told in their parallel universe with independent timelines (giving them greater creative freedom), the original UC storyline continues to be popular, with new installments frequently produced ever since. It established the series, setting the standard for hard science fiction in anime; the original &quot;Gundam&quot; marked the maturing of the giant-robot genre. Nostalgia for the oldest &quot;Gundam&quot; shows (and its status as a pop-culture icon in Japan) is a factor in its continuing success.

===Spinoffs===
&quot;SD Gundam&quot;, a spinoff of &quot;Gundam&quot; which began during the mid-1980s, features super deformed designs and emphasizes comedy and adventure. &quot;Model Suit Gunpla Builders Beginning G&quot;, &quot;Gundam Build Fighters&quot;, and &quot;Gundam Build Divers&quot; feature contemporary settings and use Gunpla as plot elements.

==Media==

===TV series, films, and video===
Except for &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam 00&quot;, which follows the current calendar era, all &quot;Gundam&quot; series are set in a fictional era, with a new calendar adopted after a drastic event or chain of events and typically involve a major conflict involving Earth and space colonies (and in some cases the Moon and terraformed planets). An exception is the &quot;Gundam Build&quot; timeline, which is set in an alternate present time where all other &quot;Gundam&quot; installments are fictional.

===Live-action film===
At the 2018 Anime Expo, Legendary Pictures and Sunrise announced a collaboration to develop a live-action &quot;Gundam&quot; film. Brian K. Vaughan was brought in to write and serve as an executive producer for the film. In April 2021, it was reported that the project had landed at Netflix and that Jordan Vogt-Roberts had been hired to direct. In October 2024, it was announced that Jim Mickle would be the new director and writer, and that Netflix is no longer involved.

===Manga and novels===
Manga adaptations of the &quot;Gundam&quot; series have been published in English in North America by a number of companies, such as Viz Media, Del Rey Manga and Tokyopop, and in Singapore by Chuang Yi.

===Video games===

&quot;Gundam&quot; has spawned over 80 video games for arcade, computer and console platforms, some with characters not found in other &quot;Gundam&quot; media. Some of the games, in turn, inspired spinoff novels and manga.

===Gunpla===
Primarily made of plastic, but sometimes paired with resin and metal detail parts, hundreds of Gundam scale plastic models, aka Gunpla, have been released. They range in quality from toolless-build children&#x27;s toy kits (Entry Grades) to hobbyist and museum-grade models, and most are in common scales such as 1:35, 1:48, 1:60, 1:100 or 1:144 scale. Various Grades exist to target hobbyists, ranging from smaller sized kits such as High Grade and Real Grade, to larger Master Grade and finally Perfect Grade model kits. The Real Grade (RG) Gundam series combined the Master Grade&#x27;s detailed inner structure with additional colour separation, making the 1:144-scale series complex in design and compact in size, with the final goal of retooling a Gundam to what they might would look like in real life, similar to the real-life Gundam Front Tokyo RX-78-02.

Promotional 1:6 or 1:12 scale models are supplied to retailers and are not commercially available. For &quot;Gundam&quot; 30th anniversary, a full-size RX-78-2 Gundam model was constructed and displayed at Gundam Front Tokyo, in the Odaiba district; it was taken down on March 5, 2017. A new statue of the Unicorn Gundam was erected at the same location, now renamed The Gundam Base Tokyo.

===Other merchandise===
Bandai, &quot;Gundam&quot; primary licensee, produces a variety of products. Other companies produce unofficial merchandise, such as toys, models and T-shirts. Products include Mobile Suit In Action (MSiA) action figures and Gundam model kits in several scales and design complexities. Each series generally has its own set of products, MSiA and model lines such as Master Grade and High Grade Universal Century may extend across series. The most popular action-figure line has been the Gundam Fix series, which includes the mecha in the animated series, manga and novels and accessories to create an updated version. In addition to Master Grade and High Grade Gundams, Bandai released a 30th-anniversary series of Gundam models in 2010. After the introduction of the RG Gunpla line, Bandai released the Metal Build series in March 2011 (beginning with the 00 Gundam).

===Internet===

Bandai maintains several websites to promote &quot;Gundam&quot; projects; Gundam Perfect Web is the official Japanese site. Its English-language counterpart is the US-maintained Gundam Official. In 2005, the website hosted the Gundam Official User Forum. The forum was based on the existing fan forum, Gundam Watch, using many of its staff. When the project was retired, Gundam Watch was reborn and became Gundam Evolution.

A number of series-specific websites have been created, often available for a limited time (usually to promote a DVD release). Common content includes character and mecha listings, lists of related merchandise and pay-for-download content. Special pages are frequent, often presenting downloadable wallpaper or a small game. The &quot;Superior Defender Gundam Force&quot; website has a game in which players take the role of villain Commander Sazabi, attempting to blast his subordinate with weapons.

==Global spread==
Since 1980, &quot;Gundam&quot; has also appeared in the following countries and regions:
==Impact==
&quot;Gundam&quot; is a Japanese cultural icon and a multi-billion-Yen annual business for Bandai Namco. Annual revenue for the franchise reached ¥54.5 billion by 2006, by 2014, and by 2024. Stamps have been issued, an Agriculture Ministry employee was reprimanded for contributing to the Japanese Wikipedia &quot;Gundam&quot;-related pages, and the Japan Self-Defense Forces has code-named its developing advanced personal-combat system Gundam. Based on a December 16, 2023 survey conducted by &quot;Nikkei Entertainment&quot;, the fanbase of &quot;Gundam&quot; within Japan has an average age of 42 years, and a male-to-female ratio that skews 90:10.

The impact of &quot;Gundam&quot; in Japan has been compared to the impact of &quot;Star Wars&quot; in the United States.

<text>Middle English (abbreviated to ME) is a form of the English language that was spoken after the Norman Conquest of 1066, until the late 15th century. The English language underwent distinct variations and developments following the Old English period. Scholarly opinion varies, but the University of Valencia states the period when Middle English was spoken as being from 1150 to 1500. This stage of the development of the English language roughly coincided with the High and Late Middle Ages.

Middle English saw significant changes to its vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation, and orthography. Writing conventions during the Middle English period varied widely. Examples of writing from this period that have survived show extensive regional variation. The more standardized Old English literary variety broke down and writing in English became fragmented and localized and was, for the most part, being improvised. By the end of the period (about 1470), and aided by the invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg in 1439, a standard based on the London dialects (Chancery Standard) had become established. This largely formed the basis for Modern English spelling, although pronunciation has changed considerably since that time. Middle English was succeeded in England by Early Modern English, which lasted until about 1650. Scots developed concurrently from a variant of the Northumbrian dialect (prevalent in northern England and spoken in southeast Scotland).

During the Middle English period, many Old English grammatical features either became simplified or disappeared altogether. Noun, adjective, and verb inflections were simplified by the reduction (and eventual elimination) of most grammatical case distinctions. Middle English also saw considerable adoption of Anglo-Norman vocabulary, especially in the areas of politics, law, the arts, and religion, as well as poetic and emotive diction. Conventional English vocabulary remained primarily Germanic in its sources, with Old Norse influences becoming more apparent. Significant changes in pronunciation took place, particularly involving long vowels and diphthongs, which in the later Middle English period began to undergo the Great Vowel Shift.

Little survives of early Middle English literature, due in part to Norman domination and the prestige that came with writing in French rather than English. During the 14th century, a new style of literature emerged with the works of writers including John Wycliffe and Geoffrey Chaucer, whose &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot; remains the most studied and read work of the period.

==History==

=== Transition from Old English ===
The transition from Late Old English to Early Middle English had taken place by the 1150s to 1180s, the period when the Augustinian canon Orrm wrote the &quot;Ormulum&quot;, one of the oldest surviving texts in Middle English.

Contact with Old Norse aided the development of English from a synthetic language with relatively free word order to a more analytic language with a stricter word order, as both Old English and Old Norse were synthetic languages with complicated inflections. Communication between Vikings in the Danelaw and their Anglo-Saxon neighbours resulted in the erosion of inflection in both languages, this effect was characterized to be of a &quot;substantive, pervasive, and of a democratic&quot; manner. Like close cousins, Old Norse and Old English resembled each other, and with a lot of vocabulary and grammatical structures in common, speakers of each language roughly understood each other, but according to the historian Simeon Potler, the main difference lied on their inflectional endings, which led to much confusion within the mixed population that existed in the Danelaw, this endings tended gradually to become obscured and finally lost, &quot;simplifying English grammar&quot; in the process, leading to the emergence of the analytic pattern. The dramatic changes that happened in English contribute to the acceptance of the hypothesis that Old Norse had a more profound impact on the development of Middle and Modern English than any other language. 

Viking influence on Old English is most apparent in pronouns, modals, comparatives, pronominal adverbs (like &quot;hence&quot; and &quot;together&quot;), conjunctions, and prepositions show the most marked Danish influence. The best evidence of Scandinavian influence appears in extensive word borrowings; however, texts from the period in Scandinavia and Northern England do not provide certain evidence of an influence on syntax. However, at least one scholarly study of this influence shows that Old English may have been replaced entirely by Norse, by virtue of the change from Old English to Norse syntax. 

While the Old Norse influence was strongest in the dialects under Danish control that composed the southern part of the Northern England (corresponding to the Scandinavian Kingdom of Jórvík), the East Midlands and the East of England, words in the spoken language emerged in the 10th and 11th centuries near the transition from Old to Middle English. Influence on the written languages only appeared from the beginning of the 13th century, this delay in Scandinavian lexical influence in English has been attributed to the lack of written evidence from the areas of Danish control, as the majority of written sources from Old English were produced in the West Saxon dialect spoken in Wessex, the heart of Anglo-Saxon political power at the time.

The Norman Conquest of England in 1066 saw the replacement of the top levels of the English-speaking political and ecclesiastical hierarchies by Norman rulers who spoke a dialect of Old French, now known as Old Norman, which developed in England into Anglo-Norman. The use of Norman as the preferred language of literature and polite discourse fundamentally altered the role of Old English in education and administration, even though many Normans of this period were illiterate and depended on the clergy for written communication and record-keeping. A significant number of Norman words were borrowed into English and used alongside native Germanic words with similar meanings. Examples of Norman/Germanic pairs in Modern English include &quot;pig&quot; and &quot;pork&quot;, &quot;calf&quot; and &quot;veal&quot;, &quot;wood&quot; and &quot;forest&quot;, and &quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;liberty&quot;.
The role of Anglo-Norman as the language of government and law can be seen in the abundance of Modern English words for the mechanisms of government that are derived from Anglo-Norman, such as &quot;court&quot;, &quot;judge&quot;, &quot;jury&quot;, &quot;appeal&quot;, and &quot;parliament&quot;. There are also many Norman-derived terms relating to the chivalric cultures that arose in the 12th century, an era of feudalism, seigneurialism, and crusading.

Words were often taken from Latin, usually through French transmission. This gave rise to various synonyms, including &quot;kingly&quot; (inherited from Old English), &quot;royal&quot; (from French, inherited from Vulgar Latin), and &quot;regal&quot; (from French, which borrowed it from Classical Latin). Later French appropriations were derived from standard, rather than Norman, French. Examples of the resulting doublet pairs include &quot;warden&quot; (from Norman) and &quot;guardian&quot; (from later French; both share a common ancestor loaned from Germanic).

The end of Anglo-Saxon rule did not result in immediate changes to the language. The general population would have spoken the same dialects as they had before the Conquest. Once the writing of Old English came to an end, Middle English had no standard language, only dialects that evolved individually from Old English.

Ralph d&#x27;Escures’
&quot;Homily on the Virgin Mary&quot;, a French work translated into Latin then English in the first half of the 12th Century, was either one of &quot;the very latest compositions in Old English, or, as some scholars would
have it, the very earliest in Middle English,&quot; having an Old English vocabulary co-existing with simplified inflexion.

===Early Middle English===
Early Middle English (1150–1350) has a largely Anglo-Saxon vocabulary (with many Norse borrowings in the northern parts of the country) but a greatly simplified inflectional system. The grammatical relations that were expressed in Old English by the dative and instrumental cases were replaced in Early Middle English with prepositional constructions. The Old English genitive - survives in the &quot;-&#x27;s&quot; of the modern English possessive, but most of the other case endings disappeared in the Early Middle English period, including most of the roughly one dozen forms of the definite article (&quot;the&quot;). The dual personal pronouns (denoting exactly two) also disappeared from English during this period.

The loss of case endings was part of a general trend from inflections to fixed word order that also occurred in other Germanic languages (though more slowly and to a lesser extent), and, therefore, it cannot be attributed simply to the influence of French-speaking sections of the population: English did, after all, remain the vernacular. It is also argued that Norse immigrants to England had a great impact on the loss of inflectional endings in Middle English. One argument is that, although Norse and English speakers were somewhat comprehensible to each other due to similar morphology, the Norse speakers&#x27; inability to reproduce the ending sounds of English words influenced Middle English&#x27;s loss of inflectional endings.

Important texts for the reconstruction of the evolution of Middle English out of Old English are the &quot;Peterborough Chronicle&quot;, which continued to be compiled up to 1154; the &quot;Ormulum&quot;, a biblical commentary probably composed in Lincolnshire in the second half of the 12th century, incorporating a unique phonetic spelling system; and the and the Katherine Group, religious texts written for anchoresses, apparently in the West Midlands in the early 13th century. The language found in the last two works is sometimes called the AB language: one of a range of regional dialects: East Midlands (London), South West (Kentish), Western (AB) and Northern.

Additional literary sources of the 12th and 13th centuries include &quot;Layamon&#x27;s Brut&quot; and &quot;The Owl and the Nightingale&quot;.

Some scholars have defined &quot;Early Middle English&quot; as encompassing English texts up to 1350. This longer time frame would extend the corpus to include many Middle English Romances (especially those of the &quot;Auchinleck manuscript&quot; ).

===Late Middle English===
Gradually, the wealthy and the government Anglicised again, although Norman (and subsequently French) remained the dominant language of literature and law until the 14th century, even after the loss of the majority of the continental possessions of the English monarchy. 

In the aftermath of the Black Death of the 14th century, there was significant migration into London, of people to the counties of the southeast of England and from the east and central Midlands of England, and a new prestige London dialect began to develop as a result of this clash of the different dialects, that was based chiefly on the speech of the East Midlands but also influenced by that of other regions. The writing of this period, however, continues to reflect a variety of regional forms of English. The , a translation of a French confessional prose work, completed in 1340, is written in a Kentish dialect. The best known writer of Middle English, Geoffrey Chaucer, wrote in the second half of the 14th century in the emerging London dialect, although he also portrays some of his characters as speaking in northern dialects, as in &quot;The Reeve&#x27;s Tale&quot;.

In the English-speaking areas of lowland Scotland, an independent standard was developing, based on the Northumbrian dialect. This would develop into what came to be known as the Scots language.

A large number of terms for abstract concepts were adopted directly from scholastic philosophical Latin (rather than via French). Examples are &quot;absolute&quot;, &quot;act&quot;, &quot;demonstration&quot;, and &quot;probable&quot;.

===Transition to Early Modern English===
The Chancery Standard of written English emerged in official documents that, since the Norman Conquest, had normally been written in French. Like Chaucer&#x27;s work, this new standard was based on the East Midlands-influenced speech of London. Clerks using this standard were usually familiar with French and Latin, influencing the forms they chose. The Chancery Standard, which was adopted slowly, was used in England by bureaucrats for most official purposes, excluding those of the Church and legalities, which used Latin and Law French respectively.

The Chancery Standard&#x27;s influence on later forms of written English is disputed, but it did undoubtedly provide the core around which Early Modern English formed. Early Modern English emerged with the help of William Caxton&#x27;s printing press, developed during the 1470s. The press stabilized English through a push towards standardization, led by Chancery Standard enthusiast and writer Richard Pynson. Early Modern English began in the 1540s after the printing and wide distribution of the English Bible and Prayer Book, which made the new standard of English publicly recognizable and lasted until about 1650.

==Phonology==

The main changes between the Old English sound system and that of Middle English include:
*Emergence of the voiced fricatives , , as separate phonemes, rather than mere allophones of the corresponding voiceless fricatives
*Reduction of the Old English diphthongs to monophthongs and the emergence of new diphthongs due to vowel breaking in certain positions, change of Old English post-vocalic , (sometimes resulting from the allophone of ) to offglides, and borrowing from French
*Merging of Old English into a single vowel 
*Raising of the long vowel to 
*Rounding of to in the southern dialects
*Unrounding of the front rounded vowels in most dialects
*Lengthening of vowels in open syllables (and in certain other positions). The resultant long vowels (and other preexisting long vowels) subsequently underwent changes of quality in the Great Vowel Shift, which began during the later Middle English period.
*Loss of gemination (double consonants came to be pronounced as single ones)
*Loss of weak final vowels (schwa, written ). By Chaucer&#x27;s time, this vowel was silent in normal speech, although it was normally pronounced in verse as the meter required (much as occurs in modern French). Also, nonfinal unstressed was dropped when adjacent to only a single consonant on either side if there was another short in an adjoining syllable. Thus, began to be pronounced as , and as .

The combination of the last three processes listed above led to the spelling conventions associated with silent and doubled consonants (see under Orthography, below).

==Morphology==

=== Nouns ===
Middle English retains only two distinct noun-ending patterns from the more complex system of inflection in Old English:

Nouns of the weak declension are primarily inherited from Old English &quot;n&quot;-stem nouns but also from &quot;ō&quot;-stem, &quot;wō&quot;-stem, and &quot;u&quot;-stem nouns, which did not inflect in the same way as &quot;n&quot;-stem nouns in Old English, but joined the weak declension in Middle English. Nouns of the strong declension are inherited from the other Old English noun stem classes.

Some nouns of the strong type have an &quot;-e&quot; in the nominative/accusative singular, like the weak declension, but otherwise strong endings. Often, these are the same nouns that had an &quot;-e&quot; in the nominative/accusative singular of Old English (they, in turn, were inherited from Proto-Germanic &quot;ja&quot;-stem and &quot;i&quot;-stem nouns).

The distinct dative case was lost in early Middle English, and although the genitive survived, by the end of the Middle English period only the strong &quot;-&#x27;s&quot; ending (variously spelled) was in use. Some formerly feminine nouns, as well as some weak nouns, continued to make their genitive forms with &quot;-e&quot; or no ending (e.g., , horses&#x27; hooves), and nouns of relationship ending in &quot;-er&quot; frequently have no genitive ending (e.g., , &quot;father&#x27;s bane&quot;).

The strong &quot;-(e)s&quot; plural form has survived into Modern English. The weak &quot;-(e)n&quot; form is now rare and used only in &quot;oxen&quot; and as part of a double plural, in &quot;children&quot; and &quot;brethren&quot;. Some dialects still have forms such as &quot;eyen&quot; (for &quot;eyes&quot;), &quot;shoon&quot; (for &quot;shoes&quot;), &quot;hosen&quot; (for &quot;hose(s)&quot;), &quot;kine&quot; (for &quot;cows&quot;), and &quot;been&quot; (for &quot;bees&quot;).

Grammatical gender survived to a limited extent in early Middle English before being replaced by natural gender in the course of the Middle English period. Grammatical gender was indicated by agreement of articles and pronouns (e.g., &quot;the feminine owl&quot;) or using the pronoun to refer to masculine nouns such as (&quot;helmet&quot;), or phrases such as (strong shaft), with the masculine accusative adjective ending &quot;-ne&quot;.

===Adjectives===
Single-syllable adjectives added &#x27; when modifying a noun in the plural and when used after the definite article (), after a demonstrative (, ), after a possessive pronoun (e.g., , ), or with a name or in a form of address. This derives from the Old English &quot;weak&quot; declension of adjectives. This inflexion continued to be used in writing even after final -e had ceased to be pronounced. In earlier texts, multisyllable adjectives also receive a final &quot;-e&quot; in these situations, but this occurs less regularly in later Middle English texts. Otherwise, adjectives have no ending and adjectives already ending in &#x27; etymologically receive no ending as well.

Earlier texts sometimes inflect adjectives for case as well. &quot;Layamon&#x27;s Brut&quot; inflects adjectives for the masculine accusative, genitive, and dative, the feminine dative, and the plural genitive. &quot;The Owl and the Nightingale&quot; adds a final &quot;-e&quot; to all adjectives not in the nominative, here only inflecting adjectives in the weak declension (as described above).

Comparatives and superlatives were usually formed by adding &#x27; and &#x27;. Adjectives with long vowels sometimes shortened these vowels in the comparative and superlative (e.g., , great; , greater). Adjectives ending in &#x27; or &#x27; formed comparatives either with &#x27;, &#x27; or &#x27;, &#x27;. A few adjectives also displayed Germanic umlaut in their comparatives and superlatives, such as , . Other irregular forms were mostly the same as in modern English.

===Pronouns===
Middle English personal pronouns were mostly developed from those of Old English, with the exception of the third person plural, a borrowing from Old Norse (the original Old English form clashed with the third person singular and was eventually dropped). Also, the nominative form of the feminine third person singular was replaced by a form of the demonstrative that developed into (modern &quot;she&quot;), but the alternative remained in some areas for a long time.

As with nouns, there was some inflectional simplification (the distinct Old English dual forms were lost), but pronouns, unlike nouns, retained distinct nominative and accusative forms. Third person pronouns also retained a distinction between accusative and dative forms, but that was gradually lost: The masculine was replaced by south of the River Thames by the early 14th century, and the neuter dative was ousted by &quot;it&quot; in most dialects by the 15th.

The following table shows some of the various Middle English pronouns. Many other variations are noted in Middle English sources because of differences in spellings and pronunciations at different times and in different dialects.

===Verbs===
As a general rule, the indicative first person singular of verbs in the present tense ended in &quot;-e&quot; (e.g., , &quot;I hear&quot;), the second person singular in &quot;-(e)st&quot; (e.g., , &quot;thou speakest&quot;), and the third person singular in &quot;-eþ&quot; (e.g., , &quot;he cometh/he comes&quot;). (&quot;þ&quot; (the letter &quot;thorn&quot;) is pronounced like the unvoiced &quot;th&quot; in &quot;think&quot;, but under certain circumstances, it may be like the voiced &quot;th&quot; in &quot;that&quot;). The following table illustrates a typical conjugation pattern:

Plural forms vary strongly by dialect, with Southern dialects preserving the Old English &quot;-eþ&quot;, Midland dialects showing &quot;-en&quot; from about 1200, and Northern forms using &quot;-es&quot; in the third person singular as well as the plural.

The past tense of weak verbs was formed by adding an &quot;-ed(e)&quot;, &quot;-d(e)&quot;, or &quot;-t(e)&quot; ending. The past-tense forms, without their personal endings, also served as past participles with past-participle prefixes derived from Old English: &quot;i-&quot;, &quot;y-&quot;, and sometimes &quot;bi-&quot;.

Strong verbs, by contrast, formed their past tense by changing their stem vowel (e.g., became , a process called apophony), as in Modern English.

==Orthography==

With the discontinuation of the Late West Saxon standard used for the writing of Old English in the period prior to the Norman Conquest, Middle English came to be written in a wide variety of scribal forms, reflecting different regional dialects and orthographic conventions. Later in the Middle English period, however, and particularly with the development of the Chancery Standard in the 15th century, orthography became relatively standardised in a form based on the East Midlands-influenced speech of London. Spelling at the time was mostly quite regular. (There was a fairly consistent correspondence between letters and sounds.) The irregularity of present-day English orthography is largely due to pronunciation changes that have taken place over the Early Modern English and Modern English eras.

Middle English generally did not have silent letters. For example, &quot;knight&quot; was pronounced (with both the and the pronounced, the latter sounding as the in German ). The major exception was the silent – originally pronounced but lost in normal speech by Chaucer&#x27;s time. This letter, however, came to indicate a lengthened – and later also modified – pronunciation of a preceding vowel. For example, in &quot;name&quot;, originally pronounced as two syllables, the /a/ in the first syllable (originally an open syllable) lengthened, the final weak vowel was later dropped, and the remaining long vowel was modified in the Great Vowel Shift (for these sound changes, see Phonology, above). The final , now silent, thus became the indicator of the longer and changed pronunciation of . In fact, vowels could have this lengthened and modified pronunciation in various positions, particularly before a single consonant letter and another vowel or before certain pairs of consonants.

A related convention involved the doubling of consonant letters to show that the preceding vowel was not to be lengthened. In some cases, the double consonant represented a sound that was (or had previously been) geminated (i.e., had genuinely been &quot;doubled&quot; and would thus have regularly blocked the lengthening of the preceding vowel). In other cases, by analogy, the consonant was written double merely to indicate the lack of lengthening.

===Alphabet===
The basic Old English Latin alphabet consisted of 20 standard letters plus four additional letters: ash , eth , thorn , and wynn . There was not yet a distinct &quot;j&quot;, &quot;v&quot;, or &quot;w&quot;, and Old English scribes did not generally use &quot;k&quot;, &quot;q&quot;, or &quot;z&quot;.

Ash was no longer required in Middle English, as the Old English vowel that it represented had merged into /a/. The symbol nonetheless came to be used as a ligature for the digraph in many words of Greek or Latin origin, as did for .

Eth and thorn both represented or its allophone in Old English. Eth fell out of use during the 13th century and was replaced by thorn. Thorn mostly fell out of use during the 14th century and was replaced by . Anachronistic usage of the scribal abbreviation (, &quot;the&quot;) has led to the modern mispronunciation of &quot;thorn&quot; as in this context; see &quot;ye olde&quot;.

Wynn, which represented the phoneme , was replaced by during the 13th century. Due to its similarity to the letter , it is mostly represented by in modern editions of Old and Middle English texts even when the manuscript has wynn.

Under Norman influence, the continental Carolingian minuscule replaced the insular script that had been used for Old English. However, because of the significant difference in appearance between the old insular &quot;g&quot; and the Carolingian &quot;g&quot; (modern &quot;g&quot;), the former continued in use as a separate letter, known as yogh, written . This was adopted for use to represent a variety of sounds: , while the Carolingian &quot;g&quot; was normally used for [g]. Instances of yogh were eventually replaced by or and by in words like &quot;night&quot; and &quot;laugh&quot;. In Middle Scots, yogh became indistinguishable from cursive &quot;z&quot;, and printers tended to use when &quot;yogh&quot; was not available in their fonts; this led to new spellings (often giving rise to new pronunciations), as in &quot;McKenzie&quot;, where the replaced a yogh, which had the pronunciation .

Under continental influence, the letters , , and , which had not normally been used by Old English scribes, came to be commonly used in the writing of Middle English. Also, the newer Latin letter was introduced (replacing wynn). The distinct letter forms  and  came into use but were still used interchangeably; the same applies to  and . (For example, spellings such as and for &quot;wife&quot; and &quot;paradise&quot; can be found in Middle English.)

The consonantal / was sometimes used to transliterate the Hebrew letter yodh, representing the palatal approximant sound (and transliterated in Greek by iota and in Latin by ); words like &quot;Jerusalem&quot;, &quot;Joseph&quot;, etc. would have originally followed the Latin pronunciation beginning with , that is, the sound of in &quot;yes&quot;. In some words, however, notably from Old French, / was used for the affricate consonant , as in (modern &quot;joy&quot;), used in Wycliffe&#x27;s Bible. This was similar to the geminate sound , which had been represented as in Old English. By the time of Modern English, the sound came to be written as / at the start of words (like &quot;joy&quot;), and usually as elsewhere (as in &quot;bridge&quot;). It could also be written, mainly in French loanwords, as , with the adoption of the soft G convention (&quot;age&quot;, &quot;page&quot;, etc.)

===Other symbols===
Many scribal abbreviations were also used. It was common for the Lollards to abbreviate the name of Jesus (as in Latin manuscripts) to &quot;ihc&quot;. The letters and were often omitted and indicated by a macron above an adjacent letter, so for example, &quot;in&quot; could be written as &quot;ī&quot;. A thorn with a superscript or could be used for &quot;that&quot; and &quot;the&quot;; the thorn here resembled a , giving rise to the &quot;ye&quot; of &quot;Ye Olde&quot;. Various forms of the ampersand replaced the word &quot;and&quot;.

Numbers were still always written using Roman numerals, except for some rare occurrences of Arabic numerals during the 15th century.

===Letter-to-sound correspondences===
Although Middle English spelling was never fully standardised, the following table shows the pronunciations most usually represented by particular letters and digraphs towards the end of the Middle English period, using the notation given in the article on Middle English phonology. As explained above, single vowel letters had alternative pronunciations depending on whether they were in a position where their sounds had been subject to lengthening. Long vowel pronunciations were in flux due to the beginnings of the Great Vowel Shift.

<text>Regional science is a field of economics concerned with analytical approaches to problems that are related specifically to regional and international issues. Topics in regional science include, but are not limited to location theory or spatial economics, location modeling, transportation, trade and migration flows, economic geography, land use and urban development, inter-industry analysis such as input-output analysis, environmental and ecological analysis, resource management, urban and regional policy analysis, and spatial data analysis. In the broadest sense, any social science analysis that has a spatial dimension is embraced by regional scientists.

==Origins==
Regional science was founded in the late 1940s when some economists began to become dissatisfied with the low level of regional economic analysis and felt an urge to upgrade it. But even in this early era, the founders of regional science expected to catch the interest of people from a wide variety of disciplines. Regional science&#x27;s formal roots date to the aggressive campaigns by Walter Isard and his supporters to promote the &quot;objective&quot; and &quot;scientific&quot; analysis of settlement, industrial location, and urban development. Isard targeted key universities and campaigned tirelessly. Accordingly, the Regional Science Association was founded in 1954, when the core group of scholars and practitioners held its first meetings independent from those initially held as sessions of the annual meetings of the American Economics Association. A reason for meeting independently undoubtedly was the group&#x27;s desire to extend the new science beyond the rather restrictive world of economists and have natural scientists, psychologists, anthropologists, lawyers, sociologists, political scientists, planners, and geographers join the club. Now called the Regional Science Association International (RSAI), it maintains subnational and international associations, journals, and a conference circuit (notably in North America, continental Europe, Japan, and South Korea). Membership in the RSAI continues to grow.

==Seminal publications==

Topically speaking, regional science took off in the wake of Walter Christaller&#x27;s book &quot;Die Zentralen Orte in Sűddeutschland&quot; (Verlag von Gustav Fischer, Jena, 1933; transl. &quot;Central Places in Southern Germany&quot;, 1966), soon followed by Tord Palander&#x27;s (1935) &quot;Beiträge zur Standortstheorie&quot;; August Lösch&#x27;s &quot;Die räumliche Ordnung der Wirtschaft&quot; (Verlag von Gustav Fischer, Jena, 1940; 2nd rev. edit., 1944; transl. &quot;The Economics of Location&quot;, 1954); and Edgar M. Hoover&#x27;s two books--&quot;Location Theory and the Shoe and Leather Industry&quot; (1938) and &quot;The Location of Economic Activity&quot; (1948). Other important early publications include: Edward H. Chamberlin&#x27;s (1950) &quot;The Theory of Monopolistic Competition&quot;; François Perroux&#x27;s (1950) &quot;Economic Spaces: Theory and Application&quot;; Torsten Hägerstrand&#x27;s (1953) &quot;Innovationsförloppet ur Korologisk Synpunkt&quot;; Edgar S. Dunn&#x27;s (1954)&quot;The Location of Agricultural Production&quot;; Martin J. Beckmann, C.B McGuire, and Clifford B. Winston&#x27;s (1956) &quot;Studies in the Economics of Transportation&quot;; Melvin L. Greenhut&#x27;s (1956) &quot;Plant Location in Theory and Practice&quot;; Gunnar Myrdal&#x27;s (1957) &quot;Economic Theory and Underdeveloped Regions&quot;; Albert O. Hirschman&#x27;s (1958) &quot;The Strategy of Economic Development&quot;; and Claude Ponsard&#x27;s (1958) &quot;Histoire des Théories Économiques Spatiales&quot;. Nonetheless, Walter Isard&#x27;s first book in 1956, &quot;Location and Space Economy&quot;, apparently captured the imagination of many, and his third, &quot;Methods of Regional Analysis&quot;, published in 1960, only sealed his position as the father of the field.

As is typically the case, the above works were built on the shoulders of giants. Much of this predecessor work is documented well in Walter Isard&#x27;s &quot;Location and Space Economy&quot; as well as Claude Ponsard&#x27;s &quot;Histoire des Théorie Économique Spatiales&quot;. Particularly important was the contribution by 19th century German economists to location theory. The early German hegemony more or less starts with Johann Heinrich von Thünen and runs through both Wilhelm Launhardt and Alfred Weber to Walter Christaller and August Lösch.

==Core journals==
If an academic discipline is identified by its journals, then technically regional science began in 1955 with the publication of the first volume of the &quot;Papers and Proceedings, Regional Science Association&quot; (now &quot;Papers in Regional Science&quot; published by Springer). In 1958, the &quot;Journal of Regional Science&quot; followed. Since the 1970s, the number of journals serving the field has exploded. The RSAI website displays most of them.

Most recently the journal &quot;Spatial Economic Analysis&quot; has been published by the RSAI British and Irish Section with the &quot;Regional Studies Association&quot;. The latter is a separate and growing organisation involving economists, planners, geographers, political scientists, management academics, policymakers, and practitioners.

==Academic programs==

Walter Isard&#x27;s efforts culminated in the creation of a few academic departments and several university-wide programs in regional science. At Walter Isard&#x27;s suggestion, the University of Pennsylvania started the Regional Science Department in 1956. It featured as its first graduate William Alonso and was looked upon by many to be the international academic leader for the field. Another important graduate and faculty member of the department is Masahisa Fujita. The core curriculum of this department was microeconomics, input-output analysis, location theory, and statistics. Faculty also taught courses in mathematical programming, transportation economics, labor economics, energy and ecological policy modeling, spatial statistics, spatial interaction theory and models, benefit/cost analysis, urban and regional analysis, and economic development theory, among others. But the department&#x27;s unusual multidisciplinary orientation undoubtedly encouraged its demise, and it lost its department status in 1993.

With a few exceptions, such as Cornell University which awards graduate degrees in Regional Science and where Walter Isard had spent the rest of his life after UPENN, most practitioners hold positions in departments such as economics, geography, civil engineering, agricultural economics, rural sociology, urban planning, public policy, or demography. The diversity of disciplines participating in regional science have helped make it one of the most interesting and fruitful fields of academic specialization, but it has also made it difficult to fit the many perspectives into a curriculum for an academic major. It is even difficult for authors to write regional science textbooks, since what is elementary knowledge for one discipline might be entirely novel for another.

==Public policy impact==
Part of the movement was, and continues to be, associated with the political and economic realities of the role of the local community. On any occasion where public policy is directed at the sub-national level, such as a city or group of counties, the methods of regional science can prove useful. Traditionally, regional science has provided policymakers with guidance on the following issues:
:*Determinants of industrial location (both within the nation and region)
:*Regional economic impact of the arrival or departure of a firm
:*Determinants and patterns of intra-national and inter-national trade(commodity) and migration(people) flows
:*Regional specialization and exchange
:*Environmental impacts of social and economic change
:*Geographic association of economic and social conditions

By targeting federal resources to specific geographic areas the Kennedy administration realized that political favors could be bought. This is also evident in Europe and other places where local economic areas do not coincide with political boundaries. In the more current era of devolution knowledge about &quot;local solutions to local problems&quot; has driven much of the interest in regional science. Thus, there has been much political impetus to the growth of the discipline.

==Developments after 1980==
Regional science has enjoyed mixed fortunes since the 1980s. While it has gained a larger following among economists and public policy practitioners, the discipline has fallen out of favor among more radical and post-modernist geographers. In an apparent effort to secure a larger share of research funds, geographers had the National Science Foundation&#x27;s Geography and Regional Science Program renamed &quot;Geography and Spatial Sciences&quot;.

===New economic geography===
In 1991, Paul Krugman, as a highly regarded international trade theorist, put out a call for economists to pay more attention to economic geography in a book entitled &quot;Geography and Trade&quot;, focusing largely on the core regional science concept of agglomeration economies. Krugman&#x27;s call renewed interest by economists in regional science and, perhaps more importantly, founded what some term the &quot;new economic geography&quot;, which enjoys much common ground with regional science. Broadly trained &quot;new economic geographers&quot; combine quantitative work with other research techniques, for example at the London School of Economics. The unification of Europe and the increased internationalization of the world&#x27;s economic, social, and political realms has further induced interest in the study of regional, as opposed to national, phenomena. The new economic geography appears to have garnered more interest in Europe than in America where amenities, notably climate, have been found to better predict human location and re-location patterns, as emphasized in recent work by Mark Partridge. In 2008 Krugman won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences and his Prize Lecture has references both to work in regional science&#x27;s location theory as well as economic&#x27;s trade theory.

===Criticisms===
Today there are dwindling numbers of regional scientists from academic planning programs and mainstream geography departments. Attacks on regional science&#x27;s practitioners by radical critics began as early as the 1970s, notably David Harvey who believed it lacked social and political commitment. Regional science&#x27;s founder, Walter Isard, never envisioned regional scientists would be political or planning activists. In fact, he suggested that they will seek to be sitting in front of a computer and surrounded by research assistants. Trevor J. Barnes suggests the decline of regional science practice among planners and geographers in North America could have been avoided. He says &quot;It is unreflective, and consequently inured to change, because of a commitment to a God’s eye view. It is so convinced of its own rightness, of its Archimedean position, that it remained aloof and invariant, rather than being sensitive to its changing local context.&quot;
However, such critics have failed to provide empirical evidence for their claims and ended up criticizing for the sake of criticizing.

<text>The Zygnematales ( (&quot;zygós&quot;) and νῆμα (&quot;nḗma&quot;) (nom.), νήματος (&quot;nḗmatos&quot;) (gen.)), also called the Conjugatales, are an order of green algae, comprising several thousand different species in two families. The larger family Zygnemataceae, with well-known genera such as &quot;Zygnema&quot; and &quot;Spirogyra&quot;, includes members that grow as unbranched filaments, which grow longer through normal cell division. This group includes the desmids. Most members of both families live in freshwater, and form an important component of the algal scum that grows on or near plants and rocks.

Systematically they fall within the division Charophyta/Streptophyta, in which the land plants (Embryophyta) emerged.

Sexual reproduction in Zygnematales takes place through a process called &quot;conjugation&quot;. Here filaments of opposite gender line up, and tubes form between corresponding cells. The male cells then become amoeboid and crawl across, or sometimes both cells crawl into the tube. The cells then meet and fuse to form a zygote, which later undergoes meiosis to produce new filaments. As in plants, only the female passes chloroplasts on to the offspring.

Other conjugating algae are the Mesotaeniaceae, sister of the Zygnematales, and &quot;Spirotaenia&quot;, a basal green algae. Additionally, the Desmidiales appear to have emerged deep within the Zygnematales, and are also conjugating.

<text>Harry Sinclair Lewis (February 7, 1885 – January 10, 1951) was an American novelist, short-story writer, and playwright. In 1930, he became the first author from the United States (and the first from the Americas) to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature, which was awarded &quot;for his vigorous and graphic art of description and his ability to create, with wit and humor, new types of characters.&quot; Lewis wrote six popular novels: &quot;Main Street&quot; (1920), &quot;Babbitt&quot; (1922), &quot;Arrowsmith&quot; (1925), &quot;Elmer Gantry&quot; (1927), &quot;Dodsworth&quot; (1929), and &quot;It Can&#x27;t Happen Here&quot; (1935).

Several of his notable works were critical of American capitalism and materialism during the interwar period. Lewis is respected for his strong characterizations of modern working women. H. L. Mencken wrote of him, &quot;[If] there was ever a novelist among us with an authentic call to the trade ... it is this red-haired tornado from the Minnesota wilds.&quot;

==Early life==
Lewis was born February 7, 1885, in the village of Sauk Centre, Minnesota, to Edwin J. Lewis, a physician of Welsh descent, and Emma Kermott Lewis. He had two older siblings, Fred (born 1875) and Claude (born 1878). His father was a stern disciplinarian, who had difficulty relating to his sensitive, unathletic third son. Lewis&#x27;s mother died in 1891. The next year Edwin married Isabel Warner, who young Lewis apparently liked. Lewis began reading books while young, and kept a diary. Throughout his lonely boyhood, the ungainly child—tall, extremely thin, stricken with acne and somewhat pop-eyed—had trouble making friends and pined after local girls. At the age of 13, he ran away from home and unsuccessfully tried to become a drummer boy in the Spanish–American War. In late 1902, Lewis left home for a year at Oberlin Academy (the then-preparatory department of Oberlin College) to qualify for acceptance at Yale University. While at Oberlin, he developed a religious enthusiasm that waxed and waned for much of his remaining teenage years. Lewis later became an atheist. He entered Yale in 1903, but did not receive his bachelor&#x27;s degree until 1908, taking time off to work at Helicon Home Colony, Upton Sinclair&#x27;s cooperative-living colony in Englewood, New Jersey, and to travel to Panama. Lewis&#x27;s undistinguished looks, country manners and seeming self-importance made it difficult for him to win and keep friends at Oberlin and Yale. He did make a few friends among the students and professors, some of whom recognized his promise as a writer.

==Career==
Lewis&#x27;s earliest published creative work—romantic poetry and short sketches—appeared in the &quot;Yale Courant&quot; and the &quot;Yale Literary Magazine&quot;, of which he became an editor. After graduation Lewis moved from job to job and from place to place in an effort to make ends meet, writing fiction for publication and to chase away boredom. In the summer of 1908, Lewis worked as an editorial writer at a newspaper in Waterloo, Iowa. He moved to the Carmel-by-the-Sea writers&#x27; colony near Monterey, California, in September 1908, to work for the MacGowan sisters and to meet poet George Sterling in person. He left Carmel after six months, moving to San Francisco where Sterling helped him get a job at the &quot;San Francisco Evening Bulletin.&quot; Lewis returned to Carmel in spring 1910 and met Jack London.

While working for newspapers and publishing houses he developed a facility for turning out shallow, popular stories that were purchased by a variety of magazines. He also earned money by selling plots to London, including one for the latter&#x27;s unfinished novel &quot;The Assassination Bureau, Ltd&quot;.

Lewis&#x27;s first published book was &quot;Hike and the Aeroplane&quot;, a Tom Swift-style potboiler that appeared in 1912 under the pseudonym Tom Graham.

Sinclair Lewis&#x27;s first serious novel, &quot;Our Mr. Wrenn: The Romantic Adventures of a Gentle Man&quot;, appeared in 1914, followed by &quot;The Trail of the Hawk: A Comedy of the Seriousness of Life&quot; (1915) and &quot;The Job&quot; (1917). That same year also saw the publication of another potboiler, &quot;The Innocents: A Story for Lovers&quot;, an expanded version of a serial story that had originally appeared in &quot;Woman&#x27;s Home Companion&quot;. &quot;Free Air&quot;, another refurbished serial story, was published in 1919.

===Commercial success===
Upon moving to Washington, D.C., Lewis devoted himself to writing. As early as 1916, he began taking notes for a realistic novel about small-town life. Work on that novel continued through mid-1920, when he completed &quot;Main Street&quot;, which was published on October 23, 1920. His biographer Mark Schorer wrote in 1961 that the phenomenal success of &quot;Main Street&quot; &quot;was the most sensational event in twentieth-century American publishing history&quot;. Lewis&#x27;s agent had the most optimistic projection of sales at 25,000 copies. In its first six months, &quot;Main Street&quot; sold 180,000 copies, and within a few years, sales were estimated at two million. Richard Lingeman wrote in 2002, &quot;&quot;Main Street&quot; made [Lewis] rich—earning him about 3 million current dollars&quot; (almost $5 million, as of 2022).
Lewis followed up this first great success with &quot;Babbitt&quot; (1922), a novel that satirized the American commercial culture and boosterism. The story was set in the fictional Midwestern town of Zenith, Winnemac, a setting to which Lewis returned in future novels, including &quot;Arrowsmith, Elmer Gantry&quot;, &quot;Gideon Planish&quot; and &quot;Dodsworth&quot;.

Lewis continued his success in the 1920s with &quot;Arrowsmith&quot; (1925), a novel about the challenges faced by an idealistic doctor. It was awarded the Pulitzer Prize, which Lewis declined, still upset that &quot;Main Street&quot; had not won the prize. It was adapted as a 1931 Hollywood film directed by John Ford and starring Ronald Colman which was nominated for four Academy Awards.

Next Lewis published &quot;Elmer Gantry&quot; (1927), which depicted an evangelical minister as deeply hypocritical. The novel was denounced by many religious leaders and banned in some U.S. cities. It was adapted for the screen more than a generation later as the basis of the 1960 movie starring Burt Lancaster, who earned a Best Actor Oscar for his performance in the title role. The film won two more awards as well.

Lewis next published &quot;Dodsworth&quot; (1929), a novel about the most affluent and successful members of American society. He portrayed them as leading essentially pointless lives in spite of great wealth and advantages. The book was adapted for the Broadway stage in 1934 by Sidney Howard, who also wrote the screenplay for the 1936 film version directed by William Wyler, which was a great success at the time. The film is still highly regarded; in 1990, it was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry, and in 2005 &quot;Time&quot; magazine named it one of the &quot;100 Best Movies&quot; of the past 80 years.

During the late 1920s and 1930s, Lewis wrote many short stories for a variety of magazines and publications. &quot;Little Bear Bongo&quot; (1930) is a tale about a bear cub who wants to escape the circus in search of a better life in the real world, first published in &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; magazine. The story was acquired by Walt Disney Pictures in 1940 for a possible feature film. World War II sidetracked those plans until 1947. Disney used the story (now titled &quot;Bongo&quot;) as part of its feature &quot;Fun and Fancy Free&quot;.

===Nobel Prize===
In 1930 Lewis won the Nobel Prize in Literature, the first writer from the United States to receive the award, after he had been nominated by Henrik Schück, member of the Swedish Academy. In the academy&#x27;s presentation speech, special attention was paid to &quot;Babbitt&quot;. In his Nobel Lecture, Lewis praised Theodore Dreiser, Willa Cather, Ernest Hemingway, and other contemporaries, but also lamented that &quot;in America most of us—not readers alone, but even writers—are still afraid of any literature which is not a glorification of everything American, a glorification of our faults as well as our virtues,&quot; and that America is &quot;the most contradictory, the most depressing, the most stirring, of any land in the world today.&quot; He also offered a profound criticism of the American literary establishment: &quot;Our American professors like their literature clear and cold and pure and very dead.&quot;

==Later years==
 
After winning the Nobel Prize, Lewis wrote eleven more novels, ten of which appeared in his lifetime. The best remembered is &quot;It Can&#x27;t Happen Here&quot; (1935), a novel about the election of a fascist to the American presidency.

After praising Dreiser as &quot;pioneering&quot;, that he &quot;more than any other man, marching alone, usually unappreciated, often hated, has cleared the trail from Victorian and Howellsian timidity and gentility in American fiction to honesty and boldness and passion of life&quot; in his Nobel Lecture in December 1930, in March 1931 Lewis publicly accused Dreiser of plagiarizing a book by Dorothy Thompson, Lewis&#x27;s wife, which led to a well-publicized fight, wherein Dreiser repeatedly slapped Lewis. Thompson initially made the accusation in 1928 regarding her work &quot;The New Russia&quot; and Dreiser&#x27;s &quot;Dreiser Goes to Russia&quot;, though &quot;The New York Times&quot; also linked the dispute to competition between Dreiser and Lewis over the Nobel Prize. Dreiser fired back that Sinclair&#x27;s 1925 novel &quot;Arrowsmith&quot; (adapted later that year as a feature film) was unoriginal and that Dreiser himself was first approached to write it, which was disputed by the wife of &quot;Arrowsmith&quot;&#x27;s subject, microbiologist Dr. Paul de Kruif. The feud carried on for some months. In 1944, Lewis campaigned to have Dreiser recognized by the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

After an alcoholic binge in 1937, Lewis checked in for treatment to the Austen Riggs Center, a psychiatric hospital in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. His doctors gave him a blunt assessment that he needed to decide &quot;whether he was going to live without alcohol or die by it, one or the other.&quot; Lewis checked out after ten days, lacking any &quot;fundamental understanding of his problem&quot;, as one of his physicians wrote to a colleague.

In the autumn of 1940, Lewis visited his old acquaintance, William Ellery Leonard, in Madison, Wisconsin. Leonard arranged a meeting with the chancellor of the University of Wisconsin–Madison and a tour of the campus. Lewis immediately became enthralled with the university and the city and offered to remain and teach a course in creative writing in the upcoming semester. For a month he was quite enamored of his professorial role. Suddenly, on November 7, after giving only five classes to his select group of 24 students, he announced that he had taught them all that he knew. He left Madison the next day.

In the 1940s, Lewis and rabbi-turned-popular-author Lewis Browne frequently appeared on the lecture platform together, touring the United States and debating before audiences of as many as 3,000 people, addressing such questions as &quot;Has the Modern Woman Made Good?&quot;, &quot;The Country Versus the City&quot;, &quot;Is the Machine Age Wrecking Civilization?&quot;, and &quot;Can Fascism Happen Here?&quot;. The pair were described as &quot;the Gallagher and Shean of the lecture circuit&quot; by Lewis biographer Richard Lingeman.

In the early 1940s, Lewis lived in Duluth, Minnesota. During this time, he wrote the novel &quot;Kingsblood Royal&quot; (1947), set in the fictional city of Grand Republic, Minnesota, an enlarged and updated version of Zenith. It is based on the Sweet Trials in Detroit in which an African-American doctor was denied the chance to purchase a house in a &quot;white&quot; section of the city. Lewis&#x27; creation of the novel was preceded by his introduction to the black community via Edward Francis Murphy, a Josephite priest with whom he had attended school as a child. &quot;Kingsblood&quot; was a powerful and very early contribution to the civil rights movement.

In 1943, Lewis went to Hollywood to work on a script with Dore Schary, who had just resigned as executive head of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&#x27;s low-budget film department to concentrate on writing and producing his own films. The resulting screenplay was &quot;Storm In the West&quot;, &quot;a traditional American western&quot; — except for the fact that it was also an allegory of World War II, with primary villain Hygatt (Hitler) and his henchmen Gribbles (Goebbels) and Gerrett (Goering) plotting to take over the Franson Ranch, the Poling Ranch, and so on. The screenplay was deemed too political by MGM studio executives and was shelved, and the film was never made. &quot;Storm In the West&quot; was finally published in 1963, with a foreword by Schary detailing the work&#x27;s origins, the authors&#x27; creative process, and the screenplay&#x27;s ultimate fate.

Sinclair Lewis had been a frequent visitor to Williamstown, Massachusetts. In 1946, he rented Thorvale Farm on Oblong Road. While working on his novel &quot;Kingsblood Royal&quot;, he purchased this summer estate and upgraded the Georgian mansion along with a farmhouse and many outbuildings. By 1948, Lewis had created a gentleman&#x27;s farm consisting of of agricultural and forest land. His intended residence in Williamstown was short-lived because of his medical problems.

==Personal life==

In 1914 Lewis married Grace Livingston Hegger (1887–1981), an editor at &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine. They had one son, Wells Lewis (1917–1944), named after British author H. G. Wells. Serving as a U.S. Army lieutenant during World War II, Wells Lewis was killed in action on October 29, 1944 amid Allied efforts to rescue the &quot;Lost Battalion&quot; in France. Dean Acheson, the future Secretary of State, was a neighbor and family friend in Washington, and observed that Sinclair&#x27;s literary &quot;success was not good for that marriage, or for either of the parties to it, or for Lewis&#x27;s work&quot; and the family moved out of town.

Lewis divorced Grace on April 16, 1928. On May 14, he married Dorothy Thompson, a political newspaper columnist. Later in 1928, he and Dorothy purchased a second home in rural Vermont. They had a son, Michael Lewis (1930–1975), who became a stage actor. Their marriage had virtually ended by 1937, and they divorced in 1942.

Lewis died in Rome from advanced alcoholism, on January 10, 1951, aged 65. His body was cremated and his remains were buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Sauk Centre, Minnesota. His final novel &quot;World So Wide&quot; (1951) was published posthumously.

William Shirer, a friend and admirer of Lewis, argued that Lewis did not die from alcoholism. He reported that Lewis had a heart attack and that his doctors advised him to stop drinking if he wanted to live. Lewis did not stop, and perhaps could not; he died when his heart stopped.

In summarizing Lewis&#x27;s career, Shirer stated:
==Legacy==
Compared to his contemporaries, Lewis&#x27;s reputation suffered a precipitous decline among literary scholars throughout the 20th century. Despite his enormous popularity during the 1920s, by the 21st century most of his works had been eclipsed in prominence by other writers with less commercial success during the same time period, such as F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway.

Since the 2010s there has been renewed interest in Lewis&#x27;s work, in particular his 1935 dystopian satire &quot;It Can&#x27;t Happen Here&quot;. In the aftermath of the 2016 United States presidential election, &quot;It Can&#x27;t Happen Here&quot; surged to the top of Amazon&#x27;s list of best-selling books. Scholars have found parallels in his novels to the COVID-19 crisis, and to the rise of Donald Trump.

He has been honored by the U.S. Postal Service with a postage stamp in the Great Americans series. In 1960 Polish American sculptor Joseph Kiselewski was commissioned to create a bust of Lewis, now in the Great River Regional public library in Sauk Centre, MN.

<text>Piracy is an act of robbery or criminal violence by ship or boat-borne attackers upon another ship or a coastal area, typically with the goal of stealing cargo and other valuable goods. Those who conduct acts of piracy are called pirates, and vessels used for piracy are called pirate ships. The earliest documented instances of piracy were in the 14th century BC, when the Sea Peoples, a group of ocean raiders, attacked the ships of the Aegean and Mediterranean civilisations. Narrow channels which funnel shipping into predictable routes have long created opportunities for piracy, as well as for privateering and commerce raiding.

Historic examples of such areas include the waters of Gibraltar, the Strait of Malacca, Madagascar, the Gulf of Aden, and the English Channel, whose geographic structures facilitated pirate attacks. The term &quot;piracy&quot; generally refers to maritime piracy, although the term has been generalized to refer to acts committed on land, in the air, on computer networks, and (in science fiction) outer space. Piracy usually excludes crimes committed by the perpetrator on their own vessel (e.g. theft), as well as privateering, which implies authorization by a state government.

Piracy or pirating is the name of a specific crime under customary international law and also the name of a number of crimes under the municipal law of a number of states. In the 21st century, seaborne piracy against transport vessels remains a significant issue, with estimated worldwide losses of US$25 billion in 2023, increased from US$16 billion in 2004.

The waters between the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean, off the Somali coast and in the Strait of Malacca and Singapore have frequently been targeted by modern pirates armed with automatic weapons, such as assault rifles, and machine guns, grenades and rocket propelled grenades. They often use small motorboats to attack and board ships, a tactic that takes advantage of the small number of crew members on modern cargo vessels and transport ships. The international community is facing many challenges in bringing modern pirates to justice, as these attacks often occur in international waters. Nations have used their naval forces to repel and pursue pirates, and some private vessels use armed security guards, high-pressure water cannons, or sound cannons to repel boarders, and use radar to avoid potential threats.

Romanticised accounts of piracy during the Age of Sail have long been a part of Western pop culture. The two-volume &quot;A General History of the Pyrates&quot;, published in London in 1724, is generally credited with bringing key piratical figures and a semi-accurate description of their milieu in the &quot;Golden Age of Piracy&quot; to the public&#x27;s imagination. The &quot;General History&quot; inspired and informed many later fictional depictions of piracy, most notably the novels &quot;Treasure Island&quot; (1883) and &quot;Peter Pan&quot; (1911), both of which have been adapted and readapted for stage, film, television, and other media across over a century. More recently, pirates of the &quot;golden age&quot; were further stereotyped and popularized by the &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; film franchise, which began in 2003.

==Etymology==
The English word &quot;pirate&quot; is derived from the Latin &quot;pirata&quot; (&quot;pirate, corsair, sea robber&quot;), which comes from Greek πειρατής (&quot;peiratēs&quot;), &quot;brigand&quot;, from πειράομαι (peiráomai), &quot;I attempt&quot;, from πεῖρα (&quot;peîra&quot;), &quot;attempt, experience&quot;. The meaning of the Greek word &quot;peiratēs&quot; literally is &quot;anyone who attempts something&quot;. Over time it came to be used of anyone who engaged in robbery or brigandry on land or sea. The term first appeared in English 1300. Spelling did not become standardised until the eighteenth century, and spellings such as &quot;pirrot&quot;, &quot;pyrate&quot; and &quot;pyrat&quot; occurred until this period.

==History==
===Europe===

====Antiquity====

The earliest documented instances of piracy are the exploits of the Sea Peoples who threatened the ships sailing in the Aegean and Mediterranean waters in the 14th century BC. In classical antiquity, the Phoenicians, Illyrians and Tyrrhenians were known as pirates. In the pre-classical era, the ancient Greeks condoned piracy as a viable profession; it apparently was widespread and &quot;regarded as an entirely honourable way of making a living&quot;. References are made to its perfectly normal occurrence in many texts including in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot;, and abduction of women and children to be sold into slavery was common. By the era of Classical Greece, piracy was looked upon as a &quot;disgrace&quot; to have as a profession.

In the 3rd century BC, pirate attacks on Olympus in Lycia brought impoverishment. Among some of the most famous ancient pirateering peoples were the Illyrians, a people populating the western Balkan peninsula. Constantly raiding the Adriatic Sea, the Illyrians caused many conflicts with the Roman Republic. It was not until 229 BC when the Romans decisively beat the Illyrian fleets that their threat was ended. During the 1st century BC, there were pirate states along the Anatolian coast, threatening the commerce of the Roman Empire in the eastern Mediterranean. On one voyage across the Aegean Sea in 75 BC, Julius Caesar was kidnapped and briefly held by Cilician pirates and held prisoner in the Dodecanese islet of Pharmacusa. The Senate invested the general Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus with powers to deal with piracy in 67 BC (the &quot;Lex Gabinia&quot;), and Pompey, after three months of naval warfare, managed to suppress the threat.

As early as 258 AD, the Gothic-Herulic fleet ravaged towns on the coasts of the Black Sea and Sea of Marmara. The Aegean coast suffered similar attacks a few years later. In 264, the Goths reached Galatia and Cappadocia, and Gothic pirates landed on Cyprus and Crete. In the process, the Goths seized enormous booty and took thousands into captivity. In 286 AD, Carausius, a Roman military commander of Gaulish origins, was appointed to command the &quot;Classis Britannica&quot;, and given the responsibility of eliminating Frankish and Saxon pirates who had been raiding the coasts of Armorica and Belgic Gaul. In the Roman province of Britannia, Saint Patrick was captured and enslaved by Irish pirates.

====Middle Ages====
The most widely recognized and far-reaching pirates in medieval Europe were the Vikings, seaborne warriors from Scandinavia who raided and looted mainly between the 8th and 12th centuries, during the Viking Age in the Early Middle Ages. They raided the coasts, rivers and inland cities of all Western Europe as far as Seville, which was attacked by the Norse in 844. Vikings also attacked the coasts of North Africa and Italy and plundered all the coasts of the Baltic Sea. Some Vikings ascended the rivers of Eastern Europe as far as the Black Sea and Persia.

In the Late Middle Ages, the Frisian pirates known as Arumer Zwarte Hoop led by Pier Gerlofs Donia and Wijerd Jelckama, fought against the troops of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V with some success.

Toward the end of the 9th century, Moorish pirate havens were established along the coast of southern France and northern Italy. In 846 Moor raiders sacked the &quot;extra muros&quot; Basilicas of Saint Peter and Saint Paul in Rome. In 911, the bishop of Narbonne was unable to return to France from Rome because the Moors from Fraxinet controlled all the passes in the Alps. Moor pirates operated out of the Balearic Islands in the 10th century. From 824 to 961 Arab pirates in the Emirate of Crete raided the entire Mediterranean. In the 14th century, raids by Moor pirates forced the Venetian Duke of Crete to ask Venice to keep its fleet on constant guard.

After the Slavic invasions of the former Roman province of Dalmatia in the 5th and 6th centuries, a tribe called the Narentines revived the old Illyrian piratical habits and often raided the Adriatic Sea starting in the 7th century. Their raids in the Adriatic increased rapidly, until the whole Sea was no longer safe for travel.

The Narentines took more liberties in their raiding quests while the Venetian Navy was abroad, as when it was campaigning in Sicilian waters in 827–882. As soon as the Venetian fleet would return to the Adriatic, the Narentines momentarily outcast their habits again, even signing a Treaty in Venice and baptising their Slavic pagan leader into Christianity. In 834 or 835 they broke the treaty and again they raided Venetian traders returning from Benevento. All of Venice&#x27;s military attempts to punish them in 839 and 840 utterly failed.

Later, they raided the Venetians more often, together with the Arabs. In 846, the Narentines broke through to Venice itself and raided its lagoon city of Caorle. This caused a Byzantine military action against them that brought Christianity to them. After the Arab raids on the Adriatic coast circa 872 and the retreat of the Imperial Navy, the Narentines continued their raids of Venetian waters, causing new conflicts with the Italians in 887–888. The Venetians futilely continued to fight them throughout the 10th and 11th centuries.

Domagoj was accused of attacking a ship which was bringing home the papal legates who had participated in the Eighth Catholic Ecumenical Council, after which Pope John VIII addresses to Domagoj with request that his pirates stop attacking Christians at sea.
In 937, Irish pirates sided with the Scots, Vikings, Picts, and Welsh in their invasion of England. Athelstan drove them back.

The Slavic piracy in the Baltic Sea ended with the Danish conquest of the Rani stronghold of Arkona in 1168. In the 12th century the coasts of western Scandinavia were plundered by Curonians and Oeselians from the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea. In the 13th and 14th century, pirates threatened the Hanseatic routes and nearly brought sea trade to the brink of extinction. The Victual Brothers of Gotland were a companionship of privateers who later turned to piracy as the Likedeelers. They were especially noted for their leaders Klaus Störtebeker and Gödeke Michels. Until about 1440, maritime trade in both the North Sea, the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Bothnia was seriously in danger of attack by the pirates.

H. Thomas Milhorn mentions a certain Englishman named William Maurice, convicted of piracy in 1241, as the first person known to have been hanged, drawn and quartered, which would indicate that the then-ruling King Henry III took an especially severe view of this crime.

The ushkuiniks were Novgorodian pirates who looted the cities on the Volga and Kama Rivers in the 14th century.
As early as Byzantine times, the Maniots (one of Greece&#x27;s toughest populations) were known as pirates. The Maniots considered piracy as a legitimate response to the fact that their land was poor and it became their main source of income. The main victims of Maniot pirates were the Ottomans but the Maniots also targeted ships of European countries.

Zaporizhian Sich was a pirate republic in Europe from the 16th through to the 18th century. Situated in Cossack territory in the remote steppe of Eastern Europe, it was populated with Ukrainian peasants that had run away from their feudal masters, outlaws, destitute gentry, run-away slaves from Turkish galleys, etc. The remoteness of the place and the rapids at the Dnieper river effectively guarded the place from invasions of vengeful powers.

The main target of the inhabitants of the Zaporizhian Sich who called themselves &quot;Cossacks&quot;, were rich settlements at the Black Sea shores of Ottoman Empire and Crimean Khanate. By 1615 and 1625, Zaporozhian Cossacks had even managed to raze townships on the outskirts of Istanbul, forcing the Ottoman Sultan to flee his palace. Don Cossacks under Stenka Razin even ravaged the Persian coasts.

====Mediterranean corsairs====

Though less famous and romanticized than Atlantic or Caribbean pirates, corsairs in the Mediterranean equaled or outnumbered the former at any given point in history. Mediterranean piracy was conducted almost entirely with galleys until the mid-17th century, when they were gradually replaced with highly maneuverable sailing vessels such as xebecs and brigantines. They were of a smaller type than battle galleys, often referred to as galiots or fustas.

Pirate galleys were small, nimble, lightly armed, but often crewed in large numbers in order to overwhelm the often minimal crews of merchant ships. In general, pirate craft were extremely difficult for patrolling craft to actually hunt down and capture. Anne Hilarion de Tourville, a French admiral of the 17th century, believed that the only way to run down raiders from the infamous corsair Moroccan port of Salé was by using a captured pirate vessel of the same type.

Using oared vessels to combat pirates was common, and was even practiced by the major powers in the Caribbean. Purpose-built galleys, or hybrid sailing vessels, were built by the English in Jamaica in 1683 and by the Spanish in the late 16th century. Specially-built sailing frigates with oar-ports on the lower decks, like the &quot;James Galley&quot; and &quot;Charles Galley&quot;, and oar-equipped sloops proved highly useful for pirate hunting, though they were not built in sufficient numbers to check piracy until the 1720s.

The expansion of Muslim power through the Ottoman conquest of large parts of the eastern Mediterranean in the 15th and 16th century resulted in extensive piracy on sea trading. The so-called Barbary pirates began to operate out of North African ports in Algiers, Tunis, Tripoli, Morocco around 1500, preying primarily on the shipping of Christian powers, including massive slave raids at sea as well as on land. The Barbary pirates were nominally under Ottoman suzerainty, but had considerable independence to prey on the enemies of Islam. The Muslim corsairs were technically often privateers with support from legitimate, though highly belligerent, states. They considered themselves as holy Muslim warriors, or ghazis, carrying on the tradition of fighting the incursion of Western Christians that had begun with the First Crusade late in the 11th century.

Coastal villages and towns of Italy, Spain and islands in the Mediterranean were frequently attacked by Muslim corsairs, and long stretches of the Italian and Spanish coasts were almost completely abandoned by their inhabitants. After 1600, the Barbary corsairs occasionally entered the Atlantic and struck as far north as Iceland. According to Robert Davis between 1 million and 1.25 million Europeans were captured by Barbary corsairs and sold as slaves in North Africa and the Ottoman Empire between the 16th and 19th centuries. The most famous corsairs were the Ottoman Albanian Hayreddin and his older brother Oruç Reis (Redbeard), Turgut Reis (known as Dragut in the West), Kurtoglu (known as Curtogoli in the West), Kemal Reis, Salih Reis and Koca Murat Reis. A few Barbary corsairs, such as the Dutch Jan Janszoon and the English John Ward (Muslim name Yusuf Reis), were renegade European privateers who had converted to Islam.

The Barbary pirates had a direct Christian counterpart in the military order of the Knights of Saint John that operated first out of Rhodes and after 1530 Malta, though they were less numerous and took fewer slaves. Both sides waged war against the respective enemies of their faith, and both used galleys as their primary weapons. Both sides also used captured or bought galley slaves to man the oars of their ships. The Muslims relied mostly on captured Christians, the Christians used a mix of Muslim slaves, Christian convicts and a small contingency of &quot;buonavoglie&quot;, free men who out of desperation or poverty had taken to rowing.

Historian Peter Earle has described the two sides of the Christian-Muslim Mediterranean conflict as &quot;mirror image[s] of maritime predation, two businesslike fleets of plunderers set against each other&quot;. This conflict of faith in the form of privateering, piracy and slave raiding generated a complex system that was upheld/financed/operated on the trade in plunder and slaves that was generated from a low-intensive conflict, as well as the need for protection from violence. The system has been described as a &quot;massive, multinational protection racket&quot;, the Christian side of which was not ended until 1798 in the Napoleonic Wars. The Barbary corsairs were quelled as late as the 1830s, effectively ending the last vestiges of counter-crusading jihad.
Piracy off the Barbary coast was often assisted by competition among European powers in the 17th century. France encouraged the corsairs against Spain, and later Britain and Holland supported them against France. By the second half of the 17th century the greater European naval powers began to initiate reprisals to intimidate the Barbary States into making peace with them. The most successful of the Christian states in dealing with the corsair threat was England. From the 1630s onwards England had signed peace treaties with the Barbary States on various occasions, but invariably breaches of these agreements led to renewed wars.

Albanian piracy, mainly centered in the town of Ulcinj (thus came to be known as &quot;Dulcignotti&quot;), flourished during the 15th to the 19th century.

France, which had recently emerged as a leading naval power, achieved comparable success soon afterwards, with bombardments of Algiers in 1682, 1683 and 1688 securing a lasting peace, while Tripoli was similarly coerced in 1686. In 1783 and 1784 the Spaniards bombarded Algiers in an effort to stem the piracy. The second time, Admiral Barceló damaged the city so severely that the Algerian Dey asked Spain to negotiate a peace treaty. From then on, Spanish vessels and coasts were safe for several years.

Until the American Declaration of Independence in 1776, British treaties with the North African states protected American ships from the Barbary corsairs. Morocco, which in 1777 was the first independent nation to publicly recognize the United States, became in 1784 the first Barbary power to seize an American vessel after independence. While the United States managed to secure peace treaties, these obliged it to pay tribute for protection from attack. Payments in ransom and tribute to the Barbary states amounted to 20% of United States government annual expenditures in 1800, leading to the Barbary Wars that ended the payment of tribute. Algiers broke the 1805 peace treaty after only two years, and refused to implement the 1815 treaty until compelled to do so by Britain in 1816.

In 1815, the sacking of Palma on the island of Sardinia by a Tunisian squadron, which carried off 158 inhabitants, roused widespread indignation. Britain had by this time banned the slave trade and was seeking to induce other countries to do likewise. This led to complaints from states which were still vulnerable to the corsairs that Britain&#x27;s enthusiasm for ending the trade in African slaves did not extend to stopping the enslavement of Europeans and Americans by the Barbary States.
In order to neutralise this objection and further the anti-slavery campaign, in 1816 Lord Exmouth was sent to secure new concessions from Tripoli, Tunis, and Algiers, including a pledge to treat Christian captives in any future conflict as prisoners of war rather than slaves and the imposition of peace between Algiers and the kingdoms of Sardinia and Sicily. On his first visit he negotiated satisfactory treaties and sailed for home. While he was negotiating, a number of Sardinian fishermen who had settled at Bona on the Tunisian coast were brutally treated without his knowledge. As Sardinians they were technically under British protection and the government sent Exmouth back to secure reparation. On August 17, in combination with a Dutch squadron under Admiral Van de Capellen, he bombarded Algiers. Both Algiers and Tunis made fresh concessions as a result.

Securing uniform compliance with a total prohibition of slave-raiding, which was traditionally of central importance to the North African economy, presented difficulties beyond those faced in ending attacks on ships of individual nations, which had left slavers able to continue their accustomed way of life by preying on less well-protected peoples. Algiers renewed its slave-raiding, though on a smaller scale. Measures to be taken against the city&#x27;s government were discussed at the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1818. In 1820, another British fleet under Admiral Sir Harry Neal again bombarded Algiers. Corsair activity based in Algiers did not entirely cease until its conquest by France in 1830.

===Southeast Asia===
In thalassocratic Austronesian cultures in Island Southeast Asia, maritime raids for slaves and resources against rival polities have ancient origins. It was associated with prestige and prowess and often recorded in tattoos. Reciprocal raiding traditions were recorded by early European cultures as being prevalent throughout Island Southeast Asia.

With the advent of Islam and the colonial era, slaves became a valuable resource for trading with European, Arab, and Chinese slavers, and the volume of piracy and slave raids increased significantly. Numerous native peoples engaged in sea raiding; they include the Iranun and Balanguingui slavers of Sulu, the Iban headhunters of Borneo, the Bugis sailors of South Sulawesi, and the Malays of western Southeast Asia. Piracy was also practiced by foreign seafarers on a smaller scale, including Chinese, Japanese, and European traders, renegades, and outlaws. The volume of piracy and raids were often dependent on the ebb and flow of trade and monsoons, with pirate season (known colloquially as the &quot;Pirate Wind&quot;) starting from August to September.

Slave raids were of high economic importance to the Muslim Sultanates in the Sulu Sea: the Sultanate of Sulu, the Sultanate of Maguindanao, and the Confederation of Sultanates in Lanao (the modern Moro people). It is estimated that from 1770 to 1870, around 200,000 to 300,000 people were enslaved by Iranun and Banguingui slavers. David P. Forsythe put the estimate much higher, at around 2 million slaves captured within the first two centuries of Spanish rule of the Philippines after 1565.
These slaves were taken from piracy on passing ships as well as coastal raids on settlements as far as the Malacca Strait, Java, the southern coast of China and the islands beyond the Makassar Strait. Most of the slaves were Tagalogs, Visayans, and &quot;Malays&quot; (including Bugis, Mandarese, Iban, and Makassar). There were also occasional European and Chinese captives who were usually ransomed off through Tausug intermediaries of the Sulu Sultanate. Slaves were the primary indicators of wealth and status, and they were the source of labor for the farms, fisheries, and workshops of the sultanates. While personal slaves were rarely sold, they trafficked extensively in slaves purchased from the Iranun and Banguingui slave markets. By the 1850s, slaves constituted 50% or more of the population of the Sulu archipelago.

The scale was so massive that the word for &quot;pirate&quot; in Malay became &quot;lanun&quot;, an exonym of the Iranun people. The economy of the Sulu sultanates was largely run by slaves and the slave trade. Male captives of the Iranun and the Banguingui were treated brutally, even fellow Muslim captives were not spared. They were usually forced to serve as galley slaves on the &quot;lanong&quot; and &quot;garay&quot; warships of their captors. Female captives, however, were usually treated better. There were no recorded accounts of rapes, though some were starved for discipline. Within a year of capture, most of the captives of the Iranun and Banguingui would be bartered off in Jolo usually for rice, opium, bolts of cloth, iron bars, brassware, and weapons. The buyers were usually Tausug &quot;datu&quot; from the Sultanate of Sulu who had preferential treatment, but buyers also included European (Dutch and Portuguese) and Chinese traders as well as Visayan pirates (&quot;renegados&quot;).
Spanish authorities and native Christian Filipinos responded to the Moro slave raids by building watchtowers and forts across the Philippine archipelago, many of which are still standing today. In Northern Luzon particularly in the Pangasinan, Ilocos and Cagayan, the coastal villages and towns, were frequently raided by Moro and Chinese pirates, locally known as &quot;tírong or cumaw&quot; (raiders, attackers or pirates). These pirates looted and burned villages (&quot;barrios&quot;) and captured women and children for enslavement. To counter these threats, Spanish authorities constructed circular adobe watchtowers, or &quot;baluartes&quot;, measuring 6 to 7 meters high. These structures, built strategically along the coastline using coral blocks bonded with a mixture of lime and egg whites, served as both lookout points and defensive fortifications to protect villages from pirate attacks.
Some provincial capitals were also moved further inland. Major command posts were built in Manila, Cavite, Cebu, Iloilo, Zamboanga, and Iligan. Defending ships were also built by local communities, especially in the Visayas Islands, including the construction of war &quot;barangayanes&quot; (&quot;balangay&quot;) that were faster than the Moro raiders and could give chase. As resistance against raiders increased, &quot;Lanong&quot; warships of the Iranun were eventually replaced by the smaller and faster &quot;garay&quot; warships of the Banguingui in the early 19th century. The Moro raids were eventually subdued by several major naval expeditions by the Spanish and local forces from 1848 to 1891, including retaliatory bombardment and capture of Moro settlements. By this time, the Spanish had also acquired steam gunboats (&quot;vapor&quot;), which could easily overtake and destroy the native Moro warships.

Several famous pirates from the Bajo tribe, such as Intjeh Cohdja and Wassingrana, were hunted by the VOC for hijacking their trading ships.

Aside from the Iranun and Banguingui pirates, other polities were also associated with maritime raiding. The Bugis sailors of South Sulawesi were infamous as pirates who used to range as far west as Singapore and as far north as the Philippines in search of targets for piracy. The Orang laut pirates controlled shipping in the Straits of Malacca and the waters around Singapore, and the Malay and Sea Dayak pirates preyed on maritime shipping in the waters between Singapore and Hong Kong from their haven in Borneo.

===East Asia===
In East Asia by the ninth century, populations centered mostly around merchant activities in coastal Shandong and Jiangsu. Wealthy benefactors including Jang Bogo established Silla Buddhist temples in the region. Jang Bogo had become incensed at the treatment of his fellow countrymen, who in the unstable milieu of late Tang often fell victim to coastal pirates or inland bandits. After returning to Silla around 825, and in possession of a formidable private fleet headquartered at Cheonghae (Wando), Jang Bogo petitioned the Silla king Heungdeok () to establish a permanent maritime garrison to protect Silla merchant activities in the Yellow Sea. Heungdeok agreed and in 828 formally established the Cheonghae (, &quot;clear sea&quot;) Garrison () at what is today Wando island off Korea&#x27;s South Jeolla province. Heungdeok gave Jang an army of 10,000 men to establish and man the defensive works. The remnants of Cheonghae Garrison can still be seen on Jang islet just off Wando&#x27;s southern coast. Jang&#x27;s force, though nominally bequeathed by the Silla king, was effectively under his own control. Jang became arbiter of Yellow Sea commerce and navigation.

From the 13th century, Wokou based in Japan made their debut in East Asia, initiating invasions that would persist for 300 years. The wokou raids peaked in the 1550s, but by then the wokou were mostly Chinese smugglers who reacted strongly against the Ming dynasty&#x27;s strict prohibition on private sea trade.

During the Qing period, Chinese pirate fleets grew increasingly large. The effects large-scale piracy had on the Chinese economy were immense. They preyed voraciously on China&#x27;s junk trade, which flourished in Fujian and Guangdong and was a vital artery of Chinese commerce. Pirate fleets exercised hegemony over villages on the coast, collecting revenue by exacting tribute and running extortion rackets. In 1802, the menacing Zheng Yi inherited the fleet of his cousin, captain Zheng Qi, whose death provided Zheng Yi with considerably more influence in the world of piracy. Zheng Yi and his wife, Zheng Yi Sao (who would eventually inherit the leadership of his pirate confederacy) then formed a pirate coalition that, by 1804, consisted of over ten thousand men. Their military might alone was sufficient to combat the Qing navy. However, a combination of famine, Qing naval opposition, and internal rifts crippled piracy in China around the 1820s, and it has never again reached the same status.

In the 1840s and 1850s, United States Navy and Royal Navy forces campaigned together against Chinese pirates. Major battles were fought such as those at Ty-ho Bay and the Tonkin River though pirate junks continued operating off China for years more. However, some British and American individual citizens also volunteered to serve with Chinese pirates to fight against European forces. The British offered rewards for the capture of westerners serving with Chinese pirates. During the Second Opium War and the Taiping Rebellion, piratical junks were again destroyed in large numbers by British naval forces but ultimately it was not until the 1860s and 1870s that fleets of pirate junks ceased to exist.

Chinese Pirates also plagued the Tonkin Gulf area.

==== Piracy in the Ming dynasty ====
Pirates in the Ming era tended to come from populations on the geographic periphery of the state. They were recruited largely from the lower classes of society, including poor fishermen, and many were fleeing from obligatory labor on state-building projects organized by the dynasty. These lower-class men, and sometimes women, may have fled taxation or conscription by the state in the search of better opportunities and wealth, and willingly joined local pirate bands. These local, lower class individuals seem to have felt unrepresented, and traded the small amount of security afforded them from their allegiance to the state for the promise of a relatively improved existence engaging in smuggling or other illegal trade.

Originally, pirates in the coastal areas near Fujian and Zhejiang may have been Japanese, suggested by the Ming government referring to them as &quot;&quot;wokou&quot; (倭寇)&quot;, but it is probable that piracy was a multi-ethnic profession by the 16th century, although coastal brigands continued to be referred to as &quot;wokou&quot; in many government documents. Most pirates were probably Han Chinese, but Japanese and even Europeans engaged in pirate activities in the region.

==== Illegal trade and authority ====
Pirates engaged in a number of different schemes to make a living. Smuggling and illegal trade overseas were major sources of revenue for pirate bands, both large and small. As the Ming government mostly outlawed private trade overseas, at least until the overseas silver trade contributed to a lifting of the ban, pirates basically could almost by default control the market for any number of foreign goods. The geography of the coastline made chasing pirates quite difficult for the authorities, and private overseas trade began to transform coastal societies by the 15th century, as nearly all aspects of the local society benefitted from or associated with illegal trade. The desire to trade for silver eventually led to open conflict between the Ming and illegal smugglers and pirates. This conflict, along with local merchants in southern China, helped persuade the Ming court to end the haijin ban on private international trade in 1567.

Pirates also projected local political authority. Larger pirate bands could act as local governing bodies for coastal communities, collecting taxes and engaging in &quot;protection&quot; schemes. In addition to illegal goods, pirates ostensibly offered security to communities on land in exchange for a tax. These bands also wrote and codified laws that redistributed wealth, punished crimes, and provided protection for the taxed community. These laws were strictly followed by the pirates, as well. The political structures tended to look similar to the Ming structures.

==== Hierarchy and structure ====
Pirates did not tend to stay pirates permanently. It seems to have been relatively easy both to join and leave a pirate band, and these raiding groups were more interested in maintaining a willing force. Members of these pirate groups did not tend to stay longer than a few months or years at a time.

There appears to have been a hierarchy in most pirate organizations. Pirate leaders could become very wealthy and powerful, especially when working with the Chinese dynasty, and, consequently, so could those who served under them. These pirate groups were organized similarly to other &quot;escape societies&quot; throughout history, and maintained a redistributive system to reward looting; the pirates directly responsible for looting or pillaging got their cut first, and the rest was allocated to the rest of the pirate community. There seems to be evidence that there was an egalitarian aspect to these communities, with capability to do the job being rewarded explicitly. The pirates themselves had some special privileges under the law when they interacted with communities on land, mostly in the form of extra allotments of redistributed wealth.

==== Clientele ====
Pirates, of course, had to sell their loot. They had trading relationships with land communities and foreign traders in the southeastern regions of China. Zhu Wan, who held the office of Grand Coordinator for Coastal Defense, documented that pirates in the region to which he had been sent had the support of the local elite gentry class. These &quot;pirates in gowns and caps&quot; directly or indirectly sponsored pirate activity and certainly directly benefitted from the illegal private trade in the region. When Zhu Wan or other officials from the capital attempted to eliminate the pirate problem, these local elites fought back, having Zhu Wan demoted and eventually even sent back to Beijing to possibly be executed. The gentry who benefitted from illegal maritime trade were too powerful and influential, and they were clearly very invested in the smuggling activities of the pirate community.

In addition to their relationship with the local elite class on the coast, pirates also had complicated and often friendly relationships and partnerships with the dynasty itself, as well as with international traders. When pirate groups recognized the authority of the dynasty, they would often be allowed to operate freely and even profit from the relationship. There were also opportunities for these pirates to ally themselves with colonial projects from Europe or other overseas powers. Both the dynasty and foreign colonial projects would employ pirates as mercenaries to establish dominance in the coastal region. Because of how difficult it was for established state powers to control these regions, pirates seem to have had a lot of freedom to choose their allies and their preferred markets. Included in this list of possible allies, sea marauders and pirates even found opportunities to bribe military officials as they engaged in illegal trade. They seem to have been incentivized mostly by money and loot, and so could afford to play the field with regards to their political or military allies.

Because pirate organizations could be so powerful locally, the Ming government made concerted efforts to weaken them. The presence of colonial projects complicated this, however, as pirates could ally themselves with other maritime powers or local elites to stay in business. The Chinese government was clearly aware of the power of some of these pirate groups, as some documents even refer to them as &quot;sea rebels,&quot; a reference to the political nature of pirates. Pirates like Zheng Zhilong and Zheng Chenggong accrued tremendous local power, eventually even being hired as naval commanders by the Chinese dynasties and foreign maritime powers.

===South Asia===
Bawarij were Sindhi pirates named for their distinctive barja warships who were active between 251 and 865 AD. Their frequent piracy and the incident in which they looted two treasure ships coming from Ceylon became the casus belli for the Umayyad conquest of Sindh.

Pirates who accepted the Royal Pardon from the Chola Empire would get to serve in the Chola Navy as &quot;Kallarani&quot;. They would be used as coast guards, or sent on recon missions to deal with Arab piracy in the Arabian Sea. Their function is similar to the 18th century privateers, used by the Royal Navy.

Starting in the 14th century, the Deccan (Southern Peninsular region of India) was divided into two entities: on the one side stood the Muslim Bahmani Sultanate and on the other stood the Hindu kings rallied around the Vijayanagara Empire. Continuous wars demanded frequent resupplies of fresh horses, which were imported through sea routes from Persia and Africa. This trade was subjected to frequent raids by thriving bands of pirates based in the coastal cities of Western India. One of such was Timoji, who operated off Anjadip Island both as a privateer (by seizing horse traders, that he rendered to the raja of Honavar) and as a pirate who attacked the Kerala merchant fleets that traded pepper with Gujarat.

During the 16th and 17th centuries, there was frequent European piracy against Mughal Indian merchants, especially those en route to Mecca for Hajj. The situation came to a head when the Portuguese attacked and captured the vessel &quot;Rahimi&quot; which belonged to Mariam Zamani the Mughal queen, which led to the Mughal seizure of the Portuguese town Daman. In the 18th century, the famous Maratha privateer Kanhoji Angre ruled the seas between Mumbai and Goa. The Marathas attacked British shipping and insisted that East India Company ships pay taxes if sailing through their waters.

===Persian Gulf===

The southern coast of the Persian Gulf was known to the British from the late 18th century as the &quot;Pirate Coast, &quot;where control of the seaways of the Persian Gulf was asserted by the Qawasim (Al Qasimi) and other local maritime powers. Memories of the privations carried out on the coast by Portuguese raiders under Albuquerque were long and local powers antipathetic as a consequence to Christian powers asserting dominance of their coastal waters. Early British expeditions to protect the Imperial Indian Ocean trade from competitors, principally the Al Qasimi from Ras Al Khaimah and Lingeh, led to campaigns against those headquarters and other harbours along the coast in 1809 and then, after a relapse in raiding, again in 1819. This led to the signing of the first formal treaty of maritime peace between the British and the rulers of several coastal sheikhdoms in 1820. This was cemented by the Treaty of Maritime Peace in Perpetuity in 1853, resulting in the British label for the area, &#x27;Pirate Coast&#x27; being softened to the &#x27;Trucial Coast&#x27;, with several emirates being recognised by the British as Trucial States.

===Madagascar===

At one point, there were nearly 1,000 pirates located in Madagascar. Île Sainte-Marie was a popular base for pirates throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. The most famous pirate utopia is that of the probably fictional Captain Misson and his pirate crew, who allegedly founded the free colony of Libertatia in northern Madagascar in the late 17th century, until it was destroyed in a surprise attack by the island natives in 1694.

===The Caribbean===
 

The classic era of piracy in the Caribbean lasted from circa 1650 until the mid-1720s. By 1650, France, England and the United Provinces began to develop their colonial empires. This involved considerable seaborne trade, and a general economic improvement: there was money to be madeor stolenand much of it traveled by ship.

French buccaneers were established on northern Hispaniola as early as 1625, but lived at first mostly as hunters rather than robbers; their transition to full-time piracy was gradual and motivated in part by Spanish efforts to wipe out both the buccaneers and the prey animals on which they depended. The buccaneers&#x27; migration from Hispaniola&#x27;s mainland to the more defensible offshore island of Tortuga limited their resources and accelerated their piratical raids. According to Alexandre Exquemelin, a buccaneer and historian who remains a major source on this period, the Tortuga buccaneer Pierre Le Grand pioneered the settlers&#x27; attacks on galleons making the return voyage to Spain.

The growth of buccaneering on Tortuga was augmented by the English capture of Jamaica from Spain in 1655. The early English governors of Jamaica freely granted letters of marque to Tortuga buccaneers and to their own countrymen, while the growth of Port Royal provided these raiders with a far more profitable and enjoyable place to sell their booty. In the 1660s, the new French governor of Tortuga, Bertrand d&#x27;Ogeron, similarly provided privateering commissions both to his own colonists and to English cutthroats from Port Royal. These conditions brought Caribbean buccaneering to its zenith.
A new phase of piracy began in the 1690s as English pirates began to look beyond the Caribbean for treasure. The fall of Britain&#x27;s Stuart kings had restored the traditional enmity between Britain and France, thus ending the profitable collaboration between English Jamaica and French Tortuga. The devastation of Port Royal by an earthquake in 1692 further reduced the Caribbean&#x27;s attractions by destroying the pirates&#x27; chief market for fenced plunder. Caribbean colonial governors began to discard the traditional policy of &quot;no peace beyond the Line,&quot; under which it was understood that war would continue (and thus letters of marque would be granted) in the Caribbean regardless of peace treaties signed in Europe; henceforth, commissions would be granted only in wartime, and their limitations would be strictly enforced. Furthermore, much of the Spanish Main had simply been exhausted; Maracaibo alone had been sacked three times between 1667 and 1678, while Río de la Hacha had been raided five times and Tolú eight.

At the same time, England&#x27;s less favored colonies, including Bermuda, New York, and Rhode Island, had become cash-starved by the Navigation Acts, which restricted trade with foreign ships. Merchants and governors eager for coin were willing to overlook and even underwrite pirate voyages; one colonial official defended a pirate because he thought it &quot;very harsh to hang people that brings in gold to these provinces.&quot; Although some of these pirates operating out of New England and the Middle Colonies targeted Spain&#x27;s remoter Pacific coast colonies well into the 1690s and beyond, the Indian Ocean was a richer and more tempting target. India&#x27;s economic output was large during this time, especially in high-value luxury goods like silk and calico which made ideal pirate booty; at the same time, no powerful navies plied the Indian Ocean, leaving both local shipping and the various East India companies&#x27; vessels vulnerable to attack. This set the stage for the famous pirates, Thomas Tew, Henry Every, Robert Culliford and (although his guilt remains controversial) William Kidd.

In 1713 and 1714, a series of peace treaties ended the War of the Spanish Succession. As a result, thousands of seamen, including European privateers who had operated in the West Indies, were relieved of military duty, at a time when cross-Atlantic colonial shipping trade was beginning to boom. In addition, European sailors who had been pushed by unemployment to work onboard merchantmen (including slave ships) were often enthusiastic to abandon that profession and turn to pirating, giving pirate captains a steady pool of recruits from various coasts across the Atlantic.

In 1715, pirates launched a major raid on Spanish divers trying to recover gold from a sunken treasure galleon near Florida. The nucleus of the pirate force was a group of English ex-privateers, all of whom would soon be enshrined in infamy: Henry Jennings, Charles Vane, Samuel Bellamy, and Edward England. The attack was successful, but contrary to their expectations, the governor of Jamaica refused to allow Jennings and their cohorts to spend their loot on his island. With Kingston and the declining Port Royal closed to them, Jennings and his comrades founded a new pirate base at Nassau, on the island of New Providence in the Bahamas, which had been abandoned during the war. Until the arrival of governor Woodes Rogers three years later, Nassau would be home for these pirates and their many recruits.

Shipping traffic between Africa, the Caribbean, and Europe began to soar in the 18th century, a model that was known as triangular trade, and was a rich target for piracy. Trade ships sailed from Europe to the African coast, trading manufactured goods and weapons in exchange for slaves. The traders would then sail to the Caribbean to sell the slaves, and return to Europe with goods such as sugar, tobacco and cocoa. Another triangular trade saw ships carry raw materials, preserved cod, and rum to Europe, where a portion of the cargo would be sold for manufactured goods, which (along with the remainder of the original load) were transported to the Caribbean, where they were exchanged for sugar and molasses, which (with some manufactured articles) were borne to New England. Ships in the triangular trade made money at each stop.

As part of the peace settlement of the War of the Spanish succession, Britain obtained the &quot;asiento&quot;, a Spanish government contract, to supply slaves to Spain&#x27;s new world colonies, providing British traders and smugglers more access to the traditionally closed Spanish markets in America. This arrangement also contributed heavily to the spread of piracy across the western Atlantic at this time. Shipping to the colonies boomed simultaneously with the flood of skilled mariners after the war. Merchant shippers used the surplus of sailors&#x27; labor to drive wages down, cutting corners to maximize their profits, and creating unsavory conditions aboard their vessels. Merchant sailors suffered from mortality rates as high or higher than the slaves being transported (Rediker, 2004). Living conditions were so poor that many sailors began to prefer a freer existence as a pirate. The increased volume of shipping traffic also could sustain a large body of brigands preying upon it. Among the most infamous Caribbean pirates of the time were Edward Teach or &quot;Blackbeard&quot;, Calico Jack Rackham, and Bartholomew Roberts. Most of these pirates were eventually hunted down by the Royal Navy and killed or captured; several battles were fought between the brigands and the colonial powers on both land and sea.

Piracy in the Caribbean declined for the next several decades after 1730, but by the 1810s many pirates roamed the waters though they were not as bold or successful as their predecessors. The most successful pirates of the era were Jean Lafitte and Roberto Cofresi. Lafitte is considered by many to be the last buccaneer due to his army of pirates and fleet of pirate ships which held bases in and around the Gulf of Mexico. Lafitte and his men participated in the War of 1812 battle of New Orleans. Cofresi&#x27;s base was in Mona Island, Puerto Rico, from where he disrupted the commerce throughout the region. He became the last major target of the international anti-piracy operations.
The elimination of piracy from European waters expanded to the Caribbean in the 18th century, West Africa and North America by the 1710s and by the 1720s even the Indian Ocean was a difficult location for pirates to operate.

England began to strongly turn against piracy at the turn of the 18th century, as it was increasingly damaging to the country&#x27;s economic and commercial prospects in the region. The Piracy Act 1698 for the &quot;more effectual suppression of Piracy&quot; made it easier to capture, try and convict pirates by lawfully enabling acts of piracy to be &quot;examined, inquired of, tried, heard and determined, and adjudged in any place at sea, or upon the land, in any of his Majesty&#x27;s islands, plantations, colonies, dominions, forts, or factories.&quot; This effectively enabled admirals to hold a court session to hear the trials of pirates in any place they deemed necessary, rather than requiring that the trial be held in England. Commissioners of these vice-admiralty courts were also vested with &quot;full power and authority&quot; to issue warrants, summon the necessary witnesses, and &quot;to do all thing necessary for the hearing and final determination of any case of piracy, robbery, or felony.&quot; These new and faster trials provided no legal representation for the pirates; and ultimately led in this era to the execution of 600 pirates, which represented approximately 10 percent of the pirates active at the time in the Caribbean region. Being an accessory to piracy was also criminalised under the statute.
Piracy saw a brief resurgence between the end of the War of the Spanish Succession in 1713 and around 1720, as many unemployed seafarers took to piracy as a way to make ends meet when a surplus of sailors after the war led to a decline in wages and working conditions. At the same time, one of the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht that ended the war gave to Great Britain&#x27;s Royal African Company and other British slavers a thirty-year asiento, or contract, to furnish African slaves to the Spanish colonies, providing British merchants and smugglers potential inroads into the traditionally closed Spanish markets in America and leading to an economic revival for the whole region. This revived Caribbean trade provided rich new pickings for a wave of piracy. Also contributing to the increase of Caribbean piracy at this time was Spain&#x27;s breakup of the English logwood settlement at Campeche and the attractions of a freshly sunken silver fleet off the southern Bahamas in 1715. Fears over the rising levels of crime and piracy, political discontent, concern over crowd behaviour at public punishments, and an increased determination by Parliament to suppress piracy, resulted in the Piracy Act 1717 and Piracy Act 1721. These established a seven-year penal transportation to North America as a possible punishment for those convicted of lesser felonies, or as a possible sentence that capital punishment might be commuted to by royal pardon. In 1717, a pardon was offered to pirates who surrendered to British authorities.

After 1720, piracy in the classic sense became extremely rare as increasingly effective anti-piracy measures were taken by the Royal Navy, making it impossible for any pirate to pursue an effective career for long. By 1718, the British Royal Navy had approximately 124 vessels and 214 by 1815; a big increase from the two vessels England had possessed in 1670. British Royal Navy warships tirelessly hunted down pirate vessels, and almost always won these engagements.
Many pirates did not surrender and were killed at the point of capture; notorious pirate Edward Teach, or &quot;Blackbeard&quot;, was hunted down by Lieutenant Robert Maynard at Ocracoke Inlet off the coast of North Carolina on November 22, 1718, and killed. His flagship was a captured French slave ship known originally as &quot;La Concorde&quot;, he renamed the frigate &quot;Queen Anne&#x27;s Revenge&quot;. Captain Chaloner Ogle of HMS &quot;Swallow&quot; cornered Bartholomew Roberts in 1722 at Cape Lopez, and a fatal broadside from the &quot;Swallow&quot; killed the pirate captain instantly. Roberts&#x27; death shocked the pirate world, as well as the Royal Navy. The local merchants and civilians had thought him invincible, and some considered him a hero. Roberts&#x27; death was seen by many historians as the end of the Golden Age of Piracy. Also crucial to the end of this era of piracy was the loss of the pirates&#x27; last Caribbean safe haven at Nassau.

In the early 19th century, piracy along the East and Gulf Coasts of North America as well as in the Caribbean increased again. Jean Lafitte was just one of hundreds of pirates operating in American and Caribbean waters between the years of 1820 and 1835. The United States Navy repeatedly engaged pirates in the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico and in the Mediterranean. Cofresí&#x27;s &quot;El Mosquito&quot; was disabled in a collaboration between Spain and the United States. After fleeing for hours, he was ambushed and captured inland. The United States landed shore parties on several islands in the Caribbean in pursuit of pirates; Cuba was a major haven. By the 1830s piracy had died out again, and the navies of the region focused on the slave trade.

About the time of the Mexican–American War in 1846, the United States Navy had grown strong and numerous enough to eliminate the pirate threat in the West Indies. By the 1830s, ships had begun to convert to steam propulsion, so the Age of Sail and the classical idea of pirates in the Caribbean ended. Privateering, similar to piracy, continued as an asset in war for a few more decades and proved to be of some importance during the naval campaigns of the American Civil War.

Privateering would remain a tool of European states until the mid-19th century&#x27;s Declaration of Paris. But letters of marque were given out much more sparingly by governments and were terminated as soon as conflicts ended. The idea of &quot;no peace beyond the Line&quot; was a relic that had no meaning by the more settled late 18th and early 19th centuries.

=== Canary Islands ===

Due to the strategic situation of this Spanish archipelago as a crossroads of maritime routes and commercial bridge between Europe, Africa and America, this was one of the places on the planet with the greatest pirate presence.

In the Canary Islands, the following stand out: the attacks and continuous looting of Berber, English, French and Dutch corsairs sometimes successful and often a failure; and on the other hand, the presence of pirates and corsairs from this archipelago, who made their incursions into the Caribbean. Pirates and corsairs such as François Le Clerc, Jacques de Sores, Francis Drake defeat in Gran Canaria, Pieter van der Does, Murat Reis and Horacio Nelson attacked the islands and was defeated in the Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (1797). Among those born in the archipelago stands out above all Amaro Pargo, whom the monarch Felipe V of Spain frequently benefited in his commercial incursions and corsairs.

===North America===
Piracy on the east coast of North America first became common in the early seventeenth century, as English privateers discharged after the end of the Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604) turned to piracy. The most famous and successful of these early pirates was Peter Easton.

River piracy in late 18th-mid-19th century America was primarily concentrated along the Ohio River and Mississippi River valleys. In 1803, at Tower Rock, the U.S. Army dragoons, possibly, from the frontier army post up river at Fort Kaskaskia, on the Illinois side opposite St. Louis, raided and drove out the river pirates.

Stack Island was also associated with river pirates and counterfeiters in the late 1790s. In 1809, the last major river pirate activity took place, on the Upper Mississippi River, and river piracy in this area came to an abrupt end, when a group of flatboatmen raided the island, wiping out the river pirates. From 1790 to 1834, Cave-In-Rock was the principal outlaw lair and headquarters of river pirate activity in the Ohio River region, from which Samuel Mason led a gang of river pirates on the Ohio River.

River piracy continued on the lower Mississippi River, from the early 1800s to the mid-1830s, declining as a result of direct military action and local law enforcement and regulator-vigilante groups that uprooted and swept out pockets of outlaw resistance.

&quot;Roaring&quot; Dan Seavey was a pirate active in the early 1900s in the Great Lakes region who joined the United States Marshals Service in later life, working to curb poaching, smuggling, and piracy on Lake Michigan.

==Culture and social structure==

===Rewards===

Pirates had a system of hierarchy on board their ships determining how captured money was distributed. However, pirates were more egalitarian than any other area of employment at the time. In fact, pirate quartermasters were a counterbalance to the captain and had the power to veto his orders. The majority of plunder was in the form of cargo and ship&#x27;s equipment, with medicines the most highly prized. A vessel&#x27;s doctor&#x27;s chest would be worth anywhere from £300 to £400, or around $470,000 in today&#x27;s values. Jewels were common plunder but not popular, as they were hard to sell, and pirates, unlike the public of today, had little concept of their value. There is one case recorded where a pirate was given a large diamond worth a great deal more than the value of the handful of small diamonds given to his crewmates as a share. He felt cheated and had it broken up to match what they received.

Spanish pieces of eight minted in Mexico or Seville were the standard trade currency in the American colonies. However, every colony still used the monetary units of pounds, shillings, and pence for bookkeeping while Spanish, German, French, and Portuguese money were all standard mediums of exchange as British law prohibited the export of British silver coinage. Until the exchange rates were standardised in the late 18th century each colony legislated its own different exchange rates. In England, 1 piece of eight was worth 4s 3d while it was worth 8s in New York, 7s 6d in Pennsylvania and 6s 8d in Virginia. One 18th-century English shilling was worth around $58 in modern currency, so a piece of eight could be worth anywhere from $246 to $465. As such, the value of pirate plunder could vary considerably, depending on who recorded it and where.

Ordinary seamen received a part of the plunder at the captain&#x27;s discretion but usually a single share. On average, a pirate could expect the equivalent of a year&#x27;s wages as his share from each ship captured while the crew of the most successful pirates would often each receive a share valued at around £1,000 ($1.17 million) at least once in their career. One of the larger amounts taken from a single ship was that by captain Thomas Tew from an Indian merchantman in 1692. Each ordinary seaman on his ship received a share worth £3,000 ($3.5 million), with officers receiving proportionally larger amounts as per the agreed shares, with Tew himself receiving 2½ shares. It is known there were actions with multiple ships captured where a single share was worth almost double this.

By contrast, an ordinary seamen in the Royal Navy received 19s per month to be paid in a lump sum at the end of a tour of duty, which was around half the rate paid in the Merchant Navy. However, corrupt officers would often &quot;tax&quot; their crews&#x27; wage to supplement their own, and the Royal Navy of the day was infamous for its reluctance to pay. From this wage, 6d per month was deducted for the maintenance of Greenwich Hospital, with similar amounts deducted for the Chatham Chest, the chaplain and surgeon. Six months&#x27; pay was withheld to discourage desertion. That this was insufficient incentive is revealed in a report on proposed changes to the RN Admiral Nelson wrote in 1803; he noted that since 1793 more than 42,000 sailors had deserted. Roughly half of all RN crews were pressganged and these not only received lower wages than volunteers but were shackled while the vessel was docked and were never permitted to go ashore until released from service.

Although the Royal Navy suffered from many morale issues, it answered the question of prize money via the Cruizers and Convoys Act 1708 which handed over the share previously gained by the Crown to the captors of the ship. Technically it was still possible for the Crown to get the money or a portion of it but this rarely happened. The process of condemnation of a captured vessel and its cargo and men was given to the High Court of the Admiralty and this was the process which remained in force with minor changes throughout the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.

Even the flag officer&#x27;s share was not quite straightforward; he would only get the full one-eighth if he had no junior flag officer beneath him. If this was the case then he would get a third share. If he had more than one then he would take one-half while the rest was shared out equally.

There was a great deal of money to be made in this way. The record breaker was the capture of the Spanish frigate &quot;Hermione&quot;, which was carrying treasure in 1762. The value of this was so great that each individual seaman netted £485 ($1.4 million in 2008 dollars). The two captains responsible, Evans and Pownall, received £65,000 each ($188.4 million). In January 1807 the frigate &quot;Caroline&quot; took the Spanish &quot;San Rafael&quot;, which brought in £52,000 for her captain, Peter Rainier (who had been only a midshipman some thirteen months before). All through the wars there are examples of this kind of luck falling on captains. Another famous &#x27;capture&#x27; was that of the Spanish frigates &quot;Thetis&quot; and &quot;Santa Brigada&quot;, which were loaded with gold specie. They were taken by four British frigates who shared the money, each captain receiving £40,730. Each lieutenant got £5,091, the Warrant Officer group, £2,468, the midshipmen £791 and the individual seamen £182.

It should also be noted that it was usually only the frigates which took prizes; the ships of the line were far too ponderous to be able to chase and capture the smaller ships which generally carried treasure. Nelson always bemoaned that he had done badly out of prize money and even as a flag officer received little. This was not that he had a bad command of captains but rather that British mastery of the seas was so complete that few enemy ships dared to sail.

===Loot===

Even though pirates raided many ships, few, if any, buried their treasure. Often, the &quot;treasure&quot; that was stolen was food, water, alcohol, weapons, or clothing. Other things they stole were household items like bits of soap and gear like rope and anchors, or sometimes they would keep the ship they captured (either to sell off or keep because it was better than their ship). Such items were likely to be needed immediately, rather than saved for future trade. For this reason, there was no need for the pirates to bury these goods. Pirates tended to kill few people aboard the ships they captured; usually they would kill no one if the ship surrendered, because if it became known that pirates took no prisoners, their victims would fight to the last breath and make victory both very difficult and costly in lives. In contrast, ships would quickly surrender if they knew they would be spared. In one well-documented case 300 heavily armed soldiers on a ship attacked by Thomas Tew surrendered after a brief battle with none of Tew&#x27;s 40-man crew being injured.

===Punishment===

During the 17th and 18th centuries, once pirates were caught, justice was meted out in a summary fashion, and many ended their lives by &quot;dancing the hempen jig&quot;, a euphemism for hanging. Public execution was a form of entertainment at the time, and people came out to watch them as they would to a sporting event today. Newspapers reported details such as condemned men&#x27;s last words, the prayers said by the priests, and descriptions of their final moments in the gallows. In England most of these executions took place at Execution Dock on the River Thames in London.

In the cases of more famous prisoners, usually captains, their punishments extended beyond death. Their bodies were enclosed in iron cages (gibbet) (for which they were measured before their execution) and left to swing in the air until the flesh rotted off them- a process that could take as long as two years. The bodies of captains such as William &quot;Captain&quot; Kidd, Charles Vane, William Fly, and Jack Rackham (&quot;Calico Jack&quot;) were all treated this manner.

===Role of women===
While piracy was predominantly a male occupation throughout history, a minority of pirates were female. Pirates did not allow women onto their ships very often. Additionally, women were often regarded as bad luck among pirates. It was feared that the male members of the crew would argue and fight over the women. On many ships, women (as well as young boys) were prohibited by the ship&#x27;s contract, which all crew members were required to sign. 

Because of the resistance to allowing women on board, many female pirates did not identify themselves as such. Anne Bonny, for example, dressed and acted as a man while on Captain Calico Jack&#x27;s ship. She and Mary Read, another female pirate, are often identified as being unique in this regard. However, it is possible many women dressed as men during the Golden Age of Piracy, in an effort to take advantage of the many rights, privileges, and freedoms that were exclusive to men.

===Democracy among Caribbean pirates===

Unlike traditional Western societies of the time, many Caribbean pirate crews of European descent operated as limited democracies. Pirate communities were some of the first to instate a system of checks and balances similar to the one used by the present-day democracies. The first record of such a government aboard a pirate sloop dates to the 17th century.

===Pirate Code===
As recorded by Captain Charles Johnson regarding the articles of Bartholomew Roberts.
==Known pirate shipwrecks==
To date, the following identifiable pirate shipwrecks have been discovered:

*&quot;Whydah Gally&quot; (discovered in 1984), a former slave ship seized on its maiden voyage from Africa by the pirate captain &quot;Black Sam&quot; Bellamy. The wreck was found off the coast of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, buried under to feet of sand, in depths ranging from to feet deep, spread for four miles, parallel to the Cape&#x27;s easternmost coast. With the discovery of the ship&#x27;s bell in 1985 and a small brass placard in 2013, both inscribed with the ship&#x27;s name and maiden voyage date, the &quot;Whydah&quot; is the only fully authenticated Golden Age pirate shipwreck ever discovered. Since 2007, the &quot;Wydah&quot; collection has been touring as part of the exhibit &quot;Real Pirates&quot; sponsored by National Geographic.
*&quot;Queen Anne&#x27;s Revenge&quot; (discovered in 1996), the flagship of the infamous pirate Blackbeard. He used the ship for less than a year, but it was an effective tool in his prize-taking. In June 1718, Blackbeard ran the ship aground at Topsail Inlet, now known as Beaufort Inlet, North Carolina. Intersal, a private firm working under a permit with the state of North Carolina, discovered the remains of the vessel in 28 feet (8.5m) of water about one mile (1.6 km) offshore of Fort Macon State Park, Atlantic Beach, North Carolina. Thirty-one cannons have been identified to date, and more than 250,000 artifacts have been recovered. The cannons are of different origins (such as English, Swedish, and possibly French) and different sizes, as would be expected with a colonial pirate crew.
*&quot;Golden Fleece&quot; (discovered in 2009), the ship of the notorious English pirate Joseph Bannister, which was found by the American shipwreck hunters John Chatterton and John Mattera in the Dominican Republic, at Samaná Bay. The discovery is recounted in Robert Kurson&#x27;s book &quot;Pirate Hunters&quot; (2015).

==Privateers==
A privateer or corsair used similar methods to a pirate, but acted under orders of the state while in possession of a commission or letter of marque and reprisal from a government or monarch authorizing the capture of merchant ships belonging to an enemy nation. For example, the United States Constitution of 1787 specifically authorized Congress to issue letters of marque and reprisal. The letter of marque and reprisal was recognized by international convention and meant that a privateer could not technically be charged with piracy while attacking the targets named in his commission. This nicety of law did not always save the individuals concerned, however, since whether one was considered a pirate or a legally operating privateer often depended on whose custody the individual found himself in—that of the country that had issued the commission, or that of the object of attack. Spanish authorities were known to execute foreign privateers with their letters of marque hung around their necks to emphasize Spain&#x27;s rejection of such defenses. Furthermore, many privateers exceeded the bounds of their letters of marque by attacking nations with which their sovereign was at peace (Thomas Tew and William Kidd are notable alleged examples), and thus made themselves liable to conviction for piracy. However, a letter of marque did provide some cover for such pirates, as plunder seized from neutral or friendly shipping could be passed off later as taken from enemy merchants.
The famous Barbary corsairs of the Mediterranean, authorized by the Ottoman Empire, were privateers, as were the Maltese corsairs, who were authorized by the Knights of St. John, and the Dunkirkers in the service of the Spanish Empire. In the years 1626–1634 alone, the Dunkirk privateers captured 1,499 ships, and sank another 336. From 1609 to 1616, England lost 466 merchant ships to Barbary pirates, and 160 British ships were captured by Algerians between 1677 and 1680. One famous privateer was Sir Francis Drake. His patron was Queen Elizabeth I, and their relationship ultimately proved to be quite profitable for England.

Privateers constituted a large proportion of the total military force at sea during the 17th and 18th centuries. During the Nine Years War, the French adopted a policy of strongly encouraging privateers (French corsairs), including the famous Jean Bart, to attack English and Dutch shipping. England lost roughly 4,000 merchant ships during the war. In the following War of Spanish Succession, privateer attacks continued, Britain losing 3,250 merchant ships. During the War of Austrian Succession, Britain lost 3,238 merchant ships and France lost 3,434 merchant ships to the British.

During King George&#x27;s War, approximately 36,000 Americans served aboard privateers at one time or another. During the American Revolution, about 55,000 American seamen served aboard the privateers. The American privateers had almost 1,700 ships, and they captured 2,283 enemy ships. Between the end of the Revolutionary War and 1812, less than 30 years, Britain, France, Naples, the Barbary states, Spain, and the Netherlands seized approximately 2,500 American ships. Payments in ransom and tribute to the Barbary states amounted to 20% of United States government annual revenues in 1800. Throughout the American Civil War, Confederate privateers successfully harassed Union merchant ships.

Privateering lost international sanction under the Declaration of Paris in 1856.

==Commerce raiders==

A wartime activity similar to piracy involves disguised warships called commerce raiders or merchant raiders, which attack enemy shipping commerce, approaching by stealth and then opening fire. Commerce raiders operated successfully during the American Revolution. During the American Civil War, the Confederacy sent out several commerce raiders, the most famous of which was the CSS &quot;Alabama&quot;. During World War I and World War II, Germany also made use of these tactics, both in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Since commissioned naval vessels were openly used, these commerce raiders should not be considered even privateers, much less pirates—although the opposing combatants were vocal in denouncing them as such.

==Contemporary piracy==


Seaborne piracy against transport vessels is a significant issue, with estimated worldwide losses of US$16 billion per year in 2004, increased to US$25 billion over the next 20 years. Waters between the Red Sea and Indian Ocean, off the Somali coast, and also in the Strait of Malacca and Singapore, which are used by over 50,000 commercial ships a year. In the Gulf of Guinea, maritime piracy has also led to pressure on offshore oil and gas production, providing security for offshore installations and supply vessels is often paid for by oil companies rather than the respective governments. In the late 2000s, the emergence of piracy off the coast of Somalia spurred a multi-national effort led by the United States to patrol the waters near the Horn of Africa. In 2011, Brazil also created an anti-piracy unit on the Amazon River. Sir Peter Blake, a New Zealand world champion yachtsman, was killed by pirates on the Amazon river in 2001.

In the European Union, vessels suffer river piracy, with attacks on the Serbian and Romanian stretches of the Danube river, an international waterway.

Modern pirates favor small boats and taking advantage of the small number of crew members on modern cargo vessels. They also use large vessels to supply the smaller attack/boarding vessels. Modern pirates can be successful because a large amount of international commerce occurs via shipping. Major shipping routes take cargo ships through narrow bodies of water such as the Gulf of Aden and the Strait of Malacca making them vulnerable to be overtaken and boarded by small motorboats. Other active areas include the South China Sea and the Niger Delta. As usage increases, many of these ships have to lower cruising speeds to allow for navigation and traffic control, making them prime targets for piracy.

Also, pirates often operate in regions of poor developing or struggling countries with small or nonexistent navies and large trade routes. Pirates sometimes evade capture by sailing into waters controlled by their pursuer&#x27;s enemies. With the end of the Cold War, navies have decreased in size and patrol less frequently, while trade has increased, making organized piracy far easier. Modern pirates are sometimes linked with organized-crime syndicates, but often are small individual groups.

The International Maritime Bureau (IMB) maintains statistics regarding pirate attacks dating back to 1995. Their records indicate hostage-taking overwhelmingly dominates the types of violence against seafarers. For example, in 2006, there were 239 attacks, 77 crew members were kidnapped and 188 taken hostage but only 15 of the pirate attacks resulted in murder. In 2007 the attacks rose by 10 percent to 263 attacks. There was a 35 percent increase on reported attacks involving guns. Crew members that were injured numbered 64 compared to just 17 in 2006. That number does not include instances of hostage taking and kidnapping where the victims were not injured.

The number of attacks from January to September 2009 had surpassed the previous year&#x27;s total due to the increased pirate attacks in the Gulf of Aden and off Somalia. Between January and September the number of attacks rose to 306 from 293. Pirates boarded the vessels in 114 cases and hijacked 34 of them. Gun use in pirate attacks increased to 176 cases from 76 in 2008.

Rather than cargo, modern pirates have targeted the personal belongings of the crew and the contents of the ship&#x27;s safe, which potentially contains large amounts of cash needed for payroll and port fees. In other cases, the pirates force the crew off the ship and then sail it to a port to be repainted and given a new identity through false papers purchased from corrupt or complicit officials.

Modern piracy can take place in conditions of political unrest. For example, following the U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam, Thai piracy was aimed at the many Vietnamese who took to boats to escape. Further, following the disintegration of the government of Somalia, warlords in the region have attacked ships delivering UN food aid.

The attack against the German-built cruise ship the &quot;Seabourn Spirit&quot; offshore of Somalia in November 2005 is an example of the sophisticated pirates mariners face. The pirates carried out their attack more than offshore with speedboats launched from a larger mother ship. The attackers were armed with automatic firearms and an RPG.

Since 2008, Somali pirates centered in the Gulf of Aden made about $120 million annually, reportedly costing the shipping industry between $900 million and $3.3 billion per year. By September 2012, the heyday of piracy in the Indian Ocean was reportedly over. Backers were now reportedly reluctant to finance pirate expeditions due to the low rate of success, and pirates were no longer able to reimburse their creditors. According to the International Maritime Bureau, pirate attacks had by October 2012 dropped to a six-year low. Only five ships were captured by the end of the year, representing a decrease from 25 in 2011 and 27 in 2010, with only one ship attacked in the third quarter compared to 36 during the same period in 2011. However, pirate incidents off on the West African seaboard increased to 34 from 30 the previous year, and attacks off the coast of Indonesia rose from 2011&#x27;s total of 46 to 51.

Many nations forbid ships to enter their territorial waters or ports if the crew of the ships are armed, in an effort to restrict possible piracy. Shipping companies sometimes hire private armed security guards.

Modern definitions of piracy include the following acts:
* Boarding without permission.
* Extortion
* Hostage taking
* Kidnapping of people for ransom
* Murder
* Cargo theft
* Robbery and seizure of items or the ship
* Sabotage resulting in the ship subsequently sinking
* Shipwrecking done intentionally to a ship

Together with treason and counterfeiting; piracy, including acts against the law of nations, is one of three criminal offenses against which the United States Congress is delegated power to enact penal legislation by the Constitution of the United States.

In modern times, ships and airplanes are hijacked for political reasons as well. The perpetrators of these acts could be described as pirates (for instance, the French term for &quot;plane hijacker&quot; is &quot;pirate de l&#x27;air&quot;, literally &quot;air pirate&quot;), but in English are usually termed &quot;hijackers&quot;. An example is the hijacking of the Italian civilian passenger ship by the Palestine Liberation Organization in 1985, which is regarded as an act of piracy. A 2009 book entitled &quot;International Legal Dimension of Terrorism&quot; called the attackers &quot;terrorists&quot;.

Modern pirates also use a great deal of technology. It has been reported that crimes of piracy have involved the use of mobile phones, satellite phones, GPS, machetes, AK74 rifles, sonar systems, modern speedboats, shotguns, pistols, mounted machine guns, and even RPGs and grenade launchers.

In 2020, the amount of piracy increased by 24% after being at its lowest 21st century level in 2019. The Americas and Africa have been identified by the International Chamber of Commerce as the most vulnerable to piracy as a result of less-wealthy governments in the regions being unable to adequately combat piracy.

IMB Piracy Reporting Centre keeps a live piracy map to help keep track of all recent piracy and armed robbery incidents.

==Anti-piracy measures==

Under a principle of international law known as the &quot;universality principle&quot;, a government may &quot;exercise jurisdiction over conduct outside its territory if that conduct is universally dangerous to states and their nationals.&quot; The rationale behind the universality principle is that states will punish certain acts &quot;wherever they may occur as a means of protecting the global community as a whole, even absent a link between the state and the parties or the acts in question.&quot; Under this principle, the concept of &quot;universal jurisdiction&quot; applies to the crime of piracy. For example, the United States has a statute (section 1651 of title 18 of the United States Code) imposing a sentence of life in prison for piracy &quot;as defined by the law of nations&quot; committed anywhere on the high seas, regardless of the nationality of the pirates or the victims.

The goal of maritime security operations is &quot;actively to deter, disrupt and suppress piracy in order to protect global maritime security and secure freedom of navigation for the benefit of all nations&quot;, and pirates are often detained, interrogated, disarmed, and released. With millions of dollars at stake, pirates have little incentive to stop. In Finland, one case involved pirates who had been captured and whose boat was sunk. As the pirates attacked a vessel of Singapore, not Finland, and are not themselves EU or Finnish citizens, they were not prosecuted. A further complication in many cases, including this one, is that many countries do not allow extradition of people to jurisdictions where they may be sentenced to death or torture.

The Dutch are using a 17th-century law against &quot;sea robbery&quot; to prosecute. Warships that capture pirates have no jurisdiction to try them, and NATO does not have a detention policy in place. Prosecutors have a hard time assembling witnesses and finding translators, and countries are reluctant to imprison pirates because the countries would be saddled with the pirates upon their release.

The Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia formed in November 2006.

Since the 2010s, the U.S. Navy and others have been developing artificial intelligence (AI)-based systems that generate piracy alerts based on surveillance data.

===Self-defense===
The fourth volume of the handbook: &quot;Best Management Practices to Deter Piracy off the Coast of Somalia and in the Arabian Sea Area&quot; (known as BMP4) is the current authoritative guide for merchant ships on self-defense against pirates. The guide is issued and updated by &quot;Oil Companies International Marine Forum&quot; (OCIMF), a consortium of interested international shipping and trading organizations including the EU, NATO and the International Maritime Bureau. It is distributed primarily by the Maritime Security Centre – Horn of Africa (MSCHOA), the planning and coordination authority for EU naval forces (EUNAVFOR).

The BMP4 encourages vessels to register their voyages through the region with MSCHOA, as this registration is a key component of the operation of the International Recommended Transit Corridor (IRTC, the navy-patrolled route through the Gulf of Aden). The BMP4 contains a chapter entitled &quot;Self-Protective Measures&quot; which lays out a list of steps a merchant vessel can take to make itself less of a target to pirates, and make it better able to repel an attack if one occurs. This list includes rigging the deck of the ship with razor wire, rigging fire-hoses to spray sea-water over the side of the ship to hinder boardings, having a distinctive pirate alarm, hardening the bridge against gunfire and creating a &quot;citadel&quot; where the crew can retreat if pirates get on board. Other unofficial self-defense measures that can be found on merchant vessels include the setting up of mannequins posing as armed guards or firing flares at the pirates.

Though it varies by country, generally peacetime law in the 20th and 21st centuries has not allowed merchant vessels to carry weapons. As a response to the rise in modern piracy, however, the U.S. government changed its rules so that it is now possible for U.S.-flagged vessels to embark a team of armed private security guards. The US Coastguard leaves it to ship owners&#x27; discretion to determine if those guards will be armed. The International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) in 2011 changed its stance on private armed guards, accepting that operators must be able to defend their ships against pirate attacks.

This has given birth to a new breed of private security companies that provide training for crew members and operate floating armouries for protection of crew and cargo. This has proved effective in countering pirate attacks. The use of floating armouries in international waters allows ships to carry weapons in international waters, without being in possession of arms within coastal waters where they would be illegal. Seychelles has become a central location for international anti-piracy operations, hosting the Anti-Piracy Operation Center for the Indian Ocean. In 2008, VSOS became the first authorized armed maritime security company to operate in the Indian Ocean region.

With safety trials complete in the late 2000s, laser dazzlers have been developed for defensive purposes on super-yachts. They can be effective up to with the effects going from mild disorientation to flash blindness at closer range.

In February 2012, Italian Marines based on the tanker &quot;Enrica Lexie&quot; allegedly fired on an Indian fishing trawler off Kerala, killing two of her eleven crew. The Marines allegedly mistook the fishing vessel as a pirate vessel. The incident sparked a diplomatic row between India and Italy. &quot;Enrica Lexie&quot; was ordered into Kochi where her crew were questioned by officers of the Indian Police. The fact is still &quot;sub juris&quot; and its legal eventual outcome could influence future deployment of VPDs, since states will be either encouraged or discouraged to provide them depending on whether functional immunity is ultimately granted or denied to the Italians.

Another similar incident has been reported to have happened in the Red Sea between the coasts of Somalia and Yemen, involving the death of a Yemeni fisherman allegedly at the hands of a Russian Vessel Protection Detachment (VPD) on board a Norwegian-flagged vessel.

Despite VPD deployment being controversial because of these incidents, according to the Associated Press, during a United Nations Security Council conference about piracy &quot;U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice told the council that no ship carrying armed guards has been successfully attacked by pirates&quot; and &quot;French Ambassador Gerard Araud stressed that private guards do not have the deterrent effect that government-posted marine and sailors and naval patrols have in warding off attacks&quot;.

===Self protection measures===
The best protection against pirates is to avoid encountering them. This can be accomplished by using tools such as radar, or by using specialised systems that use shorter wavelengths, as small boats are not always picked up by radar. An example of a specialised system is WatchStander.

While the non-wartime 20th century tradition has been for merchant vessels not to be armed, the U.S. Government has recently changed the rules so that it is now &quot;best practice&quot; for vessels to embark a team of armed private security guards. The guards are usually supplied from ships intended specifically for training and supplying such armed personnel. The crew can be given weapons training, and warning shots can be fired legally in international waters.

Other measures vessels can take to protect themselves against piracy are air-pressurised boat stopping systems which can fire a variety of vessel-disabling projectiles, implementing a high freewall and vessel boarding protection systems (e.g., hot water wall, electricity-charged water wall, automated fire monitor, slippery foam). Ships can also attempt to protect themselves using their Automatic Identification Systems (AIS). Every ship over 300 tons carries a transponder supplying both information about the ship itself and its movements. Any unexpected change in this information can attract attention.

Previously this data could only be picked up if there was a nearby ship, rendering single ships vulnerable. Special satellites have been launched recently that are now able to detect and retransmit this data. Large ships cannot therefore be hijacked without being detected. This can act as a deterrent to attempts to either hijack the entire ship, or steal large portions of cargo with another ship, since an escort can be sent more quickly.

===Patrol===
In an emergency warships can be called upon. In some areas such as near Somalia, patrolling naval vessels from different nations are available to intercept vessels attacking merchant vessels. For patrolling dangerous coastal waters, or keeping cost down, robotic or remote-controlled USVs are also sometimes used. Shore- and vessel-launched UAVs are used by the U.S. Navy. A British former British chief of defence staff (David Richards), questioned the value of expensive kit procured by successive governments, saying &quot;We have £1bn destroyers trying to sort out pirates in a little dhow with RPGs [rocket-propelled grenade launchers] costing US$50, with an outboard motor [costing] $100&quot;.

==Legal aspects==

===United Kingdom laws===

Section 2 of the Piracy Act 1837 creates a statutory offence of aggravated piracy. See also the Piracy Act 1850.

In 2008 the British Foreign Office advised the Royal Navy not to detain pirates of certain nationalities as they might be able to claim asylum in Britain under British human rights legislation, if their national laws included execution, or mutilation as a judicial punishment for crimes committed as pirates.

====Definition of piracy jure gentium====
See section 26 of, and Schedule 5 to, the Merchant Shipping and Maritime Security Act 1997. These provisions replace the Schedule to the Tokyo Convention Act 1967. In &quot;Cameron v HM Advocate&quot;, 1971 SLT 333, the High Court of Justiciary said that that Schedule supplemented the existing law and did not seek to restrict the scope of the offence of piracy jure gentium.

*&quot;Re Piracy Jure Gentium&quot; [1934] AC 586, PC
*&quot;Attorney General of Hong Kong v Kwok-a-Sing&quot; (1873) LR 5 PC 179

====Jurisdiction====
See section 46(2) of the Senior Courts Act 1981 and section 6 of the Territorial Waters Jurisdiction Act 1878. See also &quot;R v Kohn&quot; (1864) 4 F &amp; F 68.

====Piracy committed by or against aircraft====

See section 5 of the Aviation Security Act 1982.

====Sentence====
The book &quot;Archbold&quot; says that in a case that does not fall within section 2 of the Piracy Act 1837, the penalty appears to be determined by the Offences at Sea Act 1799, which provides that offences committed at sea are liable to the same penalty as if they had been committed upon the shore.

====History====
William Hawkins said that under common law, piracy by a subject was esteemed to be petty treason. The Treason Act 1351 provided that this was not petty treason.

In English admiralty law, piracy was classified as petty treason during the medieval period, and offenders were accordingly liable to be hanged, drawn and quartered on conviction. Piracy was redefined as a felony during the reign of Henry VIII. In either case, piracy cases were cognizable in the courts of the Lord High Admiral. English judges in admiralty courts and vice admiralty courts emphasized that &quot;neither Faith nor Oath is to be kept&quot; with pirates; i.e. contracts with pirates and oaths sworn to them were not legally binding. Pirates were legally subject to summary execution by their captors if captured in battle. In practice, instances of summary justice and annulment of oaths and contracts involving pirates do not appear to have been common.

===United States laws===
In the United States, criminal prosecution of piracy is authorized in the U.S. Constitution, Art. I Sec. 8 cl. 10:
The founding fathers were at loggerheads over piracy. and the Marshall Court (1801-1835) dealt with many cases of piracy. In 1820 the penalty for piracy was death. By 1909 the penalty was life imprisonment. Title now states:

Citing the United States Supreme Court decision in the 1820 case of &quot;United States v. Smith (1820)&quot;, a U.S. District Court ruled in 2010 in the case of &quot;United States v. Said&quot; that the definition of piracy under section 1651 is confined to &quot;robbery at sea&quot;. The piracy charges (but not other serious federal charges) against the defendants in the &quot;Said&quot; case were dismissed by the Court.

The U.S. District Court for the E.D.Va. has since been overturned: &quot;On May 23, 2012, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit issued an opinion vacating the Court&#x27;s dismissal of the piracy count. &quot;United States v. Said&quot;, 680 F.3d 374 (4th Cir.2012). See also &quot;United States v. Dire&quot;, 680 F.3d 446, 465 (4th Cir.2012) (upholding an instruction to the jury that the crime of piracy includes &#x27;any of the three following actions: (A) any illegal acts of violence or detention or any act of depredation committed for private ends on the high seas or a place outside the jurisdiction of any state by the crew or the passengers of a private ship and directed against another ship or against persons or property on board such ship; or (B) any act of voluntary participation in the operation of a ship with knowledge of facts making it a pirate ship; or (C) any act of inciting or of intentionally facilitating an act described in (A) or (B) above&quot;). The case was remanded to E.D. Va., see &quot;US v. Said&quot;, 3 F. Supp. 3d 515 – Dist. Court, ED Virginia (2014).

===International law===
====Effects on international boundaries====
During the 18th century, the British and the Dutch controlled opposite sides of the Straits of Malacca. The British and the Dutch drew a line separating the Straits into two halves. The agreement was that each party would be responsible for combating piracy in their respective half. Eventually this line became the border between Malaysia and Indonesia in the Straits.

====Law of nations====

Piracy is of note in international law as it is commonly held to represent the earliest invocation of the concept of universal jurisdiction. The crime of piracy is considered a breach of , a conventional peremptory international norm that states must uphold. Those committing thefts on the high seas, inhibiting trade, and endangering maritime communication are considered by sovereign states to hold the status of (an enemy of humankind).

Because of universal jurisdiction, action can be taken against pirates without objection from the flag state of the pirate vessel. This represents an exception to the principle (&quot;One who exercises jurisdiction out of his territory is disobeyed with impunity&quot;).

A Convention on Piracy was adopted by the League of Nations in 1932. To this day, the Harvard Draft adds to the debate of what constitutes piracy.

====International conventions====

====Articles 101 to 103 of UNCLOS====

Articles 101 to 103 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) (1982) contain a definition of piracy &quot;iure gentium&quot; (i.e. according to international law). They read:
Article 101

&quot;Definition of piracy&quot;

Piracy consists of any of the following acts:
*(a) any illegal acts of violence or detention, or any act of depredation, committed for private ends by the crew or the passengers of a private ship or a private aircraft, and directed—
**(i) on the high seas, against another ship or aircraft, or against persons or property on board such ship or aircraft;
**(ii) against a ship, aircraft, persons or property in a place outside the jurisdiction of any State;
*(b) any act of voluntary participation in the operation of a ship or of an aircraft with knowledge of facts making it a pirate ship or aircraft;
*(c) any act of inciting or of intentionally facilitating an act described in subparagraph (a) or (b).

Article 102

&quot;Piracy by a warship, government ship or government aircraft whose crew has mutinied&quot;

The acts of piracy, as defined in article 101, committed by a warship, government ship or government aircraft whose crew has mutinied and taken control of the ship or aircraft are assimilated to acts committed by a private ship or aircraft.

Article 103

&quot;Definition of a pirate ship or aircraft&quot;

A ship or aircraft is considered a pirate ship or aircraft if it is intended by the persons in dominant control to be used for the purpose of committing one of the acts referred to in article 101. The same applies if the ship or aircraft has been used to commit any such act, so long as it remains under the control of the persons guilty of that act.
This definition was formerly contained in articles 15 to 17 of the Convention on the High Seas signed at Geneva on April 29, 1958. It was drafted by the International Law Commission.

A limitation of article 101 above is that it confines piracy to the High Seas. As the majority of piratical acts occur within territorial waters, some pirates are able to go free as certain jurisdictions lack the resources to monitor their borders adequately.

====IMB definition====
The International Maritime Bureau (IMB) defines piracy as:

====Uniformity in maritime piracy law====
Given the diverging definitions of piracy in international and municipal legal systems, some authors argue that greater uniformity in the law is required in order to strengthen anti-piracy legal instruments.

==Cultural perceptions==
Pirates are a frequent topic in fiction and, in their Caribbean incarnation, are associated with certain stereotypical manners of speaking and dress, some of them wholly fictional: &quot;nearly all our notions of their behavior come from the golden age of fictional piracy, which reached its zenith in 1881 with the appearance of Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Treasure Island&quot;.&quot; Hugely influential in shaping the popular conception of pirates, Captain Charles Johnson&#x27;s &quot;A General History of the Pyrates&quot;, published in London in 1724, is the prime source for the biographies of many well known pirates of the Golden Age. The book gives an almost mythical status to pirates, with naval historian David Cordingly writing: &quot;it has been said, and there seems no reason to question this, that Captain Johnson created the modern conception of pirates.&quot;
In the 1830s, Letitia Elizabeth Landon received material relating to piracy for an annual for which she was responsible and she produced two Pirate Songs, the first in 1831, and the second, in 1837. This last was reproduced many times as &#x27;The Pirate&#x27;s Song&#x27;, often uncredited. Bona is now the city of Annaba in Algeria.

Some inventions of pirate culture such as &quot;walking the plank&quot;—in which a bound captive is forced to walk off a board extending over the sea—were popularized by J. M. Barrie&#x27;s 1911 novel, &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, where the fictional pirate Captain Hook and his crew helped define the fictional pirate archetype. English actor Robert Newton&#x27;s portrayal of Long John Silver in Disney&#x27;s 1950 film adaptation also helped define the modern rendition of a pirate, including the stereotypical West Country &quot;pirate accent&quot;. Other influences include &quot;Sinbad the Sailor&quot;, and the &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; films have helped rekindle modern interest in piracy and have performed well at the box office. The video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed IV: Black Flag&quot; also revolves around pirates during the Golden Age of Piracy.

The classic 1879 Gilbert and Sullivan comic opera &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; focuses on The Pirate King and his hapless band of pirates.

Many sports teams use &quot;pirate&quot; or a related term such as &quot;raider&quot; or &quot;buccaneer&quot; as their nickname, based on the popular stereotypes of pirates. The earliest such example was probably the Pittsburgh Pirates of Major League Baseball that acquired their nickname in 1891 after allegedly &quot;pirating&quot; a player from another team. Many amateur and school-based sports programs along with several professional sports franchises have also adopted pirate-related names, including the Las Vegas Raiders and Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the National Football League. In turn, the Buccaneer&#x27;s name was inspired by the Gasparilla Pirate Festival, a large community parade and related events in Tampa, Florida centered around the legend of José Gaspar, a mythical pirate who supposedly operated in the area.

== Economics of piracy ==

Sources on the economics of piracy include Cyrus Karraker&#x27;s 1953 study &quot;Piracy was a Business&quot;,
in which the author discusses pirates in terms of contemporary racketeering. Patrick Crowhurst researched French piracy and David Starkey focused on British 18th-century piracy. Note also the 1998 book &quot;The Invisible Hook: The Hidden Economics of Pirates&quot; by Peter T. Leeson.

=== Piracy and entrepreneurship ===

Some 2014 research examines the links between piracy and entrepreneurship. In this context, researchers take a nonmoral approach to piracy as a source of inspiration for 2010s-era entrepreneurship education and to research in entrepreneurship and in business-model generation.

In this respect, analysis of piracy operations may distinguish between planned (organised) and opportunistic piracy.

<text>The quantum harmonic oscillator is the quantum-mechanical analog of the classical harmonic oscillator. Because an arbitrary smooth potential can usually be approximated as a harmonic potential at the vicinity of a stable equilibrium point, it is one of the most important model systems in quantum mechanics. Furthermore, it is one of the few quantum-mechanical systems for which an exact, analytical solution is known.

==One-dimensional harmonic oscillator== 

===Hamiltonian and energy eigenstates===

The Hamiltonian of the particle is:
formula_1

The functions &quot;Hn&quot; are the physicists&#x27; Hermite polynomials,
formula_2

The corresponding energy levels are
formula_3The expectation values of position and momentum combined with variance of each variable can be derived from the wavefunction to understand the behavior of the energy eigenkets. They are shown to be formula_4 and formula_5 owing to the symmetry of the problem, whereas:

formula_6

formula_7

The variance in both position and momentum are observed to increase for higher energy levels. The lowest energy level has value of formula_8 which is its minimum value due to uncertainty relation and also corresponds to a gaussian wavefunction.

This energy spectrum is noteworthy for three reasons. First, the energies are quantized, meaning that only discrete energy values (integer-plus-half multiples of ) are possible; this is a general feature of quantum-mechanical systems when a particle is confined. Second, these discrete energy levels are equally spaced, unlike in the Bohr model of the atom, or the particle in a box. Third, the lowest achievable energy (the energy of the state, called the ground state) is not equal to the minimum of the potential well, but above it; this is called zero-point energy. Because of the zero-point energy, the position and momentum of the oscillator in the ground state are not fixed (as they would be in a classical oscillator), but have a small range of variance, in accordance with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

The ground state probability density is concentrated at the origin, which means the particle spends most of its time at the bottom of the potential well, as one would expect for a state with little energy. As the energy increases, the probability density peaks at the classical &quot;turning points&quot;, where the state&#x27;s energy coincides with the potential energy. (See the discussion below of the highly excited states.) This is consistent with the classical harmonic oscillator, in which the particle spends more of its time (and is therefore more likely to be found) near the turning points, where it is moving the slowest. The correspondence principle is thus satisfied. Moreover, special nondispersive wave packets, with minimum uncertainty, called coherent states oscillate very much like classical objects, as illustrated in the figure; they are &quot;not&quot; eigenstates of the Hamiltonian.

===Ladder operator method===
The &quot;ladder operator&quot; method, developed by Paul Dirac, allows extraction of the energy eigenvalues without directly solving the differential equation. It is generalizable to more complicated problems, notably in quantum field theory. Following this approach, we define the operators and its adjoint ,
formula_9Note these operators classically are exactly the generators of normalized rotation in the phase space of formula_10 and formula_11, &quot;i.e&quot; they describe the forwards and backwards evolution in time of a classical harmonic oscillator.

These operators lead to the following representation of formula_12 and formula_13,
formula_14

The operator is not Hermitian, since itself and its adjoint are not equal. The energy eigenstates , when operated on by these ladder operators, give
formula_15

From the relations above, we can also define a number operator , which has the following property:
formula_16

The following commutators can be easily obtained by substituting the canonical commutation relation,
formula_17

and the Hamilton operator can be expressed as
formula_18

so the eigenstates of are also the eigenstates of energy.
To see that, we can apply formula_19 to a number state formula_20:

formula_21

Using the property of the number operator formula_22:

formula_23

we get:

formula_24

Thus, since formula_20 solves the TISE for the Hamiltonian operator formula_19, is also one of its eigenstates with the corresponding eigenvalue:

formula_27

QED.

The commutation property yields
formula_28

and similarly,
formula_29

This means that acts on to produce, up to a multiplicative constant, , and acts on to produce . For this reason, is called an annihilation operator (&quot;lowering operator&quot;), and a creation operator (&quot;raising operator&quot;). The two operators together are called ladder operators. 

Given any energy eigenstate, we can act on it with the lowering operator, , to produce another eigenstate with less energy. By repeated application of the lowering operator, it seems that we can produce energy eigenstates down to . However, since
formula_30

the smallest eigenvalue of the number operator is 0, and
formula_31

In this case, subsequent applications of the lowering operator will just produce zero, instead of additional energy eigenstates. Furthermore, we have shown above that
formula_32

Finally, by acting on |0⟩ with the raising operator and multiplying by suitable normalization factors, we can produce an infinite set of energy eigenstates 
formula_33

such that
formula_34
which matches the energy spectrum given in the preceding section.

Arbitrary eigenstates can be expressed in terms of |0⟩,
formula_35
 a^\dagger \left| n - 1 \right\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n(n - 1)}} \left(a^\dagger\right)^2 \left| n - 2 \right\rangle = \cdots = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n!}} \left(a^\dagger\right)^n \left|0\right\rangle.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;}}

====Analytical questions====

The preceding analysis is algebraic, using only the commutation relations between the raising and lowering operators. Once the algebraic analysis is complete, one should turn to analytical questions. First, one should find the ground state, that is, the solution of the equation formula_36. In the position representation, this is the first-order differential equation
formula_37
whose solution is easily found to be the Gaussian
formula_38
Conceptually, it is important that there is only one solution of this equation; if there were, say, two linearly independent ground states, we would get two independent chains of eigenvectors for the harmonic oscillator. Once the ground state is computed, one can show inductively that the excited states are Hermite polynomials times the Gaussian ground state, using the explicit form of the raising operator in the position representation. One can also prove that, as expected from the uniqueness of the ground state, the Hermite functions energy eigenstates formula_39 constructed by the ladder method form a &quot;complete&quot; orthonormal set of functions.

Explicitly connecting with the previous section, the ground state |0⟩ in the position representation is determined by formula_40,
formula_41
formula_42
hence
formula_43
so that formula_44, and so on.

===Natural length and energy scales===
The quantum harmonic oscillator possesses natural scales for length and energy, which can be used to simplify the problem. These can be found by nondimensionalization.

The result is that, if &quot;energy&quot; is measured in units of and &quot;distance&quot; in units of , then the Hamiltonian simplifies to
formula_45
while the energy eigenfunctions and eigenvalues simplify to Hermite functions and integers offset by a half,
formula_46
formula_47
where are the Hermite polynomials.

To avoid confusion, these &quot;natural units&quot; will mostly not be adopted in this article. However, they frequently come in handy when performing calculations, by bypassing clutter.

For example, the fundamental solution (propagator) of , the time-dependent Schrödinger operator for this oscillator, simply boils down to the Mehler kernel,
formula_48
where . The most general solution for a given initial configuration then is simply
formula_49
===Coherent states===

The coherent states (also known as Glauber states) of the harmonic oscillator are special nondispersive wave packets, with minimum uncertainty , whose observables&#x27; expectation values evolve like a classical system. They are eigenvectors of the annihilation operator, &quot;not&quot; the Hamiltonian, and form an overcomplete basis which consequentially lacks orthogonality.

The coherent states are indexed by formula_50 and expressed in the basis as

formula_51

Since coherent states are not energy eigenstates, their time evolution is not a simple shift in wavefunction phase. The time-evolved states are, however, also coherent states but with phase-shifting parameter instead: formula_52.formula_53

Because formula_54 and via the Kermack-McCrae identity, the last form is equivalent to a unitary displacement operator acting on the ground state: formula_55. Calculating the expectation values:

formula_56

formula_57

where formula_58 is the phase contributed by complex . These equations confirm the oscillating behavior of the particle. 

The uncertainties calculated using the numeric method are:

formula_59

formula_60

which gives formula_61. Since the only wavefunction that can have lowest position-momentum uncertainty, formula_62, is a gaussian wavefunction, and since the coherent state wavefunction has minimum position-momentum uncertainty, we note that the general gaussian wavefunction in quantum mechanics has the form:formula_63Substituting the expectation values as a function of time, gives the required time varying wavefunction.

The probability of each energy eigenstates can be calculated to find the energy distribution of the wavefunction:

formula_64

which corresponds to Poisson distribution.

===Highly excited states===

When is large, the eigenstates are localized into the classical allowed region, that is, the region in which a classical particle with energy can move. The eigenstates are peaked near the turning points: the points at the ends of the classically allowed region where the classical particle changes direction. This phenomenon can be verified through asymptotics of the Hermite polynomials, and also through the WKB approximation. 

The frequency of oscillation at is proportional to the momentum of a classical particle of energy and position . Furthermore, the square of the amplitude (determining the probability density) is &quot;inversely&quot; proportional to , reflecting the length of time the classical particle spends near . The system behavior in a small neighborhood of the turning point does not have a simple classical explanation, but can be modeled using an Airy function. Using properties of the Airy function, one may estimate the probability of finding the particle outside the classically allowed region, to be approximately 
formula_65
This is also given, asymptotically, by the integral 
formula_66

===Phase space solutions===
In the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics, eigenstates of the quantum harmonic oscillator in several different representations of the quasiprobability distribution can be written in closed form. The most widely used of these is for the Wigner quasiprobability distribution.

The Wigner quasiprobability distribution for the energy eigenstate is, in the natural units described above,
formula_67
where &quot;Ln&quot; are the Laguerre polynomials. This example illustrates how the Hermite and Laguerre polynomials are linked through the Wigner map.

Meanwhile, the Husimi Q function of the harmonic oscillator eigenstates have an even simpler form. If we work in the natural units described above, we have
formula_68
This claim can be verified using the Segal–Bargmann transform. Specifically, since the raising operator in the Segal–Bargmann representation is simply multiplication by formula_69 and the ground state is the constant function 1, the normalized harmonic oscillator states in this representation are simply formula_70 . At this point, we can appeal to the formula for the Husimi Q function in terms of the Segal–Bargmann transform.

==&quot;N&quot;-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator==

The one-dimensional harmonic oscillator is readily generalizable to dimensions, where . In one dimension, the position of the particle was specified by a single coordinate, . In dimensions, this is replaced by position coordinates, which we label . Corresponding to each position coordinate is a momentum; we label these . The canonical commutation relations between these operators are
formula_71

The Hamiltonian for this system is
formula_72

As the form of this Hamiltonian makes clear, the -dimensional harmonic oscillator is exactly analogous to independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators with the same mass and spring constant. In this case, the quantities would refer to the positions of each of the particles. This is a convenient property of the potential, which allows the potential energy to be separated into terms depending on one coordinate each.

This observation makes the solution straightforward. For a particular set of quantum numbers formula_73 the energy eigenfunctions for the -dimensional oscillator are expressed in terms of the 1-dimensional eigenfunctions as:

formula_74

In the ladder operator method, we define sets of ladder operators,

formula_75

By an analogous procedure to the one-dimensional case, we can then show that each of the and operators lower and raise the energy by respectively. The Hamiltonian is
formula_76
This Hamiltonian is invariant under the dynamic symmetry group (the unitary group in dimensions), defined by
formula_77
where formula_78 is an element in the defining matrix representation of .

The energy levels of the system are
formula_79
formula_80

As in the one-dimensional case, the energy is quantized. The ground state energy is times the one-dimensional ground energy, as we would expect using the analogy to independent one-dimensional oscillators. There is one further difference: in the one-dimensional case, each energy level corresponds to a unique quantum state. In -dimensions, except for the ground state, the energy levels are &quot;degenerate&quot;, meaning there are several states with the same energy.

The degeneracy can be calculated relatively easily. As an example, consider the 3-dimensional case: Define . All states with the same will have the same energy. For a given , we choose a particular . Then . There are possible pairs . can take on the values to , and for each the value of is fixed. The degree of degeneracy therefore is:
formula_81
Formula for general and [ being the dimension of the symmetric irreducible -th power representation of the unitary group ]:
formula_82
The special case = 3, given above, follows directly from this general equation. This is however, only true for distinguishable particles, or one particle in dimensions (as dimensions are distinguishable). For the case of bosons in a one-dimension harmonic trap, the degeneracy scales as the number of ways to partition an integer using integers less than or equal to .

formula_83

This arises due to the constraint of putting quanta into a state ket where formula_84 and formula_85, which are the same constraints as in integer partition.

===Example: 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator===
The Schrödinger equation for a particle in a spherically-symmetric three-dimensional harmonic oscillator can be solved explicitly by separation of variables. This procedure is analogous to the separation performed in the hydrogen-like atom problem, but with a different spherically symmetric potential
formula_86
where is the mass of the particle. Because will be used below for the magnetic quantum number, mass is indicated by , instead of , as earlier in this article.

The solution to the equation is:
formula_87
where
:formula_88 is a normalization constant; formula_89;
:formula_90 
are generalized Laguerre polynomials; The order of the polynomial is a non-negative integer;
*formula_91 is a spherical harmonic function;
* is the reduced Planck constant: formula_92

The energy eigenvalue is
formula_93
The energy is usually described by the single quantum number
formula_94

Because is a non-negative integer, for every even we have and for every odd we have . The magnetic quantum number is an integer satisfying , so for every and &quot;ℓ&quot; there are 2&quot;ℓ&quot; + 1 different quantum states, labeled by . Thus, the degeneracy at level is
formula_95
where the sum starts from 0 or 1, according to whether is even or odd.
This result is in accordance with the dimension formula above, and amounts to the dimensionality of a symmetric representation of , the relevant degeneracy group.

==Applications==
===Harmonic oscillators lattice: phonons===
The notation of a harmonic oscillator can be extended to a one-dimensional lattice of many particles. Consider a one-dimensional quantum mechanical &quot;harmonic chain&quot; of &quot;N&quot; identical atoms. This is the simplest quantum mechanical model of a lattice, and we will see how phonons arise from it. The formalism that we will develop for this model is readily generalizable to two and three dimensions.

As in the previous section, we denote the positions of the masses by , as measured from their equilibrium positions (i.e. if the particle is at its equilibrium position). In two or more dimensions, the are vector quantities. The Hamiltonian for this system is

formula_96
where is the (assumed uniform) mass of each atom, and and are the position and momentum operators for the &quot;i&quot; th atom and the sum is made over the nearest neighbors (nn). However, it is customary to rewrite the Hamiltonian in terms of the normal modes of the wavevector rather than in terms of the particle coordinates so that one can work in the more convenient Fourier space.

We introduce, then, a set of &quot;normal coordinates&quot; , defined as the discrete Fourier transforms of the s, and &quot;conjugate momenta&quot; defined as the Fourier transforms of the s,
formula_97
formula_98

The quantity will turn out to be the wave number of the phonon, i.e. 2&quot;π&quot; divided by the wavelength. It takes on quantized values, because the number of atoms is finite.

This preserves the desired commutation relations in either real space or wave vector space

formula_99

From the general result
formula_100
it is easy to show, through elementary trigonometry, that the potential energy term is
formula_101
where
formula_102

The Hamiltonian may be written in wave vector space as
formula_103

Note that the couplings between the position variables have been transformed away; if the s and s were hermitian (which they are not), the transformed Hamiltonian would describe &quot;uncoupled&quot; harmonic oscillators.

The form of the quantization depends on the choice of boundary conditions; for simplicity, we impose &quot;periodic&quot; boundary conditions, defining the -th atom as equivalent to the first atom. Physically, this corresponds to joining the chain at its ends. The resulting quantization is

formula_104

The upper bound to comes from the minimum wavelength, which is twice the lattice spacing , as discussed above.

The harmonic oscillator eigenvalues or energy levels for the mode are 
formula_105

If we ignore the zero-point energy then the levels are evenly spaced at 
formula_106

So an exact amount of energy , must be supplied to the harmonic oscillator lattice to push it to the next energy level. In analogy to the photon case when the electromagnetic field is quantised, the quantum of vibrational energy is called a phonon.

All quantum systems show wave-like and particle-like properties. The particle-like properties of the phonon are best understood using the methods of second quantization and operator techniques described elsewhere.

In the continuum limit, , , while is held fixed. The canonical coordinates devolve to the decoupled momentum modes of a scalar field, formula_107, whilst the location index (&quot;not the displacement dynamical variable&quot;) becomes the parameter argument of the scalar field, formula_108.

===Molecular vibrations===

* The vibrations of a diatomic molecule are an example of a two-body version of the quantum harmonic oscillator. In this case, the angular frequency is given by formula_109 where formula_110 is the reduced mass and formula_111 and formula_112 are the masses of the two atoms.
* The Hooke&#x27;s atom is a simple model of the helium atom using the quantum harmonic oscillator.
* Modelling phonons, as discussed above.
* A charge formula_113 with mass formula_114 in a uniform magnetic field formula_115 is an example of a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator: Landau quantization.

<text>Buccaneers were a kind of privateer or free sailors, and pirates particular to the Caribbean Sea during the 17th and 18th centuries. First established on northern Hispaniola as early as 1625, their heyday was from the Restoration in 1660 until about 1688, during a time when governments in the Caribbean area were not strong enough to suppress them. Martinique was a home port for French buccaneers as well as pirates like Captain Crapeau.

Originally the name applied to the landless hunters of wild boars and cattle in the largely uninhabited areas of Tortuga and Hispaniola. The meat they caught was smoked over a slow fire in little huts the French called &quot;boucans&quot; to make &quot;viande boucanée&quot; – &quot;jerked meat&quot; or &quot;jerky&quot; – which they sold to the corsairs who preyed on the (largely Spanish) shipping and settlements of the Caribbean. Eventually the term was applied to the corsairs and (later) privateers themselves, also known as the Brethren of the Coast. Although corsairs, also known as &quot;filibusters&quot; or &quot;freebooters&quot;, were largely lawless, privateers were nominally licensed by the authorities – first the French, later the English and Dutch – to prey on the Spanish, until their depredations became so severe they were suppressed.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;buccaneer&quot; derives from the Caribbean Arawak word &quot;buccan&quot;, which refers to a wooden frame on which Tainos and Caribs slowly roasted or smoked meat, commonly manatee. The word was adopted into French as &quot;boucan&quot;, hence the name &quot;boucanier&quot; for French hunters who used such frames to smoke meat from feral cattle and pigs on Hispaniola. English colonists anglicised &quot;boucanier&quot; to &quot;buccaneer&quot;.

==History==

About 1630, French interlopers were driven away from the island of Hispaniola and fled to nearby Tortuga. French buccaneers were established on northern Hispaniola as early as 1625, but lived at first mostly as hunters rather than robbers; their transition to full-time piracy was gradual and motivated in part by Spanish efforts to wipe out both the buccaneers and the prey animals on which they depended. The buccaneers&#x27; migration from Hispaniola&#x27;s mainland to the more defensible offshore island of Tortuga limited their resources and accelerated their piratical raids. According to Alexandre Exquemelin, the Tortuga buccaneer Pierre Le Grand pioneered the settlers&#x27; attacks on galleons making the return voyage to Spain. The Spaniards also tried to drive them out of Tortuga, but the buccaneers were joined by many more French, Dutch, and English adventurers who turned to piracy. They set their eyes on Spanish shipping, generally using small craft to attack galleons in the vicinity of the Windward Passage. With the support and encouragement of rival European powers, they became strong enough to sail for the mainland of Spanish America, known as the Spanish Main, and sacked cities.

Perhaps what distinguished the buccaneers from earlier Caribbean sailors was their use of permanent bases in the West Indies. During the mid 17th century, the Bahama Islands attracted many lawless people who had taken over New Providence. Encouraged by its large harbour, they were joined by several pirates who made their living by raiding the Spanish on the coast of Cuba. They called this activity buccaneering. Their principal station was Tortuga, but from time to time they seized other strongholds, like Providence, and they were welcomed with their booty in ports like Port Royal in Jamaica. At first they were international. In 1663 it was estimated that there were fifteen of their ships with nearly a thousand men, English, French, and Dutch, belonging to Jamaica and Tortuga. As time went on and the European governments asserted their authority, the buccaneers first became separated by nationalities and then in time were suppressed altogether, leaving behind only dispersed bands of pirates.

The French buccaneers and settlers from Paris established a settlement which has now occupied Martinique, the French word for &quot;buccaneer&quot; was &quot;boucanier,&quot; which directly relates to the island as the term originates from the Caribbean Arawak word &quot;buccan,&quot; especially for the French pirates like Étienne de Montauban and Mathurin Desmarestz.

English settlers occupying Jamaica began to spread the name &quot;buccaneers&quot; with the meaning of pirates. The name became universally adopted later in 1684 when the first English translation of Alexandre Exquemelin&#x27;s book &quot;The Buccaneers of America&quot; was published.

Viewed from London, buccaneering was a budget way to wage war on England&#x27;s rival, Spain. The English crown licensed buccaneers with letters of marque, legalising their operations in return for a share of their profits. The buccaneers were invited by Jamaica&#x27;s Governor Thomas Modyford to base ships at Port Royal. The buccaneers robbed Spanish shipping and colonies, and returned to Port Royal with their plunder, making the city the most prosperous in the Caribbean. There were even Royal Navy officers sent to lead the buccaneers, such as Christopher Myngs. Their activities went on irrespective of whether England happened to be at war with Spain or France.

Among the leaders of the buccaneers were two Frenchmen, Jean-David Nau, better known as François l&#x27;Ollonais, and Daniel Montbars, who destroyed so many Spanish ships and killed so many Spaniards that he was called &quot;the Exterminator&quot;.

Another noted leader was Welshman Henry Morgan, who sacked Maracaibo, Portobello, and Panama City, stealing a huge amount from the Spanish. Morgan became rich and went back to England, where he was knighted by Charles II.

While the buccaneers were powerful it was not only hostility to Spain, but also lack of authority, that prevented the other states from ending the old state of affairs in which, even when they were at peace with Spain and Portugal in Europe, there was &#x27;no peace beyond the Line&#x27;. The West Indies were beyond the range of the European international system. Sometimes this was for their advantage but on the whole, with the intermingled possessions, trade rivalries, and disputes about territorial rights, the local conditions led to conflicts. The West Indies continued to be one of the centres of international strife throughout the eighteenth century although by that time it was regulated in the same way as in Europe, and had become inseparable from the European wars.

During the Second Anglo-Dutch War in 1665, de Ruyter attacked Barbados with a strong squadron, and the English had no choice but to base their defence on the buccaneers whom the governor of Jamaica had previously been trying to suppress. They were unmanageable and destroyed where they conquered, but they mastered the Dutch colonies of St. Eustatius and Tobago. In 1666, however, when the French joined the Dutch in the war, the weakness of this policy was proved. The English hoped to capture the French plantations of St. Kitts, where there were new settlers of both nations, and so they declined to make a new agreement for neutrality. They made what was intended to be a surprise attack, but was an ignominious failure, and the English settlers in the island had to surrender unconditionally. More than 8,000 of them were shipped away, and their property was seized by the French. Lord Willoughby, the able governor of Barbados, got together an expedition for a counter-stroke, but his fleet was broken up by a hurricane in which he perished. The French captured one island after another. In 1667 naval ships from England regained the command of the sea and made various conquests, but the Peace of Breda re-established the status quo in March of that year.

Henry Morgan was knighted in 1674 and became lieutenant-governor of Jamaica. In the late 1670s there was a succession of raids on Spanish ports. In 1680 a party made its way across the Isthmus of Panama and, sailing in captured Spanish ships, pillaged the coasts and commerce of the Pacific. They had not been long on their journey when the Anglo-Spanish treaty of 1680 was signed, which at last stipulated for a real peace beyond the Line and indirectly recognised the right of the English to trade in West Indian waters. When the buccaneers returned by way of Cape Horn in 1682, the survivors found themselves treated as pirates. The French, within a very few years, also controlled their buccaneers, and in the Nine Years&#x27; War (1688-1697) they were no longer an important factor. Until about 1688 the governments were not strong enough, and did not consistently attempt, to suppress the buccaneers.

In January 1684, Havana responded to the attacks by the buccaneers of the Bahamas in the event known as the Raid on Charles Town.

In the 1690s, the old buccaneering ways began to die out, as European governments began to discard the policy of &quot;no peace beyond the Line&quot;. Buccaneers were hard to control; some even embroiled their colonies in unwanted wars. Notably, at the 1697 joint French-buccaneer siege of Cartagena, led by Bernard Desjean, Baron de Pointis, the buccaneers and the French regulars parted on extremely bitter terms. Less tolerated by local Caribbean officials, buccaneers increasingly turned to legal work or else joined regular pirate crews who sought plunder in the Indian Ocean, the east coast of North America, or West Africa as well as in the Caribbean.

==Legal status==

Sometimes the buccaneers held more or less regular commissions as privateers, and they always preyed upon the Spaniards; but often they became mere pirates and plundered any nation. As a rule, the buccaneers called themselves privateers, and many sailed under the protection of a letter of marque granted by British, French or Dutch authorities. For example, Henry Morgan had some form of legal cover for all of his attacks, and expressed great indignation at being called a &quot;corsair&quot; by the governor of Panama. Nevertheless, these rough men had little concern for legal niceties, and exploited every opportunity to pillage Spanish targets, whether or not a letter of marque was available. Many of the letters of marque used by buccaneers were legally invalid, and any form of legal paper in that illiterate age might be passed off as a letter of marque. Furthermore, even those buccaneers who had valid letters of marque often failed to observe their terms. The legal status of buccaneers was still further obscured by the practice of the Spanish authorities, who regarded them as heretics and interlopers, and thus hanged or garroted captured buccaneers entirely without regard to whether their attacks were licensed by French or English monarchs.

Simultaneously, French and English governors tended to turn a blind eye to the buccaneers&#x27; depredations against the Spanish, even when unlicensed. But as Spanish power waned toward the end of the 17th century, the buccaneers&#x27; attacks began to disrupt France and England&#x27;s merchant traffic with Spanish America, such that merchants who had previously regarded the buccaneers as a defence against Spain now saw them as a threat to commerce, and colonial authorities grew hostile. This change in political atmosphere, more than anything else, put an end to buccaneering.

==Lifestyle==
A hundred years before the French Revolution, the buccaneer companies were run on lines in which liberty, equality and fraternity were the rule. In a buccaneer camp, the captain was elected and could be deposed by the votes of the crew. The crew, and not the captain, decided whether to attack a particular ship, or a fleet of ships. Spoils were evenly divided into shares; the captain received an agreed amount for the ship, plus a portion of the share of the prize money, usually five or six shares.

Crews generally had no regular wages, being paid only from their shares of the plunder, a system called &quot;no purchase, no pay&quot; by Modyford or &quot;no prey, no pay&quot; by Enqueueing. There was a strong &quot;esprit&quot; among buccaneers. This, combined with overwhelming numbers, allowed them to win battles and raids. There was also, for some time, a social insurance system guaranteeing compensation for battle wounds at a worked-out scale.

==Warfare==

===Naval===
Buccaneers initially used small boats to attack Spanish galleons surreptitiously, often at night, and climb aboard before the alarm could be raised. Buccaneers were expert marksmen and would quickly kill the helmsman and any officers aboard. Buccaneers&#x27; reputation as cruel pirates grew to the point that, eventually, most victims would surrender, hoping they would not be killed.

===Land===
When buccaneers raided towns, they did not sail into port and bombard the defences, as naval forces typically did. Instead, they secretly beached their ships out of sight of their target, marched overland, and attacked the towns from the landward side, which was usually less fortified. Their raids relied mainly on surprise and speed. The sack of Campeche was considered the first such raid and many others that followed replicated the same techniques including the attack on Veracruz in 1683 and the raid on Cartagena later that same year.

==Downturn==

Spanish authorities always viewed buccaneers as trespassers and a threat to their hegemony in the Caribbean basin, and over the second half of the 17th century, other European powers learned to perceive them in the same way. These new powers had appropriated and secured territories in the area and needed to protect them. Buccaneers who did not settle down on agriculture or some other acceptable business after the so-called Golden Age of Piracy proved a nuisance to them, too. Spanish anti-pirate practices became thus a model for all recently arrived colonial governments. Some expanded them.

==Punishments==

When caught by anti-pirate English authorities, 17th and 18th century buccaneers received justice in a summary fashion, and many ended their lives by &quot;dancing the hempen jig&quot;, a euphemism for hanging. Public executions were a form of entertainment, and people came out to watch them as they would for a sporting event today. Newspapers reported details such as condemned men&#x27;s last words, the prayers said by the priests, and descriptions of their final moments in the gallows. In England, most executions took place at Execution Dock on the River Thames in London.

In the cases of more famous prisoners, usually captains, their punishments extended beyond death. Their bodies were enclosed in iron cages (for which they were measured before their execution) and left to swing in the air until the flesh rotted off them—a process that could take as long as two years. The bodies of captains such as William &quot;Captain&quot; Kidd, Charles Vane, William Fly, and Jack Rackham (&quot;Calico Jack&quot;) were all treated this way.

It is doubtful many buccaneers got off with just a time in the pillory. However, a pirate who was flogged could very well spend some time in the pillory after being beaten. &quot;The most common shaming punishment was confinement in the pillory often with symbols of their crimes.&quot;

==In literature==
After the threat began to abate, literature brought buccaneers to glory as example of virility and self-reliance. Daniel Defoe’s works like &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; (1719), &quot;Captain Singleton&quot; (1720), and &quot;A General History of the Pyrates&quot; (1724) (purportedly written by Defoe) set the tone for the glamorous ways in which later generations would perceive them.

<doc id="50722" wikidata="Q42247" url="?curid=50722" title="Sully Prudhomme">
<text>René François Armand &quot;Sully&quot; Prudhomme (; 16 March 1839 – 6 September 1907) was a French poet and essayist. He was the first winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1901.

Born in Paris, Prudhomme originally studied to be an engineer, but turned to philosophy and later to poetry; he declared it as his intention to create scientific poetry for modern times. In character sincere and melancholic, he was linked to the Parnassus school, although, at the same time, his work displays characteristics of its own.

==Early life==
Prudhomme&#x27;s parents were M. Sully Prudhomme and Clotilde Caillat. They had been engaged for 10 years before they had felt financially able to marry. When Prudhomme was two, his father, a shopkeeper, died. His mother and he relocated to Prudhomme&#x27;s uncle&#x27;s house. Prudhomme joined his father&#x27;s name &quot;Sully&quot; with his surname Prudhomme, becoming Sully-Prudhomme. He was interested in classic literature and mathematics in school. He also considered entering the Dominican order, but decided against it.

Prudhomme attended the Lycée Bonaparte, but eye trouble interrupted his studies. He worked for a while in the Creusot region for the Schneider steel foundry, and then began studying law in a notary&#x27;s office. The favourable reception of his early poems by the &quot;Conférence La Bruyère&quot; (a student society) encouraged him to begin a literary career.

==Writing==
His first collection, &quot;Stances et Poèmes&quot; (&quot;Stanzas and Poems&quot;, 1865), was praised by Sainte-Beuve. It included his most famous poem, &quot;Le vase brisé&quot;. He published more poetry before the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War. This war, which he discussed in &quot;Impressions de la guerre&quot; (1872) and &quot;La France&quot; (1874), permanently damaged his health.

During his career, Prudhomme gradually shifted from the sentimental style of his first books towards a more personal style which unified the formality of the Parnassus school with his interest in philosophical and scientific subjects. One of his inspirations was clearly Lucretius&#x27;s &quot;De rerum natura&quot;, whose first book he translated into verse. His philosophy was expressed in &quot;La Justice&quot; (1878) and &quot;Le Bonheur&quot; (1888). The extreme economy of means employed in these poems has, however, usually been judged as compromising their poetical quality without advancing their claims as works of philosophy. He was elected to the Académie française in 1881. Another distinction, &quot;Chevalier de la Légion d’honneur&quot;, was to follow in 1895.

After &quot;Le Bonheur&quot;, Prudhomme turned from poetry to write essays on aesthetics and philosophy. He published two important essays: &quot;L&#x27;Expression dans les beaux-arts&quot; (1884) and &quot;Réflexions sur l&#x27;art des vers&quot; (1892), a series of articles on Blaise Pascal in &quot;La Revue des Deux Mondes&quot; (1890), and an article on free will (&quot;La Psychologie du Libre-Arbitre&quot;, 1906) in the &quot;Revue de métaphysique et de morale&quot;.

==Nobel Prize==

The first writer to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature (given &quot;in special recognition of his poetic composition, which gives evidence of lofty idealism, artistic perfection and a rare combination of the qualities of both heart and intellect&quot;), he devoted the bulk of the money he received to the creation of a poetry prize awarded by the &quot;Société des gens de lettres&quot;. He also founded, in 1902, the &quot;Société des poètes français&quot; with Jose-Maria de Heredia and Leon Dierx.

==Death==

At the end of his life, his poor health (which had troubled him ever since 1870) forced him to live almost as a recluse at Châtenay-Malabry, suffering attacks of paralysis while continuing to work on essays. He died suddenly on 6 September 1907, and was buried at Père-Lachaise in Paris.

<text>In probability theory, there exist several different notions of convergence of sequences of random variables, including &quot;convergence in probability&quot;, &quot;convergence in distribution&quot;, and &quot;almost sure convergence&quot;. The different notions of convergence capture different properties about the sequence, with some notions of convergence being stronger than others. For example, convergence in distribution tells us about the limit distribution of a sequence of random variables. This is a weaker notion than convergence in probability, which tells us about the value a random variable will take, rather than just the distribution.

The concept is important in probability theory, and its applications to statistics and stochastic processes. The same concepts are known in more general mathematics as stochastic convergence and they formalize the idea that certain properties of a sequence of essentially random or unpredictable events can sometimes be expected to settle down into a behavior that is essentially unchanging when items far enough into the sequence are studied. The different possible notions of convergence relate to how such a behavior can be characterized: two readily understood behaviors are that the sequence eventually takes a constant value, and that values in the sequence continue to change but can be described by an unchanging probability distribution.

==Background==
&quot;Stochastic convergence&quot; formalizes the idea that a sequence of essentially random or unpredictable events can sometimes be expected to settle into a pattern. The pattern may for instance be
*Convergence in the classical sense to a fixed value, perhaps itself coming from a random event
*An increasing similarity of outcomes to what a purely deterministic function would produce
*An increasing preference towards a certain outcome
*An increasing &quot;aversion&quot; against straying far away from a certain outcome
*That the probability distribution describing the next outcome may grow increasingly similar to a certain distribution

Some less obvious, more theoretical patterns could be
*That the series formed by calculating the expected value of the outcome&#x27;s distance from a particular value may converge to 0
*That the variance of the random variable describing the next event grows smaller and smaller.
These other types of patterns that may arise are reflected in the different types of stochastic convergence that have been studied.

While the above discussion has related to the convergence of a single series to a limiting value, the notion of the convergence of two series towards each other is also important, but this is easily handled by studying the sequence defined as either the difference or the ratio of the two series.

For example, if the average of &quot;n&quot; independent random variables formula_1, all having the same finite mean and variance, is given by

:formula_2

then as formula_3 tends to infinity, formula_4 converges &quot;in probability&quot; (see below) to the common mean, formula_5, of the random variables formula_6. This result is known as the weak law of large numbers. Other forms of convergence are important in other useful theorems, including the central limit theorem.

Throughout the following, we assume that formula_7 is a sequence of random variables, and formula_8 is a random variable, and all of them are defined on the same probability space formula_9.

== Convergence in distribution ==
{\sigma}(X_n-\mu)&lt;/math&gt; will be converging in distribution to the standard normal, the result that follows from the celebrated central limit theorem.
 | header5 = Graphic example
 | data6 = Suppose is an iid sequence of uniform random variables. Let formula_10 be their (normalized) sums. Then according to the central limit theorem, the distribution of approaches the normal distribution. This convergence is shown in the picture: as grows larger, the shape of the probability density function gets closer and closer to the Gaussian curve.

Loosely, with this mode of convergence, we increasingly expect to see the next outcome in a sequence of random experiments becoming better and better modeled by a given probability distribution. More precisely, the distribution of the associated random variable in the sequence becomes arbitrarily close to a specified fixed distribution.

Convergence in distribution is the weakest form of convergence typically discussed, since it is implied by all other types of convergence mentioned in this article. However, convergence in distribution is very frequently used in practice; most often it arises from application of the central limit theorem.

===Definition===
A sequence formula_11 of real-valued random variables, with cumulative distribution functions formula_12, is said to converge in distribution, or converge weakly, or converge in law to a random variable with cumulative distribution function if

: formula_13

for every number formula_14 at which formula_15 is continuous.

The requirement that only the continuity points of formula_15 should be considered is essential. For example, if formula_4 are distributed uniformly on intervals formula_18, then this sequence converges in distribution to the degenerate random variable formula_19. Indeed, formula_20 for all formula_21 when formula_22, and formula_23 for all formula_24when formula_25. However, for this limiting random variable formula_26, even though formula_27 for all formula_3. Thus the convergence of cdfs fails at the point formula_29 where formula_30 is discontinuous.

Convergence in distribution may be denoted as

\ X,\ \ 
 X_n \ \xrightarrow{\mathcal{L}}\ X,\ \ 
 X_n \ \xrightarrow{d}\ \mathcal{L}_X, \\
 &amp; X_n \rightsquigarrow X,\ \ 
 X_n \Rightarrow X,\ \ 
 \mathcal{L}(X_n)\to\mathcal{L}(X),\\ 
 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where formula_31 is the law (probability distribution) of . For example, if is standard normal we can write formula_32.

For random vectors formula_33 the convergence in distribution is defined similarly. We say that this sequence converges in distribution to a random -vector if
: formula_34
for every formula_35 which is a continuity set of .

The definition of convergence in distribution may be extended from random vectors to more general random elements in arbitrary metric spaces, and even to the “random variables” which are not measurable — a situation which occurs for example in the study of empirical processes. This is the “weak convergence of laws without laws being defined” — except asymptotically.

In this case the term weak convergence is preferable (see weak convergence of measures), and we say that a sequence of random elements converges weakly to (denoted as ) if
: formula_36
for all continuous bounded functions . Here E* denotes the &quot;outer expectation&quot;, that is the expectation of a “smallest measurable function that dominates ”.

===Properties===
* Since formula_37, the convergence in distribution means that the probability for to be in a given range is approximately equal to the probability that the value of is in that range, provided is sufficiently large.
*In general, convergence in distribution does not imply that the sequence of corresponding probability density functions will also converge. As an example one may consider random variables with densities . These random variables converge in distribution to a uniform &quot;U&quot;(0, 1), whereas their densities do not converge at all.
** However, according to &quot;Scheffé’s theorem&quot;, convergence of the probability density functions implies convergence in distribution.
* The portmanteau lemma provides several equivalent definitions of convergence in distribution. Although these definitions are less intuitive, they are used to prove a number of statistical theorems. The lemma states that converges in distribution to if and only if any of the following statements are true:
** formula_38 for all continuity points of formula_39;
** formula_40 for all bounded, continuous functions formula_41 (where formula_42 denotes the expected value operator);
** formula_40 for all bounded, Lipschitz functions formula_41;
** formula_45 for all nonnegative, continuous functions formula_41;
** formula_47 for every open set formula_48;
** formula_49 for every closed set formula_50;
** formula_51 for all continuity sets formula_52 of random variable formula_53;
** formula_54 for every upper semi-continuous function formula_41 bounded above;
** formula_56 for every lower semi-continuous function formula_41 bounded below.
* The continuous mapping theorem states that for a continuous function , if the sequence converges in distribution to , then converges in distribution to .
** Note however that convergence in distribution of to and to does in general &quot;not&quot; imply convergence in distribution of to or of to .
* Lévy’s continuity theorem: The sequence converges in distribution to if and only if the sequence of corresponding characteristic functions converges pointwise to the characteristic function of .
* Convergence in distribution is metrizable by the Lévy–Prokhorov metric.
* A natural link to convergence in distribution is the Skorokhod&#x27;s representation theorem.

== Convergence in probability ==
The basic idea behind this type of convergence is that the probability of an “unusual” outcome becomes smaller and smaller as the sequence progresses.

The concept of convergence in probability is used very often in statistics. For example, an estimator is called consistent if it converges in probability to the quantity being estimated. Convergence in probability is also the type of convergence established by the weak law of large numbers.

=== Definition ===
A sequence {&quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;} of random variables converges in probability towards the random variable &quot;X&quot; if for all &quot;ε&quot; &gt; 0

: formula_58

More explicitly, let &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;ε&quot;) be the probability that &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; is outside the ball of radius &quot;ε&quot; centered at &quot;X&quot;. Then is said to converge in probability to &quot;X&quot; if for any and any &quot;δ&quot; &gt; 0 there exists a number &quot;N&quot; (which may depend on &quot;ε&quot; and &quot;δ&quot;) such that for all &quot;n&quot; ≥ &quot;N&quot;, &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;ε&quot;) &lt; &quot;δ&quot; (the definition of limit).

Notice that for the condition to be satisfied, it is not possible that for each &quot;n&quot; the random variables &quot;X&quot; and &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; are independent (and thus convergence in probability is a condition on the joint cdf&#x27;s, as opposed to convergence in distribution, which is a condition on the individual cdf&#x27;s), unless &quot;X&quot; is deterministic like for the weak law of large numbers. At the same time, the case of a deterministic &quot;X&quot; cannot, whenever the deterministic value is a discontinuity point (not isolated), be handled by convergence in distribution, where discontinuity points have to be explicitly excluded.

Convergence in probability is denoted by adding the letter &quot;p&quot; over an arrow indicating convergence, or using the &quot;plim&quot; probability limit operator:
\, X_n = X.&lt;/math&gt;|}}

For random elements {&quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;} on a separable metric space , convergence in probability is defined similarly by
: formula_59

===Properties===
* Convergence in probability implies convergence in distribution.[proof]
* In the opposite direction, convergence in distribution implies convergence in probability when the limiting random variable &quot;X&quot; is a constant.[proof]
* Convergence in probability does not imply almost sure convergence.[proof]
* The continuous mapping theorem states that for every continuous function formula_60, if formula_61, then also 
* Convergence in probability defines a topology on the space of random variables over a fixed probability space. This topology is metrizable by the &quot;Ky Fan metric&quot;: formula_62 or alternately by this metric formula_63

===Counterexamples===
Not every sequence of random variables which converges to another random variable in distribution also converges in probability to that random variable. As an example, consider a sequence of standard normal random variables formula_64 and a second sequence formula_65. Notice that the distribution of formula_66 is equal to the distribution of formula_64 for all formula_68, but:
formula_69

which does not converge to formula_70. So we do not have convergence in probability.

== Almost sure convergence ==
This is the type of stochastic convergence that is most similar to pointwise convergence known from elementary real analysis.

===Definition===
To say that the sequence converges almost surely or almost everywhere or with probability 1 or strongly towards &quot;X&quot; means that
formula_71

This means that the values of approach the value of &quot;X&quot;, in the sense that events for which does not converge to &quot;X&quot; have probability 0 (see &quot;Almost surely&quot;). Using the probability space formula_9 and the concept of the random variable as a function from Ω to R, this is equivalent to the statement
formula_73

Using the notion of the limit superior of a sequence of sets, almost sure convergence can also be defined as follows:
formula_74

Almost sure convergence is often denoted by adding the letters &quot;a.s.&quot; over an arrow indicating convergence:
 \, X.}&lt;/math&gt;|}}

For generic random elements {&quot;Xn&quot;} on a metric space formula_75, convergence almost surely is defined similarly:
formula_76

===Properties===
* Almost sure convergence implies convergence in probability (by Fatou&#x27;s lemma), and hence implies convergence in distribution. It is the notion of convergence used in the strong law of large numbers.
* The concept of almost sure convergence does not come from a topology on the space of random variables. This means there is no topology on the space of random variables such that the almost surely convergent sequences are exactly the converging sequences with respect to that topology. In particular, there is no metric of almost sure convergence.

===Counterexamples===
Consider a sequence formula_77 of independent random variables such that formula_78 and formula_79. For formula_80 we have formula_81 which converges to formula_70 hence formula_83 in probability.

Since formula_84 and the events formula_85 are independent, second Borel Cantelli Lemma ensures that formula_86 hence the sequence formula_77 does not converge to formula_70 almost everywhere (in fact the set on which this sequence does not converge to formula_70 has probability formula_90).

== Sure convergence or pointwise convergence ==
To say that the sequence of random variables (&quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;) defined over the same probability space (i.e., a random process) converges surely or everywhere or pointwise towards &quot;X&quot; means

formula_91

where Ω is the sample space of the underlying probability space over which the random variables are defined.

This is the notion of pointwise convergence of a sequence of functions extended to a sequence of random variables. (Note that random variables themselves are functions).

formula_92

Sure convergence of a random variable implies all the other kinds of convergence stated above, but there is no payoff in probability theory by using sure convergence compared to using almost sure convergence. The difference between the two only exists on sets with probability zero. This is why the concept of sure convergence of random variables is very rarely used.

== Convergence in mean ==
Given a real number , we say that the sequence converges in the &quot;r&quot;-th mean (or in the &quot;Lr&quot;-norm) towards the random variable &quot;X&quot;, if the -th absolute moments formula_42(|&quot;Xn&quot;|&quot;r &quot;) and formula_42(|&quot;X&quot;|&quot;r &quot;) of and &quot;X&quot; exist, and
: formula_95
where the operator E denotes the expected value. Convergence in -th mean tells us that the expectation of the -th power of the difference between formula_64 and formula_53 converges to zero.

This type of convergence is often denoted by adding the letter &quot;Lr&quot; over an arrow indicating convergence:

The most important cases of convergence in &quot;r&quot;-th mean are:
* When converges in &quot;r&quot;-th mean to &quot;X&quot; for &quot;r&quot; = 1, we say that converges in mean to &quot;X&quot;.
* When converges in &quot;r&quot;-th mean to &quot;X&quot; for &quot;r&quot; = 2, we say that converges in mean square (or in quadratic mean) to &quot;X&quot;.

Convergence in the &quot;r&quot;-th mean, for &quot;r&quot; ≥ 1, implies convergence in probability (by Markov&#x27;s inequality). Furthermore, if &quot;r&quot; &gt; &quot;s&quot; ≥ 1, convergence in &quot;r&quot;-th mean implies convergence in &quot;s&quot;-th mean. Hence, convergence in mean square implies convergence in mean.

Additionally, 
: formula_98
The converse is not necessarily true, however it is true if formula_99 (by a more general version of Scheffé&#x27;s lemma).

==Properties==
Provided the probability space is complete:
* If formula_100 and formula_101, then formula_102 almost surely.
* If formula_103 and formula_104, then formula_102 almost surely.
* If formula_106 and formula_107, then formula_102 almost surely.
* If formula_100 and formula_110, then formula_111 (for any real numbers and ) and formula_112.
* If formula_103 and formula_114, then formula_115 (for any real numbers and ) and formula_116.
* If formula_106 and formula_118, then formula_119 (for any real numbers and ).
* None of the above statements are true for convergence in distribution.
The chain of implications between the various notions of convergence are noted in their respective sections. They are, using the arrow notation:

: formula_120

These properties, together with a number of other special cases, are summarized in the following list:

* Almost sure convergence implies convergence in probability:[proof]
*:formula_121
* Convergence in probability implies there exists a sub-sequence formula_122 which almost surely converges: 
*: formula_123
* Convergence in probability implies convergence in distribution:[proof]
*: formula_124
* Convergence in &quot;r&quot;-th order mean implies convergence in probability:
*: formula_125
* Convergence in &quot;r&quot;-th order mean implies convergence in lower order mean, assuming that both orders are greater than or equal to one:
*: formula_126 provided &quot;r&quot; ≥ &quot;s&quot; ≥ 1.
* If &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; converges in distribution to a constant &quot;c&quot;, then &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; converges in probability to &quot;c&quot;:[proof]
*: formula_127 provided &quot;c&quot; is a constant.
* If converges in distribution to &quot;X&quot; and the difference between &quot;Xn&quot; and &quot;Yn&quot; converges in probability to zero, then &quot;Yn&quot; also converges in distribution to &quot;X&quot;:[proof]
*: formula_128
* If converges in distribution to &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Yn&quot; converges in distribution to a constant &quot;c&quot;, then the joint vector converges in distribution to :[proof]
*: formula_129 provided &quot;c&quot; is a constant.
*:Note that the condition that converges to a constant is important, if it were to converge to a random variable &quot;Y&quot; then we wouldn&#x27;t be able to conclude that converges to .
* If &quot;Xn&quot; converges in probability to &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Yn&quot; converges in probability to &quot;Y&quot;, then the joint vector converges in probability to :[proof]
*: formula_130
* If converges in probability to &quot;X&quot;, and if for all &quot;n&quot; and some &quot;b&quot;, then converges in &quot;r&quot;th mean to &quot;X&quot; for all . In other words, if converges in probability to &quot;X&quot; and all random variables are almost surely bounded above and below, then converges to &quot;X&quot; also in any &quot;r&quot;th mean.
* Almost sure representation. Usually, convergence in distribution does not imply convergence almost surely. However, for a given sequence {&quot;Xn&quot;} which converges in distribution to &quot;X&quot;0 it is always possible to find a new probability space (Ω, &quot;F&quot;, P) and random variables {&quot;Yn&quot;, &quot;n&quot; = 0, 1, ...} defined on it such that &quot;Yn&quot; is equal in distribution to for each , and &quot;Yn&quot; converges to &quot;Y&quot;0 almost surely.
* If for all &quot;ε&quot; &gt; 0,
*::formula_131
*:then we say that &quot;converges almost completely&quot;, or &quot;almost in probability&quot; towards &quot;X&quot;. When converges almost completely towards &quot;X&quot; then it also converges almost surely to &quot;X&quot;. In other words, if converges in probability to &quot;X&quot; sufficiently quickly (i.e. the above sequence of tail probabilities is summable for all ), then also converges almost surely to &quot;X&quot;. This is a direct implication from the Borel–Cantelli lemma.
* If is a sum of &quot;n&quot; real independent random variables:
*::formula_132
*:then converges almost surely if and only if converges in probability. The proof can be found in Page 126 (Theorem 5.3.4) of the book by Kai Lai Chung.
*:However, for a sequence of mutually independent random variables, convergence in probability does not imply almost sure convergence.
* The dominated convergence theorem gives sufficient conditions for almost sure convergence to imply &quot;L&quot;1-convergence:
 X \\
 |X_n| &lt; Y \\
 \mathbb{E}[Y] &lt; \infty 
\end{matrix}\right\} \quad\Rightarrow \quad X_n\xrightarrow X &lt;/math&gt;|}}

*A necessary and sufficient condition for &quot;L&quot;1 convergence is formula_133 and the sequence (&quot;Xn&quot;) is uniformly integrable.
*If formula_134, the followings are equivalent
**formula_106,
**formula_136,
**formula_137 is uniformly integrable.

<text>Extreme value theory or extreme value analysis (EVA) is the study of extremes in statistical distributions.

It is widely used in many disciplines, such as structural engineering, finance, economics, earth sciences, traffic prediction, and geological engineering. For example, EVA might be used in the field of hydrology to estimate the probability of an unusually large flooding event, such as the 100-year flood. Similarly, for the design of a breakwater, a coastal engineer would seek to estimate the 50 year wave and design the structure accordingly.

==Data analysis==
Two main approaches exist for practical extreme value analysis.

The first method relies on deriving block maxima (minima) series as a preliminary step. In many situations it is customary and convenient to extract the annual maxima (minima), generating an &quot;annual maxima series&quot; (AMS).

The second method relies on extracting, from a continuous record, the peak values reached for any period during which values exceed a certain threshold (falls below a certain threshold). This method is generally referred to as the &quot;peak over threshold&quot; method (POT).

For AMS data, the analysis may partly rely on the results of the Fisher–Tippett–Gnedenko theorem, leading to the generalized extreme value distribution being selected for fitting. However, in practice, various procedures are applied to select between a wider range of distributions. The theorem here relates to the limiting distributions for the minimum or the maximum of a very large collection of independent random variables from the same distribution. Given that the number of relevant random events within a year may be rather limited, it is unsurprising that analyses of observed AMS data often lead to distributions other than the &quot;generalized extreme value distribution&quot; (GEVD) being selected.

For POT data, the analysis may involve fitting two distributions: One for the number of events in a time period considered and a second for the size of the exceedances.

A common assumption for the first is the Poisson distribution, with the generalized Pareto distribution being used for the exceedances. 
A tail-fitting can be based on the Pickands–Balkema–de Haan theorem.

Novak (2011) reserves the term &quot;POT method&quot; to the case where the threshold is non-random, and distinguishes it from the case where one deals with exceedances of a random threshold.

==Applications==
Applications of extreme value theory include predicting the probability distribution of:

* Extreme floods; the size of freak waves
* Tornado outbreaks
* Maximum sizes of ecological populations
* Side effects of drugs (e.g., ximelagatran)
* The magnitudes of large insurance losses
* Equity risks; day-to-day market risk
* Mutation events during evolution
* Large wildfires
* Environmental loads on structures
* Time the fastest humans could ever run the 100 metres sprint and performances in other athletic disciplines
* Pipeline failures due to pitting corrosion
* Anomalous IT network traffic, prevent attackers from reaching important data
* Road safety analysis
* Wireless communications
* Epidemics
* Neurobiology
* Solar energy
* Extreme Space weather
==History==
The field of extreme value theory was pioneered by L. Tippett (1902–1985). Tippett was employed by the British Cotton Industry Research Association, where he worked to make cotton thread stronger. In his studies, he realized that the strength of a thread was controlled by the strength of its weakest fibres. With the help of R.A. Fisher, Tippet obtained three asymptotic limits describing the distributions of extremes assuming independent variables. E.J. Gumbel (1958) codified this theory. These results can be extended to allow for slight correlations between variables, but the classical theory does not extend to strong correlations of the order of the variance. One universality class of particular interest is that of &quot;log-correlated&quot; fields, where the correlations decay logarithmically with the distance.

==Univariate theory==

The theory for extreme values of a single variable is governed by the &quot;extreme value theorem&quot;, also called the &quot;Fisher–Tippett–Gnedenko theorem&quot;, which describes which of the three possible distributions for extreme values applies for a particular statistical variable formula_1 which is summarized in this section.

==Multivariate theory==
Extreme value theory in more than one variable introduces additional issues that have to be addressed. One problem that arises is that one must specify what constitutes an extreme event.
Although this is straightforward in the univariate case, there is no unambiguous way to do this in the multivariate case. The fundamental problem is that although it is possible to order a set of real-valued numbers, there is no natural way to order a set of vectors.

As an example, in the univariate case, given a set of observations formula_2 it is straightforward to find the most extreme event simply by taking the maximum (or minimum) of the observations. However, in the bivariate case, given a set of observations formula_3, it is not immediately clear how to find the most extreme event. Suppose that one has measured the values formula_4 at a specific time and the values formula_5 at a later time. Which of these events would be considered more extreme? There is no universal answer to this question.

Another issue in the multivariate case is that the limiting model is not as fully prescribed as in the univariate case. In the univariate case, the model (GEV distribution) contains three parameters whose values are not predicted by the theory and must be obtained by fitting the distribution to the data. In the multivariate case, the model not only contains unknown parameters, but also a function whose exact form is not prescribed by the theory. However, this function must obey certain constraints.
It is not straightforward to devise estimators that obey such constraints though some have been recently constructed.

As an example of an application, bivariate extreme value theory has been applied to ocean research.

==Non-stationary extremes==
Statistical modeling for nonstationary time series was developed in the 1990s. Methods for nonstationary multivariate extremes have been introduced more recently.
The latter can be used for tracking how the dependence between extreme values changes over time, or over another covariate.

<text>Prabuty () is a town in Kwidzyn County within the Pomeranian Voivodeship of northern Poland. It is the seat of Gmina Prabuty.

== Geographical location ==
Prabuty is located between the Liwieniec and Sowica lakes, approximately 18 kilometers east of Kwidzyn, 100 kilometers southeast of Gdańsk, 100 kilometers west of Olsztyn, and 133 kilometers southwest of Kaliningrad.

Prabuty is a rail junction on the Warsaw–Gdynia railway.

==History==

In 1236, the Teutonic Knights under Henry III, Margrave of Meissen, destroyed an Old Prussian fortress between the lakes Dzierzgoń and Liwieniec. The settlement was first mentioned in 1250 as &quot;Riesenburg&quot;. Albert, the Bishop of Pomesania, founded the castle and town in 1270 and moved his seat there. It would remain the primary seat of the Bishop of Pomesania until the diocese dissolved in 1587. The village grew around the castle and received Culm law city rights on 30 October 1330 from bishop Rudolf of Pomerania (1322–1332). The town suffered a fire in August 1375. The Lithuanian dukes Švitrigaila and Vaidutis visited the town in 1379 and 1381 respectively. In 1410 and 1414 it was captured by the Poles.

Knights and squires of the Prabuty district were co-founders of the anti-Teutonic Prussian Confederation in 1440. Since its establishment, part of the population wanted the town to join the organization. In 1451, the town council eventually joined the Prussian Confederation, but bishop Kaspar Linke expelled the councilors and confiscated their property. The town was accepted again by the organization in February 1454, and upon the request of the organization, in March 1454, Polish King Casimir IV Jagiellon incorporated the region and town to the Kingdom of Poland, and the Thirteen Years&#x27; War broke out. The Bishop and canons of Pomesania also pledged allegiance to the Polish King. Around that time, the town was mentioned in documents as &quot;Prabuth&quot;. After the Battle of Chojnice, in which Polish forces were defeated, the town was forced to side with the Order again. After the war and the Second Peace of Thorn (1466), the town became a part of Poland as a fief, and Pomesanian bishops retained their rule over the area. In 1523, the diocese of Pomesania became Lutheran. In 1525 the town became part of Ducal Prussia, a vassal state of Poland. In 1556, a synod was held in the town. In 1587, with the secularization of the diocese of Pomesania, the town lost its status as the episcopal seat.

The town suffered during the 17th century Polish-Swedish wars. In 1628, half of it was burnt down, and in 1688 the remainder was burned. In 1722, fire caused destruction once again.

In 1701, as part of Ducal Prussia, the town became a part of the Kingdom of Prussia and part of the newly created province of West Prussia in 1773. Despite this, as of 1789, Polish Protestant church services were still held in the town, and there was a Polish municipal school there. In October 1831, several Polish cavalry and infantry units and honor guards of the November Uprising stopped in the town on the way to their internment places. In 1871, the town became part of the German Empire in the framework of the Prussian-led unification of Germany. Until 1919, Riesenburg belonged to the administrative district of Regierungsbezirk Marienwerder in the Province of West Prussia.

After World War I, a referendum was held concerning the future nationality of the town, which remained part of Weimar Germany. From 1920 to 1939, Riesenburg belonged to the administrative district of Regierungsbezirk Westpreußen in the Province of East Prussia and from 1939 until 1945 to the district of Regierungsbezirk Marienwerder in the province of Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia.

During World War II Germany operated a prisoner-of-war camp in the town. The town was captured by the Soviet Red Army in 1945 in the final months of the war. It then became again part of Poland. Most of the German inhabitants were expelled in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement and the pre-war Polish population was joined by Poles displaced from former eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union.

Heinz Heydrich (1905–44), brother of Reinhard Heydrich, is buried in the local military cemetery, according to the Deutsche Dienststelle (WASt).

<doc id="50739" wikidata="Q214410" url="?curid=50739" title="Iaido">
<text>, abbreviated , is a Japanese martial art that emphasizes being aware and capable of quickly drawing the sword and responding to sudden attacks.

Iaido consists of four main components: the smooth, controlled movements of drawing the sword from its scabbard (or saya), striking or cutting an opponent, shaking blood from the blade, and replacing the sword in the scabbard. While beginning practitioners of iaido may start learning with a wooden sword (bokutō 木刀) depending on the teaching style of a particular instructor, most of the practitioners use a blunt-edged sword called an iaitō or &quot;mogitō&quot;. Few, more experienced, iaido practitioners use a sharp-edged sword (&quot;shinken&quot;).

Practitioners of iaido are called &quot;iaidoka&quot;.

==Origins of the name==
The term &quot;iaido&quot; appears in 1932 and consists of the kanji (i), (ai), and (dō). The origin of the first two characters, , is believed to come from saying , which can be roughly translated as &quot;being constantly (prepared), match/meet (the opposition) immediately&quot;. Thus the primary emphasis in &#x27;iai&#x27; is on the psychological state of being present (居). The secondary emphasis is on drawing the sword and responding by harmonising with a sudden attack as quickly as possible (合).

The last character, , is generally translated into English as the way or path. The term &quot;iaido&quot; approximately translates into English as &quot;the way of and immediate reaction&quot;, and was popularized by Nakayama Hakudo.

The term emerged from iaijutsu and the general trend to replace the suffix (&quot;the art of&quot;) with in Japanese martial arts in order to emphasize the philosophical or spiritual aspects of the practice.

==Purpose==
Iaido encompasses hundreds of styles of swordsmanship, all of which subscribe to non-combative aims and purposes. Iaido is an intrinsic form of Japanese modern budo.

Iaido is a reflection of the morals of the classical warrior and to build a spiritually harmonious person possessed of high intellect, sensitivity, and resolute will.
Iaido is for the most part performed solo as an issue of kata, executing changed strategies against single or various fanciful rivals. Every kata starts and finishes with the sword sheathed. Regardless of the sword method, creative ability and concentration are required to maintain the feeling of a genuine battle and to keep the kata new. Iaidoka are often expected to practice kendo to maintain the combative spirit. It is normal for high-ranking kendoka to hold high rank in iaido as well, and vice versa.

To perform the kata appropriately, iaidoka likewise learn carriage, development, grip and swing. At times iaidoka will practice complementary kata from kendo or kenjutsu. Unlike kendo, iaido practice never involves sparring.

==Moral and religious influences==
The metaphysical aspects of iaido have been influenced by several philosophical and religious currents. Iaido blends the ethics of Confucianism, methods of Zen, philosophical Taoism, the purifying rites of Shinto and aspects of bushido.

==Tōhō-gata techniques==

A set of five koryu iaido forms
# &quot;Mae-giri&quot; from Musō Jikiden Eishin-ryū School
# &quot;Zengo-giri&quot; from Mugai-ryū School
# &quot;Kiri-age&quot; from Shindō Munen-ryū School
# &quot;Shihō-giri&quot; from Suiō-ryū School
# &quot;Kissaki-gaeshi&quot; from Hōki-ryū School

==Seitei-gata techniques==
The 12 official kata currently recognised by the All Japan Kendo Federation are (in Romanised form):
# &quot;Mae&quot;
# &quot;Ushiro&quot;
# &quot;Ukenagashi&quot;
# &quot;Tsuka-ate&quot;
# &quot;Kesagiri&quot;
# &quot;Morote-tsuki&quot;
# &quot;Sanpōgiri&quot;
# &quot;Ganmen-ate&quot;
# &quot;Soete-zuki&quot;
# &quot;Shihōgiri&quot;
# &quot;Sōgiri&quot;
# &quot;Nukiuchi&quot;

Because iaido is practiced with a weapon, it is almost entirely practiced using solitary forms, or kata performed against one or more imaginary opponents. Multiple-person kata exist in some schools of iaido; for safety, iaidoka usually use bokken for such kata practice. Iaido does include competition in the form of kata, but does not use sparring of any kind. Because of this non-fighting practice, and iaido&#x27;s emphasis on precise, controlled, fluid motion, it is sometimes referred to as &quot;moving Zen.&quot; Most of the styles and schools do not practice &quot;tameshigiri&quot;, cutting techniques.

A part of iaido is &quot;nukitsuke&quot;. This is a quick draw of the sword, accomplished by simultaneously drawing the sword from the &quot;saya&quot; and also moving the &quot;saya&quot; back in &quot;saya-biki&quot;.

==History==
Iaido started in the mid-1500s. Hayashizaki Jinsuke Shigenobu (1542 - 1621) is generally acknowledged as the organizer of Iaido. There were many different Koryu (customary schools), however just a few remain practiced today. Just about every one of them additionally concentrate on more seasoned school created amid 16-seventeenth century, in the same way as Muso-Shinden-ryu, Hoki-ryu, Muso-Jikiden-Eishin-ryu, Shinto-Munen-ryu, Tamiya-ryu, Yagyu-Shinkage-ryu, Mugai-ryu, Sekiguchi-ryu, et cetera.

After the collapse of the Japanese feudal system in 1868, the founders of the modern disciplines borrowed from the theory and the practice of classical disciplines as they had studied or practiced. The founding in 1895 of the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai (DNBK) 大日本武徳会 (lit. &quot;Greater Japan Martial Virtue Society&quot;) in Kyoto, Japan. was also an important contribution to the development of modern Japanese swordsmanship. In 1932 DNBK officially approved and recognized the Japanese discipline, &quot;iaido&quot;; this year was the first time the term &quot;iaido&quot; appeared in Japan. After this initiative the modern forms of swordsmanship is organised in several iaido organisations. During the post-war occupation of Japan, the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai and its affiliates were disbanded by the Allies of World War II in the period 1945–1950. However, in 1950, the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai was reestablished and the practice of the Japanese martial disciplines began again.

The (ZNIR) was founded in 1948.

In 1952, the (IMAF) was founded in Tokyo, Japan. IMAF is a Japanese organization promoting international Budō, and has seven divisions representing the various Japanese martial arts, including iaido.

Also in 1952, the All Japan Kendo Federation (ZNKR) was founded.

Upon formation of various organizations overseeing martial arts, a problem of commonality appeared. Since members of the organization were drawn from various backgrounds, and had experience practicing different schools of iaido, there arose a need for a common set of kata, that would be known by all members of organization, and that could be used for fair grading of practitioner&#x27;s skill. Two of the largest Japanese organizations, All Japan Kendo Federation (ZNKR) and All Japan Iaido Federation (ZNIR), each created their own representative set of kata for this purpose.

==Kata under the respective iaido organizations==

===Tōhō Iaido===
The All Japan Iaido Federation (ZNIR, &quot;Zen Nihon Iaido Renmei&quot;, founded 1948) has a set of five koryu iaido forms, called Tōhō, contributed from the five major schools whose teachers were involved in the creation of the organization.

*Musō Jikiden Eishin-ryū School founded during the late Muromachi period (). (&#x27;Mae-giri&#x27;)
*Mugai-ryū School founded in 1695. (&#x27;Zengo-giri&#x27;)
*Shindō Munen-ryū School founded in the early 1700s. (&#x27;Kiri-age&#x27;)
*Suiō-ryū School founded during the late Sengoku period (). (&#x27;Shihō-giri&#x27;)
*Hōki-ryū School founded during the late Muromachi period (). (&#x27;Kissaki-gaeshi&#x27;)

===Seitei Iaido===
Seitei or Zen Nippon Kendo Renmei Iaido (制定) are technical forms based on &quot;seitei-gata&quot;, or standard forms of sword-drawing techniques, created by the Zen Nihon Kendo Renmei (All Japan Kendo Federation). This standard set of iaido kata was created in 1969 by a committee formed by the All Japan Kendo Federation (AJKF, &quot;Zen Nippon Kendo Renmei&quot; or ZNKR).
The twelve Seitei iaido forms (&quot;seitei-gata&quot;) are standardised for the tuition, promotion and propagation of iaido at the iaido clubs, that are members of the regional Kendo federations. All dojos, that are members of the regional Kendo federations teach this set. Since member federations of International Kendo Federation (FIK) uses seitei gata as a standard for their iaido exams and &quot;shiai&quot;, &quot;seitei iaido&quot; has become the most widely practised form of iaido in Japan and the rest of the world.

====Other organizations====
Single-style federations usually do not have a standardized &quot;grading&quot; set of kata, and use kata from their koryu curriculum for grading and demonstrations.

==Schools==
Many iaido organisations promote sword technique from the seiza (sitting position) and refer to their art as &quot;iaido&quot;. One of the popular versions of these is the Musō Shinden-ryū 夢想神伝流, an iaido system created by Nakayama Hakudō (1872–1958) in 1932. The Musō Shinden-ryū is an interpretation of one of the Jinsuke-Eishin lines, called Shimomura-ha.

The other line of Jinsuke-Eishin, called Tanimura-ha, was created by Gotō Magobei Masasuke (died 1898) and Ōe Masaji Shikei (1852–1927). It was Ōe Masaji Shikei who began formally referring to his iaido branch as the Musō Jikiden Eishin-ryū 無双直伝英信流 during the Taishō era (1912–1926).

Another popular iai school mostly found worldwide is Mugai ryu. Mugai-ryū (無外流) or &quot;Outer Nothingness School&quot; is a Japanese koryū martial art school founded by Tsuji Gettan Sukemochi (辻月丹資茂) on 23 June 1680. Its formal name is Mugai Shinden Kenpō (無外真伝剣法).
Actually in the beginning, Mugai Ryu started as kenjutsu only school, but sent and recommended its disciples to learn another koryu named &quot;Jikyo-ryu iaijutsu&quot;, and after Jikyo ryu vanished without any successor. It is renamed Mugai ryu iaijutsu/iaido up until today.
Another popular Iaido school is Toyama-ryū (戸山流), which was established in 1925 in Japan. It was created by the Japanese army during World War II to create a simplified form. This style emphasizes the most important aspects of drawing and cutting. After the war it became obsolete, but was revived after 1952.

==Ranks==

Ranking in iaido depends on the school and/or the member federations to which a particular school belongs. Iaido as it is practiced by the International Kendo Federation (FIK) and All Japan Iaido Federation (ZNIR) uses the kyu-dan system, created in 1883.

Modern kendo is almost entirely governed by the FIK, including the ranking system.
Iaido is commonly associated with either the FIK or the ZNIR, although there are many extant koryū which may potentially use the menkyo system of grading, or a different system entirely. Iaido as governed by the FIK establishes 10th dan as the maximum attainable rank, though there are no living 10th practitioners in Kendo, there still remains many in Iaido. While there are some living 9th dan practitioners of kendo, the All Japan Kendo Federation only currently awards up to 8th dan. Most other member federations of the FIK have followed suit.

==International Iaido Sport Competition==
Iaido, in its modern form, is practiced as a competitive sport, separately regulated by the All Japan Kendo Federation and All Japan Iaido Federations.

An iaido competition consists of two or more iaidoka performing their kata next to each other and simultaneously. The competitors will be judged by a panel of judges according to the standardized regulations.

The European Kendo Federation has arranged European iaido championships since 1993, and this competition continues to be held every year with a few exceptions.

== Organisations ==
Many national and regional organisations manage and promote iaido activities. The following is a list of international organisations which include iaido:

Dai Nippon Butoku Kai (DNBK), established in 1895 in Kyoto, approved and recognized the discipline iaido.

The International Martial Arts Federation (IMAF) was established in Kyoto in 1952 and is dedicated to the promotion and development of the martial arts worldwide, including iaido.

International Kendo Federation (FIK), established in 1970, an international organization for Kendo, Iaido and Jodo practitioners, which many national Kendo federations are a member of.

All Japan Iaido Federation (or Zen Nippon Iaido Renmei) (ZNIR) was established in 1954 &quot;in accordance with the Japanese bushido spirit to pass on the time-honoured system of Kobudo Iaido&quot;.

The World Musō Jikiden Eishin-ryū Iaido Federation, established in Tokyo in 2011, is dedicated to ensuring the orthodox transmission of MJER Iaido to future generations worldwide, as well as promoting and preserving the development of other schools.

Zen Nihon Toyama Ryu Iaido Renmei (ZNTIR) established in Machida Japan after WW II was created as &quot;Toyama-Ryu Shinko kai&quot; established by Tokutomi Tasaburo and Nakamura Taizaburo who were Gunto Soho instructors at the Toyama Ryu Military Academy for the Japanese Imperial Army. Over time the &quot;Toyama-Ryu Shinko-Kai&quot; was renamed as Zen Nihon Toyama Ryu Iaido Renmei, and practice eight kata from a derivative of Gunto Soho.

Iaido is part of Kendo na hÉireann, the Irish Kendo Federation, which supports Kendo, Iaido, and Jodo. Founded in 1998, the federation is affiliated with the Irish Martial Arts Commission (IMAC), the European Kendo Federation, and the International Kendo Federation, with dojos in counties such as Cavan, Cork, Dublin, and Galway. In July 2014, the federation held its first Iaido Kyu Grading, marking an important step in the growth of ZNKR (aka &quot;Seitei Iai&quot;) in Ireland, with five candidates participating. A decade later, in December 2024, Ireland’s first Shodan (1st Dan) grading took place in Dublin.

Several other dojos across Ireland offer Iaido training:
* Kenseikai Ireland Iaido Dojo — a Dublin-based dojo practicing Musō Jikiden Eishin-ryū. 

* Ojika NI Dojo is located in Belfast, Northern Ireland, this dojo practices modern Seitei Iaido for gradings and competitions, as well as the classical Muso Jikiden Eishin Ryu style.

<text>The —&quot;large and small&quot;—is a Japanese term for a matched pair of traditionally made Japanese swords worn by the samurai class in feudal Japan.

The etymology of the word &quot;daishō&quot; becomes apparent when the terms &quot;daitō&quot;, meaning long sword, and &quot;shōtō&quot;, meaning short sword, are used; daitō&quot; + shōtō&quot; = &quot;daishō&quot;. A &quot;daishō&quot; is typically depicted as a &quot;katana&quot; and &quot;wakizashi&quot; (or a &quot;tantō&quot;) mounted in matching &quot;koshirae&quot;, but originally the &quot;daishō&quot; was the wearing of any long and short &quot;katana&quot; together. The &quot;katana/wakizashi&quot; pairing is not the only &quot;daishō&quot; combination as generally any longer sword paired with a &quot;tantō&quot; is considered to be a &quot;daishō&quot;. &quot;Daishō&quot; eventually came to mean two swords having a . A &quot;daishō&quot; could also have matching blades made by the same swordsmith, but this was in fact uncommon and not necessary for two swords to be considered to be a &quot;daishō&quot;, as it would have been more expensive for a samurai.

==History==
The concept of the &quot;daisho&quot; originated with the pairing of a short sword with whatever long sword was being worn during a particular time period. The &quot;tachi&quot; would be paired with a &quot;tantō&quot;, and later the &quot;katana&quot; would be paired with another shorter katana called a &quot;chiisagatana&quot;. With the advent of the &quot;katana&quot;, the &quot;wakizashi&quot; eventually was chosen by samurai as the short sword over the &quot;tantō&quot;. Kanzan Satō, in his book titled &quot;The Japanese Sword&quot;, notes that there did not seem to be any particular need for the &quot;wakizashi&quot; and suggests that the &quot;wakizashi&quot; may have become more popular than the &quot;tantō&quot; as the &quot;wakizashi&quot; was more suited for indoor fighting. He mentions the custom of leaving the &quot;katana&quot; at the door of a castle or palace when entering while continuing to wear the &quot;wakizashi&quot; inside.

&quot;Daishō&quot; may have become popular around the end of the Muromachi period (1336 to 1573) as several early examples date from the late 16th century. An edict in 1629 defining the duties of a samurai required that &quot;daishō&quot; be worn when on official duty. Wearing &quot;daishō&quot; was limited to the &quot;samurai&quot; class in 1683, and became a symbol of their rank Samurai could wear decorative swords in daily life, but the Tokugawa shogunate regulated the appearance of swords for formal attire such as when samurai came to a castle. The daisho for formal attire was limited to the scabbard in solid black, the hilt winding thread and the hilt wrapped with white ray skin.

According to most traditional &quot;kenjutsu&quot; schools, only one sword of the &quot;daisho&quot; would have been used in combat. However, in the first half of the 17th century, the famous swordsman Miyamoto Musashi promoted the use of a one-handed grip, which allowed both swords to be used simultaneously. This technique, called &quot;nitōken&quot;, is a main element of the &quot;Niten Ichi-ryū&quot; style of swordsmanship that Musashi founded.

During the Meiji period an edict was passed in 1871 abolishing the requirement that &quot;daishō&quot; be worn by samurai, and in 1876 wearing swords in public by most of Japan&#x27;s population was banned; thus ended the use of the &quot;daishō&quot; as the symbol of the samurai. The samurai class was abolished soon after the sword ban.
