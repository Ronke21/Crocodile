<text>In electronics and telecommunications, a crossbar switch (cross-point switch, matrix switch) is a collection of switches arranged in a matrix configuration. A crossbar switch has multiple input and output lines that form a crossed pattern of interconnecting lines between which a connection may be established by closing a switch located at each intersection, the elements of the matrix. Originally, a crossbar switch consisted literally of crossing metal bars that provided the input and output paths. Later implementations achieved the same switching topology in solid-state electronics. The crossbar switch is one of the principal telephone exchange architectures, together with a rotary switch, memory switch, and a crossover switch.

== General properties ==
A crossbar switch is an assembly of individual switches between a set of inputs and a set of outputs. The switches are arranged in a matrix. If the crossbar switch has M inputs and N outputs, then a crossbar has a matrix with &quot;M&quot; × &quot;N&quot; cross-points or places where connections can be made. At each crosspoint is a switch; when closed, it connects one of the inputs to one of the outputs. A given crossbar is a single layer, non-blocking switch. A crossbar switching system is also called a coordinate switching system.

Collections of crossbars can be used to implement multiple layer and blocking switches. A blocking switch prevents connecting more than one input. A non-blocking switch allows other concurrent connections from inputs to other outputs.

== Applications ==
Crossbar switches are commonly used in information processing applications such as telephony and circuit switching, but they are also used in applications such as mechanical sorting machines.

The matrix layout of a crossbar switch is also used in some semiconductor memory devices which enables the data transmission. Here the bars are extremely thin metal wires, and the switches are fusible links. The fuses are blown or opened using high voltage and read using low voltage. Such devices are called programmable read-only memory. At the 2008 NSTI Nanotechnology Conference a paper was presented that discussed a nanoscale crossbar implementation of an adding circuit used as an alternative to logic gates for computation.

Matrix arrays are fundamental to modern flat-panel displays. Thin-film-transistor LCDs have a transistor at each crosspoint, so they could be considered to include a crossbar switch as part of their structure.

For video switching in home and professional theater applications, a crossbar switch (or a matrix switch, as it is more commonly called in this application) is used to distribute the output of multiple video appliances simultaneously to every monitor or every room throughout a building. In a typical installation, all the video sources are located on an equipment rack, and are connected as inputs to the matrix switch.

Where central control of the matrix is practical, a typical rack-mount matrix switch offers front-panel buttons to allow manual connection of inputs to outputs. An example of such a usage might be a sports bar, where numerous programs are displayed simultaneously. Ordinarily, a sports bar would install a separate desk top box for each display for which independent control is desired. The matrix switch enables the operator to route signals at will, so that only enough set top boxes are needed to cover the total number of unique programs to be viewed, while making it easier to control sound from any program in the overall sound system.

Such switches are used in high-end home theater applications. Video sources typically shared include set-top receivers or DVD changers; the same concept applies to audio. The outputs are wired to televisions in individual rooms. The matrix switch is controlled via an Ethernet or RS-232 connection by a whole-house automation controller, such as those made by AMX, Crestron, or Control4, which provides the user interface that enables the user in each room to select which appliance to watch. The actual user interface varies by system brand, and might include a combination of on-screen menus, touch-screens, and handheld remote controls. The system is necessary to enable the user to select the program they wish to watch from the same room they will watch it from, otherwise it would be necessary for them to walk to the equipment rack.

The special crossbar switches used in distributing satellite TV signals are called multiswitches.

==Implementations==
Historically, a crossbar switch consisted of metal bars associated with each input and output, together with some means of controlling movable contacts at each cross-point. The first switches used metal pins or plugs to bridge a vertical and horizontal bar. In the later part of the 20th century, the use of mechanical crossbar switches declined and the term described any rectangular array of switches in general. Modern crossbar switches are usually implemented with semiconductor technology. An important emerging class of optical crossbars is implemented with microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology.

===Mechanical===
A type of mid-20th-century telegraph exchange consisted of a grid of vertical and horizontal brass bars with a hole at each intersection (&quot;c.f.&quot; top picture). The operator inserted a metal pin to connect one telegraph line to another.

===Electromechanical switching in telephony===
A telephony crossbar switch is an electromechanical device for switching telephone calls. The first design of what is now called a crossbar switch was the Bell company Western Electric&#x27;s coordinate selector of 1915. To save money on control systems, this system was organized on the stepping switch or selector principle rather than the link principle. It was little used in America, but the Televerket Swedish governmental agency manufactured its own design (the Gotthilf Betulander design from 1919, inspired by the Western Electric system), and used it in Sweden from 1926 until the digitization in the 1980s in small and medium-sized A204 model switches. The system design used in AT&amp;T Corporation&#x27;s 1XB crossbar exchanges, which entered revenue service from 1938, developed by Bell Telephone Labs, was inspired by the Swedish design but was based on the rediscovered link principle. In 1945, a similar design by Swedish Televerket was installed in Sweden, making it possible to increase the capacity of the A204 model switch. Delayed by the Second World War, several millions of urban 1XB lines were installed from the 1950s in the United States.

In 1950, the Swedish Ericsson company developed their own versions of the 1XB and A204 systems for the international market. In the early 1960s, the company&#x27;s sales of crossbar switches exceeded those of their rotating 500-switching system, as measured in the number of lines. Crossbar switching quickly spread to the rest of the world, replacing most earlier designs like the Strowger (step-by-step) and Panel systems in larger installations in the U.S. Graduating from entirely electromechanical control on introduction, they were gradually elaborated to have full electronic control and a variety of calling features including short-code and speed-dialing. In the UK the Plessey Company produced a range of TXK crossbar exchanges, but their widespread rollout by the British Post Office began later than in other countries, and then was inhibited by the parallel development of TXE reed relay and electronic exchange systems, so they never achieved a large number of customer connections although they did find some success as tandem switch exchanges.

Crossbar switches use switching matrices made from a two-dimensional array of contacts arranged in an x–y format. These switching matrices are operated by a series of horizontal bars arranged over the contacts. Each such select bar can be rocked up or down by electromagnets to provide access to two levels of the matrix. A second set of vertical hold bars is set at right angles to the first (hence the name, &quot;crossbar&quot;) and also operated by electromagnets. The select bars carry spring-loaded wire fingers that enable the hold bars to operate the contacts beneath the bars. When the select and then the hold electromagnets operate in sequence to move the bars, they trap one of the spring fingers to close the contacts beneath the point where two bars cross. This then makes the connection through the switch as part of setting up a calling path through the exchange. Once connected, the select magnet is then released so it can use its other fingers for other connections, while the hold magnet remains energized for the duration of the call to maintain the connection. The crossbar switching interface was referred to as the TXK or TXC (telephone exchange crossbar) switch in the UK.
However, the Bell System &quot;Type B&quot; crossbar switch of the 1960s was made in the largest quantity. The majority were 200-point switches, with twenty verticals and ten levels of three wires. Each select bar carries ten fingers so that any of the ten circuits assigned to the ten verticals can connect to either of two levels. Five select bars, each able to rotate up or down, mean a choice of ten links to the next stage of switching. Each crosspoint in this particular model connected six wires. The vertical off-normal contacts next to the hold magnets are lined up along the bottom of the switch. They perform logic and memory functions, and the hold bar keeps them in the active position as long as the connection is up. The horizontal off-normals on the sides of the switch are activated by the horizontal bars when the butterfly magnets rotate them. This only happens while the connection is being set up, since the butterflies are only energized then.

The majority of Bell System switches were made to connect three wires including the tip and ring of a balanced pair circuit and a sleeve lead for control. Many connected six wires, either for two distinct circuits or for a four wire circuit or other complex connection. The Bell System &quot;Type C&quot; miniature crossbar of the 1970s was similar, but the fingers projected forward from the back and the select bars held paddles to move them. The majority of type C had twelve levels; these were the less common ten level ones. The Northern Electric &quot;Minibar&quot; used in SP1 switch was similar but even smaller. The ITT Pentaconta Multiswitch of the same era had usually 22 verticals, 26 levels, and six to twelve wires. Ericsson crossbar switches sometimes had only five verticals.

===Instrumentation===
For instrumentation use, James Cunningham, Son and Company made high-speed, very-long-life crossbar switches with physically small mechanical parts which permitted faster operation than telephone-type crossbar switches. Many of their switches had the mechanical Boolean AND function of telephony crossbar switches, but other models had individual relays (one coil per crosspoint) in matrix arrays, connecting the relay contacts to [x] and [y] buses. These latter types were equivalent to separate relays; there was no logical AND function built in. Cunningham crossbar switches had precious-metal contacts capable of handling millivolt signals.

===Telephone exchange===
Early crossbar exchanges were divided into an originating side and a terminating side, while the later and prominent Canadian and US SP1 switch and 5XB switch were not. When a user picked up the telephone handset, the resulting line loop operating the user&#x27;s line relay caused the exchange to connect the user&#x27;s telephone to an originating sender, which returned the user a dial tone. The sender then recorded the dialed digits and passed them to the originating marker, which selected an outgoing trunk and operated the various crossbar switch stages to connect the calling user to it. The originating marker then passed the trunk call completion requirements (type of pulsing, resistance of the trunk, etc.) and the called party&#x27;s details to the sender and released. The sender then relayed this information to a terminating sender (which could be on either the same or a different exchange). This sender then used a terminating marker to connect the calling user, via the selected incoming trunk, to the called user, and caused the controlling relay set to send the ring signal to the called user&#x27;s phone, and return ringing tone to the caller.

The crossbar switch itself was simple: exchange design moved all the logical decision-making to the common control elements, which were very reliable as relay sets. The design criteria specified only two hours of downtime for service every forty years, which was a large improvement over earlier electromechanical systems. The exchange design concept lent itself to incremental upgrades, as the control elements could be replaced separately from the call switching elements. The minimum size of a crossbar exchange was comparatively large, but in city areas with a large installed line capacity the whole exchange occupied less space than other exchange technologies of equivalent capacity. For this reason they were also typically the first switches to be replaced with digital systems, which were even smaller and more reliable.

Two principles of crossbar switching existed. An early method was based on the selector principle, which used crossbar switches to implement the same switching fabric used with Strowger switches. In this principle, each crossbar switch would receive one dialed digit, corresponding to one of several groups of switches or trunks. The switch would then find an idle switch or trunk among those selected and connect to it. Each crossbar switch could only handle one call at a time; thus, an exchange with a hundred 10×10 switches in five stages could only have twenty conversations in progress. Distributed control meant there was no common point of failure, but also meant that the setup stage lasted for the ten seconds or so the caller took to dial the required number. In control occupancy terms this comparatively long interval degrades the traffic capacity of a switch.
Starting with the 1XB switch, the later and more common method was based on the link principle, and used the switches as crosspoints. Each moving contact was to the other contacts on the same level by bare-strip wiring, often nicknamed &quot;banjo wiring&quot;. to a link on one of the inputs of a switch in the next stage. The switch could handle its portion of as many calls as it had levels or verticals. Thus an exchange with forty 10×10 switches in four stages could have one hundred conversations in progress. The link principle was more efficient, but required a complex control system to find idle links through the switching fabric.

This meant common control, as described above: all the digits were recorded, then passed to the common control equipment, the marker, to establish the call at all the separate switch stages simultaneously. A marker-controlled crossbar system had in the marker a highly vulnerable central control; this was invariably protected by having duplicate markers. The great advantage was that the control occupancy on the switches was of the order of one second or less, representing the operate and release lags of the X-then-Y armatures of the switches. The only downside of common control was the need to provide digit recorders enough to deal with the greatest forecast originating traffic level on the exchange.

The Plessey TXK1 or 5005 design used an intermediate form, in which a clear path was marked through the switching fabric by distributed logic, and then closed through all at once.

Crossbar exchanges remain in revenue service only in a few telephone networks. Preserved installations are maintained in museums, such as the Museum of Communications in Seattle, Washington, and the Science Museum in London.

===Semiconductor===
Semiconductor implementations of crossbar switches typically consist of a set of input amplifiers or retimers connected to a series of interconnects within a semiconductor device. A similar set of interconnects are connected to output amplifiers or retimers. At each cross-point where the bars cross, a pass transistor is implemented which connects the bars. When the pass transistor is enabled, the input is connected to the output.

As computer technologies have improved, crossbar switches have found uses in systems such as the multistage interconnection networks that connect the various processing units in a uniform memory access parallel processor to the array of memory elements.

==Arbitration==
A standard problem in using crossbar switches is that of setting the crosspoints. In the classic telephony application of crossbars, the crosspoints are closed, and open as the telephone calls come and go. In Asynchronous Transfer Mode or packet switching applications, the crosspoints must be made and broken at each decision interval. In high-speed switches, the settings of all of the crosspoints must be determined and then set millions or billions of times per second. One approach for making these decisions quickly is through the use of a wavefront arbiter.

<doc id="45459" wikidata="Q868299" url="?curid=45459" title="Control flow">
<text>In computer science, control flow (or flow of control) is the order in which individual statements, instructions or function calls of an imperative program are executed or evaluated. The emphasis on explicit control flow distinguishes an &quot;imperative programming&quot; language from a &quot;declarative programming&quot; language.

Within an imperative programming language, a &quot;control flow statement&quot; is a statement that results in a choice being made as to which of two or more paths to follow. For non-strict functional languages, functions and language constructs exist to achieve the same result, but they are usually not termed control flow statements.

A set of statements is in turn generally structured as a block, which in addition to grouping, also defines a lexical scope.

Interrupts and signals are low-level mechanisms that can alter the flow of control in a way similar to a subroutine, but usually occur as a response to some external stimulus or event (that can occur asynchronously), rather than execution of an &quot;in-line&quot; control flow statement.

At the level of machine language or assembly language, control flow instructions usually work by altering the program counter. For some central processing units (CPUs), the only control flow instructions available are conditional or unconditional branch instructions, also termed jumps.

== Categories ==

The kinds of control flow statements supported by different languages vary, but can be categorized by their effect:
* Continuation at a different statement (unconditional branch or jump)
* Executing a set of statements only if some condition is met (choice - i.e., conditional branch)
* Executing a set of statements zero or more times, until some condition is met (i.e., loop - the same as conditional branch)
* Executing a set of distant statements, after which the flow of control usually returns (subroutines, coroutines, and continuations)
* Stopping the program, preventing any further execution (unconditional halt)

== Primitives ==
=== Labels ===

A label is an explicit name or number assigned to a fixed position within the source code, and which may be referenced by control flow statements appearing elsewhere in the source code. A label marks a position within source code and has no other effect.

Line numbers are an alternative to a named label used in some languages (such as BASIC). They are whole numbers placed at the start of each line of text in the source code. Languages which use these often impose the constraint that the line numbers must increase in value in each following line, but may not require that they be consecutive. For example, in BASIC:
10 LET X = 3
20 PRINT X
In other languages such as C and Ada, a label is an identifier, usually appearing at the start of a line and immediately followed by a colon. For example, in C:
Success: printf(&quot;The operation was successful.\n&quot;);
The language ALGOL 60 allowed both whole numbers and identifiers as labels (both linked by colons to the following statement), but few if any other ALGOL variants allowed whole numbers. Early Fortran compilers only allowed whole numbers as labels. Beginning with Fortran-90, alphanumeric labels have also been allowed.

=== Goto ===

The &quot;goto&quot; statement (a combination of the English words &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;, and pronounced accordingly) is the most basic form of unconditional transfer of control.

Although the keyword may either be in upper or lower case depending on the language, it is usually written as:
 goto &quot;label&quot;
The effect of a goto statement is to cause the next statement to be executed to be the statement appearing at (or immediately after) the indicated label.

Goto statements have been considered harmful by many computer scientists, notably Dijkstra.

=== Subroutines ===

The terminology for subroutines varies; they may alternatively be known as routines, procedures, functions (especially if they return results) or methods (especially if they belong to classes or type classes).

In the 1950s, computer memories were very small by current standards so subroutines were used mainly to reduce program size. A piece of code was written once and then used many times from various other places in a program.

Today, subroutines are more often used to help make a program more structured, e.g., by isolating some algorithm or hiding some data access method. If many programmers are working on one program, subroutines are one kind of modularity that can help divide the work.

=== Sequence ===
In structured programming, the ordered sequencing of successive commands is considered one of the basic control structures, which is used as a building block for programs alongside iteration, recursion and choice.

== Minimal structured control flow ==

In May 1966, Böhm and Jacopini published an article in &quot;Communications of the ACM&quot; which showed that any program with gotos could be transformed into a goto-free form involving only choice (IF THEN ELSE) and loops (WHILE condition DO xxx), possibly with duplicated code and/or the addition of Boolean variables (true/false flags). Later authors showed that choice can be replaced by loops (and yet more Boolean variables).

That such minimalism is possible does not mean that it is necessarily desirable; computers theoretically need only one machine instruction (subtract one number from another and branch if the result is negative), but practical computers have dozens or even hundreds of machine instructions.

Other research showed that control structures with one entry and one exit were much easier to understand than any other form, mainly because they could be used anywhere as a statement without disrupting the control flow. In other words, they were &quot;composable&quot;. (Later developments, such as non-strict programming languages – and more recently, composable software transactions – have continued this strategy, making components of programs even more freely composable.)

Some academics took a purist approach to the Böhm–Jacopini result and argued that even instructions like codice_1 and codice_2 from the middle of loops are bad practice as they are not needed in the Böhm–Jacopini proof, and thus they advocated that all loops should have a single exit point. This purist approach is embodied in the language Pascal (designed in 1968–1969), which up to the mid-1990s was the preferred tool for teaching introductory programming in academia. The direct application of the Böhm–Jacopini theorem may result in additional local variables being introduced in the structured chart, and may also result in some code duplication. Pascal is affected by both of these problems and according to empirical studies cited by Eric S. Roberts, student programmers had difficulty formulating correct solutions in Pascal for several simple problems, including writing a function for searching an element in an array. A 1980 study by Henry Shapiro cited by Roberts found that using only the Pascal-provided control structures, the correct solution was given by only 20% of the subjects, while no subject wrote incorrect code for this problem if allowed to write a return from the middle of a loop.

== Control structures in practice ==
Most programming languages with control structures have an initial keyword which indicates the type of control structure involved. Languages then divide as to whether or not control structures have a final keyword.

* No final keyword: ALGOL 60, C, C++, Go, Haskell, Java, Pascal, Perl, PHP, PL/I, Python, PowerShell. Such languages need some way of grouping statements together:
** ALGOL 60 and Pascal: codice_3 ... codice_4
** C, C++, Go, Java, Perl, PHP, and PowerShell: curly brackets codice_5 ... codice_6
** PL/I: codice_7 ... codice_8
** Python: uses indent level (see Off-side rule)
** Haskell: either indent level or curly brackets can be used, and they can be freely mixed
** Lua: uses codice_9 ... codice_4
* Final keyword: Ada, APL, ALGOL 68, Modula-2, Fortran 77, Mythryl, Visual Basic. The forms of the final keyword vary:
** Ada: final keyword is codice_4 + &quot;space&quot; + initial keyword e.g., codice_12 ... codice_13, codice_14 ... codice_15
** APL: final keyword is codice_16 optionally + initial keyword, e.g., codice_17 ... codice_16 or codice_17 ... codice_20, codice_21 ... codice_16 or codice_23 ... codice_24, however, if adding an end condition, the end keyword becomes codice_25
** ALGOL 68, Mythryl: initial keyword spelled backwards e.g., codice_12 ... codice_27, codice_28 ... codice_29
** Fortran 77: final keyword is codice_8 + initial keyword e.g., codice_31 ... codice_32, codice_7 ... codice_34
** Modula-2: same final keyword codice_8 for everything
** Visual Basic: every control structure has its own keyword. codice_36 ... codice_37; codice_38 ... codice_39; codice_40 ... codice_41; codice_42 ... codice_43

== Choice ==
=== If-then-(else) statements ===

Conditional expressions and conditional constructs are features of a programming language that perform different computations or actions depending on whether a programmer-specified Boolean &quot;condition&quot; evaluates to true or false. 
* codice_44. A form found in unstructured languages, mimicking a typical machine code instruction, would jump to (GOTO) a label or line number when the condition was met.
* codice_45. Rather than being restricted to a jump, any simple statement, or nested block, could follow the THEN key keyword. This a structured form.
* codice_46. As above, but with a second action to be performed if the condition is false. This is one of the most common forms, with many variations. Some require a terminal codice_32, others do not. C and related languages do not require a terminal keyword, or a &#x27;then&#x27;, but do require parentheses around the condition.
* Conditional statements can be and often are nested inside other conditional statements. Some languages allow codice_48 and codice_31 to be combined into codice_50, avoiding the need to have a series of codice_32 or other final statements at the end of a compound statement.
Less common variations include:
* Some languages, such as early Fortran, have a &quot;three-way&quot; or &quot;arithmetic if&quot;, testing whether a numeric value is negative, zero, or positive.
*Some languages have a functional form of an codice_12 statement, for instance Lisp&#x27;s codice_53.
*Some languages have an operator form of an codice_12 statement, such as C&#x27;s ternary operator.
* Perl supplements a C-style codice_12 with codice_56 and codice_57.
* Smalltalk uses codice_58 and codice_59 messages to implement conditionals, rather than any fundamental language construct.

=== Case and switch statements ===

Switch statements (or &quot;case statements&quot;, or &quot;multiway branches&quot;) compare a given value with specified constants and take action according to the first constant to match. There is usually a provision for a default action (&quot;else&quot;, &quot;otherwise&quot;) to be taken if no match succeeds. Switch statements can allow compiler optimizations, such as lookup tables. In dynamic languages, the cases may not be limited to constant expressions, and might extend to pattern matching, as in the shell script example on the right, where the codice_60 implements the default case as a glob matching any string. Case logic can also be implemented in functional form, as in SQL&#x27;s codice_61 statement.

== Loops ==
A loop is a sequence of statements which is specified once but which may be carried out several times in succession. The code &quot;inside&quot; the loop (the &quot;body&quot; of the loop, shown below as &quot;xxx&quot;) is obeyed a specified number of times, or once for each of a collection of items, or until some condition is met, or indefinitely. When one of those items is itself also a loop, it is called a &quot;nested loop&quot;.

In functional programming languages, such as Haskell and Scheme, both recursive and iterative processes are expressed with tail recursive procedures instead of looping constructs that are syntactic.

=== Count-controlled loops ===

Most programming languages have constructions for repeating a loop a certain number of times.
In most cases counting can go downwards instead of upwards and step sizes other than 1 can be used.

In these examples, if N &lt; 1 then the body of loop may execute once (with I having value 1) or not at all, depending on the programming language.

In many programming languages, only integers can be reliably used in a count-controlled loop. Floating-point numbers are represented imprecisely due to hardware constraints, so a loop such as
 for X := 0.1 step 0.1 to 1.0 do

might be repeated 9 or 10 times, depending on rounding errors and/or the hardware and/or the compiler version. Furthermore, if the increment of X occurs by repeated addition, accumulated rounding errors may mean that the value of X in each iteration can differ quite significantly from the expected sequence 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ..., 1.0.

=== Condition-controlled loops ===

Most programming languages have constructions for repeating a loop until some condition changes. Some variations test the condition at the start of the loop; others test it at the end. If the test is at the start, the body may be skipped completely; if it is at the end, the body is always executed at least once.

A control break is a value change detection method used within ordinary loops to trigger processing for groups of values. Values are monitored within the loop and a change diverts program flow to the handling of the group event associated with them.

 DO UNTIL (End-of-File)
 IF new-zipcode &lt;&gt; current-zipcode
 display_tally(current-zipcode, zipcount)
 current-zipcode = new-zipcode
 zipcount = 0
 ENDIF
 zipcount++
 LOOP

=== Collection-controlled loops ===

Several programming languages (e.g., Ada, D, C++11, Smalltalk, PHP, Perl, Object Pascal, Java, C#, MATLAB, Visual Basic, Ruby, Python, JavaScript, Fortran 95 and later) have special constructs which allow implicit looping through all elements of an array, or all members of a set or collection.

 someCollection do: [:eachElement |xxx].
 for Item in Collection do begin xxx end;
 foreach (item; myCollection) { xxx }
 foreach someArray { xxx }
 foreach ($someArray as $k =&gt; $v) { xxx }
 Collection&lt;String&gt; coll; for (String s : coll) {}
 foreach (string s in myStringCollection) { xxx }
 someCollection | ForEach-Object { $_ }
 forall ( index = first:last:step... )
Scala has for-expressions, which generalise collection-controlled loops, and also support other uses, such as asynchronous programming. Haskell has do-expressions and comprehensions, which together provide similar function to for-expressions in Scala.

=== General iteration ===
General iteration constructs such as C&#x27;s codice_62 statement and Common Lisp&#x27;s codice_9 form can be used to express any of the above sorts of loops, and others, such as looping over some number of collections in parallel. Where a more specific looping construct can be used, it is usually preferred over the general iteration construct, since it often makes the purpose of the expression clearer.

=== Infinite loops ===

Infinite loops are used to assure a program segment loops forever or until an exceptional condition arises, such as an error. For instance, an event-driven program (such as a server) should loop forever, handling events as they occur, only stopping when the process is terminated by an operator.

Infinite loops can be implemented using other control flow constructs. Most commonly, in unstructured programming this is jump back up (goto), while in structured programming this is an indefinite loop (while loop) set to never end, either by omitting the condition or explicitly setting it to true, as codice_64. Some languages have special constructs for infinite loops, typically by omitting the condition from an indefinite loop. Examples include Ada (codice_65), Fortran (codice_66), Go (codice_67), and Ruby (codice_68).

Often, an infinite loop is unintentionally created by a programming error in a condition-controlled loop, wherein the loop condition uses variables that never change within the loop.

=== Continuation with next iteration ===
Sometimes within the body of a loop there is a desire to skip the remainder of the loop body and continue with the next iteration of the loop. Some languages provide a statement such as codice_69 (most languages), codice_70, codice_71 (Fortran), or codice_72 (Perl and Ruby), which will do this. The effect is to prematurely terminate the innermost loop body and then resume as normal with the next iteration. If the iteration is the last one in the loop, the effect is to terminate the entire loop early.

=== Redo current iteration ===
Some languages, like Perl and Ruby, have a codice_73 statement that restarts the current iteration from the start.

=== Restart loop ===
Ruby has a codice_74 statement that restarts the entire loop from the initial iteration.

=== Early exit from loops ===
When using a count-controlled loop to search through a table, it might be desirable to stop searching as soon as the required item is found. Some programming languages provide a statement such as codice_1 (most languages), codice_76 (Visual Basic), or codice_77 (Perl), which effect is to terminate the current loop immediately, and transfer control to the statement immediately after that loop. Another term for early-exit loops is loop-and-a-half.

The following example is done in Ada which supports both &quot;early exit from loops&quot; and &quot;loops with test in the middle&quot;. Both features are very similar and comparing both code snippets will show the difference: &quot;early exit&quot; must be combined with an if statement while a &quot;condition in the middle&quot; is a self-contained construct.
with Ada.Text IO;
with Ada.Integer Text IO;

procedure Print_Squares is 
 X : Integer;
begin
 Read_Data : loop
 Ada.Integer Text IO.Get(X);
 exit Read_Data when X = 0;
 Ada.Text IO.Put (X * X);
 Ada.Text IO.New_Line;
 end loop Read_Data;
end Print_Squares;
Python supports conditional execution of code depending on whether a loop was exited early (with a codice_1 statement) or not by using an else-clause with the loop. For example,
for n in set_of_numbers:
 if isprime(n):
 print(&quot;Set contains a prime number&quot;)
 break
else:
 print(&quot;Set did not contain any prime numbers&quot;)
The codice_79 clause in the above example is linked to the codice_62 statement, and not the inner codice_12 statement. Both Python&#x27;s codice_62 and codice_83 loops support such an else clause, which is executed only if early exit of the loop has not occurred.

Some languages support breaking out of nested loops; in theory circles, these are called multi-level breaks. One common use example is searching a multi-dimensional table. This can be done either via multilevel breaks (break out of &quot;N&quot; levels), as in bash and PHP, or via labeled breaks (break out and continue at given label), as in Go, Java and Perl. Alternatives to multilevel breaks include single breaks, together with a state variable which is tested to break out another level; exceptions, which are caught at the level being broken out to; placing the nested loops in a function and using return to effect termination of the entire nested loop; or using a label and a goto statement. C does not include a multilevel break, and the usual alternative is to use a goto to implement a labeled break. Python does not have a multilevel break or continue – this was proposed in PEP 3136, and rejected on the basis that the added complexity was not worth the rare legitimate use.

The notion of multi-level breaks is of some interest in theoretical computer science, because it gives rise to what is today called the &quot;Kosaraju hierarchy&quot;. In 1973 S. Rao Kosaraju refined the structured program theorem by proving that it is possible to avoid adding additional variables in structured programming, as long as arbitrary-depth, multi-level breaks from loops are allowed. Furthermore, Kosaraju proved that a strict hierarchy of programs exists: for every integer &quot;n&quot;, there exists a program containing a multi-level break of depth &quot;n&quot; that cannot be rewritten as a program with multi-level breaks of depth less than &quot;n&quot; without introducing added variables.

One can also codice_2 out of a subroutine executing the looped statements, breaking out of both the nested loop and the subroutine. There are other proposed control structures for multiple breaks, but these are generally implemented as exceptions instead.

In his 2004 textbook, David Watt uses Tennent&#x27;s notion of sequencer to explain the similarity between multi-level breaks and return statements. Watt notes that a class of sequencers known as &quot;escape sequencers&quot;, defined as &quot;sequencer that terminates execution of a textually enclosing command or procedure&quot;, encompasses both breaks from loops (including multi-level breaks) and return statements. As commonly implemented, however, return sequencers may also carry a (return) value, whereas the break sequencer as implemented in contemporary languages usually cannot.

=== Loop variants and invariants ===
Loop variants and loop invariants are used to express correctness of loops.

In practical terms, a loop variant is an integer expression which has an initial non-negative value. The variant&#x27;s value must decrease during each loop iteration but must never become negative during the correct execution of the loop. Loop variants are used to guarantee that loops will terminate.

A loop invariant is an assertion which must be true before the first loop iteration and remain true after each iteration. This implies that when a loop terminates correctly, both the exit condition and the loop invariant are satisfied. Loop invariants are used to monitor specific properties of a loop during successive iterations.

Some programming languages, such as Eiffel contain native support for loop variants and invariants. In other cases, support is an add-on, such as the Java Modeling Language&#x27;s specification for loop statements in Java.

=== Loop sublanguage ===
Some Lisp dialects provide an extensive sublanguage for describing Loops. An early example can be found in Conversional Lisp of Interlisp. Common Lisp provides a Loop macro which implements such a sublanguage.

=== Loop system cross-reference table ===

== Structured non-local control flow ==
Many programming languages, especially those favoring more dynamic styles of programming, offer constructs for &quot;non-local control flow&quot;. These cause the flow of execution to jump out of a given context and resume at some predeclared point. &quot;Conditions&quot;, &quot;exceptions&quot; and &quot;continuations&quot; are three common sorts of non-local control constructs; more exotic ones also exist, such as generators, coroutines and the async keyword.

=== Conditions ===
The earliest Fortran compilers had statements for testing exceptional conditions. These included the codice_92, codice_93, and codice_94 statements. In the interest of machine independence, they were not included in FORTRAN IV and the Fortran 66 Standard. However since Fortran 2003 it is possible to test for numerical issues via calls to functions in the codice_95 module.

PL/I has some 22 standard conditions (e.g., ZERODIVIDE SUBSCRIPTRANGE ENDFILE) which can be raised and which can be intercepted by: ON &quot;condition&quot; action; Programmers can also define and use their own named conditions.

Like the &quot;unstructured if&quot;, only one statement can be specified so in many cases a GOTO is needed to decide where flow of control should resume.

Unfortunately, some implementations had a substantial overhead in both space and time (especially SUBSCRIPTRANGE), so many programmers tried to avoid using conditions.

Common Syntax examples:

 ON &quot;condition&quot; GOTO &quot;label&quot;

=== Exceptions ===

Modern languages have a specialized structured construct for exception handling which does not rely on the use of codice_96 or (multi-level) breaks or returns. For example, in C++ one can write:
try {
 xxx1 // Somewhere in here
 xxx2 // use: throw someValue;
 xxx3
} catch (someClass&amp; someId) { // catch value of someClass
 actionForSomeClass 
} catch (someType&amp; anotherId) { // catch value of someType
 actionForSomeType
} catch (...) { // catch anything not already caught
 actionForAnythingElse


Any number and variety of codice_97 clauses can be used above. If there is no codice_97 matching a particular codice_99, control percolates back through subroutine calls and/or nested blocks until a matching codice_97 is found or until the end of the main program is reached, at which point the program is forcibly stopped with a suitable error message.

Via C++&#x27;s influence, codice_97 is the keyword reserved for declaring a pattern-matching exception handler in other languages popular today, like Java or C#. Some other languages like Ada use the keyword codice_102 to introduce an exception handler and then may even employ a different keyword (codice_56 in Ada) for the pattern matching. A few languages like AppleScript incorporate placeholders in the exception handler syntax to automatically extract several pieces of information when the exception occurs. This approach is exemplified below by the codice_104 construct from AppleScript:
try
 set myNumber to myNumber / 0
on error e number n from f to t partial result pr
 if ( e = &quot;Can&#x27;t divide by zero&quot; ) then display dialog &quot;You must not do that&quot;
end try
David Watt&#x27;s 2004 textbook also analyzes exception handling in the framework of sequencers (introduced in this article in the section on early exits from loops). Watt notes that an abnormal situation, generally exemplified with arithmetic overflows or input/output failures like file not found, is a kind of error that &quot;is detected in some low-level program unit, but [for which] a handler is more naturally located in a high-level program unit&quot;. For example, a program might contain several calls to read files, but the action to perform when a file is not found depends on the meaning (purpose) of the file in question to the program and thus a handling routine for this abnormal situation cannot be located in low-level system code. Watts further notes that introducing status flags testing in the caller, as single-exit structured programming or even (multi-exit) return sequencers would entail, results in a situation where &quot;the application code tends to get cluttered by tests of status flags&quot; and that &quot;the programmer might forgetfully or lazily omit to test a status flag. In fact, abnormal situations represented by status flags are by default ignored!&quot; Watt notes that in contrast to status flags testing, exceptions have the opposite default behavior, causing the program to terminate unless the program deals with the exception explicitly in some way, possibly by adding explicit code to ignore it. Based on these arguments, Watt concludes that jump sequencers or escape sequencers are less suitable as a dedicated exception sequencer with the semantics discussed above.

In Object Pascal, D, Java, C#, and Python a codice_105 clause can be added to the codice_106 construct. No matter how control leaves the codice_106 the code inside the codice_105 clause is guaranteed to execute. This is useful when writing code that must relinquish an expensive resource (such as an opened file or a database connection) when finished processing:
FileStream stm = null; // C# example
try
 stm = new FileStream(&quot;logfile.txt&quot;, FileMode.Create);
 return ProcessStuff(stm); // may throw an exception
finally
 if (stm != null)
 stm.Close();


Since this pattern is fairly common, C# has a special syntax:
using (var stm = new FileStream(&quot;logfile.txt&quot;, FileMode.Create))
 return ProcessStuff(stm); // may throw an exception


Upon leaving the codice_109-block, the compiler guarantees that the codice_110 object is released, effectively binding the variable to the file stream while abstracting from the side effects of initializing and releasing the file. Python&#x27;s codice_111 statement and Ruby&#x27;s block argument to codice_112 are used to similar effect.

All the languages mentioned above define standard exceptions and the circumstances under which they are thrown. Users can throw exceptions of their own; C++ allows users to throw and catch almost any type, including basic types like codice_113, whereas other languages like Java are less permissive.

=== Continuations ===
=== Async ===
C# 5.0 introduced the async keyword for supporting asynchronous I/O in a &quot;direct style&quot;.

=== Generators ===

Generators, also known as semicoroutines, allow control to be yielded to a consumer method temporarily, typically using a keyword (yield description) . Like the async keyword, this supports programming in a &quot;direct style&quot;.

=== Coroutines ===

Coroutines are functions that can yield control to each other - a form of co-operative multitasking without threads.

Coroutines can be implemented as a library if the programming language provides either continuations or generators - so the distinction between coroutines and generators in practice is a technical detail.

=== Non-local control flow cross reference ===
== Proposed control structures ==
In a spoof Datamation article in 1973, R. Lawrence Clark suggested that the GOTO statement could be replaced by the COMEFROM statement, and provides some entertaining examples. COMEFROM was implemented in one esoteric programming language named INTERCAL.

Donald Knuth&#x27;s 1974 article &quot;Structured Programming with go to Statements&quot;, identifies two situations which were not covered by the control structures listed above, and gave examples of control structures which could handle these situations. Despite their utility, these constructs have not yet found their way into mainstream programming languages.

=== Loop with test in the middle ===
The following was proposed by Dahl in 1972:

 loop loop
 xxx1 read(char);
 while test; while not atEndOfFile;
 xxx2 write(char);
 repeat; repeat;

If &quot;xxx1&quot; is omitted, we get a loop with the test at the top (a traditional while loop). If &quot;xxx2&quot; is omitted, we get a loop with the test at the bottom, equivalent to a do while loop in many languages. If while is omitted, we get an infinite loop. The construction here can be thought of as a do loop with the while check in the middle. Hence this single construction can replace several constructions in most programming languages.

Languages lacking this construct generally emulate it using an equivalent infinite-loop-with-break idiom:
 while (true) {
 xxx1
 if (not test)
 break
 xxx2

A possible variant is to allow more than one while test; within the loop, but the use of exitwhen (see next section) appears to cover this case better.

In Ada, the above loop construct (loop-while-repeat) can be represented using a standard infinite loop (loop - end loop) that has an exit when clause in the middle (not to be confused with the exitwhen statement in the following section).
with Ada.Text_IO;
with Ada.Integer_Text_IO;

procedure Print_Squares is 
 X : Integer;
begin
 Read_Data : loop
 Ada.Integer_Text_IO.Get(X);
 exit Read_Data when X = 0;
 Ada.Text IO.Put (X * X);
 Ada.Text IO.New_Line;
 end loop Read_Data;
end Print_Squares;
Naming a loop (like &quot;Read_Data&quot; in this example) is optional but permits leaving the outer loop of several nested loops.

=== Multiple early exit/exit from nested loops ===
This construct was proposed by Zahn in 1974. A modified version is presented here.
 exitwhen EventA or EventB or EventC;
 xxx
 exits
 EventA: actionA
 EventB: actionB
 EventC: actionC
 endexit;

exitwhen is used to specify the events which may occur within &quot;xxx&quot;,
their occurrence is indicated by using the name of the event as a statement. When some event does occur, the relevant action is carried out, and then control passes just after . This construction provides a very clear separation between determining that some situation applies, and the action to be taken for that situation.

exitwhen is conceptually similar to exception handling, and exceptions or similar constructs are used for this purpose in many languages.

The following simple example involves searching a two-dimensional table for a particular item.

 exitwhen found or missing;
 for I := 1 to N do
 for J := 1 to M do
 if table[I,J] = target then found;
 missing;
 exits
 found: print (&quot;item is in table&quot;);
 missing: print (&quot;item is not in table&quot;);
 endexit;

== Security ==
One way to attack a piece of software is to redirect the flow of execution of a program. A variety of control-flow integrity techniques, including stack canaries, buffer overflow protection, shadow stacks, and vtable pointer verification, are used to defend against these attacks.

<text>Corfu ( , ) or Kerkyra (, ) is a Greek island in the Ionian Sea, of the Ionian Islands; including its small satellite islands, it forms the margin of Greece&#x27;s northwestern frontier. The island is part of the Corfu regional unit, and is administered by three municipalities with the islands of Othonoi, Ereikoussa, and Mathraki. The principal city of the island (pop. 32,095) is also named Corfu. Corfu is home to the Ionian University.

The island is bound up with the history of Greece from the beginnings of Greek mythology, and is marked by numerous battles and conquests. Ancient Korkyra took part in the Battle of Sybota which was a catalyst for the Peloponnesian War, and, according to Thucydides, the largest naval battle between Greek city states until that time. Thucydides also reports that Korkyra was one of the three great naval powers of Greece in the fifth century BCE, along with Athens and Corinth. Ruins of ancient Greek temples and other archaeological sites of the ancient city of Korkyra are located in Palaiopolis. Medieval castles punctuating strategic locations across the island are a legacy of struggles in the Middle Ages against invasions by pirates and the Ottomans. Two of these castles enclose its capital, which is the only city in Greece to be surrounded in such a way. As a result, Corfu&#x27;s capital has been officially declared a &quot;kastropolis&quot; (&quot;castle city&quot;) by the Greek government.

From medieval times and into the 17th century, the island, as part of the Republic of Venice since 1204, successfully repulsed the Ottomans during several sieges, was recognised as a bulwark of the European States against the Ottoman Empire and became one of the most fortified places in Europe. The fortifications of the island were used by the Venetians to defend against Ottoman intrusion into the Adriatic. In November 1815 Corfu came under British rule following the Napoleonic Wars, and in 1864 was ceded to modern Greece by the British government along with the remaining islands of the United States of the Ionian Islands under the Treaty of London. Corfu is the origin of the Ionian Academy, the first university of the modern Greek state, and the Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo di Corfù, the first Greek theatre and opera house of modern Greece. Ioannis Kapodistrias, the first governor of independent Greece after the revolution of 1821, founder of the modern Greek state, and a distinguished European diplomat, was born in Corfu.

In 2007, the city&#x27;s old town was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List, following a recommendation by ICOMOS. The 1994 European Union summit was held in Corfu. The island is a popular tourist destination.

==Name==
The Greek name, &quot;Kerkyra&quot; or &quot;Korkyra&quot;, is related to two powerful water deities: Poseidon, god of the sea, and Asopos, an important Greek mainland river. According to myth, Poseidon fell in love with the beautiful nymph Korkyra, daughter of Asopos and river nymph Metope, and abducted her. Poseidon brought Korkyra to the hitherto unnamed island and, in marital bliss, offered her name to the place: &quot;Korkyra&quot;, which gradually evolved to &quot;Kerkyra&quot; (Doric). They had a child, Phaiax, after whom the inhabitants of the island were named &quot;Phaiakes&quot; (in Latin, &quot;Phaeaciani&quot;). Corfu is known as the island of the Phaeacians.

The name &quot;Corfù&quot; is a Venetian and Italian version of the Byzantine Κορυφώ (Koryphō), meaning &quot;city of the peaks&quot;. It derives from the Byzantine Greek Κορυφαί (Koryphai) (crests or peaks), denoting the two peaks of &quot;Palaio Frourio&quot;.

==Geography==
The northeastern edge of Corfu lies off the coast of Sarandë, Albania, separated by straits varying in width from . The southeast side of the island lies off the coast of Thesprotia, Greece. Its shape resembles a sickle (&quot;drepanē, δρεπάνι&quot;), to which it was compared by the ancients: the concave side, with the city and harbour of Corfu in the centre, lies toward the Albanian coast. With the island&#x27;s area estimated at , it runs approximately long, with greatest breadth at around .

Two high and well-defined ranges divide the island into three districts, of which the northern is mountainous, the central undulating, and the southern low-lying. The more important of the two ranges, that of Pantokrator (Παντοκράτωρ – the Almighty) stretches east and west from Cape Falacro to Cape Psaromita, and attains its greatest elevation in the summit of the same name.


The second range culminates in the mountain of Santi Jeca, or Santa Decca, as it is called by misinterpretation of the Greek designation &quot;Άγιοι Δέκα&quot; (Hagioi Deka), or the Ten Saints. The whole island, composed as it is of various limestone formations, presents great diversity of surface. Beaches are found in Agios Gordis, the Korission Lagoon, Agios Georgios, Marathia, Kassiopi, Sidari, Palaiokastritsa and many others. Corfu is located near the Kefalonia geological fault formation; earthquakes have occurred.

Corfu&#x27;s coastline spans including capes; its highest point is Mount Pantokrator (); and the second Stravoskiadi, at . The full extent of capes and promontories take in Agia Aikaterini, Drastis to the north, Lefkimmi and Asprokavos to the southeast, and Megachoro to the south. Two islands are also to be found at a middle point of Gouvia and Corfu Bay, which extends across much of the eastern shore of the island; are known as Lazareto and Ptychia (or Vido).

===Diapontia Islands===

The Diapontia Islands (Greek: Διαπόντια νησιά) are located in the northwest of Corfu, (6 km away) and about 
from the Italian coast. The main islands are Othonoi, Ereikoussa and Mathraki.

===Lazaretto Island===
Lazaretto Island, formerly known as St. Dimitrios, is located off the coast northeast of the city Corfu. Lazaretto has an area of and comes under the administration of the Greek National Tourist Organization. During Venetian rule in the early 16th century, a monastery was built on the islet and a leprosarium established later in the century, after which the island was named. In 1798, during the French occupation, the islet was occupied by the Russo-Turkish fleet, who ran it as a military hospital. During the period of British rule, in 1814, the leprosarium was once again opened after renovations, and following Enosis in 1864 the leprosarium again saw occasional use. During World War II, the Axis Occupation of Greece established a Nazi concentration camp there for the prisoners of the Greek Resistance movement, while remaining today are the two-storeyed building that served as the Headquarters of the Italian army, a small church, and the wall against which those condemned to death were shot.

=== Climate ===
Corfu has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Csa&quot;) featuring hot, dry summers and mild to cool, very rainy winters, which are much wetter than other Greek islands. The highest temperature ever recorded is on 24 July 2007 while the lowest is on 17 January 2012.
==Biodiversity==
===Flora===
Homer identifies six plants that adorn the garden of Alcinous: wild olive, pear, pomegranate, apple, fig and grape vine. Of these the apple and the pear are very inferior in Corfu; the others thrive, together with all the fruit trees known in Southern Europe, with addition of the kumquat, loquat and prickly pear and, in some spots, the banana. Olive trees dominate and their combination with cypress trees compose the typical Corfiot landscape. When undisturbed by cultivation, the high maquis is the major natural vegetation type followed by deciduous oak forests and to a lesser extent, pine forests. In total more than 1800 plant species have been recorded.

===Fauna===
Corfu is a continental island; its fauna is similar to that of the opposite mainland.

====Birds====
Avifauna is extensive, with around 300 bird species recorded since the 19th century. Species vary in size from the greater flamingo to the goldcrest. Some species have become extinct, such as the rock partridge and the grey partridge, or no longer breed on the island, like the eastern imperial eagle, the white-tailed eagle, the Bonelli&#x27;s eagle, the griffon vulture and the Egyptian vulture.

====Mammals====
Around 40 species of mammals live on the island and in the sea around it. Fin whales, sperm whales, Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whales, common bottlenose dolphins, short-beaked common dolphins, striped dolphins and Risso&#x27;s dolphins are the regularly present cetaceans. Monk seals appear from time to time without breeding there anymore. Eurasian otters still survive in the lagoons and streams of Corfu. The golden jackal was very common till the 1960s, but after persecution it became extinct, with the last individuals observed in the first half of the 1990s. Recent sightings indicate a recolonization effort from the nearby mainland. Wild boars were exterminated after 2000, after farmers complained about crop damage, but at the moment they recolonized Corfu, swimming from the mainland. Red foxes, beech martens, least weasels, European hares, northern white-breasted hedgehogs are quite widespread, as some of the smaller mammals like the European edible dormouse, the hazel dormouse, the house mouse, the yellow-necked mouse, the western broad-toothed field mouse, the wood mouse, the lesser white-toothed shrew, the etruscan shrew, as well as several species of bats. Coypus, fallow deer, red deer, Indian crested porcupines, Siberian chipmunks and raccoons have been observed recently, but they are escapees and only the coypu and the raccoon have established viable populations.

====Amphibians and reptiles====
Eight species of amphibians and 31 species of reptiles live or have been recorded on and around Corfu.

The Greek newt, the Macedonian crested newt, the common toad, the European green toad, the European tree frog, the agile frog, the Epirus water frog and the Greek marsh frog are the representatives of the Amphibia Class.

Loggerhead sea turtles nest on the sandy beaches. On land, the Hermann&#x27;s tortoise is widespread, while the marginated tortoise&#x27;s status is unclear. In freshwater wetlands European pond terrapins and Balkan terrapins are common, but the last few years face the competition of the introduced pond slider.

Lizard species include typical lizards and geckos like the starred agama, the Mediterranean house gecko, the moorish gecko, the Dalmatian algyroides, the common wall lizard, the Balkan wall lizard, the Balkan green lizard, the European green lizard and the snake-eyed skink as also the legless Greek slow worm and the European glass lizard.

Of the snakes of Corfu, only the nose-horned viper is potentially dangerous. The harmless snake list includes the European worm snake, the javelin sand boa, the Dahl&#x27;s whip snake, the Balkan whip snake, the Caspian whip snake, the four-lined snake, the Aesculapian snake, the leopard snake, the grass snake, the dice snake, the European cat snake, the eastern Montpellier snake.

====Dragonflies====

Corfu has a rich and diverse dragonfly fauna and 39 out of Europe’s 143 species are presently confirmed to have breeding populations on the island, four of them quite recent additions. The Dainty Bluet (&quot;Coenagion scitulum&quot;) and the Blue-eye (&quot;Erythromma lindenii&quot;) were reported for the first time in 2013, the Black Pennant (&quot;Selysiothemis nigra&quot;) was in 2009, and the Bladetail (&quot;Lindenia tetraphylla&quot;) in 2014. The “Critically Endangered” Greek Red Damsel (&quot;Pyrrhosoma elisabethae&quot;) and the “Near Threatened” Eastern Spectre (&quot;Caliaeshna microstigma&quot;) also have breeding populations on the island but are severely threatened by habitat loss. Some species reported from the island in the beginning of the 20th century have not been found in recent years, and may have been lost to the island. Dragonflies are used as indicators for water quality as their larvae are very sensitive to pollution.

==== Butterflies ====
There are 75 (plus) known species of Corfiot butterfly. Of particular interest are the southern swallowtail, southern festoon, Oberthür&#x27;s grizzled skipper, Lulworth skipper, eastern orange tip, Krueper&#x27;s small white, eastern baton blue and the tree grayling, many of which are of near threatened status. Before the turn of the century, not much had been published about the butterfly fauna of Corfu, and there were only a few short and obscure scientific articles. Recent interest grew when a Facebook discussion page (now called Corfu Butterfly Conservation) was created on 27th April 2014. Since that time, a group of responsible butterfly enthusiasts has grown (731 members at the time of writing) who share their passion for the butterflies and moths found on the island. It is through this work that more is being discovered about the distribution and abundance of butterflies across the island.

===== Corfu Butterfly Conservation =====
Corfu Butterfly Conservation (CBC) was launched in April 2019. The group is composed of concerned residents, island visitors and scientists from throughout Europe. Their goals are to produce robust scientific data that can be used to influence policy and protect habitat for the benefit of Corfu&#x27;s butterflies and the wider natural environment, as well as to stimulate public interest in butterfly conservation.

CBC launched its website (www.corfubutterflyconservation.org, funded by the Royal Entomological Society&#x27;s Goodman Award) on the 1 January 2021 to coincide with the launch of the Corfu Butterfly Survey. The website describes the 75 species of butterflies that have been confirmed by members of CBC from the island. It outlines the value of butterflies as indicators of the island&#x27;s biodiversity status and encourages enthusiasts to record their sightings on this website, as participants of the survey. On the 16 December 2021, CBC became a UK registered community interest company (No.13813164) and so its identity changed from being a project to that of an organisation.

== History ==

===Early history===
The earliest reference to Corfu is the Mycenaean Greek word &quot;ko-ro-ku-ra-i-jo (&quot;&quot;man from Kerkyra&quot;) written in Linear B syllabic script, c. 1300 BC. According to Strabo, Corcyra (Κόρκυρα) was the Homeric island of Scheria (Σχερία), and its earliest inhabitants were the Phaeacians (Φαίακες). The island has indeed been identified by some scholars with Scheria, the island of the Phaeacians described in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, though conclusive and irrefutable evidence for this theory has not been found. Apollonius of Rhodes depicts the island in &quot;Argonautica&quot; as a place visited by the Argonauts. Jason and Medea were married there in &#x27;Medea&#x27;s Cave&#x27;. Apollonius named the island &quot;Drepane&quot;, Greek for &quot;sickle&quot;, since it was thought to hide the sickle that Cronus used to castrate his father Uranus, from whose blood the Phaeacians were descended. In an alternative account, Apollonius identifies the buried sickle as a scythe belonging to Demeter, yet the name &quot;Drepane&quot; probably originated in the sickle-shape of the island. According to a scholiast, commenting on the passage in &quot;Argonautica&quot;, the island was first of all called Macris after the nurse of Dionysus who fled there from Euboea.

Some scholars have asserted that Corfu is &quot;Taphos&quot;, the island of the Lelegian Taphians.

According to Strabo (VI, 269), the Liburnians were masters of the island &quot;Korkyra&quot; (Corfu) for a time, until the 8th century BC. They reportedly were expelled from Korkyra by the Corinthians.

At a date no doubt previous to the foundation of Syracuse, Corfu was peopled by settlers from Corinth, probably 730 BC, but it appears to have previously received a stream of emigrants from Eretria. The commercially advantageous location of Corcyra on the way between Greece and Magna Grecia, and its fertile lowlands in the southern section of the island favoured its growth and, influenced perhaps by the presence of non-Corinthian settlers, its people, quite contrary to the usual practice of Corinthian colonies, maintained an independent and even hostile attitude towards the mother city.

This opposition came to a head in the early part of the 7th century BC, when their fleets fought the first naval battle recorded in Greek history: 665 BC according to Thucydides. These hostilities ended in the conquest of Corcyra by the Corinthian tyrant Periander (Περίανδρος) who induced his new subjects to join in the colonization of Apollonia and Anactorium. The island soon regained its independence and thenceforth devoted itself to a purely mercantile policy. During the Persian invasion of 480 BC it manned the second largest Greek fleet (60 ships), but took no active part in the war. In 435 BC it was again involved in a quarrel with Corinth over the control of Epidamnus, and sought assistance from Athens (see Battle of Sybota).

This new alliance was one of the chief immediate causes of the Peloponnesian War, in which Corcyra was of considerable use to the Athenians as a naval station, but did not render much assistance with its fleet. The island was nearly lost to Athens by two attempts of the oligarchic faction to effect a revolution; on each occasion the popular party ultimately won the day and took a most bloody revenge on its opponents (427 BC and 425 BC).

During the Sicilian campaigns of Athens Corcyra served as a supply base; after a third abortive rising of the oligarchs in 410 BC it practically withdrew from the war. In 375 BC it again joined the Athenian alliance; two years later it was besieged by a Spartan force, but in spite of the devastation of its flourishing countryside held out successfully until relieved. In the Hellenistic period Corcyra was exposed to attack from several sides.

In 303 BC, after a vain siege by Cassander, the island was occupied for a short time by the Lacedaemonian general Cleonymus of Sparta, then regained its independence and later it was attacked and conquered by Agathocles of Syracuse. He offered Corfu as dowry to his daughter Lanassa on her marriage to Pyrrhus, King of Epirus. The island then became a member of the Epirotic alliance. It was then perhaps that the settlement of Cassiope was founded to serve as a base for the King of Epirus&#x27; expeditions. The island remained in the Epirotic alliance until 255 BC when it became independent after the death of Alexander, last King of Epirus. In 229 BC, following the naval battle of Paxos, it was captured by the Illyrians, but was speedily delivered by a Roman fleet and remained a Roman naval station until at least 189 BC. At this time, it was governed by a prefect (presumably nominated by the consuls), but in 148 BC it was attached to the province of Macedonia. 
In 31 BC, it served Octavian (Augustus) as a base against Mark Antony.

===Roman and medieval history===

Christianity arrived in Corfu early; two disciples of Saint Paul, Jason of Tarsus and Sosipatrus of Patras, taught the Gospel, and according to tradition the city of Corfu and much of the island converted to Christianity. Their relics were housed in the old cathedral (at the site of the current Old Fortress, before a dedicated church was built for them .

During Late Antiquity (late Roman/early Byzantine period), the island formed part of the province of Epirus Vetus in the praetorian prefecture of Illyricum. In 551, during the Gothic War, the Ostrogoths raided the island and destroyed the city of Corfu, then known as &quot;Chersoupolis&quot; (Χερσούπολις, &quot;city on the promontory&quot;) because of its location between Garitsa Bay and Kanoni. Over the next centuries, the main settlement was moved north, to the location of the current Old Fortress, where the rocky hills offered natural protection against raids. From the twin peaks of the new site, the medieval city received its new name, &quot;Korypho&quot; (Κορυφώ, &quot;city on the peak&quot;) or &quot;Korphoi&quot; (Κορφοί, &quot;peaks&quot;), whence the modern Western name of &quot;Corfu&quot;. The previous site of the city, now known as &quot;Palaiopolis&quot; (Παλαιόπολις, &quot;old city&quot;), continued to be inhabited for several centuries, however.

From at least the early 9th century, Corfu and the other Ionian Islands formed part of the theme of Cephallenia. This naval theme provided a defensive bulwark for Byzantium against western threats, but also played a major role in securing the sealanes to the Byzantine possessions in southern Italy. Indeed, traveller reports from throughout the middle Byzantine period (8th–12th centuries) make clear that Corfu was &quot;an important staging post for travels between East and West&quot;. Indeed, the medieval name of Corfu first appears (Latinized &quot;Coryphus&quot;) in Liutprand of Cremona&#x27;s account of his 968 embassy to the Byzantine court. Corfu enjoyed relative peace and safety during the Macedonian dynasty (867–1054), which allowed the construction of a monumental church to Saints Iason and Sosipatrus outside the city wall of Palaiopolis. Nevertheless, in 933, the city, led by its archbishop, Arsenios, withstood a Saracen attack; Arsenios was canonized and became the city&#x27;s patron saint.

The peace and prosperity of the Macedonian era ended with another Saracen attack in 1033, but more importantly with the emergence of a new threat: following the Norman conquest of Southern Italy, the ambitious Norman monarchs set their sights on expansion in the East. Three times on the space of a century Corfu was the first target and served as a staging area for the Norman invasions of Byzantium. The first Norman occupation from 1081 to 1084 was ended only after the Byzantine emperor Alexios I Komnenos secured the aid of the Republic of Venice, in exchange to wide-ranging commercial concessions to Venetian merchants. The admiral George of Antioch captured Corfu again in 1147, and it took a ten-month siege for Manuel I Komnenos to recover the island in 1149. In the third invasion in 1185, the island was again captured by William II of Sicily, but was soon regained by Isaac II Angelos.

During the break-up of the Byzantine Empire the island was occupied by Genoese privateers (1197–1207), who in turn were expelled by the Venetians. In 1214 it passed to the Greek despots of Epirus, who gave it to Manfred of Sicily as a dowry in 1259. At his death in 1267 it passed to the House of Anjou. Thus, Corfu became a part of the Angevin Kingdom of Albania that was established and ruled by Frankish Charles of Anjou of the royal Capetian dynasty. Under the latter, the island suffered considerably from the inroads of various adventurers.

The island was one of the first places in Europe in which Romani people settled. In about 1360, a fiefdom, called the &quot;Feudum Acinganorum&quot; was established, with mainly Romani serfs. From 1386, Corfu was controlled by the Republic of Venice, which in 1401 acquired formal sovereignty and retained it until the French Occupation of 1797. Corfu became central for the propagation of the activities of the Filiki Etaireia among the Greek Diaspora and philhellenic societies across Europe, through nobles like Ioannis Kapodistrias and Dionysios Romas.

===Venetian rule===

From medieval times and into the 17th century, the island was recognised as a bulwark of the European States against the Ottoman Empire and became one of the most fortified places in Europe. The fortifications of the island were used by the Venetians to defend against Ottoman intrusion into the Adriatic. Corfu repulsed several Ottoman sieges, before passing under British rule following the Napoleonic Wars.

Kerkyra, the &quot;Door of Venice&quot; during the centuries when the whole Adriatic was the Gulf of Venice, remained in Venetian hands from 1401 until 1797, though several times assailed by Ottoman naval and land forces and subjected to four notable sieges in 1537, 1571, 1573 and 1716, in which the strength of the city defences asserted itself time after time. The effectiveness of the powerful Venetian fortifications as well as the strength of some old Byzantine castles in Angelokastro, Kassiopi Castle, Gardiki and elsewhere, were additional factors that enabled Corfu to remain free. Will Durant claimed that Corfu owed to the Republic of Venice the fact that it was one of the few parts of Greece never conquered by the Ottomans.

A series of attempts by the Ottomans to take the island began in 1431 when Ottoman troops under Ali Bey landed on the island. The Ottomans tried to take the city castle and raided the surrounding area, but were repulsed.

The Siege of Corfu (1537) was the first great siege by the Ottomans. It began on 29 August 1537, with 25,000 soldiers from the Ottoman fleet landing and pillaging the island and taking 20,000 hostages as slaves. Despite the destruction wrought on the countryside, the city castle held out in spite of repeated attempts over twelve days to take it, and the Turks left the island unsuccessfully because of poor logistics and an epidemic that decimated their ranks.

Thirty-four years later, in August 1571, Ottoman forces returned for yet another attempt to conquer the island. Having seized Parga and Mourtos from the Greek mainland side, they attacked the Paxi islands. Subsequently they landed on Corfu&#x27;s southeast shore and established a large beachhead all the way from the southern tip of the island at Lefkimi to Ipsos in Corfu&#x27;s eastern midsection. These areas were thoroughly pillaged as in past encounters. Nevertheless the city castle stood firm again, a testament to Corfiot-Venetian steadfastness as well as the Venetian castle-building engineering skills. Another castle, Angelokastro, situated on the northwest coast near Palaiokastritsa (Greek: Παλαιοκαστρίτσα meaning &quot;Old Castle place&quot;) and located on particularly steep and rocky terrain, also held out. The castle is a tourist attraction today.
These defeats in the east and the west of the island proved decisive, and the Ottomans abandoned their siege and departed. Two years later they repeated their attempt. Coming from Africa after a victorious campaign, they landed in Corfu and wreaked havoc on rural areas. Following a counterattack by the Venetian-Corfiot forces, the Ottoman troops were forced to leave the city sailing away.

The second great siege of Corfu took place in 1716, during the last Ottoman–Venetian War (1714–18). After the conquest of the Peloponnese in 1715, the Ottoman fleet appeared in Buthrotum opposite Corfu. On 8 July the Ottoman fleet, carrying 33,000 men, sailed to Corfu from Buthrotum and established a beachhead at Ipsos. The same day, the Venetian fleet encountered the Ottoman fleet off the Corfu Channel and defeated it in the ensuing naval battle. On 19 July, after taking a few outlying forts, the Ottoman army reached the hills around the city of Corfu and laid siege to it. Despite repeated assaults and heavy fighting, the Ottomans were unable to breach the defences and were forced to raise the siege after 22 days. The 5,000 Venetians and foreign mercenaries, together with 3,000 Corfiotes, under the leadership of Count von der Schulenburg who commanded the defence of the island, were victorious once more. The success was owed in no small part to the extensive fortifications, where Venetian castle engineering had proven itself once again against considerable odds. The repulse of the Ottomans was widely celebrated in Europe, Corfu being seen as a bastion of Western civilization against the Ottoman tide. Today, however, this role is often relatively unknown or ignored, but was celebrated in &quot;Juditha triumphans&quot; by the Venetian composer Antonio Vivaldi.

====Venetian policies and legacy====
Corfu&#x27;s urban architecture differs from that of other major Greek cities, because of Corfu&#x27;s unique history. From 1386 to 1797, Corfu was ruled by Venetian nobility; much of the city reflects this era when the island belonged to the Republic of Venice, with multi-storeyed buildings on narrow lanes. The Old Town of Corfu has clear Venetian influence and is amongst the World Heritage Sites in Greece. It was in the Venetian period that the city saw the erection of the first opera house (Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo di Corfù) in Greece.

Many Venetian-speaking families settled in Corfu during these centuries; they were called Corfiot Italians, and until the second half of the 20th century the &quot;Veneto da mar&quot; was spoken in Corfu. During this time, the local Greek language assimilated a large number of Italian and Venetian words, many of which are still common today. The internationally renowned Venetian-born British photographer Felice Beato (1832–1909) is thought to have spent much of his childhood in Corfu. Also many Italian Jews took refuge in Corfu during the Venetian centuries and spoke their own language (Italkian), a mixture of Hebrew-Italian in a Venetian or Apulian dialect with some Greek words.

Venetians promoted the Catholic Church during their four centuries of rule in Corfu. Today the majority of Corfiots are Greek Orthodox, but the small Catholic minority (5%), living harmoniously with the Orthodox community, owes its faith to these origins. These contemporary Catholics are mostly families who came from Malta, but also from Italy, and today the Catholic community numbers about 4,000 ( of Maltese descent), who live almost exclusively in the Venetian &quot;Citadel&quot; of Corfu City. Like other native Greek Catholics, they celebrate Easter using the same calendar as the Greek Orthodox church. The Cathedral of St. James and St. Christopher in Corfu City is the see of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Corfu, Zakynthos and Cephalonia.

The island served also as a refuge for Greek scholars, and in 1732, it became the home of the first academy of modern Greece. A Corfu cleric and scholar, Nikephoros Theotokis (1732–1800) became renowned in Greece as an educator, and in Russia (where he moved later in his life) as an Orthodox archbishop.

The island&#x27;s culture absorbed Venetian influence in a variety of ways; like other Ionian islands (see Cuisine of the Ionian islands), its local cuisine took in such elements and today&#x27;s Corfiot cooking includes Venetian delicacies and recipes: &quot;Pastitsada&quot;, deriving from the Venetian &quot;Pastissada&quot; (Italian: &quot;Spezzatino&quot;) and the most popular dish in the island of Corfu, &quot;Sofrito&quot;, &quot;Strapatsada&quot;, &quot;Savoro&quot;, &quot;Bianco&quot; and &quot;Mandolato&quot;.

===19th century===

By the 1797 Treaty of Campo Formio, Corfu was ceded to the French, who occupied it for two years as the &quot;département&quot; of Corcyre, until they were expelled by a joint Russian-Ottoman squadron under Admiral Ushakov. For a short time it became the capital of a self-governing federation of the Heptanesos (&quot;Seven Islands&quot;), under Ottoman suzerainty; in 1807 after the Treaty of Tilsit its faction-ridden government was again replaced by a French administration under governor François-Xavier Donzelot, and in 1809 it was besieged in vain by a British Royal Navy fleet, which had captured all the other Ionian islands.

Following the final defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo, the Ionian Islands became a protectorate of the United Kingdom by the Treaty of Paris of 5 November 1815 as the United States of the Ionian Islands. Corfu became the seat of the British Lord High Commissioner of the Ionian Islands. The period of British rule led to investment in new roads, an improved water supply system, and the expansion of the Ionian Academy into a university. During this period the Greek language became the official language.

Following a plebiscite the Second National Assembly of the Greeks at Athens elected a new king, Prince Wilhelm (William) of Denmark, who took the name George I and brought with him the Ionian Islands as a coronation gift from Britain. On 29 March 1864, the United Kingdom, Greece, France and Russia signed the Treaty of London, pledging the transfer of sovereignty to Greece upon ratification. Thus, on 21 May, by proclamation of the Lord High Commissioner, the Ionian Islands were united with Greece.

====British Lord High Commissioners during the protectorate====

In 1891, an anti-Semitic pogrom took place to oppose Jewish participation in elections. Later, blood libel caused riots, it lasted three weeks and some 22 Jews died. A part of the Jewish population preferred to leave the island, mainly for Thessaloniki, the Ottoman territories being more welcoming. It was following these events that Albert Cohen&#x27;s family settled in Marseille.

=== First World War ===
During the First World War, the island served as a refuge for the Serbian army that retreated there on Allied forces&#x27; ships from a homeland occupied by the Austrians, Germans and Bulgarians. During their stay, a large portion of Serbian soldiers died from exhaustion, food shortage, and various diseases. Most of their remains were buried at sea near the island of Vido, a small island at the mouth of Corfu port, and a monument of thanks to the Greek nation has been erected at Vido by the grateful Serbs; consequently, the waters around Vido Island are known by the Serbian people as the Blue Tomb (in Serbian, Плава Гробница, Plava Grobnica), after a poem written by Milutin Bojić following World War I.

===Interwar period===
In 1923, after a diplomatic dispute between Italy and Greece, Italian forces bombarded and occupied Corfu. The League of Nations settled this Corfu incident in Italy&#x27;s favour.

===Second World War===
====Italian occupation and resistance====
During the Greco-Italian War, Corfu was occupied by the Italians in April 1941. They administered Corfu and the Ionian islands as a separate entity from Greece until September 1943, following Benito Mussolini&#x27;s orders of fulfilling Italian Irredentism and making Corfu part of the Kingdom of Italy. During the Second World War the 10th Infantry Regiment of the Greek Army, composed mainly of Corfiot soldiers, was assigned the task of defending Corfu. The regiment took part in &quot;Operation Latzides&quot;, which was an unsuccessful attempt to stem the forces of the Italians. After Greece&#x27;s surrender to the Axis, the island came under Italian control and occupation. On the first Sunday of November 1941, high school students from all over Corfu took part in student protests against the occupying Italian army; these student protests of the island were among the first acts of overt popular Resistance in occupied Greece and a rare phenomenon even by wartime European standards. Subsequently, a considerable number of Corfiots escaped to Epirus in mainland Greece and enlisted as partisans in ELAS and EDES, in order to join the resistance movement gathering in the mainland.

====German bombing and occupation====
Upon the fall of Italian fascism in 1943, the Nazis moved to take control of the island. On 14 September 1943, Corfu was bombarded by the Luftwaffe. The Nazi bombing raids destroyed most of the city&#x27;s buildings, including churches, homes, and whole city blocks, especially in the Jewish quarter Evraiki. Other losses included the city&#x27;s market (αγορά) and the hotel Bella Venezia. The worst losses were the historic buildings of the Ionian Academy (Ιόνιος Ακαδημία), the Municipal Theatre (which in 1901 had replaced the &quot;Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo di Corfù&quot;), the Municipal Library, and the Ionian Parliament.

Following the Wehrmacht invasion, the Italians capitulated, and the island came under German occupation. Corfu&#x27;s mayor at the time, Kollas, was a known collaborator and various anti-semitic laws were passed by the Nazi occupation government of the island. In early June 1944, while the Allies bombed Corfu as a diversion from the Normandy landings, the Gestapo rounded up the Jews of the city, temporarily incarcerated them at the old fort (Palaio Frourio), and on 10 June sent them to Auschwitz II, where most of them were murdered by gas. Approximately two hundred out of a total population of 1,900 escaped. Many among the local population at the time provided shelter and refuge to those 200 Jews who managed to escape the Nazis. In &quot;Evraiki&quot; (Εβραική, meaning &quot;Jewish quarter&quot;), there is currently a synagogue with about 65 members, who still speak their original Italkian language.

====Liberation====
Corfu was liberated by British troops, specifically the 40th Royal Marine Commando, which landed in Corfu on 14 October 1944, as the Germans were evacuating Greece. The Royal Navy swept the Corfu Channel for mines in 1944 and 1945, and found it to be free of mines. A large minefield was laid there shortly afterwards by the newly communist Albania and gave rise to the Corfu Channel Incident. This incident led to the Corfu Channel Case, where the United Kingdom opened a case against the People&#x27;s Republic of Albania at the International Court of Justice.

===Post–World War and modern Corfu===
After World War II and the Greek Civil War, the island was rebuilt under the general programme of reconstruction of the Greek Government (Ανοικοδόμησις) and many elements of its classical architecture remain. Its economy grew but a portion of its inhabitants left the island for other parts of the country; buildings erected during Italian occupation – such as schools or government buildings – were put back to civic use. In 1956 Maria Desylla Kapodistria, relative of first Governor (head of state) of Greece Ioannis Kapodistrias, was elected mayor of Corfu and became the first female mayor in Greece. The Corfu General Hospital was also constructed; electricity was introduced to the villages in the 1950s, the radio substation of Hellenic Radio in Corfu was inaugurated in March 1957, and television was introduced in the 1960s, with internet connections in 1995. The Ionian University was established in 1984.

==Architecture==
===Venetian influence===

Corfu&#x27;s urban architecture influence derives from Venice, reflecting the fact that from 1386 to 1797 the island was ruled by the Venetians. The architecture of the Old Town of Corfu along with its narrow streets, the , has clear Venetian influence and is amongst the World Heritage Sites in Greece. Other notable Venetian-era buildings include the Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo di Corfù, the first Greek opera house, and &quot;Liston&quot;, a multi-level commercial and residential building, with an arched colonnade at ground level, lined with cafes and restaurants on its east side, and restaurants and other stores on its west side. Liston&#x27;s main thoroughfare is often the site of parades and other mass gatherings. Liston is on the edge of the &quot;Spianada&quot; (Esplanade), the vast main plaza and park which incorporates a cricket field, a pavilion, and Maitland&#x27;s monument. Also notable are the Old and New forts, the recently restored Palace of Sts. Michael and George, formerly the residence of the British colonial governor and the seat of the Ionian Senate, and the summer Palace of &quot;Mon Repos&quot;, formerly the property of the Greek royal family and birthplace of the Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. The Park of Mon Repos is built on part of the Palaiopolis of Kerkyra, where excavations were conducted by the Greek Archaeological Service in collaboration with academics and universities internationally. Examples of the finds can be found in the Museum of the Palace of Mon Repos and at the Archaeological Museum of Corfu.

===The Achilleion===

In 1889, Empress Elisabeth of Austria built a summer palace in the region of Gastouri (Γαστούρι) to the south of the city, naming it Achílleion (Αχίλλειον) after the Homeric hero Achilles. The structure is filled with paintings and statues of Achilles, both in the main hall and in the gardens, depicting scenes of the Trojan War. The palace, with the neoclassical Greek statues that surround it, is a monument to platonic romanticism as well as escapism. It served as a refuge for the grieving Empress following the tragic death of her only son Crown Prince, Rudolf.

The Imperial gardens on the hill look over the surrounding green hills and valleys and the Ionian Sea. The centrepiece of the gardens is a marble statue on a high pedestal, of the mortally wounded Achilles (Greek: Αχιλλεύς Θνήσκων, &quot;Achilleús Thnēskōn&quot;, Achilles Dying) without hubris and wearing only a simple cloth and an ancient Greek hoplite helmet. This statue was carved by German sculptor Ernst Gustav Herter.

The hero is presented devoid of rank or status, and seems notably human, though heroic, as he is forever trying to pull Paris&#x27;s arrow from his heel. His classically depicted face is full of pain. He gazes skyward, as if to seek help from Olympus. According to Greek mythology, his mother Thetis was a goddess.

In contrast, at the great staircase in the main hall is a giant painting of the triumphant Achilles full of pride. Dressed in full royal military regalia and erect on his racing chariot, he pulls the lifeless body of Hector of Troy in front of the stunned crowd watching helplessly from inside the walls of the Trojan citadel.

In 1898, Empress Sissi was assassinated at the age of 60 by an Italian anarchist, Luigi Lucheni, in Geneva, Switzerland. After her death, the palace was sold to the German Kaiser Wilhelm II. Following the Kaiser&#x27;s purchase of the Achilleion, he invited archaeologist Reinhard Kekulé von Stradonitz, a friend and advisor, to come to Corfu to advise him where to position the huge statue of Achilles which he commissioned. The famous salute to Achilles from the Kaiser, which had been inscribed at the statue&#x27;s base, was also created by Kekulé. The inscription read: The inscription was subsequently removed after World War II.

The Achilleion was eventually acquired by the Greek state and has now been converted into a museum.

===Kaiser&#x27;s Bridge===
German Kaiser Wilhelm II was also fond of taking holidays in Corfu. Having purchased the Achilleion in 1907 after Sissi&#x27;s death, he appointed Carl Ludwig Sprenger as the botanical architect of the Palace, and also built a bridge later named by the locals after him—the &quot;Kaiser&#x27;s bridge&quot; (Greek: η γέφυρα του Κάιζερ transliterated as: i gefyra tou Kaizer)—to access the beach without traversing the road forming the island&#x27;s main artery to the south. The bridge, arching over the road, spanned the distance between the lower gardens of Achilleion and the nearby beach; its remains are an important landmark on the highway. The bridge&#x27;s central section was demolished by the Wehrmacht in 1944, during the German occupation of World War II, to allow for the passage of an enormous cannon, forming part of the Nazi defences in the southeastern coast of Corfu.

==Urban landscape==
===Old town===

The Old Town of Corfu city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In several parts of the old city, buildings of the Venetian era are to be found. The old city&#x27;s architectural character is strongly influenced by the Venetian style, coming as it did under Venetian rule for a long period; its small and ancient side streets, and the old buildings&#x27; trademark arches are particularly reminiscent of Venice.

The city of Corfu stands on the broad part of a peninsula, whose termination in the Venetian citadel () is cut off from it by an artificial fosse formed in a natural gully, with a seawater moat at the bottom, that now serves as a marina and is called the &quot;Contrafossa&quot;. In the old town there are many narrow streets paved with cobblestones. These streets are known as (), and the older amongst them sometimes follow the gentle irregularities of the ground; while many are too narrow for vehicular traffic. A promenade rises by the seashore towards the bay of Garitsa (Γαρίτσα), together with an esplanade between the city and the citadel known as &quot;Spianada&quot; with the arcade () to its west side, where restaurants and bistros abound.

===Ano and Kato Plateia and the music pavilion===

Near the old Venetian Citadel a large square called &quot;Spianada&quot; is also to be found, divided by a street in two parts: &quot;Ano Plateia&quot; (literally: &quot;Upper square&quot;) and &quot;Kato Plateia&quot; (literally: &quot;Lower square&quot;), (Ανω Πλατεία and Κάτω Πλατεία in Greek). This is the biggest square in South-Eastern Europe and one of the largest in Europe, and replete with green spaces and interesting structures, such as a Roman-style rotunda from the era of British administration, known as the &quot;Maitland monument&quot;, built to commemorate Sir Thomas Maitland. An ornate music pavilion is also present, where the local &quot;Philharmonikes&quot; (Philharmonic Orchestras) (Φιλαρμονικές), mount classical performances in the artistic and musical tradition for which the island is well known. &quot;Kato Plateia&quot; also serves as a venue where cricket matches are held from time to time. In Greece, cricket is unique to Corfu, as it was once a British protectorate.

===Palaia Anaktora and its gardens===


Just to the north of &quot;Kato Plateia&quot; lie the &quot;Palaia Anaktora&quot; (Παλαιά Ανάκτορα: literally &quot;Old Palaces&quot;): a large complex of buildings of Roman architectural style which formerly housed the Kings of Greece, and prior to that the British Governors of the island. It was then called the Palace of Saints Michael and George. The Order of St. Michael and St. George was founded here in 1818 with motto &quot;auspicium melioris aevi&quot;, and is still awarded by the United Kingdom. Today the palace is open to the public and forms a complex of halls and buildings housing art exhibits, including a Museum of Asian Art, unique across Southern Europe in its scope and in the richness of its Chinese and Asian exhibits. The gardens of the Palaces, complete with old Venetian stone aquariums, exotic trees and flowers, overlook the bay through old Venetian fortifications and turrets, and the local sea baths (Μπάνια τ&#x27; Αλέκου) are at the foot of the fortifications surrounding the gardens. A café on the grounds includes its own art gallery, with exhibitions of both local and international artists, known locally as the Art Café. From the same spot, the viewer can observe ships passing through the narrow channel of the historic Vido island (Νησί Βίδου) to the north, on their way to Corfu harbour (Νέο Λιμάνι), with high speed retractable aerofoil ferries from Igoumenitsa also cutting across the panorama. A wrought-iron aerial staircase, closed to visitors, descends to the sea from the gardens; the Greek royal family used it as a shortcut to the baths. Rewriting history, locals now refer to the old Royal Gardens as the &quot;Garden of the People&quot; (Ο Κήπος του Λαού).

===Churches===
In the city, there are thirty-seven Greek churches, the most important of which are the city&#x27;s cathedral, the church dedicated to Our Lady of the Cave (η Παναγία Σπηλιώτισσα (hē Panagia Spēliōtissa)); Saint Spyridon Church, wherein lies the preserved body of the patron saint of the island; and finally the suburban church of St Jason and St Sosipater (Αγιοι Ιάσων και Σωσίπατρος), reputedly the oldest in the island, and named after the two saints probably the first to preach Christianity to the Corfiots.

=== Pontikonisi ===
The nearby island, known as Pontikonisi (Greek meaning &quot;mouse island&quot;), though small is very green with abundant trees, and at its highest natural elevation (excluding its trees or man-made structures, such as the monastery), stands at about . Pontikonisi is home of the monastery of Pantokrator (Μοναστήρι του Παντοκράτορος); the white stone staircase of the monastery, viewed from afar, gives the impression of a (mouse) tail, which lent the island its name.

==Archaeology==
===Palaiopolis===
In the city of Corfu, the ruins of the ancient city of Korkyra, also known as &quot;Palaiopolis&quot;, include ancient temples which were excavated at the location of the palace of Mon Repos, which was built on the ruins of the Palaiopolis. The temples are: Kardaki Temple, Temple of Artemis, and the Temple of Hera. Hera&#x27;s temple is situated at the western limits of Mon Repos, close to Kardaki Temple and to the northwest. It is approximately 700 m. to the southeast of the Temple of Artemis in Corfu. Hera&#x27;s Temple was built at the top of Analipsis Hill, and, because of its prominent location, it was highly visible to ships passing close to the waterfront of ancient Korkyra.

===Kardaki Temple===

Kardaki Temple is an Archaic Doric temple in Corfu, Greece, built around 500 BC in the ancient city of Korkyra (or Corcyra), in what is known today as the location Kardaki in the hill of Analipsi in Corfu. The temple features several architectural peculiarities that point to a Doric origin. The temple at Kardaki is unusual because it has no frieze, following perhaps architectural tendencies of Sicilian temples.

It is considered to be the only Greek temple of Doric architecture that does not have a frieze. The spacing of the temple columns has been described as &quot;abnormally wide&quot;. The temple also lacked both porch and adyton, and the lack of a triglyph and metope frieze may be indicative of Ionian influence. The temple at Kardaki is considered an important and to a certain degree mysterious topic on the subject of early ancient Greek architecture. Its association with the worship of Apollo or Poseidon has not been established.

===Temple of Artemis===

The Temple of Artemis is an Archaic Greek temple in Corfu, built in around 580 BC in the ancient city of Korkyra (or Corcyra), in what is known today as the suburb of Garitsa. The temple was dedicated to Artemis. It is known as the first Doric temple exclusively built with stone. It is also considered the first building to have incorporated all of the elements of the Doric architectural style. Very few Greek temple reliefs from the Archaic period have survived, and the large fragments of the group from the pediment are the earliest significant survivals.

The temple was a peripteral–styled building with a pseudodipteral configuration. Its perimeter was rectangular, with width of and length with an eastward orientation so that light could enter the interior of the temple at sunrise. It was one of the largest temples of its time.

The metope of the temple was probably decorated, since remnants of reliefs featuring Achilles and Memnon were found in the ancient ruins. The temple has been described as a milestone of Ancient Greek architecture and one of 150 masterpieces of Western architecture. The Corfu temple architecture may have influenced the design of an archaic sanctuary structure found at St. Omobono in Italy, near Tiber in Ancient Rome, at the time of the Etruscans, which incorporates similar design elements. If still in use by the 4th-century, the temple would have been closed during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire, when the Christian Emperors issued edicts prohibiting non-Christian worship. Kaiser Wilhelm II, while vacationing at his summer palace of Achilleion in Corfu and while Europe was preparing for war, was involved in excavations at the site of the ancient temple.

===Temple of Hera===

The Temple of Hera or Heraion is an archaic temple in Corfu, built around 610 BC in the ancient city of Korkyra (or Corcyra), in what is known today as &quot;Palaiopolis&quot;, and lies within the ground of the Mon Repos estate. The sanctuary of Hera at Mon Repos is considered a major temple, and one of the earliest examples of archaic Greek architecture.

Large terracotta figures such as lions, gorgoneions, and Daidala maidens, created and painted in vivid colour by artisans, who were inspired by myth traditions across the Mediterranean, decorated the roof of the temple, making it one of the most intricately adorned temples of Archaic Greece and the most ambitious roof construction project of its time. Built at the top of Analipsis Hill, Hera&#x27;s sanctuary was highly visible to ships approaching the waterfront of the ancient city of Korkyra.

The &quot;Digital Archaic Heraion Project at Mon Repos&quot; is a project that has undertaken the task of digitising the architectural fragments found at the Corfu Heraion with the aim to reconstruct in 3D the Temple at Palaiopolis in virtual space.

===Tomb of Menecrates===


The Tomb of Menecrates or Monument of Menecrates is an Archaic cenotaph in Corfu, built around 600 BC in the ancient city of Korkyra (or Corcyra). The tomb and the funerary sculpture of a lion were discovered in 1843 during demolition works by the British Army who were demolishing a Venetian fortress in the location of Garitsa hill in Corfu. The tomb is dated to the 6th century BC.

The lion is dated at the end of the 7th century BC and it is one of the earliest funerary lions ever found. The tomb and the lion were found in an area which was part of the necropolis of ancient Korkyra, which was discovered by the British army at the time. According to an Ancient Greek inscription found on the grave, the tomb was a monument built by the ancient Korkyreans in honour of their proxenos (ambassador) Menecrates, son of Tlasios, from Oeiantheia. Menecrates was the ambassador of ancient Korkyra to Oeiantheia, modern day Galaxidi or Ozolian Locris, and he was lost at sea. In the inscription it is also mentioned that the brother of Menecrates, Praximenes, had arrived from Oeiantheia to assist the people of Korkyra in building the monument to his brother.

===Other archaeological sites===
In Cassiope, the only other city of ancient importance, its name is still preserved by the village of Kassiopi, and there are some rude remains of building on the site; but the temple of Zeus Cassius for which it was celebrated has totally disappeared.

==Castles==
The castles of Corfu, located at strategic points on the island helped defend the island from many invaders and they were instrumental in repulsing repeated Turkish invasions, making Corfu one of the few places in Greece never to be conquered by the Ottomans.

===Palaio Frourio===


The &quot;old citadel&quot; (in Greek &quot;Palaio Frourio&quot; (Παλαιό Φρούριο) is an old Venetian fortress built on an artificial islet with fortifications surrounding its entire perimeter, although some sections, particularly on the east side, are slowly being eroded and falling into the sea. Nonetheless, the interior has been restored and is in use for cultural events, such as concerts (συναυλίες) and Sound and Light Productions (Ηχος και Φως), when historical events are recreated using sound and light special effects. These events take place amidst the ancient fortifications, with the Ionian Sea in the background. The central high point of the citadel rises like a giant natural obelisk complete with a military observation post at the top, with a giant cross at its apex; at the foot of the observatory lies St. George&#x27;s church, in a classical style punctuated by six Doric columns, as opposed to the Byzantine architectural style of the greater part of Greek Orthodox churches.

===Neo Frourio===

The &quot;new citadel&quot; or &quot;Neo Frourio&quot; (Νέο Φρούριο, &quot;New Fortress&quot;) is a huge complex of fortifications built by the British during their rule of the island (1815–63) dominating the northeastern part of the city. The huge walls of the fortress loom over the landscape as one travels from &quot;Neo Limani&quot; (Νέο Λιμάνι, &quot;New Port&quot;) to the city, taking the road that passes through the fishmarket (ψαραγορά). The new citadel was until recently a restricted area due to the presence of a naval garrison, but old restrictions have been lifted and it is now open to the public, with tours possible through the maze of medieval corridors and fortifications. The winged Lion of St Mark, the symbol of Venice, can be seen at regular intervals adorning the fortifications.

===Angelokastro===

Angelokastro ( (Castle of Angelos or Castle of the Angel); ) is a Byzantine castle on the island of Corfu, Greece. It is located at the top of the highest peak of the island&#x27;s shoreline in the northwest coast near Palaiokastritsa and built on particularly precipitous and rocky terrain. It stands on a steep cliff above the sea and surveys the City of Corfu and the mountains of mainland Greece to the southeast and a wide area of Corfu toward the northeast and northwest.

Angelokastro is one of the most important fortified complexes of Corfu. It was an acropolis which surveyed the region all the way to the southern Adriatic and presented a formidable strategic vantage point to the occupant of the castle.

Angelokastro formed a defensive triangle with the castles of Gardiki and Kassiopi, which covered Corfu&#x27;s defences to the south, northwest and northeast. The castle never fell, despite frequent sieges and attempts at conquering it through the centuries, and played a decisive role in defending the island against pirate incursions and during three sieges of Corfu by the Ottomans, significantly contributing to their defeat. During invasions it helped shelter the local peasant population. The villagers also fought against the invaders playing an active role in the defence of the castle. Angelokastro, located at the western frontier of the Empire, was instrumental in repulsing the Ottomans during the first great siege of Corfu in 1537, in the siege of 1571 and the second great siege of Corfu in 1716 causing the Ottomans to fail at penetrating the defences of Corfu in the North. Consequently the Turks were never able to create a beachhead and to occupy the island.

===Gardiki Castle===

Gardiki Castle () is a 13th-century Byzantine castle on the southwestern coast of Corfu and the only surviving medieval fortress on the southern part of the island. It was built by a ruler of the Despotate of Epirus, and was one of three castles which defended the island before the Venetian era (1401–1797).

The location of Gardiki at the narrow southwest flank of Corfu provided protection to the fields and the southern lowlands of Corfu and in combination with Kassiopi Castle on the northeastern coast of the island and Byzantine Angelokastro protecting the northwestern shore of Corfu, formed a triangular line of defence which protected Corfu during the pre-Venetian era.

===Kassiopi Castle===

Kassiopi Castle () is a castle on the northeastern coast of Corfu overseeing the fishing village of Kassiopi. It was one of three Byzantine-period castles that defended the island before the Venetian era (1386–1797). The castles formed a defensive triangle, with Gardiki guarding the island&#x27;s south, Kassiopi the northeast and Angelokastro the northwest.

Its position at the northeastern coast of Corfu overseeing the Corfu Channel that separates the island from the mainland gave the castle an important vantage point and an elevated strategic significance.

Kassiopi Castle is considered one of the most imposing architectural remains in the Ionian Islands, along with Angelokastro, Gardiki Castle and the two Venetian Fortresses of Corfu City, the Citadel and the New Fort.

Since the castle was abandoned for a long time, its structure is in a state of ruin. The eastern side of the fort has disappeared and only a few traces of it remain. There are indications that castle stones have been used as building material for houses in the area. Access to the fortress is mainly from the southeast through a narrow walkway which includes passage from homes and backyards, since the castle is at the centre of the densely built area of the small village of Kassiopi.

==Municipalities==
The three present municipalities of Corfu and Diapontia Islands were formed in the 2019 local government reform from the former municipality Corfu.

*Central Corfu and Diapontia Islands
*North Corfu
*South Corfu

==Education==
===Ionian Academy===

The Ionian Academy was an institution that maintained the tradition of Greek education while the rest of Greece was still under Ottoman rule. The academy was established by the French during their administration of the island as the &quot;département&quot; of Corcyre, and became a university during the British administration, through the actions of Frederick North, 5th Earl of Guilford in 1824. It is also considered the precursor of the Ionian University. It had Philological, Law, and Medical Schools.

===Ionian University===

The Ionian University was established in 1984, in recognition, by the administration of Andreas Papandreou, of Corfu&#x27;s contribution to Education in Greece, as the seat of the first Greek university in modern times, the Ionian Academy. The university opened its doors to students in 1985 and today comprises three Schools and six Departments offering undergraduate and post-graduate degree programmes and summer schools.

===Student activism===
In the modern era, beginning with its massive student protests during World War II against fascist occupation, and continuing in the fight against the dictatorship of Georgios Papadopoulos (1967–1974), students in Corfu have played a vanguard role in protesting for freedom and democracy in Greece, against both internal and external oppression. For Corfiotes a recent example of such heroism is that of geology student Kostas Georgakis, who set himself ablaze in Genoa, Italy on 19 September 1970, in a protest against the Greek military junta of 1967-1974.

==Culture==
Corfu has a long musical, theatrical, and operatic tradition. The operas performed in Corfu were at par with their European counterparts. The phrase &quot;applaudito in Corfu&quot; (applauded in Corfu) was a measure of high accolade for an opera performed on the island. The Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo di Corfù was the first theatre and opera house of modern Greece and the place where the first Greek opera, Spyridon Xyndas&#x27; &quot;The Parliamentary Candidate&quot; (based on an exclusively Greek libretto) was performed.

=== Museums and libraries ===
The most notable of Corfu&#x27;s museums and libraries are located in the city; these include:

*The Archaeological Museum, inaugurated in 1967, was constructed to house the exhibit of the huge Gorgon pediment of the Artemis temple in the ancient city of Korkyra, excavated at Palaiopolis in the early 20th century. The pediment has been described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as the &quot;finest example of archaic temple sculpture extant&quot;. Kaiser Wilhelm II had developed a &quot;lifelong obsession&quot; with the Gorgon sculpture, dating from seminars on Greek Archaeology the Kaiser attended while at the University of Bonn. The seminars were given by archaeologist Reinhard Kekulé von Stradonitz, who later became the Kaiser&#x27;s advisor. In 1994, two more halls were added to the museum, where new discoveries from the excavations of the ancient city and the Garitsa cemetery are exhibited.
*The Museum of Asian art of Corfu is located at the Palace of St. Michael and St. George (mainly Chinese and Japanese Arts); its unique collection is housed in 15 rooms, taking in over 12,000 artifacts, including a Greco-Buddhist art collection that shows the influence of Alexander the Great on Buddhist culture as far as Pakistan (see Greco-Buddhism).
*The Banknote Museum, located in Aghios Spyridon square, features a complete collection of Greek banknotes from independence to the adoption of the euro in 2002.
*The Byzantine Museum of Antivouniotissa, a church converted into a museum featuring rare Byzantine art.
*Kapodistrias Museum.

===Patron Saint Spyridon===
Saint Spyridon the Thaumaturgist (Miracle-worker, Θαυματουργός) is the patron saint (πολιούχος) of the city and the island. St. Spyridon is revered for the miracle of expelling the plague (πανώλη) from the island, among many other miracles attributed to him. It is believed by the faithful that on its way from the island the plague scratched one of the fortification stones of the old citadel to indicate its fury at being expelled; to St. Spyridon is also attributed the role of saving the island at the second great siege of Corfu in 1716. The legend says that the sight of St. Spyridon approaching Ottoman forces bearing a flaming torch in one hand and a cross in the other caused panic. The legend also states that the Saint caused a tempest which was partly responsible for repulsing the Ottomans. This victory over the Ottomans, therefore, was attributed not only to the leadership of Count Schulenburg who commanded the stubborn defence of the island against Ottoman forces, but also to the miraculous intervention of St. Spyridon. Venice honoured von der Schulenburg and the Corfiots for successfully defending the island. Recognizing St. Spyridon&#x27;s role in the defence of the island Venice legislated the establishment of the litany (λιτανεία) of St Spyridon on 11 August as a commemoration of the miraculous event, inaugurating a tradition that continues to this day. In 1716 Antonio Vivaldi, on commission by the republic of Venice, composed the oratorio Juditha triumphans to commemorate this great event. &quot;Juditha triumphans&quot; was first performed in November 1716 in Venice by the orchestra and choir of the Ospedale della Pietà and is described as Vivaldi&#x27;s first great oratorio.
Hence Spyridon is a popular first name for Greek males born on the island and/or to islanders.

===Music===

====Musical history====
While much of present-day Greece was under Ottoman rule, the Ionian Islands enjoyed a Golden Age in music and opera. Corfu was the capital city of a Venetian protectorate and it benefited from a unique musical and theatrical heritage. Then in the 19th century, as a British Protectorate, Corfu developed a musical heritage of its own and which constitutes the nucleus of modern Greek musical history. Until the early 18th century, musical life took place in city and village squares, with performances of straight or musical comedies – known as Momaries or Bobaries. From 1720, Corfu became the possessor of the first theatre in post-1452 Greece. It was the Teatro San Giacomo (now the City Hall) named after the nearby Roman Catholic cathedral (completed in 1691).

The island was also the center of the Ionian School of music, the musical production of a group of Heptanesian composers, whose heyday was from the early 19th century till approximately the 1950s. It was the first school of classical music in Greece and it was a heavy influence for the later Greek music scene, after the independence.

====The three Philharmonics====
Corfu&#x27;s Philharmonic Societies provide free instruction in music, and continue to attract young recruits. There are nineteen such marching wind bands throughout the island. Corfu city is home to the three most prestigious bands – in order of seniority:
*the Philharmonic Society of Corfu use dark blue uniforms with dark red accents, and blue and red helmet plumes. It is usually called the &quot;Old Philharmonic&quot; or simply the &quot;Paliá&quot; (&quot;Old&quot;). Founded 12 September 1840.
*the Mantzaros Philharmonic Society use blue uniforms with blue and white helmet plumes. It is commonly called the &quot;Néa&quot; (&quot;New&quot;). Founded 25 October 1890.
*the Capodistria Philharmonic Union use bright red and black uniforms and plumes. It is commonly called the &quot;Cónte Capodístria&quot; or simply the &quot;Cónte&quot; (&quot;Count&quot;). It is the juniormost of the three (founded 18 April 1980).
All three maintain two major bands each, the main marching bands that can field up to 200 musicians on grand occasions, and the 60-strong student &quot;bandinas&quot; meant for lighter fare and on-the-job training.

The bands give regular summer weekend promenade concerts at the Spianada Green &quot;pálko&quot;, and have a prominent part in the yearly Holy Week ceremonies.

====Ionian University music department====

Since the early 1990s a music department has been established at the Ionian University. Aside from its academic activities, concerts in Corfu and abroad, and musicological research in the field of Neo-Hellenic Music, the Department organizes an international music academy every summer, which gathers together both international students and professors specialising in brass, strings, singing, jazz and musicology.

===Theatres and operatic tradition===
====Teatro di San Giacomo====

Under Venetian rule, the Corfiotes developed a fervent appreciation of Italian opera, which was the real source of the extraordinary (given conditions in the mainland of Greece) musical development of the island during this era. The opera house of Corfu during the 18th and 19th centuries was the Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo, named after the neighbouring Catholic cathedral; it was later converted into the City Hall. It was both the first theatre and first opera house of Greece in modern times and the place where the first Greek opera (based on an exclusively Greek libretto), Spyridon Xyndas&#x27; &quot;The Parliamentary Candidate&quot; was performed. A long series of local composers, such as Nikolaos Mantzaros, Spyridon Xyndas, Antonio Liberali, Domenico Padovani, the Zakynthian Pavlos Carrer, the Lambelet family, Spyridon Samaras, and others, all developed careers intertwined with the theatre. San Giacomo&#x27;s place was taken by the Municipal Theatre in 1902, which maintained the operatic tradition vividly until its destruction during German air raid in 1943.

The first opera to be performed in the San Giacomo was in 1733 (&quot;Gerone, tiranno di Siracusa&quot;), and for almost two hundred years, between 1771 and 1943, nearly every major opera from the Italian tradition, as well as many others from Greek and French composers, were performed on the stage of the San Giacomo; this tradition continues to be reflected in Corfiote operatic history, a fixture in famous opera singers&#x27; itineraries.

====Municipal Theatre of Corfu====


The Municipal Theatre of Corfu () was the main theatre and opera house in Corfu. Opened in 1902, the theatre was the successor of Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo di Corfù which became the Corfu city hall. It was destroyed during a Luftwaffe aerial bombardment in 1943.

During its 41-year history, it was one of the premier theatres and opera houses in Greece, and as the first theatre in Southeastern Europe, it contributed to the arts and to the history of the Balkans and of Europe. The archives of the theatre, including the historical San Giacomo archives, all valuables and art were destroyed in the Luftwaffe bombing with the sole exception of the stage curtain, which was not in the premises the night of the bombing and thus escaped harm; among the losses are believed to have been numerous manuscripts of the work of Spyridon Xyndas, composer of the first opera in Greek.

===Festivities===
====Easter====
On Good Friday, from the early afternoon onward, the bands of the three Philharmonic Societies, separated into squads, accompany the Epitaph processions of the city churches. Late in the afternoon, the squads come together to form one band in order to accompany the Epitaph procession of the cathedral, while the funeral marches that the bands play differ depending on the band; the Old Philharmonic play Albinoni&#x27;s &quot;Adagio&quot;, the Mantzaros play Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Marcia Funebre&quot; from Don Carlo, and the Capodistria play Chopin&#x27;s &quot;Funeral March&quot; and Mariani&#x27;s &quot;Sventura&quot;.

On Holy Saturday morning, the three city bands again take part in the Epitaph processions of St. Spyridon Cathedral in procession with the Saint&#x27;s relics. At this point the bands play different funeral marches, with the Mantzaros playing Miccheli&#x27;s &quot;Calde Lacrime&quot;, the Palia playing &quot;Marcia Funebre&quot; from Faccio&#x27;s &quot;Amleto&quot;, and the Capodistria playing the &quot;Funeral March&quot; from Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Eroica&quot;. This custom dates from the 19th century, when colonial administrators banned the participation of the British garrison band in the traditional Holy Friday funeral cortege. The defiant Corfiotes held the litany the following morning, and paraded the relics of St. Spyridon too, so that the administrators would not dare intervene.

The litany is followed , at exactly 11:00 AM, the celebration of the &quot;Early Resurrection&quot;; balconies in the old city are decked in bright red cloth, and Corfiotes throw down large clay pots (the &quot;bótides&quot;, μπότηδες) full of water to smash on the street pavement, especially in wider areas of and in an organised fashion. This is enacted in anticipation of the Resurrection of Jesus, which is to be celebrated that same night, and to commemorate King David&#x27;s phrase: &quot;Thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter&#x27;s vessel&quot; (Psalm 2:9).

Once the &quot;bótides&quot; commotion is over, the three bands parade the clay-strewn streets playing the famous &quot;Graikoí&quot; festive march. The march, which functions as the anthem of the island, was composed during the period of Venetian rule, and its lyrics include: &quot;Greeks, never fear, we are all enslaved: you to the Turks, we to the Venetians, but one day we shall all be free&quot;.

====Ta Karnavalia====
Another venerable Corfu tradition is known as the Carnival or &quot;Ta Karnavalia&quot;. Venetian in origin, festivities include a parade featuring the main attraction of &quot;Karnavalos&quot;, a rather grotesque figure with a large head and smiling face, leading a diverse procession of colourful floats. Corfiots, young and old, dress up in colourful costumes and follow the parade, spilling out into the area&#x27;s narrow streets () and spreading the festivities across the city, dancing and socialising. At night, dance and costume parties are traditional.

It is also mentioned in Brian Jacques&#x27; adventure novel, Voyage of Slaves.

==Tourism==
Corfiotes have a long history of hospitality to foreign residents and visitors, typified in the 20th century by Gerald Durrell&#x27;s childhood reminiscence &quot;My Family and Other Animals&quot;. The north east coast has largely been developed by a few British holiday companies, with large expensive holiday villas. Package holiday resorts exist on the north, east and southwest coasts. Since 2021 there is an extra service added for visitors of the island called The Corfu Island Pass©. This official discount pass of Corfu gives everyone visiting Corfu a discount on sightseeing tours, rentals and cruises.

At the other end of the island, the southern resort of Kavos also provides tourist facilities.

St George South to the west boasts the largest sandy beach on the island coupled with a selection of all-inclusive package hotels and traditional corfiot villas and flats. The Korission lake nature reserve also provides a stopover for European birds migrating south.

Up until the early 20th century, it was mainly visited by the European royals and elites, including Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany and Empress Elisabeth of Austria; today it is also widely visited by middle class families (primarily from the UK, Scandinavia and Germany). With the advent of the jet airliner bringing these groups relatively affordable &#x27;package holidays&#x27;, Corfu was one of the primary destinations for this new form of mass tourism. It is still popular with the ultra-wealthy however, and in the island&#x27;s northeast the homeowners include members of the Rothschild family and Russian oligarchs.

==Transport==

The island is linked by two highways: GR-24 in the northwest and GR-25 in the south.

*Greek National Road 24, Cen., NW, Corfu – Palaiokastritsa
*Greek National Road 25, Cen., S, SE, Corfu – Lefkimi

Corfu has ferry services both by traditional ferries to Gaios in the island of Paxoi and as far as Patras and both traditional ferries and advanced retractable airfoil, hydrodynamic-flow, high-speed ferries called &quot;Flying Dolphins&quot; to Igoumenitsa and Sarandë in neighbouring Albania. The small port of Lefkimmi is also to be found at the southernmost tip of the island on Cape Kavos, offering a ferry service to the mainland.

The Ioannis Kapodistrias International Airport, named after Ioannis Kapodistrias, a Corfiot and European diplomat, and the first governor of the independent Greek state, is located around three kilometres south of Kerkyra, just half a kilometre north of Pontikonisi. The approach and landing, in a northeasterly direction, afford passengers aerial views of &quot;Pontikonisi&quot; and Vlaheraina Monastery, also taking in the hills of &quot;Kanoni&quot;, as the runway employed for landing lies a few hundred metres from these local landmarks. The airport offers domestic flights from Olympic Airlines (OA 600, 602 and 606), and Aegean Airlines (A3 402, 404 and 406). Seaplanes, Air Sea Lines, a Greek seaplane operator, offers scheduled flights from Corfu to Paxoi, Lefkada, Ithaki, Kefalonia, Ioannina, Patras and Brindisi in Italy.

The buses to the main places on the island run about six times a day between the city and Glyfada, Sidari, Paleokastritsa, Roda and Acharavi, Lefkimmi, Lefkimmi and Piri. Other coaches drive up to twice a day to Athens and Thessaloniki. City buses run through the city to the Airport, Achilleion, Gouvia, Afra, Pelekas and some other places of interest.

The Diapontia Islands are accessible by boat with regular services from Corfu port and Agios Stefanos Avliotes and by ferry from Corfu city port.

==Economy==
Corfu is mostly planted with olive groves and vineyards and has been producing olive oil and wine since antiquity. The main wine grape varietals found in Corfu are the indigenous white &quot;Kakotrýgēs&quot; and red &quot;Petrokóritho&quot;, the Cefalonian white &quot;Robóla&quot;, the Aegean &quot;Moscháto&quot; (white muscat), the Achaean &quot;Mavrodáphnē&quot; and others.

Modern times have seen the introduction of specialist cultivation supported by the mild climate, like the kumquat and bergamot oranges, which are extensively used in making spoon sweets and liqueurs. Corfu also produces local animal products, such as Corfiote &quot;graviéra&quot; (a variant of gruyere) and &quot;Corfu&quot; cheese (a variant of Grana); &quot;Corfu butter&quot; (&quot;Boútyro Kerkýras&quot;), an intensely flavored cooking and baking butter made of ewe&#x27;s milk; and the &quot;noúmboulo&quot; salami made of pork and lard and flavored with orange peel, oregano, thyme and other aromatic herbs, which are also burned for smoking.

Local culinary specialties include &quot;sofrito&quot; (a veal rump roast of Venetian origin), &quot;pastitsáda&quot; (bucatini pasta served with diced veal cooked in a tomato sauce), &quot;bourdétto&quot; (cod cooked in a peppery sauce), &quot;mándoles&quot; (caramelized almonds), &quot;pastéli&quot; (honey bars made with sesame, almonds or pistachios), &quot;mandoláto&quot; (a &quot;pastéli&quot; made of crushed almonds, sugar, honey and vanilla), and &quot;tzitzibíra&quot;, the local ginger beer, a remnant of the British era. There are three breweries in Corfu and one bed layers factory.

The island has again become an important port of call and has a considerable trade in olive oil. In earlier times there was a great export of citron, which was cultivated here, including for ritual use in the Jewish community during the Sukkot holiday.

<text>In welfare economics, a Pareto improvement formalizes the idea of an outcome being &quot;better in every possible way&quot;. A change is called a Pareto improvement if it leaves at least one person in society better-off without leaving anyone else worse off than they were before. A situation is called Pareto efficient or Pareto optimal if all possible Pareto improvements have already been made; in other words, there are no longer any ways left to make one person better-off, without making some other person worse-off.

In social choice theory, the same concept is sometimes called the unanimity principle, which says that if &quot;everyone&quot; in a society (non-strictly) prefers A to B, society as a whole also non-strictly prefers A to B. The Pareto front consists of all Pareto-efficient situations.

In addition to the context of efficiency in &quot;allocation&quot;, the concept of Pareto efficiency also arises in the context of &quot;efficiency in production&quot; vs. &quot;x-inefficiency&quot;: a set of outputs of goods is Pareto-efficient if there is no feasible re-allocation of productive inputs such that output of one product increases while the outputs of all other goods either increase or remain the same.

Besides economics, the notion of Pareto efficiency has also been applied to selecting alternatives in engineering and biology. Each option is first assessed, under multiple criteria, and then a subset of options is identified with the property that no other option can categorically outperform the specified option. It is a statement of impossibility of improving one variable without harming other variables in the subject of multi-objective optimization (also termed Pareto optimization).

== History ==

The concept is named after Vilfredo Pareto (1848–1923), an Italian civil engineer and economist, who used the concept in his studies of economic efficiency and income distribution.

Pareto originally used the word &quot;optimal&quot; for the concept, but this is somewhat of a misnomer: Pareto&#x27;s concept more closely aligns with an idea of &quot;efficiency&quot;, because it does not identify a single &quot;best&quot; (optimal) outcome. Instead, it only identifies a set of outcomes that &quot;might&quot; be considered optimal, by at least one person.

== Overview ==

Formally, a state is Pareto-optimal if there is no alternative state where at least one participant&#x27;s well-being is higher, and nobody else&#x27;s well-being is lower. If there is a state change that satisfies this condition, the new state is called a &quot;Pareto improvement&quot;. When no Pareto improvements are possible, the state is a &quot;Pareto optimum&quot;.

In other words, Pareto efficiency is when it is impossible to make one party better off without making another party worse off. This state indicates that resources can no longer be allocated in a way that makes one party better off without harming other parties. In a state of Pareto Efficiency, resources are allocated in the most efficient way possible.

Pareto efficiency is mathematically represented when there is no other strategy profile &quot;s&quot;&#x27; such that &quot;ui (s&#x27;) ≥ ui (s)&quot; for every player &quot;i&quot; and &quot;uj (s&#x27;) &gt; uj (s)&quot; for some player &quot;j&quot;. In this equation &quot;s&quot; represents the strategy profile, &quot;u&quot; represents the utility or benefit, and &quot;j&quot; represents the player.

Efficiency is an important criterion for judging behavior in a game. In a notable and often analyzed game known as Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma, depicted below as a normal-form game, this concept of efficiency can be observed, in that the strategy profile (Cooperate, Cooperate) is more efficient than (Defect, Defect).
Using the definition above, let &quot;s = (-2, -2)&quot; (Both Defect) and &quot;s&#x27; = (-1, -1)&quot; (Both Cooperate). Then &quot;ui(s&#x27;)&quot; &gt; &quot;ui(s)&quot; for all &quot;i&quot;. Thus Both Cooperate is a Pareto improvement over Both Defect, which means that Both Defect is not Pareto-efficient. Furthermore, neither of the remaining strategy profiles, &quot;(0, -5)&quot; or &quot;(-5, 0)&quot;, is a Pareto improvement over Both Cooperate, since &quot;-5 &lt; -1&quot;. Thus Both Cooperate is Pareto-efficient.

In zero-sum games, every outcome is Pareto-efficient.

A special case of a state is an allocation of resources. The formal presentation of the concept in an economy is the following: Consider an economy with formula_1 agents and formula_2 goods. Then an allocation formula_3, where formula_4 for all &quot;i&quot;, is &quot;Pareto-optimal&quot; if there is no other feasible allocation formula_5 where, for utility function formula_6 for each agent formula_7, formula_8 for all formula_9 with formula_10 for some formula_11. Here, in this simple economy, &quot;feasibility&quot; refers to an allocation where the total amount of each good that is allocated sums to no more than the total amount of the good in the economy. In a more complex economy with production, an allocation would consist both of consumption vectors and production vectors, and feasibility would require that the total amount of each consumed good is no greater than the initial endowment plus the amount produced.

Under the assumptions of the first welfare theorem, a competitive market leads to a Pareto-efficient outcome. This result was first demonstrated mathematically by economists Kenneth Arrow and Gérard Debreu. However, the result only holds under the assumptions of the theorem: markets exist for all possible goods, there are no externalities, markets are perfectly competitive, and market participants have perfect information.

In the absence of perfect information or complete markets, outcomes will generally be Pareto-inefficient, per the Greenwald–Stiglitz theorem.

The second welfare theorem is essentially the reverse of the first welfare theorem. It states that under similar, ideal assumptions, any Pareto optimum can be obtained by some competitive equilibrium, or free market system, although it may also require a lump-sum transfer of wealth.
===Pareto efficiency and market failure===

An ineffective distribution of resources in a free market is known as market failure. Given that there is room for improvement, market failure implies Pareto inefficiency.

For instance, excessive use of negative commodities (such as drugs and cigarettes) results in expenses to non-smokers as well as early mortality for smokers. Cigarette taxes may help individuals stop smoking while also raising money to address ailments brought on by smoking.

===Pareto efficiency and equity===
A Pareto improvement may be seen, but this does not always imply that the result is desirable or equitable. After a Pareto improvement, inequality could still exist. However, it does imply that any change will violate the &quot;do no harm&quot; principle, because at least one person will be worse off.

A society may be Pareto efficient but have significant levels of inequality. The most equitable course of action would be to split the pie into three equal portions if there were three persons and a pie. The third person does not lose out (even if he does not partake in the pie), hence splitting it in half and giving it to two individuals would be considered Pareto efficient.

On a frontier of production possibilities, Pareto efficiency will happen. It is impossible to raise the output of products without decreasing the output of services when an economy is functioning on a basic production potential frontier, such as at point A, B, or C.

== Pareto order ==
If multiple sub-goals formula_12 (with formula_13) exist, combined into a vector-valued objective function formula_14, generally, finding a unique optimum formula_15 becomes challenging. This is due to the absence of a total order relation for formula_16 which would not always prioritize one target over another target (like the lexicographical order). In the multi-objective optimization setting, various solutions can be &quot;incomparable&quot; as there is no total order relation to facilitate the comparison formula_17. Only the Pareto order is applicable:

Consider a vector-valued minimization problem: formula_18 Pareto dominates formula_19 if and only if: :formula_20 and formula_21 We then write formula_22, where formula_23 is the Pareto order. This means that formula_24 is not worse than formula_25 in any goal but is better (since smaller) in at least one goal formula_26. The Pareto order is a strict partial order, though it is not a product order (neither non-strict nor strict).

If formula_27, then this defines a preorder in the search space and we say formula_28 Pareto dominates the alternative formula_29 and we write formula_30.


== Variants ==

=== Weak Pareto efficiency ===
Weak Pareto efficiency is a situation that cannot be strictly improved for &quot;every&quot; individual.

Formally, a strong Pareto improvement is defined as a situation in which all agents are strictly better-off (in contrast to just &quot;Pareto improvement&quot;, which requires that one agent is strictly better-off and the other agents are at least as good). A situation is weak Pareto-efficient if it has no strong Pareto improvements.

Any strong Pareto improvement is also a weak Pareto improvement. The opposite is not true; for example, consider a resource allocation problem with two resources, which Alice values at {10, 0}, and George values at {5, 5}. Consider the allocation giving all resources to Alice, where the utility profile is (10, 0):
* It is a weak PO, since no other allocation is strictly better to both agents (there are no strong Pareto improvements). 
* But it is not a strong PO, since the allocation in which George gets the second resource is strictly better for George and weakly better for Alice (it is a weak Pareto improvement) its utility profile is (10, 5).

A market does not require local nonsatiation to get to a weak Pareto optimum.

=== Constrained Pareto efficiency ===
Constrained Pareto efficiency is a weakening of Pareto optimality, accounting for the fact that a potential planner (e.g., the government) may not be able to improve upon a decentralized market outcome, even if that outcome is inefficient. This will occur if it is limited by the same informational or institutional constraints as are individual agents.

An example is of a setting where individuals have private information (for example, a labor market where the worker&#x27;s own productivity is known to the worker but not to a potential employer, or a used-car market where the quality of a car is known to the seller but not to the buyer) which results in moral hazard or an adverse selection and a sub-optimal outcome. In such a case, a planner who wishes to improve the situation is unlikely to have access to any information that the participants in the markets do not have. Hence, the planner cannot implement allocation rules which are based on the idiosyncratic characteristics of individuals; for example, &quot;if a person is of type &quot;A&quot;, they pay price &quot;p&quot;1, but if of type &quot;B&quot;, they pay price &quot;p&quot;2&quot; (see Lindahl prices). Essentially, only anonymous rules are allowed (of the sort &quot;Everyone pays price &quot;p&quot;&quot;) or rules based on observable behavior; &quot;if any person chooses &quot;x&quot; at price &quot;px&quot;, then they get a subsidy of ten dollars, and nothing otherwise&quot;. If there exists no allowed rule that can successfully improve upon the market outcome, then that outcome is said to be &quot;constrained Pareto-optimal&quot;.

=== Fractional Pareto efficiency ===
Fractional Pareto efficiency is a strengthening of Pareto efficiency in the context of fair item allocation. An allocation of indivisible items is fractionally Pareto-efficient (fPE or fPO) if it is not Pareto-dominated even by an allocation in which some items are split between agents. This is in contrast to standard Pareto efficiency, which only considers domination by feasible (discrete) allocations.

As an example, consider an item allocation problem with two items, which Alice values at {3, 2} and George values at {4, 1}. Consider the allocation giving the first item to Alice and the second to George, where the utility profile is (3, 1):
* It is Pareto-efficient, since any other discrete allocation (without splitting items) makes someone worse-off.
* However, it is not fractionally Pareto-efficient, since it is Pareto-dominated by the allocation giving to Alice 1/2 of the first item and the whole second item, and the other 1/2 of the first item to George its utility profile is (3.5, 2).

=== Ex-ante Pareto efficiency ===
When the decision process is random, such as in fair random assignment or random social choice or fractional approval voting, there is a difference between ex-post and ex-ante Pareto efficiency:
* Ex-post Pareto efficiency means that any outcome of the random process is Pareto-efficient.
* Ex-ante Pareto efficiency means that the &quot;lottery&quot; determined by the process is Pareto-efficient with respect to the &quot;expected&quot; utilities. That is: no other lottery gives a higher expected utility to one agent and at least as high expected utility to all agents.
If some lottery &quot;L&quot; is ex-ante PE, then it is also ex-post PE. &quot;Proof&quot;: suppose that one of the ex-post outcomes &quot;x&quot; of &quot;L&quot; is Pareto-dominated by some other outcome &quot;y&quot;. Then, by moving some probability mass from &quot;x&quot; to &quot;y&quot;, one attains another lottery &quot;L″&quot; that ex-ante Pareto-dominates &quot;L&quot;.

The opposite is not true: ex-ante PE is stronger that ex-post PE. For example, suppose there are two objects a car and a house. Alice values the car at 2 and the house at 3; George values the car at 2 and the house at 9. Consider the following two lotteries:
# With probability 1/2, give car to Alice and house to George; otherwise, give car to George and house to Alice. The expected utility is for Alice and for George. Both allocations are ex-post PE, since the one who got the car cannot be made better-off without harming the one who got the house.
# With probability 1, give car to Alice, then with probability 1/3 give the house to Alice, otherwise give it to George. The expected utility is for Alice and for George. Again, both allocations are ex-post PE.

While both lotteries are ex-post PE, the lottery 1 is not ex-ante PE, since it is Pareto-dominated by lottery 2.

Another example involves dichotomous preferences. There are 5 possible outcomes and 6 voters. The voters&#x27; approval sets are . All five outcomes are PE, so every lottery is ex-post PE. But the lottery selecting &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;e&quot; with probability 1/3 each is not ex-ante PE, since it gives an expected utility of 1/3 to each voter, while the lottery selecting &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; with probability 1/2 each gives an expected utility of 1/2 to each voter.

=== Bayesian Pareto efficiency ===

Bayesian efficiency is an adaptation of Pareto efficiency to settings in which players have incomplete information regarding the types of other players.

=== Ordinal Pareto efficiency ===

Ordinal Pareto efficiency is an adaptation of Pareto efficiency to settings in which players report only rankings on individual items, and we do not know for sure how they rank entire bundles.

== Pareto efficiency and equity ==
Although an outcome may be a Pareto improvement, this does not imply that the outcome is equitable. It is possible that inequality persists even after a Pareto improvement. Despite the fact that it is frequently used in conjunction with the idea of Pareto optimality, the term &quot;efficiency&quot; refers to the process of increasing societal productivity. It is possible for a society to have Pareto efficiency while also have high levels of inequality. Consider the following scenario: there is a pie and three persons; the most equitable way would be to divide the pie into three equal portions. However, if the pie is divided in half and shared between two people, it is considered Pareto efficient meaning that the third person does not lose out (despite the fact that he does not receive a piece of the pie). When making judgments, it is critical to consider a variety of aspects, including social efficiency, overall welfare, and issues such as diminishing marginal value.

== Pareto efficiency and market failure ==
In order to fully understand market failure, one must first comprehend market success, which is defined as the ability of a set of idealized competitive markets to achieve an equilibrium allocation of resources that is Pareto-optimal in terms of resource allocation. According to the definition of market failure, it is a circumstance in which the conclusion of the first fundamental theorem of welfare is erroneous; that is, when the allocations made through markets are not efficient. In a free market, market failure is defined as an inefficient allocation of resources. Due to the fact that it is feasible to improve, market failure implies Pareto inefficiency. For example, excessive consumption of depreciating items (drugs/tobacco) results in external costs to non-smokers, as well as premature death for smokers who do not quit. An increase in the price of cigarettes could motivate people to quit smoking while also raising funds for the treatment of smoking-related ailments.

=== Approximate Pareto efficiency ===
Given some &quot;ε&quot; &gt; 0, an outcome is called &quot;ε&quot;-Pareto-efficient if no other outcome gives all agents at least the same utility, and one agent a utility at least (1 + &quot;ε&quot;) higher. This captures the notion that improvements smaller than (1 + &quot;ε&quot;) are negligible and should not be considered a breach of efficiency.

== Pareto-efficiency and welfare-maximization ==

Suppose each agent &quot;i&quot; is assigned a positive weight &quot;ai&quot;. For every allocation &quot;x&quot;, define the &quot;welfare&quot; of &quot;x&quot; as the weighted sum of utilities of all agents in &quot;x&quot;:

: formula_31

Let &quot;xa&quot; be an allocation that maximizes the welfare over all allocations:

: formula_32

It is easy to show that the allocation &quot;xa&quot; is Pareto-efficient: since all weights are positive, any Pareto improvement would increase the sum, contradicting the definition of &quot;xa&quot;.

Japanese neo-Walrasian economist Takashi Negishi proved that, under certain assumptions, the opposite is also true: for &quot;every&quot; Pareto-efficient allocation &quot;x&quot;, there exists a positive vector &quot;a&quot; such that &quot;x&quot; maximizes &quot;Wa&quot;. A shorter proof is provided by Hal Varian.

== Use in engineering==
The notion of Pareto efficiency has been used in engineering. Given a set of choices and a way of valuing them, the Pareto front (or Pareto set or Pareto frontier) is the set of choices that are Pareto-efficient. By restricting attention to the set of choices that are Pareto-efficient, a designer can make trade-offs within this set, rather than considering the full range of every parameter.

== Use in public policy ==
Modern microeconomic theory has drawn heavily upon the concept of Pareto efficiency for inspiration. Pareto and his successors have tended to describe this technical definition of optimal resource allocation in the context of it being an equilibrium that can theoretically be achieved within an abstract model of market competition. It has therefore very often been treated as a corroboration of Adam Smith&#x27;s &quot;invisible hand&quot; notion. More specifically, it motivated the debate over &quot;market socialism&quot; in the 1930s.

However, because the Pareto-efficient outcome is difficult to assess in the real world when issues including asymmetric information, signalling, adverse selection, and moral hazard are introduced, most people do not take the theorems of welfare economics as accurate descriptions of the real world. Therefore, the significance of the two welfare theorems of economics is in their ability to generate a framework that has dominated neoclassical thinking about public policy. That framework is that the welfare economics theorems allow the political economy to be studied in the following two situations: &quot;market failure&quot; and &quot;the problem of redistribution&quot;.

Analysis of &quot;market failure&quot; can be understood by the literature surrounding externalities. When comparing the &quot;real&quot; economy to the complete contingent markets economy (which is considered efficient), the inefficiencies become clear. These inefficiencies, or externalities, are then able to be addressed by mechanisms, including property rights and corrective taxes.

Analysis of &quot;the problem with redistribution&quot; deals with the observed political question of how income or commodity taxes should be utilized. The theorem tells us that no taxation is Pareto-efficient and that taxation with redistribution is Pareto-inefficient. Because of this, most of the literature is focused on finding solutions where given there is a tax structure, how can the tax structure prescribe a situation where no person could be made better off by a change in available taxes.

== Use in biology ==
Pareto optimisation has also been studied in biological processes. In bacteria, genes were shown to be either inexpensive to make (resource-efficient) or easier to read (translation-efficient). Natural selection acts to push highly expressed genes towards the Pareto frontier for resource use and translational efficiency. Genes near the Pareto frontier were also shown to evolve more slowly (indicating that they are providing a selective advantage).

== Common misconceptions ==
It would be incorrect to treat Pareto efficiency as equivalent to societal optimization, as the latter is a normative concept, which is a matter of interpretation that typically would account for the consequence of degrees of inequality of distribution. An example would be the interpretation of one school district with low property tax revenue versus another with much higher revenue as a sign that more equal distribution occurs with the help of government redistribution.

==Criticism==
Some commentators contest that Pareto efficiency could potentially serve as an ideological tool. With it implying that capitalism is self-regulated thereof, it is likely that the embedded structural problems such as unemployment would be treated as deviating from the equilibrium or norm, and thus neglected or discounted.

Pareto efficiency does not require a totally equitable distribution of wealth, which is another aspect that draws in criticism. An economy in which a wealthy few hold the vast majority of resources can be Pareto-efficient. A simple example is the distribution of a pie among three people. The most equitable distribution would assign one third to each person. However, the assignment of, say, a half section to each of two individuals and none to the third is also Pareto-optimal despite not being equitable, because none of the recipients could be made better off without decreasing someone else&#x27;s share; and there are many other such distribution examples. An example of a Pareto-inefficient distribution of the pie would be allocation of a quarter of the pie to each of the three, with the remainder discarded.

The liberal paradox elaborated by Amartya Sen shows that when people have preferences about what other people do, the goal of Pareto efficiency can come into conflict with the goal of individual liberty.

Lastly, it is proposed that Pareto efficiency to some extent inhibited discussion of other possible criteria of efficiency. As Wharton School professor Ben Lockwood argues, one possible reason is that any other efficiency criteria established in the neoclassical domain will reduce to Pareto efficiency at the end.

<doc id="45470" wikidata="Q11299" url="?curid=45470" title="Manhattan">
<text>Manhattan ( ) is the most densely populated and geographically smallest of the five boroughs of New York City. Coextensive with New York County, Manhattan is the smallest county by area in the U.S. state of New York. Located almost entirely on Manhattan Island near the southern tip of the state, Manhattan constitutes the center of the Northeast megalopolis and the urban core of the New York metropolitan area. Manhattan serves as New York City&#x27;s economic and administrative center and has been described as the cultural, financial, media, and entertainment capital of the world.

Present-day Manhattan was originally part of Lenape territory. European settlement began with the establishment of a trading post by Dutch colonists in 1624 on Manhattan Island; the post was named New Amsterdam in 1626. The territory came under English control in 1664 and were renamed New York after King Charles II of England granted the lands to his brother, the Duke of York. New York, based in present-day Lower Manhattan, served as the capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790. The Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor greeted millions of arriving immigrants in the late 19th century and is a world symbol of the United States and its ideals. Manhattan became a borough during the consolidation of New York City in 1898, and houses New York City Hall, the seat of the city&#x27;s government. Harlem in Upper Manhattan became the center of what is now known as the cultural Harlem Renaissance in the 1920s. The Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village, part of the Stonewall National Monument, is considered the birthplace in 1969 of the modern gay-rights movement, cementing Manhattan&#x27;s central role in LGBT culture. Manhattan was the site of the original World Trade Center, which was destroyed during the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001.

Situated on one of the world&#x27;s largest natural harbors, the borough is bounded by the Hudson, East, and Harlem rivers and includes several small adjacent islands, including Roosevelt, U Thant, and Randalls and Wards Islands. It also includes the small neighborhood of Marble Hill now on the U.S. mainland. Manhattan Island is divided into three informally bounded components, each cutting across the borough&#x27;s long axis: Lower Manhattan, Midtown, and Upper Manhattan. Manhattan is one of the most densely populated locations in the world, with a 2020 census population of 1,694,250 living in a land area of , or , and coextensive with New York County, its residential property has the highest sale price per square foot in the United States.

Manhattan is home to Wall Street as well as the world&#x27;s two largest stock exchanges by total market capitalization, the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. Many multinational media conglomerates are based in Manhattan, as are numerous colleges and universities, such as Columbia University, New York University, Rockefeller University, and the City University of New York. The headquarters of the United Nations is located in the Turtle Bay neighborhood of Midtown Manhattan. Manhattan hosts three of the world&#x27;s top 10 most-visited tourist attractions: Times Square, Central Park, and Grand Central Terminal. New York Penn Station is the busiest transportation hub in the Western Hemisphere. Chinatown has the highest concentration of Chinese people in the Western Hemisphere. Fifth Avenue has been ranked as the most expensive shopping street in the world, before falling to second in 2024. The borough hosts many prominent bridges, tunnels, and skyscrapers including the Empire State Building, Chrysler Building, and One World Trade Center. It is also home to the National Basketball Association&#x27;s New York Knicks and the National Hockey League&#x27;s New York Rangers.

==History==

=== Lenape settlement ===

Manhattan was historically part of the Lenapehoking territory inhabited by the Munsee, Lenape, and Wappinger tribes. There were several Lenape settlements in the area including Sapohanikan, Nechtanc, and Konaande Kongh, which were interconnected by a series of trails. The primary trail on the island, which would later become Broadway, ran from what is now Inwood in the north to Battery Park in the south. There were various sites for fishing and planting established by the Lenape throughout Manhattan. The name &quot;Manhattan&quot; most likely originated, via loaning by Dutch, from the Lenape&#x27;s local language Munsee, &quot;manaháhtaan&quot; (where &quot;manah-&quot; means &quot;gather&quot;, &quot;-aht-&quot; means &quot;bow&quot;, and &quot;-aan&quot; is used to form verb stems). The Lenape word has been translated as &quot;the place where we get bows&quot; or &quot;place for gathering the (wood to make) bows&quot;. According to a Munsee tradition recorded by Albert Seqaqkind Anthony in the 19th century, the island was named for a grove of hickory trees that was considered ideal for bowmaking. An alternate theory claims a &quot;Delaware source akin to Munsee &quot;munahan&quot; (&quot;island&quot;).&quot;

===Colonial era===
In April 1524, Florentine explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano, sailing in service of Francis I of France, became the first documented European to visit the area that would become New York City. Verrazzano entered the tidal strait now known as The Narrows and named the land around Upper New York Harbor &quot;New Angoulême&quot;, in reference to the family name of King Francis I; he sailed far enough into the harbor to sight the Hudson River, and he named the &quot;Bay of Santa Margarita&quot; – what is now Upper New York Bay – after Marguerite de Navarre, the elder sister of the king.

Manhattan was first mapped during a 1609 voyage of Henry Hudson. Hudson came across Manhattan Island and the native people living there, and continued up the river that would later bear his name, the Hudson River. Manhattan was first recorded in writing as &quot;Manna-hata&quot;, in the logbook of Robert Juet, an officer on the voyage.

A permanent European presence in New Netherland began in 1624, with the founding of a Dutch fur trading settlement on Governors Island. In 1625, construction was started on the citadel of Fort Amsterdam on Manhattan Island, later called New Amsterdam (&quot;Nieuw Amsterdam&quot;), in what is now Lower Manhattan. The establishment of Fort Amsterdam is recognized as the birth of New York City.
In 1647, Peter Stuyvesant was appointed as the last Dutch Director-General of the colony. New Amsterdam was formally incorporated as a city on February 2, 1653. In 1664, English forces conquered New Netherland and renamed it &quot;New York&quot; after the English Duke of York and Albany, the future King James II. In August 1673, the Dutch reconquered the colony, renaming it &quot;New Orange&quot;, but permanently relinquished it back to England the following year under the terms of the Treaty of Westminster that ended the Third Anglo-Dutch War.

===American Revolution===

Manhattan was at the heart of the New York Campaign, a series of major battles in the early stages of the American Revolutionary War. The Continental Army was forced to abandon Manhattan after the Battle of Fort Washington on November 16, 1776. The city, greatly damaged by the Great Fire of New York during the campaign, became the British military and political center of operations in North America for the remainder of the war. British occupation lasted until November 25, 1783, when George Washington returned to Manhattan, a day celebrated as Evacuation Day, marking when the last British forces left the city.

From January 11, 1785, until 1789, New York City was the fifth of five capitals of the United States under the Articles of Confederation, with the Continental Congress meeting at New York City Hall (then at Fraunces Tavern). New York was the first capital under the newly enacted Constitution of the United States, from March 4, 1789, to August 12, 1790, at Federal Hall. Federal Hall was where the United States Supreme Court met for the first time, the United States Bill of Rights were drafted and ratified, and where the Northwest Ordinance was adopted, establishing measures for admission to the Union of new states.

===19th century===
New York grew as an economic center, first as a result of Alexander Hamilton&#x27;s policies and practices as the first Secretary of the Treasury to expand the city&#x27;s role as a center of commerce and industry. By 1810, New York City, then confined to Manhattan, had surpassed Philadelphia as the most populous city in the United States. The Commissioners&#x27; Plan of 1811 laid out the island of Manhattan in its familiar grid plan. The city&#x27;s role as an economic center grew with the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825, cutting transportation costs by 90% compared to road transport and connecting the Atlantic port to the vast agricultural markets of the Midwestern United States and Canada.

Tammany Hall, a Democratic Party political machine, began to grow in influence with the support of many of the immigrant Irish, culminating in the election of the first Tammany mayor, Fernando Wood, in 1854. Covering in the center of the island, Central Park, which opened its first portions to the public in 1858, became the first landscaped public park in an American city.
New York City played a complex role in the American Civil War. The city had strong commercial ties to the South, but anger around conscription, resentment against Lincoln&#x27;s war policies and paranoia about free Blacks taking the jobs of poor immigrants culminated in the three-day-long New York Draft Riots of July 1863, among the worst incidents of civil disorder in American history. The rate of immigration from Europe grew steeply after the Civil War, and Manhattan became the first stop for millions seeking a new life in the United States, a role acknowledged by the dedication of the Statue of Liberty in 1886. This immigration brought further social upheaval. In a city of tenements packed with poorly paid laborers from dozens of nations, the city became a hotbed of revolution (including anarchists and communists among others), syndicalism, racketeering, and unionization.

In 1883, the opening of the Brooklyn Bridge across the East River established a road connection to Brooklyn and the rest of Long Island. In 1898, New York City consolidated with three neighboring counties to form &quot;the City of Greater New York&quot;, and Manhattan was established as one of the five boroughs of New York City. The Bronx remained part of New York County until 1914, when Bronx County was established.

===20th century===

The construction of the New York City Subway, which opened in 1904, helped bind the new city together, as did the completion of the Williamsburg Bridge (1903) and Manhattan Bridge (1909) connecting to Brooklyn and the Queensboro Bridge (1909) connecting to Queens. In the 1920s, Manhattan experienced large arrivals of African-Americans as part of the Great Migration from the southern United States, and the Harlem Renaissance, part of a larger boom time in the Prohibition era that included new skyscrapers competing for the skyline, with the Woolworth Building (1913), 40 Wall Street (1930), the Chrysler Building (1930), and the Empire State Building (1931) leapfrogging each other to take their place as the world&#x27;s tallest building. Manhattan&#x27;s majority white ethnic group declined from 98.7% in 1900 to 58.3% by 1990. On March 25, 1911, the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in Greenwich Village killed 146 garment workers, leading to overhauls of the city&#x27;s fire department, building codes, and workplace safety regulations. In 1912, about 20,000 workers, a quarter of them women, marched upon Washington Square Park to commemorate the fire. Many of the women wore fitted tucked-front blouses like those manufactured by the company, a clothing style that became the working woman&#x27;s uniform and a symbol of women&#x27;s liberation, reflecting the alliance of the labor and suffrage movements.

Despite the Great Depression, some of the world&#x27;s tallest skyscrapers were completed in Manhattan during the 1930s, including numerous Art Deco masterpieces that are still part of the city&#x27;s skyline, most notably the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, and 30 Rockefeller Plaza. A postwar economic boom led to the development of huge housing developments targeted at returning veterans, the largest being Stuyvesant Town–Peter Cooper Village, which opened in 1947. The United Nations relocated to a new headquarters that was completed in 1952 along the East River.

The Stonewall riots were a series of spontaneous, violent protests by members of the gay community against a police raid that took place in the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, at the Stonewall Inn in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Lower Manhattan. They are widely considered to constitute the single most important event leading to the gay liberation movement and the modern fight for LGBT rights.

In the 1970s, job losses due to industrial restructuring caused New York City, including Manhattan, to suffer from economic problems and rising crime rates. While a resurgence in the financial industry greatly improved the city&#x27;s economic health in the 1980s, New York&#x27;s crime rate continued to increase through the decade and into the beginning of the 1990s. The 1980s saw a rebirth of Wall Street, and Manhattan reclaimed its role as the world&#x27;s financial center, with Wall Street employment doubling from 1977 to 1987. The 1980s also saw Manhattan at the heart of the AIDS crisis, with Greenwich Village at its epicenter.

In the 1970s, Times Square and 42nd Street – with its sex shops, peep shows, and adult theaters, along with its sex trade, street crime, and public drug use – became emblematic of the city&#x27;s decline, with a 1981 article in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine calling the stretch of West 42nd Street between 7th and 8th Avenues the &quot;sleaziest block in America&quot;. By the late 1990s, led by efforts by the city and the Walt Disney Company, the area had been revived as a center of tourism to the point where it was described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;arguably the most sought-after 13 acres of commercial property in the world.&quot;

By the 1990s, crime rates began to drop dramatically and the city once again became the destination of immigrants from around the world, joining with low interest rates and Wall Street bonus payments to fuel the growth of the real estate market. Important new sectors, such as Silicon Alley, emerged in the Flatiron District, cementing technology as a key component of Manhattan&#x27;s economy.

The 1993 World Trade Center bombing, described by the FBI as &quot;something of a deadly dress rehearsal for 9/11&quot;, was a terrorist attack in which six people were killed when a van bomb filled with explosives was detonated in a parking lot below the North Tower of the World Trade Center complex.

===21st century===
On September 11, 2001, the Twin Towers of the original World Trade Center were struck by hijacked aircraft and collapsed in the September 11 attacks launched by al-Qaeda terrorists. The collapse caused extensive damage to surrounding buildings and skyscrapers in Lower Manhattan, and resulted in the deaths of 2,606 of the 17,400 who had been in the buildings when the planes hit, in addition to those on the planes. Since 2001, most of Lower Manhattan has been restored, although there has been controversy surrounding the rebuilding. In 2014, the new One World Trade Center, at measured to the top of its spire, became the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere and is the world&#x27;s seventh-tallest building (as of 2023).

The Occupy Wall Street protests in Zuccotti Park in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan began on September 17, 2011, receiving global attention and spawning the Occupy movement against social and economic inequality worldwide.

On October 29 and 30, 2012, Hurricane Sandy caused extensive destruction in the borough, ravaging portions of Lower Manhattan with record-high storm surge from New York Harbor, severe flooding, and high winds, causing power outages for hundreds of thousands of city residents and leading to gasoline shortages and disruption of mass transit systems. The storm and its profound impacts have prompted discussion of constructing seawalls and other coastal barriers around the shorelines of the borough and the metropolitan area to minimize the risk of destructive consequences from another such event in the future.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, New York County has a total area of , of which is land and (32%) is water. The northern segment of Upper Manhattan represents a geographic panhandle. Manhattan Island is in area, long and wide, at its widest point, near 14th Street.

The borough consists primarily of Manhattan Island, along with the Marble Hill neighborhood and several small islands, including Randalls Island and Wards Island and Roosevelt Island in the East River; and Governors Island and Liberty Island to the south in New York Harbor.

===Manhattan Island===
The Island is about from north to south, and at its widest, . Manhattan Island is loosely divided into Downtown (Lower Manhattan), Midtown (Midtown Manhattan), and Uptown (Upper Manhattan), with Fifth Avenue dividing Manhattan lengthwise into its East Side and West Side. Manhattan Island is bounded by the Hudson River to the west and the East River to the east. To the north, the Harlem River divides Manhattan Island from the Bronx and the mainland United States.
Early in the 19th century, land reclamation was used to expand Lower Manhattan from the natural Hudson shoreline at Greenwich Street to West Street. When building the World Trade Center in 1968, of material excavated from the site was used to expand the Manhattan shoreline across West Street, creating Battery Park City. Constructed on piers at a cost of $260 million, Little Island opened on the Hudson River in May 2021, connected to the western termini of 13th and 14th Streets by footbridges.

===Marble Hill===

Marble Hill was part of the northern tip of Manhattan Island, but the Harlem River Ship Canal, dug in 1895 to better connect the Harlem and Hudson rivers, separated it from the remainder of Manhattan. Before World War I, the section of the original Harlem River channel separating Marble Hill from the Bronx was filled in, and Marble Hill became part of the mainland. After a May 1984 court ruling that Marble Hill was simultaneously part of the Borough of Manhattan (not the Borough of the Bronx) and part of Bronx County (not New York County), the matter was definitively settled later that year when the New York Legislature overwhelmingly passed legislation declaring the neighborhood part of both New York County and the Borough of Manhattan.

===Smaller islands===
Within New York Harbor, there are three smaller islands:
* Ellis Island, shared with New Jersey
* Governors Island
* Liberty Island (administered by the National Park Service)

Other smaller islands, in the East River, include (from north to south):
* Randalls and Wards Islands, joined by landfill
* Mill Rock
* Roosevelt Island, which has a population of 14,000, extends for , and was renamed in 1973 from Welfare Island to honor President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
* U Thant Island (legally Belmont Island)

===Geology===

The bedrock underlying much of Manhattan consists of three rock formations: &quot;Inwood marble&quot;, &quot;Fordham gneiss&quot;, and &quot;Manhattan schist&quot;, and is well suited for the foundations of Manhattan&#x27;s skyscrapers. It is part of the Manhattan Prong physiographic region.

===Adjacent counties===
===Climate===

Under the Köppen climate classification, New York City features both a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;) and a humid continental climate (&quot;Dfa&quot;); it is the northernmost major city on the North American continent with a humid subtropical climate. The city averages 234 days with at least some sunshine annually.

Winters are cold and damp, and prevailing wind patterns that blow offshore temper the moderating effects of the Atlantic Ocean, yet the Atlantic and the partial shielding from colder air by the Appalachians keep the city warmer in the winter than inland North American cities at similar or lesser latitudes. The daily mean temperature in January, the area&#x27;s coldest month, is ; temperatures usually drop to several times per winter, and reach several days in the coldest winter month. Spring and autumn are unpredictable and can range from chilly to warm, although they are usually mild with low humidity. Summers are typically warm to hot and humid, with a daily mean temperature of in July. Nighttime conditions are often exacerbated by the urban heat island phenomenon, which causes heat absorbed during the day to be radiated back at night, raising temperatures by as much as when winds are slow. Daytime temperatures exceed on average of 17 days each summer and in some years exceed . Extreme temperatures have ranged from , recorded on February 9, 1934, up to on July 9, 1936. Manhattan lies in USDA plant hardiness zone 7b (5 to 10 °F/-15 to -12.2 °C).

Manhattan receives of precipitation annually, which is relatively evenly spread throughout the year. Average winter snowfall between 1981 and 2010 has been ; this varies considerably from year to year.

===Neighborhoods===

Manhattan&#x27;s many neighborhoods are not named according to any particular convention, nor do they have official boundaries. Some are geographical (the Upper East Side), or ethnically descriptive (Little Italy). Others are acronyms, such as TriBeCa (for &quot;TRIangle BElow CAnal Street&quot;) or SoHo (&quot;SOuth of HOuston&quot;), NoLIta (&quot;NOrth of Little ITAly&quot;), and NoMad (&quot;NOrth of MADison Square Park&quot;). Harlem is a name from the Dutch colonial era after Haarlem, a city in the Netherlands. Some have simple folkloric names, such as Hell&#x27;s Kitchen, alongside their more official but lesser used title (in this case, Clinton).

Some neighborhoods, such as SoHo, which is mixed use, are known for upscale shopping as well as residential use. Others, such as Greenwich Village, the Lower East Side, Alphabet City and the East Village, have long been associated with the Bohemian subculture. Chelsea is one of several Manhattan neighborhoods with large gay populations and has become a center of both the international art industry and New York&#x27;s nightlife. Chinatown has the highest concentration of people of Chinese descent outside of Asia. Koreatown is roughly centered on 32nd Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues. Rose Hill features a growing number of Indian restaurants and spice shops along a stretch of Lexington Avenue between 25th and 30th Streets which has become known as &quot;Curry Hill&quot;. Washington Heights in Uptown Manhattan is home to the largest Dominican immigrant community in the United States. Harlem, also in Upper Manhattan, is the historical epicenter of African American culture. Since 2010, a &quot;Little Australia&quot; has emerged and is growing in Nolita, Lower Manhattan.

Manhattan has two central business districts, the Financial District at the southern tip of the island, and Midtown Manhattan. The term &quot;uptown&quot; also refers to the northern part of Manhattan above 72nd Street and &quot;downtown&quot; to the southern portion below 14th Street, with &quot;Midtown&quot; covering the area in between, though definitions can be fluid. Fifth Avenue roughly bisects Manhattan Island and acts as the demarcation line for east/west designations. South of Waverly Place, Fifth Avenue terminates and Broadway becomes the east/west demarcation line. In Manhattan, &quot;uptown&quot; means north and &quot;downtown&quot; means south. This usage differs from that of most American cities, where &quot;downtown&quot; refers to the central business district.

==Landmarks and architecture==
Points of interest on Manhattan Island include the American Museum of Natural History; the Battery; Broadway and the Theater District; Bryant Park; Central Park, Chinatown; the Chrysler Building; The Cloisters; Columbia University; Curry Hill; the Empire State Building; Flatiron Building; the Financial District (including the New York Stock Exchange Building; Wall Street; and the South Street Seaport); Grand Central Terminal; Greenwich Village (including New York University; Washington Square Arch; and Stonewall Inn); Harlem and Spanish Harlem; the High Line; Koreatown; Lincoln Center; Little Australia; Little Italy; Madison Square Garden; Museum Mile on Fifth Avenue (including the Metropolitan Museum of Art); New York Penn Station, Port Authority Bus Terminal; Rockefeller Center (including Radio City Music Hall); Times Square; and the World Trade Center (including the National September 11 Museum and One World Trade Center).

There are also numerous iconic bridges across rivers that connect to Manhattan Island, as well as an emerging number of supertall skyscrapers. The Statue of Liberty rests on Liberty Island, an exclave of Manhattan, and part of Ellis Island is also an exclave of Manhattan. The borough has many energy-efficient office buildings, such as the Hearst Tower, the rebuilt 7 World Trade Center, and the Bank of America Tower—the first skyscraper designed to attain a Platinum LEED Certification.

The skyscraper, which has shaped Manhattan&#x27;s distinctive skyline, has been closely associated with New York City&#x27;s identity since the end of the 19th century. Structures such as the Equitable Building of 1915, which rises vertically forty stories from the sidewalk, prompted the passage of the 1916 Zoning Resolution, requiring new buildings to contain setbacks withdrawing progressively at a defined angle from the street as they rose, in order to preserve a view of the sky at street level. Manhattan&#x27;s skyline includes several buildings that are symbolic of New York, in particular the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building, which sees about 4 million visitors a year.

In 1961, the struggling Pennsylvania Railroad unveiled plans to tear down the old Penn Station and replace it with a new Madison Square Garden and office building complex. Organized protests were aimed at preserving the McKim, Mead &amp; White-designed structure completed in 1910, widely considered a masterpiece of the Beaux-Arts style and one of the architectural jewels of New York City. Despite these efforts, demolition of the structure began in October 1963. The loss of Penn Station led directly to the enactment in 1965 of a local law establishing the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, which is responsible for preserving the &quot;city&#x27;s historic, aesthetic, and cultural heritage&quot;. The historic preservation movement triggered by Penn Station&#x27;s demise has been credited with the retention of some one million structures nationwide, including over 1,000 in New York City. In 2017, a multibillion-dollar rebuilding plan was unveiled to restore the historic grandeur of Penn Station, in the process of upgrading the landmark&#x27;s status as a critical transportation hub.

The Moynihan Train Hall, developed as a $1.6 billion renovation and expansion of Penn Station into the James A. Farley Building, the city&#x27;s former main post office building, was opened in January 2021.

While much of the park looks natural, it is almost entirely landscaped; the construction of Central Park in the 1850s was one of the era&#x27;s most massive public works projects, with some 20,000 workers moving of material to shape the topography and create the English-style pastoral landscape that Olmsted and Vaux sought.

The remaining 70% of Manhattan&#x27;s parkland includes 204 playgrounds, 251 Greenstreets, 371 basketball courts, and many other amenities. The next-largest park in Manhattan, the Hudson River Park, stretches along the Hudson River and comprises . Other major parks include:

==Economy==
Manhattan is the economic engine of New York City, with its 2.45 million workers drawn from the entire New York metropolitan area accounting for almost more than half of all jobs in New York City. Manhattan&#x27;s workforce is overwhelmingly focused on white collar professions. In 2010, Manhattan&#x27;s daytime population was swelling to 3.94 million, with commuters adding a net 1.48 million people to the population, along with visitors, tourists, and commuting students. The commuter influx of 1.61 million workers coming into Manhattan was the largest of any county or city in the country.

Manhattan had the highest per capita income, at $186,848 in 2022, among United States counties with more than 50,000 residents. Based on census data for New York County for 2018–2022, the median household income was $99,880 and the poverty rate was 17.2%. In the second quarter of 2023, Manhattan had an average weekly wage of $2,590, ranked fourth-highest among the nation&#x27;s 360 largest counties. Data for 2022 from the Census Bureau showed growing inequality, with those in the top 20% having an average household income of $545,549, more than 50 times higher than the $10,529 average income in the lowest 20% of households, the largest gap of any county in the country and &quot;larger ... than in many developing countries&quot;, with inequality growing steadily since 2010. , Manhattan&#x27;s cost of living was the highest in the United States.

===Financial sector===

Manhattan&#x27;s most important economic sector lies in its role as the headquarters for the U.S. financial industry, metonymously known as Wall Street. Manhattan is home to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), at 11 Wall Street in Lower Manhattan, and the Nasdaq, now located at 4 Times Square in Midtown Manhattan, representing the world&#x27;s largest and second-largest stock exchanges, respectively, when measured both by overall share trading value and by total market capitalization of their listed companies in 2023. The NYSE American (formerly the American Stock Exchange, AMEX), New York Board of Trade, and the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) are also located downtown.

===Corporate sector===
New York City is home to the most corporate headquarters of any city in the United States, the overwhelming majority based in Manhattan. Manhattan had more than of office space in 2022, making it the largest office market in the United States; while Midtown Manhattan, with more than is the largest central business district in the world. Lower Manhattan is the third-largest U.S. central business district (following the Chicago Loop). New York City&#x27;s role as the top global center for the advertising industry is metonymously known as &quot;Madison Avenue&quot;.

===Tech and biotech===

Manhattan has driven New York&#x27;s status as a top-tier global high technology hub. Silicon Alley, once a metonym for the sphere encompassing the metropolitan region&#x27;s high tech industries, is no longer a relevant moniker as the city&#x27;s tech environment has expanded dramatically both in location and in its scope. New York City&#x27;s current tech sphere encompasses a universal array of applications involving artificial intelligence, the internet, new media, financial technology (&quot;fintech&quot;) and cryptocurrency, biotechnology, game design, and other fields within information technology that are supported by its entrepreneurship ecosystem and venture capital investments. , New York City hosted 300,000 employees in the tech sector. In 2015, Silicon Alley generated over US$7.3 billion in venture capital investment, most based in Manhattan, as well as in Brooklyn, Queens, and elsewhere in the region. High technology startup companies and employment are growing in Manhattan and across New York City, bolstered by the city&#x27;s emergence as a global node of creativity and entrepreneurship, social tolerance, and environmental sustainability, as well as New York&#x27;s position as the leading Internet hub and telecommunications center in North America, including its vicinity to several transatlantic fiber optic trunk lines, the city&#x27;s intellectual capital, and its extensive outdoor wireless connectivity. Verizon Communications, headquartered at 140 West Street in Lower Manhattan, was at the final stages in 2014 of completing a US$3 billion fiberoptic telecommunications upgrade throughout New York City.

The biotechnology sector is also growing in Manhattan based upon the city&#x27;s strength in academic scientific research and public and commercial financial support. By mid-2014, Accelerator, a biotech investment firm, had raised more than US$30 million from investors, including Eli Lilly and Company, Pfizer, and Johnson &amp; Johnson, for initial funding to create biotechnology startups at the Alexandria Center for Life Science, which encompasses more than on East 29th Street and promotes collaboration among scientists and entrepreneurs at the center and with nearby academic, medical, and research institutions. The New York City Economic Development Corporation&#x27;s Early Stage Life Sciences Funding Initiative and venture capital partners, including Celgene, General Electric Ventures, and Eli Lilly, committed a minimum of US$100 million to help launch 15 to 20 ventures in life sciences and biotechnology. In 2011, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg had announced his choice of Cornell University and Technion-Israel Institute of Technology to build a US$2 billion graduate school of applied sciences on Roosevelt Island, Manhattan, with the goal of transforming New York City into the world&#x27;s premier technology capital.

===Tourism===
Tourism is vital to Manhattan&#x27;s economy, and the landmarks of Manhattan are the focus of New York City&#x27;s tourists, with a record 66.6 million visiting the city in 2019, bringing in $47.4 billion in tourism revenue. Visitor numbers dropped by two-thirds in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, climbing back to 63.3 million visitors in 2023.

According to The Broadway League, shows on Broadway sold approximately US$1.54 billion worth of tickets in the 2022–2023 and the 2023–2024 seasons with attendance of approximately 12.3 million each.

===Real estate===
Real estate is a major force driving Manhattan&#x27;s economy. Manhattan has perennially been home to some of the world&#x27;s most valuable real estate, including the Time Warner Center, which had the highest-listed market value in the city in 2006 at US$1.1 billion, to be subsequently surpassed in October 2014 by the Waldorf Astoria New York, which became the most expensive hotel ever sold after being purchased by the Anbang Insurance Group, based in China, for . When 450 Park Avenue was sold on July 2, 2007, for US$510 million, about US$1,589 per square foot (US$17,104/m²), it broke the barely month-old record for an American office building of US$1,476 per square foot (US$15,887/m²) based on the sale of 660 Madison Avenue. In 2014, Manhattan was home to six of the top ten zip codes in the United States by median housing price. In 2019, the most expensive home sale ever in the United States occurred in Manhattan, at a selling price of US$238 million, for a penthouse apartment overlooking Central Park, while Central Park Tower, topped out at in 2019, is the world&#x27;s tallest residential building, followed globally in height by 111 West 57th Street and 432 Park Avenue, both also located in Midtown Manhattan.

The television industry developed in Manhattan and is a significant employer in the borough&#x27;s economy. The four major American broadcast networks, ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox, as well as Univision, are all headquartered in Manhattan, as are many cable channels, including CNN, MSNBC, MTV, Fox News, HBO, and Comedy Central. In 1971, WLIB became New York City&#x27;s first Black-owned radio station and began broadcasts geared toward the African-American community in 1949. WQHT, also known as &quot;Hot 97&quot;, claims to be the premier hip-hop station in the United States.

==Culture==

Manhattan is the borough most closely associated with New York City by non-residents; residents within the New York City metropolitan area, including New York City&#x27;s boroughs outside Manhattan, will often describe a trip to Manhattan as &quot;going to the City&quot;. Poet Walt Whitman characterized the streets of Manhattan as being traversed by &quot;hurrying, feverish, electric crowds&quot;.

Manhattan has been the scene of many important global and American cultural movements. The Harlem Renaissance in the 1920s established the African-American literary canon in the United States and introduced writers Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston. Manhattan&#x27;s visual art scene in the 1950s and 1960s was a center of the pop art movement, which gave birth to such giants as Jasper Johns and Roy Lichtenstein. The downtown pop art movement of the late 1970s included artist Andy Warhol and clubs like Serendipity 3 and Studio 54, where he socialized.

Broadway theater is considered the highest professional form of theater in the United States. Plays and musicals are staged in one of the 39 larger professional theaters with at least 500 seats, almost all in and around Times Square. Off-Broadway theaters feature productions in venues with 100–500 seats. Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, anchoring Lincoln Square on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, is home to 12 influential arts organizations, including the Metropolitan Opera, New York Philharmonic, and New York City Ballet, as well as the Vivian Beaumont Theater, the Juilliard School, Jazz at Lincoln Center, and Alice Tully Hall. Performance artists displaying diverse skills are ubiquitous on the streets of Manhattan.

Manhattan is also home to some of the most extensive art collections in the world, both contemporary and classical art, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), the Frick Collection, the Whitney Museum of American Art, and the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed Guggenheim Museum. The Upper East Side has many art galleries, and the downtown neighborhood of Chelsea is known for its more than 200 art galleries that are home to modern art from both upcoming and established artists. Many of the world&#x27;s most lucrative art auctions are held in Manhattan.

Manhattan is the epicenter of LGBT culture and the central node of the LGBTQ+ sociopolitical ecosystem. The borough is widely acclaimed as the cradle of the modern LGBTQ rights movement, with its inception at the 1969 Stonewall Riots. Brian Silverman, the author of &quot;Frommer&#x27;s New York City from $90 a Day,&quot; wrote the city has &quot;one of the world&#x27;s largest, loudest, and most powerful LGBT communities&quot;, and &quot;Gay and lesbian culture is as much a part of New York&#x27;s basic identity as yellow cabs, high-rise buildings, and Broadway theatre&quot;— radiating from this central hub, as LGBT travel guide &quot;Queer in the World&quot; states, &quot;The fabulosity of Gay New York is unrivaled on Earth, and queer culture seeps into every corner of its five boroughs&quot;. Multiple gay villages have developed, spanning the length of the borough from the Lower East Side, East Village, and Greenwich Village, through Chelsea and Hell&#x27;s Kitchen, uptown to Morningside Heights.

The annual NYC Pride March (or gay pride parade) traverses southward down Fifth Avenue and ends at Greenwich Village; the Manhattan parade is the largest pride parade in the world, attracting tens of thousands of participants and millions of sidewalk spectators each June. Stonewall 50 – WorldPride NYC 2019 was the largest international Pride celebration in history, produced by Heritage of Pride. The events were in partnership with the I ❤ NY program&#x27;s LGBT division, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall uprising, with 150,000 participants and five million spectators attending in Manhattan.

The borough is represented in several prominent idioms. The phrase &quot;&quot; is meant to convey an extremely short time such as an instant, sometimes in hyperbolic form, as in &quot;perhaps faster than you would believe is possible,&quot; referring to the rapid pace of life in Manhattan. The expression &quot;melting pot&quot; was first popularly coined to describe the densely populated immigrant neighborhoods on the Lower East Side in Israel Zangwill&#x27;s play &quot;The Melting Pot&quot;, which was an adaptation of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; set in New York City in 1908. The iconic Flatiron Building is said to have been the source of the phrase &quot;23 skidoo&quot; or scram, from what cops would shout at men who tried to get glimpses of women&#x27;s dresses being blown up by the winds created by the triangular building. The &quot;Big Apple&quot; dates back to the 1920s, when a reporter heard the term used by New Orleans stable-hands to refer to New York City&#x27;s horse racetracks and named his racing column &quot;Around The Big Apple&quot;. Jazz musicians adopted the term to refer to the city as the world&#x27;s jazz capital, and a 1970s ad campaign by the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau helped popularize the term. 

Manhattan is well known for its street parades, which celebrate a broad array of themes, including holidays, nationalities, human rights, and major league sports team championship victories. The majority of higher profile parades in New York City are held in Manhattan. The primary orientation of the annual street parades is typically from north to south, marching along major avenues. The annual Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade is the world&#x27;s largest parade, beginning alongside Central Park and processing southward to the flagship Macy&#x27;s Herald Square store; the parade is viewed on telecasts worldwide and draws millions of spectators in person.

Other notable parades including the world&#x27;s oldest St. Patrick&#x27;s Day Parade, held annually in March since 1762, the Greenwich Village Halloween Parade in October, and numerous parades commemorating the independence days of many nations. Ticker-tape parades celebrating sporting championships won as well as other national accomplishments march northward on Broadway from Bowling Green to City Hall Park in Lower Manhattan, along the Canyon of Heroes. New York Fashion Week, held at various locations in Manhattan, is a high-profile semiannual event featuring models displaying the latest wardrobes created by prominent fashion designers worldwide in advance of these fashions proceeding to the retail marketplace.

==Sports==

Manhattan is home to the NBA&#x27;s New York Knicks and the NHL&#x27;s New York Rangers, both of which play their home games at Madison Square Garden, the only major professional sports arena in the borough. The Garden was also home to the WNBA&#x27;s New York Liberty through the 2017 season, but that team&#x27;s primary home is now the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. The New York Jets proposed a West Side Stadium for their home field, but the proposal was defeated in June 2005, and they now play at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

Manhattan does not currently host a professional baseball franchise. The original New York Giants played primarily in the various incarnations of the Polo Grounds from their inception in 1883 until they headed to California with the Brooklyn Dodgers after the 1957 season. The New York Yankees began their franchise as the Highlanders, named for Hilltop Park, where they played from their creation in 1903 until 1912. The team moved to the Polo Grounds with the 1913 season, where they were officially christened the &quot;New York Yankees&quot;, remaining there until they moved across the Harlem River in 1923 to Yankee Stadium. The New York Mets played in the Polo Grounds in 1962 and 1963, their first two seasons, before Shea Stadium was completed in 1964. After the Mets departed, the Polo Grounds was demolished in April 1964.

The first national college-level basketball championship, the National Invitation Tournament, was held in New York in 1938 and remains in the city. The New York Knicks started play in 1946 as one of the National Basketball Association&#x27;s original teams, playing their first home games at the 69th Regiment Armory, before making Madison Square Garden their permanent home. The New York Liberty of the WNBA shared the Garden with the Knicks from their creation in 1997 as one of the league&#x27;s original eight teams through the 2017 season, after which the team moved nearly all of its home schedule to White Plains, New York. Rucker Park in Harlem is a playground court, famed for its &quot;streetball&quot; style of play, where many NBA athletes have played in the summer league.

Although both of New York City&#x27;s football teams play today in MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, both teams started out playing in the Polo Grounds. The New York Giants played side-by-side with their baseball namesakes from the time they entered the National Football League in 1925, until crossing over to Yankee Stadium in 1956. The New York Jets, originally known as the &quot;Titans of New York&quot;, started out in 1960 at the Polo Grounds, before joining the Mets in Queens at Shea Stadium in 1964.

The New York Rangers of the National Hockey League have played in the various locations of Madison Square Garden since the team&#x27;s founding in the 1926–1927 season. The Rangers were predated by the New York Americans, who started play in the Garden the previous season, lasting until the team folded after the 1941–1942 NHL season, a season it played in the Garden as the &quot;Brooklyn Americans&quot;.

The New York Cosmos of the North American Soccer League played their home games at Downing Stadium for two seasons, starting in 1974. The playing pitch and facilities at Downing Stadium were in unsatisfactory condition, however, and as the team&#x27;s popularity grew they too left for Yankee Stadium, and then Giants Stadium. The stadium was demolished in 2002 to make way for the $45 million, 4,754-seat Icahn Stadium.

==Government==

Since New York City&#x27;s consolidation in 1898, Manhattan has been governed by the New York City Charter; its 1989 revision provided for a strong mayor–council system. The centralized New York City government is responsible for public education, correctional institutions, libraries, public safety, recreational facilities, sanitation, water supply, and welfare services in Manhattan.

The office of Borough President was created in the consolidation of 1898 to balance centralization with local authority. Each borough president had a powerful administrative role derived from having a vote on the New York City Board of Estimate, which was responsible for creating and approving the city&#x27;s budget and proposals for land use. In 1989, the US Supreme Court declared the Board of Estimate unconstitutional because Brooklyn, the most populous borough, had no greater effective representation on the Board than Staten Island, the least populous borough, a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. Since 1990, the largely powerless Borough President has acted as an advocate for the borough at the mayoral agencies, the City Council, the New York state government, and corporations. Manhattan&#x27;s current Borough President is Mark Levine, elected as a Democrat in November 2021.

Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, is the District Attorney of New York County. Manhattan has ten City Council members, the third largest contingent among the five boroughs. It also has twelve administrative districts, each served by a local Community Board. Community Boards are representative bodies that field complaints and serve as advocates for local residents.

As the host of the United Nations, the borough is home to the world&#x27;s largest international consular corps, comprising 105 consulates, consulates general and honorary consulates. It is also the home of New York City Hall, the seat of New York City government housing the Mayor of New York City and the New York City Council. The mayor&#x27;s staff and thirteen municipal agencies are located in the nearby Manhattan Municipal Building, completed in 1914, one of the largest governmental buildings in the world.

===Politics===


















The Democratic Party holds most public offices. Registered Republicans are a minority in the borough, constituting 9.88% of the electorate . Registered Republicans are more than 20% of the electorate only in the neighborhoods of the Upper East Side and the Financial District . Democrats accounted for 68.41% of those registered to vote, while 17.94% of voters were unaffiliated.

As of 2023, three Democrats represented Manhattan in the United States House of Representatives.
* Dan Goldman (first elected in 2022) represents New York&#x27;s 10th congressional district, which includes Lower Manhattan, as well as a portion of Brooklyn. 
* Jerry Nadler (first elected in 1992) represents New York&#x27;s 12th congressional district, which includes the Upper West Side, Upper East Side, and Midtown Manhattan. 
* Adriano Espaillat (first elected in 2016) represents New York&#x27;s 13th congressional district, which includes the Upper Manhattan, as well as part of the northwest Bronx.

===Federal offices===
The United States Postal Service operates post offices in Manhattan. The James Farley Post Office in Midtown Manhattan is New York City&#x27;s main post office. Both the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit are located in Lower Manhattan&#x27;s Foley Square, and the U.S. Attorney and other federal offices and agencies maintain locations in that area.

===Crime and public safety===

Starting in the mid-19th century, the United States became a magnet for immigrants seeking to escape poverty in their home countries. After arriving in New York, many new arrivals ended up living in squalor in the slums of the Five Points neighborhood, an area between Broadway and the Bowery, northeast of New York City Hall. By the 1820s, the area was home to many gambling dens and brothels, and was known as a dangerous place to go. In 1842, Charles Dickens visited the area and was appalled at the horrendous living conditions he had seen. The predominantly Irish Five Points Gang was one of the country&#x27;s first major organized crime entities.

As Italian immigration grew in the early 20th century many joined ethnic gangs, including Al Capone, who got his start in crime with the Five Points Gang. The Mafia (also known as &quot;Cosa Nostra&quot;) first developed in the mid-19th century in Sicily and spread to the US East Coast during the late 19th century following waves of Sicilian and Southern Italian emigration. Lucky Luciano established Cosa Nostra in Manhattan, forming alliances with other criminal enterprises, including the Jewish mob, led by Meyer Lansky, the leading Jewish gangster of that period. From 1920 to 1933, Prohibition helped create a thriving black market in liquor, upon which the Mafia was quick to capitalize.

New York City as a whole experienced a sharp increase in crime during the post-war period. The murder rate in Manhattan hit an all-time high of 42 murders per 100,000 residents in 1979. Manhattan retained the highest murder rate in the city until 1985 when it was surpassed by the Bronx. Most serious violent crime has been historically concentrated in Upper Manhattan and the Lower East Side, though robbery in particular was a major quality of life concern throughout the borough. Through the 1990s and 2000s, levels of violent crime in Manhattan plummeted to levels not seen since the 1950s, with murders in Manhattan dropping from 503 in 1990, at the citywide peak, to 78 in 2022, a decline of 84%.

Today crime rates in most of Lower Manhattan, Midtown, the Upper East Side, and the Upper West Side are consistent with other major city centers in the United States. However, crime rates remain high in the Upper Manhattan neighborhoods of East Harlem, Harlem, Washington Heights, Inwood, and New York City Housing Authority developments across the borough, despite significant reductions. After the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, there had been an increase in violent crime, particularly in Upper Manhattan. Mirroring a nationwide trend, rates of shootings and violent crimes in 2023 declined from their peaks during the pandemic.

==Housing==
The rise of immigration near the turn of the 20th century left major portions of Manhattan, especially the Lower East Side, densely packed with recent arrivals, crammed into unhealthy and unsanitary housing. Tenements were usually five stories high, constructed on the then-typical lots, with &quot;cockroach landlords&quot; exploiting the new immigrants. By 1929, a new housing code effectively ended construction of tenements, though some survive today on the East Side of the borough. Conversely, there were also areas with luxury apartment developments, the first of which was the Dakota on the Upper West Side.

Manhattan offers a wide array of private housing, as well as public housing, which is administered by the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA). Affordable rental and co-operative housing units throughout the borough were created under the Mitchell–Lama Housing Program. There were 923,302 housing units in 2022 at an average density of . , only 24.3% of Manhattan residents lived in owner-occupied housing, the second-lowest rate of all counties in the nation, after the Bronx. Public housing administered by NYCHA accounts for nearly 100,000 residents in more than 50,000 units in 2023. Completed in 1935, the First Houses in the East Village were one of the country&#x27;s first publicly-funded low-income housing projects. At $2,024 in 2022, Manhattan has the highest average cost for rent of any county in the US, although a lower percentage of annual income than in several other American cities.

Manhattan&#x27;s real estate market for luxury housing continues to be among the most expensive in the world, and Manhattan residential property continues to have the highest sale price per square foot in the United States. Manhattan&#x27;s apartments cost , compared to San Francisco housing at , Boston housing at , and Los Angeles housing at . As of the fourth quarter of 2021, the median value of homes in Manhattan was $1,306,208, second highest among US counties.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===
====Public transportation====

Manhattan is unique in the U.S. for intense use of public transportation and lack of private car ownership. While 88% of Americans nationwide drive to their jobs, with only 5% using public transport, mass transit is the dominant form of travel for residents of Manhattan, with 72% of borough residents using public transport to get to work, while only 18% drove. According to the 2000 United States Census, 77.5% of Manhattan households do not own a car. Congestion pricing was implemented in New York City in January 2025 and apply to most motor vehicular traffic using the central business district area of Manhattan south of 60th Street, in an effort to encourage commuters to use mass transit instead.

The New York City Subway, the largest subway system in the world by number of stations, is the primary means of travel within the city, linking every borough except Staten Island. There are 151 subway stations in Manhattan, out of the stations. A second subway, the PATH system, connects six stations in Manhattan to northern New Jersey. Passengers pay fares with pay-per-ride MetroCards, which are valid on all city buses and subways, as well as on PATH trains. Commuter rail services operating to and from Manhattan are the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR), which connects Manhattan and other New York City boroughs to Long Island; the Metro-North Railroad, which connects Manhattan to Upstate New York and Southwestern Connecticut; and NJ Transit trains, which run to various points in New Jersey.

The US$11.1 billion East Side Access project, which brings LIRR trains to Grand Central Terminal, opened in 2023; this project utilized a pre-existing train tunnel beneath the East River, connecting the East Side of Manhattan with Long Island City, Queens. Four multi-billion-dollar projects were completed in the mid-2010s: the $1.4 billion Fulton Center in November 2014, the $2.4 billion 7 Subway Extension in September 2015, the $4 billion World Trade Center Transportation Hub in March 2016, and Phase 1 of the $4.5 billion Second Avenue Subway in January 2017.

MTA New York City Transit offers a wide variety of local buses within Manhattan under the brand New York City Bus. An extensive network of express bus routes serves commuters and other travelers heading into Manhattan. The bus system served 784 million passengers citywide in 2011, placing the bus system&#x27;s ridership as the highest in the nation, and more than double the ridership of the second-place Los Angeles system.

The Roosevelt Island Tramway, one of two commuter cable car systems in North America, takes commuters between Roosevelt Island and Manhattan Island in less than five minutes, and has been serving the island since 1978.

The Staten Island Ferry, which runs 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, annually carries over 21 million passengers on the run between Manhattan and Staten Island. Each weekday, five vessels transport about 65,000 passengers on 109 boat trips. The ferry has been fare-free since 1997. In February 2015, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that the city government would begin NYC Ferry to extend ferry transportation to traditionally underserved communities in the city. The first routes of NYC Ferry opened in 2017. All of the system&#x27;s routes have termini in Manhattan, and the Lower East Side and Soundview routes also have intermediate stops on the East River.
The metro region&#x27;s commuter rail lines converge at New York Penn Station and Grand Central Terminal, on the west and east sides of Midtown Manhattan, respectively. They are the two busiest rail stations in the United States. About one-third of users of mass transit and two-thirds of railway passengers in the country live in New York and its suburbs. Amtrak provides inter-city passenger rail service from Penn Station to Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C.; Upstate New York and New England; cross-Canadian border service to Toronto and Montreal; and destinations in the Southern and Midwestern United States.

The Port Authority Bus Terminal is the city&#x27;s main intercity bus terminal and the world&#x27;s busiest bus station. It serves 250,000 passengers on 7,000 buses each workday in a 1950 building designed to accommodate 60,000 daily passengers. A 2021 plan announced by the Port Authority would spend $10 billion to expand capacity and modernize the facility. In 2024, the Port Authority announced plans for a new terminal that would be completed by 2032 and include a pair of office buildings to defray the costs of the project.

====Taxis====

New York&#x27;s iconic yellow taxicabs, which number 13,087 citywide and must have a medallion authorizing the pickup of street hails, are ubiquitous in the borough. Private vehicle for hire companies provide significant competition for taxicabs.

====Bicycles====

According to the government of New York City, Manhattan had 19,676 bicycle commuters in 2017, roughly doubling from its total of 9,613 in 2012.

====Streets and roads====
The Commissioners&#x27; Plan of 1811 called for twelve numbered &quot;avenues&quot; running north and south roughly parallel to the Hudson River, each wide, with First Avenue on the east side and Twelfth Avenue on the west side. There are several intermittent avenues east of First Avenue, including four additional lettered avenues running from Avenue A eastward to Avenue D in an area now known as Alphabet City. The numbered streets in Manhattan run east–west, and are generally wide, with about between streets. The address algorithm of Manhattan is used to estimate the closest east–west cross street for building numbers on north–south avenues.

According to the original Commissioner&#x27;s Plan, there were 155 numbered crosstown streets, but later the grid was extended up to the northernmost corner of Manhattan Island, where the last numbered street is 220th Street, though the grid continues to 228th Street in the borough&#x27;s Marble Hill neighborhood. Fifteen crosstown streets were designated as wide, including 34th, 42nd, 57th and 125th Streets, which became some of the borough&#x27;s most significant transportation and shopping venues. Broadway, following the route of a Native American trail, is the most notable of many exceptions to the grid, starting at Bowling Green in Lower Manhattan and continuing north for into the Bronx. In much of Midtown Manhattan, Broadway runs at a diagonal to the grid, creating major named intersections at Union Square, Madison Square, Herald Square, Times Square, and Columbus Circle.

&quot;Crosstown streets&quot; refers primarily to major east-west streets connecting Manhattan&#x27;s East Side and West Side. The trip is notoriously frustrating for drivers because of heavy congestion on narrow local streets; absence of express roads other than the Trans-Manhattan Expressway at the far north end of Manhattan Island; and restricted to very limited crosstown automobile travel within Central Park. Proposals to build highways traversing the island through Manhattan&#x27;s densest neighborhoods, namely the Mid-Manhattan Expressway across 34th Street and the Lower Manhattan Expressway through SoHo, failed in the 1960s. In New York City, all turns at red lights are illegal unless a sign permitting such maneuvers is present, significantly shaping traffic patterns in Manhattan.

Another consequence of the strict grid plan of most of Manhattan, and the grid&#x27;s skew of approximately 28.9 degrees, is a phenomenon sometimes referred to as Manhattanhenge (by analogy with Stonehenge). On May 28 and July 12, the sunset is aligned with the street grid lines, with the result that the sun is visible at or near the western horizon from street level. A similar phenomenon occurs with the sunrise on the eastern horizon on December 5 and January 8.

The FDR Drive and Harlem River Drive, both designed by controversial New York master planner Robert Moses, comprise a single, long limited-access parkway skirting the east side of Manhattan along the East River and Harlem River south of Dyckman Street. The Henry Hudson Parkway is the corresponding parkway on the West Side north of 57th Street.

====Bridges, tunnels, and ferries====
Being primarily an island, Manhattan is linked to New York City&#x27;s outer boroughs by bridges. Manhattan has fixed highway connections with New Jersey to its west by way of the George Washington Bridge, the Holland Tunnel, and the Lincoln Tunnel, and to three of the four other New York City boroughs—the Bronx to the northeast, and Brooklyn and Queens (both on Long Island) to the east and south. Its only direct connection with the fifth New York City borough, Staten Island, is the free Staten Island Ferry across New York Harbor, located near Battery Park at Manhattan&#x27;s southern tip. It is also possible to travel on land to Staten Island by way of Brooklyn, via the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge.

The 14-lane George Washington Bridge, the world&#x27;s busiest motor vehicle bridge, connects Washington Heights, in Upper Manhattan to Bergen County in New Jersey. There are numerous bridges to the Bronx across the Harlem River, and five (listed north to south)—the Triborough (known officially as the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge), Ed Koch Queensboro (also known as the 59th Street Bridge), Williamsburg, Manhattan, and Brooklyn Bridges—that cross the East River to connect Manhattan to Long Island.

Several tunnels also link Manhattan Island to New York City&#x27;s outer boroughs and New Jersey. The Lincoln Tunnel, which carries 120,000 vehicles a day under the Hudson River between New Jersey and Midtown Manhattan, is the busiest vehicular tunnel in the world. The tunnel was built instead of a bridge to allow unfettered passage of large passenger and cargo ships that sail through New York Harbor and up the Hudson River to Manhattan&#x27;s piers. The Holland Tunnel, connecting Lower Manhattan to Jersey City, New Jersey, was the world&#x27;s first mechanically ventilated vehicular tunnel. The Queens–Midtown Tunnel, built to relieve congestion on the bridges connecting Manhattan with Queens and Brooklyn, was the largest non-federal project in its time when it was completed in 1940; President Franklin D. Roosevelt was the first person to drive through it. The Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel runs underneath Battery Park and connects the Financial District at the southern tip of Manhattan to Red Hook in Brooklyn.

Several ferry services operate between New Jersey and Manhattan. These ferries mainly serve midtown, Battery Park City, and Wall Street.

====Heliports====
Manhattan has three public heliports: the East 34th Street Heliport (also known as the Atlantic Metro-port), owned by New York City and run by the New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC); the Port Authority Downtown Manhattan/Wall Street Heliport, owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and run by the NYCEDC; and the West 30th Street Heliport, owned by the Hudson River Park Trust.

===Utilities===
Gas and electric service is provided by Consolidated Edison. Manhattan witnessed the doubling of its natural gas supply when a new gas pipeline opened on November 1, 2013. Con Edison operates the world&#x27;s largest district steam system, which consists of of steam pipes, providing steam for heating, hot water, and air conditioning by some 1,800 Manhattan customers. Cable service is provided by Time Warner Cable and telephone service is provided by Verizon Communications, although AT&amp;T is available as well.

The New York City Department of Sanitation is responsible for garbage removal. The bulk of the city&#x27;s trash is disposed at mega-dumps in Pennsylvania, Virginia, South Carolina, and Ohio (via transfer stations in New Jersey, Brooklyn and Queens) since the 2001 closure of the Fresh Kills Landfill on Staten Island. A small amount of trash processed at transfer sites in New Jersey is sometimes incinerated at waste-to-energy facilities.

New York City has the largest clean-air diesel-hybrid and compressed natural gas bus fleet, which also operates in Manhattan, in the country. It also has some of the first hybrid taxis, most of which operate in Manhattan.

===Health care===
There are many hospitals in Manhattan, including two of the 25 largest in the United States (as of 2017):
* Bellevue Hospital
* Lenox Hill Hospital
* Lower Manhattan Hospital
* Metropolitan Hospital Center
* Mount Sinai Beth Israel Hospital
* Mount Sinai Hospital
* NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital
* NYC Health + Hospitals/Harlem
* NYU Langone Medical Center

===Water purity and availability===
New York City is supplied with drinking water by the protected Catskill Mountains watershed. As a result of the watershed&#x27;s integrity and undisturbed natural water filtration system, New York is one of only four major cities in the US with a majority of drinking water pure enough not to require water treatment. The Croton Watershed north of the city is undergoing construction of a US$3.2 billion water purification plant to augment New York City&#x27;s water supply by an estimated 290 million gallons daily, representing a greater than 20% addition to the city&#x27;s water availability. Water comes to Manhattan through the tunnels 1 and 2, and in the future through Tunnel No. 3, begun in 1970.

<doc id="45473" wikidata="Q234583" url="?curid=45473" title="Lynn Margulis">
<text>Lynn Margulis (born Lynn Petra Alexander; March 5, 1938 – November 22, 2011) was an American evolutionary biologist, and was the primary modern proponent for the significance of symbiosis in evolution. In particular, Margulis transformed and fundamentally framed current understanding of the evolution of cells with nuclei by proposing it to have been the result of symbiotic mergers of bacteria. Margulis was also the co-developer of the Gaia hypothesis with the British chemist James Lovelock, proposing that the Earth functions as a single self-regulating system, and was the principal defender and promulgator of the five kingdom classification of Robert Whittaker.

Throughout her career, Margulis&#x27; work could arouse intense objections, and her formative paper, &quot;On the Origin of Mitosing Cells&quot;, appeared in 1967 after being rejected by about fifteen journals. Still a junior faculty member at Boston University at the time, her theory that cell organelles such as mitochondria and chloroplasts were once independent bacteria was largely ignored for another decade, becoming widely accepted only after it was powerfully substantiated through genetic evidence. Margulis was elected a member of the US National Academy of Sciences in 1983. President Bill Clinton presented her the National Medal of Science in 1999. The Linnean Society of London awarded her the Darwin-Wallace Medal in 2008.

Margulis was a strong critic of neo-Darwinism. Her position sparked lifelong debate with leading neo-Darwinian biologists, including Richard Dawkins, George C. Williams, and John Maynard Smith. Margulis&#x27; work on symbiosis and her endosymbiotic theory had important predecessors, going back to the mid-19th century – notably Andreas Franz Wilhelm Schimper, Konstantin Mereschkowski, Boris Kozo-Polyansky, and Ivan Wallin – and Margulis not only promoted greater recognition for their contributions, but personally oversaw the first English translation of Kozo-Polyansky&#x27;s &quot;Symbiogenesis: A New Principle of Evolution&quot;, which appeared the year before her death. Many of her major works, particularly those intended for a general readership, were collaboratively written with her son Dorion Sagan.

In 2002, &quot;Discover&quot; magazine recognized Margulis as one of the 50 most important women in science.

==Early life and education==
Lynn Petra Alexander was born on March 5, 1938 in Chicago, to a Jewish family. Her parents were Morris Alexander and Leona Wise Alexander. She was the eldest of four daughters. Her father was an attorney who also ran a company that made road paints. Her mother operated a travel agency. She entered the Hyde Park Academy High School in 1952, describing herself as a bad student who frequently had to stand in the corner.

A precocious child, she was accepted at the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools at the age of fifteen. In 1957, at age 19, she earned a BA from the University of Chicago in Liberal Arts. She joined the University of Wisconsin to study biology under Hans Ris and Walter Plaut, her supervisor, and graduated in 1960 with an MS in genetics and zoology. (Her first publication, published with Plaut in 1958 in the &quot;Journal of Protozoology&quot;, was on the genetics of &quot;Euglena&quot;, flagellates which have features of both animals and plants.) She then pursued research at the University of California, Berkeley, under the zoologist Max Alfert. Before she could complete her dissertation, she was offered research associateship and then lectureship at Brandeis University in Massachusetts in 1964. It was while working there that she obtained her PhD from the University of California, Berkeley in 1965. Her thesis was &quot;An Unusual Pattern of Thymidine Incorporation in &quot;Euglena&quot;.&quot;

==Career==
In 1966 she moved to Boston University, where she taught biology for twenty-two years. She was initially an Adjunct Assistant Professor, then was appointed to Assistant Professor in 1967. She was promoted to Associate Professor in 1971, to full Professor in 1977, and to University Professor in 1986. In 1988 she was appointed Distinguished Professor of Botany at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. She was Distinguished Professor of Biology in 1993. In 1997 she transferred to the Department of Geosciences at UMass Amherst to become Distinguished Professor of Geosciences &quot;with great delight&quot;, the post which she held until her death.

===Endosymbiosis theory===

In 1966, as a young faculty member at Boston University, Margulis wrote a theoretical paper titled &quot;On the Origin of Mitosing Cells&quot;. The paper, however, was &quot;rejected by about fifteen scientific journals,&quot; she recalled. It was finally accepted by &quot;Journal of Theoretical Biology&quot; and is considered today a landmark in modern endosymbiotic theory. Weathering constant criticism of her ideas for decades, Margulis was famous for her tenacity in pushing her theory forward, despite the opposition she faced at the time. The descent of mitochondria from bacteria and of chloroplasts from cyanobacteria was experimentally demonstrated in 1978 by Robert Schwartz and Margaret Dayhoff. This formed the first experimental evidence for the symbiogenesis theory. The endosymbiosis theory of organogenesis became widely accepted in the early 1980s, after the genetic material of mitochondria and chloroplasts had been found to be significantly different from that of the symbiont&#x27;s nuclear DNA.

In 1995, English evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins had this to say about Lynn Margulis and her work:
I greatly admire Lynn Margulis&#x27;s sheer courage and stamina in sticking by the endosymbiosis theory, and carrying it through from being an unorthodoxy to an orthodoxy. I&#x27;m referring to the theory that the eukaryotic cell is a symbiotic union of primitive prokaryotic cells. This is one of the great achievements of twentieth-century evolutionary biology, and I greatly admire her for it.

===Symbiosis as evolutionary force===

Margulis opposed competition-oriented views of evolution, stressing the importance of symbiotic or cooperative relationships between species.

She later formulated a theory that proposed symbiotic relationships between organisms of different phyla, or kingdoms, as the driving force of evolution, and explained genetic variation as occurring mainly through transfer of nuclear information between bacterial cells or viruses and eukaryotic cells. Her organelle genesis ideas are now widely accepted, but the proposal that symbiotic relationships explain most genetic variation is still something of a fringe idea.

Margulis also held a negative view of certain interpretations of Neo-Darwinism that she felt were excessively focused on competition between organisms, as she believed that history will ultimately judge them as comprising &quot;a minor twentieth-century religious sect within the sprawling religious persuasion of Anglo-Saxon Biology.&quot;
She wrote that proponents of the standard theory &quot;wallow in their zoological, capitalistic, competitive, cost-benefit interpretation of Darwin – having mistaken him ... Neo-Darwinism, which insists on [the slow accrual of mutations by gene-level natural selection], is in a complete funk.&quot;

===Gaia hypothesis===

Margulis initially sought out the advice of James Lovelock for her own research: she explained that, &quot;In the early seventies, I was trying to align bacteria by their metabolic pathways. I noticed that all kinds of bacteria produced gases. Oxygen, hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, ammonia—more than thirty different gases are given off by the bacteria whose evolutionary history I was keen to reconstruct. Why did every scientist I asked believe that atmospheric oxygen was a biological product but the other atmospheric gases—nitrogen, methane, sulfur, and so on—were not? &#x27;Go talk to Lovelock,&#x27; at least four different scientists suggested. Lovelock believed that the gases in the atmosphere were biological.&quot;

Margulis met with Lovelock, who explained his Gaia hypothesis to her, and very soon they began an intense collaborative effort on the concept. One of the earliest significant publications on Gaia was a 1974 paper co-authored by Lovelock and Margulis, which succinctly defined the hypothesis as follows: &quot;The notion of the biosphere as an active adaptive control system able to maintain the Earth in homeostasis we are calling the &#x27;Gaia hypothesis.&#x27;&quot;

Like other early presentations of Lovelock&#x27;s idea, the Lovelock-Margulis 1974 paper seemed to give living organisms complete agency in creating planetary self-regulation, whereas later, as the idea matured, this planetary-scale self-regulation was recognized as an emergent property of the Earth system, life and its physical environment taken together. When climatologist Stephen Schneider convened the 1989 American Geophysical Union Chapman Conference around the issue of Gaia, the idea of &quot;strong Gaia&quot; and &quot;weak Gaia&quot; was introduced by James Kirchner, after which Margulis was sometimes associated with the idea of &quot;weak Gaia&quot;, incorrectly (her essay &quot;Gaia is a Tough Bitch&quot; dates from 1995 – and it stated her own distinction from Lovelock as she saw it, which was primarily that she did not like the metaphor of Earth as a single organism, because, she said, &quot;No organism eats its own waste&quot;). In her 1998 book &quot;Symbiotic Planet&quot;, Margulis explored the relationship between Gaia and her work on symbiosis.

===Five kingdoms of life===
In 1969, life on earth was classified into five kingdoms, as introduced by Robert Whittaker. Margulis became the most important supporter, as well as critic – while supporting parts, she was the first to recognize the limitations of Whittaker&#x27;s classification of microbes. But later discoveries of new organisms, such as archaea, and emergence of molecular taxonomy challenged the concept. By the mid-2000s, most scientists began to agree that there are more than five kingdoms. Margulis became the most important defender of the five kingdom classification. She rejected the three-domain system introduced by Carl Woese in 1990, which gained wide acceptance. She introduced a modified classification by which all life forms, including the newly discovered, could be integrated into the classical five kingdoms. According to Margulis, the main problem, archaea, falls under the kingdom Prokaryotae alongside bacteria (in contrast to the three-domain system, which treats archaea as a higher taxon than kingdom, or the six-kingdom system, which holds that it is a separate kingdom). Margulis&#x27; concept is given in detail in her book &quot;Five Kingdoms&quot;, written with Karlene V. Schwartz. It has been suggested that it is mainly because of Margulis that the five-kingdom system survives.

=== Metamorphosis theory ===
In 2009, via a then-standard publication-process known as &quot;communicated submission&quot; (which bypassed traditional peer review), she was instrumental in getting the &quot;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&quot; (&quot;PNAS&quot;) to publish a paper by Donald I. Williamson rejecting &quot;the Darwinian assumption that larvae and their adults evolved from a single common ancestor.&quot; Williamson&#x27;s paper provoked immediate response from the scientific community, including a countering paper in &quot;PNAS&quot;. Conrad Labandeira of the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History said, &quot;If I was reviewing [Williamson&#x27;s paper] I would probably opt to reject it,&quot; he says, &quot;but I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a bad thing that this is published. What it may do is broaden the discussion on how metamorphosis works and [...] [on] the origin of these very radical life cycles.&quot; But Duke University insect developmental biologist Fred Nijhout said that the paper was better suited for the &quot;&quot;National Enquirer&quot; than the National Academy.&quot; In September it was announced that &quot;PNAS&quot; would eliminate communicated submissions in July 2010. &quot;PNAS&quot; stated that the decision had nothing to do with the Williamson controversy.

=== AIDS/HIV theory ===
In 2009 Margulis and seven others authored a position paper concerning research on the viability of round body forms of some spirochetes, &quot;Syphilis, Lyme disease, &amp; AIDS: Resurgence of &#x27;the great imitator&#x27;?&quot; which states that, &quot;Detailed research that correlates life histories of symbiotic spirochetes to changes in the immune system of associated vertebrates is sorely needed&quot;, and urging the &quot;reinvestigation of the natural history of mammalian, tick-borne, and venereal transmission of spirochetes in relation to impairment of the human immune system&quot;. The paper went on to suggest &quot;that the possible direct causal involvement of spirochetes and their round bodies to symptoms of immune deficiency be carefully and vigorously investigated&quot;.

In a &quot;Discover Magazine&quot; interview, Margulis explained her reason for interest in the topic of the 2009 &quot;AIDS&quot; paper: &quot;I&#x27;m interested in spirochetes only because of our ancestry. I&#x27;m not interested in the diseases&quot;, and stated that she had called them &quot;symbionts&quot; because both the spirochete which causes syphilis (&quot;Treponema&quot;) and the spirochete which causes Lyme disease (&quot;Borrelia&quot;) only retain about 20% of the genes they would need to live freely, outside of their human hosts.

However, in the &quot;Discover Magazine&quot; interview Margulis said that &quot;the set of symptoms, or syndrome, presented by syphilitics overlaps completely with another syndrome: AIDS&quot;, and also noted that Kary Mullis said that &quot;he went looking for a reference substantiating that HIV causes AIDS and discovered, &#x27;There is no such document&#x27; &quot;.

This provoked a widespread supposition that Margulis had been an &quot;AIDS denialist&quot;. Jerry Coyne reacted on his &quot;Why Evolution is True&quot; blog against his interpretation that Margulis believed &quot;that AIDS is really syphilis, not viral in origin at all.&quot; Seth Kalichman, a social psychologist who studies behavioral and social aspects of AIDS, cited her [Margulis] 2009 paper as an example of AIDS denialism &quot;flourishing&quot;, and asserted that her [Margulis] &quot;endorsement of HIV/AIDS denialism defies understanding&quot;.

==Reception==
Historian Jan Sapp has said that &quot;Lynn Margulis&#x27;s name is as synonymous with symbiosis as Charles Darwin&#x27;s is with evolution.&quot; She has been called &quot;science&#x27;s unruly earth mother&quot;, a &quot;vindicated heretic&quot;, or a scientific &quot;rebel&quot;, It has been suggested that initial rejection of Margulis&#x27; work on the endosymbiotic theory, and the controversial nature of it as well as Gaia theory, made her identify throughout her career with scientific mavericks, outsiders, and unaccepted theories generally.

In the last decade of her life, while key components of her life&#x27;s work began to be understood as fundamental to a modern scientific viewpoint – the widespread adoption of Earth System Science and the incorporation of key parts of endosymbiotic theory into biology curricula worldwide – Margulis if anything became more embroiled in controversy, not less. Journalist John Wilson explained this by saying that Lynn Margulis &quot;defined herself by oppositional science,&quot; and in the commemorative collection of essays &quot;Lynn Margulis: The Life and Legacy of a Scientific Rebel&quot;, commentators again and again depict her as a modern embodiment of the &quot;scientific rebel&quot;, akin to Freeman Dyson&#x27;s 1995 essay &quot;The Scientist as Rebel&quot;, a tradition Dyson saw embodied in Benjamin Franklin, and which Dyson believed to be essential to good science.

== Personal life ==
Margulis married astronomer Carl Sagan in 1957 soon after she got her bachelor&#x27;s degree. Sagan was then a graduate student in physics at the University of Chicago. Their marriage ended in 1964, just before she completed her PhD. They had two sons, Dorion Sagan, who later became a popular science writer and her collaborator, and Jeremy Sagan, software developer and founder of Sagan Technology.

In 1967 she married Thomas N. Margulis, a crystallographer. They had a son named Zachary Margulis-Ohnuma, a New York City criminal defense lawyer, and a daughter Jennifer Margulis, teacher and author. They divorced in 1980.

She commented, &quot;I quit my job as a wife twice,&quot; and, &quot;it&#x27;s not humanly possible to be a good wife, a good mother, and a first-class scientist. No one can do it — something has to go.&quot;

In the 2000s she had a relationship with fellow biologist Ricardo Guerrero.

Margulis argued that the September 11 attacks were a &quot;false-flag operation, which has been used to justify the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq as well as unprecedented assaults on [...] civil liberties.&quot; She wrote that there was &quot;overwhelming evidence that the three buildings [of the World Trade Center] collapsed by controlled demolition.&quot;

She was a religious agnostic, and a staunch evolutionist, but rejected the modern evolutionary synthesis, and said: &quot;I remember waking up one day with an epiphanous revelation: I am not a neo-Darwinist! I recalled an earlier experience, when I realized that I wasn&#x27;t a humanistic Jew. Although I greatly admire Darwin&#x27;s contributions and agree with most of his theoretical analysis and I am a Darwinist, I am not a neo-Darwinist.&quot; She argued that &quot;Natural selection eliminates and maybe maintains, but it doesn&#x27;t create&quot;, and maintained that symbiosis was the major driver of evolutionary change.

Margulis died on November 22, 2011, at home in Amherst, Massachusetts, five days after suffering a hemorrhagic stroke. As her wish, she was cremated and her ashes were scattered in her favorite research areas, near her home.

<text>Grand Teton National Park is a national park of the United States in northwestern Wyoming. At approximately , the park includes the major peaks of the Teton Range as well as most of the northern sections of the valley known as Jackson Hole. Grand Teton National Park is south of Yellowstone National Park, to which it is connected by the John D. Rockefeller Jr. Memorial Parkway which is managed by the National Park Service. Along with surrounding national forests, these three protected areas constitute the almost Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, one of the world&#x27;s largest intact mid-latitude temperate ecosystems.

The human history of the Grand Teton region dates back at least 11,000 years when the first Paleo-Indians began migrating into the region during warmer months to pursue food and supplies. In the early 19th century, the first explorers encountered the eastern Shoshone people. Between 1810 and 1840, the region attracted fur trading companies that vied for control of the lucrative beaver pelt trade. U.S. government expeditions to the region commenced in the mid-19th century as an offshoot of exploration in Yellowstone, with the first permanent white settlers in Jackson Hole arriving in the 1880s.

Efforts to preserve the region as a national park began in the late 19th century, and in 1929 Grand Teton National Park was established, protecting the Teton Range&#x27;s major peaks. The valley of Jackson Hole remained in private ownership until the 1930s when conservationists led by John D. Rockefeller Jr. began purchasing land in Jackson Hole to be added to the existing national park. Against public opinion and with repeated Congressional efforts to repeal the measures, much of Jackson Hole was set aside for protection as Jackson Hole National Monument in 1943. The monument was abolished in 1950 and most of the monument land was added to Grand Teton National Park.

Grand Teton National Park is named for Grand Teton, the tallest mountain in the Teton Range. The naming of the mountains is attributed to early 19th-century French-speaking trappers— (the three teats) was later anglicized and shortened to &quot;Tetons&quot;. At , Grand Teton abruptly rises more than above Jackson Hole, almost higher than Mount Owen, the second-highest summit in the range. The park has numerous lakes, including Jackson Lake as well as streams of varying length and the upper main stem of the Snake River. Though in a state of recession, a dozen small glaciers persist at the higher elevations near the highest peaks in the range. Some of the rocks in the park are the oldest found in any American national park and have been dated at nearly 2.7 billion years.

Grand Teton National Park is an almost pristine ecosystem and the same species of flora and fauna that have existed since prehistoric times can still be found there. More than 1,000 species of vascular plants, dozens of species of mammals, 300 species of birds, more than a dozen fish species, and a few species of reptiles and amphibians inhabit the park. Due to various changes in the ecosystem, some of them human-induced, efforts have been made to provide enhanced protection to some species of native fish and the increasingly threatened whitebark pine.

Grand Teton National Park is a popular destination for mountaineering, hiking, fishing, and other forms of recreation. There are more than 1,000 drive-in campsites and over of hiking trails that provide access to backcountry camping areas. Noted for world-renowned trout fishing, the park is one of the few places to catch Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout. Grand Teton has several National Park Service–run visitor centers and privately operated concessions for motels, lodges, gas stations, and marinas.

==Human history==

===Paleo-Indians and Native Americans===

Paleo-Indian presence in what is now Grand Teton National Park dates back more than 11,000 years. Jackson Hole valley climate at that time was colder and more alpine than the semi-arid climate found today, and the first humans were migratory hunter-gatherers spending summer months in Jackson Hole and wintering in the valleys west of the Teton Range. Along the shores of Jackson Lake, fire pits, tools, and what are thought to have been fishing weights have been discovered. One of the tools found is of a type associated with the Clovis culture, and tools from this cultural period date back at least 11,500 years. Some of the tools are made of obsidian which chemical analysis indicates came from sources near present-day Teton Pass, south of Grand Teton National Park. Though obsidian was also available north of Jackson Hole, virtually all the obsidian spear points found are from a source to the south, indicating that the main seasonal migratory route for the Paleo-Indian was from this direction. Elk, which winter on the National Elk Refuge at the southern end of Jackson Hole and northwest into higher altitudes during spring and summer, follow a similar migratory pattern to this day. From 11,000 to about 500 years ago, there is little evidence of change in the migratory patterns amongst the Native American groups in the region and no evidence that indicates any permanent human settlement.

When white American colonists first entered the region in the first decade of the 19th century, they encountered the eastern tribes of the Shoshone people. Most of the Shoshone that lived in the mountain vastness of the greater Yellowstone region continued to be pedestrian while other groups of Shoshone that resided in lower elevations had limited use of horses. The mountain-dwelling Shoshone were known as &quot;Sheep-eaters&quot; or &quot;Tukudika&quot; as they referred to themselves, since a staple of their diet was the Bighorn Sheep. The Shoshones continued to follow the same migratory pattern as their predecessors and have been documented as having a close spiritual relationship with the Teton Range. Several stone enclosures on some of the peaks, including on the upper slopes of Grand Teton (known simply as &quot;The Enclosure&quot;) are thought to have been used by Shoshone during vision quests. The Teton and Yellowstone region Shoshone were relocated to the Wind River Indian Reservation after it was established in 1868. The reservation is situated southeast of Jackson Hole on land that was selected by Chief Washakie.

===Fur trade exploration===
The Lewis and Clark Expedition (1804–1806) passed well north of the Grand Teton region. During their return trip from the Pacific Ocean, expedition member John Colter was given an early discharge so he could join two fur trappers who were heading west in search of beaver pelts. Colter was later hired by Manuel Lisa to lead fur trappers and explore the region around the Yellowstone River. During the winter of 1807/08, Colter passed through Jackson Hole and was the first Caucasian to see the Teton Range. Lewis and Clark expedition co-leader William Clark produced a map based on the previous expedition and included the explorations of John Colter in 1807, apparently based on discussions between Clark and Colter when the two met in St. Louis, Missouri in 1810. Another map attributed to William Clark indicates John Colter entered Jackson Hole from the northeast, crossing the Continental Divide at either Togwotee Pass or Union Pass and left the region after crossing Teton Pass, following the well established Native American trails. In 1931, the Colter Stone, a rock carved in the shape of a head with the inscription &quot;John Colter&quot; on one side and the year &quot;1808&quot; on the other, was discovered in a field in Tetonia, Idaho, which is west of Teton Pass. The Colter Stone has not been authenticated to have been created by John Colter and may have been the work of later expeditions to the region.
John Colter is widely considered the first mountain man and, like those that came to the Jackson Hole region over the next 30 years, he was there primarily for the profitable fur trapping; the region was rich with the highly sought after pelts of beaver and other fur-bearing animals. Between 1810 and 1812, the Astorians traveled through Jackson Hole and crossed Teton Pass as they headed east in 1812. After 1810, American and British fur trading companies were in competition for control of the North American fur trade, and American sovereignty over the region was not secured until the signing of the Oregon Treaty in 1846. One party employed by the British North West Company and led by explorer Donald Mackenzie entered Jackson Hole from the west in 1818 or 1819. The Tetons, as well as the valley west of the Teton Range known today as Pierre&#x27;s Hole, may have been named by French-speaking Iroquois or French Canadian trappers that were part of Mackenzie&#x27;s party. Earlier parties had referred to the most prominent peaks of the Teton Range as the Pilot Knobs. The French trappers&#x27; (the three breasts) was later shortened to the Tetons.

Formed in the mid-1820s, the Rocky Mountain Fur Company partnership included Jedediah Smith, William Sublette, and David Edward Jackson or &quot;Davey Jackson&quot;. Jackson oversaw the trapping operations in the Teton region between 1826 and 1830. Sublette named the valley east of the Teton Range &quot;Jackson&#x27;s Hole&quot; (later simply Jackson Hole) for Davey Jackson. As the demand for beaver fur declined and the various regions of the American West became depleted of beaver due to over trapping, American fur trading companies folded; however, individual mountain men continued to trap beaver in the region until about 1840. From the mid-1840s until 1860, Jackson Hole and the Teton Range were generally devoid of all but the small populations of Native American tribes that had already been there. Most overland human migration routes such as the Oregon and Mormon Trails crossed over South Pass, well to the south of the Teton Range, and Caucasian influence in the Teton region was minimal until the U.S. Government commenced organized explorations.

===Organized exploration and settlement===

The first U.S. Government-sponsored expedition to enter Jackson Hole was the 1859–60 Raynolds Expedition. Led by U.S. Army Captain William F. Raynolds and guided by mountain man Jim Bridger, it included naturalist F. V. Hayden, who later led other expeditions to the region. The expedition had been charged with exploring the Yellowstone region, but encountered difficulties crossing mountain passes due to snow. Bridger ended up guiding the expedition south over Union Pass then following the Gros Ventre River drainage to the Snake River and leaving the region over Teton Pass. Organized exploration of the region was halted during the American Civil War but resumed when F. V. Hayden led the well-funded Hayden Geological Survey of 1871. In 1872, Hayden oversaw explorations in Yellowstone, while a branch of his expedition known as the Snake River Division was led by James Stevenson and explored the Teton region. Along with Stevenson was photographer William Henry Jackson who took the first photographs of the Teton Range. The Hayden Geological Survey named many of the mountains and lakes in the region. The explorations by early mountain men and subsequent expeditions failed to identify any sources of economically viable mineral wealth. Nevertheless, small groups of prospectors set up claims and mining operations on several of the creeks and rivers. By 1900 all organized efforts to retrieve minerals had been abandoned.
Though the Teton Range was never permanently inhabited, pioneers began settling in the Jackson Hole valley to the east of the range in 1884. These earliest homesteaders were mostly single men who endured long winters, short growing seasons and rocky soils that were hard to cultivate. The region was most suited for the cultivation of hay and cattle ranching. By 1890, Jackson Hole had an estimated permanent population of 60. Menor&#x27;s Ferry was built in 1892 near present-day Moose, Wyoming to provide access for wagons to the west side of the Snake River. Ranching increased significantly from 1900 to 1920, but a series of agricultural related economic downturns in the early 1920s left many ranchers destitute. Beginning in the 1920s, the automobile provided faster and easier access to areas of natural beauty and old military roads into Jackson Hole over Teton and Togwotee Passes were improved to accommodate the increased vehicle traffic. In response to the increased tourism, dude ranches were established, some new and some from existing cattle ranches, so urbanized travelers could experience the life of a cowboy.

===Establishment of the park===

To the north of Jackson Hole, Yellowstone National Park had been established in 1872, and by the close of the 19th century, conservationists wanted to expand the boundaries of that park to include at least the Teton Range. By 1907, in an effort to regulate water flow for irrigation purposes, the United States Bureau of Reclamation had constructed a log crib dam at the Snake River outlet of Jackson Lake. This dam failed in 1910 and a new concrete Jackson Lake Dam replaced it by 1911. The dam was further enlarged in 1916, raising lake waters as part of the Minidoka Project, designed to provide irrigation for agriculture in the state of Idaho. Further dam construction plans for other lakes in the Teton Range alarmed Yellowstone National Park superintendent Horace Albright, who sought to block such efforts. Jackson Hole residents were opposed to an expansion of Yellowstone, but were more in favor of the establishment of a separate national park which would include the Teton Range and six lakes at the base of the mountains. After congressional approval, President Calvin Coolidge signed the executive order establishing the Grand Teton National Park on February 26, 1929.

The valley of Jackson Hole remained primarily in private ownership when John D. Rockefeller Jr. and his wife visited the region in the late 1920s. Horace Albright and Rockefeller discussed ways to preserve Jackson Hole from commercial exploitation, and in consequence, Rockefeller started buying Jackson Hole properties through the Snake River Land Company to later turn them over to the National Park Service. In 1930, this plan was revealed to the residents of the region and was met with strong disapproval. Congressional efforts to prevent the expansion of Grand Teton National Park ended up putting the Snake River Land Company&#x27;s holdings in limbo. By 1942 Rockefeller had become increasingly impatient that his purchased property might never be added to the park, and wrote to the Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes that he was considering selling the land to another party. Secretary Ickes recommended to President Franklin Roosevelt that the Antiquities Act, which permitted presidents to set aside land for protection without the approval of Congress, be used to establish a national monument in Jackson Hole. Roosevelt created the Jackson Hole National Monument in 1943, using the land donated from the Snake River Land Company and adding additional property from Teton National Forest. The monument and park were adjacent to each other and both were administered by the National Park Service, but the monument designation ensured no funding allotment, nor provided a level of resource protection equal to the park. Members of Congress repeatedly attempted to have the new national monument abolished.

After the end of World War II, national public sentiment was in favor of adding the monument to the park, and though there was still much local opposition, the monument and park were combined in 1950. In recognition of John D. Rockefeller Jr.&#x27;s efforts to establish and then expand Grand Teton National Park, a parcel of land between Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks was added to the National Park Service in 1972. This land and the road from the southern boundary of the park to West Thumb in Yellowstone National Park was named the John D. Rockefeller Jr. Memorial Parkway. The Rockefeller family owned the JY Ranch, which bordered Grand Teton National Park to the southwest. In November 2007, the Rockefeller family transferred ownership of the ranch to the park for the establishment of the Laurance S. Rockefeller Preserve, which was dedicated on June 21, 2008.

===History of mountaineering===

During the last 25 years of the 19th century, the mountains of the Teton Range became a focal point for explorers wanting to claim the first ascents of the peaks. However, white explorers may not have been the first to climb many of the peaks and the earliest first ascent of even the formidable Grand Teton itself might have been achieved long before written history documented it. Native American relics remain including &quot;The Enclosure&quot;, a human-made structure that is located about below the summit of Grand Teton at a point near the Upper Saddle (). Nathaniel P. Langford and James Stevenson, both members of the Hayden Geological Survey of 1872, found The Enclosure during their early attempt to summit Grand Teton. Langford claimed that he and Stevenson climbed Grand Teton, but were vague as to whether they had made it to the summit. Their reported obstacles and sightings were never corroborated by later parties. Langford and Stevenson likely did not get much further than The Enclosure. The first ascent of Grand Teton that is substantiated was made by William O. Owen, Frank Petersen, John Shive and Franklin Spencer Spalding on August 11, 1898. Owen had made two previous attempts on the peak and after publishing several accounts of this first ascent, discredited any claim that Langford and Stevenson had ever reached beyond The Enclosure in 1872. The disagreement over which party first reached the top of Grand Teton may be the greatest controversy in the history of American mountaineering. After 1898 no other ascents of Grand Teton were recorded until 1923.

By the mid-1930s, more than a dozen different climbing routes had been established on Grand Teton including the northeast ridge in 1931 by Glenn Exum. Glenn Exum teamed up with another noted climber named Paul Petzoldt to found the Exum Mountain Guides in 1931. Of the other major peaks on the Teton Range, all were climbed by the late 1930s including Mount Moran in 1922 and Mount Owen in 1930 by Fritiof Fryxell and others after numerous previous attempts had failed. Both Middle and South Teton were first climbed on the same day, August 29, 1923, by a group of climbers led by Albert R. Ellingwood. New routes on the peaks were explored as safety equipment and skills improved and eventually climbs rated at above 5.9 on the Yosemite Decimal System difficulty scale were established on Grand Teton. The classic climb following the route first pioneered by Owen, known as the Owen-Spalding route, is rated at 5.4 due to a combination of concerns beyond the gradient alone. Rock climbing and bouldering had become popular in the park by the mid 20th century. In the late 1950s, gymnast John Gill came to the park and started climbing large boulders near Jenny Lake. Gill approached climbing from a gymnastics perspective and while in the Tetons became the first known climber in history to use gymnastic chalk to improve handholds and to keep hands dry while climbing. During the latter decades of the 20th century, extremely difficult cliffs were explored including some in Death Canyon, and by the mid-1990s, 800 different climbing routes had been documented for the various peaks and canyon cliffs.

==Park management==

Grand Teton National Park is one of the ten most visited national parks in the U.S., with an annual average of 2.75 million visitors in the period from 2007 to 2016, with 3.27 million visiting in 2016. The National Park Service is a federal agency of the United States Department of the Interior and manages both Grand Teton National Park and the John D. Rockefeller Jr. Memorial Parkway. Grand Teton National Park has an average of 100 permanent and 180 seasonal employees. The park also manages 27 concession contracts that provide services such as lodging, restaurants, mountaineering guides, dude ranching, fishing and a boat shuttle on Jenny Lake. The National Park Service works closely with other federal agencies such as the U.S. Forest Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Reclamation, and also, in consequence of Jackson Hole Airport&#x27;s presence in the park, the Federal Aviation Administration. Initial construction of the airstrip north of the town of Jackson was completed in the 1930s. When Jackson Hole National Monument was designated, the airport was inside it. After the monument and park were combined, the Jackson Hole Airport became the only commercial airport within an American national park. Jackson Hole Airport has some of the strictest noise abatement regulations of any airport in the U.S. The airport has night flight curfews and overflight restrictions, with pilots being expected to approach and depart the airport along the east, south or southwest flight corridors.

===Expansion===
, 110 privately owned property inholdings, many belonging to the state of Wyoming, are located within Grand Teton National Park. Efforts to purchase or trade these inholdings for other federal lands are ongoing and through partnerships with other entities, $10 million is hoped to be raised to acquire private inholdings by 2016.

In December 2016 the Antelope Flats Parcel consisting of (owned by the State of Wyoming as part of state school trust lands) was purchased and transferred to Grand Teton National Park. The purchase price amounted to $46 million ($23 million allocated from the Land and Water Conservation Fund and the last $23 million was raised in private funds from 5,421 donors). Moulton Ranch Cabins, a inholding along the historic Mormon Row was sold to the Grand Teton National Park Foundation in 2018. 

In 2020 the National Park Service in partnership with the Conservation Fund acquired a parcel located within Grand Teton National Park. This parcel is located near the Granite Canyon Entrance Station. 

The was offered by the state of Wyoming in order to fund schools. Located on a migration route for pronghorn, mule deer, elk and other species, the parcel is at the mouth of the Gros Ventre River Valley. The National Park Service could only acquire the land at its appraised value, leaving charitable organizations to cover the higher sale price demanded by Wyoming legislators. The Wyoming Board of Land Commissioners approved the sale which was completed at the end of 2024.

==Geography==

Grand Teton National Park is located in the northwestern region of the U.S. state of Wyoming. To the north the park is bordered by the John D. Rockefeller Jr. Memorial Parkway, which is administered by Grand Teton National Park. The scenic highway with the same name passes from the southern boundary of Grand Teton National Park to West Thumb in Yellowstone National Park. Grand Teton National Park covers approximately , while the John D. Rockefeller Jr. Memorial Parkway includes . Most of the Jackson Hole valley and virtually all the major mountain peaks of the Teton Range are within the park. The Jedediah Smith Wilderness of Caribou-Targhee National Forest lies along the western boundary and includes the western slopes of the Teton Range. To the northeast and east lie the Teton Wilderness and Gros Ventre Wilderness of Bridger-Teton National Forest. The National Elk Refuge is to the southeast, and migrating herds of elk winter there. Privately owned land borders the park to the south and southwest. Grand Teton National Park, along with Yellowstone National Park, surrounding National Forests and related protected areas constitute the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem spans portions of three states and is one of the largest intact mid-latitude ecosystems remaining on Earth. By road, Grand Teton National Park is from Salt Lake City, Utah and from Denver, Colorado.

===Teton Range===

The youngest mountain range in the Rocky Mountains, the Teton Range began forming between 6 and 9 million years ago. It runs roughly north to south and rises from the floor of Jackson Hole without any foothills along a by wide active fault-block mountain front. The range tilts westward, rising abruptly above Jackson Hole valley which lies to the east but more gradually into Teton Valley to the west. A series of earthquakes along the Teton Fault slowly displaced the western side of the fault upward and the eastern side of the fault downward at an average of of displacement every 300–400 years. Most of the displacement of the fault occurred in the last 2 million years. While the fault has experienced up to 7.5-earthquake magnitude events since it formed, it has been relatively quiescent during historical periods, with only a few 5.0-magnitude or greater earthquakes known to have occurred since 1850.

In addition to Grand Teton, another nine peaks are over above sea level. Eight of these peaks between Avalanche and Cascade Canyons make up the often-photographed Cathedral Group. The most prominent peak north of Cascade Canyon is the monolithic Mount Moran () which rises above Jackson Lake. To the north of Mount Moran, the range eventually merges into the high altitude Yellowstone Plateau. South of the central Cathedral Group the Teton Range tapers off near Teton Pass and blends into the Snake River Range.

West to east trending canyons provides easier access by foot into the heart of the range as no vehicular roads traverse the range except at Teton Pass, which is south of the park. Carved by a combination of glacier activity as well as numerous streams, the canyons are at their lowest point along the eastern margin of the range at Jackson Hole. Flowing from higher to lower elevations, the glaciers created more than a dozen U-shaped valleys throughout the range. Cascade Canyon is sandwiched between Mount Owen and Teewinot Mountain to the south and Symmetry Spire to the north and is situated immediately west of Jenny Lake. North to south, Webb, Moran, Paintbrush, Cascade, Death and Granite Canyons slice through Teton Range.

=== Jackson Hole ===
Jackson Hole is a by wide graben valley with an average elevation of , its lowest point is near the southern park boundary at . The valley sits east of the Teton Range and is vertically displaced downward , making the Teton Fault and its parallel twin on the east side of the valley normal faults with the Jackson Hole block being the hanging wall and the Teton Mountain block being the footwall. Grand Teton National Park contains the major part of both blocks. Erosion of the range provided sediment in the valley so the topographic relief is only . Jackson Hole is comparatively flat, with only a modest increase in altitude south to north; however, a few isolated buttes such as Blacktail Butte and hills including Signal Mountain dot the valley floor. In addition to a few outcroppings, the Snake River has eroded terraces into Jackson Hole. Southeast of Jackson Lake, glacial depressions known as kettles are numerous. The kettles were formed when ice situated under gravel outwash from ice sheets melted as the glaciers retreated.

=== Lakes and rivers ===
Most of the lakes in the park were formed by glaciers and the largest of these lakes are located at the base of the Teton Range. In the northern section of the park lies Jackson Lake, the largest lake in the park at in length, wide and deep. Though Jackson Lake is natural, the Jackson Lake Dam was constructed at its outlet before the creation of the park, and the lake level was raised almost consequently. East of the Jackson Lake Lodge lies Emma Matilda and Two Ocean Lakes. South of Jackson Lake, Leigh, Jenny, Bradley, Taggart and Phelps Lakes rest at the outlets of the canyons which lead into the Teton Range. Within the Teton Range, small alpine lakes in cirques are common, and there are more than 100 scattered throughout the high country. Lake Solitude, located at an elevation of , is in a cirque at the head of the North Fork of Cascade Canyon. Other high-altitude lakes can be found at over in elevation and a few, such as Icefloe Lake, remain ice-clogged for much of the year. The park is not noted for large waterfalls; however, Hidden Falls just west of Jenny Lake is easy to reach after a short hike.

From its headwaters on Two Ocean Plateau in Yellowstone National Park, the Snake River flows north to south through the park, entering Jackson Lake near the boundary of Grand Teton National Park and John D. Rockefeller Jr. Memorial Parkway. The Snake River then flows through the spillways of the Jackson Lake Dam and from there southward through Jackson Hole, exiting the park just west of the Jackson Hole Airport. The largest lakes in the park all drain either directly or by tributary streams into the Snake River. Major tributaries which flow into the Snake River include Pacific Creek and Buffalo Fork near Moran and the Gros Ventre River at the southern border of the park. Through the comparatively level Jackson Hole valley, the Snake River descends an average of , while other streams descending from the mountains to the east and west have higher gradients due to increased slope. The Snake River creates braids and channels in sections where the gradients are lower and in steeper sections, erodes and undercuts the cobblestone terraces once deposited by glaciers.

=== Glaciation ===

The major peaks of the Teton Range were carved into their current shapes by long-vanished glaciers. Commencing 250,000–150,000 years ago, the Tetons went through several periods of glaciation with some areas of Jackson Hole covered by glaciers thick. This heavy glaciation is unrelated to the uplift of the range itself and is instead part of a period of global cooling known as the Quaternary glaciation. Beginning with the Buffalo Glaciation and followed by the Bull Lake and then the Pinedale glaciation, which ended roughly 15,000 years ago, the landscape was greatly impacted by glacial activity. During the Pinedale glaciation, the landscape visible today was created as glaciers from the Yellowstone Plateau flowed south and formed Jackson Lake, while smaller glaciers descending from the Teton Range pushed rock moraines out from the canyons and left behind lakes near the base of the mountains. The peaks themselves were carved into horns and arêtes and the canyons were transformed from water-eroded V-shapes to glacier-carved U-shaped valleys. Approximately a dozen glaciers currently exist in the park, but they are not ancient as they were all reestablished sometime between 1400 and 1850 AD during the Little Ice Age. Of these more recent glaciers, the largest is Teton Glacier, which sits below the northeast face of Grand Teton. Teton Glacier is long and wide, and nearly surrounded by the tallest summits in the range. Teton Glacier is also the best-studied glacier in the range, and researchers concluded in 2005 that the glacier could disappear in 30 to 75 years. West of the Cathedral Group near Hurricane Pass, Schoolroom Glacier is tiny but has well-defined terminal and lateral moraines, a small proglacial lake, and other typical glacier features near each other.

== Geology ==

Grand Teton National Park has some of the most ancient rocks found in any American national park. The oldest rocks dated so far are 2,680 ± 12 million years old, though even older rocks are believed to exist in the park. Formed during the Archean Eon (4 to 2.5 billion years ago), these metamorphic rocks include gneiss, schist and amphibolites. Metamorphic rocks are the most common types found in the northern and southern sections of the Teton Range. 2,545 million years ago, the metamorphic rocks were intruded by igneous granitic rocks, which are now visible in the central Tetons including Grand Teton and the nearby peaks. The light-colored granites of the central Teton Range contrast with the darker metamorphic gneiss found on the flanks of Mount Moran to the north. Magmatic intrusions of diabase rocks 765 million years ago left dikes that can be seen on the east face of Mount Moran and Middle Teton. Granitic and pegmatite intrusions also worked their way into fissures in the older gneiss. Precambrian rocks in Jackson Hole are buried deep under comparatively recent Tertiary volcanic and sedimentary deposits, as well as Pleistocene glacial deposits.

By the close of the Precambrian, the region was intermittently submerged under shallow seas, and for 500 million years various types of sedimentary rocks were formed. During the Paleozoic (542 to 251 million years ago) sandstone, shale, limestone and dolomite were deposited. Though most of these sedimentary rocks have since eroded away from the central Teton Range, they are still evident on the northern, southern and western flanks of the range. One notable exception is the sandstone Flathead Formation which continues to cap Mount Moran. Sedimentary layering of rocks in Alaska Basin, which is on the western border of Grand Teton National Park, chronicles a 120-million-year period of sedimentary deposition. Fossils found in the sedimentary rocks in the park include algae, brachiopods and trilobites. Sedimentary deposition continued during the Mesozoic (250–66 million years ago) and the coal seams found in the sedimentary rock strata indicate the region was densely forested during that era. Numerous coal seams of in thickness are interspersed with siltstone, claystone and other sedimentary rocks. During the late Cretaceous, a volcanic arc west of the region deposited fine-grained ash that later formed into bentonite, an important mineral resource.

From the end of the Mesozoic to the present, the region went through a series of uplifts and erosional sequences. Commencing 66 million years ago the Laramide orogeny was a period of mountain-building and erosion in western North America that created the ancestral Rocky Mountains. This cycle of uplift and erosion left behind one of the most complete non-marine Cenozoic rock sequences found in North America. Conglomerate rocks composed of quartzite and interspersed with mudstone and sandstones were deposited during erosion from a now vanished mountain range that existed to the northwest of the current Teton Range. These deposits also have trace quantities of gold and mercury. During the Eocene and Oligocene, volcanic eruptions from the ancestral Absaroka Range buried the region under various volcanic deposits. Sedimentary basins developed in the region due to drop faulting, creating an ancestral Jackson Hole and by the Pliocene (10 million years ago), an ancestral Jackson Lake known as Teewinot Lake. During the Quaternary, landslides, erosion and glacial activity deposited soils and rock debris throughout the Snake River valley of Jackson Hole and left behind terminal moraines which impound the current lakes. The most recent example of rapid alteration to the landscape occurred in 1925 just east of the park when the Gros Ventre landslide was triggered by spring melt from a heavy snowpack as well as heavy rain.

== Ecology ==

=== Flora ===

Grand Teton National Park and the surrounding region host over 1,000 species of vascular plants. With an altitude range of over , the park has a number of different ecological zones including alpine tundra, the Rocky Mountains subalpine zone where spruce-fir forests are dominant, and the valley floor, where a mixed conifer and deciduous forest zone occupies regions with better soils intermixed with sagebrush plains atop alluvial deposits. Additionally, wetlands near some lakes and in the valley floor adjacent to rivers and streams cover large expanses, especially along the Snake River near Oxbow Bend near Moran and Willow Flats near the Jackson Lake Lodge. Altitude, available soils, wildfire incidence, avalanches and human activities have a direct impact on the types of plant species in an immediate area. Where these various niches overlap is known as an ecotone.

The range of altitude in Grand Teton National Park impacts the types of plant species found at various elevations. In the alpine zone above the tree line, which in Grand Teton National Park is at approximately , tundra conditions prevail. In this treeless region, hundreds of species of grass, wildflower, moss and lichen are found. In the subalpine region from the tree line to the base of the mountains, whitebark pine, limber pine, subalpine fir, and Engelmann spruce are dominant. In the valley floor, lodgepole pine is most common but Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, and blue spruce inhabit drier areas, while aspen, cottonwood, alder, and willow are more commonly found around lakes, streams, and wetlands. However, the tablelands above the Snake River channel are mostly sagebrush plains and in terms of acreage are the most widespread habitat in the park. The sagebrush plains or flats have 100 species of grasses and wildflowers. Slightly more elevated sections of the plains of the northern sections of Jackson Hole form forest islands with one such obvious example being Timbered Island. In this ecotone, forested islands surrounded by sagebrush expanses provide shelter for various animal species during the day and nearby grasses for nighttime foraging.

While the flora of Grand Teton National Park is generally healthy, the whitebark pine, and to a lesser degree the lodgepole pine, are considered at risk. In the case of the whitebark pine, an invasive species of fungus known as white pine blister rust weakens the tree, making it more susceptible to destruction from endemic mountain pine beetles. Whitebark pines generally thrive at elevations above and produce large seeds that are high in fat content and an important food source for various species such as the grizzly bear, red squirrel and Clark&#x27;s nutcracker. The species is considered to be a keystone and a foundation species; keystone in that its &quot;ecological role (is) disproportionately large relative to its abundance&quot; and foundation in that it has a paramount role that &quot;defines ecosystem structure, function, and process&quot;. Whitebark pine has generally had a lower incidence of blister rust infection throughout the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem than in other regions such as Glacier National Park and the Cascade Range. The incidence of blister rust on whitebark pines in Yellowstone National Park is slightly lower than in Grand Teton. Though blister rust is not in itself the cause of increased mortality, its weakening effect on trees allows native pine beetles to have more easily infest the trees, increasing mortality. While general practice in national parks is to allow nature to take its course, the alarming trend of increased disease and mortality of the vital whitebark pine trees has sparked a collaborative effort amongst various government entities to intervene to protect the species.

=== Fauna ===
Sixty-one species of mammals have been recorded in Grand Teton National Park. This includes the gray wolf, which had been extirpated from the region by the early 1900s but migrated into the Grand Teton National Park from adjacent Yellowstone National Park after the species had been reintroduced there. The re-establishment of the wolves has ensured that every indigenous mammal species now exists in the park. In addition to gray wolves, another 17 species of carnivorans reside within Grand Teton National Park including grizzlies and the more commonly seen American black bear. Relatively common sightings of coyote, river otter, marten and badger and occasional sightings of cougar, lynx and wolverine are reported annually. A number of rodent species exist including yellow-bellied marmot, least chipmunk, muskrat, beaver, Uinta ground squirrel, pika, snowshoe hare, porcupine, and six species of bats.

Of the larger mammals, the most common are elk, which exist in the thousands. Their migration route between the National Elk Refuge and Yellowstone National Park is through Grand Teton National Park, so while easily seen anytime of the year, they are most numerous in the spring and fall. Other ungulates in the park include moose, bison, and pronghorn—the fastest land mammal in the western hemisphere. The park&#x27;s moose tend to stay near waterways and wetlands. Between 100 and 125 bighorn sheep dwell in the alpine and rocky zones of the peaks.

Over 300 species of birds have been sighted in the park including the calliope hummingbird, the smallest bird species in mainland North America, as well as trumpeter swans, which is North America&#x27;s largest waterfowl. In addition to trumpeter swans, another 30 species of waterfowl have been recorded including blue-winged teal, common merganser, American wigeon and the colorful but reclusive harlequin duck which is occasionally spotted in Cascade Canyon. Both bald and golden eagles and other birds of prey such as the osprey, red-tailed hawk, American kestrel and occasional sightings of peregrine falcon have been reported. Of the 14 species of owls reported, the most common is the great horned owl, though the boreal owl and great grey owl are also seen occasionally. A dozen species of woodpeckers have been reported, as have a similar number of species of warblers, plovers and gulls. The vocal and gregarious black-billed magpie frequents campgrounds while Steller&#x27;s jay and Clark&#x27;s nutcracker are found in the backcountry. The sage covered plains of Jackson Hole are favored areas for sage grouse, Brewer&#x27;s sparrow and sage thrashers, while the wetlands are frequented by great blue heron, American white pelican, sandhill crane and on rare occasions its endangered relative, the whooping crane.

The Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout (or Snake River cutthroat trout) is the only native trout species in Grand Teton National Park. It is also the only subspecies of cutthroat trout that is exclusively native to large streams and rivers. Various researchers have not been able to identify any genetic differences between the Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout and the Yellowstone cutthroat trout, though in terms of appearances, the Snake River subspecies has much smaller spots that cover a greater portion of the body, and the two subspecies inhabit different ecological niches. The Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout was identified by some researchers as a separate subspecies by the mid-1990s, and is managed as a distinct subspecies by the state of Wyoming, but is not yet recognized as such by the neighboring states of Idaho and Montana. Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout is found only in the Snake River and tributaries below the Jackson Lake dam to the Palisades Reservoir in Idaho. Other non-native species of trout such as the rainbow trout and lake trout were introduced by the Wyoming Fish and Game Department or migrated out of Yellowstone. Today five trout species inhabit park waters. Native species of fish include the mountain whitefish, longnose dace, mountain sucker and non-native species include the Utah chub and Arctic grayling.

Only four species of reptiles are documented in the park: three species of snakes which are the wandering garter snake, the less commonly seen valley garter snake, and rubber boa, as well as one lizard species, the northern sagebrush lizard, that was first reported in 1992. None of the species are venomous. Six amphibian species have been documented including the Columbia spotted frog, boreal chorus frog, tiger salamander and the increasingly rare boreal toad and northern leopard frog. A sixth amphibian species, the bullfrog, was introduced. An estimated 10,000 insect species frequent the park; they pollinate plants, provide a food source for birds, fish, mammals, and other animals, and help in the decomposition of wood. In one example of the importance of insects to the ecosystem, swarms of Army cutworm moths die in huge numbers after mating and provide a high fat and protein diet for bears and other predators. One study concluded that when this moth species is most available, bears consume 40,000 moths per day which is roughly 20,000 kcal/day.

Grand Teton National Park permits the hunting of elk to keep the populations of that species regulated. This provision was included in the legislation that combined Jackson Hole National Monument and Grand Teton National Park in 1950. While some national parks in Alaska permit subsistence hunting by indigenous natives and a few other National Park Service managed areas allow hunting under highly regulated circumstances, hunting in American national parks is not generally allowed. In Grand Teton National Park, hunters are required to obtain Wyoming hunting licenses and be deputized as park rangers. Hunting is restricted to areas east of the Snake River, and north of Moran, the hunt is permitted only east of U.S. Route 89. Proponents of continuing the elk hunt, which occurs in the fall, argue that the elk herd would become overpopulated without it, leading to vegetation degradation from overgrazing elk herds. Opponents cite that there has been an increase of predators such as the wolf and grizzly bear in Grand Teton National Park, rendering the annual hunt unnecessary and exposing hunters to attacks by grizzly bears as they become accustomed to feeding on remains left behind from the hunt.

=== Fire ecology ===

The role of wildfire is an important one for plant and animal species diversity. Many tree species have evolved to mainly germinate after a wildfire. Regions of the park that have experienced wildfire in historical times have greater species diversity after reestablishment than those regions that have not been influenced by fire. Though the Yellowstone fires of 1988 had minimal impact on Grand Teton National Park, studies conducted before and reaffirmed after that event concluded that the suppression of natural wildfires during the middle part of the 20th century decreased plant species diversity and natural regeneration of plant communities. One study conducted 15 years before the 1988 Yellowstone National Park fires concluded that human suppression of wildfire had adversely impacted Aspen tree groves and other forest types. The majority of conifer species in Grand Teton National Park are heavily dependent on wildfire and this is particularly true of the Lodgepole Pine. Though extremely hot canopy or crown fires tend to kill Lodgepole Pine seeds, lower severity surface fires usually result in a higher post-wildfire regeneration of this species. In accordance with a better understanding of the role wildfire plays in the environment, the National Park Service and other land management agencies have developed Fire Management Plans which provide a strategy for wildfire management and are expected to best enhance the natural ecosystem.

=== Air and water quality ===
Grand Teton National Park is more than air distance from any major urban or industrial area, and localized human activities have generally had a very low environmental impact on the surrounding region. However, levels of ammonium and nitrogen have been trending slightly upwards due to deposition from rain and snow that is believed to originate from regional agricultural activities. Additionally, there has also been a slight increase in mercury and pesticides that have been detected in snow and some alpine lakes. Ozone and haze may be impacting overall visibility levels. Grand Teton National Park, in partnership with other agencies, erected the first air quality monitoring station in the park in 2011. The station is designed to check for various pollutants as well as ozone levels and weather.

A 2005 study of the water of Jackson, Jenny, and Taggart Lakes indicated that all three of these lakes had virtually pristine water quality. Of the three lakes, only on Taggart Lake are motorized boats prohibited, yet little difference in water quality was detected in the three lakes. In a study published in 2002, the Snake River was found to have better overall water quality than other river systems in Wyoming, and low levels of pollution from sources.

==Climate==
According to the Köppen climate classification system, Grand Teton National Park has a humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;).

== Recreation ==

=== Mountaineering ===
Grand Teton National Park is a popular destination for mountain and rock climbers partly because the mountains are easily accessible by road. Trails are well marked and routes to the summits of most peaks are long established, and for the experienced and fit, most peaks can be climbed in one day. The highest maintained trails climb from the floor of Jackson Hole over to mountain passes that are sometimes called saddles or divides. From these passes, the climbs follow routes that require varying skill levels. Climbers do not need a permit but are encouraged to voluntarily register their climbing plans with the National Park Service and inform associates of their itinerary. Any climb requiring an overnight stay in the backcountry does require a permit. Climbers are essentially on their own to determine their own skill levels and are encouraged to not take unnecessary risks. The Exum Mountain Guides, which is considered one of the finest mountaineering guide services in the U.S., as well as the Jackson Hole Mountain Guides, offer instruction and climbing escorts for those who are less experienced or unfamiliar with various routes.
An average of 4,000 climbers per year make an attempt to summit Grand Teton and most ascend up Garnet Canyon to a mountain pass called the Lower Saddle, which is between Grand Teton and Middle Teton. From the Lower Saddle, climbers often follow the Owen-Spalding or Exum Ridge routes to the top of Grand Teton though there are 38 distinct routes to the summit. The north face route to the summit of Grand Teton is a world-renowned climb involving a dozen distinct pitches and is rated at grade 5.8 in difficulty for the vertical ascent. On a connecting ridge and just north of Grand Teton lies Mount Owen, and though lower in altitude, this peak is considered more difficult to ascend. Middle Teton is another popular climb that is most easily summited from a saddle between it and South Teton. Well, north of Grand Teton lies Mount Moran, which is further from trailheads and more difficult to access and ascend. The Direct South Buttress of Mount Moran provides a vertical mile of climbing that was considered the most difficult climb in the U.S. when first accomplished in 1953. Other popular climbing destinations include Buck Mountain, Symmetry Spire, Mount Saint John, Mount Wister, Teewinot Mountain and Nez Perce Peak and each mountain has at least six established routes to their summits.

=== Camping and hiking ===
Grand Teton National Park has five front-country vehicular access campgrounds. The largest is the Colter Bay and Gros Ventre campgrounds, and each has 350 campsites which can accommodate large recreational vehicles. Lizard Creek and Signal Mountain campgrounds have 60 and 86 campsites respectively, while the smaller Jenny Lake campground has only 49 sites for tent use only. Additionally, full hookups for recreational vehicles are at the concessionaire-managed 112 campsites at Colter Bay Village and another 100 at Flagg Ranch in the John D. Rockefeller Memorial Parkway. Though all front-country campgrounds are only open from late spring to late fall, primitive winter camping is permitted at Colter Bay near the visitor center.

All campsites accessible only on foot or by horseback are considered backcountry campsites and they are available by permit only, but camping is allowed in most of these backcountry zones year-round. The National Park Service has a combination of specific sites and zones for backcountry camping with a set carrying capacity of overnight stays per zone to protect the resources from overcrowding. Open fires are not permitted in the backcountry and all food must be stored in an Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee approved bear-resistant container. As of 2012, only four brands of bear-resistant containers had been approved for use in the Grand Teton National Park backcountry. Additionally, hikers may use an approved bear spray to elude aggressive bears.

The park has of hiking trails, ranging in difficulty from easy to strenuous. The easiest hiking trails are located in the valley, where the altitude changes are generally minimal. In the vicinity of Colter Bay Village, the Hermitage Point Trail is long and considered easy. Several other trails link Hermitage Point with Emma Matilda Lake and Two Ocean Lake Trails, also considered to be relatively easy hikes in the Jackson Lake Lodge area. Other easy hikes include the Valley Trail which runs from Trapper Lake in the north to the south park boundary near Teton Village and the Jenny Lake Trail which circles the lake. Ranging from moderate to strenuous in difficulty, trails leading into the canyons are rated based on distance and more importantly on the amount of elevation change. The greatest elevation change is found on the Paintbrush Canyon, Alaska Basin and Garnet Canyon Trails, where elevation increases of over are typical. Horses and pack animals are permitted on almost all trails in the park; however, there are only five designated backcountry camping locations for pack animals and these campsites are far from the high mountain passes. Bicycles are limited to vehicle roadways only and the park has widened some roads to provide a safer biking experience. A paved multi-use pathway opened in 2009 and provides non-motorized biking access from the town of Jackson to South Jenny Lake.

=== Boating and fishing ===

Grand Teton National Park allows boating on all the lakes in Jackson Hole, but motorized boats can only be used on Jackson and Jenny Lakes. While there is no maximum horsepower limit on Jackson Lake (though there is a noise restriction), Jenny Lake is restricted to 10 horsepower. Only non-motorized boats are permitted on Bearpaw, Bradley, Emma Matilda, Leigh, Phelps, String, Taggart and Two Ocean Lakes. There are four designated boat launches located on Jackson Lake and one on Jenny Lake. Additionally, sailboats, windsurfers, and water skiing are only allowed on Jackson Lake and no jet skis are permitted on any of the park waterways. All boats are required to comply with various safety regulations including personal flotation devices for each passenger. Only non-motorized watercraft are permitted on the Snake River. All other waterways in the park are off limits to boating, and this includes all alpine lakes and tributary streams of the Snake River.

In 2010, Grand Teton National Park started requiring all boats to display an Aquatic Invasive Species decal issued by the Wyoming Game and Fish Department or a Yellowstone National Park boat permit. In an effort to keep the park waterways free of various invasive species such as the Zebra mussel and whirling disease, boaters are expected to abide by certain regulations including displaying a self-certification of compliance on the dashboard of any vehicle attached to an empty boat trailer.

Grand Teton National Park fisheries are managed by the Wyoming Fish and Game Department and a Wyoming state fishing license is required to fish all waterways in Grand Teton National Park. The creel limit for trout is restricted to six per day, including no more than three cutthroat trout with none longer than , while the maximum length of other trout species may not exceed , except those taken from Jackson Lake, where the maximum allowable length is . There are also restrictions as to the seasonal accessibility to certain areas as well as the types of bait and fishing tackle permitted.

=== Winter activities ===

Visitors are allowed to snowshoe and do cross-country skiing and are not restricted to trails. The Teton Park Road between the Taggart Lake trailhead to Signal Mountain Campground is closed to vehicular traffic during the winter and this section of the road is groomed for skiing and snowshoeing traffic. The park service offers guided snowshoe tours daily from the main headquarters located in Moose, Wyoming. Overnight camping is allowed in the winter in the backcountry with a permit and visitors should inquire about avalanche dangers.

The only location in Grand Teton National Park where snowmobiles are permitted is on Jackson Lake. The National Park Service requires that all snowmobiles use &quot;Best Available Technology&quot; (BAT) and lists various models of snowmobiles that are permitted, all of which are deemed to provide the least amount of air pollution and maximize noise abatement. All snowmobiles must be less than 10 years old and have odometer readings of less than . Additionally, snowmobile use is for the purposes of accessing ice fishing locations only. Snowmobile access was permitted between Moran Junction and Flagg Ranch adjacent to the John D. Rockefeller Jr. Memorial Parkway so that travelers using the Continental Divide Snowmobile Trail could traverse between Bridger-Teton National Forest and Yellowstone National Park. However, in 2009, winter use planners closed this since unguided snowmobile access into Yellowstone National Park was also discontinued.

== Tourism ==

=== Visitor centers ===

The Craig Thomas Discovery and Visitor Center adjacent to the park headquarters at Moose, Wyoming, is open year-round. Opened in 2007 to replace an old, inadequate visitor center, the facility is named for the late U.S. Senator Craig Thomas and designed by acclaimed architect, Bohlin Cywinski Jackson. It was financed with a combination of federal grants and private donations. An adjoining 154-seat auditorium was opened to the public in April 2011. To the north at Colter Bay Village on Jackson Lake, the Colter Bay Visitor Center &amp; Indian Arts Museum is open from the beginning of May to the early October. The Colter Bay Visitor Center &amp; Indian Arts Museum has housed the David T. Vernon Indian Arts Exhibit since 1972. The Colter Bay Visitor Center was built in 1956 and was determined in 2005 to be substandard for the proper care and display of the Indian art collection. During the winter of 2011–2012, a $150,000 renovation project was completed at the center and a portion of the arts collection was made available for viewing when the center opened for the season in May 2012.

South of Moose on the Moose–Wilson Road, the Laurance S. Rockefeller Preserve Center is located on land that was privately owned by Laurance S. Rockefeller and is situated on Phelps Lake. Donated to Grand Teton National Park and opened to the public in 2008, the property was once part of the JY Ranch, the first dude ranch in Jackson Hole. At Jenny Lake, the Jenny Lake Visitor Center is open from mid-May to mid-September. This visitor center is within the Jenny Lake Ranger Station Historic District and is the same structure photographer Harrison Crandall had constructed as an art studio in the 1920s.
=== Accommodations ===
Contracted through the National Park Service, various concessionaire entities manage lodging facilities inside the park. The largest such facility is the Jackson Lake Lodge, which is managed by the Grand Teton Lodge Company. Located near Jackson Lake Dam, the Jackson Lake Lodge has a total of 385 rooms, meeting facilities, a retail shop, and a restaurant. The Grand Teton Lodge Company also manages the Jenny Lake Lodge, which consists of cabins and a restaurant, and Colter Bay Village, which has cabins, a restaurant, a grocery store, and a laundry, and a marina. South of Jackson Lake Dam, the Signal Mountain Lodge is managed by Forever Resorts and provides cabins, a marina, a gas station and a restaurant. The American Alpine Club has hostel dormitory-style accommodations primarily reserved for mountain climbers at the Grand Teton Climber&#x27;s Ranch. Adjacent to the Snake River in Moose, Wyoming, Dornan&#x27;s is an inholding on private land which has year-round cabin accommodations and related facilities. Lodging is also available at the Triangle X Ranch, another private inholding in the park and the last remaining dude ranch within park boundaries.

==Hazards==

Encountering bears is a concern in the Teton Range. There are other concerns as well, including bugs, wildfires, adverse snow conditions and nighttime cold temperatures.

Importantly, there have been notable incidents, including accidental deaths, due to falls from steep cliffs (a could be fatal in this class 4/5 terrain) and due to falling rocks, over the years, including 1993, 2007 (involving an experienced NOLS leader), 2015 and 2018. Other incidents include a seriously injured backpacker being airlifted near SquareTop Mountain in 2005, and a fatal hiker incident (from an apparent accidental fall) in 2006 that involved state search and rescue. The U.S. Forest Service does not offer updated aggregated records on the official number of fatalities in the Wind River Range.

<text>Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a multi-systemic genetic disorder that affects the connective tissue. Those with the condition tend to be tall and thin, with long arms, legs, fingers, and toes. They also typically have exceptionally flexible joints and abnormally curved spines. The most serious complications involve the heart and aorta, with an increased risk of mitral valve prolapse and aortic aneurysm. The lungs, eyes, bones, and the covering of the spinal cord are also commonly affected. The severity of the symptoms is variable.
MFS is caused by a mutation in &quot;FBN1&quot;, one of the genes that make fibrillin, which results in abnormal connective tissue. It is an autosomal dominant disorder. In about 75% of cases, it is inherited from a parent with the condition, while in about 25% it is a new mutation. Diagnosis is often based on the Ghent criteria, family history and genetic testing (DNA analysis).
There is no known cure for MFS. Many of those with the disorder have a normal life expectancy with proper treatment. Management often includes the use of beta blockers such as propranolol or atenolol or, if they are not tolerated, calcium channel blockers or ACE inhibitors. Surgery may be required to repair the aorta or replace a heart valve. Avoiding strenuous exercise is recommended for those with the condition.
About 1 in 5,000 to 1 in 10,000 people have MFS. Rates of the condition are similar in different regions of the world. It is named after French pediatrician Antoine Marfan, who first described it in 1896.

==Signs and symptoms==

More than 30 signs and symptoms are variably associated with Marfan syndrome. The most prominent of these affect the skeletal, cardiovascular, and ocular systems, but all fibrous connective tissue throughout the body can be affected.

===Skeletal system===
Most of the readily visible signs are associated with the skeletal system. Many people with Marfan syndrome grow to above-average height, and some have disproportionately long, slender limbs with thin, weak wrists and long fingers and toes.

The Steinberg sign, also known as the thumb sign, is one of the clinical examination tests for Marfan disease in the hands. It is a clinical test in which the tip of the thumb extends beyond the palm when the thumb is clasped in the clenched hand.

Besides affecting height and limb proportions, people with Marfan syndrome may have abnormal lateral curvature of the spine scoliosis, thoracic lordosis, abnormal indentation (&quot;pectus excavatum&quot;) or protrusion (&quot;pectus carinatum&quot;) of the sternum, abnormal joint flexibility, a high-arched palate with crowded teeth and an overbite, flat feet, hammer toes, stooped shoulders, and unexplained stretch marks on the skin. It can also cause pain in the joints, bones, and muscles. Some people with Marfan have speech disorders resulting from symptomatic high palates and small jaws. Early osteoarthritis may occur. Other signs include limited range of motion in the hips due to the femoral head protruding into abnormally deep hip sockets.

===Eyes===

In Marfan syndrome, the health of the eye can be affected in many ways, but the principal change is partial lens dislocation, where the lens is shifted out of its normal position. This occurs because of weakness in the ciliary zonules, the connective tissue strands which suspend the lens within the eye. The mutations responsible for Marfan syndrome weaken the zonules and cause them to stretch. The inferior zonules are most frequently stretched resulting in the lens shifting upwards and outwards, but it can shift in other directions as well. Nearsightedness (myopia), and blurred vision are common due to connective tissue defects in the eye. Farsightedness can also result particularly if the lens is highly subluxated. Subluxation (partial dislocation) of the lens can be detected clinically in about 60% of people with Marfan syndrome by the use of a slit-lamp biomicroscope. If the lens subluxation is subtle, then imaging with high-resolution ultrasound biomicroscopy might be used.

Other signs and symptoms affecting the eye include increased length along an axis of the globe, myopia, corneal flatness, strabismus, exotropia, and esotropia. Those with MFS are also at a high risk for early glaucoma and early cataracts.

===Cardiovascular system===
The most serious signs and symptoms associated with Marfan syndrome involve the cardiovascular system: undue fatigue, shortness of breath, heart palpitations, racing heartbeats, or chest pain radiating to the back, shoulder, or arm. Cold arms, hands, and feet can also be linked to MFS because of inadequate circulation. A heart murmur, abnormal reading on an ECG, or symptoms of angina can indicate further investigation. The signs of regurgitation from prolapse of the mitral or aortic valves (which control the flow of blood through the heart) result from cystic medial degeneration of the valves, which is commonly associated with MFS (see mitral valve prolapse, aortic regurgitation). However, the major sign that would lead a doctor to consider an underlying condition is a dilated aorta or an aortic aneurysm. Sometimes, no heart problems are apparent until the weakening of the connective tissue (cystic medial degeneration) in the ascending aorta causes an aortic aneurysm or aortic dissection, a surgical emergency. An aortic dissection is most often fatal and presents with pain radiating down the back, giving a tearing sensation.

Because underlying connective tissue abnormalities cause MFS, the incidence of dehiscence of prosthetic mitral valve is increased. Care should be taken to attempt repair of damaged heart valves rather than replacement.

===Lungs===
Individuals with Marfan syndrome may be affected by various lung-related problems. One study found that only 37% of the patient sample studied (mean age 32±14 years; M 45%) had normal lung function. Spontaneous pneumothorax is common. In spontaneous unilateral pneumothorax, air escapes from a lung and occupies the pleural space between the chest wall and a lung. The lung becomes partially compressed or collapsed. This can cause pain, shortness of breath, cyanosis, and, if not treated, death. Other possible pulmonary manifestations of MFS include sleep apnea and idiopathic obstructive lung disease. Pathologic changes in the lungs have been described such as cystic changes, emphysema, pneumonia, bronchiectasis, bullae, apical fibrosis and congenital malformations such as middle lobe hypoplasia.

===Nervous system===
Dural ectasia, the weakening of the connective tissue of the dural sac encasing the spinal cord, can result in a loss of quality of life. It can be present for a long time without producing any noticeable symptoms. Symptoms that can occur are lower back pain, leg pain, abdominal pain, other neurological symptoms in the lower extremities, or headachessymptoms which usually diminish when lying flat. On X-ray, however, dural ectasia is not often visible in the early stages. A worsening of symptoms might warrant an MRI of the lower spine. Dural ectasia that has progressed to this stage would appear in an MRI as a dilated pouch wearing away at the lumbar vertebrae. Other spinal issues associated with MFS include degenerative disc disease, spinal cysts, and dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system.

==Genetics==

Each parent with the condition has a 50% risk of passing the genetic defect on to any child due to its autosomal dominant nature. Most individuals with MFS have another affected family member. About 75% of cases are inherited. On the other hand, about 15–30% of all cases are due to &quot;de novo&quot; genetic mutations; such spontaneous mutations occur in about one in 20,000 births. Marfan syndrome is also an example of dominant negative mutation and haploinsufficiency. It is associated with variable expressivity; complete penetrance has been definitively documented.

==Pathogenesis==
Marfan syndrome is caused by mutations in the &quot;FBN1&quot; gene on chromosome 15, which encodes fibrillin 1, a glycoprotein component of the extracellular matrix. Fibrillin-1 is essential for the proper formation of the extracellular matrix, including the biogenesis and maintenance of elastic fibers. The extracellular matrix is critical for both the structural integrity of connective tissue, but also serves as a reservoir for growth factors. Elastic fibers are found throughout the body, but are particularly abundant in the aorta, ligaments and the ciliary zonules of the eye; consequently, these areas are among the worst affected.

A transgenic mouse has been created carrying a single copy of a mutant fibrillin-1, a mutation similar to that found in the human gene known to cause MFS. This mouse strain recapitulates many of the features of the human disease and promises to provide insights into the pathogenesis of the disease. Reducing the level of normal fibrillin 1 causes a Marfan-related disease in mice.

Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) plays an important role in MFS. Fibrillin-1 directly binds a latent form of TGF-β, keeping it sequestered and unable to exert its biological activity. The simplest model suggests reduced levels of fibrillin-1 allow TGF-β levels to rise due to inadequate sequestration. Although how elevated TGF-β levels are responsible for the specific pathology seen with the disease is not proven, an inflammatory reaction releasing proteases that slowly degrade the elastic fibers and other components of the extracellular matrix is known to occur. The importance of the TGF-β pathway was confirmed with the discovery of the similar Loeys–Dietz syndrome involving the &quot;TGFβR2&quot; gene on chromosome 3, a receptor protein of TGF-β. Marfan syndrome has often been confused with Loeys–Dietz syndrome, because of the considerable clinical overlap between the two pathologies.

===Marfanoid–progeroid–lipodystrophy syndrome===

Marfanoid–progeroid–lipodystrophy syndrome (MPL), also referred to as Marfan lipodystrophy syndrome (MFLS), is a variant of MFS in which Marfan symptoms are accompanied by features usually associated with neonatal progeroid syndrome (also referred to as Wiedemann–Rautenstrauch syndrome) in which the levels of white adipose tissue are reduced. Since 2010, evidence has been accumulating that MPL is caused by mutations near the 3&#x27;-terminus of the &quot;FBN1&quot; gene. It has been shown that these people are also deficient in asprosin, a gluco-regulatory protein hormone which is the C-terminal cleavage product of profibrillin. The levels of asprosin seen in these people were lower than expected for a heterozygous genotype, consistent with a dominant negative effect.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnostic criteria of MFS were agreed upon internationally in 1996. However, Marfan syndrome is often difficult to diagnose in children, as they typically do not show symptoms until reaching pubescence. A diagnosis is based on family history and a combination of major and minor indicators of the disorder, rare in the general population, that occur in one individualfor example: four skeletal signs with one or more signs in another body system such as ocular and cardiovascular in one individual. The following conditions may result from MFS, but may also occur in people without any known underlying disorder.
* Aortic aneurysm or dilation
* Arachnodactyly
* GERD
* Bicuspid aortic valve
* Cysts
* Cystic medial necrosis
* Degenerative disc disease
* Deviated septum
* Dural ectasia
* Early cataracts
* Early glaucoma
* Early osteoarthritis
* Ectopia lentis
* Emphysema
* Iris coloboma
* Above-average height
* Heart palpitations
* Hernias
* High-arched palate
* Hypermobility of the joints
* Kyphosis (hunched back)
* Leaky heart valve
* Malocclusion
* Micrognathia (small lower jaw)
* Mitral valve prolapse
* Myopia (nearsightedness)
* Obstructive lung disease
* Osteopenia (low bone density)
* Pectus carinatum or excavatum
* Pes planus (flat feet)
* Pneumothorax (collapsed lung)
* Retinal detachment
* Scoliosis
* Sleep apnea
* Stretch marks not from pregnancy or obesity
* Teeth crowded
* &quot;Narrow, thin face&quot;
* Temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD)
===Revised Ghent nosology===
In 2010, the Ghent nosology was revised, and new diagnostic criteria superseded the previous agreement made in 1996. The seven new criteria can lead to a diagnosis:

In the absence of a family history of MFS:

# Aortic root Z-score ≥ 2 AND ectopia lentis
# Aortic root Z-score ≥ 2 AND an FBN1 mutation
# Aortic root Z-score ≥ 2 AND a systemic score* &gt; 7 points
# Ectopia lentis AND an FBN1 mutation with known aortic pathology

In the presence of a family history of MFS (as defined above):
# Ectopia lentis
# Systemic score* ≥ 7
# Aortic root Z-score ≥ 2
* Points for systemic score:
** Wrist AND thumb sign = 3 (wrist OR thumb sign = 1)
** Pectus carinatum deformity = 2 (pectus excavatum or chest asymmetry = 1)
** Hindfoot deformity = 2 (plain pes planus = 1)
** Dural ectasia = 2
** Protrusio acetabuli = 2
** pneumothorax = 2
** Reduced upper segment/lower segment ratio AND increased arm/height AND no severe scoliosis = 1
** Scoliosis or thoracolumbar kyphosis = 1
** Reduced elbow extension = 1
** Facial features (3/5) = 1 (dolichocephaly, enophthalmos, downslanting palpebral fissures, malar hypoplasia, retrognathia)
** Skin striae (stretch marks) = 1
** Myopia &gt; 3 diopters = 1
** Mitral valve prolapse = 1

The thumb sign (Steinberg&#x27;s sign) is elicited by asking the person to flex the thumb as far as possible and then close the fingers over it. A positive thumb sign is where the entire distal phalanx is visible beyond the ulnar border of the hand, caused by a combination of hypermobility of the thumb as well as a thumb which is longer than usual.

The wrist sign (Walker-Murdoch sign) is elicited by asking the person to curl the thumb and fingers of one hand around the other wrist. A positive wrist sign is where the little finger and the thumb overlap, caused by a combination of thin wrists and long fingers.

===Differential diagnosis===
Many other disorders can produce the same type of body characteristics as Marfan syndrome. Genetic testing and evaluating other signs and symptoms can help to differentiate these. The following are some of the disorders that can manifest as &quot;marfanoid&quot;:
* Congenital contractural arachnodactyly, also known as Beals–Hecht syndrome
* Ehlers–Danlos syndrome
* Homocystinuria
* Loeys–Dietz syndrome
* MASS phenotype
* Multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 2B
* Shprintzen–Goldberg syndrome
* Stickler syndrome

==Management==
There is no cure for Marfan syndrome, but life expectancy has increased significantly over the last few decades and is now similar to that of the average person.

Regular checkups are recommended to monitor the health of the heart valves and the aorta. Marfan syndrome is treated by addressing each issue as it arises and, in particular, preventive medication even for young children to slow progression of aortic dilation. The goal of this treatment strategy is to slow the progression of aortic dilation and prevent any damage to heart valves by eliminating heart arrhythmias, minimizing the heart rate, and lowering the person&#x27;s blood pressure.

===Physical activity===
The American Heart Association made the following recommendations for people with Marfan syndrome with no or mild aortic dilation:
* Probably permissible activities: bowling, golf, skating (but not ice hockey), snorkeling, brisk walking, treadmill, stationary biking, modest hiking, and tennis (doubles and singles).
* Intermediate risk: basketball (both full- and half-court), racquetball, squash, running (sprinting and jogging), skiing (downhill and cross-country), soccer, touch (flag) football, baseball, softball, biking, lap swimming, motorcycling, and horseback riding.
* High risk: bodybuilding, weightlifting (non-free and free weights), ice hockey, rock climbing, windsurfing, surfing, and scuba diving.

===Medication===
Management often includes the use of beta blockers such as propranolol or if not tolerated calcium channel blockers or ACE inhibitors. Beta blockers are used to reduce the stress exerted on the aorta and to decrease aortic dilation.

===Surgery===
If the dilation of the aorta progresses to a significant-diameter aneurysm, causes a dissection or a rupture, or leads to failure of the aortic or other valve, then surgery (possibly a composite aortic valve graft or valve-sparing aortic root replacement) becomes necessary. Although aortic graft surgery (or any vascular surgery) is a serious undertaking it is generally successful if undertaken on an elective basis. Surgery in the setting of acute aortic dissection or rupture is considerably more problematic. Elective aortic valve/graft surgery is usually considered when aortic root diameter reaches , but each case needs to be specifically evaluated by a qualified cardiologist. New valve-sparing surgical techniques are becoming more common. As people with Marfan syndrome live longer, other vascular repairs are becoming more common, e.g., repairs of descending thoracic aortic aneurysms and aneurysms of vessels other than the aorta.

The skeletal and ocular manifestations of Marfan syndrome can also be serious, although not life-threatening. These symptoms are usually treated in an appropriate manner for the condition, such as with pain medications or muscle relaxants. Because Marfan syndrome may cause asymptomatic spinal abnormalities, any spinal surgery contemplated on a person Marfan should only follow detailed imaging and careful surgical planning, regardless of the indication for surgery. The ocular complications of MFS can often be treated with surgery. Ectopia lentis can be treated, as artificial lenses can be surgically implanted. In addition, surgery can address glaucoma and cataracts.

Treatment of a spontaneous pneumothorax is dependent on the volume of air in the pleural space and the natural progression of the individual&#x27;s condition. A small pneumothorax might resolve without active treatment in one to two weeks. Recurrent pneumothoraces might require chest surgery. Moderately sized pneumothoraces might need chest drain management for several days in a hospital. Large pneumothoraces are likely to be medical emergencies requiring emergency decompression.

As an alternative approach, custom-built supports for the aortic root are also being used. As of 2020 this procedure has been used in over 300 people with the first case occurring in 2004.

===Pregnancy===
During pregnancy, even in the absence of preconception cardiovascular abnormality, women with Marfan syndrome are at significant risk of aortic dissection, which is often fatal even when rapidly treated. Women with Marfan syndrome, then, should receive a thorough assessment prior to conception, and echocardiography should be performed every six to 10 weeks during pregnancy, to assess the aortic root diameter. For most women, safe vaginal delivery is possible.

Prenatal testing can be performed in females with Marfan syndrome to determine if the condition has been inherited in their child. At 10 to 12 weeks of pregnancy, examining a piece of placental tissue through a test called chorionic villus sampling can be performed to make a diagnosis. Another prenatal test can be performed called amniocentesis at 16 to 18 weeks of pregnancy.

Marfan syndrome is expressed dominantly. This means a child with one parent a bearer of the gene has a 50% probability of getting the syndrome. In 1996, the first preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) therapy for Marfan was conducted; in essence PGT means conducting a genetic test on early-stage IVF embryo cells and discarding those embryos affected by the Marfan mutation.

==Prognosis==
Prior to modern cardiovascular surgical techniques and medications such as losartan, and metoprolol, the prognosis of those with Marfan syndrome was not good: a range of untreatable cardiovascular issues was common. Lifespan was reduced by at least a third, and many died in their teens and twenties due to cardiovascular problems. Today, cardiovascular symptoms of Marfan syndrome are still the most significant issues in diagnosis and management of the disease, but adequate prophylactic monitoring and prophylactic therapy offers something approaching a normal lifespan, and more manifestations of the disease are being discovered as more patients live longer. Women with Marfan syndrome live longer than men.

==Epidemiology==
Marfan syndrome affects males and females equally, and the mutation shows no ethnic or geographical bias. Estimates indicate about 1 in 5,000 to 10,000 individuals have Marfan syndrome.

==History==
Marfan syndrome is named after Antoine Marfan, the French pediatrician who first described the condition in 1896 after noticing striking features in a five-year-old girl. The gene linked to the disease was first identified by Francesco Ramirez at the Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City in 1991.

==Famous patients==
Notable people who have or had Marfan syndrome include:
* Isaiah Austin
* Javier Botet
* Austin Carlile
* Bradford Cox
* Euell Gibbons
* Flo Hyman
* Jonathan Jeanne
* Peter Mayhew
* Vincent Schiavelli
* Troye Sivan
* John Tavener
* Chris Turner

Other historical figures and celebrities have appeared on lists of people with Marfan syndrome, but from case to case the evidence is speculative, questionable, or refuted.

* Akhenaten; artistic depictions show many physical characteristics of people with Marfan, such as elongated skull and larger pelvis with enlarged thighs and spindly calves. Most Egyptologists as of 2021 argue that Akhenaten&#x27;s portrayals are not the results of a genetic or medical condition, but rather should be interpreted as stylized portrayals influenced by Atenism.
* Osama bin Laden; rumors of Marfan syndrome deemed &quot;likely false&quot; by journalists
* Robert Johnson; speculative
* Jonathan Larson; speculative
* Abraham Lincoln; disputed speculative diagnosis based on his physical characteristics and family history
* Niccolò Paganini; speculative
* Michael Phelps; disputed by Phelps
* Sergei Rachmaninoff; disputed: &quot;Rachmaninov did not clearly exhibit any of the other clinical characteristics typical of Marfan&#x27;s. (...) Nor did he express any of the clinical effects of a Marfan-related syndrome&quot;.
* Joey Ramone; speculative
* Tutankhamen; did not have Marfan syndrome

<text>In economics, utility is a measure of a certain person&#x27;s satisfaction from a certain state of the world. Over time, the term has been used with at least two meanings.

* In a normative context, utility refers to a goal or objective that we wish to maximize, i.e., an objective function. This kind of utility bears a closer resemblance to the original utilitarian concept, developed by moral philosophers such as Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill.
* In a descriptive context, the term refers to an &quot;apparent&quot; objective function; such a function is revealed by a person&#x27;s behavior, and specifically by their preferences over lotteries.

The relationship between these two kinds of utility functions has been a source of controversy among both economists and ethicists, with most maintaining that the two are distinct but generally related.

== Utility function ==
Consider a set of alternatives among which a person has a preference ordering. A utility function represents that ordering if it is possible to assign a real number to each alternative in such a manner that &quot;alternative a&quot; is assigned a number greater than &quot;alternative b&quot; if and only if the individual prefers &quot;alternative a&quot; to &quot;alternative b&quot;. In this situation, someone who selects the most preferred alternative must also choose one that maximizes the associated utility function. 

Suppose James has utility function formula_1 such that formula_2 is the number of apples and formula_3 is the number of chocolates. Alternative A has formula_4 apples and formula_5 chocolates; alternative B has formula_6 apples and formula_7 chocolates. Putting the values formula_8 into the utility function yields formula_9 for alternative A and formula_10 for B, so James prefers alternative B. In general economic terms, a utility function ranks preferences concerning a set of goods and services.

Gérard Debreu derived the conditions required for a preference ordering to be representable by a utility function. For a finite set of alternatives, these require only that the preference ordering is complete (so the individual can determine which of any two alternatives is preferred or that they are indifferent), and that the preference order is transitive.

Suppose the set of alternatives is not finite (for example, even if the number of goods is finite, the quantity chosen can be any real number on an interval). In that case, a continuous utility function exists representing a consumer&#x27;s preferences if and only if the consumer&#x27;s preferences are complete, transitive, and continuous.

==Applications==

Utility can be represented through sets of indifference curve, which are level curves of the function itself and which plot the combination of commodities that an individual would accept to maintain a given level of satisfaction. Combining indifference curves with budget constraints allows for individual demand curves derivation.

A diagram of a general indifference curve is shown below (Figure 1). The vertical and horizontal axes represent an individual&#x27;s consumption of commodity Y and X respectively. All the combinations of commodity X and Y along the same indifference curve are regarded indifferently by individuals, which means all the combinations along an indifference curve result in the same utility value. 

Individual and social utility can be construed as the value of a utility function and a social welfare function, respectively. When coupled with production or commodity constraints, by some assumptions, these functions can be used to analyze Pareto efficiency, such as illustrated by Edgeworth boxes in contract curves. Such efficiency is a major concept in welfare economics.

==Preference==
While preferences are the conventional foundation of choice theory in microeconomics, it is often convenient to represent preferences with a utility function. Let &quot;X&quot; be the consumption set, the set of all mutually exclusive baskets the consumer could consume. The consumer&#x27;s utility function formula_11 ranks each possible outcome in the consumption set. If the consumer strictly prefers &quot;x&quot; to &quot;y&quot; or is indifferent between them, then formula_12.

For example, suppose a consumer&#x27;s consumption set is &quot;X&quot; = {nothing, 1 apple,1 orange, 1 apple and 1 orange, 2 apples, 2 oranges}, and his utility function is &quot;u&quot;(nothing) = 0, &quot;u&quot;(1 apple) = 1, &quot;u&quot;(1 orange) = 2, &quot;u&quot;(1 apple and 1 orange) = 5, &quot;u&quot;(2 apples) = 2 and &quot;u&quot;(2 oranges) = 4. Then this consumer prefers 1 orange to 1 apple but prefers one of each to 2 oranges.

In micro-economic models, there is usually a finite set of L commodities, and a consumer may consume an arbitrary amount of each commodity. This gives a consumption set of formula_13, and each package formula_14 is a vector containing the amounts of each commodity. For the example, there are two commodities: apples and oranges. If we say apples are the first commodity, and oranges the second, then the consumption set is formula_15 and &quot;u&quot;(0, 0) = 0, &quot;u&quot;(1, 0) = 1, &quot;u&quot;(0, 1) = 2, &quot;u&quot;(1, 1) = 5, &quot;u&quot;(2, 0) = 2, &quot;u&quot;(0, 2) = 4 as before. For &quot;u&quot; to be a utility function on &quot;X&quot;, however, it must be defined for every package in &quot;X&quot;, so now the function must be defined for fractional apples and oranges too. One function that would fit these numbers is formula_16

Preferences have three main properties:

* Completeness 

Assume an individual has two choices, A and B. By ranking the two choices, one and only one of the following relationships is true: an individual strictly prefers A (A &gt; B); an individual strictly prefers B (B&gt;A); an individual is indifferent between A and B (A = B).
Either &quot;a&quot; ≥ &quot;b&quot; OR &quot;b&quot; ≥ &quot;a&quot; (OR both) for all (&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;)

* Transitivity 

Individuals&#x27; preferences are consistent over bundles. If an individual prefers bundle A to bundle B and bundle B to bundle C, then it can be assumed that the individual prefers bundle A to bundle C.
(If &quot;a&quot; ≥ &quot;b&quot; and &quot;b&quot; ≥ &quot;c&quot;, then &quot;a&quot; ≥ &quot;c&quot; for all (&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;)).

* Non-satiation or monotonicity
If bundle A contains all the goods that a bundle B contains, but A also includes more of at least one good than B. The individual prefers A over B. If, for example, bundle A = {1 apple,2 oranges}, and bundle B = {1 apple,1 orange}, then A is preferred over B.

===Revealed preference===
It was recognized that utility could not be measured or observed directly, so instead economists devised a way to infer relative utilities from observed choice. These &#x27;revealed preferences&#x27;, as termed by Paul Samuelson, were revealed e.g. in people&#x27;s willingness to pay: 

Utility is assumed to be correlative to Desire or Want. It has been argued already that desires cannot be measured directly, but only indirectly, by the outward phenomena which they cause: and that in those cases with which economics is mainly concerned the measure is found by the price which a person is willing to pay for the fulfillment or satisfaction of his desire.

Utility functions, expressing utility as a function of the amounts of the various goods consumed, are treated as either &quot;cardinal&quot; or &quot;ordinal&quot;, depending on whether they are or are not interpreted as providing more information than simply the rank ordering of preferences among bundles of goods, such as information concerning the strength of preferences.

===Cardinal===
Cardinal utility states that the utilities obtained from consumption can be measured and ranked objectively and are representable by numbers. There are fundamental assumptions of cardinal utility. Economic agents should be able to rank different bundles of goods based on their preferences or utilities and sort different transitions between two bundles of goods.

A cardinal utility function can be transformed to another utility function by a positive linear transformation (multiplying by a positive number, and adding some other number); however, both utility functions represent the same preferences.

When cardinal utility is assumed, the magnitude of utility differences is treated as an ethically or behaviorally significant quantity. For example, suppose a cup of orange juice has utility of 120 &quot;utils&quot;, a cup of tea has a utility of 80 utils, and a cup of water has a utility of 40 utils. With cardinal utility, it can be concluded that the cup of orange juice is better than the cup of tea by the same amount by which the cup of tea is better than the cup of water. This means that if a person has a cup of tea, they would be willing to take any bet with a probability, p, greater than .5 of getting a cup of juice, with a risk of getting a cup of water equal to 1-p. One cannot conclude, however, that the cup of tea is two-thirds of the goodness of the cup of juice because this conclusion would depend not only on magnitudes of utility differences but also on the &quot;zero&quot; of utility. For example, if the &quot;zero&quot; of utility were located at -40, then a cup of orange juice would be 160 utils more than zero, a cup of tea 120 utils more than zero. Cardinal utility can be considered as the assumption that quantifiable characteristics, such as height, weight, temperature, etc can measure utility.

Neoclassical economics has largely retreated from using cardinal utility functions as the basis of economic behavior. A notable exception is in the context of analyzing choice with conditions of risk (see below).

Sometimes cardinal utility is used to aggregate utilities across persons, to create a social welfare function.

===Ordinal===
Instead of giving actual numbers over different bundles, ordinal utilities are only the rankings of utilities received from different bundles of goods or services. For example, ordinal utility could tell that having two ice creams provide a greater utility to individuals in comparison to one ice cream but could not tell exactly how much extra utility received by the individual. Ordinal utility, it does not require individuals to specify how much extra utility they received from the preferred bundle of goods or services in comparison to other bundles. They are only needed to tell which bundles they prefer. 

When ordinal utilities are used, differences in utils (values assumed by the utility function) are treated as ethically or behaviorally meaningless: the utility index encodes a full behavioral ordering between members of a choice set, but tells nothing about the related &quot;strength of preferences&quot;. For the above example, it would only be possible to say that juice is preferred to tea to water. Thus, ordinal utility utilizes comparisons, such as &quot;preferred to&quot;, &quot;no more&quot;, &quot;less than&quot;, etc.

If a function formula_17 is ordinal and non-negative, it is equivalent to the function formula_18, because taking the square is an increasing monotone (or monotonic) transformation. This means that the ordinal preference induced by these functions is the same (although they are two different functions). In contrast, if formula_17 is cardinal, it is not equivalent to formula_18.

===Examples===

In order to simplify calculations, various alternative assumptions have been made concerning details of human preferences, and these imply various alternative utility functions such as:

* CES (&quot;constant elasticity of substitution&quot;).
* Isoelastic utility
* Exponential utility
* Quasilinear utility
* Homothetic preferences
* Stone–Geary utility function
* Gorman polar form
** Greenwood–Hercowitz–Huffman preferences
** King–Plosser–Rebelo preferences
* Hyperbolic absolute risk aversion

Most utility functions used for modeling or theory are well-behaved. They are usually monotonic and quasi-concave. However, it is possible for rational preferences not to be representable by a utility function. An example is lexicographic preferences which are not continuous and cannot be represented by a continuous utility function.

== Marginal utility ==
Economists distinguish between total utility and marginal utility. Total utility is the utility of an alternative, an entire consumption bundle or situation in life. The rate of change of utility from changing the quantity of one good consumed is termed the marginal utility of that good. Marginal utility therefore measures the slope of the utility function with respect to the changes of one good. Marginal utility usually decreases with consumption of the good, the idea of &quot;diminishing marginal utility&quot;. In calculus notation, the marginal utility of good X is formula_21. When a good&#x27;s marginal utility is positive, additional consumption of it increases utility; if zero, the consumer is satiated and indifferent about consuming more; if negative, the consumer would pay to reduce his consumption. 

=== Law of diminishing marginal utility ===
Rational individuals only consume additional units of goods if it increases the marginal utility. However, the law of diminishing marginal utility means an additional unit consumed brings a lower marginal utility than that carried by the previous unit consumed. For example, drinking one bottle of water makes a thirsty person satisfied; as the consumption of water increases, he may feel begin to feel bad which causes the marginal utility to decrease to zero or even become negative. Furthermore, this is also used to analyze progressive taxes as the greater taxes can result in the loss of utility.

=== Marginal rate of substitution (MRS) ===
Marginal rate of substitution is the slope of the indifference curve, which measures how much an individual is willing to switch from one good to another. Using a mathematic equation, formula_22keeping &quot;U&quot;(&quot;x&quot;1,&quot;x&quot;2) constant. Thus, MRS is how much an individual is willing to pay for consuming a greater amount of &quot;x&quot;1. 

MRS is related to marginal utility. The relationship between marginal utility and MRS is:

: formula_23

==Expected utility==

Expected utility theory deals with the analysis of choices among risky projects with multiple (possibly multidimensional) outcomes.

The St. Petersburg paradox was first proposed by Nicholas Bernoulli in 1713 and solved by Daniel Bernoulli in 1738, although the Swiss mathematician Gabriel Cramer proposed taking the expectation of a square-root utility function of money in an 1728 letter to N. Bernoulli. D. Bernoulli argued that the paradox could be resolved if decision-makers displayed risk aversion and argued for a logarithmic cardinal utility function. (Analysis of international survey data during the 21st century has shown that insofar as utility represents happiness, as for utilitarianism, it is indeed proportional to log of income.)

The first important use of the expected utility theory was that of John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern, who used the assumption of expected utility maximization in their formulation of game theory.

In finding the probability-weighted average of the utility from each possible outcome:

:formula_24

===Von Neumann–Morgenstern===
Von Neumann and Morgenstern addressed situations in which the outcomes of choices are not known with certainty, but have probabilities associated with them.

A notation for a &quot;lottery&quot; is as follows: if options A and B have probability &quot;p&quot; and 1 − &quot;p&quot; in the lottery, we write it as a linear combination:
:formula_25

More generally, for a lottery with many possible options:

:formula_26

where formula_27.

By making some reasonable assumptions about the way choices behave, von Neumann and Morgenstern showed that if an agent can choose between the lotteries, then this agent has a utility function such that the desirability of an arbitrary lottery can be computed as a linear combination of the utilities of its parts, with the weights being their probabilities of occurring.

This is termed the &quot;expected utility theorem&quot;. The required assumptions are four axioms about the properties of the agent&#x27;s preference relation over &#x27;simple lotteries&#x27;, which are lotteries with just two options. Writing formula_28 to mean &#x27;A is weakly preferred to B&#x27; (&#x27;A is preferred at least as much as B&#x27;), the axioms are:

# completeness: For any two simple lotteries formula_29 and formula_30, either formula_31 or formula_32 (or both, in which case they are viewed as equally desirable).
# transitivity: for any three lotteries formula_33, if formula_31 and formula_35, then formula_36.
# convexity/continuity (Archimedean property): If formula_37, then there is a formula_38 between 0 and 1 such that the lottery formula_39 is equally desirable as formula_30.
# independence: for any three lotteries formula_33 and any probability &quot;p&quot;, formula_42 if and only if formula_43. Intuitively, if the lottery formed by the probabilistic combination of formula_29 and formula_45 is no more preferable than the lottery formed by the same probabilistic combination of formula_30 and formula_47 then and only then formula_42.

Axioms 3 and 4 enable us to decide about the relative utilities of two assets or lotteries.

In more formal language: A von Neumann–Morgenstern utility function is a function from choices to the real numbers:
:formula_11
which assigns a real number to every outcome in a way that represents the agent&#x27;s preferences over simple lotteries. Using the four assumptions mentioned above, the agent will prefer a lottery formula_50 to a lottery formula_51 if and only if, for the utility function characterizing that agent, the expected utility of formula_50 is greater than the expected utility of formula_51:
:formula_54.

Of all the axioms, independence is the most often discarded. A variety of generalized expected utility theories have arisen, most of which omit or relax the independence axiom.

==Indirect utility==
An indirect utility function gives the optimal attainable value of a given utility function, which depends on the prices of the goods and the income or wealth level that the individual possesses.

===Money===

One use of the indirect utility concept is the notion of the utility of money. The (indirect) utility function for money is a nonlinear function that is bounded and asymmetric about the origin. The utility function is concave in the positive region, representing the phenomenon of diminishing marginal utility. The boundedness represents the fact that beyond a certain amount money ceases being useful at all, as the size of any economy at that time is itself bounded. The asymmetry about the origin represents the fact that gaining and losing money can have radically different implications both for individuals and businesses. The non-linearity of the utility function for money has profound implications in decision-making processes: in situations where outcomes of choices influence utility by gains or losses of money, which are the norm for most business settings, the optimal choice for a given decision depends on the possible outcomes of all other decisions in the same time-period.

== Budget constraints ==
Individuals&#x27; consumptions are constrained by their budget allowance. The graph of budget line is a linear, downward-sloping line between X and Y axes. All the bundles of consumption under the budget line allow individuals to consume without using the whole budget as the total budget is greater than the total cost of bundles (Figure 2). If only considers prices and quantities of two goods in one bundle, a budget constraint could be formulated as formula_55, where formula_56 and formula_57 are prices of the two goods, formula_58 and formula_59 are quantities of the two goods.
: formula_60

=== Constrained utility optimisation ===
Rational consumers wish to maximise their utility. However, as they have budget constraints, a change of price would affect the quantity of demand. There are two factors could explain this situation:

* Purchasing power. Individuals obtain greater purchasing power when the price of a good decreases. The reduction of the price allows individuals to increase their savings so they could afford to buy other products.
* Substitution effect. If the price of good A decreases, then the good becomes relatively cheaper with respect to its substitutes. Thus, individuals would consume more of good A as the utility would increase by doing so.

==Discussion and criticism==
Cambridge economist Joan Robinson famously criticized utility for being a circular concept: &quot;Utility is the quality in commodities that makes individuals want to buy them, and the fact that individuals want to buy commodities shows that they have utility&quot;. Robinson also stated that because the theory assumes that preferences are fixed this means that utility is not a testable assumption. This is so because if we observe changes of peoples&#x27; behavior in relation to a change in prices or a change in budget constraint we can never be sure to what extent the change in behavior was due to the change of price or budget constraint and how much was due to a change of preference. This criticism is similar to that of the philosopher Hans Albert who argued that the &quot;ceteris paribus&quot; (all else equal) conditions on which the marginalist theory of demand rested rendered the theory itself a meaningless tautology, incapable of being tested experimentally. In essence, a curve of demand and supply (a theoretical line of quantity of a product which would have been offered or requested for given price) is purely ontological and could never have been demonstrated empirically.

Other questions of what arguments ought to be included in a utility function are difficult to answer, yet seem necessary to understanding utility. Whether people gain utility from coherence of wants, beliefs or a sense of duty is important to understanding their behavior in the utility organon. Likewise, choosing between alternatives is itself a process of determining what to consider as alternatives, a question of choice within uncertainty.

An evolutionary psychology theory is that utility may be better considered as due to preferences that maximized evolutionary fitness in the ancestral environment but not necessarily in the current one.

== Measuring utility functions ==
There are many empirical works trying to estimate the form of utility functions of agents with respect to money.

<text>Soylent Green is a 1973 American dystopian thriller film directed by Richard Fleischer, and starring Charlton Heston, Leigh Taylor-Young, and Edward G. Robinson in his final film role. It is loosely based on the 1966 science-fiction novel &quot;Make Room! Make Room!&quot; by Harry Harrison, with a plot that combines elements of science fiction and a police procedural. The story follows a murder investigation in a dystopian future of dying oceans and year-round humidity caused by the greenhouse effect, with the resulting pollution, depleted resources, poverty, and overpopulation.

The film was released on April 19, 1973 by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and received mostly favorable reviews from critics, while earning $3.6 million at the box office. In 1973, it won the Nebula Award for Best Dramatic Presentation and the Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film.

==Plot==
By 2022, the cumulative effects of overpopulation, global warming, and pollution have caused ecocide, leading to severe worldwide shortages of food, water, and housing, bringing human civilization to the brink of collapse. New York City has a population of 40 million, and only the elite can afford spacious apartments, clean water, and natural food in walled-off communities patrolled by armed guards. Their homes are fortified, with moats, security systems, and bodyguards for their tenants. Usually, they include concubines (who are referred to as &quot;furniture&quot; and have no human rights and are passed from one apartment owner to the next). Meanwhile, the majority live in squalor, haul water from communal spigots, and eat highly processed food wafers made by the Soylent Corporation — a large food processing firm. Their mainstay products, Soylent Red and Soylent Yellow, are a staple food, and the latest product, a new, more nutritious, and flavorful wafer derived from plankton, Soylent Green, is introduced to the populace.

NYPD Detective Robert Thorn lives in a cramped apartment with his aged co-worker and friend Sol Roth, a brilliant former college professor and police researcher (referred to as a &quot;Book&quot;), who helps him with his cases. Thorn is called to investigate the murder of the wealthy and influential William R. Simonson, a member of the Soylent Corporation&#x27;s board, which he suspects was an assassination. With the help of Simonson&#x27;s concubine Shirl, his investigation leads to a priest whom Simonson had visited shortly before his death. Because of the sanctity of the confessional, the visibly exhausted priest can only hint to Thorn at the contents of the confession. Soon after, the priest is murdered in the confessional by Fielding, Simonson&#x27;s former bodyguard. Under the direction of Governor Henry C. Santini, Thorn&#x27;s superiors order him to end the investigation. Still, he continues, fearing losing his job if he files a false report. He soon becomes aware that an unknown stalker is following him. As Thorn tries to control a violent mob during a Soylent Green shortage riot, he is attacked by the assassin who killed Simonson. The killer shoots three times at Thorn but misses, accidentally striking several innocent bystanders in the crowd. Thorn manages to locate the killer and throw him to the ground. The killer shoots Thorn in the leg before being crushed by the hydraulic shovel of a police riot-control vehicle, which continually scoops up shovelfuls of people in the crowd and swivels to dump them for disposal.

In researching the case for Thorn, Roth brings two volumes of the &quot;Soylent Oceanographic Survey Report, 2015–2019&quot;, taken by Thorn from Simonson&#x27;s apartment, to the team of other &quot;Books&quot; (former professors and judges turned researchers) at the &quot;Supreme Exchange&quot;. The &quot;Books&quot; quickly conclude from the oceanographic reports that the oceans are dying and can not actually produce the plankton from which Soylent Green is allegedly made, thus revealing that the ingredients in Soylent Green are, in fact, human bodies. This information confirms to Roth that Simonson&#x27;s murder was ordered by his fellow Soylent Corporation board members, who knew Simonson was increasingly troubled by this truth and feared he might disclose it to the public.

Shaken by the truth, Roth decides to &quot;return to the home of God&quot; and seeks assisted suicide at a government clinic. Thorn discovers this and rushes to stop him, but he arrives too late. Before dying, Roth whispers his discovery to Thorn, who is horrified. Thorn moves to uncover proof of crimes against humanity and to bring it to the attention of the Supreme Exchange so the case can be brought to the Council of Nations to take action.

Thorn secretly boards a waste truck transporting human bodies from the euthanasia center to a waste-disposal plant, where he witnesses human corpses instead being processed and turned into Soylent Green. Thorn is discovered, but he escapes. As he returns to the Supreme Exchange, he is ambushed by Fielding and his men. Finding refuge in the church where Simonson confessed, Thorn kills his attackers but is seriously wounded in a gunfight. As paramedics tend to Thorn, he urges his commanding officer, Chief Hatcher, to spread the truth. Thorn shouts to the surrounding crowd, &quot;Soylent Green is people!&quot;

==Production==

The screenplay was based on Harry Harrison&#x27;s novel &quot;Make Room! Make Room!&quot; (1966), which was set in the year 1999 with the theme of overpopulation and overuse of resources leading to increasing poverty, food shortages, and social disorder. Harrison was contractually denied control over the screenplay and was not told during negotiations that Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was buying the film rights. He discussed the adaptation in &quot;Omni&#x27;s Screen Flights/Screen Fantasies&quot; (1984), noting the &quot;murder and chase sequences [and] the &#x27;furniture&#x27; girls are not what the film is about and are completely irrelevant&quot; and answered his own question, &quot;Am I pleased with the film? I would say 50 percent&quot;.

While the book refers to &quot;soylent steaks&quot; (made from soy and lentil), it makes no reference to &quot;Soylent Green&quot;, the processed food rations depicted in the film. The book&#x27;s title was not used for the movie on grounds that it might have confused audiences into thinking it was a big-screen version of &quot;Make Room for Daddy&quot;.

This was the 101st and final film in which Edward G. Robinson appeared; he died of bladder cancer on January 26, 1973, two months after the completion of filming. In his book &quot;The Actor&#x27;s Life: Journal 1956–1976&quot;, Heston wrote, &quot;He knew while we were shooting, though we did not, that he was terminally ill. He never missed an hour of work, nor was late to a call. He never was less than the consummate professional he had been all his life. I&#x27;m still haunted, though, by the knowledge that the very last scene he played in the picture, which he knew was the last day&#x27;s acting he would ever do, was his death scene. I know why I was so overwhelmingly moved playing it with him&quot;. Robinson had previously worked with Heston in &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; (1956) and the make-up tests for &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; (1968).

The film&#x27;s opening sequence, depicting America becoming more crowded with a series of archive photographs set to music, was created by filmmaker Charles Braverman. The &quot;going home&quot; score in Roth&#x27;s death scene was conducted by Gerald Fried and consists of the main themes from Symphony No. 6 (&quot;Pathétique&quot;) by Tchaikovsky, Symphony No. 6 (&quot;Pastoral&quot;) by Beethoven and Peer Gynt (&quot;Morning Mood&quot; and &quot;Åse&#x27;s Death&quot;) by Edvard Grieg. A custom cabinet unit of the early arcade game &quot;Computer Space&quot; was used in &quot;Soylent Green&quot; and is considered the first appearance of a video game in a film.

==Critical response==

The film was released on April 19, 1973, and met with mixed reactions from critics. &quot;Time&quot; called it &quot;intermittently interesting&quot;, noting that &quot;Heston forsak[es] his granite stoicism for once&quot; and asserting the film &quot;will be most remembered for the last appearance of Edward G. Robinson... In a rueful irony, his death scene, in which he is hygienically dispatched with the help of piped-in light classical music and movies of rich fields flashed before him on a towering screen, is the best in the film&quot;. &quot;New York Times&quot; critic A. H. Weiler wrote, &quot;&quot;Soylent Green&quot; projects essentially simple, muscular melodrama a good deal more effectively than it does the potential of man&#x27;s seemingly witless destruction of the Earth&#x27;s resources&quot;; Weiler concludes &quot;Richard Fleischer&#x27;s direction stresses action, not nuances of meaning or characterization. Mr. Robinson is pitiably natural as the realistic, sensitive oldster facing the futility of living in dying surroundings. But Mr. Heston is simply a rough cop chasing standard bad guys. Their 21st-century New York occasionally is frightening but it is rarely convincingly real&quot;.

Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four, calling it &quot;a good, solid science-fiction movie, and a little more&quot;. Gene Siskel gave the film one-and-a-half stars out of four and called it &quot;a silly detective yarn, full of juvenile Hollywood images. Wait &#x27;til you see the giant snow shovel scoop the police use to round up rowdies. You may never stop laughing&quot;. Arthur D. Murphy of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;The somewhat plausible and proximate horrors in the story of &#x27;Soylent Green&#x27; carry the Russell Thacher-Walter Seltzer production over its awkward spots to the status of a good futuristic exploitation film&quot;. Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;a clever, rough, modestly budgeted but imaginative work&quot;. Penelope Gilliatt of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; was negative, writing, &quot;This pompously prophetic thing of a film hasn&#x27;t a brain in its beanbag. Where is democracy? Where is the popular vote? Where is women&#x27;s lib? Where are the uprising poor, who would have suspected what was happening in a moment?&quot;

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 71%, based on 41 reviews, with an average rating of 6.30/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;While admittedly melodramatic and uneven in spots, &quot;Soylent Green&quot; ultimately succeeds with its dark, plausible vision of a dystopian future.&quot;

<doc id="45488" wikidata="Q258830" url="?curid=45488" title="The Last Laugh (1924 film)">
<text>The Last Laugh (, ) is a 1924 German silent film directed by German director F. W. Murnau from a screenplay written by Carl Mayer. The film stars Emil Jannings and Maly Delschaft.

Stephen Brockmann summarized the film&#x27;s plot as, &quot;a nameless hotel doorman loses his job&quot;. It is a cinematic example of the &quot;Kammerspielfilm&quot; or &quot;chamber-drama&quot; genre, which follows the style of short, sparse plays of lower middle-class life that emphasized the psychology of the characters rather than the sets and action. The genre tried to avoid the intertitles (title cards) of spoken dialogue or description that characterize most silent films, in the belief that the visuals themselves should carry most of the meaning.

The film was voted number 11 on the prestigious Brussels 12 list at the 1958 World Expo. In 1955, the film was remade starring Hans Albers.

==Plot==
Jannings&#x27; character is a doorman for a famous hotel, who takes great pride in his work and position. His uncaring manager decides that the doorman is getting too old and feeble to present the image of the hotel, and so demotes him to a less demanding job, of washroom attendant. He tries to conceal his demotion from his friends and family but, to his shame, he is discovered. His friends and neighbors, thinking he has lied to them all along about his prestigious job, taunt him mercilessly while his family rejects him out of shame. The doorman, shocked and in incredible grief, returns to the hotel to sleep in the washroom where he works. The only person to be kind towards him is the night watchman, who covers him with his coat as he falls asleep.

Following this comes the film&#x27;s only title card, which says: &quot;Here our story should really end, for in actual life, the forlorn old man would have little to look forward to but death. The author took pity on him, however, and provided quite an improbable epilogue.&quot;

At the end, the audience reads in the newspaper that the doorman inherited a fortune from an eccentric millionaire named A. G. Monen, a patron who died in his arms in the hotel washroom. The doorman returns to the hotel, where he happily dines lavishly with the night watchman who showed him kindness. On their way to his magnificent horse-drawn carriage, the doorman gives tips to all the service personnel from the hotel, who quickly line up along his way. In the final scene of the film, when both the doorman and the night watchman are in the carriage, a beggar asks the doorman for some money. The doorman invites the beggar to the carriage and even gives a tip to the new doorman, who is now in charge of bringing the guests inside.

==Production==
Director F. W. Murnau was at the height of his film career in Germany and had high ambitions for his first film with UFA. He stated that &quot;All our efforts must be directed towards abstracting everything that isn&#x27;t the true domain of the cinema. Everything that is trivial and acquired from other sources, all the tricks, devices and cliches inherited from the stage and from books.&quot; Murnau called screenwriter Carl Mayer someone who worked in &quot;the true domain of the cinema&quot; and agreed to make &quot;Der letzte Mann&quot; after Mayer and film director Lupu Pick fought and Pick left the film. The film famously uses no intertitles, which had previously been done by Mayer and Pick on &quot;Scherben&quot; and &quot;Sylvester&quot; several years earlier, as well as by director Arthur Robison in the film &quot;Schatten&quot; in 1923.

The film was shot entirely at the UFA Studios. Murnau and cinematographer Karl Freund used elaborate camera movements for the film, a technique later called &quot;entfesselte Kamera&quot; (unchained camera). In one scene a camera was strapped to Freund&#x27;s chest as he rode a bicycle into an elevator and onto the street below. In another scene a camera is sent down a wire from a window to the street below, and later reversed in editing. French filmmaker Marcel Carné later said that &quot;The camera...glides, rises, zooms or weaves where the story takes it. It is no longer fixed, but takes part in the action and becomes a character in the drama.&quot; Years later Karl Freund dismissed Murnau&#x27;s contributions to the films that they made together, claiming that Murnau had no interest in lighting and never looked through the camera, and that &quot;Carl Mayer used to take much more interest than he did in framing.&quot; The film&#x27;s set designers Robert Herlth and Walter Röhrig denied this statement and defended Murnau. Murnau described the film&#x27;s cinematography as being &quot;on account of the way... [objects] were placed or photographed, their image is a visual drama. In their relationship with other objects or with the characters, they are units in the symphony of the film.&quot;

Murnau noted that the story was absurd on the grounds that &quot;everyone knows that a washroom attendant makes more than a doorman.&quot; The signs in the film are written in an imaginary language that Alfred Hitchcock took as Esperanto.

There were three different versions of the film, for German, American and international audiences. While European markets retained the meaning of the original German title (&quot;The Last Man&quot;) on its initial release, the English-speaking countries opted for the more optimistic &quot;Laugh&quot; title.

== Film and artistic technique ==

=== Camera movement ===
The use of camera movement, dramatic camera angles, distorted shots, and changing focus contributed to creating new perspectives and impressions for viewers. The film&#x27;s use of montage was also pioneering: Murnau&#x27;s technique was to use a smooth and rapid cutting in the initial scenes followed by jarred cutting in the scenes where the doorman becomes humiliated. A combination of distortion and overlapping of images is used in the scene where the doorman is drunk to portray his subjective experience. The camera work provides enhancements to Jannings&#x27;s creative use of body language by using close ups and camera angles that encourage the viewer to see the events from the doorman&#x27;s perspective. This type of camera movement is called affective movement. This term is used for camera movement that is based on the character&#x27;s emotions, whereas camera movement that is based on the character&#x27;s actions is referred to as action movement. In order for the viewer to be drawn further into the film, the camera must successfully correspond its movement to how the viewer would act in that specific scenario. In the scene where he is drunk, the unchained camera freely maneuvers and circles throughout the room, as if the viewer were drunk.

Another example of how the unchained camera technique brings the viewer into the film is the moment when the doorman learns that he has been replaced by a new, younger doorman. In this scene, with the help of a close-up and zoom-in of his face, the viewer now pays even closer attention to his facial expressions. This affective camera movement is effective for the viewer to identify and relate more with the character&#x27;s inner emotional condition. By creating a connection between the viewer and the character with the unchained camera technique, the viewer becomes integrated into the film. This demonstrated the potential that camera movement brought to filmmaking. These aspects of the film come together to the term subjective movement, in which the viewer interprets camera movement subjectively, whereas they interpret the character&#x27;s actions more objectively in action movement. The unchained camera captures the true essence of subjective movement and thus creates more possibilities in filmmaking.

=== Mise-en-scène ===
Decorations and presentation of contrasting environments were also significant in creating the impression. The contrast between the rich environment of the Atlantic hotel and the lower class housing, gives an impression of a realistic presentation of situations. The decorators for &quot;Der letzte Mann&quot; were Robert Herlth and Walter Röhrig. Another use of contrast was the illustration of the respect and essentially the power of the uniform combined with the ridicule and disregard which the doorman experienced after his demotion.

The power of the uniform in the German culture was analyzed in a scholarly article by Jon Hughes. Wearing of a uniform appears to enhance masculinity of the person and provides some institutional power, as the wearer identifies himself/herself with the corresponding institution. Therefore, a uniform provides personal confidence and the respect of others, as illustrated in &quot;Der letzte Mann&quot;. The quick ascension of the Nazis to power could also be attributed to their widespread use of uniforms. The film &quot;Der letzte Mann&quot; illustrates clearly this effect of self-confidence and personal/institutional power as connected to wearing of a decorated uniform.

=== Intertitles ===
The use of intertitles was common during the silent film era. The first academy awards in 1929 included an award for &quot;Best Writing – Title Cards,&quot; as they were usually a key element of a film, and were thought to be necessary in conveying a film&#x27;s narrative to audiences. &quot;Der letzte Mann&quot; was unusual in its use of only one title card throughout the film.

The film&#x27;s lack of intertitles reflects Murnau&#x27;s view that they were &quot;an obstructive presence in film&quot; that pointed to film&#x27;s reliance on other art forms. In an interview with journalist Eduard Jawitz, Murnau stated that film was still a &quot;young&quot; art that did &quot;not yet fully appreciate its own forms of expression and its material&quot; which he explained was the reason that most films relied on intertitles to convey meaning. This perspective led Murnau to experiment with different visual strategies to communicate the film&#x27;s narrative, like subjective camera movement and mise-en-scène.

The singular title card in &quot;Der letzte Mann&quot; is used to introduce the film&#x27;s epilogue. The title card explains that while the narrative would realistically end with the doorman remaining in his hopeless situation, the film&#x27;s writer &quot;took pity on him&quot; and created an &quot;improbable&quot; ending. This intertitle introduces a tonally different scene where the film jumps forward in time, showing the now wealthy doorman dining in the hotel. This ending has received criticism for its convenience, with some critics questioning whether the intertitle was an apologetic interjection from Murnau about this conclusion.

== Historical context ==
The film was made in 1924, at the time of the Weimar Republic. The war reparation payments imposed on Germany caused skyrocketing inflation, economic collapse, food shortages, poverty, malnutrition and hunger. Petit bourgeois Germans were looking for some hope for improvement of their economic situation. Even such an unrealistic possibility as inheriting money from somebody else brought some hope. This need for hope and the director&#x27;s knowledge of the expectations of the general public were the reasons that &quot;Der letzte Mann&quot; had a happy, although unrealistic, epilogue.

German cinema began co-operative ventures with Hollywood producers, which led to mutual influence and in 1926 the German producers signed a contract with Hollywood, which started a migration of German actors and directors to Hollywood. The effect was similar to the later-observed brain drain of scientists from all over the world to the United States.

One of the results of this early cooperation was that director Alfred Hitchcock went to Berlin and started working with Friedrich Murnau. Hitchcock was very impressed with Murnau&#x27;s unchained camera techniques and stated that his cooperation with Murnau was an &quot;enormously productive experience&quot; and that &quot;Der letzte Mann&quot; was an &quot;almost perfect film&quot;. The cooperation with Murnau was for Hitchcock essentially a &quot;key reference point&quot;. Hitchcock also expressed his appreciation for Murnau&#x27;s camera-points-of-view and the subjective shots which provided &quot;audience identification&quot; with the main character. The rating of &quot;Der letzte Mann&quot; in Hollywood was very high: &quot;Hollywood simply raved about &quot;The Last Laugh&quot;,&quot; noted Jan Horak.

==Reception and legacy==
The film was a major critical and financial success and allowed Murnau to make two big budget films shortly afterwards. Critics praised the film&#x27;s style and artistic camera movements. Film critic Paul Rotha said that it &quot;definitely established the film as an independent medium of expression... Everything that had to be said... was said entirely through the camera...&quot;The Last Laugh&quot; was cine-fiction in its purest form; exemplary of the rhythmic composition proper to the film.&quot; Years later C. A. Lejeune called it &quot;probably the least sensational and certainly the most important of Murnau&#x27;s films. It gave the camera a new dominion, a new freedom... It influenced the future of motion picture photography... all over the world, and without suggesting any revolution in method, without storming critical opinion as &quot;Caligari&quot; had done, it turned technical attention towards experiment, and stimulated... a new kind of camera-thinking with a definite narrative end. Lotte Eisner praised its &quot;opalescent surfaces streaming with reflections, rain, or light: car windows, the glazed leaves of the revolving door reflecting the silhouette of the doorman dressed in a gleaming black waterproof, the dark mass of houses with lighted windows, wet pavements and shimmering puddles... His camera captures the filtered half-light falling from the street lamps... it seizes railings through basement windows.&quot;

The film&#x27;s story and content were also praised by critics, with Eisner stating that it &quot;is pre-eminently a German tragedy, and can only be understood in a country where uniform is king, not to say god. A non-German mind will have difficulty in comprehending all its tragic implications.&quot; Siegfried Kracauer pointed out that &quot;all the tenants, in particular the female ones... [revere the uniform] as a symbol of supreme authority and are happy to be allowed to revere it.&quot;

In 2000, Roger Ebert included it among his list of Great Movies. 

==Home media==
Kino International released a reconstruction of the German version and an &quot;unrestored export version&quot; in 2008 (the latter apparently the version used by Kino in previous releases). A bonus 40-minute documentary compares the German, American and international versions.

<doc id="45491" wikidata="Q890874" url="?curid=45491" title="Life After Life (Moody book)">
<text>Life After Life is a 1975 book written by psychiatrist Raymond Moody. It is a report on a qualitative study in which Moody interviewed 150 people who had undergone near-death experiences (NDEs). The book presents the author&#x27;s composite account of what it is like to die, supplemented with individual accounts. On the basis of his collection of cases, Moody identified a common set of elements in NDEs:

*(a) an overwhelming feeling of peace and well-being, including freedom from pain.
*(b) the impression of being located outside one&#x27;s physical body.
*(c) floating or drifting through darkness, sometimes described as a tunnel.
*(d) becoming aware of a golden light.
*(e) encountering and perhaps communicating with a &quot;being of light&quot;.
*(f) having a rapid succession of visual images of one&#x27;s past.
*(g) experiencing another world of much beauty.
&quot;Life After Life&quot; sold more than 13 million copies, was translated into a dozen foreign languages and became an international best seller, which made the subject of NDEs popular and opened the way for many other studies.

==Reception==
Moody&#x27;s alleged evidence for an afterlife was heavily criticized as flawed, both logically and empirically. The psychologist and skeptic James Alcock has noted that &quot;[Moody] appears to ignore a great deal of the scientific literature dealing with hallucinatory experiences in general, just as he quickly glosses over the very real limitations of his research method.&quot;

The philosopher and skeptic Paul Kurtz has written that Moody&#x27;s evidence for the NDE is based on personal interviews and anecdotal accounts and there has been no statistical analyses of his data. According to Kurtz, &quot;there is no reliable evidence that people who report such experiences have died and returned, or that consciousness exists separate from the brain or body.&quot;

<text>I Am Legend is a 1954 post-apocalyptic horror novel by American writer Richard Matheson that was influential in the modern development of zombie and vampire literature and in popularizing the concept of a worldwide apocalypse due to disease. The novel was a success and was adapted into the films &quot;The Last Man on Earth&quot; (1964), &quot;The Omega Man&quot; (1971), and &quot;I Am Legend&quot; (2007). It was also an inspiration for George A. Romero&#x27;s &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; (1968).

==Plot==
Set on Cimarron Street in 1976 Gardena, California, after an apocalyptic war that ravages the land with weekly dust storms, the novel details the life of Robert Neville in the months and eventually years after the outbreak of a pandemic that has killed the rest of the human population and turned infected survivors into &quot;vampires&quot;. The vampires conform remarkably to their stereotypes in fiction and folklore: they are blood-sucking, pale-skinned, and nocturnal, though otherwise indistinguishable from normal humans. Neville, possibly the sole survivor of the pandemic, barricades himself indoors nightly as vampires violently swarm his house. He is further protected by the traditional vampire repellents of garlic, mirrors, and crucifixes. During the day, the vampires are inactive, allowing Neville to drive around stabbing them with wooden stakes (since they seem impervious to his gun’s bullets), which causes them to liquefy instantly, and scavenging for supplies. Occasional flashbacks reveal the horrors of how the disease claimed the lives of his wife and daughter.

Suffering from extreme isolation, depression, and alcoholism, Neville determines there must be some scientific reasons behind the vampires&#x27; origins, behaviors, and oddly specific aversions, so he gradually researches at his local library, discovering that the root of the disease is probably a &quot;Bacillus&quot; strain of bacteria capable of infecting both living and deceased (&quot;undead&quot;) hosts. His experiments with microscopes also reveal that the bacteria are deathly sensitive to garlic and sunlight. After he painstakingly attempts to win the trust of a stray sickly dog that dies after only a week, Neville, heartbroken, commits himself even more vigorously to his studies. Soon he experiments directly on incapacitated vampires, which leads to a new theory that vampires are affected by mirrors and crosses because of &quot;hysterical blindness&quot;, in which the infected now delusionally react as they believe they should when confronted with these items. Neville additionally discovers that exposing vampires to direct sunlight or inflicting wide oxygen-exposing wounds causes the bacteria to switch from being anaerobic symbionts to aerobic parasites, rapidly consuming their hosts when exposed to air and thus giving them the appearance of instantly liquefying. However, he discovers the bacteria also produce resilient &quot;body glue&quot; that instantaneously seals blunt or narrow wounds, explaining how the vampires are bulletproof. Lastly, he deduces now that there are in fact two differently-reacting types of vampires: conscious ones who are living with a worsening infection and undead ones who have died but been partly reanimated by the bacteria.

After three years, Neville suddenly sees a terrified woman named Ruth in broad daylight. The two cautiously gain each other&#x27;s trust and even share a romantic embrace. Neville explains some of his findings, including his theory that he developed immunity against the infection after being bitten by an infected vampire bat years ago. He prepares to test Ruth to determine if she is infected or immune, vowing to treat her if she is infected, but she knocks him unconscious. Once Neville comes to, he discovers a note from her confessing that she is indeed a vampire herself. Her note suggests that only the undead vampires are pathologically violent but not those, like her, who were alive at the time of infection and who still survive due to chance mutations. These living-infected have slowly overcome their disease and are gradually developing a new society and new medications. Ruth admits she was sent to spy on him by her comrades and that he was responsible for the deaths of many of her fellow vampires, including her husband. Still, Ruth reiterates her romantic feelings for Neville and urges him to flee the city to avoid capture. 

Neville ignores Ruth&#x27;s warning, assuming he will be treated fairly by the new society of living-infected. However, his mind is changed when he watches a group of them annihilate the undead vampires outside his home with fiendish glee, then break down his front door. In a panic, Neville opens fire on them but is in turn shot and subdued. Imprisoned and dying, he is visited by Ruth, who informs him that she is a senior member of the new society but, unlike the others who perceive him as a murderer, she does not resent him. She acknowledges the public need for Neville&#x27;s execution but, out of mercy, gives him a packet of fast-acting suicide pills. Neville accepts his fate and asks Ruth not to let this society become too heartless. Ruth promises to try, kisses him, and leaves. Neville goes to his prison window and sees the infected staring back at him with the same hatred and fear that he once felt for them. He realizes that he, a remnant of old humanity, is now a legend to the new race born of the infection. He acknowledges that their desire to kill him, after he has killed so many of their loved ones, is not something he can condemn. As the pills take effect, he is amused by the thought that he will become their new superstition and legend, just as vampires once were to humans.

==Critical reception==
As related in &quot;In Search of Wonder&quot; (1956), Damon Knight wrote:

&quot;Galaxy&quot; reviewer Groff Conklin described &quot;Legend&quot; as:

Anthony Boucher praised the novel:

Dan Schneider from &quot;International Writers Magazine: Book Review&quot; wrote:

In 2012, the Horror Writers Association gave &quot;I Am Legend&quot; the special Vampire Novel of the Century Award.

==Influence==
One major influence upon Matheson and others of the genre is the Mary Shelley novel, &quot;The Last Man&quot;, about an immune person surviving in a plague infested world. 

In &quot;I Am Legend&quot;, the &quot;vampires&quot; share more similarities with zombies, and the novel influenced the zombie fiction genre and popularized the concept of a worldwide zombie apocalypse.

Although the idea has now become commonplace, a scientific origin for vampirism or zombies was fairly original when written.

According to Clasen:

Although referred to as &quot;the first modern vampire novel&quot;, it is as a novel of social theme that &quot;I Am Legend&quot; made a lasting impression on the cinematic zombie genre, by way of director George A. Romero, who acknowledged its influence and that of its original cinematic adaptation, &quot;The Last Man on Earth&quot; (1964), upon his seminal film &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; (1968).

Discussing the creation of &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;, Romero remarked:

Moreover, film critics have noted similarities between &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; (1968) and &quot;The Last Man on Earth&quot; (1964).

Stephen King said: &quot;Books like &quot;I Am Legend&quot; were an inspiration to me.&quot; Film critics noted that the British film &quot;28 Days Later&quot; (2002) and its sequel &quot;28 Weeks Later&quot; both feature a rabies-type plague ravaging Great Britain, analogous to &quot;I Am Legend&quot;.

Tim Cain, the producer, lead programmer and one of the main designers of the 1997 computer game &quot;Fallout&quot;, cited &quot;I Am Legend&quot; and the movie &quot;The Omega Man&quot; as influences on the game:

The &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;Asylum of the Daleks&quot; sees Oswin Oswald introduced in a similar fashion to Neville as an homage to the novel, with both Oswin and Neville checking defences, boarding up the door/window, listening to classical music, and turning it up to drown out the sound of the enemies outside (Daleks for Oswin, vampires for Neville).

==Adaptations==
===Comics===

The book has also been adapted into a comic book miniseries titled &quot;Richard Matheson&#x27;s I Am Legend&quot; by Steve Niles and Elman Brown. It was published in 1991 by Eclipse Comics and collected into a trade paperback by IDW Publishing.

An unrelated film tie-in was released in 2007 as a one-shot &quot;I Am Legend: Awakening&quot; published in a San Diego Comic-Con special by Vertigo.

===Audiobook===
A nine-part abridged reading of the novel performed by Angus MacInnes was originally broadcast on BBC 7 in January 2006 and repeated in January 2018.

===Films===
&quot;I Am Legend&quot; has been adapted into a feature-length film three times, as well as into a direct-to-video feature film called &quot;I Am Omega&quot;. Differing from the book, each of them portrays the Neville character as an accomplished scientist. The three adaptations show him finding a remedy and passing it on. Adaptations differ from the novel by setting the events three years after the disaster, instead of happening &quot;in the span of&quot; three years. Also, adaptations are set in the near future, a few years after the film&#x27;s release, while the novel is set 20 years after its publication date.

 is a short film by Mario Gómez Martín in 1967 intended as a student film for the Spanish .
It has been described as the version most pessimist and faithful to the original novel.

====&quot;The Last Man on Earth&quot;====

In 1964, Vincent Price starred as Dr. Robert Morgan (rather than &quot;Neville&quot;) in &quot;The Last Man on Earth&quot; (the original title of this Italian production was ). Matheson wrote the original screenplay for this adaptation, but due to later rewrites did not wish his name to appear in the credits; as a result, Matheson is credited under the pseudonym &quot;Logan Swanson&quot;.

====&quot;The Omega Man&quot;====

In 1971, a far different version was produced, titled &quot;The Omega Man&quot;. It starred Charlton Heston (as Robert Neville) and Anthony Zerbe. Matheson had no influence on the screenplay for this film, and although the premise remains, it deviates from the novel in several ways, removing the infected people&#x27;s vampiric characteristics, except their sensitivity to light. In this version, the infected are portrayed as nocturnal, black-robed, albino mutants, known as the Family. Though intelligent, they eschew modern technology, believing it (and those who use it, such as Neville) to be evil and the cause of humanity&#x27;s downfall.

====&quot;I Am Legend&quot;====

In 2007, a third adaptation of the novel was produced, this time titled &quot;I Am Legend&quot;. Directed by Francis Lawrence and starring Will Smith as Robert Neville, this film uses both Matheson&#x27;s novel and the 1971 &quot;Omega Man&quot; film as its sources. This adaptation also deviates significantly from the novel. In this version, the infection is caused by a vaccine originally intended to cure cancer. Some vampiric elements are retained, such as sensitivity to UV light and attraction to blood. The infected are portrayed as nocturnal, feral creatures of limited intelligence who hunt the uninfected with berserker-like rage. Other creatures, such as dogs, are also infected by the virus. The ending of the film was also altered to portray Neville as sacrificing his life to save humanity, rather than being executed for crimes against the surviving vampiric humans, although a deleted ending for the film was closer in spirit to the book. The film takes place in New York City in 2009 and 2012 rather than Los Angeles in 1975–1977.

<doc id="45493" wikidata="Q285368" url="?curid=45493" title="Kenneth Ring">
<text>Kenneth Ring (born December 13, 1935) is an American psychologist, born in San Francisco, California. He is the co-founder and past president of the International Association for Near-Death Studies (IANDS) and is the founding editor of the &quot;Journal of Near-Death Studies&quot;. He currently lives in Kentfield, California.

==Biography==

Among his first publications was the book &quot;Methods of Madness: The Mental Hospital as a Last Resort&quot;. The book was released in 1969 and was co-authored with Benjamin Braginsky and Dorothea Braginsky. Ring&#x27;s book &quot;Life at Death&quot; was published by William Morrow and Company in 1980. In this book Ring presented the &quot;Weighted Core Experience&quot; Index, a psychometric instrument constructed to measure the depth of a near-death experience. In 1984, the company published Ring&#x27;s second book, &quot;Heading Toward Omega.&quot; Both books deal with near-death experiences and how they change people&#x27;s lives.

In 1992 he published &quot;The Omega Project: Human Evolution in an Ecological Age&quot;, a book that dealt with near-death experiences and UFO-encounters. 1998 saw the release of &quot;Lessons From the Light. What We Can Learn From the Near-Death Experience&quot;, co-authored with Evelyn Elaesser. The book discussed a wide range of paranormal phenomena, including out-of-body experiences, children&#x27;s near-death experiences, near-death experiences in the blind, as well as healing and paranormal abilities in near-death experiencers. Another co-authored release appeared in 1999. This time Ring co-operated with Sharon Cooper for the release of &quot;Mindsight: Near-death and out-of-body experiences in the blind&quot;. In the book Ring &amp; Cooper discussed the possibility of sight and vision among blind near-death experiencers.

In November 2008, Ring visited Israel as part of a peace delegation and subsequently protested the Israeli air strikes on the Gaza Strip as completely disproportionate. Kenneth Ring also is a co-author of &quot;Letters from Palestine&quot; (2011).

<doc id="45497" wikidata="Q185389" url="?curid=45497" title="Dennis Bergkamp">
<text>Dennis Nicolaas Maria Bergkamp (; born 10 May 1969) is a Dutch professional football coach and former player who was most recently the Assistant manager of Ajax. Originally a wide midfielder, Bergkamp was moved to main striker while still a teenager and then to second striker, where he remained throughout his playing career. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest players of his generation, one of the greatest forwards in Premier League history and amongst Ajax&#x27;s and Arsenal&#x27;s greatest ever players.

Bergkamp was born in Amsterdam and played as an amateur in the lower leagues. He was spotted by Ajax at age 11 and made his professional debut in 1986. Prolific form led to an international call-up with the Netherlands in 1990, attracting the attention of several European clubs. Bergkamp signed for Italian club Inter Milan in 1993, where he had two underwhelming seasons. After joining Arsenal in 1995, he rejuvenated his career, helping the club to win three Premier League titles (one unbeaten), three FA Cup trophies, and reach the 2006 UEFA Champions League Final. Despite noting a desire to not go into coaching, Bergkamp served as an assistant at Ajax between 2011 and 2017.

With the Netherlands national team, Bergkamp was selected for Euro 1992, where he impressed, scoring three goals as his country reached the semi-finals. At the 1998 FIFA World Cup, he scored a memorable winning goal in the final minute of the quarter-final against Argentina which has been regarded as one of the greatest FIFA World Cup goals. Bergkamp surpassed Faas Wilkes&#x27;s record to become the country&#x27;s top scorer of all time in 1998, a record later eclipsed by Patrick Kluivert, Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, and Robin van Persie.

Bergkamp has been described by Jan Mulder as having &quot;the finest technique&quot; of any Dutch international and a &quot;dream for a striker&quot; by teammate Thierry Henry. Bergkamp finished third twice in the FIFA World Player of the Year award and was selected by Pelé as one of the FIFA 100 greatest living players. In 2007, he was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame, the first and only Dutch player ever to receive the honour. Bergkamp was inducted into the Premier League Hall of Fame in 2021. In 2017, Bergkamp&#x27;s goal against Newcastle United in 2002 was voted as the best Premier League goal of all time in the league&#x27;s 25-year history, involving a flick around Newcastle defender Nikos Dabizas before calmly tapping the ball into the net.

==Early life==
Born in Amsterdam, Bergkamp was the last of Wim and Tonnie Bergkamp&#x27;s four sons. He was brought up in a working-class suburb, in a family aspiring to reach middle-class status. His father, an electrician and amateur footballer in the lower leagues, named him in honour of Scottish striker Denis Law. To comply with Dutch given name customs, an extra &quot;n&quot; was inserted in Bergkamp&#x27;s first name by his father after it was not accepted by the registrar. Bergkamp was raised as a Roman Catholic by his family and regularly attended church during his childhood. Although in later years he said visits to church did not appeal to him, Bergkamp still maintains his faith. According to Bergkamp, his childhood footballing heroes were Glenn Hoddle, whom he admired for his soft precise touch, and Johan Cruyff, who once coached him when he was twelve.

==Club career==
===Ajax: 1986–1993===
Bergkamp was brought up through Ajax&#x27;s youth system, joining the club at age 11. Manager Johan Cruyff gave him his professional debut on 14 December 1986 against Roda JC; the match ended in a 2–0 victory for Ajax. Bergkamp scored his first senior goal for the club against HFC Haarlem on 22 February 1987 in a match Ajax won 6–0. He went on to make 23 appearances in the 1986–87 season, including a European debut against Malmö FF in the 1986–87 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, earning him praise. Ajax won the competition, beating Lokomotive Leipzig 1–0 as Bergkamp made an appearance as a substitute.

In later seasons, Bergkamp established himself as a first-team player for Ajax. This culminated in a period of success for the club, which won the Eredivisie title in the 1989–90 season for the first time in five years. Bergkamp scored 29 goals in 36 matches the following season and became the joint top scorer in the league, sharing the accolade with PSV striker Romário.

Ajax won the 1992 UEFA Cup Final, beating Torino through the away goals ruling. They then defeated Heerenveen 6–2 in the final of the KNVB Cup on 20 May 1993. Bergkamp was the top scorer in the Eredivisie from 1991 to 1993 and was voted Dutch Footballer of the Year in 1992 and 1993. In total, he scored 122 goals in 239 matches for his hometown club.

===Inter Milan: 1993–1995===

Bergkamp attracted the attention of several European clubs as a result of his performances for Ajax. Fellow Dutchman and then FC Barcelona Johan Cruyff, in an attempt to encourage Bergkamp to sign for Barcelona, advised him not to join Spanish rivals Real Madrid, one of the teams said to have been interested in him, but Bergkamp was primarily interested in a move to Italy. Bergkamp considered Serie A &quot;the biggest league at the time&quot; but after the success of fellow countrymen Marco van Basten, Ruud Gullit and Frank Rijkaard at AC Milan he preferred a move to either Juventus or Inter Milan to help distinguish himself. On 16 February 1993, Bergkamp agreed a £7.1 million move to the latter club in a deal which included his Ajax teammate Wim Jonk. Upon signing, Bergkamp said Inter &quot;met all my demands. The most important thing for me was the stadium, the people at the club and their style of play.&quot;

Bergkamp made his debut against Reggiana on 29 August 1993 at the San Siro in a 2–1 victory. He scored his first goal for the club against Cremonese in September 1993 but had a difficult time against the highly organised and resolute Italian defences, scoring a further seven goals in the league. This was partly due to manager Osvaldo Bagnoli&#x27;s inability to find a stable forward partnership, preferring Bergkamp in a three with Rubén Sosa and Salvatore Schillaci. Inter&#x27;s poor league form culminated in the sacking of Bagnoli in February 1994 and his replacement by Gianpiero Marini, a member of Italy&#x27;s 1982 FIFA World Cup-winning squad. The club finished 13th in Serie A, one point away from relegation, but enjoyed success in the UEFA Cup, beating Austria Salzburg in the final over two legs. Bergkamp was the competition&#x27;s joint top scorer with eight goals and scored a hat-trick against Rapid București in the first round.

In Bergkamp&#x27;s second season at Inter, the club changed managers again, appointing Ottavio Bianchi. Bergkamp endured a disappointing campaign, troubled with stress injuries and fatigue from the 1994 World Cup. He managed to score 5 goals in 26 appearances. Off the field, Bergkamp&#x27;s relationship with the Italian press and fans became uncomfortable. His shy persona and his propensity to go home after matches was interpreted as apathy. Because of his poor performance on the pitch, one Italian publication renamed their award given to the worst performance of the week, &quot;L&#x27;asino della settimana&quot; (Donkey of the Week) to &quot;Bergkamp della settimana&quot;. Inter ended the league season in sixth position and failed to retain the UEFA Cup, with the club eliminated in the second round. In February 1995, the club was purchased by Italian businessman and fan Massimo Moratti, who promised to invest heavily in the squad. Bergkamp&#x27;s future in the first team was uncertain following the signing of Maurizio Ganz a month after the takeover.

===Arsenal: 1995–2006===
As Moratti prepared to make wholesale changes at the club, Bergkamp left Inter and signed with Arsenal in June 1995 for a transfer fee estimated at £7.5 million. He became manager Bruce Rioch&#x27;s first signing at Arsenal and broke the club&#x27;s prior transfer fee record of £2.5 million. Bergkamp&#x27;s arrival at the club was significant not only because he was an established international footballer who looked to have his best years ahead of him but also because of his perceived difference in style with the Arsenal team of the 90&#x27;s who had become a defensive and low scoring team under George Graham, plagued by a drinking culture.

On the opening day of the 1995–96 league season, Bergkamp made his full debut against Middlesbrough. He initially struggled to adapt to the English game and failed to score in the club&#x27;s next six league matches, prompting ridicule by the national press. On 23 September 1995, Bergkamp scored his first and second goals for Arsenal against Southampton at Highbury. Bergkamp ended his first season with 33 appearances and 11 goals, helping Arsenal finish fifth and earn a place in the UEFA Cup by scoring the winner against Bolton Wanderers on the final day of the season.

The appointment of Arsène Wenger as Arsenal manager in September 1996 marked a turning point in Bergkamp&#x27;s career. Wenger, who had been a successful manager in France and Japan, recognised Bergkamp&#x27;s talent and wanted to use him as a fulcrum of the team&#x27;s forward play. Both were advocates of a continental style of attacking football, and Wenger&#x27;s decision to impose a strict fitness and health regimen pleased Bergkamp. Despite making fewer appearances in the 1996–97 season, Bergkamp was more influential in the first team, providing 13 assists. Against Tottenham Hotspur in November 1996, he set up an 88th-minute winner for captain Tony Adams to volley in using his left foot. He then scored in injury time, controlling a high ball with his left foot and evading his marker Stephen Carr in a tight area to set up his shot. Bergkamp received his first red card against Sunderland in January 1997 for a high tackle on midfielder Paul Bracewell in the 26th minute. Arsenal went on to lose the match 1–0, but a run of 8 wins in their final 16 matches gave the club a third-place finish, missing out on a spot in the UEFA Champions League via goal difference.

Bergkamp was instrumental the following season in helping Arsenal complete a domestic league and cup double. He became the club&#x27;s top scorer with 22 goals and recorded a strike rate of 0.57. Arsenal&#x27;s achievement was all the more astonishing given the team, written off by many in December 1997, had made ground on reigning Premier League champions Manchester United. Early in the season away to Leicester City at Filbert Street on 23 August 1997, Bergkamp scored his first hat-trick for the club. The third goal, which he regarded as his favourite for Arsenal, required just one touch to control the ball in the penalty box, another to flick it past his marker Matt Elliott before juggling it with his feet and shooting past goalkeeper Kasey Keller. After the match, Leicester manager Martin O&#x27;Neill was gracious enough to admit Bergkamp&#x27;s was &quot;the best hat-trick I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot;. In an FA Cup quarter-final replay against West Ham United on 17 March 1998, Bergkamp was sent off for elbowing midfielder Steve Lomas and missed three matches due to suspension. He played no further part in Arsenal&#x27;s season after overstretching his hamstring against Derby County on 29 April 1998, missing the 1998 FA Cup Final. Bergkamp was consoled with the PFA Players&#x27; Player of the Year award, becoming only the third non-British player to be recognised by his fellow professionals as the outstanding performer in English football.

After an effective 1998 World Cup campaign with the national team, Bergkamp had another productive season in 1998–99. Although Arsenal failed to retain the Premier League after losing the title on the final day of the season to Manchester United, Bergkamp was the club&#x27;s second-top scorer in all competitions, with 16 goals, and finished the season as the top assist provider in the Premier League, alongside Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, with 13 assists. Arsenal were also defeated in a FA Cup semi-final replay against Manchester United in April 1999. With the score 1–1 heading into injury time, Arsenal were awarded a penalty after midfielder Ray Parlour was brought down by Phil Neville inside the 18-yard box. Bergkamp took the penalty shot but it was saved by goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel. In the second half of extra time, Ryan Giggs scored the winner, a goal regarded by many as the greatest in the competition&#x27;s history. After this miss, Bergkamp did not take another penalty for the remainder of his career.

The 1999–2000 season proved to be a frustrating one for both Arsenal and Bergkamp. The club finished second in the league, 18 points behind Manchester United, and lost in the 2000 UEFA Cup Final to Turkish opponents Galatasaray on penalties. The departure of compatriot Marc Overmars and French midfielder Emmanuel Petit in the close season led to speculation over Bergkamp&#x27;s future. He ultimately agreed terms on a contract extension in December 2000. Despite an array of new signings made in the 2000–01 season, Arsenal were runners-up in the league for a third year in succession. The emergence of Thierry Henry and Sylvain Wiltord as the main strikers saw Bergkamp&#x27;s first-team opportunities limited as a result. He was used as a late substitute in Liverpool&#x27;s win over Arsenal in the 2001 FA Cup Final.

Success finally came in the 2001–02 season. Arsenal regained the league, beating Manchester United at Old Trafford in the penultimate game of the season to complete the club&#x27;s second double under Wenger; Arsenal defeated Chelsea 2–0 to win the FA Cup four days prior. Bergkamp played in 33 league matches, setting up 15 goals, one of which was against Juventus in the second group stage of the Champions League. Holding off two markers, he twisted and turned before feeding the ball to Freddie Ljungberg in the penalty box to score. Bergkamp headed in the winner against Liverpool in a FA Cup fourth-round tie on 27 January 2002, but was shown a red card for a two-footed lunge on defender Jamie Carragher, who himself was sent off for throwing a coin into the crowd. He was subsequently banned for three matches (two league, one FA Cup round). Bergkamp appealed for his ban, but was unsuccessful. He made his return against Newcastle United on 3 March 2002. Early in the match, Arsenal midfielder Robert Pires played a low pass from the left flank to Bergkamp in the edge of the opponent area with his back to goal. Under pressure from his marker Nikos Dabizas, Bergkamp controlled the ball with one flick and went around the other side before placing the ball precisely into the bottom right-hand corner to score. Wenger described the goal as &quot;unbelievable&quot;, adding &quot;It was not only a magnificent goal but a very important one – I enjoyed it a lot&quot;. Bergkamp featured in nine out of the last ten league games, forming a productive partnership with Ljungberg.

Bergkamp reached a personal landmark during the 2002–03 season, scoring his 100th goal for Arsenal against Oxford United in a FA Cup third-round tie on 4 January 2003. In the league, Arsenal failed to retain the championship despite having led by eight points in March 2003. However, they did win the FA Cup for a second successive year, beating Southampton in the 2003 FA Cup Final. On 20 July 2003, Bergkamp signed a one-year extension at the club. The 2003–04 season ended on a high point for Bergkamp as Arsenal reclaimed the league title, becoming the first English team in more than a century to go through the entire domestic league season unbeaten. Against Leicester City in the final league match of the campaign with the score tied at 1–1, Bergkamp set up the winner with a pass to captain Patrick Vieira. Vieira rounded the goalkeeper and scored. The team, dubbed &quot;The Invincibles&quot; did not achieve similar dominance in Europe; Arsenal were beaten by Chelsea in the quarter-finals of the Champions League over two legs. Bergkamp committed himself to Arsenal at the end of the season, signing a further extension to his contract.

Bergkamp started in 29 league matches in the 2004–05 season, but Arsenal&#x27;s title defence ended unsuccessfully. The team finished second, 12 points behind Chelsea. At home against Middlesbrough on 22 August 2004, Bergkamp acted as captain for the injured Vieira in a match where Arsenal came back from 1–3 down to win 5–3 and equal Nottingham Forest&#x27;s record of 42 league matches undefeated. Against Sheffield United in the FA Cup on 19 February 2005, Bergkamp was shown a straight red card by referee Neale Barry for shoving defender Danny Cullip. His appeal of the decision was rejected by The Football Association (FA), meaning he missed the club&#x27;s next three domestic games. In Arsenal&#x27;s final home match of the season, against Everton, Bergkamp had a man of the match game, scoring once and assisting three of the goals in a 7–0 win. Bergkamp was moved by Arsenal supporters chanting &quot;one more year&quot;, describing it as &quot;quite special&quot;. &quot;They obviously feel there is another year left in me, so that&#x27;s great as it shows they&#x27;re really behind me,&quot; he said. Following Arsenal&#x27;s penalty shootout victory over Manchester United in the 2005 FA Cup Final, he signed a one-year contract extension.

The team finished fourth in the league in Bergkamp&#x27;s final season at Arsenal. Bergkamp scored an injury-time winner against Thun on Matchday 1 of the Champions League, having come on as a substitute in the 72nd minute. After much campaigning from Arsenal supporters, the club designated one of its Highbury matchday themes, organised to commemorate the stadium&#x27;s final season as home of Arsenal, to Dennis Bergkamp. &quot;Bergkamp Day&quot; took place on 15 April 2006 and saw Arsenal up against West Bromwich Albion. It celebrated the player&#x27;s contribution to Arsenal; fans were given commemorative orange &quot;DB10&quot; T-shirts – the colour of his national team, his initials and his squad number. Bergkamp himself came on as a second-half substitute and set up the winning Robert Pires goal moments after Nigel Quashie had levelled the scoreline. Fittingly, Bergkamp&#x27;s 89th-minute goal proved to be his last for Arsenal in competitive football. Bergkamp was an unused substitute in his final match for Arsenal against Barcelona in the Champions League final; Barcelona scored twice in the last 13 minutes to overturn Arsenal&#x27;s early lead and win the competition.

Bergkamp was the focus of the first match at Arsenal&#x27;s new ground, the Emirates Stadium. On 22 July 2006, a testimonial was played in his honour at the new stadium as Arsenal played his old club Ajax. Bergkamp kicked off the match with his father, Wim, and son, Mitchel. All four children acted as the match&#x27;s mascots. The first half was played by members of Arsenal and Ajax&#x27;s current squads, while the second was played by famous ex-players from both sides, including Ian Wright, Patrick Vieira, Marc Overmars, Emmanuel Petit and David Seaman for Arsenal; and Johan Cruyff, Marco van Basten, Danny Blind, Frank and Ronald de Boer for Ajax. Arsenal won the match 2–1 with goals from Henry and Nwankwo Kanu. Klaas-Jan Huntelaar had earlier opened the scoring for Ajax, making him the first goalscorer at the Emirates Stadium.

==International career==
Bergkamp made his international debut for the Netherlands national team against Italy on 26 September 1990 as a substitute for Frank de Boer. He scored his first goal for the team against Greece on 21 November 1990. Bergkamp was selected for Euro 1992, where his national team were the defending champions. Bergkamp impressed, scoring three goals in the tournament and finishing as one of the joint top goalscorers of the competition. However, his team lost on penalties to eventual champions Denmark in the semi-final, following a 2–2 draw; during the match, Bergkamp scored the first Dutch goal to tie the match 1–1, and also netted his penalty in the shootout. He also scored the only goal of the match in the Netherlands&#x27; opening win against Scotland, and the final goal in a 3–1 win over Germany in their first round match, which allowed them to top their group. Bergkamp was named in the &quot;Team of the Tournament&quot; for his performances.

In the qualification for the 1994 FIFA World Cup, Bergkamp scored five goals and was selected for the finals, staged in the United States. He featured in every game for the national team, getting a goal against Morocco in the group stages (in addition to assisting Bryan Roy&#x27;s late winner) and another one in a 2–0 win against the Republic of Ireland in the round-of-16. Bergkamp scored the first goal for the Netherlands against eventual champions Brazil, but the team lost 3–2, exiting in the quarter-finals. At Euro 1996, Bergkamp scored against Switzerland and set up striker Patrick Kluivert&#x27;s consolation goal against England, who advanced into the quarter-finals as first in their group while the Dutch finished second and faced France, being eliminated after a penalty shootout, following a 0–0 draw.

Against Wales in the 1998 FIFA World Cup qualification on 9 November 1996, he scored his first hat-trick for the national team. The Netherlands finished first in their group and qualified for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, held in France. Bergkamp scored three times in the competition, including a memorable winning goal in the final minute of the quarter-final against Argentina. 
He took one touch to control a long 60-yard aerial pass from Frank de Boer, brought the ball down through Argentine defender Roberto Ayala&#x27;s legs, and finally finished by firing a volley with the outside of his right foot, past keeper Carlos Roa at a tight angle from the right. 
The goal, cited by Bergkamp as his favourite in his career, was his 36th for the national team, overtaking Faas Wilkes as the record scorer. Bergkamp had also previously set-up Kluivert&#x27;s opening goal with his head.
His other two goals of the tournament came in the Netherlands&#x27; 5–0 victory over South Korea on 20 June, in the team&#x27;s second group match (scoring the third goal, in addition to setting up Phillip Cocu&#x27;s opener), and in the 2–1 win over Yugoslavia on 26 June in the round of 16, in which Bergkamp opened the scoring in the first half. He also assisted Cocu&#x27;s opening goal in the final group match, a 2–2 draw against Mexico, on 25 June. In the semi-finals, the Netherlands lost to defending champions Brazil on penalties after drawing 1–1 in normal time, with Bergkamp netting his spot-kick in the shoot-out. Bergkamp made the All-Star team of the tournament, alongside compatriots Frank de Boer and Edgar Davids.

On 9 October 1999, Bergkamp scored his final goal for the Netherlands, against Brazil. As the Netherlands were co-hosts for Euro 2000, the team automatically qualified for the tournament and were considered favourites. Bergkamp went scoreless throughout the competition, but assisted three goals: he set-up Kluivert&#x27;s goal in the Netherlands&#x27; final group match, a 3–2 win over eventual champions France, which allowed them to top their group, and also assisted two goals (Kluivert&#x27;s opener and the first of Marc Overmars&#x27;s two goals) in a 6–1 win over Yugoslavia in the quarter-finals. In the semi-finals, the Netherlands lost 3–1 on penalties to Italy, following a 0–0 draw. Following the defeat, Bergkamp announced his retirement from international football, choosing to focus on his club career. His final goal tally of 37 goals in 79 appearances was overtaken by Patrick Kluivert in June 2003.

==Player profile==
===Style of play===

Bergkamp was schooled in Dutch Total Football, a playing style and philosophy which relied on versatility. This was primarily to maximise the footballer&#x27;s potential; players tried out every outfield position before finding one that suited them best. Every age group at Ajax played in the same style and formation as the first team – 3–4–3 – to allow individuals to slot in without effort when moving up the pyramid. Bergkamp &quot;played in every position apart from goalie&quot; and believed he benefited from the experience of playing as a defender, as it helped him &quot;know how they think and how to beat them&quot;. When he made his debut as a substitute against Roda JC, Bergkamp was positioned on the right wing, where he remained for three years.

During his time at Inter Milan, Bergkamp was switched to the position of a main striker, but failed to cooperate with his offensive partner Rubén Sosa, whom he later called &quot;selfish&quot;. Furthermore, due to his introverted character, he was accused of lacking consistency and leadership skills by the Italian press, and struggled to replicate his previous form during his time with Inter. When Bergkamp joined Arsenal in 1995, he enjoyed a successful strike partnership with Wright, and in later seasons Anelka and Henry, playing in his preferred position as a creative second striker. The arrival of Overmars in the 1997–98 season enhanced Bergkamp&#x27;s play, as he was getting more of the ball. Between August and October 1997, he scored seven goals in seven league matches. A similar rapport developed between him and Ljungberg during the 2001–02 season.

Although he was known for his composure and ability to score several goals for his team as a forward, Bergkamp was also capable of playing in a free role behind a lone striker, where he essentially functioned in the number 10 role as a playmaking attacking midfielder or deep-lying forward, due to his ball skills and creative ability, which enabled him to drop deep between the lines and link-up play, and operate across all attacking areas of the pitch. His tendency to move freely about the entire front-line made it difficult for opposing defenders to mark him. As such, Sam Tighe of &quot;Bleacher Report&quot; has retroactively compared Bergkamp&#x27;s role as a free centre-forward to that of the modern false-9. A quick, elegant, intelligent, and gifted player, who was regarded as one of the most technically accomplished players of all time, he possessed an excellent first touch, which – allied with his quick feet, dribbling ability and change of pace – enabled him to beat defenders in one on one situations, while his attacking movement, physique, balance, and close control allowed him to hold up the ball and create space for teammates; his vision and passing range with both feet, despite being naturally right-footed, subsequently allowed him to provide assists for on-running strikers. Bergkamp often stated he preferred playing in this deeper role, as he derived more pleasure from assisting goals, rather than scoring them himself.

Throughout his playing career, Bergkamp was accused of diving, and was referred to as a &quot;cheat&quot; and &quot;dirty player&quot; for retaliating against players who had previously challenged him, something his former manager Wenger denied. In an interview with &quot;The Times&quot; in 2004, he said that while he was at Inter, he realised the importance of being mentally tough in order to survive: &quot;A lot of people there try to hurt you, not just physically but mentally as well, and coming from the easygoing culture in Holland, I had to adopt a tougher approach. There, it was a case of two strikers up against four or five hard defenders who would stop at nothing.&quot; Bergkamp says his aggression often stems from frustration.

===Reception===
Widely regarded by pundits as one of the greatest players of his generation, as one of the greatest forwards in Premier League history, and as one of Ajax&#x27;s and Arsenal&#x27;s greatest players ever, Bergkamp has received several accolades during his playing career. He twice finished in third place for the 1993 and 1997 FIFA World Player of the Year award and was named in FIFA 100, a list compiled by footballer Pelé of the 125 greatest living footballers. In his club career, Bergkamp won two successive Dutch Footballer of the Year awards in 1991 and 1992 and was the Eredivisie top scorer for three consecutive seasons (1990–91 to 1992–93). He was named the FWA Footballer of the Year and PFA Players&#x27; Player of the Year in April and May 1998 and made the PFA Team of the Year for the 1997–98 season. Bergkamp also achieved a unique feat in being voted first, second and third on Match of the Day&#x27;s Goal of the Month competition in August 1997. For his national team, Bergkamp was the joint top scorer at Euro 1992 and was selected in the All-Star team for the tournament, an honour he also received at the 1998 FIFA World Cup.

In April 2007, Bergkamp was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame by viewers of BBC&#x27;s &quot;Football Focus&quot;. A year later, he was voted second by Arsenal fans behind Thierry Henry in a list of the &quot;50 Gunners Greatest Players&quot;. In February 2014, Arsenal unveiled a statue of Bergkamp outside the Emirates Stadium to honour his time at the club. A statue of Dennis Bergkamp will be erected outside the KNVB headquarters in Zeist, as he has been chosen as the best Dutch international player from 1990 to 2015. The statue will join those of &quot;the eleven of the century&quot;, erected in 1999, alongside statues of Johan Cruyff, Ruud Gullit, Frank Rijkaard and Marco van Basten, amongst others. In September 2023, &quot;FourFourTwo&quot; magazine ranked Bergkamp 68th in their list of the &quot;100 best football players of all time.&quot;

Bergkamp has been described by Jan Mulder as having &quot;the finest technique&quot; of any Dutch international and as a &quot;dream for a striker&quot; by former Arsenal teammate Thierry Henry.

==Coaching career==
Upon retiring, Bergkamp insisted he would not move into coaching. He turned down an offer to scout for Arsenal and instead concentrated on travelling and spending time with his family. However, in April 2008, he began a fast-track coaching diploma for former Dutch international footballers and undertook a trainee role at Ajax. Having completed the Coach Betaald Voetbal course by the Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB), Bergkamp was appointed assistant to Johan Neeskens for the newly formed Netherlands B team on 26 October 2008. For the 2008–09 season, Bergkamp returned to Ajax in a formal coaching position with responsibility for the D2 (U12) youth team. Following the promotion of Frank de Boer as manager of Ajax in December 2010, Bergkamp was appointed assistant manager to Fred Grim, dealing with Ajax&#x27; flagship A1 (U19) youth team.

In August 2011, Bergkamp was named De Boer&#x27;s assistant at Ajax. However, after the arrival of Peter Bosz as the new head coach at Ajax, Bergkamp&#x27;s role at Ajax slightly changed. He no longer sat on the bench during first-team matches, but instead focused more on field training and on helping youth players reach the first team. He and fellow assistant Hennie Spijkerman were sacked from their roles in December 2017.

==Personal life==
Bergkamp has been married to Henrita Ruizendaal since 16 June 1993. The couple have four children: Estelle, Mitchel, Yasmin, and Saffron. His son Mitchel is a footballer. His daughter Estelle is the partner of Girona FC midfielder Donny van de Beek, the couple&#x27;s first daughter having been born on 9 April 2022.

His nephew, Roland Bergkamp is also a former professional footballer.

He speaks fluent Dutch (his mother tongue), English and Italian.

===Aviophobia===
Bergkamp&#x27;s nickname is the &quot;Non-Flying Dutchman&quot; due to his fear of flying. Contemporary sources believed that this stemmed from incidents with the Netherlands national team at the 1994 World Cup where the engine of the plane cut out during a flight, and when a flight was delayed because a journalist made a joke about having a bomb in his bag. In his 2013 autobiography, Bergkamp stated that his phobia was in fact caused during his first season at Inter Milan, in which the team regularly travelled to away games in small aeroplanes. Bergkamp decided he would never fly again after the 1994 World Cup, but did consider seeking psychiatric help in 1996:I&#x27;ve got this problem and I have to live with it. I can&#x27;t do anything about it, it is a psychological thing and I can&#x27;t explain it. I have not flown on a plane for two years. The Dutch FA has been sympathetic, so have Arsenal, so far. I am considering psychiatric help. I can&#x27;t fly. I just freeze. I get panicky. It starts the day before, when I can&#x27;t sleep.

The condition severely limited his ability to play in away matches in European competitions and to travel with the national team. In some cases, he would travel overland by car or train, but the logistics of some matches were such that he would not travel at all. In the build-up to Arsenal&#x27;s Champions League match against Lyon in February 2001, Wenger spoke of his concerns for Bergkamp travelling by train and car, because of the exertions involved.

==Media==
Bergkamp features in EA Sports&#x27; &quot;FIFA&quot; video game series; he was on the cover for the International edition of &quot;FIFA 99&quot;, and was named in the Ultimate Team Legends in &quot;FIFA 14&quot;.

<text>The Great Lakes Commission is a United States interstate agency established in 1955 through the Great Lakes Basin Compact, in order to &quot;promote the orderly, integrated and comprehensive development, use and conservation of the water resources of the Great Lakes Basin,&quot; which includes the Saint Lawrence River. The Great Lakes Commission provides policy development, coordination, and advocacy on issues of regional concern, as well as communication and research services.

The eight member states are Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.
The Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec are associate members. 
Each state has three votes on matters coming before the commission, while associate members and observers (representing the United States and Canadian federal governments, tribes, and other regional organizations) are permitted to participate in discussions, deliberations and other activities as approved by the commission but have no vote.

<text>Coelacanths ( ) (order Coelacanthiformes) are an ancient group of lobe-finned fish (Sarcopterygii) in the class Actinistia. As sarcopterygians, they are more closely related to lungfish and tetrapods (which includes amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals) than to ray-finned fish.

Well-represented in both freshwater and marine fossils since the Devonian, they are now represented by only two extant marine species in the genus &quot;Latimeria&quot;: the West Indian Ocean coelacanth (&quot;Latimeria chalumnae&quot;), primarily found near the Comoro Islands off the east coast of Africa, and the Indonesian coelacanth (&quot;Latimeria menadoensis&quot;). The name &quot;coelacanth&quot; originates from the Permian genus &quot;Coelacanthus&quot;, which was the first scientifically named coelacanth.

The oldest known coelacanth fossils date back more than 410million years. Coelacanths were thought to have become extinct in the Late Cretaceous, around 66million years ago, but were discovered living off the coast of South Africa in 1938.

The coelacanth was long considered a &quot;living fossil&quot; because scientists thought it was the sole remaining member of a taxon otherwise known only from fossils, with no close relatives alive, and that it evolved into roughly its current form approximately 400million years ago. However, several more recent studies have shown that coelacanth body shapes are much more diverse than previously thought.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;Coelacanth&quot; is an adaptation of the Modern Latin (&#x27;hollow spine&#x27;), from the Ancient Greek (, &#x27;hollow&#x27;) and (, &#x27;spine&#x27;), referring to the hollow caudal fin rays of the first fossil specimen described and named by Louis Agassiz in 1839, belonging to the genus &quot;Coelacanthus&quot;. The genus name &quot;Latimeria&quot; commemorates Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer, who discovered the first specimen.

== Discovery ==

The earliest fossils of coelacanths were discovered in the 19th century. Coelacanths, which are related to lungfishes and tetrapods, were believed to have become extinct at the end of the Cretaceous period. More closely related to tetrapods than to the ray-finned fish, coelacanths were considered transitional species between fish and tetrapods. On 22 December 1938, the first &quot;Latimeria&quot; specimen was found off the east coast of South Africa, off the Chalumna River (now Tyolomnqa). Museum curator Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer discovered the fish among the catch of a local fisherman. Courtenay-Latimer contacted a Rhodes University ichthyologist, J. L. B. Smith, sending him drawings of the fish, and he confirmed the fish&#x27;s importance with a famous cable: &quot;Most Important Preserve Skeleton and Gills = Fish Described.&quot;

Its discovery 66 million years after its supposed extinction makes the coelacanth the best-known example of a Lazarus taxon, an evolutionary line that seems to have disappeared from the fossil record only to reappear much later. Since 1938, West Indian Ocean coelacanth have been found in the Comoros, Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique, Madagascar, in iSimangaliso Wetland Park, and off the South Coast of Kwazulu-Natal in South Africa.

The Comoro Islands specimen was discovered in December 1952. Between 1938 and 1975, 84 specimens were caught and recorded.

The second extant species, the Indonesian coelacanth, was described from Manado, North Sulawesi, Indonesia, in 1999 by Pouyaud et al. based on a specimen discovered by Mark V. Erdmann in 1998 and deposited at the Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI). Erdmann and his wife Arnaz Mehta first encountered a specimen at a local market in September 1997, but took only a few photographs of the first specimen of this species before it was sold. After confirming that it was a unique discovery, Erdmann returned to Sulawesi in November 1997 to interview fishermen and look for further examples. A second specimen was caught by a fisherman in July 1998 and was then handed to Erdmann.

== Description ==
&quot;Latimeria chalumnae&quot; and &quot;L. menadoensis&quot; are the only two known living coelacanth species. Coelacanths are large, plump, lobe-finned fish that can grow to more than and weigh around . They are estimated to live up to 100 years, based on analysis of annual growth marks on scales, and reach maturity around the age of 55; the oldest known specimen was 84 years old at the time of its capture in 1960. 
Even though their estimated lifetime is similar to humans, gestation can last 5 years, which is 1.5 years more than the deep-sea frilled shark, the previous record holder.

They are nocturnal piscivorous drift-hunters.

The body is covered in ctenoid elasmoid scales that act as armor. Coelacanths have eight fins – two dorsal fins, two pectoral fins, two pelvic fins, one anal fin and one caudal fin. The tail is very nearly equally proportioned and is split by a terminal tuft of fin rays that make up its caudal lobe. The eyes of the coelacanth are very large, while the mouth is very small. The eye is acclimatized to seeing in poor light by rods that absorb mostly short wavelengths. Coelacanth vision has evolved to a mainly blue-shifted color capacity. Pseudomaxillary folds surround the mouth and replace the maxilla, a structure absent in coelacanths. Two nostrils, along with four other external openings, appear between the premaxilla and lateral rostral bones. The nasal sacs resemble those of many other fish and do not contain an internal nostril. The coelacanth&#x27;s rostral organ, contained within the ethmoid region of the braincase, has three unguarded openings into the environment and is used as a part of the coelacanth&#x27;s laterosensory system. The coelacanth&#x27;s auditory reception is mediated by its inner ear, which is very similar to that of tetrapods and is classified as being a basilar papilla.

Coelacanths are a part of the clade Sarcopterygii, or the lobe-finned fishes. They share membership in this clade with lungfish and tetrapods. Externally, several characteristics distinguish coelacanths from other lobe-finned fish. They possess a three-lobed caudal fin, also called a trilobate fin or a diphycercal tail. A secondary tail extending past the primary tail separates the upper and lower halves of the coelacanth. Ctenoid elasmoid scales act as thick armor to protect the coelacanth&#x27;s exterior. Several internal traits also aid in differentiating coelacanths from other lobe-finned fish. At the back of the skull, the coelacanth possesses a hinge, the intracranial joint, which allows it to open its mouth extremely wide. Coelacanths also retain an oil-filled notochord, a hollow, pressurized tube which is replaced by a vertebral column early in embryonic development in most other vertebrates. The coelacanth&#x27;s heart is shaped differently from that of most modern fish, with its chambers arranged in a straight tube. The coelacanth&#x27;s braincase is 98.5% filled with fat; only 1.5% of the braincase contains brain tissue. The cheeks of the coelacanth are unique because the opercular bone is very small and holds a large soft-tissue opercular flap. A spiracular chamber is present, but the spiracle is closed and never opens during development. Also unique to extant coelacanths is the presence of a &quot;fatty lung&quot; or a fat-filled single-lobed vestigial lung, homologous to other fishes&#x27; swim bladders. The parallel development of a fatty organ for buoyancy control suggests a unique specialization for deep-water habitats. There are small and hard but flexible plates around the vestigial lung in adult specimens, though not around the fatty organ. The plates most likely had a regulation function for the volume of the lung. Due to the size of the fatty organ, researchers assume that it is responsible for the kidney&#x27;s unusual relocation. The two kidneys, which are fused into one, are located ventrally within the abdominal cavity, posterior to the cloaca.


=== DNA ===
In 2013, a research group published the genome sequence of the coelacanth in the scientific journal &quot;Nature&quot;.

Due to their lobed fins and other features, it was once hypothesized that the coelacanth might be the youngest diverging non-tetrapod sarcopterygian. But after sequencing the full genome of the coelacanth, it was discovered that the lungfish instead is more closely related to tetrapods. Coelacanths and rhipidistians (the concestor of lungfish and tetrapods) had already diverged from each other before the lungfish made the transition to land.

Another important discovery made from the genome sequencing is that the coelacanths are still evolving today. While phenotypic similarity between extant and extinct coelacanths suggests there is limited evolutionary pressure on these organisms to undergo morphological divergence, they are undergoing measurable genetic divergence. Despite prior studies showing that protein coding regions are undergoing evolution at a substitution rate much lower than other sarcopterygians (consistent with phenotypic stasis observed between extant and fossil members of the taxa), the non-coding regions subject to higher transposable element activity show marked divergence even between the two extant coelacanth species. This has been facilitated in part by a coelacanth-specific endogenous retrovirus of the Epsilon retrovirus family.

== Fossil record ==

According to the fossil record, the divergence of coelacanths, lungfish, and tetrapods is thought to have occurred during the Silurian. Over 100 fossil species of coelacanth have been described. The oldest identified coelacanth fossils are around 420–410 million years old, dating to the early Devonian. Coelacanths were never a diverse group in comparison to other groups of fish, and reached a peak diversity during the Early Triassic (252–247 million years ago), coinciding with a burst of diversification between the Late Permian and Middle Triassic. Most Mesozoic coelacanths belong to the order Latimerioidei, which contains two major subdivisions, the marine Latimeriidae, which contains modern coelacanths, as well as the extinct Mawsoniidae, which were native to brackish, freshwater as well as marine environments.

Paleozoic coelacanths are generally small (~ in length), while Mesozoic forms were larger. Several specimens belonging to the Jurassic and Cretaceous mawsoniid coelacanth genera &quot;Trachymetopon&quot; and &quot;Mawsonia&quot; likely reached or exceeded in length, making them amongst the largest known fishes of the Mesozoic, and amongst the largest bony fishes of all time.

The most recent fossil latimeriid is &quot;Megalocoelacanthus dobiei&quot;, whose disarticulated remains are found in late Santonian to middle Campanian, and possibly earliest Maastrichtian-aged marine strata of the Eastern and Central United States, the most recent mawsoniids are &quot;Axelrodichthys megadromos&quot; from early Campanian to early Maastrichtian freshwater continental deposits of France, as well as an indeterminate marine mawsoniid from Morocco, dating to the late Maastrichtian A small bone fragment from the European Paleocene has been considered the only plausible post-Cretaceous record, but this identification is based on comparative bone histology methods of doubtful reliability.

Living coelacanths have been considered &quot;living fossils&quot; based on their supposedly conservative morphology relative to fossil species; however, recent studies have expressed the view that coelacanth morphologic conservatism is a belief not based on data. Fossils suggest that coelacanths were most morphologically diverse during the Devonian and Carboniferous, while Mesozoic species are generally morphologically similar to each other.

=== Timeline of genera ===
== Distribution and habitat ==

The current coelacanth range is primarily along the eastern African coast, although &quot;Latimeria menadoensis&quot; was discovered off Indonesia. Coelacanths have been found in the waters of Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique, South Africa, Madagascar, Comoros and Indonesia. Most &quot;Latimeria chalumnae&quot; specimens that have been caught have been captured around the islands of Grande Comore and Anjouan in the Comoros Archipelago (Indian Ocean). Though there are cases of &quot;L. chalumnae&quot; caught elsewhere, amino acid sequencing has shown no big difference between these exceptions and those found around Comore and Anjouan. Even though these few may be considered strays, there are several reports of coelacanths being caught off the coast of Madagascar. This leads scientists to believe that the endemic range of &quot;Latimeria chalumnae&quot; coelacanths stretches along the eastern coast of Africa from the Comoros Islands, past the western coast of Madagascar to the South African coastline. Mitochondrial DNA sequencing of coelacanths caught off the coast of southern Tanzania suggests a divergence of the two populations some 200,000 years ago. This could refute the theory that the Comoros population is the main population while others represent recent offshoots. A live specimen was seen and recorded on video in November 2019 at off the village of Umzumbe on the South Coast of KwaZulu-Natal, south of the iSimangaliso Wetland Park. This is the farthest south since the original discovery, and the second shallowest record after in the Diepgat Canyon. These sightings suggest that they may live shallower than previously thought, at least at the southern end of their range, where colder, better-oxygenated water is available at shallower depths.

The geographical range of the Indonesia coelacanth, &quot;Latimeria menadoensis&quot;, is believed to be off the coast of Manado Tua Island, Sulawesi, Indonesia, in the Celebes Sea. Key components confining coelacanths to these areas are food and temperature restrictions, as well as ecological requirements such as caves and crevices that are well-suited for drift feeding. Teams of researchers using submersibles have recorded live sightings of the fish in the Sulawesi Sea as well as in the waters of Biak in Papua.

Anjouan Island and the Grande Comore provide ideal underwater cave habitats for coelacanths. The islands&#x27; underwater volcanic slopes, steeply eroded and covered in sand, house a system of caves and crevices which allow coelacanths resting places during the daylight hours. These islands support a large benthic fish population that helps to sustain coelacanth populations.

During the daytime, coelacanths rest in caves anywhere from deep. Others migrate to deeper waters. The cooler waters (below ) reduce the coelacanths&#x27; metabolic costs. Drifting toward reefs and night feeding saves vital energy. Resting in caves during the day also saves energy that otherwise would be expended to fight currents.
==Behavior==
Coelacanth locomotion is unique. To move around they most commonly take advantage of up- or down-wellings of current and drift. Their paired fins stabilize movement through the water. While on the ocean floor, they do not use the paired fins for any kind of movement. Coelacanths generate thrust with their caudal fins for quick starts. Due to the abundance of its fins, the coelacanth has high maneuverability and can orient its body in almost any direction in the water. They have been seen doing headstands as well as swimming belly up. It is thought that the rostral organ helps give the coelacanth electroreception, which aids in movement around obstacles.

Coelacanths are fairly peaceful when encountering others of their kind. They do avoid body contact, however, withdrawing immediately if contact occurs. When approached by foreign potential predators (e.g. a submersible), they show panic flight reactions, suggesting that coelacanths are most likely prey to large deepwater predators. Shark bite marks have been seen on coelacanths; sharks are common in areas inhabited by coelacanths. Electrophoresis testing of 14 coelacanth enzymes shows little genetic diversity between coelacanth populations. Among the fish that have been caught were about equal numbers of males and females. Population estimates range from 210 individuals per population to 500 per population. Because coelacanths have individual color markings, scientists think that they recognize other coelacanths via electric communication.

===Feeding===
Coelacanths are nocturnal piscivores that feed mainly on benthic smaller fish and various cephalopods. They are &quot;passive drift feeders&quot;, slowly drifting along currents with only minimal self-propulsion, eating whatever prey they encounter. Coelacanths also use their rostral organ for its electroreception to be able to detect nearby prey in low light settings.

== Life history ==
Coelacanths are ovoviviparous, meaning that the female retains the fertilized eggs within her body while the embryos develop during a gestation period of five years. Typically, females are larger than the males; their scales and the skin folds around the cloaca differ. The male coelacanth has no distinct copulatory organs, just a cloaca, which has a urogenital papilla surrounded by erectile caruncles. It is hypothesized that the cloaca everts to serve as a copulatory organ.

Coelacanth eggs are large, with only a thin layer of membrane to protect them. Embryos hatch within the female and eventually are born alive, which is a rarity in fish. This was only discovered when the American Museum of Natural History dissected its first coelacanth specimen in 1975 and found it pregnant with five embryos. Young coelacanths resemble the adult, the main differences being an external yolk sac, larger eyes relative to body size and a more pronounced downward slope of the body. The juvenile coelacanth&#x27;s broad yolk sac hangs below the pelvic fins. The scales and fins of the juvenile are completely matured; however, it does lack odontodes, which it gains during maturation.

A study that assessed the paternity of the embryos inside two coelacanth females indicated that each clutch was sired by a single male. This could mean that females mate monandrously, i.e. with one male only. Polyandry, female mating with multiple males, is common in both plants and animals and can be advantageous (e.g. insurance against mating with an infertile or incompatible mate), but also confers costs (increased risk of infection, danger of falling prey to predators, increased energy input when searching for new males).

== Conservation ==
Because little is known about the coelacanth, the conservation status is difficult to characterize. According to Fricke et al. (1995), it is important to conserve the species. From 1988 to 1994, Fricke counted some 60 individuals of &quot;L. chalumnae&quot; on each dive. In 1995 that number dropped to 40. Even though this could be a result of natural population fluctuation, it also could be a result of overfishing. The IUCN currently classifies &quot;L. chalumnae&quot; as &quot;critically endangered&quot;, with a total population size of 500 or fewer individuals. &quot;L. menadoensis&quot; is considered Vulnerable, with a significantly larger population size (fewer than 10,000 individuals).

The major threat towards the coelacanth is the accidental capture by fishing operations, especially commercial deep-sea trawling. Coelacanths usually are caught when local fishermen are fishing for oilfish. Fishermen sometimes snag a coelacanth instead of an oilfish because they traditionally fish at night, when oilfish (and coelacanths) feed.
Before scientists became interested in coelacanths, they were thrown back into the water if caught. Now that they are recognized as important, fishermen trade them to scientists or other officials. Before the 1980s, this was a problem for coelacanth populations. In the 1980s, international aid gave fiberglass boats to the local fishermen, which moved fishing beyond the coelacanth territories into more productive waters. Since then, most of the motors on the boats failed, forcing the fishermen back into coelacanth territory and putting the species at risk again.

Methods to minimize the number of coelacanths caught include moving fishers away from the shore, using different laxatives and malarial salves to reduce the demand for oilfish, using coelacanth models to simulate live specimens, and increasing awareness of the need for conservation. In 1987 the Coelacanth Conservation Council advocated the conservation of coelacanths. The CCC has branches located in Comoros, South Africa, Canada, the United Kingdom, the U.S., Japan, and Germany. The agencies were established to help protect and encourage population growth of coelacanths.

A &quot;deep release kit&quot; was developed in 2014 and distributed by private initiative, consisting of a weighted hook assembly that allows a fisherman to return an accidentally caught coelacanth to deep waters where the hook can be detached once it hits the seafloor. Conclusive reports about the effectiveness of this method are still pending.

In 2002, the South African Coelacanth Conservation and Genome Resource Programme was launched to help further the studies and conservation of the coelacanth. This program focuses on biodiversity conservation, evolutionary biology, capacity building, and public understanding. The South African government committed to spending R10 million on the program. In 2011, a plan was made for a Tanga Coelacanth Marine Park to conserve biodiversity for marine animals including the coelacanth. The park was designed to reduce habitat destruction and improve prey availability for endangered species.

== Human consumption ==
Coelacanths are considered a poor source of food for humans and likely most other fish-eating animals. Coelacanth flesh has large amounts of oil, urea, wax esters, and other compounds that give the flesh a distinctly unpleasant flavor, make it difficult to digest, and can cause diarrhea. Their scales themselves secrete mucus, which combined with the excessive oil their bodies produce, make coelacanths a slimy food. Where the coelacanth is more common, local fishermen avoid it because of its potential to sicken consumers. As a result, the coelacanth has no real commercial value apart from being coveted by museums and private collectors.

==Cultural significance==
Because of the surprising nature of the coelacanth&#x27;s discovery, they have been a frequent source of inspiration in modern artwork, craftsmanship, and literature. At least 22 countries have depicted them on their postage stamps, particularly the Comoros, which has issued 12 different sets of coelacanth stamps. The coelacanth is also depicted on the 1000 Comorian franc banknote, as well as the 5 CF coin.

In the &quot;Pokémon&quot; media franchise, the Pokémon known as Relicanth is based on the coelacanth.

In the video game series &quot;Animal Crossing&quot;, the coelacanth is a rare fish that can be caught by the player by fishing in the ocean.

<text>UNCF, the United Negro College Fund, also known as the United Fund, is an American philanthropic organization that funds scholarships for black students and general scholarship funds for 37 private historically black colleges and universities. UNCF was incorporated on April 25, 1944, by Frederick D. Patterson (then president of what is now Tuskegee University), Mary McLeod Bethune, and others. UNCF is headquartered at 1805 7th Street, NW in Washington, D.C. In 2005, UNCF supported approximately 65,000 students at over 900 colleges and universities with approximately $113 million in grants and scholarships. About 60% of these students are the first in their families to attend college, and 62% have annual family incomes of less than $25,000. UNCF also administers over 450 named scholarships.

UNCF&#x27;s president and chief executive officer is Michael Lomax. Past presidents of the UNCF included William H. Gray and Vernon Jordan.

==Scholarships==
Though founded to address funding inequities in education resources for African Americans, UNCF-administered scholarships are open to all ethnicities; the great majority of recipients are still African-American. It provides scholarships to students attending its member colleges as well as to those going elsewhere.

Graduates of UNCF member institutions and scholarships have included many Black people in the fields of business, politics, health care and the arts. Some prominent UNCF alumni include: Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and leader in the civil rights movement; Alexis Herman, former U.S. Secretary of Labor; movie director Spike Lee; actor Samuel L. Jackson; General Chappie James, the U.S. Air Force’s first black four-star general; and Dr. David Satcher, a former U.S. Surgeon General and director of the Centers for Disease Control.
==History==

In 1944 William J. Trent, a long-time activist for education for black people, joined with Tuskegee Institute President Frederick D. Patterson and Mary McLeod Bethune to found the UNCF, a nonprofit that united college presidents to raise money collectively through an &quot;appeal to the national conscience&quot;. As the first executive director from the organization&#x27;s start in 1944 until 1964, Trent raised $78 million for historically Black colleges so they could become &quot;strong citadels of learning, carriers of the American dream, seedbeds of social evolution and revolution&quot;. In 2008, reflecting shifting attitudes toward the word Negro in its name, the UNCF shifted from using its full name to using only its initials, releasing a new logo with the initials alone and featuring their slogan more prominently.

== Fundraising and the Lou Rawls Parade of Stars ==
The UNCF has received charitable donations for its scholarship programs. One of the more high-profile donations made was by then-senator and future U.S. President John F. Kennedy who donated the money from the Pulitzer Prize for his book &quot;Profiles in Courage&quot; to the Fund. Another significant donation was made in 1990 by Walter Annenberg, who donated $50 million to the fund.

Beginning in 1980, singer Lou Rawls began the &quot;Lou Rawls Parade of Stars&quot; telethon to benefit the UNCF. The annual event, now known as &quot;An Evening of Stars&quot;, consists of stories of successful African-American students who have graduated or benefited from one of the many historically black colleges and universities and who received support from the UNCF. The telethon featured comedy and musical performances from various artists in support of the UNCF&#x27;s and Rawls&#x27; efforts. The event has raised over $200 million in 27 shows for the fund through 2006.

In January 2004, Rawls was honored by the United Negro College Fund for his more than 25 years of charity work with the organization. Instead of Rawls&#x27; hosting and performing, he was given the seat of honor and celebrated by his performing colleagues, including Stevie Wonder, The O&#x27;Jays, Gerald Levert, Ashanti, and several others. Before his death in January 2006, Rawls&#x27; last performance was a taping for the 2006 telethon that honored Wonder, months before entering the hospital after being diagnosed with cancer earlier in the year.

In addition to the telethon, there are a number of other fundraising activities, including the &quot;Walk for Education&quot; held annually in Los Angeles, California, which includes a five kilometer walk/run. In Houston, Texas, the Cypresswood Golf Club hosts an annual golf tournament in April.

In 2014, Koch Industries Inc. and the Charles Koch Foundation made a $25 million grant to UNCF. In protest of the Kochs, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, a major labor union, ended its yearly $50,000–60,000 support for UNCF.

In June 2020, Netflix founder Reed Hastings donated $120 million to the UNCF to be used as scholarship funds for students enrolled at UNCF institutions. His donation was the largest in UNCF history.

==The UNCF motto==
In 1972, the UNCF adopted as its motto the maxim &quot;A mind is a terrible thing to waste.&quot; This maxim has become one of the most widely recognized slogans in advertising history. The motto was notably mangled in a 1989 address to the organization by then–Vice President of the United States Dan Quayle, who stated: &quot;And you take the U.N.C.F. model that what a waste it is to lose one&#x27;s mind or not to have a mind is being very wasteful. How true that is.&quot;
The motto, which has been used in numerous award-winning UNCF ad campaigns, was created by Forest Long, of the advertising agency Young &amp; Rubicam, in partnership with the Ad Council.

A lesser-known slogan the UNCF also uses, in reference to its intended beneficiaries, points out that they&#x27;re &quot;not asking for a handout, just a hand.&quot;

<doc id="45506" wikidata="Q238651" url="?curid=45506" title="World peace">
<text>World peace is the concept of an ideal state of peace within and among all people and nations on Earth. Different cultures, religions, philosophies, and organizations have varying concepts on how such a state would come about.

Various religious and secular organizations have the stated aim of achieving world peace through addressing human rights, technology, education, engineering, medicine, or diplomacy used as an end to all forms of fighting. Since 1945, the United Nations and the five permanent members of its Security Council (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States) have operated under the aim to resolve conflicts without war. Nonetheless, nations have entered numerous military conflicts since then.

==Theories==
Many theories as to how world peace could be achieved have been proposed. Several of these are listed below.

===Capitalism peace theory===
Capitalist, or commercial peace, forms one of the three planks of Kantian peace, together with democratic peace theory and institutionalist arguments for peace. Although the evidence is inconclusive, various scholars have argued for capitalist peace. For instance, in her essay &quot;The Roots of War&quot;, Ayn Rand held that the major wars of history were started by the more controlled economies of the time against the freer ones and that capitalism gave mankind the longest period of peace in history—a period during which there were no wars involving the entire civilized world—from the end of the Napoleonic wars in 1815 to the outbreak of World War I in 1914, with the exceptions of the Franco-Prussian War (1870), the Spanish–American War (1898), the Crimean War (1853–1856), the Boer Wars (1880–1881, 1899–1902), and the American Civil War (1861–1865).

===Cobdenism===
Proponents of Cobdenism claim that by removing tariffs and creating international free trade, wars would become impossible because free trade prevents a nation from becoming self-sufficient, which is a requirement for long wars.

However, free trade does not prevent a nation from establishing some sort of emergency plan to become temporarily self-sufficient in case of war or that a nation could simply acquire what it needs from a different nation. A good example of this is World War I, during which both Britain and Germany became partially self-sufficient. This is particularly important because Germany had no plan for creating a war economy.

===Democratic peace theory===
Proponents of democratic peace theory, developed mainly in the 1960s but relying in part on eighteenth century Kantian theory, and frequently espoused by Western politicians, claim that strong empirical evidence exists that democracies never or rarely wage war against each other. However, several wars between democracies have taken place, historically, such as the Kargil War and the Cenepa War. Relevant issues of debate include whether sufficient data is available to statistically prove the theory and whether peace results in democracy (territorial peace theory) or vice versa.

===Economic norms theory===
Michael Mousseau&#x27;s economic norms theory links economic conditions with institutions of governance and conflict, distinguishing personal clientelist economies from impersonal market-oriented ones, identifying the latter with permanent peace within and between nations.

Throughout most of human history, societies have been based on personal relations: individuals in groups know each other and exchange favours. Today in most lower-income societies hierarchies of groups distribute wealth based on personal relationships among group leaders, a process often linked with clientelism and corruption. Michael Mousseau argues that in this kind of socio-economy conflict is always present, latent or overt, because individuals depend on their groups for physical and economic security and are thus loyal to their groups rather than their states, and because groups are in a constant state of conflict over access to state coffers. Through processes of bounded rationality, people are conditioned towards strong in-group identities and are easily swayed to fear outsiders, psychological predispositions that make possible sectarian violence, genocide, and terrorism.

Market-oriented socio-economics are integrated not with personal ties but the impersonal force of the market where most individuals are economically dependent on trusting strangers in contracts enforced by the state. This creates loyalty to a state that enforces the rule of law and contracts impartially and reliably and provides equal protection in the freedom to contract – that is, liberal democracy. Wars cannot happen within or between nations with market-integrated economies because war requires the harming of others, and in these kinds of economies, everyone is always economically better off when others in the market are also better off, not worse off. Rather than fight, citizens in market-oriented socio-economies care deeply about everyone&#x27;s rights and welfare, so they demand economic growth at home and economic cooperation and human rights abroad. Nations with market-oriented socio-economies tend to agree on global issues and not a single fatality has occurred in any dispute between them.

Economic norms theory should not be confused with classical liberal theory. The latter assumes that markets are natural and that freer markets promote wealth. In contrast, Economic norms theory shows how market-contracting is a learned norm, and state spending, regulation, and redistribution are necessary to ensure that almost everyone can participate in the &quot;social market&quot; economy, which is in everyone&#x27;s interests.

===Marxism: World peace via world revolution===

According to the dialectical materialist theory of Karl Marx, humanity under capitalism is divided into just two classes: the proletariat—who do not possess the means of production, and the bourgeoisie—who do possess the means of production. Once the communist revolution occurs and consequently abolishes the private propriety of the means of production, humanity will not be divided and the tension created between these two classes will cease.

===Deterrence===

Mutual assured destruction (MAD) is a doctrine of military strategy based on rational deterrence in which a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by two opposing sides would effectively result in the destruction of both belligerents. Proponents of the policy of MAD, which as a term was coined in 1962 during the Cold War, attributed this to the increase in the lethality of war to the point where it no longer offers the possibility of a net gain for either side (a form of Nash equilibrium), thereby making wars pointless.

===Peace through strength===
The term Peace through strength is traced back to the Roman Emperor Hadrian (reigned CE 117 – 138), but the concept is older. In the Indian epic &quot;Ramayana&quot; (7th to 4th centuries BCE) Lord Rama is quoted as saying &quot;Bhay Bin Hoye na Preet&quot;, meaning once prayers for peace fail, one may need to instill fear to bring peace. In 1943, at the peak of World War II, the founder of the Paneuropean Union, Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi, argued that after the war the United States (U.S.) was bound to take &quot;command of the skies&quot; to ensure the lasting world peace:

In fact, near the entrance to the headquarters of the U.S. Strategic Air Command at Offutt Air Force Base stands a large sign with a SAC emblem and its motto: &quot;Peace is our profession.&quot; The motto &quot;was a staggering paradox that was also completely accurate&quot;. One SAC Bomber—Convair B-36—is called &quot;Peacemaker&quot; and one inter-continental missile-LGM-118-&quot;Peacekeeper&quot;.

In 2016, former U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter envisaged that the re-balance to the Asia-Pacific will make the region &quot;peaceful&quot; through &quot;strength&quot;:

Introduction to US National Security and Defense Strategies of 2018 states: The US force posture combined with the allies will &quot;preserve peace through strength&quot;. The document proceeds to detail what &quot;achieving peace through strength requires&quot;.

=== Territorial peace theory ===
Proponents of the territorial peace theory claim that countries with stable borders are likely to develop democracy, while wars and territorial threats foster authoritarian attitudes and a disregard for democracy. Increasing attention has been paid to the theory since the early 2000s, and it has increasingly informed democratic peace theory and been espoused in the cause of peacebuilding and international relations. Proponents of democratic peace theory counter argue that stable borders resulting from dispute arbitration or negotiation rather than force via autocracy are more likely to be obtained by democratic states. Efforts are underway to synthesize the two theories.

== Efforts ==

=== United Nations Charter and international law ===
After World War II, the United Nations was established by the United Nations Charter to &quot;save successive generations from the scourge of war which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind&quot; (Preamble). The Preamble to the United Nations Charter also aims to further the adoption of fundamental human rights, to respect obligations to sources of international law as well as to unite the strength of independent countries to maintain international peace and security. All treaties on international human rights law refer to or consider &quot;the principles proclaimed in the Charter of the United Nations, recognition of the inherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and &quot;peace in the world&quot;.

==== International Day of Peace ====
The United Nations International Day of Peace, sometimes called World Peace Day, is observed annually on 21 September. It is dedicated to peace, and specifically the absence of war and violence, and can be celebrated by a temporary ceasefire in a combat zone. The International Day of Peace was established in 1981 by the United Nations General Assembly. Two decades later, in 2001, the General Assembly unanimously voted to designate the day as a day of preventing violence and a cease-fire. The celebration of this day is recognized by many nations and people. In 2013, for the first time, the day has been dedicated to peace education, i.e. by the key preventive means to reduce war sustainably.

=== Constitution for the Federation of Earth ===
Considering the UN&#x27;s design as a forum and its lack of direct power or authority over nations, it has received a fair amount of criticism and since its foundation, prominent world figures have expressed their concerns and called for the establishment of a democratic federal world government. It is in that response, in early 1960s, the most comprehensive effort was made to draft a world constitution. Thane Read and Philip Isely drafted a form of agreement that aimed to admit delegates from both national governments and the people of all countries for a world constitutional convention. A worldwide call for a World Constitutional Convention was sent, and thousands of world figures and five national governments signed the call. In result of that, the World Constitutional Convention and the Peoples World Parliament were held in Interlaken, Switzerland, and Wolfach, Germany, in 1968. Over 200 participants from 27 countries attended these sessions, where the drafting of a constitution for a global federal world government began. The second session of the World Constituent Assembly took place in Innsbruck, Austria, in 1977. And after extensive discussions and amendments, the draft constitution was unanimously adopted as the &quot;Constitution for the Federation of Earth&quot;. It was further amended in the 3rd Constituent Assembly, Colombo, Sri Lanka, 1978-79 and the 4th World Constituent Assembly, Troia, Portugal, in 1991.

This constitution outlines a detailed plan for a world federalist government and awaits ratification by the people and nations of the world. It includes the protection of universal human rights, prevention of war, secure disarmament, social development, protection of the environment, and addresses many more global challenges. 

A Provisional World Parliament (PWP), a transitional international legislative body, operates under the framework of the Constitution for the Federation of Earth. It convenes to work on global issues, gathering delegates from different countries.

==Religious views==
Many religions and religious leaders have expressed a desire for an end to violence.

===Baháʼí Faith===

The central aim of the Baháʼí Faith is the establishment of the unity of the peoples of the world. Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh, the founder of the Baháʼí Faith, stated in no uncertain terms, &quot;the fundamental purpose animating the Faith of God and His Religion is to safeguard the interests and promote the unity of the human race ...&quot;. In his writings, Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh described two distinct stages of world peace – a lesser peace and a sense of most great peace.

The lesser peace is essentially a collective security agreement between the nations of the world. In this arrangement, nations agree to protect one another by rising up against an aggressor nation, should it seek the usurpation of territory or the destruction of its neighbors. The lesser peace is limited in scope and is concerned with the establishment of basic order and the universal recognition of national borders and the sovereignty of nations. Baháʼís believe that the lesser peace is taking place largely through the operation of the Divine Will and that Baháʼí influence on the process is relatively minor.

The greatest peace is the eventual end goal of the lesser peace and is envisioned as a time of spiritual and social unity – a time when the peoples of the world genuinely identify with and care for one another, rather than simply tolerating one other&#x27;s existence. The Baháʼís view this process as taking place largely as a result of the spread of Baháʼí teachings, principles, and practices throughout the world. The larger world peace process and its foundational elements are addressed in the document &quot;The Promise of World Peace&quot;, written by the Universal House of Justice.
===Buddhism===

Many Buddhists believe that world peace can only be achieved if individuals establish peace within their minds first. The Buddha&#x27;s teachings emphasize that anger and other negative states of mind are the cause of wars and conflict. Buddhists believe people can live in peace and harmony only if they abandon negative emotions such as anger and cultivate positive emotions such as loving-kindness and compassion. As with all Dharmic religions (Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, and Sikhism), ahimsa (avoidance of violence) is a central concept.

Peace pagodas are monuments that are built to symbolize and inspire world peace and have been central to the peace movement throughout the years. These are typical of Buddhist origin, being built by the Japanese Buddhist organization Nipponzan Myohoji. They exist around the world in cities such as London, Vienna, New Delhi, Tokyo, and Lumbini.

===Christianity===

The basic Christian ideal specifies that peace can only come by the Word and love of God, which is perfectly demonstrated in the life of Christ:

As christologically interpreted from , whereupon the &quot;Word of the Lord&quot; is established on the earth, the material human-political result will be &#x27;nation not taking up sword against nation; nor will they train for war anymore&#x27;. Christian world peace necessitates the living of a proactive life replete with all good works indirect light of the Word of God. The details of such a life can be observed in the Gospels, especially the historically renowned Sermon on the Mount, where forgiving those who do wrong things against oneself is advocated among other pious precepts.

However, not all Christians expect a lasting world peace on this earth:

Many Christians believe that world peace is expected to be manifest upon the &quot;new earth&quot; that is promised in Christian scripture such as .

The Roman Catholic religious conception of &quot;Consecration of Russia&quot;, related to the Church&#x27;s high-priority Fátima Marian apparitions, promises a temporary &quot;world peace&quot; as a result of this process being fulfilled, though before the coming of the Antichrist. This period of temporary peace is called &quot;the triumph of the Immaculate Heart&quot;.

Pacifist religious groups that are related to Christianity include Quakers, the Amish, and Mennonites. These groups are known for advocating religious nonviolence, and their adherents are often conscientious objectors.

===Hinduism===

Traditionally, Hinduism has adopted an ancient Sanskrit phrase &quot;Vasudhaiva kutumbakam&quot;, which translates as &quot;The world is one family&quot;. The essence of this concept is the observation that only base minds see dichotomies and divisions. The more we seek wisdom, the more we become inclusive and free our internal spirit from worldly illusions or &quot;Maya&quot;. World peace is hence only achieved through internal means—by liberating ourselves from artificial boundaries that separate us all. As with all Dharmic Religions, (Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, and Sikhism), ahimsa (avoidance of violence) is a central concept.

===Islam===
According to Islamic eschatology, the whole world will be united under the leadership of imam Mahdi. At that time love, justice and peace will be so abundant that the world will be in the likeness of paradise.

===Judaism===
Judaism is not a pacifist religion. However, the concept of &quot;Tikkun olam&quot; (Repairing the World) is central to modern Rabbinic Judaism. &quot;Tikkun Olam&quot; is accomplished through various means, such as ritualistically performing God&#x27;s commandments, charity, and social justice, as well as through example persuading the rest of the world to behave morally. According to some views, &quot;Tikkun Olam&quot; would result at the beginning of the Messianic Age. It has been said that in every generation, a person is born with the potential to be the spiritual Messiah. If the time is right for the Messianic Age within that person&#x27;s lifetime, then that person will be the Mashiach. But if that person dies before he completes the mission of the Messiah, then that person is not the Messiah (Mashiach).

Specifically, in Jewish messianism it is considered that at some future time a &quot;Messiah&quot; (literally &quot;an anointed King appointed by God&quot;) will rise up to bring all Jews back to the Land of Israel, and to establish God&#x27;s Torah, followed by everlasting global peace and prosperity. This idea originates from passages in the Hebrew Bible and the Talmud.
===Jainism===
Compassion for all life, human and non-human, is central to Jainism. They have adopted the wordings of Lord Mahavira Jiyo our Jeeno Do. Human life is valued as a unique, rare opportunity to reach enlightenment; to kill any person, no matter what crime he may have committed, is considered unimaginably abhorrent. It is a religion that requires monks and laity, from all its sects and traditions, to be vegetarian. Some Indian regions, such as Gujarat, have been strongly influenced by Jains and often the majority of the local Hindus of every denomination have also become vegetarian. Famous quote on world peace as per Jainism by a 19th-century Indian legend, Virchand Gandhi: &quot;May peace rule the universe; may peace rule in kingdoms and empires; may peace rule in states and in the lands of the potentates; may peace rule in the house of friends and may peace also rule in the house of enemies.&quot; As with all Dharmic religions (Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, and Sikhism), ahimsa (avoidance of violence) is a central concept.

===Sikhism===

The Sikh religion preaches that peace comes from God. However, pacifism is not absolute in Sikh religion, and Sikhs have taken military action against oppression.

Sikh people believe that meditation, the means of communicating with God, is unfruitful without the noble character of a devotee, as there can be no worship without performing good deeds. Guru Nanak stressed now &quot;kirat karō&quot;: that a Sikh should balance work, worship, and charity, and should defend the rights of all creatures, and in particular, fellow human beings. They are encouraged to have a &quot;chaṛdī kalā&quot;, or &quot;optimistic&quot; – &quot;resilience&quot;, view of life. Sikh teachings also stress the concept of sharing—&quot;vaṇḍ chakkō&quot;—through the distribution of free food at Sikh gurdwaras (&quot;langar&quot;), giving charitable donations, and working for the good of the community and others (&quot;sēvā&quot;). Sikhs believe that no matter what race, sex, or religion one is, all are equal in God&#x27;s eyes. Men and women are equal and share the same rights, and women can lead prayers. As with all Dharmic religions (Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, and Sikhism), ahimsa (avoidance of violence) is a central concept.

<text>The treeshrews (also called tree shrews or banxrings) are small mammals native to the tropical forests of South and Southeast Asia. They make up the entire order Scandentia (from Latin &quot;scandere&quot;, &quot;to climb&quot;), which split into two families: the Tupaiidae (19 species, &quot;ordinary&quot; treeshrews), and the Ptilocercidae (one species, the pen-tailed treeshrew).

Though called &#x27;treeshrews&#x27;, and despite having previously been classified in Insectivora, they are not true shrews, and not all species live in trees. They are omnivores; among other things, treeshrews eat fruit. As fellow members of Euarchonta, treeshrews are closely related to primates, and have been used as an alternative to primates in experimental studies of myopia, psychosocial stress, and hepatitis.

==Description==
Treeshrews are slender animals with long tails and soft, greyish to reddish-brown fur. The terrestrial species tend to be larger than the arboreal forms, and to have larger claws, which they use for digging up insect prey. They have poorly developed canine teeth and unspecialised molars, with an overall dental formula of They have a higher brain to body mass ratio than any other mammal, including humans, but high ratios are not uncommon for animals weighing less than .

Treeshrews have good vision, which is binocular in the case of the more arboreal species.

== Reproduction ==
Female treeshrews have a gestation period of 45–50 days and give birth to up to three young in nests lined with dry leaves inside tree hollows. The young are born blind and hairless, but are able to leave the nest after about a month. During this period, the mother provides relatively little maternal care, visiting her young only for a few minutes every other day to suckle them.

Treeshrews reach sexual maturity after around four months, and breed for much of the year, with no clear breeding season in most species.

==Behavior==
Treeshrews live in small family groups, which defend their territory from intruders. Most are diurnal, although the pen-tailed treeshrew is nocturnal.

They mark their territories using various scent glands or urine, depending on the particular species.

==Diet==
Treeshrews are omnivorous, feeding on insects, small vertebrates, fruit, and seeds. Among other things, treeshrews eat &quot;Rafflesia&quot; fruit.

The pen-tailed treeshrew in Malaysia is able to consume large amounts of naturally fermented nectar from flower buds of the bertam palm &quot;Eugeissona tristis&quot; (with up to 3.8% alcohol content) the entire year without it having any effects on behaviour.

Treeshrews have also been observed intentionally eating foods high in capsaicin, a behavior unique among mammals other than humans. A single TRPV1 mutation reduces their pain response to capsaicinoids, which scientists believe is an evolutionary adaptation to be able to consume spicy foods in their natural habitats.
Pitcher plants like the &quot;Nepenthes lowii&quot;, supplements its carnivorous diet with tree shrew droppings.


== Taxonomy ==
Treeshrews were moved from the order Insectivora into the order Primates because of certain internal similarities to primates (for example, similarities in the brain anatomy, highlighted by Sir Wilfrid Le Gros Clark), and classified as a &quot;primitive prosimian&quot;, however they were soon split from the primates and moved into their own order. Taxonomists continue to refine the treeshrews&#x27; relations to primates and to other closely related clades.

Molecular phylogenetic studies have suggested that the treeshrews, with the primates and the flying lemurs (colugos), belong to the grandorder Euarchonta. According to this classification, the Euarchonta are sister to the Glires (lagomorphs and rodents), and the two groups are combined into the superorder Euarchontoglires. However, the alternative placement of treeshrews as sister to both Glires and Primatomorpha cannot be ruled out. Some studies place Scandentia as sister of the Glires, which would invalidate Euarchonta: It is this organization that is shown in the tree diagram below.

Several other arrangements of these orders have been proposed in the past, and the above tree is only a well-favored proposal. Although it is known that Scandentia is one of the most basal euarchontoglire clades, the exact phylogenetic position is not yet considered resolved: It may be a sister of Glires, Primatomorpha, or Dermoptera, or separate from and sister to all other Euarchontoglires. Shared short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) offer strong evidence for Scandentia belonging to the Euarchonta group:

===Order Scandentia===

The 23 species are placed in four genera, which are divided into two families. The majority are in the &quot;ordinary&quot; treeshrew family, Tupaiidae, but one species, the pen-tailed treeshrew, is different enough to warrant placement in its own family, Ptilocercidae; the two families are thought to have separated 60 million years ago. The former Tupaiidae genus &quot;Urogale&quot; was disbanded in 2011 when the Mindanao treeshrew was moved to &quot;Tupaia&quot; based on a molecular phylogeny.

;Family Tupaiidae:
*Genus &quot;Anathana&quot;
** Madras treeshrew, &quot;A. ellioti&quot;

*Genus &quot;Dendrogale&quot;
** Bornean smooth-tailed treeshrew, &quot;D. melanura&quot;

** Large treeshrew, &quot;T. tana&quot;

;Family Ptilocercidae:
*Genus &quot;Ptilocercus&quot;
** Pen-tailed treeshrew, &quot;P. lowii&quot;

== Fossil record ==
The fossil record of treeshrews is poor. The oldest putative treeshrew, &quot;Eodendrogale parva&quot;, is from the Middle Eocene of Henan, China, but the identity of this animal is uncertain. Other fossils have come from the Miocene of Thailand, Pakistan, India, and Yunnan, China, as well as the Pliocene of India. Most belong to the family Tupaiidae; one fossil species described from the Oligocene of Yunnan is thought to be closer to the pen-tailed treeshrew.

Named fossil species include &quot;Prodendrogale yunnanica&quot;, &quot;Prodendrogale engesseri&quot;, and &quot;Tupaia storchi&quot; from Yunnan, &quot;Tupaia miocenica&quot; from Thailand, &quot;Palaeotupaia sivalicus&quot; from India and &quot;Ptilocercus kylin&quot; from Yunnan.

<text>In economics, a free good is a good that is not scarce, and therefore is available without limit. A free good is available in as great a quantity as desired with zero opportunity cost to society.

A good that is made available at zero price is not necessarily a free good. For example, a shop might give away its stock in its promotion, but producing these goods would still have required the use of scarce resources.

Examples of free goods are ideas and works that are reproducible at zero cost, or almost zero cost. For example, if someone invents a new device, many people could copy this invention, with no danger of this &quot;resource&quot; running out. 

Earlier schools of economic thought stated that resources that are enough for everyone to have as much as they want are free goods. Examples in textbooks included seawater and air.

Intellectual property laws such as copyrights and patents have the effect of converting some intangible goods to scarce goods. Even though these works are free goods by definition and can be reproduced at minimal cost, the production of these works does require scarce resources, such as skilled labour. Thus these laws are used to give exclusive rights to the creators, in order to encourage resources to be appropriately allocated to these activities.

Futurists like Jeremy Rifkin theorize that advanced nanotechnology with the ability to turn any kind of material automatically into any other combination of equal mass will make all goods essentially free goods, since all raw materials and manufacturing time will become perfectly interchangeable.

<text>The seven deadly sins (also known as the capital vices or cardinal sins) function as a grouping classification of major vices within the teachings of Christianity. According to the standard list, the seven deadly sins in Roman Catholic Church are pride, greed, wrath, envy, lust, gluttony, and sloth. 

In Catholicism, the classification of deadly sins into a group of seven originated with Tertullian, and continued with Evagrius Ponticus. The concepts of the sins involved were in part based on Greco-Roman and Biblical antecedents. Later, the concept of seven deadly sins evolved further, based upon historical context based upon the Latin language of the Roman Catholic Church, though with a significant influence from the Greek language and associated religious traditions. Knowledge of the seven deadly sin concept is known through discussions in various treatises and also depictions in paintings and sculpture, for example architectural decorations on certain churches of certain Catholic parishes and also from certain older textbooks. Further information has been derived from patterns of confessions.

Subsequently, over the centuries into modern times, the idea of sins (especially seven in number) has influenced or inspired various streams of religious and philosophical thought, fine art painting, and modern popular culture media such as literature, film, and television.

== History ==
=== Origin of the currently recognized seven deadly sins ===
These &quot;evil thoughts&quot; can be categorized as follows:

* physical (thoughts produced by the nutritive, sexual, and acquisitive appetites)
* emotional (thoughts produced by depressive, irascible, or dismissive moods)
* mental (thoughts produced by jealous/envious, boastful, or hubristic states of mind)

The fourth-century monk Evagrius Ponticus reduced the nine &quot;logismoi&quot; to eight, as follows:

# () gluttony
# () prostitution, fornication
# () greed
# () sadness, rendered in the &quot;Philokalia&quot; as &quot;envy&quot;, sadness at another&#x27;s good fortune
# () wrath
# () acedia (apathy/neglect/indifference), rendered in the &quot;Philokalia&quot; as dejection
# () boasting
# () pride, sometimes rendered as &quot;self-overestimation&quot;, &quot;arrogance&quot;, or &quot;grandiosity&quot;

Evagrius&#x27;s list was translated into the Latin of Western Christianity in many writings of John Cassian, thus becoming part of the Western tradition&#x27;s spiritual pietas or Catholic devotions as follows:
# (gluttony)
# (lust, fornication)
# (greed)
# (sorrow, despair, despondency)
# (wrath)
# (sloth)
# (vanity vainglory)
# (pride)

In AD 590, Pope Gregory I revised the list to form a more common list. Gregory combined with and with , adding &quot;envy&quot;, which is in Latin. (It is interesting to note that Pope Gregory&#x27;s list corresponds exactly to the traits described in Pirkei Avot as &quot;removing one from the world.&quot; See Pirkei Avot 2:11, 3:10, 4:21 and the Vilna Gaon&#x27;s commentary to Aggadot Berakhot 4b.) Thomas Aquinas uses and defends Gregory&#x27;s list in his &quot;Summa Theologica&quot;, although he calls them the &quot;capital sins&quot; because they are the head and form of all the other sins. Christian denominations, such as the Anglican Communion, Lutheran Church, and Methodist Church, still retain this list, and modern evangelists such as Billy Graham have explicated the seven deadly sins.

==Historical and modern definitions, views, and associations==
According to Catholic prelate Henry Edward Manning, the seven deadly sins are seven ways of eternal death. The Lutheran divine Martin Chemnitz, who contributed to the development of Lutheran systematic theology, implored clergy to remind the faithful of the seven deadly sins.

Listed in order of increasing severity as per Pope Gregory I, 6th-century A.D., the seven deadly sins are as follows:

=== Lust ===
Lust or lechery is intense longing. It is usually thought of as intense or unbridled sexual desire, which may lead to fornication (including adultery, rape, bestiality), and other sinful and sexual acts; oftentimes, however, it can also mean other forms of unbridled desire, such as for money, or power. Henry Edward Manning explains that the impurity of lust transforms one into &quot;a slave of the devil&quot;.

Lust is generally thought to be the least serious capital sin. Thomas Aquinas considers it an abuse of a faculty that humans share with animals and sins of the flesh are less grievous than spiritual sins.

=== Gluttony ===


Gluttony is the overindulgence and overconsumption of anything to the point of waste. The word derives from the Latin , meaning to gulp down or swallow. One reason for its condemnation is that the gorging of the prosperous may leave the needy hungry.

Medieval church leaders such as Thomas Aquinas took a more expansive view of gluttony, arguing that it could also include an obsessive anticipation of meals and overindulgence in delicacies and costly foods. Aquinas also listed five forms of gluttony:

* – eating too expensively
* – eating too daintily
* – eating too much
* – eating too soon
* – eating too eagerly

=== Greed ===

In the words of Henry Edward Manning, avarice &quot;plunges a man deep into the mire of this world, so that he makes it to be his god&quot;.

As defined outside Christian writings, greed is an inordinate desire to acquire or possess more than one needs, especially with respect to material wealth. Aquinas considers that, like pride, it can lead to evil.

=== Sloth ===
Sloth refers to many related ideas, dating from antiquity and including mental, spiritual, pathological, and physical states. It may be defined as absence of interest or habitual disinclination to exertion.

In his &quot;Summa Theologica&quot;, Saint Thomas Aquinas defined sloth as &quot;sorrow about spiritual good&quot;.

The scope of sloth is wide. Spiritually, &quot;acedia&quot; first referred to an affliction attending religious persons, especially monks, wherein they became indifferent to their duties and obligations to God. Mentally, &quot;acedia&quot; has a number of distinctive components; the most important of these is affectlessness, a lack of any feeling about self or other, a mind-state that gives rise to boredom, rancor, apathy, and a passive inert or sluggish mentation. Physically, &quot;acedia&quot; is fundamentally associated with a cessation of motion and an indifference to work; it finds expression in laziness, idleness, and indolence.

Sloth includes ceasing to utilize the seven gifts of grace given by the Holy Spirit (Wisdom, Understanding, Counsel, Knowledge, Piety, Fortitude, and Fear of the Lord); such disregard may lead to the slowing of spiritual progress towards eternal life, the neglect of manifold duties of charity towards the neighbor, and animosity towards those who love God.

Unlike the other seven deadly sins, which are sins of committing immorality, sloth is a sin of omitting responsibilities. It may arise from any of the other capital vices; for example, a son may omit his duty to his father through anger. The state and habit of sloth is a mortal sin, while the habit of the soul tending towards the last mortal state of sloth is not mortal in and of itself except under certain circumstances.

Emotionally, and cognitively, the evil of &quot;acedia&quot; finds expression in a lack of any feeling for the world, for the people in it, or for the self. &quot;Acedia&quot; takes form as an alienation of the sentient self first from the world and then from itself. The most profound versions of this condition are found in a withdrawal from all forms of participation in or care for others or oneself, but a lesser yet more noisome element was also noted by theologians. Gregory the Great asserted that, &quot;from &quot;tristitia&quot;, there arise malice, rancour, cowardice, [and] despair&quot;. Chaucer also dealt with this attribute of &quot;acedia&quot;, counting the characteristics of the sin to include despair, somnolence, idleness, tardiness, negligence, laziness, and &quot;wrawnesse&quot;, the last variously translated as &quot;anger&quot; or better as &quot;peevishness&quot;. For Chaucer, human&#x27;s sin consists of languishing and holding back, refusing to undertake works of goodness because, they tell themselves, the circumstances surrounding the establishment of good are too grievous and too difficult to suffer. &quot;Acedia&quot; in Chaucer&#x27;s view is thus the enemy of every source and motive for work.

Sloth subverts the livelihood of the body, taking no care for its day-to-day provisions, and slows down the mind, halting its attention to matters of great importance. Sloth hinders the man in his righteous undertakings and thus becomes a terrible source of human&#x27;s undoing.

=== Wrath ===
Wrath can be defined as uncontrolled feelings of anger, rage, and even hatred. Wrath often reveals itself in the wish to seek vengeance.

According to the &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot;, the neutral act of anger becomes the sin of wrath when it is directed against an innocent person, when it is unduly strong or long-lasting, or when it desires excessive punishment. &quot;If anger reaches the point of a deliberate desire to kill or seriously wound a neighbor, it is gravely against charity; it is a mortal sin&quot;. Hatred is the sin of desiring that someone else may suffer misfortune or evil and is a mortal sin when one desires grave harm.

People feel angry when they sense that they or someone they care about has been offended, when they are certain about the nature and cause of the angering event, when they are certain someone else is responsible, and when they feel that they can still influence the situation or cope with it.

Henry Edward Manning considers that &quot;angry people are slaves to themselves&quot;.

=== Envy ===
Envy is characterized by an insatiable desire like greed and lust. It can be described as a sad or resentful covetousness towards the traits or possessions of someone else. It comes from vainglory and severs a man from his neighbor.

According to St. Thomas Aquinas, the struggle aroused by envy has three stages: during the first stage, the envious person attempts to lower another&#x27;s reputation; in the middle stage, the envious person receives either &quot;joy at another&#x27;s misfortune&quot; (if he succeeds in defaming the other person) or &quot;grief at another&#x27;s prosperity&quot; (if he fails); and the third stage is hatred because &quot;sorrow causes hatred&quot;.

Bertrand Russell said that envy was one of the most potent causes of unhappiness, bringing sorrow to committers of envy, while giving them the urge to inflict pain upon others.

=== Pride ===

Pride, also known as hubris (from Ancient Greek ) or futility, is considered the original and worst of the seven deadly sins on almost every list, the most demonic. It is also thought to be the source of the other capital sins. Pride is the opposite of humility.

C. S. Lewis writes in &quot;Mere Christianity&quot; that pride is the &quot;anti-God&quot; state, the position in which the ego and the self are directly opposed to God: &quot;Unchastity, anger, greed, drunkenness and all that, are mere fleabites in comparison: it was through Pride that Lucifer became wicked: Pride leads to every other vice: it is the complete anti-God state of mind.&quot; Pride is understood to sever the spirit from God, as well as His life-and-grace-giving Presence.

One can be prideful for different reasons. Author Ichabod Spencer states that &quot;spiritual pride is the worst kind of pride, if not worst snare of the devil. The heart is particularly deceitful on this one thing.&quot; Jonathan Edwards said: &quot;remember that pride is the worst viper that is in the heart, the greatest disturber of the soul&#x27;s peace and sweet communion with Christ; it was the first sin that ever was and lies lowest in the foundation of Lucifer&#x27;s whole building and is the most difficultly rooted out and is the most hidden, secret and deceitful of all lusts and often creeps in, insensibly, into the midst of religion and sometimes under the disguise of humility.&quot;

The modern use of pride may be summed up in the biblical proverb, &quot;Pride goeth before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall&quot; (abbreviated &quot;Pride goeth before a fall&quot;, Proverbs 16:18). The &quot;pride that blinds&quot; causes foolish actions against common sense. In political analysis, &quot;hubris&quot; is often used to describe how leaders with great power over many years become more and more irrationally self-confident and contemptuous of advice, leading them to act impulsively.

== Historical sins ==
=== Acedia ===
Acedia is the neglect to take care of something that one should do. It is translated to apathetic listlessness; depression without joy. It is related to melancholy; &quot;acedia&quot; describes the behaviour and &quot;melancholy&quot; suggests the emotion producing it. In early Christian thought, the lack of joy was regarded as a willful refusal to enjoy the goodness of God. By contrast, apathy was considered a refusal to help others in times of need.

Acēdia is the negative form of the Greek term (), which has a more restricted usage. &quot;Kēdeia&quot; refers specifically to spousal love and respect for the dead.

Pope Gregory combined this with &quot;tristitia&quot; into sloth for his list. When Thomas Aquinas described &quot;acedia&quot; in his interpretation of the list, he described it as an &quot;uneasiness of the mind&quot;, being a progenitor for lesser sins such as restlessness and instability.

Acedia is currently defined in the &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; as spiritual sloth, believing spiritual tasks to be too difficult. In the fourth century, Christian monks believed that acedia was primarily caused by a state of melancholia that caused spiritual detachment instead of laziness.

=== Vainglory ===

Vainglory is unjustified boasting. Pope Gregory viewed it as a form of pride, so he folded &quot;vainglory&quot; into pride for his listing of sins. It is the progenitor of envy.

The Latin term roughly means &quot;boasting&quot;, although its English cognate &quot;glory&quot; has come to have an exclusively positive meaning. Historically, the term &quot;vain&quot; roughly meant &quot;futile&quot; (a meaning retained in the modern expression &quot;in vain&quot;), but by the fourteenth century had come to have the strong narcissistic undertones which it still retains today.

== Confession patterns ==
According to a 2009 study by the Jesuit scholar Fr. Roberto Busa, the most common deadly sin confessed by men is lust and the most common deadly sin confessed by women is pride. It was unclear whether these differences were due to the actual number of transgressions committed by each sex or whether differing views on what &quot;counts&quot; or should be confessed caused the observed pattern.
