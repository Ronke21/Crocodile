<text>James White (7 April 1928 – 23 August 1999) was a Northern Irish author of science fiction novellas, short stories and novels. He was born in Belfast and returned there after spending some early years in Canada. After a few years working in the clothing industry, he worked at Short Brothers Ltd., an aircraft company based in Belfast, from 1965 until taking early retirement in 1984 as a result of diabetes. White married Margaret Sarah Martin, another science fiction fan, in 1955 and the couple had three children. He died of a stroke.

He became a fan of science fiction in 1941 and co-wrote two fan magazines, from 1948 to 1953 and 1952 to 1965. Encouraged by other fans, White began publishing short stories in 1953, and his first novel was published in 1957. His best-known novels were the twelve of the Sector General series, the first published in 1962 and the last after his death. White also published nine other novels, two of which were nominated for major awards, unsuccessfully.

White abhorred violence, and medical and other emergencies were the sources of dramatic tension in his stories. The &quot;Sector General&quot; series is regarded as defining the genre of medical science fiction, and as introducing a memorable crew of aliens. Although missing winning the most prestigious honours four times, White gained other awards for specific works and for contributions to science fiction. He was also Guest-of-Honour of several conventions.

==Biography==
James White was born to a Catholic family in Belfast, Northern Ireland, on 7 April 1928, and spent part of his early life in Canada. He was educated in Belfast at St. John&#x27;s Primary School (1935–1941) and St. Joseph&#x27;s Technical Secondary School (1942–1943). As a teenager he lived with foster parents. He wanted to study medicine but financial circumstances prevented this. Between 1943 and 1965 he worked for several Belfast tailoring firms and then as assistant manager of a Co-op department store. He married Margaret (&quot;Peggy&quot;) Sarah Martin, another science fiction fan, in 1955 and the couple had three children: daughter Patricia, and sons Martin and Peter. White later worked for the aeroplane builders Short Brothers Ltd. as a technical clerk (1965–1966), publicity assistant (1966–1968), and publicity officer (1968–1984).

He became a science fiction fan in 1941, attracted particularly by the works of E. E. &quot;Doc&quot; Smith, which featured good aliens as well as evil ones, and of Robert A. Heinlein, many of whose stories concern ordinary people. In 1947 he met another Irish fan, Walter A. (&quot;Walt&quot;) Willis, and the two helped to produce the fan magazines &quot;Slant&quot; (1948–1953) and &quot;Hyphen&quot; (1952–1965), which featured stories and articles by noted authors including John Brunner, A. Bertram Chandler, and Bob Shaw. In 2004 both White and Willis were nominated for the retrospective Hugo Award for Best Fan Writer of 1953, although neither won. White said that he started writing stories because the &quot;Slant&quot; team felt that &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; was too dominated by prophesies of nuclear doom, and his friends dared him to write the kind of story that they all liked to read. He said that getting published was fairly easy during the 1950s, as the World War II restrictions on paper were ended, and there were at least 12 science magazines in Britain and about 40 in the United States. His first published short story, &quot;Assisted Passage&quot;, a parody of 1950s Anglo-Australian emigration policies, appeared in the January 1953 edition of the magazine &quot;New Worlds&quot;. Further stories appeared in &quot;New Worlds&quot; during the next few years, but White&#x27;s attempt to access the more lucrative American market by submitting stories to &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; stalled after the publication of &quot;The Scavengers&quot;. White later said that his optimism about inter-species relations was unpalatable to &quot;Astounding&quot;&#x27;s xenophobic editor, John W. Campbell. As a result, White&#x27;s work was little-known outside the UK until the 1960s.

In 1957, Ace Books published White&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Secret Visitors&quot;, which included locations in Northern Ireland. The book had previously been serialised in &quot;New Worlds&quot; with the title &quot;Tourist Planet&quot;. Ace Books&#x27; science fiction editor, Donald A. Wollheim, thought the original ending was too tame and suggested that White should insert an all-out space battle just after the climactic courtroom scene. In November the same year &quot;New Worlds&quot; published White&#x27;s novelette &quot;Sector General&quot;, and editor John (&quot;Ted&quot;) Carnell requested more stories set in the same universe, founding the series for which White is known best. White gained &quot;a steady following&quot; for his &quot;scientifically accurate&quot; stories, which were examples of hard science fiction in &quot;New Worlds&quot;, despite the magazine&#x27;s promotion of literary &quot;New Wave&quot; science fiction during the 1960s.

White kept his job with Short Brothers and wrote in the evenings, as his stories did not make enough money for him to become a full-time author. In 1980 he taught a literature course at a Belfast branch of the Workers Educational Association.
When diabetes had severely impaired his eyesight, he took early retirement in 1984 and relocated to the north Antrim resort town of Portstewart, where he continued to write. For many years he was a Council Member of the British Science Fiction Association and, with Harry Harrison and Anne McCaffrey, a Patron of the Irish Science Fiction Association.
White was also a strong pacifist. He died of a stroke on 23 August 1999, while his novels &quot;Double Contact&quot; and &quot;The First Protector&quot; were being prepared for publication. His wife Peggy, son Martin, and daughter Patricia survived him.

== Published works ==

=== Sector General ===
The Sector General series consists of 12 books published originally between 1962 (&quot;Hospital Station&quot;) and 1999 (&quot;Double Contact&quot;). Additional short stories set in the Sector General Universe (&#x27;&quot;Countercharm&quot;, &quot;Tableau&quot;, &quot;Occupation: Warrior&quot;, and &quot;Custom Fitting&quot;) appear in other collections by White.

Sector General is a gigantic multi-species hospital space station founded as a peace-making project by two heroes from opposite sides of humanity&#x27;s only full interstellar war. The hospital accommodates patients and staff from dozens of species, with different environmental requirements, behaviours and ailments. Initially most of the stories concern the career of Doctor Conway, who rises from junior surgeon to Diagnostician. In the fourth book the Galactic Federation decides that the emergency service which the hospital offers to victims of space accidents and planetary catastrophes is the most effective means of making peaceful contact with new spacefaring species, which allows the series to expand its range of plots, characters and settings. The seventh and later books each have a different and usually alien viewpoint character, which gave them &quot;considerable new pep&quot;. They also expand the range of issues beyond purely medical, and in Mike Resnick&#x27;s opinion treat issues such as guilt and forgiveness better than most science fiction.

The series defined the subgenre of multi-species medical stories, and was &quot;the first explicitly pacifist space opera&quot; series, when much of contemporary space opera from the United States was notably military.

=== Other novels ===

&quot;Second Ending&quot; (1961), which White described as &quot;about the last man on Earth&quot; but with &quot;an upbeat ending&quot;, was short-listed for a Hugo Award.

&quot;The Escape Orbit&quot; (1964; titled &quot;Open Prison&quot; in the UK), which was short-listed for a Nebula Award, chronicles the efforts of human prisoners of war to survive after being dumped on a hostile planet without tools or weapons.

&quot;All Judgement Fled&quot; (1968), which won the 1972 Europa Award, was described by Mike Resnick as his favourite among White&#x27;s novels and as &quot;&quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot; done right.&quot;

White&#x27;s other novels not part of the Sector General series are:
* &quot;The Secret Visitors&quot; (1957)
* &quot;The Watch Below&quot; (1966)
* &quot;Tomorrow is Too Far&quot; (1971)
* &quot;Dark Inferno&quot; (1972) (alternate title: &quot;Lifeboat&quot;)
* &quot;The Dream Millennium&quot; (1974)
* &quot;Underkill&quot; (1979)
* &quot;Federation World&quot; (1988)
* &quot;The Silent Stars Go By&quot; (1991)
* &quot;&quot; (1999)

===Collections and short stories===
The title story of White&#x27;s collection &quot;Deadly Litter&quot; (1964) anticipated the dangers of space debris although there had been only a few orbital missions. &quot;The White Papers&quot; was produced by NESFA (New England Science Fiction Association) to commemorate White&#x27;s being the Guest-of-Honour at the 1996 Worldcon, and includes short stories and fan magazine articles by White, plus sections of Gary Louie&#x27;s guide to the Sector General series. Among the stories, &quot;Custom Fitting&quot; (1976) was short-listed for a Hugo Award, and &quot;Sanctuary&quot; (1988) won an Analog Analytical Laboratory Award. His short story &quot;Un-Birthday Boy&quot;, published in the magazine &quot;Analog&quot; in 1996 but not in a collection or anthology, was short-listed for a Hugo Award.

Other collections include:
* &quot;The Aliens Among Us&quot; (1969)
* &quot;Monsters and Medics&quot; (1977; published by Ballantine Books; includes the novel &quot;Second Ending&quot;)
* &quot;Futures Past&quot; (1982) (includes the Sector General story &quot;Spacebird&quot;)

==Critical appraisal==
Paul Kincaid described White as a second-rank writer who occasionally produced first-rank works, and attracted a devoted but not wide audience. Kincaid noted that his plots were often formulaic and his writing employed a predictable set of techniques and mannerisms, along with a &quot;studied quietness.&quot; On the other hand, John Clute wrote that &quot;in the depiction of goodness may lie the real genius of James White,&quot; Mike Resnick described the Sector General series&#x27; characters as &quot;the most memorable crew of aliens ever created,&quot; and Graham Andrews wrote that White&#x27;s aliens are really alien, not just human minds with exotic biologies. Michael Ashley commented that the setting of the television series &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; is reminiscent of Sector General, and Mark R. Leeper noted similarities between Sector General&#x27;s setting and that of television&#x27;s &quot;Babylon 5&quot;. Chris Aylott wrote that White&#x27;s plot construction and writing, including occasionally clumsy exposition, are typical of the Golden Age of science fiction in the 1930s, &#x27;40s, and &#x27;50s.

Algis Budrys concluded his review of &quot;The Watch Below&quot; with &quot;... this is very nice writing when considered simply as prose and as an attempt to involve the reader&#x27;s emotions.&quot; However, when reviewing &quot;All Judgment Fled&quot; he wrote, &quot;I suspect that he generates so much tension within himself while writing a book that he literally cannot bear to come to grips with crucial scenes.&quot;

White said of his approach to producing stories, &quot;Of course, the plot idea must come first – but the characters soon take over,&quot; and compared it to using a compass rather than a map. He explained that he was drawn to medical themes by two factors: they offered opportunities for dramatic tension without war; and he had wanted to become a doctor, but had to go to work instead. His avoidance of violent themes is as strong in his non-medical stories as in the Sector General series.

None of White&#x27;s works won Hugo or Nebula Awards, although four were short-listed. However, he won a Europa Prize in 1979, an &quot;Analog&quot; Analytical Laboratory Award in 1988 and a Science Fiction Chronicle Reader Award in 1996. In 1998, White received the NESFA (New England Science Fiction Association) Edward E. Smith Memorial Award (&quot;Skylark Award&quot;) for contributions to science fiction, named after a story by one of his inspirations, E. E. &quot;Doc&quot; Smith, and appreciated this so much that he donated his complete collection of &quot;Slant&quot; magazines to NESFA. The next year he was inducted into the European Science Fiction Society&#x27;s Hall of Fame. White was Guest-of-Honour at many conventions including: the 1971 and 1985 Novacons in the United Kingdom; three Beneluxcons (Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg); the 1998 Octocon (Ireland); a Nicon (Northern Ireland); and the 1996 Worldcon.

Since 2000 the James White Award has been presented for the best short story by a non-professional writer. The judges are professional authors and editors, and have included Mike Resnick, Orson Scott Card, Lois McMaster Bujold, Peter F. Hamilton, Christopher Priest and Robert Sheckley.

<text>The Nash embedding theorems (or imbedding theorems), named after John Forbes Nash Jr., state that every Riemannian manifold can be isometrically embedded into some Euclidean space. Isometric means preserving the length of every path. For instance, bending but neither stretching nor tearing a page of paper gives an isometric embedding of the page into Euclidean space because curves drawn on the page retain the same arclength however the page is bent.

The first theorem is for continuously differentiable (&quot;C&quot;1) embeddings and the second for embeddings that are analytic or smooth of class &quot;Ck&quot;, 3 ≤ &quot;k&quot; ≤ ∞. These two theorems are very different from each other. The first theorem has a very simple proof but leads to some counterintuitive conclusions, while the second theorem has a technical and counterintuitive proof but leads to a less surprising result.

The &quot;C&quot;1 theorem was published in 1954, the &quot;Ck&quot;-theorem in 1956. The real analytic theorem was first treated by Nash in 1966; his argument was simplified considerably by . (A local version of this result was proved by Élie Cartan and Maurice Janet in the 1920s.) In the real analytic case, the smoothing operators (see below) in the Nash inverse function argument can be replaced by Cauchy estimates. Nash&#x27;s proof of the &quot;Ck&quot;- case was later extrapolated into the h-principle and Nash–Moser implicit function theorem. A simpler proof of the second Nash embedding theorem was obtained by who reduced the set of nonlinear partial differential equations to an elliptic system, to which the contraction mapping theorem could be applied.
==Nash–Kuiper theorem ( embedding theorem) ==
Given an -dimensional Riemannian manifold , an &quot;isometric embedding&quot; is a continuously differentiable topological embedding such that the pullback of the Euclidean metric equals . In analytical terms, this may be viewed (relative to a smooth coordinate chart ) as a system of many first-order partial differential equations for unknown (real-valued) functions:
:formula_1
If is less than , then there are more equations than unknowns. From this perspective, the existence of isometric embeddings given by the following theorem is considered surprising.
Nash–Kuiper theorem. Let be an -dimensional Riemannian manifold and a short smooth embedding (or immersion) into Euclidean space , where . This map is not required to be isometric. Then there is a sequence of continuously differentiable isometric embeddings (or immersions) of which converge uniformly to .

The theorem was originally proved by John Nash with the stronger assumption . His method was modified by Nicolaas Kuiper to obtain the theorem above.

The isometric embeddings produced by the Nash–Kuiper theorem are often considered counterintuitive and pathological. They often fail to be smoothly differentiable. For example, a well-known theorem of David Hilbert asserts that the hyperbolic plane cannot be smoothly isometrically immersed into . Any Einstein manifold of negative scalar curvature cannot be smoothly isometrically immersed as a hypersurface, and a theorem of Shiing-Shen Chern and Kuiper even says that any closed -dimensional manifold of nonpositive sectional curvature cannot be smoothly isometrically immersed in . Furthermore, some smooth isometric embeddings exhibit rigidity phenomena which are violated by the largely unrestricted choice of in the Nash–Kuiper theorem. For example, the image of any smooth isometric hypersurface immersion of the round sphere must itself be a round sphere. By contrast, the Nash–Kuiper theorem ensures the existence of continuously differentiable isometric hypersurface immersions of the round sphere which are arbitrarily close to (for instance) a topological embedding of the sphere as a small ellipsoid.

Any closed and oriented two-dimensional manifold can be smoothly embedded in . Any such embedding can be scaled by an arbitrarily small constant so as to become short, relative to any given Riemannian metric on the surface. It follows from the Nash–Kuiper theorem that there are continuously differentiable isometric embeddings of any such Riemannian surface where the radius of a circumscribed ball is arbitrarily small. By contrast, no negatively curved closed surface can even be smoothly isometrically embedded in . Moreover, for any smooth (or even ) isometric embedding of an arbitrary closed Riemannian surface, there is a quantitative (positive) lower bound on the radius of a circumscribed ball in terms of the surface area and curvature of the embedded metric.

In higher dimension, as follows from the Whitney embedding theorem, the Nash–Kuiper theorem shows that any closed -dimensional Riemannian manifold admits an continuously differentiable isometric embedding into an &quot;arbitrarily small neighborhood&quot; in -dimensional Euclidean space. Although Whitney&#x27;s theorem also applies to noncompact manifolds, such embeddings cannot simply be scaled by a small constant so as to become short. Nash proved that every -dimensional Riemannian manifold admits a continuously differentiable isometric embedding into .

At the time of Nash&#x27;s work, his theorem was considered to be something of a mathematical curiosity. The result itself has not found major applications. However, Nash&#x27;s method of proof was adapted by Camillo De Lellis and László Székelyhidi to construct low-regularity solutions, with prescribed kinetic energy, of the Euler equations from the mathematical study of fluid mechanics. In analytical terms, the Euler equations have a formal similarity to the isometric embedding equations, via the quadratic nonlinearity in the first derivatives of the unknown function. The ideas of Nash&#x27;s proof were abstracted by Mikhael Gromov to the principle of &quot;convex integration&quot;, with a corresponding h-principle. This was applied by Stefan Müller and Vladimír Šverák to Hilbert&#x27;s nineteenth problem, constructing minimizers of minimal differentiability in the calculus of variations.

==&quot;C&quot;&quot;k&quot; embedding theorem==
The technical statement appearing in Nash&#x27;s original paper is as follows: if &quot;M&quot; is a given &quot;m&quot;-dimensional Riemannian manifold (analytic or of class &quot;Ck&quot;, 3 ≤ &quot;k&quot; ≤ ∞), then there exists a number &quot;n&quot; (with &quot;n&quot; ≤ &quot;m&quot;(3&quot;m&quot;+11)/2 if &quot;M&quot; is a compact manifold, and with &quot;n&quot; ≤ &quot;m&quot;(&quot;m&quot;+1)(3&quot;m&quot;+11)/2 if &quot;M&quot; is a non-compact manifold) and an isometric embedding ƒ: &quot;M&quot; → R&quot;n&quot; (also analytic or of class &quot;Ck&quot;). That is ƒ is an embedding of &quot;Ck&quot; manifolds and for every point &quot;p&quot; of &quot;M&quot;, the derivative dƒ&quot;p&quot; is a linear map from the tangent space &quot;TpM&quot; to R&quot;n&quot; which is compatible with the given inner product on &quot;TpM&quot; and the standard dot product of R&quot;n&quot; in the following sense:
: formula_2
for all vectors &quot;u&quot;, &quot;v&quot; in &quot;TpM&quot;. When is larger than , this is an underdetermined system of partial differential equations (PDEs).

The Nash embedding theorem is a global theorem in the sense that the whole manifold is embedded into R&quot;n&quot;. A local embedding theorem is much simpler and can be proved using the implicit function theorem of advanced calculus in a coordinate neighborhood of the manifold. The proof of the global embedding theorem relies on Nash&#x27;s implicit function theorem for isometric embeddings. This theorem has been generalized by a number of other authors to abstract contexts, where it is known as Nash–Moser theorem. The basic idea in the proof of Nash&#x27;s implicit function theorem is the use of Newton&#x27;s method to construct solutions. The standard Newton&#x27;s method fails to converge when applied to the system; Nash uses smoothing operators defined by convolution to make the Newton iteration converge: this is Newton&#x27;s method with postconditioning. The fact that this technique furnishes a solution is in itself an existence theorem and of independent interest. In other contexts, the convergence of the standard Newton&#x27;s method had earlier been proved by Leonid Kantorovitch.

<text>The College of Sorbonne () was a theological college of the University of Paris, founded in 1253 (confirmed in 1257) by Robert de Sorbon (1201–1274), after whom it was named.

The Sorbonne was disestablished by decree of 5 April 1792, after the French Revolution, along with the other Paris colleges. It was restored in 1808, then closed finally in 1882.

In recent times the name &quot;Sorbonne&quot; came to refer to the group of liberal arts faculties of the University of Paris, in contrast to the vocational faculties of law and medicine. &quot;Sorbonne&quot; is also used to refer to the main building of the University of Paris in the 5th arrondissement of Paris, which houses several faculties created when the University was divided into thirteen autonomous universities in 1970.

==Overview==

Robert de Sorbon was the son of peasants from the village of Sorbon in the Ardennes, who became a master of theology, a canon of the Cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris, and the confessor and chaplain of King Louis IX (Saint Louis). At the time that he founded his college, the University of Paris had already been in existence for half a century, and already had thousands of students. Obtaining a higher degree in theology could take as long as twenty years, and therefore required considerable financial support. Students who belonged to the religious orders of the Franciscans and Dominicans, or from the large monasteries of Cluny or Citeaux, received housing and board from their religious orders, but independent students did not. Sorbon founded his college to provide housing and board for poorer students of theology who did not have such support.

Sorbon purchased several houses on Rue Coupe-Gueule (now Rue de la Sorbonne) and made them into lodging for students. The college was founded in 1253. Louis IX confirmed the foundation in 1257. Initially the college has about twenty students, called &quot;socii&quot;. As the college grew, Sorbon provided a library containing over a thousand volumes by 1292, the largest in the university, and a chapel. 
The Sorbonne became the most distinguished theological institution in France, and its doctors were frequently called upon to render opinions on important ecclesiastical and theological issues. In 1470, the Sorbonne had one of the first printing presses in France. It was particularly active in the effort to suppress heresy and the spread of Protestant doctrines. Its students included Cardinal Richelieu, who studied there from 1606 to 1607. Richelieu became Proviseur, or administrator of the college on 29 August 1622. Between 1635 and 1642, Richelieu renovated the Sorbonne; he consolidated the Sorbonne with two smaller colleges, and built a complex of new buildings, including a domed chapel, around a large courtyard. Richelieu left a large part of his fortune and his library to the Sorbonne, and he was buried in the chapel. Only the chapel remains of the Richelieu era buildings.

The Sorbonne was closed to students in 1791 during the French Revolution. For a brief time, under Robespierre, the chapel became a Temple of Reason. Napoleon turned the college buildings into studios for artists. In 1822, it became the home of the faculties of letters, sciences and theology of the University of Paris. In 1885, as part of the Third Republic policy of separation of church and state, the Faculty of Theology was officially closed. The old buildings of the Sorbonne, with the exception of the chapel, were demolished and the new Sorbonne building, designed by Henri Paul Nénot, opened in 1889, the centenary of the French Revolution. It contained a large amphitheater, reception halls and meeting rooms, the offices of the rector of the University of Paris, and the faculties of arts and sciences. The chapel was no longer used for religious services, but only for official ceremonies and exhibitions.

In 1971, as a result of the riots of demonstrations of May 1968, the University of Paris was broken up into thirteen independent faculties. The New Sorbonne building became the home of the Universities of Paris I, III, IV, V, the École Nationale des Chartes, and the École pratique des hautes études.

==Foundation==
Robert de Sorbon, a native of Le Réthelois, was a distinguished professor and famous preacher who lived from 1201 till 1274. Sorbon found that there was a defect in the primitive organization of the University of Paris. The two principal mendicant orders—the Dominicans and the Franciscans—each had colleges at Paris where they delivered lectures which day students could attend without fee.

Robert de Sorbon decided that the university should also provide free instruction, so that it could compete with the religious orders. Further, he believed the society of professors should follow the practices of the cenobitic life, except in vows. His important work was made possible by the high esteem in which de Sorbon was held at Paris, together with his intellectual brilliance, great generosity, and the assistance of his friends. The foundation dates from 1257 or the beginning of 1258. Guillaume de Saint-Amour, Gérard d&#x27;Abbeville, Henry of Ghent, Guillaume des Grez, Odo of Douai, Chrétien de Beauvais, Gérard de Reims, Nicolas de Bar were among the most illustrious scholars connected either with the first chairs in the Sorbonne, or with the first association that constituted it. These savants were already attached to the university staff.

==Organization==
The constitution of the society as conceived by De Sorbon was simple: an administrator (&quot;provisor&quot;), associates (&quot;socii&quot;), and guests (&quot;hospites&quot;). The provisor was the head; nothing could be done without consulting him; he installed the members selected by the society, and confirmed the statutes drawn up by it; he had to provide for everything.

The associates formed the body of the society. To be admitted to it, the candidate was required to have taught a course of philosophy. There were two kinds of associates, the and the . The latter paid forty (Paris) pounds a year; the former were provided for by the house. The burse could be granted only to persons not having an income of forty (Paris) pounds. There was a &quot;primus inter pares&quot;, the prior, who presided over all internal affairs of the house.

Doctors and bachelors were alike eligible, but, owing to the number of the latter, the custom rapidly grew up of selecting only bachelors. Other persons were candidates for admission to the society rather than members of it. From the material and intellectual point of view, they enjoyed the same privileges as the members: board, lodging, books, spiritual and scholastic exercises but they had no votes. When they had fulfilled the condition of teaching philosophy, they were admissible as members. The course of studies lasted ten years, during which time their burses continued; but if, at the end of ten years, they had not given proof of their ability, either as teachers or as preachers, they had to give up their burse.

==History==
The general lectures were open to the public, attracting students who were not affiliated with either division of the society. Doctors and bachelors were permitted to house other needy students. In addition to classroom instruction, there was an obligation to preach and work in the parishes. As part of their training for this role, members had to deliver sermons or discussions (collationes) to the community on designated days. The spiritual aspect of their duties was also emphasized. Conferences, usually delivered by the prior, on this important part of the Christian and priestly life were given especially to the interns.

For twenty years the ability of the administrator, or provisor, corresponded to the foreseeing devotedness of the founder. This stretch of time showed the effectiveness of the administrative measures which De Sorbon had adopted. He had written down the rules in thirty-eight articles. This rule was directed towards the maintenance of common life, from silence in the refectory, to simplicity of authorized dress. As circumstances permitted, about 1271 De Sorbon added a literary college: this was the Collège de Calvi or the &quot;little Sorbonne&quot;.

The constitution which Robert de Sorbon gave to his college lasted for centuries. If Claude Héméré (1574–1650, librarian of the Sorbonne) saw in the project the conception of a powerful intellect, &quot;Hoc primus in lycaeo Parisiensi vidit Robertus&quot;, its realization became a model college for others. The expression &quot;Pauvres maîtres et étudiants en théologie&quot; seems to emphasize the two primary characteristics of the society: equality in poverty, an equality so perfect between masters and pupils that it designated them by a common name; the poverty of the pupils, since most of them were ; the poverty of the masters, since, content with what was strictly necessary, they renounced all other professional remuneration. This equality was always maintained with scrupulous care; the Sorbon repeated as an axiom, &quot;Omnes nos sumus socii et aequales&quot;, and referred to the college as &quot;pauperem nostram Sorbonem&quot;.From the outset the college enjoyed the favour of the Holy See. Pope Alexander IV (1259) urged the French bishops to support it, Urban IV (1262) recommended it to the goodwill of the whole Christian world, and Clement IV (1268) granted it papal approbation. Wealthy benefactors provided it with ample endowment. A high standard of scholarship was maintained and the severity of the &quot;actus Sorbonnicus&quot;, or examination for degrees, including the defence of the &quot;thesis Robertina&quot;, became proverbial. The professorial corps was highly respected. From all parts of Europe, theological and political questions were sent to it for solution.

In 1470, the Sorbonne introduced the art of printing into France by calling to Paris three of Gutenberg&#x27;s associates, Gering, Friburger, and Crantz. Among its principal patrons and benefactors was Cardinal Richelieu, who held for a time the office of provisor and who, in 1635, laid the cornerstone of an edifice to be built at his expense for the use of the college. He was buried in the church of the Sorbonne, where his tomb is still preserved.The doctors of the college were loyal defenders of the Catholic faith against the inroads of Protestantism and the Enlightenment. As other teachers of theology in the university became members of the Sorbonne, by the beginning of the sixteenth century, its staff was practically identical with the university faculty. De Sorbon had created a library. It expanded rapidly, due to numerous gifts.

On the other hand, the professors gave their support to Gallicanism and obliged their members to subscribe to the &quot;four articles&quot;. This attitude naturally weakened the prestige of the Sorbonne as a theological school. Ecclesiastical students had to seek their education in the seminaries. 

The Sorbonne itself was disestablished by decree of 5 April 1792, after the French Revolution.

In 1808, Napoleon restored it as the Faculty of Theology of the newly organized university, the Imperial University of France. It did not, however, regain its former standing or influence, though it continued in existence until 1882, when it was finally suppressed. 

In 1884, the construction of the present building was begun and it was completed in 1889. At the beginning of the 20th century, it was occupied by the Faculty of Humanities and by the various departments of letters and science which formed the École des Hautes Etudes.

<doc id="51134" wikidata="Q314488" url="?curid=51134" title="Leonardo Bruni">
<text>Leonardo Bruni or Leonardo Aretino ( – March 9, 1444) was an Italian humanist, historian and statesman, often recognized as the most important humanist historian of the early Renaissance. He has been called the first modern historian. He was the earliest person to write using the three-period view of history: Antiquity, Middle Ages, and Modern. The dates Bruni used to define the periods are not exactly what modern historians use today, but he laid the conceptual groundwork for a tripartite division of history.

==Biography==
Leonardo Bruni was born in Arezzo, Tuscany circa 1370. Bruni was the pupil of political and cultural leader Coluccio Salutati, whom he succeeded as Chancellor of Florence, and under whose tutelage he developed his ideation of civic humanism. He also served as apostolic secretary to four popes (1405–1414). Bruni&#x27;s years as chancellor, 1410 to 1411 and again from 1427 to his death in 1444, were plagued by warfare. Though he occupied one of the highest political offices, Bruni was relatively powerless, compared to the Albizzi and Medici families. Historian Arthur Field has identified Bruni as an apparent plotter against Cosimo de&#x27; Medici in 1437 (see below). Bruni died in 1444 in Florence and was succeeded in office by Carlo Marsuppini.

==Significance==

Bruni&#x27;s most notable work is &quot;Historiarum Florentini populi libri XII&quot; (History of the Florentine People, 12 Books), which has been called the first modern history book. While it probably was not Bruni&#x27;s intention to secularize history, the three period view of history is unquestionably secular and so Bruni has been called the first modern historian. The foundation of Bruni&#x27;s conception can be found with Petrarch, who distinguished the classical period from later cultural decline, or &quot;tenebrae&quot; (literally &quot;darkness&quot;). Bruni argued that Italy had revived in recent centuries and could therefore be described as entering a new age.

One of Bruni&#x27;s most famous works is &quot;New Cicero&quot;, a biography of the Roman statesman Cicero. He was also the author of biographies in Italian of Dante and Petrarch. It was Bruni who used the phrase &quot;studia humanitatis&quot;, meaning the study of human endeavors, as distinct from those of theology and metaphysics, the source of the term humanists.

As a humanist Bruni was essential in translating into Latin many works of Greek philosophy and history, such as Aristotle and Procopius. Bruni&#x27;s translations of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Politics&quot; and &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot;, as well as the pseudo-Aristotelean &quot;Economics&quot;, were widely distributed in manuscript and in print. His use of Aelius Aristides&#x27; &quot;Panathenicus (Panegyric to Athens)&quot; to buttress his republican theses in the &quot;Panegyric to the City of Florence&quot; () was instrumental in bringing the Greek historian to the attention of Renaissance political philosophers (see Hans Baron&#x27;s &quot;The Crisis of the Early Italian Renaissance&quot; for details). He also wrote a short treatise in Greek on the Florentine constitution.

Bruni was one of the first Humanists to confront Plato&#x27;s discussion of same-sex relationships.

Bruni died in Florence in 1444, and is buried in a wall tomb by Bernardo Rossellino in the Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence.

<text>The Portland Institute for Contemporary Art (PICA) is a contemporary performance and visual arts organization in Portland in the U.S. state of Oregon. PICA was founded in 1995 by Kristy Edmunds. Since 2003, it has presented the annual Time-Based Art Festival (TBA) every September in Portland, featuring contemporary and experimental visual art, dance, theatre, film/video, music, and educational and public programs from local, national, and international artists. As of November 2017, it is led by Executive Director Victoria Frey and Artistic Directors Roya Amirsoleymani, Erin Boberg Doughton, and Kristan Kennedy.

==History==
PICA was founded in 1995 by Kristy Edmunds, at the time the Director of the Portland Art Museum&#x27;s &quot;Art on the Edge&quot; program. The organization&#x27;s exhibition and performance program was built largely around an itinerant model, utilizing vacant space or rented venues throughout the city of Portland rather than programming a single gallery or theatre year-round. The majority of PICA&#x27;s performance programming was grouped into its annual performance seasons, which it produced for seven years before the organization began presenting the Time-Based Art Festival in 2003. The organization&#x27;s signature event during this time was an annual costume party fundraiser known as the Dada Ball, which it held from 1996 until 2001 in a variety of vacant spaces throughout the city.

PICA&#x27;s offices were housed at Boora Architects from its founding until about 2001, and then moved to the headquarters of Wieden+Kennedy in Northwest Portland. PICA housed its offices within those of Wieden &amp; Kennedy until 2012, and operated an additional exhibition space in the building until 2004.

In September 2003, PICA began presenting its annual Time-Based Art Festival, a ten-day international festival of contemporary performance and visual art modeled after those in Edinburgh and Adelaide (Fringe or main Festival?). The TBA Festival built upon PICA&#x27;s itinerant model of utilizing multiple venues around the city, including sites such as the former Washington High School building in Southeast Portland, which would later become Revolution Hall.

In 2012, PICA moved to a leased third floor space on Southwest 10th Avenue, allowing the organization&#x27;s offices and resource library to also be used a gallery and performance space when programs required it.

On April 19, 2016, PICA announced that the organization was gifted a 20-year no-rent lease on a building along the North Williams Avenue corridor by donor Allie Furlotti and the Calligram Foundation. In September 2016, PICA began utilizing this space as a box office, performance venue, and gallery for their 2016 TBA Festival while maintaining offices in downtown Portland. In November 2017, PICA&#x27;s offices were relocated to the renovated Northeast Portland space.

=== Leadership ===
Founder Kristy Edmunds left PICA in 2005 to become artistic director for the Melbourne International Arts Festival. She is now Artistic &amp; Executive Director of the Center for the Art of Performance (CAP) at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Mark Russell (producer of The Public Theater&#x27;s Under the Radar Festival and former director of P.S.122) and Cathy Edwards (former director of programming for the International Festival of Arts and Ideas) operated as the organization&#x27;s two guest artistic directors from 2006 until 2011. Angela Mattox, the former Performing Arts Curator at Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, was hired as the organization&#x27;s permanent artistic director in 2011. Mattox left PICA in 2017 following the end of that year&#x27;s Time-Based Art Festival, her sixth as artistic director.

PICA announced on November 28, 2017, that long-time programming staff members Roya Amirsoleymani (previously Director of Community Engagement), Erin Boberg Doughton (previously Performing Arts Program Director), and Kristan Kennedy (previously Visual Art Curator) had been selected as the organization&#x27;s Artistic Directors.

==Programming==

=== Performance ===
PICA has presented works from performance artists and musicians such as Philip Glass, Laurie Anderson, Karen Finley, Spalding Gray, Marina Abramović, Miranda July, Mike Daisey, and Reggie Watts, among others.

Since its inception, PICA has programmed both performances and exhibitions, while also hosting educational events such as lectures, public conversations, and artist-led workshops. Its first performance series ran from 1995-1996. PICA ceased its seasonal performance series when it began presenting the Time-Based Art Festival in 2003, though still presents some performances during other parts of the year.

=== Visual Art ===
PICA has presented work by visual artists such as William Pope.L, Matthew Day Jackson, Francis Alÿs, Emily Roysdon, A.L. Steiner, Erika Vogt, Abigail DeVille, Carlos Motta and others. Since 2005, PICA&#x27;s visual art programming has been curated by Kristan Kennedy.

As with PICA&#x27;s itinerant model to performance presentation, the organization has not had a single exhibition space for most of its history. From 2000–2004, PICA did run a year-round gallery out of a corner of the Wieden+Kennedy Building in Northwest Portland&#x27;s Pearl District, designed by early PICA supporter Brad Cloepfil. During that time, visual art curator Stuart Horodner presented work from artists such as Janine Antoni, Dana Schutz, and Melanie Manchot in the space. Horodner left the organization in 2004.

The Time-Based Art Festival has included visual art curated by Kennedy as part of its artistic program since 2006 under the &quot;On Sight&quot; program strand. On Sight exhibition programs often include performance-based or otherwise non-conventional visual art modes in addition to traditional gallery spaces. The exhibition-based visual art projects are generally exhibited for two to four weeks after the conclusion of each year&#x27;s TBA. In 2016, the On Sight exhibition was titled &quot;Makeup on Empty Space&quot; and included a multi-channel video installation by A.K. Burns, a performance art piece by Keijaun Thomas, a performance by Dylan Mira, and an exhibition-turned-artist-residency by Bunny Brains and collaborators.

== Community Engagement, Education and Public Programs ==
PICA offers a variety of education, outreach, contextual and public programs, often presented in tandem with its artistic programs but sometimes independent of them. As part of the annual TBA Festival, PICA offers an education, engagement, and public programs strand called the &quot;Institute&quot; that brings festival artists, guest scholars, and writers into dialogue. Institute programming includes workshops, discussions, panels, lectures, and (since 2013) the Field Guide series, in which expert facilitates engage in focused workshops and dialogues with members of the public about a particular performance or program.

=== Precipice Fund ===
In 2011, PICA announced that the organization had received money from the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts&#x27; Regional Regranting Program to create a regranting program for small, artist-led visual art projects that do not otherwise qualify for project support through traditional granting mechanisms. Dubbed the Precipice Fund, PICA began distributing its first round of grants in 2013. As of 2016, $225,000 has been redistributed over three grant periods to 57 projects in the region.

=== Resource Room ===
Since 2000, PICA&#x27;s offices have included a public reference library known as the Resource Room. The PICA Resource Room collects a variety of art publications, housing over 4,000 books and periodicals on its shelves. The Resource Room also collects video documentation from the organization&#x27;s 20-year history of artistic presentation. From 2012–2015, the Resource Room Residency gave artists the opportunity to engage with the space and collection of archival materials.

<doc id="51137" wikidata="Q2294840" url="?curid=51137" title="SoftICE">
<text>SoftICE is a kernel mode debugger for DOS and Windows up to Windows XP. It is designed to run underneath Windows, so that the operating system is unaware of its presence. Unlike an application debugger, SoftICE is capable of suspending all operations in Windows when instructed. Due to its low-level capabilities, SoftICE is also popular as a software cracking tool. 

Microsoft offers two kernel-mode debuggers, WinDbg and KD, without charges. However, the full capabilities of WinDbg and KD are available only when two interlinked computers are used. SoftICE, therefore, is an exceptionally useful tool for difficult driver-related development. The last released version was for Windows XP.

Older versions exist for DOS and compatible operating systems. SoftICE was originally produced by the company NuMega, and was subsequently acquired by Compuware in 1997, which in turn sold the property to Micro Focus in 2009. Currently, Micro Focus owns the source code and patents, but is not actively maintaining SoftICE. 

==Naming==
&quot;Soft&quot; refers to software, and &quot;ICE&quot; is an allusion to in-circuit emulator.

==History==
The original SoftICE for DOS was written in 1987 by NuMega founders Frank Grossman and Jim Moskun. The program, written in 80386 assembly language, played the role of an operating system and ran software in virtual 8086 mode. It sold for $386.

SoftICE/W (for Windows) was developed in the 1990s, and was instrumental in the Writing of &quot;Undocumented Windows&quot;, by Andrew Schulman, David Maxey and Matt Pietrek. SoftICE/W was derived from an earlier, lesser known product, SoftICE for NetWare (32-bit protected mode). One of the key advantages it had over Microsoft&#x27;s debuggers is that it enabled single machine debugging, rather than requiring a second machine to be connected over a serial port.

The principal developers of SoftICE were Dom Basile (&#x27;Mr. SoftICE&#x27;), Tom Guinther (Kitchen Sink, Symbol Engine), Gerald Ryckman (Video drivers and &quot;Kitchen Sink&quot;), Ray Hsu (Video drivers for Windows 95), and Dan Babcock (SoftICE/NT 3.1/3.5: Universal video driver, symbol engine), with contributions by a variety of NuMega developers including Frank Grossman, Jim Moskun and Matt Pietrek.

In 1998, the codebase for SoftICE/95 was ported to run on the Windows NT platform.

Newer versions of SoftICE patch deep into Microsoft Windows. As such, old versions of SoftICE are rarely compatible with new versions of Windows. Compuware therefore offered SoftICE as a subscription so that it could be kept up to date and in sync with the latest Microsoft Windows version.

SoftICE was previously offered as part of Compuware&#x27;s DriverStudio package, but was discontinued in April 2006.

===Termination===
As of April 3, 2006, the DriverStudio product family has been discontinued because of &quot;a variety of technical and business issues as well as general market conditions&quot;. Maintenance support was offered until March 31, 2007.

===Anti-SoftICE measures===
Software vendors have put in place a wide range of countermeasures to protect themselves from people employing SoftICE as a tool to analyse software.

For example, here is code some vendors used to detect the presence of SoftICE running in the same machine as an early countermeasure:
 mov eax, dword ptr [pIDT+2]; eax -&gt; IDT
 add eax, 8 ; eax -&gt; int 1 vector
 mov ebx, [eax] ; ebx == int 1 vector
 add eax, 16 ; eax -&gt; int 3 vector
 mov eax, [eax] ; eax == int 3 vector
 and eax, 0FFFFh ; strip the selector
 and ebx, 0FFFFh ; part of it
 sub eax, ebx ; find displacement
 cmp eax, 10h
jne HackedVector ; not equal, then chances are
 ; SoftICE had tampered with these vectors
More and better such measures have evolved since. While most of them can only deter the less experienced and determined hackers, SoftICE is no longer a tool of choice for someone new to analysing software.

Modern software anti-analysis methods are based on more sophisticated packers/protectors, e.g. Themida, Armadillo or ASProtect which pack the program code and tamper with entry point addresses so it is hard to find the program&#x27;s original entry point (OEP). That is also true for the program&#x27;s import address table (IAT). However, tools for hiding SoftICE are also available, such as IceStealth and IceExt for Windows NT, or Icedump and IcePatch for Windows 9x.

==Reception==
In 1989, &quot;BYTE&quot; listed Soft-ICE among the &quot;Distinction&quot; winners of the BYTE Awards, stating that, &quot;If you&#x27;re developing 8086-based applications on an 80386 machine, this is an essential and affordable tool&quot;.

==Alternatives==
A commercial kernel-level debugger called Syser claims to continue where SoftICE left off.

A shareware debugger, but free to use, OllyDbg is a 32-bit assembler-level debugger from Oleh Yuschuk. However, it can only be used for user-mode debugging.

An open source kernel debugger similar to SoftICE named &quot;Rasta Ring 0 Debugger&quot; (RR0D) is available. It provides low-level debugging for Microsoft Windows, Linux, OpenBSD, NetBSD, and FreeBSD. This project does not seem to be actively maintained. , the last change in its GitHub source code repository occurred in December 2008.

A debugger called BugChecker is a 32-bit single-host kernel debugger for Windows 2000 and XP, developed and made available as open source for educational purposes. BugChecker allows users to trace into both user and kernel code, both on uniprocessor and multiprocessor versions of Windows 2000 and XP.

A modern successor to SoftICE named BugChecker (unrelated to the one mentioned above) was released by Vito Plantamura in 2023. Unlike the other local kernel debuggers, it supports Windows XP to Windows 11, both 32-bit and 64-bit. To achieve this, the debugger spoofs the machine as being debugged by a second system by intercepting serial cable communication, and then and draws its display directly to the framebuffer. This method significantly improves stability and compatibility compared to previous approaches, including that of SoftICE itself.

Many hypervisors allow debugging the kernel running in the virtual machine through exposing some kind of debugger interface that can control the virtualized processor directly. This allows debugging even if the kernel does not have native debugging facilities.

<doc id="51138" wikidata="Q49845" url="?curid=51138" title="Mail">
<text>The mail or post is a system for physically transporting postcards, letters, and parcels. A postal service can be private or public, though many governments place restrictions on private systems. Since the mid-19th century, national postal systems have generally been established as a government monopoly, with a fee on the article prepaid. Proof of payment is usually in the form of an adhesive postage stamp, but a postage meter is also used for bulk mailing.

Postal authorities often have functions aside from transporting letters. In some countries, a postal, telegraph and telephone (PTT) service oversees the postal system, in addition to telephone and telegraph systems. Some countries&#x27; postal systems allow for savings accounts and handle applications for passports.

The Universal Postal Union (UPU), established in 1874, includes 192 member countries and sets the rules for international mail exchanges as a Specialized Agency of the United Nations.

== Etymology ==

The word &quot;mail&quot; comes from the Middle English word , referring to a travelling bag or pack. It was spelled in that manner until the 17th century and is distinct from the word male. The French have a similar word, , for a trunk or large box, and is the Irish term for a bag. In the 17th century, the word &quot;mail&quot; began to appear as a reference for a bag that contained letters: &quot;bag full of letter&quot; (1654). Over the next hundred years the word &quot;mail&quot; began to be applied strictly to the letters themselves and the sack as the &quot;mailbag&quot;. In the 19th century, the British typically used &quot;mail&quot; to refer to letters being sent abroad (i.e. on a ship) and &quot;post&quot; to refer to letters for domestic delivery. The word &quot;Post&quot; is derived from Old French , which ultimately stems from the past participle of the Latin verb &#x27;to lay down or place&#x27;. So in the U.K., the Royal Mail delivers the &quot;post&quot;, while in North America both the U.S. Postal Service and Canada Post deliver the &quot;mail&quot;.

The term &quot;email&quot;, short for &quot;electronic mail&quot;, first appeared in the 1970s. The term &quot;snail mail&quot; is a retronym to distinguish it from the quicker email. Various dates have been given for its first use.

== History ==
The practice of communication by written documents carried by an intermediary from one person or place to another almost certainly dates back nearly to the invention of writing. However, the development of formal postal systems occurred much later. The first documented use of an organized courier service for the dissemination of written documents is in Egypt, where Pharaohs used couriers to send out decrees throughout the territory of the state (2400 BCE). The earliest surviving piece of mail is also Egyptian, dating to 255 BCE.

=== Persia (Iran) ===

The first credible claim for the development of a real postal system comes from Ancient Persia. The best-documented claim (Xenophon) attributes the invention to the ۸Persian King Cyrus the Great (550 BCE), who mandated that every province in his kingdom would organize reception and delivery of post to each of its citizens. Other writers credit his successor Darius I of Persia (521 BCE). Other sources claim much earlier dates for an Assyrian postal system, with credit given to Hammurabi (1700 BCE) and Sargon II (722 BCE). Mail may not have been the primary mission of this postal service, however. The role of the system as an intelligence gathering apparatus is well documented, and the service was (later) called &quot;angariae&quot;, a term that in time came to indicate a tax system. The Old Testament (Esther, VIII) makes mention of this system: Ahasuerus, king of Persian, used couriers for communicating his decisions.

The Persian system worked using stations (called Chapar-Khaneh), whence the message carrier (called Chapar) would ride to the next post, whereupon he would swap his horse with a fresh one for maximum performance and delivery speed. Herodotus described the system in this way: &quot;It is said that as many days as there are in the whole journey, so many are the men and horses that stand along the road, each horse and man at the interval of a day&#x27;s journey; and these are stayed neither by snow nor rain nor heat nor darkness from accomplishing their appointed course with all speed&quot;. The verse prominently features on New York&#x27;s James Farley Post Office, although it uses the translation &quot;Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds&quot;.

=== India ===

The economic growth and political stability under the Mauryan Empire (322–185 BCE) stimulated sustained development of civil infrastructure in ancient India. The Mauryans developed early Indian mail service as well as public wells, rest houses, and other facilities for the public. Common chariots called &quot;Dagana&quot; were sometimes used as mail chariots in ancient India. Couriers were used militarily by kings and local rulers to deliver information through runners and other carriers. The postmaster, the head of the intelligence service, was responsible for ensuring the maintenance of the courier system. Couriers were also used to deliver personal letters.

In South India, the Wodeyar dynasty (1399–1947) of the Kingdom of Mysore used mail service for espionage purposes thereby acquiring knowledge related to matters that took place at great distances.

By the end of the 18th century, a postal system in India was in operation. Later this system underwent complete modernization when the British Raj established its control over most of India. The &quot;Post Office Act XVII&quot; of 1837 provided that the Governor-General of India in Council had the exclusive right of conveying letters by post for hire within the territories of the East India Company. The mails were available to certain officials without charge, which became a controversial privilege as the years passed. On this basis the Indian Post Office was established on October 1, 1837.

=== Rome ===

The first well-documented postal service was that of Rome. Organized at the time of Augustus Caesar (62 BCE – 14 CE), the service was called &quot;cursus publicus&quot; and was provided with light carriages (&quot;rhedæ&quot;) pulled by fast horses. By the time of Diocletian, a parallel service was established with two-wheeled carts (&quot;birotæ&quot;) pulled by oxen. This service was reserved for government correspondence. Yet another service for citizens was later added.

=== Vietnam ===
In 1802, the first Vietnamese postal service was established under the Nguyen dynasty, under the Ministry of Rites. During the Nguyen dynasty, official documents were transported by horse and other primitive means to stations built about 25-30 kilometers apart. In 1904, three wireless communication offices were established, and in early 1906 they were merged with the postal service to form the Post and Wireless Office. In 1945, after the August Revolution, the Post and Wireless Office was renamed the Post Office under the Ministry of Transportation. In 1955, the Post Office was upgraded to the Ministry of Post.

=== China ===
Some Chinese sources claim mail or postal systems dating back to the Xia or Shang dynasties, which would be the oldest mailing service in the world. The earliest credible system of couriers was initiated by the Han dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE), who had relay stations every 30 li (about 15 km) along major routes.

The Tang dynasty (618 to 907 AD) operated a recorded 1,639 posthouses, including maritime offices, employing around 20,000 people. The system was administered by the Ministry of War and private correspondence was forbidden from the network. The Ming dynasty (1368 to 1644) sought a postal system to deliver mail quickly, securely, and cheaply. Adequate speed was always a problem, because of the slow overland transportation system, and underfunding. Its network had 1,936 posthouses every 60 li along major routes, with fresh horses available every 10 li between them. The Qing operated 1,785 posthouses throughout their lands. More efficient, however, was the system linking the international settlements, centered around Shanghai and the Treaty ports. It was the main communication system for China&#x27;s international trade.

=== Mongol Empire ===

Genghis Khan installed an empire-wide messenger and postal station system named &quot;Örtöö&quot; within the Mongol Empire. During the Yuan dynasty under Kublai Khan, this system also covered the territory of China. Postal stations were used not only for the transmission and delivery of official mail but were also available for travelling officials, military men, and foreign dignitaries. These stations aided and facilitated the transport of foreign and domestic tribute specifically and the conduct of trade in general.

By the end of Kublai Khan&#x27;s rule, there were more than 1400 postal stations in China alone, which in turn had at their disposal about 50,000 horses, 1,400 oxen, 6,700 mules, 400 carts, 6,000 boats, more than 200 dogs, and 1,150 sheep.

The stations were apart and had reliable attendants working for the mail service. Foreign observers, such as Marco Polo, have attested to the efficiency of this early postal system.

Each station was maintained by up to twenty five families. Work for postal service counted as military service. The system was still operational in 18th century when 64 stations were required for a message to cross Mongolia from the Altai Mountains to China.

=== Japan===
The modern Japanese system was developed in the mid-19th century, closely copying European models. Japan was highly innovative in developing the world&#x27;s largest and most successful postal savings system and later a postal life insurance system as well. Postmasters play a key role in linking the Japanese political system to local politics. The postmasters are high prestige, and are often hereditary. To a large extent, the postal system generated the enormous funding necessary to rapidly industrialize Japan in the late 19th century.

=== Korea ===

The postal service was one of Korea&#x27;s first attempts at modernization. The Joseon Post Office was established in 1884.

=== Other systems ===
Another important postal service was created in the Islamic world by the &quot;caliph&quot; Mu&#x27;awiyya; the service was called &quot;barid&quot;, for the name of the towers built to protect the roads by which couriers travelled.

By 3000 BC, Egypt was using homing pigeons for pigeon post, taking advantage of a singular quality of this bird, which when taken far from its nest is able to find its way home due to a particularly developed sense of orientation. Messages were then tied around the legs of the pigeon, which was freed and could reach its original nest. By the 19th century, homing pigeons were used extensively for military communications.

Charlemagne extended to the whole territory of his empire the system used by Franks in northern Gaul and connected this service with that of &quot;missi dominici&quot;.

In the mid-11th century, flax traders known as the Cairo Geniza Merchants from Fustat, Egypt wrote about using a postal service known as the &quot;kutubi.&quot; The &quot;kutubi&quot; system managed routes between the cities of Jerusalem, Ramla, Tyre, Ascalon, Damascus, Aleppo, and Fustat with year-round, regular mail delivery.

Many religious orders had a private mail service. Notably, the Cistercians had one which connected more than 6,000 abbeys, monasteries, and churches. The best organization, however, was created by the Knights Templar.

In 1716, Correos y Telégrafos was established in Spain as public mail service, available to all citizens. Delivery postmen were first employed in 1756 and post boxes were installed firstly in 1762.

=== Thurn und Taxis ===
In 1505, Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I established a postal system in the Empire, appointing Franz von Taxis to run it. This system, originally the &quot;Kaiserliche Reichspost&quot;, is often considered the first modern postal service in the world, which initiated a revolution in communication in Europe. The system combined contemporary technical and organization means to create a stable transcontinental service which was also the first to offer (fee-based) public access.
 The Thurn und Taxis family, then known as Tassis, had operated postal services between Italian city-states from 1290 onward. For 500 years the postal business based in Brussels and in Frankfurt was passed from one generation to another. Following the abolition of the Empire in 1806, the Thurn-und-Taxis Post system continued as a private organization into the postage stamp era before being absorbed into the postal system of the new German Empire after 1871. 1867 July 1 the State of Prussia had to make a compensation payment of 3.000.000 Thalers reinvested by Helene von Thurn &amp; Taxis, daughter-in-law of the last postmaster, Maximilian Karl, 6th Prince of Thurn and Taxis, into real estate, most of it continuing to exist today.

The Phone Book of the World has its roots in the long history of the avant-garde telecommunications family Thurn &amp; Taxis. The directory is the result of Johannes, 11th Prince of Thurn &amp; Taxis transmitting PTT culture to a student and helping with the opening of a small Telephone Boutique next to a historic Postal mansion his ancestors used to go to centuries earlier. Several European Post Carriers like Deutsche Post or Austrian Post continue to use the Thurn &amp; Taxis Post Horn in their company logo just like the global Phone Book of the World based in the old Postal mansion of King Louis XIV in Paris.

=== Postal reforms ===
In the United Kingdom, prior to 1840 letters were paid for by the recipient and the cost was determined by the distance from sender to recipient and the number of sheets of paper rather than by a countrywide flat rate with weight restrictions. Sir Rowland Hill reformed the postal system based on the concepts of penny postage and prepayment. In his proposal, Hill also called for official pre-printed envelopes and adhesive postage stamps as alternative ways of getting the sender to pay for the postage, at a time when prepayment was optional, which led to the invention of the postage stamp, the Penny Black.

=== Modern transport and technology ===
The postal system was important in the development of modern transportation. Railways carried railway post offices. During the 20th century, air mail became the transport of choice for inter-continental mail. Postmen started to use mail trucks. The handling of mail became increasingly automated.

The Internet came to change the conditions for physical mail. Email (and in recent years social networking sites) became a fierce competitor to physical mail systems, but online auctions and Internet shopping opened new business opportunities as people often get items bought online through the mail.

== Modern mail ==

Modern mail is organized by national and privatized services, which are reciprocally connected by international regulations, organizations and international agreements. Paper letters and parcels can be sent to almost any country in the world relatively easily and cheaply. The Internet has made the process of sending letter-like messages nearly instantaneous, and in many cases and situations correspondents use email where they previously would have used letters. The volume of paper mail sent through the U.S. Postal Service has declined by more than 15% since its peak at 213 billion pieces per annum in 2006.

=== Organization ===

Some countries have organized their mail services as public limited liability corporations without a legal monopoly.

The worldwide postal system constituting the individual national postal systems of the world&#x27;s self-governing states is coordinated by the Universal Postal Union, which among other things sets international postage rates, defines standards for postage stamps and operates the system of international reply coupons.

In most countries a system of codes has been created (referred to as &quot;ZIP codes&quot; in the United States, &quot;postcodes&quot; in the United Kingdom and Australia, &quot;eircodes&quot; in Ireland and &quot;postal codes&quot; in most other countries) in order to facilitate the automation of operations. This also includes placing additional marks on the address portion of the letter or mailed object, called &quot;bar coding&quot;. Bar coding of mail for delivery is usually expressed either by a series of vertical bars, usually called POSTNET coding or a block of dots as a two-dimensional barcode. The &quot;block of dots&quot; method allows for the encoding of proof of payment of postage, exact routing for delivery, and other features.

The ordinary mail service was improved in the 20th century with the use of planes for a quicker delivery. The world&#x27;s first scheduled airmail post service took place in the United Kingdom between the London suburbs of Hendon and Windsor, Berkshire, on 9 September 1911. Some methods of airmail proved ineffective, however, including the United States Postal Service&#x27;s experiment with rocket mail.

Receipt services were made available in order to grant the sender a confirmation of effective delivery.

=== Payment ===

Before about the mid-nineteenth century, in regions where postal systems existed, the payment models varied, but most mail was sent unpaid requiring the recipient to pay the postage fee. In some regions a partial payment was made by the sender. Today, worldwide, the most common method of prepaying postage is by buying an adhesive postage stamp to be applied to the envelope before mailing; a much less common method is to use a postage-prepaid envelope. Franking is a method of creating postage-prepaid envelopes under licence using a special machine. They are used by companies with large mail programs, such as banks and direct mail companies.

In 1998, the U.S. Postal Service authorised the first tests of a secure system of sending digital franks via the Internet to be printed out on a PC printer, obviating the necessity to license a dedicated franking machine and allowing companies with smaller mail programs to make use of the option; this was later expanded to test the use of personalized postage. The service provided by the U.S. Postal Service in 2003 allows the franks to be printed out on special adhesive-backed labels.

In 2004 the Royal Mail in the United Kingdom introduced its &quot;SmartStamp&quot; Internet-based system, allowing printing on ordinary adhesive labels or envelopes. Similar systems are being considered by postal administrations around the world.

When the pre-paid envelope or package is accepted into the mail by an agent of the postal service, the agent usually indicates by means of a cancellation that it is no longer valid for pre-payment of postage. The exceptions are when the agent forgets or neglects to cancel the mailpiece, for stamps that are pre-cancelled and thus do not require cancellation and for, in most cases, metered mail. (The &quot;personalized stamps&quot; authorized by the USPS and manufactured by Zazzle and other companies are in fact a form of meter label and thus do not need to be cancelled.)

=== Privacy and censorship ===
Documents should generally not be read by anyone other than the addressee; for example, in the United States of America it is a violation of federal law for anyone other than the addressee and the government to open mail. There are exceptions however: executives often assign secretaries or assistants the task of handling their mail; and postcards do not require opening and can be read by anyone. For mail contained within an envelope, there are legal provisions in some jurisdictions allowing the recording of identities of sender and recipient.

The privacy of correspondence is guaranteed by the constitutions of Mexico, Colombia, Brazil and Venezuela, and is alluded to in the European Convention on Human Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The control of the contents inside private citizens&#x27; mail is censorship and concerns social, political, and legal aspects of civil rights. International mail and packages are subject to customs control, with the mail and packages often surveyed and their contents sometimes edited out (or even in).

There have been cases over the millennia of governments opening and copying or photographing the contents of private mail. Subject to the laws in the relevant jurisdiction, correspondence may be openly or covertly opened, or the contents determined via some other method, by the police or other authorities in some cases relating to a suspected criminal conspiracy, although black chambers (largely in the past, though there is apparently some continuance of their use today) opened extralegally.

The mail service may be allowed to open the mail if neither addressee nor sender can be located, in order to attempt to locate either. Mail service may also open the mail to inspect if it contains materials that are hazardous to transport or violate local laws.

While in most cases mail censorship is exceptional, military mail to and from soldiers is often subject to surveillance. The mail is censored to prevent leaking tactical secrets, such as troop movements or weather conditions. Depending on the country, civilian mail containing military secrets can also be monitored and censored.

Mail sent to and from inmates in jails or prisons within the United States is subject to opening and review by jail or prison staff to determine if the mail has any criminal action dictated or provides means for an escape. The only mail that is not able to be read is attorney-client mail, which is covered under the attorney-client confidentiality laws in the United States.

=== Rise of electronic correspondence ===

Modern alternatives, such as the telegraph, telephone, telex, facsimile, and email, have reduced the attractiveness of paper mail for many applications. These modern alternatives have some advantages: in addition to their speed, they may be more secure, e.g., because the general public cannot learn the address of the sender or recipient from the envelope, and occasionally traditional items of mail may fail to arrive, e.g. due to vandalism to mailboxes, unfriendly pets, and adverse weather conditions. Mail carriers due to perceived hazards or inconveniences, may refuse, officially or otherwise, to deliver mail to a particular address (for instance, if there is no clear path to the door or mailbox). On the other hand, traditional mail avoids the possibility of computer malfunctions and malware, and the recipient does not need to print it out if they wish to have a paper copy, though scanning is required to make a digital copy.

Physical mail is still widely used in business and personal communications for such reasons as legal requirements for signatures, requirements of etiquette, and the requirement to enclose small physical objects.

Since the advent of email, which is almost always much faster, the postal system has come to be referred to in Internet slang by the retronym &quot;snail mail&quot;. Occasionally, the term &quot;white mail&quot; has also been used as a neutral term for postal mail.

Mainly during the 20th century, experimentation with hybrid mail has combined electronic and paper delivery. Electronic mechanisms include telegram, telex, facsimile (fax), email, and short message service (SMS). There have been methods which have combined mail and some of these newer methods, such as temporary emails, that combine facsimile transmission with overnight delivery. These vehicles commonly use a mechanical or electro-mechanical standardised writing (typing), that on the one hand makes for more efficient communication, while on the other hand makes impossible characteristics and practices that traditionally were in conventional mail, such as calligraphy.

This epoch is undoubtedly mainly dominated by mechanical writing, with a general use of no more of half a dozen standard typographic fonts from standard keyboards. However, the increased use of typewritten or computer-printed letters for personal communication and the advent of email have sparked renewed interest in calligraphy, as a letter has become more of a &quot;special event&quot;. Long before email and computer-printed letters, however, decorated envelopes, rubber stamps and artistamps formed part of the medium of mail art.

In the 2000s (decade) with the advent of eBay and other online auction sites and online stores, postal services in industrialized nations have seen a major shift to item shipping. This has been seen as a boost to the system&#x27;s usage in the wake of lower paper mail volume due to the accessibility of email.

Online post offices have emerged to give recipients a means of receiving traditional correspondence mail in a scanned electronic format.

=== Collecting ===

Postage stamps are also object of a particular form of collecting. Stamp collecting has been a very popular hobby. In some cases, when demand greatly exceeds supply, their commercial value on this specific market may become enormously greater than face value, even after use. For some postal services the sale of stamps to collectors who will never use them is a significant source of revenue; for example, stamps from Tokelau, South Georgia &amp; South Sandwich Islands, Tristan da Cunha, Niuafoʻou and many others. Stamp collecting is commonly known as philately, although strictly the latter term refers to the study of stamps.

Another form of collecting regards postcards, a document written on a single robust sheet of paper, usually decorated with photographic pictures or artistic drawings on one of the sides, and short messages on a small part of the other side, that also contained the space for the address. In strict philatelic usage, the postcard is to be distinguished from the postal card, which has a pre-printed postage on the card. The fact that this communication is visible by other than the receiver often causes the messages to be written in jargon.

Letters are often studied as an example of literature, and also in biography in the case of a famous person. A portion of the New Testament of the Bible is composed of the Apostle Paul&#x27;s epistles to Christian congregations in various parts of the Roman Empire. See below for a list of famous letters.

A style of writing, called &quot;epistolary,&quot; tells a fictional story in the form of the correspondence between two or more characters.

A makeshift mail method after stranding on a deserted island is a message in a bottle.

=== Deregulation ===
Numerous countries, including Sweden (1 January 1993), New Zealand (1998 and 2003), Germany (2005 and 2007), Argentina and Chile opened up the postal services market to new entrants. In the case of New Zealand Post Limited, this included (from 2003) its right to be the sole New Zealand postal administration member of the Universal Postal Union, thus the ending of its monopoly on stamps bearing the name New Zealand.

== Types ==

=== Letters ===

Letter-sized mail constitutes the bulk of the contents sent through most postal services. These are usually documents printed on A4 (210×297 mm), Letter-sized (8.5×11 inches), or smaller paper and placed in envelopes.

Handwritten correspondence, while once a major means of communications between distant people, is now used less frequently due to the advent of more immediate forms of communication, such as the telephone or email. Traditional letters, however, are often considered to hark back to a &quot;simpler time&quot; and are still used when someone wishes to be deliberate and thoughtful about their communication. An example would be a letter of sympathy to a bereaved person.

Bills and invoices are often sent through the mail, like regular billing correspondence from utility companies and other service providers. These letters often contain a self-addressed envelope that allows the receiver to remit payment back to the company easily. While still very common, many people now opt to use online bill payment services, which eliminate the need to receive bills through the mail. Paperwork for the confirmation of large financial transactions is often sent through the mail. Many tax documents are as well.

New credit cards and their corresponding personal identification numbers are sent to their owners through the mail. The card and number are usually mailed separately several days or weeks apart for security reasons.

Bulk mail is mail that is prepared for bulk mailing, often by presorting, and processing at reduced rates. It is often used in direct marketing and other advertising mail, although it has other uses as well. The senders of these messages sometimes purchase lists of addresses (which are sometimes targeted towards certain demographics) and then send letters advertising their product or service to all recipients. Other times, commercial solicitations are sent by local companies advertising local products, like a restaurant delivery service advertising to their delivery area or a retail store sending their weekly advertising circular to a general area. Bulk mail is also often sent to companies&#x27; existing subscriber bases, advertising new products or services.

==== First-Class ====

First-Class Mail in the U.S. includes postcards, letters, large envelopes (flats), and small packages, providing each piece weighs or less. Delivery is given priority over second-class (newspapers and magazines), third class (bulk advertisements), and fourth-class mail (books and media packages). First-Class Mail prices are based on both the shape and weight of the item being mailed. Pieces over 13 ounces can be sent as Priority Mail. As of 2011 42% of First-Class Mail arrived the next day, 27% in two days, and 31% in three. The USPS expected that changes to the service in 2012 would cause about 51% to arrive in two days and most of the rest in three. 
The Canada Post counterpart is Lettermail.

The British Royal Mail&#x27;s 1st Class, as it is styled, is simply a priority option over 2nd Class, at a slightly higher cost. Royal Mail aims (but does not guarantee) to deliver all 1st Class letters the day after posting.

In Austria priority delivery mail is called Prio, in Switzerland A-Post.

====Registered and recorded mail====
Registered mail allows the location and in particular the correct delivery of a letter to be tracked. It is usually considerably more expensive than regular mail, and is typically used for valuable items. Registered mail is constantly tracked through the system.

Recorded mail is handled just like ordinary mail with the exception that it has to be signed for on receipt. This is useful for legal documents where proof of delivery is required.

In the United Kingdom recorded delivery mail (branded as &quot;signed for&quot; by the Royal Mail) is covered by &quot;The Recorded Delivery Services Act 1962&quot;. Under this legislation any document which its relevant law requires service by registered post can also be lawfully served by recorded delivery.

==== Repositionable notes ====

The United States Postal Service introduced a test allowing &quot;repositionable notes&quot; (for example, 3M&#x27;s Post-it notes) to be attached to the outside of envelopes and bulk mailings, afterwards extending the test for an unspecified period. The repositionable note may be fixed directly to the address side of First-Class Mail and Standard Mail letter-size mailpieces. These mailpieces must meet the standards in 7.2 through 7.6. The note is included as an integral part of the mailpiece for weight and postage rate and must be accounted for in pricing.

=== Postal cards and postcards ===

Postal cards and postcards are small message cards that are sent by mail unenveloped; the distinction often, though not invariably and reliably, drawn between them is that &quot;postal cards&quot; are issued by the postal authority or entity with the &quot;postal indicia&quot; (or &quot;stamp&quot;) preprinted on them, while postcards are privately issued and require affixing an adhesive stamp (though there have been some cases of a postal authority&#x27;s issuing non-stamped postcards). Postcards are often printed to promote tourism, with pictures of resorts, tourist attractions or humorous messages on the front and allowing for a short message from the sender to be written on the back. The postage required for postcards is generally less than postage required for standard letters; however, certain technicalities such as their being oversized or having cut-outs, may result in payment of the first-class rate being required.

Postcards are also used by magazines for new subscriptions. Inside many magazines are postage-paid subscription cards that a reader can fill out and mail back to the publishing company to be billed for a subscription to the magazine. In this fashion, magazines also use postcards for other purposes, including reader surveys, contests or information requests.

Postcards are sometimes sent by charities to their members with a message to be signed and sent to a politician (e.g. to promote fair trade or third world debt cancellation).

=== Other mail services ===
Small packets are usually less than 2 kg (4 lb).

Larger envelopes are also sent through the mail. These are often composed of a stronger material than standard envelopes and are often used by businesses to transport documents that may not be folded or damaged, such as legal documents and contracts. Due to their size, larger envelopes are sometimes charged additional postage.

Packages are often sent through some postal services, usually requiring additional postage than an average letter or postcard. Many postal services have limitations as to what a package may or may not contain, usually placing limits or bans on perishable, hazardous or flammable materials. Some hazardous materials in limited quantities may be shipped with appropriate markings and packaging, like an ORM-D label. Additionally, as a result of terrorism concerns, the U.S. Postal Service subjects their packages to numerous security tests, often scanning or x-raying packages for materials that might be found in biological materials or mail bombs.

Newspapers and magazines are also sent through postal services. Many magazines are simply deposited in the mail like any other mailpiece. In the U.S., they are printed with a special Intelligent Mail barcode that acts as prepaid postage. Other magazines are now shipped in shrinkwrap to protect loose contents such as blow-in cards. During the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, newspapers and magazines were normally posted using wrappers with a stamp imprint.

Hybrid mail, sometimes referred to as L-mail, is the electronic lodgement of mail from the mail generator&#x27;s computer directly to a Postal Service provider. The Postal Service provider is then able to use electronic means to have the mail piece sorted, routed and physically produced at a site closest to the delivery point. It is a type of mail growing in popularity with some Post Office operations and individual businesses venturing into this market. In some countries, these services are available to print and deliver emails to those who are unable to receive email, such as the elderly or infirm. Services provided by Hybrid mail providers are closely related to that of mail forwarding service providers.

==Business model==

The business model of modern postal operators can be broken down to four stages: (1) collection, (2) sorting, (3) transportation, and (4) delivery.

Collection is the gathering of mailpieces from various locations such as customer premises, post boxes, and post offices. Newly collected mail is normally not sorted immediately upon receipt and is instead taken directly in its unsorted state to sorting centers.

Sorting is the process of segregating mailpieces into groups based on their type and destination, so that they can be loaded onto an appropriate mode of transportation headed in the general direction of their final destinations. Traditionally, mail was manually sorted by hand, but it is increasingly sorted by automatic sorting machines. The main dilemma faced by postal operators when organizing the sorting stage is whether to have a smaller number of large, centralized sorting centers (a spoke–hub distribution paradigm) or a larger number of smaller sorting centers along with a larger number of direct connections between all of them (point-to-point transit).

Transportation is the process of carrying mail from one place to another. A mailpiece usually has to be transported from one sorting center to another sorting center, where it is often sorted to another transportation segment headed towards its destination address, until it reaches the sorting center that directly serves that address.

Delivery is the process of carrying mail to final destinations such as letter boxes. Sorting centers sort mailpieces destined for addresses in their immediate vicinity to carriers serving those addresses. Transporting mail to final destinations is the most labor-intensive stage and accounts for up to 50% of postal operators&#x27; expenses. Depending upon the final destination, carriers often use vehicles, their own feet, or a combination of both. Postal operators try to control costs by presorting mail for carriers, so that they receive mail already arranged in the correct sequence for their designated routes; reducing the frequency of deliveries; or retiming deliveries so that they are spread throughout the day.

<doc id="51142" wikidata="Q752877" url="?curid=51142" title="William Riker">
<text>William Thomas &quot;Will&quot; Riker is a fictional character in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe appearing primarily as a main character in &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation,&quot; portrayed by Jonathan Frakes. Throughout the series and its accompanying films, he is the &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s first officer, and briefly captain, until he accepts command of the USS &quot;Titan&quot; at the end of &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot;. He is the husband of Deanna Troi.

==Casting==
Frakes went to seven auditions over six weeks before being cast as Riker. Frakes stated: Frakes was not the first choice for the part of Riker, Patrick Stewart was the number one choice when casting began. Michael O&#x27;Gorman, Ben Murphy, and Gregg Marx were also considered for the role.

==Depiction==
===&quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;===
Riker is usually referred to as &quot;Will&quot;. He is also usually (and informally) called &quot;Number One&quot; by Captain Picard, because of his position as first officer on the &quot;Enterprise&quot;.

Riker was originally scripted as a much more serious, by-the-book officer, but by the middle episodes of the first season, it was felt that he was too &quot;official&quot;, and his character was toned down and became more of a ladies&#x27; man. For the first two seasons, Riker is portrayed as a bold, confident and sometimes arrogant, ambitious young officer; however, over time he becomes more reserved, as experience teaches him the wisdom of a patient, careful approach. He becomes comfortable on the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, repeatedly turning down offers of his own command, and he learns to cherish his fellow officers&#x27; company. Nonetheless, he retains a willingness to occasionally disregard the chain of command.

Although Riker was clean-shaven for the first season, he grew a beard at the start of the second season that later became something of a trademark. Between sessions, Frakes grew a beard for his role in the Civil War miniseries &quot;North and South&quot;, and Gene Roddenberry asked him to keep it because he thought it made Riker look more nautical. Because Frakes&#x27; beard coincided with what fans and critics perceived as an improvement of the show&#x27;s writing quality, &quot;growing the beard&quot; has become an internet colloquialism for a once subpar television series achieving a dramatic level of improvement. Riker did shave his mustache and beard during the events of &quot;Star Trek Insurrection&quot;, to the amusement of Data.

Riker&#x27;s background is first explored in the second-season episode &quot;The Icarus Factor&quot;. In the episode, Riker&#x27;s estranged father, Kyle, visits the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to offer his son the command of the USS &quot;Aries&quot;, which Riker refuses. We learn that Riker grew up in Alaska; that his mother, Elizabeth (Betty), died when he was two; and that he was raised by his father until age 15, when he left home. In the episode, Riker had not spoken with his father for 15 years, but they manage to partially mend their relationship over a game of martial-arts sparring called Anbo-jitsu. In the episode &quot;Lower Decks&quot;, a waiter at Ten Forward mistakenly states that Riker is Canadian, and in the same episode Riker clarifies that he grew up in Alaska. According to the &quot;Voyager&quot; episode &quot;Death Wish&quot; (in which Riker made a guest appearance), Riker&#x27;s distant ancestors also lived in the United States: During the American Civil War, his ancestor Colonel Thaddeus Riker fought on the Union side as an officer in the 102nd New York Infantry Regiment during the Atlanta Campaign.

In the two-part episode &quot;The Best of Both Worlds&quot; Riker takes command of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, promoted to the rank of captain through a field promotion, and orchestrates Picard&#x27;s rescue. This episode also explores the idea of Riker being unwilling to take chances since he had grown comfortable in his role as First Officer aboard the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. By the end of the episode, when he orders the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to fire on former Captain Picard, now Locutus of Borg, Riker has grown into a more confident leader. The sixth-season episode &quot;Second Chances&quot; reveals that Will Riker was duplicated long ago by a transporter malfunction. The &quot;second&quot; Riker takes the name &quot;Thomas&quot;, which is revealed to be William Riker&#x27;s middle name. In the seventh-season episode &quot;The &quot;Pegasus&quot;&quot;, Riker must confront his former commanding officer, Admiral Erik Pressman, over a cover-up related to the destruction of the USS &quot;Pegasus&quot;. The &quot;Pegasus&quot; had illegally developed a radically different type of cloaking device that also allowed it to phase through matter, resulting in it becoming fused within an asteroid when unstable power consumption forced the cloaking device offline. In the &quot;Enterprise&quot; series finale, Riker appears as a never before seen cook discussing matters of life, duty, and sacrifice with the crew. It is revealed that his presence is part of a holodeck simulation of historic events that Riker initiated to help himself make the decision to inform Captain Picard of the illegal research once conducted by Admiral Pressman aboard the &quot;Pegasus&quot;.

Before the beginning of the series, Riker was involved in a romantic relationship with Counselor Troi on her home planet Betazed. They often refer to each other as &quot;imzadi&quot;, a Betazoid term of endearment meaning &quot;soulmate&quot;. The novel &quot;Imzadi&quot; takes place before the beginning of the series and explores the history of the relationship between the two characters. The two characters are close friends throughout the series, but their relationship does not resume until &quot;Star Trek: Insurrection&quot;, the third &quot;Star Trek&quot; film set in the &quot;Next Generation&quot; era, although Thomas Riker, the duplicate created by a transporter malfunction, attempts to respark their relationship in &quot;Second Chances&quot;. The following movie, &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot;, begins with their wedding reception on board the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-E. At the start of the film, Riker finally accepts a promotion to captain and an offer to command the USS &quot;Titan&quot;; during the movie&#x27;s final scenes he bids Picard, and the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, farewell.

===&quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;===
Riker guest-starred along with Q in the &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; episode &quot;Death Wish&quot;.

===&quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;===
Frakes reprised his role of Commander Riker in the 2005 &quot;Enterprise&quot; series finale, &quot;These Are the Voyages...&quot;.

===&quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;===
Riker returns to the screen in the &quot;Nepenthe&quot; episode of &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;. In that episode, taking place in 2399, Riker is married to Deanna Troi; they have two children, Thad (now deceased) and Kestra. Picard and his gynoid companion Soji visit the Rikers&#x27; home, a National Parks-style lodge on the planet Nepenthe, and are welcomed with open arms. Will and Deanna are retired from Starfleet although Will describes his status as being on &quot;active reserve.&quot;

Riker makes another &quot;Picard&quot; appearance in the Season 1 finale &quot;Et in Arcadia Ego, Part II&quot;. In that episode, Riker has been reinstated to active duty. He is temporarily in command of the USS &quot;Zheng He&quot;, the lead ship in a Starfleet squadron sent to the planet Coppelius to protect its inhabitants from imminent Romulan attack.

Riker, along with other former members of the crew of the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D, return for an extended story arc in the third and final season of &quot;Picard&quot;, wherein they fight a rogue Changeling conspiracy against the Federation. Riker appears from the season premiere onward (as of the fourth episode), and is acting captain of the successor to the ship he was given command of at the end of &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot;, continuing in &quot;Star Trek: Lower Decks&quot;in the third and fourth episodes. While conducting a heist at the advanced research center the Daystrom Institute on Picard&#x27;s behalf, Riker is captured by the rogue Changelings, and reunited with Deanna in the sixth episode. Riker had fallen into an existential crisis after Thad&#x27;s death, and their relationship had turned into one of toxic codependency and longing for adventure, necessitating their temporary separation and Picard&#x27;s help. Their former crewmate Worf rescues the couple and brings them aboard the &quot;Titan&quot; in the eighth episode, reuniting the crew of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;.

===&quot;Star Trek: Lower Decks&quot;===
Riker appears in &quot;No Small Parts&quot;, the 2020 finale of the first season of &quot;Star Trek: Lower Decks&quot;, as captain of the USS &quot;Titan&quot; (NCC-80102) alongside his wife Deanna Troicontinuing a posting announced in dialogue at the end of &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot; (2002). Riker appeared in the second season&#x27;s first and second episodes.

==Alternate versions==
Frakes appeared in dual roles in &quot;Second Chances&quot;, a &quot;TNG&quot; episode where it was established that a duplicate of him was created years earlier by a transporter malfunction. Frakes appeared as the duplicate, Thomas Riker, in the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;Defiant&quot;, where Thomas impersonates William in order to commandeer the on behalf of the Maquis.

==Popular culture==
In 1993, mainframe software company Boole &amp; Babbage announced that it had signed a two-year licensing agreement, paying Paramount Pictures $75,000 a year, to use &quot;Star Trek&quot; imagery in advertising for its products. Boole &amp; Babbage&#x27;s campaign used actor Jonathan Frakes, playing his character of Commander William Riker, in their &quot;Star Trek&quot;-themed advertisements.

==Reception==
In 2009, &quot;IGN&quot; rated William Riker the 22nd best character of all &quot;Star Trek&quot; up to that time.

In 2016, &quot;Wired&quot; magazine ranked First Officer Riker as the 6th most important character of Starfleet within the &quot;Star Trek&quot; science fiction universe.

In 2017, IndieWire ranked Riker as the 2nd best character on &quot;Star Trek:The Next Generation&quot;.

In March 2018, &quot;TheWrap&quot; placed William Riker as 5th out 39 in a ranking of main cast characters of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. In October 2018, CBR ranked Riker as the 12th best Starfleet character of &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

In 2019, &quot;CinemaBlend&quot; ranked Riker the fifth best Starfleet character of all time. They point out he is good at his job as &quot;Number One&quot;, first officer to Captain Picard on the starship USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; 1701-D.

<doc id="51143" wikidata="Q723219" url="?curid=51143" title="Giant-impact hypothesis">
<text>The giant-impact hypothesis, sometimes called the Theia Impact, is an astrogeology hypothesis for the formation of the Moon first proposed in 1946 by Canadian geologist Reginald Daly. The hypothesis suggests that the Early Earth collided with a Mars-sized protoplanet of the same orbit approximately 4.5 billion years ago in the early Hadean eon (about 20 to 100 million years after the Solar System coalesced), and the ejecta of the impact event later accreted to form the Moon. The impactor planet is sometimes called Theia, named after the mythical Greek Titan who was the mother of Selene, the goddess of the Moon.

Analysis of lunar rocks published in a 2016 report suggests that the impact might have been a direct hit, causing a fragmentation and thorough mixing of both parent bodies.

The giant-impact hypothesis is currently the favored hypothesis for lunar formation among astronomers. Evidence that supports this hypothesis includes:
* The Moon&#x27;s orbit has a similar orientation to Earth&#x27;s rotation, both of which are at a similar angle to the ecliptic plane of the Solar System.
* The stable isotope ratios of lunar and terrestrial rock are identical, implying a common origin.
* The Earth–Moon system contains an anomalously high angular momentum, meaning the momentum contained in Earth&#x27;s rotation, the Moon&#x27;s rotation and the Moon revolving around Earth is significantly higher than the other terrestrial planets. A giant impact might have supplied this excess momentum.
* Moon samples indicate that the Moon was once molten to a substantial, but unknown, depth. This might have required much more energy than predicted to be available from the accretion of a celestial body of the Moon&#x27;s size and mass. An extremely energetic process, such as a giant impact, could provide this energy.
* The Moon has a relatively small iron core, which gives it a much lower density than Earth. Computer models of a giant impact of a Mars-sized body with Earth indicate the impactor&#x27;s core would likely penetrate deep into Earth and fuse with its own core. This would leave the Moon, which was formed from the ejecta of lighter crust and mantle fragments that went beyond the Roche limit and were not pulled back by gravity to re-fuse with Earth, with less remaining metallic iron than other planetary bodies.
* The Moon is depleted in volatile elements compared to Earth. Vaporizing at comparably lower temperatures, they could be lost in a high-energy event, with the Moon&#x27;s smaller gravity unable to recapture them while Earth did.
* There is evidence in other star systems of similar collisions, resulting in debris discs.
* Giant collisions are consistent with the leading theory of the formation of the Solar System.

However, several questions remain concerning the best current models of the giant-impact hypothesis. The energy of such a giant impact is predicted to have heated Earth to produce a global magma ocean, and evidence of the resultant planetary differentiation of the heavier material sinking into Earth&#x27;s mantle has been documented. However, there is no self-consistent model that starts with the giant-impact event and follows the evolution of the debris into a single moon. Other remaining questions include when the Moon lost its share of volatile elements and why Venuswhich experienced giant impacts during its formationdoes not host a similar moon.

In 1898, George Darwin made the suggestion that Earth and the Moon were once a single body. Darwin&#x27;s hypothesis was that a molten Moon had been spun from Earth because of centrifugal forces, and this became the dominant academic explanation. Using Newtonian mechanics, he calculated that the Moon had orbited much more closely in the past and was drifting away from Earth. This drifting was later confirmed by American and Soviet experiments, using laser ranging targets placed on the Moon.

Nonetheless, Darwin&#x27;s calculations could not resolve the mechanics required to trace the Moon back to the surface of Earth. In 1946, Reginald Aldworth Daly of Harvard University challenged Darwin&#x27;s explanation, adjusting it to postulate that the creation of the Moon was caused by an impact rather than centrifugal forces. Little attention was paid to Professor Daly&#x27;s challenge until a conference on satellites in 1974, during which the idea was reintroduced and later published and discussed in &quot;Icarus&quot; in 1975 by William K. Hartmann and Donald R. Davis. Their models suggested that, at the end of the planet formation period, several satellite-sized bodies had formed that could collide with the planets or be captured. They proposed that one of these objects might have collided with Earth, ejecting refractory, volatile-poor dust that could coalesce to form the Moon. This collision could potentially explain the unique geological and geochemical properties of the Moon.

A similar approach was taken by Canadian astronomer Alastair G. W. Cameron and American astronomer William R. Ward, who suggested that the Moon was formed by the tangential impact upon Earth of a body the size of Mars. It is hypothesized that most of the outer silicates of the colliding body would be vaporized, whereas a metallic core would not. Hence, most of the collisional material sent into orbit would consist of silicates, leaving the coalescing Moon deficient in iron. The more volatile materials that were emitted during the collision probably would escape the Solar System, whereas silicates would tend to coalesce.

Eighteen months prior to an October 1984 conference on lunar origins, Bill Hartmann, Roger Phillips, and Jeff Taylor challenged fellow lunar scientists: &quot;You have eighteen months. Go back to your Apollo data, go back to your computer, and do whatever you have to, but make up your mind. Don&#x27;t come to our conference unless you have something to say about the Moon&#x27;s birth.&quot; At the 1984 conference at Kona, Hawaii, the giant-impact hypothesis emerged as the most favored hypothesis. 
==Theia==

The name of the hypothesised protoplanet is derived from the mythical Greek titan Theia , who gave birth to the Moon goddess Selene. This designation was proposed initially by the English geochemist Alex N. Halliday in 2000 and has become accepted in the scientific community. According to modern theories of planet formation, Theia was part of a population of Mars-sized bodies that existed in the Solar System 4.5 billion years ago. One of the attractive features of the giant-impact hypothesis is that the formation of the Moon and Earth align; during the course of its formation, Earth is thought to have experienced dozens of collisions with planet-sized bodies. The Moon-forming collision would have been only one such &quot;giant impact&quot; but certainly the last significant impactor event. The Late Heavy Bombardment by much smaller asteroids may have occurred laterapproximately 3.9 billion years ago.

==Basic model==
Astronomers think the collision between Earth and Theia happened at about 4.4 to 4.45 billion years ago (bya); about 0.1 billion years after the Solar System began to form. In astronomical terms, the impact would have been of moderate velocity. Theia is thought to have struck Earth at an oblique angle when Earth was nearly fully formed. Computer simulations of this &quot;late-impact&quot; scenario suggest an initial impactor velocity below at &quot;infinity&quot; (far enough that gravitational attraction is not a factor), increasing as it approached to over at impact, and an impact angle of about 45°. However, oxygen isotope abundance in lunar rock suggests &quot;vigorous mixing&quot; of Theia and Earth, indicating a steep impact angle. Theia&#x27;s iron core would have sunk into the young Earth&#x27;s core, and most of Theia&#x27;s mantle accreted onto Earth&#x27;s mantle. However, a significant portion of the mantle material from both Theia and Earth would have been ejected into orbit around Earth (if ejected with velocities between orbital velocity and escape velocity) or into individual orbits around the Sun (if ejected at higher velocities).

Modelling has hypothesised that material in orbit around Earth may have accreted to form the Moon in three consecutive phases; accreting first from the bodies initially present outside Earth&#x27;s Roche limit, which acted to confine the inner disk material within the Roche limit. The inner disk slowly and viscously spread back out to Earth&#x27;s Roche limit, pushing along outer bodies via resonant interactions. After several tens of years, the disk spread beyond the Roche limit, and started producing new objects that continued the growth of the Moon, until the inner disk was depleted in mass after several hundreds of years. Material in stable Kepler orbits was thus likely to hit the Earth–Moon system sometime later (because the Earth–Moon system&#x27;s Kepler orbit around the Sun also remains stable). Estimates based on computer simulations of such an event suggest that some twenty percent of the original mass of Theia would have ended up as an orbiting ring of debris around Earth, and about half of this matter coalesced into the Moon. Earth would have gained significant amounts of angular momentum and mass from such a collision. Regardless of the speed and tilt of Earth&#x27;s rotation before the impact, it would have experienced a day some five hours long after the impact, and Earth&#x27;s equator and the Moon&#x27;s orbit would have become coplanar.

Not all of the ring material need have been swept up right away: the thickened crust of the Moon&#x27;s far side suggests the possibility that a second moon about in diameter formed in a Lagrange point of the Moon. The smaller moon may have remained in orbit for tens of millions of years. As the two moons migrated outward from Earth, solar tidal effects would have made the Lagrange orbit unstable, resulting in a slow-velocity collision that &quot;pancaked&quot; the smaller moon onto what is now the far side of the Moon, adding material to its crust.
Lunar magma cannot pierce through the thick crust of the far side, causing fewer lunar maria, while the near side has a thin crust displaying the large maria visible from Earth.
Above a high resolution threshold for simulations, a study published in 2022 finds that giant impacts can immediately place a satellite with similar mass and iron content to the Moon into orbit far outside Earth&#x27;s Roche limit. Even satellites that initially pass within the Roche limit can reliably and predictably survive, by being partially stripped and then torqued onto wider, stable orbits. Furthermore, the outer layers of these directly formed satellites are molten over cooler interiors and are composed of around 60% proto-Earth material. This could alleviate the tension between the Moon&#x27;s Earth-like isotopic composition and the different signature expected for the impactor. Immediate formation opens up new options for the Moon&#x27;s early orbit and evolution, including the possibility of a highly tilted orbit to explain the lunar inclination, and offers a simpler, single-stage scenario for the origin of the Moon.

== Composition ==
In 2001, a team at the Carnegie Institution of Washington reported that the rocks from the Apollo program carried an isotopic signature that was identical with rocks from Earth, and were different from almost all other bodies in the Solar System.

In 2014, a team in Germany reported that the Apollo samples had a slightly different isotopic signature from Earth rocks. The difference was slight, but statistically significant. One possible explanation is that Theia formed near Earth.

This empirical data showing close similarity of composition can be explained only by the standard giant-impact hypothesis, as it is extremely unlikely that two bodies prior to collision had such similar composition.

=== Equilibration hypothesis ===
In 2007, researchers from the California Institute of Technology showed that the likelihood of Theia having an identical isotopic signature as Earth was very small (less than 1 percent). They proposed that in the aftermath of the giant impact, while Earth and the proto-lunar disc were molten and vaporised, the two reservoirs were connected by a common silicate vapor atmosphere and that the Earth–Moon system became homogenised by convective stirring while the system existed in the form of a continuous fluid. Such an &quot;equilibration&quot; between the post-impact Earth and the proto-lunar disc is the only proposed scenario that explains the isotopic similarities of the Apollo rocks with rocks from Earth&#x27;s interior. For this scenario to be viable, however, the proto-lunar disc would have to endure for about 100 years. Work is ongoing to determine whether or not this is possible.

===Direct collision hypothesis===
According to research (2012) to explain similar compositions of the Earth and the Moon based on simulations at the University of Bern by physicist Andreas Reufer and his colleagues, Theia collided directly with Earth instead of barely swiping it. The collision speed may have been higher than originally assumed, and this higher velocity may have totally destroyed Theia. According to this modification, the composition of Theia is not so restricted, making a composition of up to 50% water ice possible.

=== Synestia hypothesis ===
One effort, in 2018, to homogenise the products of the collision was to energise the primary body by way of a greater pre-collision rotational speed. This way, more material from the primary body would be spun off to form the Moon. Further computer modelling determined that the observed result could be obtained by having the pre-Earth body spinning very rapidly, so much so that it formed a new celestial object which was given the name &#x27;synestia&#x27;. This is an unstable state that could have been generated by yet another collision to get the rotation spinning fast enough. Further modelling of this transient structure has shown that the primary body spinning as a doughnut-shaped object (the synestia) existed for about a century (a very short time) before it cooled down and gave birth to Earth and the Moon.

=== Terrestrial magma ocean hypothesis ===

Another model, in 2019, to explain the similarity of Earth and the Moon&#x27;s compositions posits that shortly after Earth formed, it was covered by a sea of hot magma, while the impacting object was likely made of solid material. Modelling suggests that this would lead to the impact heating the magma much more than solids from the impacting object, leading to more material being ejected from the proto-Earth, so that about 80% of the Moon-forming debris originated from the proto-Earth. Many prior models had suggested 80% of the Moon coming from the impactor.

== Evidence ==
Indirect evidence for the giant impact scenario comes from rocks collected during the Apollo Moon landings, which show oxygen isotope ratios nearly identical to those of Earth. The highly anorthositic composition of the lunar crust, as well as the existence of KREEP-rich samples, suggest that a large portion of the Moon once was molten; and a giant impact scenario could easily have supplied the energy needed to form such a magma ocean. Several lines of evidence show that if the Moon has an iron-rich core, it must be a small one. In particular, the mean density, moment of inertia, rotational signature, and magnetic induction response of the Moon all suggest that the radius of its core is less than about 25% the radius of the Moon, in contrast to about 50% for most of the other terrestrial bodies. Appropriate impact conditions satisfying the angular momentum constraints of the Earth–Moon system yield a Moon formed mostly from the mantles of Earth and the impactor, while the core of the impactor accretes to Earth. Earth has the highest density of all the planets in the Solar System; the absorption of the core of the impactor body explains this observation, given the proposed properties of the early Earth and Theia.

Comparison of the zinc isotopic composition of lunar samples with that of Earth and Mars rocks provides further evidence for the impact hypothesis. Zinc is strongly fractionated when volatilised in planetary rocks, but not during normal igneous processes, so zinc abundance and isotopic composition can distinguish the two geological processes. Moon rocks contain more heavy isotopes of zinc, and overall less zinc, than corresponding igneous Earth or Mars rocks, which is consistent with zinc being depleted from the Moon through evaporation, as expected for the giant impact origin.

Collisions between ejecta escaping Earth&#x27;s gravity and asteroids would have left impact heating signatures in stony meteorites; analysis based on assuming the existence of this effect has been used to date the impact event to 4.47 billion years ago, in agreement with the date obtained by other means.

Warm silica-rich dust and abundant SiO gas, products of high velocity impactsover between rocky bodies, have been detected by the Spitzer Space Telescope around the nearby (29 pc distant) young (~12 My old) star HD 172555 in the Beta Pictoris moving group. A belt of warm dust in a zone between 0.25AU and 2AU from the young star HD 23514 in the Pleiades cluster appears similar to the predicted results of Theia&#x27;s collision with the embryonic Earth, and has been interpreted as the result of planet-sized objects colliding with each other. A similar belt of warm dust was detected around the star BD+20°307 (HIP 8920, SAO 75016).

On 1 November 2023, scientists reported that, according to computer simulations, remnants of Theia could be still visible inside the Earth as two giant anomalies of the Earth&#x27;s mantle.

== Difficulties ==
This lunar origin hypothesis has some difficulties that have yet to be resolved. For example, the giant-impact hypothesis implies that a surface magma ocean would have formed following the impact. Yet there is no evidence that Earth ever had such a magma ocean and it is likely there exists material that has never been processed in a magma ocean.

=== Composition ===
A number of compositional inconsistencies need to be addressed.

* The ratios of the Moon&#x27;s volatile elements are not explained by the giant-impact hypothesis. If the giant-impact hypothesis is correct, these ratios must be due to some other cause.
* The presence of volatiles such as water trapped in lunar basalts and carbon emissions from the lunar surface is more difficult to explain if the Moon was caused by a high-temperature impact.
* The iron oxide (FeO) content (13%) of the Moon, intermediate between that of Mars (18%) and the terrestrial mantle (8%), rules out most of the source of the proto-lunar material from Earth&#x27;s mantle.
* If the bulk of the proto-lunar material had come from an impactor, the Moon should be enriched in siderophilic elements, when, in fact, it is deficient in them.
* The Moon&#x27;s oxygen isotopic ratios are essentially identical to those of Earth. Oxygen isotopic ratios, which may be measured very precisely, yield a unique and distinct signature for each Solar System body. If a separate proto-planet Theia had existed, it probably would have had a different oxygen isotopic signature than Earth, as would the ejected mixed material.
* The Moon&#x27;s titanium isotope ratio (50Ti/47Ti) appears so close to Earth&#x27;s (within 4 ppm), that little if any of the colliding body&#x27;s mass could likely have been part of the Moon.

=== Lack of a Venusian moon ===
If the Moon was formed by such an impact, it is possible that other inner planets also may have been subjected to comparable impacts. A moon that formed around Venus by this process would have been unlikely to escape. If such a moon-forming event had occurred there, a possible explanation of why the planet does not have such a moon might be that a second collision occurred that countered the angular momentum from the first impact. Another possibility is that the strong tidal forces from the Sun would tend to destabilise the orbits of moons around close-in planets. For this reason, if Venus&#x27;s slow rotation rate began early in its history, any satellites larger than a few kilometers in diameter would likely have spiraled inwards and collided with Venus.

Simulations of the chaotic period of terrestrial planet formation suggest that impacts like those hypothesised to have formed the Moon were common. For typical terrestrial planets with a mass of 0.5 to 1 Earth masses, such an impact typically results in a single moon containing 4% of the host planet&#x27;s mass. The inclination of the resulting moon&#x27;s orbit is random, but this tilt affects the subsequent dynamic evolution of the system. For example, some orbits may cause the moon to spiral back into the planet. Likewise, the proximity of the planet to the star will also affect the orbital evolution. The net effect is that it is more likely for impact-generated moons to survive when they orbit more distant terrestrial planets and are aligned with the planetary orbit.

== Possible origin of Theia ==

In 2004, Princeton University mathematician Edward Belbruno and astrophysicist J. Richard Gott III proposed that Theia coalesced at the or Lagrangian point relative to Earth (in about the same orbit and about 60° ahead or behind), similar to a trojan asteroid. Two-dimensional computer models suggest that the stability of Theia&#x27;s proposed trojan orbit would have been affected when its growing mass exceeded a threshold of approximately 10% of Earth&#x27;s mass (the mass of Mars). In this scenario, gravitational perturbations by planetesimals caused Theia to depart from its stable Lagrangian location, and subsequent interactions with proto-Earth led to a collision between the two bodies.

In 2008, evidence was presented that suggests that the collision might have occurred later than the accepted value of 4.53 Gya, at approximately 4.48 Gya. A 2014 comparison of computer simulations with elemental abundance measurements in Earth&#x27;s mantle indicated that the collision occurred approximately 95 My after the formation of the Solar System.

It has been suggested that other significant objects might have been created by the impact, which could have remained in orbit between Earth and the Moon, stuck in Lagrangian points. Such objects might have stayed within the Earth–Moon system for as long as 100 million years, until the gravitational tugs of other planets destabilised the system enough to free the objects. A study published in 2011 suggested that a subsequent collision between the Moon and one of these smaller bodies caused the notable differences in physical characteristics between the two hemispheres of the Moon. This collision, simulations have supported, would have been at a low enough velocity so as not to form a crater; instead, the material from the smaller body would have spread out across the Moon (in what would become its far side), adding a thick layer of highlands crust. The resulting mass irregularities would subsequently produce a gravity gradient that resulted in tidal locking of the Moon so that today, only the near side remains visible from Earth. However, mapping by the GRAIL mission has ruled out this scenario.

In 2019, a team at the University of Münster reported that the molybdenum isotopic composition in Earth&#x27;s primitive mantle originates from the outer Solar System, hinting at the source of water on Earth. One possible explanation is that Theia originated in the outer Solar System.

==Alternative hypotheses==
Other mechanisms that have been suggested at various times for the Moon&#x27;s origin are that the Moon was spun off from Earth&#x27;s molten surface by centrifugal force; that it was formed elsewhere and was subsequently captured by Earth&#x27;s gravitational field; or that Earth and the Moon formed at the same time and place from the same accretion disk. None of these hypotheses can account for the high angular momentum of the Earth–Moon system.

Another hypothesis attributes the formation of the Moon to the impact of a large asteroid with Earth much later than previously thought, creating the satellite primarily from debris from Earth. In this hypothesis, the formation of the Moon occurs 60–140 million years after the formation of the Solar System (as compared to hypothesized Theia impact at 4.527 ± 0.010 billion years). The asteroid impact in this scenario would have created a magma ocean on Earth and the proto-Moon with both bodies sharing a common plasma metal vapor atmosphere. The shared metal vapor bridge would have allowed material from Earth and the proto-Moon to exchange and equilibrate into a more common composition.

Yet another hypothesis proposes that the Moon and Earth formed together, not from the collision of once-distant bodies. This model, published in 2012 by Robin M. Canup, suggests that the Moon and Earth formed from a massive collision of two planetary bodies, each larger than Mars, which then re-collided to form what is now called Earth. After the re-collision, Earth was surrounded by a disk of material which accreted to form the Moon.

<text>Originating in vocal jazz, scat singing or scatting is vocal improvisation with wordless vocables, nonsense syllables or without words at all. In scat singing, the singer improvises melodies and rhythms using the voice solely as an instrument rather than a speaking medium. This is different from vocalese, which uses recognizable lyrics that are sung to pre-existing instrumental solos.

== Characteristics ==
=== Structure and syllable choice ===
Though scat singing is improvised, the melodic lines are often variations on scale and arpeggio fragments, stock patterns and riffs, as is the case with instrumental improvisers. As well, scatting usually incorporates musical structure. All of Ella Fitzgerald&#x27;s scat performances of &quot;How High the Moon&quot;, for instance, use the same tempo, begin with a chorus of a straight reading of the lyric, move to a &quot;specialty chorus&quot; introducing the scat chorus, and then the scat itself. Will Friedwald has compared Ella Fitzgerald to Chuck Jones directing his Roadrunner cartoon—each uses predetermined formulas in innovative ways.

The deliberate choice of scat syllables is also a key element in vocal jazz improvisation. Syllable choice influences the pitch, articulation, coloration, and resonance of the performance. Syllable choice also differentiated jazz singers&#x27; personal styles: Betty Carter was inclined to use sounds like &quot;louie-ooie-la-la-la&quot; (soft-tongued sounds or liquids) while Sarah Vaughan would prefer &quot;shoo-doo-shoo-bee-ooo-bee&quot; (fricatives, plosives, and open vowels). The choice of scat syllables can also be used to reflect the sounds of different instruments. The comparison of the scatting styles of Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughan reveals that Fitzgerald&#x27;s improvisation mimics the sounds of swing-era big bands with which she performed, while Vaughan&#x27;s mimics that of her accompanying bop-era small combos.

=== Humor and quotation ===
Humor is another important element of scat singing. Bandleader Cab Calloway exemplified the use of humorous scatting. Other examples of humorous scatting include Slim Gaillard, Leo Watson, and Bam Brown&#x27;s 1945 song &quot;Avocado Seed Soup Symphony,&quot; in which the singers scat variations on the word &quot;avocado&quot; for much of the recording.

In addition to such nonsensical uses of language, humor is communicated in scat singing through the use of musical quotation. Leo Watson, who performed before the canon of American popular music, frequently drew on nursery rhymes in his scatting. This is called using a compression. Similarly, Ella Fitzgerald&#x27;s scatting, for example, drew extensively on popular music. In her 1960 recording of &quot;How High the Moon&quot; live in Berlin, she quotes over a dozen songs, including &quot;The Peanut Vendor,&quot; &quot;Heat Wave,&quot; &quot;A-Tisket, A-Tasket,&quot; and &quot;Smoke Gets in Your Eyes.&quot;

== History ==
=== Origins ===
Improvisational singing of nonsense syllables occurs in many cultures, such as diddling or lilting in Ireland, German yodeling, Sámi joik, and speaking in tongues in various religious traditions. 

Although Louis Armstrong&#x27;s 1926 recording of &quot;Heebie Jeebies&quot; is often cited as the first modern song to employ scatting, there are many earlier examples. One early master of ragtime scat singing was Gene Greene who recorded scat choruses in his song &quot;King of the Bungaloos&quot; and several others between 1911 and 1917. Entertainer Al Jolson scatted through a few bars in the middle of his 1911 recording of &quot;That Haunting Melody.&quot; Gene Greene&#x27;s 1917 &quot;From Here to Shanghai,&quot; which featured faux-Chinese scatting, and Gene Rodemich&#x27;s 1924 &quot;Scissor Grinder Joe&quot; and &quot;Some of These Days&quot; also pre-date Armstrong. Cliff &quot;Ukulele Ike&quot; Edwards scatted an interlude on his 1923 &quot;Old Fashioned Love&quot; in lieu of using an instrumental soloist. One of the early female singers to use scat was Aileen Stanley, who included it at the end of a duet with Billy Murray in their hit 1924 recording of &quot;It Had To Be You&quot; (Victor 19373).

Jazz pianist Jelly Roll Morton credited Joe Sims of Vicksburg, Mississippi, as the creator of scat around the turn of the 20th century. In a conversation between Alan Lomax and Jelly Roll Morton, Morton recounted the history of scat:

Lomax: &quot;Well, what about some more scat songs, that you used to sing way back then?&quot;

Morton: &quot;Oh, I&#x27;ll sing you some scat songs. That was way before Louis Armstrong&#x27;s time. By the way, scat is something that a lot of people don&#x27;t understand, and they begin to believe that the first scat numbers was ever done, was done by one of my hometown boys, Louis Armstrong. But I must take the credit away, since I know better. The first man that ever did a scat number in history of this country was a man from Vicksburg, Mississippi, by the name of Joe Sims, an old comedian. And from that, Tony Jackson and myself, and several more grabbed it in New Orleans. And found it was pretty good for an introduction of a song.&quot;

Lomax: &quot;What does scat mean?&quot;

Morton: &quot;Scat doesn&#x27;t mean anything but just something to give a song a flavor.&quot;
Morton also once boasted, &quot;Tony Jackson and myself were using scat for novelty back in 1906 and 1907 when Louis Armstrong was still in the orphan&#x27;s home.&quot; Don Redman and Fletcher Henderson also featured scat vocals in their 1925 recording of &quot;My Papa Doesn&#x27;t Two-Time No Time&quot; five months prior to Armstrong&#x27;s 1926 recording of &quot;Heebie Jeebies.&quot;

=== Heebie Jeebies ===
It was Armstrong&#x27;s February 1926 performance of &quot;Heebie Jeebies,&quot; however, that is considered the turning point for the medium. From the 1926 recording of &quot;Heebie Jeebies&quot; arose the techniques that would form the foundation of modern scat. In a possibly apocryphal story, Armstrong claimed that, when he was recording &quot;Heebie Jeebies&quot; with his band The Hot Five, his sheet music fell off the stand and onto the ground. Not knowing the lyrics to the song, he invented a gibberish melody to fill time, expecting the cut to be thrown out in the end, but that take of the song was the one released: 

Armstrong&#x27;s &quot;Heebie Jeebies&quot; became a national bestseller and, consequently, the practice of scatting &quot;became closely associated with Armstrong.&quot; The song would serve as a model for Cab Calloway, whose 1930s scat solos inspired George Gershwin&#x27;s use of the medium in his 1935 opera &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;.

=== Widespread adoption ===

Following the success of Armstrong&#x27;s &quot;Heebie Jeebies,&quot; a number of popular songs featured scat singing. In June 1927, Harry Barris and Bing Crosby of bandleader Paul Whiteman&#x27;s &quot;The Rhythm Boys&quot; scatted on several songs including &quot;Mississippi Mud,&quot; which Barris had composed.

On October 26, 1927, Duke Ellington&#x27;s Orchestra recorded &quot;Creole Love Call&quot; featuring Adelaide Hall singing wordlessly. Hall&#x27;s wordless vocals and &quot;evocative growls&quot; were hailed as serving as &quot;another instrument.&quot; Although creativity must be shared between Ellington and Hall as he knew the style of performance he wanted, Hall was the one who was able to produce the sound. A year later, in October 1928, Ellington repeated the experiment in one of his versions of &quot;The Mooche,&quot; with Getrude &quot;Baby&quot; Cox singing scat after a muted similar trombone solo by Joe &quot;Tricky Sam&quot; Nanton.

During the Great Depression, acts such as The Boswell Sisters regularly employed scatting on their records, including the high complexity of scatting at the same time, in harmony. An example is their version of &quot;It Don&#x27;t Mean a Thing (If It Ain&#x27;t Got That Swing).&quot; The Boswell Sisters&#x27; &quot;inventive use of scat singing was a source for Ella Fitzgerald.&quot; As a young girl, Fitzgerald often practiced imitating Connee Boswell&#x27;s scatting for hours. 

Fitzgerald herself would become a talented scat singer and later claimed to be the &quot;best vocal improviser jazz has ever had,&quot; and critics since then have been in almost universal agreement with her. During this 1930s era, other famous scat singers included Scatman Crothers—who would go on to movie and television fame—and British dance band trumpeter and vocalist Nat Gonella whose scat-singing recordings were banned in Nazi Germany.

=== Later development ===
Over the years, as jazz music developed and grew in complexity, scat singing did as well. During the bop era of the 1940s, more highly developed vocal improvisation surged in popularity. Annie Ross, a bop singer, expressed a common sentiment among vocalists at the time: &quot;The [scat] music was so exciting, everyone wanted to do it.&quot; And many did: Eddie Jefferson, Betty Carter, Anita O&#x27;Day, Joe Carroll, Sarah Vaughan, Carmen McRae, Jon Hendricks, Babs Gonzales, Mel Torme and Dizzy Gillespie were all singers in the idiom. 

Free jazz and the influence of world musicians on the medium pushed jazz singing nearer to avant-garde art music. In the 1960s Ward Swingle was the product of an unusually liberal musical education. He took the scat singing idea and applied it to the works of Bach, creating The Swingle Singers. Scat singing was also used by Louis Prima and others in the song &quot;I Wan&#x27;na Be Like You&quot; in Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (1967).

The bop revival of the 1970s renewed interest in bop scat singing, and young scat singers viewed themselves as a continuation of the classic bop tradition. The medium continues to evolve, and vocal improvisation now often develops independently of changes in instrumental jazz.

During the mid-1990s, jazz artist John Paul Larkin (better known as Scatman John) renewed interest in the genre briefly when he began fusing jazz singing with pop music and electronica, scoring a world-wide hit with the song &quot;Scatman (Ski Ba Bop Ba Dop Bop)&quot; in 1994. Vocal improviser Bobby McFerrin&#x27;s performances have shown that &quot;wordless singing has traveled far from the concepts demonstrated by Louis Armstrong, Gladys Bentley, Cab Calloway, Anita O&#x27;Day, and Leo Watson.&quot;

=== Vocal bass ===
Vocal bass is a form of scat singing that is intended to vocally simulate instrumental basslines that are typically performed by bass players. A technique most commonly used by bass singers in a cappella groups is to simulate an instrumental rhythm section, often alongside a vocal percussionist or beatboxer. Some notable vocal bass artists are Tim Foust, Adam Chance, Bobby McFerrin, Al Jarreau, Reggie Watts, Alvin Chea, Joe Santoni, Avi Kaplan, Matt Sallee, Chris Morey, Geoff Castellucci.

=== Use in hip hop ===
Many hip hop artists and rappers use scat singing to come up with the rhythms of their raps. Tajai of the group Souls of Mischief states the following in the book &quot;How to Rap&quot;: &quot;Sometimes my rhythms come from scatting. I usually make a scat kind of skeleton and then fill in the words. I make a skeleton of the flow first, and then I put words into it.&quot; The group Lifesavas describe a similar process. Rapper Tech N9ne has been recorded demonstrating exactly how this method works, and gangsta rapper Eazy-E used it extensively in his song &quot;Eazy Street.&quot;

== Historical theories ==
Some writers have proposed that scat has its roots in African musical traditions. In much African music, &quot;human voice and instruments assume a kind of musical parity&quot; and are &quot;at times so close in timbre and so inextricably interwoven within the music&#x27;s fabric as to be nearly indistinguishable.&quot; Dick Higgins likewise attributes scat singing to traditions of sound poetry in African-American music. In West African music, it is typical to convert drum rhythms into vocal melodies; common rhythmic patterns are assigned specific syllabic translations. However, this theory fails to account for the existence—even in the earliest recorded examples of scatting—of free improvisation by the vocalist. It is therefore more likely that scat singing evolved independently in the United States.

Others have proposed that scat singing arose from jazz musicians&#x27; practice of formulating riffs vocally before performing them instrumentally. (The adage &quot;If you can&#x27;t sing it, you can&#x27;t play it&quot; was common in the early New Orleans jazz scene.) In this manner, soloists like Louis Armstrong became able to double as vocalists, switching effortlessly between instrumental solos and scatting.

Scat singing also resembles the Irish/Scottish practice of lilting or diddling, a type of vocal music that involves using nonsensical syllables to sing non-vocal dance tunes.

== Critical assessment ==
Scat singing can allow jazz singers to have the same improvisational opportunities as jazz instrumentalists: scatting can be rhythmically and harmonically improvisational without concern about the lyric. Especially when bebop was developing, singers found scat to be the best way to adequately engage in the performance of jazz.

Scatting may be desirable because it does not &quot;taint the music with the impurity of denotation.&quot; Instead of conveying linguistic content and pointing to something outside itself, scat music—like instrumental music—is self-referential and &quot;d[oes] what it mean[s].&quot; Through this wordlessness, commentators have written, scat singing can describe matters beyond words. Music critic Will Friedwald has written that Louis Armstrong&#x27;s scatting, for example, &quot;has tapped into his own core of emotion,&quot; releasing emotions &quot;so deep, so real&quot; that they are unspeakable; his words &quot;bypass our ears and our brains and go directly for our hearts and souls.&quot;

Scat singing has never been universally accepted, even by jazz enthusiasts. Writer and critic Leonard Feather offers an extreme view; he once said that &quot;scat singing—with only a couple exceptions—should be banned.&quot; He also wrote the lyrics to the jazz song &quot;Whisper Not,&quot; which Ella Fitzgerald then recorded on her 1966 Verve release of the same name. Many jazz singers, including Bessie Smith, Billie Holiday, Jimmy Rushing, and Dinah Washington, have avoided scat entirely.

<text>John Keith Wozniak (born January 19, 1971) is an American musician best known as the lead singer, guitarist and songwriter of the band Marcy Playground.

==Early life==

Wozniak was born and raised in Minneapolis. He learned how to play the guitar at the age of 14.

== Career ==
Wozniak&#x27;s first solo effort was &quot;Zog BogBean – From the Marcy Playground&quot; recorded in his own home in 1990. In 1996 he recorded his second solo album, &quot;Leaving Wonderland...in a fit of rage&quot; (Produced by Jeff Dawson) and while searching for a label to release it on, decided to call it a Marcy Playground album and include new songs recorded with the rest of the band.

Aside from influences such as Neil Young, Paul Simon, and Van Morrison, an early influence in his life was his high school girlfriend from tenth grade until his freshman year in college, Sherry Fraser, of the band Two Ton Boa. She collaborated with Wozniak on Zog Bogbean, and on the song &quot;Ancient Walls of Flowers&quot; from Marcy Playground&#x27;s self-titled album. The song &quot;Sherry Fraser&quot; was written about her.

Wozniak moved to Great Neck, Long Island, New York, in 1994 in order to collaborate with Jared Kotler, a multi-instrumentalist/music producer. Wozniak had written two albums worth of material and began recording what would become the eponymous &quot;Marcy Playground&quot; recordings at Sabella Recording Studio in Roslyn Heights, New York. More recording sessions followed with hiring Dylan Keefe as the band&#x27;s bass player. Over two albums of material were recorded at Sebella by engineer Ken Goia, and these recordings brought the band to the attention of Capitol Records. The band was soon signed to Capitol and began a year-long series of club dates in New York City performing live in support of &quot;Marcy Playground&quot;. The band then began a radio promotion tour of the U.S. following the release of the first single &quot;Poppies&quot;.

Follow-up single &quot;Sex and Candy&quot; was released shortly afterward. This song became very popular, rising to a then-record 15 weeks at number one on the U.S. Modern Rock Tracks chart. In 2012, &quot;Sex and Candy&quot; was named the fourth-best one-hit wonder of the 1990s by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. &quot;Sex and Candy&quot; has been covered by Maroon 5, Prozak, Slothrust, and others.

Wozniak continues to regularly write, record and tour with Marcy Playground.

== Other collaborations ==
* In 2003, Wozniak helped produce Canadian rock band Stabilo&#x27;s second album, recorded at John&#x27;s studio, Mushroom Studios.
* Later that year, Wozniak would work with Jimi Haha of the band Jimmie&#x27;s Chicken Shack to write the song &quot;Paper Dolls&quot;. The song appeared on both bands&#x27; albums in 2004.
* In 2006, Wozniak teamed up with Canadian hit-maker Daniel Powter (&quot;Bad Day&quot;) amongst other musicians to add new content to &quot;Leaving Wonderland...in a Fit of Rage&quot;, the solo album turned Marcy Playground album.

<text>The Wilsons Promontory National Park, commonly known as Wilsons Prom or The Prom, is a national park in the Gippsland region of Victoria, Australia, located approximately southeast of Melbourne.

The national park is the southernmost national park on mainland Australia, known for its rainforests, beaches and abundant wildlife. The national park covers the southern portion of Wilsons Promontory, a peninsula containing South Point, the southernmost point on the Australian mainland, and a number of islands. A lighthouse on the south-east corner of the peninsula is the southernmost lighthouse on mainland Australia and has operated continuously since 1859.

The Park is highly popular with bushwalkers and campers, and has a number of lodges and serviced camping near the mouth of Tidal River as well as a number of hike-in camping areas catering for bushwalkers.

==History==
The first Europeans to sight Wilsons Promontory are believed to be George Bass and Matthew Flinders in 1798.

Extensive sealing took place at Sealer&#x27;s Cove during the 19th Century, such that seals are no longer found there.

Lobbying by the Field Naturalists Club of Victoria (FNCV) and the Royal Society of Victoria (including Arthur Henry Shakespeare Lucas) led to the Government of Victoria temporarily reserving the area as National Park in 1898, made permanent in 1908. The original settlement in the Park was on the Darby River site, where a chalet existed. The FNCV has maintained a watching brief over the promontory for over 120 years.

The Wilsons Promontory was used as commando training area during World War II. A memorial to commandos who lost their lives in World War II is located at Tidal River.

A large section of the park was burnt out in April 2005 by a bushfire caused by a controlled burn that breached containment lines because of warmer and windier conditions than were forecast for that day, causing the evacuation of six-hundred people.

During the Black Saturday Fires of February 2009 throughout Victoria, trees in the Wilsons Promontory were struck by lightning, which then led to the loss of up to 50% of the national park through major fire damage.

==Camping==
Tidal River is the main location for accommodation and camping in Wilsons Promontory National Park. Tidal River Campground has 484 camping and caravan sites (including twelve powered sites) situated near the beach and river. There are also eleven remote walk-in sites located within the park.

Tidal River camping ground is nestled in sand dunes behind Norman Bay, on the western side of the peninsula. The only road open to visitors leads from Yanakie at the park entrance to Tidal River, a distance of 32 kilometres (20 mi). Yanakie is a dog friendly camp ground that can accommodate for large caravans as well as smaller tents. For those who wish to camp near Wilsons Promontory with their dog, it is a good alternative.

When fully occupied, the settlement of Tidal River swells to over 2,000 people. There is a visitor centre open daily, a general store which serves basic supermarket and emergency items, fish and chips and takeaway food. The outdoor cinema, established in the late 1940s, is a nostalgic favourite amongst summer campers who will sometimes line up for over an hour before tickets can be bought so they can save a seat in the front row with a blanket.

During summer, a ballot is held to allocate sites from Christmas until late January. Regardless of the time of year, all accommodation must be pre-booked.[3]

==Wildlife==

The Wilsons Promontory National Park is home to a wide range of wildlife species, including kangaroos, wombats, echidnas, emus, a wide range of small marsupials, and numerous species of birds, most prominent among which are the rosellas. Generally, the wildlife around Tidal River is accustomed to human presence, and many of the animals and birds near the campsites will approach humans, accept food from them, or even enter their tents uninvited. It is, however, illegal to feed wildlife and if one is found to be feeding them you will be issued with a fine by Parks Victoria staff.

Outside the camping area, the wildlife is less accustomed to humans, and may be more difficult to spot. Possums can be quite easily found with a torch at night, and kangaroos and emus are often seen in large numbers on either side of the road on the way in to the National Park. Swamp wallabies are frequently spotted on many of the walks, as are a variety of bird species. The northern section of the park is also home to an abundance of snakes.

Southern right whales nowadays show slow but steady recovery and started using the area as a nursery like what was used to be along with humpback whales that tend to pass through the area rather than long stay. Killer whales, dolphins, seals, sea lions, and penguins can be seen more regularly.

==Hiking==
The Prom has a number of different hiking trails. There are trails of differing levels of difficulty, including day hikes ranging from short strolls using beach access ramps up to longer two- or three-hour walks. There are also several overnight hiking options which can be combined into larger circuit hikes from 2 days upwards. There are also multi-day hikes in the northern section of the park which require walkers to have good navigational skills. A permit is required for all overnight hiking.
A portion of the peninsula is warm temperate rainforest. These areas are generally traversed on boardwalks and bridges and the wildlife includes several bird species and swamp wallabies. There is also some mountainous terrain. Mount Oberon affords views that are only mildly marred by a radio aerial close by. An alternative walk-up Mount Bishop also has panoramic views of the Prom. The coastline is ruggedly and has indented coves and beaches interspersed amongst granite headlands, tors and cliffs. Beaches vary from broad sandy littoral plains to steep coves and rock pools. The northern part of the park comprises a great deal of the Yanakie Isthmus with sandy healthlands.

===Mount Oberon===
Mount Oberon, located in Wilsons Promontory National Park, is a popular hiking destination. Hikers generally commence walking from Telegraph Saddle carpark, around halfway up the mountain from where Walkers follow a management vehicle track to Mount Oberon&#x27;s summit. A short series of steps below the summit&#x27;s rocky outcrops leads to views over Tidal River, the coast and islands offshore. It can be windy, cool and clouded over at the summit, even during summer . As of mid 2023 options for constructing a walking track linking Tidal River to Telegraph Saddle were being considered creating a hiking opportunity to the summit from sea level.

<text>Piero Sraffa FBA (5 August 1898 – 3 September 1983) was an influential Italian political economist who served as lecturer of economics at the University of Cambridge. His book &quot;Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities&quot; is taken as founding the neo-Ricardian school of economics.

== Early life ==
Sraffa was born in Turin, Kingdom of Italy, to Angelo Sraffa (1865–1937) and Irma Sraffa (née Tivoli) (1873–1949), a wealthy Italian Jewish couple. His father was a professor in commercial law and later dean at the Bocconi University in Milan. Despite being raised as a practising Jew, Sraffa later became an agnostic. 

=== Early career ===

Due to his father&#x27;s activity, the young Piero followed him during his academic wanderings (University of Parma, University of Milan and University of Turin), where he met Antonio Gramsci (leader of Communist Party of Italy). They became close friends, partly due to their shared political views. Sraffa was also in contact with Filippo Turati, perhaps the most important leader of the Italian Socialist Party, whom he allegedly met and frequently visited in Rapallo, where his family had a holiday villa. At the age of 18, in the spring of 1917, he began military service as an officer of the Military Engineer Corps, under the command of the First Army as rear-guard. From the end of World War I (November 1918) until March 1920 he was a member of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into the violations of the right of the people committed by the enemy. The military period corresponded to the &quot;university&quot; one; some anecdotes tell of exams done effortlessly wearing the officer uniform. He graduated in November 1920 with a thesis on inflation in Italy during the period of the Great War. His tutor was Luigi Einaudi, one of the most important Italian economists and later a president of the Italian Republic.

From 1921 to 1922, he studied at the London School of Economics. During this period, at Cambridge, he met twice John Maynard Keynes, who invited him to a collaboration. This request led Sraffa to write two articles about the Italian banking system published in 1922, the first (&quot;The Bank Crisis in Italy&quot;) in &quot;The Economic Journal&quot; (edited by Keynes) and the second (&quot;The current situation of Italian banks&quot;) in the supplement of the newspaper &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; (now &quot;The Guardian&quot;). Keynes also entrusted Sraffa with the Italian edition of his &quot;A Tract on Monetary Reform&quot;. The meeting with Keynes was undoubtedly a fundamental turning point in Sraffa&#x27;s career.

In 1922 Sraffa was appointed director of the provincial labour department in Milan, where he frequented socialist circles. In this period he made friends with Carlo Rosselli and Raffaele Mattioli, both assistants of Luigi Einaudi at the time.

The march on Rome, with the consequent seizure of power by Mussolini, was an event destined to affect deeply his future. His father Angelo was the target of aggression by a fascist squad and received two very threatening telegrams by Mussolini himself who required a public retraction by Piero on the content of the second article published in the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot;. Piero did not write a retraction. In May 1924 his friend Antonio Gramsci, who found himself stuck firstly in Moscow and then in Vienna due to the advent to power of fascism, returned to Rome on his election to Parliament. From now on the relations between the two intellectuals intensified. On 26 November 1926 Italian Parliament approved the law &quot;defence of the state&quot;, thus giving rise to the totalitarian state. On 8 November 1926, Antonio Gramsci was arrested. During Gramsci&#x27;s incarceration, Sraffa supplied books and the material, literally pens and paper, with which Gramsci would write his &quot;Prison Notebooks&quot;.

== Major works ==

=== The laws of productivity under competitive conditions ===

In 1925, Sraffa wrote about returns to scale and perfect competition. In the 1926 article, &quot;The Laws of Returns under Competitive Conditions&quot;, published in &quot;The Economic Journal&quot;, Sraffa resumes and develops his work of 1925 to show the inconsistency of the Marshallian theory of partial equilibrium, according to which, in competition for each good:

# The equilibrium price is determined by the intersection of the demand curve and that of the supply. The supply curve is symmetrical to that of the demand.
# As the quantity produced by the firm increases, there are initially increasing returns and, beyond a certain point, decreasing returns.

Sraffa notes that the law of decreasing returns and that of increasing returns have different origins and areas of application (and therefore cannot explain the shape of the same supply curve): the law of diminishing returns was originally applied to the entire economy and resulted from the scarcity of the agricultural land as a mean of production (the rent theory of David Ricardo); while the law of increasing returns applied to the individual firm and resulted from the benefits of division of labour. The first one allowed for the study of the laws of distribution, and the second those of production.

&quot;Nobody, until comparatively recently - Sraffa writes - had thought of unifying these two tendencies in one single law of non-proportional productivity, and considering this as one of the bases of the theory of price&quot; Sraffa observes that the idea of considering the law of non-proportional returns as a basis for the price theory arose, for analogy, only after the study of decreasing utility had drawn attention to the relationship between the price and the quantity consumed. In fact, &quot;if the cost of production of every unit of the commodity under consideration did not vary with variations in quantity produced the symmetry would be broken, the price would be determined exclusively by the expenses of production and demand would be unable to have any influence on it at all&quot;.

The difficulties of the system that could, in short, be defined as the cross of the supply and demand curves firstly depend on the heterogeneity of the assumptions on which these two different tendencies are based. Decreasing returns and increasing costs are caused by the limited availability of some input which prevents all inputs from varying in optimal proportion. In other words, if an input is limited in quantity, a rise in production levels brings about a less efficient proportion among inputs with a fall in productivity. By contrast, the tendency toward decreasing costs stems from variations in the quantity of all inputs, and therefore they may occur only when there are no constant factors.

A second difficulty stems from the fact that, as Sraffa notes, in the neoclassical theory of prices the equilibrium of the individual firm is determined on the basis of cost variations deriving from small increases in its production (marginalist theory) and taking the situation unchanged in other companies of the same industry and the entire economy, following the hypothesis of &quot;ceteris paribus&quot;, i.e. other conditions being equal.

Sraffa highlights that the possibility of applying the hypothesis of increasing costs to the supply curve is limited to the rare cases in which a considerable part of the supply of input is employed for the production of only one commodity. However, in general, each input is employed by a certain number of industries that produce different goods.

As for increasing returns and decreasing costs, Marshall himself notes that external economies can hardly be attributed clearly to a specific industry, but they are of considerable interest to groups, often of a large size, in related industries; consequently, it is not possible to hypothesize an increase in returns in just one company.

If in the partial equilibrium system of competitive prices, it is not possible to consider decreasing or increasing costs without contradicting the nature of the system, it follows, from this point of view, that production costs of goods produced in competition must be regarded as constant in respect of small variations in the quantity produced&quot; and that the long-run supply curve of an industry is horizontal. As a consequence, the price and the quantity of a good do not derive from the simultaneous action of the supply and demand curves: the price is determined by production costs, while the quantity produced is determined by the demand. The neoclassical symmetry between demand and supply is broken. The old theory that, in competition, &quot;makes the value of commodities dependent on the cost of production alone appears to hold its ground as the best available&quot; (1926b:540-1).

Finally, Sraffa remarks that &quot;everyday experience shows that the majority of which produce manufactured consumers&#x27; goods operate in conditions of individual diminishing costs. If the limit to the firm&#x27;s expansion does not arise from increasing costs, then it may arise from the difficulty in expanding the market share without changing any of these three aspects: improving the quality of the output, reducing its price, or increasing marketing expenses. These considerations were developed, in the 1930s, by the theory of imperfect competition.

=== Cambridge years ===

In 1927, Sraffa&#x27;s yet undiscussed theory of value, but also his friendship with Antonio Gramsci—a risky and compromising endeavour in the context of the Italian fascist regime—brought John Maynard Keynes to invite Sraffa to the University of Cambridge, where the Italian economist was initially assigned a lectureship.

Sraffa arrived in July of 1927 and remained there for life. In the shelter of the English city, he held courses about advanced value theory in his first three years. Then, again with the help of Keynes, he held a librarian position and could devote himself to study, intertwining relationships with a series of intellectuals destined to leave remarkable and lasting tracks.

Together with Frank P. Ramsey and Ludwig Wittgenstein, Sraffa joined the so-called cafeteria group, an informal club that discussed Keynes&#x27;s theory of probability and Friedrich Hayek&#x27;s theory of business cycles (see Sraffa–Hayek debate).

The economists that should at least be remembered are Michał Kalecki (1899–1970), Maurice Dobb (1900–1976), Joan Robinson (1903–1983) and Nicholas Kaldor (1908–1986). Among the philosophers, Frank Plumpton Ramsey (1903–1930) was helpful during the initial elaboration of the equations, datable in 1928, of the book &quot;Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities&quot;, which was published in 1960.

In the early thirties there was a controversy between Sraffa and Friedrich von Hayek, who published a criticism of Keynes&#x27;s conclusions contained in &quot;A Treatise on Money&quot; (1930). After a first reply, Keynes asked Sraffa about writing a more detailed answer to Hayek&#x27;s theses. Sraffa thoroughly analyzed the inconsistencies in the logic of Hayek&#x27;s theory on the effect of forced capital savings caused by inflation and above all on the definition of natural interest rate. The debate continued with a reply by Hayek and a rejoinder by Sraffa.

In 1939, Sraffa was elected to a fellowship at Trinity College. Luigi Pasinetti identifies five stages of his work in Cambridge.

# 1928–1931: research on the history of economic theories, aimed at recovering the &quot;reasonable&quot; economics of the classics. Sraffa intends to &quot;go straight to the unknown, from Marshall to Marx, from disutility to material cost &quot;.
# 1931–1940: edition of David Ricardo&#x27;s works; almost ready for printing, they don&#x27;t get published, both because the &quot;Introduction&quot; (written by Sraffa later) is missing, and because of the discovery of new documents, including all Ricardo&#x27;s letters to James Mill. 
# 1941–1945: criticism of neoclassical economics, in particular of the theory of production and distribution of the theory of value (of prices), of the theory of marginal utility and of the theory of interest as a reward for abstinence; processing of his equations with surplus.
# 1946–1955: publication of the first ten volumes of Ricardo&#x27;s works (the eleventh, containing the General Index, will be published in 1973). John Eatwell wrote of Sraffa&#x27;s work on David Ricardo:[Sraffa&#x27;s] reconstruction of Ricardo&#x27;s surplus theory, presented in but a few pages of the introduction to his edition of Ricardo&#x27;s &quot;Principles&quot;, penetrated a hundred years of misunderstanding and distortion to create a vivid rationale for the structure and content of the surplus theory, for the analytical role of the labour theory of value, and hence for the foundations of Marx&#x27;s critical analysis of capitalist production.
#1955–1960: preparation of Production of Goods by Means of Goods as mere &quot;premise to a critique of political economy&quot;. The original project proved however too vast: of the historical part remains only an appendix of a few pages entitled &quot;Note on the sources&quot;. In the Preface, Sraffa expresses his hope that the real criticism will be attempted &quot;later, or by the author or someone younger and better equipped for the company&quot;.

=== &quot;Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities&quot; ===
The critique of neo-classical price theory based on the relations between cost and quantity produced leads Sraffa to abandon the analysis of partial equilibrium. Since the late 1920s, he began to work on a price theory that takes up the classical concepts of reproducibility, surplus, circularity of production, and freedom of entry. In his book, &quot;Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities,&quot; published only in 1960, Sraffa focuses on the analysis of relative prices and income distribution, assuming &quot;no changes in output and ... no changes in the proportions in which different means of production are used ..., so that no question arises as to the variation or constancy of returns&quot;. As in classics, in Sraffa&#x27;s 1960 book, relative prices are determined by the conditions of production and not on the basis of the functional connection between returns and quantity produced.

Sraffa&#x27;s &quot;Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities&quot; is proposed to perfect classical economics&#x27; theory of value as originally developed by Ricardo and others. He aimed to demonstrate flaws in the mainstream neoclassical theory of value and develop an alternative analysis.

In this important work, Sraffa analyzes a linear production model in which it is possible to determine the relative price structure and one of the two distributive variables (rate of profit or wage), exogenously given the other and the technology. The value of the capital employed can be known only together with the prices of the goods from which it is made. In essence, Sraffa shows that:

# It is not possible to identify a law that simultaneously determines the wage and the rate of profit because: i) the rate of profit can only be determined by setting the wage (or vice versa); ii) it is impossible to measure capital without also determining prices (including the profit), so it is not possible to calculate the profit based on the value of capital (as its remuneration).
# It cannot be assumed that, as wages increase, labour is replaced by capital, as the value of the capital depends on the duration of the initial investment; considering capitals of different duration, it may well happen that we prefer to replace capital with labour even if wages increase (so-called &quot;return of techniques&quot;); consequently, unemployment cannot be attributed to the increase in wages.

Sraffa&#x27;s technique of aggregating capital as &quot;dated inputs of labour&quot; led to a debate known as the Cambridge capital controversy.

Sraffa&#x27;s analytical apparatus was used by some followers for the solution to the Marxian problem of transforming values into prices of production and for the criticism of the Marxian theory of value. Moreover, as highlighted by Pasinetti, Sraffa&#x27;s analysis overcomes the limits of the input-output system of Wassily Leontief, in particular with regard to the effects of technical change. Pasinetti&#x27;s approach, based on Sraffa&#x27;s theory, has recently been developed by Kurz and Salvadori.

Economists disagree on whether Sraffa&#x27;s work refutes neoclassical economics. Many post-Keynesian economists use Sraffa&#x27;s critique as justification for abandoning neoclassical analysis and exploring other models of economic behaviour. Others see his work as compatible with neoclassical economics as developed in modern general equilibrium models, or as unable to determine a long-period position, just like the Walrasian approach. Others still argue that the importance of Sraffa&#x27;s economics is that it provides a new framing for how we understand capitalist economies that do not fall back on the arguably unrealistic assumptions of neoclassical economics.

Nonetheless, Sraffa&#x27;s work, particularly his interpretation of Ricardo and his &quot;Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities&quot; (1960), is seen as the starting point of the neo-Ricardian school in the 1960s.

== Personal connections ==
Sraffa was instrumental in securing Gramsci&#x27;s prison notebooks from the Fascist authorities after the latter&#x27;s death in 1937. In 1924, Gramsci published a letter from Sraffa &quot;Problems of Today and of Tomorrow&quot;, Gramsci published 1924 a letter from Sraffa (without signing, signed S.). In the letter, Sraffa emphasizes the function of bourgeois opposition in the struggle against fascism and the importance of democratic institutions for the social and political development of the proletariat. Seeing the Italian Communist Party as weak, Sraffa recommended collaboration with the bourgeois opposition to fascism. In his answer, Gramsci rejected this suggestion, but he followed Sraffa&#x27;s advice several years later.

Norman Malcolm famously credits Sraffa with providing Ludwig Wittgenstein with the conceptual break that founded the &quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot;, by means of a rude gesture on Sraffa&#x27;s part:

Wittgenstein was insisting that a proposition and what it describes must have the same &#x27;logical form&#x27;, the same &#x27;logical multiplicity&#x27;. Sraffa made a gesture, familiar to Neapolitans as meaning something like disgust or contempt, of brushing the underneath of his chin with an outward sweep of the fingertips of one hand. And he asked: &#x27;What is the logical form of that?&#x27; 

In the introduction to &quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot;, Wittgenstein mentions discussions with Sraffa over many years and says: &quot;I am indebted to &quot;this&quot; stimulus for the most consequential ideas in this book&quot;. However, Sraffa broke off his weekly conversations with Wittgenstein in 1946 despite the latter&#x27;s protests; and when the philosopher said he would talk about anything Sraffa wanted, &quot;&#x27;Yes&#x27;, Sraffa replied, &#x27;but in &quot;your&quot; way&#x27;&quot;.

Sraffa and Wittgenstein influenced each other deeply. While Wittgenstein made his famous turn from the &quot;Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus&quot; to the &quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot; wherein he jettisoned the previous idea that the world comprised an atomistic set of propositional facts for the notion that meaning derives from its use within a holistic self-enclosed system. Analogously, Sraffa was rebutting the neoclassical paradigm which was similarly atomistic and individualistic. While there are disputes about how to interpret Sraffa none dispute Sraffa&#x27;s influence.

After the publication of &quot;Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities&quot;, Sraffa&#x27;s thought became the subject of a great debate. Sraffa was described as a shy and very reserved man who was devoted to study and books. His library contained more than 8,000 volumes, many of which are now in the Trinity College Library. A popular anecdote claims that Sraffa made successful long-term investments in Japanese government bonds that he bought the day after the nuclear bombing on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Another version of this is that Sraffa bought the bonds during the war when they were trading at distressed prices as he was convinced that Japan would honour its obligations (Nicholas Kaldor, pp. 66–67). Records of Sraffa&#x27;s investments in his Trinity College papers show that he had in fact begun his purchasing in 1946, during post-war debates over whether Japan would repay its external pre-war debts in order to return to normality; his modelled returns were large and Lonergan calculates that Sraffa likely realized an estimated annual return of 16% per annum from 1946-1983.

In 1961, before the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel had been created, he was awarded the Söderströmska Gold Medal by the Royal Swedish Academy of Science. In 1972, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by Sorbonne and in 1976 received another one from Madrid&#x27;s Complutense university.

Sraffa was involved in Cambridge capital controversy, sometimes called &quot;the capital controversy&quot;. It was a debate between prominent economists such as Joan Robinson and Piero Sraffa at the University of Cambridge in England and economists such as Paul Samuelson and Robert Solow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States.

In 1966, Paul Samuelson organized a symposium in the QJE, in which it was accepted by all parties, including Samuelson himself, that David Levhari had made a mistake and that Sraffa’s proposition is, of course, robust. The proposition in question refuted the Clarkian-type neoclassical explanation of the rate of interest on capital on the basis of the “marginal productivity of capital,” which requires measurement of the “intensity” of capital independently of the rate of interest. Sraffa’s “re-switching” proposition showed that, in general, there is no logical way by which the “intensity of capital” can be measured independently of the rate of interest — and hence the widely held neoclassical explanation of the distribution of income was logically untenable. This victory was well-known as the pinnacle of Sraffa’s book.

<doc id="51153" wikidata="Q1362" url="?curid=51153" title="Islamabad">
<text>Islamabad (; , ; ) is the capital city of Pakistan. It is the country&#x27;s tenth-most populous city with a population of 1,108,872 people and is federally administered by the Pakistani government as part of the Islamabad Capital Territory. Built as a planned city in the 1960s and established in 1967, it replaced Karachi as Pakistan&#x27;s national capital.

The Greek architect Constantinos Apostolou Doxiadis developed Islamabad&#x27;s master plan, in which he divided it into eight zones; the city comprises administrative, diplomatic enclave, residential areas, educational and industrial sectors, commercial areas, as well as rural and green areas administered by the Islamabad Metropolitan Corporation with support from the Capital Development Authority. Islamabad is known for its parks and forests, including the Margalla Hills National Park and the Shakarparian. It is home to several landmarks, including the country&#x27;s flagship Faisal Mosque, which is the world&#x27;s fifth-largest mosque. Other prominent landmarks include the Pakistan Monument and Democracy Square.

Rated as Gamma + by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network, Islamabad has one of the highest costs of living in Pakistan. The city&#x27;s populace is dominated by both middle and upper-middle class citizens. Islamabad is home to twenty universities, including Bahria University, Quaid-e-Azam University, PIEAS, COMSATS University, and NUST. It is also rated as one of the safest cities in Pakistan and has an expansive RFID-enabled surveillance system with almost 2,000 active CCTV cameras.

== Toponymy ==
The name &quot;Islamabad&quot; means &quot;City of Islam&quot;. It is derived from two words: &quot;Islam&quot; and &quot;abad&quot;. &quot;Islam&quot; refers to the religion of Islam, Pakistan&#x27;s state religion, and &quot;-abad&quot; is a Persian suffix meaning &quot;cultivated place&quot;, indicating an inhabited place or city. According to a history book by Muhammad Ismail Zabeeh, teacher and poet Qazi Abdur Rehman Amritsari proposed the name of the city.

Occasionally in writing, Islamabad is colloquially abbreviated &quot;ISB&quot;. Such usage originated in SMS language, in part due to the IATA location identifier for the Islamabad International Airport.

==History==
===Early history===
Islamabad Capital Territory, located on the Pothohar Plateau of the northern Punjab region, is considered one of the earliest sites of human settlement in Asia. Some of the earliest Stone Age artefacts in the world have been found on the plateau, dating from 100,000 to 500,000 years ago. Rudimentary stones recovered from the terraces of the Soan River testify to the endeavours of early man in the inter-glacial period. Items of pottery and utensils dating back to prehistory have been found.

Excavations by Dr. Abdul Ghafoor Lone reveal evidence of a prehistoric culture in the area. Relics and human skulls have been found dating back to 5000 BCE that indicate the region was home to Neolithic peoples who settled on the banks of the Soan and who later developed small communities in the region around 3000 BCE.

The Indus Valley civilization flourished in the region between the 23rd and 18th centuries BCE. Later the area was an early settlement of the Aryan community which migrated into the region from Central Asia. Many great armies such as those of Zahiruddin Babur, Genghis Khan, Timur and Ahmad Shah Durrani crossed the region during their invasions of the Indian subcontinent. In 2015–16, the Federal Department of Archaeology and Museums, with the financial support of National Fund for Cultural Heritage, carried out initial archaeological excavations in which unearthed the remains of a Buddhist stupa at Ban Faqiran, near the Shah Allah Ditta caves, which was dated to the 2nd to the 5th century CE.

===Construction and development===

When Pakistan gained independence in 1947, the southern port city of Karachi was its provisional national capital. In 1958, a commission was constituted to select a suitable site near Rawalpindi for the national capital with particular emphasis on location, climate, logistics, and defence requirements, along with other attributes. After extensive study, research, and a thorough review of potential sites, the commission recommended the area northeast of Rawalpindi in 1959 which was used as provisional capital from that year on. In the 1960s, Islamabad was constructed as a forward capital for several reasons. Karachi was also located at the southern end of the country, and exposed to attacks from the Arabian Sea. Pakistan needed a capital that was easily accessible from all parts of the country. Karachi, a business centre, was also considered unsuitable partly because of intervention of business interests in government affairs. The newly selected location of Islamabad was closer to the army headquarters in Rawalpindi and the disputed territory of Kashmir in the north.

A Greek firm of architects, led by Konstantinos Apostolos Doxiadis, designed the master plan of the city based on a grid plan which was triangular in shape with its apex towards the Margalla Hills. The capital was not moved directly from Karachi to Islamabad; it was first shifted temporarily to Rawalpindi in the early 1960s and then to Islamabad when essential development work was completed in 1966. In 1981, Islamabad separated from Punjab province to form Capital Territory. Such world-renowned architects as Edward Durell Stone and Gio Ponti have been associated with the city&#x27;s development.

===Recent history===

Islamabad has attracted people from all over Pakistan, making it one of the most cosmopolitan and urbanised cities of Pakistan. As the capital city it has hosted numerous important meetings, such as the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation summit in 2004.

Islamabad has experienced a series of terrorist incidents including the July 2007 Siege of Lal Masjid (Red Mosque), the June 2008 Danish embassy bombing, and the September 2008 Marriott bombing. In 2011, four terrorism incidents occurred in the city, killing four people, including the murder of the Punjab Governor Salmaan Taseer.

Construction of the Rawalpindi-Islamabad Metrobus, the region&#x27;s first mass transit line, began in February 2014 and was completed in March 2015. The Rawalpindi Development Authority built the project at a cost of approximately Rs 24 billion, which was shared by both the Federal government and the provincial government of Punjab.

Islamabad city is divided into five major zones: Zone I, Zone II, Zone III, Zone IV, and Zone V. Out of these, Zone IV is the largest in area. Zone I consists mainly of all the developed residential sectors while Zone II consists of the under-developed residential sectors. Each residential sector is identified by a letter of the alphabet and a number, and covers an area of approximately 2 km × 2 km ( mi ×  mi). The sectors are lettered from A to I, and each sector is divided into four numbered sub-sectors.

===Sectors===


Series A, B, and C are still underdeveloped. The D series has seven sectors (D-11 to D-17), of which only sector D-12 is completely developed. This series is located at the foot of Margalla Hills. The E Sectors are named from E-7 to E-17. Many foreigners and diplomatic personnel are housed in these sectors.

Sectors E-8 and E-9 contain the campuses of Bahria University, Air University, and the National Defence University. The F and G series contains the most developed sectors. F series contains sectors F-5 to F-17; some sectors are still under-developed. F-5 is an important sector for the software industry in Islamabad, as the two software technology parks are located here. The entire F-9 sector is covered with Fatima Jinnah Park. The Centaurus complex is a major landmark of the F-8 sector. G sectors are numbered G-5 through G-17. Some important places include the Jinnah Convention Centre and Serena Hotel in G-5, the Red Mosque in G-6, the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, the largest medical complex in the capital, located in G-8, and the Karachi Company shopping center in G-9.

The Soan River flows into the city through Zone V.

=== Islamabad–Rawalpindi metropolitan area ===

When the master plan for Islamabad was drawn up in 1960, Islamabad and Rawalpindi, along with the adjoining areas, was to be integrated to form a large metropolitan area called Islamabad/Rawalpindi Metropolitan Area. The area would consist of the developing Islamabad, the old colonial cantonment city of Rawalpindi, and Margalla Hills National Park, including surrounding rural areas. However, Islamabad city is part of the Islamabad Capital Territory, while Rawalpindi is part of Rawalpindi District, which is part of province of Punjab.

Initially, it was proposed that the three areas would be connected by four major highways: Murree Highway, Islamabad Highway, Soan Highway, and Capital Highway. However, to date only two highways have been constructed: Kashmir Highway (the former Murree Highway) and Islamabad Highway. Plans of constructing Margalla Avenue are also underway. Islamabad is the hub all the governmental activities while Rawalpindi is the centre of all industrial, commercial, and military activities. The two cities are considered sister cities and are highly interdependent.

<text>Leicester ( ) is a city, unitary authority area, and the county town of Leicestershire in the East Midlands of England. It is the largest city in the East Midlands with a population of in . The greater Leicester urban area had a population of 559,017 in 2021, making it the 11th most populous in England, and the 13th most populous in the United Kingdom. A 2023 report ranked Leicester 16th out of the 50 largest UK cities on a range of economic measures, and the first of seven East Midlands cities.

The city lies on the River Soar and is approximately north-northwest of London, east-northeast of Birmingham and northeast of Coventry. Nottingham and Derby lie around to the north and northwest respectively, whilst Peterborough is located to the east. Leicester is close to the eastern end of the National Forest.

Leicester has a long history extending into ancient times. The site of an Iron Age oppidum, it developed into the Roman town of Ratae Corieltauvorum following the conquest. The ruins of Ratae were later settled by the Anglo-Saxons, and then captured by the Vikings who made it one of the Five Boroughs of the Danelaw. Leicester became an important town during the Middle Ages, and then an important industrial and commercial centre in the Victorian age, eventually gaining city status in 1919. Since the mid-20th century, immigration from countries of the British Commonwealth has seen Leicester become an ethnically diverse city, and one of the largest urban centres of the Midlands.

Leicester is at the intersection of two railway lines: the Midland Main Line and the Birmingham to London Stansted Airport line. It is also at the confluence of the M1/M69 motorways and the A6/A46 trunk routes. Leicester Cathedral is home to the tomb of King Richard III who was reburied in the cathedral in 2015 after being discovered nearby in the foundations of the lost Greyfriars chapel, more than 500 years after his death. In sporting terms, Leicester is the home to football club Leicester City and rugby club Leicester Tigers.

==Name==
The name of Leicester comes from Old English. It is first recorded in Latinised form in the early ninth century as &quot;Legorensis civitatis&quot; and in Old English itself in an &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; entry for 924 as &#x27; (and, in various spellings, frequently thereafter). In the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086, it is recorded as &#x27;.

The first element of the name is the name of a people, the &quot;Ligore&quot; (whose name appears in &quot;Ligera ceastre&quot; in the genitive plural form); their name came in turn from the river Ligor (now the River Soar), the origin of whose name is uncertain but thought to be from Brittonic (possibly cognate with the name of the Loire).

The second element of the name is the Old English word &quot;ceaster&quot; (&quot;(Roman) fort, fortification, town&quot;, itself borrowed from Latin &quot;castrum&quot;).

A list of British cities in the ninth-century &quot;History of the Britons&quot; includes one &#x27;; Leicester has been proposed as the place to which this refers (and the Welsh name for Leicester is &#x27;). But this identification is not certain.

Based on the Welsh name (given as &quot;Kaerleir&quot;), Geoffrey of Monmouth proposed a king Leir of Britain as an eponymous founder in his &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; (12th century).

==History==

===Prehistory===
Leicester is one of the oldest cities in England, with a history going back at least two millennia. The native Iron Age settlement encountered by the Romans at the site seems to have developed in the 2nd or 1st centuries BC. Little is known about this settlement or the condition of the River Soar at this time, although roundhouses from this era have been excavated and seem to have clustered along roughly of the east bank of the Soar. This area of the Soar was split into two channels: a main stream to the east and a narrower channel on the west, with a presumably marshy island between. The settlement seems to have controlled a ford across the larger channel. The later Roman name was a latinate form of the Brittonic word for &quot;ramparts&quot; (cf. Gaelic &quot;rath&quot; and the nearby villages of Ratby and Ratcliffe), suggesting the site was an oppidum. The plural form of the name suggests it was initially composed of several villages. The Celtic tribe holding the area was later recorded as the &quot;Coritanians&quot; but an inscription recovered in 1983 showed this to have been a corruption of the original &quot;Corieltauvians&quot;. The Corieltauvians are believed to have ruled over roughly the area of the East Midlands.

===Roman===
It is believed that the Romans arrived in the Leicester area around AD 47, during their conquest of southern Britain. The Corieltauvian settlement lay near a bridge on the Fosse Way, a Roman road between the legionary camps at Isca (Exeter) and Lindum (Lincoln). It remains unclear whether the Romans fortified and garrisoned the location, but it slowly developed from around the year 50 onwards as the tribal capital of the Corieltauvians under the name Ratae Corieltauvorum. In the 2nd century, it received a forum and bathhouse. In 2013, the discovery of a Roman cemetery found just outside the old city walls and dating back to AD 300 was announced. The remains of the baths of Roman Leicester can be seen at the Jewry Wall; recovered artifacts are displayed at the adjacent museum.

===Medieval===

Knowledge of the town following the Roman withdrawal from Britain is limited. It seems to have been continually occupied after Roman protection ceased through the 5th and 6th centuries, although with a significantly reduced population. Its memory was preserved as the &quot;&quot; of the &quot;History of the Britons&quot;. Following the Saxon invasion of Britain, Leicester was occupied by the Middle Angles and subsequently administered by the kingdom of Mercia. It was elevated to a bishopric in either 679 or 680; this see survived until the 9th century, when Leicester was captured by Danish Vikings. Their settlement became one of the Five Burghs of the Danelaw, although this position was short-lived. The Saxon bishop, meanwhile, fled to Dorchester-on-Thames and Leicester did not become a bishopric again until the Church of became Leicester Cathedral in 1927. The settlement was recorded under the name &quot;Ligeraceaster&quot; in the early 10th century.
Following the Norman conquest, Leicester was recorded by William&#x27;s Domesday Book as &quot;Ledecestre&quot;. It was noted as a city (&quot;civitas&quot;) but lost this status in the 11th century owing to power struggles between the Church and the aristocracy and did not become a legal city again until 1919.

Geoffrey of Monmouth composed his &quot;History of the Kings of Britain&quot; around the year 1136, naming a King Leir as an eponymous founder figure. According to Geoffrey&#x27;s narrative, Cordelia had buried her father beneath the river in a chamber dedicated to Janus and his feast day was an annual celebration.

When Simon de Montfort became Earl of Leicester in 1231, he gave the borough a grant to expel the Jewish population &quot;in my time or in the time of any of my heirs to the end of the world&quot;. He justified his action as being &quot;for the good of my soul, and for the souls of my ancestors and successors&quot;. Leicester&#x27;s Jews were allowed to move to the eastern suburbs, which were controlled by de Montfort&#x27;s great-aunt and rival, Margaret, Countess of Winchester, after she took advice from the scholar and cleric Robert Grosseteste, at that time Archdeacon of Leicester. There is evidence that Jews remained there until 1253, and perhaps enforcement of the banishment within the city was not rigorously enforced. De Montfort however issued a second edict for the expulsion of Leicester&#x27;s Jews in 1253, after Grosseteste&#x27;s death. De Montfort&#x27;s many acts of anti-Jewish persecution in Leicester and elsewhere were part of a wider pattern that led to the expulsion of the Jewish population from England in 1290.

During the 14th century, the earls of Leicester and Lancaster enhanced the prestige of the town. Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster and of Leicester founded a hospital for the poor and infirm in the area to the south of the castle now known as The Newarke (the &quot;new work&quot;). Henry&#x27;s son, the great Henry of Grosmont, 4th Earl of Lancaster and of Leicester, who was made first Duke of Lancaster, enlarged and enhanced his father&#x27;s foundation, and built the collegiate Church of the Annunciation of Our Lady of The Newarke. This church (a little of which survives in the basement of the Hawthorn Building of De Montfort University) was destroyed during the reign of King Edward VI. It became an important pilgrimage site because it housed a thorn said to be from the Crown of Thorns, given to the Duke by the King of France. The church (described by Leland in the C16th as &quot;not large but exceeding fair&quot;) also became, effectively, a Lancastrian mausoleum. Duke Henry&#x27;s daughter Blanche of Lancaster married John of Gaunt and their son Henry Bolingbroke became King Henry IV when he deposed King Richard II. The Church of the Annunciation was the burial place of Duke Henry, who had earlier had his father re-interred here. Later it became the burial place of Constance of Castile, Duchess of Lancaster (second wife of John of Gaunt) and of Mary de Bohun, first wife of Henry Bolingbroke (Henry IV) and mother of King Henry V (she did not become queen because she died before Bolingbroke became king). John of Gaunt died at Leicester Castle in 1399. When his son became king, the Earldom of Leicester and the Duchy of Lancaster became royal titles (and the latter remains so).
At the end of the War of the Roses, King Richard III was buried in Leicester&#x27;s Greyfriars Church a Franciscan Friary and Church which was demolished after its dissolution in 1538. The site of that church is now covered by King Richard III Visitor Centre (until 2012 by more modern buildings and a car park). There was a legend his corpse had been cast into the river, while some historians argued his tomb and remains were destroyed during the dissolution of the monasteries under Henry VIII. However, in September 2012, an archaeological investigation of the car park revealed a skeleton which DNA testing helped verify to be related to two descendants of Richard III&#x27;s sister. It was concluded that the skeleton was that of Richard III because of the DNA evidence and the shape of the spine. In 2015 Richard III was reburied in pride of place near the high altar in Leicester Cathedral.

===Modern===
====Tudor====

On 4 November 1530, Cardinal Thomas Wolsey was arrested on charges of treason and taken from Yorkshire. On his way south to face dubious justice at the Tower of London, he fell ill. The group escorting him was concerned enough to stop at Leicester to rest at Leicester Abbey. There, Wolsey&#x27;s condition quickly worsened. He died on 29 November 1530 and was buried at Leicester Abbey, now Abbey Park.

Lady Jane Grey, who claimed the English throne for nine days in June 1553, was born at Bradgate Park near Leicester around 1536.

Queen Elizabeth I&#x27;s intimate and former suitor, Robert Dudley, was given the Earldom of Leicester.

====Stuart====
After the Union of the Crowns, Anne of Denmark, Prince Henry, and Princess Elizabeth travelled to Leicester on 24 June 1603, after the courtier and usher Thomas Conway was assured that the town was free from infection or plague. Prince Charles, later King Charles I, travelled to London with his guardian Alexander Seton. The royal party stayed at Leicester for three days in August 1604 at the townhouse of William Skipwith.

The Corporation of Leicester opposed the efforts of Charles I to disafforest the nearby Leicester Forest, believing them to be likely to throw many of its residents into poverty and need of relief. Sir Miles Fleetwood was sent to commission the disafforestation and division of lands being used in common. Riots destroyed enclosures in spring 1627 and 1628, following a pattern of anti-enclosure disturbances found elsewhere including the Western Rising.

Petitions challenging the enclosures were presented by the Corporation of Leicester and borough residents to the King and Privy Council. They were unsuccessful so petitioned the House of Lords in June 1628 who however supported Fleetwood but asked for proceedings made by the Crown against the rioters to be dropped. Compensation made to the legal residents of the forest was reasonably generous by comparison with other forests. The Corporation of Leicester received for relief of the poor.

====Civil War====
Leicester was a Parliamentarian (colloquially called Roundhead) stronghold during the English Civil War. In 1645, King Charles I of England and Prince Rupert decided to attack the (then) town to draw the New Model Army away from the Royalist (colloquially called Cavaliers) headquarters of Oxford. Royalist guns were set up on Raw Dykes and, after an unsatisfactory response to a demand for surrender, the assault began at 3pm on 30 May 1645 by a Royalist battery opposite the Newarke. The town – which only had approximately 2,000 defenders opposed to the Royalist Army of approximately 10,000 combatants – was sacked on 31 May 1645, and hundreds of people were killed by Rupert&#x27;s cavalry. One witness said, &quot;they fired upon our men out of their windows, from the tops of houses, and threw tiles upon their heads. Finding one house better manned than ordinary, and many shots fired at us out of the windows, I caused my men to attack it, and resolved to make them an example for the rest; which they did. Breaking open the doors, they killed all they found there without distinction&quot;. It was reported that 120 houses had been destroyed and that 140 wagons of plunder were sent to the Royalist stronghold of Newark.

Following the Parliamentarian victory over the Royalist Army at the Battle of Naseby on 14 June 1645, Leicester was recovered by Parliament on 18 June 1645.

====Industrial era====

The construction of the Grand Union Canal in the 1790s linked Leicester to London and Birmingham. The first railway station in Leicester opened in 1832, in the form of the Leicester and Swannington Railway which provided a supply of coal to the town from nearby collieries. The Midland Counties Railway (running from Derby to Rugby) linked the town to the national network by 1840. A direct link to London St Pancras was established by the Midland Railway in the 1860s. These developments encouraged and accompanied a process of industrialisation which intensified throughout the reign of Queen Victoria. Factories began to appear, particularly along the canal and river, and districts such as Frog Island and Woodgate were the locations of numerous large mills. Between 1861 and 1901, Leicester&#x27;s population increased from to and the proportion employed in trade, commerce, building, and the city&#x27;s new factories and workshops rose steadily. Hosiery, textiles, and footwear became the major industrial employers: manufacturers such as N. Corah &amp; Sons and the Cooperative Boot and Shoe Company were opening some of the largest manufacturing premises in Europe. They were joined, in the latter part of the century, by engineering firms such as Kent Street&#x27;s Taylor and Hubbard (crane makers and founders), Vulcan Road&#x27;s William Gimson &amp; Company (steam boilers and founders), and Martin Street&#x27;s Richards &amp; Company (steel works and founders).

The politics of Victorian Leicester were lively and very often bitter. Years of consistent economic growth meant living standards generally increased, but Leicester was a stronghold of Radicalism. Thomas Cooper, the Chartist, kept a shop in Church Gate. There were serious Chartist riots in the town in 1842 and again six years later. The Leicester Secular Society was founded in 1851 but secularist speakers such as George Holyoake were often denied the use of speaking halls. It was not until 1881 that Leicester Secular Hall was opened. The second half of the 19th century also witnessed the creation of many other institutions, including the town council, the Royal Infirmary, and the Leicester Constabulary. It also benefited from general acceptance (and the Public Health Acts ) that municipal organisations had a responsibility to provide for the town&#x27;s water supply, drainage, and sanitation. In 1853, backed with a guarantee of dividends by the Corporation of Leicester the Leicester Waterworks Company built a reservoir at Thornton for the supply of water to the town. This guarantee was made possible by the Public Health Act 1847 and an amending local Act of Parliament of 1851. In 1866 another amending Act enabled the Corporation of Leicester to take shares in the company to enable the construction of another reservoir at Cropston, completed in 1870. The Corporation of Leicester was later able to buy the waterworks and build another reservoir at Swithland, completed in the 1890s.

Leicester became a county borough in 1889, although it was abolished in 1974 as part of the Local Government Act, and was reformed as a non-metropolitan district and city. The city regained its unitary status, being administered separately from Leicestershire, in 1997. The borough had been expanding throughout the 19th century, but grew most notably when it annexed Belgrave, Aylestone, North Evington, Knighton, and Stoneygate in 1892.

====Early 20th century====

In 1900, the Great Central Railway provided another link to London, but the rapid population growth of the previous decades had already begun to slow by the time of Queen Victoria&#x27;s death in 1901.
World War I and the subsequent epidemics had further impacts. Nonetheless, Leicester was finally recognised as a legal city once more in 1919 in recognition of its contribution to the British war effort. Recruitment to the armed forces was lower in Leicester than in other English cities, partly because of the low level of unemployment and the need for many of its industries, such as clothing and footwear manufacturing, to supply the army. As the war progressed, many of Leicester&#x27;s factories were given over to arms production; Leicester produced the first batch of Howitzer shells by a British company which was not making ammunition before the war. After the war, the city received a royal visit; the king and queen received a march-past in Victoria Park of thousands of serving and demobilised soldiers. Following the end of the war, a memorial arch—the Arch of Remembrance—was built in Victoria Park and unveiled in 1925. The arch, one of the largest First World War memorials in the UK, was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, who also designed the Cenotaph in London and is a grade I listed building. A set of gates and lodges, again by Lutyens, were added in the 1930s, leading to the memorial from the University Road and London Road entrances to Victoria Park.

In 1927, Leicester again became a cathedral city on the consecration of Church as the cathedral. A second major extension to the boundaries following the changes in 1892 took place in 1935, with the annexation of the remainder of Evington, Humberstone, Beaumont Leys, and part of Braunstone. A third major revision of the boundaries took place in 1966, with the net addition to the city of just over . The boundary has remained unchanged since that time.

Leicester&#x27;s diversified economic base and lack of dependence on primary industries meant it was much better placed than many other cities to weather the tariff wars of the 1920s and Great Depression of the 1930s. The Bureau of Statistics of the newly formed League of Nations identified Leicester in 1936 as the second-richest city in Europe and it became an attractive destination for refugees fleeing persecution and political turmoil in continental Europe. Firms such as Corah and Liberty Shoes used their reputation for producing high-quality products to expand their businesses. These years witnessed the growth in the city of trade unionism and particularly the co-operative movement. The Co-op became an important employer and landowner; when Leicester played host to the Jarrow March on its way to London in 1936, the Co-op provided the marchers with a change of boots. In 1938, Leicester was selected as the base for Squadron 1F, the first A.D.C.C (Air Defence Cadet Corp), the predecessor of the Air Training Corps.

====World War II====
Leicester was bombed on 19 November 1940. Although only three bombs hit the city, 108 people were killed in Highfields.

===Contemporary===
The years after World War II, particularly from the 1960s onwards, brought many social and economic challenges.

====Urban expansion; central rapprochement====

Mass housebuilding continued across Leicester for some 30 years after 1945. Existing housing estates such as Braunstone were expanded, while several completely new estates – of both private and council tenure – were built. The last major development of this era was Beaumont Leys in the north of the city, which was developed in the 1970s as a mix of private and council housing.

There was a steady decline in Leicester&#x27;s traditional manufacturing industries and, in the city centre, working factories and light industrial premises have now been almost entirely replaced. Many former factories, including some on Frog Island and at Donisthorpe Mill, have been badly damaged by fire. Rail and barge were finally eclipsed by automotive transport in the 1960s and 1970s: the Great Central and the Leicester and Swannington both closed and the northward extension of the M1 motorway linked Leicester into England&#x27;s growing motorway network. With the loss of much of the city&#x27;s industry during the 1970s and 1980s, some of the old industrial jobs were replaced by new jobs in the service sector, particularly in retail. The opening of the Haymarket Shopping Centre in 1971 was followed by a number of new shopping centres in the city, including St Martin&#x27;s Shopping Centre in 1984 and the Shire Shopping Centre in 1992. The Shires was subsequently expanded in September 2008 and rebranded as Highcross. By the 1990s, as well, Leicester&#x27;s central position and good transport links had established it as a distribution centre; the southwestern area of the city has also attracted new service and manufacturing businesses.

====Immigration====

Since World War II Leicester has experienced large scale immigration from across the world. Many Polish servicemen were prevented from returning to their homeland after the war by the communist regime, and they established a small community in Leicester. Economic migrants from the Irish Republic continued to arrive throughout the post war period. Immigrants from the Indian sub-continent began to arrive in the 1960s, their numbers boosted by Asians arriving from Kenya and Uganda in the early 1970s.

In 1972, Idi Amin announced that the entire Asian community in Uganda had 90 days to leave the country. Shortly thereafter, Leicester City Council launched a campaign aimed at dissuading Ugandan Asians from migrating to the city. The adverts did not have their intended effect, instead making more migrants aware of the possibility of settling in Leicester. Nearly a quarter of initial Ugandan refugees (around 5000 to 6000) settled in Leicester, and by the end of the 1970s around another quarter of the initially dispersed refugees had made their way to Leicester. Officially, the adverts were taken out for fear that immigrants to Leicester would place pressure on city services and at least one person who was a city councillor at the time says he believes they were placed for racist reasons. The initial advertisement was widely condemned, and taken as a marker of anti-Asian sentiment throughout Britain as a whole, although the attitudes that resulted in the initial advertisement were changed significantly in subsequent decades, not least because the immigrants included the owners of many of &quot;Uganda&#x27;s most successful businesses.&quot;

Forty years later, Leicester&#x27;s mayor Sir Peter Soulsby expressed his regret for the behaviour of the council at the time.

In the 1990s, a group of Dutch citizens of Somali origin settled in the city. Since the 2004 enlargement of the European Union a significant number of East European migrants have settled in the city. While some wards in the northeast of the city are more than 70% South Asian, wards in the west and south are all over 70% white. The Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) had estimated that by 2011 Leicester would have approximately a 50% ethnic minority population, making it the first city in Britain not to have a white British majority. This prediction was based on the growth of the ethnic minority populations between 1991 (Census 1991 28% ethnic minority) and 2001 (Census 2001 – 36% ethnic minority). However, Professor Ludi Simpson at the University of Manchester School of Social Sciences said in September 2007 that the CRE had &quot;made unsubstantiated claims and ignored government statistics&quot; and that Leicester&#x27;s immigrant and minority communities disperse to other places.

The Leicester Multicultural Advisory Group is a forum, set up in 2001 by the editor of the &quot;Leicester Mercury&quot;, to co-ordinate community relations with members representing the council, police, schools, community and faith groups, and the media.

====Coronavirus====
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought many social and economic challenges across the country and across the world. Leicester has been particularly badly affected in the United Kingdom; from July 2020 during the imposition of the first local lockdown which saw all non-essential retail closed again and businesses such as public houses, restaurants and hairdressers unable to reopen. Businesses such as these in areas such as Glenfield and that part of Braunstone Town which outside of the formal city council area, have since been allowed to reopen following a more tightly defined lockdown area from 18 July 2020.

==Geography==
The Office for National Statistics has defined a Leicester Urban Area (LUA); broadly the immediate Leicester conurbation, although without administrative status. The LUA contains the unitary authority area and several towns, villages and suburbs outside the city&#x27;s administrative boundaries.

=== Areas and suburbs ===

Suburbs and districts of Leicester (ancient villages now incorporated into the city are shown in bold)
===Climate===

Leicester experiences a maritime climate with mild to warm summers and cool winters, rain spread throughout the year, and low sunshine levels. The nearest official Weather Station was Newtown Linford, about northwest of Leicester city centre and just outside the edge of the urban area. However, observations stopped there in 2003. The current nearest weather station is Market Bosworth, about west of the city centre. 

The highest temperature recorded at Newtown Linford was during August 1990, although a temperature of was achieved at Leicester University during August 2003. However, the highest temperature since records began in Leicester is on 15 July 1868. More typically the highest temperature would reach – the average annual maximum. 11.3 days of the year should attain a temperature of or above.

The lowest temperature recorded at Newtown Linford was during January 1963. Typically, 54.9 air frosts will be recorded during the course of the year.

Rainfall averages 684.4 mm per year, with 1 mm or more falling on 120.8 days. All averages refer to the period 1971–2000.

==Governance==

On 5 May 2011, the directly elected Mayor of Leicester role came into effect after the inaugural election. This post exists in addition to that of Lord Mayor which goes back to the Middle Ages and is these days a ceremonial role.

The first mayor of Leicester was a Norman knight, Peter fitz Roger (&quot;Peter, son of Roger&quot;) in 1251. Following the restoration of city status in 1919 this title was elevated to &quot;Lord Mayor.&quot; In 1987 the first Asian Mayor of Leicester was indirectly elected by the councillors, Councillor Gordhan Parmar. After institution of a directly elected mayor in 2011 the Lord Mayor of Leicester still exists as a ceremonial role under Leicester City Council.

On 1 April 1997, Leicester City Council became a unitary authority. Previously, local government had been a two-tier system: the city and county councils were responsible for different aspects of local-government services. That system is still in place in the rest of Leicestershire. Leicestershire County Council retained its headquarters at County Hall in Glenfield, just outside the city boundary but within the urban area. The administrative offices of Leicester City Council are in the centre of the city at City Hall in Charles Street, having moved from Welford Place. The 1970s council offices at Welford Place were declared unsafe in 2010 and demolished on 22 February 2015. In 2018 a newly built New Walk Centre was completed as a privately funded mix of offices, shops and flats, alongside tree-lined open spaces. Some services (particularly the police and the ambulance service) still cover the whole of the city and county, but for the most part the councils are independent.

Leicester is divided into 21 electoral wards: Abbey, Aylestone, Beaumont Leys, Belgrave, Braunstone Park &amp; Rowley Fields, Castle, Evington, Eyres Monsell, Fosse, Humberstone &amp; Hamilton, Knighton, North Evington, Rushey Mead, Saffron, Spinney Hills, Stoneygate, Thurncourt, Troon, Westcotes, Western, and Wycliffe.

===Political control===
The current directly elected mayor is Sir Peter Soulsby of the Labour Party.

After a long period of Labour administration (since 1979), the city council from May 2003 was run by a Liberal Democrat/Conservative coalition under Roger Blackmore, which collapsed in November 2004. The minority Labour group ran the city until May 2005, under Ross Willmott, when the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives formed a new coalition, again under the leadership of Roger Blackmore.

In the local government elections of 3 May 2007, Leicester&#x27;s Labour Party once again took control of the council in what can be described as a landslide victory. Gaining 18 new councillors, Labour polled on the day 38 councillors, creating a governing majority of +20. Significantly however, the Green Party gained its first councillors in the Castle Ward, after losing on the drawing of lots in 2003, though one of these subsequently resigned and the seat was lost to Labour in a by-election on 10 September 2009. The Conservative Party saw a decrease in their representation. The Liberal Democrat Party was the major loser, dropping from 25 councillors in 2003 to only 6 in 2007. This was in part due to the local party splitting, with a number of councillors standing for the Liberal Party.

In the local government elections of 5 May 2011 and those of May 2015, Labour won 52 of the city&#x27;s 54 seats, with the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats winning one seat each. In the 2019 local elections, the Labour Party gained the sole Conservative held ward of Knighton leaving Nigel Porter of the Liberal Democrats as the only opposition member on the city council.

The current composition of Leicester City Council is as follows:
There have been four changes in party affiliation since the last full council election in May 2023. Councillor Diane Cank left the Labour group in August 2023. Councillor Sanjay Modhwadia, the Conservative Party candidate in the 2024 Leicester mayoral election, was suspended from the Conservative Party following an argument with group leader Deepak Bajaj in a public car park over who should be the next group leader. Conservative group leader Deepak Bajaj subsequently defected to the Labour Party on 8 April, lambasting a culture of violence, racism, religious divides, threats and bullying within the Conservative Party in Leicester. The conservative group was further reduced in June 2024 when councillor Nagarjun &quot;Nags&quot; Agath quit the party to stand as an independent candidate in Leicester East in the 2024 United Kingdom general election. Agath cited displeasure in the choice of the Conservative candidate, Shivani Raja, as his reason to stand, branding her as an &quot;inexperienced candidate&quot; that had been &quot;dumped&quot; on the city.

===Representation at Westminster===
In the 2024 general election, Leicester is divided into three Parliamentary constituencies: Leicester East, represented by Conservative Party MP Shivani Raja, Leicester South, represented by independent MP Shockat Adam, and Leicester West represented by Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall of the Labour Party.

===Coat of arms===
The Corporation of Leicester&#x27;s coat of arms was first granted to the city at the Heraldic Visitation of 1619, and is based on the arms of the first Earl of Leicester, Robert Beaumont. The charge is a cinquefoil ermine, on a red field, and this emblem is used by the city council.

After Leicester became a city again in 1919, the city council applied to add to the arms. Permission for this was granted in 1929, when the supporting lions, from the Lancastrian Earls of Leicester, were added.

The motto &quot;Semper Eadem&quot; was the motto of Queen Elizabeth I, who granted a royal charter to the city. It means &quot;always the same&quot; but with positive overtones meaning unchanging, reliable or dependable, and united. The crest on top of the arms is a white or silver legless wyvern with red and white wounds showing, on a wreath of red and white. The legless wyvern distinguishes it as a Leicester wyvern as opposed to other wyverns. The supporting lions are wearing coronets in the form of collars, with the white cinquefoil hanging from them.

==Demography==


===Comparing===
In the 2011 census, the population of the Leicester unitary authority area was 329,839, an increase of 11.8% compared to the United Kingdom Census 2001 figure of 279,921. The wider Leicester Urban Area, showed an estimated population of 509,000. The population of the Leicester unitary authority area is marginally higher than that of Nottingham, while Nottingham has a higher urban area population compared to Leicester. Eurostat&#x27;s Larger Urban Zone lists the population of the Leicester LUZ at 886,673 (2017) below that of Nottingham; metropolitan and city region populations tend to be similar. According to the 2011 census Leicester had the largest proportion of people aged 19-and-under in the East Midlands at 27 per cent. Coventry, to the south west, has a population of 352,900 (2016 est.) compared to Leicester&#x27;s 348,300 at the same date. Nonetheless, Coventry has an area one third greater than Leicester&#x27;s, approximately equivalent to a combined &#x27;Leicester + Oadby and Wigston&#x27; with a respective population of 404,100 (2016 est.).

The Eurostat regional yearbook 2015 classifies Leicester as one of country&#x27;s eleven &#x27;Greater Cities&#x27;, together with Birmingham and Nottingham in the Midlands. Leicester is second only to Bristol as the largest unitary authority city in England (List of English districts by population 2015 estimates), and ninth largest counting both unitary authority cities and cities within metropolitan counties.

In terms of ethnic composition, according to the 2011 census, 50.6% of the population was White (45.1% White British, 0.8% White Irish, 0.1% Gypsy or Irish Traveller, 4.6% Other White), 37.1% Asian (28.3% Indian, 2.4% Pakistani, 1.1% Bangladeshi, 1.3% Chinese, 4.0% Other Asian), 3.5% of mixed race (1.4% White and Black Caribbean, 0.4% White and Black African, 1.0% White and Asian, 0.7% Other Mixed), 6.3% Black (3.8% African, 1.5% Caribbean, 1.0% Other Black), 1.0% Arab and 1.6% of other ethnic heritage.

, Leicester is the second fastest growing city in the country.

===Languages===
A demographic profile of Leicester published by the city council in 2008 noted:

Certain European languages such as Polish will undoubtedly feature in current statistics, although their prevalence may reduce subsequently as future generations rapidly assimilate or return to places of origin, given cultural and geographic proximity and changes in the geo-political environment.

===Population change===
The ONS 2014 basis population projections indicate the city will be home to 400,000 inhabitants by around 2035.

==Economy==

Leicester has the second largest economy in the East Midlands, after Nottingham.

Companies that have their principal offices or significant sites in Leicester and the surrounding area include; Brantano Footwear, Dunelm Mill, Next, Shoe Zone, Everards brewing and associated businesses, KPMG, Mazars, Cambridge &amp; Counties Bank, HSBC and Santander banking, Hastings Insurance, British Gas, British Telecom, Caterpillar (Inc.), Topps Tiles and DHL.

===Textiles===
The city has historically had a strong association with the production of textiles, clothing and shoes. While important companies such as Corah, Liberty Shoes and Equity Shoes have closed, companies such as Next and Boden are still active and ASOS and New Look manufacture in the city. Moreover, in recent years the higher transport prices and longer lead-times associated with globalised production in Asia mean some textile manufacturers are locating to the city.
There have long been concerns about the working conditions in this sector. Leicester&#x27;s garment district is home to more than 1,000 factories employing as many as 10,000 workers. It has received fewer than 60 health and safety inspections and only 28 fire inspections since October 2017. HMRC has made just 36 visits checking on compliance with minimum wage legislation; it has issued penalties to fewer than 10 textile firms and claimed just over £100,000 in arrears relating to 143 workers. Research at the University of Leicester in 2010 and published in 2015 found there were 11,700 employees in the East Midlands garment industry. 75-90% of them were being paid £3 per hour, which was less than half of the then legal minimum wage. In 2017 Peter Soulsby, Mayor of Leicester called together 40 regulatory organisations to coordinate a response. He aimed to make sure that Leicester had the highest standards of employment; that workers are properly paid, well trained and work in safe environments, In 2020 the HSE was alerted to COVID-19 non-compliance, made inspections and gave advice.

===Engineering===

Engineering companies include Jones &amp; Shipman (machine tools and control systems), Richards Engineering (foundry equipment), Transmon Engineering (materials handling equipment) and Trelleborg (suspension components for rail, marine, and industrial applications). Local commitment to nurturing British engineers includes apprenticeship schemes with local companies, and academic-industrial connections with the engineering departments at Leicester University, De Montfort University, and nearby Loughborough University. Leicester was also home to the famous Gents&#x27; of Leicester clock manufacturers.

===Shopping===

The city centre has two large shopping malls – Highcross Leicester and the Haymarket Shopping Centre. The Haymarket Shopping Centre opened in 1974 and has two levels of shopping, multi-storey parking for up to 500 cars, a bus station and is home to the Haymarket Theatre. Highcross Leicester opened in 2008 after work to redevelop &quot;The Shires Centre&quot; was completed at a cost of £350 million (creating 120 stores, 15 restaurants, a cinema, 110,000 m2 of shopping space).

St Martin&#x27;s Square and the Leicester Lanes area has numerous designer and specialist shops; several of the city&#x27;s Victorian arcades are located in the same neighbourhood. Leicester Market is the largest outdoor covered market in Europe. It central feature, the Leicester Corn Exchange, has been converted into a public house.

Central Leicester is the location for several department stores including John Lewis, Debenhams.

The Golden Mile is the name given to a stretch of Belgrave Road renowned for its authentic Indian restaurants, sari shops, and jewellers; the Diwali celebrations in Leicester are focused on this area and are the largest outside the sub-continent.

===Food and drink===

Henry Walker was a successful pork butcher who moved from Mansfield to Leicester in the 1880s to take over an established business in High Street. The first Walker&#x27;s crisp production line was in the empty upper storey of Walker&#x27;s Oxford Street factory in Leicester. In the early days the potatoes were sliced by hand and cooked in an ordinary deep fryer. In 1971 the Walker&#x27;s crisps business was sold to Standard Brands, an American firm, who sold on the company to Frito-Lay. Walker&#x27;s crisps makes 10 million bags of crisps per day at two factories in Beaumont Leys, and is the UK&#x27;s largest grocery brand. The Beaumont Leys manufacturing plant is world&#x27;s largest crisp factory.

Meanwhile, the sausage and pie business was bought out by Samworth Brothers in 1986. Production outgrew the Cobden Street site and pork pies are now manufactured at a meat processing factory and bakery in Beaumont Leys, coincidentally near to the separately owned crisp factories. Sold under the Walker&#x27;s name and under UK retailers own brands such as Tesco, over three million hot and cold pies are made each week. Henry Walker&#x27;s butcher shop at 4–6 Cheapside sold Walker&#x27;s sausages and pork pies until March 2012 when owner Scottish Fife Fine Foods ceased trading, although the shop was temporarily open and selling Walker&#x27;s pies for the Christmas season of 2012.

==Transport==
===Air===
East Midlands Airport (EMA), at Castle Donington north-north-west of the city, is the closest international airport. The airport is a national hub for mail/freight networks.

Leicester Airport (LRC) is a small airport, some east of Leicester city centre; it does not operate scheduled services.

===Road===

Leicester is at the midpoint of the primary English north/south M1 motorway between London and Leeds, served by junctions 21, 21A and 22. This is where the M1 transects with one of the primary north-east to south-west routes, the M69 motorway/A46 corridor linking to the A1 and M6 motorway at Newark-on-Trent and Coventry respectively. The M42 motorway towards Birmingham Airport terminates in north-west Leicestershire, some west-north-west of the Leicester urban area. Leicester is at the nexus of the A6/(A14), A50, A47 and A607 trunk roads and A426 and A5199 primary routes.

===Buses===
Leicester has two main bus stations: St. Margarets and Haymarket, which was recommissioned in May 2016. The main bus operators for Leicester and the surrounding area are Arriva Fox County, Centrebus, First Leicester, Hinckley Bus (Part of Arriva Midlands), Kinchbus, Leicester Bus and Stagecoach Midlands.

The Star trak real time system was introduced in 2000 by Leicester City Council; it allowed bus tracking and the retrieval of bus times by text message or online. The system was discontinued in 2011.

There are three permanent Park and Ride sites at Meynells Gorse (Leicester Forest East), Birstall and Enderby; buses operate every 15 mins from all sites. The park and ride services are branded as &quot;quicksilver shuttle&quot; and are contracted to Roberts&#x27; Coaches from the City Council and County Council; buses use a purpose-built terminal near St. Nicholas Circle.

Leicester has two circular bus services: Hop! which operates anticlockwise in the city centre via the railway station and Haymarket bus station, and the larger long Orbital which operates in both directions.

===Cycling===
National Cycle Network Route 6 passes through Leicestershire along with other secondary routes. The Leicester Bike Park is in Town Hall Square. &quot;Cycle Works&quot; Bike Mechanic Training Centre is in Wellington Street Adult Education Centre and former Central Lending Library.

From 2021 to 2023, the city had an electric bicycle sharing scheme, Santander Cycles Leicester. The scheme was a joint venture between Leicester City Council, the operator Ride On, Enzen Global as delivery partner and additional funding provided through sponsorship with Santander.

===Railway===
====Mainline rail====
The rail network is of growing importance in Leicester and, with the start of Eurostar international services from London St Pancras International in November 2007, Leicester railway station has gained connections at St. Pancras station to Lille, Brussels and Paris onwards.

Inter-city services are operated by East Midlands Railway providing connectivity on &#x27;fast&#x27; and &#x27;semi-fast&#x27; services to London, the south-east and to major locations in the East Midlands and Yorkshire; there are also local services operating within the East Midlands region. Trans-regional services to the West Midlands and East Anglia are provided by CrossCountry, enabling connections at nearby Nuneaton, onto the West Coast main line, and at Peterborough to the East Coast Main Line.

The from Leicester Railway Station to London St Pancras International on the Midland Main Line are covered in an average of 1hour 25minutes during the morning peak, with journey times as low as 1hour 6minutes later in the day. Transfers onto London Underground or Thameslink train services to London City or West End add another 15 to 25minutes to the journey time; double that to Canary Wharf. The journey time to Sheffield is around one hour, with Leeds and York taking approximately two. Birmingham is 50minutes away and Cambridge, via Peterborough, can be reached in around 1hour 55minutes with further direct services available onto Stansted Airport in north Essex.

====Great Central Railway====

The decommissioned Leicester Central railway station is on the late Victorian Great Central Railway line that ran from London Marylebone northwards. Beeching cuts closed the route in the late 1960s. A preserved section, however, remains operational in the East Midlands centred on Loughborough Central railway station providing tourist services through central Leicestershire&quot;,&quot; passing Swithland Reservoir on to the Leicester North railway station terminus.

===Waterways===

Two navigable waterways join at Leicester: The Leicester Line of the Grand Union Canal, and the River Soar Navigation. The Grand Union Canal links Leicester with London and Birmingham to the south, and joins the Soar in Leicester, which links the city to the River Trent, and the Trent and Mersey Canal to the north.

==Education==
===Schools===

Leicester is home to a number of comprehensive schools and independent schools. There are three sixth form colleges, all of which were previously grammar schools.

The Leicester City Local Education Authority initially had a troubled history when formed in 1997 as part of the local government reorganisation – a 1999 Ofsted inspection found &quot;few strengths and many weaknesses&quot;, although there has been considerable improvement since then.

Tudor Grange Samworth Academy an academy whose catchment area includes the Saffron and Eyres Monsell estates, was co-sponsored by the Church of England and David Samworth, chairman of Samworth Brothers pasty makers.

Under the &quot;Building Schools for the Future&quot; project, Leicester City Council has contracted with developers Miller Consortium for £315 million to rebuild Beaumont Leys School, Judgemeadow Community College, the City of Leicester College in Evington, and Soar Valley College in Rushey Mead, and to refurbish Fullhurst Community College in Braunstone.

Leicester City Council underwent a major reorganisation of children&#x27;s services in 2006, creating a new Children and Young People&#x27;s Services department.

===Tertiary===
Leicester is home to two universities, the University of Leicester, which attained its Royal Charter in 1957 and was ranked 12th by the 2009 Complete University Guide, and De Montfort University, which opened in 1969 as Leicester Polytechnic and achieved university status in 1992.

It is also home to the National Space Centre off Abbey Lane, due in part to the University of Leicester being one of the few universities in the UK to specialise in space sciences.
==Religion==

The Cathedral Church of Saint Martin, Leicester, usually known as Leicester Cathedral, is the Church of England cathedral and is the seat of the Bishop of Leicester. The church was elevated to a collegiate church in 1922 and made a cathedral in 1927 following the establishment of a new Diocese of Leicester in 1926.

The Church of England parish church of St Nicholas is the oldest place of worship in the city. Parts of the church certainly date from about 880 AD, and a recent architectural survey suggested possible Roman building work. The tower is Norman. By 1825 the church was in an extremely poor condition, and plans were made for its demolition. Instead, it was extensively renovated between 1875 and 1884, including the building of a new north aisle. Renovation continued into the twentieth century. A fifteenth-century octagonal font. from the redundant Church of St Michael the Greater, Stamford, was transferred to St Nicholas.

St Peter&#x27;s Lane takes its name from the former medieval church of that name, which closed in the 1570s, its parish having merged with All Saints church.

From the mid 17th century Leicester became a noted centre for Protestant Nonconformity and many sects constructed places of worship in the city including the Baptists, the Congregationalists, the Quakers, the Methodists, and the Unitarians. By the 19th century the Baptist, Methodist, and Congregational presence had grown to include churches in several districts across the city and the Nonconformist conscience did much to impact the city&#x27;s progressive politics. Many of these congregations are still active. In the aftermath of Catholic Emancipation in the 19th century a number of Roman Catholic churches and schools have been established in the city (see Catholic churches in Leicester).

In 2011 Christians were the largest religious group in the city at 32.4%, with Muslims next (18.6%), followed by Hindus (15.2%), Sikhs (4.4%), Buddhists (0.4%), and Jews (0.1%). In addition, 0.6% belonged to other religions, 22.8% identified with no religion and 5.6% did not respond to the question. The city is home to places of worship or gathering for all the faith groups mentioned and many of their respective sub-denominations.

<doc id="51158" wikidata="Q376178" url="?curid=51158" title="Straits Settlements">
<text>The Straits Settlements () were a group of British territories located in Southeast Asia. Originally established in 1826 as part of the territories controlled by the British East India Company, the Straits Settlements came under control of the British Raj in 1858 and then under direct British control as a Crown colony in 1867. In 1946, following the end of World War II and the Japanese occupation, the colony was dissolved as part of Britain&#x27;s reorganisation of its Southeast Asian dependencies in the area.

The Straits Settlements originally consisted of the four individual settlements of Penang, Singapore, Malacca, and Dinding. Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands were added in 1886. The island of Labuan, off the coast of Borneo, was also incorporated into the colony with effect from 1 January 1907, becoming a separate settlement within it in 1912. Most of the territories now form part of Malaysia, from which Singapore separated in 1965. The Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island were transferred from Singapore to Australian control in 1955 and 1958 respectively. Their administrations were combined in 1996 to form the Australian Indian Ocean Territories.

==Settlements==
===Dindings===
The Dindings — named after the Dinding River in present-day Manjung District — which comprised Pangkor Island and the town of Lumut on the mainland, were ceded by Perak to the British government under the Pangkor Treaty of 1874. It was hoped that its excellent natural harbour would prove to be valuable. This did not come to be with the territory being sparsely inhabited and altogether politically and financially unimportant. It was returned to Perak in February 1935.

===Malacca===
The Dutch colony of Malacca was ceded to the British in the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 in exchange for the British possession of Bencoolen and for British rights in Sumatra. Malacca&#x27;s importance was in establishing an exclusive British zone of influence in the region, and was overshadowed as a trading post by Penang, and later, Singapore.

===Penang and Province Wellesley===
The first settlement was the Penang territory, in 1786. This originally comprised Penang Island, then known as the ″&quot;Prince of Wales Island&quot;″. This was later extended to encompass an area of the mainland, which became known as Province Wellesley (now Seberang Perai). The first grant was in 1800, followed by another in 1831. Further adjustments to Province Wellesley&#x27;s border were made in 1859, in 1867 with a treaty with Siam and in 1874 with the Treaty of Pangkor. It was administered by a district officer, with some assistants, answering to the resident councillor of Penang. Province Wellesley consisted, for the most part, of a fertile plain, thickly populated by Malays, and occupied in some parts by sugar-planters and others engaged in similar agricultural industries and employing Chinese and Tamil labour. About a tenth of the whole area was covered by low hills with thick jungle. Large quantities of rice were grown by the Malay inhabitants, and between October and February, there was snipe-shooting in the paddy fields. A railway from Butterworth, opposite Penang, runs into Perak, and then via Selangor and Negri Sembilan to Malacca, with an extension via Muar under the rule of the Sultan of Johor, and through Johor to Johor Bahru, opposite Singapore.

===Singapore===
Singapore became the site of a British trading post in 1819 after its founder, Stamford Raffles, successfully involved the East India Company in a dynastic struggle for the throne of Johor. Thereafter the British came to control the entire island of Singapore, which was developed into a thriving colony and port. In 1824, the Dutch conceded any rights they had to the island in the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824, and from 1832, Singapore was the seat of government of the Straits Settlements for 114 years until its dissolution in 1946.

== History and government ==
===East India Company rule===
The establishment of the Straits Settlements followed the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824, by which the Malay Archipelago was divided into a British zone in the north and a Dutch zone in the south. This resulted in the exchange of the British settlement of Bencoolen (on Sumatra) for the Dutch colony of Malacca and undisputed control of Singapore. The population of the settlements were largely Chinese, with a tiny but important European minority. Their capital was moved from George Town, the capital of Penang, to Singapore in 1832. Their scattered nature proved to be difficult and, after the company lost its monopoly in the china trade in 1833, expensive to administer.
During their control by the East India Company, the settlements were used as penal settlements for Indian civilian and military prisoners, earning them the title &quot;Botany Bays of India&quot;. There were minor uprisings by convicts in Singapore and Penang in 1852 and 1853. Upset with East India Company rule, in 1857 the European population of the settlements sent a petition to the British Parliament asking for direct rule; but the idea was overtaken by the Indian Rebellion of 1857.

When a &quot;Gagging Act&quot; was imposed to prevent the uprising in India from spreading, the settlements&#x27; press reacted with anger, classing it as something that subverted &quot;every principle of liberty and free discussion&quot;. As there was little or no vernacular press in the settlements, such an act seemed irrelevant: it was rarely enforced and ended in less than a year.

===Crown colony status===
On 1 April 1867, the Straits Settlements were transferred to the British Colonial Office and became a Crown colony, making the settlements answerable directly to the Colonial Office in London instead of the Government of India in Calcutta. Earlier, on 4 February 1867, letters patent had granted the settlements a colonial constitution. This allocated much power to the settlements&#x27; governor, who administered the colony of the Straits Settlements with the aid of an Executive Council, composed wholly of official (i.e., ex-officio) members, and a legislative council, composed partly of official and partly of nominated members, of which the former had a narrow permanent majority. The work of administration, both in the colony and in the Federated Malay States, was carried on by means of a civil service whose members were recruited by competitive examination held annually in London.

Penang and Malacca were administered, directly under the governor, by resident councillors.

===Governor&#x27;s wider role===
In 1886, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands (which were settled and once owned by the Scottish Clunies-Ross family) and Christmas Island, formerly attached to Ceylon, were transferred to the care of the government of the Straits Settlements in Singapore. In 1907, the former Crown Colony of Labuan, in Borneo, which for a period was vested in the British North Borneo Company, was resumed by the British government and was vested in the governor of the Straits Settlements.

The governor was also High Commissioner for the Federated Malay States on the peninsula, for British North Borneo, the sultanate of Brunei and Sarawak in Borneo. British residents controlled the native states of Perak, Selangor, Negri Sembilan, and Pahang, but on 1 July 1896, when the federation of these states was effected, a resident-general, responsible to the high commissioner, was placed in charge of all the British protectorates in the peninsula.

===Japanese invasion and dissolution===
During World War II (specifically the Pacific War), the Japanese invaded Malaya and the Straits Settlements by landing on Kelantan on 8 December 1941. On 16 December, Penang became the first Straits Settlement to fall into Japanese hands, followed by Malacca on 15 January 1942. Singapore was the last settlement to fall on 15 February, following the Battle of Singapore. The Straits Settlements, along with the rest of the Malay Peninsula, remained under Japanese occupation until the end of the war in August 1945.

After the war, the colony was dissolved with effect from 1 April 1946, with Singapore becoming a separate Crown colony (and ultimately an independent republic), while Penang and Malacca joined the new Malayan Union (a predecessor of modern-day Malaysia). Labuan was briefly annexed to Singapore, before being attached to the new colony of North Borneo (and ultimately detacheded to become a Federal Territory).


== Population ==

The following are the area and population, with details of race distribution, of the colony of the Straits Settlements, the figures being those of the census of 1901:
The population, which was 306,775 in 1871 and 423,384 in 1881, had in 1901 reached a total of 572,249. As in former years, the increase was solely due to immigration, especially of Chinese, though a considerable number of Tamils and other natives of India settled in the Straits Settlements. The total number of births registered in the colony in 1900 was 14,814, and the ratio per 1,000 of the population during 1896, 1897, and 1898 respectively was 22–18, 20–82 and 21–57; while the number of registered deaths for 1896–1900 gave a ratio per 1000 of 42–21, 36–90, 30–43, 31–66 and 36-25 respectively, the number of deaths registered during 1900 being 23,385. The cause to which the excess of deaths over births is to be attributed is to be found in the fact that the Chinese and Indian population, which numbered 339,083, or over 59 per cent of the whole, was composed of 261,412 males and only 77,671 females, and a comparatively small number of the latter were married women and mothers of families. Male Europeans also outnumbered females by about two to one. Among the Malays and Eurasians, who alone had a fair proportion of both sexes, infant mortality was excessive due to early marriages and other causes.

The number of immigrants landing in the various settlements during 1906 was: Singapore 176,587 Chinese; Penang 56,333 Chinese and 52,041 natives of India; and Malacca 598 Chinese. The total number of immigrants for 1906 was therefore 285,560, against 39,136 emigrants, mostly Chinese returning to China. In 1867, the date of the transfer of the colony from the East India Company to the Crown, the total population was estimated at 283,384.

In 1939, the population reached 1,370,300.

== Finance ==
In the early nineteenth century, the most common currency used in the East Indies was the Spanish dollar, including issues both from Spain and from the New World Spanish colonies, most significantly Mexico, due to market circulation from the Spanish East Indies (Spanish Philippines). Locally issued coinages included the Kelantan and Trengganu keping, and the Penang dollar. In 1837, the Indian rupee was made the sole official currency in the Straits Settlements, as it was administered as part of India. However, Spanish dollars continued to circulate and 1845 saw the introduction of coinage for the Straits Settlements using a system of 100 cents = 1 Straits dollar, with the dollar equal to the Spanish dollar or Mexican peso. In 1867, the administration of the Straits Settlements was separated from India and the dollar was made the standard currency.

The revenue of the colony in 1868 amounted to $1,301,843. In 1906 revenue was $9,512,132, exclusive of $106,180 received for land sales. Of this sum, $6,650,558 was derived from import duties on opium, wines, and spirits, and licences to deal in these articles, $377,972 from land revenue, $592,962 from postal and telegraphic revenue, and $276,019 from port and harbour dues.

Expenditures, which in 1868 amounted to $1,197,177, rose in 1906 to $8,747,819. The total cost of the administrative establishments amounted to $4,450,791, of which $2,586,195 were personal emoluments and $1,864,596 other charges. The military expenditure (the colony paid on this account 20 per cent of its gross revenue to the British government by way of military contribution) amounted in 1906 to $1,762,438; $578,025 was expended on upkeep and maintenance of existing public works, and $1,209,291 on new roads, streets, bridges, and buildings.

<text>The photophone is a telecommunications device that allows transmission of speech on a beam of light. It was invented jointly by Alexander Graham Bell and his assistant Charles Sumner Tainter on February 19, 1880, at Bell&#x27;s laboratory at 1325 L Street in Washington, D.C. Both were later to become full associates in the Volta Laboratory Association, created and financed by Bell.

On June 3, 1880, Bell&#x27;s assistant transmitted a wireless voice telephone message from the roof of the Franklin School to the window of Bell&#x27;s laboratory, some 213 meters (about 700 ft.) away.

Bell believed the photophone was his most important invention. Of the 18 patents granted in Bell&#x27;s name alone, and the 12 he shared with his collaborators, four were for the photophone, which Bell referred to as his &quot;greatest achievement&quot;, telling a reporter shortly before his death that the photophone was &quot;the greatest invention [I have] ever made, greater than the telephone&quot;.

The photophone was a precursor to the fiber-optic communication systems that achieved worldwide popular usage starting in the 1980s. The master patent for the photophone ( &quot;Apparatus for Signalling and Communicating, called Photophone&quot;) was issued in December 1880, many decades before its principles came to have practical applications.

==Design==
The photophone was similar to a contemporary telephone, except that it used modulated light as a means of wireless transmission while the telephone relied on modulated electricity carried over a conductive wire circuit.

Bell&#x27;s own description of the light modulator:

The brightness of a reflected beam of light, as observed from the location of the receiver, therefore varied in accordance with the audio-frequency variations in air pressure—the sound waves—which acted upon the mirror.

In its initial form, the photophone receiver was also non-electronic, using the photoacoustic effect. Bell found that many substances could be used as direct light-to-sound transducers. Lampblack proved to be outstanding. Using a fully modulated beam of sunlight as a test signal, one experimental receiver design, employing only a deposit of lampblack, produced a tone that Bell described as &quot;painfully loud&quot; to an ear pressed close to the device.

In its ultimate electronic form, the photophone receiver used a simple selenium cell photodetector at the focus of a parabolic mirror. The cell&#x27;s electrical resistance (between about 100 and 300 ohms) varied inversely with the light falling upon it, i.e., its resistance was higher when dimly lit, lower when brightly lit. The selenium cell took the place of a carbon microphone—also a variable-resistance device—in the circuit of what was otherwise essentially an ordinary telephone, consisting of a battery, an electromagnetic earphone, and the variable resistance, all connected in series. The selenium modulated the current flowing through the circuit, and the current was converted back into variations of air pressure—sound—by the earphone.

In his speech to the American Association for the Advancement of Science in August 1880, Bell gave credit for the first demonstration of speech transmission by light to Mr. A.C. Brown of London in the Fall of 1878.

Because the device used radiant energy, the French scientist Ernest Mercadier suggested that the invention should not be named &#x27;photophone&#x27;, but &#x27;radiophone&#x27;, as its mirrors reflected the Sun&#x27;s radiant energy in multiple bands including the invisible infrared band. Bell used the name for a while but it should not be confused with the later invention &quot;radiophone&quot; which used radio waves.

==First successful wireless voice communications==

While honeymooning in Europe with his bride Mabel Hubbard, Bell likely read of the newly discovered property of selenium having a variable resistance when acted upon by light, in a paper by Robert Sabine as published in &quot;Nature&quot; on 25 April 1878. In his experiments, Sabine used a meter to see the effects of light acting on selenium connected in a circuit to a battery. However Bell reasoned that by adding a telephone receiver to the same circuit he would be able to hear what Sabine could only see.

As Bell&#x27;s former associate, Thomas Watson, was fully occupied as the superintendent of manufacturing for the nascent Bell Telephone Company back in Boston, Massachusetts, Bell hired Charles Sumner Tainter, an instrument maker who had previously been assigned to the U.S. 1874 Transit of Venus Commission, for his new &#x27;L&#x27; Street laboratory in Washington, at the rate of $15 per week.

On February 19, 1880, the pair had managed to make a functional photophone in their new laboratory by attaching a set of metallic gratings to a diaphragm, with a beam of light being interrupted by the gratings movement in response to spoken sounds. When the modulated light beam fell upon their selenium receiver Bell, on his headphones, was able to clearly hear Tainter singing &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot;.

In an April 1, 1880, Washington, D.C., experiment, Bell and Tainter communicated some along an alleyway to the laboratory&#x27;s rear window. Then a few months later on June 21 they succeeded in communicating clearly over a distance of some 213 meters (about 700 ft.), using plain sunlight as their light source, practical electrical lighting having only just been introduced to the U.S. by Edison. The transmitter in their latter experiments had sunlight reflected off the surface of a very thin mirror positioned at the end of a speaking tube; as words were spoken they cause the mirror to oscillate between convex and concave, altering the amount of light reflected from its surface to the receiver. Tainter, who was on the roof of the Franklin School, spoke to Bell, who was in his laboratory listening and who signaled back to Tainter by waving his hat vigorously from the window, as had been requested.

The receiver was a parabolic mirror with selenium cells at its focal point. Conducted from the roof of the Franklin School to Bell&#x27;s laboratory at 1325 &#x27;L&#x27; Street, this was the world&#x27;s first formal wireless telephone communication (away from their laboratory), thus making the photophone the world&#x27;s earliest known voice wireless telephone system, at least 19 years ahead of the first spoken radio wave transmissions. Before Bell and Tainter had concluded their research in order to move on to the development of the Graphophone, they had devised some 50 different methods of modulating and demodulating light beams for optical telephony.

==Reception and adoption==
The telephone itself was still something of a novelty, and radio was decades away from commercialization. The social resistance to the photophone&#x27;s futuristic form of communications could be seen in an August 1880 &quot;New York Times&quot; commentary:

However at the time of their February 1880 breakthrough, Bell was immensely proud of the achievement, to the point that he wanted to name his new second daughter &quot;Photophone&quot;, which was subtly discouraged by his wife Mabel Bell (they instead chose &quot;Marian&quot;, with &quot;Daisy&quot; as her nickname). He wrote somewhat enthusiastically:

Bell transferred the photophone&#x27;s intellectual property rights to the American Bell Telephone Company in May 1880. While Bell had hoped his new photophone could be used by ships at sea and to also displace the plethora of telephone lines that were blooming along busy city boulevards, his design failed to protect its transmissions from outdoor interferences such as clouds, fog, rain, snow and such, that could easily disrupt the transmission of light. Factors such as the weather and the lack of light inhibited the use of Bell&#x27;s invention. Not long after its invention laboratories within the Bell System continued to improve the photophone in the hope that it could supplement or replace expensive conventional telephone lines. Its earliest non-experimental use came with military communication systems during World War I and II, its key advantage being that its light-based transmissions could not be intercepted by the enemy.

Bell pondered the photophone&#x27;s possible scientific use in the spectral analysis of artificial light sources, stars and sunspots. He later also speculated on its possible future applications, though he did not anticipate either the laser or fiber-optic telecommunications:

==Further development==

Although Bell Telephone researchers made several modest incremental improvements on Bell and Tainter&#x27;s design, Marconi&#x27;s radio transmissions started to far surpass the maximum range of the photophone as early as 1897 and further development of the photophone was largely arrested until German-Austrian experiments began at the turn of the 20th century.

The German physicist Ernst Ruhmer believed that the increased sensitivity of his improved selenium cells, combined with the superior receiving capabilities of professor H. T. Simon&#x27;s &quot;speaking arc&quot;, would make the photophone practical over longer signalling distances. Ruhmer carried out a series of experimental transmissions along the Havel river and on Lake Wannsee from 1901 to 1902. He reported achieving sending distances under good conditions of 15 kilometers (9 miles), with equal success during the day and at night. He continued his experiments around Berlin through 1904, in conjunction with the German Navy, which supplied high-powered searchlights for use in the transmissions.

The German Siemens &amp; Halske Company boosted the photophone&#x27;s range by utilizing current-modulated carbon arc lamps which provided a useful range of approximately . They produced units commercially for the German Navy, which were further adapted to increase their range to using voice-modulated ship searchlights.

British Admiralty research during WWI resulted in the development of a vibrating mirror modulator in 1916. More sensitive molybdenite receiver cells, which also had greater sensitivity to infra-red radiation, replaced the older selenium cells in 1917. The United States and German governments also worked on technical improvements to Bell&#x27;s system.

By 1935 the German Carl Zeiss Company had started producing infra-red photophones for the German Army&#x27;s tank battalions, employing tungsten lamps with infra-red filters which were modulated by vibrating mirrors or prisms. These also used receivers which employed lead sulfide detector cells and amplifiers, boosting their range to under optimal conditions. The Japanese and Italian armies also attempted similar development of lightwave telecommunications before 1945.

Several military laboratories, including those in the United States, continued R&amp;D efforts on the photophone into the 1950s, experimenting with high-pressure vapour and mercury arc lamps of between 500 and 2,000 watts power.

==Commemorations==
On March 3, 1947, the centenary of Alexander Graham Bell&#x27;s birth, the Telephone Pioneers of America dedicated a historical marker on the side of one of the buildings, the Franklin School, which Bell and Sumner Tainter used for their first formal trial involving a considerable distance. Tainter had originally stood on the roof of the school building and transmitted to Bell at the window of his laboratory. The marker did not acknowledge Tainter&#x27;s scientific and engineering contributions.

On February 19, 1980, exactly 100 years to the day after Bell and Tainter&#x27;s first photophone transmission in their laboratory, staff from the Smithsonian Institution, the National Geographic Society and AT&amp;T&#x27;s Bell Labs gathered at the location of Bell&#x27;s former 1325 &#x27;L&#x27; Street Volta Laboratory in Washington, D.C. for a commemoration of the event.

The Photophone Centenary commemoration had first been proposed by electronics researcher and writer Forrest M. Mims, who suggested it to Dr. Melville Bell Grosvenor, the inventor&#x27;s grandson, during a visit to his office at the National Geographic Society. The historic grouping later observed the centennial of the photophone&#x27;s first successful laboratory transmission by using Mims hand-made demonstration photophone, which functioned similar to Bell and Tainter&#x27;s model.

Mims also built and provided a pair of modern hand-held battery-powered LED transceivers connected by of optical fiber. The Bell Labs&#x27; Richard Gundlach and the Smithsonian&#x27;s Elliot Sivowitch used the device at the commemoration to demonstrate one of the photophone&#x27;s modern-day descendants. The National Geographic Society also mounted a special educational exhibit in its Explorer&#x27;s Hall, highlighting the photophone&#x27;s invention with original items borrowed from the Smithsonian Institution.

<doc id="51164" wikidata="Q1388452" url="?curid=51164" title="Ronald Binge">
<text>Ronald Binge (15 July 1910 – 6 September 1979) was a British composer and arranger of light music. He arranged many of Mantovani&#x27;s most famous pieces before composing his own music, which included &quot;Elizabethan Serenade&quot; and &quot;Sailing By&quot;.
==Biography==
Binge was born in a working-class neighbourhood in Derby, Derbyshire, in the English Midlands. In his childhood he was a chorister at Saint Andrews Church (Church of England), London Road, Derby – &#x27;the railwaymen&#x27;s church&#x27; (demolished 1970). Binge was educated at the Derby School of Music, where he studied the organ. Early in his career he was a cinema organist, and later worked in summer orchestras in British seaside resorts (including Blackpool and Great Yarmouth), for which he learned to play the piano accordion. Binge&#x27;s skill as a cinema organist was put to good use, and he played the organ in Mantovani&#x27;s first band, the Tipica Orchestra. During the Second World War, he served in the Royal Air Force, during which time he was much in demand organising in-camp entertainment.

After the war, Mantovani offered Binge the job of arranging and composing for his new orchestra. With Mantovani, Binge also orchestrated Noël Coward&#x27;s musicals &quot;Pacific 1860&quot; (1946) and &quot;Ace of Clubs&quot; (1950). In 1951, his arrangement of &quot;Charmaine&quot; gave him and Mantovani worldwide success and recognition. However, he tired of writing arrangements, and turned to composing original works and film scores. Mantovani&#x27;s orchestra began playing his light orchestral pieces for radio broadcast, and in 1952 Binge devised and conducted his own BBC radio programme called String Song, playing many of his own compositions. He regularly composed for production and library music publishers, and a number of his works were used for radio and television signature tunes.

Binge married Vera Simmons in 1945. During the 1950s they lived at 18, Smitham Bottom Lane in Purley, Croydon. He died in Ringwood, Hampshire, of liver cancer in 1979, aged 69, survived by his wife, son and daughter.
==Compositions==
Binge was interested in the technicalities of composition and was most famous as the inventor of the &quot;cascading strings&quot; effect that is the signature sound of the Mantovani orchestra, much used in their arrangements of popular music. First heard on the hit &quot;Charmaine&quot; (1951) it was originally created to capture the essence of the echo properties of a building such as a cathedral, although it later became particularly associated with easy-listening music.

Binge&#x27;s catalogue includes hundreds of works, most of them light orchestral. His first big compositional success was the orchestral overture &quot;Spitfire&quot;, composed in Blackpool while he was still on RAF service, which predated William Walton&#x27;s orchestral tribute by a year. Best known today is probably &quot;Elizabethan Serenade&quot; (1951), which was used by the British Broadcasting Corporation as the theme for the popular 1950s series, &quot;Music Tapestry&quot;, and as the play-out for the British Forces Network radio station, and for which in 1957 he won an Ivor Novello Award. It was later turned into a vocal version called &quot;Where the Gentle Avon Flows&quot;, with lyrics by the poet Christopher Hassall. A reggae version of the tune, &quot;Elizabethan Reggae&quot;, was performed by Boris Gardiner in 1970.

Binge is also known for &quot;Sailing By&quot; (1963), which introduces the late-night Shipping Forecast on BBC Radio 4. Other well-known pieces include &quot;Miss Melanie&quot; (used as the theme for the CBS Network&#x27;s radio comedy &quot;The Couple Next Door&quot; from 1957 to 1960), &quot;Like Old Times&quot;, &quot;The Watermill&quot; (1958) for oboe and strings, and his Concerto for Alto Saxophone in E-flat major (1956). His largest, longest, and most ambitious work is the four-movement Symphony in C (or &quot;Saturday Symphony&quot;), which was written during his retirement between 1966 and 1968, and performed in Britain and Germany. It was issued as a recording by the South German Radio Orchestra, conducted by the composer.

<doc id="51165" wikidata="Q52626" url="?curid=51165" title="Formentera">
<text>Formentera (, ) is a Spanish island located in the Mediterranean Sea, which belongs to the Balearic Islands autonomous community (Spain) together with Mallorca, Menorca, and Ibiza.

Formentera is the smallest and most southerly island of the Pityusic Islands group (comprising Ibiza and Formentera itself, as well as various small islets). It covers an area of , including offshore islets. At the 2011 Census, the population was 10,583; according to the Census of 1 January 2021, it counted 11,891 inhabitants, while the official estimate at 1 January 2023 was 11,389.

== History ==
The island&#x27;s name is said to derive from the Latin word &quot;frumentarium&quot;, meaning &quot;granary&quot;. The island was occupied in prehistoric times, going back to 2,000–1,600 BC. Archaeological sites from that period remain in Ca na Costa, Cap de Barbaria (multiple sites) and Cova des Fum. The island had been occupied by the Carthaginians before passing to the ancient Romans. In succeeding centuries, it passed to the Visigoths, the Byzantines, the Vandals, and the Arabs. In 1109, Formentera was the target of a devastating attack by the Norwegian king Sigurd I at the head of the Norwegian Crusade. The island was conquered by James I the Conqueror, added to the Crown of Aragon and later became part of the medieval Kingdom of Majorca.

From 1403 to the early 18th century, the threat of Barbary pirate attacks rendered the island uninhabitable. On 17 June 1651, during the Franco-Spanish War (1635–1659), a squadron of Spanish galleys under John of Austria the Younger captured the French galleon &quot;Lion Couronné&quot; off this island.

The island and its surrounding islets became a separate insular council with the same territory as the eponymous municipality after 1977. Before that, it was administered in the former insular council of Ibiza and Formentera (covering the whole group of the Pityusic Islands), but in a separate comarca which already covered the current municipality of Formentera. This reform allowed Ibiza to unify its comarca of five municipalities with its new insular council, no longer administrating Formentera.

== Geography ==

The main island of Formentera is long and is located about south of Ibiza in the Mediterranean Sea. More specifically Formentera is part of the delimitation of the Balearic Sea, which is a northwestern element of the Mediterranean Sea. Its major villages are Sant Francesc Xavier, Sant Ferran de ses Roques, El Pilar de la Mola (on the La Mola peninsula), La Savina, and Es Pujols, the most important tourist destination of the island.

Formentera comprises one municipality, also called Formentera, and has a population of 11,981 (as of 1 January 2021). Its land area is . It is subdivided into several civil parishes (&quot;parròquies&quot;), themselves subdivided into &quot;vendas&quot; (&quot;véndes&quot; in Catalan).

North of Formentera is located Espalmador (in Catalan: &quot;Illa de S&#x27;Espalmador&quot;), the second largest island of the Pitiusas Islands, surrounded by a few minor islets.

Espalmador is a tombolo, separated from the main island of Formentera by a shallow sandbar. This area is a popular stopping point for those in yachts heading between Ibiza and Formentera.

===Climate===

Formentera has a semi-arid climate with hot, very dry summers and warm, dry winters. The flat orography of the island means that rainfall is scarce and the temperature is quite uniform. The average annual rainfall is 370–420 mm. The average annual temperature is between 17 and 18 °C. Overall, the climate is mild, with an average annual temperature of 18.6 degrees Celsius and 2883 hours of annual sunshine on average.


==Administration==
===Insular government===
Elections are held every four years concurrently with local elections. From 1983 to 2007, councilors were indirectly elected from the results of the election to Parliament of the Balearic Islands for the constituencies of Ibiza and Formentera (then forming a single Island council, with Formentera sending a single councilor to both Parliament and the Island council). Since 2007, however, separate direct elections are held to elect the Island Council of Formentera, with currently 17 seats (it only sends a single one to the Balearic Parliament).

== Attractions ==
Since the 1960s, Formentera has been a popular destination for hippies. Formentera is renowned across Europe for many pristine white beaches and the fact that nude sunbathing is allowed on most of its beaches.

Throughout its history, Formentera has been the subject of many legends, written in novels by famous writers such as Jules Verne, and in songs by musicians as varied as Gilberto Gil and Pink Floyd. From this artistic curiosity, the annual &quot;Formentera Jazz Festival&quot; has been held annually in early June and features many emerging and established musicians from the local and international scene.

The Canadian writer Patrick Roscoe was born in Formentera. Joni Mitchell wrote her 1971 album &quot;Blue&quot; on the island while Bob Dylan once slept on the Far de la Mola on the island. Author Matt Haig also writes about visiting the island often in his twenties in &quot;Reasons to Stay Alive&quot;. The opening track of the King Crimson album &quot;Islands&quot;, &quot;Formentera Lady&quot;, is named after the island. James Taylor also worked on his hit song &quot;Carolina in My Mind&quot; on holiday from recording with Apple Records, though he began writing it in London and completed it on the nearby island of Ibiza.

The Cap de Barbaria Lighthouse plays a pivotal role in Julio Medem&#x27;s 2001 Spanish film, &quot;Sex and Lucia (Lucía y el sexo)&quot;, which was filmed on the island and served as a touchstone for the various characters&#x27; interwoven relationships.

Although paved roads allow access to all parts of the island and cars are easily hired in the port, many people choose to rent mopeds or even bicycles due to the flat nature of most of the island and the availability of dedicated cycle tracks in many locations.

The island also has four Martello towers.

== Transport ==
With no airports, the island was formerly reachable only by boat from Ibiza, making it the quieter of the two islands, but in recent years regular passenger service from the Spanish mainland has increased tourism.

Ferry tickets from Ibiza are available in advance, as are transfers from Ibiza airport or port directly to accommodation in Formentera.

Ferries to Formentera operate from their own terminal in Ibiza port, with departures every half hour in high season on large (200+ passenger) fast catamarans. The journey takes approximately 30 minutes comprising 10 minutes leaving Ibiza, 10 minutes crossing the sea, and 10 minutes arriving in Formentera past the isthmus to Espalmador.

Some of the anchorages may not be suitable for sailboats under less than ideal circumstances.

== Culture ==
A local Ibizan (&quot;eivissenc&quot;) variant of the Balearic dialect of the Catalan language is spoken in Formentera. While the official languages are Catalan and Spanish, other major languages like English, Italian, German, French and Dutch can also be heard extensively in the summer due to mass tourism.

== Sports ==
From 1 September to 7 September, Formentera hosted the 2007 Techno 293 OD World Championships in windsurfing for juniors under 15 and youths under 17.

<text>Tapiola (; ) is a district of the municipality of Espoo on the south coast of Finland, and is one of the major urban centres of Espoo. It is located in the western part of Helsinki capital region. The name &quot;Tapiola&quot; is derived from &quot;Tapio&quot;, who is the forest god of Finnish mythology, especially as expressed in the &quot;Kalevala&quot;.

Tapiola was largely constructed in the 1950s and 1960s by the Finnish housing foundation and was designed as a garden city. It is the location of the Espoo cultural centre, the Espoo Museum of Modern Art (EMMA), the Espoo city museum, and the Espoo City Theatre.

According to the Finnish National Board of Antiquities, Tapiola was the largest and most valuable example of the 1960s construction ideologies in Finland. Its architecture and landscaping that combine urban living with nature have attracted tourists ever since.

==History==


After the Continuation War had ended in 1944 the entire country of Finland suffered from shortage of housing. In the Moscow Armistice, Finland had been forced to reinstate all the areas it had ceded from the Soviet Union, which meant that the evacuees from Finnish Karelia had to be settled in Finland. Already during the Continuation War, the Finnish Family Federation had decided that action had to be taken to relieve the shortage of housing.

Tapiola was one of the first post-war &quot;new town&quot; projects in Continental Europe. It was created by a private non-profit enterprise called Asuntosäätiö (the Housing Foundation), which was established in 1951 by six social trade organisations including the Confederation of Finnish Trade Unions, the Central Organisation of Tenants, the Mannerheim Child Welfare Federation, the Finnish Federation of Civilian and Military Invalids and the Civil Servants&#x27; Federation.

The project was conceived, built and managed by Heikki von Hertzen, the executive of the Asuntosäätiö and garden city advocate. Von Hertzen was a lawyer, who had worked as a branch manager for a bank in Tampere before becoming the director of the Finnish Family Federation.

Under von Hertzen&#x27;s leadership, the Housing Foundation bought 660 acres (267 ha) of forest land, six miles (9.65km) from the centre of Helsinki, and set out to create an ideal garden city. The role of the Housing Foundation included financing the project and overseeing the planning and building process so as to ensure consistency within different areas of the town. The Housing Foundation&#x27;s unique combination of various socio-political organisations facilitated the negotiation of funds with governmental bodies. Von Hertzen set out to create a modern urban environment that would address the housing shortage in Helsinki while also being economically viable and beautiful. Tapiola did not form part of any wider plan for Finland’s development other than von Hertzen&#x27;s Seven Towns Plan, a response to urban sprawl in Helsinki.

In 1946 von Hertzen explained his thoughts about urban planning in his pamphlet &quot;Koti vaiko kasarmi lapsillemme&quot; (&quot;A home or a barracks for our children?&quot;), where he strongly criticised the cramped and gloomy closed city blocks of Helsinki and defended the importance of nature in a built environment. This idea of a garden city movement was inspired by the garden design principles of the British Ebenezer Howard. New residential areas in Sweden also served as inspiration for Tapiola.

The original city plans for Tapiola were made by Otto-Iivari Meurman. Later, the Housing Foundation made significant changes to the plans, and handed planning of Tapiola over to a group of prominent Finnish architects, including Aarne Ervi, Alvar Aalto, and Kaija Siren. Each member of the group designed their own part of the area and its buildings, including social housing blocks (80% of all dwellings) and individual houses.

The planners of Tapiola were convinced that no one professional group could solve the manifold problems of modern community planning; planning has to be highly skilled and strictly directed teamwork at all levels. Tapiola is a result of close teamwork in the fields of architecture, sociology, civil engineering, landscape gardening, domestic science, and youth welfare.

The name of the garden city itself was chosen through a public competition in 1953. The winning name, which in Finnish means the home of the Tapio, the forest god from the Kalevala, was suggested by eleven different people. The prominent difference between the Finnish and Swedish names is explained by different etymologies. The Swedish name Hagalund comes from Hagalund manor, whose lands originally included the site of present-day Tapiola, even though the main building of the manor is actually located in nearby Otaniemi, separated from Tapiola by the Kehä I beltway. The original northernmost part of Tapiola was separated to its own district called Pohjois-Tapiola (&quot;Northern Tapiola&quot;).

Tapiola is also the cultural centre of Espoo, as it houses the Espoo cultural centre (home of the Tapiola Sinfonietta), the city museum (in the WeeGee house), and the Espoo City Theatre. The Tapiola library is located in the cultural centre.

==Urban planning==
Tapiola brought worldwide fame for Finnish urban planning. From its first stages it gained both a national and international reputation for its high class architecture and landscaping, as well as an ideological experiment. Tapiola&#x27;s planners aimed at demonstrating a new direction for Finnish town planning and housing. The aim of the Housing Foundation was to create a garden city which would be a microcosm of Finnish society: all social classes would live there and there would be different types of buildings, ranging from detached houses to terraced and multi-storey blocks. The slogan of the project was: &quot;we do not want to build houses or dwellings but socially healthful surroundings for contemporary man and his family&quot;. Tapiola provided a utopian vision of society and an alternative to what was seen at the time as an oppressive urban environment. In this sense, Tapiola was both an experiment and a model.

Tapiola was built using some of the principles of Ebenezer Howard&#x27;s garden city. The founder of Tapiola, Heikki von Hertzen, believed that it was not possible to create a satisfactory residential centre if the population density exceeded a certain figure. Hertzen&#x27;s vision for Tapiola, which was originally planned for an area of 600 acres, was to have only 26 residents per acre, and a total of 15,000 people. The ground was divided into four neighbourhood units, separated by green belts, and in the middle was built a main shopping and cultural centre to meet the needs of 30,000 inhabitants (including those of surrounding districts) (Hertzen 1959). An important feature of garden cities is the development of a self-contained community. This meant that as many jobs as possible had to be provided – as many as could be at a distance of less than 10 km from Helsinki.

The architects commissioned to plan Tapiola had also been influenced by Le Corbusier and other proponents of Modernism, and thus their urban ideals also included tower blocks forming impressive silhouettes, as well as a dense method of building. The various residential units which made up Tapiola comprise multi-storey blocks and individual homes, either detached or in rows, introducing a note of variety in the neighbourhood and allowing for the mixing of residents. Combining the architecture of modernism and the ideology of the garden city movement is credited for the huge interest in Tapiola&#x27;s planning history.

The main planning features on which Tapiola was built, as synthesised from Von Hertzen&#x27;s writings, are summarised below:
*The starting point of planning is the individuality of man and closeness to nature, and the aesthetic value of nature and use of natural contours of the landscape are retained wherever possible.
*Nature dominates, architecture is secondary. All buildings must harmonise with the natural setting.
*To be a working town, not a dormitory or nursery, providing as many jobs as possible to its inhabitants.
*The town should provide for a range of income levels – &quot;a community of everyman, where the ordinary worker, successful businessman and university professor can live side-by-side&quot;.
*Consistent placing of multi-story buildings with alternatively low housing, resulting in a feeling of spaciousness and variety.

===Neighbourhoods===
The development of Tapiola occurred in several stages: the eastern neighbourhood 1952 – 1956, the western neighbourhood, 1957-1960, the town centre 1958-1961-1970, the northern neighbourhood 1958-1967, the southern neighbourhood 1961-1965. Planning in Tapiola commenced with architect, Otto-Iivari Meurman&#x27;s site plan and building schedule which were reviewed from 1951 onwards. His original plan detailed four neighbourhoods split by two crossing roads and set apart by green belts.

Architects Aarne Ervi, Viljo Revell, Aulis Blomstedt and Markus Tavio were charged with designing the eastern neighbourhood based on Meurman&#x27;s plan. They were required to design buildings suited to the surrounding environment and the topography of the area.

A housing team was created to appraise the architects&#x27; housing designs; this process occurred more frequently during the development of the eastern neighbourhood. Team members were from a wide range of fields and included a building engineer, a heating engineer, two independent architects, an electrical engineer, a landscape gardener, a domestic science expert, a child welfare expert, a sociologist, and a housewife. This unique team, coupled with the board of the Housing Foundation, assessed housing designs, taking into consideration the needs and desires of future residents from a diverse range of backgrounds. The parties had different beliefs and values, which sometimes led to disagreements, for example the Housing Foundation was concerned with economising whilst the home-economics experts were chiefly concerned with the needs of families. Thus planning in Tapiola was collaborative and proactive as it involved targeting specific family types and classes, deciding on an ideal lifestyle for these residents, which accordingly influenced their behaviours. Many dwellings were designed to house a specific family-type and lifestyle. For example, it was perceived to be ideal to have families with children reside in dwellings, at or close to ground level in order for the children to have better access to the outdoors and to parks, whilst a tower block with one-room flats was designed to accommodate childless couples.

Meurman resigned from the board of governors of the Housing Foundation in 1954 following a shift from developing a town with low population density (six persons per acre) and low-rise buildings dwellings, as advocated by Meurman, to more multi-storey buildings and a higher population density (30 persons per acre) as recommended by other architects and the Housing Foundation. This shift was prompted by the need to accommodate a larger population, triggered by the housing shortage in Finland. Ervi took up Meurman’s position as master planner.

The development of the eastern neighbourhood led to the implementation of important planning principles such as providing facilities that encourage interaction and foster a sense of community as well as the separation of vehicles and pedestrians. It was also deemed necessary to have a mixture of building types located within the one area to encourage social diversification. The eastern and western residential areas of Tapiola featured curved streets of varying sizes and positions, whilst the northern neighbourhood designed by architect Pentti Ahola, marked a return to the orthogonal grid plan. Ahola&#x27;s design however, reflected the original aims of Tapiola; that of encouraging social diversification by locating a variety of building types within the one area. Financial concerns affected the development of the western area of Tapiola, leading to the construction of housing units that were economically feasible.

In 1953 Aarne Ervi was awarded the commission to plan the town centre. The aim of the town centre&#x27;s design was to provide all the facilities necessary for a modern urban centre and to maximise social interaction. The centre included a market square, public square, church, public premises, businesses and an administration building. As with the other areas of Tapiola, the centre was designed with consideration for the site&#x27;s features and terrain as well as to provide an active and versatile environment for pedestrians. Roads surrounded the central area producing a modern design completely separate from vehicles and featuring a special route for pedestrians and cyclists only (Tapionraitti). Ervi ensured the centre preserved the garden-city character of Tapiola by locating the buildings around an artificial lake, however this plan was considered strange and criticised for its lack of density. The centre was later expanded with a pedestrian based shopping centre linked to the Tapionraitti, notable for its undercover, outdoor pathways. Later developments showed less consideration for the natural surroundings, though most developments respected the dominance of the existing buildings. Tapiola&#x27;s centre did not expand to such an extent as to rival Helsinki.

==Services==

Finland&#x27;s first shopping centre, Heikintori, was opened in Tapiola in 1968. The Tapiola centre has a large selection of services: a department store (Stockmann), a book store (Akateeminen Kirjakauppa), groceries (K-Supermarket, Food Market Herkku), Alko, a post office, banks (Nordea, Danske Bank, Aktia, Osuuspankki, Ålandsbanken, Handelsbanken and Nooa Säästöpankki), photography stores, barber&#x27;s shops, and other small businesses. Public services include the Tapiola health centre, a library, an employment bureau.

===Public transportation===
Public transport in Tapiola consists of buses and the metro maintained by the Helsinki Regional Transport Authority. The Tapiola metro station, a station of the Helsinki Metro, opened as a part of Länsimetro (the Western Metro Extension) in November 2017.

===Sports services===
The Tapiola centre houses a swimming pool and the Tapiola bowling alley. Near the centre is also the Tapiola tennis park. In the Tuulimäki defense shelter there are premises for wrestling, judo, shooting (air guns and archery), table tennis, gymnastics and fencing. There is also a boxing ring in connection to the Tuulimäki gymnasium. In western Tapiola there is the Tapiola sports park, housing the ice hockey rink, skating rink and the tennis centre. The name Tapiola comes from a competition held by the apartment foundation. The lands originally belonged to the Hagalund mansion.

==Buildings==

In the centre of Tapiola, next to the central pool, there is the Tapiola Garden hotel, designed by Aarne Ervi. In autumn 2005, the highest wooden office building in Europe, called the Modular-office, was built in southern Tapiola by next to the Länsiväylä highway. The building is operated by Finnforest.
Tapiola is also the name of a Finnish insurance company, presumably from the location of its headquarters. Among other major companies headquartered in Tapiola are Huhtamäki and M-real.

In Otsolahti in eastern Tapiola, there is a small boat harbour for motor boats.
The Itäkartano area east of the Tapiola centre is famous for its apartment buildings built in the 1950s, visited by architects from all around the world. The Itäkartano centre operated as the centre of the whole district of Tapiola before the current central area was built. Remnants of this central role include Tapiola&#x27;s cinema, Kino Tapiola, by the Mäntyviita street, and office apartments. The area belongs to the Finnish museum bureau&#x27;s list of significant cultural environments. The highest, oldest, and most significant building in the area is the white, 11-storey Mäntytorni building.

To the north of Tapiola centre is a central park, Silkkiniitty, a large grass field reaching to Pohjois-Tapiola. It is popular among sportspeople and sunbathers.

According to the Finnish museum bureau, Tapiola is a unique phenomenon in the world. According to the bureau, new proposed changes to the city planning threaten the existence of this cultural heritage.

The WeeGee house, designed by architect Aarno Ruusuvuori and completed in 1964, is the former printing house of the Weilin+Göös publishing house. It currently hosts the Espoo Museum of Modern Art (EMMA), the Espoo City Museum, the Helinä Rautavaara Museum, the Finnish Museum of Horology, the Finnish Toy Museum, Galleria AARNI, and other cultural institutions.

Tapiola has its own metro station, the Tapiola metro station. The station was opened in November 2017.

== Controversies ==
The founder of the Garden City Tapiola, Heikki von Hertzen, considered suing the insurance company Tapiola in 1981 for stealing the trade name of Tapiola. The Garden City had used substantial resources in advertisement.

<text>The Karlovy Vary International Film Festival (, KVIFF) is an annual film festival held in Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic. The Karlovy Vary Festival is one of the oldest in the world and has become Central and Eastern Europe&#x27;s leading film event.

==History==

The pre-war dream of many enthusiastic filmmakers materialized in 1946 when a non-competition festival of films from seven countries took place in Mariánské Lázně and Karlovy Vary. Above all it was intended to screen the results of the recently nationalized Czechoslovak film industry. After the first two years the festival moved permanently to Karlovy Vary.

The Karlovy Vary IFF first held an international film competition in 1948. Since 1951, an international jury has evaluated the films. The Karlovy Vary competition quickly found a place among other developing festivals and by 1956 FIAPF had already classified Karlovy Vary as a category A festival. Given the creation of the Moscow Film Festival and the political decision to organize only one &quot;A&quot; festival for all socialist countries, Karlovy Vary was forced to alternate year by year with Moscow IFF between 1959 and 1993.

The social and political changes that took place after the Velvet Revolution in November 1989 pushed concerns about organizing the Karlovy Vary IFF to the background. The program for 1990 was saved by the release of a collection of Czechoslovak films that had been locked up for years in a storage vault. And the appearance of a number of international guests such as Miloš Forman, Lindsay Anderson, Annette Bening and Robert De Niro helped as well. Future festivals were in doubt. Financial problems and a lack of interest on the part of the government, organizers and viewers almost ended the festival&#x27;s long tradition in 1992.

In 1994, the 29th Karlovy Vary IFF inaugurated an entirely new tradition. After nearly forty years of alternating with the Moscow IFF, the festival began once again to take place every year. The Karlovy Vary Film Festival Foundation was set up in 1993 co-created by the Ministry of Culture, The City of Karlovy Vary, and the Grand Hotel Pupp. Actor Jiří Bartoška was invited to be the festival&#x27;s president, and Eva Zaoralová became program director in 1995. Since 1998, the organization of the festival has been carried out by Film Servis Festival Karlovy Vary, a joint stock company.

The 2020 edition was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic; a shortened event was later scheduled for 18–21 November, which will not be counted as an official edition of the festival (being promoted as the 54th and-a-half edition). Due to the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War, portions of the Odesa International Film Festival were hosted at KVIFF in July 2022.

==Program==

The main center of the festival is Hotel Thermal. The core of the program is the feature film competition; in accordance with FIAPF regulations only those films which have not been shown in competition at any other international festivals can be included. The documentary competition is an important festival event. The extensive informative program features both distribution pre-premiers and films awarded at other festivals. But it also includes discoveries of artistic creations by independent directors, productions coming out of little known film industries, retrospectives, and an overview of Czech film output during the past year. For the tenth straight year the festival will present Variety Critics&#x27; Choice: new and interesting films of mainly European production selected by critics working at this prestigious magazine.

Seminars focusing primarily on European film are another important part of the festival.

Thousands of visitors and the great variety of films testify to the effectiveness of the program team with program director Eva Zaoralová at its head. Due to their valiant efforts many films will be purchased at the festival for wider distribution or, thanks to receiving a festival award, will attract the attention of major producers, distributors, and the media.

The festival program has the following sections:
* &quot;Official Selection — Competition&quot; – films never before shown in competition at any other international festival.
* &quot;East of the West — Competition&quot; – films from the former socialist bloc.
* &quot;Documentary Films — Competition&quot; – a competition divided into two parts: documentaries less than and longer than 30 minutes.
* &quot;Horizons&quot; and &quot;Another View&quot; – a selection of the most remarkable contemporary films.
* &quot;Imagina&quot; — films with an unconventional approach to narration and style, distinctive and radical visions of film language.
* &quot;Out of the Past&quot; — classic, cult, rare and unfairly overlooked films, screened in their original and restored versions.
* &quot;Future Frames: Generation NEXT of European Cinema&quot; — ten directors, an upcoming generation of young European filmmakers, present their student films. The project is organized in cooperation with European Film Promotion.
* &quot;Midnight Screenings&quot; — a selection of the latest horror and action films, works that look at their genres in new, often humorous, ways.
* &quot;Czech Films&quot; – a representative selection of current Czech films.
* &quot;KVIFF Eastern Promises Industry Days&quot; — the industry section of the festival that includes Works in Development, First Cut+ and Works in Progress project presentations. The winners in these categories receive a $5000 prize.
* &quot;Tributes, special focuses and retrospectives&quot;.

==Awards==

Since 1948, the Grand Prize has been the Crystal Globe – although its form has often changed. As of the 35th Karlovy Vary IFF 2000 the Crystal Globe has taken on a new look: now the figure of a woman stands raising a crystal ball (artistic concept developed by Tono Stano, Aleš Najbrt, Michal Caban, and Šimon Caban).

The Feature Film Competition is divided into the following main awards: 
* Grand Prix – Crystal Globe for best feature film ($25,000)
* Special Jury Prize ($15,000)
* Best Director Award
* Best Actress Award
* Best Actor Award

The Documentary Competition is divided into the following main awards:
* Best Documentary Film in the category for film lasting 30 minutes or less
* Best Documentary Film in the category for film lasting above 30 minutes in length

Each year, the festival also presents the Crystal Globe for Outstanding Contribution to World Cinema.

<doc id="51169" wikidata="Q93351" url="?curid=51169" title="Vichy">
<text>Vichy (, ; ) is a city in the Allier department in central France. Located on the Allier river, it is a major spa and resort town and during World War II was the capital of Vichy France. As of 2021, Vichy has a population of 25,789.

Known for its mineral springs since the Roman times, Vichy had become a major destination for the French nobility and the wealthy by the late 18th century. The town developed further under the patronage of Napoleon III. Following the 1940 armistice, the pro-German collaborationist government headed by Philippe Pétain set up at Vichy, which remained the &quot;de facto&quot; capital of the French rump state for the next four years. After the war, the city experienced a period of great prosperity but went into decline from the 1960s.

In 2021, the town became part of the transnational UNESCO World Heritage Site under the name &quot;Great Spa Towns of Europe&quot; because of its famous baths and its architectural testimony to the popularity of spa towns in Europe from the 18th through 20th centuries.

==Name==
Vichy is the French form of the Occitan name of the town, &#x27;, of uncertain etymology. Dauzat &amp; al. have proposed that it derived from an unattested Latin name (&#x27;) referencing the most important regional landowner (presumably a &quot;Vippius&quot;) during the time of the Roman emperor Diocletian&#x27;s administrative reorganizations and land surveys at the end of the 3rd century AD.

The name Vichy may be pronounced or in either American or British English; its usual French pronunciation is . The pronunciation of the Occitan name &quot;&quot; is .

In French, the present-day demonym for a female resident or native of Vichy is &quot;, f sg&quot; (&quot;Vichyssoises, f pl&quot;) and &quot;, m sg&quot; for a male, and &quot;Vichyssois m pl&quot; for a mixed group of both sexes. Until the 18th century, it was also common to use &quot;&quot;(&quot;e&quot;), which derived from the Occitan name of the town. The cold soup vichyssoise is also named after the town.

== Geography and geology ==
Vichy lies on the banks of the river Allier. The source of the Allier is in the nearby Massif Central plateau which lies only a few miles to the south, near the region&#x27;s capital, Clermont-Ferrand.

The historical existence of volcanic activity in the Massif Central is somewhat visually evident. Volcanic eruptions have happened for at least 150,000 years, but all volcanoes there have been dormant for at least 112 years. Volcanic activity in the area is the direct cause of the many thermal springs that exist in and around Vichy.

The famous mineral springs in Vichy are rich in trace elements such as lithium and fluorine, and high in sodium bicarbonate. The temperatures of the spring range from 73 degrees C at Antoine Spring to 14 degrees C at Lafayette Spring. In total, about 289 springs have been charted in Vichy and its surroundings. These springs are derived from infiltration through Oligocene-period sedimentary rocks, part of the Limagne Graben collapse basin.

===Climate===
Vichy enjoys an oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;). Heavy snows in the Massif Central often make roads impassable, but Vichy is low enough—about above sea level—that the climate is more continental than mountain. Rainfall is moderate around Vichy, averaging about annually.

&lt;br&gt;

== History ==

=== Roman era ===
The first known settlement at Vichy was established by Roman legionaries in 52BC. Returning south from their defeat at the Battle of Gergovia by the Gauls under Vercingetorix, they found the hot mineral springs beside the &quot;&quot; (&quot;River Allier&quot;) and established the township of Aquae Calidae (Latin for &quot;Hot Waters&quot;). During the first two centuries AD, Vichy became fairly prosperous because of the supposed medicinal value of the thermal springs.

=== Middle Ages ===
On 2 September 1344, John II of France ceded the noble fiefdom of Vichy to Peter I, Duke of Bourbon. On 6 December 1374, the last part of Vichy was acquired by Louis II, Duke of Bourbon. At that point Vichy was incorporated into the House of Bourbon. In 1410, a Celestinian monastery was founded with twelve monks. A building located above the Celestinian Spring is still visible.

In 1527, the House of Bourbon was incorporated into the French Kingdom. By the end of the 16th century, the mineral baths had obtained a reputation for having quasi-miraculous curing powers and attracted patients from the noble and wealthy classes. Government officials, such as Fouet and Chomel, began to classify the curing properties of the mineral baths.

=== Vichy&#x27;s thermal baths ===
Marie de Rabutin-Chantal, marquise de Sévigné was a patient in 1676 and 1677 and would popularize Vichy&#x27;s Thermal Baths through the written descriptions in her letters. The Vichy waters were said to have cured the paralysis in her hands, thus enabling her to take up letter-writing. In 1761 and 1762, Adélaïde and Victoire of France, the daughters of Louis XV, came to Vichy for the first time and returned in 1785. The bath facilities seemed extremely uncomfortable to them because of the muddy surroundings and insufficient access. When they returned to Versailles, they asked their nephew Louis XVI to build roomier and more luxurious thermal baths, which were subsequently completed in 1787.

In 1799, Laetitia Bonaparte, mother of Napoleon, came to be cured with her son Louis. Under the Empire, &quot;Le Parc des Sources&quot;, was created on the Emperor&#x27;s orders (Decree of Gumbinen of 1812).

Under Charles X, the great increase in patients wishing to be healed at the springs led to an expansion of the hydrotherapeutic facilities. Princess Marie-Thérèse-Charlotte expanded the &quot;Janson&quot; buildings under the plan of &quot;Rose – Beauvais&quot; (work completed in 1830). From 1844 to 1853, theatrical and poetry recitals were performed for the wealthy in the comfort of their own homes by .

=== Vichy in style ===
By the 19th century, Vichy was a &quot;station à la mode&quot;, attended by many celebrities. However, it was the stays of Napoleon III between 1861 and 1866 that were to cause the most profound transformation of the city: dikes were built along the Allier, of landscaped gardens replaced the old marshes and, along the newly laid-out boulevards and streets, chalets and pavilions were built for the emperor and his court. Recreational pursuits were not spared: in view of the park, a large casino was built by the architect Badger in 1865. The Emperor would be the catalyst of the development of a small rail station, which increased the number of inhabitants and visitors tenfold in fifty years.

After the Second French Empire, the Belle Époque marked the second large construction campaign in Vichy. In 1903, the Opera House (l&#x27;Opéra), the Hall of Springs and a large bath designed in the eastern style were inaugurated. In 1900, the &quot;Parc des Sources&quot; was enclosed by a metal gallery which came from the World Fair of 1889. long, it is decorated by a &quot;frise de chardons&quot; and was completed by the ironworker Emile Robert. Many private mansions with varied architectural styles were erected during the first half of the 20th century.

Vichy welcomed 40,000 &quot;curistes&quot; in 1900, and that figure had risen to nearly 100,000 just before the onset of the First World War. &quot;La vie thermale&quot; had its heyday in the 1930s. The success in treating ailments that was attributed to the Vichy Baths led &quot;la Compagnie Fermière&quot; to enlarge the Baths again by creating the Callou and Lardy Baths. The Art Nouveau-style Opéra, inaugurated in 1903, accommodated all the great names on the international scene. Vichy became the summertime music capital of France, but the war of 1914 would put a brutal end to that development.

=== World War II - Seat of the pro-German collaborationist government ===
Following the stunning defeat of Allied forces in just four weeks, on 10 June 1940 the French government fled Paris for Bordeaux. On 22 June France signed an armistice, which stipulated German occupation of the north and west of the country, including Paris and all of the Atlantic coast. The remaining two-fifths of France became the unoccupied Free Zone (&quot;Zone Libre&quot;). On 29 June the government and its parliamentarians moved to Clermont-Ferrand.  Finding that city too cramped, on 1 July it moved on to Vichy. 

German forces had taken the city unopposed on 19 June, but departed with the Armistice. Vichy had the country&#x27;s second largest hotel capacity, and a modern telephone exchange and post office built for its international visitors. The city was in the unoccupied zone 45 km south of the Demarcation Line, relatively close to Paris (4.5 hours by train), and surrounded by productive agricultural lands. Pierre Laval, soon to be Prime Minister, hailed from Châteldon, a village 20 km south of Vichy. The city was, in any case, expected to be only a temporary seat of government until signature of the peace treaty.

On 9–10 July, 670 of the 846 members of the Senate and Chamber of Deputies met in the Vichy Opera House, where they overwhelmingly voted full powers to Philippe Pétain and authorized him to revise the constitution. The new regime called itself simply the French State (&quot;État Français&quot;), but it quickly came to be known as Vichy France. While Paris remained the official capital and much of the bureaucracy stayed there, Vichy was the &quot;de facto&quot; capital. It was home to Pétain&#x27;s cabinet, top civil servants, the diplomatic corps, and the neutered parliamentarians. As the volume of individuals engaged in government activity adversely affected locals and the spa business, a system of residence permits was established that permitted only 5 days maximum stay between 1 June and 30 September.

Following the Anglo-American invasion of North Africa in November 1942, Germany occupied the Free Zone, including Vichy. The Pétain government remained, albeit with an even smaller range of effective action. The city became a center for Gestapo and the Vichy &quot;milice&quot;. After the Allied breakout from Normandy in August 1944, the Germans took Pétain and his entourage to exile in Germany. The Swiss Ambassador, Walter Stucki, arranged for the peaceful withdrawal of local German forces and the &quot;milice&quot;. The FFI liberated the city on 26 August without bloodshed.

The term &quot;Vichyste&quot;, which designates partisans of the Pétain regime, should not be confused with &quot;Vichyssois&quot; which designates the inhabitants of the city. 

=== &quot;Reine des villes d&#x27;eaux&quot; ===
The 1950s and 1960s would become the most ostentatious period for Vichy, complete with parading personalities, visits from crowned heads (Thami El Glaoui, the Pasha of Marrakech; Prince Rainier III of Monaco) and profits from a massive influx of North African French clients who holidayed in Vichy, spending lavishly. There were thirteen cinemas (which sometimes showed special previews), eight dance halls and three theatres. It was at this period that the station would take the title of &quot;Reine des villes d&#x27;eaux&quot; (Queen of the Spa Towns).

From June to September, so many French-Algerian tourists were arriving that it almost seemed like there was an airlift set up between Vichy-Charmeil and the airports of Algeria. Mayor (1950–1967) decided to create Lake Allier (10 June 1963) and Omnisports Park (1963–68), giving the city its current look.

=== Decline of Vichy ===
The war in Algeria (1950s-60s), which led to decolonization, marked once again a halt in the prosperity of Vichy, which from then on had to deal with much less favorable conditions. The need to continue to pay the debts incurred by the considerable investments that had been made in more prosperous times obligated the new mayor, (1967–1989), the successor of Pierre Coulon, to adopt a much more careful policy of management.

=== Modern revival ===
Claude Malhuret, former Minister of Human Rights, born in Strasbourg in 1950, was mayor from 1989 to 2017. He and Bernard Kouchner are the co-founders of Doctors Without Borders (&quot;Médecins Sans Frontières&quot;). The city and its economic partners have concluded an important program of restoration and modernization. These projects include:
* creation of a vast pedestrian zone in the city center
* a program of modernization
* upgrading of hotels to the sector standards
* rebuilding and restoration of the thermal baths
* organization of a balneotherapy center dedicated to well-being
* development of the architectural heritage
* construction of a congress center within the old Casino, and
* restoration of the Opera
* rebuilding of the covered market, called &quot;Grand Marché&quot; (2006)
* restoration of the train station and surroundings (2009)
* restoration of the &quot;Rue de Paris&quot;, a main street in the city centre (2010)

The city was first noted for its thermal cures in Roman times. Its waters come from springs such as the Vichy Celestins and Vichy Saint-Yorre.
Vichy Pastilles (made in Vichy) are octagon-shaped candies made from soda contained in the spring waters.

The health and beauty business, with the laboratories of the L&#x27;Oréal company, also make it possible to publicize the city&#x27;s name to a worldwide audience under the Vichy brand.

Unlike the neighbouring communes on the Allier such as industrial Montluçon and administrative seat Moulins, Vichy&#x27;s economy is centred on the tertiary sector, with companies like the Compagnie de Vichy developing the health and well-being sector to mitigate the decline of medical hydrotherapy. The local market, open on Sundays, attracts shoppers from tens of kilometres around.

The closing of two important local employers, the Manurhin company and the Sediver company, has reduced employment in the Vichy basin. Job creation by developing companies such as the NSE electronics company or the Satel call center company may not completely compensate for the removal of jobs, despite the internet tour operator Karavel&#x27;s establishment of a new call center in May 2005.

Nevertheless, the two most important employers of the city belong to the public sector: the hospital (1,120 employees), and the town hall (500).

Since 1989, Vichy has been one of the seven sites of the European Total Quality Institute (&quot;Institut Européen de la Qualité Totale&quot;).

The &quot;Pôle Universitaire de Vichy&quot; (previously called Pôle Universitaire et Technologique Lardy), born from a project of thermal waste land rehabilitation and launched during the mid-1990s, is an economic priority. This campus accommodates 600 students in the downtown area, in ten areas of study including the fields of biotechnology, international trade, multi-media and languages.

The CAVILAM – Alliance Française (Centre of Live Approaches to Languages and the Media), receives students from diverse countries who want to learn French. Created in 1964, under the impulse of the Universities of Clermont-Ferrand and the city of Vichy, CAVILAM – Alliance Française joined the international network of the Alliance Française in 2012. After the Covid lockdown, the center developed online courses for FLE teachers, FLE ressources pages, and foreign language courses for locals.

The Palace of the Congresses is a venue primarily for the conferences of trade associations and learned societies. The structure is in area, including two plenary rooms and fifteen multi-use rooms. With 25,000 visitors yearly, the conferences must carry the economic role once held by the hydrotherapy industry, which today counts only 12,000 patients each year. The hydrotherapy business will now have to reorganise itself to take a less strict therapeutic-only role, and adapt to patients&#x27; stays shorter than the traditional three weeks.

=== Building projects ===

Under the authority of the local communities, much work is being done on building sites and projects, which will deeply modify Vichy in the years to come. The construction by the Hotel of the Community of Agglomeration in September 2005 on the old site of the &quot;Commercial City&quot; may precede the total restoration of the market hall &quot;Le Grand Marché&quot; (which would cost €5.9 million) which would be delivered in September 2006. Other projects include the creation of a mother-child centre in the hospital complex, the restoration of the spa façade (removal of the metal boarding to uncover the original style of 1862), the transformation of the spa into a multi-use center, creation of parks with fountains in place of parking lots, the demolition and the transformation of the buildings in a congested area to create an enterprise center intended to create 800 jobs (opened in early 2008), the construction of a new aquatic stadium including five basins (open since 2008), and motorway connection (opened in early 2015).

<text>The Batavian Republic (; ) was the successor state to the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands. It was proclaimed on 19 January 1795 and ended on 5 June 1806, with the accession of Louis Bonaparte to the Dutch throne. From October 1801 onward, it was known as the Batavian Commonwealth (). Both names refer to the Germanic tribe of the &quot;Batavi&quot;, representing both the Dutch ancestry and their ancient quest for liberty in their nationalistic lore.

In early 1795, intervention by the French Republic led to the downfall of the old Dutch Republic. The new republic enjoyed widespread support from the Dutch populace and was the product of a genuine popular revolution. However, it was founded with the armed support of the French Revolutionary Army. The Batavian Republic became a client state, the first of the &quot;sister-republics&quot;, and later part of the French Empire of Napoleon. Its politics were deeply influenced by the French, who supported no fewer than three &quot;coups d&#x27;état&quot; to bring the different political factions to power that France favored at different moments in its own political development. Nevertheless, the process of creating a written Dutch constitution was mainly driven by internal political factors and not by French influence until Napoleon forced the Dutch government to accept his brother, Louis Bonaparte, as monarch.

The political, economic, and social reforms that were brought about during the relatively short duration of the Batavian Republic have had a lasting impact. The confederal structure of the old Dutch Republic was permanently replaced by a unitary state. For the first time in Dutch history, the constitution that was adopted in 1798 had a genuinely democratic character. For a time, the Republic was governed democratically, although a coup d&#x27;état in 1801 put an authoritarian regime in power after another change to the constitution. The influence of this period helped smooth the transition to a more democratic government in 1848 (the constitutional revision by Johan Rudolph Thorbecke, limiting the power of the king). A type of ministerial government was introduced for the first time in Dutch history and many of the current government departments date their history back to this period.

Though the Batavian Republic was a client state of France, its successive governments tried to maintain a degree of independence and to serve Dutch interests even where they clashed with the interests of the French. This clash of interests led to the eventual demise of the Republic when the short-lived experiment with the regime of &quot;Grand Pensionary&quot; Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck proved unsatisfactory to Napoleon. The subsequent king Louis Bonaparte also refused to follow French dictates, which ultimately led in turn to his downfall in 1810 when the territory was annexed into the French Empire.

==Background==
Due to the disastrous Fourth Anglo-Dutch War, the Patriot party revolted against the authoritarian regime of Stadtholder William V but were quickly struck down through the intervention of William&#x27;s brother-in-law Frederick William II of Prussia in September 1787. Most Patriots went into exile in France, while The Netherlands&#x27; own &quot;ancien régime&quot; strengthened its grip on Dutch government chiefly through the Orangist Grand Pensionary Laurens Pieter van de Spiegel. This &quot;de facto&quot; status of Anglo-Prussian protectorate was internationally formalized in 1788 by the Act of Guarantee (for which Great Britain and Prussia acted as guarantors) and the Triple Alliance between the Dutch Republic, Prussia, and Great Britain. The Netherlands was little more than a pawn for the major powers.

The French Revolution embraced many of the political ideas that the Patriots had espoused in their own revolt. The Patriots enthusiastically supported the Revolution, and when the French revolutionary armies started to spread the revolution, the Patriots joined in, hoping to liberate their own country from its authoritarian yoke. The Stadtholder joined the ill-fated First Coalition of countries in their attempt to subdue the suddenly anti-Austrian French First Republic. The Patriots sought French revolutionary aid in their struggle against the stadholder, but did not want to be considered territory conquered by France, but rather a &quot;sister republic&quot;. There was open warfare, with the Patriots&#x27; cause dependent on its success on the battlefield. With the defeat of allies of the stadholder at Battle of Fleurus, Austria abandoned its interest in the southern Netherlands. French revolutionary forces were able to take advantage of the freezing of rivers in December 1794 and forced the stadholder into exile.

==Creation of the Republic==

The French Revolutionary War proceeded disastrously for the forces of the Stadtholder. In the severe winter of 1794/95 a French army under General Charles Pichegru, with a Dutch contingent under General Herman Willem Daendels, crossed the great frozen rivers that traditionally protected the Netherlands from invasion. Aided by the fact that a substantial proportion of the Dutch population looked favorably upon the French incursion, and often considered it a liberation, the French were quickly able to break the resistance of the forces of the Stadtholder and his Austrian and British allies. However, in many cities revolution broke out even before the French arrived and Revolutionary Committees took over the city governments, and (provisionally) the national government as well. William was forced to flee to England on a fishing boat on 18 January 1795.

==Historical stages of the Republic==

The French presented themselves as liberators. But there were acrimonious negotiations between the representatives of the new Batavian Republic and those of the French Republic, and a harsh Treaty of The Hague was concluded on 16 May 1795. In addition to imposing territorial concessions and a huge indemnity, the treaty obligated the Dutch to maintain a French army of occupation of 25,000 men. To fulfill its responsibilities, Dutch financier Pieter Stadnitski joined a committee at the end of July 1795. To beat hyperinflation it was announced that from 3 August French soldiers in the Batavian Republic would be paid in sound Dutch currency and going forward no one could be obliged to accept French assignats. This changed the Dutch republic from a client state of Great Britain and Prussia into a French one; henceforth it would conduct a foreign and military policy dictated by France, where its predecessor had followed British dictates since 1787 (an offensive and defensive alliance of the two republics was part of the treaty). With the treaty, economic policies would in effect also be made subservient to the interests of France, but this did not mean that it lost its independence in all respects. The program of reform that the Dutch revolutionaries attempted to put in place, constrained by the political realities of the French revolution, was mostly driven by Dutch needs and aspirations. The political events in the Netherlands were mainly derived from Dutch initiative, with some notable exceptions. The French were responsible for at least one of the coups d&#x27;état, and the French ambassador often acted as a proconsul.

===Revolutionary States-General===


At first, the revolutionaries used the constitutional machinery of the old confederal republic. They resumed where they had left off after the purge in 1787 of Patriot regents, taking over the offices of the Orangist regents that were now purged in their turn. (For instance, the States of Holland and West Friesland were replaced by having the 18 cities that formally were represented in those States send representatives to a constituent assembly that formally abolished the States and founded a new body, the Provisional Representatives of the People of Holland, that took over the functions of the States of Holland as long as the States General continued to exist). Though the political make-up of the States General changed appreciably because of this change in personnel, it retained a number of defenders of the old particularist interests. The first order of business of the revolutionaries therefore was to strive for the reform of the confederal state, with its discrimination of the Generality Lands, and of particular minorities (Catholics, Jews), in the direction of a unitary state, in which the minorities would be emancipated, and the old entrenched interests superseded by a more democratic political order. As a first step the representatives of Brabant were admitted to the States General.

However, a grass-roots democratic movement began to form in the Summer of 1795, consisting of popular societies (clubs) and &quot;wijkvergaderingen&quot; (precinct meetings), demanding popular influence on the government. A kind of parallel government in the form of &quot;general assemblies&quot; sprang up next to the city governments and the provincial States that repeatedly came into conflict with the established order. In the Fall of 1795 the States General started to work on a procedure to peacefully replace itself, &quot;by constitutional means&quot;, with a National Assembly that would possess full executive, legislative and constituent powers. This project at first met with sharp resistance from the conservatives. In some cases even force was used (as in Friesland and Groningen) to overcome this opposition. The new National Assembly convened in The Hague on 1 March 1796.

===Struggle for a constitution===

Like the old revolutionary States-General, the new National Assembly contained radically opposed parties: the unitary democrats, led by Pieter Vreede, Johan Valckenaer and Pieter Paulus, and the federalists, such as Jacob Abraham de Mist and Gerard Willem van Marle. But there was a broad continuum of opinion between these poles. In this force-field the federalists held the upper hand after the sudden demise of Paulus (who might otherwise have acted as a unifier). The conservative federalists were more adept at parliamentary manoeuvering. Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck proved himself especially adept at this. The frustration this engendered among the democrats led them to appeal to popular opinion and to extra-parliamentary action. Meanwhile, the Assembly installed a constitutional commission that in November 1796 presented a report that amounted to a continuation of the old federal arrangements. As this was totally unacceptable to the unitarists, this draft was subsequently amended into its opposite, by a compromise that finally formed a basis for a new Constitution. The Assembly now began discussing other important matters, such as the separation between church and state, and the emancipation of minorities. The organs of the state were to be a bicameral &quot;Legislative Corps&quot;, to be elected in indirect elections, and a Directory-like Executive of five members. The end result looked much like the French Constitution of 1795. This was approved by the Assembly on 10 May 1797.

The draft-Constitution was to be subjected to a referendum on 8 August 1797, after a very lively campaign in which the French ambassador Noël weighed in with a supportive appeal. This probably contributed to the resounding defeat of the proposal (108,761 votes to 27,995). The Assembly was back at square one. At this moment foreign events in the form of the 18 Fructidor coup of General Pierre Augereau intervened. This brought the more radical faction to power in France, which proved to be ultimately less patient with the vagaries of the Dutch political process, and more prone to intervene. Elections for a second National Assembly returned one in which the balance of power had shifted to the unitarists in the Fall of 1797. Nevertheless, the federalists managed to retain control of the new constitutional commission by a bare majority. This led to more dawdling and the unitarists in the Assembly now came with their own proposal in the form of the &quot;Declaration of 43&quot; on 12 December 1797, containing a nine-point manifesto concerning the minimum conditions to which the new constitution should conform.

Now the course of events started to speed up. The new French ambassador Charles-François Delacroix took the side of the radicals. His behavior sufficiently intimidated the opponents of the radical proposals to actually fall in line. The coup that was to follow was therefore in reality superfluous. Nevertheless, the radicals, led by Wybo Fijnje and Willem Ockerse, in collaboration with Pierre Auguste Brahain Ducange, the secretary of the French ambassador, now started to plot the coup d&#x27;état of 21–22 January 1798, which, with the assistance of General Herman Willem Daendels, put the radicals in power. A rump assembly of about fifty radicals declared itself a , which in one fell swoop enacted the entire radical program, while the other members of the Assembly were forcibly detained. All provincial sovereignties were repealed; the dissident members of the Assembly expelled; an &quot;interim Executive Directory&quot; empowered; and the constitutional commission reduced to seven radical members.

Though the resulting constitution has sometimes been depicted as a French project, it was actually a result of the constitutional commission&#x27;s discussions between October 1797 and January 1798. Except for the purge of the electoral rolls of &quot;crypto-Orangists&quot; and other reactionaries, it might therefore have been acceptable for the moderates, obviating the need for the January coup. In any case, the &quot;suggestions&quot; of Delacroix were rejected and the constitutional commission insisted on the following three essential points: universal manhood suffrage, without fiscal qualifications. the right of revision of the constitution at quinquennial intervals by the voters; and finally the rejection of the principle of a bicameral legislature, in which each House would have a separate electoral base.

Though the coup of 22 January 1798 did not bode well for a genuinely democratic approval process for the new constitution (and the French would have preferred going the &quot;safe&quot; way of approval by the rump assembly) the plebiscite that started on 17 March (in the usual form of elections in &quot;primary&quot; assemblies of about 100–500 voters) had a reasonably democratic quality. On 23 April 1798, the &quot;Staatsregeling voor het Bataafsche Volk&quot; was approved with 153,913 votes against 11,587 (i.e., just 641 more people voted for approval in 1798 than had voted for rejection of the previous draft in 1797; about 50% of the electorate had voted.) The new regime therefore seemed well-grounded in the new doctrine of popular sovereignty.

The new constitution addressed many of the reformist concerns of the Patriots since 1785, including no hereditary offices; no sinecures; and accountability of officials. It also came down on the side of economic liberalism, as opposed to mercantilism, in the economic debate then raging in republican circles, and therefore promised to do away with guilds and internal impediments to trade. The old provincial-repartition system of public finance was to be replaced by a system of national taxation. There was to be a five-man &quot;Uitvoerend Bewind&quot; as a collective Executive, with eight national &quot;Agenten&quot; (government ministers) doing the actual Administration, directing Foreign Affairs, Police and Interior, Justice, Finance, War, Navy, National Education, and National Economy. Most importantly, as historian Simon Schama states: &quot;[i]ts central aim was to change the nature of the Dutch state and to bind its new institutions into the framework of an electoral democracy.&quot; As such it had an importance that outlasted the Batavian Republic and set up an ideal to emulate for its successor states.

===&quot;Uitvoerend Bewind&quot;===

Giddy with their success, the radicals now pushed further. Their legitimacy was already tenuous, because of the way they had seized power. Now they also lost support in the rump-Assembly because of their partisanship. Not wishing to repeat the mistakes of the French Jacobins they moved against the popular political clubs that formed their political base, thereby alienating their most enthusiastic supporters. On the other hand, at the behest of Delacroix they also moved against &quot;counter-revolutionaries&quot; by having purging commissions removing these men from the electoral rolls, further undermining the legitimacy of the regime, as moderate Patriots were also disenfranchised. The final blow was that the new regime reneged on its promise to elect an entirely new Representative Assembly.

====&quot;Coup d&#x27;état&quot; of the moderates====
Meanwhile, the &quot;22 Floréal&quot; coup in France undermined Delacroix, because it inspired more sympathy by French foreign minister Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord for the Dutch opposition members who demanded the ambassador&#x27;s recall. At the same time, Daendels became disaffected with the regime he had helped put into power because of the depredations of the purging commissions. His French colleague General Barthélemy Catherine Joubert was displeased with the radicals because of conflicts about the co-dominion of Flushing. Finally, the newly appointed &quot;Agenten&quot; were disturbed about the inefficiency of the &quot;Uitvoerend Bewind&quot;. All these disaffections came together with the coup on 12 June 1798, of that recidivist, General Daendels, in which he disturbed a dinner party of Delacroix and three members of the &quot;Uitvoerend Bewind&quot;, violating the diplomatic immunity of the ambassador by putting pistols to his chest. The members of the &quot;Representative Assembly&quot; were arrested in session.

The fall of the Vreede-Fijnje &quot;Bewind&quot; opened the way for the actual implementation of the new constitution. The &quot;Interim Directory&quot; that now came to power (consisting of a few of the dissenting &quot;Agenten&quot;) made haste with organizing elections for the Representative Assembly that convened on 31 July. By the middle of August a new &quot;Uitvoerend Bewind&quot; had been appointed and the &quot;Agenten&quot; who had been behind the coup, resumed their original positions. This new regime now started to implement the policies that their radical predecessors had written into the constitution. The coup of June therefore was not a reactionary revolution, but only brought about a change in personnel. Soon most of the people that were arrested at both the January and June coups were released in the spirit of reconciliation that the new regime advocated. The make-up of the Representative Assembly closely resembled that of the second National Assembly of 1797.

The new regime was soon to discover that changes do not easily come about by legislative fiat. The part of the constitution that worked adequately was the experiment with indirect democracy. During the period in which the constitution was in force, the system of primary assemblies that elected delegates who voted for the respective organs of government worked efficiently, and kept the voters engaged. However, exactly because the Republic was a genuine democracy, other goals of the regime were less easy to attain. The elections often put people into office that were very much opposed to the unitary state that was now enshrined in the constitution, and to other innovations that it entailed, or in any case were of a conservative inclination.

This already applied at the top: the constitution contained an age-requirement for the members of the &quot;Uitvoerend Bewind&quot;, which favored the election of staid Patriot regents, and discriminated against the more talented appointed &quot;Agents&quot;, like Jacobus Spoors, Gerrit Jan Pijman and Alexander Gogel. The tenor of the &quot;Bewind&quot; became more conservative in the ensuing years. The agents went to work energetically, however, and started with an onslaught on the old administrative organization of the country, in a deliberate attempt to liquidate the very identity of the old federal structure. The once mighty province of Holland was carved into three pieces: &quot;Amstel&quot; (Amsterdam and immediate vicinity), &quot;Texel&quot; (the northern peninsula) and &quot;Delf&quot; (the southern part); and the other provinces were often merged in larger entities, like Overijssel and Drente into &quot;Ouden Yssel&quot;, and Frisia and Groningen into the &quot;Eems department&quot;. The aim was to organize the country into units with equal numbers of primary assemblies (hence the small Amstel department with its large population). The first elections for the administrative organs of these new entities were held in March 1799. But, of course, such a reorganization did not suddenly change the old allegiances of the people living in these areas. In any case, the new local and departmental administrations, though elected, were supposed to execute the policies as centrally laid down by the national government. As the elections often put people in power who represented the old order (like Joan Arend de Vos van Steenwijk in Ouden Yssel) this was exceedingly unlikely. To put it differently, the political effort to attain &quot;national unity&quot; through reconciliation of the diverse Patriot factions of all stripes, got in the way of the effort to create an efficient national unitary state, as envisioned by Gogel.

====Public finance reform====
The unitary state was not an end in itself, but a means to higher ends. The republic had been in dire financial straits even before the revolution of 1795. The system of public finance that had been the envy of the world in its Golden Age, enabling it to throw far beyond its weight in world politics up to the Peace of Utrecht in 1713, had become a millstone around its neck. By 1713 the public debt of the County of Holland had reached 310 million guilders; the debt of the Generality was 68 million; and the debts of the smaller provinces, and of the cities came on top of this. The debt service of Holland alone in that year required 14 million guilders, which exceeded its regular tax revenue. Most of this humongous public debt was held by Dutch private citizens, so in a sense it merely engendered an internal money circuit in the Dutch economy. However, it was mostly concentrated in the hands of the &quot;rentier&quot; class, while the debt was serviced by mainly regressive taxes that weighed on the working population. Most importantly, these were taxes levied by the individual provinces, who serviced their own debt, and paid into the Generality coffers according to a repartition schedule last changed in 1616. Attempts to reform this structure during the 18th century were mainly fruitless.

To ameliorate the situation the old Republic maintained a policy of severe austerity during the century, especially economizing on its defense outlays (which in large part explains why its military and political role declined so much). Up to the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War this policy succeeded in bringing down the level of debt, but this war brought a large uptick in the public debt: between 1780 and 1794 the province of Holland alone issued 120 million guilders of new bonds. In 1795, its total debt stood at 455 million guilders. To this should be added the debts of the United East India Company and its sister, the WIC, and the five Dutch Admiralties for a total of about 150 million guilders. The other provinces owed 155 million guilders. The grand total in 1795, at the beginning of the Batavian Republic, came to 760 million guilders; this imposed a debt service of 25 million guilders annually. The indemnity of the Treaty of The Hague immediately added 100 million guilders to this total, and the maintenance of the French army of occupation added about 12 million annually (while the other funding requirements of the republic added another 20 million annually). To fulfill its engagements to the French Republic, Pieter Stadnitski joined a committee at the end of July 1795. On August 3 it was announced that from that date French soldiers would be paid in sound Dutch currency and no one could be obliged to accept French assignats anymore. In 1814 the public debt stood at 1.7 billion guilders.

The average ordinary revenue of the republic at this time amounted to between 28 and 35 million guilders. However, since the outbreak of the war in 1793 the expenditure had been running at between 40 and 55 millions. For the year 1800 the republic had to find 78 million guilders for its expenditures. In other words, the new Agent of Finance, Gogel, was faced with a financial emergency. He needed to generate about 50 million guilders annually in ordinary revenue on a permanent basis urgently. Besides, as the Dutch tax system was heavily skewed toward highly regressive indirect taxes, which inordinately burdened the impoverished population, he wanted to change this to a system that depended more on direct (income and wealth) taxes. Finally, he wanted to do away with the provincial differentiation in the taxation, and construct a nationally standardized system. When he put these reform proposals to the Representative Assembly on 30 September 1799, they met with massive resistance. This led to so much delay in its acceptance that by the time it was to be implemented (in 1801) the re-federalisation of the state by the new &quot;Staatsbewind&quot; regime was already underway. Eventually, Gogel&#x27;s reforms were only implemented under the successor state of the Kingdom of Holland.

These are (important) examples of instances in which the good intentions of the &quot;Uitvoerend Bewind&quot; and its &quot;Agenten&quot; met with the political and economic realities of the times. Other necessary reforms (the abolition of the guilds, the reform of the system of poor relief to mention but a few examples) equally came to nothing. These defeats progressively led to disenchantment of the population with the regime, that already was in an awkward position because it was also brushed with the tar of the depredations of the French &quot;sister republic&quot; that mainly viewed the Batavian Republic as a milk cow, both collectively (in its demands for loans at very low interest rates) and individually (in the demands of French officials for bribes and other extortions).

====Anglo-Russian invasion====
The sagging popularity of the Republic did not escape the attention of the British intelligence services. However, because this intelligence was filtered through the eyes of Orangist agents in the Republic and émigrés in England, it was erroneously interpreted as possible support for an Orangist restoration. This caused the miscalculation that led to the ill-fated Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland in the peninsula of North Holland in 1799.

Though the expedition ended in failure the members of the &quot;Uitvoerend Bewind&quot; became very nervous in the days before the Battle of Bergen. The Agent for Foreign Affairs, Van der Goes who had been in favor of distancing the Republic from the French, chose this inopportune moment to secretly approach the King of Prussia as a mediator, with a scheme in which the Hereditary Prince was to become a kind of constitutional monarch in a constitution on the model of the American Constitution. The Republic would revert to its traditional neutrality, while Britain would occupy North Holland, and France Zeeland. The overture was rejected, and it caused a lot of embarrassment in the relations with the French Directory. At this time Napoleon Bonaparte performed his coup of 18 Brumaire, establishing the French Consulate. The Franco-Batavian relations now entered a whole new era.

===Staatsbewind and the Peace of Amiens===
====Pressure for constitutional reform====
Though Napoleon had a warlike reputation, his policies in his first years as First Consul were aimed at restoring peace in Europe, albeit at terms favorable to France. The animus of the members of the Second Coalition was mostly against the French Revolution, its ideas and its consequences. By this time Napoleon himself was convinced of their perfidy. Talleyrand and Napoleon therefore saw a possibility of a compromise, in which France would retain its chain of docile client states, but with the &quot;revolutionary&quot; sting removed, to appease the Allies. That unrevolutionary docility was to be assured by constitutions designed to eliminate not only domestic conflict (as was the new French political order), but also any flashes of impertinent nationalism. France therefore embarked on a program of constitutional reform in the dependent republics, first in the Helvetic Republic, where Napoleon as Mediator imposed the Constitution of Malmaison in 1801 (followed by the Second Helvetic Constitution a year later), restoring the old confederal order.

A similar &quot;solution&quot; seemed appropriate for the Batavian Republic. The Batavian government, and its constitution, were particularly disliked by the Consul (no friend of democracy in any case), because of the snub that Amsterdam bankers gave in 1800 to his request for a big loan at the usual generous rate of interest the French expected as a matter of right. He blamed the &quot;Uitvoerend Bewind&quot; for this, and many other foibles, like undermining the boycott of British goods. To remedy these ills, a new Batavian constitution on the political principles of the Consulate (union, authority, political office for men of ability and social station) was needed. The new French ambassador Charles Louis Huguet, marquis de Sémonville he sent to The Hague in 1799 was just the man for this job.

Meanwhile, even the minds of reformers like Gogel had become receptive to the need for change. The frustrations of the stalemate between unitarist reformers and democratically elected federalist obstructionists had caused a certain disillusionment with democratic politics in the former (the latter were already convinced). An alliance was therefore forming between the would-be reformers, who would like to finally push their reforms through, by &quot;Bonapartist&quot; means, if necessary, and the people who wished to restore the old federal order, in the hands of the old regent class. Director Besier in particular was amenable to a project that would extend executive power (and curtail that of the Assembly), and revert the constitution to federal devolution. With the help of Sémonville he now started to push a project of constitutional reform that followed the French Constitution of the Year VIII in important respects: a bicameral legislature would be appointed by a &quot;National College&quot; (akin to the French Sénat conservateur) from a list of names produced by a convoluted system of national elections. This met with little enthusiasm by two of the other Directors François Ermerins and Jean Henri van Swinden, and by the Representative Assembly, that rejected the project on 11 June 1801, by fifty votes to twelve.

====Augereau-coup====
The majority in the &quot;Uitvoerend Bewind&quot; (Gerrit Pijman in particular) therefore amended the project in a sense that gave re-federalization even more emphasis. They unilaterally convened the primary assemblies by a proclamation on 14 September 1801, have a referendum on this new draft constitution. The Assembly defiantly ruled this proclamation illegal on 18 September. Then General Augereau (he of the Fructidor-coup), now commander-in-chief of the French forces in the Netherlands, routinely closed the doors of the Assembly (by previous arrangement with Pijman) on 19 September, and arrested the dissident Directors. Despite this military putsch the campaign for the plebiscite took place in an atmosphere of political freedom unthinkable in France. Nevertheless, this did not result in great enthusiasm for the new constitution. When the votes were counted on 1 October, out of 416,619 voters only 16,771 voted in favor and 52,219 against. The Directors then used a sleight of hand that unfortunately would also become familiar in the Dutch constitutional politics of the successor states: they counted the 350,000 abstentions as &quot;tacit affirmations&quot;.

Unlike the coup of June 1798, the Augereau coup did present a sharp break with the recent past. The new constitution reduced the role of the legislative branch (which now did not have the right of initiative), and expanded the powers of the Executive, which now became known as the &quot;Staatsbewind&quot; (Regency of State). The elective principle was reduced to a formality: the &quot;Staatsbewind&quot;, originally consisting of the three directors taking part in the coup, expanded its membership by co-optation to twelve. This executive then appointed the first 35 members of the legislature. As vacancies arose, these were filled, as far as possible, on a provincial rota and according to national quotas of representatives of each province (much like the old States-General). Except for Holland, the old provinces were reconstituted. The local and provincial administrative organs continued to be elected – no longer by universal manhood suffrage, but by a system of census suffrage.

Most important was the change in personnel of these organs, mostly as a consequence of this electoral change. The &quot;democrats&quot; were mostly replaced by Patriot regents, who had no patience with democracy, and by the old Orangist regents, who did not even have to disguise their allegiance as in early 1801 a convenient amnesty was proclaimed. One surprising example is Egbert Sjuck Gerrold Juckema van Burmania Rengers, the Orangist burgomaster of Leeuwarden before 1795, a notorious reactionary.

The coup represented a counter-revolution. This became clear in the way the iconography of the 1795 revolution disappeared: the epigraph &quot;Vrijheid, Gelijkheid, Broederschap&quot; (Liberty, Equality, Fraternity) which had adorned all official publications, was henceforth removed, and the last Liberty Trees were removed from the town squares. Soon the old ways were restored. For example, though the abolition of the guilds formally remained, in practice regulation of crafts and trades was reimposed by local ordinances.

====Peace negotiations====
Against this background the negotiations for the Treaty of Amiens started in October 1801. The minor participants in the negotiations between Great Britain and France (the Batavian Republic and Spain) were immediately presented with faits accomplis: the preliminary agreement ceded Ceylon, and guaranteed free British shipping to the Cape of Good Hope, without the Dutch even being consulted. The Dutch ambassador in France, Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck, who acted as the Dutch plenipotentiary, vainly protested that the Treaty of The Hague had guaranteed the Dutch colonies, and that France had promised not to make a separate peace. After this separate peace had been concluded, the British were left to negotiate with the minor French allies separately. This did not mean that the Dutch were completely left to their own devices: whenever French interests seemed to be in danger, France decisively intervened on its own behalf, as in the attempt to deduct the value of the Dutch fleet, surrendered in 1799, that the British had purchased from the Stadtholder, from the indemnification of the Prince of Orange.

That indemnification was an important sideshow in the negotiations. The consequence of the peace treaty was that the Batavian Republic now received international recognition, even by the British, and that the old Dutch Republic was now irreversibly dead. This put an end to all pretensions of the Stadtholder and his heirs, such as they were. It may be important to note that these pretensions were dubious to begin with. The Stadtholder was never the sovereign power in the Netherlands, despite understandable misconceptions by foreigners, who may have thought that a country needed a head of state, and the Stadtholder was it. Instead he was an officeholder, appointed by the provincial States, who also was captain-general and admiral-general of the Union (there was originally no stadtholder on the confederal level).

In the Orangist revolution of 1747 this office had been revamped to &quot;Stadhouder-generaal&quot; and made hereditary, and after the Prussian intervention of 1787 the powers of the Stadtholder had become dictatorial. But formally the States General had been sovereign since 1588, and the Stadtholder was merely their &quot;first servant&quot;. The British may have entertained certain fantasies about his formal status, but never seriously considered it. An example of this would the British acceptance of the surrender of the Batavian fleet in the name of the Stadtholder in 1799, as though he was a sovereign prince. But this was all make-believe, and it ended with the peace of 1802 (though it was revived in 1813).

The Prince had reason to feel aggrieved by this. He did have large patrimonial estates in the Netherlands that now were forfeit. Besides, the loss of his hereditary offices entailed a loss of income. According to his own calculations the arrears in all these incomes since 1795 amounted to 4 million guilders. The &quot;Staatsbewind&quot; refused to pay this, or any sum, point blank, and the peace treaty specifically exempted the Dutch from paying anything. Instead, an arrangement between the French, British and Prussians (the former stadtholder&#x27;s champions) in the matter was reached that in return for dropping any and all claims William was to be compensated with the abbatial domains of Fulda and Corvey Abbey (see also Principality of Nassau-Orange-Fulda).

====Short interlude of peace====
The Treaty restored most of the colonies that had been captured by the British since 1795, except Ceylon, but including the Cape Colony. This now made the attempts in the Asiatic Council, which had replaced the Directorate of the VOC in 1799, to reform the management of the colonies, more urgent. Dirk van Hogendorp was commissioned to write a proposal, that met with considerable enthusiasm from the more progressive elements on the council, like Samuel Iperusz. Wiselius and J.H.Neethling. He proposed to abolish all perquisites and sinecures; to permit private trade; to permit native subjects to own private property; to substitute the &quot;land levies&quot; by a regulated land tax; and the abolition of all seigneurial rights in the colonies. This met with overwhelming resistance from vested interests. When a new Charter for the colonies was promulgated, Hogendorp&#x27;s proposals had been whittled down to insignificance. The vestigial democrats on the Council were now purged in favor of Orangist reactionaries like Hendrik Mollerus, and Hendrik Van Stralen. In any case, the Republic did not enjoy the possession of its colonies for long. After the resumption of hostilities in 1803 the returned colonies in most cases were soon recaptured by the British. Java, however, remained Dutch until 1811.

Another potentially important consequence of the peace might have been that a number of provisions of the Treaty of The Hague, that had been conditional on a peace, like the reduction of the French army of occupation, would now have become operational. However, the First Consul proved reluctant to reduce the numbers of French troops, or return the port of Flushing, for the good of the Dutch as he pointed out, as they needed many of their own troops in their restored colonies, so the &quot;protection&quot; of the French troops was considered necessary. On the other hand, the departure of the French troops was an indispensable point for the British as they could not allow the Netherlands to be dominated by a hostile power, and the Batavian Republic was incapable of defending its own neutrality. This was to be an insoluble dilemma in the coming years.

Real advantages of the peace came in the economic field. As an open economy, the Republic needed unhindered trade. It was heavily dependent on exports of agricultural products to the British markets, and on its services sector (especially its large merchant fleet, and the banking sector), whereas its industry (whatever remained of it after a century of being confronted by foreign protectionism) also was dependent on exports. All these sectors had suffered enormously from the war: the British blockade and French and British privateering had almost brought marine trade to a standstill, whereas a commercial treaty with France (which would have ended French discrimination of Dutch trade in industrial goods) proved an ever-receding fata morgana. True, much of the trade had shifted to flags of convenience (especially that of the US and European neutrals like Prussia), but the peace made the resurgence of the Dutch carrying trade fully practicable. Nevertheless, some changes proved irreversible, like the shift of trade patterns to German ports, and the decline of the fisheries.

====Invasion preparations and economic warfare====

The peace turned out to be of short duration. On 18 May 1803, slightly more than a year after the peace, war resumed. Napoleon was now intent on the destruction of Great Britain by culminating in an ambitious planned invasion. The French expected the Batavian Republic to play a major supporting role in this. As the Franco-Batavian alliance&#x27;s embodiment, the &quot;Staatsbewind&quot; was forced to assent to a Convention bringing the total of French and Batavian forces in the Netherlands to 35,000. In addition, 9,000 Batavian troops were slated for the proposed overseas expedition. Even more importantly, the Dutch were to supply five ships-of-the-line, five frigates, 100 gunboats, and 250 flat-bottomed transport craft, capable of holding 60–80 men by December 1803. In total the Dutch were meant to provide transport for 25,000 men and 2,500 horses, the major part of Napoleon&#x27;s invasion armada, and all at Dutch expense. Napoleon&#x27;s imposed real burdens on the finances of the Republic and on its economy.

Another real burden was the economic warfare that Napoleon launched against the British, which was answered by a British counter-boycott. This foreshadowed the Continental System which was written into law in 1806. However already in 1803 it started to choke off Dutch trade. Ostensibly, the &quot;Staatsbewind&quot; did its part by prohibiting the import of all goods from the enemy on 5 July 1803. Later it banned cheese exports and butter. These measures were of little practical effect, since in 1804 the volume of general exports to Britain was nearly equal to that in the last year of peace in 1802. British goods reached Dutch destinations via neutral German ports or disguised as &quot;American cargo&quot;. The republic was therefore an important &quot;keyhole into Europe&quot; that undermined the French economic sanctions against Britain. Since the members of the &quot;Staatsbewind&quot;, and their friends, often profited from this clandestine trade directly, the patience of the French was wearing thin. Matters came to a head when the French commander in the Republic, Auguste de Marmont, ordered in November 1804 that French naval patrols and customs officials were to take over the responsibility for the surveillance of cargoes in Dutch ports, with powers of confiscation without reference to Dutch authorities. The&quot;Staatsbewind&quot; forbade any Batavian official to take orders from the French on 23 November 1804.

===Last Grand Pensionary and end of the Republic===
This act of defiance sealed the fate of yet another of the Batavian regimes. Napoleon had long been dissatisfied with what he viewed as the foot-dragging and inefficiency of the Dutch. As a matter of fact, since the Spring of 1804 informal talks, mediated by Talleyrand, had been under way with the Batavian envoy in Paris, Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck, who had a good personal rapport with Napoleon (by now emperor). Schimmelpenninck was a power in the Batavian Republic by himself. He had played an important role as the leader of the federalist opposition in the &quot;revolutionary&quot; States-General of 1795, and the first Assembly. Though an opponent of the radicals, he had politically survived the coups of 1798, and served as ambassador to France, and as plenipotentiary to the Amiens negotiations. Now Napoleon saw him as the person to clean the Augean stables of the Dutch client state.

Schimmelpenninck saw himself in the same light. He had long had a woolly vision of a &quot;national conciliation&quot; in the Netherlands, that made him amenable to a rapprochement with conservative and Orangist circles. These were to become his power base. Though Schimmelpenninck was a convinced federalist, he was a pliable character also. When Napoleon indicated that he preferred a centralized organization of the Dutch state (as the re-federalized model of the &quot;Staatsbewind&quot; had clearly not worked out), he did not hesitate to implement this in his project of a new constitution, that he constructed in the Summer of 1804 in consultation with the &quot;Staatsbewind&quot;. As a matter of fact, a delegation of the &quot;Staatsbewind&quot;, consisting of Schimmelpenninck, and members of the Regency Van der Goes (the former agent) and Van Haersolte (a former director), presented the case for this draft to Napoleon in November 1804. When the clash about the French customs men therefore took place later in the month, Napoleon came to a speedy decision and soon thereafter the Batavian Republic had a new constitution and government.

On 10 May 1805, Schimmelpenninck was therefore inaugurated as &quot;Raadpensionaris&quot; (Grand Pensionary) of the Batavian Republic. This venerable title (clearly chosen for sentimental reasons) had little connection with the former office of the States of Holland; as a matter of fact, the new office more resembled that of Stadtholder, though even William V, after 1787, had not possessed the powers Schimmelpenninck was to wield. His was a one-man Executive that would in no way be encumbered by the 19 man Legislative Corps, that had no powers apart from the Pensionary. The Pensionary conducted his business assisted by a &quot;Staatsraad&quot;, that resembled the French Conseil d&#x27;État more than the old &quot;Raad van State&quot;, and by Secretaries of State, who resembled the &quot;Agenten&quot; of the &quot;Uitvoerend Bewind&quot;. Of course, such an important change in the constitution had to receive the imprimatur of the popular will. A plebiscite was duly organized which elicited 14,903 Yes-votes (against 136 Noes) from an electorate of 353,322. The abstentions were counted as &quot;tacit affirmatives&quot; in the now well-established tradition.

Despite such unpromisingly reactionary trappings the Schimmelpenninck regime actually accomplished more in its short existence than the previous regimes had accomplished in the ten years since 1795. This was, of course, mainly due to the diligent preparatory work that Agents like the ubiquitous Gogel; Johannes Goldberg, for National Economy; and Johannes van der Palm, for National Education; had done.
Gogel&#x27;s General Taxation Plan was finally enacted in June 1805; a first government-approved attempt at unification of the Dutch spelling was made; an embryonic Department of Agriculture and Department of Hydraulics were formed, to foreshadow the later government departments; even a &quot;Pharmacopeia Batavia&quot; started the regulation of drugs; and the School Law of 1806 organized a national system of public elementary education. Most importantly perhaps, the local-government law of July 1805 founded the first Dutch system of public administration.
The French reaction to this flurry of reforms was mixed, however. The very zeal of the program might betoken a renascent nationalism that could work against French interests. The planned invasion of England was cancelled due to a lack of naval superiority, which was only reinforced by the debacle of the Battle of Trafalgar. The Dutch now began to clamor for economies in the form of the return of the Boulogne flotilla, which annoyed Napoleon, because he still had a use for it. The man who had led that flotilla to Boulogne, after repelling a superior British fleet, Carel Hendrik Ver Huell, was now Secretary for the Navy. He had also become a confidant of the emperor, and now engaged in a secret correspondence with Talleyrand and Napoleon. The latter had just concluded the Peace of Pressburg and was busy dividing up Europe in client-kingdoms apportioned to his relatives. He saw a good candidate for such a position in the Netherlands in his brother Louis Bonaparte.

Ver Huell started scheming with his French patrons behind the back of Schimmelpenninck and feeding negative information about the Pensionary that found its way into the French press. Schimmelpenninck&#x27;s position was weakened by the fact that he was slowly going blind. The Dutch Secretaries of State and the &quot;Staatsraad&quot; did not have much choice: their only options were a complete extinguishing of the national identity in the form of annexation to the Empire, or the lesser evil of a new kingdom under one of Napoleon&#x27;s relatives. A &quot;Groot Besogne&quot; (Grand Commission) was formed to conduct the unequal negotiations with the Emperor. The latter, however, refused to speak with the Commission, and only communicated to them through the intermediary of Ver Huell. Talleyrand had meanwhile drafted a &quot;Treaty&quot; which contained the conditions under which the crown of &quot;Holland&quot; was to be offered to Louis: no union of the crowns; no conscription; a possible commercial treaty with France; and the basic freedoms of the Netherlands (linguistic, religious, judicial) were to be maintained; while the civil list was fixed at the &quot;modest sum&quot; of 1.5 million guilders. The constitution of the Pensionary was actually to be maintained with a few minor alterations (the title of &quot;raadpensionaris&quot; changed to that of King; and the size of the &quot;Staatsraad&quot; and the legislative corps nearly doubled).

The Commission was not allowed to refer back to The Hague. Schimmelpenninck made a last-ditch attempt to have the treaty referred to a plebiscite, but he was ignored. He resigned on 4 June 1806. The next day at the Château de Saint-Cloud, after Napoleon had kept them waiting while he received the Turkish ambassador, the hapless commissioners presented their &quot;petition&quot; to Louis to accept the crown of &quot;Holland&quot;, which he graciously did, while Napoleon looked on approvingly.

==Aftermath==

The Kingdom of Holland lasted only four years. Though Louis performed his role beyond all expectations, and did his best to defend the interests of his subjects, for precisely this reason Napoleon decided that the Netherlands could no longer be denied the benefits of reunion with his Empire, over the objections of Louis. Louis abdicated on 2 July 1810, in favor of his son Napoleon Louis Bonaparte, who reigned for ten days, before the kingdom was finally reunited with the origins of the &quot;alluvial deposits of the French rivers&quot;, in the words of Napoleon.

This reunion did not outlast the effects of the disastrous French invasion of Russia and subsequent defeat in the Battle of Leipzig. The Empire melted away, and the independent Netherlands took shape again with every city that the retreating French army of occupation evacuated in the course of 1813.
In the ensuing political vacuum a triumvirate of former Orangist regents, led by Gijsbert Karel van Hogendorp, invited the former Hereditary Prince (the old Stadtholder had died in 1806) to assume power as &quot;Sovereign Prince&quot;. William VI of Orange landed in Scheveningen on 30 November 1813. He duly established control in the Netherlands and was offered the crown of the combined area of the former 17 provinces of the Netherlands (modern Belgium and the Netherlands) by the Allies in the secret London Protocol (also known as the Eight Articles of London) of 21 June 1814, which he accepted exactly one month later. On 16 March 1815, the United Kingdom of the Netherlands was proclaimed.

===Historiographical note===

According to the British historian Simon Schama, the Batavian Republic has been controversially treated by historians. After the end of the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands during World War II, some historians saw a parallel between the Dutch National Socialist Movement (NSB) and the Patriot revolutionaries, while they pictured William V in the heroic role of Queen Wilhelmina and her government-in-exile. However, Dutch historian Pieter Geyl opposed such comparisons in his &quot;Patriotten en NSBers: een historische parallel&quot; (1946).

Still, by that time the Batavians had already had a bad press in Dutch history writing. This may be explained by the fact that the old ideological struggle between the monarchically-oriented Orangist party and its successive opponents of a more &quot;republican&quot; bent (going back to at least the conflict between Johan van Oldenbarnevelt and Prince Maurice), of which the Patriots were only the latest incarnation, was being refought in the standard works of 19th-century Dutch historians like Guillaume Groen van Prinsterer, who saw plenty to despise in the &quot;popular-sovereignty&quot; philosophy of the Patriot radicals. In his turn Groen was very influential on the way John Lothrop Motley depicted the old Dutch Republic for an American audience.

Motley did not get to deal explicitly with the Batavian Republic, but the way his collaborator William Elliot Griffis dismissed the Patriots speaks for itself: &quot;…whether under the name of the &#x27;Batavian Republic&#x27;, the Kingdom of Holland, or the provinces of the French empire, the French occupation was virtually a French conquest that had little permanent influence on Dutch history or character.&quot;

However most, if not all, characteristics of the current centralized state of the Kingdom of the Netherlands were foreshadowed by the accomplishments of the Batavian Republic, not least the liberal 1848 Constitution. That constitution restored the central tenets of the democratic &quot;Staatsregeling&quot; of 1798, under the guise of a Constitutional monarchy, as its author Johan Rudolph Thorbecke acknowledged.

<doc id="51171" wikidata="Q2543244" url="?curid=51171" title="Education in Australia">
<text>Education in Australia encompasses the sectors of early childhood education (preschool) and primary education (primary schools), followed by secondary education (high schools), and finally tertiary education, which includes higher education (universities and other higher education providers) and vocational education (registered training organisations). Regulation and funding of education is primarily the responsibility of the States and territories; however, the Australian Government also contributes to funding.

Education in Australia is compulsory between the ages of four, five, or six and fifteen, sixteen or seventeen, depending on the state or territory and the date of birth.

For primary and secondary education, government schools educate approximately 64 per cent of Australian students, with approximately 36 per cent in non-government schools. At the tertiary level, the majority of Australia&#x27;s universities are public, and student fees are subsidised through a student loan program where payment becomes due when debtors reach a certain income level, known as HECS.
Underpinned by the Australian Qualifications Framework, implemented in 1995, Australia has adopted a national system of qualifications, encompassing higher education, vocational education and training (VET), and school-based education. For primary and secondary schools, a national Australian Curriculum has been progressively developed and implemented since 2010.

Australia is a leading global provider of education to international students, and in 2012 was ranked as the third-largest provider of international education after the United States and the United Kingdom. Australia has the highest ratio of international students per head of population in the world by a large margin, with 812,000 international students enrolled in the nation&#x27;s universities and vocational institutions in 2019.

In the 2018 PISA study by the OCED Australian students placed 16th in the world in reading, 29th in maths and 17th in science. This continues a sharp decline in educational standards.

However, the Education Index, published with the UN&#x27;s Human Development Index in 2018, based on data from 2017, listed Australia as 0.929, the second-highest in the world.

== Regulation and funding ==
The regulation, operation, and funding of education is the responsibility of the states and territories, because the Australian Government does not have a specific constitutional power to pass laws with concerning education. However, the federal government helps to fund non-government schools, helps to fund public universities, and subsidises tertiary education through a national student loan scheme, and regulates vocational education providers. 

In 2024–25, the Australian Government invested A$53 billion (7.2% of its federal budget) in education. 96.3% of gross income for government schools was government funds in 2022, as was 76.4% for Catholic schools and 48.7% for independent schools.

Post-compulsory education is regulated within the Australian Qualifications Framework, a unified system of national qualifications in schools, vocational education and training, and the tertiary education sector.

The Australian Government&#x27;s involvement in education has been the responsibility of several departments over the years, with the Department of Education, Skills and Employment being formed in 2020.

The academic year in Australia varies between States and institutions; however, it generally runs from late January/early February until early/mid-December for primary and secondary schools and TAFE colleges, with slight variations in the inter-term holidays, and from late February until mid-November for universities, with seasonal holidays and breaks for each educational institute.

==Preschool==
Government provision in Australia during the years before children start school is a relatively recent innovation. Historically, preschool and pre-prep programs in Australia were relatively unregulated, and children were cared for in informal ways by baby-sitters and by members of their families and close associates. While still not mandatory for children to attend, the Federal Government has had a focus since 2009 on encouraging families to enrol their children (from around 4 years of age) in a preschool or kindergarten that delivers quality early childhood education and care. Federal and state legislation requires preschool services to implement and deliver programming based on the nationally approved Early Years Learning Framework, implemented from 2009. The first exposure many Australian children have to learn with others outside of traditional parenting is daycare or a parent-run playgroup. This sort of activity is not generally considered schooling, as preschool education is separate from primary school in all states and territories except Western Australia—where pre-school education is taught as part of the primary school system—and Victoria, where the state framework, the Victorian Early Years Learning and Development Framework (VEYLDF) covers children from birth to eight years old, is used by some schools over the national framework. In Queensland, preschool programs are often called Kindergarten or Pre-Prep and are usually privately run but attract state government funding if run for at least 600 hours a year and delivered by a registered teacher.

Preschools are usually run by the state and territory governments, except in Victoria, South Australia and New South Wales where they are more often run by local councils, community groups or private organisations. Preschool is offered for children ages three to five; attendance numbers vary widely between the states, but 85.7% of children attended preschool the year before school, the main year of preschool attendance. This year is far more commonly attended and may take the form of a few hours of activity during weekdays. Most states of Australia now fund government preschools to offer 15 hours per week (600 hours over a year) for each enrolled child in the year before they commence formal schooling

== Primary and secondary education ==

In 2023, 4,086,998 students were enrolled in 9,629 primary, secondary and special schools in Australia. As of 2023, government schools educated 64% of all students, while Catholic schools (19.7%) and independent schools (16.3%) educated the rest. In 2023, there were just under 311,655 full-time equivalent (FTE) teaching staff in Australian primary and secondary schools. The major part of government-run schools&#x27; costs is met by the relevant state or territory government. The Australian Government provides the majority of public funding for non-government schools, which is supplemented by states and territories.

Non-government schools, both religious or secular typically charge compulsory tuition and other fees. Government schools provide education without compulsory tuition fees, although many government schools ask for payment of &#x27;voluntary&#x27; fees to defray particular expenses.

Regardless of whether a school is government or non-government, it is regulated by the same curriculum standards framework. The framework is administered by the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority. Most schools require students to wear prescribed school uniforms. A school year in Australia typically starts in January/February and finishes in December.

=== Compulsory attendance requirements ===
School education in Australia is compulsory between certain ages as specified by state or territory legislation. Depending on the state or territory, and date of birth of the child, school is compulsory from the age of five to six to the age of fifteen to seventeen.

In the ACT, NSW, the Northern Territory, Queensland, South Australia, Victoria, and Western Australia, children are legally required to attend school from the age of six years old, until the minimum leaving age. In Tasmania, the compulsory school starting age is 5 years old. However, most children commence the preliminary year of formal schooling, in Pre-Year 1, between four and a half and five and a half years of age, variously called kindergarten (sometimes called Year K), reception, preparation (also abbreviated as &quot;prep&quot;), transition, or foundation.

, the national year 10 to year 12 apparent retention rate (ARR), a measure of student engagement that provides an indicator of the success of education systems in keeping students in school beyond the minimum leaving age, was 79.9 per cent for all full-time students in Year 12.

=== Australian Curriculum ===

While state and territory governments are responsible for the regulation and delivery of school-based education within their jurisdiction, through the Council of Australian Governments, the Commonwealth Government has, since 2014, played an increasing role in the establishment of the Australian Curriculum that sets the expectations for what all young Australians should be taught, regardless of where they live in Australia or their background. The development of the Australian Curriculum is based on the principles of improving the quality, equity and transparency of Australia&#x27;s education system. The Australian Curriculum, for pre-Year 1 to Year 9, is made up of the following eight learning areas: English; Mathematics; Science; Humanities and Social Sciences; The Arts; Technologies; Health and Physical Education as well as Languages. In the senior secondary Australian Curriculum, for Year 10, Year 11 and Year 12, fifteen senior secondary subjects across English, Mathematics, Science, History and Geography were endorsed between 2012 and 2013. The Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority has mandated the achievement standards that describe the quality of learning (including the depth of understanding, the extent of knowledge, and the sophistication of skill) expected of students who have studied the content for each subject.

=== Types of schools ===
The types of schools in Australia fall broadly into two categories: government schools, being those schools operated by state or territory departments or agencies; and non-government schools, being those schools that are not operated by government departments or agencies. Non-government schools can be further classified, based on self-identification of the school&#x27;s affiliation. Non-government schools are grouped for reporting as Catholic schools (including Catholic-affiliated private schools) or private (other non-government schools).

Government schools receive funding from the relevant state or territory government. Non-government schools receive funding from the Australian Government and relevant state or territory government; and in most cases, parents are required to make a co-payment for their child&#x27;s education.

 across primary and secondary education, approximately two-thirds of all school students attended government schools; with the remaining one-third of students educated in non-government schools.

A small portion of students are legally home-schooled, particularly in rural areas. Part of these students supplement their education with the School of the Air, an Australian government education programme to provide access to primary and secondary education for children in remote areas. Beginning in 1951 this programme initially operated through radio broadcasts, however telephone classes teaching replaced these broadcasts in 2005. From 2007 to 2009, online classes and resources were rolled out and became the primary method of learning

=== Scholar performance ===
According to the 2022 PISA evaluations, Australian 15-year-olds ranked ninth in the OECD for reading and science and tenth for maths. However, less than 60% of Australian students achieved the National Proficiency Standard – 51% in maths, 58% in science and 57% in reading.

== School years ==
=== Primary schools ===

Also sometimes called infants schools, Australia adopts the UNESCO term of primary school that generally covers a child&#x27;s education from pre–Year 1 and finishes with Year 6. The duration of primary school years varies across each Australian state and territory, with most adopting seven years- except in South Australia, where, until 2022, students finished with Year 7, making the duration of primary school eight years- until they are 11, 12 or 13 years of age. Primary schools focus on developing essential literacy, numeracy and social skills, and provide foundational knowledge to children about the world around them.

=== Secondary schools ===

Secondary schools in Australia are also called high schools and colleges (or junior, intermediate, or senior colleges). Secondary schools vary across each Australian state and territory, but they generally cover Year 7 to Year 9 (compulsory period of education) and senior secondary schools continue to Year 12. Progressively, as students move from primary into secondary schools, subject matter becomes increasingly specialised, offering opportunities to students that show preferences in STEM, or in Humanities and Social Sciences, among other interests.

=== Middle schools ===

In the majority of Australian states and territories, middle schools are relatively uncommon. Students progress from primary school to secondary school. As an alternative to the middle school model, some secondary schools divided their grades into &quot;junior high school&quot; (Years 7, 8 and 9) and &quot;senior high school&quot; (Years 10, 11 and 12). Some have three levels, &quot;junior&quot; (Years 7 and 8), &quot;intermediate&quot; (Years 9 and 10), and &quot;senior&quot; (Years 11 and 12).

In June 2006 the Northern Territory Government introduced a three-tier system featuring middle schools for Year 7 to Year 9 (approximate age 12–15) and high school for Year 10 to Year 12 (approximate age 15–18).

=== Combined and central schools ===

In Australia, combined schools, also known as K-12 schools, are schools that have classes from both primary and secondary year levels. These schools may be located in an urban, regional or rural area and can be government or non-government schools. there were approximately 500 Australian combined government schools and approximately 850 Australian combined non-government schools.

In Western Australia, the term &quot;district high school&quot; is used to describe a school that educates students from pre-prep to year 10.

In New South Wales, Central schools are predominantly, government schools located in a rural area that provides both primary and lower secondary education to students, usually concluding at Year 10. These provide secondary education to students from multiple primary schools, in rural areas with too low of a population to support a secondary school. As of 2024 there were 58 central schools.

== Organisational structures ==
Schools are broadly categorised into government and non-government schools. The non-government schools are further categorised into Catholic schools and private schools. , 65.7% of students were enrolled in government schools, 19.7% in catholic schools and 14.6% in private schools.

=== Government schools ===

Also called state schools or public schools, government schools educate approximately two-thirds of all school students in Australia. If a student elects to attend a government school, they are required to attend a school within their local school district unless the student has dispensation to attend another school, usually approved based on academic merit, specialisation, or other reasons, such as a student disability.

Government schools are run by the respective state government agency. They offer free education; however, many government schools ask parents to pay a contribution fee and a materials and services charge for stationery, textbooks, sports, uniforms, school camps and other schooling costs that are not covered under government funding. In 2010 the additional cost for schooling was estimated to be on average $316 per year per child.

Government schools may be further categorised into open or comprehensive schools, selective, special, and specialist schools; all defined below. In 2009 the Western Australia government introduced Independent Public Schools to describe a government school that, while a part of the state education system, was granted a higher degree of decision-making authority than a regular government school. A similar reform was introduced in Queensland and, as of December 2018, 250 government schools commenced as independent public schools in Queensland. In February 2014 the then Federal Education Minister, Christopher Pyne, announced a $70 million Independent Public Schools Initiative to support 1,500 Australian government schools to become more autonomous.

Government hospital schools are located at some major hospitals and provide access to tuition for students who have extended stays in hospitals.

Across Australia, the Federal Department of Education sets the overall national policy and direction for education in Australia. The following state and territory government departments are responsible for the administration of education within their respective jurisdictions:

=== Non-government schools ===
Schools from the non-government sector operate under the authority of state or territory governments but are not operated by government education departments. Schools from the non-government sector may operate as individual schools, in small groups or as a system such as those coordinated by the Catholic Education Commission in each state and territory. All non-government schools in Australia receive funding from the Commonwealth government.

==== Catholic schools ====

The education system delivered by the Roman Catholic Church in Australia began in 1820 and has grown to be the second-biggest provider of school-based education in Australia. , one in five Australian students attended Catholic schools. There are over 1,700 Catholic schools in Australia with more than 750,000 students enrolled, employing almost 60,000 teachers.

Administrative oversight of Catholic education providers varies depending on the origins, ethos, and purpose of each education provider. Oversight of Catholic &quot;systemic&quot; schools may rest with a Catholic parish, diocese, or archdiocese; while religious institutes have oversight of Catholic &quot;independent&quot; schools.

The National Catholic Education Commission (NCEC), established by the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference through the Bishops Commission for Catholic Education, is tasked with maintaining liaison with the federal government and other key national education bodies and complements and supports the work of the state and territory Catholic education commissions. While some Catholic schools operate independently via religious institutes, the majority of Catholic schools, called &quot;systemic schools&quot;, operate under the Canon Law jurisdiction of an ecclesiastical public juridic person, such as a bishop. In practice, the bishop assigns a Catholic Education Office (CEO), Catholic Education Commission, Catholic Schools Offices, or a similar body with daily operational responsibility for the leadership, efficient operation, and management of the Catholic systemic schools which educate in parish primary and regional secondary schools in Australia. These diocesan bodies are charged with the implementation and management of the policies of the diocese and the allocation and administration of the funds provided by the government and private sources to Catholic systemic schools, as well as the financial responsibilities for the administration of salaries for staff members.

Most Catholic schools (96 per cent) are &quot;systemically&quot; funded, meaning that the government funding they nominally attract is provided to the relevant state Catholic Education Commission for needs-based distribution. Sixty-one Australian Catholic schools are non-systemically funded (&quot;independent&quot; schools) and receive government grants directly.

==== Private schools ====

Private schools are non-government schools that are not operated by government authority and have a system of governance that ensures their independent operation. Such schools are typically operated by an independently elected school council or board of governors and range broadly in the type of school education provided and the socio-economics of the school community served. Some private schools are run by religious institutes; others have no religious affiliation and are driven by a national philosophy (such as international schools), pedagogical philosophy (such as Waldorf-Steiner schools), or specific needs (such as special schools). , including private schools run by Catholic religious institutes, of the 9,477 schools in Australia 1,140 schools (12 per cent) are in the private sector. In the same year, private schools enrolled over 617,000 students or 16 per cent of the Australian student population.

Private school fees can vary from under $100 per month to $3,200, depending on the student&#x27;s year level, the school&#x27;s size, and the socioeconomics of the school community. In late 2018 it was reported that the most expensive private schools (such as the APS Schools, the AGSV Schools in Melbourne, the GPS Schools, QGSSSA Schools in Brisbane and the NSW GPS Schools, Combined Associated Schools and the ISA Schools in Sydney and New South Wales) charge fees of up to $500,000 for the thirteen years of private school education.

Australian private schools broadly fall into the following categories:

== Specialist organisational structures ==
=== Special schools ===

A special school is a school catering for students who have special educational needs due to learning difficulties, physical disabilities, developmental disabilities or social/emotional disturbance, or who are in custody, on remand or in hospital. Special schools may be specifically designed, staffed and resourced to provide appropriate special education for children with additional needs. Students attending special schools generally do not attend any classes in mainstream schools. The schools cater for students with mild, moderate and profound intellectual disabilities, deaf and hard of hearing students, students with Autism and students with a physical disability. Class sizes at specialist schools are smaller than at mainstream schools, and there is a much lower ratio of teaching and support staff to students. Some specialist schools also have therapists on staff. Specialist schools generally already have an accessible environment and curriculum for their student population; this may mean that there are limited subjects on offer.

=== Selective schools ===

A selective school is a government school that enrols students based on some sort of selection criteria, usually academic. The term may have different connotations in different systems and is the opposite of an open or comprehensive school, which accepts all students, regardless of aptitude.

In New South Wales, student placement in fully and partially selective high schools is highly competitive, with approximately 3,600 places offered to the 15,000 students who sit the Selective High School Test. there were 47 fully or partially selective government high schools, including 17 fully selective high schools (some of which are co-educational and others provide a single-sex educational environment); 25 partially selective high schools (high schools with both selective and comprehensive classes); four selective agricultural high schools; and one virtual selective high school. Of the 47 schools, 34 are located in greater metropolitan Sydney. Of the government selective high schools in New South Wales, James Ruse Agricultural High School is renowned for its academic achievements and competitiveness, as well as a near-perfect record of all students gaining university admission, especially in medicine, law and science. The school has outperformed every high school in New South Wales in the past 20 years in public university entrance examinations.

In Victoria, selective government high schools select all of their students based on an entrance examination. As of 2011, there were four selective schools: Melbourne High School, Mac.Robertson Girls&#x27; High School, Nossal High School and Suzanne Cory High School. In addition, there are three special schools namely Victorian College of the Arts Secondary School, John Monash Science School and Elizabeth Blackburn School of Sciences which cater to students opting for focused education in arts and science respectively.

In Queensland, there are four selective entry high schools. Brisbane State High School- established in 1921- which is partially selective, and the three Queensland Academies, which are fully selective- formed during 2007 and 2008. All require entry based on academic entry tests, NAPLAN results, primary school grades, interviews and other considerations.

In Western Australia, selective secondary education (officially named Gifted and Talented Education (GATE)) is operated by the Western Australian Department of Education through the Gifted and Talented Selective Entrance Programs for Year 7, and subject to limited placement availability for year-levels upward to Year 12. All applicants are required to sit the Academic Selective Entrance Test and possibly complete combined interviews, auditions and/or workshops depending on the program(s) applied for. The programs are categorised into three strands: academic, language, and arts. Eighteen government schools participate in the Gifted and Talented Programs, each specialising in one of the strands. All participating schools are partially selective and partially local intake, except for Perth Modern School which is fully selective.

=== Specialist schools ===

Schools that operate specialist education programs exist in all Australian states and territories. These schools are typically associated with the arts or elite sports programs. In South Australia, specialist schools cover the arts, gifted and talented programs, languages, agricultural schools, science, technology, engineering and mathematics, advanced technology project schools, sports schools, and trade training centres. In Victoria, examples of specialist government schools include those focused on science and maths (John Monash Science School), performing arts (Victorian College of the Arts Secondary School), sports (Maribyrnong Secondary College), and leadership and enterprise (The Alpine School). An alternative model is those sporting organisations that deliver specialist programs to a narrow selection of schools, such as Cricket Australia&#x27;s Specialist School Program to three Western Australian schools.

=== International schools ===

In Australia, international schools promote international education and may be operated by the government of the country of origin, the government of the state or territory in which the school is located, or be operated as a private school. International schools include those schools that have received international accreditation such as from the Council of International Schools, the International Baccalaureate Organization, or the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, or other similar organisations. , approximately 80 Australian schools meet that definition, with the vast majority being schools that offered one or more of the International Baccalaureate programs. Other schools are affiliated with specific cultures or languages, most notably French (e.g. Telopea Park School (ACT), Lycée Condorcet (NSW), Auburn High School (VIC)), German (e.g. German International School Sydney (NSW) and Deutsche Schule Melbourne (VIC)), or Japanese (e.g. Sydney Japanese International School (NSW), The Japanese School of Melbourne (VIC) and The Japanese School in Perth (WA)) schools, including Japanese supplementary weekend schools; or may generally be international in their outlook, including the International Grammar School (NSW) or the International School of Western Australia (WA).

== Mixed-sex and single-sex education ==
In Australia, both government and non-government schools operate co-educational and single-sex educational environments for students. The overwhelming number of schools are co-educational, with a small proportion of government schools operating single-sex schools, sometimes with a separate boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; school in the same suburb. All government single-sex schools are secondary schools. Examples of adjacent single-sex government secondary schools include Asquith Boys&#x27; and Asquith Girls&#x27;, Canterbury Boys&#x27; and Canterbury Girls&#x27;, North Sydney Boys&#x27; and North Sydney Girls&#x27;, Randwick Boys&#x27; and Randwick Girls&#x27;, and Sydney Boys&#x27; and Sydney Girls&#x27; (all in Sydney); and Melbourne High, and Mac.Robertson Girls&#x27; (in Melbourne).

The majority of single-sex schools in Australia are non-government schools, heavily weighted towards private schools, some of which are Catholic private schools. Some Catholic systemic schools are also single-sex schools; however, like government schools, the overwhelming majority are co-educational schools.

== Day and boarding schools ==

In Australia, both government and non-government schools operate day and boarding schools. , of the 10,584 registered schools operating in Australia, approximately 250 schools (or less than 2.5 per cent) were boarding schools. Some Australian schools offer gender-specific (boys&#x27; [approximately 21 per cent] or girls&#x27; [approximately 28 per cent]) and co-educational boarding schools (51 per cent); with multi-modal options, such as full-time boarding and part-time boarding (for example, going home on the weekends) offered by some schools. Some specialist education schools, such as The Australian Ballet School, offer boarding facilities. The largest peak body for boarding schools in Australia, the Australian Boarding Schools Association, claimed that, in 2017, there were 22,815 students in boarding schools covered by the association, an increase from 19,870 in 2014.

=== Qualifications ===
Within the context of the Australian Qualifications Framework, each state and territory is responsible for issuing certificates and/or qualifications to secondary students, collectively referred to as the Senior Secondary Certificate of Education. The following table serves as a summary of the qualifications issued by each state or territory:
As an alternative form (or as an addition to) the government-endorsed certification path, students, by approval, may elect to receive certification under the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme.

==== Basic skills tests ====

Australia’s system of national assessments, the National Assessment Program, established by the Australian Education Research Organization, uses four main standardised assessments to measure literacy and numeracy achievement of schoolar students over time: the National Assessment Program – Literacy and Numeracy (abbreviated as NAPLAN), the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS).

The NAPLAN is a series of tests focused on basic skills that are administered annually to Australian students. These standardised tests assess students&#x27; reading, writing, language (spelling, grammar and punctuation) and numeracy. Introduced in 2008, NAPLAN is administered by the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority (ACARA) and is overseen by the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) Education Council. The tests are designed to determine if Australian students are achieving outcomes. and to be carried out on the same days across Australia in any given year. Parents can decide whether their children take the test or not. The vast majority of Year 3, 5, 7 and 9 students participate. One of the aims of NAPLAN is to prepare young children for competitive examinations.

Unlike NAPLAN, PISA; TIMSS; and PIRLS are international assessments that target small samples of students to compare their results with those of samples of students around the world. While PISA is not necessarily intended to assess their understanding of the Australian Curriculum, TIMSS and PIRLS are designed to address the degree to which students retain and understand the Curriculum contents.

=== Provider of school education to international students ===
In Australia, a student is considered as an &quot;international student&quot; if he/she studies at an approved educational institution and he/she is not an Australian citizen, Australian permanent resident, New Zealand citizen, or a holder of an Australian permanent resident humanitarian visa. Under the , the Australian Government regulates the delivery of school and tertiary education to international students who are granted a student visa to study in Australia. The government maintains the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students (CRICOS) and, as of 2018, there were 396 school providers with an overall approved capacity of 88,285 students. While Australia as an education destination showed strong and sustained growth over many years, as of June 2019, school-based education fell by three per cent for the year, and represented approximately three per cent of all international student enrolments, with tertiary education, vocational education and training, and English Language Intensive Courses for Overseas Students (ELICOS) accounting for 93 per cent of all enrolments and recording 21 per cent annual growth.

=== Issues in Australian school education ===
====Government education policy====
Despite a substantial increase in government spending per student over ten years (after correcting for inflation), the proportion of students who are proficient in maths, reading and science has declined over that same period. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the Menzies Research Centre have both concluded that increasing school funding above a basic level has little effect on student proficiency. Instead, they both recommend greater autonomy. That is, the states should merely monitor the performance of the schools. Individual principals should have full authority and responsibility for ensuring student proficiency in core areas.

In 2010 the Gillard government commissioned David Gonski to the chair a committee to review funding of Australian schools. Entitled the Gonski Report, through the Council of Australian Governments the Gillard government sought to implement the National Education Reform Agreement that would deliver an 9.4 billion school funding plan. Despite some states and territories becoming parties to the Agreement, the plan was shelved following the 2013 federal election. The Turnbull government commissioned Gonski in 2017 to chair the independent Review to Achieve Educational Excellence in Australian Schools, commonly called Gonski 2.0. The government published the report on 30 April 2018. Following negotiation, bilateral agreements between the Commonwealth of Australia with each state and territory commenced on 1 January 2019, with the exception of Victoria, whose bilateral agreement commenced on 1 February 2019. The funding agreements provide states with funding for government schools (20 percent) and non-government schools (80 percent) taking into consideration annual changes in enrolment numbers, indexation and student or school characteristics. A National School Resourcing Board was charged with the responsibility of independently reviewing each state&#x27;s compliance with the funding agreement(s).

Australian students placed 16th in the world in reading, 29th in maths and 17th in science in the 2018 PISA study by the OCED. The Australian Education Union accredits decreases in government funding for declining student outcomes.

==== Indigenous primary and secondary education ====
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children are at a significant disadvantage when compared to non-Indigenous Australians across a number of key school educational measures. In 2008, the Council of Australian Governments announced seven &quot;closing the gap&quot; targets, of which four related to education, namely:
# participation in early childhood education: with the goal of 95 per cent of all Indigenous four-year-olds enrolled in early childhood education by 2025;
# reading, writing and numeracy levels: with the goal to halve the gap for Indigenous students in reading, writing and numeracy within a decade (by 2018);
# Year 12 attainment: with the goal to halve the gap for Indigenous 20–24 year olds in year 12 or equivalent attainment rates (by 2020); and
# school attendance: with the aim to close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous school attendance within five years (by 2018).
, the target results were:
====Bilingual education in schools====
Bilingual education in Australia may be divided into three different types, or target audiences, each having somewhat different purposes: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples; immigrant (CALD) groups; and English speakers looking to add another language to their education. The first two are interested in language maintenance and language revitalisation for ensuing generations.

The first recorded government support for bilingual education came under the Menzies government in 1950, when the first government schools for Aboriginal students were opened at four sites in the Northern Territory (NT), where instruction &quot;should include English Language, Native Language (where appropriate)&quot;. Policies and practices varied in the following years, with the first five pilot programs introduced in 1973 after the Whitlam government came to power and brought in new federal policies.

In the Northern Territory (the jurisdiction with the greatest proportion of Indigenous people, and many remote communities), bilingual programs for Indigenous students begun with Federal Government support in the early 1970s. Yirrkala Community School was identified as the first to undergo bilingual accreditation in 1980, and bilingual students outperformed the non-bilingual students. However, by December 1998 the Northern Territory Government had announced its decision to shift away from the 29 bilingual programs to a Territory-wide program teaching English as a second language. Within 12 months though the government had softened its position, after people took to the streets in protest.

From around 2000, most bilingual programs were allowed to continue under the names &quot;two-way education&quot;, or &quot;both-ways&quot; learning. Other programs included language maintenance and language revitalisation in remote schools across the NT.

Then on 24 August 2005, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training announced that the government would be &quot;revitalising bi-lingual education&quot; at 15 Community Education Centres: Alekarenge, Angurugu, Borroloola, Gapuwiyak, Gunbalanya, Kalkaringi, Lajamanu, Maningrida, Milingimbi, Ramingining, Ngukurr, Shepherdson College, Numbulwar, Yirrkala and Yuendumu. This revitalisation is conceived as part of an effort aimed at &quot;providing effective education from pre-school through to senior secondary at each of the Territory&#x27;s 15 Community Education Centres&quot;.

However, in October 2008, the first year of NAPLAN testing, despite the NT Indigenous Education Strategic Plan 2006-2009 supporting bilingual instruction, it was mandated by the NT Government that English should be the language of instruction in all NT schools for the first four hours of the school day. After legal challenges, an AIATSIS Symposium on Bilingual Education in 2009, media coverage and much debate, the policy was replaced by a new policy: &quot;Literacy for Both Worlds&quot;, but that was soon withdrawn again. There was intervention by the Australian Human Rights Commission, and in 2012 the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs issued a report which included the recommendation that: &quot;Indigenous language education should be introduced to all schools with Aboriginal students, and indigenous languages included as an official Closing the Gap measure&quot;.

Prominent schools involved in bilingual education programs in the NT include Yirrkala Community Education Centre (CEC) and Shepherdson College on Galiwin&#x27;ku. Yirrkala School and its sister school ignored the government directive, and has continued to teach its &quot;both ways&quot; methodology. The students&#x27; first language, Yolngu Matha, is taught alongside English. The method has proven effective against reducing the drop-out rate, and in 2020 eight students were the first in their community to graduate year 12 with scores enabling them to attend university. Yirrkala School and its sister school, Laynhapuy Homelands School, are now being looked to as models for learning in remote traditional communities. Areyonga School, in Areyonga, was still using both-ways education in August 2023, 50 years since it had begun there, teaching in Pitjantjatjara language and culture.

==== Religious education in government schools ====
Constitutionally, Australia is a secular country. Section 116 of &quot;Chapter V. The States&quot; in the Australian Constitution reads:

The Commonwealth shall not make any law for establishing any religion, or for imposing any religious observance, or for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion, and no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth.

Nevertheless, Australia maintains one of the highest concentrations of religious schools, when compared with other OECD countries. Historically, the teaching of religion in Australian government schools has been a contentious issue and was a motivator for the foundation of the government schooling system.

While the National School Chaplaincy Program provides an overarching framework based on pastoral care, not religious instruction, the practices and policies of religious instruction in Australian schools vary significantly from state to state. In New South Wales, the Special Religious Education classes are held in the government school sector that enable students to learn about the beliefs, practices, values and morals of a chosen religion. In Queensland, religious organisations may apply to school principals and, if approved, deliver approved religious instruction programs in government schools. In Victoria, legislation prescribes that government schools must not promote any particular religious practice, denomination or sect, and must be open to adherents of any philosophy, religion or faith. However, individual school principals may permit approved organisations to deliver non-compulsory &quot;special religious instruction&quot; classes of no more than 30 minutes per week per student, during lunchtime or in the hour before or after usual school hours. In Western Australia, both special religious education (not part of the general curriculum) and general religious education (as part of the general curriculum) are offered in government schools.

====School violence====
In July 2009, the Queensland Minister for Education said that the rising levels of violence in schools in the state were &quot;totally unacceptable&quot; and that not enough had been done to combat violent behaviour. In Queensland, 55,000 school students were suspended in 2008, nearly a third of which were for &quot;physical misconduct&quot;.

In South Australia, 175 violent attacks against students or staff were recorded in 2008. Students were responsible for deliberately causing 3,000 injuries reported by teachers over two years from 2008 to 2009.

As of 2024, school violence is still prevalent. In an annual survey by the Australian Catholic University (ACU) 48 per cent of school principals reported having seen or experienced an event of physical violence.

====ESOS Act====
The Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 (or ESOS Act) sets out the legal framework governing delivery of education to international students visiting Australia on a student visa.

== Tertiary education ==


Tertiary education (or higher education) in Australia is primarily studied at university or a registered training organisation studying Diploma or above in order to receive a qualification or further skills and training. A higher education provider is a body that is established or recognised by or under the law of the Australian Government, a State, the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory. VET providers, both public and private are registered by state and territory governments.
In 2021, 1,185,450 students were attending university or other higher education. There are 42 universities in Australia: 37 public universities, 3 private universities and 2 international private universities, , the largest university in Australia was Monash University in Melbourne: with five campuses and 75,000 students. The Group of Eight (Go8) is a coalition of eight prestigious Australian universities established in 1999 which comprise more than two-thirds of the country&#x27;s university research.

There are non-self-accrediting higher education providers accredited by state and territory authorities, numbering more than 132 as listed on state and territory registers. These include several that are registered in more than one state and territory.

All students doing nationally recognised training need to have a Unique Student Identifier (USI).

=== International tertiary students ===
Australia has the highest ratio of international students per head of population in the world by a large margin, with 812,000 international students enrolled in the nation&#x27;s universities and vocational institutions in 2019. Accordingly, in 2019, international students represented on average 26.7% of the student bodies of Australian universities. International education, therefore, represents one of the country&#x27;s largest exports and has a pronounced influence on the country&#x27;s demographics, with a significant proportion of international students remaining in Australia after graduation on various skill and employment visas. The Australian onshore international education sector is predicted to rise to 940,000 by 2025. The biggest source markets for onshore international learner enrolments in 2025 are expected to be China, India, Vietnam, Thailand, Nepal, Malaysia, Brazil and South Korea. According to a 2016 report by Deloitte Access Economics for the Australian Trade and Investment Commission, higher education and Vocational Education and Training (VET) were projected to be the fastest-growing sectors in onshore international education by 2025. Australian Government is also planning to add another 1.46 billion AUD according to Modern Manufacturing Strategy, which predicts a high jump in job growth and migration of people.

=== Rankings ===
Thirty-six Australian tertiary educational institutions were listed in the QS World University Rankings for 2021; and 37 institutions were listed in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings in the same year. As of 2020, 34 Australian universities were listed in China&#x27;s Academic Ranking of World Universities ranking, with The University of Melbourne achieving the highest global ranking, at 35th. In the same year, according to the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; Best Global Universities Rankings, 38 Australian universities were ranked, ranging from the University of Melbourne, at 25th place, to Bond University, at 1133th place.

The Education Index, published with the UN&#x27;s Human Development Index in 2018, based on data from 2017, listed Australia as 0.929, the second-highest in the world.

<text>DNIX (original spelling: D-Nix) is a discontinued Unix-like real-time operating system from the Swedish company Dataindustrier AB (DIAB). A version named ABCenix was developed for the ABC 1600 computer from Luxor. Daisy Systems also had a system named Daisy DNIX on some of their computer-aided design (CAD) workstations. It was unrelated to DIAB&#x27;s product.

== History ==

=== Inception at DIAB in Sweden ===

Dataindustrier AB (literal translation: computer industries shareholding company) was started in 1970 by Lars Karlsson as a single-board computer manufacture in Sundsvall, Sweden, producing a Zilog Z80-based computer named &quot;Data Board 4680&quot;. In 1978, DIAB started to work with the Swedish television company Luxor AB to produce the home and office computer series ABC 80 and ABC 800.

In 1983 DIAB independently developed the first Unix-compatible machine, DIAB DS90 based on the Motorola 68000 CPU. D-NIX here made its appearance, based on a UNIX System V license from AT&amp;T Corporation. DIAB was however an industrial control system (automation) company, and needed a real-time operating system, so the company replaced the AT&amp;T-supplied UNIX kernel with their own in-house developed, yet compatible real-time variant. This kernel was inspired by a Z80 kernel named &quot;OS.8&quot; created for Monroe Systems division of Litton Industries.

Over time, the company also replaced several of the UNIX standard userspace tools with their own implementations, to the point where no code was derived from UNIX, and their machines could be deployed independently of any AT&amp;T UNIX license. Two years later and in cooperation with Luxor, a computer called ABC 1600 was developed for the office market, while in parallel, DIAB continue to produce enhanced versions of the DS90 computer using newer versions of the Motorola CPUs such as Motorola 68010, 68020, 68030 and eventually 68040. In 1990 DIAB was acquired by Groupe Bull who continued to produce and support the DS machines under the brand name &quot;DIAB&quot;, with names such as &quot;DIAB 2320&quot;, &quot;DIAB 2340&quot; etc., still running DIABs version of DNIX.

=== Derivative at ISC Systems Corporation ===
ISC Systems Corporation (ISC) purchased the right to use DNIX in the late 1980s for use in its line of Motorola 68k-based banking computers. (ISC was later bought by Olivetti, and was in turn resold to Wang, which was then bought by Getronics. This corporate entity, most often referred to as &#x27;ISC&#x27;, has answered to a bewildering array of names over the years.) This code branch was the SVR2 compatible version, and received extensive modification and development at their hands. Notable features of this operating system were its support of demand paging, diskless workstations, multiprocessing, asynchronous input/output (I/O), the ability to mount processes (handlers) on directories in the file system, and message passing. Its real-time support consisted largely of internal event-driven queues rather than list search mechanisms (no &#x27;thundering herd&#x27;), static process priorities in two classes (run to completion and timesliced), support for contiguous files (to avoid fragmentation of critical resources), and memory locking. The quality of the orthogonal asynchronous event implementation has yet to be equalled in current commercial operating systems, though some approach it. (The concept that has yet to be adopted is that the synchronous marshalling point of all the asynchronous activity could also be asynchronous, ad infinitum. DNIX handled this with aplomb.) The asynchronous I/O facility obviated the need for Berkeley sockets &quot;select&quot; or SVR4&#x27;s STREAMS &quot;poll&quot; mechanism, though there was a socket emulation library that preserved the socket semantics for backward compatibility. Another feature of DNIX was that &quot;none&quot; of the standard utilities (such as &quot;ps&quot;, a frequent offender) rummaged around in the kernel&#x27;s memory to do their job. System calls were used instead, and this meant the kernel&#x27;s internal architecture was free to change as required. The handler concept allowed network protocol stacks to be outside the kernel, which greatly eased development and improved overall reliability, though at a performance cost. It also allowed for foreign file systems to be user-level processes, again for improved reliability. The main file system, though it could have been (and once was) an external process, was pulled into the kernel for performance reasons. Were it not for this DNIX could well have been considered a microkernel, though it was not formally developed as such. Handlers could appear as any type of &#x27;native&#x27; Unix file, directory structure, or device, and file I/O requests that the handler could not process could be passed off to other handlers, including the underlying one on which the handler was mounted. Handler connections could also exist and be passed around independent of the file system, much like a pipe. One effect of this is that text terminal (TTY) like &quot;devices&quot; could be emulated without needing a kernel-based pseudo terminal facility.

An example of where a handler saved the day was in ISC&#x27;s diskless workstation support, where a bug in the implementation meant that using named pipes on the workstation could induce undesirable resource locking on the fileserver. A handler was created on the workstation to field accesses to the afflicted named pipes until the appropriate kernel fixes could be developed. This handler required approximately 5 kilobytes of code to implement, an indication that a non-trivial handler did not need to be large.

ISC also received the right to manufacture DIAB&#x27;s DS90-10 and DS90-20 machines as its file servers. The multiprocessor DS90-20&#x27;s, however, were too expensive for the target market and ISC designed its own servers and ported DNIX to them. ISC designed its own GUI-based diskless workstations for use with these file servers, and ported DNIX again. (Though ISC used Daisy workstations running Daisy DNIX to design the machines that would run DIAB&#x27;s DNIX, there was negligible confusion internally as the drafting and layout staff rarely talked to the software staff. Moreover, the hardware design staff didn&#x27;t use &quot;either&quot; system! The running joke went something like: &quot;At ISC we &quot;build&quot; computers, we don&#x27;t &quot;use&quot; them.&quot;) The asynchronous I/O support of DNIX allowed for easy event-driven programming in the workstations, which performed well even though they had relatively limited resources. (The GUI diskless workstation had a 7 MHz 68010 processor and was usable with only 512K of memory, of which the kernel consumed approximately half. Most workstations had 1 MB of memory, though there were later 2 MB and 4 MB versions, along with 10 MHz processors.) A full-blown installation could consist of one server (16 MHz 68020, 8 MB of RAM, and a 200 MB hard disk) and up to 64 workstations. Though slow to boot up, such an array would perform acceptably in a bank teller application. Besides the innate efficiency of DNIX, the associated DIAB C compiler was key to high performance. It generated particularly good code for the 68010, especially after ISC got done with it. (ISC also retargeted it to the Texas Instruments TMS34010 graphics coprocessor used in its last workstation.) The DIAB C compiler was, of course, used to build DNIX, which was one of the factors contributing to its efficiency, and is still available, in some form, through Wind River Systems.

These systems are still in use as of this writing in 2006, in former Seattle-First National Bank branches now branded Bank of America. There may be, and probably are, other ISC customers still using DNIX in some capacity. Through ISC there was a considerable DNIX presence in Central and South America.

== Asynchronous events ==
DNIX&#x27;s native system call was the codice_1 library function, analogous to the standard Unix codice_2 or codice_3 function. It took multiple arguments, the first of which was a function code. Semantically this single call provided all appropriate Unix functionality, though it was syntactically different from Unix and had, of course, numerous DNIX-only extensions.

DNIX function codes were organized into two classes: Type 1 and Type 2. Type 1 commands were those that were associated with I/O activity, or anything that could potentially cause the issuing process to block. Major examples were, codice_4, codice_5, codice_6, codice_7, codice_8, codice_9, codice_10, and codice_11. Type 2 were the remainder, such as, codice_12, codice_13, etc. They could be satisfied by the kernel immediately.

To invoke asynchronicity, a special file descriptor called a trap queue had to have been created via the Type 2 opcode, codice_14. A Type 1 call would have the, codice_15 bit OR-ed with its function value, and one of the additional parameters to, codice_1 was the trap queue file descriptor. The return value from an asynchronous call was not the normal value but a kernel-assigned identifier. At such time as the asynchronous request completed, a, codice_17 (or, codice_6) of the trap queue file descriptor would return a small kernel-defined structure containing the identifier and result status. The, codice_19 operation was available to cancel any asynchronous operation that hadn&#x27;t yet been completed, one of its arguments was the kernel-assigned identifier. (A process could only cancel requests that were currently self-owned. The exact semantics of cancelling was up to each request&#x27;s handler, fundamentally it only meant that any waiting was to be terminated. A partially completed operation could be returned.) In addition to the kernel-assigned identifier, one of the arguments given to any asynchronous operation was a 32-bit user-assigned identifier. This most often referenced a function pointer to the appropriate subroutine that would handle the I/O completion method, but this was merely convention. It was the entity that read the trap queue elements that was responsible for interpreting this value.
struct itrq { /* Structure of data read from trap queue. */
 short it_stat; /* Status */
 short it_rn; /* Request number */
 long it_oid; /* Owner ID given on request */
 long it_rpar; /* Returned parameter */


Of note is that the asynchronous events were gathered via normal file descriptor read operations, and that such reading was also able to be asynchronous. This had implications for semi-autonomous asynchronous event handling packages that could exist within one process. (DNIX 5.2 did not have lightweight processes or threads.) Also of note is that &quot;any&quot; potentially blocking operation could be issued asynchronously, so DNIX was well equipped to handle many clients with a single server process. A process was not restricted to having only one trap queue, so I/O requests could be grossly prioritized in this way.

=== Compatibility ===
In addition to the native codice_1 call, a complete set of &#x27;standard&#x27; libc interface calls was available.
codice_21, codice_22, codice_17, codice_24, etc. Besides being useful for backwards compatibility, these were implemented in a binary-compatible manner with the NCR Tower computer, so that binaries compiled for it would run unchanged under DNIX. The DNIX kernel had two trap dispatchers internally, one for the DNIX method and one for the Unix method. Choice of dispatcher was up to the programmer, and using both interchangeably was acceptable. Semantically they were identical wherever functionality overlapped. (In these machines the 68000 codice_25 instruction was used for the codice_2 calls, and the codice_27 instruction for codice_1. The two trap handlers were very similar, though the [usually hidden] codice_2 call held the function code in the processor&#x27;s D0 register, whereas codice_1 held it on the stack with the rest of the parameters.)

DNIX 5.2 had no networking protocol stacks internally (except for the thin X.25-based Ethernet protocol stack added by ISC for use by its diskless workstation support package), all networking was conducted by reading and writing to Handlers. Thus, there was no socket mechanism, but a codice_31 existed that used asynchronous I/O to talk to the TCP/IP handler. The typical Berkeley-derived networking program could be compiled and run unchanged (modulo the usual Unix porting problems), though it might not be as efficient as an equivalent program that used native asynchronous I/O.

== Handlers ==
Under DNIX, a process could be used to handle I/O requests and to extend the file system. Such a process was called a &quot;Handler&quot;, and was a major feature of the operating system. A handler was defined as a process that owned at least one &quot;request queue&quot;, a special file descriptor that was procured in one of two ways: with a codice_32 or a codice_33 call. The former invented an isolated request queue, one end of which was then typically handed down to a child process. (The network remote execution programs, of which there were many, used this method to provide standard I/O paths to their children.) The latter hooked into the file system so that file I/O requests could be adopted by handlers. (The network login programs, of which there were even more, used this method to provide standard I/O paths to their children, as the semantics of logging in under Unix requires a way for multiple perhaps-unrelated processes to horn in on the standard I/O path to the operator.) Once mounted on a directory in the file system, the handler then received all I/O calls to that point.

A handler would then read small kernel-assigned request data structures from the request queue. (Such reading could be done synchronously or asynchronously as the handler&#x27;s author desired.) The handler would then do whatever each request required to be satisfied, often using the DNIX codice_34 and codice_35 calls to read and write into the request&#x27;s data space, and then would terminate the request appropriately using codice_36. A privileged handler could adopt the permissions of its client for individual requests to subordinate handlers (such as the file system) via the codice_37 call, so it didn&#x27;t need to reproduce the subordinate&#x27;s permission scheme. If a handler was unable to complete a request alone, the codice_38 function could be used to pass I/O requests from one handler to another. A handler could perform part of the work requested before passing the rest on to another handler. It was very common for a handler to be state-machine oriented so that requests it was fielding from a client were all done asynchronously. This allowed for a single handler to field requests from multiple clients simultaneously without them blocking each other unnecessarily. Part of the request structure was the process ID and its priority so that a handler could choose what to work on first based upon this information, there was no requirement that work be performed in the order it was requested. To aid in this, it was possible to poll both request and trap queues to see if there was more work to be considered before buckling down to actually do it.
struct ireq { /* Structure of incoming request */
 short ir_fc; /* Function code */
 short ir_rn; /* Request number */
 long ir_opid; /* Owner ID that you gave on open or mount */
 long ir_bc; /* Byte count */
 long ir_upar; /* User parameter */
 long ir_rad; /* Random address */
 ushort ir_uid; /* User ID */
 ushort ir_gid; /* User group */
 time_t ir_time; /* Request time */
 ulong ir_nph;
 ulong ir_npl; /* Node and process ID */


There was no particular restriction on the number of request queues a process could have. This was used to provide networking facilities to chroot jails, for example.

=== Examples ===

* foreign file systems
** FAT
** CD-ROM/ISO9660
** disk image files
** RAM disk (for use with write-protected boot disks)
* networking protocols
** DNET (essentially X.25 over Ethernet, with multicast capability)
** X.25
** TCP/IP
** DEC LAT
** AppleTalk
* remote file systems
** DNET&#x27;s /net/machine/path/from/its/root...
** NFS
* remote login
** ncu (DNET)
** telnet
** rlogin
** wcu (DNET GUI)
** X.25 PAD
** DEC LAT
* remote execution
** rx (DNET)
** remsh
** rexec
* system extension
** windowman (GUI)
** vterm (xterm-like)
** document (passbook) printer
** dmap (ruptime analog)
** windowmac (GUI gateway to Macintosh)
* system patches
** named pipe handler

== ISC&#x27;s extensions ==
ISC purchased both 5.2 (SVR2 compatible) and 5.3 (SVR3 compatible) versions of DNIX. At the time of purchase, DNIX 5.3 was still undergoing development at DIAB so DNIX 5.2 was what was deployed. Over time, ISC&#x27;s engineers incorporated most of their 5.3 kernel&#x27;s features into 5.2, primarily shared memory and IPC, so there was some divergence of features between DIAB and ISC&#x27;s versions of DNIX. DIAB&#x27;s 5.3 likely went on to contain more SVR3 features than ISC&#x27;s 5.2 ended up with. Also, DIAB went on to DNIX 5.4, a SVR4 compatible OS.

At ISC, developers considerably extended their version of DNIX 5.2 (only listed are features involving the kernel) based upon both their needs and the general trends of the Unix industry:

* Diskless workstation support. The workstation&#x27;s kernel file system was removed, and replaced with an X.25-based Ethernet communications stub. The file server&#x27;s kernel was also extended with a mating component that received the remote requests and handed them to a pool of kernel processes for service, though a standard handler could have been written to do this. (Later in its product lifecycle, ISC deployed standard SVR4-based Unix servers in place of the DNIX servers. These used X.25 STREAMS and a custom-written file server program. Despite the less efficient structuring, the raw horsepower of the platforms used made for a much faster server. It is unfortunate that this file server program did not support all of the functionality of the native DNIX server. Tricky things, like named pipes, never worked at all. This was another justification for the named pipe handler process.)
* gdb watchpoint support using the features of ISC&#x27;s MMU.
* Asynchronous I/O to the file system was made real. (Originally it blocked anyway.) Kernel processes (kprocs, or threads) were used to do this.
* Support for a truss- or strace-like program. In addition to some repairs to bugs in the standard Unix &quot;ptrace&quot; single-stepping mechanism, this required adding a temporary process adoption facility so that the tracer could use the standard single-stepping mechanism on existing processes.
* SVR4 signal mechanism extensions. Primarily for the new &quot;STOP&quot; and &quot;CONT&quot; signals, but encompassing the new signal control calls as well. Due to ISC&#x27;s lack of source code for the adb and sdb debuggers the u-page could not be modified, so the new signals could only be blocked or receive default handling, they could not be caught.
* Support for network sniffing. This required extending the Ethernet driver so that a single event could satisfy more than one I/O request, and conditionally implementing the hardware filtering in software to support promiscuous mode.
* Disk mirroring. This was done in the file system and not the device driver, so that slightly (or even completely) different devices could still be mirrored together. Mirroring a small hard disk to the floppy was a popular way to test mirroring as ejecting the floppy was an easy way to induce disk errors.
* 32-bit inode, 30-character filename, symbolic link, and sticky directory extensions to the file system. Added /dev/zero, /dev/noise, /dev/stdXXX, and /dev/fd/X devices.
* Process group id lists (from SVR4).
* #! direct script execution.
* Serial port multiplication using ISC&#x27;s Z-80 based VMEbus communications boards.
* Movable swap partition.
* Core &#x27;dump&#x27; snapshots of running processes. Support for fuser command.
* Process renice function. Associated timesharing reprioritizer program to implement floating priorities.
* A way to &#x27;mug&#x27; a process, instantly depriving it of &quot;all&quot; memory resources. Very useful for determining what the current working set is, as opposed to what is still available to it but not necessarily being used. This was associated with a GUI utility showing the status of all 1024 pages of a process&#x27;s memory map. (This being the number of memory pages supported by ISC&#x27;s MMU.) In use you would &#x27;mug&#x27; the target process periodically through its life and then watch to see how much memory was swapped back in. This was useful as ISC&#x27;s production environment used only a few long-lived processes, controlling their memory utilization and growth was key to maintaining performance.

=== Features that were never added ===
When DNIX development at ISC effectively ceased in 1997, a number of planned OS features were left on the table:

* Shared objects – There were two dynamically loaded libraries in existence, an encryptor for DNET and the GUI&#x27;s imaging library, but the facility was never generalized. ISC&#x27;s machines were characterized by a general lack of virtual address space, so extensive use of memory-mapped entities would not have been possible.
* Lightweight processes – The kernel already had multiple threads that shared a single MMU context, extending this to user processes should have been straightforward. The API implications would have been the most difficult part of this.
* Access-control lists (ACL) – Trivial to implement using an ACL handler mounted over the stock file system.
* Multiple swap partitions – DNIX already used free space on the selected volume for swapping, it would have been easy to give it a list of volumes to try in turn, potentially with associated space limits to keep it from consuming all free space on a volume before moving on to the next one.
* Remote kernel debugging via gdb – All the pieces were there to do it either through the customary serial port or over Ethernet using the kernel&#x27;s embedded X.25 link software, but they were never assembled.
* 68030 support – ISC&#x27;s prototypes were never completed. Two processor piggyback plug-in cards were built, but were never used as more than faster 68020&#x27;s. They were not reliable, nor were they as fast as they could have been due to having to fit into a 68020 socket. The fast context switching ISC MMU would be left disabled (and left out altogether in proposed production units), and the embedded one of the 68030 was to have been used instead, using a derivative of the DS90-20&#x27;s MMU code. While the ISC MMU was very efficient and supported instant switching among 32 resident processes, it was very limited in addressability. The 68030 MMU would have allowed for much more than 8 MB of virtual space in a process, which was the limit of the ISC MMU. Though this MMU would be slower, the overall faster speed of the 68030 should have more than made up for it, so that a 68030 machine was expected to be in all ways faster, and support much larger processes.

<text>Quikscript (also known as the [[Ronald Kingsley Read|Read]] Alphabet and Second [[Shavian alphabet|Shaw]]) is a constructed alphabet intended to replace traditional English orthography. It is a revised version of the Shavian alphabet, designed to be written more quickly by hand than its predecessor and make it more universal.

==Origins and history==

Read organized a lengthy public testing phase of Shavian by some 500 users from around the world who spoke different dialects of English. Once he had analyzed the results of those tests, Read decided to revise Shavian to incorporate a number of improvements to make it both easier and faster to write. He called the revised alphabet &quot;Quikscript&quot;. In 1966, he published the Quikscript manual which set out the alphabet&#x27;s rationale, and briefly discussed different possible methods of alphabet reform. The manual provides comprehensive instructions regarding the use of the alphabet along with reading samples.

==Description==

Each Quikscript letter represents a single English phoneme. There are 25 consonants and 15 vowels, making 40 letters in all. The letters are designed to be written easily, each requiring only one (usually curved) pen stroke.

Just as in the Roman alphabet, there are short letters (e.g. a, c, e, m, and n), written between the base writing line and the &quot;upper parallel&quot; (as Read calls it), tall letters (e.g. b, d, f, k, and t), which ascend above the top of the short letters, and deep letters (e.g. g, j, p and y), which descend below the base writing line. Quikscript, however, makes better use of these possibilities with 11 tall, 11 deep, and 18 short letters. All vowels have short letter shapes, and the most common phonemes have the simplest letter shapes.

Similar-sounding phonemes have similar letter shapes, for example:
* Long vowels and glides are written with a larger bend or loop, while short vowels have a simpler shape.
* Every voiced consonant is written with a deep letter similar in shape to the corresponding voiceless consonant which is written with a tall letter.

While the Roman alphabet has two distinct forms for each letter, designated minuscule and majuscule, most letters in Quikscript have only one form. Names and proper nouns are preceded with a mid-line &quot;name-dot&quot; (·) which is sufficient to distinguish them from ordinary words.

===Junior Quikscript===
Beginners learn Junior Quikscript first, which is much more similar to the Shavian alphabet. Each word is spelled &quot;as it is spoken&quot;. Each letter is written separately from the next so that it is equivalent to what is termed &quot;printing&quot; in the Roman alphabet. Some people may prefer Junior Quikscript for printed texts as readers are used to the Roman alphabet being printed in that manner.

==== Examples ====
=== Senior Quikscript ===
Senior Quikscript introduces a number of advanced techniques which save time in writing, namely ligatures, cursive, alternate letter forms, abbreviations and half-letters.

==== Ligatures and cursive ====
The most obvious difference is that Senior encourages ligatures as long as the shapes of the letters are not altered. The design of the alphabet fosters these natural connections, as each Quikscript letter either begins or ends on the base line or the upper parallel. This structure permits letters to connect easily yet maintains the shapes of the individual letters because there are no connecting strokes between letters as there are in cursive Roman alphabet writing. It is common that Senior writing will have several conjoined letters in a row, but when such a connection is not possible, the letters are simply left unconnected.

==== Alternate letter forms and abbreviations ====
Read added a very small number of alternative letter forms, which permit even more letters to connect easily, along with a number of abbreviations for the most common English words, further reducing the space requirement for printed material and hence the costs of physical publication; it is the writer&#x27;s choice whether to use them or not.

==== Half-letters ====
Senior Quikscript also introduces the concept of half-letters. Read recognized that the top half of several tall letters and the bottom half of several deep letters are sufficient to clearly distinguish them. Therefore, the portion of the vertical shafts of those letters which lies between the base line and upper parallel can be discarded with no effect to legibility. Half-letters increase the number of letters which can be conjoined, yielding several benefits:
# The alphabet&#x27;s appearance becomes more cursive and fluid, which is aesthetically appealing.
# Handwriting is more efficent because fewer pen-lifts are required.
# Word-shapes are more variable and distinct, which improves word recognition and increases the average reading speed.

==References in literature==
Book two of the popular &quot;Cole&#x27;s Funny Picture Books&quot;, published in Australia by E. W. Cole at the turn of the 20th century, was revised in 1979 to include an article introducing Quikscript under the name Second Shaw.

<text>Uncle Tom is the title character of Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x27;s 1852 novel &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;. The character was seen in the Victorian era as a ground-breaking literary attack against the dehumanization of slaves. Tom is a deeply religious Christian preacher to his fellow slaves who uses nonresistance, but who accepts being flogged to death rather than violate the plantation&#x27;s code of silence by informing against the route being used by two women who have just escaped from slavery. However, the character also came to be criticized for allegedly being inexplicably kind to white slaveowners, especially based on his portrayal in pro-compassion dramatizations. This led to the use of &quot;Uncle Tom&quot; – sometimes shortened to just &quot;a Tom&quot; – as a derogatory epithet for an exceedingly subservient person or house negro, particularly one accepting and uncritical of their own lower-class status.

==Original characterization and critical evaluations==
At the time of the novel&#x27;s initial publication in 1851, Uncle Tom was a rejection of the existing stereotypes of minstrel shows; Stowe&#x27;s melodramatic story humanized the suffering of slavery for white audiences by portraying Tom as a young, strong Jesus-like figure who is ultimately martyred, beaten to death by a cruel master (Simon Legree) because he refuses to betray the whereabouts of two women who had escaped from slavery. Stowe reversed the gender conventions of slave narratives by juxtaposing Uncle Tom&#x27;s passivity against the daring of three African American women who escape from slavery.

The novel was both influential and commercially successful, published as a serial from 1851 to 1852 and as a book from 1852 onward. An estimated 500,000 copies had sold worldwide by 1853, including unauthorized reprints. Senator Charles Sumner credited &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; for the election of Abraham Lincoln, an opinion that is later echoed in the apocryphal story of Lincoln greeting Stowe with the quip, &quot;So &quot;you&#x27;re&quot; the little woman who wrote the book that made this great war!&quot; Frederick Douglass praised the novel as &quot;a flash to light a million camp fires in front of the embattled hosts of slavery.&quot; Despite Douglass&#x27;s enthusiasm, an anonymous 1852 reviewer for William Lloyd Garrison&#x27;s publication, &quot;The Liberator&quot;, suspected a racial double standard in the idealization of Uncle Tom:

Uncle Tom&#x27;s character is sketched with great power and rare religious perception. It triumphantly exemplifies the nature, tendency, and results of Christian non-resistance. We are curious to know whether Mrs. Stowe is a believer in the duty of non-resistance for the white man, under all possible outrage and peril, as for the black man ... [For whites in parallel circumstances, it is often said] Talk not of overcoming evil with goodit is madness! Talk not of peacefully submitting to chains and stripesit is base servility! Talk not of servants being obedient to their masterslet the blood of tyrants flow! How is this to be explained or reconciled? Is there one law of submission and non-resistance for the black man, and another of rebellion and conflict for the white man? When it is the whites who are trodden in the dust, does Christ justify them in taking up arms to vindicate their rights? And when it is the blacks who are thus treated, does Christ require them to be patient, harmless, long-suffering, and forgiving? Are there two Christs?

James Weldon Johnson, a prominent figure of the Harlem Renaissance, expressed an antipathetic opinion in his autobiography:

For my part, I was never an admirer of Uncle Tom, nor of his type of goodness; but I believe that there were lots of old Negroes as foolishly good as he.

In 1949, American writer James Baldwin rejected the emasculation of the title character &quot;robbed of his humanity and divested of his sex&quot; as the price of spiritual salvation for a dark-skinned man in a fiction whose African-American characters, in Baldwin&#x27;s view, were invariably two-dimensional stereotypes. To Baldwin, Stowe was closer to a pamphleteer than a novelist and her artistic vision was fatally marred by polemics and racism that manifested especially in her handling of the title character. Stowe had stated that her sons had wept when she first read them the scene of Uncle Tom&#x27;s death. But after Baldwin&#x27;s essay, it ceased being respectable to accept the melodrama of the Uncle Tom story. Uncle Tom became what critic Linda Williams describes as &quot;an epithet of servility&quot; and the novel&#x27;s reputation plummeted until feminist critics led by Jane Tompkins reassessed the tale&#x27;s female characters.

According to Debra J. Rosenthal, in an introduction to a collection of critical appraisals for the &quot;Routledge Literary Sourcebook on Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;&quot;, overall reactions have been mixed, with some critics praising the novel for affirming the humanity of the African American characters and for the risks Stowe assumed in taking a very public stand against slavery before abolitionism had become a socially acceptable cause, and others criticizing the very limited terms upon which those characters&#x27;s humanity was affirmed and the artistic shortcomings of political melodrama.

==Inspiration==

A specific impetus for the novel was the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, which imposed heavy fines upon law enforcement personnel in Northern states if they refused to assist the return of people who escaped from slavery. The new law also stripped African Americans of the right to request a jury trial or to testify on their own behalf, even if they were legally free, whenever a single claimant presented an affidavit of ownership. The same law authorized a $1000 (~$ in ) fine and six months imprisonment for anyone who knowingly harbored or assisted a fugitive slave. These terms infuriated Stowe, so the novel was written, read, and debated as a political abolitionist tract.

Stowe drew inspiration for the Uncle Tom character from several sources. The best-known of these was Josiah Henson, an ex-slave whose autobiography, &quot;The Life of Josiah Henson, Formerly a Slave, Now an Inhabitant of Canada, as Narrated by Himself&quot;, was originally published in 1849 and later republished in two extensively revised editions after the publication of &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;. Henson was enslaved at birth in 1789. He became a Christian at age eighteen and began preaching. Henson attempted to purchase his freedom for $450, but after selling his personal assets to raise $350 and signing a promissory note for the remainder, Henson&#x27;s owner raised the price to $1000; Henson was unable to prove that the original agreement had been for a lesser amount. Shortly afterward Henson was ordered on a trip south to New Orleans. When he learned that he was to be sold there, he obtained a weapon. He contemplated murdering his white companions with the weapon, but decided against violence because his Christian morals forbade it. A sudden illness in one of his companions forced their return to Kentucky, and shortly afterward Henson escaped north with his family, settling in Canada where he became a civic leader.

Stowe read the first edition of Henson&#x27;s narrative and later confirmed that she had incorporated elements from it into &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;. Kentucky and New Orleans figure in both Henson&#x27;s narrative and the novel&#x27;s settings, and some other story elements are similar.

In the public imagination, however, Henson became synonymous with Uncle Tom. After Stowe&#x27;s death her son and grandson claimed she and Henson had met before &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; was written, but the chronology does not hold up to scrutiny and she probably drew material only from his published autobiography.

==Epithet==
The term &quot;Uncle Tom&quot; is used as an epithet for an excessively subservient person, particularly when that person perceives his or her own lower-class status based on race. It is similarly used to negatively describe people who betray their own group by participating in its oppression, whether willingly or not. The term has also, with more intended neutrality, been applied in psychology in the form of &quot;Uncle Tom syndrome&quot;, a term for the use of subservience, appeasement, and passivity to cope with intimidation and threats.

The popular negative connotations of &quot;Uncle Tom&quot; have largely been attributed to the numerous derivative works inspired by &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; in the decade after its release, rather than to the original novel itself, whose title character is a more positive figure. These works, often called a &quot;Tom show,&quot; lampooned and distorted the portrayal of Uncle Tom with politically loaded overtones.

===History===

American copyright law before 1856 did not give novel authors any control over derivative stage adaptations, so Stowe neither approved the adaptations nor profited from them. Minstrel show retellings in particular, usually performed by white men in blackface, tended to be derisive and pro-slavery, transforming Uncle Tom from a Christian martyr to a fool or apologist for slavery. The performer and theatre manager George Kunkel was the first to adapt Stowe&#x27;s novel into the minstrel show format; portraying the role of Uncle Tom in its first minstrel show adaptation in Charleston, South Carolina in 1861. Kunkel became the most prominent minstrel show performer in that part, performing it throughout the United States for decades and on a tour of England in 1883. His last performance of the part was in January 1885 less than a month before his death.
Adapted theatrical performances of the novel, called Tom Shows, remained in continual production in the United States for at least 80 years beyond the 1850s (1930s). These representations had a lasting cultural impact and influenced the pejorative nature of the term &quot;Uncle Tom&quot; in later popular use. 

Although not every minstrel depiction of Uncle Tom was negative, the dominant version developed into a character very different from Stowe&#x27;s hero. Whereas Stowe&#x27;s Uncle Tom was a young, muscular, and virile man who refused to obey his cruel master, Simon Legree, when Legree ordered him to beat other slaves, the stock character of the minstrel shows was degenerated into a shuffling, asexual individual, with a receding hairline and graying hair. For Jo-Ann Morgan, author of &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin as Visual Culture,&quot; these shifting representations undermined the subversive layers of Stowe&#x27;s original characterization by redefining Uncle Tom until he fitted within prevailing racist norms. Particularly after the Civil War, as the political thrust of the novel which had arguably helped to precipitate that war became obsolete to actual political discourse, popular depictions of the title character recast him within the apologetics of the Lost Cause of the Confederacy. The virile father of the abolitionist serial and first book edition degenerated into a decrepit old man, and with that transformation the character lost the capacity for resistance that had originally given meaning to his choices. Stowe never meant Uncle Tom to be a derided name, but the term, as a pejorative, has developed based on how later versions of the character, stripped of his inherent strength, were depicted on stage.

Claire Parfait, author of &quot;The Publishing History of Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin, 1852–2002,&quot; opined that &quot;the many alterations in retellings of the Uncle Tom story demonstrate an impulse to correct the retellers&#x27;s perceptions of its flaws&quot; and of &quot;the capacity of the novel to irritate and rankle, even a century and a half after its first publication.&quot;

=== 20th-century Black cultural critique ===
Spike Lee&#x27;s 2000 film &quot;Bamboozled&quot; was a dark modern satire or comedy drama that challenges this kind of negative stereotyping. The film featured popular Black actors such as Damon Wayans as Pierre &quot;Peerless Dothan&quot; Delacroix and Jada Pinkett Smith as Sloan Hopkins, comedians such as Tommy Davidson as Womack &quot;Sleep &#x27;n Eat&quot; and Paul Mooney as Junebug, and hip hop artists such as Yasiin Bey formerly known as Mos Def as Julius &quot;Big Blak Afrika&quot; Hopkins and The Roots as the Alabama Porchmonkeys. Lee&#x27;s use of popular celebrities as satirical stock characters challenged long-held stereotypes of Black people in mainstream popular culture from novels to the screen. Casting hip-hop artists also allowed the filmmaker to allude to the role of negative stereotyping gangsta rap in the early aughts: &quot;Spike Lee says in the DVD commentary [about &quot;Bamboozled&quot;] that gangsta rap is a kind of stereotype that doesn&#x27;t advance the interests of blacks. He reiterated this position at his talk at Northeastern.&quot;

&quot;Bamboozled&quot; challenges notions of &quot;Uncle Toming&quot; or &quot;acting white&quot; as well as demonstrating the concept of double-consciousness coined by the notable sociologist W. E. B. Du Bois in his book &quot;The Souls of Black Folk&quot; (1903).

Also see the Emmy Award-winning 1987 documentary film Ethnic Notions by Black gay filmmaker Marlon Riggs narrated by actor Esther Rolle. The documentary narrates the history and legacy of the dehumanizing effects of African-American stereotypes and racializing caricatures from the &quot;Loyal Uncle Tom&quot; to grinning fools (see Stepin Fetchit) in cartoons, minstrel shows, advertisements, household artifacts, and even children&#x27;s rhymes.

<text>Garrett Park is a town in Montgomery County, Maryland, United States. It was named after a former president of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, Robert W. Garrett. The population was 996 at the 2020 census. Garrett Park is home to Garrett Park Elementary School, located just outside the town proper.

== History ==

Garrett Park was an early planned community, originally promoted by businessman Henry W. Copp, who purchased the land in 1886. Copp wanted to build a suburban development reminiscent of an English village, and even went so far as to name the streets after locations in the novels of the English author Walter Scott, such as Kenilworth and Strathmore. Copp worked in conjunction with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, which in 1893 built a train station. Builders were given reduced rates to transport workers and materials to the town site, and new residents were given free trips to move in. The town lies along the former B&amp;O railway corridor (now used by CSX, Amtrak, and MARC). It was named for John Work Garrett, who had led the B&amp;O for nearly three decades, including during the American Civil War. Copp limited commercial development in the community. Today the town has a four-star restaurant, post office, and farmer&#x27;s market.

Garrett Park incorporated as a town in 1898, at which time it had thirty buildings and approximately 100 residents. However, rail suburbs did not catch on, and the community stagnated as automobiles replaced commuter trains and streetcars. In the 1920s, another company built approximately 50 more houses, now including garages. Sections of the town are included in the Garrett Park Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. For example, Garrett Park&#x27;s first school house, designed in 1928 by prominent local architect Howard Wright Cutler and now preserved as part of a residential home, is a designated historic site by the Maryland Historical Trust.
In 1977, the town became a declared arboretum, maintaining a tree inventory of all town trees and a scheduled tree planting schedule. In May 1982 the townspeople of Garrett Park voted 245 to 46 to ban the production, transportation, storage, processing, disposal, or use of nuclear weapons within the town. This made Garrett Park the first nuclear-weapon-free zone in the United States.

== Law and government ==

The Garrett Park Chapel was purchased by the town in 1968, and now serves as the town hall. Its form of government follows a strong-mayor structure as defined by the following characteristics specified in the town charter: the mayor and council members are elected separately by the residents and hold separate and distinct powers and functions of town governance. The mayor serves as chief executive officer and oversees the administrative operations of the town government, responsible for executing the town&#x27;s budget and operations. The mayor appoints with approval by the council a clerk-treasurer, whose role as chief financial officer is responsible for formulating the town&#x27;s fiscal year budget under supervision of the mayor for council review and adoption.

The council is the legislative body, comprising five elected officials. Each council member is elected for a two–year term, with two members elected in even-numbered years, three in odd-numbered years. As the legislative body, the council sets policy by ordinance or resolution and adopts the annual budget by approving the allocation of appropriated funds by ordinance. All executive powers of the town are vested in the mayor, who is elected separately by the town residents (in the even-numbered years) and also serves a two-year term.

<text>John Eager Howard (June 4, 1752October 12, 1827) was an American soldier and politician from Maryland. He was elected as governor of the state in 1788, and served three one-year terms. He also was elected to the Continental Congress, the Congress of the Confederation, the United States Senate, and the Maryland Senate. In the 1816 presidential election, Howard received 22 electoral votes for vice president on the Federalist Party ticket with Rufus King; the ticket lost to Democratic-Republicans James Monroe and Daniel D. Tompkins in a landslide.

Howard County, Maryland, is named for him, as are three streets in Baltimore. For seven days in November 1800, Howard was president pro tempore of the Senate.

==Early life and education==
John Eager Howard was the son of Cornelius Howard and Ruth (Eager) Howard, of the Maryland planter elite and was born at their plantation &quot;The Forest&quot; in Baltimore County, Maryland. Howard grew up in an Anglican slaveholding family.

Howard joined a Baltimore lodge of Freemasons.

==Military career==
Commissioned a captain at the beginning of the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), Howard rose in 1777 to the rank of colonel in the Maryland Line of the Continental Army, fighting in the Battle of White Plains in 1776 and in the Battle of Monmouth in 1778. He was awarded a silver medal by the Confederation Congress for his leadership at the Battle of Cowpens in 1781, during which he commanded the 2nd Maryland Regiment. In September 1781, he was wounded in a bayonet charge at the Battle of Eutaw Springs. Major General Nathanael Greene wrote that Howard was &quot;as good an officer as the world affords. He has great ability and the best disposition to promote the service...He deserves a statue of gold.&quot;

At the conclusion of the war, Colonel Howard was admitted as an original member of the Society of the Cincinnati of Maryland. He went on to serve as the vice president (1795–1804) and president (1804–1827) of the Society in Maryland.

==Political life==
Following his army service, Howard held several electoral political positions: elected to the Confederation Congress in 1788; fifth Governor of Maryland for three one-year terms from 1788 through 1791; later as State Senator from 1791 through 1795; and elector in the presidential election of 1792. He declined an offer from George Washington in 1795 to serve as Secretary of War. He subsequently joined the newly organized Federalist Party and was elected to the Senate of the Fourth Congress by the General Assembly of Maryland to serve the remainder of the term of Richard Potts, who had resigned. He was elected to a Senate term of his own in 1797, serving until March 3, 1803, and briefly served as president pro tempore of the Senate in November 1800. While in Congress, he was the sole Federalist to vote against the Sedition Act.

In 1798, amidst rising tensions with France, Howard declined a commission as brigadier general in the United States Army.

At the end of his Senate term in 1803, Howard returned to Baltimore, where he avoided elected office but continued in public service and philanthropy. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1815. In the 1816 presidential election, he received 22 electoral votes for Vice President as the running mate of Federalist Rufus King, losing to Democratic-Republican candidates James Monroe and Daniel D. Tompkins in a landslide. No formal Federalist nomination had been made, and it is not clear whether Howard himself, who was one of several Federalists who received electoral votes for vice president, actually wanted to run.

Howard developed property in the city of Baltimore and was active in city planning. His house was constructed north of the city, in what later became the Mount Vernon neighborhood, where he owned slaves.

==Marriage and family==

Howard married Margaret (&quot;Peggy&quot;) Chew (1760–1824), daughter of Pennsylvania Supreme Court justice Benjamin Chew, in 1787. They had nine children:
*John Eager Howard Jr. (1788–1822), Maryland State Senator.
*George Howard, Governor of Maryland.
*Benjamin Chew Howard (1791–1872), US Representative and Reporter of Decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States.
*Dr. William Howard (1793–1834), civil engineer for the War Department.
*Juliana Howard McHenry (1796–1821)
*James Howard (1797–1870)
*Sophia Howard Read (1800–1880)
*Charles Howard (1802–1869)
*Mary (February–May 1806)

==Death and legacy==
Howard died in 1827. He is buried at Old Saint Paul&#x27;s Cemetery in Baltimore.
*Howard County, Maryland, was named for Howard.
*In 1904, the city of Baltimore commissioned an equestrian statue of Howard by Emmanuel Frémiet and installed it at Washington Place in Mount Vernon.
*The former Maryland state song &quot;Maryland, My Maryland&quot; refers to &quot;Howard&#x27;s war-like thrust&quot;.
*Three streets in Baltimore are named for Howard: John Street, Eager Street, and Howard Street.
