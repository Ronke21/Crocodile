<text>Dudley Stuart John Moore CBE (19 April 193527 March 2002) was an English actor, comedian, musician and composer. He first came to prominence in the UK as a leading figure in the British satire boom of the 1960s. He was one of the four writer-performers in the comedy revue &quot;Beyond the Fringe&quot; from 1960 that created a boom in satirical comedy. With a member of that team, Peter Cook, Moore collaborated on the BBC television series &quot;Not Only... But Also&quot;. In their popular double act, Moore&#x27;s buffoonery contrasted with Cook&#x27;s deadpan monologues. They jointly received the 1966 British Academy Television Award for Best Entertainment Performance and worked together on other projects until the mid-1970s, by which time Moore had settled in Los Angeles, California, to concentrate on his film acting.

Moore&#x27;s career as a comedy film actor was marked by hit films, particularly &quot;Bedazzled&quot; (1967), set in Swinging Sixties London (in which he co-starred with Cook) and Hollywood productions &quot;Foul Play&quot; (1978), &quot;10&quot; (1979) and &quot;Arthur&quot; (1981). For &quot;Arthur&quot;, Moore was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor and won a Golden Globe Award. He received a second Golden Globe for his performance in &quot;Micki &amp; Maude&quot; (1984). Moore was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1987 and was made a CBE by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace on 16 November 2001 in what was his last public appearance.

==Early life==
Moore was born at the original Charing Cross Hospital in central London, the son of Ada Francis (née Hughes), a secretary, and John Moore, a railway electrician from Glasgow.
He had an older sister, Barbara. Moore was brought up in the Becontree estate in Dagenham, Essex. He was short at and had club feet that required extensive hospital treatment. This made him the butt of jokes from other children. His right foot responded well to corrective treatment by the time he was six, but his left foot was permanently twisted and his left leg below the knee was withered. He remained self-conscious about this throughout his life.

Moore became a chorister at the age of six. When he was 11 years old, he earned a scholarship to the Guildhall School of Music, where he took up harpsichord, organ, violin, musical theory and composition. He rapidly developed into a highly talented pianist and organist and was playing the organ at local church weddings by the age of 14. He attended Dagenham County High School, where he received dedicated musical tuition from Peter Cork (1926–2012), who helped him towards his Oxford music scholarship. (Norma Winstone was another student of Cork&#x27;s at Dagenham). Cork was also a composer. Moore kept in touch until the mid-1990s and his letters to Cork were published in 2006.

In 1955 Moore won an organ scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, where he was tutored by the composer Bernard Rose and from where he graduated in 1958. While studying music and composition there, he also performed with Alan Bennett in The Oxford Revue. During his university years, Moore developed a love of jazz music and became an accomplished jazz pianist and composer. He began working with musicians such as John Dankworth and Cleo Laine. In 1960, Moore left Dankworth&#x27;s band to work on &quot;Beyond the Fringe&quot;.

==Career==

===&quot;Beyond the Fringe&quot;===

John Bassett, a graduate of Wadham College, Oxford recommended Moore, his jazz bandmate and a rising cabaret talent, to producer Robert Ponsonby, who was putting together a comedy revue entitled &quot;Beyond the Fringe&quot;. Bassett also chose Jonathan Miller. Moore then recommended Alan Bennett, who in turn suggested Peter Cook.

&quot;Beyond the Fringe&quot; was at the forefront of the 1960s UK satire boom, although the show&#x27;s original runs in Edinburgh and the provinces in 1960 had had a lukewarm response. When the revue transferred to the Fortune Theatre in London, in a revised production by Donald Albery and William Donaldson, it became a sensation, thanks in some part to a favourable review by Kenneth Tynan. There were also a number of musical items in the show, using Dudley Moore&#x27;s music, most famously an arrangement of the Colonel Bogey March in the style of Beethoven, which Moore appears unable to bring to an end.

In 1962 the show transferred to the John Golden Theatre in New York, with its original cast. President John F. Kennedy attended a performance on 10 February 1963. The show continued in New York until 1964.

===Partnership with Peter Cook===
When Moore returned to the UK he was offered his own series on the BBC, &quot;Not Only... But Also&quot; (1965, 1966, 1970). It was commissioned specifically as a vehicle for Moore, but when he invited Peter Cook on as a guest, their comedy partnership was so notable that it became a permanent fixture of the series. Cook and Moore are most remembered for their sketches as two working-class men, Pete and Dud, in macs and cloth caps, commenting on politics and the arts, but they also fashioned a series of one-off characters, usually with Moore in the role of interviewer to one of Cook&#x27;s upper-class eccentrics.

The pair developed an unorthodox method for scripting the material, using a tape recorder to tape an ad-libbed routine that they would then have transcribed and edited. This would not leave enough time to fully rehearse the script, so they often had a set of cue cards. Moore was famous for &quot;corpsing&quot; so, as the programmes often went out live, Cook would deliberately make him laugh in order to get an even bigger reaction from the studio audience. The BBC wiped much of the series, though some of the soundtracks (which were issued on LP record) have survived. In 1968 Cook and Moore briefly switched to ATV for four one-hour programmes entitled &quot;Goodbye Again&quot;; however, they were not as critically well-received as the BBC shows.

On film, Moore and Cook appeared in the 1966 British comedy film &quot;The Wrong Box&quot;, before co-writing and co-starring in &quot;Bedazzled&quot; (1967) with Eleanor Bron. Set in Swinging London of the 1960s, &quot;Bedazzled&quot; was directed by Stanley Donen. The pair closed the decade with appearances in the ensemble caper film &quot;Monte Carlo or Bust&quot; and Richard Lester&#x27;s &quot;The Bed Sitting Room&quot;, based on the play by Spike Milligan and John Antrobus. In 1968 and 1969 Moore embarked on two solo comedy ventures, firstly in the film &quot;30 is a Dangerous Age, Cynthia&quot; and secondly, on stage, for an Anglicised adaptation of Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Play It Again, Sam&quot; at the Globe Theatre in London&#x27;s West End.
In the 1970s, the relationship between Moore and Cook became increasingly strained as the latter&#x27;s alcoholism began affecting his work. In 1971, however, Cook and Moore took sketches from &quot;Not Only...But Also&quot; and &quot;Goodbye Again&quot;, together with new material, to create the stage revue &quot;Behind the Fridge&quot;. This show toured Australia and New Zealand in 1971 and ran in London&#x27;s west end between 1972 and 1973 before transferring to New York City in 1973, re-titled &quot;Good Evening&quot;. Cook frequently appeared inebriated, on and off stage. Nonetheless, the show proved very popular and it won Tony and Grammy Awards.

When the Broadway run of &quot;Good Evening&quot; ended, Moore stayed on in the U.S. to pursue his film acting ambitions in Hollywood, but the pair reunited to host &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on 24 January 1976 during SNL&#x27;s first season. They performed a number of their classic stage routines, including &quot;One Leg Too Few&quot; and &quot;Frog and Peach&quot;, among others, in addition to participating in some skits with the show&#x27;s ensemble.

It was during the Broadway run of &quot;Good Evening&quot; that Cook persuaded Moore to take the humour of Pete and Dud further on long-playing records as Derek and Clive. Chris Blackwell circulated bootleg copies to friends in the music business and the popularity of the recording convinced Cook to release it commercially as &quot;Derek and Clive (Live)&quot; (1976). Two further &quot;Derek and Clive&quot; albums, &quot;Derek and Clive Come Again&quot; (1977) and &quot;Derek and Clive Ad Nauseam&quot; (1978), were later released. The latter was also filmed for a documentary, &quot;Derek and Clive Get the Horn&quot;. In the film it is clear tensions between the two men were at a breaking point, with Moore at one point walking out of the recording room singing, &#x27;Breaking up is so easy to do.&#x27; In 2009, it came to light that, at the time, there were attempts to have them prosecuted under obscenity laws for their &quot;Derek and Clive&quot; comedy recordings.

The last significant appearance for the partnership was in 1978&#x27;s &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot;, where Moore played Dr. Watson to Cook&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes, as well as three other roles: in drag; as a one-legged man; and at the start and end of the film as a flamboyant and mischievous pianist. He also wrote the film&#x27;s score. Co-star Terry-Thomas described it as &quot;the most outrageous film I ever appeared in ... there was no magic ... it was bad!&quot;. The film was not a success, either critically or financially.

Moore and Cook eventually reunited for the annual American benefit for the homeless, &quot;Comic Relief&quot;, in 1987, and again in 1989 for a British audience at the Amnesty International benefit &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Biggest Ball&quot;.

Moore was deeply affected by the death of Cook in 1995, and for weeks would regularly telephone Cook&#x27;s home in London, just to hear his friend&#x27;s voice on the telephone answering machine. Moore attended Cook&#x27;s memorial service in London and, at the time, many people who knew him noted that Moore was behaving strangely and attributed it to grief or drinking. In November 1995, Moore teamed up with friend and humorist Martin Lewis in organising a two-day salute to Cook in Los Angeles that Moore co-hosted with Lewis.

In December 2004 the Channel 4 television station in the United Kingdom broadcast &quot;Not Only But Always&quot;, a TV film dramatising the relationship between Moore and Cook, although most of the attention of the production was directed towards Cook. Around the same time, the relationship between the two was also the subject of a stage play called &quot;Pete and Dud: Come Again&quot; by Chris Bartlett and Nick Awde. For this production Moore is the main subject. Set in a chat-show studio in the 1980s, it concerns Moore&#x27;s comic and personal relationship with Cook and the directions their careers took after the split of the partnership.

===Music===
During the 1960s Moore formed the Dudley Moore Trio, with drummer Chris Karan and bassist Pete McGurk. Following McGurk&#x27;s suicide in June 1968, Peter Morgan joined the group as his replacement.

Moore&#x27;s admitted principal musical influences were Oscar Peterson and Erroll Garner. In an interview he recalled the day he finally mastered Garner&#x27;s unique left-hand strum and was so excited that he walked around for several days with his left hand constantly playing that cadence. His early recordings included &quot;My Blue Heaven&quot;, &quot;Lysie Does It&quot;, &quot;Poova Nova&quot;, &quot;Take Your Time&quot;, &quot;Indiana&quot;, &quot;Sooz Blooz&quot;, &quot;Baubles, Bangles &amp; Beads&quot;, &quot;Sad One for George&quot; and &quot;Autumn Leaves&quot;. The trio performed regularly on British television, made numerous recordings and had a long-running residency at Peter Cook&#x27;s London nightclub, the Establishment. Amongst other albums, they recorded &quot;The Dudley Moore Trio&quot;, &quot;Dudley Moore plays The Theme from Beyond the Fringe and All That Jazz&quot;, &quot;The World of Dudley Moore&quot;, &quot;The Other Side Of Dudley Moore&quot; and &quot;Genuine Dud&quot;.

Moore was a close friend of record producer Chris Gunning and played piano (uncredited) on the 1969 single &quot;Broken Hearted Pirates&quot; which Gunning produced for Simon Dupree and the Big Sound. In 1976 he played piano on Larry Norman&#x27;s album &quot;In Another Land&quot;, in particular on the song &quot;The Sun Began to Rain&quot;. In 1981 he recorded &quot;Smilin&#x27; Through&quot; with Cleo Laine.

He composed the soundtracks for the films &quot;Bedazzled&quot; (1967), &quot;30 is a Dangerous Age, Cynthia&quot; (1968), &quot;Inadmissible Evidence&quot; (1968), &quot;Staircase&quot; (1969), &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; (1978) and &quot;Six Weeks&quot; (1982), among others.

===Later career in film, television and music===
In the late 1970s Moore moved to Hollywood, where he had a supporting role in the hit film &quot;Foul Play&quot; (1978) with Goldie Hawn and Chevy Chase. The following year saw his breakout role in Blake Edwards&#x27;s &quot;10&quot;, which became one of the biggest box-office hits of 1979 and gave him an unprecedented status as a romantic leading man. Moore followed up with the comedy film &quot;Wholly Moses!&quot;, which was not a major success.

In 1981 Moore appeared in the title role of the comedy &quot;Arthur&quot;, an even bigger hit than &quot;10&quot;. Co-starring Liza Minnelli and Sir John Gielgud, it was both commercially and critically successful, Moore receiving an Oscar nomination for Best Actor, while Gielgud won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role as Arthur&#x27;s stern but compassionate manservant. Moore lost to Henry Fonda (for &quot;On Golden Pond&quot;). He did, however, win a Golden Globe award for Best Actor in a Musical/Comedy. In the same year, on British television, Moore was the featured guest subject on &quot;An Audience With...&quot;.

His subsequent films, &quot;Six Weeks&quot; (1982), &quot;Lovesick&quot; (1983), &quot;Romantic Comedy&quot; (1983) and &quot;Unfaithfully Yours&quot; (1984) were only moderate successes. He won another Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Musical/Comedy in 1984, starring in the Blake Edwards directed &quot;Micki &amp; Maude&quot;, co-starring Amy Irving.

Later films, including &quot;Best Defense&quot; (1984), &quot;Santa Claus: The Movie&quot; (1985), &quot;Like Father Like Son&quot; (1987), &quot;Arthur 2: On the Rocks&quot; (1988), a sequel to the original, &quot;Crazy People&quot; (1990), &quot;Blame It on the Bellboy&quot; (1992) and an animated adaptation of &quot;King Kong&quot;, were inconsistent in terms of both critical and commercial reception. Moore eventually disowned the &quot;Arthur&quot; sequel, but, in later years, Cook would tease him by claiming he preferred &quot;Arthur 2: On the Rocks&quot; to &quot;Arthur&quot;.

In 1986 he once again hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, albeit without Peter Cook this time.

Moore was the subject of the British &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;, for a second time, in March 1987 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at his Venice Beach restaurant; he had previously been honoured by the programme in December 1972.

In addition to acting, Moore continued to work as a composer and pianist, writing scores for a number of films and giving piano concerts, among the highlights of which were his popular parodies of classical favourites. He appeared as Ko-Ko in Jonathan Miller&#x27;s production of &quot;The Mikado&quot; in Los Angeles in March 1988. He appeared on Kenny G&#x27;s music video &quot;Against Doctor&#x27;s Orders&quot; from the album &quot;Silhouette&quot;.

In 1991 he released the album &quot;Songs Without Words&quot; and in 1992 &quot;Live From an Aircraft Hangar&quot;, recorded at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall.

He collaborated with the conductor Sir Georg Solti in 1991 to create a Channel 4 television series, &quot;Orchestra!&quot;, which was designed to introduce audiences to the symphony orchestra. He later worked with the American conductor Michael Tilson Thomas on a similar television series, &quot;Concerto!&quot; (1993), likewise designed to introduce audiences to classical music concertos.

Moore appeared in two series for CBS, &quot;Dudley&quot; (1993) and &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Girls&quot; (1994); however, both were cancelled before the end of their run.

Moore had been interviewed for the &quot;New York Times&quot; in 1987 by the music critic Rena Fruchter, herself an accomplished pianist, and the two became close friends. By 1995 Moore&#x27;s film career was on the wane and he was having trouble remembering his lines, a problem he had never previously encountered. It was for this reason he was sacked from Barbra Streisand&#x27;s film &quot;The Mirror Has Two Faces&quot;. However, his difficulties were, in fact, due to the onset of the medical condition that eventually led to his death. Opting to concentrate on the piano, he enlisted Fruchter as an artistic partner. They performed as a duo in the US and Australia. However, his disease soon started to make itself apparent there as well, as his fingers would not always do what he wanted them to do. Further symptoms such as slurred speech and loss of balance were misinterpreted by the public and the media as a sign of drunkenness. Moore himself was at a loss to explain this. He moved into Fruchter&#x27;s family home in New Jersey and stayed there for five years; however, this placed a great strain both on her marriage and her friendship with Moore, and she later set him up in the house next door.

== Restaurant ==
Tony Bill and Dudley Moore founded a restaurant in 1983 (closed in November 2000), 72 Market Street Oyster Bar and Grill, in Venice, California.

==Personal life==
Moore was married and divorced four times: to actresses Suzy Kendall (15 June 1968 – 15 September 1972); Tuesday Weld (20 September 1975 – 18 July 1980), with whom he had a son, Patrick, on 26 February 1976; Brogan Lane (21 February 1988 – 1991); and Nicole Rothschild (16 April 1994 – 1998), with whom he had a son, Nicholas, on 28 June 1995.

In 1994, Moore was arrested and charged with domestic assault after allegedly assaulting his then-girlfriend and soon-to-be wife, Nicole Rothschild.

He maintained good relationships with Kendall, Weld, and Lane. He expressly forbade Rothschild from attending his funeral, however, since at the time his illness became apparent, he was going through a difficult divorce with her, while still sharing a Los Angeles house with her and her previous husband.

==Illness and death==
In April 1997, after spending five days in a New York hospital, Moore was informed that he had calcium deposits in the basal ganglia of his brain and irreversible frontal lobe damage. He underwent quadruple coronary artery bypass surgery in London and also suffered four strokes.

On 30 September 1999, Moore announced that he was suffering from the terminal degenerative brain disorder progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), a Parkinson-plus syndrome,
some of the early symptoms being so similar to intoxication that he had been reported as being drunk, and that the illness had been diagnosed earlier in the year. In November 1999, Moore made his first public appearance since disclosing his illness, reading poetry, alongside Julie Andrews, at a benefit concert in Philadelphia for the charity &quot;Music for All Seasons&quot;. At first Moore struggled, but soon he settled in and began to joke and ad-lib. He then received a standing ovation, for what was to be his last performance. His disease would quickly progress, eventually requiring him to use a wheelchair.

Moore died on the morning of 27 March 2002 as a result of pneumonia, secondary to immobility caused by his PSP, in Plainfield, New Jersey, at the age of 66. Rena Fruchter was holding his hand when he died; she reported his final words were &quot;I can hear the music all around me.&quot; Moore was interred at Hillside Cemetery in Scotch Plains, New Jersey. Fruchter later wrote a memoir of their relationship titled &quot;Dudley Moore&quot; (Ebury Press, 2004).

==Honours and awards==
In 1981, Moore won the Golden Globe for Best Actor for his role in &quot;Arthur&quot;, for which he was also Oscar-nominated. In November 2001, Moore was appointed a Commander of the Order of The British Empire (CBE). Despite his deteriorating condition, he attended the ceremony at Buckingham Palace on 16 November to collect his honour in a wheelchair. It was his last public appearance.

<text>Louis II (; ; ; ; 1 July 1506 – 29 August 1526) was King of Hungary, Croatia and Bohemia from 1516 to 1526. He died during the Battle of Mohács fighting the Ottomans, whose victory led to the Ottoman annexation of large parts of Hungary.

== Early life ==
At his premature birth in Buda on 1 July 1506, the court doctors kept him alive by slaying animals and wrapping him in their warm carcasses as a primitive incubator. He was the only son of Vladislaus II Jagiellon and his third wife, Anne of Foix-Candale.

==Coronation==
Vladislaus II took steps to ensure a smooth succession by arranging for the boy to be crowned in his own lifetime; the coronation of Louis as king of Hungary took place on 4 June 1508 in Székesfehérvár Basilica, and his coronation as king of Bohemia was held on 11 March 1509 in St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague.

=== King of Hungary and Croatia ===

In 1515 Louis II was married to Mary of Austria, granddaughter of Emperor Maximilian I, as stipulated by the First Congress of Vienna in 1515. His sister Anne was married to Mary&#x27;s brother Ferdinand, then a governor on behalf of his brother Charles V, and later Emperor Ferdinand I.
During the greater part of his reign he was the puppet of the magnates and kept in such penury that he was often obliged to pawn his jewels to get enough food and clothing. His guardians, Cardinal Tamás Bakócz and Count George Brandenburg-Ansbach, shamefully neglected him, squandered the royal revenues and distracted the whole kingdom with their endless dissensions. Matters grew even worse on the death of Cardinal Bakócz, when the magnates István Báthory, John Zápolya and István Werbőczy fought each other furiously, and used the diets as their tools.

=== King of Bohemia===
As king of Bohemia, Louis became known as &quot;Ludovicus the Child&quot;. The first thaler coins were minted during his reign in Bohemia, later giving the name to the dollars used in different countries. These correctly style him as &quot;LVDOVICVS•PRIM•D:GRACIA•REX•BO*&quot; (Louis the First, by the grace of God King of Bohemia).

== War with the Ottomans ==

After his father&#x27;s death in 1516, the minor Louis II ascended to the throne of Hungary and Croatia. Louis was adopted by the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I in 1515. When Maximilian I died in 1519, Louis&#x27;s cousin George, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach, became his legal guardian.

Following the accession to the Ottoman throne of Suleiman I, the sultan sent Behram Çavuş as an ambassador to Louis II to collect the annual tribute that Hungary had been subjected to, and Louis refused to pay. According to some accounts, he also had the Ottoman ambassador executed and sent the head to the Sultan, but there is no evidence for this. Rather, Çavuş was kept waiting years, virtually imprisoned in Buda, by way of revenge for Suleiman&#x27;s father, Selim I, who from 1513 to 1519 had forced the Hungarian envoy Barnabás Bélayban, Ban of Serim, to travel with him on his campaigns into Persia and Egypt, and to find time to ask for financial help from western countries against the Ottomans. Louis believed that the Papal States and other Christian States including Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, would help him. This hastened the fall of Hungary.

Hungary was in a state of near anarchy in 1520 under the rule of the magnates. The king&#x27;s finances were a shambles; he borrowed to meet his household expenses despite the fact that they totaled about one-third of the national income. The country&#x27;s defenses weakened as border guards went unpaid, fortresses fell into disrepair, and initiatives to increase taxes to reinforce defenses were stifled. By 1521 Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent was well aware of Hungary&#x27;s weakness.

The Ottoman Empire declared war on the Kingdom of Hungary, Suleiman postponed his plan to besiege Rhodes and made an expedition to Belgrade. Louis and his wife Mary requested military aid from other European countries. His uncle, King Sigismund of Poland, and his brother-in-law, Archduke Ferdinand, were willing to help. Ferdinand dispatched 3,000 infantry troops and some artillery while preparing to mobilize the Austrian estates, while Sigismund promised to send footmen. The coordination process totally failed though. Mary, although a determined leader, caused distrust by relying on non-Hungarian advisors while Louis lacked vigour, which his nobles realized. The Austrian military aid, although seemingly strengthening the border, even had the undesired effect of dissolving the unified leadership that the &quot;ban&quot; had held until that time. 

Belgrade and many strategic castles in Serbia were captured by the Ottomans. This was disastrous for Louis&#x27; kingdom; without the strategically important cities of Belgrade and Šabac, Hungary, including Buda, was open to further Turkish conquests.

After the siege of Rhodes, in 1526 Suleiman made a second expedition to subdue all of Hungary. 
Around the middle of July, the young King departed from Buda, determined to &quot;either fight back the invaders or be crushed once and for all&quot;. Louis made a tactical error when he tried to stop the Ottoman army in an open field battle with a medieval army, insufficient firearms, and obsolete tactics. On 29 August 1526, Louis led his forces against Suleiman in the disastrous Battle of Mohács. The Hungarian army was surrounded by Ottoman cavalry in a pincer movement, and in the center the Hungarian heavy knights and infantry were repulsed and suffered heavy casualties, especially from the well-positioned Ottoman cannons and well-armed and trained Janissary musketeers.

Nearly the entire Hungarian Royal army was destroyed in nearly 2 hours on the battlefield. During the retreat, the twenty-year-old king died when he fell backwards off his horse while trying to ride up a steep ravine of the Csele stream. He fell into the stream and, due to the weight of his armor, he was unable to stand up and drowned. Suleiman the Magnificent expressed regret at the death of his young adversary. Upon encountering the lifeless body of King Louis, the Sultan is said to have lamented: &quot;I came indeed in arms against him; but it was not my wish that he should be thus cut off before he scarcely tasted the sweets of life and royalty.&quot;

After the death of Louis, Ferdinand (as husband to Louis&#x27; sister Anna), contested for the crown of Bohemia and Hungary. His bid for Hungary split the opinion of the magnates, with the majority electing John Zápolya. This split would later cause the majority of Hungary to be ruled under the Ottomans.

== Jagiellons bloodline ==
Although Louis II&#x27;s marriage remained childless, he probably had an illegitimate child with his mother&#x27;s former lady-in-waiting, Angelitha Wass. This son was called John (János in Hungarian). This name appears in sources in Vienna as either János Wass or János Lanthos. The former surname is his mother&#x27;s maiden name. The latter surname may refer to his occupation. &quot;Lanthos&quot; means &quot;lutenist&quot;, or &quot;bard&quot;. He received incomes from the Royal Treasury regularly. He had further offspring.

==Legacy==

North of the town of Mohacs, there is a 5 meter high monument to the memory of Louis II. It is located near the site of Louis&#x27; death at the Csele Stream. On the monument there is a bronze plaque which depicts Louis falling off his horse. On the top of the monument there is a figure of a sleeping lion. Soma Turcsányi, a 
Hussar lieutenant, at his own expense, constructed the original commemorative column in 1864. It was reconstructed in 1897. The monument was restored by the local government in 1986.

<text>VistaVision is a higher resolution, widescreen variant of the 35 mm motion picture film format that was created by engineers at Paramount Pictures in 1954.

Paramount did not use anamorphic processes such as CinemaScope but refined the quality of its flat widescreen system by orienting the 35 mm negative horizontally in the camera gate and shooting onto a larger area, which yielded a finer-grained projection print.

As finer-grained film stocks appeared on the market, VistaVision became obsolete. Paramount dropped the format after only seven years, although for another 40 years the format was used by some European and Japanese producers for feature films and by American films such as the first three &quot;Star Wars&quot; films for high-resolution special-effects sequences.

In many ways, VistaVision was a testing ground for cinematography ideas that evolved into 70 mm IMAX and OMNIMAX film formats in the 1970s. Both IMAX and OMNIMAX are oriented sideways, as is VistaVision.

==History==
As a response to an industry recession caused largely by the popularity of television, the Hollywood studios turned to large-format films in order to regain audience attendance. In 1952, the anamorphic format Cinerama debuted in September, and consisted of three strips of 35 mm film projected side-by-side onto a giant, curved screen, augmented by seven channels of stereophonic sound. In 1953, Twentieth Century-Fox announced the introduction of a simpler version of Cinerama using anamorphic lenses instead of multiple film strips, a widescreen process later known as CinemaScope. 

By January 1953, Paramount Pictures decided to convert &quot;Sangaree&quot; (1953) into a 3D production, which had originally been filmed &quot;flat&quot; for the prior two weeks. When the film was screened for Paramount president Barney Balaban, he talked in length with Spyros Skouras, president of Twentieth Century-Fox, in which Balaban stated he had preferred the CinemaScope process. By the next month, Paramount Pictures devised its own system to augment its 3-D process, known as Paravision. This process utilized a screen size that yielded an aspect ratio of five units wide by three units high. The first film released by Paramount to use the Paravision process was &quot;Red Garters&quot; (1954). 

This &quot;flat&quot; widescreen process was adopted by other studios, and by the end of 1953, more than half of the theaters in the U.S. had installed wide screens. However, because a smaller portion of the image was used and magnification was increased, excessive grain and soft images plagued early widescreen presentations. Some studios sought to compensate for these effects by shooting color films with a full aperture gate (rather than the academy aperture) and then reducing the image in Technicolor&#x27;s optical printer. This process is a predecessor of today&#x27;s Super 35 format, which also uses a 1.85:1 ratio but one-third more frame area than does a standard 1.85:1 matted into a 4:3 ratio.

The idea behind VistaVision originated with John R. Bishop, the head of Paramount&#x27;s camera department. He had been impressed with the Cinerama process, although he took exception to the blow-up process. He told &quot;Popular Magazine&quot;: &quot;the negative is the bad boy. We simply can&#x27;t store enough detail in its small size. Sit close to the screen, and your eyes tire. Too fuzzy, too grainy.&quot; He became interested in projecting the widescreen image in sharp detail. He installed a Leica lens in a Mitchell Camera after remembering an abandoned two-frame color system developed by the William P. Stein Company that exposed both negatives to form a single projection image. Bishop turned the camera on its side and shot a film test which proved successful. In shooting in the VistaVision process, the film was run horizontally rather than vertically, and instead of exposing two simultaneous four-perforation frames, the entire eight perforations were used for one image. The negative frame area was approximated to be 1.472 x 0.997 inches. 

During its technical development, Paramount&#x27;s camera technicians dubbed this process the &quot;Lazy 8&quot; system, by which the term &quot;lazy&quot; stood for the horizontal film path, and &quot;8&quot; for the eight-sprocket image width. Paramount trade-named the process &quot;VistaVision&quot; early in 1954, and the first production to utilize the camera process was &quot;White Christmas&quot; (1954). The process afforded a wider aspect ratio of 1.5:1 versus the conventional 1.37:1 Academy ratio, and a much larger image area. In order to satisfy theaters with various screen sizes, VistaVision films were shot so that they could be shown in one of three recommended aspect ratios: 1.66:1, 1.85:1 and 2.00:1.

In its lead-up to &quot;White Christmas&quot;, Paramount Pictures&#x27; publicity department stressed the CinemaScope process was &quot;uncomfortably wide&quot;, in which their &quot;VistaVision&quot; process would emphasize that &quot;height is as important as width.&quot; By then, several theaters had been equipped with horizontal screen projectors for VistaVision&#x27;s eight-sprocket image frame. For theater exhibitors that were not equipped, an alternate 35 mm film print was used with a compatible sound system known as the &quot;Perspecta Stereo&quot;, encoded in the optical track. The VistaVision fanfare, heard in most of the films produced in this ratio, was composed by Nathan Van Cleave.

&quot;White Christmas&quot; held its West Coast premiere at the Warner Beverly Hills Theatre on October 27, 1954. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; detailed the VistaVision process was &quot;a simple innovation, but not easy to grasp&quot; by which they noted the &quot;enlargement and compression process gives the picture a depth of focus which enhances its clarity.&quot; Prior to its release, in March 1954, Paramount chief engineer Loren L. Ryder believed that VistaVision would become the forerunner of widescreen projection for the following reasons:
* VistaVision could be shown at widescreen aspect ratios between 1.66 and 2.00:1.
* VistaVision could be (and most often was) further printed down to standard vertical 35 mm reels, keeping its 1.66:1 widescreen aspect ratio, which meant that exhibitors did not need to purchase additional projection equipment, as was often required for CinemaScope.
* VistaVision did not force the elimination of seats in any theater (as did Cinerama, and CinemaScope at first).
* VistaVision allowed patrons to see more and therefore gain more enjoyment from a film.

Following the film&#x27;s release, Paramount reiterated its policy to have their standard film prints &quot;available to play in any theatre anywhere in the world with no requirement that the exhibitor alter [their] equipment in order to play a VistaVision picture.&quot; Subsequent Paramount films including &quot;Strategic Air Command&quot; (1955), &quot;To Catch a Thief&quot; (1955), &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much&quot; (1956), &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; (1956), &quot;Funny Face&quot; (1957), and &quot;Vertigo&quot; (1958) were filmed in VistaVision. Though it was not as prevalent as CinemaScope, rival studios adopted the VistaVision process, including MGM&#x27;s &quot;High Society&quot; (1956), Warner Bros.&#x27; &quot;The Searchers&quot; (1956), and United Artists&#x27; &quot;The Vikings&quot; (1958). 

By the late 1950s, VistaVision became obsolete with the industry preference for Panavision and more refinements in Eastmancolor film stock. Paramount produced their last Vistavision film, &quot;One-Eyed Jacks&quot; in 1961. By the 1960s, they adopted Technirama as its primary widescreen projection system. 

Since the last American VistaVision film, &quot;One-Eyed Jacks&quot; which began shooting in 1958 but was not released until 1961, the format would not be used as a primary imaging system for a feature film until 2024. However, VistaVision&#x27;s high resolution made it attractive for some special-effects work within some later feature films.

==Special-effects usage==

In 1975, a small group of artists and technicians (including Richard Edlund, who was to receive two Academy Awards for his work) revived the long-dormant format to create the special effects shots for George Lucas&#x27;s space epic &quot;Star Wars&quot;. A retooled VistaVision camera dubbed the Dykstraflex (named for special effects master John Dykstra) was used by the group (later called Industrial Light &amp; Magic) in complex process shots. For more than two decades after this, VistaVision was often used as an originating and intermediate format for shooting special effects because a larger negative area compensates against the increased grain created when shots are optically composited. By the early 21st century, computer-generated imagery, advanced film scanning, digital intermediate methods and film stocks with higher resolutions optimized for special effects work had together rendered VistaVision mostly obsolete even for special effects work. Nevertheless, in 2008, ILM was still using the format in some production steps, such as for &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot;, and a VistaVision camera was used in the semi-trailer flip scene in &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; because there were not enough IMAX cameras to cover all of the angles needed for the shot. In 2010, certain key sequences of the film &quot;Inception&quot; were shot in VistaVision, and in the film &quot;Scott Pilgrim vs. the World&quot;, shots that needed to be optically enlarged were shot in VistaVision.

==Technical specifications==
;VistaVision (8/35)
* Spherical lenses, usually adapted and remounted Leica full-frame Rangefinder camera lenses; SOM Berthiot made a special zoom just for VistaVision applications, but it saw very little use.
* Eight perforations per frame.
* Horizontal pulldown from right to left (viewed from emulsion side).
* Slightly less depth of field than that of vertical pulldown 35 mm.
* Camera aperture of 1.485 inches (37.72 mm) by 0.981 inches (24.92 mm).

==Films shot in VistaVision==
1954&#x27;s &quot;White Christmas&quot; was the first Paramount film to utilize the VistaVision method, but perhaps the most well-known film to be filmed completely in VistaVision format is Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s 1958 film &quot;Vertigo&quot;. &quot;One-Eyed Jacks&quot; in 1961 was the last Paramount film to be shot in the format, and &quot;My Six Loves&quot; in 1963 was the final American film filmed in the VistaVision process. The 1992 Disney release &quot;Newsies&quot; had at least one sequence filmed using a VistaVision camera, the one with the Brooklyn Bridge across the background. However the 21st century saw a revival of the format, with the release of &quot;The Brutalist&quot; in 2024 and &quot;One Battle After Another&quot; in 2025.

==Legacy==
The camera numbered VistaVision #1 that was used on Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; and several Alfred Hitchcock films was offered at auction on September 30, 2015 by Profiles in History with an estimated value of US$30,000 to $50,000, with a winning bid of US$65,000. Also offered at the same auction was VistaVision High Speed #1 (VVHS1), which was used to film the parting of the Red Sea in &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; and special effects for &quot;Star Wars&quot; (winning bid: US$60,000.)

The RED Monstro &amp; V-Raptor 8K VV sensors are modern incarnations of the VistaVision sensor. Cameras that utilize the Monstro sensor include the Red Ranger Monstro, DSMC2 Monstro and the Panavision Millennium DXL &amp; DXL2. Cameras that utilize the V-Raptor 8K VV sensor include the Red V-Raptor and the Red V-Raptor XL.

<text>A tuna (: tunas or tuna) is a saltwater fish that belongs to the tribe Thunnini, a subgrouping of the Scombridae (mackerel) family. The Thunnini comprise 15 species across five genera, the sizes of which vary greatly, ranging from the bullet tuna (max length: , weight: ) up to the Atlantic bluefin tuna (max length: , weight: ), which averages and is believed to live up to 50 years.

Tuna, opah, and mackerel sharks are the only species of fish that can maintain a body temperature higher than that of the surrounding water. An active and agile predator, the tuna has a sleek, streamlined body, and is among the fastest-swimming pelagic fish – the yellowfin tuna, for example, is capable of speeds of up to . Greatly inflated speeds can be found in early scientific reports and are still widely reported in the popular literature.

Found in warm seas, the tuna is commercially fished extensively as a food fish, and is popular as a bluewater game fish. As a result of overfishing, some tuna species, such as the southern bluefin tuna, are threatened with extinction.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;tuna&quot; comes from Spanish &quot;atún&quot; &lt; Andalusian Arabic &quot;at-tūn&quot;, assimilated from &quot;al-tūn&quot; [Modern Arabic ] : &#x27;tuna fish&#x27; &lt; Middle Latin &quot;thunnus&quot;. &quot;&quot; is derived from used for the Atlantic bluefin tuna, that name in turn is ultimately derived from &quot;thýnō&quot;, meaning &quot;to rush, dart along&quot;.

In English, tuna has been referred to as Chicken of the Sea. This name persists today in Japan, where tuna as a food can be called , literally &quot;sea chicken&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The Thunnini tribe is a monophyletic clade comprising 15 species in five genera:
:* family Scombridae
:** tribe Thunnini: tunas
:*** genus &quot;Allothunnus:&quot; slender tunas
:*** genus &quot;Auxis:&quot; frigate tunas
:*** genus &quot;Euthynnus:&quot; little tunas
:*** genus &quot;Katsuwonus:&quot; skipjack tunas
:*** genus &quot;Thunnus:&quot; albacores and true tunas
:**** subgenus &quot;Thunnus (Thunnus)&quot;: bluefin group
:**** subgenus &quot;Thunnus (Neothunnus)&quot;: yellowfin group

The cladogram is a tool for visualizing and comparing the evolutionary relationships between taxa, and is read left-to-right as if on a timeline. The following cladogram illustrates the relationship between the tunas and other tribes of the family Scombridae. For example, the cladogram illustrates that the skipjack tunas are more closely related to the true tunas than are the slender tunas (the most primitive of the tunas), and that the next nearest relatives of the tunas are the bonitos of the tribe Sardini.


===True species===

The &quot;true&quot; tunas are those that belong to the genus &quot;Thunnus&quot;. Until recently, it was thought that there were seven &quot;Thunnus&quot; species, and that Atlantic bluefin tuna and Pacific bluefin tuna were subspecies of a single species. In 1999, Collette established that based on both molecular and morphological considerations, they are in fact distinct species.

The genus &quot;Thunnus&quot; is further classified into two subgenera: &quot;Thunnus (Thunnus)&quot; (the bluefin group), and &quot;Thunnus (Neothunnus)&quot; (the yellowfin group).


===Other species===
The Thunnini tribe also includes seven additional species of tuna across four genera. They are:

==Biology==

=== Description ===
The tuna is a sleek, elongated and streamlined fish, adapted for speed. It has two closely spaced but separated dorsal fins on its back; The first fin is &quot;depressible&quot; – it can be laid down, flush, in a groove that runs along its back; it is supported by spines. Seven to ten yellow finlets run from the dorsal fins to the tail, which is lunate – curved like a crescent moon – and tapered to pointy tips. A tuna&#x27;s pelvic fins are located below the base of the pectoral fins. Both dorsal and pelvic fins retract when the fish is swimming fast.

The tuna&#x27;s body is countershaded to camouflage itself in deeper water when seen from above, its dorsal side is generally a metallic dark blue while the ventral or under side is silvery, often with an iridescent shine. The caudal peduncle, to which the tail is attached, is quite thin, with three stabilizing horizontal keels on each side.

===Physiology===
&quot;Thunnus&quot; are widely but sparsely distributed throughout the oceans of the world, generally in tropical and temperate waters at latitudes ranging between about 45° north and south of the equator. All tunas are able to maintain the temperature of certain parts of their body above the temperature of ambient seawater. For example, bluefin can maintain a core body temperature of , in water as cold as . Unlike other endothermic creatures such as mammals and birds, tuna do not maintain temperature within a relatively narrow range.

Tunas achieve endothermy by conserving the heat generated through normal metabolism. In all tunas, the heart operates at ambient temperature, as it receives cooled blood, and coronary circulation is directly from the gills. The &quot;rete mirabile&quot; (&quot;wonderful net&quot;), the intertwining of veins and arteries in the body&#x27;s periphery, allows nearly all of the metabolic heat from venous blood to be &quot;re-claimed&quot; and transferred to the arterial blood via a counter-current exchange system, thus mitigating the effects of surface cooling. This allows the tuna to elevate the temperatures of the highly-aerobic tissues of the skeletal muscles, eyes and brain, which supports faster swimming speeds and reduced energy expenditure, and which enables them to survive in cooler waters over a wider range of ocean environments than those of other fish.

Also unlike most fish, which have white flesh, the muscle tissue of tuna ranges from pink to dark red. The red myotomal muscles derive their color from myoglobin, an oxygen-binding molecule, which tuna express in quantities far higher than most other fish. The oxygen-rich blood further enables energy delivery to their muscles.

For powerful swimming animals like dolphins and tuna, cavitation may be detrimental, because it limits their maximum swimming speed. Even if they have the power to swim faster, dolphins may have to restrict their speed, because collapsing cavitation bubbles on their tail are too painful. Cavitation also slows tuna, but for a different reason. Unlike dolphins, these fish do not feel the bubbles, because they have bony fins without nerve endings. Nevertheless, they cannot swim faster because the cavitation bubbles create a vapor film around their fins that limits their speed. Lesions have been found on tuna that are consistent with cavitation damage.

==Fishing==


===Commerce===
Tuna is an important commercial fish. The International Seafood Sustainability Foundation (ISSF) compiled a detailed scientific report on the state of global tuna stocks in 2009, which includes regular updates. According to the ISSF, the most important species for commercial and recreational tuna fisheries are yellowfin (&quot;Thunnus albacares&quot;), bigeye (&quot;T. obesus&quot;), bluefin (&quot;T. thynnus&quot;, &quot;T. orientalis&quot;, and &quot;T. macoyii&quot;), albacore (&quot;T. alalunga&quot;), and skipjack (&quot;Katsuwonus pelamis&quot;).

Based on catches from 2007, the report states:
The Australian government alleged in 2006 that Japan had illegally overfished southern bluefin by taking 12,000 to 20,000 tonnes per year instead of the agreed upon 6,000 tonnes; the value of such overfishing would be as much as US$2 billion. Such overfishing has severely damaged bluefin stocks. According to the WWF, &quot;Japan&#x27;s huge appetite for tuna will take the most sought-after stocks to the brink of commercial extinction unless fisheries agree on more rigid quotas&quot;. Japan&#x27;s Fisheries Research Agency counters that Australian and New Zealand tuna fishing companies under-report their total catches of southern bluefin tuna and ignore internationally mandated total allowable catch totals.

In recent years, opening day fish auctions at Tokyo&#x27;s Tsukiji fish market and Toyosu Market have seen record-setting prices for bluefin tuna, reflecting market demand. In each of 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2019, new record prices have been set for a single fish – the current record is 333.6 million japanese yen (US$3.1 million) for a bluefin, or a unit price of JP¥ 1,200,000/kg (US$5,057/lb). The opening auction price for 2014 plummeted to less than 5% of the previous year&#x27;s price, which had drawn complaints for climbing &quot;way out of line&quot;. A summary of record-setting auctions are shown in the following table (highlighted values indicate new world records):

In November 2011, a different record was set when a fisherman in Massachusetts caught an tuna. It was captured inadvertently using a dragnet. Due to the laws and restrictions on tuna fishing in the United States, federal authorities impounded the fish because it was not caught with a rod and reel. Because of the tuna&#x27;s deteriorated condition as a result of the trawl net, the fish sold for just under $5,000.

===Methods===
Besides for edible purposes, many tuna species are caught frequently as game, often for recreation or for contests in which money is awarded based on weight. Larger specimens are notorious for putting up a fight while hooked, and have been known to injure people who try to catch them, as well as damage their equipment.

* Phoenician technique for trapping and catching Atlantic bluefin tuna called &quot;Almadraba&quot;, still used today in Portugal, Spain, Morocco and Italy which uses a maze of nets. In Sicily, the same method is called &quot;Tonnara&quot;.
* Fish farming (cage system)
* Tuna ranching
* Longline fishing
* Purse seines
* Pole and line
* Harpoon gun
* Big game fishing
* Fish aggregating device

===Association with whaling===
In 2005, Nauru, defending its vote from Australian criticism at that year&#x27;s meeting of the International Whaling Commission, argued that some whale species have the potential to devastate Nauru&#x27;s tuna stocks, and that Nauru&#x27;s food security and economy relies heavily on fishing. Despite this, Nauru does not permit whaling in its own waters and does not allow other fishing vessels to take or intentionally interact with marine mammals in its Exclusive Economic Zone. In 2010 and 2011, Nauru supported Australian proposals for a western Pacific-wide ban on tuna purse-seining in the vicinity of marine mammals – a measure which was agreed by the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission at its eighth meeting in March 2012.

===Association with dolphins===
Dolphins swim beside several tuna species. These include yellowfin tuna in the eastern Pacific Ocean, but not albacore. Tuna schools are believed to associate themselves with dolphins for protection against sharks, which are tuna predators.

Commercial fishing vessels used to exploit this association by searching for dolphin pods. Vessels would encircle the pod with nets to catch the tuna beneath. The nets were prone to entangling dolphins, injuring or killing them. Public outcry and new government regulations, which are now monitored by NOAA have led to more dolphin-friendly methods, now generally involving lines rather than nets. There are neither universal independent inspection programs nor verification of dolphin safety, so these protections are not absolute. According to Consumers Union, the resulting lack of accountability means claims of tuna that is &quot;dolphin safe&quot; should be given little credence.

Fishery practices have changed to be dolphin friendly, which has caused greater bycatch including sharks, turtles and other oceanic fish. Fishermen no longer follow dolphins, but concentrate their fisheries around floating objects such as fish aggregation devices, also known as FADs, which attract large populations of other organisms. Measures taken thus far to satisfy the public demand to protect dolphins can be potentially damaging to other species as well.

===Aquaculture===
Increasing quantities of high-grade tuna caught at sea are reared in net pens and fed bait fish. In Australia, former fishermen raise southern bluefin tuna (&quot;Thunnus maccoyii&quot;) and another bluefin species. Farming its close relative, the Atlantic bluefin tuna, &quot;Thunnus thynnus&quot;, is beginning in the Mediterranean, North America and Japan. Hawaii approved permits for the first U.S. offshore farming of bigeye tuna in water deep in 2009.

Japan is the biggest tuna consuming nation and is also the leader in tuna farming research. Japan first successfully farm-hatched and raised bluefin tuna in 1979. In 2002, it succeeded in completing the reproduction cycle and in 2007, completed a third generation. The farm breed is known as Kindai tuna. Kindai is the contraction of Kinki University in Japanese (Kinki daigaku). In 2009, Clean Seas, an Australian company which has been receiving assistance from Kinki University managed to breed southern bluefin tuna in captivity and was awarded the second place in World&#x27;s Best Invention of 2009 by &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

==Food==

===Fresh and frozen===
The fresh or frozen flesh of tuna is widely regarded as a delicacy in most areas where it is shipped, being prepared in a variety of ways. When served as a steak, the meat of most species is known for its thickness and firm texture. In the U.K., supermarkets began flying in fresh tuna steaks in the late 1990s, which helped to increase the popularity of using fresh tuna in cooking; by 2009, celebrity chefs regularly featured fresh tuna in salads, wraps, and char-grilled dishes.

====Served raw====
Various species of tuna are often served raw in Japanese cuisine as sushi or sashimi.

Commercial sashimi tuna may have their coloration fixated by pumping carbon monoxide (CO) into bags containing the tuna, and holding it at 4 °C. For a 2-inch tuna steak, this requires 24 hours. The fish is then vacuum sealed and frozen. In Japan, color fixation using CO is prohibited.

===Canned===

Tuna is canned in edible oils, in brine, in water, and in various sauces. Tuna may be processed and labeled as &quot;solid&quot;, &quot;chunked&quot; (&quot;chunk&quot;) or &quot;flaked&quot;. When tuna is canned and packaged for sale, the product is sometimes called tuna fish (U.S.), a calque (loan translation) from the German &quot;&quot;. Canned tuna is sometimes used as food for pets, especially cats.

;Australia
Canned tuna was first produced in Australia in 1903 and quickly became popular.

In the early 1980s canned tuna in Australia was most likely southern bluefin, it was usually yellowfin, skipjack, or tongol (labelled &quot;northern bluefin&quot; or &quot;longtail&quot;).

Australian standards once required cans of tuna to contain at least 51% tuna, but those regulations were dropped in 2003. The remaining weight is usually oil or water.

;United States
The product became more plentiful in the United States in the late 1940s. In 1950, 8,500,000 pounds of canned tuna were produced, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture classified it as a &quot;plentiful food&quot;.

In the United States, 52% of canned tuna is used for sandwiches; 22% for tuna salads; and 15% for tuna casseroles and dried, prepackaged meal kits, such as General Mills&#x27;s Tuna Helper line. Other canned tuna dishes include tuna melts (a type of sandwich where the tuna is mixed with mayonnaise and served on bread with cheese melted on top); salade niçoise (a salad made of tuna, olives, green beans, potatoes, hard-boiled eggs and anchovy dressing); and tuna burgers (served on buns).

In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates canned tuna (see part &quot;c&quot;).

;Precooked
As tunas are often caught far from where they are processed, poor interim conservation can lead to spoilage. Tuna is typically gutted by hand, and later precooked for prescribed times of 45 minutes to three hours. The fish are then cleaned and filleted, canned (and sealed), with the dark lateral blood meat often separately canned for pet food (cat or dog). The sealed can is then heated under pressure (called &quot;retort cooking&quot;) for 2–4 hours. This process kills any bacteria, but retains the histamine that may have been produced by those bacteria, and so may still taste spoiled. The international standard sets the maximum histamine level at 200 milligrams per kilogram. An Australian study of 53 varieties of unflavored canned tuna found none to exceed the safe histamine level, although some had &quot;off&quot; flavors.

;Light and white
In some markets, depending upon the color of the flesh of the tuna species, the can is marked as &quot;light&quot; or &quot;white&quot; meat, with &quot;light&quot; meaning a greyish pink color and &quot;white&quot; meaning a light pink color. In the United States, only albacore can legally be sold in canned form as &quot;white meat tuna&quot;; in other countries, yellowfin is also acceptable.

; Ventresca tuna
Ventresca tuna (from &quot;ventre&quot;, the Italian word for belly), is a luxury canned tuna, from the fatty bluefin tuna belly, also used in sushi as toro.

====Nutrition====
Canned light tuna in oil is 29% protein, 8% fat, 60% water, and contains no carbohydrates, while providing 200 calories in a 100 gram reference amount (table). It is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of phosphorus (44% DV) and vitamin D (45% DV), and a moderate source of iron (11% DV).

===Mercury and health===

Mercury content in tuna can vary widely. Among those calling for improved warnings about mercury in tuna is the American Medical Association, which adopted a policy that physicians should help make their patients more aware of the potential risks. A study published in 2008 found that mercury distribution in the meat of farmed tuna is inversely related to the lipid content, suggesting that higher lipid concentration within edible tissues of tuna raised in captivity might, other factors remaining equal, have a diluting effect on mercury content. Mackerel tuna is one species of tuna that is lower in mercury concentration than skipjack or yellowfin, but this species is known as &quot;black meat&quot; or &quot;dark meat&quot; tuna, which is a lower grade for canning because of the color, unfavorable flavor, and poor yield.

In March 2004, the United States FDA issued guidelines recommending that pregnant women, nursing mothers, and children limit their intake of tuna and other predatory fish. The Environmental Protection Agency provides guidelines on how much canned tuna is safe to eat. Roughly speaking, the guidelines recommend one can of light tuna per week for individuals weighing less than , and two cans per week for those who weigh more. In 2007, it was reported that some canned light tuna such as yellowfin tuna is significantly higher in mercury than skipjack, and caused Consumers Union and other activist groups to advise pregnant women to refrain from consuming canned tuna. In 2009, a California appeals court upheld a ruling that canned tuna does not need warning labels as the methylmercury is naturally occurring.

A January 2008 report revealed potentially dangerous levels of mercury in certain varieties of sushi tuna, reporting levels &quot;so high that the Food and Drug Administration could take legal action to remove the fish from the market.&quot;

==Management and conservation==
The main tuna fishery management bodies are the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission, the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, and the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna. The five gathered for the first time in Kobe, Japan in January 2007. Environmental organizations made submissions on risks to fisheries and species. The meeting concluded with an action plan drafted by some 60 countries or areas. Concrete steps include issuing certificates of origin to prevent illegal fishing and greater transparency in the setting of regional fishing quotas. The delegates were scheduled to meet at another joint meeting in January or February 2009 in Europe.

In 2010, Greenpeace International added the albacore, bigeye tuna, Pacific bluefin tuna, Atlantic bluefin tuna, southern bluefin tuna, and yellowfin tuna to its seafood red list, which are fish &quot;commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries.&quot;

Bluefin tuna have been widely accepted as being severely overfished, with some stocks at risk of collapse. According to the International Seafood Sustainability Foundation (a global, nonprofit partnership between the tuna industry, scientists, and the World Wide Fund for Nature), Indian Ocean yellowfin tuna, Pacific Ocean (eastern and western) bigeye tuna, and North Atlantic albacore tuna are all overfished. In April 2009, no stock of skipjack tuna (which makes up roughly 60% of all tuna fished worldwide) was considered to be overfished.

The BBC documentary &quot;South Pacific&quot;, which first aired in May 2009, stated that, should fishing in the Pacific continue at its current rate, populations of all tuna species could collapse within five years. It highlighted huge Japanese and European tuna fishing vessels, sent to the South Pacific international waters after overfishing their own fish stocks to the point of collapse.

A 2010 tuna fishery assessment report, released in January 2012 by the Secretariat of the Pacific Community, supported this finding, recommending that all tuna fishing should be reduced or limited to current levels and that limits on skipjack fishing be considered.

Research indicates that increasing ocean temperatures are taking a toll on the tuna in the Indian Ocean, where rapid warming of the ocean has resulted in a reduction of marine phytoplankton. The bigeye tuna catch rates have also declined abruptly during the past half century, mostly due to increased industrial fisheries, with the ocean warming adding further stress to the fish species.

<text>Glenn Hughes (born 21 August 1951) is an English musician, best known for playing bass and performing vocals in the hard rock band Trapeze and in the Mk. III and IV line-ups of Deep Purple, as well as briefly fronting Black Sabbath in the mid-1980s.

In addition to being an active session musician, Hughes maintains a notable solo career. He fronts the supergroup Black Country Communion, and fronted California Breed from 2013 to 2015 and The Dead Daisies from 2019 to 2023. In 2016, Hughes was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Deep Purple.

==Early life==
Hughes was born in Cannock, Staffordshire, England, on 21 August 1951. He fronted Finders Keepers in the 1960s as bassist/vocalist.

== Career ==

===Trapeze, Deep Purple, Hughes and Thrall (1973–1982)===

Hughes fronted the British funk rock band Trapeze. Hughes was bassist and lead vocalist for the first three Trapeze albums, released between 1970 and 1972. He also credited with contributing guitar, piano and trombone to these albums.

Hughes was recruited to replace Roger Glover as bassist in Deep Purple in 1973, though he considered himself more a vocalist than a bassist. He was reportedly uninterested in the Deep Purple job until some of the other members proposed that Paul Rodgers of Free be brought in as co-lead vocalist.

Although the recruitment of Rodgers fell through, Hughes had now become interested in the &quot;two-lead-singer thing&quot;, and David Coverdale was later hired as Deep Purple&#x27;s lead vocalist. The two would ultimately share lead vocal duties in the band for the next three albums, until the break-up of Deep Purple in 1976. Battling a severe cocaine addiction, Hughes then embarked on a solo career, releasing his first solo album in 1977, titled &quot;Play Me Out&quot;. In 2016, Hughes was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Deep Purple.

In 1982, he joined with ex-Pat Travers guitarist Pat Thrall to form Hughes/Thrall, and they released one self-titled album which went virtually unnoticed at the time. Part of the reason for the album&#x27;s obscurity was the inability to support it with a proper tour, due to both parties suffering from drug addiction. As Hughes stated in a 2007 interview, &quot;The Hughes-Thrall album was a brilliant, brilliant album, but we only did 17 shows because we were too loaded.&quot;

===Gary Moore, Black Sabbath and health problems (1983–1990)===

In the mid-1980s, Hughes recorded several different albums with bands and artists including Phenomena (&quot;Phenomena&quot;, &quot;Phenomena II: Dream Runner&quot;), Gary Moore (&quot;Run for Cover&quot;), and Black Sabbath (&quot;Seventh Star&quot;; originally a solo album by Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi that was released as a Sabbath album due to record label pressure).

Hughes&#x27; health problems due to overeating, drugs and alcohol began to seriously affect his musical projects and this contributed to very short stints with Gary Moore and Tony Iommi, as Hughes was unable to tour with them properly due to his poor health. In 1985 Black Sabbath reunited with original vocalist Ozzy Osbourne for their one-off Live Aid performance. While waiting for a break in Osbourne&#x27;s career, Iommi decided to record a solo album and Hughes was brought in to provide the vocals. Due to the aforementioned contractual obligations with the record company, the album was credited to &quot;Black Sabbath featuring Tony Iommi&quot; and released in 1986 to generally positive critical reviews. While touring to promote the new album, Hughes was replaced by vocalist Ray Gillen after just six shows; this was due both to injury from a confrontation with Black Sabbath&#x27;s production manager John Downing, which contributed to a degradation in his voice, and his not being in good enough physical shape to complete the tour.

Hughes&#x27;s first bass guitar was a salmon pink, pre-CBS Fender Jazz Bass. During his tenure in Trapeze, he played a Fender Jazz Bass as well as a Rickenbacker 4001 on the Deep Purple albums &quot;Burn&quot;, &quot;Stormbringer&quot;, and &quot;Come Taste the Band&quot;. This Rickenbacker was eventually given to Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler, who subsequently used it on the Never Say Die! tour in 1978.

===Health recovery and career rejuvenation (1991–2008)===
At the end of the decade, Hughes realised his ongoing drug problem was derailing him; a clean, sober and fully rejuvenated Hughes returned by 1991 with the vocal for the hit &quot;America: What Time Is Love?&quot; with The KLF. He also recorded all the vocals for former Europe guitarist John Norum&#x27;s solo album &quot;Face the Truth&quot;. He then re-embarked on a solo career that has been his primary focus to date. In 1999, Hughes did a short tribute tour to Tommy Bolin in Texas, with Tommy&#x27;s brother Johnnie (of Black Oak Arkansas) on drums.

In 2003, Hughes made a guest appearance in the metal opera project &quot;AINA&quot;, alongside other guest vocalists like Michael Kiske, Tobias Sammet, Andre Matos, and Simone Simons on the debut album &quot;Days of Rising Doom&quot;.

In 2005 Hughes released &quot;Soul Mover&quot; supporting it with a European tour. He also collaborated with Tony Iommi on the 2005 album &quot;Fused&quot;. Hughes then released &quot;Music for the Divine&quot; in 2006, which featured Red Hot Chili Peppers members Chad Smith and John Frusciante. Hughes toured in support of the album throughout Europe in autumn 2006. In 2006 Hughes made a guest appearance on Quiet Riot&#x27;s eleventh studio album &quot;Rehab,&quot; doing bass work and songwriting work with the band.

&quot;Live in Australia&quot;, an acoustic CD and companion DVD of a performance at Sydney&#x27;s famous &quot;Basement&quot; club was released via Edel Records on 17 November 2007. The album &quot;First Underground Nuclear Kitchen&quot; was released on 9 May 2008 in Europe and on 12 May in the rest of the world.

===Autobiography and other projects (2009–2016)===

In 2009, Hughes formed Black Country Communion with Jason Bonham (drums), Joe Bonamassa (guitar) and Derek Sherinian (keyboards). The band released three albums through 2012 and disbanded in March 2013 following the departure of Bonamassa. Black Country Communion reunited in 2016 and released a fourth album in 2017.

In July 2010, Hughes appeared as a guest vocalist (together with singer Jørn Lande) fronting Heaven &amp; Hell at the High Voltage Rock Festival in London as a tribute to the late Ronnie James Dio.

Hughes&#x27; autobiography was published in May 2011 by British specialist limited edition publishers Foruli. The book, titled &quot;Deep Purple and Beyond: Scenes from the Life of a Rock Star&quot;, was co-written with author Joel McIver and featured contributions by Tony Iommi, David Coverdale, Ozzy Osbourne, and Tom Morello, as well as a foreword by Lars Ulrich of Metallica. An extended paperback edition, retitled &quot;Glenn Hughes: The Autobiography&quot;, was published in late 2011 by Jawbone Press.

On 13 September 2012, Hughes and Derek Sherinian met Bako Sahakyan, the president of the breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh Republic and organised a concert in Stepanakert.

In 2013, Hughes made a special guest appearance on the debut, self-titled album from Device. He is featured on the song &quot;Through It All&quot; accompanying David Draiman on vocals.

Hughes has been touring as a member of Kings of Chaos, performing lead vocals, backing vocals and acoustic guitars, since early 2013. In late 2013, he formed a new band called California Breed with drummer Jason Bonham and guitarist Andrew Watt. The group released one self-titled album in 2014. California Breed announced in 2015 that they had broken up.

During 2015, Hughes undertook a solo world tour, featuring guitarist Doug Aldrich and drummer Pontus Engborg. The next year, he released his most recent studio album, &quot;Resonate&quot;.

===The Dead Daisies (2019–present)===

In September 2019, supergroup the Dead Daisies debuted a new track, &quot;Righteous Days&quot;, on Planet Rock Radio in the UK. It was also announced that Hughes would be joining the collective as lead singer and bassist. The then current incarnation of the Dead Daisies featured Hughes, guitarist Doug Aldrich, drummer Deen Castronovo, and rhythm guitarist David Lowy.

In November, the band headed to the south of France to begin writing and recording the next album, which would be the first with Hughes. They spent two weeks in November then a further two weeks in December at La Fabrique Studios in Saint-Rémy de Provence (south of France) working with producer Ben Grosse. The new album was to be released in 2020.

At the beginning of 2020, finishing touches and final mixing of the next album was completed with Grosse. In February, a European tour starting at the end of May 2020 and stretching until well into July was announced but later postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In June it was announced that the band would be playing a few shows with Foreigner in Germany and Poland starting in Hamburg on 6 June 2021. In addition, it was announced that the band would also do a number of dates in Europe in summer 2021 with Judas Priest.

On 17 April, &quot;Unspoken&quot;, the first single from the forthcoming album, was released. On 15 May US dance duo Dance With The Dead released a remix version of &quot;Unspoken&quot;. On 17 July 2020 &quot;The Lockdown Sessions&quot; EP was released by the band on digital platforms. The band later announced that the release of &quot;Holy Ground&quot;, as well as a supporting tour, had been pushed back to 22 January 2021. The next single to be released by the band was &quot;Bustle and Flow&quot; on 25 September. The song reached 15 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Chart. On 4 December the next single, &quot;Holy Ground&quot;, which is also the title track of the forthcoming album, was released and was added to the Planet Rock &#x27;A&#x27; playlist.

2021 saw the release of the fifth studio album &quot;Holy Ground&quot;. The album came out on 22 January and was met with praise from both fans and music critics, featuring 11 songs including three singles to date, the album reached the top 10 on many international rock charts. The next day drummer Deen Castronovo announced that he had left the band, due to a future back surgery. In his place for future live shows he will be replaced by Tommy Clufetos, formerly in the band as a session musician.

In September 30, 2022 the band released &quot;Radiance&quot;, their newest studio LP. Featuring a return of Hughes on bass &amp; vocals and Brian Tichy on drums replacing Tommy Clufetos. The album received praise from fans and critics alike, and featured the singles &quot;Face Your Fear&quot; and &quot;Radiance&quot;.

<text>Bilateral cingulotomy is a form of psychosurgery, introduced in 1948 as an alternative to lobotomy. Today, it is mainly used in the treatment of depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder. In the early years of the twenty-first century, it was used in Russia to treat addiction. It is also used in the treatment of chronic pain. The objective of this procedure is the severing of the supracallosal fibres of the cingulum bundle, which pass through the anterior cingulate gyrus.

== History ==
Cingulotomy was introduced in the 1940s as an alternative to standard pre-frontal leucotomy/lobotomy in the hope of alleviating symptoms of mental illness whilst reducing the undesirable effects of the standard operation (personality changes, etc.). It was suggested by American physiologist John Farquhar Fulton who, at a meeting of the Society of British Neurosurgeons in 1947, said &quot;were it feasible, cingulotomy in man would seem an appropriate place for limited leucotomy&quot;. This was derived from the hypothesis of James Papez who thought that the cingulum was a major component of an anatomic circuit believed to play a significant role in emotion. The first reports of the use of cingulotomy on psychiatric patients came from J le Beau in Paris, Hugh Cairns in Oxford, and Kenneth Livingston in Oregon.

== Target ==
Bilateral cingulotomy targets the anterior cingulate cortex, which is a part of the limbic system. This system is responsible for the integration of feelings and emotion in the human cortex. It consists of the cingulate gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, amygdala, and the hippocampal formation.

Studies in patients who were subject to bilateral cingulotomy, involving fMRI analyses, showed that the anterior cingulate cortex has a key role in cognitive control and is highly likely to be involved in the control of attentional response, whereas the dorsal part of that region of the brain was not identified to be involved in such a process, although this is still under dispute. The function of the dorsal part of the cingulate cortex was connected to the sorting out and processing of conflicting information signals. In addition, neuroimaging studies also indicated that the anterior cingulate cortex participates in the modulation of cortical regions that are of higher order, as well as sensory processing areas.

These findings have also been confirmed by stereotactic microelectrode analysis of single cortical neurons in a study, which involved nine patients undergoing bilateral cingulotomy. The study investigated the effect of performing attention demanding tasks on the activity of 36 neurons located in the anterior cingulate cortex. Upon analyzing the results of the study, it was concluded that the anterior cingulate cortex is indeed involved in the modification of cognitive tasks that require attention, based on the fact that there was a change in the basal firing rate of neurons in that region during simulation of such tasks.

Neuroimaging also uncovered different sub-regions in the anterior cingulate cortex itself, based on their function. These studies showed that the caudal part of the anterior cingulate cortex plays a more important function in cognitive activities that involve attention, salience, interference and response competition. These results, combined with electrophysiological investigation of the function of neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex, have provided insights that can be used in the improvement of cingulotomy performed on patients treated for obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). The basis behind this idea is the fact that a variation of certain tasks, emotional Stroop tasks (ES), which have been particularly identified as exerting effects in OCD patients, activate neurons in the more rostral part of the anterior cingulate cortex. Thus, theoretically, if bilateral cingulotomy is performed in such a patient in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex, better results should be obtained.

Moreover, OCD has been associated with a malformation of the basal ganglia. The function of this part of the human brain has been mapped to be composed of fiber tracks associated with numerous parallel cortico-striato-thalamocortical circuits (CSTC), which are involved in sensorimotor, motor, oculomotor as well as the cognitive processes that are manifested by the limbic system. This pathway involves GABAergic inhibitory projections that serve as one of the means of communication between the different structures involved. It has been hypothesized that some forms of OCD are a result of disinhibition of one or several of the circuits that operate in the CSTC. This is also indicated by a finding that showed a significant decrease in intracortical inhibition in OCD patients. Thus, lesions in the anterior cingulate cortex might contribute to the lessening of the disinhibition effect. This hypothesis has been confirmed by another study, which assessed the cortical inhibitory and excitatory mechanisms in OCD. The study measured the excitability of the motor cortex, as well as intracortical inhibition in OCD patients and a control group of healthy individuals. The results showed a significant decrease in intracortical inhibition, which resulted in a slowdown of interstimulus intervals by 3 ms. In addition to its proximity to and association with the limbic system and the amygdala in particular, which plays a key role in emotional experience, the anterior cingulate cortex shares afferent and efferent pathways with a number of thalamic nuclei as well as the posterior cingulate and part of some parietal, frontal and supplementary motor cortex. All these underline the high likelihood that the anterior cingulate cortex must have some involvement in OCD.

Functional MRI analyses of the anterior cingulate cortex have also led to the introduction of bilateral cingulotomy for the treatment of chronic pain. Such application was introduced since the anterior cingulate cortex has been found to be related to the processing of nociceptive information input. In particular, the role of the anterior cingulate cortex is in the interpretation of how a stimulus affects a person rather than its actual physical intensity.

== Procedure ==
A book published in 1992 described how the operation was carried out at that time. In most cases the procedure started with the medical team taking a number of CT scan X-ray images of the brain of the patient. This step ensured that the exact target, the cingulate cortex, was mapped out, so that the surgeon could identify it. Burr holes were then created in the patient&#x27;s skull using a drill. Lesions at the targeted tissue were made with the help of fine electrodes inserted at the right angle into the subject&#x27;s brain based on plotting charts and making sure important arteries and blood vessels were intact. The electrode was placed in a probe, or a holder, with only its tip projecting. Upon the correct insertion of the holder into the brain tissue, air was injected and more scan images were taken. Then, after the medical team had made sure they were on the right track, the tip of the electrode was advanced to the plane of the cingulate where it was heated to 75-90 °C. Once the first lesion was created it served as a center around which several other lesions were created. In order to confirm whether lesions are made at the right place, scan images were taken postoperatively and analyzed.

Recent technological advances, however, have made bilateral cingulotomy a more precise operation. For example, nowadays a neurosurgical team that performs the procedure can use an MRI to identify the location of the anterior and posterior commissures. This approach allows neurosurgeons to obtain a number of coronal images, which are then used to calculate the stereotactic coordinates of the target in the anterior cingulate cortex, where lesions need to be made. Moreover, the MRI enables more precise differentiation of the cell composition, and thus easily permits the identification of the grey matter in that region. This can then be further confirmed with the help of microelectrode recordings.

== Side effects ==
Patients usually recover from this operation over a period of four days. However, there are cases of subjects being released from hospital after as few as 48 hours after the operation. The mild shorter postoperative complications that are most commonly related to bilateral cingulotomy are typical of head interventions and include but are not limited to nausea, vomiting, and headaches. However, in some cases, patients exhibit seizures that sometimes appear up to two months after the surgical intervention. It has been questioned whether this is relevant and can be attributed to cingulotomy because such seizures were observed in patients who already had a history of this condition.

== Case studies ==
A 2002 study conducted at the Massachusetts General Hospital analyzed the outcome of bilateral cingulotomy in 44 patients for the treatment of OCD in the period between 1965 and 1986. Patients were followed up over a long term and evaluated based on several criteria: 1) how many of them were responders after a period of six months, 2) how many cingulotomies a patient had undergone before the examination of the effectiveness of the procedure, 3) whether the patient showed any significant change after the most recent procedure, and 4) what the side effects related to the procedure were.

The follow-up of the patients produced contradictory results, which indicated that bilateral cingulotomy is not the optimal treatment for OCD. Of the 44 patients, only 32% both fit the &quot;responder&quot; criteria and showed significant improvement compared to the other subjects. Another 14% exhibited some signs of improvement. Multiple cingulotomies correlated with a higher likelihood of continuing to respond to follow-up inquiries (6% more often fit the full &quot;responder&quot; criteria, 11% more often fit the partial &quot;responder&quot; criteria). However, the side effects associated with the procedure were numerous. Among the complaints that patients had after the surgery were apathy and deficits in memory, although these were rarely reported. In addition, some subjects complained of some form of urinary disturbance, ranging from urinary retention to incontinence. Hydrocephalus (2%) and seizures (2%) were also observed.

Bilateral cingulotomy has also been used in the treatment of chronic refractory pain. A systematic review of 11 studies encompassing 224 patients found that anterior cingulotomy led to significant pain relief in greater than 60% of patients post-operatively as well as at one year following the procedure. Of the included studies, one clinical study investigated the effect of bilateral cingulotomy for the treatment of refractory chronic pain. In this case, 23 patients who were subject to 28 cingulotomies in total were followed up. The analyses aimed at determining how much the pain of each individual was affected after the procedure with the help of a questionnaire. In addition, the examiners tried to evaluate the impacts on social and family relations of the participants in the study. Based on the data obtained, cingulotomy for treatment of chronic pain showed promising results. 72% reported improvement in the level of pain experienced, and 50% indicated that they no longer required painkillers after cingulotomy. More than half of the patients also claimed that the surgical procedure was beneficial and contributed to the improvement of their social interactions.

<doc id="46215" wikidata="Q261242" url="?curid=46215" title="70 mm film">
<text>70 mm film (or 65 mm film) is a wide high-resolution film gauge for motion picture photography, with a negative area nearly 3.5 times as large as the standard 35 mm motion picture film format. As used in cameras, the film is wide. For projection, the original 65 mm film is printed on film. The additional 5 mm contains the four magnetic stripes, holding six tracks of stereophonic sound. Although later 70 mm prints use digital sound encoding (specifically the DTS format), the vast majority of existing and surviving 70 mm prints pre-date this technology.

Each frame is five perforations tall (i.e., 23.8125 mm or 15/16 inches tall), with an image aspect ratio of 2.2:1. The use of anamorphic Ultra Panavision 70 lenses squeezes an ultra-wide 2.76:1 aspect ratio horizontally into that 2.2:1 imaging area. To this day, Ultra Panavision 70 produces the widest picture size in the history of filmmaking; surpassed only by Polyvision, which was only used for 1927&#x27;s &quot;Napoléon&quot;.

With regard to exhibition, 70 mm film was always considered a specialty format reserved for epics and spectacle films shot on 65 mm and blockbuster films that were released both in 35 mm and as 70 mm blow-ups. While few venues were equipped to screen this special format, at the height of its popularity most major markets and cities had a theater that could screen it. Some venues continue to screen 70 mm to this day or have even had 70 mm projectors permanently or temporarily installed for more recent 70 mm releases.

== History ==

Films formatted with a width of 70 mm have existed since the early days of the motion picture industry. The first 70 mm format film was most likely footage of the Henley Regatta, which was projected in 1896 and 1897, but may have been filmed as early as 1894. It required a specially built projector built by Herman Casler in Canastota, New York and had a ratio similar to full frame, with an aperture of by . There were also several film formats of various sizes from 50 to 68 mm which were developed from 1884 onwards, including Cinéorama (not to be confused with the entirely distinct &quot;Cinerama&quot; format), started in 1900 by Raoul Grimoin-Sanson. In 1914 the Italian Filoteo Alberini invented a panoramic film system utilising a 70 mm wide film called Panoramica.

===Fox Grandeur===

In 1928, William Fox of the Fox Film Corporation, in personal partnership with Theodore Case as the Fox-Case Corporation, began working on a wide film format using 70 mm film which they named Grandeur. Cameras were ordered by Fox-Case from Mitchell Camera Corp, with the first 70 mm production cameras, designated as the Mitchell Model FC camera, delivered to Fox-Case in May 1929. This was one of a number of wide-film processes developed by some of the major film studios at about that time. However, due to the financial strains of the Great Depression, along with strong resistance from movie theater owners, who were in the process of equipping their theaters for sound, none of these systems became commercially successful. Fox dropped Grandeur in 1930.

===Todd-AO===
Producer Mike Todd had been one of the founders of Cinerama, a wide-screen movie process that was launched in 1952. Cinerama employed three 35 mm film projectors running in synchronism to project a wide (2.6:1) image onto a deeply curved screen. Although the results were impressive, the system was expensive, cumbersome and had some serious shortcomings due to the need to match up three separate projected images. Todd left the company to develop a system of his own which, he hoped, would be as impressive as Cinerama, yet be simpler and cheaper and avoid the problems associated with three-strip projection; in his own words, he wanted &quot;Cinerama out of one hole&quot;.

In collaboration with the American Optical Company, Todd developed a system which was to be called &quot;Todd-AO&quot;. This uses a single 70 mm wide film and was introduced with the film &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; in October 1955. The 70 mm film is perforated at the same pitch (0.187 inch, 4.75 mm) as standard 35 mm film. With a five-perforation pull-down, the Todd-AO system provides a frame dimension of 1.912 inch (48.56 mm) by 0.87 inch (22.09 mm) giving an aspect ratio of 2.2:1.

The original version of Todd-AO used a frame rate of 30 per second, 25% faster than the 24 frames per second that was (and is) the standard; this was changed after the second film – &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; - because of the need to produce (24 frame/sec) 35 mm reduction prints from the Todd-AO 65 mm negative. The Todd-AO format was originally intended to use a deeply curved Cinerama-type screen but this failed to survive beyond the first few films. However, in the 1960s and 70s, such films as &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; (which had been filmed in Todd-AO) and &quot;Patton&quot; (which had been filmed in a copycat process known as Dimension 150) were shown in some Cinerama cinemas, which allowed for deeply curved screens.

Todd-AO adopted a similar multi-channel magnetic sound system to the one developed for Cinemascope two years earlier, recorded on &quot;stripes&quot; of magnetic oxide deposited on the film. However Todd-AO has six channels instead of the four of Cinemascope and due to the wider stripes and faster film speed provides superior audio quality. Five of these six channels are fed to five speakers spaced behind the screen, and the sixth is fed to surround speakers around the walls of the auditorium.

===Panavision and the 65/70 mm format===

Panavision developed their own 65/70 mm system that was technically compatible and virtually identical to Todd-AO. Monikered as Super Panavision 70, it used spherical lenses and the same 2.2:1 aspect ratio at 24 frames per second. Panavision also had another 65 mm system, Ultra Panavision 70, which sprang from the MGM Camera 65 system they helped develop for MGM that was used to film &quot;Raintree County&quot; and &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;. Both Ultra Panavision 70 and MGM Camera 65 employed an anamorphic lens with a 1.25x squeeze on a 65 mm negative (as opposed to 35 mm CinemaScope which used a 2× compression, or 8-perf, horizontally filmed 35 mm Technirama which used a 1.5× compression). When projected on a 70 mm print, a 1.25× anamorphic projection lens was used to decompress the image to an aspect ratio of 2.76:1, one of the widest ever used in commercial cinema.

==Decline and resurgence==
Due to the high cost of 70 mm film and the expensive projection system and screen required to use the stock, distribution for films using the stock was limited, although this did not always hurt profits. Most 70 mm films were also released on 35 mm film for a wider distribution after the initial debut of the film. &quot;South Pacific&quot; (1958), &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (1962), &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; (1964), and &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; (1965) are well-known films widely shown in 70 mm format with a general release in 35 mm format. 70 mm film received a brief resurgence in the 1980s when it became popular to make &quot;blow-up&quot; prints of 35 mm titles. It had another resurgence in the mid-2010s with the release of &quot;The Master&quot; (2012), &quot;The Hateful Eight&quot; (2015) and &quot;Dunkirk&quot; (2017), with a small number of venues getting temporary or permanent 70 mm film projectors in order to be able to screen these titles. Quentin Tarantino, in particular, led a successful campaign to have the equipment required to show &quot;The Hateful Eight&quot; in Ultra Panavision installed in 100 cinemas worldwide.

===Blow-ups===
The 35 mm to 70 mm &quot;blow-up&quot; process produces 70 mm release prints from 35 mm negatives, so that films shot on the smaller format could benefit from 70 mm image and sound quality. This process began in the 1960s with titles like &quot;The Cardinal&quot; (1963) and continues up until the present day, with the height of its popularity being in the 1980s. These enlargements often provided richer colors, and a brighter, steadier and sharper (though often grainier) image, but the main benefit was the ability to provide 6-channel stereophonic sound as most theaters before the mid-70s (before the advent of Dolby A) were screening 35 mm prints with single channel monaural sound. However these &quot;blow-ups&quot; rarely used the full six channels of the Todd-AO system and instead used the four-track mixes made for 35 mm prints, the additional half-left and half-right speakers of the Todd-AO layout being fed with a simple mix of the signals intended for the adjacent speakers (known as a &quot;spread&quot;) or simply left blank. If a 70 mm film was shown in a Cinerama theatre, the Cinerama sound system was used. From 1976 onwards, many 70 mm prints used Dolby noise reduction on the magnetic tracks but Dolby disapproved of the &quot;spread&quot; and instead re-allocated the 6 available tracks to provide for left, center and right screen channels, left and right surround channels plus a &quot;low-frequency enhancement&quot; channel to give more body to low-frequency bass. This layout came to be known as &quot;5.1&quot; (the &quot;point one&quot; is the low-frequency enhancement channel) and was subsequently adopted for digital sound systems used with 35 mm.

In the 1980s the use of these &quot;blow-ups&quot; increased with large numbers of 70 mm prints being made of some blockbusters of the period such as the 125 70 mm prints made of &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980). However the early 1990s saw the advent of digital sound systems (Dolby Digital, DTS and SDDS) for 35 mm prints which meant that 35 mm could finally match 70 mm for sound quality but at a far lower cost. Coupled with the rise of the multiplex cinema, which meant that audiences were increasingly seeing films on relatively small screens rather than the giant screens of the old &quot;Picture Palaces&quot;, this meant that the expensive 70 mm format went out of favour again. The DTS digital sound-on-disc system was adapted for use with 70 mm film, thus saving the significant costs of magnetic striping, but this has not been enough to stop the decline, and 70 mm prints were rarely made.

Among some of the more recent 70 mm blow-up titles are Paul Thomas Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Inherent Vice&quot; (2014) and &quot;Phantom Thread&quot; (2017), Patty Jenkins&#x27;s &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; (2017), and Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Ready Player One&quot; (2018).

=== Current use ===
In the late 20th century, the usage of 65 mm negative film drastically reduced, in part due to the high cost of 65 mm raw stock and processing. Some of the few films since 1990 shot entirely on 65 mm stock are Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1996), Ron Fricke&#x27;s &quot;Baraka&quot; (1992) and its sequel, &quot;Samsara&quot; (2011), Paul Thomas Anderson&#x27;s &quot;The Master&quot; (2012), Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;The Hateful Eight&quot; (2015), Christopher Nolan&#x27;s &quot;Dunkirk&quot; (2017) (almost 80 minutes, about 75% of the film was shot on 65 mm IMAX film, while the rest was shot on regular 65mm film), Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; (2017), &quot;Tenet&quot; (2020), and &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; (2023). Other films used 65 mm cameras sparingly, for selected scenes or special effects. Films with limited 65 mm footage include
Terrence Malick&#x27;s &quot;The New World&quot; (2005), the Patty Jenkins film &quot;Wonder Woman 1984&quot; (2020), Cary Joji Fukunaga&#x27;s &quot;No Time to Die&quot; (2021) and the Christopher Nolan films &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; (featured 28 minutes of IMAX footage), &quot;Inception&quot;, &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; (over an hour in IMAX) and &quot;Interstellar&quot;.

Since the 2010s, most movie theaters have converted to digital projection systems, resulting in the removal of both 35 mm (the previous industry standard) projectors and 70 mm projectors. However some venues and organizations remain committed to screening 70 mm film, seeing the special format as something that can set them apart and be an audience draw in an industry where most movies are screened digitally.

70 mm film festivals continue to take place regularly at venues such as The Somerville Theatre in Somerville, Massachusetts, The Music Box Theatre in Chicago, the Hollywood Theatre in Portland, Oregon, the American Cinematheque&#x27;s Aero and Egyptian Theaters in Los Angeles, the Museum of the Moving Image in New York City, the TIFF Bell Lightbox in Toronto, the Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Worcester, Massachusetts, and others.

== Uses of 70 mm ==
===Ultra Panavision===
An anamorphic squeeze combined with 65 mm film allowed for extremely wide aspect ratios to be used while still preserving quality. This was used in the 1957 film &quot;Raintree County&quot; and to incredible success in the 1959 film &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; and the 2015 film &quot;The Hateful Eight&quot;, both of which were filmed with the Ultra Panavision 70/MGM Camera 65 process at an aspect ratio of 2.76:1. It required the use of a 1.25x anamorphic lens to horizontally compress the image, and a corresponding lens on the projector to uncompress it.

===Visual effects===
Limited use of 65 mm film was revived in the late 1970s for some of the visual effects sequences in films like &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;, mainly because the larger negative did a better job than 35 mm negative of minimizing visible film grain during optical compositing. 65 mm was the primary film format used at VFX pioneer Douglas Trumbull&#x27;s facility EEG (Entertainment Effects Group), which later became Boss Film Studios, run by former Industrial Light &amp; Magic alum Richard Edlund. Since the 1990s, a handful of films (such as &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;) have used 65mm for this purpose, but the usage of digital intermediate for compositing has largely negated these issues. Digital intermediate offers other benefits such as lower cost and a greater range of available lenses and accessories to ensure a consistent look to the footage.

===IMAX===
A horizontal variant of 70 mm, with an even bigger picture area, is used for the high-performance IMAX format which uses a frame that is 15 perforations wide on 70 mm film. The Dynavision and Astrovision systems each use slightly less film per frame and vertical pulldown to save print costs while being able to project onto an IMAX screen. Both were rare, with Astrovision largely used in Japanese planetariums. IMAX introduced a digital projection system in the late 2000s and most IMAX venues have migrated to a digital setup.

===70 mm 3D early use===
The first commercial introduction of 70 mm single projector 3D was the 1967 release of &quot;Con la muerte a la espalda&quot;, a Spanish/French/Italian co-production which used a process called Hi-Fi Stereo 70, itself based on a simplified, earlier developed Soviet process called Stereo-70. This process captured two anamorphic images, one for each eye, side by side on 65 mm film. A special lens on a 70 mm projector added polarization and merged the two images on the screen. The 1971 re-release of Warner Bros.&#x27; &quot;House of Wax&quot; used the side-by-side StereoVision format and was distributed in both anamorphically squeezed 35 mm and deluxe non-anamorphic 70 mm form. The system was developed by Allan Silliphant and Chris Condon of StereoVision International Inc., which handled all technical and marketing aspects on a five-year special-royalty basis with Warner Bros. The big screen 3D image was both bright and clear, with all the former sync and brightness problems of traditional dual 35 mm 3D eliminated. Still, it took many years more before IMAX began to test the water for big-screen 3D, and sold the concept to Hollywood executives.

===IMAX 3D===
Hollywood has released films shot on 35 mm as IMAX blow-up versions. Many 3D films were shown in the 70 mm IMAX format. &quot;The Polar Express&quot; in IMAX 3D 70 mm earned 14 times as much, per screen, as the simultaneous 2D 35 mm release of that film in the fall of 2004.

==Technical specifications==

===Standard 65 mm (5/70) (Todd-AO, Super Panavision)===
* spherical lenses
* 5 perforations/frame (1 perforation = 0.1875 in or 3/16 in, thus 1 frame of 70 mm film has a height of 0.9375 in or 15/16 in)
* 42 frames/meter (12.8 frames/ft)
* 34.29 meters/minute (112.5 ft/minute)
* vertical pulldown
* 24 frames/second
* &quot;camera aperture&quot;: 52.63 by 23.01 mm (2.072 by 0.906 in)
* &quot;projection aperture&quot;: 48.56 by 22.10 mm (1.912 by 0.870 in)
* 305 m (1000 feet), about 9 minutes at 24 frame/s = 4.5 kg (10 pounds) in can
* &quot;aspect ratio&quot;: 2.2:1

===Ultra Panavision 70 (MGM Camera 65)===

&quot;Same as Standard 65 mm except&quot;
* &quot;projection aperture&quot;: 48.59 by 22.05 mm (1.913 by 0.868 in)
* MGM Camera 65 lenses built by Panavision employed a square-shaped, double wedge-prism anamorphic attachment in front of a spherical objective lens. By the time of &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty (1962)&quot; Panavision had developed a new set of Ultra Panavision 70 lenses that used a high quality cylindrical anamorphic element in front of the objective lens. These new lenses were far superior to the prism anamorphics—they were lighter, transmitted more light and suffered from less spherical and chromatic aberration.
* 1.25x squeeze factor, projected aspect ratio 2.76:1

===Showscan===

&quot;Same as Standard 65 mm except&quot;
* 60 frames per second
* 180 degree shutter

===IMAX (15/70)===
* spherical lenses
* 70 mm film, 15 perforations per frame
* horizontal rolling loop movement, from right to left (viewed from emulsion side)
* 24 frames per second
* &quot;camera aperture:&quot; 
* &quot;projection aperture:&quot; at least less than camera aperture on the vertical axis and at least less on the horizontal axis

* photographed and projected with special fisheye lenses matched to large 180 degree dome screen
* Theatres upgraded from 70 mm 6-track analog sound to DTS digital sound in 1995.

Omnivision started in Sarasota, Florida. Theatres were designed to compete with Omnimax but with much lower startup and operating costs. Most theatres were built in fabric domed structures designed by Seaman Corporation. The last known OmniVision theatres to exist in USA are The Alaska Experience Theatre in Anchorage, Alaska, built in 1981 (closed in 2007, reopened in 2008), and the Hawaii Experience Theatre in Lahaina, Hawaii (closed in 2004). Rainbow&#x27;s End (theme park) in NZ had the only remaining permanent Cinema 180 attraction until May 2015 when it was demolished.
One of the few producers of 70 mm films for Cinema 180 was the German company Cinevision (today AKPservices GmbH, Paderborn).

<text>The Israeli–Palestinian conflict is an ongoing military and political conflict about land and self-determination within the territory of the former Mandatory Palestine. Key aspects of the conflict include the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the status of Jerusalem, Israeli settlements, borders, security, water rights, the permit regime, Palestinian freedom of movement, and the Palestinian right of return.

The conflict has its origins in the rise of Zionism in the late 19th century in Europe, a movement which aimed to establish a Jewish state through the colonization of Palestine, and the consequent first arrival of Jewish settlers to Ottoman Palestine in 1882. The local Arab population increasingly began to oppose Zionism, primarily out of the fear of territorial displacement and dispossession. The Zionist movement garnered the support of an imperial power in the 1917 Balfour Declaration issued by Britain, which promised to support the creation of a &quot;Jewish homeland&quot; in Palestine. Following British occupation of the formerly Ottoman region during World War I, Mandatory Palestine was established as a British mandate. Increasing Jewish immigration led to tensions between Jews and Arabs which grew into intercommunal conflict. In 1936, an Arab revolt erupted demanding independence and an end to British support for Zionism, which was suppressed by the British. Eventually tensions led to the United Nations adopting a partition plan in 1947, triggering a civil war.

During the ensuing 1948 Palestine war, more than half of the mandate&#x27;s predominantly Palestinian Arab population fled or were expelled by Israeli forces. By the end of the war, Israel was established on most of the former mandate&#x27;s territory, and the Gaza Strip and the West Bank were controlled by Egypt and Jordan respectively. Since the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel has been occupying the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, known collectively as the Palestinian territories. Two Palestinian uprisings against Israel and its occupation erupted in 1987 and 2000, the first and second intifadas respectively. Israel&#x27;s occupation, which is now considered to be the longest military occupation in modern history, has seen it constructing illegal settlements there, creating a system of institutionalized discrimination against Palestinians under its occupation called Israeli apartheid. This discrimination includes Israel&#x27;s denial of Palestinian refugees from their right of return and right to their lost properties. Israel has also drawn international condemnation for violating the human rights of the Palestinians.

The international community, with the exception of the US and Israel, has been in consensus since the 1980s regarding a settlement of the conflict on the basis of a two-state solution along the 1967 borders and a just resolution for Palestinian refugees. The US and Israel have instead preferred bilateral negotiations rather than a resolution of the conflict on the basis of international law. In recent years, public support for a two-state solution has decreased, with Israeli policy reflecting an interest in maintaining the occupation rather than seeking a permanent resolution to the conflict. In 2007, Israel tightened its blockade of the Gaza Strip and made official its policy of isolating it from the West Bank. Since then, Israel has framed its relationship with Gaza in terms of the laws of war rather than in terms of its status as an occupying power. In a July 2024 ruling, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) rebuffed Israel&#x27;s stance, determining that the Palestinian territories constitute one political unit and that Israel continues to illegally occupy the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The ICJ also determined that Israeli policies violate the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. Since 2006, Hamas and Israel have fought several wars. Attacks by Hamas-led armed groups in October 2023 in Israel were followed by another war. Israel&#x27;s actions in Gaza since the start of the war have been described by international law experts, genocide scholars and human rights organizations as genocidal.

==History==


The Israeli–Palestinian conflict began in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with the development of political Zionism and the arrival of Zionist settlers to Palestine. During the early 20th century, Arab nationalism also grew within the Ottoman Empire. To gain support from the Arab nationalists, Great Britain initially promised support for the formation of an independent Arab state in Palestine in the McMahon–Hussein correspondence, and with local support it was able to take control of the region in 1917. It later transpired that the British and French governments had secretly made the Sykes-Picot Agreement in 1916 not to allow the formation of an independent Arab state.

While Jewish colonization began during this period, it was not until the arrival of more ideologically Zionist immigrants in the decade preceding the First World War that the landscape of Ottoman Palestine would start to significantly change. Land purchases, the eviction of tenant Arab peasants and armed confrontation with Jewish para-military units would all contribute to the Palestinian population&#x27;s growing fear of territorial displacement and dispossession. From early on, the leadership of the Zionist movement had the idea of &quot;transferring&quot; (a euphemism for ethnic cleansing) the Arab Palestinian population out of the land for the purpose of establishing a Jewish demographic majority. According to the Israeli historian Benny Morris the idea of transfer was &quot;inevitable and inbuilt into Zionism&quot;. The Arab population felt this threat as early as the 1880s with the arrival of the first aliyah. Chaim Weizmann&#x27;s efforts to build British support for the Zionist movement would eventually secure the Balfour Declaration, a public statement issued by the British government in 1917 during the First World War announcing support for the establishment of a &quot;national home for the Jewish people&quot; in Palestine.

===1920s===
With the creation of the British Mandate in Palestine after the end of the first world war, large-scale Jewish immigration began accompanied by the development of a separate Jewish-controlled sector of the economy supported by foreign capital. The more ardent Zionist ideologues of the Second Aliyah would become the leaders of the Yishuv starting in the 1920s and believed in the separation of Jewish and Arab societies.

Amin al-Husseini, appointed as Grand Mufti of Jerusalem by the British High Commissioner Herbert Samuel, immediately marked Jewish national movement and Jewish immigration to Palestine as the sole enemy to his cause, initiating large-scale riots against the Jews as early as 1920 in Jerusalem and in 1921 in Jaffa. Among the results of the violence was the establishment of the Jewish paramilitary force Haganah. In 1929, a series of violent riots resulted in the deaths of 133 Jews and 116 Arabs, with significant Jewish casualties in Hebron and Safed, and the evacuation of Jews from Hebron and Gaza.

=== 1936–1939 Arab revolt ===

In the early 1930s, the Arab national struggle in Palestine had drawn many Arab nationalist militants from across the Middle East, such as Sheikh Izz ad-Din al-Qassam from Syria, who established the Black Hand militant group and had prepared the grounds for the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine. Following the death of al-Qassam at the hands of the British in late 1935, tensions erupted in 1936 into the Arab general strike and general boycott. The strike soon deteriorated into violence, and the Arab revolt was bloodily repressed by the British assisted by the British armed forces of the Jewish Settlement Police, the Jewish Supernumerary Police, and Special Night Squads. The suppression of the revolt would leave at least 10% of the adult male population killed, wounded, imprisoned or exiled. Between the expulsion of much of the Arab leadership and the weakening of the economy, the Palestinians would struggle to confront the growing Zionist movement.

The cost and risks associated with the revolt and the ongoing inter-communal conflict led to a shift in British policies in the region and the appointment of the Peel Commission which recommended creation of a small Jewish country, which the two main Zionist leaders, Chaim Weizmann and David Ben-Gurion, accepted on the basis that it would allow for later expansion. The subsequent White Paper of 1939, which rejected a Jewish state and sought to limit Jewish immigration to the region, was the breaking point in relations between British authorities and the Zionist movement.

===1940-1947===

The renewed violence, which continued sporadically until the beginning of World War II, ended with around 5,000 casualties on the Arab side and 700 combined on the British and Jewish side total. With the eruption of World War II, the situation in Mandatory Palestine calmed down. It allowed a shift towards a more moderate stance among Palestinian Arabs under the leadership of the Nashashibi clan and even the establishment of the Jewish–Arab Palestine Regiment under British command, fighting Germans in North Africa. The more radical exiled faction of al-Husseini, however, tended to cooperate with Nazi Germany, and participated in the establishment of a pro-Nazi propaganda machine throughout the Arab world. The defeat of Arab nationalists in Iraq and subsequent relocation of al-Husseini to Nazi-occupied Europe tied his hands regarding field operations in Palestine, though he regularly demanded that the Italians and the Germans bomb Tel Aviv. The Jewish Agency for Palestine and Palestinian National Defense Party called on Palestine&#x27;s Jewish and Arab youth to volunteer for the British Army. 30,000 Palestinian Jews and 12,000 Palestinian Arabs enlisted in the British armed forces during the war, while a Jewish Brigade was created in 1944.

By the end of World War II, a crisis over the fate of Holocaust survivors from Europe led to renewed tensions between the Yishuv and Mandate authorities. By 1944, Jewish groups began to conduct military-style operations against the British, with the aim of persuading Great Britain to accept the formation of a Jewish state. This culminated in the Jewish insurgency in Mandatory Palestine. This sustained Zionist paramilitary campaign of resistance against British authorities, along with the increased illegal immigration of Jewish refugees and 1947 United Nations partition, led to eventual withdrawal of the British from Palestine.

===1947 United Nations partition plan===

On 29 November 1947, the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted Resolution 181(II) recommending the adoption and implementation of a plan to partition Palestine into an Arab state, a Jewish state and the City of Jerusalem. Palestinian Arabs were opposed to the partition. Zionists accepted the partition but planned to expand Israel&#x27;s borders beyond what was allocated to it by the UN. On the next day, Palestine was swept by violence. For four months, under continuous Arab provocation and attack, the Yishuv was usually on the defensive while occasionally retaliating. The Arab League supported the Arab struggle by forming the volunteer-based Arab Liberation Army, supporting the Palestinian Arab Army of the Holy War, under the leadership of Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni and Hasan Salama. On the Jewish side, the civil war was managed by the major underground militias – the Haganah, Irgun and Lehi – strengthened by numerous Jewish veterans of World War II and foreign volunteers. By spring 1948, it was already clear that the Arab forces were nearing a total collapse, while Yishuv forces gained more and more territory, creating a large scale refugee problem of Palestinian Arabs.

=== 1948 Arab–Israeli War ===


Following the Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel on 14 May 1948, the Arab League decided to intervene on behalf of Palestinian Arabs, marching their forces into former British Palestine, beginning the main phase of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. The overall fighting, leading to around 15,000 casualties, resulted in cease-fire and armistice agreements of 1949, with Israel holding much of the former Mandate territory, Jordan occupying and later annexing the West Bank and Egypt taking over the Gaza Strip, where the All-Palestine Government was declared by the Arab League on 22 September 1948. The 1947–1948 civil war in Mandatory Palestine and 1948 Arab-Israeli War resulted in the ethnic cleansing of 750,000 Palestinian Arabs. In 1950, Israel passed the Law of Return, which allowed Jews and their spouses to become citizens with voting rights, even if they had never lived there before.

=== 1956 Suez Crisis ===
Through the 1950s, Jordan and Egypt supported the Palestinian Fedayeen militants&#x27; cross-border attacks into Israel, while Israel carried out its own reprisal operations in the host countries. The 1956 Suez Crisis resulted in a short-term Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip and exile of the All-Palestine Government, which was later restored with Israeli withdrawal. The All-Palestine Government was completely abandoned by Egypt in 1959 and was officially merged into the United Arab Republic, to the detriment of the Palestinian national movement. Gaza Strip then was put under the authority of the Egyptian military administrator, making it a de facto military occupation. In 1964, however, a new organization, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), was established by Yasser Arafat. It immediately won the support of most Arab League governments and was granted a seat in the Arab League.

=== 1967 Six-Day War ===

In the 1967 Arab-Israel War, Israel occupied the Palestinian West Bank, East Jerusalem, Gaza Strip, Egyptian Sinai, Syrian Golan Heights, and two islands in the Gulf of Aqaba.

The war exerted a significant effect upon Palestinian nationalism, as the PLO was unable to establish any control on the ground and ultimately established its headquarters in Jordan, from where it supported the Jordanian army during the War of Attrition. However, the Palestinian base in Jordan collapsed with the Jordanian–Palestinian civil war in 1970, after which the PLO was forced to relocate to South Lebanon.

In the mid-1970s, the international community converged on a framework to resolve the conflict through the establishment of an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza. This &quot;land for peace&quot; proposal was endorsed by the ICJ and UN.

=== 1973 Yom Kippur War ===
On 6 October 1973, a coalition of Arab forces consisting of mainly Egypt and Syria launched a surprise attack against Israel on the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur. Despite this, the war concluded with an Israeli victory, with both sides suffering tremendous casualties.

Following the end of the war, the UN Security Council passed Resolution 338 confirming the land-for-peace principle established in Resolution 242, initiating the Middle East peace process. The Arab defeat would play an important role in the PLO&#x27;s willingness to pursue a negotiated settlement to the conflict, while many Israelis began to believe that the area under Israeli occupation could not be held indefinitely by force.

The Camp David Accords, agreed upon by Israel and Egypt in 1978, primarily aimed to establish a peace treaty between the two countries. The accords also proposed the creation of a &quot;Self-Governing Authority&quot; for the Arab population in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, excluding Jerusalem, under Israeli control. A peace treaty based on these accords was signed in 1979, leading to Israel&#x27;s withdrawal from the occupied Egyptian Sinai Peninsula by 1982.

===1982 Lebanon War===
During the Lebanese Civil War, Palestinian militants continued to launch attacks against Israel while also battling opponents within Lebanon. In 1978, the Coastal Road massacre led to the Israeli full-scale invasion known as Operation Litani. This operation sought to dislodge the from Lebanon while expanding the area under the control of the Israeli allied Christian militias in southern Lebanon. The operation succeeded in leaving a large portion of the south in control of the Israeli proxy which would eventually form the South Lebanon Army. Under United States pressure, Israeli forces would eventually withdraw from Lebanon.

In 1982, Israel, having secured its southern border with Egypt, sought to resolve the Palestinian issue by attempting to dismantle the military and political power of the PLO in Lebanon. The goal was to establish a friendly regime in Lebanon and continue its policy of settlement and annexation in occupied Palestine. The PLO had observed the latest ceasefire with Israel and shown a preference for negotiations over military operations. As a result, Israel sought to remove the PLO as a potential negotiating partner. Most Palestinian militants were defeated within several weeks, Beirut was captured, and the PLO headquarters were evacuated to Tunisia in June by Yasser Arafat&#x27;s decision.

===First Intifada (1987–1993)===
The first Palestinian uprising began in 1987 as a response to Israel&#x27;s military occupation, escalating attacks on Palestinians, and policies of settlement building and collective punishment. The uprising largely consisted of nonviolent acts of civil disobedience and protest, and was largely led by grassroots popular, youth, and women&#x27;s committees. By the early 1990s, the conflict, termed the First Intifada, was the focus of international settlement efforts, in part motivated by the success of the Egyptian–Israeli peace treaty of 1982. Eventually the Israeli–Palestinian peace process led to the Oslo Accords of 1993, allowing the PLO to relocate from Tunisia and take ground in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, establishing the Palestinian National Authority. The peace process also had significant opposition among elements of Palestinian society, such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, who immediately initiated a campaign of attacks targeting Israelis. Following hundreds of casualties and a wave of anti-government propaganda, Israeli Prime Minister Rabin was assassinated by an Israeli far-right extremist who objected to the peace initiative. This struck a serious blow to the peace process, which in 1996 led to the newly elected government of Israel backing off from the process, to some degree.

===Second Intifada (2000–2005)===

Following several years of unsuccessful negotiations, the conflict re-erupted as the Second Intifada in September 2000. The violence, escalating into an open conflict between the Palestinian National Security Forces and the Israel Defense Forces, lasted until 2004/2005 and led to thousands of fatalities. In 2005, Israeli Prime Minister Sharon ordered the removal of Israeli settlers and soldiers from Gaza. Israel and its Supreme Court formally declared an end to occupation, saying it &quot;had no effective control over what occurred&quot; in Gaza. However, the United Nations, Human Rights Watch and many other international bodies and NGOs continue to consider Israel to be the occupying power of the Gaza Strip as Israel controls Gaza Strip&#x27;s airspace, territorial waters and controls the movement of people or goods in or out of Gaza by air or sea.

=== Fatah–Hamas split (2006–2007) ===

In 2006, Hamas won a plurality of 44% in the Palestinian parliamentary election. Israel responded it would begin economic sanctions unless Hamas agreed to accept prior Israeli–Palestinian agreements, forswear violence, and recognize Israel&#x27;s right to exist, all of which Hamas rejected. After internal Palestinian political struggle between Fatah and Hamas erupted into the 2007 Battle of Gaza, Hamas took full control of the area. In 2007, Israel imposed a naval blockade on the Gaza Strip, and cooperation with Egypt allowed a ground blockade of the Egyptian border.

The tensions between Israel and Hamas escalated until late 2008, when Israel launched operation Cast Lead upon Gaza, resulting in thousands of civilian casualties and billions of dollars in damage. By February 2009, a ceasefire was signed with international mediation between the parties, though the occupation and small and sporadic eruptions of violence continued.

In 2011, a Palestinian Authority attempt to gain UN membership as a fully sovereign state failed. In Hamas-controlled Gaza, sporadic rocket attacks on Israel and Israeli air raids continued to occur. In November 2012, Palestinian representation in the UN was upgraded to a non-member observer state, and its mission title was changed from &quot;Palestine (represented by PLO)&quot; to &quot;State of Palestine&quot;. In 2014, another war broke out between Israel and Gaza, resulting in over 70 Israeli and over 2,000 Palestinian casualties.

=== 2023–present Gaza war ===

After the 2014 war and 2021 crisis, Hamas began planning an attack on Israel. In 2022, Netanyahu returned to power while headlining a hardline far-right government, which led to greater political strife in Israel and clashes in the Palestinian territories. This culminated in a surprise attack launched by Hamas-led militant groups on southern Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October 2023, in which more than 1,200 Israeli civilians and military personnel were killed, and around 250 were taken hostage into Gaza. The Israeli military retaliated by declaring war on Hamas and conducting an extensive aerial bombardment campaign on Gaza, followed by a large-scale ground invasion with the stated goal of destroying Hamas, freeing hostages, and controlling security in Gaza afterwards. Israel killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, including civilians and combatants and displaced almost two million people. South Africa accused Israel of genocide at the International Court of Justice and called for an immediate ceasefire. The court issued an order requiring Israel to take all measures to prevent any acts contrary to the 1948 Genocide Convention, but did not order Israel to suspend its military campaign.

The war spilled over, with Israel engaging in clashes with local militias in the West Bank, Hezbollah in Lebanon and northern Israel, and other Iranian-backed militias in Syria. Iranian-backed militias also engaged in clashes with the United States, while the Houthis blockaded the Red Sea in protest, to which the United States responded with airstrikes in Yemen, Iraq, and Syria.

==Attempts to reach a peaceful settlement==
The PLO&#x27;s participation in diplomatic negotiations was dependent on its complete disavowal of terrorism and recognition of Israel&#x27;s &quot;right to exist.&quot; This stipulation required the PLO to abandon its objective of reclaiming all of historic Palestine and instead focus on the 22 percent which came under Israeli military control in 1967. By the late 1970s, Palestinian leadership in the occupied territories and most Arab states supported a two-state settlement. In 1981, Saudi Arabia put forward a plan based on a two-state settlement to the conflict with support from the Arab League. Israeli analyst Avner Yaniv describes Arafat as ready to make a historic compromise at this time, while the Israeli cabinet continued to oppose the existence of a Palestinian state. Yaniv described Arafat&#x27;s willingness to compromise as a &quot;peace offensive&quot; which Israel responded to by planning to remove the PLO as a potential negotiating partner in order to evade international diplomatic pressure. Israel would invade Lebanon the following year in an attempt to undermine the PLO as a political organization, weakening Palestinian nationalism and facilitating the annexation of the West Bank into Greater Israel.

While the PLO had adopted a program of pursuing a Palestinian state alongside Israel since the mid-1970s, the 1988 Palestinian Declaration of Independence formally consecrated this objective. This declaration, which was based on resolutions from the Palestine National Council sessions in the late 1970s and 1980s, advocated for the creation of a Palestinian state comprising the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem, within the borders set by the 1949 armistice lines prior to 5 June 1967. Following the declaration, Arafat explicitly denounced all forms of terrorism and affirmed the PLO&#x27;s acceptance of UN Resolutions 242 and 338, as well as the recognition of Israel&#x27;s right to exist. All the conditions defined by Henry Kissinger for US negotiations with the PLO had now been met.

Then-Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Shamir stood behind the stance that the PLO was a terrorist organization. He maintained a strict stance against any concessions, including withdrawal from occupied Palestinian territories, recognition of or negotiations with the PLO, and especially the establishment of a Palestinian state. Shamir viewed the U.S. decision to engage in dialogue with the PLO as a mistake that threatened the existing territorial status quo. He argued that negotiating with the PLO meant accepting the existence of a Palestinian state and hence was unacceptable.

===The peace process===
The term &quot;peace process&quot; refers to the step-by-step approach to resolving the conflict. Having originally entered into usage to describe the US mediated negotiations between Israel and surrounding Arab countries, notably Egypt, the term &quot;peace-process&quot; has grown to be associated with an emphasis on the negotiation process rather than on presenting a comprehensive solution to the conflict. As part of this process, fundamental issues of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict such as borders, access to resources, and the Palestinian right of return, have been left to &quot;final status&quot; talks. Such &quot;final status&quot; negotiations along the lines discussed in Madrid in 1991 have never taken place.

The Oslo Accords of 1993 and 1995 built on the incremental framework put in place by the 1978 Camp David negotiations and the 1991 Madrid and Washington talks. The motivation behind the incremental approach towards a settlement was that it would &quot;build confidence&quot;, but the eventual outcome was instead a dramatic decline in mutual confidence. At each incremental stage, Israel further entrenched its occupation of the Palestinian territories, despite the PA upholding its obligation to curbing violent attacks from extremist groups, in part by cooperating with Israeli forces.

Meron Benvenisti, former deputy mayor of Jerusalem, observed that life became harsher for Palestinians during this period as state violence increased and Palestinian land continued to be expropriated as settlements expanded. Israeli foreign minister Shlomo Ben-Ami described the Oslo Accords as legitimizing &quot;the transformation of the West Bank into what has been called a &#x27;cartographic cheeseboard&#x27;.&quot;

====Creation of the Palestinian Authority and security cooperation====
Core to the Oslo Accords was the creation of the Palestinian Authority and the security cooperation it would enter into with the Israeli military authorities in what has been described as the &quot;outsourcing&quot; of the occupation to the PA. Just before signing the Oslo accord, Rabin described the expectation that the &quot;Palestinians will be better at establishing internal security than we were, because they will allow no appeals to the Supreme Court and will prevent [human rights groups] from criticizing the conditions there.&quot; Along these lines, Ben-Ami, who participated in the Camp David 2000 talks, described this process: &quot;One of the meanings of Oslo was that the PLO was eventually Israel&#x27;s collaborator in the task of stifling the Intifada and cutting short what was clearly an authentically democratic struggle for Palestinian independence.&quot;

The Wye River Memorandum agreed on by the PA and Israel introduced a &quot;zero tolerance&quot; policy for &quot;terror and violence.&quot; This policy was uniformly criticised by human rights organizations for its &quot;encouragement&quot; of human rights abuses. Dennis Ross describes the Wye as having successfully reduced both violent and non-violent protests, both of which he considers to be &quot;inconsistent with the spirit of Wye.&quot; Watson claims that the PA frequently violated its obligations to curb incitement and its record on curbing terrorism and other security obligations under the Wye River Memorandum was, at best, mixed.

===Oslo Accords (1993, 1995)===

In 1993, Israeli officials led by Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leaders from the Palestine Liberation Organization led by Yasser Arafat strove to find a peaceful solution through what became known as the Oslo peace process. A crucial milestone in this process was Arafat&#x27;s letter of recognition of Israel&#x27;s right to exist. Emblematic of the asymmetry in the Oslo process, Israel was not required to, and did not, recognize the right of a Palestinian state to exist. In 1993, the Declaration of Principles (or Oslo I) was signed and set forward a framework for future Israeli–Palestinian negotiations, in which key issues would be left to &quot;final status&quot; talks. The stipulations of the Oslo agreements ran contrary to the international consensus for resolving the conflict; the agreements did not uphold Palestinian self-determination or statehood and repealed the internationally accepted interpretation of UN Resolution 242 that land cannot be acquired by war. With respect to access to land and resources, Noam Chomsky described the Oslo agreements as allowing &quot;Israel to do virtually what it likes.&quot; The Oslo process was delicate and progressed in fits and starts.

The process took a turning point at the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin in November 1995 and the election of Netanyahu in 1996, finally unraveling when Arafat and Ehud Barak failed to reach an agreement at Camp David in July 2000 and later at Taba in 2001. The interim period specified by Oslo had not built confidence between the two parties; Barak had failed to implement additional stages of the interim agreements and settlements expanded by 10% during his short term. The disagreement between the two parties at Camp David was primarily on the acceptance (or rejection) of international consensus. For Palestinian negotiators, the international consensus, as represented by the yearly vote in the UN General Assembly which passes almost unanimously, was the starting point for negotiations. The Israeli negotiators, supported by the American participants, did not accept the international consensus as the basis for a settlement. Both sides eventually accepted the Clinton parameters &quot;with reservations&quot; but the talks at Taba were &quot;called to a halt&quot; by Barak, and the peace process itself came to a stand-still. Ben-Ami, who participated in the talks at Camp David as Israel&#x27;s foreign minister, would later describe the proposal on the table: &quot;The Clinton parameters... are the best proof that Arafat was right to turn down the summit&#x27;s offers&quot;.

===Camp David Summit (2000)===

In July 2000, US President Bill Clinton convened a peace summit between Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak. Barak reportedly put forward the following as &quot;bases for negotiation&quot;, via the US to the Palestinian President: a non-militarized Palestinian state split into 3–4 parts containing 87–92% of the West Bank after having already given up 78% of historic Palestine. Thus, an Israeli offer of 91 percent of the West Bank (5,538 km2 of the West Bank translates into only 86 percent from the Palestinian perspective), including Arab parts of East Jerusalem and the entire Gaza Strip, as well as a stipulation that 69 Jewish settlements (which comprise 85% of the West Bank&#x27;s Jewish settlers) would be ceded to Israel, no right of return to Israel, no sovereignty over the Temple Mount or any core East Jerusalem neighbourhoods, and continued Israel control over the Jordan Valley.

Arafat rejected this offer, which Palestinian negotiators, Israeli analysts and Israeli Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami described as &quot;unacceptable&quot;. According to the Palestinian negotiators the offer did not remove many of the elements of the Israeli occupation regarding land, security, settlements, and Jerusalem.

After the Camp David summit, a narrative emerged, supported by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and his foreign minister Shlomo Ben-Ami, as well as US officials including Dennis Ross and Madeleine Albright, that Yasser Arafat had rejected a generous peace offer from Israel and instead incited a violent uprising. This narrative suggested that Arafat was not interested in a two-state solution, but rather aimed to destroy Israel and take over all of Palestine. This view was widely accepted in US and Israeli public opinion. Nearly all scholars and most Israeli and US officials involved in the negotiations have rejected this narrative. These individuals include prominent Israeli negotiators, the IDF chief of staff, the head of the IDF&#x27;s intelligence bureau, the head of the Shin Bet as well as their advisors.

No tenable solution was crafted which would satisfy both Israeli and Palestinian demands, even under intense US pressure. Clinton has long blamed Arafat for the collapse of the summit. In the months following the summit, Clinton appointed former US Senator George J. Mitchell to lead a fact-finding committee aiming to identify strategies for restoring the peace process. The committee&#x27;s findings were published in 2001 with the dismantlement of existing Israeli settlements and Palestinian crackdown on militant activity being one strategy.

=== Developments following Camp David ===

Following the failed summit Palestinian and Israeli negotiators continued to meet in small groups through August and September 2000 to try to bridge the gaps between their respective positions. The United States prepared its own plan to resolve the outstanding issues. Clinton&#x27;s presentation of the US proposals was delayed by the advent of the Second Intifada at the end of September.

Clinton&#x27;s plan, eventually presented on 23 December 2000, proposed the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian state in the Gaza Strip and 94–96 percent of the West Bank plus the equivalent of 1–3 percent of the West Bank in land swaps from pre-1967 Israel. On Jerusalem, the plan stated that &quot;the general principle is that Arab areas are Palestinian and that Jewish areas are Israeli.&quot; The holy sites were to be split on the basis that Palestinians would have sovereignty over the Temple Mount/Noble sanctuary, while the Israelis would have sovereignty over the Western Wall. On refugees the plan suggested a number of proposals including financial compensation, the right of return to the Palestinian state, and Israeli acknowledgment of suffering caused to the Palestinians in 1948. Security proposals referred to a &quot;non-militarized&quot; Palestinian state, and an international force for border security. Both sides accepted Clinton&#x27;s plan and it became the basis for the negotiations at the Taba Peace summit the following January.

===Taba Summit (2001)===
The Israeli negotiation team presented a new map at the Taba Summit in Taba, Egypt, in January 2001. The proposition removed the &quot;temporarily Israeli controlled&quot; areas, and the Palestinian side accepted this as a basis for further negotiation. With Israeli elections looming the talks ended without an agreement but the two sides issued a joint statement attesting to the progress they had made: &quot;The sides declare that they have never been closer to reaching an agreement and it is thus our shared belief that the remaining gaps could be bridged with the resumption of negotiations following the Israeli elections.&quot; The following month the Likud party candidate Ariel Sharon defeated Ehud Barak in the Israeli elections and was elected as Israeli prime minister on 7 February 2001. Sharon&#x27;s new government chose not to resume the high-level talks.

=== Road map for peace (2002–2003) ===

One peace proposal, presented by the Quartet of the European Union, Russia, the United Nations and the United States on 17 September 2002, was the Road Map for Peace. This plan did not attempt to resolve difficult questions such as the fate of Jerusalem or Israeli settlements, but left that to be negotiated in later phases of the process. The proposal never made it beyond the first phase, whose goals called for a halt to both Israeli settlement construction and Israeli–Palestinian violence. Neither goal has been achieved as of November 2015.

The Annapolis Conference was a Middle East peace conference held on 27 November 2007, at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, United States. The conference aimed to revive the Israeli–Palestinian peace process and implement the &quot;Roadmap for peace&quot;. The conference ended with the issuing of a joint statement from all parties. After the Annapolis Conference, the negotiations were continued. Both Mahmoud Abbas and Ehud Olmert presented each other with competing peace proposals. Ultimately no agreement was reached.

===Arab Peace Initiative (2002, 2007, 2017)===

The Arab Peace Initiative ( &quot;Mubādirat as-Salām al-ʿArabīyyah&quot;), also known as the Saudi Initiative, was first proposed by Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia at the 2002 Beirut summit. The initiative is a proposed solution to the Arab–Israeli conflict as a whole, and the Israeli–Palestinian conflict in particular. The initiative was initially published on 28 March 2002, at the Beirut summit, and agreed upon again at the 2007 Riyadh summit. Unlike the Road Map for Peace, it spelled out &quot;final solution&quot; borders based on the UN borders established before the 1967 Six-Day War. It offered full normalization of relations with Israel, in exchange for the withdrawal of its forces from all the occupied territories, including the Golan Heights, to recognize &quot;an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital&quot; in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, as well as a &quot;just solution&quot; for the Palestinian refugees.

The Palestinian Authority led by Yasser Arafat immediately embraced the initiative. His successor Mahmoud Abbas also supported the plan and officially asked U.S. President Barack Obama to adopt it as part of his Middle East policy. Islamist political party Hamas, the elected government of the Gaza Strip, was deeply divided, with most factions rejecting the plan. Palestinians have criticised the Israel–United Arab Emirates normalization agreement and another with Bahrain signed in September 2020, fearing the moves weaken the Arab Peace Initiative, regarding the UAE&#x27;s move as &quot;a betrayal.&quot;

The Israeli government under Ariel Sharon rejected the initiative as a &quot;non-starter&quot; because it required Israel to withdraw to pre-June 1967 borders. After the renewed Arab League endorsement in 2007, then-Prime Minister Ehud Olmert gave a cautious welcome to the plan. In 2015, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed tentative support for the Initiative, but in 2018, he rejected it as a basis for future negotiations with the Palestinians.

==Current status==

===Apartheid===
In July 2024, the International Court of Justice determined that Israeli policies violate the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. As of 2022, all the major Israeli and international human rights organizations were in agreement that Israeli actions constituted the crime of apartheid. In April 2021, Human Rights Watch released its report &quot;A Threshold Crossed&quot;, describing the policies of Israel towards Palestinians living in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza constituted the crime of apartheid. A further report titled &quot;Israel&#x27;s Apartheid Against Palestinians: Cruel System of Domination and Crime Against Humanity&quot; was released by Amnesty International on 1 February 2022.

In 2018, the Knesset passed the Nation-State law which the Israeli legal group Adalah nicknamed the &quot;Apartheid law.&quot; Adalah described the Nation-State law as &quot;constitutionally enshrining Jewish supremacy and the identity of the State of Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people.&quot; The Nation-State law is a Basic Law, meaning that it has &quot;quasi-constitutional status,&quot; and states that the right to exercise national self-determination in Israel is &quot;unique to the Jewish people&quot;.

===Occupied Palestinian territory===

Israel has occupied the Palestinian territories, which comprise the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) and the Gaza Strip, since the 1967 Six-Day War, making it the longest military occupation in modern history. In 2024, the International Court of Justice determined that the Palestinian territories constitute one political unit and that Israel&#x27;s occupation since 1967, and the subsequent creation of Israeli settlements and exploitation of natural resources, are illegal under international law. The court also ruled that Israel should pay full reparations to the Palestinian people for the damage the occupation has caused.

Some Palestinians say they are entitled to all of the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem. Israel says it is justified in not ceding all this land, because of security concerns, and also because the lack of any valid diplomatic agreement at the time means that ownership and boundaries of this land is open for discussion. Palestinians claim any reduction of this claim is a severe deprivation of their rights. In negotiations, they claim that any moves to reduce the boundaries of this land is a hostile move against their key interests. Israel considers this land to be in dispute and feels the purpose of negotiations is to define what the final borders will be. In 2017 Hamas announced that it was ready to support a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders &quot;without recognising Israel or ceding any rights&quot;.

==== Israeli settlements ====


The international community considers Israeli settlements to be illegal under international law, but Israel disputes this. Those who justify the legality of the settlements use arguments based upon Articles 2 and 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, as well as UN Security Council Resolution 242. The expansion of settlements often involves the confiscation of Palestinian land and resources, leading to displacement of Palestinian communities and creating a source of tension and conflict. Settlements are often protected by the Israeli military and are frequently flashpoints for violence against Palestinians. Furthermore, the presence of settlements and Jewish-only bypass roads creates a fragmented Palestinian territory, seriously hindering economic development and freedom of movement for Palestinians. Amnesty International reports that Israeli settlements divert resources needed by Palestinian towns, such as arable land, water, and other resources; and, that settlements reduce Palestinians&#x27; ability to travel freely via local roads, owing to security considerations.

As of 2023, there were about 500,000 Israeli settlers living in the West Bank, with another 200,000 living in East Jerusalem. In February 2023, Israel&#x27;s Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich took charge of most of the Civil Administration, obtaining broad authority over civilian issues in the West Bank. In the first six months of 2023, 13,000 housing units were built in settlements, which is almost three times more than in the whole of 2022.

====Israeli military police====

In a report published in February 2014 covering incidents over the three-year period of 2011–2013, Amnesty International stated that Israeli forces employed reckless violence in the West Bank, and in some instances appeared to engage in wilful killings which would be tantamount to war crimes. Besides the numerous fatalities, Amnesty said at least 261 Palestinians, including 67 children, had been gravely injured by Israeli use of live ammunition. In this same period, 45 Palestinians, including 6 children had been killed. Amnesty&#x27;s review of 25 civilians deaths concluded that in no case was there evidence of the Palestinians posing an imminent threat. At the same time, over 8,000 Palestinians suffered serious injuries from other means, including rubber-coated metal bullets. Only one IDF soldier was convicted, killing a Palestinian attempting to enter Israel illegally. The soldier was demoted and given a 1-year sentence with a five-month suspension. The IDF answered the charges stating that its army held itself &quot;to the highest of professional standards&quot;, adding that when there was suspicion of wrongdoing, it investigated and took action &quot;where appropriate&quot;.

===Separation of the Gaza Strip===

Since 2006, Israel has enforced an official and explicit policy of enforcing &quot;separation&quot; between the West Bank and Gaza Strip. This separation policy has involved strict restrictions on imports, exports and travel to and from the Gaza Strip. This policy began to develop as early as the 1950s, but was further formalized with the implementation of an Israeli closure regime in 1991, where Israel began requiring Gazans to obtain permits to exit the Gaza Strip and to enter the West Bank (cancelling the &quot;general exit permit&quot;). By treating the Gaza Strip as a separate entity, Israel has aimed to increase its control over the West Bank while avoiding a political resolution to the conflict. The lack of territorial contiguity between Gaza and the West Bank and the absence of any &quot;safe passage&quot; explain the success of Israel&#x27;s policy of separation. Harvard political economist Sara Roy describes the separation policy as motivated by Israeli rejection of territorial compromise, fundamentally undermining Palestinian political and economic cohesion and weakening national unity among Palestinians.

The severing of Gaza from the West Bank hinterland reflects a paradigm shift in the framing of the conflict. After Hamas assumed power in 2007, Israel declared Gaza a &quot;hostile territory,&quot; preferring to frame its obligations towards Gaza in terms of the law of armed conflict, over what it presented as a border dispute, as opposed to those of military occupation (this framing was rebuffed by the ICJ in 2024 when the court stated that Israel continued to occupy the Gaza Strip even after the 2005 disengagement). Indeed, the intensified blockade policy was presented by Israeli officials as &quot;economic warfare&quot; intended to &quot;keep the Gazan economy on the brink of collapse&quot; at the &quot;lowest possible level.&quot; Roy cites an Israeli Supreme Court&#x27;s decision approving fuel cuts to Gaza as emblematic of the disabling of Gaza; the court deemed the fuel cuts permissible on the basis that they would not harm the population&#x27;s &quot;essential humanitarian needs.&quot;

The executive director of the Israeli human rights organization Gisha described Israeli policy towards Gaza between 2007 and 2010 as &quot;explicitly punitive,&quot; controlling the entry of food based on calculated calorie needs to limit economic activity and enforce &quot;economic warfare.&quot; These restrictions included allowing only small packets of margarine to prevent local food production. Gaza&#x27;s GDP dramatically declined during this period as a result of these measures. Indeed, by April 2010 Israel restricted the entry of commercial items to Gaza to a list of 73 products, compared with 4,000 products which had previously been approved. The result was the virtual collapse of Gaza&#x27;s private sector, which Roy describes as largely completed after the 2008 Israeli Operation Cast Lead in Gaza. According to Gisha, travel restrictions from the Gaza Strip are not based on individual security concerns, rather, the general rule is that travel to Israel or the West Bank from Gaza is not permitted other than in &quot;exceptional&quot; cases. Israeli imposed travel restrictions aim in particular to prevent Gazans from living in the West Bank. Indeed, Israeli policy treats the Gaza Strip as a &quot;terminus&quot; station, with family reunification between the West Bank and Gaza Strip only possible if the family agrees to permanently relocate to the Gaza Strip. The Israeli officials described the blockade as serving limited security value, instead referring to these restrictions as motivated by &quot;political-security.&quot;

====Blockade of the Gaza Strip====
Although closure has a long history in Gaza dating back to 1991 when it was first imposed, it was made more acute after 2000 with the start of the second intifada. Closure was tightened further after the 2005 disengagement and then again in 2006, after Hamas&#x27;s electoral victory. Heightened restrictions were imposed on imports and exports as well as on the movement of people, including Gaza&#x27;s labor force. The total siege of Gaza that was imposed following the Hamas led attack on Israel during 7 October 2023, was part of that same policy of separation and closure, characterized by the destruction of Gaza&#x27;s infrastructure (especially housing) and the denial of food, water, electricity, and fuel to its population. On 9 October 2023, Israel declared war on Hamas and tightened its blockade of the Gaza Strip. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant declared, &quot;There will be no electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed. We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly.&quot;

Since its initiation, blockade has had a detrimental impact on the private sector in Gaza, the primary driver of economic growth in Gaza. Prior to the blockade, Gaza imported 95% of its inputs for manufacturing and exported 85% of the finished products (primarily to Israel and the West Bank). Employment in this sector dropped to 4% by 2010, with an overall unemployment rate of 40% at this time and 80% of the population living on less than 2 dollars a day. Fewer than 40 commercial items were allowed in to the Gaza Strip by 2009, compared to a list of 4,000 items before the start of the blockade. Fuel imports were restricted such that 95% of Gaza&#x27;s industrial operations were forced to close, with the rest operating far below capacity. In aggregate, 100,000 out of the 120,000 employed in the private sector lost their jobs as a result of the blockade. Most critically for the economy has been the near complete ban on exports from the Gaza Strip. The number of truckloads carrying exports fell to 2% their pre-blockade numbers. Only exports to the European market were allowed, a far less profitable market for Gazans than Israel and the West Bank. The products approved for export were primarily flowers and strawberries. The first export to the West Bank or Israel did not happen until 2012 and only in very limited quantities: up to four truckloads of furniture manufactured in Gaza were allowed through Israel for an exhibition in Amman.

Even in the early years of Israeli imposed closure, the associated increased cost of doing business had a detrimental impact on trade. Goods transferred between the West Bank, Gaza, and Israel were required to be loaded onto Palestinian trucks initially and then off loaded onto Israeli trucks at the border even for distances of 50–100 miles. These increased costs include the costs for security checks, clearance, storage, and spoilage, as well as increased transportation costs.

The Military Advocate General of Israel said that Israel is justified under international law to impose a blockade on an enemy for security reasons as Hamas &quot;turned the territory under its de facto control into a launching pad of mortar and rocket attacks against Israeli towns and villages in southern Israel.&quot; Media headlines have described a United Nations commission as ruling that Israel&#x27;s blockade is &quot;both legal and appropriate.&quot; However, Amnesty International has stated that this is &quot;completely false,&quot; and that the cited UN report made no such claim. The Israeli Government&#x27;s continued land, sea and air blockage is tantamount to collective punishment of the population, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

In January 2008, the Israeli government calculated how many calories per person were needed to prevent a humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip, and then subtracted eight percent to adjust for the &quot;culture and experience&quot; of the Gazans. Details of the calculations were released following Israeli human rights organization Gisha&#x27;s application to the high court. Israel&#x27;s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, who drafted the plan, stated that the scheme was never formally adopted, this was not accepted by Gisha.

On 20 June 2010, in response to the Gaza flotilla raid, Israel&#x27;s Security Cabinet approved a new system governing the blockade that would allow practically all non-military or dual-use items to enter the Gaza Strip. According to a cabinet statement, Israel would &quot;expand the transfer of construction materials designated for projects that have been approved by the Palestinian Authority, including schools, health institutions, water, sanitation and more—as well as (projects) that are under international supervision.&quot; Despite the easing of the land blockade, Israel will continue to inspect all goods bound for Gaza by sea at the port of Ashdod. Despite these announcements, the economic situation did not substantially change and the virtual complete ban on exports remained in place. Only some consumer products and material for donor-sponsored projects was allowed in.

===United Nations and recognition of Palestinian statehood===

The PLO have campaigned for full member status for the state of Palestine at the UN and for recognition on the 1967 borders. This campaign has received widespread support. The UN General Assembly votes every year almost unanimously in favor of a resolution calling for the establishment of a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders. The US and Israel instead prefer to pursue bilateral negotiation rather than resolving the conflict on the basis of international law. Netanyahu has criticized the Palestinians of purportedly trying to bypass direct talks, whereas Abbas has argued that the continued construction of Israeli-Jewish settlements is &quot;undermining the realistic potential&quot; for the two-state solution. Although Palestine has been denied full member status by the UN Security Council, in late 2012 the UN General Assembly overwhelmingly approved the &quot;de facto&quot; recognition of sovereign Palestine by granting non-member state status.

===Incitement===
Following the Oslo Accords, which was to set up regulative bodies to rein in frictions, Palestinian incitement against Israel, Jews, and Zionism continued, parallel with Israel&#x27;s pursuance of settlements in the Palestinian territories, though under Abu Mazen it has reportedly dwindled significantly. Charges of incitement have been reciprocal, both sides interpreting media statements in the Palestinian and Israeli press as constituting incitement. Schoolbooks published for both Israeli and Palestinian schools have been found to have encouraged a one-sided narrative and at times hatred of the other side.
Perpetrators of murderous attacks, whether against Israelis or Palestinians, often find strong vocal support from sections of their communities despite varying levels of condemnation from politicians.

Both parties to the conflict have been criticized by third-parties for teaching incitement to their children by downplaying the other side&#x27;s historical ties to the area, teaching propagandist maps, or indoctrinating their children to one day join the armed forces.

==Issues in dispute==
The core issues of the conflict are borders, the status of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, the status of Jerusalem, the right of return for Palestinian refugees, and security. With the PLO&#x27;s recognition of Israel&#x27;s &quot;right to exist&quot; in 1982, the international community with the main exception of the United States and Israel has been in consensus on a framework for resolving the conflict on the basis of international law. Various UN bodies and the ICJ have supported this position; every year, the UN General Assembly votes almost unanimously in favor of a resolution titled &quot;Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine.&quot; This resolution consistently affirms the illegality of the Israeli settlements, the annexation of East Jerusalem, and the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war. It also emphasizes the need for an Israeli withdrawal from the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967 and the need for a just resolution to the refugee question on the basis of UN resolution 194.

Unilateral strategies and the rhetoric of hardline political factions, coupled with violence, have fostered mutual embitterment and hostility and a loss of faith in the possibility of reaching a peaceful settlement. Since the break down of negotiations, security has played a less important role in Israeli concerns, trailing behind employment, corruption, housing and other pressing issues. Israeli policy had reoriented to focus on managing the conflict and the associated occupation of Palestinian territory, rather than reaching a negotiated solution. The expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank has led the majority of Palestinians to believe that Israel is not committed to reaching an agreement, but rather to a pursuit of establishing permanent control over this territory in order to provide that security.

===Status of Jerusalem===


In 1967, Israel unilaterally annexed East Jerusalem, in violation of international law. Israel seized a significant area further east of the city, eventually creating a barrier of Israeli settlements around the city, isolating Jerusalem&#x27;s Palestinian population from the West Bank. Israel&#x27;s policy of constructing sprawling Jewish neighborhoods surrounding the Palestinian sections of the city were aimed at making a repartition of the city almost impossible. In a further effort to change the demography of Jerusalem in favor of a Jewish majority, Israel discouraged Palestinian presence in the city while encouraging Jewish presence, as a matter of policy. Specifically, Israel introduced policies restricting the space available for the construction of Palestinian neighborhoods, delaying or denying building permits and raising housing demolition orders. Tensions in Jerusalem are primarily driven by provocations by Israeli authorities and Jewish extremists against Arabs in the city.

The Israeli government, including the Knesset and Supreme Court, is located in the &quot;new city&quot; of West Jerusalem and has been since Israel&#x27;s founding in 1948. After Israel annexed East Jerusalem in 1967, it assumed complete administrative control of East Jerusalem. Since then, various UN bodies have consistently denounced Israel&#x27;s control over East Jerusalem as invalid. In 1980, Israel passed the Jerusalem Law declaring &quot;Jerusalem, complete and united, is the capital of Israel.&quot;

Many countries do not recognize Jerusalem as Israel&#x27;s capital, with exceptions being the United States, and Russia. The majority of UN member states and most international organisations do not recognise Israel&#x27;s claims to East Jerusalem which occurred after the 1967 Six-Day War, nor its 1980 Jerusalem Law proclamation. The International Court of Justice in its 2004 Advisory opinion on the &quot;Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory&quot; described East Jerusalem as &quot;occupied Palestinian territory&quot;.

The three largest Abrahamic religions—Judaism, Christianity, and Islam—hold Jerusalem as an important setting for their religious and historical narratives. Jerusalem is the holiest city in Judaism, being the former location of the Jewish temples on the Temple Mount and the capital of the ancient Israelite kingdom. For Muslims, Jerusalem is the third holiest site, being the location of the Isra&#x27; and Mi&#x27;raj event, and the Al-Aqsa Mosque. For Christians, Jerusalem is the site of Jesus&#x27; crucifixion and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.

==== Holy sites and the Temple Mount ====
Since the early 20th century, the issue of holy places and particularly the sacred places in Jerusalem has been employed by nationalist politicians.

Israelis did not have access to the holy places in East Jerusalem during the period of Jordanian occupation. Since 1975, Israel has banned Muslims from worshiping at Joseph&#x27;s Tomb, a shrine considered sacred by both Jews and Muslims. Settlers established a yeshiva, installed a Torah scroll and covered the mihrab. During the Second Intifada Palestinian protesters looted and burned the site. Israeli security agencies routinely monitor and arrest Jewish extremists that plan attacks, though many serious incidents have still occurred. Israel has allowed almost complete autonomy to the Muslim trust (Waqf) over the Temple Mount.

Palestinians have voiced concerns regarding the welfare of Christian and Muslim holy places under Israeli control. Additionally, some Palestinian advocates have made statements alleging that the Western Wall Tunnel was re-opened with the intent of causing the mosque&#x27;s collapse.

===Palestinian refugees===

Palestinian refugees are people who lost both their homes and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 Arab–Israeli conflict and the 1967 Six-Day War. The number of Palestinians who were expelled or fled from Israel was estimated at 711,000 in 1949. The descendants of all refugees (not just Palestinian refugees) are considered by the UN to also be refugees. As of 2010 there are 4.7 million Palestinian refugees. Between 350,000 and 400,000 Palestinians were displaced during the 1967 Arab–Israeli war. A third of the refugees live in recognized refugee camps in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The remainder live in and around the cities and towns of these host countries. Most Palestinian refugees were born outside Israel and are not allowed to live in any part of historic Palestine.

Israel has since 1948 prevented the return of Palestinian refugees and refused any settlement permitting their return except in limited cases. On the basis of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and UN General Assembly Resolution 194, Palestinians claim the right of refugees to return to the lands, homes and villages where they lived before being driven into exile in 1948 and 1967. Arafat himself repeatedly assured his American and Israeli interlocutors at Camp David that he primarily sought the principle of the right of return to be accepted, rather than the full right of return, in practice.

Palestinian and international authors have justified the right of return of the Palestinian refugees on several grounds:
Several scholars included in the broader New Historians argue that the Palestinian refugees fled or were chased out or expelled by the actions of the Haganah, Lehi and Irgun, Zionist paramilitary groups. A number have also characterized this as an ethnic cleansing. The New Historians cite indications of Arab leaders&#x27; desire for the Palestinian Arab population to stay put.

The Israeli Law of Return that grants citizenship to people of Jewish descent has been described as discriminatory against other ethnic groups, especially Palestinians that cannot apply for such citizenship under the law of return, to the territory which they were expelled from or fled during the course of the 1948 war.

According to the UN Resolution 194, adopted in 1948, &quot;the refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbours should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date, and that compensation should be paid for the property of those choosing not to return and for loss of or damage to property which, under principles of international law or in equity, should be made good by the Governments or authorities responsible.&quot; UN Resolution 3236 &quot;reaffirms also the inalienable right of the Palestinians to return to their homes and property from which they have been displaced and uprooted, and calls for their return&quot;. Resolution 242 from the UN affirms the necessity for &quot;achieving a just settlement of the refugee problem&quot;; however, Resolution 242 does not specify that the &quot;just settlement&quot; must or should be in the form of a literal Palestinian right of return.

Historically, there has been debate over the relative impact of the causes of the 1948 Palestinian exodus, although there is a wide consensus that violent expulsions by Zionist and Israeli forces were the main factor. Other factors include psychological warfare and Arab sense of vulnerability. Notably, historian Benny Morris states that most of Palestine&#x27;s 700,000 refugees fled because of the &quot;flail of war&quot; and expected to return home shortly after a successful Arab invasion. He documents instances in which Arab leaders advised the evacuation of entire communities as happened in Haifa although recognizes that these were isolated events. In his later work, Morris considers the displacement the result of a national conflict initiated by the Arabs themselves. In a 2004 interview with Haaretz, he described the exodus as largely resulting from an atmosphere of transfer that was promoted by Ben-Gurion and understood by the military leadership. He also claimed that there &quot;are circumstances in history that justify ethnic cleansing&quot;. He has been criticized by political scientist Norman Finkelstein for having seemingly changed his views for political, rather than historical, reasons.

Although Israel accepts the right of the Palestinian Diaspora to return into a new Palestinian state, Israel insists that the return of this population into the current state of Israel would threaten the stability of the Jewish state; an influx of Palestinian refugees would lead to the end of the state of Israel as a Jewish state since a demographic majority of Jews would not be maintained.

===Israeli security concerns===

Throughout the conflict, Palestinian violence has been a concern for Israelis. Security concerns have historically been a key driver in Israeli political decision making, often expanding in scope and taking precedence over other considerations such as international law and Palestinian human rights. The occupation of the West Bank, Gaza, East Jerusalem and the continued expansion of settlements in those areas have been justified on security grounds.

Israel, along with the United States and the European Union, refer to any use of force by Palestinian groups as terroristic and criminal. The United Nations General Assembly resolution A/RES/45/130 reflects an international consensus (113 out of 159 voting nations voted in favor, 13 voted against) affirming Palestinians&#x27; legitimacy, as a people under foreign occupation, to use armed struggle to resist said occupation.

In Israel, Palestinian suicide bombers have targeted civilian buses, restaurants, shopping malls, hotels and marketplaces. From 1993 to 2003, 303 Palestinian suicide bombers attacked Israel. In 1994, Hamas initiated their first lethal suicide attack in response to the cave of the Patriarchs massacre where American-Israeli physician Baruch Goldstein opened fire in a mosque, killing 29 people and injuring 125.

The Israeli government initiated the construction of a security barrier following scores of suicide bombings and terrorist attacks in July 2003. Israel&#x27;s coalition government approved the security barrier in the northern part of the green line between Israel and the West Bank. According to the IDF, since the erection of the fence, terrorist acts have declined by approximately 90%. The decline in attacks can also be attributed to the permanent presence of Israeli troops inside and around Palestinian cities and increasing security cooperation between the IDF and the Palestinian Authority during this period. The barrier followed a route that ran almost entirely through land occupied by Israel in June 1967, unilaterally seizing more than 10% of the West Bank, including whole neighborhoods and settlement blocs, while splitting Palestinian villages in half with immediate effects on Palestinian&#x27;s freedom of movement. The barrier, in some areas, isolated farmers from their fields and children from their schools, while also restricting Palestinians from moving within the West Bank or pursuing employment in Israel.

In 2004 the International Court of Justice ruled that the construction of the barrier violated the Palestinian right to self-determination, contravened the Fourth Geneva Convention, and could not be justified as a measure of Israeli self-defense. The ICJ further expressed that the construction of the wall by Israel could become a permanent fixture, altering the status quo. Israel&#x27;s High Court, however, disagreed with the ICJ&#x27;s conclusions, stating that they lacked a factual basis. Several human rights organizations, including B&#x27;Tselem, Human Rights Watch, and Amnesty International, echoed the ICJ&#x27;s concerns. They suggested that the wall&#x27;s route was designed to perpetuate the existence of settlements and facilitate their future annexation into Israel, and that the wall was a means for Israel to consolidate control over land used for illegal settlements. The sophisticated structure of the wall also indicated its likely permanence.

Since 2001, the threat of Qassam rockets fired from Palestinian territories into Israel continues to be of great concern for Israeli defense officials. In 2006—the year following Israel&#x27;s disengagement from the Gaza Strip—the Israeli government claimed to have recorded 1,726 such launches, more than four times the total rockets fired in 2005. As of January 2009, over 8,600 rockets have been launched, causing widespread psychological trauma and disruption of daily life. As a result of these attacks, Israelis living in southern Israel have had to spend long periods in bomb shelters. The relatively small payload carried on these rockets, Israel&#x27;s advanced early warning system, American-supplied anti-missile capabilities, and network of shelters made the rockets rarely lethal. In 2014, out of 4,000 rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, only six Israeli civilians were killed. For comparison, the payload carried on these rockets is smaller than Israeli tank shells, of which 49,000 were fired in Gaza in 2014.

There is significant debate within Israel about how to deal with the country&#x27;s security concerns. Options have included military action (including targeted killings and house demolitions of terrorist operatives), diplomacy, unilateral gestures toward peace, and increased security measures such as checkpoints, roadblocks and security barriers. The legality and the wisdom of all of the above tactics have been called into question by various commentators.

Since mid-June 2007, Israel&#x27;s primary means of dealing with security concerns in the West Bank has been to cooperate with and permit United States-sponsored training, equipping, and funding of the Palestinian Authority&#x27;s security forces, which with Israeli help have largely succeeded in quelling West Bank supporters of Hamas.

===Water resources===
In the Middle East, water resources are of great political concern. Since Israel receives much of its water from two large underground aquifers which continue under the Green Line, the use of this water has been contentious in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Israel withdraws most water from these areas, but it also supplies the West Bank with approximately 40 million cubic metres annually, contributing to 77% of Palestinians&#x27; water supply in the West Bank, which is to be shared for a population of about 2.6 million.


While Israel&#x27;s consumption of this water has decreased since it began its occupation of the West Bank, it still consumes the majority of it: in the 1950s, Israel consumed 95% of the water output of the Western Aquifer, and 82% of that produced by the Northeastern Aquifer. Although this water was drawn entirely on Israel&#x27;s own side of the pre-1967 border, the sources of the water are nevertheless from the shared groundwater basins located under both West Bank and Israel.

In the Oslo II Accord, both sides agreed to maintain &quot;existing quantities of utilization from the resources.&quot; In so doing, the Palestinian Authority established the legality of Israeli water production in the West Bank, subject to a Joint Water Committee (JWC). Moreover, Israel obligated itself in this agreement to provide water to supplement Palestinian production, and further agreed to allow additional Palestinian drilling in the Eastern Aquifer, also subject to the Joint Water Committee. The water that Israel receives comes mainly from the Jordan River system, the Sea of Galilee and two underground sources. According to a 2003 BBC article the Palestinians lack access to the Jordan River system.

According to a report of 2008 by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, water resources were confiscated for the benefit of the Israeli settlements in the Ghor. Palestinian irrigation pumps on the Jordan River were destroyed or confiscated after the 1967 war and Palestinians were not allowed to use water from the Jordan River system. Furthermore, the authorities did not allow any new irrigation wells to be drilled by Palestinian farmers, while it provided fresh water and allowed drilling wells for irrigation purposes at the Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

A report was released by the UN in August 2012 and Max Gaylard, the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in the occupied Palestinian territory, explained at the launch of the publication: &quot;Gaza will have half a million more people by 2020 while its economy will grow only slowly. In consequence, the people of Gaza will have an even harder time getting enough drinking water and electricity, or sending their children to school&quot;. Gaylard present alongside Jean Gough, of the UN Children&#x27;s Fund (UNICEF), and Robert Turner, of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). The report projects that Gaza&#x27;s population will increase from 1.6 million people to 2.1 million people in 2020, leading to a density of more than 5,800 people per square kilometre.

====Future and financing====
Numerous foreign nations and international organizations have established bilateral agreements with the Palestinian and Israeli water authorities. It was estimated that a future investment of about US$1.1bn for the West Bank and $0.8bn for the Gaza Strip Southern Governorates was needed for the planning period from 2003 to 2015.

In late 2012, a donation of $21.6 million was announced by the Government of the Netherlands—the Dutch government stated that the funds would be provided to the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), for the specific benefit of Palestinian children. An article, published by the UN News website, stated that: &quot;Of the $21.6 million, $5.7 will be allocated to UNRWA&#x27;s 2012 Emergency Appeal for the occupied Palestinian territory, which will support programmes in the West Bank and Gaza aiming to mitigate the effects on refugees of the deteriorating situation they face.&quot;

===Agricultural rights===

The conflict has been about land since its inception. When Israel became a state after the war in 1948, 77% of Palestine&#x27;s land was used for the creation on the state. The majority of those living in Palestine at the time became refugees in other countries and this first land crisis became the root of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Because the root of the conflict is with land, the disputes between Israel and Palestine are well-manifested in the agriculture of Palestine.

In Palestine, agriculture is a mainstay in the economy. The production of agricultural goods supports the population&#x27;s sustenance needs and fuels Palestine&#x27;s export economy. According to the Council for European Palestinian Relations, the agricultural sector formally employs 13.4% of the population and informally employs 90% of the population. Over the past 10 years, unemployment rates in Palestine have increased and the agricultural sector became the most impoverished sector in Palestine. Unemployment rates peaked in 2008 when they reached 41% in Gaza.

Palestinian agriculture suffers from numerous problems including Israeli military and civilian attacks on farms and farmers, blockades to exportation of produce and importation of necessary inputs, widespread confiscation of land for nature reserves as well as military and settler use, confiscation and destruction of wells, and physical barriers within the West Bank.

===Israel&#x27;s West Bank barrier===
With the construction of the separation barrier, the Israeli state promised free movement across regions. However, border closures, curfews, and checkpoints has significantly restricted Palestinian movement. In 2012, there were 99 fixed check points and 310 flying checkpoints. The border restrictions impacted the imports and exports in Palestine and weakened the industrial and agricultural sectors because of the constant Israeli control in the West Bank and Gaza. In order for the Palestinian economy to be prosperous, the restrictions on Palestinian land must be removed. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot; and a report for World Bank, the Palestinian economy lost $3.4bn (%35 of the annual GDP) to Israeli restrictions in the West Bank alone.

===Palestinian violence outside of Israel===
Some Palestinians have committed violent acts over the globe on the pretext of a struggle against Israel.

During the late 1960s, groups affiliated with the PLO became increasingly infamous for its use of international terror. In 1969 alone, these groups were responsible for hijacking 82 planes. El Al Airlines became a regular hijacking target. The hijacking of Air France Flight 139 by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine culminated during a hostage-rescue mission, where Israeli special forces successfully rescued the majority of the hostages.

One of the most well-known and notorious terrorist acts was the capture and eventual murder of 11 Israeli athletes by the Black September Organization during the 1972 Summer Olympics.

===Palestinian-on-Palestinian violence===
Fighting among rival Palestinian and Arab movements has played a crucial role in shaping Israel&#x27;s security policy towards Palestinian militants, as well as in the Palestinian leadership&#x27;s own policies. As early as the 1930s revolts in Palestine, Arab forces fought each other while also skirmishing with Zionist and British forces, and internal conflicts continue to the present day.

In the First Intifada, more than a thousand Palestinians were killed in a campaign initiated by the Palestine Liberation Organization to crack down on suspected Israeli security service informers and collaborators. The Palestinian Authority was strongly criticized for its treatment of alleged collaborators, rights groups complaining that those labeled collaborators were denied fair trials. According to a report released by the Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group, less than 45 percent of those killed were actually guilty of informing for Israel.

===Overriding authority and international status===

As far as Israel is concerned, the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority is derived from the Oslo Accords, signed with the PLO, under which it acquired control over cities in the Palestinian territories (Area A) while the surrounding countryside came either under Israeli security and Palestinian civil administration (Area B) or complete Israeli civil administration (Area C). Israel has built additional highways to allow Israelis to traverse the area without entering Palestinian cities in Area A. The initial areas under Palestinian Authority control are diverse and non-contiguous. The areas have changed over time by subsequent negotiations, including Oslo II, Wye River and Sharm el-Sheik. According to Palestinians, the separated areas make it impossible to create a viable nation and fails to address Palestinian security needs; Israel has expressed no agreement to withdrawal from some Areas B, resulting in no reduction in the division of the Palestinian areas, and the institution of a safe pass system, without Israeli checkpoints, between these parts.

Under the Oslo Accords, as a security measure, Israel has insisted on its control over all land, sea and air border crossings into the Palestinian territories, and the right to set import and export controls. This is to enable Israel to control the entry into the territories of materials of military significance and of potentially dangerous persons.

The PLO&#x27;s objective for international recognition of the State of Palestine is considered by Israel as a provocative &quot;unilateral&quot; act that is inconsistent with the Oslo Accords.

===Economic disputes and boycotts===
In Gaza, the agricultural market suffers from economic boycotts and border closures and restrictions placed by Israel. The PA&#x27;s Minister of Agriculture estimates that around US$1.2 billion were lost in September 2006 because of these security measures. This embargo was brought on by Hamas&#x27; refusal to recognize Israel&#x27;s right to statehood. As a result, , the PA&#x27;s 160,000 employees had not received their salaries in over one year.

==Fatalities==


Studies provide aggregated casualty data for the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, 13,000 Israelis and Palestinians were killed in the conflict between 1948 and 1997. Other estimates give 14,500 killed between 1948 and 2009. During the 1982 Lebanon War, Israel killed an estimated 20,000 Palestinians and Lebanese, not including the 800–3,500 Palestinians killed in the Sabra-Shatila Massacre.

According to B&#x27;tselem, during the first intifada from 1987 until 2000, 1,551 Palestinians and 421 Israelis lost their lives. According to the database of the UNOffice for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs – occupied Palestinian territory (OCHAoPt), 6,407 Palestinians and 308 Israelis were killed in the conflict from 2008 to September 2023, before the Israel–Hamas war.

Figures include both Israeli civilians and security forces casualties in West Bank, Gaza and Israel. All numbers refer to casualties of direct conflict between Israelis and Palestinians including in IDF military operations, artillery shelling, search and arrest campaigns, barrier demonstrations, targeted killings, settler violence etc. The figures do not include events indirectly related to the conflict such as casualties from unexploded ordnance, etc., or events when the circumstances remain unclear or are in dispute. The figures include all reported casualties of all ages and both genders.

As reported by the Israeli human rights group B&#x27;Tselem, from 29 September 2000 to the year 2010, a total of 7,454 Palestinian and Israeli individuals were killed due to the conflict. According to the report, 1,317 of the 6,371 Palestinians were minors, and at least 2,996 did not participate in fighting at the time of death. Palestinians killed 1,083 Israelis, including 741 civilians, of whom 124 were minors.

===Criticism of casualty statistics===
The Israeli-based International Policy Institute for Counter-Terrorism (ICT) claimed that Israeli and Palestinian human rights groups overestimated the percentage of civilians killed since the IDF suspected many of those killed to be possible militants.

During Operation Cast Lead, Israeli figures reported the number of Palestinians killed at 1,166 Palestinian, 60 percent were classified as &quot;terrorists&quot; by Israeli officials. This discrepancy is partially due to Israel&#x27;s classification of Gazan police, who did not take part in hostilities, as combatants. The broad consensus among human rights organizations is that these police were primarily civilians, as they did not actively participate in hostilities nor were they part of armed groups. The accuracy of Israeli casualty figures was further questioned based on the number of children killed. Israel reported 89 Palestinian minors killed, whereas the human rights organization B&#x27;Tselem reported 252, substantiating their figures with birth and death certificates and other documents in almost all cases. The Israeli figures also stand out against the figures published by the US Department of State, which reported the number killed &quot;at close to 1,400 Palestinians, including more than 1,000 civilians.&quot;

=== Landmines and unexploded ordnance ===
A comprehensive collection mechanism to gather land mine and explosive remnants of war (ERW) casualty data does not exist for the Palestinian territories. In 2009, the United Nations Mine Action Centre reported that more than 2,500 mine and explosive remnants of war casualties occurred between 1967 and 1998, at least 794 casualties (127 killed, 654 injured and 13 unknown) occurred between 1999 and 2008 and that 12 people had been killed and 27 injured since the Gaza War. The UN Mine Action Centre identified the main risks as coming from &quot;ERW left behind by Israeli aerial and artillery weapon systems, or from militant caches targeted by the Israeli forces.&quot; There are at least 15 confirmed minefields in the West Bank on the border with Jordan. The Palestinian National Security Forces do not have maps or records of the minefields.

<text>Sowing is the process of planting seeds. An area that has had seeds planted in it will be described as a sowed or sown area.
When sowing it is important to:
* Use quality seeds 
* Maintain proper distance between seeds
* Plant at correct depth
* Ensure the soil is clean , healthy , and free of pathogens (disease causing microorganisms)

==Plants which are usually sown==
Among the major field crops, oats, wheat, and rye are sown, grasses and legumes are seeded and maize and soybeans are planted. In planting, wider rows (generally 75 cm (30 in) or more) are used, and the intent is to have precise; even spacing between individual seeds in the row, various mechanisms have been devised to count out individual seeds at exact intervals.

===Depth of sowing ===
In sowing, little if any soil is placed over the seeds, as seeds can be generally sown into the soil by maintaining a planting depth of about 2-3 times the size of the seed.

===Sowing types and patterns===
For hand sowing, several sowing types exist; these include:
* Flat sowing
* Ridge sowing
* Wide bed sowing

Several patterns for sowing may be used together with these types; these include:
* Rows that are indented at the even rows (so that the seeds are
* Symmetrical grid pattern – using the pattern described in The Garden of Cyrus placed in a crossed pattern). This method is much better, as more light may fall on the seedlings as they come out.

==Types of sowing==

===Hand sowing===
Hand sowing or (planting) is the process of casting handfuls of seed over prepared ground: broadcasting, that is, broadcast seeding (from which the technological term is derived). Usually, a drag or harrow is employed to incorporate the seed into the soil. Though labor-intensive for any but small areas, this method is still used in some situations. Practice is required to sow evenly and at the desired rate. A hand seeder can be used for sowing, though it is less of a help than it is for the smaller seeds of grasses and legumes.
Hand sowing may be combined with pre-sowing in seed trays. This allows the plants to come to strength indoors during cold periods (e.g. spring in temperate countries).

=== Seed drill ===
In agriculture, most seed is now sown using a seed drill, which offers greater precision; seed is sown evenly and at the desired rate. The drill also places the seed at a measured distance below the soil, so that less seed is required. The standard design uses a fluted feed metering system, which is volumetric in nature; individual seeds are not counted. Rows are typically about 10–30 cm apart, depending on the crop species and growing conditions. Several row opener types are used depending on soil type and local tradition. Grain drills are most often drawn by tractors, but can also be pulled by horses. Pickup trucks are sometimes used, since little draft is required.

A seed rate of about 100 kg of seed per hectare (2 bushels per acre) is typical, though rates vary considerably depending on crop species, soil conditions, and farmer&#x27;s preference. Excessive rates can cause the crop to lodge, while too thin a rate will result in poor utilisation of the land, competition with weeds and a reduction in the yield.

===Open field===

Open-field planting refers to the form of sowing used historically in the agricultural context whereby fields are prepared generically and left open, as the name suggests, before being sown directly with seed. The seed is frequently left uncovered at the surface of the soil before germinating and therefore exposed to the prevailing climate and conditions like storms etc. This is in contrast to the seedbed method used more commonly in domestic gardening or more specific (modern) agricultural scenarios where the seed is applied beneath the soil surface and monitored and manually tended frequently to ensure more successful growth rates and better yields.

===Pre-treatment of seed and soil before sowing===
Before sowing, certain seeds first require a treatment prior to the sowing process.
This treatment may be seed scarification, stratification, seed soaking or seed cleaning with cold (or medium hot) water.

Seed soaking is generally done by placing seeds in medium hot water for at least 24 to up to 48 hours
Seed cleaning is done especially with fruit, as the flesh of the fruit around the seed can quickly become prone to attack from insects or plagues. Seed washing is generally done by submerging cleansed seeds 20 minutes in 50 degree Celsius water. This (rather hot than moderately hot) water kills any organisms that may have survived on the skin of a seed. Especially with easily infected tropical fruit such as lychees and rambutans, seed washing with high-temperature water is vital.

In addition to the mentioned seed pretreatments, seed germination is also assisted when a disease-free soil is used. Especially when trying to germinate difficult seed (e.g. certain tropical fruit), prior treatment of the soil (along with the usage of the most suitable soil; e.g. potting soil, prepared soil or other substrates) is vital. The two most used soil treatments are pasteurisation and sterilisation. Depending on the necessity, pasteurisation is to be preferred as this does not kill all organisms. Sterilisation can be done when trying to grow truly difficult crops. To pasteurise the soil, the soil is heated for 15 minutes in an oven of 120 °C.

<doc id="46224" wikidata="Q194383" url="?curid=46224" title="16 mm film">
<text>16 mm film is a historically popular and economical gauge of film. 16 mm refers to the width of the film (about inch); other common film gauges include 8 mm and 35 mm. It is generally used for non-theatrical (e.g., industrial, educational, television) film-making, or for low-budget motion pictures. It also existed as a popular amateur or home movie-making format for several decades, alongside 8 mm film and later Super 8 film. Eastman Kodak released the first 16 mm &quot;outfit&quot; in 1923, consisting of a Ciné-Kodak camera, Kodascope projector, tripod, screen and splicer, for US$335 (). RCA-Victor introduced a 16 mm sound movie projector in 1932, and developed an optical sound-on-film 16 mm camera, released in 1935.

== History ==

Eastman Kodak introduced 16 mm film in 1923, as a less expensive alternative to 35 mm film for amateurs. The same year the Victor Animatograph Corporation started producing their own 16 mm cameras and projectors. During the 1920s, the format was often referred to by the professional industry as &#x27;sub-standard&#x27;.

Kodak hired Willard Beech Cook from his 28 mm Pathescope of America company to create the new 16 mm &#x27;Kodascope Library&#x27;. In addition to making home movies, people could buy or rent films from the library, a key selling aspect of the format.

Intended for amateur use, 16 mm film was one of the first formats to use acetate safety film as a film base. Kodak never used nitrate film for the format, owing to the high flammability of the nitrate base. 35 mm nitrate was discontinued in 1952.

=== Production evolution ===

The silent 16 mm format was initially aimed at the home enthusiast, but by the 1930s it had begun to make inroads into the educational market. The addition of optical sound tracks and, most notably, Kodachrome in 1935, gave an enormous boost to its popularity. The format was used extensively during World War II, and there was a huge expansion of 16 mm professional filmmaking in the post-war years. Films for government, business, medical and industrial clients created a large network of 16 mm professional filmmakers and related service industries in the 1950s and 1960s. The advent of television production also enhanced the use of 16 mm film, initially for its advantage of cost and portability over 35 mm. At first used as a news-gathering format, the 16 mm format was also used to create television programming shot outside the confines of the more rigid television studio production sets. The home movie market gradually switched to the even less expensive 8 mm and Super 8 mm film formats.

16 mm, using light cameras, was extensively used for television production in many countries before portable video cameras appeared. In Britain, the BBC&#x27;s Ealing-based film department made significant use of 16mm film and, during its peak, employed over 50 film crews. Throughout much of the 1960s–1990s period, these crews made use of cameras such as the Arriflex ST and Eclair NPR in combination with quarter-inch sound recorders, such as the Nagra III. Using these professional tools, film department crews would work on some of the most significant programmes produced by the BBC, including &quot;Man Alive&quot;, &quot;Panorama&quot; and &quot;Chronicle&quot;. Usually made up of five people, these small crews were able to work incredibly efficiently and, even in hostile environments, were able to film an entire programme with a shooting ratio of less than 5:1.

Beginning in the 1950s, news organizations and documentarians in the United States frequently shot on portable Auricon and, later, CP-16 cameras that were self-blimped and had the ability to record sound directly on film. The introduction of magnetic striped film further improved sound fidelity.

Replacing analog video devices, digital video has made significant inroads in television production use. Nevertheless, 16 mm is still in use in its Super 16 ratio (see below) for productions seeking its specific look.

== Format standards ==

=== Perforations ===
Two perforation pitches are available for 16 mm film. One specification, known as &quot;long pitch&quot;, has a spacing of and is used primarily for print and reversal film stocks. Negative and intermediate film stocks have perforations spaced , known as &quot;short pitch&quot;. These differences allow for the sharpest and smoothest possible image when making prints using a contact printer.

Film stocks are available in either &#x27;single-perf&#x27; or &#x27;double-perf&#x27;, meaning the film is perforated on either one or both edges. A perforation for 16 mm film is with a radius curve on all four corners of . Tolerances are ±.

=== Standard 16 mm ===
The picture-taking area of standard 16 mm is , an aspect ratio of , the standard pre-widescreen Academy ratio for 35 mm. The &quot;nominal&quot; picture projection area (per SMPTE RP 20-2003) is 0.380 in by 0.284 in, and the maximum picture projection area (per SMPTE ST 233-2003) is 0.384 in by 0.286 in, each implying an aspect ratio of 1.34:1. Double-perf 16 mm film, the original format, has a perforation at both sides of every frame line. Single-perf is perforated at one side only, making room for an optical or magnetic soundtrack along the other side.

=== Super 16 mm ===

The variant called Super 16 mm, Super 16, or 16 mm Type W is an adaptation of the 1.66 (1.66:1 or 15:9) aspect ratio of the &quot;Paramount format&quot; to 16 mm film. It was developed by Swedish cinematographer Rune Ericson in 1969, using single-sprocket film and taking advantage of the extra room for an expanded picture area of , giving an aspect ratio of .

Super 16 cameras are usually 16 mm cameras that have had the film gate and ground glass in the viewfinder modified for the wider frame, and, since this process widens the frame by affecting only one side of the film, the various cameras&#x27; front mounting plate or turret areas must also be re-machined to shift and re-center the mounts for any lenses used. Because the resulting, new, Super 16 aspect ratio takes up the space originally reserved for the 16mm soundtrack, films shot in this format must be enlarged by optical printing to 35 mm for sound-projection, and, in order to preserve the proper 1.66:1, or (slightly cropped) 1.85:1 theatrical aspect ratios which this format was designed to provide. And, with the recent development of digital intermediate workflows, it is now possible to digitally enlarge to a 35 mm sound print with virtually no quality loss (given a high quality digital scan), or alternatively to use high-quality video equipment for the original image capture.

In 2009, German lens manufacturer Vantage introduced a series of anamorphic lenses under its HAWK brand. These provided a 1.30x squeeze factor (as opposed to the standard 2×) specifically for the Super 16 format, allowing nearly all of the Super 16 frame to be used for 2.39:1 widescreen photography.

=== Ultra 16 mm ===

The DIY-crafted Ultra 16 is a variation of Super 16. Cinematographer Frank G. DeMarco is credited with inventing Ultra 16 in 1996 while shooting tests for Darren Aronofsky&#x27;s &quot;Pi&quot;. Ultra 16 is created by widening the left and right sides of the gate of a standard 16 mm camera by 0.7 mm to expose part of the horizontal area between the perforations. Perforation placement on standard 16 mm film at the divisions between frames accommodates use of these normally unexposed areas.

The Ultra 16 format, with frame dimensions of , provides a frame size between standard 16 mm and Super 16—while avoiding the expense of converting a 16 mm camera to Super 16, the larger lens-element requirements for proper aperture field coverage on Super 16 camera conversions, and, the potential image vignetting caused by trying to use some &quot;conventional&quot; 16 mm lenses on those Super 16 converted cameras. Thus, almost all standard 16 mm optics can now achieve the wider image in Ultra 16, but without the above pitfalls and optical &quot;shortcomings&quot; encountered when attempting their use for Super 16.

The frame has an aspect ratio of , which readily converts to NTSC/PAL (1.33 ratio), HDTV (1.78 ratio) and to 35 mm film (1.66 [European] and 1.85 wide screen ratios), using either the full vertical frame, or the full width (intersprocket) frame, and at times, portions of both, depending upon the required application.

== Modern usage ==
The only suppliers of 16 mm color reversal/negative film in 2022 are Kodak and Orwo. Agfa and Fuji closed their film manufacturing facilities in the 2010s. B&amp;W films are still produced by Foma and ORWO/Filmotec, with ORWO/Filmotec having begun sales of a new color negative film in April of 2023 .

16 mm film is used in television, such as for the &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; anthology (it has since been produced in 16:9 high definition) and &quot;Friday Night Lights&quot; and &quot;The O.C.&quot; as well as &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; in the US. In the UK, the format is exceedingly popular for television series such as &quot;Doc Martin&quot;, dramas and commercials.

The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) played a large part in the development of the format. It worked extensively with Kodak during the 1950s and 1960s to bring 16 mm to a professional level, since the BBC needed cheaper, more portable production solutions while maintaining a higher quality than was offered at the time, when the format was mostly for home display of theatrical shorts, newsreels, and cartoons, documentary capture and display for various purposes (including education), and limited &quot;high end&quot; amateur use.

, the format was frequently used for student films, while its use in documentaries had almost disappeared. With the advent of HDTV, Super 16 film is still used for some productions destined for HD. Some low-budget theatrical features are shot on 16 mm and super 16 mm such as Kevin Smith&#x27;s 16 mm 1994 independent hit &quot;Clerks,&quot; or &quot;Man Bites Dog&quot;, &quot;Mid90s&quot; and &quot;Closer to Home&quot;.

Thanks to advances in film stock and digital technology—specifically digital intermediate (DI)—the format has dramatically improved in picture quality since the 1970s, and is now a revitalized option. &quot;Vera Drake&quot;, for example, was shot on Super 16 mm film, digitally scanned at a high resolution, edited and color graded, and then printed out onto 35 mm film via a laser film recorder. Because of the digital process, the final 35 mm print quality is good enough to fool some professionals into thinking it was shot on 35 mm.

In Britain, most exterior television footage was shot on 16 mm from the 1960s until the 1990s, when the development of more portable television cameras and videotape machines led to video replacing 16 mm in many instances. Many drama shows and documentaries were made entirely on 16 mm, notably &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot;, &quot;The Jewel in the Crown&quot;, &quot;The Ascent of Man&quot;, &quot;Life on Earth&quot;, and the early seasons of &quot;Poirot&quot;. More recently, the advent of widescreen television has led to the use of &quot;Super&quot; 16. For example, the 2008 BBC fantasy drama series &quot;Merlin&quot; was shot in Super 16.

As recently as 2010, &quot;Scrubs&quot; was shot on Super16 and aired either as 4:3 SD (first 7 seasons) or as 16:9 HD (seasons 8 and 9). John Inwood, the cinematographer of the series, believed that footage from his Aaton XTR Prod camera was not only sufficient to air in high definition, it &quot;looked terrific&quot;.

The Academy Award winning &quot;Leaving Las Vegas&quot; (1995) was shot on 16 mm.

The first two seasons of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; were shot on 16 mm and switched to 35 mm for its later seasons.

The first season of &quot;Sex and the City&quot; was shot on 16 mm. Later seasons were shot on 35 mm. All three seasons of &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; were shot on 16 mm and aired in HD. &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot;, and Christopher Guest&#x27;s subsequent mockumentary films, are shot in Super 16 mm.

The first three seasons of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; (bar the season 3 finale and the effects shots) were shot in 16 mm, before switching to 35 mm for later seasons.

Peter Jackson&#x27;s 1992 zombie comedy &quot;Braindead&quot; was shot on Super 16mm, so that more of its $3 million budget could be spent on its extensive gore effects.

Catherine Hardwicke&#x27;s 2003 teen drama &quot;Thirteen (2003 film)&quot; was shot on Super 16mm, due to low budget of $2 million. 

The 2009 Academy Award winner for Best Picture, &quot;The Hurt Locker&quot;, was shot using Aaton Super 16 mm cameras and Fujifilm 16 mm film stocks. The cost savings over 35 mm allowed the production to utilize multiple cameras for many shots, exposing over one million feet of film.

British Napoleonic-era TV drama &quot;Sharpe&quot; was shot on Super 16 mm right through to the film &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Challenge&quot; (2006). For the last film in the series, &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Peril&quot; (2008), the producers switched to 35 mm.

&quot;Moonrise Kingdom&quot; was shot using super 16 mm.

Darren Aronofsky shot &quot;mother!&quot; on 16 mm.

Linus Sandgren shot most of the 2018 biographical drama &quot;First Man&quot; on Super 16.

Spike Lee shot the Netflix film &quot;Da 5 Bloods&quot;″ flashback scenes on 16 mm film, which was part of the reason cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel was considered for an Oscar nomination. &quot;The Insider&quot; reports that Netflix was &quot;initially concerned about having the movie&#x27;s flashback scenes shot on grainy 16 mm film ... There was pushback because it opened up a lot of challenges.&quot; According to Sigel, the film stock Lee wanted to use was expensive because it is rarely used. It would be even more expensive to shoot on 16mm film while on location in Vietnam and then ship the film back to the United States to be processed at a film lab. Lee was &quot;pretty adamant&quot; about using 16mm for the flashbacks; Sigel said &quot;I would never have been able to do it without such fervent support from him.&quot; Sigel had pitched to Lee the idea to shoot the Vietnam sequences using the kind of camera and film stock that would have been available during the Vietnam era.

Cornish filmmaker Mark Jenkin is notable for using 16 mm film and a hand-cranked 1978 Bolex camera, most notably in his films &quot;Bait&quot; (2019) and &quot;Enys Men&quot; (2022).

16mm film was also used to produce early Full-Motion Video arcade games, such as Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Wild Gunman&quot; (1974) and Kasco&#x27;s &quot;The Driver&quot; (1979). These games would consist of one or more 16mm projectors that the game hardware would alternate between to display different outcomes depending on the player&#x27;s actions; In single-projector systems, such as the one used in Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Sky Hawk&quot; (1976), both outcomes would appear simultaneously on the same film in split-screen, with the game instead adjusting the film&#x27;s framing so that only one outcome could be seen at a time. 

=== Digital 16 mm ===
A number of digital cameras approximate the look of the 16 mm format by using 16 mm-sized sensors and taking 16 mm lenses. These cameras include the Ikonoskop A-Cam DII (2008) and the Digital Bolex (2012). The Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera (2013) and the Blackmagic Micro Cinema Camera (2015) has a Super 16-sized sensor. The Z CAM E2G (2019) even offers Digital 16 mm in 4K and with a global shutter.

== Cameras ==
=== Professional cameras ===

The professional industry tends to use 16 mm cameras from Aaton and Arri, most notably the Aaton Xtera, Aaton XTRprod, Arriflex 16SR3, and Arriflex 416. Aaton also released the A-Minima, which is about the size of a video camcorder and is used for specialized filming requiring smaller, more versatile cameras. Photo Sonics have special extremely high speed cameras for 16 mm that film at up to 1,000 frames per second. Panavision has produced the Panaflex 16, nicknamed &quot;Elaine&quot;.

=== Amateur cameras ===
For amateur, hobbyist, and student use, it is more economical to use older models from Arri, Aaton, Auricon, Beaulieu, Bell and Howell, Bolex, Canon, Cinema Products, Eclair, Keystone, Krasnogorsk, Mitchell, and others.

== Film reproduction methods ==
Most original movie production companies that use film shoot on 35 mm. The 35 mm size must be converted or reduced to 16 mm for 16 mm systems. There are multiple ways of obtaining a 16 mm print from 35 mm. The preferred method is to strike a 16 mm negative from the original 35 mm negative and then make a print from the new 16 mm negative. A 16 mm negative struck from the original 35 mm negative is called an &quot;original&quot;. A new 16 mm print made from a print with no negative is called a &quot;reversal&quot;.
16 mm prints can be made from many combinations of size and format, each with a distinct, descriptive name:
* A 16 mm negative struck from an original 35 mm print is a &quot;print down&quot;.
* A 16 mm negative struck from an original 16 mm print that was struck from a 35 mm original is a &quot;dupe down&quot;.
* A 16 mm print struck directly from a 16 mm print is a &quot;double dupe&quot;.
* A 16 mm print struck directly from a 35 mm print is a &quot;double dupe down&quot;.

Film traders often refer to 16 mm prints by the print&#x27;s production method, i.e., an &quot;original&quot;, &quot;reversal&quot;, &quot;dupe down&quot;, &quot;double dupe&quot;, or &quot;double dupe down&quot;.

=== Color fading of old film and color recovery ===
Over time, the cyan, magenta and yellow dyes that form the image in color 16 mm film inevitably fade. The rate of deterioration depends on storage conditions and the film type. In the case of Kodachrome amateur and documentary films and Technicolor IB (imbibition process) color prints, the dyes are so stable and the deterioration so slow that even prints now over 70 years old typically show no obvious problems.

Dyes in the far more common Eastmancolor print film and similar products from other manufacturers are notoriously unstable. Prior to the introduction of a longer-lasting &quot;low fade&quot; type in 1979, Eastmancolor prints routinely suffered from easily seen color shift and fading within ten years. The dyes degrade at different rates, with magenta being the longest-lasting, eventually resulting in a pale reddish image with little if any other color discernible.

In the process of digitizing old color films, even badly faded source material can sometimes be restored to full color through digital techniques that amplify the faded dye colors. A digital intermediate scanned from the original negative (if it was processed and stored correctly) can often fully restore colors.

<text>8 mm film is a motion picture film format in which the film strip is wide. It exists in two main versions – the original standard 8 mm film, also known as regular 8 mm, and Super 8. Although both standard 8 mm and Super 8 are 8 mm wide, Super 8 has a larger image area because of its smaller and more widely spaced perforations.

There are also two other varieties of Super 8 – Single 8 mm and Straight-8 – that require different cameras but produce a final film with the same dimensions.

==Standard 8==


The standard 8 mm (also known as regular 8 or double 8) film format was developed by the Eastman Kodak company during the Great Depression and released to the market in 1932 to create a home movie format that was less expensive than 16 mm.

Double 8 spools actually contain a 16 mm film with twice as many perforations along each edge as normal 16 mm film; on its first pass through the camera, the film is exposed only along half of its width. When the first pass is complete, the operator opens the camera and flips and swaps the spools (the design of the spool hole ensures that the operator does this properly) and the same film is subsequently exposed along its other edge, the edge left unexposed on the first pass. After the film is developed, the processor splits it down the middle, resulting in two lengths of 8 mm film, each with a single row of perforations along one edge. Each frame is half the width and half the height of a 16 mm frame, so there are four times the number of frames in a given film area, which is what makes it cost less. Because of the two passes of the film, the format was sometimes called &quot;Double 8&quot;. The frame size of regular 8 mm is 4.8 mm × 3.5 mm, and 1 meter of film contains 264 pictures. Normally, Double 8 is filmed at 16 or 18 frames per second.

Common length film spools allowed filming of about 3 to minutes at 12, 15, 16, and 18 frames per second.

Kodak ceased sales of standard 8 mm film under its own brand in the early 1990s but continued to manufacture the film, which was sold via independent film stores. Black-and-white 8 mm film is still manufactured in the Czech Republic, and several companies buy bulk quantities of 16 mm film to make regular 8 mm by re-perforating the stock, cutting it into 25 foot (7.6 m) lengths, and collecting it into special standard 8 mm spools, which they then sell. Re-perforation requires special equipment. Some specialists also produce Super 8 mm film from existing 16 mm or even 35 mm film stock.

===Sound===

When Eastman Kodak first conceived the 8 mm format, no provision was made for the addition of a sound track. Nevertheless, in the 1960s, projectors appeared on the market that were capable of recording and replaying sound from a magnetic stripe applied to the film after it had been processed. The only part of the film wide enough to accept such a magnetic stripe was the area between the edge and the perforations. A much narrower stripe was sometimes added to the opposite edge so that the film piled up evenly on the spool, but was never used for sound. The sound to picture separation was the same dimensionally as 16 mm film, and as that format is 28 frames, that meant that the Double-8 system was 56 frames. The proximity of the sound stripe to the perforations caused some problems in keeping the film in close contact with the sound head. There was never an optical system.

A few sound prints appeared for use in Double 8 projectors.

==Super 8==

In 1965, Super-8 film was released and was quickly adopted by many amateur film-makers. It featured a better quality image and was easier to use mainly due to a cartridge-loading system that did not require reloading and rethreading halfway through.

To easily differentiate Super 8 film from Standard 8, projector spools for the former had larger spindle holes. Therefore, it was not possible to mount a Super 8 spool on a Standard 8 projector, and vice versa.

===Sound===

The Super 8 format was designed from the start to accommodate a sound track (one of the few film formats to do so). This track would occupy the area between the edge of the film and the image area. As in the double 8 system, a second stripe was sometimes added between the edge and the perforations. The image to sound distance was much shorter for the Super 8 system at just 18 frames.

At first, the magnetic stripe had to be applied after the film was processed and recorded on a suitable projector. In the 1970s, cameras appeared which were able to record live sound directly onto pre-striped film. This film was loaded into oversize cartridges that provided access for the camera&#x27;s sound recording head. The camera would also accept non sound cartridges, but silent cameras could not accept sound cartridges. One major advantage of the Super 8 system was that as the camera pressure plate was a part of the cartridge, it could be moulded to the profile of the stripe(s) on the film.

Projectors also appeared on the market which took advantage of the balance stripe next to the perforations by recording and replaying stereo sound.

Projectors appeared in the late 1970s that featured the ability to play films with an optical soundtrack. The image-sound separation for the optical format was 22 frames. These were never popular in the English speaking world and are consequently very rare in those countries, but they did enjoy some popularity in the Far East and Europe mainly because optical prints were cheaper.

Sound prints in Super 8 were plentiful and considering that they were very expensive by modern-day standards, sold in appreciable quantities. A two-reel print (running approximately 17 minutes) cost around $50 with feature films costing at least $150-plus. A few prints were also released with stereo sound. In Europe, optical prints were also popular and were appreciated for their often superior sound quality. In theory, magnetic prints should have been superior, but Super 8 magnetic prints were often poorly recorded after the picture was processed, due to high-speed, mass production techniques. An optical track, on the other hand, could be printed at the same time as the image and in equivalent quality.

==Single 8==
Another version of Super 8 film, Single-8, was produced by Fuji in Japan. Introduced in 1965 as an alternative to the Kodak Super 8 format, it had the same final film dimensions but with a different cassette. Unlike the co-axial design of Super 8, the Single 8 cartridge featured one spool above the other.

===Sound===

Single 8&#x27;s film format being identical to Super 8 means that everything written above regarding projectors for Super 8 applies equally to Single 8.

Cameras also appeared for the Single 8 system that were capable of directly recording to pre-striped film which was presented in an oversize Single-8 cartridge which provided access for the camera&#x27;s sound recording head in a similar manner to Super 8. The only difference was that film manufacturers initially had to manufacture the film with a rebated area for the sound stripe. This was because the pressure plate ensuring good film registration was part of the camera and not the cartridge. The sound film had to be the same overall thickness as silent film which the camera could also accept. Although the rebated stock was more expensive to manufacture, a balance stripe on the opposite side of the film was rendered unnecessary and offset the cost. Fuji later developed a thinner film that did not require rebating, but the balance stripe was required because the thickness of the sound stripe was almost the same as the film base.

==Straight Eight==
A number of camera companies offered single-width 8 mm film in magazines or spools, but the format faded when Kodak introduced Kodachrome, as this was only available in the Double 8 mm format. The first single-run 8 mm film was offered in 1935 with a Bell &amp; Howell movie camera Filmo 127-A called Straight Eight. Single-width 8 mm film revived in the United States by Bolsey-8 in 1956 and continued for some time outside the United States, with Germany between 1937 and 1950s and Soviet Union KOMZ Ekran movie cameras and Svema offering reversal film in 1960s.
==UltraPan 8==
Introduced in 2011 by Nicholas Kovats and implemented by Jean-Louis Seguin, this format uses Standard 8 film in a modified Bolex (H16 or H8) camera. Similar to the Techniscope cameras of the 1960s, UltraPan 8 achieves wider aspect ratios generally reserved for camera systems with anamorphic lenses through manipulating film negative exposure instead of light capture. The area of film exposed per frame is 10.52 mm × 3.75 mm, having an aspect ratio of 2.8:1. There are effectively two UP8 frames for every one 16 mm frame. The design means there is no waste of film emulsion for the targeted aspect ratio. Earlier versions of this general idea date from the 1950s and exactly the same design occurs in implementations of the 1960s and 1970s. The current implementation of the idea gains impetus from the relative ease with which digital delivery systems can handle what would otherwise have required, in the past, either a dedicated mechanical projector or the transfer to another film format for which projectors were already available.

<doc id="46226" wikidata="Q572954" url="?curid=46226" title="Anthony Zinni">
<text>Anthony Charles Zinni (born September 17, 1943) is a retired United States Marine Corps general and a former Commander in Chief of the United States Central Command (CENTCOM). From 2001 to 2003, he served as a special envoy for the United States to Israel and the Palestinian Authority. From 2017 to 2019, he served as a special envoy to help resolve the Qatar diplomatic crisis.

While serving as a special envoy, Zinni was also an instructor in the Department of International Studies at the Virginia Military Institute. He later served as an instructor at the Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University, a public speaker, and an author of best-selling books on his military career and foreign affairs, including &quot;Battle for Peace&quot;. , he was involved in the corporate world, joining M.I.C. Industries as its president for International Operations in 2005.

Zinni also serves or has served on the advisory boards of a number of companies, including the security testing firm, Mu Dynamics, based in Sunnyvale, California. He joined Duke University&#x27;s Terry Sanford Institute of Public Policy in spring 2008 as the Sanford Distinguished Lecturer in Residence and taught a new course in the Hart Leadership Program. Zinni also serves on the board of directors for Caliburn International, a military contracting conglomerate that includes operations for Homestead Temporary Shelter for Unaccompanied Children.

He has been credited for foresight in predicting the dangers of terrorism coming out of Afghanistan before the September 11 attacks of 2001, and for supporting the Iraq War troop surge of 2007. In October 2009, he came out firmly in support of General Stanley A. McChrystal&#x27;s request for up to 40,000 additional troops in Afghanistan.

==Early life and education==
Zinni was born in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania and raised in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania, the son of Lilla (&quot;née&quot; Disabatino), a seamstress and homemaker, and Antonio Zinni, a chauffeur. His parents were of Italian descent. His father was drafted into the U.S. Army shortly after immigrating and served in World War I, being promoted to corporal and later receiving citizenship. Zinni&#x27;s brother served in the Korean War.

In 1965, Zinni graduated from Villanova University with a B.S. degree in economics and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps. He later earned an M.A. degree in management and supervision from Central Michigan University in 1984 and a second M.A. degree in international relations from Salve Regina College in 1987. Zinni graduated from the Marine Corps Command and Staff College in 1978 and the National War College in 1984. He attended the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School in 1967 and the Amphibious Warfare School in 1970. In 2023, Zinni was awarded an honorary degree from Salve Regina University.

==Career==

===U.S. Marine Corps===
After completion of the Basic School in 1965, Zinni was assigned to the 2nd Marine Division, where he served as a platoon commander, company executive officer, and company commander in the 1st Battalion, 6th Marines. He also served as a company commander in the 1st Infantry Training Regiment during this tour. In 1967, Zinni was assigned as an infantry battalion advisor to the Vietnamese Marine Corps. Following his service in the Vietnam War, he was ordered to the Basic School where he served as a tactics instructor, platoon commander, and company executive officer. In 1970, he returned to Vietnam as a company commander in 1st Battalion, 5th Marines where he was wounded, evacuated, and subsequently assigned to the 3rd Force Service Support Group on Okinawa. There he served as a company commander and guard officer. In 1971, Zinni returned to the 2nd Marine Division, where he served as a company commander in the 1st Battalion, 8th Marines, Aide de Camp to the Commanding General, and Officer in Charge of the Infantry Training Center. In 1974, he was assigned to Headquarters Marine Corps, where he was assigned as the Retention and Release Officer and Plans Officer in the Officer Assignment Branch of the Manpower Department.

Zinni again served in the 2nd Marine Division in 1978, as the Operations Officer of the 3rd Battalion, 2nd Marines, Executive Officer of the 1st Battalion, 8th Marines, Executive Officer of the 8th Marine Regiment and Commanding Officer of the 2nd Battalion, 8th Marines. In 1981, he was assigned as an operations and tactics instructor at the Marine Corps Command and Staff College at Quantico, Virginia. He was next assigned to the Operations Division at Headquarters, U.S. Marine Corps where he served as the Head of the Special Operations and Terrorism Counteraction Section and as the Head, Marine Air-Ground Task Force Concepts and Capabilities Branch. In 1984, he earned his master&#x27;s degree from Central Michigan University. In 1986, he was selected as a fellow on the Chief of Naval Operations Strategic Studies Group. From 1987 to 1989, Zinni served on Okinawa as the regimental commander of the 9th Marine Regiment and the Commanding Officer of the 35th Marine Expeditionary Unit, which was twice deployed to the Philippines to conduct emergency security operations and disaster relief operations. Upon his return to the U.S., he was assigned as the Chief of Staff of the Marine Air-Ground Training and Education Center at Marine Corps Base Quantico.

His initial general officer assignment was as the Deputy Director of Operations at the U.S. European Command. In 1991, he served as the Chief of Staff and Deputy Commanding General of Combined Task Force Operation Provide Comfort during the Kurdish relief effort in Turkey and Iraq. He also served as the Military Coordinator for Operation Provide Hope, the relief effort for the former Soviet Union. In 1992–93, he served as the Director for Operations for the Unified Task Force in Somalia for Operation Restore Hope. Also in 1993, he served as the Assistant to the U.S. Special Envoy to Somalia during Operation Continue Hope/UNOSOM II. Zinni was assigned as the Deputy Commanding General, U.S. Marine Corps Combat Development Command, Quantico, Virginia, from 1992 to 1994.

From 1994 to 1996, he served as the Commanding General, 1st Marine Expeditionary Force. During early 1995, Zinni served as Commander of the Combined Task Force for Operation United Shield, protecting the withdrawal of U.N. forces from Somalia.
From September 1996 until August 1997, Zinni served as the Deputy Commander in Chief, United States Central Command. His final tour was from August 1997 to September 2000 as the Commander in Chief, United States Central Command, MacDill Air Force Base, Florida. He organized Operation Desert Fox, a series of airstrikes against Iraq during December 1998, with the stated purpose of degrading Iraq&#x27;s weapons of mass destruction program. As CinCCENT, he and General Wesley Clark, CINCEUR, held a mini-summit between their commands to determine policies over Africa. Clark was reluctant to support Zinni&#x27;s activist attempts to engage more in Africa. Following his command of CENTCOM, he retired in autumn 2000.

===Testimony before Congress===
On March 15, 2000, Zinni testified before Congress:
Iraq remains the most significant near-term threat to U.S. interests in the Persian Gulf region. This is primarily due to its large conventional military force, the pursuit of WMD, oppressive treatment of Iraqi citizens, refusal to comply with United Nations Security Council resolutions (UNSCR), persistent threats to the enforcement of the no-fly zones (NFZ), and continued efforts to violate UN Security Council sanctions through oil smuggling.

While Iraq&#x27;s WMD capabilities were degraded under UN supervision and set back by Coalition strikes, some capabilities remain and others could quickly be regenerated. Despite claims that WMD efforts have ceased, Iraq probably is continuing clandestine nuclear research, retains stocks of chemical and biological munitions, and is concealing extended-range SCUD missiles, possibly equipped with CBW payloads. Even if Baghdad reversed its course and surrendered all WMD capabilities, it retains the scientific, technical, and industrial infrastructure to replace agents and munitions within weeks or months. A special concern is the absence of a UN inspection and monitoring presence, which until December 1998 had been paramount to preventing a large-scale resumption of prohibited weapons programs. A new disarmament regime must be reintroduced into Iraq as soon as possible and allowed to carry out the mandates dictated by the post-Gulf War UN resolutions.

Zinni also warned about terrorism:
Extremists like Osama bin Laden and his World Islamic Front network benefit from the global nature of communications that permits recruitment, fundraising, and direct connections to sub-elements worldwide ... Terrorists are seeking more lethal weaponry to include: chemical, biological, radiological, and even nuclear components with which to perpetrate more sensational attacks ... Three [Iraq, Iran, &amp; Sudan ] of the seven recognized state-sponsors of terrorism are within this potentially volatile area, and the Taliban regime in Afghanistan has been sanctioned by the UN Security Council for its harboring of Osama bin Laden. Nearly one-half of the 28 recognized terrorist organizations have operational sites within the region. Afghanistan has emerged as a catalyst for regional instability offering sanctuary, support, and training facilities to a growing number of extremist elements.

===Special envoy===
From 2001 to 2003, Zinni served as a special envoy for the U.S. to Israel and the Palestinian Authority.

In August 2017, he traveled to the Persian Gulf at the request of United States Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to help mediate the Qatar diplomatic crisis. Zinni resigned from his position as an envoy in January 2019, for he thought he could not resolve the dispute.

==CNA Military Advisory Board== 
Gen. Zinni served on the CNA Military Advisory Board,[8] the first group of retired generals and admirals to examine the national security implications of climate change. Founded in 2006 by Sherri Goodman, the CNA Military Advisory board brought together military leaders from the United States Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps. The landmark report of the CNA Military Advisory Board, National Security and the Threat of Climate Change, established the concept of climate change as a “threat multiplier.”
In the 2007 report, General Zinni referenced the inevitability of climate change and the need to take action now. General Zinni was one of the first leaders to appreciate the link between climate change, migration, terrorism, and instability. He wanted to “look at how climate change effects could drive populations to migrate. . . . What kinds of conflicts might result from their migration? You may also have a population that is traumatized by an event or change in condition triggered by climate change... It’s not hard to make the connection between climate change and instability and climate change and terrorism.” 

==Personal life==

Zinni&#x27;s son, Anthony Zinni, serves in the Marine Corps and was promoted to the rank of major effective September 1, 2010.

Zinni holds positions on several boards of directors of major U.S. corporations. In addition, he has held academic positions that include the Stanley Chair in Ethics at the Virginia Military Institute, the Nimitz Chair at the University of California, Berkeley, the Hofheimer Chair at the Joint Forces Staff College, and the Harriman Professorship of Government and membership on the board of the Reves Center for International Studies at the College of William and Mary. He has worked as Chairman of the Board of the Middle East Institute, with the University of California&#x27;s Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation and the Henry Dunant Centre for humanitarian dialogue in Geneva. He is also a Distinguished Advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. He was the Executive Vice President for Dyncorp International from July 18, 2007, to the end of 2008. He served on the Board of Directors of DynCorp International prior to that position.

He serves or has served on the board of trustees of the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, which is a museum dedicated to the U.S. Constitution.

, he serves as chairman of the board of governors of the Middle East Institute. He has been named honorary chairman of that institution. Zinni also serves as an honorary board member of the non-profit Wine Country Marines – a 501(c)3 dedicated to helping wounded service members, and aiding the welfare of currently serving service members, as well as addressing veterans employment and transition and healthcare.

In April 2004, Zinni gave a lecture entitled &quot;From the Battlefield to the Negotiating Table: Preventing Deadly Conflict&quot; at the University of San Diego&#x27;s Joan B. Kroc Institute for Peace &amp; Justice Distinguished Lecture Series.

In 2004, Zinni was named in an investigative report by Diana B. Henriques of &quot;The New York Times&quot; as being among the &quot;retired or former military people&quot; recruited to the corporate boards and sales forces of investment firms engaged in deceptive marketing of financial instruments aimed at military veterans in order to lend them credibility. The investment firm that had recruited Zinni, First Command Financial Planning, Inc., responded in written comments to a subsequent United States House of Representatives investigation that &quot;It would be unfortunate if anyone inferred that these honorable individuals would take any action or support any organization that did not act in the best interests of service members.&quot; The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) subsequently concluded that First Command &quot;willfully violated the Securities Act of 1933 Section 17(a)(2) dealing with inter-state fraud.&quot; In particular, the SEC concluded that First Command had sold mutual fund investments to veterans termed &quot;systematic plans&quot; which had very high sales charges termed &quot;front-end sales loads&quot;, &quot;by, in part, making misleading statements and omissions concerning, among other things: (a) comparisons between the systematic plan and other mutual fund investments; (b) the availability of the Thrift Savings Plan (&quot;TSP&quot;), which offers military investors many of the features of a systematic plan at lower costs; and (c) the efficacy of the front-end sales load in ensuring that investors remain committed to the systematic plan.&quot; In December 2004, First Command entered into a $12 million settlement with the SEC and NASD without admitting guilt.

In 2006, Zinni argued that more troops were needed in Iraq in the context of preventing the then-budding civil war.

In 2007, he worked on a report entitled &quot;National Security and the Threat of Climate Change&quot; with 11 other retired military commanders. The report stated that global warming would act as a threat multiplier to global conflict.

General Zinni is also a &quot;Distinguished Military Fellow&quot; for the Center for Defense Information, a part of the World Security Institute.

In 2009, Zinni reported that he had been offered and accepted the post of United States Ambassador to Iraq for the Barack Obama administration, but that the appointment had been subsequently withdrawn without explanation. The administration&#x27;s final choice for the ambassadorship was Christopher R. Hill.

On June 26, 2009, General Anthony (Tony) Zinni (USMC ret.), then a member of the BAE Systems, Inc. Board, has been appointed Chairman of the BAE Systems, Inc. Board and, pending appointment of a permanent successor to Walt Havenstein, Acting President and CEO of BAE Systems, Inc. Tony will also join the BAE Systems Executive Committee in his capacity as Acting President and CEO of BAE Systems, Inc.

General Zinni also serves or has served on the board of Kaseman which has teamed up with Blackwater to pursue security work for the State Department.

Since 2011, Anthony Zinni is a member of the board of the Peace Research Endowment.

===Political involvement===
Efforts to get him to run for the U.S. Senate have gone nowhere. Zinni has said he would never run for office. He says his decision to endorse President George W. Bush in 2000 was a mistake, and in 2003, indicated that he plans to avoid politics in the future. However, on March 3, 2006, Zinni joined fellow former United States Marines General Joseph P. Hoar, Lt. General Greg Newbold, Lt. General Frank Petersen, and Congressman Jack Murtha in endorsing fellow former U.S. Marine and Secretary of the Navy Jim Webb for U.S. Senate in Virginia. Zinni had been floated as a possible vice presidential running mate of Barack Obama, in 2008.

<text>Focus on the Family (FOTF or FotF) is a fundamentalist Protestant organization founded in 1977 in Southern California by James Dobson, based in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The group is one of a number of evangelical parachurch organizations that rose to prominence in the 1980s. As of the 2017 tax filing year, Focus on the Family declared itself to be a church, &quot;primarily to protect the confidentiality of our donors.&quot; Traditionally, entities considered churches have been ones that have regular worship services and congregants.

It most prominently lobbies against LGBT rights — including those related to marriage, adoption, and parenting — labeling it a &quot;particularly evil lie of Satan&quot;. The organization also seeks to change public policy in the areas of sex education, creationism, abortion, state-sponsored school prayer, gambling, drugs, and enforcement of their interpretation of proper gender roles.

The core promotional activities of the organization include the flagship daily radio broadcast currently hosted by its president Jim Daly together with co-host Focus VP John Fuller. Focus also provides free resources in line with the group&#x27;s views, and publishes books, magazines, videos, and audio recordings.

The organization also produces programs for targeted audiences, such as &quot;Adventures in Odyssey&quot; and &quot;Ribbits!&quot; for children, and dramas for other audiences.

==History ==

=== Origins and Dobson era ===
From 1977 to 2003, James Dobson served as the sole leader of the organization, which was originally based in Arcadia, California. Dobson and his organization generated significant controversy by taking a different approach to ministry than many other evangelical parachurch organizations, opting to combine its parenting programs with conservative political activism. By 1993, Focus on the Family was receiving approximately 10,000 personal letters and 3,000 phone calls per day by individuals seeking personal assistance from the organization. The organization, and especially James Dobson, wielded significant national influence within the U.S., and particularly among politically conservative Christians and women working within the home. During the 1990s Dobson and Focus on the Family were accused by an early member of the organization of moving away from their original mission of helping families and instead becoming &quot;too political&quot;. The organization&#x27;s cornerstone items included their radio broadcasts as well as other ventures such as their film publishing arm &quot;Focus on the Family Films&quot;.

In 2003, Donald P. Hodel became president and chief executive officer, tasked with the day-to-day operations. Dobson remained chairman of the board of directors, with chiefly creative and speaking duties. In March 2005, Hodel retired and Jim Daly, formerly the vice president in charge of Focus on the Family&#x27;s International Division, assumed the role of president and chief executive officer.

By 2007, the executive leadership of the organization reportedly worked to sustain the group&#x27;s cultural influence by investing more heavily into family programs targeted at younger generations as opposed to only bolstering its political programs favored by James Dobson. As a result of targeting a younger demographic more frequently in digital spaces, the organization reported a decrease in donations, dropping from 755,000 donors in 2004 to 564,000 donors by September 2007.

In the first decade the 2000s, Focus lead abstinence programs both domestically in the U.S. and worldwide. The program, often titled &quot;No Apologies&quot;, had some success in Muslim-majority countries such as Egypt and Malaysia where the teachings of abstinence aligned with messages of Islam. The program was brought to China with the permission of the Chinese Communist Party, who desired to bring down birth rates at the time.

In November 2008, the organization eliminated 202 jobs, representing 18 percent of its workforce. The organization also cut its budget from $160 million in fiscal 2008 to $138 million for fiscal 2009.

In February 2009, Dobson resigned his chairmanship. He left Focus on the Family in early 2010, and subsequently founded Family Talk as a non-profit organization and launched a new broadcast that began airing nationally on May 3, 2010. He is no longer affiliated with Focus on the Family.

In a break from the previous status quo, president Jim Daly purportedly tried to steer the organization away from the same level of political activism that the organization was known for in its initial decades of existence. Daly made connections with figures and organizations that founder Dobson disdained and cut off, such as Democratic United States President Barack Obama, liberal activist Ted Trimpa, and the newspaper The Independent.

On June 23, 2017, Vice President Mike Pence attended the organization&#x27;s 40th anniversary celebration; at the event, he praised founder James Dobson, stated that then-President Donald Trump was an ally of the organization, and added that the Trump administration supported Focus on the Family&#x27;s goals (including the abolition of Planned Parenthood). Pence&#x27;s attendance at the event, along with Focus on the Family&#x27;s stances on LGBT rights, was criticized by the Human Rights Campaign.

In its IRS Form 990 for Tax Year 2015, dated October 26, 2017, Focus on the Family for the first time declared itself a &quot;church, convention of churches or association of churches&quot;, claiming that it was no longer required to file the IRS disclosure form and that the sources and disposition of its $89 million budget were &quot;Not for public inspection&quot;. Tax attorney Gail Harmon, who advises nonprofit organizations on tax law, said she found the declaration &quot;shocking&quot;, noting that &quot;There&#x27;s nothing about them that meets the traditional definition of what a church is. They don&#x27;t have a congregation, they don&#x27;t have the rites of various parts of a person&#x27;s life.&quot; A spokesperson for the organization stated that it changed its status &quot;primarily to protect the confidentiality of our donors&quot;. By 2023, the organization had offices in 14 countries and partnerships in 60 countries, for an international presence in 98 countries.

==Programs==

===Wait No More===
Focus on the Family&#x27;s Wait No More ministry works with adoption agencies, church leaders and ministry partners to recruit families to adopt children from foster care. In Colorado, the number of children waiting for adoption dropped from approximately 800 to 350 persons, due in part to the efforts of Wait No More. Focus on the Family&#x27;s efforts to encourage adoption among Christian families is part of a larger effort by Evangelicals to, in their perception, live out what they see as the &quot;biblical mandate&quot; to help children.

===Option Ultrasound Program===
Focus on the Family&#x27;s Option Ultrasound Program (OUP) provides grants to crisis pregnancy centers to pay the cost of ultrasound machines or sonography training. Focus on the Family began OUP in 2004 with the goal of convincing women not to have abortions. FOTF officials said that ultrasound services help a woman better understand her pregnancy and baby&#x27;s development, creating an important &quot;bonding opportunity&quot; between &quot;mother and unborn child&quot;.

In 2011, FOTF announced that they would like to talk with pro-choice groups like Planned Parenthood to work towards the shared goal of making abortion less common. Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) introduced a sonogram bill in 2011 and, citing Focus on the Family, told Congress that &quot;78 percent of women who see and hear the fetal heartbeat choose life.&quot; She was later corrected by Focus on the Family, which released a statement saying they did not release such data. A study released in February 2012 showed that ultrasounds do not have a direct impact on an abortion decision.

===Boundless.org===
Boundless.org is Focus on the Family&#x27;s website for young adults ages 18–34 featuring articles, a blog, a podcast, and a conference. The site has been classified as a webzine, and originally included a moderated forum for young adults to exchange thoughts and ideas about topics relevant to them without being dictated what they should believe by an &quot;authoritarian tone&quot;. The website covers topics such as singleness, dating, relationships, popular culture, career, and sex.

===Plugged In===
Plugged In is a Focus on the Family publication and associated website created for families that reviews magazines, newspaper comics, films, books, music, and TV and radio shows. As of 2007 it was one of their most popular products, and reviews were offered to members through both their website and through text messages.

===Day of Dialogue===
The Day of Dialogue was a student event which took place April 16. Since 2018 the event is no longer marked on a single date, or organized nationally. Founders described the goal of the event, created in opposition to the anti-bullying and anti-homophobic Day of Silence, as &quot;encouraging honest and respectful conversation among students about God&#x27;s design for sexuality.&quot; It was previously known as the &quot;Day of Truth&quot; and was founded by the Alliance Defense Fund in 2005. In 2007, Exodus International began supporting the Day of Truth, an event created by Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) in 2005 that challenges homosexuality. In 2009, the ADF announced they had passed on their leadership role for the event to Exodus. In October 2010, Exodus announced they would no longer support the event. President Alan Chambers stated they realised they needed to &quot;equip kids to live out biblical tolerance and grace while treating their neighbors as they&#x27;d like to be treated, whether they agree with them or not&quot;, adding that the Day of Truth was becoming too divisive. Chambers said that Exodus had not changed its position on homosexuality, rather they were reevaluating how to best communicate their message. Focus on the Family subsequently took leadership of the event, and renamed it the Day of Dialogue.

===National Day of Prayer===

The National Day of Prayer Task Force is an American evangelical conservative Christian non-profit organization which organizes, coordinates, and presides over Evangelical Christian religious observances each year on the National Day of Prayer. The website of the NDP Task Force states that &quot;its business affairs are separate&quot; from those of Focus on the Family, but also that &quot;between 1990 and 1993, Focus on the Family did provide grants in support of the NDP Task Force&quot; and that &quot;Focus on the Family is compensated for services rendered.&quot; Shirley Dobson, wife of James Dobson, was chairwoman of the NDP Task Force from 1991 until 2016, when Anne Graham Lotz, daughter of evangelist Billy Graham, assumed the post.

===Radio Theatre===
Radio Theatre is a program run by Focus on the Family that makes both original and adapted radio dramas. Much of the staff involved with Adventures in Odyssey is also involved with Radio Theatre such as Paul McCusker.
They have made adaptations of many novels including &quot;Les Miserables&quot; and &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; as well as an adaptation of the complete Chronicles of Narnia. Radio Theatre often hires famous actors to be a part of their adaptations such as Andy Serkis.

==Former ministries==

=== Family Life Seminars ===
One of Focus on the Family&#x27;s earliest ministries, Family Life Seminars were speaking events hosted by James Dobson in the 1970s. To reduce the time that the events were taking Dobson away from his own family, the seminars were eventually recorded and released as a seven-part film series. The film series then in turn inspired a television program based on the films.

===Love Won Out===

Focus on the Family formed Love Won Out, an ex-gay ministry in 1998. In 2009, it was sold to Exodus International.

==Political positions and activities==
Focus on the Family&#x27;s 501(c)(3) status prevents them from advocating any individual political candidate, though it has permitted them to spend up to a certain amount on other political activities such as lobbying and voter education. Focus on the Family has an affiliated group, Family Policy Alliance, though the two groups are legally separate. As a 501(c)(4) social welfare group, Family Policy Alliance has fewer political lobbying restrictions. FOTF&#x27;s revenue in 2012 was US$90.5 million, and that of Family Policy Alliance (formerly CitizenLink) was US$8 million. By 2023, Family Policy Alliance and its network of local state councils were generating over $40 million of revenue.

Focus on the Family, through its partnership with Family Policy Alliance, strongly advocates for legislation against transgender rights, including crafted policies which oppose the consensus of medical experts who work with the transgender community.

Focus on the Family maintains a strong stand against abortion, and provides grant funding and medical training to assist crisis pregnancy centers (CPCs; also known as pregnancy resource centers) in obtaining ultrasound machines. According to the organization, this funding, which has allowed CPCs to provide pregnant women with live sonogram images of the developing fetus, has led directly to the birth of over 1500 babies who would have otherwise been aborted. The organization has been staunchly opposed to public funding for elective abortions.

Focus on the Family has been a prominent supporter of the pseudoscience of intelligent design, publishing pro-intelligent design articles in its &quot;Citizen&quot; magazine and selling intelligent design videos on its website. Focus on the Family co-published the intelligent design videotape &quot;Unlocking the Mystery of Life&quot; with the Discovery Institute, hub of the intelligent design movement.

In New Zealand, Focus on the Family supported a Citizens Initiated Referendum on the repeal of section 59 of the Crimes Act 1961, which placed limits on the physical disciplining of children.

Focus on the Family Singapore came under criticism in October 2014 over allegations of sexism and promoting gender stereotypes during their workshops on managing relationships for junior college students. The workshop received a complaint from both a Hwa Chong Junior College student, as well as negative feedback from the college management as being &#x27;ineffective&#x27; and stopped before the end of the year.

Following the 2022 U.S. Supreme Court decision to overturn &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, Focus on the Family published an article on its &quot;Daily Citizen&quot; site urging conservative Christians to engage in a &quot;cultural civil war&quot; against &quot;radical abortion laws&quot; implemented in left-leaning states. This added to speculation that political violence similar to the January 6th attacks could be accepted or encouraged on the grounds of opposing abortion rights.

===2008 presidential campaign===
In the 2008 United States presidential election, Focus on the Family shifted from supporting Mike Huckabee, to not supporting any candidate, to accepting the Republican ticket once Sarah Palin was added. Prior to the election, a television and letter campaign was launched predicting terrorist attacks in four U.S. cities and equating the U.S. with Nazi Germany. This publicity was condemned by the Anti-Defamation League. Within a month before the general election, Focus on the Family began distributing a 16-page letter titled &quot;Letter from 2012 in Obama&#x27;s America&quot;, which describes an imagined American future in which &quot;many of our freedoms have been taken away by a liberal Supreme Court of the United States and a majority of Democrats in both the House of Representatives and the Senate.&quot; According to &quot;USA Today&quot;, the letter &quot;is part of an escalation in rhetoric from Christian right activists&quot; trying to paint Democratic Party presidential nominee Senator Barack Obama in a negative light.

Focus on the Family Action supported Senator Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) in his successful December 2, 2008, runoff election win. The organization, according to the &quot;Colorado Independent&quot;, donated $35,310 in radio ads to the Chambliss runoff campaign effort. As the &quot;Independent&quot; reports, the Focus-sponsored ads were aired in about a dozen Georgia markets. The commercials were produced in the weeks after Focus laid off 202 employees, some 20 percent of its workforce, because of the national economic crisis.

===Opposition to LGBTQ rights===

One of Focus on the Family&#x27;s notable political stances is its strong opposition to same-sex marriage, civil unions, and domestic partnerships.

The organization has referred to the LGBT rights movement as a &quot;particularly evil lie of Satan&quot;.

Focus on the Family founder James Dobson drew criticism for using the group to oppose homosexual members in the United States Military. Similarly, Dobson and the organization supported a 1992 amendment to the Colorado constitution which stopped laws that allowed for protections from LGBTQ discrimination.

Dobson spoke at the 2004 rally against gay marriage called Mayday for Marriage. The event marked the first time that Dobson publicly endorsed a presidential candidate, George W. Bush. During the event he denounced the Supreme Court rulings in favor of gay rights, and he urged rally participants to vote so that the battle against gay rights could be won in the Senate.

In an interview with &quot;Christianity Today&quot;, Dobson also explained that he was not in favor of civil unions. He stated that generally agreed civil unions were merely same-sex marriage under a different name. He claimed his main priority in opposing the same-sex marriage movement was first and foremost to define marriage on the federal level as being exclusive between a man and a woman, and that afterward he wished to combat the passage of civil unions on a state-by-state basis.

Civil rights advocacy groups identify Focus on the Family as a major opponent of gay rights. The Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights and hate group monitoring organization, described Focus on the Family as one of a &quot;dozen major groups [which] help drive the religious right&#x27;s anti-gay crusade&quot;. The SPLC does not list Focus on the Family as a hate group, however, since it opposes homosexuality &quot;on strictly Biblical grounds&quot;.

Focus on the Family was a member of ProtectMarriage.com, a coalition formed to sponsor California Proposition 8, a ballot initiative to restrict marriage to opposite-sex couples, which passed in 2008, but was subsequently struck down as being unconstitutional by a federal court in &quot;Perry v. Schwarzenegger&quot;.

===Misrepresentation of research===
Social scientists have criticized Focus on the Family for misrepresenting their research in order to bolster its own perspective. Researcher Judith Stacey, whose work was used by Focus on the Family to claim that gays and lesbians do not make good parents, said that the claim was &quot;a direct misrepresentation of the research&quot;. She elaborated, &quot;Whenever you hear Focus on the Family, legislators or lawyers say, &#x27;Studies prove that children do better in families with a mother and a father,&#x27; they are referring to studies which compare two-parent heterosexual households to single-parent households. The studies they are talking about do not cite research on families headed by gay and lesbian couples.&quot; FOTF claimed that Stacey&#x27;s allegation was without merit and that their position is that the best interests of children are served when there is a father and a mother. &quot;We haven&#x27;t said anything about sexual orientation&quot;, said Glenn Stanton.

James Dobson cited the research of Kyle Pruett and Carol Gilligan in a &quot;Time&quot; magazine guest article in the service of a claim that two women cannot raise a child; upon finding out that her work had been used in this way, Gilligan wrote a letter to Dobson asking him to apologize and to cease and desist from citing her work, describing herself as &quot;mortified to learn that you had distorted my work ... Not only did you take my research out of context, you did so without my knowledge to support discriminatory goals that I do not agree with ... there is nothing in my research that would lead you to draw the stated conclusions you did in the &quot;Time&quot; article.&quot; Pruett wrote a similar letter, in which he said that Dobson &quot;cherry-picked a phrase to shore up highly (in my view) discriminatory purposes. This practice is condemned in real science, common though it may be in pseudo-science circles. There is nothing in my longitudinal research or any of my writings to support such conclusions&quot;, and asked that FOTF not cite him again without permission.

After Elizabeth Saewyc&#x27;s research on teen suicide was used by Focus on the Family to promote conversion therapy she said that &quot;the research has been hijacked for somebody&#x27;s political purposes or ideological purposes and that&#x27;s worrisome&quot;, and that research in fact linked the suicide rate among LGBT teens to harassment, discrimination, and closeting. Other scientists who have criticized Focus on the Family for misrepresenting their findings include Robert Spitzer, Gary Remafedi, and Angela Phillips.

===Football advertisements===
In 2010, Focus on the Family bought ad time during Super Bowl XLIV to air a commercial featuring Heisman Trophy winning Florida Gators quarterback Tim Tebow and his mother, Pam. In the ad, Pam described Tim as a &quot;miracle baby&quot; who &quot;almost didn&#x27;t make it into this world&quot;, and further elaborated that &quot;with all our family&#x27;s been through, we have to be tough&quot; (after which Pam was promptly tackled by Tim). The ad directed viewers to the organization&#x27;s website.

Women&#x27;s rights groups asked CBS not to air the then-unseen ad, arguing that it was divisive. Planned Parenthood released a video response of its own featuring fellow NFL player Sean James. The claim that Tebow&#x27;s family chose not to perform an abortion was also widely criticized; critics felt that the claim was implausible because it would be unlikely for doctors to recommend the procedure because abortion is illegal in the Philippines, where Tebow was born. CBS&#x27;s decision to run the ad was also criticized for deviating from its past policy to reject advocacy-type ads during the Super Bowl, including ads by left-leaning groups such as PETA, MoveOn.org and the United Church of Christ (which wanted to run an ad that was pro-same-sex marriage). However, CBS stated that &quot;we have for some time moderated our approach to advocacy submissions after it became apparent that our stance did not reflect public sentiment or industry norms on the issue.&quot;

Focus on the Family produced another commercial which ran during the second quarter of the January 14, 2012 Denver Broncos-New England Patriots AFC Divisional Playoff broadcast on CBS, featuring children reciting the Bible verse John 3:16. The ad did not generate nearly the amount of controversy that surrounded the Super Bowl commercial. It did gain some national media attention, and president Jim Daly stated in a press release that its purpose was to &quot;help everyone understand some numbers are more important than the ones on the scoreboard.&quot;

==Recognition and awards==
In 2008, Dobson&#x27;s &quot;Focus on the Family&quot; program was nominated for induction into the National Radio Hall of Fame. Nominations were made by the 157 members of the Hall of Fame and voting on inductees was handed over to the public using online voting. The nomination drew the ire of gay rights activists, who launched efforts to have the program removed from the nominee list and to vote for other nominees to prevent &quot;Focus&quot; from winning. However, on July 18, 2008, it was announced that the program had won and would be inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame in a ceremony on November 8, 2008. Truth Wins Out, a gay rights group, protested against the ceremony with over 300 protesters.

==Headquarters and size==

The Focus on the Family headquarters is a four building, complex located off of Interstate 25 in northern Colorado Springs, Colorado, with its own ZIP Code (80995). The buildings consist of the Administration building, International building, Welcome Center and Operations building, and totals 526,070 square feet.

Focus on the Family&#x27;s original headquarters were in Arcadia, California for the initial fourteen years following the time that James Dobson incorporated the company. The organization began with 500 square feet of office space and employed a single part-time secretary, according to the prior director of corporate affairs, Dan Wright. By 1984 Focus of the Family&#x27;s Arcadia properties occupied 55,000 square feet across three buildings (though prior to a consolidation of their campus, they owned as many as seven individual buildings around the city) and employed 320 personnel. In 1991 Focus moved their headquarters to their current location in Colorado Springs with 1,200 employees. In 2002, the number of employees peaked at 1,400. By September 2011, after years of layoffs, they had 650 employees remaining. Christopher Ott of &quot;Salon&quot; said in 1998 that the FOTF campus has &quot;handsome new brick buildings, professional landscaping and even its own traffic signs&quot; and that &quot;The buildings and grounds are well-maintained and comfortable. If there is any ostentatious or corrupt influence here, it is nowhere in sight.&quot;

<text>Henry Jaynes Fonda (May 16, 1905 – August 12, 1982) was an American actor whose career spanned five decades on Broadway and in Hollywood. On screen and stage, he often portrayed characters who embodied an everyman image.

Born and raised in Nebraska, Fonda made his mark early as a Broadway actor and made his Hollywood film debut in 1935. He rose to film stardom with performances in films like &quot;Jezebel&quot; (1938), &quot;Jesse James&quot; (1939) and &quot;Young Mr. Lincoln&quot; (1939). He received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role as Tom Joad in &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; (1940).

In 1941, Fonda starred opposite Barbara Stanwyck in the screwball comedy classic &quot;The Lady Eve&quot;. After his service in World War II, he starred in two highly regarded Westerns: &quot;The Ox-Bow Incident&quot; (1943) and &quot;My Darling Clementine&quot; (1946), the latter directed by John Ford. He also starred in Ford&#x27;s Western &quot;Fort Apache&quot; (1948). During a seven-year break from films, Fonda focused on stage productions, returning to star in the war-boat ensemble movie &quot;Mister Roberts&quot; in 1955, a role he championed on Broadway. In 1956, at the age of 51, Fonda played the title role of 38-year-old Manny Balestrero in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s thriller &quot;The Wrong Man&quot;. In 1957, Fonda starred as Juror 8, the hold-out juror, in &quot;12 Angry Men&quot;, a film he co-produced and that earned him a BAFTA award for Best Foreign Actor.

Later in his career, Fonda played a range of characters, including a villain in the epic &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot; (1968) and the lead in the romantic comedy &quot;Yours, Mine and Ours&quot; with Lucille Ball. He also portrayed military figures, such as a colonel in &quot;Battle of the Bulge&quot; (1965) and Admiral Nimitz in &quot;Midway&quot; (1976).

Fonda won the Academy Award for Best Actor at the 54th Academy Awards for his final film role in &quot;On Golden Pond&quot; (1981), which co-starred Katharine Hepburn and his daughter Jane Fonda. He was too ill to attend the ceremony and died from heart disease five months later.

Fonda was the patriarch of a family of actors, including daughter Jane Fonda, son Peter Fonda, granddaughter Bridget Fonda and grandson Troy Garity. In 1999, he was named the sixth-Greatest Male Screen Legend of the Classic Hollywood Era (stars with a film debut by 1950) by the American Film Institute.

==Ancestry and early life==

Born in Grand Island, Nebraska, on May 16, 1905, Henry Jaynes Fonda was the son of printer William Brace Fonda, and his wife, Herberta (Jaynes). The family moved to Omaha, Nebraska, in 1906.

Fonda&#x27;s patriline originates with an ancestor from Genoa, Italy, who migrated to the Netherlands in the 15th century. In 1642, a branch of the Fonda family immigrated to the Dutch colony of New Netherland on the East Coast of North America. They were among the first Dutch population to settle in what is now upstate New York, establishing the town of Fonda, New York. By 1888, many of their descendants had relocated to Nebraska.

Fonda was brought up as a Christian Scientist. The family was close and highly supportive, especially in health matters, as they avoided doctors due to their religion. Despite having a religious background, he later became an agnostic. Fonda was a bashful, short boy who tended to avoid girls, except his sisters, and was a good skater, swimmer, and runner. He worked part-time in his father&#x27;s print plant and imagined a possible career as a journalist. Later, he worked after school for the phone company. He also enjoyed drawing. Fonda was active in the Boy Scouts of America; Howard Teichmann reports that he reached the rank of Eagle Scout. However, this is not supported elsewhere. When he was 14, he and his father witnessed the brutal lynching of Will Brown from a nearby building during the Omaha race riot of 1919. This enraged the young Fonda and he kept a keen awareness of prejudice for the rest of his life. Remarking on the incident in a 1975 BBC interview, he said: &quot;It was the most horrendous sight I&#x27;d ever seen. My hands were wet, there were tears in my eyes. All I could think of was that young black man dangling at the end of a rope.&quot; By his senior year in high school, Fonda had grown to more than tall, but remained shy. He attended the University of Minnesota, where he majored in journalism, but did not graduate. While at Minnesota he was a member of Chi Delta Xi, a local fraternity, which later became Chi Phi&#x27;s Gamma Delta chapter on that campus. He took a job with the Retail Credit Company.

==Career==

===Early stage work===

At age 20, Fonda started his acting career at the Omaha Community Playhouse when his mother&#x27;s friend Dodie Brando (mother of Marlon Brando) recommended that he try out for a juvenile part in &quot;You and I&quot;, in which he was cast as Ricky. He was fascinated by the stage, learning everything from set construction to stage production, and embarrassed by his acting ability. When he received the lead in &quot;Merton of the Movies&quot;, he realized the beauty of acting as a profession, as it allowed him to deflect attention from his own tongue-tied personality and create stage characters relying on someone else&#x27;s scripted words. Fonda decided to quit his job and go east in 1928 to seek his fortune.

He arrived on Cape Cod and played a minor role at the Cape Playhouse in Dennis, Massachusetts. A friend took him to Falmouth, MA where he joined and quickly became a valued member of the University Players, an intercollegiate summer stock company. There, he worked with Margaret Sullavan, his future wife. James Stewart joined the Players a few months after Fonda left, though they were soon to become lifelong friends. Fonda left the Players at the end of their 1931–1932 season after appearing in his first professional role in &quot;The Jest&quot;, by Sem Benelli. Joshua Logan, a young sophomore at Princeton who had been double-cast in the show, gave Fonda the part of Tornaquinci, &quot;an elderly Italian man with a long white beard and even longer hair.&quot; Also in the cast of &quot;The Jest&quot; with Fonda and Logan were Bretaigne Windust, Kent Smith, and Eleanor Phelps.

Soon after, Fonda headed for New York City to be with his then wife, Margaret Sullavan. The marriage was brief, but when James Stewart came to New York his luck changed. Getting contact information from Joshua Logan, &quot;Jimmy&quot; and &quot;Hank&quot; found they had a lot in common, as long as they didn&#x27;t discuss politics. The two men became roommates and honed their skills on Broadway. Fonda appeared in theatrical productions from 1926 to 1934. They fared no better than many Americans in and out of work during the early part of the Great Depression, sometimes lacking enough money to take the subway.

===Entering Hollywood===
Fonda got his first break in films when he was hired in 1935 as Janet Gaynor&#x27;s leading man in 20th Century Fox&#x27;s screen adaptation of &quot;The Farmer Takes a Wife&quot;; he reprised his role from the Broadway production of the same name, which had gained him recognition. Suddenly, Fonda was making $3,000 a week () and dining with Hollywood stars such as Carole Lombard. Stewart soon followed him to Hollywood, and they roomed together again, in lodgings next door to Greta Garbo. In 1935 Fonda starred in the RKO film &quot;I Dream Too Much&quot; with the opera star Lily Pons. &quot;The New York Times&quot; announced him as &quot;Henry Fonda, the most likable of the new crop of romantic juveniles.&quot;
Fonda&#x27;s film career blossomed as he costarred with Sylvia Sidney and Fred MacMurray in &quot;The Trail of the Lonesome Pine&quot; (1936), the first Technicolor movie filmed outdoors.

Fonda starred with ex-wife Margaret Sullavan in &quot;The Moon&#x27;s Our Home&quot;, and a short rekindling of their relationship led to a brief but temporary consideration of remarriage. Fonda got the nod for the lead role in &quot;You Only Live Once&quot; (1937), also costarring Sidney, and directed by Fritz Lang. He starred opposite Bette Davis, who had chosen him, in the film &quot;Jezebel&quot; (1938). This was followed by the title role in &quot;Young Mr. Lincoln&quot; (1939), his first collaboration with director John Ford, and that year he played Frank James in &quot;Jesse James&quot; (1939) starring Tyrone Power and Nancy Kelly. Another 1939 film was &quot;Drums Along the Mohawk&quot;, also directed by Ford.
Fonda&#x27;s successes led Ford to recruit him to play Tom Joad in the film version of John Steinbeck&#x27;s novel &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; (1940). A reluctant Darryl Zanuck, who preferred Tyrone Power, insisted on Fonda&#x27;s signing a seven-year contract with his studio, Twentieth Century-Fox. Fonda agreed and was ultimately nominated for an Academy Award for his work in the film, which many consider to be his finest role. Fonda starred in Fritz Lang&#x27;s &quot;The Return of Frank James&quot; (1940) with Gene Tierney. He then played opposite Barbara Stanwyck in Preston Sturges&#x27;s &quot;The Lady Eve&quot; (1941), and again teamed with Tierney in the successful screwball comedy &quot;Rings on Her Fingers&quot; (1942). Stanwyck was one of Fonda&#x27;s favorite co-stars, and they appeared in three films together. He was acclaimed for his role in &quot;The Ox-Bow Incident&quot; (1943).
Fonda enlisted in the United States Navy to fight in World War II, saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to be in a fake war in a studio.&quot; Previously, Jimmy Stewart and Fonda had helped raise funds for the defense of Britain. Fonda served for three years, initially as a quartermaster 3rd class on the destroyer . He was later commissioned as a lieutenant junior grade in Air Combat Intelligence in the Central Pacific and was awarded the Bronze Star Medal and Navy Presidential Unit Citation. After being discharged from active duty due to being &quot;overage in rank&quot;, Fonda was transferred to the Naval Reserve, serving three years (1945-1948).

===Postwar career===

After the war, Fonda took a break from movies and attended Hollywood parties and enjoyed civilian life. Stewart and Fonda would listen to records and invite Johnny Mercer, Hoagy Carmichael, Dinah Shore, and Nat King Cole over for music, with the latter giving the family piano lessons. Fonda played Wyatt Earp in &quot;My Darling Clementine&quot; (1946), which was directed by John Ford. Fonda did seven postwar films until his contract with Fox expired, the last being Otto Preminger&#x27;s &quot;Daisy Kenyon&quot; (1947), opposite Joan Crawford. He starred in &quot;The Fugitive&quot; (1947), which was the first film of Ford&#x27;s new production company, Argosy Pictures. In 1948 he appeared in a subsequent Argosy/Ford production, &quot;Fort Apache&quot;, as a rigid Army colonel, along with John Wayne and Shirley Temple in her first adult role.

Refusing another long-term studio contract, Fonda returned to Broadway, wearing his own officer&#x27;s cap to originate the title role in &quot;Mister Roberts&quot;, a comedy about the U.S. Navy, during World War II in the South Pacific Ocean where Fonda, a junior officer, Lt. Douglas A. Roberts wages a private war against a tyrannical captain. He won a 1948 Tony Award for the part. Fonda followed that by reprising his performance in the national tour and with successful stage runs in &quot;Point of No Return&quot; and &quot;The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial&quot;. After an eight-year absence from films, he starred in the same role in the 1955 film version of &quot;Mister Roberts&quot; with James Cagney, William Powell, and Jack Lemmon, continuing a pattern of bringing his acclaimed stage roles to life on the big screen. On the set of &quot;Mister Roberts&quot;, Fonda came to blows with director John Ford, who punched him during filming, and Fonda vowed never to work for the director again. While he kept that vow for years, Fonda spoke glowingly of Ford in Peter Bogdanovich&#x27;s documentary &quot;Directed by John Ford&quot; and in a documentary on Ford&#x27;s career alongside Ford and James Stewart. Fonda refused to participate until he learned that Ford had insisted on casting Fonda as the lead in the film version of &quot;Mr. Roberts&quot;, reviving Fonda&#x27;s film career after concentrating on the stage for years.

After &quot;Mr. Roberts&quot;, Fonda was next in Paramount Pictures&#x27;s production of Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s epic novel &quot;War and Peace&quot; (1956) about French Emperor Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Russia in 1812, in which he played Pierre Bezukhov opposite Audrey Hepburn; it took two years to shoot. Fonda worked with Alfred Hitchcock in 1956, playing a man falsely accused of robbery in &quot;The Wrong Man&quot;; the unusual semidocumentary work of Hitchcock was based on an actual incident and partly filmed on location.

In 1957, Fonda made his first foray into producing with &quot;12 Angry Men&quot;, in which he also starred. The film was based on a teleplay and a script by Reginald Rose, and directed by Sidney Lumet. The low-budget production was completed in 17 days of filming, mostly in one claustrophobic jury room. It had a strong cast, including also Jack Klugman, Lee J. Cobb, Martin Balsam, and E. G. Marshall. The intense story about twelve jurors deciding the fate of a young man accused of murder was well received by critics worldwide. Fonda shared the Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations with co-producer Reginald Rose, and won the 1958 BAFTA Award for Best Actor for his performance as Juror 8. Early on, the film drew poorly, but after gaining recognition and awards, it proved a success. In spite of the outcome, Fonda vowed that he would never produce a movie again, fearing that failing as a producer might derail his acting career. After acting in the Western movies &quot;The Tin Star&quot; (1957) and &quot;Warlock&quot; (1959), Fonda returned to the production seat for the NBC Western television series &quot;The Deputy&quot; (1959–1961), in which he starred as Marshal Simon Fry. His co-stars were Allen Case and Read Morgan.
During the 1960s, Fonda performed in a number of war and Western epics, including 1962&#x27;s &quot;The Longest Day&quot; and the Cinerama production &quot;How the West Was Won&quot;, 1965&#x27;s &quot;In Harm&#x27;s Way&quot;, and &quot;Battle of the Bulge&quot;. In the Cold War suspense film &quot;Fail-Safe&quot; (1964), Fonda played the President of the United States who tries to avert a nuclear holocaust through tense negotiations with the Soviets after American bombers are mistakenly ordered to attack the USSR. He also returned to more light-hearted cinema in &quot;Spencer&#x27;s Mountain&quot; (1963), which was the inspiration for the 1970s TV series, &quot;The Waltons&quot;, based on the Great Depression of the 1930s memories of Earl Hamner Jr.

Fonda appeared against type as the villain &#x27;Frank&#x27; in 1968&#x27;s &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot;. After initially turning down the role, he was convinced to accept it by actor Eli Wallach and director Sergio Leone (who had previously tried to hire him to portray the Man with No Name in his Dollars Trilogy, a role that was later taken on by Clint Eastwood), who flew from Italy to the United States to persuade him to take the part. Fonda had planned on wearing a pair of brown-colored contact lenses, but Leone preferred the paradox of contrasting close-up shots of Fonda&#x27;s innocent-looking blue eyes with the vicious personality of the character Fonda portrayed.

Fonda&#x27;s relationship with Jimmy Stewart survived their disagreements over politics – Fonda was a liberal Democrat, and Stewart a conservative Republican. After a heated argument, they avoided talking politics with each other. The two men teamed up for 1968&#x27;s &quot;Firecreek&quot;, where Fonda again played the heavy. In 1970, Fonda and Stewart co-starred in the Western &quot;The Cheyenne Social Club&quot;, in which they humorously argued politics. They had first appeared together on film in &quot;On Our Merry Way&quot; (1948), an episodic comedy which also starred William Demarest and Fred MacMurray and featured a grown-up Carl &quot;Alfalfa&quot; Switzer, who had acted as a child in the &quot;Our Gang&quot; movie serials of the 1930s.

===Later career===

Despite approaching his seventies, Fonda continued to work in theater, television and film through the 1970s. In 1970, Fonda appeared in three films; the most successful was &quot;The Cheyenne Social Club&quot;. The other two films were &quot;Too Late the Hero&quot;, in which Fonda played a secondary role, and &quot;There Was a Crooked Man&quot;, about Paris Pitman Jr. (played by Kirk Douglas) trying to escape from an Arizona prison.

Fonda returned to both foreign and television productions, which provided career sustenance through a decade in which many aging screen actors suffered waning careers. He starred in the ABC television series &quot;The Smith Family&quot; between 1971 and 1972. A television film adaptation of John Steinbeck&#x27;s novel, 1973&#x27;s &quot;The Red Pony&quot;, earned Fonda an Emmy nomination. After the unsuccessful Hollywood melodrama, &quot;Ash Wednesday&quot;, he filmed three Italian productions released in 1973 and 1974. The most successful of these, &quot;My Name Is Nobody&quot;, presented Fonda in a rare comedic performance as an old gunslinger whose plans to retire are dampened by a &quot;fan&quot; of sorts.

Fonda continued stage acting throughout his last years, including several demanding roles in Broadway plays. He returned to Broadway in 1974 for the biographical drama, &quot;Clarence Darrow&quot;, for which he was nominated for a Tony Award. Fonda&#x27;s health had been deteriorating for years, but his first outward symptoms occurred after a performance of the play in April 1974, when he collapsed from exhaustion. After the appearance of a cardiac arrhythmia brought on by prostate cancer, he had a pacemaker installed following cancer surgery. Fonda returned to the play in 1975. After the run of a 1978 play, &quot;First Monday of October&quot;, he took the advice of his doctors and quit plays, though he continued to star in films and television.

Fonda appeared in a revival of &quot;The Time of Your Life&quot; that opened on March 17, 1972, at the Huntington Hartford Theater in Los Angeles, where Fonda, Richard Dreyfuss, Gloria Grahame, Ron Thompson, Strother Martin, Jane Alexander, Lewis J. Stadlen, Richard X. Slattery, and Pepper Martin were among the cast with Edwin Sherin directing.

In 1976, Fonda appeared in several notable television productions, the first being &quot;Collision Course&quot;, the story of the volatile relationship between President Harry Truman (E. G. Marshall) and General MacArthur (Fonda), produced by ABC. After an appearance in the acclaimed Showtime broadcast of &quot;Almos&#x27; a Man&quot;, based on a story by Richard Wright, he starred in the epic NBC miniseries Captains and the Kings, based on Taylor Caldwell&#x27;s novel. Three years later, he appeared in ABC&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, but the miniseries was overshadowed by its predecessor, &quot;Roots&quot;. Also in 1976, Fonda starred in the World War II blockbuster &quot;Midway&quot;.

Fonda finished the 1970s in a number of disaster films. The first of these was the 1977 Italian killer octopus thriller &quot;Tentacles&quot; and &quot;Rollercoaster&quot;, in which Fonda appeared with George Segal, Richard Widmark and a young Helen Hunt. He performed again with Widmark, Olivia de Havilland, Fred MacMurray, and José Ferrer in the killer bee action film &quot;The Swarm&quot;. He also acted in the global disaster film &quot;Meteor&quot; (his second role as a sitting President of the United States after &quot;Fail-Safe&quot;), with Sean Connery, Natalie Wood, and Karl Malden, and the Canadian production &quot;City on Fire&quot;, which also featured Shelley Winters and Ava Gardner. Fonda had a small role with his son, Peter, in &quot;Wanda Nevada&quot; (1979), with Brooke Shields.

As Fonda&#x27;s health declined and he took longer breaks between filming, critics began to acknowledge the value of his extensive body of work. In 1979, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. His Golden Plate was presented by Awards Council member Jimmy Stewart. In 1979, he was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame for his achievements on Broadway and received the Kennedy Center Honor. Lifetime Achievement awards from the Golden Globes and Academy Awards followed in 1980 and 1981, respectively.

Fonda continued to act into the early 1980s, though all but one of the productions in which he was featured before his death were for television. The television works included the live performance of Preston Jones&#x27;s &quot;The Oldest Living Graduate&quot; and the Emmy-nominated &quot;Gideon&#x27;s Trumpet&quot; (co-starring Fay Wray in her last performance) about Clarence Gideon&#x27;s fight to have the right to publicly funded legal counsel for the indigent.
&quot;On Golden Pond&quot; in 1981, the film adaptation of Ernest Thompson&#x27;s play, marked one final professional and personal triumph for Fonda. Directed by Mark Rydell, the project provided unprecedented collaborations between Fonda and Katharine Hepburn, along with Fonda and his daughter, Jane. The elder Fonda played an emotionally brittle and distant father who becomes more accessible at the end of his life. Jane Fonda has said that elements of the story mimicked their real-life relationship and helped them resolve certain issues. She bought the film rights in the hope that her father would play the role and later described it as &quot;a gift to my father that was so unbelievably successful.&quot;

Premiered in December 1981, the film was well received by critics and, after a limited release on December 4, &quot;On Golden Pond&quot; developed enough of an audience to be widely released on January 22. With 10 Academy Award nominations, the film earned nearly $120 million at the box office, becoming an unexpected blockbuster. In addition to wins for Hepburn (Best Actress), and Thompson (Screenplay), &quot;On Golden Pond&quot; brought Fonda his only Oscarfor Best Actor (he was the oldest recipient of the award; it also earned him a Golden Globe Best Actor award). Fonda was by that point too ill to attend the ceremony, and his daughter Jane accepted on his behalf. She said when accepting the award that her dad would probably quip, &quot;Well, ain&#x27;t I lucky.&quot; Years later, Fonda&#x27;s performance would be remembered as a &quot;brutally honest portrayal of frightened old age.&quot;

Fonda&#x27;s final performance was in the 1981 television drama &quot;Summer Solstice&quot; with Myrna Loy. It was filmed after &quot;On Golden Pond&quot; had wrapped and Fonda was in rapidly declining health.

==Personal life==

===Marriages and children===








Fonda was married five times and had three children, one of them adopted. His marriage to Margaret Sullavan in 1931 soon ended in separation, which was finalized in a 1933 divorce. Throughout most of 1935, Fonda dated actress/singer Shirley Ross; by year&#x27;s end, it had been widely reported—by, among others, then-syndicated columnist Ed Sullivan—that the couple was engaged, with wedding plans afoot. Reports notwithstanding, both parties evidently reconsidered and in January 1936 it was reported that Fonda was now seeing actress Virginia Bruce.

Later that year Fonda married Frances Ford Seymour Brokaw, widow of a wealthy industrialist, George Tuttle Brokaw. The Brokaws had a daughter who had been born soon after the Brokaws marriage in 1931.

Fonda had met Frances at Denham Studios in England on the set of &quot;Wings of the Morning&quot;, the first picture in Europe to be filmed in three-strip Technicolor. They had two children, Jane (b. 1937) and Peter (19402019), both of whom became successful actors. Jane has won two Best Actress Academy Awards, and Peter was nominated for two Oscars, one for Best Actor.

In August 1949, Fonda announced to Frances that he wanted a divorce so he could remarry; their 13 years of marriage had not been happy ones for him. Devastated by Fonda&#x27;s confession and plagued by emotional problems for many years, Frances went into the Craig House Sanitarium in January 1950 for treatment. She committed suicide there on April 14. Before her death, she had written six notes to various individuals, but left no final message for her husband. Fonda quickly arranged a private funeral with only himself and his mother-in-law, Sophie Seymour, in attendance. Years later, Dr. Margaret Gibson, the psychiatrist who had treated Frances at Austen Riggs, described Henry Fonda as &quot;a cold, self-absorbed person, a complete narcissist.&quot;

Later in 1950, Fonda married Susan Blanchard, his mistress. She was 21 years old, the daughter of Australian-born interior designer Dorothy Hammerstein, and the step-daughter of Oscar Hammerstein II. Together, they adopted a daughter, Amy Fishman (b. 1953). They divorced three years later. Blanchard was in awe of Fonda, and she described her role in the marriage as &quot;a geisha&quot;, doing everything she could to please him, dealing with and solving problems he would not acknowledge.

In 1957 Fonda married the Italian baroness Afdera Franchetti. They divorced in 1961. Soon after, in 1965, Fonda married Shirlee Mae Adams (born in 1932) and remained with her until his death in 1982.

Fonda&#x27;s relationship with his children has been described as &quot;emotionally distant&quot;. Fonda loathed displays of feeling in himself or others, and this was a consistent part of his character. Whenever he felt that his emotional wall was being breached, he had outbursts of anger, exhibiting a furious temper that terrified his family. In Peter Fonda&#x27;s 1998 autobiography &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Dad&quot; (1998), he described how he was never sure how his father felt about him. He never volunteered to his father that he loved him until he was elderly, and Peter finally heard, &quot;I love you, son.&quot; His daughter Jane rejected her father&#x27;s friendships with Republican actors such as John Wayne and James Stewart. Their relationship became extremely strained as Jane Fonda became a left-wing activist.

Jane Fonda reported feeling detached from her father, especially during her early acting days. In 1958 she met Lee Strasberg while visiting her father in Malibu. The Fonda and Strasberg families were neighbors, and she had developed a friendship with Strasberg&#x27;s daughter, Susan. Jane Fonda began studying acting with Strasberg, learning the techniques of &quot;The Method&quot; of which Strasberg was a renowned proponent. This proved to be a pivotal point in her career. As Jane Fonda developed her skill as an actress, she became frustrated with her father&#x27;s talent that, to her, appeared a demonstration of effortless ability.

===Political views===

Fonda was a supporter of the Democratic Party and &quot;an admirer&quot; of U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1960 Fonda appeared in a campaign commercial for presidential candidate John F. Kennedy. The ad focused on Kennedy&#x27;s naval service during World War II, specifically the famous PT-109 incident. He supported 
Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1964 United States presidential election, and Ted Kennedy in the 1980 Democratic Party primaries. He was initially a registered Republican, but switched parties.

===On acting===

The writer Al Aronowitz, while working on a profile of Jane Fonda for &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; in the 1960s, asked Henry Fonda about method acting: &quot;I can&#x27;t articulate about the Method&quot;, he told me, &quot;because I never studied it. I don&#x27;t mean to suggest that I have any feelings one way or the other about it...I don&#x27;t know what the Method is and I don&#x27;t care what the Method is. Everybody&#x27;s got a method. Everybody can&#x27;t articulate about their method, and I can&#x27;t, if I have a method—and Jane sometimes says that I use the Method, that is, the capital letter Method, without being aware of it. Maybe I do; it doesn&#x27;t matter.&quot;

Aronowitz reported Jane saying, &quot;My father can&#x27;t articulate the way he works. He just can&#x27;t do it. He&#x27;s not even conscious of what he does, and it made him nervous for me to try to articulate what I was trying to do. And I sensed that immediately, so we did very little talking about it...he said, &#x27;Shut up, I don&#x27;t want to hear about it.&#x27; He didn&#x27;t want me to tell him about it, you know. He wanted to make fun of it.&quot;

==Death==
Fonda died at his Los Angeles home on August 12, 1982, from heart disease. Fonda&#x27;s wife, Shirlee, his daughter Jane, and his son Peter were at his side that day. He suffered from prostate cancer, but this did not directly cause his death and was noted only as a concurrent ailment on his death certificate.

Fonda requested that no funeral be held, and his body was cremated. President Ronald Reagan, a former actor himself, hailed Fonda as &quot;a true professional dedicated to excellence in his craft. He graced the screen with a sincerity and accuracy which made him a legend.&quot;

The home where Fonda was born in 1905 is preserved at The Stuhr Museum of the Prairie Pioneer in Grand Island, Nebraska.

==Legacy==
Fonda is widely recognized as one of the Hollywood greats of the classic era. On the centenary of his birth, May 16, 2005, Turner Classic Movies (TCM) honored Fonda with a marathon of his films. Also in May 2005, the United States Post Office released a 37-cent postage stamp with an artist&#x27;s drawing of Fonda as part of their &quot;Hollywood legends&quot; series. The Fonda Theatre in Hollywood, originally known as the Carter DeHaven Music Box, was named for the actor in 1985 by the Nederlander Organization.

== In popular culture ==
In Joseph Heller&#x27;s satirical novel &quot;Catch-22,&quot; there is a running joke that fictional character Major Major Major Major resembles Henry Fonda. Philip D. Beidler comments that &quot;one of the novel&#x27;s great absurd jokes is the character&#x27;s bewildering resemblance to Henry Fonda&quot;. Taking into account when &quot;Catch-22&quot; was written, this most likely refers to Fonda circa 1955, when he starred in the film &quot;Mister Roberts&quot;.

==Filmography==
From the beginning of his career in 1935 through his last projects in 1981, Fonda appeared in 106 films, television programs, and shorts. Through the course of his career, he appeared in many films, including classics such as &quot;12 Angry Men&quot; and &quot;The Ox-Bow Incident&quot;. He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in 1940&#x27;s &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; and won for his part in 1981&#x27;s &quot;On Golden Pond&quot;. Fonda made his mark in Westerns (which included his most villainous role as Frank in &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot;) and war films, and made frequent appearances in both television and foreign productions late in his career.

<doc id="46229" wikidata="Q4900133" url="?curid=46229" title="Beyond the Fringe">
<text>Beyond the Fringe was a British comedy stage revue written and performed by Alan Bennett, Peter Cook, Jonathan Miller, and Dudley Moore. It debuted at the 1960 Edinburgh Festival and went on to play in London&#x27;s West End and then in America, both on tour and on New York&#x27;s Broadway in the early 1960s. Hugely successful, it is widely regarded as seminal to the &quot;satire boom&quot;, the rise of satirical comedy in 1960s Britain.

==The show==
The idea for &quot;Beyond the Fringe&quot; came from Robert Ponsonby, who was the director of the Edinburgh International Festival from 1956 to 1960. Ponsonby&#x27;s idea was to bring together the best parts of the revues staged by the Cambridge Footlights and The Oxford Revue at the Edinburgh Fringe in previous years. He said that the Festival should put on a late-night revue &quot;to beat The Fringe at its own game.&quot; By 1960, the Festival was so firmly established that &quot;it required for its health some good-humoured self-mockery.&quot; 

Ponsonby&#x27;s assistant, John &quot;Johnny&quot; Bassett, recommended Dudley Moore, who had played with Bassett in a jazz band while at university in Oxford. Moore in turn recommended Alan Bennett, who had had a hit at the Fringe a few years earlier. Bassett also chose Jonathan Miller, who had been a Footlights star in 1957. Miller recommended Cook.

Bennett and Miller were already pursuing careers in academia and medicine respectively, but Cook had an agent, having written a West End revue for Kenneth Williams. Cook&#x27;s agent negotiated a higher weekly fee for him, but by the time the agent&#x27;s fee was deducted Cook actually earned less than the others from the initial run.

The majority of the sketches were by Cook and were largely based on material written for other revues. Among the entirely new material were &quot;The End of the World&quot;, &quot;TVPM&quot; and &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot;. Cook and Moore revived some of the sketches on their later television and stage shows, most famously the two-hander &quot;One Leg Too Few&quot;. Miller told the press in March 1960 that the show would &quot;be anti-establishment, anti-capital punishment, anti-colour bar and anti-1960. But it will be all very serious stuff, sharp, bitter and to the point.&quot;

The show&#x27;s run in Edinburgh was immensely successful. Before beginning its run in the West End, the show had great success at the Cambridge Arts Theatre, but a brief run in Brighton garnered a lukewarm response. When the revue transferred to the Fortune Theatre in London, opening in early May 1961, in a revised production by Donald Albery and William Donaldson and directed by Eleanor Fazan, it became a true sensation. This was helped in large part by a favourable review by Kenneth Tynan.

In 1962, the show transferred to the John Golden Theatre in New York, with its original cast. President John F. Kennedy attended a performance on 10 February 1963. The show continued in New York, with most of the original cast, until 1964, when Paxton Whitehead replaced Miller, while the London version continued with a different cast until 1966.

==Controversy==
The revue was widely considered to be ahead of its time, both in its unapologetic willingness to debunk figures of authority, and by virtue of its inherently surrealistic comedic vein. Humiliation of authority was something only previously delved into in &quot;The Goon Show&quot; and, arguably, &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot;, with such parliamentarians as Sir Winston Churchill and Harold Macmillan coming under special scrutiny—although the BBC were predisposed to frown upon it. Macmillan—according to Cook—was not particularly fond of the slurred caricature and charade of senile forgetfulness (marked by a failure to pronounce &#x27;Conservative Party&#x27; coherently) handed down on him in Cook&#x27;s impersonation. Since &quot;Beyond the Fringe&quot; was not owned by the BBC, however, the quartet enjoyed relative carte blanche. The only protocol they were obliged to adhere to was that, by law, their scripts had to be sent to the Lord Chamberlain for approval prior to performance, a requirement abolished in 1968.

Most specifically, its lampooning of the British war effort in a sketch titled &quot;The Aftermyth of War&quot; was scorned by some war veterans for its supposed insensitivity. One British visitor to the Broadway performance was said to have stood up and shouted &#x27;rotters!&#x27; at a sketch he found distasteful, before apparently sitting down again and enjoying the remainder of the show, while another, at the first performance in Edinburgh, allegedly stood up and declared that the &#x27;young bounders don&#x27;t know the first thing about it!&#x27; and promptly left the auditorium. In response to these negative audience reactions, the &quot;Beyond the Fringe&quot; team said that they were not ridiculing the efforts of those involved in the war, but were challenging the subsequent media portrayal of them.

== Influence ==

&quot;Beyond the Fringe&quot; was a forerunner to British television programmes &quot;That Was the Week That Was&quot;, &quot;At Last the 1948 Show&quot;, and &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;.

As with the established comedy revue, it was a series of satirical sketches and musical pieces using a minimal set, looking at events of the day and, with Shakespeare, the past. It effectively represented the views and disappointments of the first generation of British people to grow up after World War II, and gave voice to a sense of the loss of national purpose with the end of the British Empire. Although all of the cast contributed material, the most often quoted pieces were those by Cook, many of which had appeared before in his Cambridge Footlights revues. The show broke new ground with Peter Cook&#x27;s impression of then Prime Minister Harold Macmillan; on one occasion, this was performed with Macmillan in the audience, and Cook added an &quot;ad lib&quot; ridiculing Macmillan for turning up to watch.

The show is credited with giving many other performers the courage to be satirical and more improvisational in their manner, and broke the conventions of not lampooning the Royal Family or the government of the day. Shakespearean drama was another target of their comedy. There were also a number of musical items in the show, using Dudley Moore&#x27;s music, most famously an arrangement of the Colonel Bogey March which resists Moore&#x27;s repeated attempts to bring it to an end.

The show prefigured the Satire Boom of the 1960s. Without it, there might not have been either &quot;That Was the Week That Was&quot; or &quot;Private Eye&quot;, the satirical magazine which originated at the same time, that partially survived due to financial support from Peter Cook, and that served as the model for the later American &quot;Spy&quot; magazine. Cook and Moore formed a comedy duo and appeared in the popular television show &quot;Not Only... But Also&quot;, and the 1967 film &quot;Bedazzled&quot;. Cook also launched his club, The Establishment, around this time. Many of the members of Monty Python recall being inspired by &quot;Beyond the Fringe&quot;.

The retrospective show &quot;Before the Fringe&quot;, broadcast during the early years of BBC 2, took its title from this production. It consisted of performances of material that was popular in theatrical revue before the advent of &quot;Beyond the Fringe&quot;.

==International success==

The show&#x27;s success was not limited to the UK. In 1962, it also opened in South Africa. Next it arrived in the US. First the Broadway Company opened on 27 October 1962, then it was performed by the National Company in 1963. Subsequently, opening on 8 October 1964, the National Touring Company took it on a nationwide tour for six months as &quot;Beyond the Fringe &#x27;65&quot; under the auspices of Alexander H. Cohen, with the cast consisting of Bob Cessna, Donald Cullen, Joel Fabiani, and James Valentine. Slight changes were made to adapt the show for American audiences, for instance the opening number (discussing America) was retitled &quot;Home Thoughts from Abroad&quot;.

The show was revived in slightly altered form in Los Angeles in 2000 and 2001 by Joseph Dunn&#x27;s ReEstablishment Theater to critical acclaim.

==Legacy==

The four original members of &quot;Beyond the Fringe&quot; feature prominently as characters in the play &quot;Pete and Dud: Come Again&quot;, by Chris Bartlett and Nick Awde. Appropriately, that comedy-drama had a sellout run at the 2005 Edinburgh Festival Fringe before transferring to London&#x27;s West End at The Venue, in 2006, in a version starring Kevin Bishop as Moore, Tom Goodman-Hill as Cook, Fergus Craig as Alan Bennett and Colin Hoult as Jonathan Miller. It subsequently embarked on a nationwide tour.

The creation, performance and aftermath of the show are covered in the 2004 film &quot;Not Only But Always&quot;.

&quot;Good Evening&quot;, Roy Smiles&#x27; play about the Beyond The Fringe team, was broadcast on Radio 4 in 2008, with Benedict Cumberbatch as Dudley Moore.

In 2017, &quot;Beyond the Fringe&quot; was recreated for an episode of the Netflix TV series &quot;The Crown&quot; in which Prime Minister Macmillan is in attendance and singled out for abuse by Peter Cook (performed by Patrick Warner.)

<text>James Clayton Dobson Jr.
(born April 21, 1936) is an American evangelical Christian author, psychologist, and founder of Focus on the Family (FotF), which he led from 1977 until 2010. In the 1980s, he was ranked as one of the most influential spokesmen for conservative social positions in American public life. Although never an ordained minister, he was called &quot;the nation&#x27;s most influential evangelical leader&quot; by &quot;The New York Times&quot; while &quot;Slate&quot; portrayed him as a successor to evangelical leaders Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson.

As part of his former role in the organization he produced the daily radio program &quot;Focus on the Family&quot;, which the organization has said was broadcast in more than a dozen languages and on over 7,000 stations worldwide, and reportedly heard daily by more than 220 million people in 164 countries. &quot;Focus on the Family&quot; was also carried by about 60 U.S. television stations daily. In 2010, he launched the radio broadcast &quot;Family Talk with Dr. James Dobson&quot;.

Dobson advocates for &quot;family values&quot; the instruction of children in heterosexuality and traditional gender roles, which he believes are mandated by the Christian Bible. The goal of this is to promote heterosexual marriage, which he views as a cornerstone of civilization that must be protected from the dangers of feminism and the LGBT rights movement. Dobson seeks to equip his audience to fight in the American culture war, which he calls the &quot;Civil War of Values&quot;.

His writing career started as an assistant to Paul Popenoe. After Dobson&#x27;s rise to prominence through promoting corporal punishment of disobedient children in the 1970s, he became a founder of purity culture in the 1990s. He has promoted his ideas via his various Focus on the Family affiliated organizations, the Family Research Council which he founded in 1981, Family Policy Alliance which he founded in 2004, the Dr. James Dobson Family Institute which he founded in 2010, and a network of US state-based lobbying organizations called Family Policy Councils.

==Early life and education==
James Dobson was born to Myrtle Georgia (née Dillingham) and James C. Dobson Sr. on April 21, 1936, in Shreveport, Louisiana. From his earliest childhood, religion played a central part in his life. He once told a reporter that he learned to pray before he learned to talk, and says he gave his life to Jesus at the age of three, in response to an altar call by his father. He is the son, grandson, and great-grandson of Church of the Nazarene ministers.

Dobson&#x27;s mother was intolerant of &quot;sassiness&quot; and would strike her child with whatever object came to hand, including a shoe or belt; she once gave Dobson a &quot;massive blow&quot; with a girdle outfitted with straps and buckles.

The parents took their young son along to watch his father preach. Like most Nazarenes, they forbade dancing and going to movies. Young &quot;Jimmie Lee&quot; (as he was called) concentrated on his studies.

Dobson studied academic psychology and came to believe that he was being called to become a Christian counselor or perhaps a Christian psychologist. He attended Pasadena College (now Point Loma Nazarene University) as an undergraduate and served as captain of the school&#x27;s tennis team. In 1967, Dobson received his doctorate in psychology from the University of Southern California.

==Career==
===Early career===
In 1967, he became an Associate Clinical Professor of Pediatrics at the University of Southern California School of Medicine for 14 years. At USC he was exposed to troubled youth and the counterculture of the 1960s. He found it &quot;a distressing time to be so young&quot; because society offered him no moral absolutes he felt he could rely upon. Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War was blossoming into a widespread rejection of authority, which Dobson viewed as &quot;a sudden disintegration of moral and ethical principles&quot; among Americans his age and the younger people he saw in clinical practice. This convinced him that &quot;the institution of the family was disintegrating.&quot;

He spent 17 years on the staff of the Children&#x27;s Hospital of Los Angeles in the Division of Child Development and Medical Genetics. For a time, Dobson worked as an assistant to Paul Popenoe at the Institute of Family Relations, a marriage-counseling center, in Los Angeles. Popenoe counseled couples on the importance of same-race marriage and adherence to gender norms for the purpose of eugenics. Under Popenoe, Dobson published about male-female differences and the dangers of feminism.

When the American Psychological Association de-pathologized homosexuality by removing it from their list of mental disorders in 1973, Dobson resigned from the organization in protest. In 1976, he took a sabbatical from USC and Children&#x27;s Hospital; he never returned. 

With funding from a Christian publisher, he began to broadcast his ideas on the radio and in public lectures. Saying that he feared to repeat the mistakes of his own absentee father by being away on the lecture circuit, Dobson video recorded and distributed his lectures. He sent a representative around the country to solicit funding from Evangelical businessmen and distribute the videos. A video about absent fathers titled &quot;Where&#x27;s Dad?&quot; had 100 million views by the early 1980s.

===Focus on the Family===
In 1977, he founded Focus on the Family. He grew the organization into a multimedia empire by the mid-1990s, including 10 radio programs, 11 magazines, numerous videos, and basketball camps, and program of faxing suggested sermon topics and bulletin fillers to thousands of churches every week. In 1995, the organization&#x27;s budget was more than $100 million annually.

Jimmy Carter organized a White House Conference on Families in 1979–1980 that explicitly included a &quot;diversity of families&quot; with various structures. Dobson objected to this, believing that only his preferred notion of the traditional family one headed by a male breadwinner married to a female caregiver should be endorsed by the conference. He also objected to the fact that he was not invited to the planning for the event. At Dobson&#x27;s urging, his listeners wrote 80,000 letters to the White House asking for Dobson to be invited, which he eventually was. This demonstrated to Dobson his power to rally his followers for political ends.

Beginning in 1980, Dobson built networks of political activists and founded lobbying organizations that advocated against LGBT rights and opposed legal abortion, among other socially conservative policy goals. He nurtured relationships with conservative politicians, such as Ronald Reagan. He was among the founders of Family Research Council in 1981, a federal lobbying organization classified as a hate group, and Family Policy Councils that lobby at the level of state government. When Focus on the Family moved to Colorado Springs in 1991, the city started to be called &quot;the Vatican of the Religious Right&quot; with Dobson imagined as an evangelical pope.

Focus on the Family established an ex-gay program called Love Won Out in 1998. The program promoted conversion therapy, the pseudoscientific practice of attempting to make gay people straight. Dobson increased his promotion of Love Won Out in 2000 upon discovering that opposition to gay marriage was helping the Christian Right gain members and voters. State-level affiliates of FotF drafted gay marriage bans in several states, starting with Nebraska Initiative 416 in 2000. Dobson broadcast that gay marriage was turning children from faithful Christian homes against God. His arguments caused large evangelical turnouts in support of the gay marriage prohibitions, resulting in defense of marriage amendments to thirty U.S. state constitutions.

Dobson stepped down as president and CEO of Focus on the Family in 2003, and resigned from the position of chairman of the board in February 2009. Dobson explained his departure as twofold: firstly, to allow a smooth transfer of leadership to the next generation, and in this case, to Jim Daly whom he directly appointed as his replacement. And secondly, because he and Daly had divergent views on policy, &quot;especially when it comes to confronting those who would weaken the family and undermine our faith.&quot; After he stepped down, Focus on the Family hired an orthodoxy expert to maintain Dobson&#x27;s message. Free to become more explicitly political without imperiling Focus on the Family&#x27;s tax exemptions, Dobson rededicated himself primarily to lobbying instead of advice to families. While Daly attempted to appeal to a new generation of evangelicals with softened messages on abortion and homosexuality, Dobson remained hard-line. Focus on the Family removed archives of Dobson&#x27;s writing from their headquarters and website.

===Ted Bundy interview===
Dobson interviewed serial killer Ted Bundy on-camera the day before Bundy&#x27;s execution on January 24, 1989. The interview became controversial because Bundy was given an opportunity to attempt to explain his actions (the rape and murder of 30 young women). Bundy claimed in the interview (in a reversal of his previous stance) that violent pornography played a significant role in molding and crystallizing his fantasies. In May 1989, during an interview with John Tanner, a Republican Florida prosecutor, Dobson called for Bundy to be forgiven. The Bundy tapes gave Focus on the Family revenues of over $1 million, $600,000 of which it donated to anti-pornography groups and to anti-abortion groups.

===Shift to political activity===
In 2004, Dobson founded Family Policy Alliance, a lobbying arm of his media empire. With a more permissive tax status than Focus on the Family, it is allowed to directly fundraise for political campaigns. The Alliance also coordinates the action of Dobson&#x27;s network of state-based Family Policy Councils. Together, these organizations seek to encode traditional gender roles into public policy and law. They consider LGBT rights to be a threatening &quot;LGBT agenda.&quot;

Throughout its existence, Dobson has attacked the President&#x27;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), a US government program to fight AIDS worldwide. In 2006, he claimed that &quot;80 percent of this money is going toward terrible programs that are immoral as well as ineffective. For example, to promote condom distribution, people associated with these government programs have dressed up like condoms and created ceramic sculptures of male genitalia.&quot; He renewed his attack in 2023, falsely claiming that PEPFAR funds abortions. Focus on the Family received a grant of $49,505 through PEPFAR in 2017 to operate an abstinence-only purity pledge program.

===Dr. James Dobson Family Institute===
In 2010, Dobson founded the Dr. James Dobson Family Institute, a non-profit organization that produces his radio program, &quot;Dr. James Dobson&#x27;s Family Talk&quot;. On this program, he speaks about his views, such as attributing mass shootings to &quot;the LGBTQ movement&quot; destroying the family. He stepped away from leadership of the Dr. James Dobson Family Institute in 2022, naming Joe Waresak the new president. He continues to broadcast his radio show.

Dobson frequently appears as a guest on the Fox News Channel.

==Personal life==

Dobson married Shirley Deere on August 26, 1960. The couple have two children, Danae and Ryan.

Dobson turned control of some of Focus on the Family&#x27;s youth-oriented magazine titles over to his son Ryan Dobson in 2009. Danae Dobson received a golden key necklace as a gift from her father when she voiced her commitment to sexual purity at age ten. James Dobson encouraged other parents to give similar gifts.

==Awards==
At the invitation of Presidents and Attorneys General, Dobson has also served on government advisory panels and testified at several government hearings. He was given the &quot;Layman of the Year&quot; award by the National Association of Evangelicals in 1982, &quot;The Children&#x27;s Friend&quot; honor by Childhelp USA (an advocate agency against child abuse) in 1987, and the Humanitarian Award by the California Psychological Association in 1988. In 2005, Dobson received an honorary doctorate (his 16th) from Indiana Wesleyan University and was inducted into IWU&#x27;s &quot;Society of World Changers&quot;, while speaking at the university&#x27;s Academic Convocation.

In 2008, Dobson&#x27;s &quot;Focus on the Family&quot; program was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame to controversy from secular listeners opposed to Dobson&#x27;s views, along with those supporting LGBTQ rights. 

==Social views==

=== Views on marriage ===
James Dobson is a strong proponent of marriage defined as &quot;one where husband and wife are lawfully married, are committed to each other for life,&quot; and have a homemaker mother and breadwinner father. According to his view, women are not deemed inferior to men because both are created in God&#x27;s image, but each gender has biblically mandated roles. He recommends that married women with children under the age of 18 focus on mothering, rather than work outside the home.

Dobson views marriage as a transaction in which women exchange sex for protection:
He advises wives to use their social and sexual skills to coerce their husbands into becoming good partners. By doing this, according to Dobson, women will transform male lust into love, and male destructive impulses into useful accomplishments. Hence heterosexual marriage is the cornerstone of civilization, in Dobson&#x27;s view, when women fulfill their role of civilizing their husbands.

In his 2004 book &quot;Marriage Under Fire&quot;, Dobson suggests that heterosexual marriage rates in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden have been falling, and that this is due to the recognition of same-sex relationships by those countries during the 1990s. He remarks that the &quot;institution of marriage in those countries is rapidly dying&quot; as a result, with most young people cohabiting or choosing to remain single (living alone) and illegitimacy rates rising in some Norwegian counties up to 80%.

Dobson writes that &quot;every civilization in the world&quot; has been built upon marriage. He also believes that homosexuality is neither a choice nor genetic, but is caused by external factors during early childhood. He anecdotally cites as evidence the life of actress Anne Heche, who was previously in a relationship with Ellen DeGeneres. Criticizing &quot;the realities of judicial tyranny,&quot; Dobson has written that &quot;[t]here is no issue today that is more significant to our culture than the defense of the family. Not even the war on terror eclipses it.&quot;

===Views on schooling===
Focus on the Family supports private school vouchers and tax credits for religious schools. According to Focus on the Family website, Dobson believes that parents are ultimately responsible for their children&#x27;s education, and encourages parents to visit their children&#x27;s schools to ask questions and to join the PTA so that they may voice their opinions. Dobson opposes sex education curricula that are not abstinence-only.

According to People for the American Way, Focus on the Family material has been used to challenge a book or curriculum taught in public schools. Critics, such as People for the American Way, allege that Focus on the Family encourages Christian teachers to establish prayer groups in public schools. Dobson supports student-led prayer in public schools, and believes that allowing student-led Christian prayer in schools does not violate the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.

===Views on discipline of children===
In his book &quot;Dare to Discipline&quot;, Dobson advocates the spanking of children as young as fifteen months and up to eight years old when they misbehave, using switches or belts kept on the child&#x27;s dresser as a reminder of authority. In Dobson&#x27;s opinion, parents must uphold their authority and do so consistently: &quot;When you are defiantly challenged, win decisively.&quot; Dobson says corporal punishment should end with the child asking for forgiveness and receiving a hug. After a spanking is a good time to have a &quot;heart to heart&quot; talk with a child, according to Dobson: &quot;After the emotional ventilation, the child will often want to crumple at the breast of his parent&quot; which provides an opportunity to re-bond and express love to the child. Though &quot;Dare to Discipline&quot; was not overtly political, Dobson considered his parenting techniques to be the solution to the social unrest of the 1960s. The book was a rebuttal to Benjamin Spock, whose parenting ideas were more permissive. By returning to the authoritarian parenting style popular in prior eras, Dobson hoped to preserve order, obedience, and social hierarchy. The book quickly sold over two million copies, establishing Dobson as a trusted authority among parents bewildered by the rapid changes of the era.

In &quot;The Strong-Willed Child&quot;, Dobson draws an analogy between the defiance of a family pet and that of a small child, and concludes that &quot;just as surely as a dog will occasionally challenge the authority of his leaders, so will a little child—only more so.&quot; &quot;The Strong-Willed Child&quot; says that if authority is portrayed correctly to a child, the child will understand how to interact with other authority figures:

If allowed to challenge parental authority, Dobson says, children would challenge God&#x27;s authority when they grew older. Hence, rebellion must be punished to protect the child&#x27;s salvation. Believing that &quot;pain is a marvelous purifier&quot; Dobson recommended corporal punishment as the most effective way to keep the child subordinate to adults. The parent should model both divine mercy and wrath to prepare the inherently sinful child for a relationship with God. Dobson warned of the dire consequences of failing to discipline one&#x27;s children: &quot;Eli, the priest, permitted his sons to desecrate the temple. All three were put to death.&quot;

He warns against &quot;harsh spanking&quot; because &quot;It is not necessary to beat the child into submission; a little bit of pain goes a long way for a young child. However, the spanking should be of sufficient magnitude to cause the child to cry genuinely.&quot; In a 1997 book, he warns that &quot;discipline must not be harsh and destructive to the child&#x27;s spirit.&quot; Dobson considers disciplining children to be a necessary but unpleasant part of raising children that should only be carried out by qualified parents:

When asked &quot;How long do you think a child should be allowed to cry after being punished? Is there a limit?&quot; Dobson responded:

Sociologists John Bartkowski and Christopher Ellison have stated that Dobson&#x27;s views &quot;diverge sharply from those recommended by contemporary mainstream experts&quot; and are not based on any sort of empirical testing, but rather are nothing more than expressions of his religious doctrines of &quot;biblical literalism and &#x27;authority-mindedness. In the 1980s Penelope Leach wrote that Dobson&#x27;s approach is ineffective because, rather than establishing parental authority, spanking only communicates parental frustration and weakness.

Although childrearing experts have discredited corporal punishment, Dobson has not moderated his view. In 2015 he wrote that, when spanking fails to make a child obey, the problem may be that the parent is not hitting hard enough or frequently enough.

===Views on tolerance and diversity===
In the winter of 2004-2005, the We Are Family Foundation sent American elementary schools approximately 60,000 copies of a free DVD using popular cartoon characters (especially SpongeBob SquarePants) to &quot;promote tolerance and diversity.&quot; Dobson contended that &quot;tolerance&quot; and &quot;diversity&quot; are &quot;buzzwords&quot; that the We Are Family Foundation misused as part of a &quot;hidden agenda&quot; to promote homosexuality. Kate Zernik noted Dobson asserting: &quot;tolerance and its first cousin, diversity, &#x27;are almost always buzzwords for homosexual advocacy.&#x27;&quot; He stated on the Focus on the Family website that &quot;childhood symbols are apparently being hijacked to promote an agenda that involves teaching homosexual propaganda to children.&quot; He offered as evidence the association of many leading LGBT rights organizations, including GLAAD, GLSEN, HRC, and PFLAG, with the We Are Family Foundation as shown by links which he claims once existed on their website.

The We Are Family Foundation countered that Dobson had mistaken their organization with &quot;an unrelated Web site belonging to another group called &#x27;We Are Family,&#x27; which supports gay youth.&quot; Dobson countered:

In September 2005, Tolerance.org published a follow-up message advertising the DVD&#x27;s continued availability, including We Are Family Foundation president Nancy Hunt&#x27;s speculation that many of the DVDs may be &quot;still sitting in boxes, unused, because of Dobson&#x27;s vitriolic attack.&quot;

===Views on homosexuality===
In Dobson&#x27;s view, homosexuality results from influences in a child&#x27;s environment rather than an inborn trait. He states that homosexual behavior, specifically &quot;unwanted same-sex attraction&quot;, has been and can be &quot;overcome&quot; through understanding developmental models for homosexuality and choosing to heal the complex developmental issues which led to same-sex attraction.

Focus on the Family ministry sponsors the monthly conference Love Won Out, where participants hear &quot;powerful stories of ex-gay men and women.&quot; Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (P-FLAG) has protested against the conference in Orlando, questioning both its methodology and supposed success. In regards to the conference, Dobson has stated that &quot;Gay activists come with preconceived notions about who we are and what we believe and about the hate that boils from within, which is simply not true. Regardless of what the media might say, Focus on the Family has no interest in promoting hatred toward homosexuals or anyone else. We also don&#x27;t wish to deprive them of their basic constitutional rights ... The Constitution applies to all of us.&quot; Dobson strongly opposes the movement to legitimize same-sex relationships. In his book &quot;Bringing Up Boys&quot;, Dobson states, &quot;[T]he disorder is not typically &#x27;chosen.&#x27; Homosexuals deeply resent being told that they selected this same-sex inclination in pursuit of sexual excitement or some other motive. It is unfair, and I don&#x27;t blame them for being irritated by that assumption. Who among us would knowingly choose a path that would result in alienation from family, rejection by friends, disdain from the heterosexual world, exposure to sexually transmitted diseases such as AIDS and tuberculosis, and even a shorter lifespan?&quot;

Critics have stated that Dobson&#x27;s views on homosexuality do not represent the mainstream views of the mental health community, with Dan Gilgoff referring to the positions of the American Psychiatric Association and the American Psychological Association on homosexuality. Sociologist Judith Stacey criticized Dobson for claiming that sociological studies show that gay couples do not make good parents. She stated that Dobson&#x27;s claim &quot;is a direct misrepresentation of my research.&quot; In response to Dobson&#x27;s claim that &quot;there have been more than ten thousand studies that have showed that children do best when they are raised with a mother and a father who are committed to each other,&quot; Stacey replied that &quot;[a]ll of those studies that Dobson is referring to are studies that did not include gay or lesbian parents as part of the research base.&quot;

Dobson objected to a bill expanding the prohibition of sexual orientation-based discrimination in the areas of &quot;public accommodation, housing practices, family planning services and twenty other areas.&quot; He said that, were such a bill passed, public businesses could no longer separate locker rooms and bathrooms by gender, which he claimed would lead to a situation where, &quot;every woman and little girl will have to fear that a predator, bisexual, cross-dresser or even a homosexual or heterosexual male might walk in and relieve himself in their presence.&quot;

In 2017, Dobson was among the first to sign the Nashville Statement, written by the Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood. The statement specifies conservative evangelical views on gender roles and sexuality, condemning LGBT-affirming Christians: &quot;We affirm that it is sinful to approve of homosexual immorality or transgenderism and that such approval constitutes an essential departure from Christian faithfulness and witness.&quot;

===Views on mass shootings===

In 2012, in a broadcast titled &quot;A Nation Shaken by the Sandy Hook Tragedy,&quot; Dobson said that the mass shooting was a judgement by God because of American acceptance of gay marriage and legal abortion. Similarly, Dobson said the 2019 El Paso shooting and mass shootings in general happen because &quot;the LGBTQ movement is closing in on the God-inspired and established institution of the family.&quot;

===Views on abortion===

Early in his career, Dobson appeared to accept abortion. He wrote a forward for a 1973 book, &quot;Sex is a Parent Affair&quot;, that takes a nonjudgemental stance toward abortion because &quot;the Bible is silent on the subject&quot; except for some interpretations of which &quot;may indicate a developing embryo or fetus was not regarded as a full human being.&quot; In general, the evangelical movement did not speak much about abortion until the 1980s.

Starting in the 1980s, Dobson became an implacable enemy of legal abortion, and a major force in the anti-abortion movement. His message centered upon biblically moral mothers who sacrificed for their children; he chastised unmarried mothers or rebellious teenagers who selfishly treated unwanted pregnancy as an inconvenience rather than a sacred duty. He broadcast interviews with women who kept pregnancies because their trust in God overcame their own emotions and desires. For example, he published a story celebrating Jane Stillson, who chose to finish a pregnancy even though it prevented her from completing her treatment for cancer, thus risking her life.

Dobson contends that abortion invites women to reject God, diverts women from their natural role as mothers, and prevents more Christians from coming into the world. Ending abortion, in his view, would redeem society by binding women to their divine role. Focus on the Family and its allied lobbying organizations are among the US&#x27;s most powerful advocates for restrictions on abortion access.

===Views on gender===

Dobson views the gender binary as fundamental to humanity; he believes God created men and women to differ &quot;in every cell of their bodies.&quot; These complementary differences make them well-suited to traditional gender roles. &quot;Males and females differ biochemically, anatomically, and emotionally&quot; according to Dobson. Men like to &quot;hunt and fish and hike in the wilderness&quot; while women prefer to &quot;stay at home and wait for them.&quot; Because men have a fragile ego and women are emotionally vulnerable, &quot;men derive self-esteem by being respected; women feel worthy when they are loved.&quot; Men and women are obligated to adhere to the &quot;time-honored roles of protector and protected.&quot;

Though created for traditional gender roles, people are not born following these roles. The roles must be taught, Dobson says, and must be defended from anyone who questions them. Dobson argues that confused gender relationships in a household result in homosexuality if a child displaces their sexual feelings onto the same-sex parent. Hence, parents should model a romance-like relationship with their opposite-sex child, according to Dobson, with the ultimate goal of steering the child toward heterosexual marriage as an adult.

Dobson encourages &quot;daddy-daughter dating&quot; in which fathers and daughters set aside time for special activities together. Because he believes heterosexuality must be cultivated, Dobson intended these romanticized attachments to model proper heterosexual partnership to girls age six or younger. An employee of Dobson&#x27;s created the first purity ball a father-daughter dance event promoting female chastity in 1998. Dobson promoted the purity balls on his radio show. Along with other fundamentalist figures such as Billy Graham, Dobson is considered a founder of purity culture, a Christian subculture in which sexual immorality by women or LGBT people is considered a national threat.

Dobson considers transgender people a threat, writing in 2016 that &quot;a married man with any gumption&quot; would defend his wife&#x27;s privacy in the bathroom from &quot;a strange-looking man, dressed like a woman.&quot; He seemed to romanticize a time in the past in when men were masculine enough to shoot trans women. He also considers feminists a threat because they question the natural leadership of men. In his 1975 book &quot;What Wives Wish Their Husbands Knew About Women&quot; he denounces the &quot;feminist propaganda&quot; of strong female characters in movies, complaining when men are shown as inferior to a &quot;confident superchick.&quot; This is dangerous, he says, because the true role of women is to harness the superior energy of men.

====Gendered language in the Bible====
In response to a 1997 article in &quot;World&quot; magazine claiming that the &quot;New International Version&quot; of the Bible was going to be printed with gender-neutral language, Dobson called a meeting at Focus on the Family headquarters of influential men in the religious publishing business. The group drafted the &quot;Colorado Springs Guidelines&quot; which require Bible translations to use male-default language such as the word &quot;man&quot; to designate the human race. As a result, plans for the gender-neutral Bible version were halted. When Dobson discovered his own &quot;Odyssey Bible&quot; used gender-neutral language, he discontinued it and offered refunds. According to &quot;World&quot;, Dobson&#x27;s 1997 meeting eventually led to the publication of the &quot;English Standard Version&quot; in 2001, which avoids gender-neutral language. He opposed publication of &quot;Today&#x27;s New International Version&quot; in 2002 because of the &quot;political correctness&quot; of the translation and the publisher&#x27;s rejection of the Colorado Springs Guidelines.

==Political and social influence==

Dobson&#x27;s social and political opinions are widely read among many evangelical church congregations in the United States; he is also highly influential within the United States Republican Party. Among other conservative causes, his lobbying contributed significantly to banning same-sex marriage across many US states.

===Social influence===

Dobson&#x27;s books on corporal punishment helped to legitimize the practice, providing it with theological grounding for Christian readers. When opposition to physical discipline became widespread in the 1980s and 1990s in American society, conservative Protestants emerged as perhaps the most ardent remaining supporters of corporal punishment. This support was bolstered by &quot;authority-centered&quot; parenting techniques advised in Dobson&#x27;s books.

Dobson frequently cautions parents to use corporal punishment only in a limited and empathetic way. Theologian Donald Eric Capps and psychologist Adah Maurer argued in the 1990s that, in practice, parents frequently use indiscriminate violence against children. They argue Dobson&#x27;s work provides parents with self-serving theological rationalizations for their violent outbursts. Capps and Maurer conclude that the popularity of corporal punishment in this era damaged children in ways that may last into adulthood.

Throughout his career at Focus on the Family, Dobson argued for gender role instruction. He believed that gender and sexuality were not fixed from birth, but required careful cultivation. He sought to provide boys with outlets for their natural aggression, and to teach girls how to develop romantic partnerships, which they use to channel and refine male destructive impulses into civilized behavior. Thus the feminist and LGBT rights movements, because they seek to disturb gender roles, are a threat not only to family harmony but to national strength. To preserve pious gender roles, Dobson distributed Christian-targeted psychological advice. His daily radio program &quot;Focus on the Family&quot; was (according to his organization) broadcast in more than a dozen languages and on over 7,000 stations worldwide, and reportedly heard daily by more than 220 million people in 164 countries.

During the 1960s and 70s effort to legalize abortion, journalism often reported the plight of women in need of abortion, such as Sherri Finkbine. Dobson, together with Francis Schaeffer and others, shifted the public conversation away from the suffering of women, toward the suffering of the fetus and the selfishness of women who seek abortion.

Through his books and broadcasts, Dobson sought to prepare parents to fight in the American culture wars, a conflict in which Dobson described that &quot;parents of faith are at war with culture&quot; and which he has labeled a &quot;Civil War of Values&quot;. Dobson has wielded significant influence over parents and politically conservative Christians, and, in the 1990s, a reportedly significant segment of this dedicated following were women who worked inside the home. 

Around two thousand radio stations aired Dobson&#x27;s program to an audience of six to ten million by the early 2000s. With over two million addresses on his mailing list, his organization launched a publishing house. Richard Land called him &quot;the most influential evangelical leader in America&quot; at that time, saying his influence was comparable to Billy Graham in the 1960s-70s.

He is a founder of purity culture, a nationwide chastity movement through which he significantly shaped American attitudes about sex and gender, and Alliance Defending Freedom. Dobson is a member of the Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood. He is a supporter of the Promise Keepers and was a contributor to their 1994 book &quot;The Seven Promises of a Promise Keeper&quot;.

===Political influence===

Dobson has chosen to exercise political influence behind the scenes, as &quot;political fixer.&quot; This helps him to maintain his credibility with his audience. He has never run for office or acted as the public head of a primarily political organization.

Starting in 1980, Dobson began to build a network of conservative activists. In 1981, he founded the Family Research Council as a political arm through which &quot;social conservative causes&quot; could achieve greater political influence. Dobson was appointed by U.S. President Ronald Reagan to the National Advisory Committee on Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention in 1982, where he served for two years. Through the 1980s, he coordinated the creation of Family Policy Councils in most US states, lobbying organizations that act on the level of state politics. 

By the 1990s, Dobson had amassed a sizeable network of conservative politicians, many of whom he met with regularly. Beginning in the same decade, Dobson and his vast activist organization helped pass state-level bans on gay marriage across the US. His top legislative goal was prohibiting gay marriage at the federal level, with a constitutional amendment. In 2005, he told his biographer &quot;my greatest concern is for the relentless attack by homosexual activists who are determined to destroy the institution of marriage.&quot;

Dobson was an ally of Judge Roy Moore starting in the early 1990s. He rallied his audience in support of the judge in 1997 and again in 2003 because of the Moore&#x27;s refusal to remove a Ten Commandments display from the Alabama Judicial Building. Viewing Moore as &quot;a man of proven character and integrity&quot; Dobson endorsed Moore&#x27;s political campaigns until 2017, when allegations came to light of Moore&#x27;s sexual misconduct toward teen girls.

In late 2004, Dobson led a campaign to block the appointment of Arlen Specter to head of the Senate Judiciary Committee because of Specter&#x27;s pro-abortion rights stance. Responding to a question by Fox News personality Alan Colmes on whether he wanted the Republican Party to be known as a &quot;big-tent party,&quot; he replied, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to be in the big tent ... I think the party ought to stand for something.&quot; In 2006, Focus on the Family spent more than a half million dollars to promote a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage in its home state of Colorado.

Dobson founded a fundraising and lobbying arm of FotF called Focus on the Family Action, now called Family Policy Alliance. As a 501(c)(4) organization, it faces fewer IRS restrictions on political activity than FotF. In the organization&#x27;s first six months of existence, it raised nearly nine million dollars in support of six Republican candidates for competitive US Senate seats. All six won their races.

A May 2005 article by Chris Hedges in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; described Dobson as &quot;perhaps the most powerful figure in the Dominionist movement&quot; and &quot;a crucial player in getting out the Christian vote for George W. Bush.&quot; Discernment Ministries, a site that describes dominionism as a heresy, characterized Dobson as belonging to the &quot;Patriotic American&quot; brand of dominionism, calling him &quot;One of its most powerful leaders.&quot;

In November 2004, Dobson was described by the online magazine &quot;Slate&quot; as &quot;America&#x27;s most influential evangelical leader.&quot; The article stated &quot;Forget Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson, who in their dotage have marginalized themselves with gaffes ... Dobson is now America&#x27;s most influential evangelical leader, with a following reportedly greater than that of either Falwell or Robertson at his peak ... Dobson may have delivered Bush his victories in Ohio and Florida.&quot; Further, &quot;He&#x27;s already leveraging his new power. When a thank-you call came from the White House, Dobson issued the staffer a blunt warning that Bush &quot;needs to be more aggressive&quot; about pressing the religious right&#x27;s anti-abortion, anti-gay rights agenda, or it would &quot;pay a price in four years&quot;. Dobson has sometimes complained that the Republican Party may take the votes of social conservatives for granted, and has suggested that evangelicals may withhold support from the GOP if the party does not more strongly support conservative family issues.

However, in 2006, Dobson said that, while &quot;there is disillusionment out there with Republicans&quot; and &quot;that worries me greatly,&quot; he nonetheless suggested voters turn out and vote Republican in 2006. &quot;My first inclination was to sit this one out,&quot; but according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Dobson then added that &quot;he had changed his mind when he looked at who would become the leaders of Congressional committees if the Democrats took over.&quot;

Dobson garnered national media attention once again in February 2008 after releasing a statement in the wake of Senator John McCain&#x27;s expected success in the so-called &quot;Super Tuesday&quot; Republican primary elections. In his statement, Dobson said: &quot;I cannot, and will not, vote for Senator John McCain, as a matter of conscience,&quot; and indicated that he would refrain from voting altogether if McCain were to become the Republican candidate, echoing other conservative commentators&#x27; concerns about the Senator&#x27;s conservatism. He endorsed Mike Huckabee for president. After McCain selected an anti-abortion candidate, Sarah Palin, as his running mate, Dobson said that he was more enthusiastic in his support for the Republican ticket. When Palin&#x27;s 17-year-old daughter&#x27;s pregnancy was revealed, Dobson issued a press release commending Palin&#x27;s stance, saying,

On June 24, 2008, Dobson criticized statements made by U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama in Obama&#x27;s 2006 &quot;Call to Renewal&quot; address. Dobson stated that Obama was &quot;distorting the traditional understanding of the Bible to fit his own world view.&quot; On October 23, 2008, Dobson published a &quot;Letter from 2012 in Obama&#x27;s America&quot; that proposed that an Obama presidency could lead to: mandated homosexual teachings across all schools; the banning of firearms in entire states; the end of the Boy Scouts, home schooling, Christian school groups, Christian adoption agencies, and talk radio; pornography on prime-time and daytime television; mandatory bonuses for gay soldiers; terrorist attacks across America; the nuclear bombing of Tel Aviv; the conquering of most of Eastern Europe by Russia; the end of health care for Americans over 80; out-of-control gasoline prices; and complete economic disaster in the United States, among other catastrophes. In the days after the 2008 presidential election, Dobson stated on his radio program that he was mourning the Obama election, claiming that Obama supported infanticide, would be responsible for the deaths of millions of unborn children, and was &quot;going to appoint the most liberal justices to the Supreme Court, perhaps, that we&#x27;ve ever had.&quot;

Dobson supports intelligent design and has spoken at conferences on the subject, and frequently criticizes evolution. In 2007, Dobson was one of 25 evangelicals who called for the ouster of Rev. Richard Cizik from his position at the National Association of Evangelicals because Cizik had taken a stance urging evangelicals to take global warming seriously.

On June 13, 2007, the National Right to Life Committee ousted Colorado Right to Life after the latter ran a full-page ad criticizing Dobson.

On May 30, 2010, Dobson delivered the pre-race invocation at the NASCAR Coca-Cola 600 automobile race, raising criticism about his association with a sport associated with sponsors and activities which would not meet his definition of family-friendly.

At a National Day of Prayer event in the U.S. Capitol, Dobson called Barack Obama &quot;the abortion president.&quot; He said, &quot;President Obama, before he was elected, made it very clear that he wanted to be the abortion president. He didn&#x27;t make any bones about it. This is something that he really was going to promote and support, and he has done that, and in a sense he is the abortion president.&quot; Among others, Rep. Janice Hahn complained because Dobson used the National Day of Prayer for partisan purposes. She said, &quot;Dobson just blew a hole into this idea of being a nonpartisan National Day of Prayer. It was very disturbing to me ... and really a shame. James Dobson hijacked the National Day of Prayer—this nonpartisan, nonpolitical National Day of Prayer—to promote his own distorted political agenda.&quot;

Dobson endorsed Ted Cruz in the 2016 Republican primaries as well as Trump in the general election against Hillary Clinton. In 2016, Dobson was named by &quot;Christianity Today&quot; as one of the Trump Administration&#x27;s top &quot;Evangelical Faith Advisers&quot;.

In 2020, Dobson worked alongside other conservative Evangelicals and Evangelical organizations, including Jim Daly and Focus on the Family, to support the reelection of President Donald Trump. He echoed his support of the President throughout the impeachment proceedings earlier that year.

Dobson praised the 2022 U.S. Supreme Court case &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot;, which overruled &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; and &quot;Planned Parenthood v. Casey&quot;, saying, &quot;Praise God! We have just received the news for which we have been praying and working!&quot;

==Ecumenical relations==
Dobson and Charles Colson were two participants in a 2000 conference at the Vatican on the global economy&#x27;s impact on families. During the conference, the two Protestants met with Pope John Paul II. Dobson later told Catholic News Service that though he has theological differences with Roman Catholicism, &quot;when it comes to the family, there is far more agreement than disagreement, and with regard to moral issues from abortion to premarital sex, safe-sex ideology and homosexuality, I find more in common with Catholics than with some of my evangelical brothers and sisters.&quot;

In November 2009, Dobson signed an ecumenical statement known as the &quot;Manhattan Declaration&quot; calling on evangelicals, Catholics and Eastern Orthodox Christians not to comply with rules and laws permitting abortion, same-sex marriage and other matters that go against their religious consciences.

==Criticism==

U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, a fellow evangelical Christian who wanted Dobson as an ally in his battle against the AIDS crisis, was deeply disappointed when Dobson embraced pseudoscientific and homophobic claims about AIDS. &quot;The Christian activity in reference to AIDS of both D. James Kennedy and Jim Dobson is reprehensible,&quot; Koop said in 1989. He viewed the AIDS crisis as &quot;an opportunity for Christian service&quot; that Dobson was squandering.

In her 2020 book &quot;Jesus and John Wayne&quot;, Calvin University professor Kristin Kobes Du Mez criticizes the ideal of Christian masculinity created by Dobson, Mark Driscoll and others: &quot;It was a vision that promised protection for women but left women without defense, one that worshiped power and turned a blind eye to justice, and one that transformed the Jesus of the Gospels into an image of their own making.&quot;

Don Jacobson, who published books by Dobson and other conservative Christian authors at his Multnomah Press, later rejected the Christian nationalism his press had helped cultivate. After reading historical Christian justifications for murder and conquest of American Indians, he came to view American exceptionalism as incompatible with Christian love.

Gil Alexander-Moegerle, a former Focus on the Family executive and radio show co-host, wrote the highly critical book &quot;James Dobson&#x27;s War on America&quot; in 1997. In it, he says that Dobson&#x27;s loving, caring public persona is a sham; the real Dobson is racist, sexist, homophobic, materialistic, power-hungry, and shameless. He says that the Nazarene religious concept of entire sanctification is key to understanding Dobson&#x27;s views: &quot;James Dobson believes that he has been entirely sanctified, morally perfected, that he does not and cannot sin. Now you know why he and moralists like him make a life of condemning what he believes to be the sins of others. He is perfect.&quot;

Some fundamentalist Christians consider Dobson a heretic for presenting secular concepts from psychology and self-help literature as though they are justified by the Bible.

Theologian Donald Eric Capps contends that Dobson&#x27;s corporal punishment techniques exploit children by turning their natural need to be loved against them. Dobson&#x27;s advice to &quot;break the will&quot; of the child is a recipe for child abuse, according to Capps, and is antithetical to loving one&#x27;s child. He also argues that corporal punishment may sexualize children. For evidence of this, he points to Dobson&#x27;s vivid childhood recollection of being beaten with his mother&#x27;s girdle. Capps believed that using physical pain to heighten a child&#x27;s relationship to God is &quot;perverted.&quot;

<text>Super 8 mm film is a motion-picture film format released in 1965 by Eastman Kodak as an improvement over the older &quot;Double&quot; or &quot;Regular&quot; 8 mm home movie format. The formal name for Super 8 is 8-mm Type S, distinguishing it from the older double-8 format, which is called 8-mm Type R. Unlike Super 35 (which is generally compatible with standard 35 mm equipment), the film stock used for Super 8 is not compatible with standard 8 mm film cameras.

The film is nominally 8 mm wide, the same as older formatted 8 mm film, but the dimensions of the rectangular sprocket hole perforations along one edge are smaller, which allows for a larger image area. The Super 8 standard also allocates the border opposite the perforations for an oxide stripe upon which sound can be magnetically recorded.

Fujifilm released a competing system named Single-8, also in 1965, which used the same film, image frame, and perforation dimensions, but with a different film base and incompatible cartridge format. The Kodak Super 8 system was adopted by more manufacturers and proved to be the more popular home movie format until it was displaced by video camera and recorder systems.

== Super 8 System ==

Starting in 1963, Kodak privately invited manufacturers of home movie equipment to inform them about a new 8 mm format under development. After Bell &amp; Howell learned about it, they began developing cameras and projectors as the &quot;Earlybird&quot; project, despite incomplete details about the cartridge and film size.

Launched in May 1965 by Eastman Kodak at that year&#x27;s International Photo Exposition, held simultaneously with the ongoing 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair, Super 8 film comes in plastic light-proof cartridges containing coaxial supply and take-up spools loaded with of film, with 72 frames per foot, for a nominal total of 3600 frames per film cartridge. This is enough film for 2.5 minutes at the professional motion picture standard of 24 frames per second, and for  minutes of continuous filming at 18 frames per second (upgraded from the 16 frames per second rate of standard 8 mm) for amateur use. 

In 1973, the system was supplemented with a larger cartridge, containing mag stripe film, which allowed sound cameras to record monaural sync-sound audio on the main strip. In 1975, an even larger cartridge became available, which could be used in specifically designed cameras. The sound and the 200-foot cartridge system are no longer available, but the 50-foot silent cartridge system is still manufactured.

Historically, Super 8 film was a reversal stock for home projection used primarily for the creation of home movies. It became an extremely popular consumer product in the late 1960s through the 1970s, but was largely replaced in the 1980s by the use of video tape. 

During the mid-to-late 1980s Super 8 began to re-emerge as an alternative method for movie production, beginning with its use in MTV music videos in 1981. In 1993, the company Super8 Sound, now called Pro8mm, pioneered the use of the color negative in Super 8 by custom perforating and loading a variety of 35 mm film stocks into the Super 8 film cartridge. This included emulsions from Kodak, Fuji and Ilford. Today Super 8 color negative film is the main color stock used. There are also Super 8 reversal films available, including 100D Kodak Ektachrome and 200D Agfa color, as well as black-and-white (B&amp;W) from Foma, ADOX, ORWO and Kodak.

===Design===

Super 8 film and frame dimensions are specified by standards published by ANSI/SMPTE and ISO, including ISO 1700 and 3645; and ANSI/SMPTE ST 149 (superseding ANSI PH22.149) and ANSI/SMPTE ST 157 (superseding ANSI PH22.156M and PH22.157).


The standard Super 8 cartridge is a rectangular box approximately and contains 50 feet of film.

The Super 8 plastic cartridge is probably the fastest loading film system ever developed, as it can be loaded into the Super 8 camera in less than two seconds without the need to directly thread or touch the film. In addition, coded notches cut into the Super 8 film cartridge exterior allow the camera to recognize the film speed automatically. Not all cameras can read all the notches correctly, however, and there is some debate about which notches actually deliver the best results. Canon keeps an exhaustive list of their Super 8 cameras with detailed specifications on what film speeds can be used with their cameras. Usually, testing one cartridge of film can help settle any uncertainty a filmmaker may have about how well their Super 8 camera reads different film stocks. Color stocks were originally available only in tungsten (3400 K) Type A, and almost all Super 8 cameras come with a switchable daylight filter built in, allowing for both indoor and outdoor shooting.
The original Super 8 film release was a silent system only, but in 1973, a sound on film version was released. The film with sound had a magnetic soundtrack and came in larger cartridges than the original cartridge in order to accommodate the sound recording head in the film path. Sound film requires a longer film path (for smoothing the film movement before it reaches the recording head) and a second aperture for the recording head. Sound cameras are compatible with silent cartridges, but not conversely. Sound film is typically filmed at a speed of 18 or 24 frames per second. Kodak discontinued the production of Super 8 sound film in 1997, citing environmental regulations, as the adhesive used to bond the magnetic track to the film is environmentally hazardous.

Kodak introduced a Super 8 cartridge with magnetic sound in 1974; the accompanying Supermatic 200 camera was identical to its existing Ektasound camera, but included a door which allowed the extended reels to extend through the top.

===Current use===

In 2005, Kodak announced the discontinuation of their most popular stock Kodachrome due to the decline of facilities equipped with the K-14 developing process. Kodachrome was &quot;replaced&quot; by a new ISO 64 Ektachrome, which uses the simpler E-6 process. The last roll of Kodachrome was processed on January 18, 2011, in Parsons, Kansas, by the sole remaining lab capable of processing it. 

In December 2012, Kodak discontinued color reversal stock in all formats, including 35 mm and Super 8. However, in Spring of 2019, Kodak introduced Ektachrome 100D in super 8 and 16 mm formats, citing surges in demand.
Today, there are still a variety of Super 8 film stocks. Kodak sells one Super 8 color reversal stock, Ektachrome 100D, and three Super 8 color negative stocks cut from their Vision 3 film series, ISO 50, ISO 200 and ISO 500, which can be used in very low light. Kodak reformulated the emulsions for the B&amp;W reversal stocks and made Tri-X (ISO 200).

Film cut to Super 8 from other manufactured raw stock such as Fuji, Orwo, Adox, Agfa and Foma are also available. Pro8mm offers 7 color negative stocks made from Kodak and Fuji film. Color Reversal film for Super 8 is still available from several Super 8 specialty companies. Wittner Kinotechnik offers Super 8 made from a batch of Agfa Aviphot 200D, which is perforated and slit for Super 8, 8 mm and 16 mm formats. This film is loaded into Super 8 and Single cartridges by several of the specialty companies. Other stocks, such as the new Fuji reversal film, and existing supplies of Kodak 35 mm 100D are often made available in Super 8 by these specialty companies.


The growing popularity and availability of non-linear editing systems has allowed film-makers and any user of film to shoot Super 8 film but edit in digital. This avoids much of the tedium of handling film and the damage to the film, which can occur when editing the actual film. Super 8 films may be transferred (scanned) to digital and then imported into computer-based editing and correction systems for post production. Today&#x27;s systems can scan Super 8 to 4K digital in a variety of formats.

==Competitors==
=== Fujifilm Single-8 system ===

Fujifilm of Japan developed an alternative format called Single-8, which was released in 1965 as a different option to the Kodak Super 8 format, using a separate set of standards as &quot;8 mm Type S Model II&quot;.

Single-8 cartridges are of a different design from a Super 8 cartridge. Where Super 8 uses coaxial supply and take-up reels, Single-8 uses coplanar reels, resembling a cassette-style design where the supply and take-up reels are side by side. In addition, the pressure plate to flatten the Single-8 film is in the camera, rather than the cartridge (Super 8). Single-8 also uses a stronger polyester base, the thickness of the acetate base of Super 8 film. Therefore, Single-8 film cartridges can only be used in Single-8 cameras. However, since Single-8 film has exactly the same image frame and perforation dimensions as Super 8, it can be viewed in any Super 8 projector after processing. Fuji recommended that only tape splices be used when combining Single-8 footage with Super-8, as standard film cement would not adhere to the Single-8 footage. Also, when jammed, Single-8 footage has a tendency to stretch in the projector, unlike the acetate-based Super-8 film, which simply breaks.

Although never as popular as Super 8, the format existed in parallel. On June 2, 2009, Fuji announced the end of Single-8 motion picture film. Tungsten balanced 200 ASA Fuji RT200N ceased to be manufactured by May 2010. Daylight balanced 25 ASA Fujichrome R25N remained available until March 2012. Fuji&#x27;s in-house processing service was available until September 2013.

=== Polaroid Polavision ===

An instant 8 mm film released in 1977 by Polaroid, Polavision uses the same perforations as Super 8 mm film. It can be projected through a Super 8 mm projector if the film is transferred from the original cartridge to an 8 mm reel. However, because of the additive color process, the picture will be much darker.

== Super 8 derivative formats ==
=== Double Super 8 ===
Double Super 8 film (commonly abbreviated as DS8 or DS 8) is a 16 mm wide film but has Super 8 size sprockets.

;Double Super 8 for amateurs:
In amateur DS8 cameras, the film is used in the same way as standard 8 mm film in that the film is run through the camera twice, exposing one side on each pass. During processing, the film is split down the middle, and the two pieces spliced together to produce a single strip for projection in a Super 8 projector.

The advantages of this system are the possibility of higher frame rates and rewinding film for double exposures or crossfades, which were very difficult or impossible with the super 8 film cartridges but possible with cameras using film spools. Since the film doesn&#x27;t follow a diagonal path through the stacked spools of the super 8 cassette, the pin-registration of DS8 is considered to be superior to that of Super 8 film, and so picture stability is better.

Also, camera manufacturers could use models already in production for double 8 mm film by enlarging the gate and slightly modifying the advancement mechanism for the use with Double Super 8 film (see comparison pictures in this segment).

;Double Super 8 for film-makers:
DS8 can also be used as an alternative film stock in modified 16 mm cameras and projectors, which allows for larger image sizes due to the narrower super 8 sprockets. Some of the formats taking advantage of this are Max DS8 and Ultra DS8.

=== Widescreen Super8 and Max8 ===
As Super 8 progressed to be used in HD and theatrical applications, a need arose for widescreen compatibility without having to use expensive optical adapters or excessive cropping. Since magnetic sound-striped film was no longer available, that area of the film could be used to expand the picture aspect ratio in a process similar to the creation of Super 16 from standard 16 mm film. The creators of Sleep Always experimented with widening the camera gate to expose into the sound track region to achieve this.

In March 2005, Pro8mm introduced its own version of the widened gate, achieving aspect ratio of 1.58 and calling it Max8. Because top and bottom of the frame are meant to be cropped to achieve final 16:9 aspect ratio, the viewfinder is modified to show 16:9 frame markings. Pro8mm claims that shooting with Max8 and then cropping it to achieve 16:9 provides 20% increase in the size of the negative compared to regular Super8 cropped to 16:9.

In 2015, Logmar of Denmark made a one-off batch of 50 &quot;digicanical&quot; pro-level Super 8 cameras to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Super 8. These cameras use a widened gate as well, providing an 11% increase in imaging area over the standard Super 8 frame and achieving aspect ratio of 1.5.

In 2016, Eastman Kodak showed a concept for a new Super 8 camera, its first such camera in over 30 years. Although Kodak has neither confirmed nor denied it, Logmar is said to have assisted in the design of the transport and the camera&#x27;s firmware. A working prototype was displayed at the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show, with Kodak hoping to begin production in spring 2017. However, nothing has been heard from Kodak concerning the camera, until 8 years later, on 22 November 2023, Kodak formally released the Super 8 camera for pre-order, confirmed its analog and digital-assist hybrid features, and 1.5:1 aspect ratio &quot;Expanded Super 8 Gate&quot; aperture feature. The camera is expected to be shipped around Q1 2024.
==Equipment and film==
===Equipment===
Although Kodak launched Super 8 and had its own cameras, hundreds of other companies produced Super 8 camera, projection, editing, and sound equipment. Some of the more notable companies that made Super 8 equipment include: Canon, Bauer, Nizo, Super8 Sound (Pro8mm), Beaulieu, Leicina, Logmar, Ciro, Bolex, Goko, Hahnel, Wurker, Minolta, Minnette, Nikon. Most of these companies had long histories in the production of motion-picture equipment, dating back to the 1930s with 8 mm. In 1980, the consumer market for Super 8 collapsed. Most of the independent companies were forced into bankruptcy or merged, as the demand for Super 8 evaporated overnight. Some companies remained in business until 1985, when many gave up completely on movie-film equipment. A few later re-emerged, including Beaulieu, who, in 1985, introduced a new 7008 camera and Super 8 Sound that introduced a new version of its full-coat recorder, the Mag IV. The companies in which Super 8 was only a division simply closed. Kodak continued support for Super 8. A few products re-emerged with new features such as crystal sync and Max8. Several Canon models have also started to reappear as restoration efforts like the RhondaCam. Recently, new companies have started producing new Super 8 cameras. In 2015, Logmar introduced a limited-edition completely new Super 8 camera, and in 2016, Kodak showed a concept of a new Super 8 camera at the 2016 CES expo. There are literally millions of Super 8 cameras that are still available and viable because of manufacturing methods back in the 1960s and 1970s. These cameras can be found at specialized retailers and distributors and at auction sites such as eBay.

===Film stock===
Kodak currently offers one color reversal stock, Ektachrome 100D, three of its latest Vision 3 color negative stock, the 50D, 200T, and 500T, and Tri-X B&amp;W reversal film in the Super 8 format. Several Super 8 specialty companies such as Pro8mm in Burbank CA, Wittner Cinetec in Hamburg, Germany, and Kahlfilm in Brühl, Germany, slit and perforate raw 35 mm film stock from Kodak, Fuji, ORWO, Agfa, and Foma and then repackage it in Kodak Super 8 cartridges. Adox has its own B&amp;W film supply and provides this in its own Super 8 cartridge design by GKfilmCinevia. Retro 8 of Japan provides a similar service for Super 8 film in the Fuji Cartridge (Single8). There are now more varieties of Super 8 film available than ever before.

In 2017, Kodak announced that Ektachrome will soon be available again in the Super 8 format. In Spring of 2019, Kodak officially released Ektachrome 100D in Super 8 and 16 mm formats.

Super 8 film is available worldwide through specialty shops and online from major companies such as Amazon. It has become common to see it sold with processing prepaid and for it to be sold with scan-to-digital services at a variety of different levels from standard-definition digital to 4K data. It can even be purchased to include all the logistic associated with the process, including film processing, scanning and internet delivery of image and mail in and back services. This is a sample video done with the Super 8 film kit.

==Sound==

In the beginning of 1965, Super 8 was introduced as a silent format. Over time, several companies began to offer sync sound options for Super 8 filmmaking. Two companies introduced comprehensive sound systems for Super 8. These were Super8 Sound Inc. led by Harvard film professor Bob Doyle and Optasound led by Richard Leacock at MIT. With double system, as it was called, sound and picture are recorded separately. This was fine for more professional applications and for education about film production, but for consumers it was simply too complex and expensive.

In 1973 Kodak introduced Ektasound—magnetic recording on the actual Super 8 film. The sound track was added on the edge of the film opposite to the perforations. Standard 8mm had the stripe between the perforations and the edge of the film which made good contact with a magnetic head problematic. A balance stripe was added on the opposite edge to facilitate spooling of the film. The Ektasound cartridge was deeper than the silent cartridge to allow access of the camera&#x27;s recording head. Thus, silent cameras could not accept Ektasound cartridges, but Ektasound cameras and projectors accepted silent cartridges. Projectors, that could record and play sound, appeared before sound cameras. The sound was recorded 18 frames in advance of the picture (as opposed to 56 frames for standard 8mm). This short distance of just 3 inches facilitated the relatively compact size of the later sound cartridges. Some projectors used the balance stripe to provide a second channel for stereo sound.

Super 8mm was also specified with an optical sound track. This occupied the same location as the magnetic track. Picture to sound separation in this format was 22 frames. Projectors and cameras obviously could not record sound in this system, but optical sound package movies became briefly popular, particularly in Europe (mainly because they were cheaper to produce - though the projectors cost more). Although the optical sound should have been inferior in quality to magnetic sound (running at 3.6 inches per second for 24 frames per second), in practice it was often much better, largely because packaged movie magnetic sound was often poorly recorded.

==Packaged movies==
Although the 8mm format was originally intended for creating amateur films, condensed versions of popular cinema releases were available from the 1940s (in the Standard 8 format) until the mid-1980s, for projection at home. These were scenes from feature-length films generally edited to fit onto a reel that ran 8–9 minutes. Also popular were theatrical cartoons which could fit on the 200-foot reels without being edited. The 200-foot editions in black and white and silent were widely available and often sold in department stores such as Woolco in the $5.00-6.00 price range in the 1960s and 1970s. The leading companies releasing such films were Castle Films, owned by Universal Pictures and Ken Films, which licensed titles from 20th Century-Fox and other studios. The Walt Disney Studio released excerpts from many of their animated feature films in the 1970s, as well as some short subjects.

Releases in color and with sound began appearing in the 1970s and by the end of the decade, demand for longer condensations resulted in reels being released, running approximately 16–18 minutes, sometimes with a second &quot;part II&quot; 400&#x27;. The list price for the sound color films in 1980 were $39.95 for a single 200&#x27; film and $59.95 for a single 400&#x27; film, though most sellers sold them at a reduced price. The Walt Disney Studio, however, kept their releases at the 200-foot limit. Columbia Pictures, which had operated an 8mm division since the early 1960s, enjoyed success with a &quot;Viewer&#x27;s Digest&quot; series of 400&#x27; feature condensations and complete prints of their Three Stooges short comedies.

Vintage silent films starring Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Mary Pickford, Rudolph Valentino, Lillian Gish, and other legends were available from companies specializing in them such as Blackhawk Films and included both short films and multi-reel complete feature-length movies. Full-length sound films, particularly those in color, were seldom released due to the fairly expensive price of such films although a small number were released by such companies as Viacom featuring stars with wide popularity such as John Wayne, Elvis Presley, and Katharine Hepburn. Blackhawk, which held the 8mm and 16mm rights to the Laurel and Hardy classics produced by Hal Roach, offered both their short comedies and complete features in black-and-white sound prints. Most sound films that were released complete on Super 8 with multi reels were usually public domain titles such as &quot;My Man Godfrey&quot; (1936), &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot; (1934) and &quot;His Girl Friday&quot; (1940), and sold by smaller companies such as Thunderbird and Niles.

The emergence of home video and the increasing available of cable television dramatically decreased the market for Super 8 films in America in the early 1980s which led to a quick fadeout in availability, although the format remained quite popular in England into the early years of the 21st century with Derann films releasing full-length versions of many Disney films and vintage Hollywood musicals.

== In-flight movies ==
Starting in 1971 in-flight movies (previously 16 mm) were shown in Super 8 format until video distribution became the norm and they were replaced by Video8 and later on, digital video. The films were printed with an optical sound track (amateur films use magnetic sound), and spooled into proprietary cassettes that often held an entire two-hour movie.

== Popularity ==
Super 8 was most widely used for filming home movies. Some lower-budget television stations used Super 8 to film news stories. Today amateur usage of Super 8 has been replaced by digital, but the format is still regularly used by artists and students. Some seek to imitate the look of old home movies, or create a stylishly grainy look. Others want to create alternative looks for flashback sequences and altered states of consciousness. Some just like the idea of creating images in the classic style of using actual film. Super 8 is a relatively inexpensive film, making it popular among filmmakers working on a low budget who still want to achieve the classic look of real film.

Super 8 has been used in theatrical features, usually for creative effect. Oliver Stone, for example, has used it in films such as &quot;JFK&quot;, where his director of photography Robert Richardson employed it to evoke a period or to give a different look to scenes. The PBS series &quot;Globe Trekker&quot; uses approximately five minutes of Super 8 footage per episode. In the UK, broadcasters such as the BBC still occasionally make use of Super 8 in both drama and documentary contexts.

Thanks to over a dozen film stocks, the ease of function and finding a camera, and the ability to do high quality digital scanning to standard motion picture digital formats like 2K and 4K, DPX or ProRes 4444, Super 8 remains a popular format for creating a variety of interesting scenes. Super 8 provides an ideal, inexpensive medium for traditional stop-motion and cel animation and other types of filming speed effects not common to video cameras.

== Film festivals ==
To give further support to filmmakers dedicated to shooting on Super 8 mm film, many film festivals and screenings—such as the Flicker Film Festival, and Super Gr8 Film Festival—exist to give filmmakers a place to screen their Super 8 mm films. Many of these screenings shun video and are only open to films shot on film. Some require film to be turned in undeveloped and thus not permitting any editing, providing an additional challenge to the filmmaker. These include the Bentley Film Festival and straight 8, which runs screenings at the Cannes Film Festival and many other festivals and events worldwide, where a sound track is required to be supplied with a completed but unprocessed cartridge. In the 2005 Cannes Film Festival, a Super 8 short film (&quot;The Man Who Met Himself&quot;) by British filmmaker Ben Crowe, shot on the now discontinued Kodachrome 40 format, was the first Super 8 film to be nominated for the Short Film Palme d&#x27;Or in the Official Selection.

In the UK, the Cambridge International Super 8 Film Festival, with the support of the film industry, runs a competition program of more than 60 films every year. The festival also features work of Super 8 filmmakers, industry talks, and a workshop.

The United States Super 8mm Film + Digital Video Festival, established in 1988, takes place annually at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey and is the longest running Super 8mm festival in the US.

In Brazil Curta8 | Festival Internacional de Cinema Super8 is in its 11th year.

A number of experimental filmmakers, such as Mason Shefa and Stan Brakhage, continue to work extensively in the format and festivals such as the Images Festival (Toronto), the Media City Film Festival (Windsor, Ont.), and TIE (based in Colorado) regularly project Super 8 films as part of their programming.

In June 2010, the Super8 Shots film festival was launched in Galway, Ireland, the first Super 8 festival to occur in Ireland, and included classes on basics and uses of film through to processing your own film.

Chicago 8: A Small Gauge Film Festival started in 2011, and will feature yearly programming of small gauge film from around the world.

== Educational use ==

Super 8 can still be found at a few select higher educational institutions offering film production courses including the program at Chaffey College in Southern California. It is more common to find Super 8 film in art programs. These programs use the analog experience of film for its own creative potential rather than use Super 8 to teach traditional modern production methods. Art programs on many levels, such as this program put on in Santa Clarita California at ArtTree for students aged 10 to 15, teach the basic nature of film. Other programs such as &quot;Do A Shot&quot; sponsored by Pro8mm and Kodak give individuals a chance to experience film by lending film and cameras to a select group at film festivals and trade events like this film festival at The Art Center College of Art &amp; Design.

Several post-secondary institutions in the United States continue to utilize Super 8 in Film and Cinema programs. For example, both City College of San Francisco&#x27;s Cinema Department and the University of North Texas&#x27; Radio, Television and Film Department require the use of Super 8.

This experience provides students with the basics of film production and editing. Importantly, it also emphasizes the need for detailed pre-production planning, especially for in-camera edits. Further, the use of Super 8 leads students into the Regular 16 and Super 16 films shot in higher-level courses.

==In popular culture==
Australian band TISM references Super-8 in their song Neighbours – Everybody Loves Good Neighbours in a way that suggests using Super-8 is more artistic than video.

The plot of the 2011 film &quot;Super 8&quot; involves a group of teenagers in the fictional Ohio town of Lillian filming their own Super 8 movie depicting their experience with a landlocked alien in the summer of 1979. One of the cameras featured in the film is a Kodak Ektasound 130 movie camera produced and sold by Kodak in the early 1970s.

The 2012 film &quot;Sinister&quot; contains Super 8 shots used to depict the various gruesome murders.

<doc id="46233" wikidata="Q363729" url="?curid=46233" title="Siegfried Sassoon">
<text>Siegfried Loraine Sassoon (8 September 1886 – 1 September 1967) was an English war poet, writer, and soldier. Decorated for bravery on the Western Front, he became one of the leading poets of the First World War. His poetry both described the horrors of the trenches and satirized the patriotic pretensions of those who, in Sassoon&#x27;s view, were responsible for a jingoism-fuelled war. Sassoon became a focal point for dissent within the armed forces when he made a lone protest against the continuation of the war with his &quot;Soldier&#x27;s Declaration&quot; of July 1917, which resulted in his being sent to the Craiglockhart War Hospital. During this period, Sassoon met and formed a friendship with Wilfred Owen, who was greatly influenced by him. Sassoon later won acclaim for his prose work, notably his three-volume, fictionalised autobiography, collectively known as the Sherston trilogy.

==Early life==

Siegfried Sassoon was born to a Jewish father and an Anglo-Catholic mother, and grew up in the neo-gothic mansion named Weirleigh (after its builder Harrison Weir) in Matfield, Kent. His father, Alfred Ezra Sassoon (1861–1895), son of Sassoon David Sassoon, was a member of the wealthy Baghdadi Jewish Sassoon merchant family. Siegfried&#x27;s mother, Theresa, belonged to the Thornycroft family, sculptors responsible for many of the best-known statues in London; among them her brother, Sir Hamo Thornycroft.

There was no German ancestry in Sassoon&#x27;s family; his mother named him Siegfried because of her love of Wagner&#x27;s operas. His middle name, Loraine, was the surname of a clergyman she respected.

Siegfried was the second of three sons, the others being Michael and Hamo. When he was four years old his parents separated. During his father&#x27;s weekly visits to the boys, Theresa locked herself in the drawing-room. In 1895, Alfred Sassoon died of tuberculosis.

Sassoon was educated at the New Beacon School, Sevenoaks, Kent; at Marlborough College, Wiltshire; and at Clare College, Cambridge, where from 1905 to 1907 he read history. He left Cambridge without a degree and spent the years after 1907 hunting, playing cricket and writing verse, some of which he published privately.

Although his father had been disinherited from the Sassoon fortune for marrying a woman who was not Jewish, Siegfried had a small private income that allowed him to live modestly without having to earn a living. Later, he was left a large legacy by an aunt, Rachel Beer, allowing him to buy the great estate of Heytesbury House in Wiltshire.

His first published success, &quot;The Daffodil Murderer&quot; (1913), was a parody of John Masefield&#x27;s &quot;The Everlasting Mercy&quot;. Robert Graves, in &quot;Good-Bye to All That&quot;, describes it as a &quot;parody of Masefield which, midway through, had forgotten to be a parody and turned into rather good Masefield.&quot;

=== Cricket ===
Sassoon played for his village cricket team at a young age, and his brothers and three of his tutors were cricket enthusiasts. The Marchant family were neighbouring landowners, and Frank Marchant was captain of the county side between 1890 and 1897. Sassoon played for his house at Marlborough, once taking 7 wickets for 18 runs, and during this time he contributed three poems to &quot;Cricket&quot; magazine.

For some years around 1910 he often played for Bluemantles Cricket Club, at the Nevill Ground, in Tunbridge Wells, sometimes alongside Arthur Conan Doyle. He later played for a Downside Abbey team called &quot;The Ravens&quot;, continuing playing well into his seventies.

==War service==

===The Western Front: Military Cross===

Sassoon joined the Army just as the threat of a new European war was recognized, and was in service with the Sussex Yeomanry on 4 August 1914, the day the United Kingdom declared war on Germany. He broke his arm badly in a riding accident and was put out of action before leaving England, spending the spring of 1915 convalescing. He was commissioned into the 3rd Battalion (Special Reserve), Royal Welch Fusiliers, as a second lieutenant on 29 May 1915.

On 1 November, his younger brother Hamo was killed in the Gallipoli Campaign, dying on board the ship after having had his leg amputated. In the same month, Siegfried was sent to the 1st Battalion, Royal Welch Fusiliers, in France, where he met Robert Graves, and they became close friends. United by their poetic vocation, they often read and discussed each other&#x27;s work. Though this did not have much perceptible influence on Graves&#x27; poetry, Grave&#x27;s views on what may be called &quot;gritty realism&quot; profoundly affected Sassoon&#x27;s concept of what constituted poetry.

He soon became horrified by the realities of war, and the tone of his writing changed completely: where his early poems exhibit a Romantic, dilettantish sweetness, his war poetry moves to an increasingly discordant music, intended to convey the ugly truths of the trenches to an audience hitherto lulled by patriotic propaganda. Details such as rotting corpses, mangled limbs, filth, cowardice and suicide are all trademarks of his work at this time, and this philosophy of &quot;no truth unfitting&quot; had a significant effect on the movement towards Modernist poetry.

Sassoon&#x27;s periods of duty on the Western Front were marked by exceptionally brave actions, including the single-handed capture of a German trench. Armed with grenades, he scattered sixty German soldiers:Sassoon&#x27;s bravery was so inspiring that soldiers of his company said that they felt confident only when they were accompanied by him. He often went out on night raids and bombing patrols, and demonstrated ruthless efficiency as a company commander.

Deepening depression at the horror and misery the soldiers were forced to endure produced in Sassoon a paradoxically manic courage, and he was nicknamed &quot;Mad Jack&quot; by his men for his near-suicidal exploits. On 27 July 1916 he was awarded the Military Cross; the citation read:

Robert Graves described Sassoon as engaging in suicidal feats of bravery. Sassoon was also later recommended for the Victoria Cross.

===War opposition and Craiglockhart===
Despite his decorations and reputation, in 1917 Sassoon decided to make a stand against the conduct of the war. One of the reasons for his violent anti-war feeling was the death of his friend David Cuthbert Thomas, who appears as &quot;Dick Tiltwood&quot; in the Sherston trilogy. Sassoon spent years trying to overcome his grief.

In August 1916, Sassoon arrived at Somerville College, Oxford, which was used as a hospital for convalescing officers, with a case of gastric fever. He wrote: &quot;To be lying in a little white-walled room, looking through the window on to a College lawn, was for the first few days very much like a paradise&quot;. Graves ended up at Somerville as well. &quot;How unlike you to crib my idea of going to the Ladies&#x27; College at Oxford&quot;, Sassoon wrote to him in 1917.

At the end of a spell of convalescent leave, Sassoon declined to return to duty; encouraged by pacifist friends such as Bertrand Russell and Lady Ottoline Morrell, he sent a letter to his commanding officer titled &quot;&quot;. Forwarded to the press and read aloud in the House of Commons by a sympathetic member of Parliament, the letter was seen by some as treasonous (&quot;I am making this statement as an act of willful defiance of military authority&quot;) or at best as condemning the war government&#x27;s motives (&quot;I believe that the war upon which I entered as a war of defence and liberation has now become a war of aggression and conquest&quot;).

Rather than court-martial Sassoon, the Under-Secretary of State for War, Ian Macpherson, decided that he was unfit for service and had him sent to Craiglockhart War Hospital near Edinburgh, where he officially was treated for neurasthenia (&quot;shell shock&quot;).

At the end of 1917, Sassoon was posted to Limerick, Ireland, where in the New Barracks he helped train new recruits. He wrote that it was a period of respite for him, and allowed him to indulge in his love of hunting. Reflecting on the period years later, he mentioned how trouble was brewing in Ireland at the time, in the few years before the Irish War of Independence. After only a short period in Limerick he was posted to Egypt.

Before declining to return to active service, Sassoon had thrown his MC ribbon into the sea at Formby beach; some people misinterpreted his description of this incident in &quot;Memoirs of an Infantry Officer&quot; and believed that he had thrown the medal itself away, but this was retained and passed into the care of his family. He stated that he did not do this as a symbolic rejection of militaristic values, but simply out of the need to perform some destructive act as catharsis. His account states that one of his pre-war sporting trophies, had he had one to hand, would have served his purpose equally well. The actual decoration was rediscovered after the death of Sassoon&#x27;s only son, George, and subsequently became the subject of a dispute among Sassoon&#x27;s heirs.

At Craiglockhart, Sassoon met Wilfred Owen, another poet. It was thanks to Sassoon that Owen persevered in his ambition to write better poetry. A manuscript copy of Owen&#x27;s &quot;Anthem for Doomed Youth&quot; containing Sassoon&#x27;s handwritten amendments survives as testimony to the extent of his influence and is currently on display at London&#x27;s Imperial War Museum.

Sassoon became to Owen &quot;Keats and Christ and Elijah&quot;, according to a surviving letter which demonstrates the depth of Owen&#x27;s love and admiration for him. Both men returned to active service in France, but Owen was killed in 1918, a week before Armistice. Sassoon was promoted to lieutenant, and, having spent some time in Palestine, eventually returned to France by 20 June 1918.

Sassoon was wounded again on 13 July 1918—reportedly by friendly fire when he was injured by a shot to the head by a fellow British soldier who had apparently mistaken him for a German, near Arras, France (per a 2018 story published by a British online tabloid, it was suggested that the friendly fire incident was not accidental, however the veracity of this claim is in some question). As a result of this injury, he spent the remainder of the war in Britain. By this time, he had been promoted to acting captain. He relinquished his commission on health grounds on 12 March 1919, but retained the rank of captain.

After the war, Sassoon was instrumental in bringing Owen&#x27;s work to the attention of a wider audience. Their relationship is the subject of Stephen MacDonald&#x27;s play &quot;Not About Heroes&quot;.

==Post-war life==
===Editor and novelist===
Having lived for a period at Oxford, where he spent more time visiting literary friends than studying, Sassoon dabbled briefly in the politics of the Labour movement. In November 1918, he travelled to Blackburn to support the Labour candidate in the general election, Philip Snowden, who had been a pacifist during the war.

Though a self-confessed political novice, Sassoon delivered campaign speeches for Snowden, later writing that he &#x27;felt grateful for [Snowden&#x27;s] anti-war attitude in parliament, and had been angered by the abuse thrown at him. All my political sympathies were with him.&#x27;

While his commitment to politics waned after this, he remained a supporter of the Labour Party, and in 1929 &#x27;rejoiced that [they] had gained seats in the British general election.&#x27; Similarly, &#x27;news of the massive Labour victory in 1945 pleased him, because many Tories from the class he had loathed during the First World War had gone.&#x27;

In 1919 Sassoon took up a post as literary editor of the socialist &quot;Daily Herald&quot;. He lived at 54 Tufton Street, Westminster, from 1919 to 1925; the house is no longer standing, but the location of his former home is marked by a memorial plaque.

During his period at the &quot;Herald&quot;, Sassoon was responsible for employing several eminent names as reviewers, including E. M. Forster and Charlotte Mew, and commissioned original material from writers like Arnold Bennett and Osbert Sitwell. His artistic interests extended to music.

While at Oxford he was introduced to the young William Walton, to whom he became a friend and patron. Walton later dedicated his &quot;Portsmouth Point&quot; overture to Sassoon in recognition of his financial assistance and moral support.

Sassoon later embarked on a lecture tour of the US, as well as travelling in Europe and throughout Britain. He acquired a car, a gift from the publisher Frankie Schuster, and became renowned among his friends for his lack of driving skill, but this did not prevent him making full use of the mobility it gave him.

Sassoon had expressed his growing sense of identification with German soldiers in poems such as &quot;Reconciliation&quot; (1918), and after the war, he travelled extensively in Germany, visiting the country a number of times over the next decade.

In 1921 Sassoon went to Rome, where he met the Kaiser&#x27;s nephew, Prince Philipp of Hesse. The two became lovers for a while, later taking a holiday together in Munich. They had become estranged by the mid-1920s, due in part to geographical distance and in part, as Jean Moorcroft Wilson notes, to Sassoon&#x27;s increasing discomfort over Philipp&#x27;s growing interest in right-wing politics.

Sassoon continued to visit Germany. In 1927 he travelled to Berlin and Dresden with Osbert and Sacheverell Sitwell, and in 1929 he accompanied Stephen Tennant on a trip to a sanatorium in the Bavarian countryside.

Sassoon was a great admirer of the Welsh poet Henry Vaughan. On a visit to Wales in 1924, he made a pilgrimage to Vaughan&#x27;s grave at Llansantffraed, Powys, and there wrote &quot;At the Grave of Henry Vaughan&quot;, one of his better-known peacetime poems. The deaths within a short space of time of three of his closest friends – Edmund Gosse, Thomas Hardy and Frankie Schuster – came as setbacks to his personal happiness.

At the same time, Sassoon was preparing to take a new direction. While in the U.S., he had experimented with a novel. In 1928, he branched into prose, with &quot;Memoirs of a Fox-Hunting Man&quot;, the anonymously published first volume of a fictionalized autobiography, which was almost immediately accepted as a classic, bringing its author new fame as a prose writer.

The memoir, whose mild-mannered central character is content to do little more than be an idle country gentleman, playing cricket, riding and hunting foxes, is often humorous, revealing a side of Sassoon that had rarely been seen in his work during the war years.

The book won the 1928 James Tait Black Award for fiction. Sassoon followed it with &quot;Memoirs of an Infantry Officer&quot; (1930) and &quot;Sherston&#x27;s Progress&quot; (1936). In later years, he revisited his youth and early manhood with three volumes of genuine autobiography, which were acclaimed. These were &quot;The Old Century&quot;, &quot;The Weald of Youth&quot; and &quot;Siegfried&#x27;s Journey&quot;.

==Personal life==
===Homosexuality and affairs===
At Craiglockhart, Sassoon had met Wilfred Owen, another war poet. Numerous surviving documents demonstrate clearly the depth of Owen&#x27;s love and admiration for him. Writing years after Owen died, Sassoon said that &quot;W&#x27;s death was an unhealed wound, &amp; the ache of it has been with me ever since. I wanted him back – not his poems.&quot; Despite sentiments expressed in numerous letters between Sassoon and Owen, there is no support for a physical relationship between them. Both men returned to active service in France, where Owen was killed in 1918. 

Following the war he is believed to have had a succession of love affairs with men, including:
* William Park &quot;Gabriel&quot; Atkin, the landscape architectural and figure painter, draftsman and illustrator
* Ivor Novello, actor
* Glen Byam Shaw, actor and Novello&#x27;s former lover
* Prince Philipp of Hesse, German aristocrat
* Beverley Nichols, writer
* Stephen Tennant, an aristocrat
Although Byam Shaw remained Sassoon&#x27;s close friend throughout his life, only Tennant made a permanent impression.

Introduced by the Sitwells in 1927, Sassoon and Stephen Tennant began a relationship which lasted nearly six years. Tennant, however, had recurrent tuberculosis, and the strain which that put on their relationship had started to show by the early 1930s. In May 1933, Tennant, then receiving treatment at a sanatorium in Kent, abruptly informed Sassoon via a letter written by his physician that he never wanted to see him again. Sassoon was devastated.

When he met his future wife Hester Gatty a few months later, he was still reeling from his break-up with Tennant. Sensing a sympathetic nature, Sassoon confided in Hester about their relationship and, at her suggestion, wrote Tennant a letter to put the past to rest. While he and Tennant exchanged letters, telephone calls and infrequent visits in the years to come, they never resumed their previous relationship.

===Marriage and later life===
In September 1931, Sassoon rented Fitz House, Teffont Magna, Wiltshire, and began to live there. In December 1933, he married Hester Gatty (daughter of Sir Stephen Gatty), who was 20 years his junior, and soon afterwards they moved to Heytesbury House.

The marriage led to the birth of a child, something Sassoon had purportedly craved for a long time. Siegfried&#x27;s son, George Sassoon (1936–2006), became a scientist, linguist, and author, and was adored by Siegfried, who wrote several poems addressed to him. Siegfried&#x27;s marriage broke down after the Second World War, with Sassoon apparently unable to find a compromise between the solitude he enjoyed and the companionship he needed.

Separated from his wife in 1945, Sassoon lived in seclusion at Heytesbury in Wiltshire, but he maintained contact with a circle which included E. M. Forster and J. R. Ackerley. One of his closer friends was the cricketer Dennis Silk who later became Warden (headmaster) of Radley College. He also formed a close friendship with Vivien Hancock, then headmistress of Greenways School at Ashton Gifford House, Wiltshire, where his son George was a pupil. The relationship provoked Hester to make strong accusations against Hancock, who responded with the threat of legal action.

===Religion===
After a lifetime of grappling with questions of faith and spirituality, Sassoon made the decision to convert to Catholicism in 1957. His motivation for this conversion has been the subject of much speculation and analysis. Intellectual exploration, aesthetic appeal, spiritual seeking, and the influence of figures like Ronald Knox were factors for Sassoon&#x27;s decision to convert.

==Death and awards==
Sassoon was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1951 New Year Honours. He died from stomach cancer on 1 September 1967, one week before his 81st birthday.

He is buried at St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Mells, Somerset, not far from the grave of Father Ronald Knox, whom he so admired. His CBE, MC and campaign medals are on display at the Royal Welch Fusiliers Museum at Caernarfon Castle.

==Legacy==

On 11 November 1985, Sassoon was among 16 Great War poets commemorated on a slate stone unveiled in Westminster Abbey&#x27;s Poet&#x27;s Corner. The inscription on the stone was taken from Wilfred Owen&#x27;s &quot;Preface&quot; to his poems and reads: &quot;My subject is War, and the pity of War. The Poetry is in the pity.&quot;

The year 2003 saw the publication of &quot;Memorial Tablet&quot;, an authorised audio CD of readings by Sassoon recorded during the late 1950s. These included extracts from &quot;Memoirs of an Infantry Officer&quot; and &quot;The Weald of Youth&quot; as well as several war poems, including &quot;Attack&quot;, &quot;The Dug-Out&quot;, &quot;At Carnoy&quot; and &quot;Died of Wounds&quot;, and postwar works. The CD also included comment on Sassoon by three of his Great War contemporaries: Edmund Blunden, Edgell Rickword and Henry Williamson.

Siegfried Sassoon&#x27;s only child, George Sassoon, died of cancer in 2006. George had three children, two of whom were killed in a car crash in 1996. His daughter by his first marriage, Kendall Sassoon, is patron-in-chief of the Siegfried Sassoon Fellowship, established in 2001.

Sassoon&#x27;s Military Cross was rediscovered by his family in May 2007 and was put up for sale. It was bought by the Royal Welch Fusiliers for display at their museum in Caernarfon. Sassoon&#x27;s other service medals went unclaimed until 1985 when his son George obtained them from the Army Medal Office, then based at Droitwich. The &quot;late claim&quot; medals consisting of the 1914–15 Star, Victory Medal and British War Medal along with Sassoon&#x27;s CBE and Warrant of Appointment were auctioned by Sotheby&#x27;s in 2008.

In June 2009, the University of Cambridge announced plans to purchase an archive of Sassoon&#x27;s papers from his family, to be added to the university library&#x27;s Sassoon collection. On 4 November 2009, it was reported that this purchase would be supported by £550,000 from the National Heritage Memorial Fund, meaning that the University still needed to raise a further £110,000 on top of the money already received to meet the full £1.25 million asking price.

The funds were raised and in December 2009 it was announced that the University had received the papers. Included in the collection are war diaries kept by Sassoon while he served on the Western Front and in Palestine, a draft of &quot;&quot; (1917), notebooks from his schooldays and post-war journals.

Other items in the collection include love letters to his wife Hester and photographs and letters from other writers. Sassoon was an undergraduate at the university, as well as being made an honorary fellow of Clare College; the collection is housed at the Cambridge University Library. As well as private individuals, funding came from the Monument Trust, the JP Getty Jr Trust and Sir Siegmund Warburg&#x27;s Voluntary Settlement.

In 2010, &quot;Dream Voices: Siegfried Sassoon, Memory and War&quot;, a major exhibition of Sassoon&#x27;s life and archive, was held at Cambridge University. Several of Sassoon&#x27;s poems have been set to music, some during his life, by Cyril Rootham, who co-operated with the author.

The discovery in 2013 of an early draft of one of Sassoon&#x27;s best-known anti-war poems had a biographer saying she would rewrite portions of her work about the poet. In the poem &quot;Atrocities&quot;, which concerned the killing of German prisoners of war by Allied troops, the early draft shows that some lines were cut and others diluted. The poet&#x27;s publisher was nervous about publishing the poem and held it for publication in an expurgated version at a later date. Sassoon biographer Jean Moorcroft Wilson said &quot;This is very exciting material. I want to rewrite my biography and I probably shall be able to get some of it in. It&#x27;s a treasure trove&quot;. In early 2019, it was announced in &quot;The Guardian&quot; that a student from the University of Warwick, whilst looking through Glen Byam Shaw&#x27;s records at the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, had serendipitously discovered a Sassoon poem addressed to the former, which had not been published in its entirety.

==In popular culture==
A 1970 installment of The Wednesday Play titled &quot;Mad Jack&quot; based on Sassoon&#x27;s wartime experiences and their aftermath leading to his renunciation of his Military Cross starred Michael Jayston as Sassoon.

The novel &quot;Regeneration&quot; by Pat Barker is a fictionalized account of this period in Sassoon&#x27;s life, and was made into a film starring James Wilby as Sassoon and Jonathan Pryce as W. H. R. Rivers, the psychiatrist responsible for Sassoon&#x27;s treatment. Rivers became a kind of surrogate father to the troubled young man, and his sudden death in 1922 was a major blow to Sassoon.

In 2014, John Hurt played the older Sassoon and Morgan Watkins the young Sassoon in &quot;The Pity of War&quot;, a BBC dramatized documentary.

A film titled &quot;The Burying Party&quot; (released August 2018) depicts Wilfred Owen&#x27;s final year from Craiglockhart Hospital to the Battle of the Sambre (1918), including his meeting with Sassoon at the hospital. Matthew Staite stars as Owen and Sid Phoenix as Sassoon.

Peter Capaldi and Jack Lowden portrayed Sassoon in Terence Davies&#x27; 2021 film &quot;Benediction&quot;.

Timothy Renouf portrayed Sassoon in &quot;The Laureate&quot;, a 2021 biographical film about Robert Graves.

Stevan Rimkus portrayed Sassoon in &quot;The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&quot; episode &quot;Somme, Early August 1916&quot;.

Sassoon served as inspiration for Alice Winn&#x27;s novel &quot;In Memoriam&quot;, Specifically the character Sidney Ellwood.

<text>Refrigeration is any of various types of cooling of a space, substance, or system to lower and/or maintain its temperature below the ambient one (while the removed heat is ejected to a place of higher temperature). Refrigeration is an artificial, or human-made, cooling method. 

Refrigeration refers to the process by which energy, in the form of heat, is removed from a low-temperature medium and transferred to a high-temperature medium. This work of energy transfer is traditionally driven by mechanical means (whether ice or electromechanical machines), but it can also be driven by heat, magnetism, electricity, laser, or other means. Refrigeration has many applications, including household refrigerators, industrial freezers, cryogenics, and air conditioning. Heat pumps may use the heat output of the refrigeration process, and also may be designed to be reversible, but are otherwise similar to air conditioning units.

Refrigeration has had a large impact on industry, lifestyle, agriculture, and settlement patterns. The idea of preserving food dates back to human prehistory, but for thousands of years humans were limited regarding the means of doing so. They used curing via salting and drying, and they made use of natural coolness in caves, root cellars, and winter weather, but other means of cooling were unavailable. In the 19th century, they began to make use of the ice trade to develop cold chains. In the late 19th through mid-20th centuries, mechanical refrigeration was developed, improved, and greatly expanded in its reach. Refrigeration has thus rapidly evolved in the past century, from ice harvesting to temperature-controlled rail cars, refrigerator trucks, and ubiquitous refrigerators and freezers in both stores and homes in many countries. The introduction of refrigerated rail cars contributed to the settlement of areas that were not on earlier main transport channels such as rivers, harbors, or valley trails.

These new settlement patterns sparked the building of large cities which are able to thrive in areas that were otherwise thought to be inhospitable, such as Houston, Texas, and Las Vegas, Nevada. In most developed countries, cities are heavily dependent upon refrigeration in supermarkets in order to obtain their food for daily consumption. The increase in food sources has led to a larger concentration of agricultural sales coming from a smaller percentage of farms. Farms today have a much larger output per person in comparison to the late 1800s. This has resulted in new food sources available to entire populations, which has had a large impact on the nutrition of society.

==History==
===Earliest forms of cooling===
The seasonal harvesting of snow and ice is an ancient practice estimated to have begun earlier than 1000 BC. A Chinese collection of lyrics from this time period known as the &quot;Sleaping&quot;, describes religious ceremonies for filling and emptying ice cellars. However, little is known about the construction of these ice cellars or the purpose of the ice. The next ancient society to record the harvesting of ice may have been the Jews in the book of Proverbs, which reads, &quot;As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to them who sent him.&quot; Historians have interpreted this to mean that the Jews used ice to cool beverages rather than to preserve food. Other ancient cultures such as the Greeks and the Romans dug large snow pits insulated with grass, chaff, or branches of trees as cold storage. Like the Jews, the Greeks and Romans did not use ice and snow to preserve food, but primarily as a means to cool beverages. Egyptians cooled water by evaporation in shallow earthen jars on the roofs of their houses at night. The ancient people of India used this same concept to produce ice. The Persians stored ice in a pit called a Yakhchal and may have been the first group of people to use cold storage to preserve food. In the Australian outback before a reliable electricity supply was available many farmers used a Coolgardie safe, consisting of a box frame with hessian (burlap) sides soaked in water. The water would evaporate and thereby cool the interior air, allowing many perishables such as fruit, butter, and cured meats to be kept.

===Ice harvesting===
Before 1830, few Americans used ice to refrigerate foods due to a lack of ice-storehouses and iceboxes. As these two things became more widely available, individuals used axes and saws to harvest ice for their storehouses. This method proved to be difficult, dangerous, and certainly did not resemble anything that could be duplicated on a commercial scale.

Despite the difficulties of harvesting ice, Frederic Tudor thought that he could capitalize on this new commodity by harvesting ice in New England and shipping it to the Caribbean islands as well as the southern states. In the beginning, Tudor lost thousands of dollars, but eventually turned a profit as he constructed icehouses in Charleston, Virginia and in the Cuban port town of Havana. These icehouses as well as better insulated ships helped reduce ice wastage from 66% to 8%. This efficiency gain influenced Tudor to expand his ice market to other towns with icehouses such as New Orleans and Savannah. This ice market further expanded as harvesting ice became faster and cheaper after one of Tudor&#x27;s suppliers, Nathaniel Wyeth, invented a horse-drawn ice cutter in 1825. This invention as well as Tudor&#x27;s success inspired others to get involved in the ice trade and the ice industry grew.

Ice became a mass-market commodity by the early 1830s with the price of ice dropping from six cents per pound to a half of a cent per pound. In New York City, ice consumption increased from 12,000 tons in 1843 to 100,000 tons in 1856. Boston&#x27;s consumption leapt from 6,000 tons to 85,000 tons during that same period. Ice harvesting created a &quot;cooling culture&quot; as majority of people used ice and iceboxes to store their dairy products, fish, meat, and even fruits and vegetables. These early cold storage practices paved the way for many Americans to accept the refrigeration technology that would soon take over the country.

===Refrigeration research===

The history of artificial refrigeration began when Scottish professor William Cullen designed a small refrigerating machine in 1755. Cullen used a pump to create a partial vacuum over a container of diethyl ether, which then boiled, absorbing heat from the surrounding air. The experiment even created a small amount of ice, but had no practical application at that time.

In 1758, Benjamin Franklin and John Hadley, professor of chemistry, collaborated on a project investigating the principle of evaporation as a means to rapidly cool an object at Cambridge University, England. They confirmed that the evaporation of highly volatile liquids, such as alcohol and ether, could be used to drive down the temperature of an object past the freezing point of water. They conducted their experiment with the bulb of a mercury thermometer as their object and with a bellows used to quicken the evaporation; they lowered the temperature of the thermometer bulb down to , while the ambient temperature was . They noted that soon after they passed the freezing point of water , a thin film of ice formed on the surface of the thermometer&#x27;s bulb and that the ice mass was about a thick when they stopped the experiment upon reaching . Franklin wrote, &quot;From this experiment, one may see the possibility of freezing a man to death on a warm summer&#x27;s day&quot;. In 1805, American inventor Oliver Evans described a closed vapor-compression refrigeration cycle for the production of ice by ether under vacuum.

In 1820, the English scientist Michael Faraday liquefied ammonia and other gases by using high pressures and low temperatures, and in 1834, an American expatriate to Great Britain, Jacob Perkins, built the first working vapor-compression refrigeration system in the world. It was a closed-cycle that could operate continuously, as he described in his patent:
:I am enabled to use volatile fluids for the purpose of producing the cooling or freezing of fluids, and yet at the same time constantly condensing such volatile fluids, and bringing them again into operation without waste.

His prototype system worked although it did not succeed commercially.

In 1842, a similar attempt was made by American physician, John Gorrie, who built a working prototype, but it was a commercial failure. Like many of the medical experts during this time, Gorrie thought too much exposure to tropical heat led to mental and physical degeneration, as well as the spread of diseases such as malaria. He conceived the idea of using his refrigeration system to cool the air for comfort in homes and hospitals to prevent disease. American engineer Alexander Twining took out a British patent in 1850 for a vapour compression system that used ether.

The first practical vapour-compression refrigeration system was built by James Harrison, a British journalist who had emigrated to Australia. His 1856 patent was for a vapour-compression system using ether, alcohol, or ammonia. He built a mechanical ice-making machine in 1851 on the banks of the Barwon River at Rocky Point in Geelong, Victoria, and his first commercial ice-making machine followed in 1854. Harrison also introduced commercial vapour-compression refrigeration to breweries and meat-packing houses, and by 1861, a dozen of his systems were in operation. He later entered the debate of how to compete against the American advantage of unrefrigerated beef sales to the United Kingdom. In 1873 he prepared the sailing ship &quot;Norfolk&quot; for an experimental beef shipment to the United Kingdom, which used a cold room system instead of a refrigeration system. The venture was a failure as the ice was consumed faster than expected.
The first gas absorption refrigeration system using gaseous ammonia dissolved in water (referred to as &quot;aqua ammonia&quot;) was developed by Ferdinand Carré of France in 1859 and patented in 1860. Carl von Linde, an engineer specializing in steam locomotives and professor of engineering at the Technological University of Munich in Germany, began researching refrigeration in the 1860s and 1870s in response to demand from brewers for a technology that would allow year-round, large-scale production of lager; he patented an improved method of liquefying gases in 1876. His new process made possible using gases such as ammonia, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and methyl chloride (CH3Cl) as refrigerants and they were widely used for that purpose until the late 1920s.

Thaddeus Lowe, an American balloonist, held several patents on ice-making machines. His &quot;Compression Ice Machine&quot; would revolutionize the cold-storage industry. In 1869, he and other investors purchased an old steamship onto which they loaded one of Lowe&#x27;s refrigeration units and began shipping fresh fruit from New York to the Gulf Coast area, and fresh meat from Galveston, Texas back to New York, but because of Lowe&#x27;s lack of knowledge about shipping, the business was a costly failure.

===Commercial use===

In 1842, John Gorrie created a system capable of refrigerating water to produce ice. Although it was a commercial failure, it inspired scientists and inventors around the world. France&#x27;s Ferdinand Carre was one of the inspired and he created an ice producing system that was simpler and smaller than that of Gorrie. During the Civil War, cities such as New Orleans could no longer get ice from New England via the coastal ice trade. Carre&#x27;s refrigeration system became the solution to New Orleans&#x27; ice problems and, by 1865, the city had three of Carre&#x27;s machines. In 1867, in San Antonio, Texas, a French immigrant named Andrew Muhl built an ice-making machine to help service the expanding beef industry before moving it to Waco in 1871. In 1873, the patent for this machine was contracted by the Columbus Iron Works, a company acquired by the W.C. Bradley Co., which went on to produce the first commercial ice-makers in the US.

By the 1870s, breweries had become the largest users of harvested ice. Though the ice-harvesting industry had grown immensely by the turn of the 20th century, pollution and sewage had begun to creep into natural ice, making it a problem in the metropolitan suburbs. Eventually, breweries began to complain of tainted ice. Public concern for the purity of water, from which ice was formed, began to increase in the early 1900s with the rise of germ theory. Numerous media outlets published articles connecting diseases such as typhoid fever with natural ice consumption. This caused ice harvesting to become illegal in certain areas of the country. All of these scenarios increased the demands for modern refrigeration and manufactured ice. Ice producing machines like that of Carre&#x27;s and Muhl&#x27;s were looked to as means of producing ice to meet the needs of grocers, farmers, and food shippers.

Refrigerated railroad cars were introduced in the US in the 1840s for short-run transport of dairy products, but these used harvested ice to maintain a cool temperature.
The new refrigerating technology first met with widespread industrial use as a means to freeze meat supplies for transport by sea in reefer ships from the British Dominions and other countries to the British Isles. Although not actually the first to achieve successful transportation of frozen goods overseas (the &quot;Strathleven&quot; had arrived at the London docks on 2 February 1880 with a cargo of frozen beef, mutton and butter from Sydney and Melbourne ), the breakthrough is often attributed to William Soltau Davidson, an entrepreneur who had emigrated to New Zealand. Davidson thought that Britain&#x27;s rising population and meat demand could mitigate the slump in world wool markets that was heavily affecting New Zealand. After extensive research, he commissioned the &quot;Dunedin&quot; to be refitted with a compression refrigeration unit for meat shipment in 1881. On February 15, 1882, the &quot;Dunedin&quot; sailed for London with what was to be the first commercially successful refrigerated shipping voyage, and the foundation of the refrigerated meat industry.

&quot;The Times&quot; commented &quot;Today we have to record such a triumph over physical difficulties, as would have been incredible, even unimaginable, a very few days ago...&quot;. The &quot;Marlborough&quot;—sister ship to the &quot;Dunedin&quot; – was immediately converted and joined the trade the following year, along with the rival New Zealand Shipping Company vessel &quot;Mataurua&quot;, while the German Steamer &quot;Marsala&quot; began carrying frozen New Zealand lamb in December 1882. Within five years, 172 shipments of frozen meat were sent from New Zealand to the United Kingdom, of which only 9 had significant amounts of meat condemned. Refrigerated shipping also led to a broader meat and dairy boom in Australasia and South America. J &amp; E Hall of Dartford, England outfitted the &quot;SS Selembria&quot; with a vapor compression system to bring 30,000 carcasses of mutton from the Falkland Islands in 1886. In the years ahead, the industry rapidly expanded to Australia, Argentina and the United States.

By the 1890s, refrigeration played a vital role in the distribution of food. The meat-packing industry relied heavily on natural ice in the 1880s and continued to rely on manufactured ice as those technologies became available. By 1900, the meat-packing houses of Chicago had adopted ammonia-cycle commercial refrigeration. By 1914, almost every location used artificial refrigeration. The major meat packers, Armour, Swift, and Wilson, had purchased the most expensive units which they installed on train cars and in branch houses and storage facilities in the more remote distribution areas.

By the middle of the 20th century, refrigeration units were designed for installation on trucks or lorries. Refrigerated vehicles are used to transport perishable goods, such as frozen foods, fruit and vegetables, and temperature-sensitive chemicals. Most modern refrigerators keep the temperature between –40 and –20 °C, and have a maximum payload of around 24,000 kg gross weight (in Europe).

Although commercial refrigeration quickly progressed, it had limitations that prevented it from moving into the household. First, most refrigerators were far too large. Some of the commercial units being used in 1910 weighed between five and two hundred tons. Second, commercial refrigerators were expensive to produce, purchase, and maintain. Lastly, these refrigerators were unsafe. It was not uncommon for commercial refrigerators to catch fire, explode, or leak toxic gases. Refrigeration did not become a household technology until these three challenges were overcome.

===Home and consumer use===

During the early 1800s, consumers preserved their food by storing food and ice purchased from ice harvesters in iceboxes. In 1803, Thomas Moore patented a metal-lined butter-storage tub which became the prototype for most iceboxes. These iceboxes were used until nearly 1910 and the technology did not progress. In fact, consumers that used the icebox in 1910 faced the same challenge of a moldy and stinky icebox that consumers had in the early 1800s.

General Electric (GE) was one of the first companies to overcome these challenges. In 1911, GE released a household refrigeration unit that was powered by gas. The use of gas eliminated the need for an electric compressor motor and decreased the size of the refrigerator. However, electric companies that were customers of GE did not benefit from a gas-powered unit. Thus, GE invested in developing an electric model. In 1927, GE released the Monitor Top, the first refrigerator to run on electricity.

In 1930, Frigidaire, one of GE&#x27;s main competitors, synthesized Freon. With the invention of synthetic refrigerants based mostly on a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) chemical, safer refrigerators were possible for home and consumer use. Freon led to the development of smaller, lighter, and cheaper refrigerators. The average price of a refrigerator dropped from $275 to $154 with the synthesis of Freon. This lower price allowed ownership of refrigerators in American households to exceed 50% by 1940. Freon is a trademark of the DuPont Corporation and refers to these CFCs, and later hydro chlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) and hydro fluorocarbon (HFC), refrigerants developed in the late 1920s. These refrigerants were considered — at the time — to be less harmful than the commonly-used refrigerants of the time, including methyl formate, ammonia, methyl chloride, and sulfur dioxide. The intent was to provide refrigeration equipment for home use without danger. These CFC refrigerants answered that need. In the 1970s, though, the compounds were found to be reacting with atmospheric ozone, an important protection against solar ultraviolet radiation, and their use as a refrigerant worldwide was curtailed in the Montreal Protocol of 1987.

==Impact on settlement patterns in the United States of America==
In the last century, refrigeration allowed new settlement patterns to emerge. This new technology has allowed for new areas to be settled that are not on a natural channel of transport such as a river, valley trail or harbor that may have otherwise not been settled. Refrigeration has given opportunities to early settlers to expand westward and into rural areas that were unpopulated. These new settlers with rich and untapped soil saw opportunity to profit by sending raw goods to the eastern cities and states. In the 20th century, refrigeration has made &quot;Galactic Cities&quot; such as Dallas, Phoenix, and Los Angeles possible.

===Refrigerated rail cars===
The refrigerated rail car (refrigerated van or refrigerator car), along with the dense railroad network, became an exceedingly important link between the marketplace and the farm allowing for a national opportunity rather than a just a regional one. Before the invention of the refrigerated rail car, it was impossible to ship perishable food products long distances. The beef packing industry made the first demand push for refrigeration cars. The railroad companies were slow to adopt this new invention because of their heavy investments in cattle cars, stockyards, and feedlots. Refrigeration cars were also complex and costly compared to other rail cars, which also slowed the adoption of the refrigerated rail car. After the slow adoption of the refrigerated car, the beef packing industry dominated the refrigerated rail car business with their ability to control ice plants and the setting of icing fees. The United States Department of Agriculture estimated that, in 1916, over sixty-nine percent of the cattle killed in the country was done in plants involved in interstate trade. The same companies that were also involved in the meat trade later implemented refrigerated transport to include vegetables and fruit. The meat packing companies had much of the expensive machinery, such as refrigerated cars, and cold storage facilities that allowed for them to effectively distribute all types of perishable goods. During World War I, a national refrigerator car pool was established by the United States Administration to deal with problem of idle cars and was later continued after the war. The idle car problem was the problem of refrigeration cars sitting pointlessly in between seasonal harvests. This meant that very expensive cars sat in rail yards for a good portion of the year while making no revenue for the car&#x27;s owner. The car pool was a system where cars were distributed to areas as crops matured ensuring maximum use of the cars. Refrigerated rail cars moved eastward from vineyards, orchards, fields, and gardens in western states to satisfy Americas consuming market in the east. The refrigerated car made it possible to transport perishable crops hundreds and even thousands of kilometres or miles. The most noticeable effect the car gave was a regional specialization of vegetables and fruits. The refrigeration rail car was widely used for the transportation of perishable goods up until the 1950s. By the 1960s, the nation&#x27;s interstate highway system was adequately complete allowing for trucks to carry the majority of the perishable food loads and to push out the old system of the refrigerated rail cars.

===Expansion west and into rural areas===
The widespread use of refrigeration allowed for a vast amount of new agricultural opportunities to open up in the United States. New markets emerged throughout the United States in areas that were previously uninhabited and far-removed from heavily populated areas. New agricultural opportunity presented itself in areas that were considered rural, such as states in the south and in the west. Shipments on a large scale from the south and California were both made around the same time, although natural ice was used from the Sierras in California rather than manufactured ice in the south. Refrigeration allowed for many areas to specialize in the growing of specific fruits. California specialized in several fruits, grapes, peaches, pears, plums, and apples, while Georgia became famous for specifically its peaches. In California, the acceptance of the refrigerated rail cars led to an increase of car loads from 4,500 carloads in 1895 to between 8,000 and 10,000 carloads in 1905. The Gulf States, Arkansas, Missouri and Tennessee entered into strawberry production on a large-scale while Mississippi became the center of the tomato industry. New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona, and Nevada grew cantaloupes. Without refrigeration, this would have not been possible. By 1917, well-established fruit and vegetable areas that were close to eastern markets felt the pressure of competition from these distant specialized centers. Refrigeration was not limited to meat, fruit and vegetables but it also encompassed dairy product and dairy farms. In the early twentieth century, large cities got their dairy supply from farms as far as . Dairy products were not as easily transported over great distances like fruits and vegetables due to greater perishability. Refrigeration made production possible in the west far from eastern markets, so much in fact that dairy farmers could pay transportation cost and still undersell their eastern competitors. Refrigeration and the refrigerated rail gave opportunity to areas with rich soil far from natural channel of transport such as a river, valley trail or harbors.

===Rise of the galactic city===
&quot;Edge city&quot; was a term coined by Joel Garreau, whereas the term &quot;galactic city&quot; was coined by Lewis Mumford. These terms refer to a concentration of business, shopping, and entertainment outside a traditional downtown or central business district in what had previously been a residential or rural area. There were several factors contributing to the growth of these cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Houston, and Phoenix. The factors that contributed to these large cities include reliable automobiles, highway systems, refrigeration, and agricultural production increases. Large cities such as the ones mentioned above have not been uncommon in history, but what separates these cities from the rest are that these cities are not along some natural channel of transport, or at some crossroad of two or more channels such as a trail, harbor, mountain, river, or valley. These large cities have been developed in areas that only a few hundred years ago would have been uninhabitable. Without a cost efficient way of cooling air and transporting water and food from great distances, these large cities would have never developed. The rapid growth of these cities was influenced by refrigeration and an agricultural productivity increase, allowing more distant farms to effectively feed the population.

==Impact on agriculture and food production==

Agriculture&#x27;s role in developed countries has drastically changed in the last century due to many factors, including refrigeration. Statistics from the 2007 census gives information on the large concentration of agricultural sales coming from a small portion of the existing farms in the United States today. This is a partial result of the market created for the frozen meat trade by the first successful shipment of frozen sheep carcasses coming from New Zealand in the 1880s. As the market continued to grow, regulations on food processing and quality began to be enforced. Eventually, electricity was introduced into rural homes in the United States, which allowed refrigeration technology to continue to expand on the farm, increasing output per person. Today, refrigeration&#x27;s use on the farm reduces humidity levels, avoids spoiling due to bacterial growth, and assists in preservation.

===Demographics===
The introduction of refrigeration and evolution of additional technologies drastically changed agriculture in the United States. During the beginning of the 20th century, farming was a common occupation and lifestyle for United States citizens, as most farmers actually lived on their farm. In 1935, there were 6.8 million farms in the United States and a population of 127 million. Yet, while the United States population has continued to climb, citizens pursuing agriculture continue to decline. Based on the 2007 US Census, less than one percent of a population of 310 million people claim farming as an occupation today. However, the increasing population has led to an increasing demand for agricultural products, which is met through a greater variety of crops, fertilizers, pesticides, and improved technology. Improved technology has decreased the risk and time involved for agricultural management and allows larger farms to increase their output per person to meet society&#x27;s demand.

===Meat packing and trade===
Prior to 1882, the South Island of New Zealand had been experimenting with sowing grass and crossbreeding sheep, which immediately gave their farmers economic potential in the exportation of meat. In 1882, the first successful shipment of sheep carcasses was sent from Port Chalmers in Dunedin, New Zealand, to London. By the 1890s, the frozen meat trade became increasingly more profitable in New Zealand, especially in Canterbury, where 50% of exported sheep carcasses came from in 1900. It was not long before Canterbury meat was known for the highest quality, creating a demand for New Zealand meat around the world. In order to meet this new demand, the farmers improved their feed so sheep could be ready for the slaughter in only seven months. This new method of shipping led to an economic boom in New Zealand by the mid 1890s.

In the United States, the Meat Inspection Act of 1891 was put in place in the United States because local butchers felt the refrigerated railcar system was unwholesome. When meat packing began to take off, consumers became nervous about the quality of the meat for consumption. Upton Sinclair&#x27;s 1906 novel &quot;The Jungle&quot; brought negative attention to the meat packing industry, by drawing to light unsanitary working conditions and processing of diseased animals. The book caught the attention of President Theodore Roosevelt, and the 1906 Meat Inspection Act was put into place as an amendment to the Meat Inspection Act of 1891. This new act focused on the quality of the meat and environment it is processed in.

===Electricity in rural areas===
In the early 1930s, 90 percent of the urban population of the United States had electric power, in comparison to only 10 percent of rural homes. At the time, power companies did not feel that extending power to rural areas (rural electrification) would produce enough profit to make it worth their while. However, in the midst of the Great Depression, President Franklin D. Roosevelt realized that rural areas would continue to lag behind urban areas in both poverty and production if they were not electrically wired. On May 11, 1935, the president signed an executive order called the Rural Electrification Administration, also known as REA. The agency provided loans to fund electric infrastructure in the rural areas. In just a few years, 300,000 people in rural areas of the United States had received power in their homes.

While electricity dramatically improved working conditions on farms, it also had a large impact on the safety of food production. Refrigeration systems were introduced to the farming and food distribution processes, which helped in food preservation and kept food supplies safe. Refrigeration also allowed for shipment of perishable commodities throughout the United States. As a result, United States farmers quickly became the most productive in the world, and entire new food systems arose.

===Farm use===
In order to reduce humidity levels and spoiling due to bacterial growth, refrigeration is used for meat, produce, and dairy processing in farming today. Refrigeration systems are used the heaviest in the warmer months for farming produce, which must be cooled as soon as possible in order to meet quality standards and increase the shelf life. Meanwhile, dairy farms refrigerate milk year round to avoid spoiling.

==Effects on lifestyle and diet==
In the late 19th Century and into the very early 20th Century, except for staple foods (sugar, rice, and beans) that needed no refrigeration, the available foods were affected heavily by the seasons and what could be grown locally. Refrigeration has removed these limitations. Refrigeration played a large part in the feasibility and then popularity of the modern supermarket. Fruits and vegetables out of season, or grown in distant locations, are now available at relatively low prices. Refrigerators have led to a huge increase in meat and dairy products as a portion of overall supermarket sales. As well as changing the goods purchased at the market, the ability to store these foods for extended periods of time has led to an increase in leisure time. Prior to the advent of the household refrigerator, people would have to shop on a daily basis for the supplies needed for their meals.

===Impact on nutrition===
The introduction of refrigeration allowed for the hygienic handling and storage of perishables, and as such, promoted output growth, consumption, and the availability of nutrition. The change in our method of food preservation moved us away from salts to a more manageable sodium level. The ability to move and store perishables such as meat and dairy led to a 1.7% increase in dairy consumption and overall protein intake by 1.25% annually in the US after the 1890s.

People were not only consuming these perishables because it became easier for they themselves to store them, but because the innovations in refrigerated transportation and storage led to less spoilage and waste, thereby driving the prices of these products down. Refrigeration accounts for at least 5.1% of the increase in adult stature (in the US) through improved nutrition, and when the indirect effects associated with improvements in the quality of nutrients and the reduction in illness is additionally factored in, the overall impact becomes considerably larger. Recent studies have also shown a negative relationship between the number of refrigerators in a household and the rate of gastric cancer mortality.

==Current applications of refrigeration==
Probably the most widely used current applications of refrigeration are for air conditioning of private homes and public buildings, and refrigerating foodstuffs in homes, restaurants and large storage warehouses. The use of refrigerators and walk-in coolers and freezers in kitchens, factories and warehouses for storing and processing fruits and vegetables has allowed adding fresh salads to the modern diet year round, and storing fish and meats safely for long periods.
The optimum temperature range for perishable food storage is .

In commerce and manufacturing, there are many uses for refrigeration. Refrigeration is used to liquefy gases – oxygen, nitrogen, propane, and methane, for example. In compressed air purification, it is used to condense water vapor from compressed air to reduce its moisture content. In oil refineries, chemical plants, and petrochemical plants, refrigeration is used to maintain certain processes at their needed low temperatures (for example, in alkylation of butenes and butane to produce a high-octane gasoline component). Metal workers use refrigeration to temper steel and cutlery. When transporting temperature-sensitive foodstuffs and other materials by trucks, trains, airplanes and seagoing vessels, refrigeration is a necessity.

Dairy products are constantly in need of refrigeration, and it was only discovered in the past few decades that eggs needed to be refrigerated during shipment rather than waiting to be refrigerated after arrival at the grocery store. Meats, poultry and fish all must be kept in climate-controlled environments before being sold. Refrigeration also helps keep fruits and vegetables edible longer.

One of the most influential uses of refrigeration was in the development of the sushi/sashimi industry in Japan. Before the discovery of refrigeration, many sushi connoisseurs were at risk of contracting diseases. The dangers of unrefrigerated sashimi were not brought to light for decades due to the lack of research and healthcare distribution across rural Japan. Around mid-century, the Zojirushi corporation, based in Kyoto, made breakthroughs in refrigerator designs, making refrigerators cheaper and more accessible for restaurant proprietors and the general public.

==Methods of refrigeration==
Methods of refrigeration can be classified as &quot;non-cyclic&quot;, &quot;cyclic&quot;, &quot;thermoelectric&quot; and &quot;magnetic&quot;.

===Non-cyclic refrigeration===

This refrigeration method cools a contained area by melting ice, or by sublimating dry ice. Perhaps the simplest example of this is a portable cooler, where items are put in it, then ice is poured over the top. Regular ice can maintain temperatures near, but not below the freezing point, unless salt is used to cool the ice down further (as in a traditional ice-cream maker). Dry ice can reliably bring the temperature well below water freezing point.

===Cyclic refrigeration===

This consists of a refrigeration cycle, where heat is removed from a low-temperature space or source and rejected to a high-temperature sink with the help of external work, and its inverse, the thermodynamic power cycle. In the power cycle, heat is supplied from a high-temperature source to the engine, part of the heat being used to produce work and the rest being rejected to a low-temperature sink. This satisfies the second law of thermodynamics.

A &quot;refrigeration cycle&quot; describes the changes that take place in the refrigerant as it alternately absorbs and rejects heat as it circulates through a refrigerator. It is also applied to heating, ventilation, and air conditioning HVACR work, when describing the &quot;process&quot; of refrigerant flow through an HVACR unit, whether it is a packaged or split system.

Heat naturally flows from hot to cold. Work is applied to cool a living space or storage volume by pumping heat from a lower temperature heat source into a higher temperature heat sink. Insulation is used to reduce the work and energy needed to achieve and maintain a lower temperature in the cooled space. The operating principle of the refrigeration cycle was described mathematically by Sadi Carnot in 1824 as a heat engine.

The most common types of refrigeration systems use the reverse-Rankine vapor-compression refrigeration cycle, although absorption heat pumps are used in a minority of applications.

Cyclic refrigeration can be classified as:
#Vapor cycle, and
#Gas cycle

Vapor cycle refrigeration can further be classified as:
#Vapor-compression refrigeration
#Sorption Refrigeration
##Vapor-absorption refrigeration
##Adsorption refrigeration

====Vapor-compression cycle====

The vapor-compression cycle is used in most household refrigerators as well as in many large commercial and industrial refrigeration systems. Figure 1 provides a schematic diagram of the components of a typical vapor-compression refrigeration system.

The thermodynamics of the cycle can be analyzed on a diagram as shown in Figure 2. In this cycle, a circulating refrigerant such as a low boiling hydrocarbon or hydrofluorocarbons enters the compressor as a vapour. From point 1 to point 2, the vapor is compressed at constant entropy and exits the compressor as a vapor at a higher temperature, but still below the vapor pressure at that temperature. From point 2 to point 3 and on to point 4, the vapor travels through the condenser which cools the vapour until it starts condensing, and then condenses the vapor into a liquid by removing additional heat at constant pressure and temperature. Between points 4 and 5, the liquid refrigerant goes through the expansion valve (also called a throttle valve) where its pressure abruptly decreases, causing flash evaporation and auto-refrigeration of, typically, less than half of the liquid.

That results in a mixture of liquid and vapour at a lower temperature and pressure as shown at point 5. The cold liquid-vapor mixture then travels through the evaporator coil or tubes and is completely vaporized by cooling the warm air (from the space being refrigerated) being blown by a fan across the evaporator coil or tubes. The resulting refrigerant vapour returns to the compressor inlet at point 1 to complete the thermodynamic cycle.

The above discussion is based on the ideal vapour-compression refrigeration cycle, and does not take into account real-world effects like frictional pressure drop in the system, slight thermodynamic irreversibility during the compression of the refrigerant vapor, or non-ideal gas behavior, if any. Vapor compression refrigerators can be arranged in two stages in cascade refrigeration systems, with the second stage cooling the condenser of the first stage. This can be used for achieving very low temperatures.

More information about the design and performance of vapor-compression refrigeration systems is available in the classic &quot;Perry&#x27;s Chemical Engineers&#x27; Handbook&quot;.

====Sorption cycle====
=====Absorption cycle=====

In the early years of the twentieth century, the vapor absorption cycle using water-ammonia systems or LiBr-water was popular and widely used. After the development of the vapor compression cycle, the vapor absorption cycle lost much of its importance because of its low coefficient of performance (about one fifth of that of the vapor compression cycle). Today, the vapor absorption cycle is used mainly where fuel for heating is available but electricity is not, such as in recreational vehicles that carry LP gas. It is also used in industrial environments where plentiful waste heat overcomes its inefficiency.

The absorption cycle is similar to the compression cycle, except for the method of raising the pressure of the refrigerant vapor. In the absorption system, the compressor is replaced by an absorber which dissolves the refrigerant in a suitable liquid, a liquid pump which raises the pressure and a generator which, on heat addition, drives off the refrigerant vapor from the high-pressure liquid. Some work is needed by the liquid pump but, for a given quantity of refrigerant, it is much smaller than needed by the compressor in the vapor compression cycle. In an absorption refrigerator, a suitable combination of refrigerant and absorbent is used. The most common combinations are ammonia (refrigerant) with water (absorbent), and water (refrigerant) with lithium bromide (absorbent).

=====Adsorption cycle=====

The main difference with absorption cycle, is that in adsorption cycle, the refrigerant (adsorbate) could be ammonia, water, methanol, etc., while the adsorbent is a solid, such as silica gel, activated carbon, or zeolite, unlike in the absorption cycle where absorbent is liquid.

The reason adsorption refrigeration technology has been extensively researched in recent 30 years lies in that the operation of an adsorption refrigeration system is often noiseless, non-corrosive and environment friendly.

====Gas cycle====

When the working fluid is a gas that is compressed and expanded but does not change phase, the refrigeration cycle is called a &quot;gas cycle&quot;. Air is most often this working fluid. As there is no condensation and evaporation intended in a gas cycle, components corresponding to the condenser and evaporator in a vapor compression cycle are the hot and cold gas-to-gas heat exchangers in gas cycles.

The gas cycle is less efficient than the vapor compression cycle because the gas cycle works on the reverse Brayton cycle instead of the reverse Rankine cycle. As such, the working fluid does not receive and reject heat at constant temperature. In the gas cycle, the refrigeration effect is equal to the product of the specific heat of the gas and the rise in temperature of the gas in the low temperature side. Therefore, for the same cooling load, a gas refrigeration cycle needs a large mass flow rate and is bulky.

Because of their lower efficiency and larger bulk, &quot;air cycle&quot; coolers are not often used nowadays in terrestrial cooling devices. However, the air cycle machine is very common on gas turbine-powered jet aircraft as cooling and ventilation units, because compressed air is readily available from the engines&#x27; compressor sections. Such units also serve the purpose of pressurizing the aircraft.

===Thermoelectric refrigeration===
Thermoelectric cooling uses the Peltier effect to create a heat flux between the junction of two types of material. This effect is commonly used in camping and portable coolers and for cooling electronic components and small instruments. Peltier coolers are often used where a traditional vapor-compression cycle refrigerator would be impractical or take up too much space, and in cooled image sensors as an easy, compact and lightweight, if inefficient, way to achieve very low temperatures, using two or more stage peltier coolers arranged in a cascade refrigeration configuration, meaning that two or more Peltier elements are stacked on top of each other, with each stage being larger than the one before it, in order to extract more heat and waste heat generated by the previous stages. Peltier cooling has a low COP (efficiency) when compared with that of the vapor-compression cycle, so it emits more waste heat (heat generated by the Peltier element or cooling mechanism) and consumes more power for a given cooling capacity.

===Magnetic refrigeration===
Magnetic refrigeration, or adiabatic demagnetization, is a cooling technology based on the magnetocaloric effect, an intrinsic property of magnetic solids. The refrigerant is often a paramagnetic salt, such as cerium magnesium nitrate. The active magnetic dipoles in this case are those of the electron shells of the paramagnetic atoms.

A strong magnetic field is applied to the refrigerant, forcing its various magnetic dipoles to align and putting these degrees of freedom of the refrigerant into a state of lowered entropy. A heat sink then absorbs the heat released by the refrigerant due to its loss of entropy. Thermal contact with the heat sink is then broken so that the system is insulated, and the magnetic field is switched off. This increases the heat capacity of the refrigerant, thus decreasing its temperature below the temperature of the heat sink.

Because few materials exhibit the needed properties at room temperature, applications have so far been limited to cryogenics and research.

===Other methods===

Other methods of refrigeration include the air cycle machine used in aircraft; the vortex tube used for spot cooling, when compressed air is available; and thermoacoustic refrigeration using sound waves in a pressurized gas to drive heat transfer and heat exchange; steam jet cooling popular in the early 1930s for air conditioning large buildings; thermoelastic cooling using a smart metal alloy stretching and relaxing. Many Stirling cycle heat engines can be run backwards to act as a refrigerator, and therefore these engines have a niche use in cryogenics. In addition, there are other types of cryocoolers such as Gifford-McMahon coolers, Joule-Thomson coolers, pulse-tube refrigerators and, for temperatures between 2 mK and 500 mK, dilution refrigerators.

===Elastocaloric refrigeration===
Another potential solid-state refrigeration technique and a relatively new area of study comes from a special property of super elastic materials. These materials undergo a temperature change when experiencing an applied mechanical stress (called the elastocaloric effect). Since super elastic materials deform reversibly at high strains, the material experiences a flattened elastic region in its stress-strain curve caused by a resulting phase transformation from an austenitic to a martensitic crystal phase.

When a super elastic material experiences a stress in the austenitic phase, it undergoes an exothermic phase transformation to the martensitic phase, which causes the material to heat up. Removing the stress reverses the process, restores the material to its austenitic phase, and absorbs heat from the surroundings cooling down the material.

The most appealing part of this research is how potentially energy efficient and environmentally friendly this cooling technology is. The different materials used, commonly shape-memory alloys, provide a non-toxic source of emission free refrigeration. The most commonly studied materials studied are shape-memory alloys, like nitinol and Cu-Zn-Al. Nitinol is of the more promising alloys with output heat at about 66 J/cm3 and a temperature change of about 16–20 K. Due to the difficulty in manufacturing some of the shape memory alloys, alternative materials like natural rubber have been studied. Even though rubber may not give off as much heat per volume (12 J/cm3 ) as the shape memory alloys, it still generates a comparable temperature change of about 12 K and operates at a suitable temperature range, low stresses, and low cost.

The main challenge however comes from potential energy losses in the form of hysteresis, often associated with this process. Since most of these losses comes from incompatibilities between the two phases, proper alloy tuning is necessary to reduce losses and increase reversibility and efficiency. Balancing the transformation strain of the material with the energy losses enables a large elastocaloric effect to occur and potentially a new alternative for refrigeration.

===Fridge Gate===
The Fridge Gate method is a theoretical application of using a single logic gate to drive a refrigerator in the most energy efficient way possible without violating the laws of thermodynamics. It operates on the fact that there are two energy states in which a particle can exist: the ground state and the excited state. The excited state carries a little more energy than the ground state, small enough so that the transition occurs with high probability. There are three components or particle types associated with the fridge gate. The first is on the interior of the refrigerator, the second on the outside and the third is connected to a power supply which heats up every so often that it can reach the E state and replenish the source. In the cooling step on the inside of the refrigerator, the g state particle absorbs energy from ambient particles, cooling them, and itself jumping to the e state. In the second step, on the outside of the refrigerator where the particles are also at an e state, the particle falls to the g state, releasing energy and heating the outside particles. In the third and final step, the power supply moves a particle at the e state, and when it falls to the g state it induces an energy-neutral swap where the interior e particle is replaced by a new g particle, restarting the cycle.

===Passive systems===
When combining a passive daytime radiative cooling system with thermal insulation and evaporative cooling, one study found a 300% increase in ambient cooling power when compared to a stand-alone radiative cooling surface, which could extend the shelf life of food by 40% in humid climates and 200% in desert climates without refrigeration. The system&#x27;s evaporative cooling layer would require water &quot;re-charges&quot; every 10 days to a month in humid areas and every 4 days in hot and dry areas.

==Capacity ratings==

The refrigeration capacity of a refrigeration system is the product of the evaporators&#x27; enthalpy rise and the evaporators&#x27; mass flow rate. The measured capacity of refrigeration is often dimensioned in the unit of kW or BTU/h. Domestic and commercial refrigerators may be rated in kJ/s, or Btu/h of cooling. For commercial and industrial refrigeration systems, the kilowatt (kW) is the basic unit of refrigeration, except in North America, where both ton of refrigeration and BTU/h are used.

A refrigeration system&#x27;s coefficient of performance (CoP) is very important in determining a system&#x27;s overall efficiency. It is defined as refrigeration capacity in kW divided by the energy input in kW. While CoP is a very simple measure of performance, it is typically not used for industrial refrigeration in North America. Owners and manufacturers of these systems typically use performance factor (PF). A system&#x27;s PF is defined as a system&#x27;s energy input in horsepower divided by its refrigeration capacity in TR. Both CoP and PF can be applied to either the entire system or to system components. For example, an individual compressor can be rated by comparing the energy needed to run the compressor versus the expected refrigeration capacity based on inlet volume flow rate. It is important to note that both CoP and PF for a refrigeration system are only defined at specific operating conditions, including temperatures and thermal loads. Moving away from the specified operating conditions can dramatically change a system&#x27;s performance.

Air conditioning systems used in residential application typically use SEER (Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio)for the energy performance rating. Air conditioning systems for commercial application often use EER (Energy Efficiency Ratio) and IEER (Integrated Energy Efficiency Ratio) for the energy efficiency performance rating.

<text>Charles Lane Poor (January 18, 1866 – September 27, 1951) was an American astronomy professor, noted for his opposition to Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity.

==Biography==
He was born on January 18, 1866, in Hackensack, New Jersey, to Edward Erie Poor.

He graduated from the City College of New York and received a PhD in 1892 from Johns Hopkins University. Poor became an astronomer and professor of celestial mechanics at Columbia University from 1903 to 1944, when he was named Professor Emeritus. He published several works disputing the evidence for Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity during the 1920s, and reflecting objections to the theory.

For 25 years, Poor was chairman of the admissions committee of the New York Yacht Club. In addition, he was a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society and an associate fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He served several terms as mayor of Dering Harbor on Long Island, New York. Poor also invented a circular slide rule used with a sextant for yachting navigation. At Columbia University, Poor was a teacher of the astronomer Samuel A. Mitchell, who went on to become director of the Leander McCormick Observatory at the University of Virginia.

He died on September 27, 1951.

==Legacy==
One of Poor&#x27;s sons, Edmund Ward Poor, was one of ten co-founders of Grumman Aircraft on Long Island. Another son was Alfred Easton Poor, an architect.

<text>Kenneth Wolstenholme, DFC &amp; Bar (17 July 1920 – 25 March 2002) was an English football commentator for BBC television in the 1950s and 1960s. He is best remembered for his commentary during the 1966 FIFA World Cup Final; in the closing minutes, Wolstenholme commented on a series of pitch invaders as Geoff Hurst dribbled down the pitch before scoring, saying &quot;some people are on the pitch, they think it&#x27;s all over!&quot; The phrase has become deeply embedded in British popular culture. As Hurst proceeded to score, Wolstenholme added: &#x27;It is now!&#x27;

==Early life==
Wolstenholme was born in Worsley, Lancashire. His family were Primitive Methodists and his brother attended Elmfield College. He attended Farnworth Grammar School, where Alan Ball Jr. (on whom Wolstenholme commentated in the 1966 World Cup Final) was also a pupil some years later. Wolstenholme began his career as a journalist with a newspaper in Manchester.

===Military service===
As Wolstenholme was a member of the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, he was soon called up at the outbreak of the Second World War. By 1941, he had qualified as a bomber pilot and was posted to 107 Squadron, flying Bristol Blenheim Mk. IVs out of RAF Great Massingham, Norfolk. At the start of 1943 he transferred to de Havilland Mosquito with 105 Squadron, part of Air Vice-Marshal Don Bennett&#x27;s No. 8 Group RAF Pathfinder Group.

Wolstenholme completed more than 100 highly hazardous sorties over Occupied Europe and in May 1944 was awarded the DFC. The following year, he won a Bar to his DFC for his continual bravery in raids on Germany in a period of exceptionally heavy night fighter activity. He finished the war as an acting squadron leader, having spent its last stages working in the RAF&#x27;s public relations department.

==Sports broadcasting==
After the war, he became a freelance journalist, working for BBC Radio before moving to television in 1950. In 1955, he provided a location report from Salford for the BBC&#x27;s coverage of that year&#x27;s election night coverage.

He covered the 1959 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final between Kilkenny and Waterford for BBC Television, an experience which moved him to describe hurling as his second-favourite sport in the world after his first love, football.

In March 1954, Kenneth Wolstenholme and Barney Mulrenan co-commentated on the first football match to be broadcast on TV in Wales, South Wales Amateur Football League v the Worcestershire Football Combination from the Maindy Stadium in Cardiff 

Wolstenholme commentated on many English domestic football games of the 1950s and 1960s, including the first ever game featured on &quot;Match of the Day&quot; in 1964. He covered the FA Cup final in 1951 and then every year from 1953 to 1971, the year of Arsenal&#x27;s &quot;double&quot;. For the BBC he commentated on the 1960 European Cup Final between Real Madrid and Eintracht Frankfurt at Hampden Park, widely regarded as one of the greatest football matches ever played. Real won the match 7-3 before a record European Cup Final crowd of 127,000, all their goals scored by Puskas and di Stefano.

===&quot;They think it&#x27;s all over&quot;===
Wolstenholme&#x27;s unscripted delivery in the closing moments of the 1966 FIFA World Cup Final at Wembley Stadium included fourteen words that are among the best known in British sport commentary. With England leading 3–2 against West Germany, a small pitch invasion took place during injury time just as Geoff Hurst scored to put England 4–2 ahead. The events prompted Wolstenholme to say:
&quot;It is now&quot; was added in an almost matter-of-fact way after Hurst had scored the goal. Since 1966, the phrase &quot;they think it&#x27;s all over&quot; has become well known in modern English. Although unrehearsed, and spoken in the particular circumstances of the game, the words echoed to an extent those of German commentator Herbert Zimmermann – &quot;It&#x27;s over! Over! Over! Germany are the World Champions&quot; – when West Germany won the 1954 World Cup against Hungary.

===Later career===
After the 1966 World Cup, Wolstenholme continued his broadcasting career in the UK and Europe. In 1967 he travelled to the Estádio Nacional in Lisbon to cover Celtic overcoming Internazionale in the European Cup Final. A year later, he commentated at Wembley as Manchester United defeated Benfica to take the 1968 European Cup. He was the BBC&#x27;s main man at the 1970 World Cup but he almost took out an injunction when the BBC threatened to demote him in favour of David Coleman if England reached the final. Wolstenholme commentated on the final between Brazil and Italy. He left the corporation in 1971 after Coleman was installed as the BBC&#x27;s top commentator, his final BBC commentary being on the 1971 European Cup Final between Ajax and Panathinaikos at Wembley Stadium.

Wolstenholme later commentated for Tyne Tees Television in the mid to late 1970s, but re-appeared on TV to provide reports and occasional features for Channel 4 when they earned rights in the early 1990s to show Serie A games from Italy, but ill health forced him to retire. He also took on an acting role, appearing in the BBC Radio 4 comedy series &quot;Lenin of the Rovers&quot; in 1988 as football commentator Frank Lee Brian. In 1990, he was a guest star on the first episode of parody satellite television station KYTV on BBC2. 

Wolstenholme, who had been a supporter of Bolton Wanderers since childhood, was a guest of honour at the club&#x27;s final game at Burnden Park in April 1997. He also narrated the club&#x27;s &quot;End of an Era&quot; video which was released as part of Bolton&#x27;s move from Burnden Park to the Reebok Stadium.

In 1998, Wolstenholme made a special appearance in EA Sports&#x27; videogame &quot;World Cup 98&quot;, as the sole commentator on the game&#x27;s classic World Cup matches, recreations of historic World Cup finals that included sepia-toned renditions of the 1930 and 1938 editions.

==Legacy==
His phrase was used as the title for the sports quiz programme &quot;They Think It&#x27;s All Over&quot;.

The words &quot;They think it&#x27;s all over, it is now&quot; are engraved on a flagstone in Churchgate, in Bolton town centre, alongside quotes from other celebrities from Bolton.

Bill Oddie wrote a song about Wolstenholme for the BBC Radio comedy show &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry, I&#x27;ll Read That Again&quot; which includes the lines: &quot;I&#x27;m going Wolsten-home/And you can&#x27;t get Wolsten &quot;(worse than)&quot; him!&quot; In another sketch on &quot;ISIRTA&quot; a contestant in a television quiz show was awarded Wolstenholme as a prize.

==Personal life==
In 1944 he married his wife, Joan. She died in 1997. They had two daughters, one of whom predeceased him.

Wolstenholme lived in Galmpton, Torbay, Devon until his death.

<doc id="46247" wikidata="Q151789" url="?curid=46247" title="Peter III of Russia">
<text>Peter III Fyodorovich (; ) was Emperor of Russia from 5 January 1762 until 9 July of the same year, when he was overthrown by his wife, Catherine II (the Great). He was born in the German city of Kiel as Charles Peter Ulrich of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp (), the grandson of Peter the Great and great-grandson of Charles XI of Sweden.

After a 186-day reign, Peter III was overthrown in a palace coup d&#x27;état orchestrated by his wife and soon died under unclear circumstances. The official cause proposed by Catherine&#x27;s new government was that he died due to hemorrhoids. However, this explanation was met with skepticism, both in Russia and abroad, with notable critics such as Voltaire and d&#x27;Alembert expressing doubt about the plausibility of death from such a condition.

The personality and activities of Peter III were long disregarded by historians and his figure was seen as purely negative, but since the 1990s, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, more attention has been directed at the decrees he signed. His most notable reforms were the abolition of the secret police, exemption of nobles from compulsory military service, attempts to secularise church lands and create the first Russian state bank, and equalisation of all religions. He also put an end to the persecution of the Old Believers. Although he is mostly criticised for forming an alliance with Prussia (undoing Russian gains in the Seven Years&#x27; War), Catherine continued it and many of his other policies.

After Peter III&#x27;s death, many impostors thrived, pretending to be him, the most famous of whom were Yemelyan Pugachev and the &quot;Montenegerin Tsar Peter III&quot; (Stephan the Little).

==Early life==

Peter was born in Kiel, in the duchy of Holstein-Gottorp. His parents were Charles Frederick, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, and Grand Duchess Anna Petrovna of Russia. Charles Frederick was a grandson of Charles XI of Sweden, and Anna was a daughter of the Russian monarchs Peter the Great and Catherine I. Peter&#x27;s mother died shortly after his birth. In 1739, Peter&#x27;s father died, and he became Duke of Holstein-Gottorp as Charles Peter Ulrich () at the age of 11.

When Peter&#x27;s maternal aunt Elizabeth became Empress of Russia, she brought Peter from Germany to Russia and proclaimed him her heir presumptive in the autumn of 1742. Previously in 1742, the 14-year-old Peter was proclaimed King of Finland during the Russo-Swedish War (1741–1743), when Russian troops held Finland. This proclamation was based on his succession rights to territories held by his childless great-uncle, the late Charles XII of Sweden, who also had been Grand Duke of Finland. About the same time, in October 1742, he was chosen by the Swedish parliament to become heir presumptive to the Swedish throne. However, the Swedish parliament was unaware of the fact that he had also been proclaimed heir presumptive to the throne of Russia, and when their envoy arrived in Saint Petersburg in November, it was too late. Also in November, Peter converted to Eastern Orthodoxy under the name of Pyotr Feodorovich, and was created Grand Duke of Russia. The words &quot;Grandson of Peter the Great&quot; () were made an obligatory part of his official title, underscoring his dynastic claim to the Russian throne, and it was made a criminal offence to omit them.

Empress Elizabeth arranged for Peter to marry his second cousin, Sophia Augusta Frederica (later Catherine the Great), daughter of Christian August, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst, and Princess Joanna Elisabeth of Holstein-Gottorp. Sophia formally converted to Russian Orthodoxy and took the name Ekaterina Alexeievna (i.e., Catherine). They married on 21 August 1745. The marriage was not a happy one but produced one son, the future Emperor Paul I, and one daughter, Anna Petrovna (9 December, 1757– 8 March, 1759). Catherine later claimed in her private writings that Paul was not fathered by Peter; that, in fact, they had never consummated the marriage. During the sixteen years of their residence in Oranienbaum, Catherine took numerous lovers, while her husband did the same in the beginning.

=== Character ===
The classical view of Peter&#x27;s character is mainly drawn out of the memoirs of his wife and successor. She described him as an &quot;idiot&quot; and as a &quot;drunkard from Holstein&quot;, also describing her marriage with him with &quot;there is nothing worse than having a child-husband&quot;; even Peter&#x27;s idol, Frederick the Great mentioned him by saying &quot;he allowed himself to be dethroned like a child sent off to bed&quot;.

This portrait of Peter can be found in most history books, including the 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;:

There have been many attempts to revise the traditional characterization of Peter and his policies. The Russian historian A. S. Mylnikov views Peter III very differently:
The German historian Elena Palmer goes even further, portraying Peter III as a cultured, open-minded emperor who tried to introduce various courageous, even democratic reforms in 18th-century Russia. A monument for Peter III stands in Kiel, the city of his birth.

==Reign==
===Foreign policy===

After Peter succeeded to the Russian throne (), he withdrew Russian forces from the Seven Years&#x27; War and concluded a peace treaty () with Prussia (dubbed the &quot;Second Miracle of the House of Brandenburg&quot;). He gave up Russian conquests in Prussia and offered 12,000 troops to make an alliance with Frederick II of Prussia (). Russia thus switched from an enemy of Prussia to an ally—Russian troops withdrew from Berlin and marched against the Austrians. This dramatically shifted the balance of power in Europe, suddenly handing the delighted Frederick the initiative. Frederick recaptured southern Silesia (October 1762) and subsequently forced Austria to the negotiating table.

As Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, Peter planned war against Denmark-Norway in order to restore parts of Schleswig to his Duchy. He focused on making alliances with Sweden and with Great Britain to ensure that they would not interfere on Denmark&#x27;s behalf, while Russian forces gathered at Kolberg in Russian-occupied Pomerania. Alarmed at the Russian troops concentrating near their borders, unable to find any allies to resist Russian aggression, and short of money to fund a war, the government of Denmark threatened in late June to invade the free city of Hamburg in northern Germany to force a loan from it. Peter considered this a &quot;casus belli&quot; and prepared for open warfare against Denmark.

In June 1762, 40,000 Russian troops assembled in Pomerania under General Pyotr Rumyantsev, preparing to face 27,000 Danish troops under the French general Count St. Germain in case the Russian–Danish freedom conference (scheduled for 1 July 1762 in Berlin under the patronage of Frederick II) failed to resolve the issue. However, shortly before the conference, Peter lost his throne () and the conference did not occur. The issue of Schleswig remained unresolved. Peter was accused of planning an unpatriotic war.

While historically Peter&#x27;s planned war against Denmark-Norway was seen as a political failure, recent scholarship has portrayed it as part of a pragmatic plan to secure his Holstein-Gottorp duchy and to expand the common Holstein-Russian power northward and westwards. Peter believed gaining territory and influence in Denmark and Northern Germany was more useful to Russia than taking East Prussia. Equally, he thought that friendship with Prussia and with Britain, following its triumph in the Seven Years War, could offer more to aid his plans than alliance with either Austria or France.

===Domestic reforms===
During his 186-day period of government, Peter III passed 220 new laws that he had developed and elaborated during his life as a crown prince. Writer Elena Palmer claims that his reforms were of a democratic nature and that he also proclaimed religious freedom.

Peter exempted nobles from compulsory civil and military service during peacetime and allowed them to freely travel abroad. He forbade landowners from murdering peasants at the penalty of lifelong exile and ended the persecution of the Old Believers. He also issued a manifesto proclaiming the secularisation of church lands, which he never lived to see realised but which Catherine, a convinced secularist, began implementing during her own reign.

While Catherine continued some of Peter&#x27;s policies, she also reversed others. For example, Peter abolished the Secret Chancellery, the secret police of the Russian Empire, stating that he objected to the arbitrary arrests and torture it carried out. Catherine soon reestablished it under a different name, the Secret Expedition.

Peter III&#x27;s economic policy reflected the rising influence of Western capitalism and the merchant class or &quot;Third Estate&quot; that accompanied it. He established the first state bank in Russia, rejected the nobility&#x27;s monopoly on trade and encouraged mercantilism by increasing grain exports and forbidding the import of sugar and other materials that could be found in Russia.

==Overthrow and death==

Tsar Peter III was seen as a largely ineffective and unpopular ruler. He was a German-born prince of Prussia, and his loyalty to his native land over his inherited one earned him the ire of his people and his army. Peter had returned Russia’s conquered territories back to Prussia and withdrawn his forces from the Seven Years’ War, rendering all of Russia’s recent victories, and its sacrifices, pointless.

Many in the Russian army, as well as Russian citizens and Empress Catherine herself, feared that if Peter continued his concessions to Prussia it would lead to a nationwide uprising and threaten the stability of Russia. In the spring of 1762, conspiring with her lover Grigory Orlov and others in the court and military, Catherine began plotting to overthrow her husband. 

At dawn on June 28, 1762, Catherine marched with a procession of civilian and military supporters to the Winter Palace, where she was proclaimed heir to the Russian throne by the archbishop of Novgorod. Peter tried to escape by taking a boat to the military base of Kronstadt on Kotlin Island, hoping that the fleet remained loyal to him. However, the fleet&#x27;s cannons opened fire on Peter&#x27;s boat with two or three shots, and he was repulsed back to the shore, with the commandant declaring that he was no longer recognized as emperor and that Russia was ruled by Empress Catherine. The people of St. Petersburg, drawn to the shore by the loud echoes of cannons, also armed themselves with sticks and stones to prevent him from returning to the capital city. Twenty four hours later, after learning that the senate, army, and fleet had sworn allegiance to Catherine, with the aid of two guards whom Peter had planned to discipline, he was arrested and forced to abdicate on .

Shortly thereafter, he was transported to Ropsha, where he later died. Much mystery surrounds his death. The official cause, after an autopsy, was a severe attack of hemorrhoidal colic and an apoplectic stroke, while others say he was assassinated. Other accounts state that after a midday meal, Peter&#x27;s captors tried to suffocate him by using a mattress but he managed to escape. This then led his captors to strangle him to death with a scarf. He was buried on 3 August 1762 [O.S. 23 July] in the Alexander Nevsky Monastery, Saint Petersburg.

==Legacy==

After his death, four pretenders to the throne, insisting that they were Peter (five if Šćepan Mali of Montenegro is included) came forth, supported by revolts among the people, who believed in a rumor that Peter had not died but had been secretly imprisoned by Catherine. The most famous was the Cossack Yemelyan Pugachev, who led what came to be known as Pugachev&#x27;s Rebellion in 1774, which was ultimately crushed by Catherine&#x27;s forces. In addition, Kondratii Selivanov, who led a castrating sect known as the Skoptsy, claimed to be both Jesus and Peter III.

In December 1796, after succeeding Catherine, Peter&#x27;s son, Emperor Paul I, who disliked his mother&#x27;s behavior, arranged for Peter&#x27;s remains to be exhumed and reburied with full honors in the Peter and Paul Cathedral, where other tsars (Russian emperors) were buried.

===Lore===
The legend of Peter is still talked about, especially in the town where he lived most of his life, formerly Oranienbaum, later Lomonosov, situated on the southern coast of the Gulf of Finland, 40 km west of St. Petersburg. Peter&#x27;s palace is the only one of the famous palaces in the St. Petersburg area that was not captured by the Germans during the Second World War. During the war, the building was a school and people say the ghost of Peter protected the children of Oranienbaum from getting hurt by bombs. Furthermore, it was near this town that the siege of Leningrad ended in January 1944. People say that Peter, after his death, stopped Hitler&#x27;s army near Leningrad, just as the living Peter had ordered the Russian army to stop, just as it was about to capture Konigsberg.
==Cultural references==
Peter has been depicted on screen a number of times, almost always in films concerning his wife Catherine. He was portrayed by Rudolf Klein-Rogge in the 1927 film &quot;The Loves of Casanova&quot;, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. in the 1934 film &quot;The Rise of Catherine the Great&quot; and by Sam Jaffe in &quot;The Scarlet Empress&quot; the same year. In 1991 Reece Dinsdale portrayed him in the television series &quot;Young Catherine&quot;. &quot;La Tempesta&quot; (1958) depicts Yemelyan Pugachev&#x27;s effort to force his recognition as Peter III and offers a critical view of Catherine the Great, with Van Heflin in the role of Pugachev and Viveca Lindfors as Catherine. He was also depicted as a cowardly, drunken wife-beater in the Japanese anime &quot;Le Chevalier D&#x27;Eon&quot;. He also appears in the 2014 TV series played by Aleksandr Yatsenko. A historically inaccurate version of him was played by Nicholas Hoult in the 2020–2023 Hulu dramedy series &quot;The Great&quot;, also starring Elle Fanning as Catherine.

<text>Fox Broadcasting Company, LLC (commonly known as Fox and stylized logo-wise in all caps) is an American commercial broadcast television network serving as the flagship property of Fox Corporation and operated through Fox Entertainment. Fox is based at Fox Corporation&#x27;s corporate headquarters at 1211 Avenue of the Americas in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, and it hosts additional offices at the Fox Network Center in Los Angeles and at the Fox Media Center in Tempe, Arizona. The channel was launched by News Corporation on October 9, 1986 as a competitor to the Big Three television networks, which are the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), and the National Broadcasting Company (NBC). Fox went on to become the most successful attempt at a fourth television network; it was also the highest-rated free-to-air network in the 18–49 demographic from 2004 to 2012 and 2020 to 2021 and was the most-watched American television network in total viewership during the 2007–08 season. It is a member of the North American Broadcasters Association and the National Association of Broadcasters. Fox&#x27;s news division, Fox News, does not have network newscasts, instead relying on a 24-hour cable network. 
Fox and its affiliated companies operate many entertainment channels in international markets, but these do not necessarily air the same programming as the U.S. network. Most viewers in Canada have access to at least one U.S.-based Fox affiliate, either over the air or through a pay television provider, although Fox&#x27;s National Football League broadcasts and most of its prime time programming are subject to simultaneous substitution regulations for pay television providers imposed by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to protect rights held by domestically based networks. Like Canada, Fox programming is available in Mexico through free-to-air affiliates in markets located within proximity to the Mexico–United States border whose signals are readily receivable over-the-air in border areas of northern Mexico. In Central America, the Dominican Republic, Peru, Colombia and the Caribbean, many subscription providers carry either select U.S.-based Fox-affiliated stations or the main network feed from Fox O&amp;Os WNYW in New York City or WSVN in Miami. In addition, the network&#x27;s programming has been available in the U.S. Virgin Islands since 2011 on WVXF in Charlotte Amalie (owned by Caribbean Broadcasting Network, LLC).

==History==
===Origins===
20th Century Fox (now 20th Century Studios) had been involved in television production as early as the 1950s, producing several syndicated programs. Following the closure of the DuMont Television Network in August 1956, after it became mired in severe financial problems, the NTA Film Network was launched as a new &quot;fourth network&quot;. 20th Century Fox would also produce original content for the NTA network. The film network effort would fail after a few years, but 20th Century Fox continued to dabble in television through its production arm, TCF Television Productions, producing series (such as &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;) for the three major broadcast television networks (ABC, NBC, and CBS).

The Fox television network&#x27;s foundations were laid in March 1985 through News Corporation&#x27;s $255 million purchase of a 50% interest in TCF Holdings, the parent company of the 20th Century Fox film studio. In May 1985, News Corporation, a media company owned by Australian publishing magnate Rupert Murdoch that had mainly served as a newspaper publisher at the time of the TCF Holdings deal, agreed to pay $2.55 billion to acquire independent television stations in six major U.S. cities from the John Kluge-run broadcasting company Metromedia: WNEW-TV in New York City, WTTG in Washington, D.C., KTTV in Los Angeles, KRIV-TV in Houston, WFLD-TV in Chicago, and KRLD-TV in Dallas. A seventh station, ABC affiliate WCVB-TV in Boston, was part of the original transaction but was spun off to the Hearst Broadcasting subsidiary of the Hearst Communications in a separate, concurrent deal as part of a right of first refusal related to that station&#x27;s 1982 sale to Metromedia. (Two years later, News Corporation acquired WXNE-TV in that market from the Christian Broadcasting Network and changed its call letters to WFXT.)

Radio personality Clarke Ingram suggested that the Fox network is a revival or at least a linear descendant of DuMont, since Metromedia was founded when DuMont spun off its two remaining owned-and-operated stations, WNEW-TV (then known as WABD) and WTTG, as DuMont Broadcasting (it later changed its name to Metropolitan Broadcasting before becoming Metromedia). Additionally, the former base of DuMont&#x27;s operations, the DuMont Tele-Centre in Manhattan, eventually became the present-day Fox Television Center.

====Beginning of the network====

In October 1985, 20th Century Fox announced its intentions to form a fourth television network that would compete with ABC, CBS, and NBC. The plans were to use the combination of the Fox studios and the former Metromedia stations to both produce and distribute programming. Organizational plans for the network were held off until the Metromedia acquisitions cleared regulatory hurdles. Then, in December 1985, Rupert Murdoch agreed to pay $325 million to acquire the remaining equity in TCF Holdings from his original partner, Marvin Davis. The purchase of the Metromedia stations was approved by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in March 1986; the call letters of the New York City and Dallas outlets were subsequently changed respectively to WNYW and KDAF. These first six stations, then broadcasting to a combined reach of 22% of the nation&#x27;s households, became known as the Fox Television Stations group. With the sole exception of KDAF (which was sold to Renaissance Broadcasting in 1995, at which time it became an affiliate of The WB), all of the original owned-and-operated stations (&quot;O&amp;Os&quot;) are still part of the Fox network today. Like the core O&amp;O group, Fox&#x27;s affiliate body initially consisted of independent stations (a few of which had maintained affiliations with ABC, NBC, CBS, or DuMont earlier in their existences). The local charter affiliate was, in most cases, that market&#x27;s top-rated independent; however, Fox opted to affiliate with a second-tier independent station in markets where a more established independent declined the affiliation (such as Denver, Phoenix and St. Louis). Largely because of both these factors, Fox in a situation very similar to what DuMont had experienced four decades before had little choice but to affiliate with UHF stations in all except a few (mainly larger) markets where the network gained clearance. Then-Fox Inc. head Barry Diller was acknowledged to have been the one who created the network, with the &quot;New York Times&quot; noting in October 1986 that Diller&#x27;s &quot;current obsession is creating a television network to compete each evening with NBC, CBS and ABC.&quot;

The Fox television network officially debuted with a soft launch at 11:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time on Thursday, October 9, 1986. Its inaugural program was a late-night talk show, &quot;The Late Show&quot;, which was hosted by comedian Joan Rivers. After a strong start, &quot;The Late Show&quot; quickly eroded in the ratings; it was never able to overtake NBC stalwart &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. By early 1987, Rivers (and her then-husband Edgar Rosenberg, the show&#x27;s original executive producer) quit &quot;The Late Show&quot; after disagreements with the network over the show&#x27;s creative direction, the program then began to be hosted by a succession of guest hosts. After that point, some stations that affiliated with FBC in the weeks before the April 1987 launch of its prime time lineup (such as WCGV-TV in Milwaukee and WDRB-TV in Louisville) signed affiliation agreements with the network on the condition that they would not have to carry &quot;The Late Show&quot; due to the program&#x27;s weak ratings.

Shortly before the official launch of FBC on April 5, 1987, under original Fox Entertainment President Garth Ancier, the network underwent a re-branding to the much shorter &quot;Fox&quot;. According to an interview Ancier gave at that time, it was ad man Jay Chiat who suggested to network executives that, rather than create a brand from scratch, the network ought to use the &quot;Fox&quot; heritage of the previous 80 years and the &quot;searchlight&quot; iconography to link Fox Broadcasting to 20th Century Fox. Until late in the game during the 1980s, several station groups like Media Central and Pappas Telecasting had avoided Fox when the network launched, but joined the network later on.

The network had its &quot;grand opening&quot; when it expanded its programming into prime time on April 5, 1987, inaugurating its Sunday night lineup with the premieres of the sitcom &quot;Married... with Children&quot; and the sketch comedy series &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot;. The premieres of both series were rebroadcast twice following their initial airings (at 7:00 p.m. and 7:30 pm. Eastern/Pacific, respectively) that night, which Jamie Kellner, who served as the network&#x27;s president and chief operating officer until his resignation in January 1993, stated would allow viewers to &quot;sample FBC programming without missing &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, or the 8 o&#x27;clock movies&quot;. Fox added one new show per week over the next several weeks, with the drama &quot;21 Jump Street&quot; and comedies &quot;Mr. President&quot; and &quot;Duet&quot; completing its Sunday schedule. On July 11, 1987, the network rolled out its Saturday night schedule with the premiere of the supernatural drama series &quot;Werewolf&quot;, which began with a two-hour pilot movie event. Three other series were added to the Saturday lineup over the next three weeks: comedies &quot;The New Adventures of Beans Baxter&quot;, &quot;Karen&#x27;s Song&quot;, and &quot;Down and Out in Beverly Hills&quot; (the latter being an adaptation of the film of the same name). Both &quot;Karen&#x27;s Song&quot; and &quot;Down and Out in Beverly Hills&quot; were canceled by the start of the 1987–88 television season, the network&#x27;s first fall launch, and were replaced by the sitcoms &quot;Second Chance&quot; and &quot;Women in Prison&quot;.

In regard to its late night lineup, Fox had already decided to cancel &quot;The Late Show&quot;, and had a replacement series in development, &quot;The Wilton North Report&quot;, when the former series began a ratings resurgence under its final guest host, comedian Arsenio Hall. &quot;Wilton North&quot; lasted just a few weeks, however, and the network was unable to reach a deal with Hall to return as host when it hurriedly revived &quot;The Late Show&quot; in early 1988. &quot;The Late Show&quot; went back to featuring guest hosts, eventually selecting Ross Shafer as its permanent host, only for it to be canceled for good by October 1988, while Hall signed a deal with Paramount Television to develop his own syndicated late night talk show, &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot;. Fox aired the 39th Primetime Emmy Awards and would air the next five editions.

Although the network had modest successes in &quot;Married... with Children&quot; and &quot;The Tracy Ullman Show&quot;, several affiliates were disappointed with Fox&#x27;s largely underperforming programming lineup during the network&#x27;s first three years, KMSP-TV in Minneapolis and KPTV in Portland, Oregon, both owned at the time by Chris-Craft Television, disaffiliated from Fox in 1988 (with KITN (now WFTC) and KPDX respectively replacing those stations as Fox affiliates), citing that the network&#x27;s weaker program offerings were hampering viewership of their stronger syndicated slate.

At the start of the 1989–90 television season, Fox added a third night of programming, on Mondays. The season heralded the start of a turnaround for Fox. It saw the debut of a midseason replacement series, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, an animated series that originated as a series of shorts on &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot;. Ranked at a three-way tie for 29th place in the Nielsen ratings, it became a breakout hit and was the first Fox series to break the Top 30. &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, at 35 years as of 2024, is the longest-running American sitcom, the longest-running American animated program, and the longest-running American scripted primetime television series.

In 1989, Fox also first introduced the documentary series &quot;Cops&quot; and crime-focused magazine program &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; (the latter of which debuted as a half-hour series as part of the network&#x27;s mainly comedy-based Sunday lineup for its first season, before expanding to an hour and moving to Fridays for the 1990–91 season). These two series, which would become staples on the network for just over two decades, would eventually be paired to form the nucleus of Fox&#x27;s Saturday night schedule beginning in the 1994–95 season. Meanwhile, &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, which differentiated itself from other family sitcoms of the period as it centered on a dysfunctional lower-middle-class family, saw viewer interest substantially increase beginning in its third season after Michigan homemaker Terry Rakolta began a boycott to force Fox to cancel the series after objecting to risqué humor and sexual content featured in a 1989 episode. &quot;Married...&quot;″s newfound success led it to become the network&#x27;s longest-running live-action sitcom, airing for 11 seasons.

===1990s: Rise into mainstream success and beginnings of rivalry with the Big Three===
Fox survived where DuMont and other attempts to start a fourth network had failed because it programmed just under the number of hours defined by the FCC to legally be considered a network. This allowed Fox to make revenue in ways forbidden to the established networks (for instance, it did not have to adhere to the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules that were in effect at the time), since during its first years it was considered to be merely a large group of stations. By comparison, DuMont had been saddled by numerous regulatory barriers that hampered its potential to grow, most notably a ban on acquiring additional stations, during an era when the FCC had much tighter ownership limits for television stations (limiting broadcasters to a maximum of five stations nationwide) than it did when Fox launched. In addition, Murdoch was more than willing to open his wallet to get and keep programming and talent. DuMont, in contrast, operated on a shoestring budget and was unable to keep the programs and stars it had.

Most of the other startup networks that launched in later years (such as UPN and The WB) followed Fox&#x27;s model as well. Furthermore, DuMont operated during a time when the FCC did not require television manufacturers to include UHF capability. To see DuMont&#x27;s UHF stations, most people had to buy an expensive converter. Even then, the signal quality was marginal at best compared to the signals of VHF stations . By the time Fox launched, cable allowed UHF stations to generally be on an equal footing with VHF stations.

Although Fox was growing rapidly as a network and had established itself as a presence, it was still not considered a major competitor to the established &quot;Big Three&quot; broadcast networks, ABC, CBS, and NBC. From its launch, Fox had the advantage of offering programs intended to appeal toward a younger demographic – adults between 18 and 34 years of age – and that were edgier in content, whereas some programs that were carried by the &quot;Big Three&quot; networks attracted an older-skewing audience. Until the early 1990s, when Fox expanded its programming to additional nights and outside prime time, most Fox stations were still essentially formatted as independent stations – filling their schedules with mainly first-run and acquired programming, and, during prime time, running either syndicated programs or, more commonly, movies on nights when the network did not provide programming. Few Fox stations carried local newscasts during the network&#x27;s early years, unlike the owned-and-operated stations and affiliates of its established rivals. Those that did were mostly based in larger markets (including some of the network&#x27;s O&amp;Os) and retained newscasts that had aired for decades. Even then, these news operations were limited to one newscast per day, following the network&#x27;s prime time lineup.

On September 6, 1990, Fox reached an agreement with TCI (the nation&#x27;s largest cable company at the time) in which TCI systems in markets that were not served by an over-the-air Fox affiliate at the time would become charter affiliates of a cable-only national feed of the network known as Foxnet. The cable-only network launched on June 6, 1991, bringing Fox programming to smaller markets that did not carry a default Fox affiliate at the time; it would manage to reach a total of 1.3 million subscribers by 1992.

As Fox gradually headed towards carrying a full week&#x27;s worth of programming in prime time through the addition of programming on Thursday and Friday nights at the start of the 1990–91 season, the network&#x27;s added offerings included the scheduling of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; opposite veteran NBC sitcom &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; as part of Fox&#x27;s initial Thursday night lineup that fall (along with future hit &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;, which would become the network&#x27;s longest-running drama, airing for ten seasons) after only a half-season of success on Sunday nights. The show performed well in its new Thursday slot, spending four seasons there and helping to launch &quot;Martin&quot;, another Fox comedy that became a hit when it debuted in August 1992. &quot;The Simpsons&quot; returned to Sunday nights in the fall of 1994, and has remained there ever since.

The sketch comedy series &quot;In Living Color&quot;, which debuted in April 1990, created many memorable characters and launched the careers of future movie stars Jim Carrey, Jamie Foxx, Damon Wayans, Marlon Wayans, Keenen Ivory Wayans, guest stars Chris Rock and Tim Meadows, and both members of the show&#x27;s dance troupe, the &quot;Fly Girls&quot;, Rosie Perez and Jennifer Lopez. The series also gained international prominence after Fox aired a special live episode in January 1992 as an alternative to the halftime show during Super Bowl XXVI, which was broadcast on CBS, marking the start of Fox&#x27;s rivalry with the &quot;Big Three&quot; networks while popularizing the counterprogramming strategy against the Super Bowl telecast.

The early and mid-1990s saw the debuts of several soap opera-style prime time dramas aimed at younger audiences that became quick hits, which, in addition to &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;, included its adult-focused spin-off &quot;Melrose Place&quot; (which initially had a mediocre ratings performance, before viewership rose significantly midway through its first season following Heather Locklear&#x27;s addition to the cast), its own short lived spin-off &quot;Models Inc.&quot;, and family drama &quot;Party of Five&quot;. The early and mid-1990s also saw the network launch several series aimed at a black audience, which, in addition to &quot;Martin&quot;, included the sitcom &quot;Living Single&quot; and police procedural &quot;New York Undercover&quot;.

====Luring the NFL and affiliation switches====
Despite having a few successful shows like the science fiction drama &quot;The X-Files&quot;, Fox still lacked credibility among viewers. Even those working in television thought of Fox as &quot;the one that has that cartoon show&quot; (&quot;The Simpsons&quot;). More than 85% of affiliates in 1993 were UHF stations. Fox became a viable competitor to the older networks when it won broadcast television rights to the National Football League (NFL) away from CBS. In December 1993, Fox signed a contract with the NFL to televise games from the National Football Conference (NFC)—which had been airing its games on CBS since 1956—starting with the 1994 season. The initial four-year contract, which Fox bid $1.58 billion to obtain—while CBS offered $295 million per year to retain the rights—also included the exclusive U.S. television rights to Super Bowl XXXI in 1997. The network also lured Pat Summerall, John Madden, Dick Stockton, Matt Millen, James Brown, Terry Bradshaw, and behind-the-scenes production personnel, from CBS Sports to staff its NFL coverage.

Shortly afterward, News Corporation began striking affiliation deals with, and later purchasing, more television station groups. On May 23, 1994, Fox agreed to purchase a 20% stake in New World Communications, a television and film production company controlled by investor Ronald Perelman that had just recently entered into broadcasting through its 1993 purchase of seven stations owned by SCI Television. As a result of Fox acquiring a 20% minority interest in the company, New World signed an agreement to switch the affiliations of twelve stations (eight CBS affiliates, three ABC affiliates [ two of which were subsequently placed in a blind trust and then sold directly to Fox due to conflicts with FCC ownership rules ], and one NBC affiliate) that it had either already owned outright or was in the process of acquiring from Citicasters and Argyle Communications at the time to Fox starting in September 1994 and continuing as existing affiliation contracts with their existing major network partners expired.

That summer, SF Broadcasting, a joint venture between Fox and Savoy Pictures that was founded in March 1994, purchased four stations from Burnham Broadcasting (three NBC affiliates and one ABC affiliate); through a separate agreement, those stations would also switch to Fox between September 1995 and January 1996 as existing affiliation agreements lapsed. These two deals were not the first instances in which a longtime &quot;Big Three&quot; station affiliated with Fox: in Miami, the affiliation moved from WCIX (channel 6) to NBC affiliate WSVN in January 1989 as the result of a complicated six-station affiliation swap in two South Florida markets spurred by NBC&#x27;s purchase of CBS affiliate WTVJ (channel 4) and CBS&#x27;s purchase of WCIX. WSVN immediately attracted industry notice for featuring a news-intensive tabloid format uncharacteristic of any Fox affiliate or independent station heretofore, with then-Fox network president Lucie Salhany calling WSVN &quot;the future of television&quot; in May 1994. WSVN remains the largest Fox affiliate in terms of market size to have entirely eschewed any prominent on-air branding with the network name.

The NFC contract, in fact, was the impetus for the affiliation deal with New World and SF Broadcasting&#x27;s purchase of the Burnham stations, as Fox sought to improve local coverage of its new NFL package by aligning the network with stations that had more established histories and advertiser value than its charter affiliates. The deals spurred a series of affiliation realignments between all four U.S. television networks involving individual stations and various broadcasting groups such as those between CBS and Group W (whose corporate parent later bought the network in August 1995), and ABC and the E. W. Scripps Company (which owned three Fox affiliates that switched to either ABC or NBC as a result of the New World deal) affecting 30 television markets between September 1994 and September 1996. The two deals also had the side benefit of increasing local news programming on the new Fox affiliates, mirroring the programming format adopted by WSVN upon that station&#x27;s switch to the network (as well as expanding the number of news-producing stations in Fox&#x27;s portfolio beyond mainly charter stations in certain large and mid-sized markets).

With significant market share for the first time ever and the rights to the NFL, Fox firmly established itself as the nation&#x27;s fourth major network. Fox Television Stations would acquire New World outright on July 17, 1996, in a $2.48 billion stock purchase, making the latter&#x27;s twelve Fox affiliates owned-and-operated stations of the network; the deal was completed on January 22, 1997. Later, in August 2000, Fox bought several stations owned by Chris-Craft Industries and its subsidiaries BHC Communications and United Television for $5.5 billion (most of these stations were UPN affiliates, although its Minneapolis station KMSP-TV would rejoin Fox in September 2002 as an owned-and-operated station). These purchases, for a time, made Fox Television Stations the largest owner of television stations in the U.S. (a title that has since been assumed by the Sinclair Broadcast Group, one of the network&#x27;s largest affiliate groups).

====Evolving programming====
Fox completed its prime time expansion to all seven nights on January 19, 1993, with the launch of two additional nights of programming on Tuesdays and Wednesdays (The method of gradually adding nights to the programming schedule that began with the network&#x27;s April 1987 prime time launch was replicated by The WB and UPN when those networks debuted in January 1995), making it the fifth broadcast network (behind the Dumont network) to air programming on a nightly basis. September 1993 saw the heavy promotion and debut of a short-lived western series that incorporated science-fiction elements, &quot;The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.&quot; However, it was the supernatural investigative drama that debuted immediately following it on Friday nights, &quot;The X-Files&quot;, that would find long-lasting success, and would become Fox&#x27;s first series to crack Nielsen&#x27;s year-end Top 20 most-watched network programs. After several other failed attempts at late night programming following the cancellation of &quot;The Late Show&quot; (most notably, the quick failure of &quot;The Chevy Chase Show&quot; in 1993), Fox finally found success in that time period with the debut of &quot;MADtv&quot; on October 14, 1995; the sketch comedy series became a solid competitor to NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; for over a decade and was the network&#x27;s most successful late night program as well as one of its most successful Saturday night shows, running for 14 seasons until 2009.

An attempt to make a larger effort to program Saturday nights by moving &quot;Married... with Children&quot; from its longtime Sunday slot and adding a new but short-lived sitcom (&quot;Love and Marriage&quot;) to the night at the beginning of the 1996–97 season backfired with the public, as it resulted in a brief cancellation of &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; that was criticized by law enforcement and public officials, and was roundly rejected by viewers, which brought swift cancellation to the newer series. &quot;Married...&quot; quickly returned to Sundays (before moving again to Mondays two months later); both it and &quot;Martin&quot; would end their runs at the end of that season. The Saturday schedule was revised in November 1996, to feature one new and one encore episode of &quot;Cops&quot;, and the revived &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted: America Fights Back&quot;. &quot;Cops&quot; and &quot;AMW&quot; remained the anchors of Fox&#x27;s Saturday lineup, making it the most stable night in American broadcast television for over 14 years; both shows eventually were among the few first-run programs remaining on Saturday evenings across the four major networks after decreasing prime time viewership – as more people opted to engage in leisure activities away from home rather than watch television on that night of the week led ABC, NBC and CBS to largely abandon first-run series on Saturdays (outside newsmagazines, sports and burned off prime time shows that failed on other nights) in favor of reruns and movies by the mid-2000s. &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; ended its 22-year run on Fox in June 2011, and was subsequently picked up by Lifetime (before being cancelled for good in 2013); &quot;Cops&quot;, in turn, would move its first-run episodes to Spike in 2013 after 23 seasons (ending its original run on Fox as the network&#x27;s longest-running prime time program) and had been cancelled in 2020, leaving sports and repeats of reality and drama series as the only programs airing on Fox on Saturday evenings.

During the 1997–98 season, Fox had three shows in the Nielsen Top 20 (in terms of total viewers); &quot;The X-Files&quot; (which ranked 11th), &quot;King of the Hill&quot; (which ranked 15th) and &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (which ranked 18th), all of which aired on Sunday nights. Building around its flagship animated comedy &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, Fox would experience relative success with animated sitcoms in prime time, beginning with the debut of the Mike Judge-produced &quot;King of the Hill&quot; in 1997. &quot;Family Guy&quot; (the first of three adult-oriented animated series from Seth MacFarlane to air on the network) and &quot;Futurama&quot; (from &quot;Simpsons&quot; creator Matt Groening) would make their debuts in 1999; however, they were canceled in 2002 and 2003 respectively. Due to strong DVD sales and highly rated cable reruns on Cartoon Network&#x27;s Adult Swim, Fox later decided to order new episodes of &quot;Family Guy&quot;, which began airing in 2005. &quot;Futurama&quot; would be revived with four direct-to-DVD films between 2007 and 2009 and would return as a first-run series on Comedy Central, where it ran from 2010 to 2013. Less successful efforts included &quot;The Critic&quot;, starring &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; alumnus Jon Lovitz (which Fox picked up in 1994 after it was cancelled by ABC, only for the series to be cancelled again after its second season), and &quot;The PJs&quot; (which moved to The WB in 2000, after Fox cancelled that series after its second season). Other notable shows that debuted in the late 1990s included the quirky David E. Kelley-produced live-action dramedy &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, the short-lived game show &quot;Greed&quot;, and the period comedy &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;, the latter of which became Fox&#x27;s second-longest-running live-action sitcom, airing for eight seasons.

Throughout the 1990s and into the next decade, Fox launched a slate of cable channels beginning with the 1994 debuts of general entertainment network FX and movie channel FXM: Movies from Fox (now FX Movie Channel), followed by the debut of Fox News Channel in August 1996. Its sports operations expanded with the acquisition of controlling interests in several regional sports networks (including the Prime Network and SportsChannel) between 1996 and 2000 to form Fox Sports Net (which launched in November 1996), its 2000 purchase of Speedvision (later Speed Channel, which was replaced in the United States by Fox Sports 1 in August 2013; however, it continues to exist in other North American and Caribbean countries as Fox Sports Racing), and the launches of Fox Sports World (later Fox Soccer, which was replaced by FXX in September 2013) and Fox Sports en Español (now Fox Deportes) in the early 2000s.

===2000s: Rise to ratings leadership, the &quot;American Idol&quot; effect, and fierce rivalry with CBS===
By 2000, many staple Fox shows of the 1990s had ended their runs. During the late 1990s and carrying over into the early 2000s, Fox put much of its efforts into producing reality shows many of which were considered to be sensationalistic and controversial in nature – such as &quot;Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire?&quot;, &quot;Temptation Island&quot;, &quot;Married by America&quot;, and &quot;Joe Millionaire&quot; (which became the first Fox program to crack the Nielsen Top 10), as well as video clip shows such as &quot;World&#x27;s Wildest Police Videos&quot; and &quot;When Animals Attack!&quot;. After shedding most of these programs, Fox gradually filled its lineup with acclaimed dramas such as &quot;24&quot;, &quot;The O.C.&quot;, &quot;House&quot;, and &quot;Bones&quot;, and comedies such as &quot;The Bernie Mac Show&quot;, &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot;, and &quot;Arrested Development&quot;.

As the decade wore on, Fox began surpassing ABC and NBC in the ratings, first in age demographics, then in overall viewership, and placed second behind a resurgent CBS in total viewership, beginning in 2002. Fox hit a major milestone in 2005 when it emerged as the most-watched U.S. broadcast network in the lucrative 18–49 demographic for the first time, largely boosted by the strength of the reality singing competition series &quot;American Idol&quot;. Regarded as the single most dominant program on 21st-century U.S. television, as well as the first Fox show to lead the Nielsen seasonal ratings, &quot;American Idol&quot; had peak audiences of up to 38 million viewers during the 2003 season finale and double-season average audiences of around 31 million viewers in 2006 and 2007. Subsequently, it leapfrogged over Fox&#x27;s Big Three competition to become the highest-rated U.S. television program overall starting with the 2003–04 season, becoming the first reality singing competition series in the country to reach first place in the seasonal ratings.

&quot;American Idol&quot; remains the most recent U.S. television program to date to lead the national prime time ratings and attract at least 30 million viewers for multiple and consecutive television seasons. It is the most-watched program on U.S. television by seasonal average viewership in the 2000s decade, as well as the most recent program scheduled to have successfully established a graveyard slot on U.S. television since the end of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Friends&quot; in 2004 and the subsequent decline of NBC&#x27;s previously dominant &quot;Must See TV&quot; Thursday timeblock. By 2005, reality television succeeded sitcoms as the most popular form of entertainment in the U.S. as a result of Fox&#x27;s rise with &quot;American Idol&quot; and NBC&#x27;s network declines. &quot;House&quot;, which aired as &quot;American Idol&quot;″s lead-out program on Tuesday nights, earned international prominence in the 21st century and became Fox&#x27;s first prime time drama series (and the network&#x27;s third program overall) to reach the Nielsen Top 10 beginning 2006.

Beginning 2004, CBS and Fox, which ranked as the two most-watched broadcast networks in the U.S. during the 2000s, have tended to equal one another in demographic ratings among general viewership, with both networks winning certain demographics by narrow margins; however, while Fox has the youngest-skewing viewer base, CBS is consistently regarded to have the oldest audience demographics among the major broadcast networks. Fox hit a milestone in February 2005 by scoring its first sweeps victory in total viewership and demographic ratings, boosted largely by its broadcast of Super Bowl XXXIX and the strengths of &quot;American Idol&quot;, &quot;24&quot;, &quot;House&quot;, and &quot;The O.C&quot;.

In September 2006, as a result of the increasing number of over-the-air Fox affiliates and the increased availability of digital subchannels carrying Fox in certain markets, Foxnet was discontinued. Then, a sweeping milestone came by the conclusion of the 2007–08 season on May 21, 2008, shortly after the widely acclaimed seventh-season finale of &quot;American Idol&quot;, when Fox outranked longtime leader CBS as the most-watched television network overall in the United States, attributed to the strengths of Super Bowl XLII and its NFL game coverages, &quot;Idol&quot; and &quot;House&quot; during that season. To date, Fox is the only non-Big Three network to top the overall Nielsen ratings since its inception in the 1950–51 season.

In the late 2000s, Fox launched a few series that proved to be powerful hits in different respects. In 2007, the network began production on the game shows &quot;Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader?&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget the Lyrics!&quot;; both shows ran for a total of three seasons each, making them the longest-running game shows in Fox&#x27;s history. In 2008, the supernatural mystery series &quot;Fringe&quot; debuted to moderate ratings but earned critical acclaim during its first season on Tuesdays. Throughout its run, the series developed a large loyal fanbase that turned the show into a cult favorite. In 2009, &quot;Glee&quot; premiered to average ratings when its pilot aired as a lead-out program of the eighth-season finale of &quot;American Idol&quot;, but earned positive reviews from critics. The cast of the series has been acknowledged by Barack Obama and Oprah Winfrey, who have each asked the cast to perform live for various national events.

===2010–2017: Network&#x27;s ratings collapse and revamp in network programming===
At the beginning of the 2010s, new comedies &quot;Raising Hope&quot; and &quot;New Girl&quot; gave Fox its first live-action comedy successes in years. The second season of &quot;Glee&quot; delivered that series&#x27; highest ratings during the 2010–11 season, with viewership peaking during its Super Bowl lead-out episode in February 2011 (marking the most expensive post-Super Bowl episode ever produced on U.S. television). The said show has continuously attracted worldwide media attention that it formed a large, loyal international fanbase. At the same time, Fox&#x27;s live telecast of the Super Bowl XLV helped the network emerge as the first U.S. television network to earn an average single-night prime time audience of at least 100 million viewers.

&quot;American Idol&quot; lost its first place standing among all network prime time programs during the 2011–12 finale (falling to second that season behind &quot;NBC Sunday Night Football&quot;), ending the longest streak at#1 for a prime time broadcast network series in U.S. television history, through its eight-year ratings domination in both the Adults 18–49 demographic and total viewership. &quot;Idol&quot; also remained in the Nielsen Top 10 for eleven years from 2003 to 2013, and became the highest-rated non-sports prime time television program as well as the highest-rated reality series in the U.S. from 2003 to 2012. these records marked the longest Nielsen ratings streaks of any Fox program in these categories.

The 2012 season finale of &quot;American Idol&quot; marked the end of the season-long 25th anniversary of the establishment of Fox network, helping it win in the 18–49 demographic for the eighth consecutive season, the longest such streak according to Nielsen measurement records (and still standing as of 2025). However, Fox suffered a collapse in viewership during the 2012–13 season; &quot;American Idol&quot; and &quot;Glee&quot; suffered steep ratings declines, while the network as a whole fell to third place (suffering an overall decrease by 22%) in total viewership and to second place in the 18–49 demographic (where it remained ) by the end of the season.

The decline in ratings continued into the 2013–14 season, with Fox placing fourth among the major networks in total viewership for the first time since 2001. Subsequently, on January 13, 2014, Fox announced that it would abandon its use of the standard concept of greenlighting shows through the initial order of pilot episodes during the designated &quot;pilot season&quot; (running from January through April), instead opting to pick up shows directly to series.

Fox scored renewed ratings successes with its February 2014 live telecast of Super Bowl XLVIII, which became the second most-watched television broadcast (by average) in U.S. history, and the lead-out programs that followed this event – &quot;New Girl&quot; and &quot;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&quot;. Later, in May 2014, Kevin Reilly announced that he would resign as chairman of Fox Entertainment. On July 15, 2014, then-corporate parent 21st Century Fox announced that it would merge the operations of the network and 20th Century Fox Television into the newly created Fox Television Group, with 20th Century Fox Television co-chairpersons Dana Walden and Gary Newman appointed to head the division.

The 2014–15 season saw the series finale of &quot;Glee&quot; and debut of hits in the freshmen dramas &quot;Gotham&quot; (based on the Batman mythos) and the Lee Daniels-produced &quot;Empire&quot;. Ratings for &quot;Empire&quot;, in particular, increased week-to-week throughout its first season, becoming the network&#x27;s first successful &quot;American Idol&quot; lead-out since &quot;House&quot;, as well as the first American television program to consistently increase its episode-to-episode viewership during its first five weeks since the 1992 feat set by ABC&#x27;s &quot;Roseanne&quot;. &quot;Empire&quot; ended its inaugural season as the first U.S. television show ever to increase its episodic viewership on a consistent basis throughout the course of a single season, as well as Fox&#x27;s fourth program overall (and the first since the 2013 finale of &quot;American Idol&quot;) to enter the Nielsen Top 10 by the end of the 2014–15 season.

The 2015–16 season marked a notable turnaround for Fox, as it jumped ahead of ABC to third place in nationwide ratings (both in overall viewership and in the 18–49 demo) and posted several firsts for the network and on U.S. television. Its improvement was boosted by the transfer of the Miss Universe and Miss USA pageants from NBC, as well as shows such as &quot;&quot;, &quot;Empire&quot; and the return of &quot;The X-Files&quot; after its most recent season ending in 2002. &quot;Grease: Live&quot; became the first live American television musical special of the 21st century to be broadcast in front of a live studio audience (as well as the first ever live musical special aired by a non-Big Three network on primetime).

By 2016, &quot;Empire&quot; and &quot;The X-Files&quot; ranked in the Nielsen Top 10 for the season, the first season with 2 Fox programs entering the top rankings since the &quot;American Idol&quot;-&quot;House&quot; tandem of the 2007–2008 season (and the first ever season that Fox achieved such rankings without &quot;American Idol&quot; or any other reality television show from Fox in the Top 10). The same year also marked the finale of &quot;American Idol&quot; in its original run on Fox after airing for fifteen seasons, ending an era of one of the most successful shows in U.S. television history.

In February 2017, Fox broadcast Super Bowl LI, which attracted an average 111.3 million viewers—ranking among the top five most-watched Super Bowl games, and the second-highest audience in network history behind Super Bowl XLVIII.

In March 2017, Rob Wade was named Fox&#x27;s new president of alternative entertainment and specials Rob Wade; he had previously worked as a showrunner for &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, as head of entertainment for BBC Worldwide, and as executive producer of &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; and &quot;The X Factor&quot;.

=== 2018–present: Sale of studios to Disney, focus on non-scripted and sports programming ===
On July 27, 2018, in a deal first announced December 2017, and completed March 20, 2019, 21st Century Fox shareholders agreed to sell most of its key assets (including 20th Century Fox and FX Networks) to The Walt Disney Company for $71.3 billion, following the spin-off of certain businesses. The sale did not include the Fox Broadcasting Company and television stations or the Fox Sports, Fox News, and Fox Business cable channels, which were to be maintained under a company tentatively referred to as &quot;New Fox&quot;. Because Disney already owns the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), the acquisition of the Fox network by Disney would have been illegal under the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)&#x27;s rules prohibiting a merger between any of the four major broadcast networks. As a result of the Disney/Fox deal, and with the merger of CBS and Viacom on December 4, 2019, Fox has become the only major U.S. broadcast network without attachment to any film studio, and it is the only major broadcast network without news or sports divisions.

It was acknowledged that Fox had placed a larger emphasis on its sports programming in its first upfronts since the deal was announced, including the acquisitions of the NFL&#x27;s &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; package and rights to the FIFA World Cup. It was also noted that Fox had been increasingly pivoting towards programs that could generate large audiences, as opposed to ones that become successful primarily through critical acclaim. On June 27, 2018, WWE announced that &quot;SmackDown&quot; would move to Fox on Friday nights beginning October 4, 2019, following its run on USA Network, under a five-year contract valued at $205 million per-year. The network also began to increase its non-scripted output, announcing the new celebrity music competition series &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; (based on the South Korean format &quot;King of Mask Singer&quot;), and the new game shows &quot;Mental Samurai&quot; and &quot;Spin the Wheel&quot; for the 2018–19 season.

In August 2018, Fox Television Group CEO Dana Walden stated that the network planned to commission and acquire more series from &quot;independent&quot; studios not co-owned with the Big Three networks, explaining that the vertical integration of the major broadcast networks (including Fox itself) with associated studios had limited opportunities for outside studios, and cited several top programs that were distributed by third-parties, such as &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; and &quot;This Is Us&quot; (produced by Warner Bros. Television and 20th Television for CBS and NBC respectively). There were also plans for Fox to acquire new pitches directly from their writers, and offer them to outside producers. As part of the transition, Fox aimed to gradually reduce the amount of scripted programming development coming from 20th Television, although stalwarts such as &quot;The Simpsons&quot; would remain with the network.

Following the completion of the sale, network head Dana Walden became chairwoman of Disney Television Studios and ABC Entertainment. AMC president Charlie Collier succeeded Gary Newman as chairman and CEO of Fox on November 1, 2018. Newman was expected to temporarily remain with Fox in a transitional role, to oversee the corporate transition. The start of 2019 saw &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; premiere to Fox&#x27;s highest ratings for a non-scripted premiere without an NFL lead-in since 2011, and record the largest-ever Nielsen ratings gain for a non-scripted series after three days of delayed viewership. On January 30, 2019, Fox ordered a second season, while the first-season finale saw an average audience of 11.5 million viewers.

With the completion of Disney&#x27;s purchase the next day, the &quot;New Fox&quot; entity, officially named Fox Corporation, formally began trading on March 19, 2019. At its 2019–20 upfronts, Fox announced 10 new scripted series for the upcoming season, with three (&quot;Almost Family&quot;, &quot;Bless the Harts&quot;, and &quot;Prodigal Son&quot;) slated for the fall lineup, as well as the second and third seasons of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; — scheduled for October 2019 and February 2020 respectively (with the latter premiering after Super Bowl LIV). Fox also established a new in-house studio, Fox Alternative Entertainment, for investments in non-scripted formats. It is led by Rob Wade, while its first production was the second season of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; (after season 1 was produced by Endemol Shine North America).

&quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; finished as the second highest-rated series of the 2018–19 television season in the key demographic, behind only &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot;, while &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; finished tied for third with &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; and &quot;This Is Us&quot;. In the 2019–20, &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; and &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; once again finished as the second and third highest-rated programs in the key demographic, and Fox finished the season as the highest-rated network among viewers 18–49 (with CBS leading in overall viewers).&lt;ref name=&quot;S2/3AvgRatings&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Fox repeated this victory in the 2020–21 season, but was narrowly beaten by NBC for 2021–22 by a tenth of a ratings share. In October 2022, Collier stepped down to join Roku, with Rob Wade promoted to president and CEO of Fox Entertainment. That season, Fox would lose &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; to Amazon Prime Video.

In May 2023, Fox dropped its procedural drama &quot;9-1-1&quot; after six seasons. It had been the network&#x27;s scripted tentpole since 2018. As a 20th Television production, ABC would subsequently pick up the series for a seventh season. Its spin-off &quot;9-1-1: Lone Star&quot; would remain on Fox for the time being, with a renewal for a fifth season. In September 2024, it was announced that &quot;9-1-1: Lone Star&quot; would conclude after its fifth season; it was the last 20th Television-produced drama to still air on the network. Fox would lose &quot;SmackDown&quot; to USA Network in September 2024; as a replacement, Fox would begin a strategy of regular sports programming on Friday nights, beginning with a package of primetime college football games. The new package would leverage Fox&#x27;s contract extension with the Big Ten Conference, which included options for the network to carry Friday-night games after the addition of west coast teams to the conference.

==Programming==

, Fox currently provides 17 hours of regularly scheduled network programming each week. The network provides fifteen hours of prime time programming to its owned-and-operated and affiliated stations on Monday through Saturdays from 8:00 to 10:00 p.m. and Sundays from 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. (all times Eastern and Pacific). An hour of late night programming is also offered on Saturdays from 11:00 p.m. to 12:00 am. Eastern and Pacific Time, a former hour of original comedy, but currently a repeat hour for primetime series (though scheduling for that hour varies depending on the market due to late local newscasts airing in the traditional 11:00 p.m./10:00 p.m. timeslot on some Fox stations), and the hour-long Sunday morning political discussion show – and the network&#x27;s only regular national news program – &quot;Fox News Sunday with Shannon Bream&quot; (airing from 9:00 a.m. to 10:00 am. Eastern and Pacific, although the timeslot also varies by market due to local news or public affairs programming).

Sports programming is also provided; usually on weekends, with notable exceptions (albeit not every weekend year-round), and most commonly airing between 11:00 a.m. and 11:30 pm. ET (often airing for longer hours during football season in the fall, slightly less during NASCAR and college basketball season in the winter and barely any in the spring and summer afternoons), The Saturday prime time block (along with the Friday prime time block beginning in 2024) is mainly scheduled for sports programming, with encores of shows airing when no sports programming is airing on a given week.

===Adult animation===
Except for &quot;The Critic&quot;, &quot;The PJs&quot; and &quot;Futurama&quot;, which were respectively cancelled in 1995, 2000 and 2003, typically every Sunday night during prime time (unless preempted, usually by sports telecasts), Fox airs a lineup incorporating original adult animation sitcoms, all being produced (or co-produced with Fox for post-2019 works) by the network&#x27;s original sister company, 20th Television, which is currently a subsidiary of Walt Disney Television. This block of adult cartoons became a staple of the network airing under the brand &quot;Animation Domination&quot; from May 1, 2005, to September 14, 2014, when the network rebranded the block as &quot;Sunday Funday&quot; as a result of the re-incorporation of live-action comedy series on the Sunday night lineup after ten years (aside from occasional burn-offs of series aired on other nights during the 7:00 pm. Eastern/Pacific hour), although animated series remain an integral part of that night&#x27;s schedule.

The first programs to air as part of the &quot;Animation Domination&quot; lineup were &quot;American Dad!&quot; (which also had its beginnings in the lineup, and moved to TBS in October 2014), &quot;Family Guy&quot; (which returned to the network after a three-year cancellation when &quot;Animation Domination&quot; began), &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (the longest-running cartoon on Fox, predating the lineup by 16 years), and &quot;King of the Hill&quot; (which also predated the lineup by eight years). Once &quot;King of the Hill&quot; was cancelled, &quot;Family Guy&quot;″s spinoff &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot; would air from 2009 to 2013 and Loren Bouchard&#x27;s next series, &quot;Bob&#x27;s Burgers&quot; would air starting in 2011. Animated shows currently airing as part of the lineup include &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;Bob&#x27;s Burgers&quot;, &quot;Duncanville&quot;, &quot;The Great North&quot; and &quot;Housebroken&quot;. Other shows in the lineup include &quot;Sit Down, Shut Up&quot;, &quot;Allen Gregory&quot;, &quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot;, &quot;Bordertown&quot;, &quot;Bless the Harts&quot;, and the live-action/animated hybrid &quot;Son of Zorn&quot;.

An extension of the Sunday prime-time block called &quot;Animation Domination High-Def&quot; launched on Saturday late nights in July 2013 (marking the return of first-run programming in that time period since the 2010 cancellation of &quot;The Wanda Sykes Show&quot;), with &quot;ADHD Shorts&quot;, &quot;Axe Cop&quot; and &quot;High School USA!&quot;. Due to low ratings, Fox announced on April 17, 2014, that it would discontinue &quot;Animation Domination High-Def&quot;; although the block was slated to end on June 28, 2014, it continued to air in encore form until the start of the 2016–17 season, when the hour returned to airing encores of comedies or reality series.

===Children&#x27;s programming===

Fox began airing children&#x27;s programming on September 8, 1990, with the debut of the Fox Children&#x27;s Network (rebranded as the Fox Kids Network in 1991, and then to simply Fox Kids in 1998), a programming block that aired on Saturday mornings and weekday afternoons. Programming within the Fox Kids block consisted mainly of animated series, although it also featured some live-action series as part of the lineup. Shows featured in the block included &quot;Bobby&#x27;s World&quot;, &quot;X-Men&quot;, &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, &quot;The Tick&quot;, &quot;Fun House&quot;, &quot;Goosebumps&quot; and &quot;Digimon&quot;; it also aired select shows from Warner Bros. Animation including the popular animated series &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot;, &quot;Animaniacs&quot; and &quot;&quot; (Warner Bros. pulled &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Animaniacs&quot; from the Fox Kids lineup in September 1995, moving both shows, as well as &quot;Tiny Toons&quot; – which had already ended its run – to the newly launched Kids&#x27; WB block on The WB). Fox Kids&#x27; most successful series, however, was &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot; (from eventual sister company and Fox Kids co-parent Saban Entertainment), which debuted in 1993 and became the block&#x27;s flagship program until it moved to ABC and Toon Disney in 2002.

In October 2001, Fox sold its children&#x27;s division, Saban Entertainment and Fox Family Worldwide (the parent subsidiary of cable network Fox Family Channel, now Freeform) to The Walt Disney Company for $5.3 billion. The network relegated the Fox Kids block to Saturdays in January 2002 (turning over the two-hour timeslot held by the weekday block to its owned-and-operated and affiliated stations, rather than retaining the slots and filling them with adult-oriented daytime shows); then on September 14, 2002, as part of a time-lease agreement with 4Kids Entertainment to program the remaining four-hour Saturday morning lineup, Fox Kids was replaced by a new children&#x27;s program block called FoxBox (which was renamed 4Kids TV in January 2005). Notable programs in that block include &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Sonic X&quot; and &quot;One Piece&quot;.

Fox discontinued the 4Kids TV block on December 27, 2008, due to conflicts between the network and 4Kids Entertainment that were later settled, regarding 4Kids&#x27; failure to pay Fox for the programming lease rights, and the network&#x27;s inability to fulfill a promise guaranteeing clearance on 90% of its stations and to get other stations to carry the block in certain markets where a Fox station declined it (an issue that plagued Fox&#x27;s children&#x27;s program blocks since the start of its affiliation deal with New World Communications). Fox had earlier announced, on November 23, that it would no longer carry children&#x27;s programming in the time period, citing stiff competition from cable channels aimed at the demographic; the network instead turned over two of the four vacant Saturday morning hours to its affiliates to allow them to air local newscasts or educational programs purchased from the syndication market, while it retained the remaining two hours to run a network-managed paid programming block, &quot;Weekend Marketplace&quot;, which debuted on January 3, 2009.

On September 13, 2014, &quot;Xploration Station&quot;, a two-hour syndicated block produced by Steve Rotfeld Productions, began airing on Fox stations owned by several affiliate groups including Fox Television Stations and Tribune Broadcasting. The block, which complies with guidelines defined by the Children&#x27;s Television Act, features programs focused on the STEM fields. Stations can choose to either carry &quot;Xploration Station&quot;, continue to air &quot;Weekend Marketplace&quot; (as the Sinclair Broadcast Group chose to do, since it already carries syndicated E/I programming purchased by the company across its Fox affiliates, although Sinclair added the block on most of its Fox affiliates in September 2016) or in case of Birmingham, not at all (since Raycom Media/Gray Television carried E/I programs through existing contracts with syndicators of educational program content instead).

===News===

Unlike ABC, CBS, and NBC, Fox does not currently air national news programs (morning, evening or overnight, like ABC News, CBS News, and NBC News) or newsmagazines choosing to focus solely on its prime time schedule, sports and other ancillary network programming. The absence of a national news program on the Fox network is despite the fact that Fox Corporation owns the Fox News Channel, which launched in October 1996 and currently maintains near-universal distribution within the United States via pay television providers. Fox News is not structured as a news division of the Fox network, and operates as a technically separate entity within Fox Corporation through the company&#x27;s Fox News Group subsidiary. However, it does produce some content that is carried by the broadcast network, which is usually separate from the news coverage aired by the cable channel; in particular, FNC anchor Bill Hemmer anchors most prime time news presentations on the Fox network, especially during political news events (which are anchored by Bret Baier on Fox News Channel).

Specifically, the Fox network airs coverage of the State of the Union address, presidential debates, national election coverage, as well as live breaking news coverage currently branded as a &quot;Fox News Special Report&quot; (also branded as a &quot;Fox News Alert&quot; or sometimes a &quot;Fox News Red Alert&quot;); carriage of such special coverage of a breaking news story may vary from station to station, and is often limited to events that occur during the network&#x27;s usual prime time block (for example, unlike the Big Three, Fox does not often provide coverage of major political convention speeches, which usually occur during the 10:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) hour during which most of its affiliates air local newscasts; however, the majority of Fox&#x27;s owned-and-operated stations and affiliate groups do carry weekday breaking news briefs). The political discussion show &quot;Fox News Sunday&quot; also airs on the Fox network on Sunday mornings and is rebroadcast later in the day on FNC. Fox also operates an affiliate news service called Fox NewsEdge, which launched with Fox News Channel in 1996, and provides national and international news reports, and feature stories for Fox stations to use in their own local newscasts. Between June and December 2022, Fox did not simulcast the public January 6 committee hearings and instead stuck with regularly scheduled programming, although ABC, CBS and NBC aired it.

Fox first tried its hand at a national news program in prime time with the hour-long weekly newsmagazine &quot;The Reporters&quot;, which was produced by the same team behind the Fox Television Stations-distributed syndicated tabloid program &quot;A Current Affair&quot;; the program ran from 1988 to 1990, when it was cancelled due to low ratings. From 1987 until about 1996, Fox also aired news capsules that aired within its prime time schedule, branded first as &quot;Fox News Extra&quot;, and later as &quot;Fox News Updates&quot;, which were produced at New York City O&amp;O WNYW and used their anchors. Another failed attempt occurred in 1993, when Fox launched &quot;Front Page&quot; (which included among its five hosts, Ron Reagan and Josh Mankiewicz), in an attempt to capture a younger demographic for a newsmagazine program.

The network tried its hand at a newsmagazine again in 1998 with &quot;Fox Files&quot;, hosted by Fox News Channel anchors Catherine Crier and Jon Scott, as well as a team of correspondents; it lasted a little over a year before being cancelled. Its last attempt at a newsmagazine series occurred during the 2002–03 Sweeps period, with &quot;The Pulse&quot;, hosted by Fox News Channel anchor Shepard Smith. On May 17, 2016, the network aired an interview special with then Fox News primetime anchor Megyn Kelly, &quot;Megyn Kelly Presents&quot;.

Fox also attempted national morning programs, only the first of which aired on the network itself. Its first venture at such a program was &quot;Fox After Breakfast&quot;, an hour-long morning news and lifestyle show, hosted by Tom Bergeron, Laurie Hibberd, and Vicki Lawrence, that ran on the network from 1996 to 1998 (Fox aired the program at 9:00 a.m. – as opposed to the 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. time slot that NBC, CBS, and ABC air their national morning shows – to accommodate local morning newscasts that ran in the latter slot on some of its stations); the program originated as &quot;Breakfast Time&quot; in 1994 on sister cable channel FX. Fox tried again in 2002 with &quot;Good Day Live&quot;, a heavily entertainment-focused syndicated offshoot of &quot;Good Day L.A.&quot;, a news/entertainment/lifestyle program that debuted in 1993 on Los Angeles owned-and-operated station KTTV; the national version of the program was cancelled in 2005. On January 22, 2007, Fox premiered &quot;The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet&quot; on its owned-and-operated stations; hosted by Mike Jerrick and Juliet Huddy (then-anchors of Fox News Channel&#x27;s &quot;DaySide&quot;), the show was lighter in format and more entertainment-oriented, though its focus often changed when a major news story occurred. In February 2007, the program was syndicated to other stations including many affiliated with ABC, NBC and CBS in markets where it was not carried by a Fox or MyNetworkTV affiliate; &quot;The Morning Show&quot; was cancelled in June 2009.

===Sports===
When the network launched, Fox management, having seen the critical role that sports programming, soccer events, in particular had played in the growth of the British satellite service BSkyB, believed that sports – and specifically, professional football would be the engine that would make Fox a major network the quickest. In 1987, after ABC initially hedged on renewing its contract to broadcast &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;, Fox made an offer to the National Football League (NFL) to acquire the rights for the same amount that ABC had been paying, about $13 million per game at the time. However, partly due to the fact that Fox had not yet established itself as a major network, the NFL chose to renew its contract with ABC (where &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; remained until its move to sister cable channel ESPN in September 2006).

Six years later, when the league entered contract negotiations with its television partners, Fox placed a $1.58 billion bid to obtain broadcast rights to the National Football Conference – covering four seasons of games, beginning with the 1994 NFL season. The NFL selected the Fox bid on December 18, 1993, stripping CBS of football telecasts for the first time since 1955. The event placed Fox on par with the &quot;Big Three&quot; television networks and ushered in an era of growth for the NFL. Fox&#x27;s acquisition of the NFL rights also quickly led toward the network reaching an affiliation deal with New World Communications to change the affiliations of twelve of its stations to Fox (see above). The rights gave Fox many new viewers and a platform for advertising its other programs.

With a sports division now established with the arrival of the NFL, Fox acquired broadcast television rights to the National Hockey League (1994–99), Major League Baseball (since 1996) and NASCAR auto racing (since 2001, initially as part of a deal that also involved NBC and TNT).

From 2007 to 2010, Fox aired the Bowl Championship Series—a group of college football bowl games held around New Year&#x27;s Day, and the BCS National Championship Game (with the exception of any event held at the Rose Bowl Stadium, including the Rose Bowl Game and the Rose Bowl-hosted 2010 BCS National Championship Game, as their organizer maintained a separate contract with ABC). Following the conclusion of the deal, Fox acquired rights to the Big Ten Conference and Pac-12 Conference&#x27;s newly established football championship games (the latter alternating yearly with ESPN). In 2017, Fox acquired tier 1 rights to the Big Ten Conference.

In August 2011, Fox and mixed martial arts promotion Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) reached a multi-year agreement, which included the rights to broadcast four live events in prime time or late night annually, marking the first time that the UFC aired its events on broadcast television. Its first UFC on Fox event, Velasquez vs. Dos Santos, aired on November 12, 2011. This deal ended at the end of 2018, with UFC events moving to ESPN and ESPN+.

The network&#x27;s 2023 telecast of Super Bowl LVII remains the highest-rated U.S. television program on average of all time. Meanwhile, its 2017 telecast of Super Bowl LI remains the record holder for the largest overall audience ever tallied in U.S. television history.

On June 13, 2024, Fox announced a multi-year deal to be the sole broadcaster of the IndyCar Series and its subsidiary series Indy NXT with all IndyCar Series races to be broadcast on the network.

==Stations==
Fox has 18 owned-and-operated stations, and current and pending affiliation agreements with 226 additional television stations encompassing 50 states, the District of Columbia and three U.S. possessions; through its Fox Television Stations subsidiary, Fox has the most owned-and-operated stations of the major American commercial broadcast networks. The network has a national reach of 95.77% of all households in the United States (or 299,268,292 Americans with at least one television set). Currently, New Hampshire, New Jersey and Delaware are the only U.S. states where Fox does not have a locally licensed affiliate (New Hampshire is served by Boston affiliate WFXT, New Jersey is split between New York City O&amp;O WNYW and Philadelphia O&amp;O WTXF, while Delaware is served by WTXF and Salisbury, Maryland affiliate WBOC-DT2).

Fox largely discontinued analog broadcasts on June 12, 2009, as part of the transition to digital television. As a newer broadcast network, Fox still has a few low-power affiliates, covering markets like Youngstown, Ohio (WYFX-LD). In some markets, including both of the ones mentioned, these stations also maintain simulcasts on a subchannel of a co-owned/managed full-power television station. Fox also maintains a sizeable number of subchannel-only affiliations in cities located outside the 50 largest Nielsen-designated markets that do not have enough full-power stations to support a standalone affiliation or have a low-power station as the only other option as an affiliate, though a couple have appeared in the top 50; the largest subchannel-only Fox affiliate by market size is WSYX-DT3 in Columbus, Ohio, No. 34 by Nielsen.

Nexstar Media Group is Fox&#x27;s largest affiliate group in terms of overall market and numerical reach, with 42 stations (including some former Fox O&amp;Os that were spun off in 2008 to Local TV, which Tribune Media later acquired in 2013, to finance former Fox parent News Corporation&#x27;s purchase of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;; Nexstar purchased Tribune in the fall of 2019); the Sinclair Broadcast Group is the second largest operator of Fox stations by numerical total, owning or providing services to 26 Fox-affiliated stations.

Fox previously distributed its programming in markets that did not have enough stations to support an affiliate via Foxnet, a cable channel acting as an alternate national feed for small and certain mid-sized U.S. markets (generally those within the bottom 110 Nielsen media markets) that launched in 1991 and operated until its shutdown on September 12, 2006; the channel featured a master schedule of programs acquired from the syndication market and some brokered programming to fill time slots not occupied by Fox network programming. The concept behind Foxnet served as the basis for The WB 100+ Station Group (launched in September 1998 as the cable-only feed of The WB) and The CW Plus (the immediate successor of The WB 100+, which launched in September 2006 as a cable-only/digital multicast feed of The CW), which both allow the customization of localized branding (which Foxnet did not allow its cable partners to do) in addition to allowing affiliates to sell local advertising.

==Differences between Fox and the &quot;Big Three&quot; networks==

===Network programming===
Fox&#x27;s programming schedule differs from the &quot;Big Three&quot; networks in several significant ways: the network airs its prime time programming for only two hours on Monday through Saturday evenings and three hours on Sundays, compared to the three hours on Monday through Saturdays (from 8:00 to 11:00 p.m.) and four hours on Sunday nights (from 7:00 to 11:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time) programmed by the three longer-established networks, ABC, CBS and NBC. This scheduling is termed as &quot;common prime&quot;, referring to the programming of prime time content across all of the conventional broadcast networks during the early- and mid-evening hours, while the 10:00 p.m. (Eastern) hour is programmed only by the three older networks.

Fox has traditionally avoided programming the 10:00 p.m. hour, choosing to cede the time period to its local affiliates for them to program, many of which air local newscasts during that hour; however, some exceptions do exist for select special film presentations, which by virtue of their running time (depending on whether the film&#x27;s original length, combined with commercial breaks that would be included in the television cut, would exceed a traditional two-hour broadcast timeslot) must spill over into the 10:00 p.m. hour, overruns from live sports telecasts scheduled to air during prime time and new primetime entertainment programming after primetime (6:30 pm ET) NFL playoff games. However, the network did regularly schedule programming in the 10:00 p.m. hour on Sunday nights from September 1989 to September 1993 (when that specific time period was turned back over to its affiliates), although it never added programming at that hour on any other night. Fox&#x27;s original reason for the reduced number of prime time hours was to avoid fulfilling FCC requirements in effect at the time to be considered a network, and to be free of resulting regulations, although these rules have since been relaxed.

Despite being a major network, in addition to not carrying national morning and evening newscasts, Fox also does not air any network daytime programming (such as soap operas, game shows or talk shows). Because of this, the network&#x27;s owned-and-operated stations and affiliates handle the responsibility of programming daytime hours with syndicated or locally produced programming (then corporate sister 20th Television distributes several syndicated daytime programs carried by many Fox stations, such as &quot;Divorce Court&quot; and &quot;The Wendy Williams Show&quot;; Fox Television Stations also test markets certain series from 20th Television and other syndicators such as Warner Bros. Television Distribution that are proposed for national distribution on some of its stations). The network also does not carry network-supplied children&#x27;s programming on Saturday mornings or late-night programming on Monday through Friday nights. Local affiliates either produce their own programming or run syndicated programs during these time periods. Because of the erratic scheduling of the network&#x27;s sports programming, many Fox stations choose to run a mix of syndicated programming, infomercials and especially movies to fill weekend afternoon timeslots when a sports event is not scheduled to air.

In addition, from the network&#x27;s inception, Fox has produced two versions of its program promotions for distribution to the network&#x27;s stations: a standard version incorporating airtimes based on their broadcast in the Eastern/Central or Pacific/Mountain time zones, depending on the feed used by the station (as those seen during network commercial breaks), and versions with &quot;clean&quot; end tags to allow stations to include local airtime and station information through graphical insertion and verbal continuity by station promotional announcers during the program logo graphic or prime time menu. This practice—which differs from that long used by ABC, NBC and CBS, which only allow their stations to insert logos within their network promotions—was also later adopted by The WB and UPN (and their successors The CW, and to a lesser extent, MyNetworkTV) for use by their affiliated stations. A third cut of these promos exists for national program advertising carried by cable networks (including Fox&#x27;s sister cable networks), where the wording &quot;check local listings&quot; is placed in the end tag.

Fox is the only broadcast network that currently carries adult animated comedies. This started with &quot;The Simpsons&quot; in 1989. This is followed up by &quot;King of the Hill&quot; in 1997 (until 2009, with the last remaining six episodes airing on syndication, but is set to return to Hulu for new episodes in 2025), &quot;Family Guy&quot; (which was cancelled twice until being picked up by Adult Swim for reruns and was brought back by the network in 2005 thanks to home video sales) and &quot;Futurama&quot; in 1999 (until 2003 when it was also picked up by Adult Swim only to be purchased by Comedy Central for new episodes between 2008 and 2013 and returned for new episodes on Hulu in 2023), &quot;American Dad!&quot; in 2005 (until 2014 when TBS picked up the series), &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot; in 2009, &quot;Bob&#x27;s Burgers&quot; in 2011, &quot;Duncanville&quot; in 2020, and &quot;The Great North&quot; and &quot;Housebroken&quot; in 2021. Although the network also aired other adult animated shows like &quot;The Critic&quot;, &quot;The PJs&quot;, &quot;Sit Down, Shut Up&quot;, &quot;Allen Gregory&quot;, &quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot;, &quot;Bordertown&quot;, &quot;Son of Zorn&quot; (the network&#x27;s only live-action/animated hybrid sitcom) and &quot;Bless the Harts&quot;, they had no success and were short-lived. While ABC, CBS, and NBC have tried to copy the success of Fox with adult animated shows, none were successful.

===News programming===
Within Fox&#x27;s station body, the quantity of locally produced news programming varies considerably compared to the owned-and-operated and affiliated stations of ABC, NBC, and CBS (which typically carry at least 4½ hours of local newscasts on weekdays and one hour on weekends, which are usually spread across morning, midday, early or late evening timeslots). At minimum, most Fox stations run a late-evening newscast following the network&#x27;s prime time lineup (at 10:00 p.m. in the Eastern and Pacific, and 9:00 p.m. in the Central and Mountain Time Zones), which typically run 30 minutes to one hour in length; besides the fact that the network&#x27;s stations have more latitude to air an earlier late-evening newscast since Fox does not program that hour, this stems from the fact that several of its charter stations were already airing prime time newscasts as independent stations prior to the network&#x27;s launch (such as New York City O&amp;O WNYW, which debuted its 10:00 p.m. newscast in March 1967). Most Fox stations also carry a weekday morning newscast of one to three hours in length at 7:00 am, as a local alternative to the national morning news programs provided by the &quot;Big Three&quot; networks (though mainly in the case of Fox stations that have a news operation and in a few cases, via simulcasts with ABC-, NBC- and CBS-affiliated stations that operate a Fox affiliate, this is often part of a morning news block that runs for four to six hours on average).

Fox has fewer stations that have an independent news operation than those of ABC, NBC and CBS; , 70 of Fox&#x27;s 236 stations (including all 18 owned-and-operated stations) maintain in-house news departments (compared to roughly – of the stations of each of the three other major broadcast networks, whose newscasts are either produced in-house or in conjunction with another station). KVVU (channel 5) in Las Vegas has the highest weekly total of news programming hours among Fox&#x27;s stations, at 78½ hours.

Most Fox stations that run a news operation use a newscast-intensive scheduling format that is very similar to an ABC-, NBC-, or CBS-affiliated station which in many cases, may incorporate midday or early-evening newscasts, the latter of which is often extended by a half-hour to compete with the national evening newscasts provided by the &quot;Big Three&quot; networks; some Fox stations except for those owned by Fox Television Stations and those formerly owned by Tribune Broadcasting air their early-evening newscasts only on Monday through Friday nights, due to frequent sports event overruns into that daypart on weekends. The first Fox station to adopt such a scheduling format was WSVN in Miami; upon affiliating with the network in January 1989, WSVN retained its existing morning, midday and early evening newscasts, while moving its late newscast from 11:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. and expanding it to one hour (the station later relaunched an 11:00 p.m. newscast in 1995), and expanding its weekday morning newscast by two hours. This type of format was later adopted by the former major network stations that switched to Fox between 1994 and 1996, especially those affected by New World and Burnham Broadcasting affiliation deals. Many Fox stations with upstart news departments often do not run a full slate of newscasts initially, usually carrying only a prime time newscast at first, before gradually adding other newscasts over time.

In many small to mid-sized markets (largely those ranked outside the 50 largest Nielsen-designated television markets), production of the local Fox affiliate&#x27;s newscasts is outsourced to an NBC, ABC, or CBS station – either due to insufficient funds or studio space for a news department or in most cases, as a byproduct of the station being operated through a legal duopoly or a management agreement with a major network affiliate (such as with Cunningham Broadcasting-owned WEMT (channel 39) in Greeneville, Tennessee, which has its newscasts produced by NBC affiliate WCYB-TV (channel 5) through a local marketing agreement with Sinclair Broadcast Group). Fox affiliates that outsource their news production to a major-network affiliate often carry a lesser amount of news programming than is possible with an affiliate with a standalone news department due to the contracting station&#x27;s preference to avoid having the Fox station&#x27;s newscasts compete against their own in common timeslots (differing from outsourcing agreements between two same-market ABC, CBS, or NBC affiliates in certain areas, in which both stations may simulcast newscasts in the same timeslots). The lone exceptions to this rule currently are El Paso, Texas affiliate KFOX-TV (channel 14) and WXIN, which respectively began producing newscasts for their CBS-affiliated duopoly partners using resources from their existing news departments in September 2014 (when new sister stations KFOX and KDBC-TV (channel 4) consolidated their operations into a single facility) and January 2015 (when WXIN sister WTTV (channel 4) affiliated with CBS), with the Fox stations maintaining the same amount of news programming that they did beforehand. Another exception is KNPN-LD (channel 26) in St. Joseph, Missouri, which has been the smallest Fox affiliate by market size with an in-house news operation since the station&#x27;s July 2012 sign-on; News-Press &amp; Gazette Company expanded production of KNPN&#x27;s newscasts to its sister flagship stations, KNPG-LD (channel 21) and KCJO-LD (channel 30), when they respectively joined NBC and CBS in November 2016 and June 2017, though the former also maintained roughly the same amount of news programming before the conversions (KNPN airs morning, midday and early evening newscasts on weekdays and a nightly late evening newscast; all three stations simulcast the first 90 minutes of the morning newscast, while the remainder of KNPN&#x27;s newscasts air in separate time slots from those seen on KNPG and KCJO).

WPGH-TV (channel 53) in Pittsburgh is the largest Fox station by Nielsen market ranking (at #23) that outsources its news programming; NBC affiliate WPXI (channel 11; owned by Cox Media Group) has produced the station&#x27;s 10:00 p.m. newscast since 2006, when WPGH shut down its news department following the closure of owner Sinclair Broadcast Group&#x27;s News Central division. A few Fox affiliates only air syndicated programming in time periods where newscasts would air on other major network stations. The largest Fox station by market size that does not carry news programming is WSYT (channel 68) in Syracuse, New York (which discontinued a 10:00 p.m. newscast produced by CBS affiliate WTVH (channel 5) in 2006). In Dayton, Ohio, Sinclair Broadcast Group took the unusual step in August 2015 of adopting &quot;Fox 45 News&quot; as its universal brand for its news operation in that market, making it appear as if the news department was operated by WRGT-TV, even though it actually belongs to WRGT&#x27;s virtual duopoly partner, ABC affiliate WKEF, which Sinclair owns outright (newscasts on WKEF would be branded as &quot;Fox 45 News on ABC22&quot;); Sinclair used WRGT over WKEF due to the latter&#x27;s perennial &quot;also-ran&quot; reputation in the market in regard to their newscast ratings. WRGT and WKEF have since switched to a new branding model in the summer of 2019 involving a 24/7 web news service known as &quot;Dayton 24/7 Now&quot;, and in 2021, WRGT&#x27;s Fox affiliation moved to WKEF&#x27;s second subchannel (along with a number of other Sinclair or related companies in several other markets), as Sinclair consolidated its network affiliations onto one station in a market to address regulatory concerns.

===Video-on-demand services===
Fox maintains several video on demand venues for viewers to watch the network&#x27;s programming, including a traditional VOD service called Fox on Demand, which is carried on most traditional cable, satellite, streaming, and telecom providers. Fox also streams most of its programming on the streaming video service Hulu, along with traditional streaming via the network&#x27;s Full Episode portal on Fox.com. The network&#x27;s mobile and digital media player app was branded as &quot;Fox Now&quot;, and featured access to a live stream of the network&#x27;s primetime and sports programming (though not local and syndicated programming for affiliates not owned by the network), along with full-time live streams of their owned cable networks with TV Everywhere authentication through authorized television providers.

The most recent episodes of the network&#x27;s shows are usually made available on the Fox on Demand television service the day after their original broadcast. In addition, fast forwarding capabilities are disabled while viewing content (a commonality for video-on-demand television services provided by the U.S. broadcast networks) and the program&#x27;s original advertisements that aired during the initial broadcast are included for a week after becoming available on the service, before being replaced by direct response advertising thereafter. Due to restrictions put in place by the network in January 2012 to encourage live or same-week DVR viewing via traditional and cable on demand methods, Hulu and Fox.com both impose an eight-day delay for most viewers to access the most recent episode of any Fox program, restricting day-after-air streaming of its shows on both services to subscribers of certain pay television providers (such as Dish Network and Verizon FiOS) using an ISP account through agreements made with Fox, along with Hulu&#x27;s free service with advertisements on Yahoo! Stream; however, Hulu offers newer episodes of Fox programs the day after their original broadcast to paid subscribers requiring only a user-determined login.

In March 2020, Fox began to stream the full schedule of all of their owned Fox Television Stations through Fox Now. The following month, Fox acquired the ad-supported streaming service Tubi. The service primarily offers content and channels licensed from third-party studios, but later began to add episodes of Fox Entertainment original series (such as &quot;The Masked Singer&quot;) a week after their television premiere.

Fox discontinued the Fox Now app in July 2023; streaming of the network&#x27;s programming would continue on other apps instead, such as Hulu, Fox Local, or Tubi.

===Fox HD===

Fox began broadcasting its programming in 720p high definition on September 12, 2004, with that day&#x27;s slate of NFC football games during week one of the 2004 NFL season. Until March 14, 2016, the network did not display an on-screen logo graphic on the bottom-right corner of the screen, outside a ten-second sweep of a &quot;Fox HD&quot; promotional logo (which until the end of 2010, also featured a sponsor tag for DirecTV); instead a trigger in Fox&#x27;s program delivery system at each station displayed the logo bug of an owned-and-operated or affiliate station in the right-hand corner of the 16:9 screen frame, which disappeared during commercial breaks (the station logo bug would still be triggered even if Fox programming was pre-empted locally due to breaking news, severe weather coverage or special programming, though some stations, such as WGGB-DT2 in Springfield, Massachusetts, did not display a logo or substitute only the &quot;FOX&quot; logo alone). However, network or affiliate bugs are not displayed during Fox Sports programming. During some high-profile or live programs such as &quot;American Idol&quot; and &quot;So You Think You Can Dance&quot;, however, Fox forwent the affiliate&#x27;s logo and displayed its network logo instead, mainly for promotional consideration due to fair use of clips from each series by other media outlets (such as news programs, talk shows, and review and satirical programs that rely on clip content); until 2014, the bug was placed in the 4:3 safe area. The Sunday political talk program &quot;Fox News Sunday&quot; displayed the &quot;Fox HD&quot; logo at all times for both that reason and because of many stations airing the program on tape delay later in the morning. Beginning on March 14, 2016, the standard Fox logo with hashtag is now used on all programming, with the station bug flashed for a few moments at the start of a program or coming out of commercial, as is traditionally done with ABC, CBS and NBC stations. In addition, the Fox HD bug was discontinued; although it was still used on &quot;Fox News Sunday&quot; until around late 2019-early 2020.

On some Fox programs, a hashtag rests above the affiliate&#x27;s logo (for example, or &quot;#bones&quot;) to provide viewers reference to the network&#x27;s official Twitter search tag to find or start discussions during the program being broadcast. In April 2012, additional tags relating to plot points in a given episode (for instance, the &quot;#saturdaynightGLEEver&quot; tag for an April 2012 episode of &quot;Glee&quot; of that same title) began to also be promoted in this space to both add additional trending topics and spread out more conversations on Twitter. In cases where the Fox bug appears instead of the station&#x27;s logo bug, the Twitter hashtag is directly above the Fox logo in the safe area. Fox&#x27;s coverage of the World Series started broadcasting in HD with Game 1 of the 2002 World Series.

During the transitional period from analog to digital television, Fox was the only commercial television network in the U.S. to air programs in widescreen that were not available in HD (which were identified as being presented in &quot;Fox High Resolution Widescreen&quot; from 2001 to 2006). Prior to the launch of its HD feed, some sitcoms and drama series were presented in widescreen standard-definition, with reality, talk and game shows (&quot;American Idol&quot; being the first major exception, as it began to be presented in high definition in 2008) later being presented only in widescreen enhanced definition. The children&#x27;s sports program &quot;This Week in Baseball&quot; began airing in widescreen in 2009, while &quot;Fox News Sunday&quot; converted to HD when Fox News Channel began operating from its new high-definition facilities in November 2008 (prior to Fox News Channel&#x27;s conversion to a unified widescreen presentation on both its high-definition and standard-definition feeds in September 2010, it was the final Fox News program to structure its graphics and camera positions for the 4:3 safe area). &quot;MADtv&quot; was produced to air only in 4:3 until September 2008, likely due to a combination of stations tape-delaying the program and therefore being unable to offer it via the live network feed in 16:9, and the show&#x27;s producers not making the switch to the format. The final Fox show to convert to HD was &quot;Family Guy&quot; beginning with its September 26, 2010, episode; all programming provided by Fox is now broadcast in widescreen &quot;and&quot; in high definition , and in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound.

Fox is unique among U.S. broadcasters as it distributes its HD feed over satellite to the network&#x27;s affiliates as an MPEG transport stream intended to be delivered bit-for-bit for broadcast transmission. During network programming hours, local commercials are inserted over the feed using a transport stream splicer. Affiliates of most other networks decode compressed satellite network video feeds and then re-encode them for final over-the-air transmission.

After Fox began broadcasting its sports programming with graphics optimized for 16:9 displays rather than the 4:3 safe area in late July 2010, the network asked cable and satellite providers to comply and use the No. 10 Active Format Description flag it now disseminates over Fox programming, which displays content natively broadcast in 16:9 in a letterboxed format suitable for 4:3 television screens to allow any optimized graphical elements to be displayed in full. Subsequently, a number of Fox O&amp;Os and affiliates also began disseminating the AFD No. 10 flag over local news and syndicated programs that the stations broadcast in HD, and have incorporated graphical elements seen during local programs and on-air promos (as well as logo bugs) optimized for the letter boxed presentation.

==Branding==

===Station standardization===
During the early 1990s, Fox began having its stations use a branding structure using a combination of the &quot;Fox&quot; name and the station&#x27;s channel number, often followed by the licensed call letters (for instance, WNYW in New York City, WTTG in Washington, D.C. and WAGA-TV in Atlanta, Georgia, are all branded as &quot;Fox 5&quot;). By the mid-to-late 1990s, stations minimized their call letters to be just barely readable while still in compliance with FCC identification requirements. This marked the start of the trend for other networks to apply such naming schemes.

The branding scheme has varied in some markets, with some Fox stations using a city or regional name within the branding instead of the channel number (for example, Chicago owned-and-operated station WFLD branded as &quot;Fox Chicago&quot; from 1997 to 2012 and Philadelphia O&amp;O WTXF-TV branded as &quot;Fox Philadelphia&quot; from 1995 to 2003); a few of the network&#x27;s stations also minimized use of the &quot;Fox&quot; name, opting to use their call letters or a more generic branding (WSVN in Miami, which has branded as &quot;WSVN 7&quot; for general use and &quot;(Channel) 7 News&quot; for its newscasts since it joined the network in January 1989; KHON-TV (channel 2) in Honolulu, which changed its general branding from &quot;Fox 2&quot; to &quot;KHON 2&quot; in 2003; WDRB in Louisville, Kentucky, which dropped its &quot;Fox 41&quot; brand in favor of branding by its call letters in September 2011; and KVRR (channel 15) in Fargo, North Dakota, which dropped the generic &quot;Fox&quot; branding it used in part due to its network of repeater stations throughout eastern North Dakota in favor of branding by its calls in May 2015). Similarly, most of the stations that switched to Fox as a result of its 1994 affiliation deal with New World Communications retained their Big Three-era branding for general or news purposes (with a few exceptions such as WJW in Cleveland, which dropped its CBS-era &quot;TV8&quot; and &quot;Newscenter 8&quot; brands in 1995, in favor of &quot;Fox is ei8ht&quot; as a general brand and &quot;ei8ht is News&quot; as the title for its newscasts; likewise that same year, KDFW in Dallas/Fort Worth re-branded itself as &quot;Fox 4 Texas&quot; after its newscast name of &quot;News 4 Texas&quot; before shortening its ID to simply &quot;Fox 4&quot; in 1996 and changing its newscast name to &quot;Fox 4 News&quot;, both in use since then), before conforming to Fox&#x27;s station branding conventions when Fox Television Stations acquired New World in 1997.

A particularly unique situation was with KTVU (channel 2) in Oakland-San Francisco, which as a Fox affiliate under longtime owner Cox Media Group, retained its perennial &quot;Channel 2&quot; brand (with limited references as &quot;Fox Channel 2&quot; by the early 1990s). In 1996, the station rebranded as &quot;KTVU Fox 2&quot; for general purposes (adding the Fox logo on the underside of the top line of its heritage &quot;Circle Laser 2&quot; logo as well), while retaining &quot;(KTVU) Channel 2 News&quot; as the branding for its newscasts. Fox Television Stations (which traded WFXT in Boston and WHBQ-TV (channel 13) in Memphis station to Cox in 2014, in exchange for KTVU and sister station KICU-TV) instituted the &quot;KTVU Fox 2&quot; branding full-time in February 2015, retaining the &quot;Circle Laser 2&quot; both within the group&#x27;s standardized &quot;boxkite&quot; logo and in an alternate version (which would become the primary logo through its de-emphasis of the O&amp;O standardization later that year) placed next to a prominent Fox wordmark. Another situation also includes another Fox station KCPQ in Seattle, Washington, which as a Fox affiliate under Tribune Media and Nexstar Media Group, also retained the &quot;Q13 Fox&quot; name as well as the &quot;Q13 News&quot; name for its newscast until KCPQ dropped the Q13 moniker and rebranded itself to &quot;Fox 13&quot; in September 2021, conforming with the branding of other Fox O&amp;O stations after its acquisition by Fox.

Starting in 2006, more standardization of the O&amp;Os began to take place both on-air and online. All of the network&#x27;s O&amp;Os began adopting an on-air look more closely aligned with the Fox News Channel, which included a standardized red, white and blue boxkite-style logo augmented by red pillars (which rotated on-air, particularly in the logo bugs seen during newscasts). After News Corporation&#x27;s acquisition of the social networking site Myspace (which it sold in June 2011 to a consortium that included singer Justin Timberlake among its backers), some Fox O&amp;Os launched websites with identical layouts and similar URL domains under the &quot;MyFox&quot; scheme (such as MyFoxDC.com for WTTG). On-air usage of the FNC-inspired logos was reduced in August 2012 (when a new standardized graphics package was implemented, with wordmark bugs being used during newscasts and other programming), while several of the O&amp;Os ceased using the &quot;MyFox&quot; domains in 2015; the use of the Fox News Channel boxkite logos in all elements, along with explicit connections with the latter, was drastically reduced since the July 2016 resignation of Roger Ailes from Fox for a more traditional and simpler &#x27;call-channel number&#x27; horizontal wordmark style which is more flexible with both traditional television and smaller mobile screens. In 2017, Fox&#x27;s local newscast music composer, Stephen Arnold Music, released a new news music package, &quot;Beyond&quot;, that uses none of the Fox News Channel sonic elements associated with the previous Fox O&amp;O music package, and it has rolled out across all Fox O&amp;O local news operations.

As of 2017, Fox O&amp;O&#x27;s with a sister MyNetworkTV station in that market have also begun to play down that network, with many MyNetworkTV O&amp;O&#x27;s now taking on the branding of &quot;Fox (channel number) Plus/Xtra/More&quot;, etc., suggesting them as an extension of their higher-profile sister Fox station. Several of these stations now also carry extended newscasts or rebroadcasts of earlier newscasts from their sister stations during primetime, pushing MyNetworkTV&#x27;s schedule to a late night offering.

===Logos===
When Fox launched on October 9, 1986, as Fox Broadcasting Company, it used a logo with three squares containing the network&#x27;s initials (FBC) similar to BBC&#x27;s current logo from 1997–present in the UK. Below it was a rectangle with the network&#x27;s full name in the same font. This logo is mostly the same color as the ITV&#x27;s old logo from 1998 to 2004 in the UK, which was used during the network&#x27;s first six months in existence and was primarily featured as a network identification slide at the beginning of &quot;The Late Show with Joan Rivers&quot;. On April 5, 1987, when the network inaugurated its prime time programming, a more familiar logo based on 20th Century Fox&#x27;s signature logo design was introduced, featuring just the capitalized &quot;FOX&quot; name alongside the familiar trademark searchlights and double-pane platform (Fox&#x27;s owned-and-operated stations used a variant for station identifications from 1987 to 1989, which incorporated both an &quot;O&quot; and searchlight in negative space, the latter of which intersected the &quot;X&quot; and panes within the otherwise translucent yellow/gold logo; until as late as the mid-1990s, some Fox affiliates that did not license the regulation network logo, or which used CGI to output their station logos with local production houses which tried to emulate the parent network&#x27;s logo as close as possible, used those that imitated the 20th Century Fox-inspired design in their station logos).

In September 1993, the familiar logo was given a more &quot;hip&quot; makeover, with the &quot;FOX&quot; wordmark overhauled into its current proprietary logotype and the angle changed, removing the tilting (the 1987 logo remained in use during the 1993–94 season in print advertisements featured in &quot;TV Guide&quot; and other television listings magazines). Starting with the introduction of this logo, the network began displaying an on-screen bug within its programs on the lower right-hand corner of the screen (initially for one minute at the start of each program segment or act, eventually being displayed throughout the program outside commercial breaks, before reverting to the former display format regularly upon the 2009 digital transition). The &quot;O&quot; character also underwent a makeover, acquiring its trademark pillar-like bowl, which has since become a major focal point for the logo and Fox advertising in lieu of the searchlight motif. The &quot;O&quot; is alternately used as a zero character in the station logo of several Fox affiliates which have a tens channel location, including Phoenix&#x27;s channel 10, KSAZ-TV, and Sacramento affiliate KTXL-TV, channel 40.

Another revised logo was introduced for the 1995–96 television season, removing the searchlights, but retaining the two lower panes and adding a third pane atop the logotype. A variant of the original 1993 design was implemented in 1996, excluding the panes underneath the network name, but restoring the searchlights placed behind the &quot;F&quot; and &quot;X&quot; in the Fox wordmark.

The current version of the logo was introduced in 1999, removing the searchlights completely and switching the logo exclusively to a wordmark design. Despite this, the searchlight theme remained an integral part of 21st Century Fox&#x27;s branding efforts; they are still incorporated into Fox News Channel&#x27;s logo, and the universal station logo introduced in 2006 by Fox&#x27;s owned-and-operated stations – which were retained by the seven former O&amp;Os that Fox Television Stations sold in 2008 to Local TV and had spread to several Fox stations owned by Tribune Broadcasting (including those it acquired through the company&#x27;s 2013 merger with Local TV; the logo introduced by the O&amp;Os was modified for Tribune&#x27;s Fox affiliates in 2012 to feature only one searchlight as part of the company&#x27;s graphical standardizations for those stations) and certain other Fox affiliates not owned or operated by either company. The 1996–99 searchlight logo is still used within the logos of a small number of Fox affiliates; the searchlights continued to be featured in the logo of sister channel FX until a rebranding effort in 2008. The screen bug may have been used from 1999 to 2014; when the network upgraded to high-definition, the watermark placement remained at the 480i format. Until March 14, 2016, they did not display the on-screen bug, just the hashtag missing the Fox bug, used on some affiliates.

For the 2019–20 season, Fox implemented branding elements by Trollbäck + Company with the logo mark slightly thickened, along with animations of the mark with its shapes incorporated into advertising and on-air branding elements (including an animation of the abstract shapes morphing into the main Fox logo).

==Controversy==
Controversy surrounded the network in 2002 and 2003 over profanity, expressed respectively by Cher and Nicole Richie, aired live during Fox&#x27;s broadcast of the Billboard Music Awards on its affiliates in the Eastern and Central Time Zones despite the use of five-second audio delays; the indecent material was edited out when the program was broadcast in other time zones from the Mountain Time Zone westward. Both of the obscene instances were condemned by the Parents Television Council, and named by them among the worst instances on television from 2001 to 2004. PTC members filed tens of thousands of complaints to the Federal Communications Commission regarding the broadcasts. A subsequent apology made by Fox representatives was labeled a &quot;sham&quot; by PTC president L. Brent Bozell III, who argued that the network could have easily used an audio delay to edit out the obscene language. As the FCC was investigating the broadcasts, in 2004, Fox announced that it would begin extending live broadcast delays to five minutes from its standard five or ten seconds to more easily be able to edit out obscenities uttered over the air. In June 2007, in the case &quot;Federal Communications Commission v. Fox Television Stations&quot;, the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the FCC could not issue indecency fines against Fox because it does not have the authority to fine broadcasters for fleeting expletives, such as in the case of the Billboard Awards. The FCC eventually decided to appeal the Second Circuit Court&#x27;s finding. The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari and oral arguments in FCC v. Fox, et al., began November 4, 2008.

The Parents Television Council has also criticized many popular Fox shows for perceived indecent content, such as &quot;American Dad!&quot;, &quot;Arrested Development&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;, &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, &quot;Prison Break&quot;, and &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;. The Council sometimes has gone even as far as to file complaints with the Federal Communications Commission regarding indecent content within Fox programming, having done so for &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot; and &quot;Married by America&quot;, having successfully been able to get the FCC to fine the network nearly $1 million for its airing of the latter program. That fine was reduced to $91,000 in January 2009 after an appeal of the fine by Fox was granted as a result of its earlier discovery that the FCC originally claimed to have received 159 complaints regarding the content in &quot;Married by America&quot;; it later admitted to only receiving 90, which came from only 23 people. A study of the complaints by blogger Jeff Jarvis deduced that all but two were virtually identical to each other, meaning that the $1.2 million judgment was based on original complaints written by a total of only three people.
