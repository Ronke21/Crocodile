<text>Post-Keynesian economics is a school of economic thought with its origins in &quot;The General Theory&quot; of John Maynard Keynes, with subsequent development influenced to a large degree by Michał Kalecki, Joan Robinson, Nicholas Kaldor, Sidney Weintraub, Paul Davidson, Piero Sraffa and Jan Kregel. Historian Robert Skidelsky argues that the post-Keynesian school has remained closest to the spirit of Keynes&#x27; original work. It is a heterodox approach to economics based on a non-equilibrium approach.

==Introduction==
The term &quot;post-Keynesian&quot; was first used to refer to a distinct school of economic thought by Eichner and Kregel (1975) and by the establishment of the &quot;Journal of Post Keynesian Economics&quot; in 1978. Prior to 1975, and occasionally in more recent work, &quot;post-Keynesian&quot; could simply mean economics carried out after 1936, the date of Keynes&#x27;s &quot;General Theory&quot;.

Post-Keynesian economists are united in maintaining that Keynes&#x27; theory is seriously misrepresented by the two other principal Keynesian schools: neo-Keynesian economics, which was orthodox in the 1950s and 60s, and new Keynesian economics, which together with various strands of neoclassical economics has been dominant in mainstream macroeconomics since the 1980s. Post-Keynesian economics can be seen as an attempt to rebuild economic theory in the light of Keynes&#x27; ideas and insights. However, even in the early years, post-Keynesians such as Joan Robinson sought to distance themselves from Keynes, and much current post-Keynesian thought cannot be found in Keynes. Some post-Keynesians took a more progressive view than Keynes himself, with greater emphases on worker-friendly policies and redistribution. Robinson, Paul Davidson and Hyman Minsky emphasized the effects on the economy of practical differences between different types of investments, in contrast to Keynes&#x27; more abstract treatment.

The theoretical foundation of post-Keynesian economics is the principle of effective demand that demand matters in the long as well as the short run, so that a competitive market economy has no natural or automatic tendency towards full employment. Contrary to the views of new Keynesian economists working in the neoclassical tradition, post-Keynesians do not accept that the theoretical basis of the market&#x27;s failure to provide full employment is rigid or sticky prices or wages. Post-Keynesians typically reject the IS–LM model of John Hicks, which is very influential in neo-Keynesian economics, because they argue endogenous bank lending to be more significant than central banks&#x27; money supply for the interest rate.

The contribution of post-Keynesian economics has extended beyond the theory of aggregate employment to theories of income distribution, growth, trade and development in which money demand plays a key role, whereas in neoclassical economics these are determined by the forces of technology, preferences and endowment. In the field of monetary theory, post-Keynesian economists were among the first to emphasise that money supply responds to the demand for bank credit, so that a central bank cannot control the quantity of money, but only manage the interest rate by managing the quantity of monetary reserves.

This view has largely been incorporated into mainstream economics and monetary policy, which now targets the interest rate as an instrument, rather than attempting to accurately control the quantity of money. In the field of finance, Hyman Minsky put forward a theory of financial crisis based on financial fragility, which has received renewed attention.

== Main features ==
In 2009 Marc Lavoie listed the main features of post-Keynesian economics:
* Effective demand
* Historical and dynamic time

He also lists 5 auxiliary features:
* The possible negative impact of flexible prices
* The monetary production of the economy
* Fundamental uncertainty
* Relevant and contemporary microeconomics
* Pluralism of theories and methods

== Strands ==
There are a number of strands to post-Keynesian theory with different emphases. Joan Robinson regarded Michał Kalecki&#x27;s theory of effective demand to be superior to Keynes&#x27; theories. Kalecki&#x27;s theory is based on a class division between workers and capitalists and imperfect competition. Robinson also led the critique of the use of aggregate production functions based on homogeneous capital – the Cambridge capital controversy – winning the argument but not the battle. The writings of Piero Sraffa were a significant influence on the post-Keynesian position in this debate, though Sraffa and his neo-Ricardian followers drew more inspiration from David Ricardo than Keynes. Much of Nicholas Kaldor&#x27;s work was based on the ideas of increasing returns to scale, path dependence, and the key differences between the primary and industrial sectors.

Paul Davidson follows Keynes closely in placing time and uncertainty at the centre of theory, from which flow the nature of money and of a monetary economy. Monetary circuit theory, originally developed in continental Europe, places particular emphasis on the distinctive role of money as means of payment. Each of these strands continues to see further development by later generations of economists. An important method is stock-flow consistent models, which enable a consistent description of receivables and liabilities as well as cash flows.

Modern Monetary Theory is a relatively recent offshoot independently pioneered by Warren Mosler that models the currency itself as a public monopoly as the micro foundation of macro economics, thereby augmenting the theory of effective demand, recognizing that coercive taxation drives the currency (the tax credit) and that the price level is necessarily a function of prices paid by the state. Subsequent MMT associated academics have used macroeconomic modelling of Wynne Godley and incorporated some of Hyman Minsky&#x27;s ideas on the labour market, as well as chartalism and functional finance.

Recent work in post-Keynesian economics has attempted to provide micro-foundations for capacity underutilization as a coordination failure, justifying government intervention in the form of aggregate demand stimulus.

== Current work ==
=== Journals ===
Much post-Keynesian research is published in the &quot;Review of Keynesian Economics&quot; (ROKE), the &quot;Journal of Post Keynesian Economics&quot; (founded by Sidney Weintraub and Paul Davidson), the &quot;Cambridge Journal of Economics&quot;, the &quot;Review of Political Economy&quot;, and the &quot;Journal of Economic Issues&quot; (JEI).

=== United Kingdom ===
There is also a United Kingdom academic association, the Post-Keynesian Economics Society (PKES). It was founded by Philip Arestis and Victoria Chick in 1988 as the Post-Keynesian Economics Study Group (PKSG) and changed its name in 2018. In the UK, post-Keynesian economists can be found in:
* SOAS University of London
* University of Greenwich
* University of Leeds
* Kingston University
* King&#x27;s College London, International Political Economy
* Goldsmiths, University of London
* University of the West of England, Bristol
* University of Hertfordshire
* Cambridge University, Land Economy
* Birmingham City University
* University College London, Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose
* Open University
* University of Winchester
Working on post-Keynesian economic foundations, the UK-based global economics consultancy, Cambridge Econometrics, developed a computer-based &quot;Energy-Environment-Economy Model for Europe&quot; (E3ME) economic model. It is used by European Commission to analyse medium and long-term effects of its environmental and economic policies.

=== United States ===
In the United States, there are several universities with a post-Keynesian bent:
* The New School, New York City
* The University of Massachusetts Amherst
* The University of Utah, Salt Lake City
* Bucknell University, Lewisburg, Pennsylvania
* Denison University, Granville, Ohio
* Levy Economics Institute at Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, New York
* University of Missouri–Kansas City
* University of Denver
* Colorado State University, Fort Collins
* The University of Massachusetts Boston
* John Jay College of Criminal Justice at City University of New York, New York City

=== Netherlands ===
* Erasmus University, Rotterdam
* International Institute of Social Studies, The Hague
* Maastricht University, Maastricht
* University of Groningen, Groningen

=== France ===
* Sorbonne Paris North University

=== Canada ===

In Canada, post-Keynesians can be found at the University of Ottawa and Laurentian University.

=== Germany ===

In Germany, post-Keynesianism is very strong at the Berlin School of Economics and Law and its master&#x27;s degree courses: International Economics [M.A.] and Political Economy of European Integration [M.A.]. Many German Post-Keynesians are organized in the Forum Macroeconomics and Macroeconomic Policies.

=== Australia ===

==== University of Newcastle ====
The University of Newcastle in New South Wales, Australia, houses the post-Keynesian think-tank the Centre of Full Employment and Equity (CofFEE).

<text>Computer engineering (CE or CoE or CpE) is a branch of engineering specialized in developing computer hardware and software. 
It integrates several fields of electrical engineering, electronics engineering and computer science.
Computer engineering is referred to as &quot;electrical and computer engineering&quot; or &quot;computer science and engineering&quot; at some universities.

Computer engineers require training in hardware-software integration, software design, and software engineering. It can encompass areas such as electromagnetism, artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, computer networks, computer architecture and operating systems. Computer engineers are involved in many hardware and software aspects of computing, from the design of individual microcontrollers, microprocessors, personal computers, and supercomputers, to circuit design. This field of engineering not only focuses on how computer systems themselves work, but also on how to integrate them into the larger picture. Robotics are one of the applications of computer engineering.

Computer engineering usually deals with areas including writing software and firmware for embedded microcontrollers, designing VLSI chips, analog sensors, mixed signal circuit boards, Thermodynamics and Control systems. Computer engineers are also suited for robotics research, which relies heavily on using digital systems to control and monitor electrical systems like motors, communications, and sensors.

In many institutions of higher learning, computer engineering students are allowed to choose areas of in-depth study in their junior and senior years because the full breadth of knowledge used in the design and application of computers is beyond the scope of an undergraduate degree. Other institutions may require engineering students to complete one or two years of general engineering before declaring computer engineering as their primary focus.
==History==
Computer engineering began in 1939 when John Vincent Atanasoff and Clifford Berry began developing the world&#x27;s first electronic digital computer through physics, mathematics, and electrical engineering. John Vincent Atanasoff was once a physics and mathematics teacher for Iowa State University and Clifford Berry a former graduate under electrical engineering and physics. Together, they created the Atanasoff-Berry computer, also known as the ABC which took five years to complete.
While the original ABC was dismantled and discarded in the 1940s, a tribute was made to the late inventors; a replica of the ABC was made in 1997, where it took a team of researchers and engineers four years and $350,000 to build.

The modern personal computer emerged in the 1970s, after several breakthroughs in semiconductor technology. These include the first working transistor by William Shockley, John Bardeen and Walter Brattain at Bell Labs in 1947, in 1955, silicon dioxide surface passivation by Carl Frosch and Lincoln Derick, the first planar silicon dioxide transistors by Frosch and Derick in 1957, planar process by Jean Hoerni, the monolithic integrated circuit chip by Robert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1959, the metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET, or MOS transistor) demonstrated by a team at Bell Labs in 1960 and the single-chip microprocessor (Intel 4004) by Federico Faggin, Marcian Hoff, Masatoshi Shima and Stanley Mazor at Intel in 1971.

=== History of computer engineering education ===
The first computer engineering degree program in the United States was established in 1971 at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. , there were 250 ABET-accredited computer engineering programs in the U.S. In Europe, accreditation of computer engineering schools is done by a variety of agencies as part of the EQANIE network. Due to increasing job requirements for engineers who can concurrently design hardware, software, firmware, and manage all forms of computer systems used in industry, some tertiary institutions around the world offer a bachelor&#x27;s degree generally called computer engineering. Both computer engineering and electronic engineering programs include analog and digital circuit design in their curriculum. As with most engineering disciplines, having a sound knowledge of mathematics and science is necessary for computer engineers.

==Education==
Computer engineering is referred to as computer science and engineering at some universities. Most entry-level computer engineering jobs require at least a bachelor&#x27;s degree in computer engineering, electrical engineering or computer science. Typically one must learn an array of mathematics such as calculus, linear algebra and differential equations, along with computer science. Degrees in electronic or electric engineering also suffice due to the similarity of the two fields. Because hardware engineers commonly work with computer software systems, a strong background in computer programming is necessary. According to BLS, &quot;a computer engineering major is similar to electrical engineering but with some computer science courses added to the curriculum&quot;. Some large firms or specialized jobs require a master&#x27;s degree.

It is also important for computer engineers to keep up with rapid advances in technology. Therefore, many continue learning throughout their careers. This can be helpful, especially when it comes to learning new skills or improving existing ones. For example, as the relative cost of fixing a bug increases the further along it is in the software development cycle, there can be greater cost savings attributed to developing and testing for quality code as soon as possible in the process, particularly before release.

=== Professions ===
A person with a profession in computer engineering is called a computer engineer.
==Applications and practice==
There are two major focuses in computer engineering: hardware and software.

===Computer hardware engineering===

According to the United States BLS, job outlook employment for computer hardware engineers, the expected ten-year growth from 2019 to 2029 for computer hardware engineering was an estimated 2% and a total of 71,100 jobs. (&quot;Slower than average&quot; in their own words when compared to other occupations)&quot;. This is a decrease from the 2014 to 2024 BLS computer hardware engineering estimate of 3% and a total of 77,700 jobs; &quot;and is down from 7% for the 2012 to 2022 BLS estimate and is further down from 9% in the BLS 2010 to 2020 estimate.&quot; Today, computer hardware is somewhat equal to electronic and computer engineering (ECE) and has been divided into many subcategories, the most significant being embedded system design.

=== Computer software engineering ===
According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), &quot;computer applications software engineers and computer systems software engineers are projected to be among the faster than average growing occupations&quot; The expected ten-year growth for computer software engineering was an estimated seventeen percent and there was a total of 1,114,000 jobs that same year. This is down from the 2012 to 2022 BLS estimate of 22% for software developers. And, further down from the 30% 2010 to 2020 BLS estimate. In addition, growing concerns over cybersecurity add up to put computer software engineering high above the average rate of increase for all fields. However, some of the work will be outsourced in foreign countries. Due to this, job growth will not be as fast as during the last decade, as jobs that would have gone to computer software engineers in the United States would instead go to computer software engineers in countries such as India. In addition, the BLS job outlook for Computer Programmers, 2014–24 has an −8% (a decline, in their words), then a job outlook, 2019-29 of -9% (Decline), then a 10% decline for 2021-2031 and now an 11% decline for 2022-2032 for those who program computers (i.e. embedded systems) who are not computer application developers. Furthermore, women in software fields has been declining over the years even faster than other engineering fields.

==Specialty areas==
There are many specialty areas in the field of computer engineering.

===Processor design===

Processor design process involves choosing an instruction set and a certain execution paradigm (e.g. VLIW or RISC) and results in a microarchitecture, which might be described in e.g. VHDL or Verilog.

<text>The Cistercians (), officially the Order of Cistercians (, abbreviated as OCist or SOCist), are a Catholic religious order of monks and nuns that branched off from the Benedictines and follow the Rule of Saint Benedict, as well as the contributions of the highly influential Bernard of Clairvaux, known as the Latin Rule. They are also known as Bernardines, after Saint Bernard, or as White Monks, in reference to the colour of their cowl, as opposed to the black cowl worn by Benedictines.

The term &quot;Cistercian&quot; derives from &quot;Cistercium,&quot; the Latin name for the locale of Cîteaux, near Dijon in eastern France. It was here that a group of Benedictine monks from the monastery of Molesme founded Cîteaux Abbey in 1098. The first three abbots were Robert of Molesme, Alberic of Cîteaux and Stephen Harding. Bernard helped launch a new era when he entered the monastery in the early 1110s with 30 companions. By the end of the 12th century, the order had spread throughout most of Europe.

The keynote of Cistercian life was a return to literal observance of the Benedictine Rule. The reform-minded monks tried to live monastic life as they thought it had been in Benedict&#x27;s time; at various points they went beyond it in austerity. They returned to manual labour, especially agricultural work in the fields. The Cistercians made major contributions to culture and technology: Cistercian architecture has been recognized as a notable form of medieval architecture, and the Cistercians were the main force of technological diffusion in fields such as agriculture and hydraulic engineering.

Over the centuries, education and scholarship came to dominate the life of many monasteries. A reform movement seeking a simpler lifestyle began in 17th-century France at La Trappe Abbey, and became known as the Trappists. They were eventually consolidated in 1892 into a new order called the Order of Cistercians of the Strict Observance, abbreviated as OCSO. The Cistercians who remained within the Order of Cistercians are called the Cistercians of the Common Observance (OCist).

== Cistercian practices ==
The abbot general is the leader of the &quot;administrative machinery&quot; of a Cistercian order.

The burial practices for Cistercian monks involve complex rituals, and monks may be buried with or without shrouds.

=== No vow of silence ===
Cistercian monks and nuns have a reputation of cultivating solitude and silence; the great monastics have explained silence as &quot;the language of liberation, enlightenment, or union with God.&quot; Some observers deduced, incorrectly, that Cistercians take a vow of silence. Watching over one&#x27;s tongue is a general theme in the Rule of St. Benedict which, however, never required a vow of silence.

==Origins and early expansion==

===Foundation===
In 1098, a Benedictine abbot, Robert of Molesme, left Molesme Abbey in Burgundy with around 20 supporters, who felt that the Cluniac communities had abandoned the rigours and simplicity of the Rule of St. Benedict. Chief among Robert&#x27;s followers included Alberic, a former hermit from the nearby forest of Colan, and Stephen Harding, a young monk from England. Stephen had experienced the monastic traditions of the Camaldolese and Vallombrosians before joining Molesme Abbey.

On 21 March 1098, Robert&#x27;s small group acquired a plot of marshland just south of Dijon called Cîteaux (&quot;Latin:&quot; &quot;Cistercium&quot;. &quot;Cisteaux&quot; means reeds in Old French), given to them expressly for the purpose of founding their &quot;Novum Monasterium&quot;. During the first year, the monks set about constructing lodging areas and farming the lands of Cîteaux, making use of a nearby chapel for Mass. In Robert&#x27;s absence from Molesme, however, the abbey had gone into decline, and Pope Urban II, a former Cluniac monk, ordered him to return.

The remaining monks of Cîteaux elected Alberic as their abbot, under whose leadership the abbey would find its grounding. Robert had been the idealist of the order, and Alberic was their builder. Upon assuming the role of abbot, Alberic moved the site of the fledgling community near a brook a short distance away from the original site. Alberic discontinued the use of Benedictine black garments in the abbey and clothed the monks in white habits of undyed wool. Alberic forged an alliance with the Dukes of Burgundy, working out a deal with Duke Odo I of Burgundy concerning the donation of a vineyard (Meursault) as well as materials for building the abbey church, which was consecrated on 16 November 1106 by the Bishop of Chalon sur Saône.

On 26 January 1108, Alberic died and was succeeded by Stephen Harding, the man responsible for carrying the order into its crucial phase.

====Cistercian reform====

Harding framed the original version of the Cistercian constitution, soon to be called the &quot;Carta Caritatis&quot; (&quot;Charter of Charity&quot;). Although it was revised on several occasions to meet contemporary needs, from the outset it emphasised a simple life of work, love, prayer and self-denial. The Cistercians soon came to distinguish themselves from Benedictines by wearing white or grey tunics instead of black; white habits are common for reform movements. Much of Cistercian reform took place against the rivalry with the famous Benedictine abbey of Cluny, where wealth and excess were said to have set in.

Harding acquired land for the abbey to develop to ensure its survival and ethic. As to grants of land, the order would normally accept only undeveloped land, which the monks then developed by their own labour. For this they developed over time a very large component of uneducated lay brothers known as &quot;conversi&quot;. In some cases, the order accepted developed land and relocated the serfs elsewhere.

=====Charter of Charity=====
The outlines of the Cistercian reform were adumbrated by Alberic, but it received its final form in the &quot;Carta caritatis&quot; (&quot;Charter of Charity&quot;), which was the defining guide on how the reform was to be lived. This document governed the relations between the various houses of the Cistercian order, and exercised a great influence also upon the future course of western monachism. From one point of view, it may be regarded as a compromise between the primitive Benedictine system, in which each abbey was autonomous and isolated, and the centralization of Cluny.

The Cistercians maintained the independence of individual houses: each abbey had its own abbot, elected by its own monks, and its own property and finances administered without outside interference. On the other hand, all the abbeys were subjected to the General Chapter, the constitutional body which exercised vigilance over the order. Made up of all the abbots, the General Chapter met annually in mid-September at Cîteaux. Attendance was compulsory, with the abbot of Cîteaux presiding. He was to enforce conformity to Cîteaux in all details of monastic observance, liturgy, and customs. Cîteaux was always to be the model to which all the other houses had to conform.

=== Cistercian nuns ===
The first community of Cistercian nuns, Tart, was founded 1125 in the Diocese of Langres. Their number rose so quickly in the course of the next century that the historian and cardinal Jacques de Vitry wrote: &quot;Cistercian nunneries multiplied like stars in the sky.&quot; At their most populous point, there may have been over 900 women&#x27;s monasteries, but not all were officially integrated into the order. One of the best known of Cistercian women&#x27;s communities was the Abbey of Port-Royal, associated with the Jansenist controversy. In Spain and France, a number of Cistercian abbesses had extraordinary privileges.

== International expansion ==
In the 1130s and 1140s, the Cistercians expanded into &quot;an order of immense size&quot; by incorporating independent religious communities.

=== France ===
In 1113, Bernard joined the Cîteaux monastery along with 35 relatives and friends. Bernard&#x27;s charisma greatly expanded the size of the order. In 1115, Count Hugh of Champagne gifted the order a tract of forested land located forty miles east of Troyes. At the age of 25, Bernard founded the Abbey of Clairvaux with twelve other monks. At this time, Cîteaux had four daughter houses: Pontigny, Morimond, La Ferté and Clairvaux.

The most foundations made by any Cistercian monastery came from Clairvaux.

=== Austria ===
Rein Abbey was founded in 1129 from Ebrach Abbey in Bavaria, which had been founded from Morimond Abbey in France. In 1129 Margrave Leopold the Strong of Styria granted the Bavarian monks an area of land just north of what is today the provincial capital Graz, where they founded Rein Abbey. At the time, it was the 38th Cistercian monastery founded; as of 2024, it is the oldest surviving Cistercian house in the world. In 1133, Heiligenkreuz Abbey was founded near Vienna by Morimond monks; it is (as of 2024) the largest men&#x27;s abbey in Europe.

=== Britain ===
The order entrusted the oversight of the English, Welsh and (intermittently) Irish abbeys to two or more abbots-commissary, thereby abrogating the famous Cistercian system of filiation: not the mother abbeys, but the abbots-commisary had full powers of visitation. This variation on the original vertical descent of authority produced &quot;a system of centralized national control&quot; much closer to that of the Premonstratensians or mendicants. The first Cistercian house to be established in Britain, a monastery at Waverley Abbey, Surrey, was founded by William Gifford, Bishop of Winchester in 1128. It was founded with 12 monks and an abbot from L&#x27;Aumône Abbey, in the South of France. By 1187 there were 70 monks and 120 lay brothers in residence.

Thirteen Cistercian monasteries, all in remote locations, were founded in Wales between 1131 and 1226. The first of these was Tintern Abbey, which was sited in a remote river valley, and depended largely on its agricultural and pastoral activities for survival. Other abbeys, such as at Neath, Strata Florida, Conwy and Valle Crucis became among the most hallowed names in the history of religion in medieval Wales. Their austere discipline seemed to echo the ideals of the Celtic saints, and the emphasis on pastoral farming fit well into the Welsh stock-rearing economy.

In Yorkshire, Rievaulx Abbey was founded from Clairvaux in 1131, on a small, isolated property donated by Walter Espec, with the support of Thurstan, Archbishop of York. By 1143, three hundred monks had entered Rievaulx, including the famous St Ælred. It was from Rievaulx that a foundation was made at Melrose, which became the earliest Cistercian monastery in Scotland. Located in Roxburghshire, it was built in 1136 by King David I of Scotland, and completed in less than ten years. Another important offshoot of Rievaulx was Revesby Abbey in Lincolnshire.

Fountains Abbey was founded in 1132 by discontented Benedictine monks from St. Mary&#x27;s Abbey, York, who desired a return to the austere Rule of St Benedict. After many struggles and great hardships, St Bernard agreed to send a monk from Clairvaux to instruct them, and in the end they prospered. Already by 1152, Fountains had many offshoots, including Newminster Abbey (1137) and Meaux Abbey (1151).

=== Ireland ===
In the spring of 1140, Saint Malachy, the archbishop of Armagh, visited Clairvaux, becoming a personal friend of Abbot Bernard and an admirer of Cistercian life. He left four of his companions to be trained as Cistercians, and returned to Ireland to introduce Cistercian monasticism there. Mellifont Abbey was founded in County Louth in 1142 and from it daughter houses of Bective Abbey in County Meath (1147), Inislounaght Abbey in County Tipperary (1147–1148), Baltinglass in County Wicklow (1148), Monasteranenagh in County Limerick (1148), Kilbeggan in County Westmeath (1150) and Boyle Abbey in County Roscommon (1161).

Following the Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland in the 1170s, the English improved the standing of the Cistercian Order in Ireland with nine foundations: Dunbrody Abbey, Inch Abbey, Grey Abbey, Comber Abbey, Duiske Abbey, Abington, Abbeylara and Tracton. This last abbey was founded in 1225 from Whitland Abbey in Wales, and at least in its earliest years, its monks were Welsh-speaking. By this time, another ten abbeys had been founded by Irishmen since the invasion, bringing the total number of Cistercian houses in Ireland to 31. This was almost half the number of those in England, but it was about thrice the number in each of Scotland and Wales. Most of these monasteries enjoyed either noble, episcopal or royal patronage. In 1269, the Archbishop of Cashel joined the order and established a Cistercian house at the foot of the Rock of Cashel in 1272. Similarly, the Irish-establishment of Abbeyknockmoy in County Galway was founded by King of Connacht, Cathal Crobhdearg Ua Conchobair, who died a Cistercian monk and was buried there in 1224.

By 1152, there were 54 Cistercian monasteries in England, few of which had been founded directly from the Continent. Overall, there were 333 Cistercian abbeys in Europe, so many that a halt was put to this expansion. Nearly half of these houses had been founded, directly or indirectly, from Clairvaux, so great was St Bernard&#x27;s influence and prestige. He later came popularly to be regarded as the founder of the Cistercians, who have often been called Bernardines. Bernard died in 1153, one month after his pupil Eugene III.

=== The Iberian Peninsula ===

In 1153, the first King of Portugal, D. Afonso Henriques (Afonso, I), founded Alcobaça Monastery. The original church was replaced by the present construction from 1178. The abbey&#x27;s church was consecrated in 1223. Two further building phases followed in order to complete the nave, leading to the final consecration of the medieval church building in 1252.

As a consequence of the wars between the Christians and Moors on the Iberian Peninsula, the Cistercians established a military branch of the order in Castile in 1157: the Order of Calatrava. Membership of the Cistercian Order had included a large number of men from knightly families, and when King Alfonso VII began looking for a military order to defend the Calatrava, which had been recovered from the Moors a decade before, the Cistercian Abbot Raymond of Fitero offered his help. Lay brothers were to be employed as &quot;soldiers of the Cross&quot; to defend Calatrava. The initial successes of the new order in the Spanish Reconquista were convincing, and the arrangement was approved by the General Chapter at Cîteaux and successive popes; the Knights of Calatrava were given a definitive rule in 1187, modeled upon the Cistercian rule for lay brothers, which included the evangelical counsels of poverty, chastity, and obedience; specific rules of silence; abstinence on four days a week; the recitation of a fixed number of Pater Nosters daily; to sleep in their armour; and to wear, as their full dress, the Cistercian white mantle with the scarlet cross &quot;fleurdelisée&quot;.

Calatrava was not subject to Cîteaux, but to Fitero&#x27;s mother-house, the Abbey of Morimond in Burgundy. By the end of the 13th century, the knights had become a major autonomous power within the Castilian state, subject only to Morimond and the pope. They had abundant resources of men and wealth, lands and castles scattered along the borders of Castile, and feudal lordship over thousands of peasants and vassals. On more than one occasion, the Order of Calatrava brought to the field a force of 1200 to 2000 knights – considerable in medieval terms. Over time, as the Reconquista neared completion, the canonical bond between Calatrava and Morimond relaxed more and more, and the knights of the order became virtually secularized, finally undergoing dissolution in the 18th–19th centuries.

The first Cistercian abbey in Bohemia was founded in Sedlec near Kutná Hora in 1142. In the late 13th century and early 14th century, the Cistercian order played an essential role in the politics and diplomacy of the late Přemyslid and early Luxembourg state, as reflected in the &quot;Chronicon Aulae Regiae&quot;. This chronicle was written by Otto and Peter of Zittau, abbots of the Zbraslav abbey (Latin: &quot;Aula Regia&quot;, &quot;Royal Hall&quot;), founded in 1292 by the King of Bohemia and Poland, Wenceslas II. The order also played the main role in the early Gothic art of Bohemia; one of the outstanding pieces of Cistercian architecture is the Alt-neu Shul, Prague. The first abbey in the present day Romania was founded in 1179, at Igris (Egres), and the second in 1204, the Cârța Monastery.

By the end of the 13th century, the Cistercian houses numbered 500. In this period, the monks performed pastoral tasks in and outside of the monastery and began preaching and teaching, even though their movement originally forbade schools and parishes. At the order&#x27;s height in the 15th century, it would have nearly 750 houses.

It often happened that the number of lay brothers became excessive and out of proportion to the resources of the monasteries, there being sometimes as many as 200, or even 300, in a single abbey. On the other hand, in some countries, the system of lay brothers in course of time worked itself out; thus in England by the close of the 14th century it had shrunk to relatively small proportions, and in the 15th century the regimen of the English Cistercian houses tended to approximate more and more to that of the Black Monks.

== Influence with popes and kings ==
Cistercian influence more than kept pace with the material expansion. St. Bernard had become mentor to popes and kings, and in 1145, King Louis VII&#x27;s brother, Henry of France, entered Clairvaux. That same year, Bernard saw one of his monks elected pope as Pope Eugene III. Eugene was an Italian of humble background, who had first been drawn to monasticism at Clairvaux by the magnetism of Bernard. At the time of his election, he was Abbot of Saints Vincenzo and Anastasio outside Rome.
A considerable reinforcement to the Order was the merger of the Savigniac houses with the Cistercians, at the insistence of Eugene III. Thirteen English abbeys, of which the most famous were Furness Abbey and Jervaulx Abbey, thus adopted the Cistercian formula. In Dublin, the two Savigniac houses of Erenagh and St Mary&#x27;s became Cistercian. It was in the latter case that medieval Dublin acquired a Cistercian monastery in the very unusual suburban location of Oxmantown, with its own private harbour called The Pill.

== Decline and attempted reforms ==
For a hundred years, until the first quarter of the 13th century, the Cistercians supplanted Cluny as the most powerful order and the chief religious influence in western Europe. But then in turn their influence began to wane, as the initiative passed to the mendicant orders, in Ireland, Wales and elsewhere.

Relaxations were gradually introduced into Cistercian life with regard to diet and simplicity of life. Also, they began accepting the traditional sources of income that monks in comparable orders used: like rents, tolls, and benefices. The agricultural operations were blessed by success. Wealth and splendour characterized the monasteries, so that by 1300, the standard of living in most abbeys was comparable, if not higher, than the standards middling nobles enjoyed. Two important papal bulls tried to introduce reforms: Clement IV&#x27;s &quot;Parvus fons&quot; and Benedict XII&#x27;s &quot;Fulgens sicut stella matutina&quot;. The General Chapter continued to battle against abuses.
In Ireland, the information on the Cistercian Order after the Anglo-Norman invasion gives a rather gloomy impression. Absenteeism among Irish abbots at the General Chapter became a persistent and much criticised problem in the 13th century, and escalated into the &quot;conspiratio Mellifontis&quot;, a &quot;rebellion&quot; by the abbeys of the Mellifont filiation. Visitors were appointed to reform Mellifont on account of the &quot;multa enormia&quot; that had arisen there, but in 1217 the abbot refused their admission and had lay brothers bar the abbey gates. There was also trouble at Jerpoint, and alarmingly, the abbots of Baltinglass, Killenny, Kilbeggan and Bective supported the actions of the &quot;revolt&quot;.

In 1228, the General Chapter sent the Abbot of Stanley in Wiltshire, Stephen of Lexington, on a well-documented visitation to reform the Irish houses. A graduate of both Oxford and Paris, and a future Abbot of Clairvaux (to be appointed in 1243), Stephen was one of the outstanding figures in 13th-century Cistercian history, having founded the College of St. Bernard in Paris in 1244. He found his life threatened as a result of the Irish visitations: his representatives were attacked and his party harassed, while the three key houses of Mellifont, Suir and Maigue had been fortified by monks to hold out against him. However, with the help of his assistants, the core of obedient Irish monks and the aid of both English and Irish secular powers, he was able to envisage the reconstruction of the Cistercian province in Ireland. Stephen dissolved the Mellifont filiation altogether, and subjected 15 monasteries to houses outside Ireland. In breadth and depth, his instructions constituted a radical reform programme: &quot;They were intended to put an end to abuses, restore the full observance of the Cistercian way of life, safeguard monastic properties, initiate a regime of benign paternalism to train a new generation of religious, isolate trouble-makers and institute an effective visitation system.&quot; The arrangement lasted almost half a century, and in 1274, the filiation of Mellifont was reconstituted.

In Germany the Cistercians were instrumental in the spread of Christianity east of the Elbe. They developed grants of territories of 180,000 acres where they would drain land, build monasteries and plan villages. Many towns near Berlin owe their origins to this order, including Heiligengrabe and Chorin; its Chorin Abbey was the first brick-built monastery in the area. By this time, however, &quot;the Cistercian order as a whole had experienced a gradual decline and its central organisation was noticeably weakened.&quot;
In 1335, the French cardinal Jacques Fournier, a Cistercian monk, was elected and consecrated Pope Benedict XII. He was devoted to reducing the culture of nepotism at the Vatican. He promulgated a series of regulations to restore the spirit of reform in the Cistercian Order.

By the 15th century, however, the Cistercians had fallen on dark days. The General Chapter lost virtually all its power to enforce its decrees, and the strength of the order which derived from this uniformity declined. Wars, amon them the Hundred Years&#x27; War, and a lack of leadership did damage. Many of the monasteries were controlled by dynasties who appointed their relatives to leadership positions, and pocketed the abbeys&#x27; profits. The system of placing abbeys &quot;in commendam&quot; was widespread and led to the spiritual and material decline of many abbeys.

== Protestant Reformation ==

Germany became the scene of violence and destabilization following Martin Luther&#x27;s efforts to gain independence from the Vatican. Many abbeys lost scores of monks, as these left religious life in order to marry. Monastic property was confiscated by nobles who saw an opportunity to profit from the chaos. During the English Reformation, Henry VIII&#x27;s Dissolution of the Monasteries saw the confiscation of every single monastery in that country, a disaster not only for the Cistercians. Some historians believe that the suppression of the English monasteries may have stamped out an industrial revolution.

=== After the Reformation ===

The reformed Congregation of the Feuillants spread widely in France and Italy in the 16th century. The French congregation of Sept-Fontaines (1654) also deserves mention. In 1663 Jean de Rancé reformed La Trappe (see Trappists).

In the 17th century another great effort at a general reform was made, promoted by the pope and the king of France; the general chapter elected Richelieu to be (commendatory) abbot of Cîteaux, thinking he would protect them from the threatened reform. In this they were disappointed, for he threw himself wholly on the side of reform. A formidable battle ensued, making it clear that Italian and Central European abbeys did not want to go the way of the Trappists. Civic politics also played a role in the conflict.

The Protestant Reformation, the ecclesiastical policy of Emperor Joseph II, the French Revolution, and the revolutions of the 18th century almost wholly destroyed the Cistercians. But some survived, and from the beginning of the last half of the 19th century there was a considerable recovery.

In 1892, the Trappists left the Cistercians and founded a new order, named the Order of Cistercians of the Strict Observance. The Cistercians that remained within the original order thus came to be known as the &quot;Common Observance&quot;.

==Influence==

===Architecture===


Cistercian architecture has made an important contribution to European civilisation. Cistercian foundations were primarily constructed in Romanesque and Gothic architecture during the Middle Ages; although later abbeys were also constructed in Renaissance and Baroque.

St. Bernard saw church decoration as a distraction from piety, and the builders of the Cistercian monasteries had to adopt a style that followed his austere aesthetics. However, contrary to what is often claimed, there were no fixed building rules in the Cistercian order. Furthermore, the order itself was receptive to the technical improvements of Gothic principles of construction and played an important role in its spread across Europe.

Cistercian architecture embodied the ideals of the order, and was in theory at least utilitarian and without ornamentation. The same &quot;rational, integrated scheme&quot; was used across Europe to meet the largely homogeneous needs of the order. Various buildings, including the chapter-house to the east and the dormitories above, were grouped around a cloister, and were sometimes linked to the transept of the church itself by a night stair. Usually Cistercian churches were cruciform, with a short presbytery to meet the liturgical needs of the brethren, small chapels in the transepts for private prayer, and an aisled nave that was divided roughly in the middle by a screen to separate the monks from the lay brothers.

=== Engineering and construction ===

The building projects of the Church in the High Middle Ages showed that the era encourage colossal architecture, with vast amounts of stone being quarried; the same was true of the Cistercian projects. Foigny Abbey was long, and Vaucelles Abbey was long. Monastic buildings came to be constructed entirely of stone, right down to the most humble of buildings. In the 12th and 13th centuries, even Cistercian barns consisted had stone exteriors.

The Cistercians acquired a reputation as masters in administering ecclesial construction projects. St. Bernard&#x27;s own brother, Achard, is known to have supervised the construction of many abbeys, such as Himmerod Abbey in the Rhineland. On one occasion the abbot of La Trinité at Vendôme loaned a monk named John to the Bishop of Le Mans, Hildebert de Lavardin, for the building of a cathedral; after the project was completed, John refused to return to his monastery. However, the monks did not construct their edifices alone. As early as 1133, St. Bernard was hiring workers to help the monks erect new buildings at Clairvaux. An illustration from the 16th century shows monks working alongside other craftsmen at Schönau Abbey.

====Legacy====
The Cistercian abbeys of Fontenay in France, Fountains in England, Alcobaça in Portugal, Poblet in Spain and Maulbronn in Germany are today recognised as UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

The abbeys of France and England are fine examples of Romanesque and Gothic architecture. The architecture of Fontenay has been described as &quot;an excellent illustration of the ideal of self-sufficiency&quot; practised by the earliest Cistercian communities. The abbeys of 12th century England were stark and undecorated – a dramatic contrast with the elaborate churches of the wealthier Benedictine houses – yet to even the Cistercian ruins, such as in Fountains and Tinturn Abbey, attracted many tourists, pilgrims and poets.

In the purity of architectural style, the beauty of materials and the care with which the Alcobaça Monastery was built, Portugal possesses one of the most outstanding and best preserved examples of Early Gothic. Poblet Monastery, one of the largest in Spain, is considered similarly impressive for its austerity, majesty, and the fortified royal residence within.

The fortified Maulbronn Abbey in Germany is considered &quot;the most complete and best-preserved medieval monastic complex north of the Alps&quot;. The Transitional Gothic style of its church had a major influence in the spread of Gothic architecture over much of northern and central Europe, and the abbey&#x27;s elaborate network of drains, irrigation canals and reservoirs has since been recognised as having &quot;exceptional&quot; cultural interest.

In Poland, the former Cistercian monastery of Pelplin Cathedral is an important example of Brick Gothic. Wąchock Abbey is one of the most valuable examples of Polish Romanesque architecture. The largest Cistercian complex, the Abbatia Lubensis (Lubiąż, Poland), is a masterpiece of baroque architecture and the second largest Christian architectural complex in the world.

== Art ==
The mother house of the order, Cîteaux, had developed an advanced style of painting in illuminated manuscripts during the first decades of the 12th century. However, as Bernard of Clairvaux&#x27;s influence increased, decoration gradually diminished in Cistercian manuscripts. He had a strong aversion to the extensive use of imagery. Decorations were finally banned altogether in the order. Any wall paintings that may have existed were presumably destroyed. Crucifixes were allowed, and later some painting and decoration crept back in. Bernard criticized abbey churches for their &quot;immoderate length, their superfluous breadth, the costly polishings, the curious carvings and paintings which attract the worshipper&#x27;s gaze and hinder his attention.&quot; He loathed the fantastical, often deformed beasts used in medievial church decoration. Weaker monks would be tempted &quot;to spend the whole day in wondering at these things rather than in meditating the law of God.&quot;
Nonetheless, many Cistercian abbey churches housed the tombs of royal or noble patrons, and these were often elaborately carved and painted. Notable dynastic burial places were Alcobaça for the Kings of Portugal, Cîteaux for the Dukes of Burgundy, and Poblet for the Kings of Aragon. Corcomroe in Ireland contains one of only two surviving examples of Gaelic royal effigies from 13th and 14th century Ireland.

== Agriculture, technology, and commerce ==

Successful farmers, the white monks introduced and propagated many improvements in medieval agriculture. They developed an organised system for selling produce, cattle and horses, and notably contributed to commercial progress in Western Europe. To the wool and cloth trade, which was especially fostered by the Cistercians, England was largely indebted for the beginnings of her commercial prosperity.

From the beginning, the monks used a system of lay brothers and employees to operate their farms; monks and priests were busy with their liturgical and sacramental duties. The lay brothers formed a body of men who lived alongside of the choir monks, but separate from them, not taking part in the canonical office, but having their own fixed round of prayer and religious exercises. They were not ordained, nor did they have a voice in the monks&#x27; chapter.

One Cistercian monk claims that, until the Industrial Revolution, most of the technological advances in Europe were made in the monasteries. According to the medievalist Jean Gimpel, their high level of industrial technology facilitated the diffusion of new techniques: &quot;Every monastery had a model factory, often as large as the church and only several feet away, and waterpower drove the machinery of the various industries located on its floor.&quot; Waterpower was used for crushing wheat, sieving flour, fulling cloth and tanning – a technological achievement in use in practically all of the order&#x27;s monasteries. The monks used their own numbering system, which could express all the numbers from 0 to 9999 in a single sign.
The Cistercian order was innovative in developing techniques of hydraulic engineering for monasteries established in remote valleys. In Spain, one of the earliest surviving Cistercian houses, the Real Monasterio de Nuestra Senora de Rueda in Aragon, is a good example of such early hydraulic engineering, using a large waterwheel for power and an elaborate water circulation system for central heating.

The Cistercians are known to have been skilled metallurgists, and knowledge of their technological advances was transmitted by the order. Iron ore deposits were often donated to the monks along with forges to extract the iron, and within time surpluses were being offered for sale. The Cistercians became the leading iron producers in Champagne, from the mid-13th century to the 17th century, also using the phosphate-rich slag from their furnaces as an agricultural fertiliser. The forge at Fontenay abbey, for instance, is not on the margins of the abbey grounds, but within the monastic enclosure itself. Cistercian innovations may have shaped the very course of Gothic architecture.

== Theology ==

By far the most influential of the early Cistercians was Bernard of Clairvaux. He attracted vocations, served as a papal envoy, and attracted international attention to the movement: he was &quot;one of the most influential churchmen of his time.&quot; Bernard was an ascetic and intellectual, which he demonstrated in his sermons on Grace, Free will and the Song of Songs. He was quick to recognise heretical ideas, and in 1141 and 1145 respectively, he accused the celebrated scholastic theologian Peter Abelard and the popular preacher Henry of Lausanne of heresy. He was also charged with the task of promulgating Pope Eugene&#x27;s bull, &quot;Quantum praedecessores&quot;, and his eloquence in preaching the Second Crusade recruited many to the cause.

Although Bernard&#x27;s &quot;De laude novae militiae&quot; was in favour of the Knights Templar, the English Cistercian Abbot Isaac of Stella, near Poitiers, preached against the very same group as a &quot;new monstrosity&quot;. In the course of the 12th and 13th centuries, many Cistercian authors wrote on spiritual topics. The &quot;four evangelists&quot; of the movement are: Bernard, William of Saint Thierry, Aelred of Rievaulx, and Guerric of Igny. Besides Bernard, the others were only re-discovered in the 20th century.

==Cistercians today==

Many Cistercian monasteries make produce goods such as cheese, bread, and craft products. In the United States, some abbeys support themselves through agriculture, forestry and real estate. European Trappist monasteries are known for their beer.

<text>The Sierra Nevada ( ) is a mountain range in the Western United States, between the Central Valley of California and the Great Basin. The vast majority of the range lies in the state of California, although the Carson Range spur lies primarily in Nevada. The Sierra Nevada is part of the American Cordillera, an almost continuous chain of mountain ranges that forms the western &quot;backbone&quot; of the Americas.

The Sierra runs north-south, and its width ranges from to across east–west. Notable features include General Sherman, the largest tree in the world by volume; Lake Tahoe, the largest alpine lake in North America; Mount Whitney at , the highest point in the contiguous United States; and Yosemite Valley sculpted by glaciers from one-hundred-million-year-old granite, containing high waterfalls. The Sierra is home to three national parks, twenty-six wilderness areas, ten national forests, and two national monuments. These areas include Yosemite, Sequoia, and Kings Canyon National Parks, as well as Devils Postpile National Monument.

More than one hundred million years ago during the Nevadan orogeny, granite formed deep underground. The range started to uplift less than five million years ago, and erosion by glaciers exposed the granite and formed the light-colored mountains and cliffs that make up the range. The uplift caused a wide range of elevations and climates in the Sierra Nevada, which are reflected by the presence of five life zones (areas with similar plant and animal communities). Uplift continues due to faulting caused by tectonic forces, creating spectacular fault block escarpments along the eastern edge of the southern Sierra.

The Sierra Nevada has played an important role in the history of California and the United States. The California gold rush occurred in the western foothills from 1848 through 1855. Due to its inaccessibility, the range was not fully explored until 1912.

==Name and etymology==

Used in 1542 by Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo to describe a Pacific Coast Range (Santa Cruz Mountains), the term &quot;Sierra Nevada&quot; was a general identification of less familiar ranges toward the interior. In 1776, Pedro Font&#x27;s map applied the name to the range currently known as the Sierra Nevada.

The literal translation is &quot;snowy mountains&quot;, from &quot;sierra&quot; &quot;a range of mountains&quot;, 1610s, from Spanish &quot;jagged mountain range&quot;, lit. &quot;saw&quot;, from Latin &quot;a saw&quot;; and from the Spanish adjective &quot;snowy&quot;.

While many mountain ranges are unanimously referred to in the plural (Smokies, Rockies, Cascades, etc.), some locals who live in &quot;the Sierra&quot; are not hesitant to admonish those who refer to the area as &quot;the Sierras&quot;. However, there are historical and literary references that use the plural, such as the 1871 collection of Joaquin Miller poems, &quot;Songs of the Sierras&quot;. Ansel Adams, in response to a publication of his photographs under the title &quot;Parmelian Prints of the High Sierras&quot;, commented, &quot;To add an &quot;s&quot; is a linguistic, Californian, and mountaineering sin.&quot;

==Geography==

The Sierra Nevada lies primarily in Central and Eastern California, with the Carson Range, a small but historically important spur, extending into Nevada. West-to-east, the Sierra Nevada&#x27;s elevation increases gradually from in the Central Valley to more than atop the highest peaks of its crest to the east. The east slope forms the steep Sierra Escarpment. Unlike its surroundings, the range receives a substantial amount of snowfall and precipitation due to orographic lift.

===Setting===
The Sierra Nevada&#x27;s irregular northern boundary stretches from the Susan River and Fredonyer Pass to the North Fork Feather River. It represents where the granitic bedrock of the Sierra Nevada dives below the southern extent of Cenozoic igneous surface rock from the Cascade Range. It is bounded on the west by California&#x27;s Central Valley, on the east by the Basin and Range Province, and on the southeast by the Mojave Desert. The southern boundary is at Tehachapi Pass.

Physiographically, the Sierra is a section of the Cascade–Sierra Mountains province, which in turn is part of the larger Pacific Mountain System physiographic division. The California Geological Survey states that &quot;the northern Sierra boundary is marked where bedrock disappears under the Cenozoic volcanic cover of the Cascade Range.&quot;

===Watersheds===

The range is drained on its western slope by the Central Valley watershed, which discharges into the Pacific Ocean at San Francisco. The northern third of the western Sierra is part of the Sacramento River watershed (including the Feather, Yuba, and American River tributaries), and the middle third is drained by the San Joaquin River (including the Mokelumne, Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and Merced River tributaries). The southern third of the range is drained by the Kings, Kaweah, Tule, and Kern rivers, which flow into the endorheic basin of Tulare Lake, which rarely overflows into the San Joaquin during wet years.

The eastern slope watershed of the Sierra is much narrower; its rivers flow out into the endorheic Great Basin of eastern California and western Nevada. From north to south, the Susan River flows into intermittent Honey Lake, the Truckee River flows from Lake Tahoe into Pyramid Lake, the Carson River runs into Carson Sink, the Walker River into Walker Lake; Rush, Lee Vining and Mill Creeks flow into Mono Lake; and the Owens River into dry Owens Lake. Although none of the eastern rivers reach the sea, many of the streams from Mono Lake southwards are diverted into the Los Angeles Aqueduct which provides water to Southern California.

===Elevation===
The height of the mountains in the Sierra Nevada increases gradually from north to south. Between Fredonyer Pass and Lake Tahoe, the peaks range from to more than . The crest near Lake Tahoe is roughly high, with several peaks approaching the height of Freel Peak (). Farther south, the highest peak in Yosemite National Park is Mount Lyell (). The Sierra rises to almost with Mount Humphreys near Bishop, California. Finally, near Lone Pine, Mount Whitney is at , the highest point in the contiguous United States.

South of Mount Whitney, the elevation of the range quickly dwindles. The crest elevation is almost near Lake Isabella, but south of the lake, the peaks reach only a modest .

===Notable features===

There are several notable geographical features in the Sierra Nevada:

* Lake Tahoe is a large, clear freshwater lake in the northern Sierra Nevada, with an elevation of and an area of . Lake Tahoe lies between the main Sierra and the Carson Range, a spur of the Sierra.
* Hetch Hetchy Valley, Yosemite Valley, Kings Canyon, and Kern Canyon are examples of many glacially-scoured canyons on the west side of the Sierra.
* Yosemite National Park is filled with notable features such as waterfalls, granite domes, high mountains, lakes, and meadows.
* Groves of giant sequoias &quot;Sequoiadendron giganteum&quot; occur along a narrow band of altitude on the western side of the Sierra Nevada. Giant sequoias are the largest trees in the world.
* Two of the largest rivers in California, which form the Central Valley and drain into San Francisco Bay, derive most of their flow from the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada. The northern of the two is the Sacramento River (which also drains the adjacent Cascade Range and Klamath Range); the southern one is the San Joaquin River.

===Communities===
Communities in the Sierra Nevada include Paradise, South Lake Tahoe, Truckee, Grass Valley, Lee Vining, Mammoth Lakes, Sonora, Nevada City, Placerville, Pollock Pines, Portola, Auburn, Colfax, Kennedy Meadows and Shaver Lake.

===Protected areas===
Much of the Sierra Nevada consists of federal lands and is either protected from development or strictly managed. The mountain range is home to three National ParksYosemite, Kings Canyon, and Sequoiaand two national monumentsDevils Postpile and Giant Sequoia. Ten national forests span much of the mountain range&#x27;s remaining area. Within these national parks, monuments, and forests lie 26 wilderness areas, which together protect 15.4% of the Sierra&#x27;s from logging and grazing.

The United States Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management currently control 52% of the land in the Sierra Nevada. Logging and grazing are generally allowed on land controlled by these agencies, under federal regulations that balance recreation and development on the land.

The California Bighorn Sheep Zoological Area near Mount Williamson in the southern Sierra was established to protect the endangered Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep. Starting in 1981, hikers were unable to enter the Area from May 15 through December 15, in order to protect the sheep. As of 2010, the restriction has been lifted and access to the Area is open for the whole year.

==Geologic history==

The earliest rocks in the Sierra Nevada are metamorphic roof pendants of Paleozoic age, the oldest being metasedimentary rocks from the Cambrian in the Mount Morrison region. These dark-colored hornfels, slates, marbles, and schists are found in the western foothills (notably around Coarsegold, west of the Tehachapi Pass) and east of the Sierra Crest. The earliest granite of the Sierra started to form in the Triassic period. This granite is mostly found east of the crest and north of 37.2°N. In the Triassic and into the Jurassic, an island arc collided with the west coast of North America and raised a chain of volcanoes, in an event called the Nevadan orogeny. Nearly all subaerial Sierran Arc volcanoes have since disappeared; their remains were redeposited during the Great Valley Sequence and the subsequent Cenozoic filling of the Great Valley, which is the source of much of the sedimentary rock in California.

In the Cretaceous, a subduction zone formed at the edge of the continent. This means that an oceanic plate started to dive beneath the North American Plate. Magma, formed through the subduction of the ancient Farallon Plate, rose in plumes (plutons) deep underground, their combined mass forming what is called the Sierra Nevada batholith. These plutons formed at various times, from 115 Ma to 87 Ma. The earlier plutons formed in the western half of the Sierra, while the later plutons formed in the eastern half of the Sierra. At this time, the Sierra Nevada formed the western ramp of a high plateau to the east, the Nevadaplano. During this period, rivers cut deep canyons into the range, generating topographic relief similar to the modern Sierra Nevada. This period of incision was halted approximately 30 million years ago by vast outpourings of pyroclastic flows from Nevada which filled the northern Sierran valleys with volcanic deposits. These pyroclastic flows, which continued for about 10 million years, were followed by andesitic lahars which nearly completely buried the northern Sierran landscape such that only the tallest peaks emerged above a volcanic plain. This second period of volcanism appears to have been triggered by crustal extension associated with extension of the Basin and Range Province. As this andesitic volcanism began waning about five million years ago, the rivers were able to begin eroding away the 100s of meters of volcanic deposits and resume the incision that had been halted by the first period of volcanism.

Some studies have argued that this recent incision is a sign of recent tectonic uplift. Other geologists claim that the elevations of many of the modern rivers flowing down the range are only lower than their ancient counterparts from 30–40 million years ago and the overall elevation and bedrock topography of the northern Sierra Nevada has changed little since at least 30–40 million years ago.

About 2.5 Ma, the Earth&#x27;s climate cooled, and ice ages started. Glaciers carved out characteristic U-shaped canyons throughout the Sierra. The combination of river and glacier erosion exposed the uppermost portions of the plutons emplaced millions of years before, leaving only a remnant of metamorphic rock on top of some Sierra peaks.

Extension of the Basin and Range continues today, leading to downdropping of crustal blocks just east of the Sierra Nevada during large earthquakes, such as the Lone Pine earthquake of 1872.

==Climate and meteorology==
The climate of the Sierra Nevada is influenced by the Mediterranean climate of California. During the fall, winter and spring, precipitation in the Sierra ranges from where it occurs mostly as snow above . Precipitation is highest on the central and northern portions of the western slope between elevation, due to orographic lift. Above , precipitation diminishes on the western slope up to the crest, since most of the precipitation has been wrung out at lower elevations. Most parts of the range east of the crest are in a rain shadow, and receive less than 25 inches of precipitation per year. While most summer days are dry, afternoon thunderstorms are common, particularly during the North American Monsoon in mid and late summer. Some of these summer thunderstorms drop over an inch of rain in a short period, and the lightning can start fires. Summer high temperatures average . Winters are comparatively mild, and the temperature is usually only just low enough to sustain a heavy snowpack. For example, Tuolumne Meadows, at elevation, has winter daily highs about with daily lows about . The growing season lasts 20 to 230 days, strongly dependent on elevation. The highest elevations of the Sierra have an alpine climate.

The Sierra Nevada snowpack is the major source of water and a significant source of electric power generation in California. Many reservoirs were constructed in the canyons of the Sierra throughout the 20th century, Several major aqueducts serving both agriculture and urban areas distribute Sierra water throughout the state. However, the Sierra casts a rain shadow, which greatly affects the climate and ecology of the central Great Basin. This rain shadow is largely responsible for Nevada being the driest state in the United States.

Precipitation varies substantially from year to year. It is not uncommon for some years to receive precipitation totals far above or below normal.

The height of the range and the steepness of the Sierra Escarpment, particularly at the southern end of the range, produces a wind phenomenon known as the &quot;Sierra Rotor&quot;. This is a horizontal rotation of the atmosphere just east of the crest of the Sierra, set in motion as an effect of strong westerly winds.
Because of the large number of airplanes that have crashed in the Sierra Nevada, primarily due to the complex weather and atmospheric conditions such as downdrafts and microbursts caused by geography there, a portion of the area, a triangle whose vertices are Reno, Nevada; Fresno, California; and Las Vegas, Nevada, has been dubbed the &quot;Nevada Triangle&quot;, in reference to the Bermuda Triangle. Some counts put the number of crashes in the triangle at 2,000, including millionaire and record-breaking flyer Steve Fossett. Hypotheses that the crashes are related in some way to the United States Air Force&#x27;s Area 51, or to the activities of extra-terrestrial aliens, have no evidence to support them.

==Ecology==

The Sierra Nevada is divided into a number of biotic zones, each of which is defined by its climate and supports a number of interdependent species. Life in the higher elevation zones adapted to colder weather, and to most of the precipitation falling as snow. The rain shadow of the Sierra causes the eastern slope to be warmer and drier: each life zone is higher in the east. A list of biotic zones, and corresponding elevations, is presented below:
* The western foothill zone, , with grassland, oak-grass savanna and chaparral-oak woodland. Gray pine (also known as Foothill pine) is intermixed with the oak woodland.
* The Pinyon pine-Juniper woodland, east side only.
* The Sierra Nevada lower montane forest (indicator species: Ponderosa pine, Jeffrey pine), west side, east side. This biotic zone is notable for containing giant sequoia.
* The Sierra Nevada upper montane forest (indicator species: Lodgepole pine, Red fir) west side, east side.
* The Sierra Nevada subalpine zone (indicator species: Whitebark pine) west side, east side
* The alpine region at greater than , and greater than east side.

==History==
===Native Americans===
Archaeological excavations placed Martis people of Paleo-Indians in northcentral Sierra Nevada during the period of 3,000 BCE to 500 CE. The earliest identified sustaining indigenous people in the Sierra Nevada were the Northern Paiute tribes on the east side, with the Mono tribe and Sierra Miwok tribe on the western side, and the Kawaiisu and Tübatulabal tribes in the southern Sierra. Today, some historic intertribal trade route trails over mountain passes are known artifact locations, such as Duck Pass with its obsidian arrowheads. The California and Sierra Native American tribes were predominantly peaceful, with occasional territorial disputes between the Paiute and Sierra Miwok tribes in the mountains. Washo and Maidu were also in this area prior to the era of European exploration and displacement.

===Initial European-American exploration===
American exploration of the mountain range started in 1827. Although prior to the 1820s there were Spanish missions, &quot;pueblos&quot; (towns), &quot;presidios&quot; (forts), and &quot;ranchos&quot; along the coast of California, no Spanish explorers visited the Sierra Nevada. The first Americans to visit the mountains were amongst a group led by fur trapper Jedediah Smith, crossing north of the Yosemite area in May 1827, at Ebbetts Pass.

In 1833, a subgroup of the Bonneville Expedition led by Joseph Reddeford Walker was sent westward to find an overland route to California. Eventually the party discovered a route along the Humboldt River across present-day Nevada, ascending the Sierra Nevada, starting near present-day Bridgeport and descending between the Tuolumne and Merced River drainage. The group may have been the first non-indigenous people to see Yosemite Valley. The Walker Party probably visited either the Tuolumne or Merced Groves of giant sequoia, becoming the first non-indigenous people to see the giant trees, but journals relating to the Walker party were destroyed in 1839, in a print shop fire in Philadelphia.

Starting in 1841, emigrants from the United States started to move to California via Sonora and Walker Passes.

In the winter of 1844, Lt. John C. Frémont, accompanied by Kit Carson, was the first European American to see Lake Tahoe. The Frémont party camped at .

===Gold rush===
The California Gold Rush began at Sutter&#x27;s Mill, near Coloma, in the western foothills of the Sierra. On January 24, 1848, James W. Marshall, a foreman working for Sacramento pioneer John Sutter, found shiny metal in the tailrace of a lumber mill Marshall was building for Sutter on the American River. Rumors soon started to spread and were confirmed in March 1848 by San Francisco newspaper publisher and merchant Samuel Brannan. Brannan strode through the streets of San Francisco, holding aloft a vial of gold, shouting &quot;Gold! Gold! Gold from the American River!&quot;

On August 19, 1848, the &quot;New York Herald&quot; was the first major newspaper on the East Coast to report the discovery of gold. On December 5, 1848, President James Polk confirmed the discovery of gold in an address to Congress. Soon, waves of immigrants from around the world, later called the &quot;forty-niners&quot;, invaded the Gold Country of California or &quot;Mother Lode&quot;. Miners lived in tents, wood shanties, or deck cabins removed from abandoned ships. Wherever gold was discovered, hundreds of miners would collaborate to put up a camp and stake their claims.

Because the gold in the California gravel beds was so richly concentrated, the early forty-niners simply panned for gold in California&#x27;s rivers and streams. However, panning cannot take place on a large scale, and miners and groups of miners graduated to more complex placer mining. Groups of prospectors would divert the water from an entire river into a sluice alongside the river, and then dig for gold in the newly exposed river bottom.

By 1853, most of the easily accessible gold had been collected, and attention turned to extracting gold from more difficult locations. Hydraulic mining was used on ancient gold-bearing gravel beds on hillsides and bluffs in the gold fields. In hydraulic mining, a high-pressure hose directed a powerful stream or jet of water at gold-bearing gravel beds. It is estimated that by the mid-1880s, 11 million troy ounces (340 metric tons) of gold (worth approximately US$16 billion in 2020 prices) had been recovered by &quot;hydraulicking&quot;. A consequence of these extraction methods was that large amounts of gravel, silt, heavy metals, and other pollutants were washed into streams and rivers. , many areas still bear the scars of hydraulic mining, since the resulting exposed earth and downstream gravel deposits do not support plant life.

It is estimated that by 1855, at least 300,000 gold-seekers, merchants, and other immigrants had arrived in California from around the world. The huge numbers of newcomers brought by the Gold Rush drove Native Americans out of their traditional hunting, fishing and food-gathering areas. To protect their homes and livelihood, some Native Americans responded by attacking the miners, provoking counter-attacks on native villages. The Native Americans, out-gunned, were often slaughtered.
===Thorough exploration===
The Gold Rush populated the western foothills of the Sierra Nevada, but even by 1860, most of the Sierra was unexplored. The state legislature authorized the California Geological Survey to officially explore the Sierra (and survey the rest of the state). Josiah Whitney was appointed to head the survey. Men of the survey, including William H. Brewer, Charles F. Hoffmann and Clarence King, explored the backcountry of what would become Yosemite National Park in 1863. In 1864, they explored the area around Kings Canyon. In 1869, John Muir started his wanderings in the Sierra Nevada range, and in 1871, King was the first to climb Mount Langley, mistakenly believing he had summited Mount Whitney, the highest peak in the range. In 1873, Mount Whitney was climbed for the first time by 3 men from Lone Pine, California, on a fishing trip. From 1892 to 1897 Theodore Solomons made the first attempt to map a route along the crest of the Sierra.

Other people finished exploring and mapping the Sierra. Bolton Coit Brown explored the Kings River watershed in 1895–1899. Joseph N. LeConte mapped the area around Yosemite National Park and what would become Kings Canyon National Park. James S. Hutchinson, a noted mountaineer, climbed the Palisades (1904) and Mount Humphreys (1905). By 1912, the USGS published a set of maps of the Sierra Nevada, and the era of exploration was over.

===Logging===
Logging in the Sierra Nevada has significantly impacted the landscape. The logging industry in the Sierra Nevada started in the early 1800s, when settlers relied on hand tools and ox-teams. Before the California Gold Rush, the industry was relatively small, and most of the lumber used in the state was imported. However, as the demand for lumber to support the mining industry increased, logging became a major industry in the region.

Initially, most of the lumber produced in California was used in mining. The Comstock Lode was a major center for logging, with operations supplying lumber for the construction of mine structures, such as tunnels, shafts, and buildings, as well as fuel for the mines. Dan DeQuille observed in 1876, &quot;the Comstock Lode may truthfully be said to be the tomb of the forests of the Sierra. Millions upon millions of feet of lumber are annually buried in the mines, nevermore to be resurrected.&quot;

In the late 1800s, the logging industry moved westward due to the depletion of white pine forests in the upper Midwest. This shift was encouraged by the positive portrayal of the Sierra Nevada as a promising timber region. In 1859, Horace Greely marveled, &quot;I never saw anything so much like good timber in the course of any seventy-five miles&#x27; travel as I saw in crossing the Sierra Nevada.&quot;
The logging industry experienced significant growth in the late 1800s due to several factors. The Timber and Stone Act of 1878 allowed individuals to claim ownership of old-growth timber tracts, which were later consolidated under joint-stock companies, such as those founded by Midwestern lumber magnates. These companies had the financial resources to transport timber from remote locations and build sawmills near the tracks of the Southern Pacific railroad which connected the San Joaquin Valley to the rest of the state in the 1870s. This facilitated the nationwide distribution of lumber. In addition, technological advancements, such as the shay locomotive and the v-shaped log flume, made it easier to transport lumber across mountainous terrain.

===Conservation===

The tourism potential of the Sierra Nevada was recognized early in the European history of the range. Yosemite Valley was first protected by the federal government in 1864. The Valley and Mariposa Grove were ceded to California in 1866 and turned into a state park. John Muir perceived overgrazing by sheep and logging of giant sequoia to be a problem in the Sierra. Muir successfully lobbied for the protection of the rest of Yosemite National Park: Congress created an Act to protect the park in 1890. The Valley and Mariposa Grove were added to the Park in 1906. In the same year, Sequoia National Park was formed to protect the Giant Sequoia: all logging of the Sequoia ceased at that time.

In 1903, the city of San Francisco proposed building a hydroelectric dam to flood Hetch Hetchy Valley. The city and the Sierra Club argued over the dam for 10 years, until the U.S. Congress passed the Raker Act in 1913 and allowed dam building to proceed. O&#x27;Shaughnessy Dam was completed in 1923.

Between 1912 and 1918, Congress debated three times to protect Lake Tahoe in a national park. None of these efforts succeeded, and after World War II, towns such as South Lake Tahoe grew around the shores of the lake. By 1980, the permanent population of the Lake Tahoe area grew to 50,000, while the summer population grew to 90,000. The development around Lake Tahoe affected the clarity of the lake water. In order to preserve the lake&#x27;s clarity, construction in the Tahoe basin is currently regulated by the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency.

As the 20th century progressed, more of the Sierra became available for recreation; other forms of economic activity decreased. The John Muir Trail, a trail that followed the Sierra crest from Yosemite Valley to Mount Whitney, was funded in 1915 and finished in 1938. Kings Canyon National Park was formed in 1940 to protect the deep canyon of the Kings River.

In the 1920s, automobile clubs and nearby towns started to lobby for trans-Sierra highways over Piute Pass (which would have closed the gap in SR 168) and other locations. However, by end of the 1920s, the Forest Service and the Sierra Club decided that roadless wilderness in the Sierra was valuable, and fought the proposal. The Piute Pass proposal faded out by the early 1930s, with the Forest Service proposing a route over Minaret Summit in 1933. The Minaret Summit route was lobbied against by California&#x27;s Governor Ronald Reagan in 1972. The expansion of the John Muir and Ansel Adams Wildernesses in the 1980s sealed off the Minaret Summit route.

A trans-Sierra route between Porterville and Lone Pine was proposed by local businessmen in 1923. Eventually, a circuitous route across the Sierra was built across Sherman Pass by 1976.

By 1964, the Wilderness Act protected portions of the Sierra as primitive areas where humans are simply temporary visitors. Gradually, 20 wilderness areas were established to protect scenic backcountry of the Sierra. These wilderness areas include the John Muir Wilderness (protecting the eastern slope of the Sierra and the area between Yosemite and Kings Canyon Parks), and wilderness within each of the National Parks.

The Sierra Nevada still faces a number of issues that threaten its conservation. Logging occurs on both private and public lands, including controversial clearcut methods and thinning logging on private and public lands. Grazing occurs on private lands as well as on National Forest lands, which include Wilderness areas. Overgrazing can alter hydrologic processes and vegetation composition, remove vegetation that serves as food and habitat for native species, and contribute to sedimentation and pollution in waterways. A recent increase in large wildfires like the Rim Fire in Yosemite National Park and the Stanislaus National Forest and the King Fire on the Eldorado National Forest, has prompted concerns. A 2015 study indicated that the increase in fire risk in California may be attributable to human-induced climate change. A study looking back over 8,000 years found that warmer climate periods experienced severe droughts and more stand-replacing fires and concluded that as climate is such a powerful influence on wildfires, trying to recreate presettlement forest structure may be difficult in a warmer future.

<text>In mathematics, differential calculus is a subfield of calculus that studies the rates at which quantities change. It is one of the two traditional divisions of calculus, the other being integral calculus—the study of the area beneath a curve.

The primary objects of study in differential calculus are the derivative of a function, related notions such as the differential, and their applications. The derivative of a function at a chosen input value describes the rate of change of the function near that input value. The process of finding a derivative is called differentiation. Geometrically, the derivative at a point is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point, provided that the derivative exists and is defined at that point. For a real-valued function of a single real variable, the derivative of a function at a point generally determines the best linear approximation to the function at that point.

Differential calculus and integral calculus are connected by the fundamental theorem of calculus. This states that differentiation is the reverse process to integration.

Differentiation has applications in nearly all quantitative disciplines. In physics, the derivative of the displacement of a moving body with respect to time is the velocity of the body, and the derivative of the velocity with respect to time is acceleration. The derivative of the momentum of a body with respect to time equals the force applied to the body; rearranging this derivative statement leads to the famous equation associated with Newton&#x27;s second law of motion. The reaction rate of a chemical reaction is a derivative. In operations research, derivatives determine the most efficient ways to transport materials and design factories.

Derivatives are frequently used to find the maxima and minima of a function. Equations involving derivatives are called differential equations and are fundamental in describing natural phenomena. Derivatives and their generalizations appear in many fields of mathematics, such as complex analysis, functional analysis, differential geometry, measure theory, and abstract algebra.

== Derivative ==

The derivative of formula_1 at the point formula_2 is the slope of the tangent to formula_3. In order to gain an intuition for this, one must first be familiar with finding the slope of a linear equation, written in the form formula_4. The slope of an equation is its steepness. It can be found by picking any two points and dividing the change in formula_5 by the change in formula_6, meaning that formula_7. For, the graph of formula_8 has a slope of formula_9, as shown in the diagram below:
:formula_10

For brevity, formula_11 is often written as formula_12, with formula_13 being the Greek letter delta, meaning &#x27;change in&#x27;. The slope of a linear equation is constant, meaning that the steepness is the same everywhere. However, many graphs such as formula_14 vary in their steepness. This means that you can no longer pick any two arbitrary points and compute the slope. Instead, the slope of the graph can be computed by considering the tangent line—a line that &#x27;just touches&#x27; a particular point. The slope of a curve at a particular point is equal to the slope of the tangent to that point. For example, formula_14 has a slope of formula_16 at formula_17 because the slope of the tangent line to that point is equal to formula_16:


The derivative of a function is then simply the slope of this tangent line. Even though the tangent line only touches a single point at the point of tangency, it can be approximated by a line that goes through two points. This is known as a secant line. If the two points that the secant line goes through are close together, then the secant line closely resembles the tangent line, and, as a result, its slope is also very similar:


The advantage of using a secant line is that its slope can be calculated directly. Consider the two points on the graph formula_19 and formula_20, where formula_21 is a small number. As before, the slope of the line passing through these two points can be calculated with the formula formula_22. This gives

:formula_23

As formula_21 gets closer and closer to formula_25, the slope of the secant line gets closer and closer to the slope of the tangent line. This is formally written as

:formula_26

The above expression means &#x27;as formula_21 gets closer and closer to 0, the slope of the secant line gets closer and closer to a certain value&#x27;. The value that is being approached is the derivative of formula_1; this can be written as formula_29. If formula_30, the derivative can also be written as formula_31, with formula_32 representing an infinitesimal change. For example, formula_33 represents an infinitesimal change in x. In summary, if formula_30, then the derivative of formula_1 is

:formula_36

provided such a limit exists. We have thus succeeded in properly defining the derivative of a function, meaning that the &#x27;slope of the tangent line&#x27; now has a precise mathematical meaning. Differentiating a function using the above definition is known as differentiation from first principles. Here is a proof, using differentiation from first principles, that the derivative of formula_14 is formula_38:

:formula_39

As formula_21 approaches formula_25, formula_42 approaches formula_38. Therefore, formula_44. This proof can be generalised to show that formula_45 if formula_46 and formula_47 are constants. This is known as the power rule. For example, formula_48. However, many other functions cannot be differentiated as easily as polynomial functions, meaning that sometimes further techniques are needed to find the derivative of a function. These techniques include the chain rule, product rule, and quotient rule. Other functions cannot be differentiated at all, giving rise to the concept of differentiability.

A closely related concept to the derivative of a function is its differential. When and are real variables, the derivative of at is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of at . Because the source and target of are one-dimensional, the derivative of is a real number. If and are vectors, then the best linear approximation to the graph of depends on how changes in several directions at once. Taking the best linear approximation in a single direction determines a partial derivative, which is usually denoted . The linearization of in all directions at once is called the total derivative.

==History of differentiation==
The concept of a derivative in the sense of a tangent line is a very old one, familiar to ancient Greek mathematicians such as Euclid (c. 300 BC), Archimedes (c. 287–212 BC), and Apollonius of Perga (c. 262–190 BC). Archimedes also made use of indivisibles, although these were primarily used to study areas and volumes rather than derivatives and tangents (see &quot;The Method of Mechanical Theorems&quot;). 
The use of infinitesimals to compute rates of change was developed significantly by Bhāskara II (1114–1185); indeed, it has been argued that many of the key notions of differential calculus can be found in his work, such as &quot;Rolle&#x27;s theorem&quot;.

The mathematician, Sharaf al-Dīn al-Tūsī (1135–1213), in his &quot;Treatise on Equations&quot;, established conditions for some cubic equations to have solutions, by finding the maxima of appropriate cubic polynomials. He obtained, for example, that the maximum (for positive ) of the cubic occurs when , and concluded therefrom that the equation has exactly one positive solution when , and two positive solutions whenever . The historian of science, Roshdi Rashed, has argued that al-Tūsī must have used the derivative of the cubic to obtain this result. Rashed&#x27;s conclusion has been contested by other scholars, however, who argue that he could have obtained the result by other methods which do not require the derivative of the function to be known.

The modern development of calculus is usually credited to Isaac Newton (1643–1727) and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716), who provided independent and unified approaches to differentiation and derivatives. The key insight, however, that earned them this credit, was the fundamental theorem of calculus relating differentiation and integration: this rendered obsolete most previous methods for computing areas and volumes. For their ideas on derivatives, both Newton and Leibniz built on significant earlier work by mathematicians such as Pierre de Fermat (1607-1665), Isaac Barrow (1630–1677), René Descartes (1596–1650), Christiaan Huygens (1629–1695), Blaise Pascal (1623–1662) and John Wallis (1616–1703). Regarding Fermat&#x27;s influence, Newton once wrote in a letter that &quot;I had the hint of this method [of fluxions] from Fermat&#x27;s way of drawing tangents, and by applying it to abstract equations, directly and invertedly, I made it general.&quot; Isaac Barrow is generally given credit for the early development of the derivative. Nevertheless, Newton and Leibniz remain key figures in the history of differentiation, not least because Newton was the first to apply differentiation to theoretical physics, while Leibniz systematically developed much of the notation still used today.

Since the 17th century many mathematicians have contributed to the theory of differentiation. In the 19th century, calculus was put on a much more rigorous footing by mathematicians such as Augustin Louis Cauchy (1789–1857), Bernhard Riemann (1826–1866), and Karl Weierstrass (1815–1897). It was also during this period that the differentiation was generalized to Euclidean space and the complex plane.

The 20th century brought two major steps towards our present understanding and practice of derivation : Lebesgue integration, besides extending integral calculus to many more functions, clarified the relation between derivation and integration with the notion of absolute continuity. Later the theory of distributions (after Laurent Schwartz) extended derivation to generalized functions (e.g., the Dirac delta function previously introduced in Quantum Mechanics) and became fundamental to nowadays applied analysis especially by the use of weak solutions to partial differential equations.

== Applications of derivatives ==

=== Optimization ===
If is a differentiable function on (or an open interval) and is a local maximum or a local minimum of , then the derivative of at is zero. Points where are called &quot;critical points&quot; or &quot;stationary points&quot; (and the value of at is called a critical value). If is not assumed to be everywhere differentiable, then points at which it fails to be differentiable are also designated critical points.

If is twice differentiable, then conversely, a critical point of can be analysed by considering the second derivative of at :
* if it is positive, is a local minimum;
* if it is negative, is a local maximum;
* if it is zero, then could be a local minimum, a local maximum, or neither. (For example, has a critical point at , but it has neither a maximum nor a minimum there, whereas has a critical point at and a minimum and a maximum, respectively, there.)
This is called the second derivative test. An alternative approach, called the first derivative test, involves considering the sign of the on each side of the critical point.

Taking derivatives and solving for critical points is therefore often a simple way to find local minima or maxima, which can be useful in optimization. By the extreme value theorem, a continuous function on a closed interval must attain its minimum and maximum values at least once. If the function is differentiable, the minima and maxima can only occur at critical points or endpoints.

This also has applications in graph sketching: once the local minima and maxima of a differentiable function have been found, a rough plot of the graph can be obtained from the observation that it will be either increasing or decreasing between critical points.

In higher dimensions, a critical point of a scalar valued function is a point at which the gradient is zero. The second derivative test can still be used to analyse critical points by considering the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix of second partial derivatives of the function at the critical point. If all of the eigenvalues are positive, then the point is a local minimum; if all are negative, it is a local maximum. If there are some positive and some negative eigenvalues, then the critical point is called a &quot;saddle point&quot;, and if none of these cases hold (i.e., some of the eigenvalues are zero) then the test is considered to be inconclusive.

==== Calculus of variations ====
One example of an optimization problem is: Find the shortest curve between two points on a surface, assuming that the curve must also lie on the surface. If the surface is a plane, then the shortest curve is a line. But if the surface is, for example, egg-shaped, then the shortest path is not immediately clear. These paths are called geodesics, and one of the most fundamental problems in the calculus of variations is finding geodesics. Another example is: Find the smallest area surface filling in a closed curve in space. This surface is called a minimal surface and it, too, can be found using the calculus of variations.

=== Physics ===
Calculus is of vital importance in physics: many physical processes are described by equations involving derivatives, called differential equations. Physics is particularly concerned with the way quantities change and develop over time, and the concept of the &quot;time derivative&quot; — the rate of change over time — is essential for the precise definition of several important concepts. In particular, the time derivatives of an object&#x27;s position are significant in Newtonian physics:

* velocity is the derivative (with respect to time) of an object&#x27;s displacement (distance from the original position)
* acceleration is the derivative (with respect to time) of an object&#x27;s velocity, that is, the second derivative (with respect to time) of an object&#x27;s position.

For example, if an object&#x27;s position on a line is given by

: formula_49

then the object&#x27;s velocity is

: formula_50

and the object&#x27;s acceleration is

: formula_51

which is constant.

=== Differential equations ===
A differential equation is a relation between a collection of functions and their derivatives. An ordinary differential equation is a differential equation that relates functions of one variable to their derivatives with respect to that variable. A partial differential equation is a differential equation that relates functions of more than one variable to their partial derivatives. Differential equations arise naturally in the physical sciences, in mathematical modelling, and within mathematics itself. For example, Newton&#x27;s second law, which describes the relationship between acceleration and force, can be stated as the ordinary differential equation
:formula_52
The heat equation in one space variable, which describes how heat diffuses through a straight rod, is the partial differential equation
:formula_53
Here is the temperature of the rod at position and time and is a constant that depends on how fast heat diffuses through the rod.

=== Mean value theorem ===

The mean value theorem gives a relationship between values of the derivative and values of the original function. If is a real-valued function and and are numbers with , then the mean value theorem says that under mild hypotheses, the slope between the two points and is equal to the slope of the tangent line to at some point between and . In other words,
:formula_54
In practice, what the mean value theorem does is control a function in terms of its derivative. For instance, suppose that has derivative equal to zero at each point. This means that its tangent line is horizontal at every point, so the function should also be horizontal. The mean value theorem proves that this must be true: The slope between any two points on the graph of must equal the slope of one of the tangent lines of . All of those slopes are zero, so any line from one point on the graph to another point will also have slope zero. But that says that the function does not move up or down, so it must be a horizontal line. More complicated conditions on the derivative lead to less precise but still highly useful information about the original function.

=== Taylor polynomials and Taylor series ===
The derivative gives the best possible linear approximation of a function at a given point, but this can be very different from the original function. One way of improving the approximation is to take a quadratic approximation. That is to say, the linearization of a real-valued function at the point is a linear polynomial , and it may be possible to get a better approximation by considering a quadratic polynomial . Still better might be a cubic polynomial , and this idea can be extended to arbitrarily high degree polynomials. For each one of these polynomials, there should be a best possible choice of coefficients , , , and that makes the approximation as good as possible.

In the neighbourhood of , for the best possible choice is always , and for the best possible choice is always . For , , and higher-degree coefficients, these coefficients are determined by higher derivatives of . should always be , and should always be . Using these coefficients gives the Taylor polynomial of . The Taylor polynomial of degree is the polynomial of degree which best approximates , and its coefficients can be found by a generalization of the above formulas. Taylor&#x27;s theorem gives a precise bound on how good the approximation is. If is a polynomial of degree less than or equal to , then the Taylor polynomial of degree equals .

The limit of the Taylor polynomials is an infinite series called the Taylor series. The Taylor series is frequently a very good approximation to the original function. Functions which are equal to their Taylor series are called analytic functions. It is impossible for functions with discontinuities or sharp corners to be analytic; moreover, there exist smooth functions which are also not analytic.

=== Implicit function theorem ===
Some natural geometric shapes, such as circles, cannot be drawn as the graph of a function. For instance, if , then the circle is the set of all pairs such that . This set is called the zero set of , and is not the same as the graph of , which is a paraboloid. The implicit function theorem converts relations such as into functions. It states that if is continuously differentiable, then around most points, the zero set of looks like graphs of functions pasted together. The points where this is not true are determined by a condition on the derivative of . The circle, for instance, can be pasted together from the graphs of the two functions . In a neighborhood of every point on the circle except and , one of these two functions has a graph that looks like the circle. (These two functions also happen to meet and , but this is not guaranteed by the implicit function theorem.)

The implicit function theorem is closely related to the inverse function theorem, which states when a function looks like graphs of invertible functions pasted together.

<doc id="50420" wikidata="Q104358" url="?curid=50420" title="Billie Holiday">
<text>Billie Holiday (born Eleanora Fagan; April 7, 1915 – July 17, 1959) was an American jazz and swing music singer. Nicknamed &quot;Lady Day&quot; by her friend and music partner, Lester Young, Holiday made a significant contribution to jazz music and pop singing. Her vocal style, strongly influenced by jazz instrumentalists, inspired a new way of manipulating phrasing and tempo. She was known for her vocal delivery and improvisational skills.

After a turbulent childhood, Holiday began singing in nightclubs in Harlem where she was heard by producer John Hammond, who liked her voice. She signed a recording contract with Brunswick in 1935. Her collaboration with Teddy Wilson produced the hit &quot;What a Little Moonlight Can Do&quot;, which became a jazz standard. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Holiday had mainstream success on labels such as Columbia and Decca. By the late 1940s, however, she was beset with legal troubles and drug abuse. After a short prison sentence, she performed a sold-out concert at Carnegie Hall.
She was a successful concert performer throughout the 1950s, with two further sold-out shows at Carnegie Hall. Because of personal struggles and an altered voice, her final recordings were met with mixed reaction, but were mild commercial successes. Her final album, &quot;Lady in Satin&quot;, was released in 1958. Holiday died of heart failure on July 17, 1959, at age 44.

Holiday won four Grammy Awards, all of them posthumously, for Best Historical Album. She was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and the National Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame. In 2000, she was also inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame as an early influence; their website states that &quot;Billie Holiday changed jazz forever&quot;. She was named one of the 50 Great Voices by NPR and was ranked fourth on the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of &quot;200 Greatest Singers of All Time&quot; (2023). Several films about her life have been released, most recently &quot;The United States vs. Billie Holiday&quot; (2021).

==Life and career==
===1915–1929: Childhood===
Eleanora Fagan was born on April 7, 1915, in Philadelphia to African American unwed teenage couple Clarence Halliday and Sarah Julia &quot;Sadie&quot; Fagan (née Harris). Her mother moved to Philadelphia at age 19, after she was evicted from her parents&#x27; home in the Sandtown-Winchester neighborhood of Baltimore, Maryland, for becoming pregnant. With no support from her parents, she made arrangements with her older, married half-sister, Eva Miller, for Holiday to stay with her in Baltimore. Not long after Holiday was born, her father abandoned his family to pursue a career as a jazz banjo player and guitarist. Some historians have disputed Holiday&#x27;s paternity, as a copy of her birth certificate in the Baltimore archives lists her father as &quot;Frank DeViese&quot;. Other historians consider this an anomaly, probably inserted by a hospital or government worker. DeViese lived in Philadelphia, and Sadie, then known by her maiden name Harris, may have met him through her work. Harris married Philip Gough in 1920, but the marriage only lasted a few years.
Holiday grew up in Baltimore and had a very difficult childhood. Her mother often took what were then known as &quot;transportation jobs&quot;, serving on passenger railroads. Holiday was raised largely by Eva Miller&#x27;s mother-in-law, Martha Miller, and suffered from her mother&#x27;s absences and being in others&#x27; care for her first decade of life. Holiday&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Lady Sings the Blues&quot;, published in 1956, is inconsistent regarding details of her early life, but much was confirmed by Stuart Nicholson in his 1995 biography of the singer.

Holiday frequently skipped school which resulted in her being brought before the juvenile court at age nine. She was sent to the House of the Good Shepherd, a Catholic reform school for girls, where the nuns locked her in a room with a dead girl overnight as punishment for misbehavior. The experience traumatized her, and for years she would &quot;dream about it and wake up hollering and screaming&quot;. After nine months, she was released on October 3, 1925, to her mother. Sadie had opened a restaurant, the East Side Grill, and mother and daughter worked long hours there. She dropped out of school at age 11.

On December 24, 1926, Harris came home to discover a neighbor attempting to rape Holiday. She successfully fought back, and he was arrested. Officials sent Holiday to the House of the Good Shepherd under protective custody as a state witness in the rape case. Holiday was released in February 1927, when she was nearly 12. She found a job running errands in a brothel, and she scrubbed marble steps as well as kitchen and bathroom floors of neighborhood homes. Around this time, she first heard the records of Louis Armstrong and Bessie Smith. In particular, Holiday cited &quot;West End Blues&quot; as an intriguing influence, pointing specifically to the scat section duet with the clarinet as her favorite part. By the end of 1928, Holiday&#x27;s mother moved to Harlem, New York, again leaving Holiday with Martha Miller. By early 1929, Holiday had joined her mother in Harlem.

===1929–1935: Early career===
As a young teenager, Holiday started singing in nightclubs in Harlem. She took her professional pseudonym from Billie Dove, an actress she admired, and Clarence Halliday, her father. At the outset of her career, she spelled her last name &quot;Halliday&quot;, her father&#x27;s birth surname, but eventually changed it to &quot;Holiday&quot;, his performing name. The young singer teamed up with a neighbor, tenor saxophone player Kenneth Hollan. They were a team from 1929 to 1931, performing at clubs such as the Grey Dawn, Pod&#x27;s and Jerry&#x27;s on 133rd Street, and the Brooklyn Elks Club. Benny Goodman recalled hearing Holiday in 1931 at the Bright Spot. As her reputation grew, she played in many clubs, including the Mexico&#x27;s and the Alhambra Bar and Grill, where she met Charles Linton, a vocalist who later worked with Chick Webb. It was also during this period that she connected with her father, who was playing in Fletcher Henderson&#x27;s band.

Late in 1932, 17-year-old Holiday replaced the singer Monette Moore at Covan&#x27;s, a club on West 132nd Street. Producer John Hammond, who loved Moore&#x27;s singing and had come to hear her, first heard Holiday there in early 1933. Hammond arranged for Holiday to make her recording debut at age 18, in November 1933, with Benny Goodman. She recorded two songs: &quot;Your Mother&#x27;s Son-In-Law&quot; and &quot;Riffin&#x27; the Scotch&quot;, the latter being her first hit. &quot;Son-in-Law&quot; sold 300 copies, and &quot;Riffin&#x27; the Scotch&quot;, released on November 11, sold 5,000 copies. Hammond was impressed by Holiday&#x27;s singing style and said of her, &quot;Her singing almost changed my music tastes and my musical life, because she was the first girl singer I&#x27;d come across who actually sang like an improvising jazz genius.&quot; Hammond compared Holiday favorably to Armstrong and said she had a good sense of lyric content at a young age.

In 1935, Holiday had a small role as a woman abused by her lover in Duke Ellington&#x27;s musical short film &quot;Symphony in Black: A Rhapsody of Negro Life&quot;. She sang &quot;Saddest Tale&quot; in her scene.

===1935–1938: Recordings with Teddy Wilson===
In 1935, Holiday was signed to Brunswick by John Hammond to record pop tunes with pianist Teddy Wilson in the swing style for the growing jukebox trade. They were allowed to improvise on the material. Holiday&#x27;s improvisation of melody to fit the emotion was highly skillful. Their first collaboration included &quot;What a Little Moonlight Can Do&quot; and &quot;Miss Brown to You&quot;. &quot;What a Little Moonlight Can Do&quot; has been deemed her &quot;claim to fame&quot;. Brunswick did not favor the recording session because producers wanted Holiday to sound more like Cleo Brown. However, after &quot;What a Little Moonlight Can Do&quot; was successful, the company began considering Holiday an artist in her own right. She began recording under her own name a year later for Vocalion in sessions produced by Hammond and Bernie Hanighen. Hammond said the Wilson-Holiday records from 1935 to 1938 were a great asset to Brunswick. According to Hammond, Brunswick was broke and unable to record many jazz tunes. Wilson, Holiday, Young, and other musicians came into the studio without written arrangements, reducing the recording cost. Brunswick paid Holiday a flat fee rather than royalties, which saved the company money. &quot;I Cried for You&quot; sold 15,000 copies, which Hammond called &quot;a giant hit for Brunswick... Most records that made money sold around three to four thousand.&quot;

Another frequent accompanist was tenor saxophonist Lester Young, who had been a boarder at her mother&#x27;s house in 1934 and with whom Holiday had a rapport. Young said, &quot;I think you can hear that on some of the old records, you know. Some time I&#x27;d sit down and listen to &#x27;em myself, and it sound like two of the same voices ... or the same mind, or something like that.&quot; Young nicknamed her &quot;Lady Day&quot;, and she called him &quot;Prez&quot;.

===1937–1938: Working for Count Basie and Artie Shaw===
In late 1937, Holiday had a brief stint as a big-band vocalist with Count Basie. The traveling conditions of the band were often poor; they performed many one-nighters in clubs, moving from city to city with little stability. Holiday chose the songs she sang and had a hand in the arrangements, choosing to portray her developing persona of a woman unlucky in love. Her tunes included &quot;I Must Have That Man&quot;, &quot;Travelin&#x27; All Alone&quot;, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Get Started&quot;, and &quot;Summertime&quot;, a hit for Holiday in 1936, originating in George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; the year before. Basie became used to Holiday&#x27;s heavy involvement in the band. He said, &quot;When she rehearsed with the band, it was really just a matter of getting her tunes like she wanted them, because she knew how she wanted to sound and you couldn&#x27;t tell her what to do.&quot; Some of the songs Holiday performed with Basie were recorded. &quot;I Can&#x27;t Get Started&quot;, &quot;They Can&#x27;t Take That Away from Me&quot;, and &quot;Swing It Brother Swing&quot; are all commercially available. Holiday was unable to record in the studio with Basie, but she included many of his musicians in her recording sessions with Teddy Wilson.

Holiday found herself in direct competition with the popular singer Ella Fitzgerald. The two later became friends. Fitzgerald was the vocalist for the Chick Webb Band, which was in competition with the Basie band. On January 16, 1938, the same day that Benny Goodman performed his legendary Carnegie Hall jazz concert, the Basie and Webb bands had a battle at the Savoy Ballroom. Webb and Fitzgerald were declared winners by &quot;Metronome&quot; magazine, while &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazine pronounced Holiday and Basie the winners. Fitzgerald won a straw poll of the audience by a three-to-one margin.

By February 1938, Holiday was no longer singing for Basie. Various reasons have been given for why she was fired. Jimmy Rushing, Basie&#x27;s male vocalist, called her unprofessional. According to All Music Guide, Holiday was fired for being &quot;temperamental and unreliable&quot;. She complained of low pay and poor working conditions and may have refused to sing the songs requested of her or change her style. Holiday was hired by Artie Shaw a month after being fired from the Count Basie Band. This association placed her among the first black women to work with a white orchestra, an unusual arrangement at that time. This was also the first time a black female singer employed full-time toured the segregated U.S. South with a white bandleader. When Holiday faced racism, Shaw would often stick up for his vocalist. In her autobiography, Holiday describes an incident in which she was not permitted to sit on the bandstand with other vocalists because of racist policies. Shaw said to her, &quot;I want you on the band stand like Helen Forrest, Tony Pastor and everyone else.&quot; When touring the South, Holiday would sometimes be heckled by members of the audience. In Louisville, Kentucky, a man called her a &quot;nigger wench&quot; and requested she sing another song. Holiday lost her temper and had to be escorted off the stage.

By March 1938, Shaw and Holiday had been broadcast on New York City&#x27;s powerful radio station WABC (the original WABC, now WCBS). Because of their success, they were given an extra time slot to broadcast in April, which increased their exposure. The &quot;New York Amsterdam News&quot; reviewed the broadcasts and reported an improvement in Holiday&#x27;s performance. &quot;Metronome&quot; reported that the addition of Holiday to Shaw&#x27;s band put it in the &quot;top brackets&quot;. Holiday could not sing as often during Shaw&#x27;s shows as she could in Basie&#x27;s; the repertoire was more instrumental, with fewer vocals. Shaw was also pressured to hire a white singer, Nita Bradley, with whom Holiday did not get along but had to share a bandstand. In May 1938, Shaw won band battles against Tommy Dorsey and Red Norvo, with the audience favoring Holiday. Although Shaw admired Holiday&#x27;s singing in his band, saying she had a &quot;remarkable ear&quot; and a &quot;remarkable sense of time&quot;, her tenure with the band was nearing an end. In November 1938, Holiday was asked to use the service elevator at the Lincoln Hotel in New York City, instead of the one used by hotel guests, because white patrons of the hotels complained. This may have been the last straw for her. She left the band shortly after. Holiday spoke about the incident weeks later, saying, &quot;I was never allowed to visit the bar or the dining room as did other members of the band ... [and] I was made to leave and enter through the kitchen.&quot; There are no surviving live recordings of Holiday with Shaw&#x27;s band. Because she was under contract to a different record label and possibly because of her race, Holiday was able to make only one record with Shaw, &quot;Any Old Time&quot;. However, Shaw played clarinet on four songs she recorded in New York on July 10, 1936: &quot;Did I Remember?&quot;, &quot;No Regrets&quot;, &quot;Summertime&quot; and &quot;Billie&#x27;s Blues&quot;.

By the late 1930s, Holiday had toured with Count Basie and Artie Shaw, scored a string of radio and retail hits with Teddy Wilson, and became an established artist in the recording industry. Her songs &quot;What a Little Moonlight Can Do&quot; and &quot;Easy Living&quot; were imitated by singers across America and were quickly becoming jazz standards. In September 1938, Holiday&#x27;s single &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Lock My Heart&quot; ranked sixth as the most-played song that month. Her record label, Vocalion, listed the single as its fourth-best seller for the same month, and it peaked at number 2 on the pop charts, according to Joel Whitburn&#x27;s &quot;Pop Memories: 1890–1954&quot;.

===1939: &quot;Strange Fruit&quot; and Commodore Records===
Holiday was in the middle of recording for Columbia in the late 1930s when she was introduced to &quot;Strange Fruit&quot;, a song by Abel Meeropol based on his poem about lynching. Meeropol, a Jewish schoolteacher from the Bronx, used the pseudonym &quot;Lewis Allan&quot; for the poem, which was set to music and performed at teachers&#x27; union meetings. It was eventually heard by Barney Josephson, the proprietor of Café Society, an integrated nightclub in Greenwich Village, who introduced it to Holiday. She performed it at the club in 1939, with some trepidation, fearing possible retaliation. She later said that the imagery of the song reminded her of her father&#x27;s death and that this played a role in her resistance to performing it.

For her performance of &quot;Strange Fruit&quot; at the Café Society, she had waiters silence the crowd when the song began. During the song&#x27;s long introduction, the lights dimmed and all movement had to cease. As Holiday began singing, only a small spotlight illuminated her face. On the final note, all lights went out, and when they came back on, Holiday was gone. Holiday said her father, Clarence Holiday, was denied medical treatment for a fatal lung disorder because of racial prejudice, and that singing &quot;Strange Fruit&quot; reminded her of the incident. &quot;It reminds me of how Pop died, but I have to keep singing it, not only because people ask for it, but because twenty years after Pop died the things that killed him are still happening in the South&quot;, she wrote in her autobiography. When Holiday&#x27;s producers at Columbia found the subject matter too sensitive, Milt Gabler agreed to record it for his Commodore Records label on April 20, 1939. &quot;Strange Fruit&quot; remained in her repertoire for 20 years. She recorded it again for Verve. The Commodore release did not get any airplay, but the controversial song sold well, though Gabler attributed that mostly to the record&#x27;s other side, &quot;Fine and Mellow&quot;, which was a jukebox hit. &quot;The version I recorded for Commodore&quot;, Holiday said of &quot;Strange Fruit&quot;, &quot;became my biggest-selling record&quot;. &quot;Strange Fruit&quot; was the equivalent of a top-twenty hit in the 1930s.

Holiday&#x27;s popularity increased after &quot;Strange Fruit&quot;. She received a mention in &quot;Time&quot; magazine. &quot;I open Café Society as an unknown&quot;, Holiday said. &quot;I left two years later as a star. I needed the prestige and publicity all right, but you can&#x27;t pay rent with it.&quot; She soon demanded a raise from her manager, Joe Glaser. Holiday returned to Commodore in 1944, recording songs she made with Teddy Wilson in the 1930s, including &quot;I Cover the Waterfront&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Get By&quot;, and &quot;He&#x27;s Funny That Way&quot;. She also recorded new songs that were popular at the time, including, &quot;My Old Flame&quot;, &quot;How Am I to Know?&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Yours&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Seeing You&quot;, a number one hit for Bing Crosby. She also recorded her version of &quot;Embraceable You&quot;, which was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2005.

===1940–1947: Commercial success===
Holiday&#x27;s mother Sadie, nicknamed &quot;The Duchess&quot;, opened a restaurant called Mom Holiday&#x27;s. She used money from her daughter while playing dice with members of the Count Basie band, with whom she toured in the late 1930s. &quot;It kept Mom busy and happy and stopped her from worrying and watching over me&quot;, Holiday said. Fagan began borrowing large amounts from Holiday to support the restaurant. Holiday obliged but soon fell on hard times herself. &quot;I needed some money one night and I knew Mom was sure to have some&quot;, she said. &quot;So I walked in the restaurant like a stockholder and asked. Mom turned me down flat. She wouldn&#x27;t give me a cent.&quot; The two argued, and Holiday shouted angrily, &quot;God bless the child that&#x27;s got his own&quot;, and stormed out. With Arthur Herzog Jr., a pianist, she wrote a song based on the lyric, &quot;God Bless the Child&quot;, and added music. &quot;God Bless the Child&quot; became Holiday&#x27;s most popular and most covered record. It reached number 25 on the charts in 1941 and was third in &quot;Billboard&quot; songs of the year, selling over a million records. In 1976, the song was added to the Grammy Hall of Fame. Herzog claimed Holiday contributed only a few lines to the lyrics. He said she came up with the line &quot;God bless the child&quot; from a dinner conversation the two had had.

On June 12, 1942, in Los Angeles, Holiday recorded &quot;Trav&#x27;lin Light&quot; with Paul Whiteman for a new label, Capitol Records. Because she was under contract to Columbia, she used the pseudonym &quot;Lady Day&quot;. The song reached number 23 on the pop charts and number one on the R&amp;B charts, then called the Harlem Hit Parade. On October 11, 1943, &quot;Life&quot; magazine wrote, &quot;She has the most distinctive style of any popular vocalist, [and] is imitated by other vocalists.&quot;

Milt Gabler, in addition to owning Commodore Records, became an A&amp;R man for Decca Records. He signed Holiday to Decca on August 7, 1944, when she was 29. Her first Decca recording was &quot;Lover Man&quot; (number 16 Pop, number 5 R&amp;B), one of her biggest hits. The success and distribution of the song made Holiday a staple in the pop community, leading to solo concerts, rare for jazz singers in the late 1940s. Gabler said, &quot;I made Billie a real pop singer. That was right in her. Billie loved those songs.&quot; Jimmy Davis and Roger &quot;Ram&quot; Ramirez, the song&#x27;s writers, had tried to interest Holiday in the song. In 1943, a flamboyant male torch singer, Willie Dukes, began singing &quot;Lover Man&quot; on 52nd Street. Because of his success, Holiday added it to her shows. The record&#x27;s flip side was &quot;No More&quot;, one of her favorites. Holiday asked Gabler for strings on the recording. Such arrangements were associated with Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald. &quot;I went on my knees to him&quot;, Holiday said. &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to do it with the ordinary six pieces. I begged Milt and told him I had to have strings behind me.&quot; On October 4, 1944, Holiday entered the studio to record &quot;Lover Man&quot;, saw the string ensemble and walked out. The musical director, Toots Camarata, said Holiday was overwhelmed with joy. She may also have wanted strings to avoid comparisons between her commercially successful early work with Teddy Wilson and everything produced afterwards. Her 1930s recordings with Wilson used a small jazz combo; recordings for Decca often involved strings. A month later, in November, Holiday returned to Decca to record &quot;That Ole Devil Called Love&quot;, &quot;Big Stuff&quot;, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Explain&quot;. She wrote &quot;Don&#x27;t Explain&quot; after she caught her husband, Jimmy Monroe, with lipstick on his collar.

Holiday did not make any more records until August 1945, when she recorded &quot;Don&#x27;t Explain&quot; for a second time, changing the lyrics &quot;I know you raise Cain&quot; to &quot;Just say you&#x27;ll remain&quot; and changing &quot;You mixed with some dame&quot; to &quot;What is there to gain?&quot; Other songs recorded were &quot;Big Stuff&quot;, &quot;What Is This Thing Called Love?&quot;, and &quot;You Better Go Now&quot;. Ella Fitzgerald named &quot;You Better Go Now&quot; her favorite recording of Holiday&#x27;s. &quot;Big Stuff&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Explain&quot; were recorded again but with additional strings and a viola. In 1946, Holiday recorded &quot;Good Morning Heartache&quot;. Although the song failed to chart, she sang it in live performances; three live recordings are known.
In September 1946, Holiday began her only major film, &quot;New Orleans&quot;, in which she starred opposite Louis Armstrong and Woody Herman. Plagued by racism and McCarthyism, producer Jules Levey and script writer Herbert Biberman were pressed to lessen Holiday&#x27;s and Armstrong&#x27;s roles to avoid the impression that black people created jazz. The attempts failed because in 1947 Biberman was listed as one of the Hollywood Ten and sent to jail. Several scenes were deleted from the film. &quot;They had taken miles of footage of music and scenes&quot;, Holiday said, but &quot;none of it was left in the picture. And very damn little of me. I know I wore a white dress for a number I did... and that was cut out of the picture.&quot; She recorded &quot;The Blues Are Brewin&#x27;&quot; for the film&#x27;s soundtrack. Other songs included in the movie are &quot;Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans?&quot; and &quot;Farewell to Storyville&quot;. Holiday&#x27;s drug addictions were a problem on the set. She earned more than one thousand dollars per week from club ventures but spent most of it on heroin. Her lover, Joe Guy, traveled to Hollywood while Holiday was filming and supplied her with drugs. Guy was banned from the set when he was found there by Holiday&#x27;s manager, Joe Glaser.

By the late 1940s, Holiday had begun recording a number of slow, sentimental ballads. &quot;Metronome&quot; expressed its concerns in 1946 about &quot;Good Morning Heartache&quot;, saying, &quot;there&#x27;s a danger that Billie&#x27;s present formula will wear thin, but up to now it&#x27;s wearing well.&quot; The &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; reported of a concert in 1946 that her performance had little variation in melody and no change in tempo.

===1947–1952: Legal issues and Carnegie Hall concert===
By 1947, Holiday was at her commercial peak, having made $250,000 in the three previous years. She was ranked second in the &quot;DownBeat&quot; poll for 1946 and 1947, her highest ranking in that poll. She was ranked fifth in &quot;Billboard&quot;″s annual college poll of &quot;girl singers&quot; on July 6, 1947 (Jo Stafford was first). In 1946, Holiday won the &quot;Metronome&quot; magazine popularity poll.

On May 16, 1947, Holiday was arrested for possession of narcotics in her New York apartment. On May 27, she was in court. &quot;It was called &#x27;The United States of America versus Billie Holiday&#x27;. And that&#x27;s just the way it felt&quot;, she recalled. During the trial, she heard that her lawyer would not come to the trial to represent her. &quot;In plain English, that meant no one in the world was interested in looking out for me,&quot; she said. Dehydrated and unable to hold down food, she pleaded guilty and asked to be sent to the hospital. The district attorney spoke in her defense, saying, &quot;If your honor please, this is a case of a drug addict, but more serious, however, than most of our cases, Miss Holiday is a professional entertainer and among the higher rank as far as income was concerned.&quot; She was sentenced to Alderson Federal Prison Camp in West Virginia. The drug possession conviction caused her to lose her New York City Cabaret Card, preventing her working anywhere that sold alcohol; thereafter, she performed in concert venues and theaters.

Holiday was released early (on March 16, 1948) because of good behavior. When she arrived at Newark, her pianist Bobby Tucker and her dog Mister were waiting. The dog leaped at Holiday, knocking off her hat, and tackling her to the ground. &quot;He began lapping me and loving me like crazy&quot;, she said. A woman thought the dog was attacking Holiday. She screamed, a crowd gathered, and reporters arrived. &quot;I might just as well have wheeled into Penn Station and had a quiet little get-together with the Associated Press, United Press, and International News Service&quot;, she said.

Ed Fishman (who fought with Joe Glaser to be Holiday&#x27;s manager) thought of a comeback concert at Carnegie Hall. Holiday hesitated, unsure audiences would accept her after the arrest. She gave in and agreed to appear. On March 27, 1948, Holiday played Carnegie Hall to a sold-out crowd. Two thousand seven hundred tickets were sold in advance, a record at the time for the venue. Her popularity was unusual because she did not have a current hit record. Her last record to reach the charts was &quot;Lover Man&quot; in 1945. Holiday sang 32 songs at the Carnegie concert by her count, including Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot;Night and Day&quot; and her 1930s hit, &quot;Strange Fruit&quot;. During the show, someone sent her a box of gardenias. &quot;My old trademark&quot;, Holiday said. &quot;I took them out of box and fastened them smack to the side of my head without even looking twice.&quot; There was a hatpin in the gardenias and Holiday unknowingly stuck it into the side of her head. &quot;I didn&#x27;t feel anything until the blood started rushing down in my eyes and ears&quot;, she said. After the third curtain call, she passed out.

On April 27, 1948, Bob Sylvester and her promoter Al Wilde arranged a Broadway show for her. Titled &quot;Holiday on Broadway&quot;, it sold out. &quot;The regular music critics and drama critics came and treated us like we were legit&quot;, she said. But it closed after three weeks.

Holiday was arrested again on January 22, 1949, in her room at the Hotel Mark Twain in San Francisco by George Hunter White. Holiday said she began using hard drugs in the early 1940s. She married trombonist Jimmy Monroe on August 25, 1941. While still married, she became involved with trumpeter Joe Guy, her drug dealer. She divorced Monroe in 1947 and also split with Guy.

In October 1949, Holiday recorded &quot;Crazy He Calls Me&quot;, which was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2010. Gabler said the hit was her most successful recording for Decca after &quot;Lover Man&quot;. The charts of the 1940s did not list songs outside the top 30, making it impossible to recognize minor hits. By the late 1940s, despite her popularity and concert power, her singles were little played on radio, perhaps because of her reputation.

In 1948, Holiday played at the Ebony Club, which was against the law. Her manager, John Levy, was convinced he could get her card back and allowed her to open without one. &quot;I opened scared&quot;, Holiday said, &quot;[I was] expecting the cops to come in any chorus and carry me off. But nothing happened. I was a huge success.&quot;

Holiday recorded Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;I Loves You, Porgy&quot; in 1948. In 1950, Holiday appeared in the Universal short film &quot;Sugar Chile Robinson, Billie Holiday, Count Basie and His Sextet&quot;, singing &quot;God Bless the Child&quot; and &quot;Now, Baby or Never&quot;.

The loss of her cabaret card reduced Holiday&#x27;s earnings. She had not received proper record royalties until she joined Decca, so her main revenue was club concerts. The problem worsened when Holiday&#x27;s records went out of print in the 1950s. She seldom received royalties in her later years. In 1958, she received a royalty of only $11. Her lawyer in the late 1950s, Earle Warren Zaidins, registered with BMI only two songs she had written or co-written, costing her revenue.

===1952–1959: &quot;Lady Sings the Blues&quot;===
By the 1950s, Holiday&#x27;s drug use, drinking, and relationships with abusive men caused her health to deteriorate. She appeared on the ABC reality series &quot;The Comeback Story&quot; to discuss attempts to overcome her poor choices.

Holiday first toured Europe in 1954 as part of a Leonard Feather package. The Swedish impresario Nils Hellstrom initiated the &quot;Jazz Club U.S.A.&quot; (after the Leonard Feather radio show) tour starting in Stockholm in January 1954 and then Germany, Netherlands, Paris and Switzerland. The tour party was Holiday, Buddy DeFranco, Red Norvo, Carl Drinkard, Elaine Leighton (de) (nl) (1926–2012), Sonny Clark, Beryl Booker, Jimmy Raney and Red Mitchell. A recording of a live set in Germany was released as &quot;Lady Love – Billie Holiday&quot;.

Holiday&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Lady Sings the Blues&quot;, was ghostwritten by William Dufty and published in 1956. Dufty, a &quot;New York Post&quot; writer and editor then married to Holiday&#x27;s close friend Maely Dufty, wrote the book quickly from a series of conversations with the singer in the Duftys&#x27; 93rd Street apartment. He also drew on the work of earlier interviewers and intended to let Holiday tell her story in her own way. In his 2015 study, &quot;Billie Holiday: The Musician and the Myth&quot;, John Szwed argued that &quot;Lady Sings the Blues&quot; is a generally accurate account of her life, but that co-writer Dufty was forced to water down or suppress material by the threat of legal action. According to the reviewer Richard Brody, &quot;Szwed traces the stories of two important relationships that are missing from the book—with Charles Laughton, in the 1930s, and with Tallulah Bankhead, in the late 1940s—and of one relationship that&#x27;s sharply diminished in the book, her affair with Orson Welles around the time of &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;. The film version of the book was released in 1972, with Diana Ross playing the role of Holiday.

To accompany her autobiography, Holiday released the LP &quot;Lady Sings the Blues&quot; in June 1956. The album featured four new tracks, &quot;Lady Sings the Blues&quot;, &quot;Too Marvelous for Words&quot;, &quot;Willow Weep for Me&quot;, and &quot;I Thought About You&quot;, and eight new recordings of her biggest hits to date. The re-recordings included &quot;Trav&#x27;lin&#x27; Light&quot; &quot;Strange Fruit&quot; and &quot;God Bless the Child&quot;. A review of the album was published by &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine on December 22, 1956, calling it a worthy musical complement to her autobiography. &quot;Holiday is in good voice now&quot;, wrote the reviewer, &quot;and these new readings will be much appreciated by her following&quot;. &quot;Strange Fruit&quot; and &quot;God Bless the Child&quot; were called classics, and &quot;Good Morning Heartache&quot;, another reissued track on the LP, was also noted favorably.

On November 10, 1956, Holiday performed two concerts before packed audiences at Carnegie Hall. Live recordings of the second Carnegie Hall concert were released on a Verve/HMV album in the UK in late 1961 called &quot;The Essential Billie Holiday&quot;. The 13 tracks included on this album featured her own songs &quot;I Love My Man&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Explain&quot; and &quot;Fine and Mellow&quot;, together with other songs closely associated with her, including &quot;Body and Soul&quot;, &quot;My Man&quot;, and &quot;Lady Sings the Blues&quot; (her lyrics accompanied a tune by pianist Herbie Nichols). The liner notes for this album were written partly by Gilbert Millstein of the &quot;New York Times&quot;, who, according to these notes, served as narrator of the Carnegie Hall concerts. Interspersed among Holiday&#x27;s songs, Millstein read aloud four lengthy passages from her autobiography, &quot;Lady Sings the Blues&quot;. He later wrote:

The critic Nat Hentoff of &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazine, who attended the Carnegie Hall concert, wrote the remainder of the sleeve notes on the 1961 album. He wrote of Holiday&#x27;s performance:

Her performance of &quot;Fine and Mellow&quot; on CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Sound of Jazz&quot; program is memorable for her interplay with her long-time friend Lester Young. Both were less than two years from death. Young died in March 1959. Holiday wanted to sing at his funeral, but her request was denied. Also in 1957, she sang as a headliner with Dinah Washington and others in &quot;Jazz Under the Stars&quot;, a summer concert series that took place at the Wollman Memorial Theater in New York City&#x27;s Central Park.

When Holiday returned to Europe almost five years later, in 1959, she made one of her last television appearances for Granada television&#x27;s British Cabaret show, &quot;Chelsea at Nine,&quot; in London. The show taped what is believed to be the only existing filmed version of Holiday singing &quot;Strange Fruit&quot;. Her final studio recordings were made for MGM Records in 1959, with lush backing from Ray Ellis and his Orchestra, who had also accompanied her on the Columbia album &quot;Lady in Satin&quot; the previous year (see below). The MGM sessions were released posthumously on a self-titled album, later retitled and re-released as &quot;Last Recording&quot;.

On March 28, 1957, Holiday married Louis McKay, a mob enforcer. McKay, like most of the men in her life, was abusive. They were separated at the time of her death, but McKay had plans to start a chain of Billie Holiday vocal studios, on the model of the Arthur Murray dance schools. Holiday was childless, but she had two godchildren: singer Billie Lorraine Feather (the daughter of Leonard Feather) and Bevan Dufty (the son of William Dufty).

==Illness and death==
By early 1959, Holiday was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver. Although she had initially stopped drinking on her doctor&#x27;s orders, it was not long before she relapsed. By May 1959, she had lost . Her manager, Joe Glaser, jazz critic Leonard Feather, photojournalist Allan Morrison, and the singer&#x27;s own friends all tried in vain to persuade her to go to a hospital. On May 31, 1959, Holiday was finally taken to Metropolitan Hospital in New York for treatment of both liver and heart disease. While in the hospital, narcotics police came to her hospital room and placed her under house arrest for narcotics possession. On July 15, she received last rites. Holiday died at age 44 at 3:10 am on July 17, 1959, of pulmonary edema and heart failure caused by cirrhosis of the liver.

In her final years, Holiday had been progressively swindled out of her earnings by McKay and she died with US$0.70 in the bank ($7.40 in 2023). The story of her burial plot and how it was managed by her estranged husband was documented on NPR in 2012. Her funeral was held on July 21, 1959, at the Church of St. Paul the Apostle in Manhattan. She was buried at Saint Raymond&#x27;s Cemetery in the Bronx. Michael P. Grace ll, a songwriter and theater producer based in Manhattan, paid for the funeral.

Gilbert Millstein of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, who was the announcer at Holiday&#x27;s 1956 Carnegie Hall concerts and wrote parts of the sleeve notes for the album &quot;The Essential Billie Holiday&quot;, described her death in these sleeve notes, dated 1961:

When Holiday died, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published a short obituary on page 15 without a byline. She left an estate of $1,000 ($10,577 in 2023), and her best recordings from the 1930s were mostly out of print.

Holiday&#x27;s public stature grew in the following years. In 1961, she was voted to the Down Beat Hall Of Fame, and soon after Columbia reissued nearly one hundred of her early records. In 1972, Diana Ross&#x27;s portrayal of Holiday in &quot;Lady Sings the Blues&quot; was nominated for an Oscar and won a Golden Globe. Holiday was posthumously nominated for 23 Grammy awards.

Singer Adelaide Hall made a secret visit to Holiday&#x27;s bedside at the Metropolitan Hospital, on or around June 12, 1959. Hall&#x27;s spoken account of her visit was captured on tape by the journalist Max Jones in 1988. Hall&#x27;s long-time friend, Iain Cameron Williams, and author of Hall&#x27;s biography, also had direct knowledge of the visit. However, he refrained from releasing the information as he only had Hall&#x27;s one-to-one spoken account and no further backup. In July 2022, after finding transcripts of Max Jones&#x27;s tape, Williams wrote an article for &quot;The Syncopated Times&quot; about Hall&#x27;s secret visit.
George Jacobs claims Sinatra also visited Holiday on her death bed, and promised to supply her with the heroin she desperately wanted.

==Artistry==

Holiday&#x27;s vocal delivery made her performances instantly recognizable throughout her career. Her improvisational prowess compensated for her lack of formal musical education. Holiday stated that she had always wanted her voice to sound like an instrument, and some of her influences included trumpeter Louis Armstrong and singer Bessie Smith. Early in her career, she was said to have had her accompanying instrumentalists stop and repeat an improvised line if she believed she could use it for a vocal line.

Holiday&#x27;s last major recording, a 1958 album titled &quot;Lady in Satin&quot;, features the backing of a 40-piece orchestra conducted and arranged by Ray Ellis. The conductor said of the album in 1997:

Frank Sinatra was influenced during his youth by Holiday&#x27;s performances on 52nd Street. He told &quot;Ebony&quot; magazine in 1958 about her impact:

==Legacy==
In the book &quot;The NPR Curious Listener&#x27;s Guide to Jazz&quot;, jazz historian Loren Schoenberg asserted that &quot;no one would dispute that Billie Holiday is the definitive Jazz Singer.&quot;

Billie Holiday received several &quot;Esquire&quot; Magazine awards during her lifetime. Her posthumous awards also include being inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, Ertegun Jazz Hall of Fame, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and the ASCAP Jazz Wall of Fame. In 1985, a statue of Billie Holiday was erected in Baltimore; the statue was completed in 1993 with additional panels of images inspired by her seminal song &quot;Strange Fruit&quot;. The Billie Holiday Monument is located at Pennsylvania and West Lafayette avenues in Baltimore&#x27;s Upton neighborhood. Holiday is also featured in a Romare Bearden mosaic at the Upton metro station. In 2019, Chirlane McCray announced that New York City would build a statue honoring Holiday near Queens Borough Hall.

Frank O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s poem from 1959, &quot;The Day Lady Died&quot;&#x27;, concludes with an impression of Holiday performing at the Five Spot Café at the end of her career, and the impact of that performance on her listeners.
The song &quot;Angel of Harlem&quot; by Irish rock band U2, released as a single in December 1988, was written as a homage to Holiday.

==Films and plays about Holiday==
The biographical film &quot;Lady Sings the Blues&quot;, loosely based on Holiday&#x27;s autobiography, was released in 1972 and was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Actress for Diana Ross. Another film, &quot;The United States vs. Billie Holiday&quot;, starred Andra Day and was released in 2021. It is based on the book &quot;Chasing the Scream&quot; by Johann Hari. Director Lee Daniels saw how Holiday was portrayed in the 1972 biopic, and wanted to show her legacy as &quot;a civil rights leader not just a drug addict or a jazz singer&quot;. The film also depicts Holiday&#x27;s bisexuality and relationship with Tallulah Bankhead. Day was also nominated for Best Actress but did not win. However, she won a Golden Globe in 2021.

Holiday is the primary character in the play &quot;Lady Day at Emerson&#x27;s Bar and Grill&quot;, with music by Lanie Robertson. It takes place in South Philadelphia in March 1959. It premiered in 1986 at the Alliance Theatre and has been revived several times. A Broadway production starring Audra McDonald was filmed and broadcast on HBO in 2016; McDonald received an Emmy Award nomination. In 2014, she received a Tony Award win. &quot;Billie&quot; is a 2019 documentary film based on interviews in the 1970s by Linda Lipnack Kuehl, who was researching a book on Holiday that was never completed.

Holiday was portrayed by actress Paula Jai Parker in &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot; episode &quot;God Bless the Child&quot;.

==Discography==
Billie Holiday recorded extensively for four labels: Columbia Records, which issued her recordings on its subsidiary labels Brunswick Records, Vocalion Records and OKeh Records, from 1933 through 1942; Commodore Records in 1939 and 1944; Decca Records from 1944 through 1950; briefly for Aladdin Records in 1951; Verve Records and on its earlier imprint Clef Records from 1952 through 1957, then again for Columbia Records from 1957 to 1958 and finally for MGM Records in 1959. Many of Holiday&#x27;s recordings appeared on 78-rpm records prior to the long-playing vinyl record era, and only Clef, Verve, and Columbia issued albums during her lifetime that were not compilations of previously released material. Many compilations have been issued since her death, as well as comprehensive box sets and live recordings.

===Hit records===
In 1986, Joel Whitburn&#x27;s company Record Research compiled information on the popularity of recordings released from the era predating rock and roll and created pop charts dating back to the beginning of the commercial recording industry. The company&#x27;s findings were published in the book &quot;Pop Memories 1890–1954&quot;. Several of Holiday&#x27;s records are listed on the pop charts Whitburn created.

Holiday began her recording career on a high note with her first major release, &quot;Riffin&#x27; the Scotch&quot;, of which 5,000 copies were sold. It was released under the name &quot;Benny Goodman &amp; His Orchestra&quot; in 1933.

Most of Holiday&#x27;s early successes were released under the name &quot;Teddy Wilson &amp; His Orchestra&quot;. During her stay in Wilson&#x27;s band, Holiday would sing a few bars and then other musicians would have a solo. Wilson, one of the most influential jazz pianists of the swing era, accompanied Holiday more than any other musician. He and Holiday issued 95 recordings together.

In July 1936, Holiday began releasing sides under her own name. These songs were released under the band name &quot;Billie Holiday &amp; Her Orchestra&quot;. Most noteworthy, the popular jazz standard &quot;Summertime&quot; sold well and was listed on the pop charts of the time at number 12, the first time the jazz standard charted. Only Billy Stewart&#x27;s R&amp;B version of &quot;Summertime&quot; reached a higher chart placement than Holiday&#x27;s, charting at number 10 thirty years later in 1966.

Holiday had 16 best-selling songs in 1937, making the year her most commercially successful. It was in this year that Holiday scored her sole number one hit as a featured vocalist on the available pop charts of the 1930s, &quot;Carelessly&quot;. The hit &quot;I&#x27;ve Got My Love to Keep Me Warm&quot;, was also recorded by Ray Noble, Glen Gray and Fred Astaire, whose rendering was a bestseller for weeks. Holiday&#x27;s version ranked 6 on the year-end single chart available for 1937.

In 1939, Holiday recorded her biggest selling record, &quot;Strange Fruit&quot; for Commodore, charting at number 16 on the available pop chart for the 1930s.

In 1940, &quot;Billboard&quot; began publishing its modern pop charts, which included the Best Selling Retail Records chart, the precursor to the Hot 100. None of Holiday&#x27;s songs placed on the modern pop charts, partly because &quot;Billboard&quot; only published the first ten slots of the charts in some issues. Minor hits and independent releases had no way of being spotlighted.

&quot;God Bless the Child&quot;, which went on to sell over a million copies, ranked number 3 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s year-end top songs of 1941.

On October 24, 1942, &quot;Billboard&quot; began issuing its R&amp;B charts. Two of Holiday&#x27;s songs placed on the chart, &quot;Trav&#x27;lin&#x27; Light&quot; with Paul Whiteman, which topped the chart, and &quot;Lover Man&quot;, which reached number 5. &quot;Trav&#x27;lin&#x27; Light&quot; also reached 18 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s year-end chart.

<text>Bernardo Bertolucci ( ; ; 16 March 1941 – 26 November 2018) was an Italian film director and screenwriter with a career that spanned 50 years. Considered one of the greatest directors in the history of cinema, Bertolucci&#x27;s work achieved international acclaim. With &quot;The Last Emperor&quot; (1987) he became the first Italian filmmaker to win the Academy Award for Best Director, and he received many other accolades including a BAFTA Award, a César Award, two Golden Globes, a Golden Lion in 2007, and an Honorary Palme d&#x27;Or at Cannes in 2011.

A protégé of Pier Paolo Pasolini, Bertolucci made his directorial debut at 22. His second film, &quot;Before the Revolution&quot; (1964), earned strong international reviews and has since gained classic status, being called a &quot;masterpiece of Italian cinema&quot; by Film4. His 1970 film &quot;The Conformist&quot;, an adaptation of the Alberto Moravia novel, is considered a classic of international cinema, and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay and the prestigious Berlin Golden Bear. His 1972 erotic drama &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot; was controversial due to its rape scene and comments made by actress Maria Schneider about her treatment on set. Bertolucci&#x27;s later films such as the historical epic &quot;1900&quot; (1976), the family drama &quot;La Luna&quot; (1979), and the darkly comedic &quot;Tragedy of a Ridiculous Man&quot; (1981), were also controversial but acclaimed.

His 1987 film &quot;The Last Emperor&quot;, a biopic of Chinese monarch Puyi, was a critical and commercial success, earning rave reviews and sweeping the 60th Academy Awards (including Best Picture and Best Director). He followed its success with two more films in his &quot;Oriental Trilogy&quot; – &quot;The Sheltering Sky&quot;, an adaptation of the novel of the same name, and &quot;Little Buddha&quot;, a Buddhist religious epic. His 1996 film, &quot;Stealing Beauty&quot;, brought him his second of two Palme d&#x27;Or nominations. He continued directing well into the 21st century, releasing his final film, &quot;Me and You&quot;, in 2012.

Bertolucci&#x27;s films often deal with themes of politics, sexuality, history, class conflict and social taboos, and his style has influenced several filmmakers. Several of his films have appeared on lists of the greatest films of all time.

== Early life ==
Bertolucci was born in the Italian city of Parma, in the region of Emilia-Romagna. He was the elder son of Ninetta (Giovanardi), a teacher, and Attilio Bertolucci, who was a poet, a reputed art historian, anthologist and film critic. His mother was born in Australia, to an Italian father and an Australian mother (of Irish and Scottish descent).

Having been raised in an artistic environment, Bertolucci began writing at the age of 15, and soon after received several prestigious literary prizes, including the &quot;Premio Viareggio&quot; for his first book. His father&#x27;s background helped his career: the elder Bertolucci had helped the Italian filmmaker Pier Paolo Pasolini publish his first novel, and Pasolini reciprocated by hiring Bertolucci as his first assistant in Rome on &quot;Accattone&quot; (1961).

Bertolucci had one brother, the theatre director and playwright Giuseppe (27 February 1947 – 16 June 2012). His cousin was the film producer Giovanni Bertolucci (24 June 1940 – 17 February 2005), with whom he worked on a number of films.

== Career ==
=== Directorial breakthrough ===
Bertolucci initially wished to become a poet like his father. With this goal in mind, he attended the Faculty of Modern Literature of the University of Rome from 1958 to 1961, where his film career as an assistant director to Pasolini began. Shortly after, Bertolucci left the university without graduating. In 1962, at the age of 22, he directed his first feature film, produced by Tonino Cervi with a screenplay by Pasolini, called &quot;La commare secca&quot; (1962). The film is a murder mystery, following a prostitute&#x27;s homicide. Bertolucci uses flashbacks to piece together the crime and the person who committed it. The film which shortly followed was his acclaimed &quot;Before the Revolution&quot; (&quot;Prima della rivoluzione&quot;, 1964).

The boom of Italian cinema, which gave Bertolucci his start, slowed in the 1970s as directors were forced to co-produce their films with several of the American, Swedish, French, and German companies and actors due to the effects of the global economic recession on the Italian film industry.

Bertolucci caused controversy in 1972 with the film &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot;, starring Marlon Brando, Maria Schneider, Jean-Pierre Léaud and Massimo Girotti. The film presents Brando&#x27;s character, Paul, as he copes with his wife&#x27;s suicide by emotionally and physically dominating a young woman, Jeanne (Schneider). The depictions of Schneider, then 19 years old, have been criticized as exploitive. In one scene, Paul anally rapes Jeanne using butter as a lubricant. The use of butter was not in the script; Bertolucci and Brando had discussed it, but they did not tell Schneider. She said in 2007 that she had cried &quot;real tears&quot; during the scene and had felt humiliated and &quot;a little raped&quot;. In 2013 Bertolucci said that he had withheld the information from Schneider to generate a real &quot;reaction of frustration and rage&quot;. Brando alleged that Bertolucci had wanted the characters to have real sex, but Brando and Schneider both said it was simulated. In 2016 Bertolucci released a statement where he clarified that Schneider had known of the violence to be depicted in the scene, but had not been told about the use of butter.

Following the “media glare” and her fame after the film&#x27;s release, Schneider became a drug addict and suicidal. Criminal proceedings were brought against Bertolucci in Italy for obscenity; the film was sequestered by the censorship commission and all copies were ordered destroyed. An Italian court revoked Bertolucci&#x27;s civil rights for five years and gave him a four-month suspended prison sentence. In 1978 the Appeals Court of Bologna ordered three copies of the film to be preserved in the national film library with the stipulation that they could not be viewed, until Bertolucci was later able to re-submit it for general distribution with no cuts.
Bertolucci increased his fame with his next few films, from &quot;1900&quot; (1976), an epic depiction of the struggles of farmers in Emilia-Romagna from the beginning of the 20th century up to World War II with an international cast (Robert De Niro, Gérard Depardieu, Donald Sutherland, Sterling Hayden, Burt Lancaster, Dominique Sanda) to &quot;La Luna&quot;, set in Rome and in Emilia-Romagna, in which Bertolucci deals with the thorny issue of drugs and incest, and finally &quot;La tragedia di un uomo ridicolo&quot; (1981), with Ugo Tognazzi.

He then wrote two screenplays based on Dashiell Hammett&#x27;s Red Harvest. He hoped this would be his first film set in America, but nothing came of it.

=== &quot;The Last Emperor&quot; and later career ===

In 1987, Bertolucci directed the epic &quot;The Last Emperor&quot;, a biographical film telling the life story of Aisin-Gioro Puyi, the last emperor of China. The film was independently produced by British producer Jeremy Thomas, with whom Bertolucci worked almost exclusively from then on. The film was independently financed and three years in the making. Bertolucci, who co-wrote the film with Mark Peploe, won the Academy Award for Best Director. The film uses Puyi&#x27;s life as a mirror that reflects China&#x27;s passage from feudalism through revolution to its current state.

At the 60th Academy Awards, &quot;The Last Emperor&quot; won all nine Oscars for which it was nominated: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Costume Design, Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Music, Original Score and Best Sound.

&quot;The Last Emperor&quot; was the first feature film ever authorized by the government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China to film in the Forbidden City. Bertolucci had proposed the film to the Chinese government as one of two possible projects. The other film was &quot;La Condition Humaine&quot; by André Malraux. The Chinese government preferred &quot;The Last Emperor&quot;.

After &quot;The Last Emperor&quot;, &quot;The Sheltering Sky&quot; and &quot;Little Buddha&quot;, Bertolucci returned to Italy to film, and to revisit his old themes but with varying results from both critics and the public. He filmed &quot;Stealing Beauty&quot; in 1996, then &quot;The Dreamers&quot; in 2003, which describes the political passions and sexual revolutions of two siblings in Paris in 1968.

In 2007, Bertolucci received the Golden Lion Award at the Venice Film Festival for his life&#x27;s work, and in 2011 he also received the Palme d&#x27;Or at the Cannes Film Festival.

In 2012, his final film, &quot;Me and You&quot;, was screened out of competition at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival and was released early in 2013 in the UK. The film is an adaptation of Niccolò Ammaniti&#x27;s young adult book &quot;Me and You&quot;. The screenplay for the movie was written by Bertolucci, Umberto Contarello and Niccolò Ammaniti. Bertolucci originally intended to shoot the film in 3D but was forced to abandon this plan due to cost.

Bertolucci appeared on the Radio Four programme &quot;Start the Week&quot; on 22 April 2013, and on &quot;Front Row&quot; on 29 April 2013, where he chose &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot;, a film directed by Federico Fellini, for the &quot;Cultural Exchange&quot;.

In the spring of 2018, in an interview with the Italian edition of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, Bertolucci announced that he was preparing a new film. He stated, &quot;The theme will be love, let&#x27;s call it that. In reality, the theme is communication and therefore also incommunicability. The favorite subject of Michelangelo Antonioni and the condition I found myself facing when I moved on from my films for the few, those of the sixties, to a broader cinema ready to meet a large audience.&quot;

=== As a screenwriter, producer and actor ===
Bertolucci wrote many screenplays, both for his own films and for films directed by others, two of which he also produced.

He was an actor in the film &quot;Golem: The Spirit of Exile&quot;, directed by Amos Gitai in 1992.

== Politics and personal beliefs ==
Bertolucci was an atheist, though he was fascinated by Buddhism.

Bertolucci&#x27;s films are often very political. He was a professed Marxist and, like Luchino Visconti, who similarly employed many foreign artists during the late 1960s, Bertolucci used his films to express his political views. His political films were preceded by others re-evaluating history. &quot;The Conformist&quot; (1970) criticised fascism, touched upon the relationship between nationhood and nationalism, as well as issues of popular taste and collective memory, all amid an international plot by Benito Mussolini to assassinate a politically active leftist professor of philosophy in Paris. &quot;1900&quot; also analyses the struggle of Left and Right.

On 27 September 2009, Bertolucci was one of the signatories of the appeal to the Swiss government to release Roman Polanski, who was being held awaiting extradition to the United States.

On Twitter on 24 April 2015, Bertolucci participated in #whomademyclothes, Fashion Revolution&#x27;s anti-sweatshop campaign commemorating the 2013 Savar building collapse, the deadliest accident in the history of the garment industry.

Bertolucci advocated the practice of Transcendental Meditation: &quot;We want to evoke the present and it is difficult to do it all together, we can only meditate, as in transcendental meditation. One of the most powerful experiences. Either you meditate or watch a good movie, then the two things start to touch ... &quot;.

== Death ==
Bertolucci died of lung cancer in Rome on 26 November 2018, at the age of 77.

<text>The quantum Hall effect (or integer quantum Hall effect) is a quantized version of the Hall effect which is observed in two-dimensional electron systems subjected to low temperatures and strong magnetic fields, in which the Hall resistance exhibits steps that take on the quantized values
: formula_1
where is the Hall voltage, is the channel current, is the elementary charge and is the Planck constant. The divisor can take on either integer () or fractional () values. Here, is roughly but not exactly equal to the filling factor of Landau levels. The quantum Hall effect is referred to as the integer or fractional quantum Hall effect depending on whether is an integer or fraction, respectively.

The striking feature of the integer quantum Hall effect is the persistence of the quantization (i.e. the Hall plateau) as the electron density is varied. Since the electron density remains constant when the Fermi level is in a clean spectral gap, this situation corresponds to one where the Fermi level is an energy with a finite density of states, though these states are localized (see Anderson localization).

The fractional quantum Hall effect is more complicated and still considered an open research problem. Its existence relies fundamentally on electron–electron interactions. In 1988, it was proposed that there was a quantum Hall effect without Landau levels. This quantum Hall effect is referred to as the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect. There is also a new concept of the quantum spin Hall effect which is an analogue of the quantum Hall effect, where spin currents flow instead of charge currents.

== Applications ==
=== Electrical resistance standards ===
The quantization of the Hall conductance (formula_2) has the important property of being exceedingly precise. Actual measurements of the Hall conductance have been found to be integer or fractional multiples of to better than one part in a billion. It has allowed for the definition of a new practical standard for electrical resistance, based on the resistance quantum given by the von Klitzing constant . This is named after Klaus von Klitzing, the discoverer of exact quantization. The quantum Hall effect also provides an extremely precise independent determination of the fine-structure constant, a quantity of fundamental importance in quantum electrodynamics.

In 1990, a fixed conventional value was defined for use in resistance calibrations worldwide. Later, the 2019 revision of the SI fixed exact values of and , resulting in an exact 

== Research status ==
The fractional quantum Hall effect is considered part of &quot;exact quantization&quot;. Exact quantization in full generality is not completely understood but it has been explained as a very subtle manifestation of the combination of the principle of gauge invariance together with another symmetry (see Anomalies). The integer quantum Hall effect instead is considered a solved research problem and understood in the scope of TKNN formula and Chern–Simons Lagrangians.

The fractional quantum Hall effect is still considered an open research problem. The fractional quantum Hall effect can be also understood as an integer quantum Hall effect, although not of electrons but of charge–flux composites known as composite fermions. Other models to explain the fractional quantum Hall effect also exists.
Currently it is considered an open research problem because no single, confirmed and agreed list of fractional quantum numbers exists, neither a single agreed model to explain all of them, although there are such claims in the scope of composite fermions and Non Abelian Chern–Simons Lagrangians.

== History ==
In 1957, Carl Frosch and Lincoln Derick were able to manufacture the first silicon dioxide field effect transistors at Bell Labs, the first transistors in which drain and source were adjacent at the surface. Subsequently, a team demonstrated a working MOSFET at Bell Labs 1960. This enabled physicists to study electron behavior in a nearly ideal two-dimensional gas. 

In a MOSFET, conduction electrons travel in a thin surface layer, and a &quot;gate&quot; voltage controls the number of charge carriers in this layer. This allows researchers to explore quantum effects by operating high-purity MOSFETs at liquid helium temperatures.

The integer quantization of the Hall conductance was originally predicted by University of Tokyo researchers Tsuneya Ando, Yukio Matsumoto and Yasutada Uemura in 1975, on the basis of an approximate calculation which they themselves did not believe to be true. In 1978, the Gakushuin University researchers Jun-ichi Wakabayashi and Shinji Kawaji subsequently observed the effect in experiments carried out on the inversion layer of MOSFETs.

In 1980, Klaus von Klitzing, working at the high magnetic field laboratory in Grenoble with silicon-based MOSFET samples developed by Michael Pepper and Gerhard Dorda, made the unexpected discovery that the Hall resistance was &quot;exactly&quot; quantized. For this finding, von Klitzing was awarded the 1985 Nobel Prize in Physics. A link between exact quantization and gauge invariance was subsequently proposed by Robert Laughlin, who connected the quantized conductivity to the quantized charge transport in a Thouless charge pump. Most integer quantum Hall experiments are now performed on gallium arsenide heterostructures, although many other semiconductor materials can be used. In 2007, the integer quantum Hall effect was reported in graphene at temperatures as high as room temperature, and in the magnesium zinc oxide ZnO–Mg&quot;x&quot;Zn1−&quot;x&quot;O.

== Integer quantum Hall effect ==
=== Landau levels ===

In two dimensions, when classical electrons are subjected to a magnetic field they follow circular cyclotron orbits. When the system is treated quantum mechanically, these orbits are quantized. To determine the values of the energy levels the Schrödinger equation must be solved.

Since the system is subjected to a magnetic field, it has to be introduced as an electromagnetic vector potential in the Schrödinger equation. The system considered is an electron gas that is free to move in the x and y directions, but is tightly confined in the z direction. Then, a magnetic field is applied in the z direction and according to the Landau gauge the electromagnetic vector potential is formula_3 and the scalar potential is formula_4. Thus the Schrödinger equation for a particle of charge formula_5 and effective mass formula_6 in this system is:
: formula_7
where formula_8 is the canonical momentum, which is replaced by the operator formula_9 and formula_10 is the total energy.

To solve this equation it is possible to separate it into two equations since the magnetic field just affects the movement along x and y axes. The total energy becomes then, the sum of two contributions formula_11. The corresponding equations in z axis is:
: formula_12
To simplify things, the solution formula_13 is considered as an infinite well. Thus the solutions for the z direction are the energies formula_14, formula_15 and the wavefunctions are sinusoidal. For the formula_16 and formula_17 directions, the solution of the Schrödinger equation can be chosen to be the product of a plane wave in formula_17-direction with some unknown function of formula_16, i.e., formula_20. This is because the vector potential does not depend on formula_17 and the momentum operator formula_22 therefore commutes with the Hamiltonian. By substituting this Ansatz into the Schrödinger equation one gets the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator equation centered at formula_23.

: formula_24
where formula_25 is defined as the cyclotron frequency and formula_26 the magnetic length. The energies are:
: formula_27, formula_28

And the wavefunctions for the motion in the formula_29 plane are given by the product of a plane wave in formula_17 and Hermite polynomials attenuated by the gaussian function in formula_16, which are the wavefunctions of a harmonic oscillator.

From the expression for the Landau levels one notices that the energy depends only on formula_32, not on formula_33. States with the same formula_32 but different formula_33 are degenerate.

=== Density of states ===
At zero field, the density of states per unit surface for the two-dimensional electron gas taking into account degeneration due to spin is independent of the energy
: formula_36.
As the field is turned on, the density of states collapses from the constant to a Dirac comb, a series of Dirac formula_37 functions, corresponding to the Landau levels separated formula_38. At finite temperature, however, the Landau levels acquire a width formula_39 being formula_40 the time between scattering events. Commonly it is assumed that the precise shape of Landau levels is a Gaussian or Lorentzian profile.

Another feature is that the wave functions form parallel strips in the formula_17-direction spaced equally along the formula_16-axis, along the lines of formula_43. Since there is nothing special about any direction in the formula_29-plane if the vector potential was differently chosen one should find circular symmetry.

Given a sample of dimensions formula_45 and applying the periodic boundary conditions in the formula_17-direction formula_47 being formula_48 an integer, one gets that each parabolic potential is placed at a value formula_49.

The number of states for each Landau Level and formula_50 can be calculated from the ratio between the total magnetic flux that passes through the sample and the magnetic flux corresponding to a state.
: formula_51

Thus the density of states per unit surface is 
: formula_52.

Note the dependency of the density of states with the magnetic field. The larger the magnetic field is, the more states are in each Landau level. As a consequence, there is more confinement in the system since fewer energy levels are occupied.

Rewriting the last expression as formula_53 it is clear that each Landau level contains as many states as in a 2DEG in a formula_54.

Given the fact that electrons are fermions, for each state available in the Landau levels it corresponds to two electrons, one electron with each value for the spin formula_55. However, if a large magnetic field is applied, the energies split into two levels due to the magnetic moment associated with the alignment of the spin with the magnetic field. The difference in the energies is formula_56 being formula_57 a factor which depends on the material (formula_58 for free electrons) and formula_59 the Bohr magneton. The sign formula_60 is taken when the spin is parallel to the field and formula_61 when it is antiparallel. This fact called spin splitting implies that the density of states for each level is reduced by a half. Note that formula_62 is proportional to the magnetic field so, the larger the magnetic field is, the more relevant is the split.
In order to get the number of occupied Landau levels, one defines the so-called filling factor formula_63 as the ratio between the density of states in a 2DEG and the density of states in the Landau levels.

: formula_64

In general the filling factor formula_63 is not an integer. It happens to be an integer when there is an exact number of filled Landau levels. Instead, it becomes a non-integer when the top level is not fully occupied. In actual experiments, one varies the magnetic field and fixes electron density (and not the Fermi energy!) or varies the electron density and fixes the magnetic field. Both cases correspond to a continuous variation of the filling factor formula_63 and one cannot expect formula_63 to be an integer. Since formula_68, by increasing the magnetic field, the Landau levels move up in energy and the number of states in each level grow, so fewer electrons occupy the top level until it becomes empty. If the magnetic field keeps increasing, eventually, all electrons will be in the lowest Landau level (formula_69) and this is called the magnetic quantum limit.

=== Longitudinal resistivity ===
It is possible to relate the filling factor to the resistivity and hence, to the conductivity of the system. When formula_63 is an integer, the Fermi energy lies in between Landau levels where there are no states available for carriers, so the conductivity becomes zero (it is considered that the magnetic field is big enough so that there is no overlap between Landau levels, otherwise there would be few electrons and the conductivity would be approximately formula_71). Consequently, the resistivity becomes zero too (At very high magnetic fields it is proven that longitudinal conductivity and resistivity are proportional).

With the conductivity formula_72 one finds
: formula_73

If the longitudinal resistivity is zero and transversal is finite, then formula_74. Thus both the longitudinal conductivity and resistivity become zero.

Instead, when formula_63 is a half-integer, the Fermi energy is located at the peak of the density distribution of some Landau Level. This means that the conductivity will have a maximum .

This distribution of minimums and maximums corresponds to ¨quantum oscillations¨ called &quot;Shubnikov–de Haas oscillations&quot; which become more relevant as the magnetic field increases. Obviously, the height of the peaks are larger as the magnetic field increases since the density of states increases with the field, so there are more carriers which contribute to the resistivity. It is interesting to notice that if the magnetic field is very small, the longitudinal resistivity is a constant which means that the classical result is reached.

=== Transverse resistivity ===
From the classical relation of the transverse resistivity formula_76 and substituting formula_77 one finds out the quantization of the transverse resistivity and conductivity:
: formula_78

One concludes then, that the transverse resistivity is a multiple of the inverse of the so-called conductance quantum formula_79 if the filling factor is an integer. In experiments, however, plateaus are observed for whole plateaus of filling values formula_63, which indicates that there are in fact electron states between the Landau levels. These states are localized in, for example, impurities of the material where they are trapped in orbits so they can not contribute to the conductivity. That is why the resistivity remains constant in between Landau levels. Again if the magnetic field decreases, one gets the classical result in which the resistivity is proportional to the magnetic field.

== Photonic quantum Hall effect ==
The quantum Hall effect, in addition to being observed in two-dimensional electron systems, can be observed in photons. Photons do not possess inherent electric charge, but through the manipulation of discrete optical resonators and coupling phases or on-site phases, an artificial magnetic field can be created. This process can be expressed through a metaphor of photons bouncing between multiple mirrors. By shooting the light across multiple mirrors, the photons are routed and gain additional phase proportional to their angular momentum. This creates an effect like they are in a magnetic field.

== Topological classification ==

The integers that appear in the Hall effect are examples of topological quantum numbers. They are known in mathematics as the first Chern numbers and are closely related to Berry&#x27;s phase. A striking model of much interest in this context is the Azbel–Harper–Hofstadter model whose quantum phase diagram is the Hofstadter butterfly shown in the figure. The vertical axis is the strength of the magnetic field and the horizontal axis is the chemical potential, which fixes the electron density. The colors represent the integer Hall conductances. Warm colors represent positive integers and cold colors negative integers. Note, however, that the density of states in these regions of quantized Hall conductance is zero; hence, they cannot produce the plateaus observed in the experiments. The phase diagram is fractal and has structure on all scales. In the figure there is an obvious self-similarity. In the presence of disorder, which is the source of the plateaus seen in the experiments, this diagram is very different and the fractal structure is mostly washed away. Also, the experiments control the filling factor and not the Fermi energy. If this diagram is plotted as a function of filling factor, all the features are completely washed away, hence, it has very little to do with the actual Hall physics.

Concerning physical mechanisms, impurities and/or particular states (e.g., edge currents) are important for both the &#x27;integer&#x27; and &#x27;fractional&#x27; effects. In addition, Coulomb interaction is also essential in the fractional quantum Hall effect. The observed strong similarity between integer and fractional quantum Hall effects is explained by the tendency of electrons to form bound states with an even number of magnetic flux quanta, called &quot;composite fermions&quot;.

== Bohr atom interpretation of the von Klitzing constant ==

The value of the von Klitzing constant may be obtained already on the level of a single atom within the Bohr model while looking at it as a single-electron Hall effect. While during the cyclotron motion on a circular orbit the centrifugal force is balanced by the Lorentz force responsible for the transverse induced voltage and the Hall effect, one may look at the Coulomb potential difference in the Bohr atom as the induced single atom Hall voltage and the periodic electron motion on a circle as a Hall current. Defining the single atom Hall current as a rate a single electron charge formula_81 is making Kepler revolutions with angular frequency formula_82
: formula_83
and the induced Hall voltage as a difference between the hydrogen nucleus Coulomb potential at the electron orbital point and at infinity:
: formula_84

One obtains the quantization of the defined Bohr orbit Hall resistance in steps of the von Klitzing constant as
: formula_85
which for the Bohr atom is linear but not inverse in the integer &quot;n&quot;.

== Relativistic analogs ==

Relativistic examples of the integer quantum Hall effect and quantum spin Hall effect arise in the context of lattice gauge theory.

<text>Colloquial or spoken Finnish () is the unstandardized spoken variety of the Finnish language, in contrast with the standardized form of the language (). It is used primarily in personal communication and varies somewhat between the different dialects.

This article focuses on the variety of spoken Finnish that is predominant in the Helsinki metropolitan area and urbanized areas in the Tavastian and Central Finland dialectal areas, such as the cities of Tampere, Jyväskylä, Lahti, Hyvinkää, and Hämeenlinna – as well as in coastal cities such as Vaasa and Porvoo, which have been traditionally Swedish-speaking and have experienced an influx of Finnish speakers from a variety of dialectal areas.

The standard language takes most of its features from these dialects, i.e. most &quot;dialectal&quot; features are reductions with respect to this form of language. The combination of the common spoken Finnish and a dialect gives a regional variant (), which has some local idiosyncrasies but is essentially similar to the common spoken Finnish.

The basics of Finnish needed to fully understand this article can be found in pages about Finnish phonology and Finnish grammar.

== Introduction ==
As in any language, the spoken version(s) of Finnish often vary from the written form. Some of the latter&#x27;s constructs are either too arbitrary (e.g. &quot;soft d&quot;, cf. Finnish phonology), or too dialectal, e.g. (see below), for use in the spoken language. Furthermore, some very common and &quot;accentless&quot; sound changes are not reflected in the standard language, particularly fusion, liaison and some diphthong reductions.

There is also the problem that purists want to avoid irregularity regardless of actual usage. This has left some sound changes common in spoken language out from the standard language. There is a tendency to favor &quot;more logical&quot; constructs over easily pronounceable ones. This ideal does reflect spoken Finnish usage to a degree, as Finnish is demonstrably a conservative language with few reduction processes, but it is not entirely accurate. The problem of avoiding &quot;irregularity&quot; is most evident in spelling, where internal sandhi is not transcribed, because there is the idea that morphemes should be immutable. For example, the &quot;correct&quot; spelling is (&quot;I eat&quot; with emphasis), even though the pronunciation is usually . The explanation is that and are in different morphemes just like the explanation that English &quot;boys&quot; is not spelled with a &quot;z&quot; is that they are in different morphemes.

There are also a number of grammatical forms which are used in written Finnish, but only very rarely in spoken. For example, there are a number of constructions using participles which are usually rendered analytically in speech. Some cases and moods are rarely constructive in spoken Finnish, e.g. the instructive and comitative cases and the potential mood. Some survive only in expressions.

On the other hand, spoken language has its own features rarely or never found in formal language. Most importantly, there is very common external sandhi, and some assimilatory sound changes. (On the contrary, there is no vowel reduction.) In some variants (e.g. Vaasa, Kymenlaakso) of spoken Finnish (&quot;with [something]&quot;) is abbreviated into a clitic that is effectively a comitative case, e.g. or .
== Pronunciation ==

===Reflexes of dental fricatives===
The most common reflexes for old Finnish dental fricatives are for , and or for . For example, or ← &quot;forest, of the forest&quot; and &lt; &quot;ours&quot;. Loss of also occurs, e.g. . These are seen as &quot;accent-free&quot; pronunciations. Dialects generally have different reflexes — in fact, the different reflexes are used as a distinguishing feature between different dialects. For more details, see Finnish phonology.

===Word-final &quot;n&quot;===
One important sound change, which has gone to completion in Estonian but occurs idiosyncratically in Finnish, is mutation of word-final into a glottal stop , orthographically represented by an apostrophe. In some dialects, such as Savo, word-final is systematically replaced by , e.g. ← &quot;father&#x27;s voice&quot;. Both pronunciations can be heard in the Helsinki area. This means that the genitive/accusative form , which is very common in any form of Finnish, is simply noted by a glottal stop. However, this glottal stop undergoes sandhi whenever followed by consonant, or more often than not (see below).

===Final vowels===
Certain wordforms that end in in Standard Finnish occur without the word-final in the spoken language. This includes the base form of certain word stems as well as inflectional endings. In nouns this affects the translative case ending and the 2nd person singular possessive suffix . In verbs, loss of &quot;i&quot; affects the conditional mood ending and, in certain verb inflection classes where it is preceded by an &quot;s&quot;, the preterite ending . These endings occur word-finally in 3rd person forms.
In many dialects loss of final &quot;i&quot; is commonplace not only in these cases but also elsewhere.

Particularly in Helsinki, deletion of or , spelt «ä» and «a», respectively, in highly frequent words is common. This is a feature of Western Finnish dialects, found also in Savonian dialects and Estonian. 
: — &#x27;but&#x27;
: — &#x27;yes&#x27;
: — elative case, &#x27;out of / away from the inside of&#x27;

===Vowel clusters and diphthongs===
Word-final vowel clusters ending in or have much variation in dialects of Finnish. Especially in Helsinki they assimilate, where only the resulting chroneme marks the partitive in many words.
: — &quot;I speak Finnish&quot;
: — &quot;(some) long (things)&quot;; partitive plural of , long
An or cluster also appears in many adjectives:
: — &quot;dark&quot;
In other areas of Finland, these clusters may have a different fate. Another common dialectal variant is the raising of to in the adjectives: . (Partitives are unaffected by this.) Some rarer versions of this suffix include , , and even .

Similar to the diphthongization of older to (unchanged in standard Estonian), many eastern dialects of Finnish diphthongize also the long vowels to . In Savonian dialects, these have shifted further on to .

 can become when in contact with another vowel. In many cases this results from colloquial deletion of . For example:
* for standard &quot;I know&quot;
* for standard &quot;to take away&quot;
* for standard &quot;to hit&quot;
* for standard &quot;to bring&quot;

===Sandhi===
A related phenomenon is the final consonant sandhi. When two words co-occur in the same prosodic unit, the consonant beginning the second word assimilates to the word-final consonant in the first word, creating a long consonant. This is not commonly written down, except in dialectal transcriptions. For example, 

== Personal pronouns ==
Some dialects have the full-length personal pronouns and , but most people use shorter forms, like these found in the Helsinki metropolitan area region:
: → 

Note: these do differ depending on where the speaker is from. For example can also be , , etc.

The root words are also shorter:

: → , e.g. → &quot;my&quot;
: → , e.g. → &quot;yours&quot;

The third-person pronouns (&#x27;he&#x27;, &#x27;she&#x27;, singular &#x27;they&#x27;) and (plural &#x27;they&#x27;), are rarely used in the spoken language outside of Southwestern Finland and are getting rare there, as well. Elsewhere, they are usually replaced by and , which in the standard language do not refer to people.
: → 

For example, the sentence &quot;Did he mistake me for you?&quot; has these forms:
: or 

Similarly, non-personal demonstrative pronouns are often used in place of or , meaning people may be referred to as &#x27;that&#x27; and &#x27;those&#x27;. This also does not carry any pejorative meaning. The words are also changed from their written form.
: → → 

For example, when pointing out a culprit, the sentence &quot;He broke it.&quot; has these forms:
: or 

== Numerals ==
Numerals 1–10 in colloquial spoken Finnish:
# ()
# ()
# ()
# ()
# ()
Numbers 11-19 are formed by appending , which can be shortened to . Numbers 20-90 are formed by appending , which can be shortened to or even . , and can be abbreviated to , and with , but not independently, as in &quot;33&quot; or &quot;74&quot;.

When counting out loud, even shorter forms are used, mostly one-syllable words with long vowels:
#
#
#
#
#
 becomes , or even . becomes , with 20-60 typically retaining their longer numeral forms (e.g. rather than for 20). 70 is typically or , while 80 and 90 do with and .

The numerals 1–9 have their own names, different from the cardinal numbers used in counting. Numbers that have longer names are often shortened in speech. This may be problematic for a foreigner to understand, if they have learnt words by book:

: (number one)
: (number two)
: (number three)
: (number four)
: (number five) → , (Helsinki slang)
: (number six) → 
: (number seven) → 
: / (number eight) → / 
: / (number nine) → / 
: → , (Helsinki slang)

The suffix normally denotes a group of x people, but on 8 and 9, it doubles as a synonym for the numeral&#x27;s name. is also used to describe a figure eight shape.

The regular / forms can additionally be used of objects with an ID number. For example, bus 107 is called , and a competition winner is an (not or .)

== Verbs ==

=== Pronoun usage ===
Personal pronouns are used extensively in spoken Finnish whereas in formal forms the pronoun is often optional (indicated in brackets in this article). Furthermore, the pronouns themselves in spoken Finnish are different from those used in formal Finnish.

Personal pronouns and are used extensively in colloquial Finnish in place of and (&#x27;I&#x27; and singular &#x27;you&#x27;). The pronouns and , which in the formal language are used only as non-human personal pronouns meaning (&#x27;it&#x27; and plural &#x27;they&#x27;), are used in the spoken language as personal pronouns (which in the formal language would be (&#x27;he&#x27;, &#x27;she&#x27; and singular &#x27;they&#x27;) and (plural &#x27;they&#x27;).

See the tables below for examples.

=== Verb forms ===
One striking difference between colloquial Finnish and formal Finnish is use of the passive form in the first person plural. Thus for example:

: (formal language)
:: (colloquial Finnish)
:::We&#x27;re in Helsinki

Another is that the third person plural suffix or is not used in the spoken language; instead, the third person &quot;singular&quot; form is used with plural meaning being conveyed by the pronoun ()

Therefore, the full present-tense paradigm of &quot;to speak&quot; in everyday speech is:

: (spoken) — (standard)
: — 
: — 

Some &quot;e&quot;-stem verbs have abbreviated (irregular) oblique forms, where or is elided. This class includes only four frequently used verbs. In Finnish, verbs have an infinitive form, marked with and used in the infinitive, and an oblique form, which is used in personal forms. Consonant gradation and assimilation of the &#x27;t&#x27; in may be applied. In the standard language, the correspondence between the two is always regular. In spoken language, some verbs have assimilated oblique forms, while retaining the regular infinitive:

For example, these forms, as such, are represented by the imperatives:
: (standard)
: (word-by-word) &quot;Go or come, but put the door closed and be quiet.&quot;
To demonstrate the use of the personal form, the reply is:
: (&quot;I go or come, (I) put the door closed and (I) am quiet&quot;).
The infinitives are unchanged, as in:
: (&quot;To go or to come, to put the door closed and to be quiet&quot;).
As are participles, despite their using the oblique stem:
: (&quot;Going or coming, door closed-putting and quiet-being&quot;).

The &#x27;t&#x27; at the end of participles ending (or etc.) is often dropped when no consonant follows, or replaced by gemination of the following consonant:

: (formal)
:: (colloquial)
:::I didn&#x27;t speak
but:

:: (colloquial)
:::I didn&#x27;t speak to anyone
is actually pronounced as if it were:

:: (with examples of gemination)

In the formal language some pronouns are considered optional, but in spoken language the pronoun is usually enunciated but may be optional when answering questions (which puts the person in the proper context).

: or (&quot;We are going to Oulu&quot;) (formal language)
: (&quot;We are off to Oulu&quot;) (informal language)

In the latter example, dropping would change the meaning from a statement to a suggestion:

: (&quot;Let&#x27;s go to Oulu&quot;) (informal or spoken language suggestion)

Compare the conjugation of in the formal language (Table 1) and in the spoken or colloquial language (Table 2). Table 2 shows in highlights the areas where there are differences in the structures between formal and informal. Optional pronouns are in brackets. English equivalent is in Table 3.



== Questions ==
In everyday speech, the suffix has the clitic added, becoming , which in turn reduces to :

: → &quot;am I alive?&quot;
: → or &quot;do you (sg.) speak English?&quot;
: → (via ) &quot;did he/she come yet?&quot;

The choice of morphemes or is not always purely dialectal or accidental. Many Finns regularly use more than one variation in their speech. The choice might depend among others on the rhythm of the sentence or the (wished) tempo of the discussion. Sometimes it has other clearly communicational purposes e.g. the longer variation might be used to soften an intruding question.

The clitic is also found in imperatives, e.g. &quot;(I expect you to) go!&quot; It can also be, that the elides not to , but before a &#x27;s&#x27;, e.g. ? . Because this is identical to except for the word order, questions are indicated by word order.

== Possessive suffix ==
Spoken language has a different grammar for the possessive suffix. In contrast to the literary language, the pronoun is optional and typically omitted. Compare English in which, e.g., &quot;The house to which this door belongs&quot; would be the correct written form even though &quot;the house whose door this is&quot; would be the more common spoken version.

Here, the pronoun of the literary form is also shown.

Notice that Finnish has no possessive adjectives. The pronouns are regularly inflected, like if &quot;I&#x27;s house&quot;, &quot;you&#x27;s house&quot;, &quot;we&#x27;s house&quot;.

However, the suffixes , and are used to avoid repeating a pronoun, e.g. &quot;He took his hat and left&quot; is (The translation from English * would mean &quot;He took his/her hat and left&quot; or &quot;He took the (specific) hat and left&quot;).

== Omission of the negative verb ==
When a negative sentence is formed, the main verb goes into the connegative form, which is identical to the imperative mood, and gives all of its inflections to the negative verb , e.g. → . Usually the word (&quot;anything&quot;) and an expletive is added to the sentence. This means that even if the negative verb is left out, the meaning is indicated by this context. For example:

: &quot;He doesn&#x27;t know anything.&quot;
: &quot;He know anything.&quot; (&quot;doesn&#x27;t&quot; omitted)

This omission of the negative verb is considered one of the most recent changes in Finnish. Usually this construction indicates mistrust or frustration. (A parody article by Jaakko Häkkinen calls this , see aggressive mood.) However, it can be a neutral negative statement: (From this article, you don&#x27;t learn anything).

== Regional variation ==
Linguists such as Mielikäinen argue that the dialects of Finnish have been considerably homogenized by 20th century developments of urbanization and other internal population movements to the point that &quot;pure&quot; dialects have disappeared. &quot;Local spoken languages&quot; have developed from standard Finnish to give variety with essentially standard Finnish structure but with some local features. Considerable stigma has been associated with dialects (accurately or not) perceived as rural in the 20th century. People who have moved to the city have adopted a variety resembling standard Finnish, which has been imposed upon dialect speakers by the school, the military and the employers.

Breaking up some consonant clusters on syllable boundaries with an epenthetic vowel is a feature of several dialects, such as those of Ostrobothnia and Savonia: The neutral vowel is the same as the preceding vowel. For example, → &quot;celebration&quot;, → &quot;strait&quot;, → &quot;service&quot;, → &quot;cheap&quot;, → (via ) &quot;letter F&quot;. Pairs of dissimilar consonants with or (in Savo, also ) as the first consonant are subject to epenthesis; other clusters or geminates are not. However, a strong epenthetic vowel is seen as dialectal, and in Helsinki and urbanized areas, indicates origins &quot;in the countryside&quot; (since for Helsinki people, everything but Helsinki is rural).

=== Tavastian dialects ===
Tavastian dialects are diverse because other, surrounding dialects have influenced them. The following features are all found in Finnish spoken in Helsinki, and many of them occur also in some other Tavastian dialects.
* Word &quot;in that way&quot;, which is usually something else like elsewhere.
* Partitive plurals ending in generic Finnish become , and likewise the partitive plural simplifies to : → &quot;wet jackets&quot;. (also in Nurmijärvi, Kotka)
* The first infinitive, e.g. &quot;to run&quot;, is replaced by the third-person form &quot;runs&quot; by some speakers. For example, standard becomes &quot;Could you run to get it&quot;. This form is probably historically speaking not the third-person form, but the colloquial, shortened form of the third infinitive form , which exhibits a tendency to oust the first infinitive even in the formal language, cf. the old dispute, whether (&quot;to start running&quot;) should be allowed in the formal language or not (the current norm is still with the first infinitive). (also in Tuusula and Nurmijärvi)
* Abbreviations are common in Finnish spoken in the Southern coast of Finland. Final syllables in frequently used words may erode, like → , → . Case endings might be abbreviated, usually by the loss of the final vowel, e.g. → . (If a geminate would be &quot;left dangling&quot; at the end of the word, it becomes a single consonant, e.g. → * → .)
* Helsinki also has a local slang, containing foreign loanwords which may be unintelligible to people from other parts of Finland. Some slang words have spread to the spoken language of youngsters elsewhere in Finland.
* Tampere is also in the area of Tavastian dialects.
** Occasional flapping or deletion of intervocalic &quot;L&quot;; the resulting sound is orthographically nil: → . This is seen even in the accentless form ← standard .

=== North and South Karelia === 
* Personal pronouns: → , → , → , → , → , → 
** Notice: and don&#x27;t change to or respectively and and are more commonly used than and unlike in the standard colloquial language where and are replaced with the non-personal equivalents
** The declined forms also vary, for example can be , or depending on the regional dialect
* Vowel epenthesis in North Karelia: → , → 
* In some Karelian dialects the end of participles ending -nut or -nyt and -lut drop the vowel instead of &#x27;t&#x27;: → , → , → /, → /, → , → 
* Some Karelian (and Savonian) dialects also use the exessive case: → , → , → 
* The North Karelian dialect is a subset of the Savonian dialects, while the South Karelian dialect is a unique Finnish dialect.

=== Southwestern dialects ===
* Abbreviation occurs very often.
* In Turku: → , → 
* A unique characteristic of Turku dialect is the &quot;S&quot; imperfect tense, which has the ending instead of , e.g., for .

=== Savonia ===
* Some difference in pronouns, for . Notice that the Savo dialect has complicated differences in grammar, vowels and consonants compared to the standard language, e.g. for , for , → . The Savo dialect is the largest single dialect, and as such, has variants that differ significantly.

=== Ostrobothnia === 
* Consonant clusters with are not allowed, so that a is pronounced instead, e.g. → . The sound is completely replaced with a rhotic consonant , either a trill , or a flap , which produces problems such as that there is no or almost no contrast between (of water) and (of blood). For speakers with the flap, there remains a small difference, not generally audible for outsiders. Usually context can be relied on to distinguish the word.
* Minor vowel changes, for example, → . In Southern Ostrobotnia, in unstressed syllables old diphthongs ending in &quot;i&quot; are reflected as long vowels, e.g. → . In some words, where the diphthong has been lost from the standard language, this results in seemingly unmotivated long vowels, e.g. → . 
*Vaasa, Ostrobothnia, to an extent generic Finnish, too: Many frequently used expressions become clitics - this is optional, though. E.g. pronouns become clitics for the negative verb and for the verb &quot;to be&quot;. In this table, the apostrophe (&#x27;) is something between a full J and no sound at all.

* Additionally, in the Southwest, the interrogative pronoun (&quot;who&quot;) is replaced by its partitive form, (&quot;whom&quot;), e.g. (&quot;Who was there?&quot;) Other differences in case for interrogative words are (std. , &quot;where&quot;) and (std. , &quot;into where&quot;).

<text>Unless otherwise noted, statements in this article refer to Standard Finnish, which is based on the dialect spoken in the former Häme Province in central south Finland. Standard Finnish is used by professional speakers, such as reporters and news presenters on television.

==Vowels==


* The close vowels are similar to the corresponding cardinal vowels .
* The mid vowels are phonetically mid .
* The open front unrounded vowel is phonetically near-open .
* The unrounded open vowel transcribed in IPA with has been variously described as near-open back and open central .

Finnish has a phonological contrast between single () and double () vowels. Phonetically long vowels are single continuous sounds () where the extra duration of the hold phase of the vowel signals that they count as two successive vowel phonemes rather than one. Long mid vowels are more common in unstressed syllables.

===Diphthongs===
The table below lists the conventionally postulated diphthongs in Finnish. In speech (i.e. phonetically speaking) a diphthong does not sound like a sequence of two different vowels; instead, the sound of the first vowel gradually glides into the sound of the second one with full vocalization lasting through the whole sound. That is to say, the two portions of the diphthong are not broken by a pause or stress pattern. In Finnish, diphthongs contrast with both long vowels and short vowels. Phonologically, however, Finnish diphthongs are usually analyzed as sequences of two vowels (this in contrast to languages like English, where the diphthongs are best analyzed as independent phonemes).

Diphthongs ending in can occur in any syllable, but those ending in rounded vowels usually occur only in initial syllables, and rising diphthongs are confined to that syllable. It is usually taught that diphthongization occurs only with the combinations listed. However, there are recognized situations in which other vowel pairs diphthongize. For example, in rapid speech the word (&#x27;upper part&#x27;, from , &#x27;upper&#x27; + , &#x27;part&#x27;) can be pronounced (with the diphthong ). The usual pronunciation is (with those vowels belonging to separate syllables).

The diphthongs and are quite rare and mostly found in derivative words, where a derivational affix starting with (or properly the vowel harmonic archiphoneme ) fuses with the preceding vowel, e.g. &#x27;darkness&#x27; from &#x27;dark&#x27; + &#x27;-ness&#x27; and &#x27;to tidy up oneself&#x27; from &#x27;tidy&#x27; + (a kind of middle voice) + (infinitive suffix). Older and in initial syllables have been shifted to and .

Opening diphthongs are in standard Finnish only found in root-initial syllables like in words &#x27;to know&#x27;, &#x27;rear wheel&#x27; (from &#x27;back, rear&#x27; + &#x27;wheel&#x27;; the latter part is secondarily stressed) or &#x27;towards&#x27;. This might make them easier to pronounce as true opening diphthongs (in some accents even wider opening ) and not as centering diphthongs , which are more common in the world&#x27;s languages. The opening diphthongs come from earlier doubled mid vowels: . Since that time new doubled mid vowels have come to the language from various sources.

Among the phonological processes operating in Finnish dialects are diphthongization and diphthong reduction. For example, Savo Finnish has the phonemic contrast of vs. vs. instead of standard language contrast of vs. vs. .

===Vowel harmony===

Finnish, like many other Uralic languages, has the phenomenon called vowel harmony, which restricts the cooccurrence in a word of vowels belonging to different articulatory subgroups. Vowels within a word &quot;harmonize&quot; to be either all front or all back. In particular, no native noncompound word can contain vowels from the group {&quot;a&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, &quot;u&quot;} together with vowels from the group {&quot;ä&quot;, &quot;ö&quot;, &quot;y&quot;}. Vowel harmony affects inflectional suffixes and derivational suffixes, which have two forms, one for use with back vowels, and the other with front vowels. Compare, for example, the following pair of abstract nouns: &#x27;government&#x27; (from , &#x27;to reign&#x27;) versus &#x27;health&#x27; (from , healthy).

There are exceptions to the constraint of vowel harmony. For one, there are two front vowels that lack back counterparts: and . Therefore, words like &#x27;clock&#x27; (with a front vowel in a non-final syllable) and &#x27;wind&#x27; (with a front vowel in the final syllable), which contain or together with a back vowel, count as back vowel words; and are effectively neutral in regard to vowel harmony in such words. and yield the inflectional forms &#x27;in a clock&#x27; and &#x27;in a wind&#x27;. In words containing only neutral vowels, front vowel harmony is used, e.g. – (&#x27;road&#x27; – &#x27;on the road&#x27;). For another, compound words do not have vowel harmony across the compound boundary; e.g. &#x27;wall clock&#x27; (from , &#x27;wall&#x27; and , &#x27;clock&#x27;) has back cooccurring with front . In the case of compound words, the choice between back and front suffix alternants is determined by the immediately-preceding element of the compound; e.g. &#x27;in a wall clock&#x27; is , not .

A particular exception appears in a standard Finnish word, (&#x27;this kind of&#x27;). Although by definition a singular word, it was originally a compound word that transitioned over time to a more compact and easier form: (from , &#x27;of this&#x27; and , &#x27;kind&#x27;) → → , and further to for some non-standard speech.

New loan words may exhibit vowel disharmony; for example, (&#x27;Olympic games&#x27;) and (&#x27;secondary&#x27;) have both front and back vowels. In standard Finnish, these words are pronounced as they are spelled, but many speakers apply vowel harmony – , and or .

==Consonants==
* For most speakers, is dental , whereas and are alveolar. The contrast between /t/ and /d/ is not a voicing distinction, but rather a contrast in place as well as duration of occlusion.
* may sometimes be closer to a flap or tap than a true plosive , and the dialectal realization varies widely; it is increasingly common to pronounce it as a true plosive, however. See the section below. In native vocabulary it is the equivalent of under weakening consonant gradation, and thus it occurs only word-medially, either by itself (e.g. &#x27;rain&#x27;; cf. &#x27;to rain&#x27;) or in the cluster (e.g. &#x27;fountain, spring, source&#x27;; cf. &#x27;to depart&#x27;). In recent loanwords and technical vocabulary the sound can occur somewhat freely (e.g. , , , , , , ), likewise in slang vocabulary (e.g. &#x27;idiot&#x27;, &#x27;condition&#x27;).
* is frequently retracted alveolar .
* A glottal stop can appear at certain morpheme boundaries, the same ones as the gemination described further down as a result of certain sandhi phenomena, and it is not normally indicated in spelling at the end of a word: e.g. &#x27;let it be&#x27;, orthographically . Moreover, this sound is not used in all dialects. However, word-internally, it can be indicated by an apostrophe, which can occur when a is lost between similar vowels, e.g. &#x27;scales&#x27; → &#x27;scales (nom.pl.)&#x27;.
* The velar nasal is also heavily limited in occurrence in native vocabulary: it is found only word-medially, either in the consonant cluster (written ), or as geminate (written ), the latter being the counterpart of the former under consonant gradation (type of lenition). In recent loanwords may also occur in other environments; e.g. , . Spellings with &quot;ng&quot; and &quot;gn&quot; do not indicate the presence of the phoneme /g/ - instead, they are used because there&#x27;s no separate letter for .
* &quot;is often accompanied by a somewhat ballistic lower-lip gesture, producing something like a labiodental flap.&quot;
*r] may sometimes be pronounced as a tap or flap ɾ], especially between vowels in rapid speech.
 does not appear in native phonology; however, it exists in the variation between foreign-origin geminate and native consonant cluster in many loanwords, retrogradely occurring also in the native word &quot;ahven&quot; &#x27;perch&#x27; in some southwestern dialects (dialectal as &quot;ahvena&quot; ~ &quot;affena&quot; ). Generally, is reliably distinguished by Finnish speakers, but other foreign fricatives are not. or appears only in non-native words, sometimes pronounced , although most speakers make a distinction between e.g. &#x27;chess&#x27; and &#x27;a gang (of people)&#x27;. The orthography also includes the letters and , although their use is marginal, and they have no phonemic status. For example, and may be pronounced and without fear of confusion. The letter , found mostly in foreign words and names such as Zulu, may also be pronounced as following the influence of German, thus .
*The phoneme has glottal and fricative allophones. In general, at the end of a syllable it is pronounced as a fricative whose place of articulation is similar to the preceding vowel: velar after a back vowel (), palatal after a high front vowel (). Between vowels a breathy or murmured can occur:
** , , 
** 

===Voiced plosives===

Traditionally, and were not counted as Finnish phonemes, since they appear only in loanwords. However, these borrowings being relatively common, they are nowadays considered part of the educated norm. The failure to use them correctly is often ridiculed in the media, e.g. if a news reporter or a high official consistently and publicly realises (&#x27;Belgium&#x27;) as . Even many educated speakers, however, still make no distinction between voiced and voiceless plosives in regular speech if there is no fear of confusion. Minimal pairs do exist: &#x27;a bus&#x27; vs. &#x27;a bag&#x27;, &#x27;a gorilla&#x27; vs. &#x27;on a basket&#x27;.

The status of is somewhat different from and , since it also appears in native Finnish words, as a regular &#x27;weak&#x27; correspondence of the voiceless (see Consonant gradation below). Historically, this sound was a fricative, , varyingly spelled as or in Old Literary Finnish (which is based on southwestern dialects), and realised in native dialects with significantly large allophony of frontal consonants or even completely degraded depending on the dialectal gradation features. Its realization as a plosive originated as a spelling pronunciation, in part because when mass elementary education was instituted in Finland, the spelling in Finnish texts was mispronounced as a plosive, under the influence of how Swedish speakers would pronounce this letter. Initially, few native speakers of Finnish acquired the foreign plosive realisation of the native phoneme. As for loanwords, was often assimilated to as a strong grade consonant. Even well into the 20th century it was not entirely exceptional to hear loanwords like (&#x27;a deodorant&#x27;) pronounced as , while native Finnish words with a were pronounced in the usual dialectal way. Due to diffusion of the standard language through mass media and basic education, and due to the dialectal prestige of the capital area, the plosive can now be heard in all parts of the country, at least in loanwords and in formal speech.

===Consonant gradation===

Consonant gradation in Finnish involves alternations between a &quot;strong grade&quot; and a &quot;weak grade&quot; of consonants, influenced by both phonological and grammatical factors. Historically, a consonant would shift to its weak grade if it was part of a closed syllable. However, due to language evolution, there are now instances where the weak grade may or may not appear regardless of the syllable being open or closed, such as in &quot;Turkuun&quot; where the strong grade appears in a closed syllable. Grammatically, the weak grade typically shows up in nouns, pronouns, and adjectives before case suffixes, and in verbs before person agreement suffixes.

The following is a general list of strong–weak correspondences.

===Other consonant alternations===
Many of the remaining &quot;irregular&quot; patterns of Finnish noun and verb inflection are explained by a change of a historical to . The change from to , a type of assibilation, is unconnected to consonant gradation, and dates back as early as Proto-Finnic. In modern Finnish the alternation is not productive, due to new cases of the sequence having been introduced by later sound changes and loanwords, and assibilation therefore occurs only in certain morphologically defined positions.

Words having this particular alternation are still subject to consonant gradation in forms that lack assibilation. Thus Finnish nouns of this type could be seen as having up to five distinct stems: a word such as &#x27;water (sg. nom.)&#x27; has the forms (sg. gen.), (sg. part.), (sg. ill.) (pl. part.); as can be seen from the examples the change from to has only occurred in front of . When a vowel other than occurs, words like inflect just like other nouns with a single alternating with the consonant gradated . Alternatively, Kiparsky proposes that all Finnish stems must end in a vowel, which in the case of polysyllabic stems may then be deleted when adding certain affixes and certain other conditions are fulfilled. For he proposes the stem /vete/ (with stem final -e), which when combined with the partitive singular affix -tä/-ta drops the -e to become (sg. part.).

This pattern has, however, been reverted in some cases. Variation appears in particular in past tense verb forms, e.g. , (&#x27;to deny&#x27;, &#x27;denied&#x27;) but , (&#x27;to adjust&#x27;, &#x27;adjusted&#x27;). Both alternate forms ( and ) can also be found in dialects. Apparently this was caused by word pairs such as , (&#x27;bring&#x27;) and , (&#x27;rise&#x27;), which were felt important enough to keep them contrastive.

Assibilation occurred prior to the change of the original consonants cluster to , which can be seen in the inflection of the numerals , and , .

In many recent loanwords, there is vacillation between representing an original voiceless consonant as single or geminate: this is the case for example (~ ) and (~ ). The orthography generally favors the single form, if it exists. (More completely assimilated loans such as , , generally have settled on geminates.)

==Length==
All phonemes except and can occur doubled phonemically as a phonetic increase in length. Consonant doubling always occurs at the boundary of a syllable in accordance with the rules of Finnish syllable structure.

Some example sets of words:
: &#x27;fire&#x27;/&#x27;s/he came&#x27;, &#x27;wind&#x27;, &#x27;customs&#x27;
: &#x27;mud&#x27;, &#x27;other&#x27; (partitive sg.), &#x27;but&#x27;, &#x27;to change&#x27; or &#x27;to move&#x27;

A double is rare in standard Finnish, but possible, e.g. , a derogatory term for a religious fanatic. In some dialects, e.g. Savo, it is common: , or standard Finnish &#x27;money&#x27; (in the partitive case). The distinction between and is found only in foreign words; natively &#x27;d&#x27; occurs only in the short form. While and may appear as geminates when spoken (e.g. , ), this distinction is not phonemic, and is not indicated in spelling.

==Phonotactics==
The phonemic template of a syllable in Finnish is (C)V(C)(C), in which C can be an obstruent or a liquid consonant. V can be realized as a doubled vowel or a diphthong. A final consonant of a Finnish word, though not a syllable, must be a coronal one; Standard Finnish does not allow final clusters of two consonants.

Originally Finnish syllables could not start with two consonants but many loans containing these have added this to the inventory. This is observable in older loans such as &lt; Swedish (&#x27;French&#x27;) contrasting newer loans &lt; Swedish (&#x27;president&#x27;). In past decades, it was common to hear these clusters simplified in speech (), particularly, though not exclusively, by either rural Finns or Finns who knew little or no Swedish or English. Even then, the Southwestern dialects formed an exception: consonant clusters, especially those with plosives, trills or nasals, are common: examples include place names and near the town Pori, or town (&#x27;Kristinestad&#x27;). Nowadays the overwhelming majority of Finns have adopted initial consonant clusters in their speech.

===Consonant phonotactics===
Consonant phonotactics are as follows.

Word-final consonants
* Only .
* Glottal stop occurs almost exclusively at word boundaries, replacing what used to be word-final consonants and .

Word-initial consonants
* All consonants may occur word initially, except and (although an initial may be found in loan words).

Word-initial consonant clusters
* No consonant clusters in native words, various consonant clusters in modern loanwords (e.g. = &#x27;clinic&#x27;, = &#x27;psychology&#x27;, = &#x27;statistics&#x27;, = &#x27;strategy&#x27;).

Word-final consonant clusters
* None, except in dialects via vowel dropping.

Word-medial consonant clusters
* The following clusters are not possible:
** any exceeding 3 consonants (except in loan words)
** stop + nasal
** labial stop + non-labial stop
** non-dental stop + semivowel
** nasal + non-homorganic obstruent (except )
** nasal + sonorant
** liquid + liquid
** semivowel + consonant

===Vowel phonotactics===
Vowel phonotactics are as follows.

Word-final and word-initial vowels
* Any of the vowels can be found in this position.

Vowel sequences
* Doubled vowels
** Usually only the vowels are doubled.
** Sometimes the mid vowels can be doubled in cases of contraction.
* Diphthongs
** Of the 18 diphthongs, 15 are formed from any vowel followed by a close vowel. The 3 exceptions are .
* Vowel combinations
** Approximately 20 combinations, always at syllable boundaries.
** Unlike diphthongs, the second vowel is longer, as is expected, and it can be open or .
** Sometimes 3–4 vowels can occur in a sequence if a medial consonant has disappeared.

/ee/, /oo/ and /øø/ are allowed by phonotactics, but they are rare because they underwent a sound change in Proto-Finnic to /ie/, /uo/ and /yø/. They have been reintroduced in loanwords (e.g. &quot;peesata&quot;, &quot;hoonata&quot;, &quot;amatööri&quot;).

==Prosody==

===Stress===
Stress in Finnish is non-phonemic. Like Hungarian and Icelandic, Finnish primary stress always occurs on the first syllable of a word. Secondary stress normally falls on odd-numbered syllables. Contrary to primary stress, Finnish secondary stress is quantity sensitive. Thus, if secondary stress would normally fall on a light (CV.) syllable but this is followed by a heavy syllable (CVV. or CVC.), the secondary stress moves one syllable further (&quot;to the right&quot;) and the preceding foot (syllable group) therefore contains three syllables. Thus, (&quot;as my apple&quot;) contains light syllables only and has primary stress on the first syllable and secondary on the third, as expected: &quot;ómenànani&quot;. On the other hand, (&#x27;as our apple&#x27;) has a light third syllable () and a heavy fourth syllable (), so secondary stress falls on the fourth syllable: &quot;ómenanàmme&quot;.

Certain Finnish dialects also have quantity-sensitive main stress pattern, but instead of moving the initial stress, they geminate the consonant, so that e.g. light-heavy CV.CVV becomes heavy-heavy CVCCVV, e.g. the partitive form of &quot;fish&quot; is pronounced in the quantity-insensitive dialects but in the quantity-sensitive ones (cf. also the examples under the &quot;Length&quot; section).

Secondary stress falls on the first syllable of non-initial parts of compounds, for example the compound , meaning &quot;wooden face&quot; (from , &#x27;tree&#x27; and , &#x27;face&#x27;), is pronounced but , meaning &quot;which was cleaned&quot; (preceded by an agent in the genitive, &quot;by someone&quot;), is pronounced .

===Timing===
Finnish is not really isochronic at any level. For example, (&#x27;shouting&#x27;) and (&#x27;flushing&#x27;) are distinct words, where the initial syllables and are of different length. Additionally, acoustic measurements show that the first syllable of a word is longer in duration than other syllables, in addition to its phonological doubling, unless it is an open syllable containing a short vowel in which case the second syllable has a longer duration.

==Sandhi==

Finnish sandhi is extremely frequent, appearing between many words and morphemes, in formal standard language and in everyday spoken language. In most registers, it is never written down; only dialectal transcriptions preserve it, the rest settling for a morphemic notation. There are two processes. The first is simple assimilation with respect to place of articulation (e.g. &gt; ). The second is predictive gemination of initial consonants on morpheme boundaries.

Simple phonetic incomplete assimilations include:
* , velarization due to &#x27;k&#x27;, e.g. 
* , labialization due to &#x27;p&#x27; e.g. 
* , dissimilation of a sequence of individual vowels (compared to diphthongs) by adding a glottal stop, e.g. (not obligatory)

Gemination of a morpheme-initial consonant occurs when the morpheme preceding it ends in a vowel and belongs to one of certain morphological classes. Gemination or a tendency of a morpheme to cause gemination is sometimes indicated with an apostrophe or a superscripted &quot;x&quot;, e.g. . Examples of gemination:
* most nouns ending in (apart from some new loanwords), specifically those with the singular partitive ending in 
:: e.g. (&#x27;open-box bed for wood chips&#x27;)
* imperatives and connegative imperatives of the second-person singular, as well as the connegative form of the present indicative (these three are always similar to each other)
:: e.g. (&#x27;buy a boat&#x27;) 
* connegative imperatives of the third-person singular, first-person plural, second-person plural, third-person plural and passive
:: (&#x27;actually, don&#x27;t do it&#x27;)
* connegative forms of present passive indicative verbs
:: (&#x27;it will not be taken after all&#x27;, colloquially &#x27;we won&#x27;t take it after all&#x27;)
* connegative forms of present potential verbs (including passive)
:: (&#x27;I probably will not do it (after all)&#x27;, formal or poetic speech)
* first infinitives (the dictionary form)
:: e.g. 
* noun cases in : allative as well as the more marginal sublative (as in ) and prolative (as in ) and (only for some speakers) the comitative for adjectives, when it is not followed by a possessive suffix
* adverbs ending in , and 
* the possessive suffix of the third person /
* some other words such as (&#x27;to, towards [a person or place]&#x27;), , , , &#x27;probably&#x27;, &#x27;or&#x27;, (only for some speakers) &#x27;self&#x27;

The gemination can occur between morphemes of a single word as in + → (&#x27;to me too&#x27;; orthographically ), between parts of a compound word as in + → (&#x27;family meeting&#x27;; orthographically ), or between separate words as in + → (&#x27;come here!&#x27;). In elaborate standard language, the gemination affects even morphemes with a vowel beginning: + → or (&#x27;take an apple!&#x27;). In casual speech, this is however often rendered as without a glottal stop.

These rules are generally valid for the standard language, although many Southwestern dialects, for instance, do not recognise the phenomenon at all. Even in the standard language there is idiolectal variation (disagreement between different speakers); e.g. whether (&#x27;three&#x27;) should cause a gemination of the following initial consonant or not: or (&#x27;three crows&#x27;). Both forms occur and neither one of them is standardised, since in any case it does not affect writing. In some dictionaries compiled for foreigners or linguists, however, the tendency of geminating the following consonant is marked by a superscript as in .

Historically, morpheme-boundary gemination is the result of regressive assimilation. The preceding word originally ended in or . For instance, the modern Finnish word for &#x27;boat&#x27; used to be (a form still existing in the closely related Karelian language). At some point in time, these and s were assimilated by the initial consonant of a following word, e.g. &#x27; (&#x27;the boat is moving&#x27;). Here we get the modern Finnish form (orthographically ), even though the independent form has no sign of the old final consonant .

In many Finnish dialects, including that of Helsinki, the gemination at morpheme boundaries has become more widespread due to the loss of additional final consonants, which appear only as gemination of the following consonant, cf. French liaison. For example, the standard word for &#x27;now&#x27; has lost its and become in Helsinki speech. However, + (&#x27;now it [does something]&#x27;) is pronounced and not (although the latter would be permissible in the dialect of Turku).

Similar remnants of a lost word-final can be seen in dialects, where e.g. the genitive form of the first singular pronoun is regularly (standard language ): + + → (&#x27;it is mine&#x27;). Preceding an approximant, the is completely assimilated: (&#x27;my wife&#x27;). Preceding a vowel, however, the however appears in a different form: + → or even (&#x27;my own&#x27;).

<text>The Finnish language is spoken by the majority of the population in Finland and by ethnic Finns elsewhere. Unlike the Indo-European languages spoken in neighbouring countries, such as Swedish and Norwegian, which are North Germanic languages, or Russian, which is a Slavic language, Finnish is a Uralic language of the Finnic languages group. Typologically, Finnish is agglutinative. As in some other Uralic languages, Finnish has vowel harmony, and like other Finnic languages, it has consonant gradation.

==Pronouns==
The pronouns are inflected in the Finnish language much in the same way that their referent nouns are.

===Personal pronouns===
Personal pronouns are used to refer to human beings only. Personal pronouns in Standard Finnish in the nominative case are listed in the following table:

Because Finnish verbs are inflected for person and number, in Finnish standard language subject pronouns are not required, and the first and second-person pronouns are usually omitted except when used for emphasis. In the third person, however, the pronoun is required: &#x27;(s)he goes&#x27;. In spoken Finnish, all pronouns are generally used, even without emphatic meaning.

In colloquial Finnish, the inanimate pronouns and are very commonly used in place of the singular and plural animate third-person pronouns, respectively. Use of and is mostly restricted to writing and formal or markedly polite speech as this clear distinction has never occurred naturally in the language. Do note the animals are marked as less animate and are therefore never referred to as or . and are usually replaced with colloquial forms. The most common variants are and , though, in some dialects and , and or and are used. On the other hand, , and lack reduced colloquial forms, so variants such as , , and of some eastern varieties are dialectal. Some common verbs, such as &quot;to be&quot; and &quot;to come&quot;, exhibit similarly reduced colloquial forms:

The second-person plural can be used as a polite form when addressing one person, as in some Indo-European languages. However, this usage is diminishing in Finnish society.

===Demonstrative pronouns===
The demonstratives are used of non-human animate entities and inanimate objects. However, and is often used to refer to humans in colloquial Finnish. (This usage is quite correct in a demonstrative sense, i.e. when qualified by the relative pronoun , and in fact, it is hypercorrect to replace a demonstrative or with or just because the antecedent is human.) Furthermore, the demonstratives are used to refer to group nouns and the number of the pronoun must correlate with the number of its referent.

===Interrogative pronouns===

 is now archaic, but its inflected forms are used instead of those of : instead of (&quot;whom&quot;): &quot;Whom do you love?&quot;

===Relative pronouns===

===Reciprocal pronouns===

===Reflexive pronouns===

===Indefinite pronouns===
A large group that entails all of the pronouns that do not fall into any of the categories above. Notice that there are no negative pronouns, such as &quot;nobody&quot;; rather, the positive pronoun is negated with the negative verb . No double negatives are possible.

Each pronoun declines. However, the endings and are clitics, and case endings are placed before them, e.g. &quot;any&quot;, &quot;from any&quot;. There are irregular nominatives. As indicated, is an irregular nominative; the regular root is with , e.g. &quot;(not) anyone&quot;, &quot;from (not) anyone&quot;.

English lacks a direct equivalent to the pronoun ; it would be &quot;that-th&quot;, or &quot;which-th&quot; for questions. For example, &quot;The reward depends on &quot;as-which-th&quot; one comes to the finish&quot;, or explicitly &quot;The reward depends on in which position one comes to the finish&quot;. It would be difficult to translate the question , but, although far from proper English, the question &quot;How manyeth&quot; may give an English-speaking person an idea of the meaning.

Some indefinite adjectives are often perceived as indefinite pronouns. These include:

==Nouns==
Finnish does not have grammatical gender, not even in personal pronouns: is &#x27;he&#x27;, &#x27;she&#x27; or &#x27;they&#x27; (singular) depending on the referent. There are no articles, neither definite nor indefinite.

===Possessive suffixes===

===Cases===

Finnish has fifteen noun cases: four grammatical cases, six locative cases, two essive cases (three in some Eastern dialects), and three marginal cases. 
Some notes about the cases listed in the table above:
* The locative cases are also used for grammatical function, such as benefactive, dative (often in the allative), and other functions.
* There is historically some difference of opinion as to the character and indeed existence (for most words) of the accusative case in modern Finnish. The recent, authoritative grammar &quot;Iso suomen kielioppi&quot; takes the position that only the personal pronouns and the personal interrogative pronoun have a true accusative case which is distinguished by the suffix . For nouns, adjectives, numerals, and other pronouns, there is no accusative case; instead, these words take the nominative or genitive in object positions (where they do not take the partitive). This differs from the more traditional view, to which many learners&#x27; grammars still adhere, that there are accusative forms that appear identical to the nominative or genitive. This traditional view is based on known diachronic phonological changes in the language.
* Marginal cases are mostly used in writing, or in the case of the instructive, in fixed expressions such as &quot;Vedä pyyhe molemmin käsin&quot; (&#x27;Pull the paper towel using both hands&#x27;) 
** A noun in the comitative case is always followed by a possessive suffix. However, as is typical in Finnish, an adjective does not take possessive suffixes: &quot;A man with his luxurious house(s)&quot;, with comitative on both the adjective and noun, but the third person possessive suffix on the noun only.
* Regarding the illative suffix : &quot;V&quot; stands in for a preceding (short) vowel: yields , but yields .

==== Relationship between locative cases ====
As in other Uralic languages, locative cases in Finnish can be classified according to three criteria: the spatial position (interior or surface), the motion status (stationary or moving), and within the latter, the direction of the movement (approaching or departing). The classification captures a morphophonological pattern that distinguishes interior and surface spatial position; long consonants ( in / and in / ) express stationary motion, whereas a expresses &quot;movement from&quot;. The table below shows these relationships schematically: 
===Plurals===
Finnish nominal plurals are often marked by (though is a suppletive variant in the nominative and accusative, as is common in Uralic languages). Singular and plural numbers cross-cut the distinctions in grammatical cases, and several number/case combinations have somewhat idiosyncratic uses. Several of these deserve special mention.

====Nominative/accusative plural====
The nominative plural is used for definite count nouns that are subjects, while the plural object of a telic verb bears the accusative plural. The syncretic suffix that covers both uses is . This suffix can only appear in the word-final position; i.e. it is omitted when a possessive suffix is present.

====Numerals====

When a noun is modified by a numeral not equal to one, and the numeral is in the nominative singular, the noun bears the partitive singular. Otherwise, the noun and the numeral agree with each other in number and case.

====Inflected plural====
This uses the stem of the partitive plural inflected with the same set of endings as for singular nouns. The suffix is , and it suppresses long vowels; it may only appear before another suffix.

As a combined example of plurals

====Inflection of pronouns====

The personal pronouns are inflected in the same way as nouns, and can be found in most of the same cases as nouns. For example:

===Noun/adjective stem types===
The stem of a word is the part to which inflectional endings are affixed. For most noun and adjective types, the nominative case is identical to the basic stem (the nominative is unmarked).

====Vowel stems====
A word with a vowel stem is one that ends in a vowel in the nominative, and retains a final vowel in all forms. The stem vowel can however change in certain inflected forms:

The change of original (pre-Proto-Finnic) final &quot;*e&quot; to means that the stem vowel of a word ending in cannot be determined from the nominative alone; one of the inflected forms must be consulted. However, most old inherited words ending in decline as &quot;e&quot;-stems (or consonants stems, see below), while modern loans, where frequently is added for phonotactic reasons (as in the case of ), always decline as &quot;i&quot;-stems.

====Consonant stems====
A word with a consonant stem is one where case suffixes can in some cases be affixed directly after the last consonant for at least some forms. Words with consonant stems come in three broad classes.

The first class of consonant-stem words largely resemble &quot;e&quot;-stems, but allow elision of the stem vowel in the partitive singular, and for certain words, plural genitive. In the later case, this involves a special allomorph , employing the plural marker rather than /.

The final consonant in words of this class must be one of &quot;h, l, m, n, r, s, t&quot;. Other remarks for &quot;e&quot;-stem words still apply.

Words of this type may have somewhat irregular declension due to additional historical changes:

For some words of this type, modern Finnish displays a tendency of development from consonant-stems to e-stems. For example, the partitive singular of the word &quot;bird cherry&quot; may be (consonant stem) or (vowel stem).

Another class of consonant-stem words end in a consonant even in the nominative; if a stem vowel is required for phonotactic reasons, &quot;e&quot; again appears. In Modern Finnish, only dental and alveolar consonants /l n r s t/) occur word-finally but previously words ending in /ʃ~ʂ h k m/ were possible as well.

=====Nouns ending in &quot;-s&quot;=====
Vocalization or lenition is found in addition to any possible consonant gradation, e.g. (nominative) ~ (genitive), or ~ . The illatives are marked thus: , .

=====&quot;-nen&quot; nouns=====
This is a very large class of words which includes common nouns (for example &#x27;woman&#x27;), many proper names, and many common adjectives. Adding to a noun is a very productive mechanism for creating adjectives ( &#x27;dirt, filth&#x27; → &#x27;dirty&#x27;; &#x27;joy&#x27; → &#x27;merry, happy&#x27;; &#x27;plastic&#x27; → &#x27;made of plastic&#x27;/&#x27;plastic-like&#x27; ). It can also function as a diminutive ending.

The form behaves as if it ended in , with the exception of the nominative, where it is . Thus, the stem for these words removes the and adds after which the inflectional ending is added:

Here are some of the diminutive forms that are in use:

A special class of Finnish nouns in -nen are surnames. Some of these are very old and often their original meaning is not readily apparent to a modern speaker. Many were later coined on the -nen pattern and these often have the suffix added to a word meaning a natural feature. Some representative examples are:

The suffix also occurs in place-names. Many place-names ending with assume a plural form when inflected. For instance, the illative of is instead of singular .

=====&quot;-e&quot; nouns=====
Most present-day -e nouns derive from older *-eh (&lt;*-eś) or *-ek stems in which the consonant has been lost, which also explains why words in this class behave differently from the -i/-e class, which underwent word-final vowel raising in the nominative singular, such as *&quot;saare &gt; &quot;saari (&#x27;island&#x27;) but &quot;saaren&quot;, &quot;saarella, etc.&quot; (&#x27;island&#x27;s&#x27;, &#x27;on the island&#x27;). Class -e word-final consonant does not survive in any form of the paradigm, although the existence of a consonant is still seen in that the nominative singular form (citation form) shows weak gradation, and strong grade vowel stem to which most case suffixes are applied. 

E-stem words have an additional e in the inflected stem: &#x27;family&#x27; but , so , , etc.; which represents the historical loss of a medial consonant. 

However, in some dialects, the much older *-ś&gt; stems have shifted to instead, for instance in Pohjanmaa dialect &gt; &quot;venes&quot; for standard &quot;vene&quot; (&#x27;boat&#x27;) 

The partitive stem behaves yet differently due to a loss of word-medial -e- in some contexts before the change from *-k- to *-h- took place, in which the consonant has been assimilated to a before it occurred in the context for being lost. Other case endings are suffixed to the strong grade/vowel stem.

More of this phenomenon is discussed in Finnish Phonology: Sandhi.

==Adjectives==
Adjectives in Finnish are inflected in exactly the same way as nouns, and an adjective must agree in number and case with the noun it is modifying.

For example, here are some adjectives:

And here are some examples of adjectives inflected to agree with nouns:

Notice that the adjectives undergo the same sorts of stem changes when they are inflected as nouns do.

===Comparative formation===
The comparative of the adjective is formed by adding to the inflecting stem. For example:

Since the comparative adjective is still an adjective, it must be inflected to agree with the noun it modifies. To make the inflecting stem of the comparative, the ending loses its final &quot;i&quot;. If the syllable context calls for a weak consonant, the becomes . Then is added before the actual case ending (or in plural). This should become clear with a few examples:

===Superlative formation===
The superlative of the adjective is formed by adding to the inflecting stem. For example:

Note that because the superlative marker vowel is , the same kind of changes can occur with vowel stems as happen in verb imperfects, and noun inflecting plurals:

Since the superlative adjective is still an adjective, it must be inflected to agree with the noun it modifies. The becomes either or (plural or ) depending on whether the syllable context calls for a weak or strong consonant. Here are the examples:

====Irregular forms====
The most important irregular form is:

The form &quot;good&quot; is not found in standard Finnish, but can be found in the Southern Ostrobothnian dialect.

Notice also:

There are a small number of other irregular comparative and superlative forms, such as:

Where the inflecting stem is but the superlative is = &#x27;newest&#x27;.

==Adpositions==
Postpositions are more common in Finnish than prepositions. Both postpositions and prepositions can be combined with either a noun or a possessive suffix to form a postpositional phrase.

===Postpositions===
Postpositions indicate place, time, cause, consequence or relation. In postpositional phrases the noun is usually in genitive:

The noun (or pronoun) can be omitted when there is a possessive suffix:

As with verbs, the pronoun cannot be omitted in the third person (singular or plural):
: &quot;I was with you&quot;
:but &quot;I was with him/her&quot;

: &quot;I will come with you (plural or polite)&quot;
:but &quot;I will come with them&quot;

===Prepositions===
There are few important prepositions in Finnish. In prepositional phrases the noun is always in the partitive:

Some postpositions can also be used as prepositions:

Using postpositions as prepositions is not strictly incorrect and occurs in poetry, as in, for example, the song &quot;&quot; &quot;under a maple tree&quot;, instead the usual .

==Verbs==
Finnish verbs are usually divided into seven groups depending on the stem type. All seven types have the same set of endings, but the stems undergo (slightly) different changes when inflected.

There are very few irregular verbs in Finnish. In fact, only = &#x27;to be&#x27; has two irregular forms &quot;is&quot; and &quot;are ()&quot;; other forms follow from the stem ; e.g. ← &quot;you are&quot;, ← &quot;let it be&quot;. A handful of verbs, including &quot;to see&quot;, &quot;to do/make&quot;, and &quot;to run&quot; have rare consonant mutation patterns which are not derivable from the infinitive. In spoken Finnish, some frequently used verbs () have irregular stems (, instead of (&quot;go, come, be, put&quot;), respectively).

Finnish does not have a separate verb for possession (compare English &quot;to have&quot;). Possession is indicated in other ways, mainly by genitives and existential clauses. For animate possessors, the adessive case is used with , for example = &#x27;the dog has a tail&#x27; – literally &#x27;on the dog is a tail&#x27;, or in English grammar, &quot;There is a tail on the dog&quot;. This is similar to Irish and Welsh forms such as &quot;There is a hunger on me&quot;.

===Tense-aspect forms===
Finnish verbs have present, imperfect, perfect and pluperfect tense-aspect forms.

*Present (nonpast): corresponds to English present and future tense forms. For the latter, a time qualifier may need to be used to avoid ambiguity. The present is formed with using the personal suffixes only. For example, &quot;I take&quot; (from , &quot;to take&quot;).
*Imperfect: actually a preterite, but called &quot;imperfect&quot; for historical reasons; corresponds to English past continuous and past simple, indicating a past action which is complete but might have been a point event, a temporally extended event, or a repeated event. The imperfect is formed with the suffix in addition to the personal suffixes, e.g. &quot;I took&quot;.
*Perfect: corresponds to the English present perfect (&quot;I have eaten&quot;) in most of its usages, but can carry more sense than in English of a past action with present effects. The form uses the verb &quot;to be&quot; in the present tense as an auxiliary verb. Personal suffixes are added to the auxiliary, while the main verb is in the participle form. For example, &quot;I have taken&quot;, where is the auxiliary verb stem, is the personal suffix for &quot;I&quot;, is the stem for the main verb, and is the participle marker.
*Pluperfect: corresponds to the English past perfect (&quot;I had visited&quot;) in its usage. Similarly to perfect, the verb is used in the past tense as an auxiliary verb. For example, &quot;I had taken&quot;.

As stated above, Finnish has no grammatical future tense. To indicate futurity, a Finnish speaker may use forms that are, by some, deprecated as ungrammatical. One is the use of the verb , &#x27;to come&#x27;, as it were as an auxiliary: &#x27;This is going to be a problem&#x27;, cf Swedish . Another, less common and now archaic, is to use the verb , &#x27;to be&#x27;, with the present passive participle of the main verb: &#x27;For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord&#x27; (Luke 1:15).

===Voices===
Finnish has two possible verb voices: active and passive. The active voice corresponds with the active voice of English, but the Finnish passive voice has some important differences from the English passive voice.

====Passive voice====
The so-called Finnish passive is impersonal and unipersonal, that is, it only appears in one form regardless of who is implicitly understood to be the performer of the action. In that respect, it could be described as a &quot;fourth person&quot; since there is no way of connecting the action performed with a particular agent (except for some nonstandard forms; see below). It is called &quot;passive&quot; for historical reasons in imitation of Swedish and Latin grammars, but this term is in fact incorrect because the object of an active sentence remains an object in the equivalent Finnish &quot;passive&quot; sentence, in other words, the Finnish &quot;passive&quot; sentence is in fact active. In languages with true passives, an active sentence&#x27;s object becomes the subject in the equivalent passive sentence. Active: &quot;we will arrest him&quot; =&gt; passive: &quot;he will be arrested&quot;.

Consider the example: &quot;the house will be painted&quot;. The time when the house is being painted could be added: &quot;the house will be painted in November&quot;. The colour and method could be added: &quot;the house will be painted red with a brush&quot;. But nothing can be said about the person who will do the painting; there is no simple way to say &quot;the house will be painted by Jim&quot;. There is a calque, evidently from Swedish, &quot;by the action of&quot;, that can be used to introduce the agent: , approximately &quot;The house will be painted by the action of Jim&quot;. This type of expression is considered prescriptively incorrect, but it may be found wherever direct translations from Swedish, English, etc. are made, especially in legal texts, and has traditionally been a typical feature of Finnish &quot;officialese&quot;. An alternative form, passive + ablative, also a calque from Swedish, was once common but is now archaic.

Notice also that the object is in the form of the accusative that has the same form as the nominative case (which is true of all words except for the personal pronouns). Verbs which govern the partitive case continue to do so in the passive, and where the object of the action is a personal pronoun in the accusative, that goes into its special accusative form: &quot;I/you/(s)he/we/you/they was/were forgotten&quot;. Whether the object of a passive verb should be termed the subject of the clause has been debated, but traditionally Finnish grammars have considered a passive clause to have no subject.

Use of the passive voice is not as common in Finnish as in Germanic languages; sentences in the active voice are preferred, if possible. Confusion may result, as the agent is lost and becomes ambiguous. For instance, a bad translation of the English &quot;the PIN code is asked for by the device when...&quot; into raises the question &quot;who asks?&quot;, whereas (&quot;the device asks for the PIN code when...&quot;) is unambiguous. Nevertheless, this usage of the passive is common in Finnish, particularly in literary and official contexts. Occasionally this leads to extreme cases such as &quot;it is wanted that the municipal board be dismissed&quot;, implying that a popular uprising could be near, when this suggestion could also be made by a political group in the town council consisting of only a few or theoretically (very unlikely because misleading) even a single person.

It can also be said that in the Finnish passive the agent is always human and never mentioned. A sentence such as &#x27;the tree was blown down&#x27; would translate poorly into Finnish if the passive were used, since it would suggest the image of a group of people trying to blow the tree down.

Colloquially, the first-person plural indicative and imperative are replaced by the passive, e.g. (&quot;we&#x27;ll go to our place&quot;) and (&quot;let us go to our place&quot;) are replaced by (see spoken Finnish).

Because of its vagueness about who is performing the action, the passive can also translate the English &quot;one does (something)&quot;, &quot;(something) is generally done&quot;, as in &quot;they say that...&quot;

Formation of the passive is dealt with in the article on Finnish verb conjugation.

=====As first-person plural=====
In modern colloquial Finnish, the passive form of the verb is used instead of the active first-person plural in the indicative and the imperative, to the almost complete exclusion of the standard verb forms. For example, in the indicative, the standard form is &#x27;we are going&#x27;, but the colloquial form is . Without the personal pronoun , the passive alone replaces the first-person plural imperative, as in &#x27;Let&#x27;s go!&#x27;. In colloquial speech, the pronoun cannot be omitted without confusion, unlike when using the standard forms (indicative) and (imperative).

====Zero person====
The so-called &quot;zero person&quot; is a construct in which a verb appears in the third-person singular with no subject, and the identity of the subject must be understood from the context. Typically the implied subject is either the speaker or their interlocutor, or the statement is intended in a general sense. The zero person has some similarity to the English use of the formal subject .

:* &quot;In the sauna, one sweats&quot;
:* &quot;If you arrive in good time, you get a better seat&quot;

===Moods===

====Indicative====
The indicative is the form of the verb used for making statements or asking simple questions. In the verb morphology sections, the mood referred to will be the indicative unless otherwise stated.

====Conditional====
The conditional mood expresses the idea that the action or state expressed by the verb may or may not actually happen. As in English, the Finnish conditional is used in conditional sentences (for example &quot;I would tell you if I knew&quot;) and in polite requests (for example &quot;I would like some coffee&quot;).

In the former case, and unlike in English, the conditional must be used in both halves of the Finnish sentence:

: = *&quot;I would understand if you would speak more slowly&quot;.

The characteristic morphology of the Finnish conditional is &#x27;isi&#x27; inserted between the verb stem and the personal ending. This can result in a closed syllable becoming open and so trigger consonant gradation:

: = &#x27;I know&#x27;, = &#x27;I would know&#x27;.
: = &#x27;I want&#x27;, = &#x27;I would like&#x27;.

Conditional forms exist for both active and passive voices, and for present tense and perfect.

The conditional can be used for added politeness when offering, requesting, or pleading: &#x27;Would you like some coffee?&#x27;; &#x27;May I have that red one?&#x27;; &#x27;I do wish you would tell me&#x27;.

====Imperative====
The imperative mood is used to express commands. In Finnish, there is only one tense form (the present-future). The possible variants of Finnish imperatives are:
* 1st, 2nd or 3rd person
* singular or plural
* active or passive
* positive or negative

=====Active, 2nd-person imperatives=====
These are the most common forms of the imperative: &quot;Do this&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t do that&quot;.

The singular imperative is simply the verb&#x27;s present tense without any personal ending (that is, remove the from the first-person-singular form):

To make this negative, (which is the active imperative singular 2nd person of the negative verb) is placed before the positive form:

To form the plural, add or to the verb&#x27;s stem:

To make this negative, (which is the active imperative present plural 2nd person of the negative verb) is placed before the positive form and the suffix or is added to the verb stem:

Note that 2nd-person-plural imperatives can also be used as polite imperatives when referring to one person.

The Finnish language has no simple equivalent to the English &quot;please&quot;. The Finnish equivalent is to use either or = &#x27;be good&#x27;, but it is generally omitted. Politeness is normally conveyed by tone of voice, facial expression, and use of conditional verbs and partitive nouns. For example, means &quot;could you&quot;, in the polite plural, and is used much like English &quot;Could you...&quot; sentences: &quot;could you help me, please?&quot;

Also, familiar (and not necessarily so polite) expressions can be added to imperatives, e.g. , , . These are hard to translate exactly, but extensively used by Finnish speakers themselves. implies expectation, that is, it has been settled already and requires no discussion; has the which indicates insistence, and means approximated &quot;indeed&quot;.

=====Passive imperatives=====

=====3rd-person imperatives=====
The 3rd-person imperatives behave as if they were jussive; besides being used for commands, they can also be used to express permission. In colloquial language, they are most often used to express disregard to what one might or might not do, and the singular and plural forms are often confused.

=====1st-person-plural imperatives=====

The 1st-person imperative sounds archaic, and a form resembling the passive indicative is often used instead: = &#x27;let&#x27;s go!&#x27;

====Optative====
The optative mood is an archaic or poetic variant of the imperative mood that expresses hopes or wishes. It is not used in normal language. Although it in principle has all forms, it is encountered mainly in the 2nd person singular forms &quot;-:os&quot;/&quot;-:ös&quot; (replacement of /k/ with the gemination of the previous consonant).

Optatives are rare even in original archaic poems, and the forms used to express the optative are different from standard Finnish. An example of a true optative is &quot;ruvetkommas tappelohon&quot; &quot;let&#x27;s go and start fighting&quot;. However, when compiling the Kalevala, Elias Lönnrot tripled the number of optatives, by changing these dialectal forms in the original poems to the standard optative.

====Potential====
The potential mood is used to express that the action or state expressed by the verb is possible but not certain. It is relatively rare in modern Finnish, especially in speech. Most commonly it is used in news reports and in official written proposals in meetings. It has only the present tense and perfect. The potential has no specific counterpart in English, but can be translated by adding &quot;possibly&quot; (or occasionally &quot;probably&quot;) to the verb.

The characteristic morphology of the Finnish potential is , inserted between the verb stem and the personal ending. Before this affix, continuants assimilate progressively ( → ) and stops regressively ( → ). The verb &#x27;to be&#x27; in the potential has the special suppletive form , e.g. the potential of &#x27;has been fetched&#x27; is &#x27;may have been fetched&#x27;.

Potential forms exists for both active and passive voices, and for present tense and perfect:

In some dialects (&#x27;may come&#x27;) is an indicative form verb ( &#x27;comes&#x27;). This is not a potential form, but rather due to secondary gemination.

====Eventive====
No longer used in modern Finnish, the eventive mood is used in the &quot;Kalevala&quot;. It is a combination of the potential and the conditional. It is also used in some dialects of Estonian.

===Infinitives===
Finnish verbs are described as having four, sometimes five infinitives:

====First infinitive====
The first infinitive short form of a verb is the citation form found in dictionaries. It is not unmarked; its overt marking is always the suffix or , though sometimes there are modifications (which may be regarded as stem or ending modifications depending on personal preference).

When the stem is itself a single syllable or is of two or more syllables ending in or , the suffix is or , respectively. (This represents the historically older form of the suffix, from which the has been lost in most environments.)

If the stem ends in one of the consonants , , , then the final consonant is doubled before adding the infinitive or . In the case of a stem ending in the consonant , the infinitive ending gains the consonant , becoming or . (These consonant stems take a linking vowel when forming the present tense, or when forming the imperfect, e.g. &#x27;to wash&#x27;: &#x27;I wash&#x27; : &#x27;I washed&#x27;). Stems ending in , followed by a link vowel in the present or imperfect, drop the from the stem before adding the infinitive marker or .

Some verbs have so called &quot;alternating stems&quot; or multiple stems with weak-strong consonant gradation between them. It depends on the verb if the infinitive is in the strong or weak form. These have long vowel stems in the present/future tense, which already ends with or . These verbs drop the which is present in the present tense stem and replace it with in the first infinitive stem followed by the standard or first infinitive marker. The dropping to weakens a preceding , or so that a weak grade is seen in the first infinitive form. This often creates difficulties for the non-Finn when trying to determine the infinitive (in order to access the translation in a dictionary) when encountering an inflected form. Inflected forms are generally strong except when the stem ending contains a double consonant and there is only a single vowel separating this from the last stem , or .

Some verbs lose elements of their stems when forming the first infinitive. Some verbs stem have contracted endings in the first infinitive. Stems ending / in the present/imperfect drop the and replace it with , and where applicable, trigger the weak grade in the infinitive stem. The contracted infinitive ending / have / verbs take the infinitive stem /. These contracted verbs may also be subject to consonant weakening when forming the infinitive

e.g. &#x27;to mention&#x27; has the longer conjugated stem as in &#x27;I&#x27;ll mention tomorrow that...&#x27;

e.g. &#x27;to flee&#x27; has the longer conjugated stem as in &#x27;we fled from Afghanistan&#x27;

The first infinitive long form is the translative plus a possessive suffix (rare in spoken language).

The first infinitive only has an active form.

====Second infinitive====
The second infinitive is used to express aspects of actions relating to the time when an action takes place or the manner in which an action happens. In equivalent English phrases these time aspects can often be expressed using &quot;when&quot;, &quot;while&quot; or &quot;whilst&quot; and the manner aspects using the word &quot;by&quot; or else the gerund, which is formed by adding &quot;-ing&quot; to English verb to express manner.

It is recognizable by the letter in place of the usual or as the infinitive marker. It is only ever used with one of two case makers; the inessive indicating time or the instructive indicating manner. Finnish phrases using the second infinitive can often be rendered in English using the gerund.

The second infinitive is formed by replacing the final of the first infinitive with then adding the appropriate inflectional ending. If the vowel before the is already an , this becomes (see example from &#x27;to read&#x27;).

The cases in which the second infinitive can appear are:

The inessive form is mostly seen in written forms of language because spoken forms usually express the same idea in longer form using two clauses linked by the word (&quot;when&quot;). The instructive is even rarer and mostly exists nowadays in set phrases (for example = &#x27;in other words&#x27;).

If the person performing the action of the verb is the same as the person in the equivalent relative clause, then the verb uses the appropriate personal possessive suffix on the verb for the person. If the person in the main clause is different from that in the relative clause then this is indicated by with the person in the genitive and the verb is unmarked for person.

====Third infinitive====
This corresponds to the English gerund (&quot;verb + -ing&quot; form), and behaves as a noun in Finnish in that it can be inflected, but only in a limited number of cases. It is used to refer to a particular act or occasion of the verb&#x27;s action.

The third infinitive is formed by taking the verb stem with its consonant in the strong form, then adding followed by the case inflection.

The cases in which the third infinitive can appear are:

A rare and archaic form of the third infinitive which occurs with the verb :

The third infinitive instructive is usually replaced with the first infinitive short form in modern Finnish.

Note that the form without a case ending is called the &#x27;agent participle&#x27; (see #Participles below). The agent participle can also be inflected in all cases, producing forms which look similar to the third infinitive.

====Fourth infinitive====
The fourth infinitive has the stem ending and indicates obligation, but it is quite rare in Finnish today. This is because there are other words like and that can convey this meaning.

For example

Though not an infinitive, a much more common verbal stem ending is the noun construct which gives the name of the activity described by the verb. This is rather similar to the English verbal noun &#x27;-ing&#x27; form, and therefore as a noun, this form can inflect just like any other noun.

====Fifth infinitive====
This is a fairly rare form which has the meaning &#x27;on the point of ...ing / just about to ...&#x27;

===Verb conjugation===
For full details of how verbs are conjugated in Finnish, please refer to the Finnish verb conjugation article.

===Participles===
Finnish verbs have past and present participles, both with passive and active forms, and an &#x27;agent&#x27; participle. Participles can be used in different ways than ordinary adjectives and they can have an object.

====Past passive participle====
This is formed in the same way as the passive perfect or passive past-perfect forms, by taking the passive past form, removing the ending and replacing it with (depending on vowel harmony)

====Past active participle====
Basically this is formed by removing the infinitive ending and adding (depending on vowel harmony) and in some cases , , . For example:

However, depending on the verb&#x27;s stem type, assimilation can occur with the consonant of the stem ending.

In type II verbs, and , , or in the stem ending is assimilated to the consonant in the participle ending (as also happens in formation of the first infinitive, although stem endings take an extra in the first infinitive)

The assimilation causes the final consonant cluster to be strengthened which in turn can weaken a strong cluster if one exists in the stem. See above.

In verbs of types IV, V and VI, the at the end of the stem is assimilated to the :

====Present passive participle====
The present passive participle can be constructed from the past passive form of the verb. The ending of the past passive is replaced with , which can be inflected in the same way as the present active participle. For example:
It is possible to translate this participle in several related ways e.g. &#x27;which must be/is to be said&#x27;, &#x27;which can be said&#x27;, &#x27;which will be said&#x27; or &#x27;which is said&#x27;.
Here are some sentences and phrases further illustrating the formation and use of the present passive participle:
This participle can also be used in other ways. If used with the appropriate third-person singular form of the verb and with the subject in the genitive it can express necessity or obligation.

: &#x27;I must leave&#x27;
: &#x27;They would have to go&#x27;

Inflected in the inessive plural, it can be used in conjunction with the verb &#x27;to be&#x27; to indicate that something can or cannot be done.

: &#x27;Is Pekka available?&#x27;/&#x27;Is Pekka able to be met with?&#x27;

====Present active participle====
This participle is formed simply by finding the 3rd person plural form of the verb and removing -t, and acts as an adjective describing what the object or subject of the sentence is doing, for example:

====Agent participle====
The agent participle is formed in a similar way as the third infinitive (see above), adding -ma or -mä to the verb stem. It allows the property of being a target of an action to be formatted as an adjective-like attribute. Like adjectives, it can be inflected in all cases. For example, &quot;a man-made formation&quot;. The party performing the action is indicated by the use of genitive, or by a possessive suffix. This is reflected in English, too: – &quot;of man&#x27;s making&quot;, or &quot;book of my writing&quot;. For example:
It is not required for the action to be in the past, although the examples above are. Rather, the construction simply specifies the subject, the object and the action, with no reference to time. For an example in the future, consider: &quot;tomorrow, as the instrument you will be using is...&quot;. Here, &quot;that which is used&quot; describes, i.e. is an attribute to &quot;instrument&quot;. (Notice the case agreement between and .) The suffix &quot;your&quot; specifies the person &quot;owning&quot; the action, i.e. who does it, thus is &quot;that which was used by you()&quot;, and is &quot;as that which was used by you&quot;.

It is also possible to give the actor with a pronoun, e.g. &quot;that which was used by you&quot;. In standard language, the pronoun &quot;your&quot; is not necessary, but the possessive suffix is. In inexact spoken usage, this goes vice versa; the possessive suffix is optional, and used typically only for the second-person singular, e.g. .

===Negation of verbs===

====Present indicative====
Verbs are negated by using a negative verb in front of the stem from the present tense (in its &#x27;weak&#x27; consonant form). This verb form used with the negative verb is called a connegative.

Note that the inflection is on the negative verb, not on the main verb, and that the endings are regular apart from the 3rd-person forms.

====Present passive====
The negative is formed from the third-person singular &quot;negative verb&quot; and the present passive with the final removed:

====Imperfect indicative====
The negative is formed from the appropriate part of the negative verb followed by the nominative form (either singular or plural depending on the number of the verb&#x27;s subject) of the active past participle. So for the pattern is:

Note one exception: when the &#x27;te&#x27; 2nd-person plural form is used in an honorific way to address one person, the singular form of the participle is used: = &#x27;you ( polite) did not speak&#x27;.

====Imperfect passive====
The negative is formed from the third-person singular negative verb – &#x27;ei&#x27; – and the nominative singular form of the passive present participle (compare this with the negative of the imperfect indicative):

Note that in the spoken language, this form is used for the first-person plural. In this case, the personal pronoun is obligatory:

==Adverbs==
A very common way of forming adverbs is by adding the ending to the inflecting form of the corresponding adjective:

Adverbs modify verbs, not nouns, therefore they do not inflect. adverbs are not used to modify adjectives (such as to express degree) like adverbs might be in English; the genitive of adjectives is used for this purpose.

===Comparative formation===
The comparative form of the adverb has the ending .

===Superlative formation===
The superlative form of the adverb has the ending .

Because of the , the stem vowel can change, similarly to superlative adjectives, or to avoid runs of three vowels:

===Irregular forms===
There are a number of irregular adverbs, including:

==Numbers==
The ordinary counting numbers (cardinals) from 0 to 10 are given in the table below. Cardinal numbers may be inflected and some of the inflected forms are irregular in form.

(*) sometimes (alternative form) 

In colloquial spoken Finnish, the numerals usually appear in contracted forms.

:11, 12, ... 19
In older Finnish, until about the early 20th Century, the same pattern was used up to one hundred: &#x27;thirty-three&#x27;.

==Sentence structure==

===Word order===
Since Finnish is an inflected language, word order within sentences can be much freer than, for example, English. In English the strong subject–verb–object order typically indicates the function of a noun as either subject or object although some English structures allow this to be reversed. In Finnish sentences, however, the role of the noun is determined not by word order or sentence structure as in English but by case markings which indicate subject and object.

The most usual neutral order, however, is subject–verb–object. But usually what the speaker or writer is talking about is at the head of the sentence.

Here (&#x27;dog&#x27;) is in the nominative form but (&#x27;man&#x27;) is marked as object by the case marked form . This sentence is a bald statement of fact. Changing the word order changes the emphasis slightly but not the fundamental meaning of the sentence.

 here is the word (I) in a case form ending which when used with the verb (to be, expressed here in the form ) expresses ownership. This is because Finnish does not have a verb form equivalent of the English word &#x27;have&#x27;. is not considered the subject.

And finally, a classic example:

Besides the word-order implications of turning a sentence into a question, there are some other circumstances where word-order is important:

===Existential sentences===
These are sentences which introduce a new subject – they often begin with &#x27;there is&#x27; or &#x27;there are&#x27; in English.

The location of the thing whose existence is being stated comes first, followed by its stative verb, followed by the thing itself. Note how this is unlike the normal English equivalent, though English can also use the same order:

===Forming questions===
There are two main ways of forming a question – either using a specific question word, or by adding a suffix to one of the words in a sentence. A question word is placed first in the sentence, and a word with the interrogative suffix is also moved to this position:

=== Forming answers ===
The response to a question will of course depend on the situation, but grammatically the response to a question typically follows the grammatical structure in the question. Thus a question structured in the inessive case (e.g. &#x27;in which town do you live?&#x27;) will have an answer that is also in the inessive (e.g. &#x27;in Espoo&#x27;) unless special rules dictate otherwise. Questions which in English would be answered with &#x27;yes&#x27; or &#x27;no&#x27; replies are usually responded to by repeating the verb in either the affirmative or negative.

The words and are often shown in dictionaries as being equivalent to &#x27;yes&#x27; and &#x27;no&#x27;, but the situation is a little more complicated than that. The typical response to a question which in English is answered &#x27;yes&#x27; or &#x27;no&#x27; is, as we see above, more usually answered by repeating the verb in either an affirmative or negative form in the appropriate person. The word &#x27;kyllä&#x27; is rather a strong affirmation in response to a question and is similar to the word &#x27;niin&#x27; which is an affirmation of a response to a statement of fact or belief. (However, in conversations, may even simply mean that the sentence was heard, not expressing any sort of concurrence. The same problem occurs with the colloquial &quot;yeah&quot;.)

The word is the negative verb form and has to be inflected for person and the verb itself is usually present, though not always.

: &#x27;can you (speak) German?&#x27;
:: (&#x27;no&#x27;; &#x27;I don&#x27;t&#x27;)
or better
:: (&#x27;I can&#x27;t&#x27;)

<doc id="50435" wikidata="Q23077" url="?curid=50435" title="Lancashire">
<text>Lancashire ( , ; abbreviated &quot;Lancs&quot;) is a ceremonial county in North West England. It is bordered by Cumbria to the north, North Yorkshire and West Yorkshire to the east, Greater Manchester and Merseyside to the south, and the Irish Sea to the west. The largest settlement is Preston, and the county town is the city of Lancaster.

The county has an area of and a population of 1,490,300. Preston is located near the centre of the county, which is urbanised and includes the towns of Blackburn and Burnley; the seaside resort of Blackpool lies to the west, and Lancaster is in the north. For local government purposes the ceremonial county of Lancashire comprises the non-metropolitan county of Lancashire, with twelve districts, and two unitary authority areas: Blackburn with Darwen and Blackpool. Lancashire County Council and the two unitary councils collaborate through the Lancashire Combined County Authority. The county historically included northern Greater Manchester and Merseyside, the Furness and Cartmel peninsulas of Cumbria, and part of northern Cheshire, but excluded the eastern part of the Forest of Bowland.

The west of Lancashire contains flat coastal plains: the West Lancashire coastal plain to the south and the Fylde in the centre. The north-western coast is hilly and contains part of Arnside and Silverdale, a national landscape. The east of the county is upland, with the West Pennine Moors in the south-east and the Forest of Bowland in the north-east; Bowland has also been designated a national landscape. The major rivers of the county are, from north to south, the Lune, the Wyre, and the Ribble, which all flow west into the Irish Sea. The highest point in Lancashire is either Gragareth or Green Hill, both approximately high and located in the far north-east of the county.

Lancashire was founded in the 12th century; in the Domesday Book of 1086 much of what would become the county is treated as part of Yorkshire and Cheshire. Until the Early Modern period the county was a comparatively poor backwater, although in 1351 it became a palatine, with a semi-independent judicial system. This changed during the Industrial Revolution, when the county rapidly industrialised; until 1974 it included both Liverpool, a major port, and Manchester, which with its surrounding towns dominated the manufacture of textiles. The Lancashire coalfield was also exploited, with many collieries opening. By 1971 Lancashire had a population of 5,118,405, which made it the most heavily populated county in the United Kingdom after Greater London.

==History==
===Before the county===
During Roman times the area was part of the Brigantes tribal area in the military zone of Roman Britain. The towns of Manchester, Lancaster, Ribchester, Burrow, Elslack and Castleshaw grew around Roman forts. In the centuries after the Roman withdrawal in 410 AD the northern parts of the county probably formed part of the Brythonic kingdom of Rheged, a successor entity to the Brigantes tribe. During the mid-8th century, the area was incorporated into the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Northumbria from the north of the River Ribble and the Kingdom of Mercia from the south, which both became parts of England in the 10th century.

In the &quot;Domesday Book&quot;, land between the Ribble and Mersey were known as &quot;Inter Ripam et Mersam&quot; and included in the returns for Cheshire. Although some historians consider this to mean south Lancashire was then part of Cheshire, it is by no means certain. It is also claimed that the territory to the north formed part of the West Riding of Yorkshire.

===Early history===

The county was established in 1182, and came to be bordered by Cumberland, Westmorland, Yorkshire, and Cheshire. It was divided into the hundreds of Amounderness, Blackburn, Leyland, Lonsdale, Salford and West Derby. Lonsdale was further partitioned into Lonsdale North, the detached part north of the sands of Morecambe Bay including Furness and Cartmel, and Lonsdale South.

===Victorian era to late 20th century===
Since the Victorian era, Lancashire has had multiple reforms of local government. In 1889, the administrative county of Lancashire was created, covering the greater part of the county. Multiple county boroughs were outside the county council control: Barrow-in-Furness, Blackburn, Bolton, Bootle, Burnley, Bury, Liverpool, Manchester, Oldham, Preston, Rochdale, Salford, St. Helens, and Wigan. The area served by the Lord-Lieutenant (termed now a ceremonial county) covered the entirety of the administrative county and the county boroughs. It expanded whenever boroughs annexed areas in neighbouring counties such as Wythenshawe in Manchester south of the River Mersey and from Cheshire, and southern Warrington. It did not cover the western part of Todmorden, where the ancient border between Lancashire and Yorkshire passes through the middle of the town.

During the 20th century, the county became increasingly urban with Warrington (1900), Blackpool (1904) and Southport (1905) becoming county boroughs, with many boundary extensions. The borders around the Manchester area were particularly complicated, with narrow protrusions of the administrative county between the county boroughs – Lees Urban District formed a detached part of the administrative county, between Oldham county borough and the West Riding of Yorkshire. Lancaster, the historic county town, became a city in 1937. 

The administrative county was also the most populous of its type outside London, with a population of 2,280,359 in 1961. By the census of 1971, the population of Lancashire and its county boroughs had reached 5,129,416, making it the most populous geographic county in the UK.

===Post-1974===
On 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, southern parts of administrative Lancashire were transferred to the two newly established metropolitan counties of Merseyside and Greater Manchester.
Widnes and Warrington, which did not form part of either new county but which were cut off from the rest of Lancashire, were transferred to Cheshire. In the north, the new county of Cumbria incorporated the Furness exclave. 

The new ceremonial county of Lancashire also gained land in 1974, as the urban districts of Barnoldswick and Earby, Bowland Rural District, and the parishes of Bracewell and Brogden and Salterforth from Skipton Rural District were transferred from the West Riding of Yorkshire.

One parish, Simonswood, was transferred from the borough of Knowsley in Merseyside to the district of West Lancashire in 1994. In 1998 Blackpool and Blackburn with Darwen became unitary authorities, removing them from the non-metropolitan county but not from the ceremonial county.

As the new boundary changes came into effect on 1 April 1974, a government statement in The Times newspaper stated: “They are administrative areas and will not alter the traditional boundaries of counties”.

==Geography==

===Geology, landscape, and ecology===

The three main rivers in Lancashire are the Ribble, Wyre and Lune, which all drain west to the Irish Sea. The Wyre rises in Bowland and is entirely within Lancashire, while the Ribble and Lune rise in North Yorkshire and Cumbria respectively. Many of Lancashire&#x27;s other rivers are tributaries of the Ribble, including the Calder, Darwen, Douglas, and Hodder. The Irwell, which flows through Manchester, has its source in Lancashire.

To the west of the county are the Fylde coastal plain and West Lancashire coastal plain, which lie north and south of the Ribble Estuary respectively. Apart from the coastal resorts these areas are largely rural and devoted to vegetable crops. Further north is Morecambe Bay. In the northwest corner of the county, straddling the border with Cumbria, is the Arnside and Silverdale National Landscape, characterised by its limestone pavements and home to the Leighton Moss nature reserve.

In the east of the county are upland areas leading to the Pennines. North of the Ribble are Beacon Fell Country Park and the Forest of Bowland, another National Landscape. Much of the lowland in this area is devoted to dairy farming and cheesemaking, whereas the higher ground is more suitable for sheep, and the highest ground is uncultivated moorland. The valleys of the River Ribble and its tributary the Calder form a large gap to the west of the Pennines, overlooked by Pendle Hill. South of the Ribble are the West Pennine Moors and the Forest of Rossendale, where former cotton mill towns are in deep valleys. The Lancashire Coalfield, largely in modern-day Greater Manchester, extended into Merseyside and to Ormskirk, Chorley, Burnley and Colne in Lancashire.

The highest point of the ceremonial county is Gragareth, near Whernside, which reaches a height of 627 m (2,057 ft). Green Hill near Gragareth has also been cited as the &quot;county&quot; top. The highest point in the historic county is Coniston Old Man in the Lake District, at 803 m (2,634 ft).

===Human geography===
The north of the ceremonial county is less densely populated than the south, especially inland. The Fylde coast forms a continuous built-up area from Lytham St Annes to Fleetwood, including Blackpool, and further north is the Lancaster/Morecambe built-up area. The rest of the region is characterised by small towns and villages in the flat farmland surrounding the lower reaches of the Ribble, Wyre, and Lune and the sparsely populated uplands of the Forest of Bowland.

The centre and south-east of Lancashire is relatively urbanised, especially around the major settlements of Preston, Blackburn, and Burnley and near the border with Greater Manchester. The Central Lancashire urban area includes the city of Preston and the towns of Penwortham, Leyland and Chorley. A short distance east, Blackburn and Darwen are the first of several adjacent areas urban areas which stretch east toward West Yorkshire and south into the valleys leading to Greater Manchester, the others being Accrington and Rossendale and Burnley. West Lancashire in the south-west is rural with the exception of Skelmersdale, which forms part of Wigan urban area. 

The North West Green Belt covers a large part of the south and centre of the county, including all of the non-urban areas in the boroughs of West Lancashire and South Ribble and the majority of Chorley. Elsewhere it is less extensive but covers the areas between the major settlements to prevent their convergence both with each other and with the nearby Merseyside and Greater Manchester conurbations. There is a further area of green belt in the north of the county, between Lancaster, Morecambe, and Carnforth.

The cities of Manchester, Salford, Liverpool and the following settlements within the historic county boundaries are currently in the ceremonial counties of West Yorkshire, Cheshire, Merseyside, Greater Manchester and Cumbria:
Boundary changes before 1974 include:
*Todmorden, split between Lancashire and Yorkshire then entirely to West Riding of Yorkshire in 1889
*Mossley, split between Lancashire, Yorkshire and Cheshire then entirely to Lancashire in 1889
*Stalybridge, entirely to Cheshire in 1889
*Areas such as Wythenshawe and Latchford, former county boroughs of Manchester and Warrington both extended south of the Mersey into historic Cheshire
*areas such as Reddish and the Heatons (Heaton Chapel, Heaton Mersey, Heaton Moor and Heaton Norris), former county borough of Stockport extended north into historic Lancashire.

==Governance==
===Local government===

The ceremonial county of Lancashire is divided into fourteen local government districts. 

The twelve districts of Burnley, Chorley, Fylde, Hyndburn, Lancaster, Pendle, Preston, Ribble Valley, Rossendale, South Ribble, West Lancashire, and Wyre are part of the two-tier non-metropolitan county of Lancashire, which is administered by Lancashire County Council and twelve district councils. The county council is based in County Hall in Preston, and has 84 councillors. It has been controlled by the Conservative Party since the 2017 Lancashire County Council elections. 

Blackpool and Blackburn with Darwen are unitary authority areas, meaning their councils combine the functions of a district and county council. They were formed in 1996, before which each district was part of the non-metropolitan county of Lancashire. Both authorities currently have a majority Labour administration.

Lancashire County Council, Blackpool Council, and Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council collaborate through the Lancashire Combined County Authority, which was established in February 2025.
The ceremonial county itself only has a minor administrative function, being the area to which the Lord Lieutenant of Lancashire is appointed; the shrieval county has the same boundaries and is the area to which the High Sheriff of Lancashire is appointed.

===Parliamentary constituencies===
The ceremonial county is divided into sixteen constituencies for the purpose of parliamentary representation.


===Duchy of Lancaster===

The Duchy of Lancaster, the private estate of the sovereign, exercises the right of the Crown in the County Palatine of Lancaster. The most prominent effect of this is that the Duchy administers &quot;bona vacantia&quot; within the County Palatine, receiving the property of persons who die intestate and where the legal ownership cannot be ascertained. The county palatine boundaries remain the same as the historic boundaries, ignoring subsequent local government reforms.

==Economy==
Lancashire in the 19th century was a major centre of economic activity, and hence one of wealth. Activities included coal mining, textile production, particularly that which used cotton, and fishing. Preston Docks, an industrial port is now disused. Lancashire was historically the location of the port of Liverpool while Barrow-in-Furness is famous for shipbuilding.

As of 2013, the largest private sector industry is the defence industry with BAE Systems Military Air Solutions division based in Warton on the Fylde coast. The division operates a manufacturing site in Samlesbury. Other defence firms include BAE Systems Global Combat Systems in Chorley, Ultra Electronics in Fulwood and Rolls-Royce plc in Barnoldswick.

The nuclear power industry has a plant at Springfields, Salwick operated by Westinghouse and Heysham nuclear power station is operated by British Energy. Other major manufacturing firms include Leyland Trucks, a subsidiary of Paccar building the DAF truck range.

===Enterprise zone===
The creation of Lancashire Enterprise Zone was announced in 2011. It was launched in April 2012, based at the airfields owned by BAE Systems in Warton and Samlesbury. Warton Aerodrome covers and Samlesbury Aerodrome is 74 hectares. Development is coordinated by Lancashire Enterprise Partnership, Lancashire County Council and BAE Systems. The first businesses to move into the zone did so in March 2015, at Warton.

In March 2015 the government announced a new enterprise zone would be created at Blackpool Airport, using some airport and adjoining land. Operations at the airport will not be affected.

===Economic output===
This is a chart of trend of regional gross value added of the non-metropolitan county of Lancashire at basic prices published by the Office for National Statistics with figures in millions of British pounds sterling.

==Education==
Lancashire has a mostly comprehensive system with four state grammar schools. Not including sixth form colleges, there are 77 state schools (not including Burnley&#x27;s new schools) and 24 independent schools. The Clitheroe area has secondary modern schools. Sixth form provision is limited at most schools in most districts, with only Fylde and Lancaster districts having mostly sixth forms at schools. The rest depend on FE colleges and sixth form colleges, where they exist. South Ribble has the largest school population and Fylde the smallest (only three schools). Burnley&#x27;s schools have had a new broom and have essentially been knocked down and started again in 2006. There are many Church of England and Catholic faith schools in Lancashire.

Lancashire is home to four universities: Lancaster University, the University of Central Lancashire, Edge Hill University and the Lancaster campus of the University of Cumbria. Seven colleges offer higher education courses.

==Transport==
===Roadways===

The Lancashire economy relies strongly on the M6 motorway which runs from north to south, past Lancaster and Preston. The M55 connects Preston to Blackpool and is 11.5 miles (18.3 km) long. The M65 motorway from Colne, connects Burnley, Accrington, Blackburn to Preston. The M61 from Preston via Chorley and the M66 starting inside the county boundary near Edenfield, provide links between Lancashire and Manchester, and the trans-Pennine M62. The M58 crosses the southernmost part of the county from the M6 near Wigan to Liverpool via Skelmersdale.

Other major roads include the east–west A59 between Liverpool in Merseyside and Skipton in North Yorkshire via Ormskirk, Preston and Clitheroe, and the connecting A565 to Southport; the A56 from Ramsbottom to Padiham via Haslingden and from Colne to Skipton; the A585 from Kirkham to Fleetwood; the A666 from the A59 north of Blackburn to Bolton via Darwen; and the A683 from Heysham to Kirkby Lonsdale via Lancaster.

Several bus companies run bus services in the Lancashire area serving the main towns and villages in the county with some services running to neighbouring areas, Cumbria, Greater Manchester, Merseyside and West Yorkshire. Some of these include: 
* Stagecoach Merseyside &amp; South Lancashire
* Stagecoach Cumbria &amp; North Lancashire
* Stagecoach Manchester 
* Transdev Blazefield
* Preston Bus

===Railways===

The West Coast Main Line provides direct rail links with London, Glasgow and other major cities, with stations at and . East-west connections are carried via the East Lancashire Line between Blackpool and via , Preston, , and Burnley. The Ribble Valley Line runs from to with regular passenger services running as far as via and Blackburn. There are connecting lines from Preston to and Bolton, and from Lancaster to , Heysham and .

===Airways===
Blackpool Airport are no longer operating domestic or international flights, but it is still the home of flying schools, private operators and North West Air Ambulance. Manchester Airport is the main airport in the region. Liverpool John Lennon Airport is nearby, while the closest airport to the Pendle Borough is Leeds Bradford.

There is an operational airfield at Warton near Preston where there is a major assembly and test facility for BAE Systems.

===Waterways===
Heysham offers ferry services to Ireland and the Isle of Man. As part of its industrial past, Lancashire gave rise to an extensive network of canals, which extend into neighbouring counties. These include the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, Lancaster Canal, Sankey Canal, Bridgewater Canal, Rochdale Canal, Ashton Canal and Manchester Ship Canal.

==Demography==

The major settlements in the ceremonial county are concentrated on the Fylde coast (the Blackpool Urban Area), and a number of notable settlements along west to east of the M65: including the city of Preston and towns of Blackburn, Darwen, Accrington, Burnley, Padiham, Brierfield, Nelson and Colne. South of Preston are the towns of Leyland and Chorley (which, with Preston, formed Central Lancashire New Town designated in 1970), as well as Penwortham, Skelmersdale and Ormskirk. 

The north of the county is predominantly rural and sparsely populated, except for the city of Lancaster and the towns of Morecambe and Heysham, the three of which form a large conurbation of almost 100,000 people. Lancashire is home to a significant Asian population, numbering over 70,000 and 6% of the county&#x27;s population, and concentrated largely in the former cotton mill towns in the south east.
==Culture==

=== Symbols ===

The Red Rose of Lancaster is the county flower found on the county&#x27;s heraldic badge and flag. The rose was a symbol of the House of Lancaster, immortalised in the verse &quot;In the battle for England&#x27;s head/York was white, Lancaster red&quot; (referring to the 15th-century Wars of the Roses). 

A flag consisting of a red rose on a gold field was designed by the Friends of Real Lancashire, a pressure group which promotes the historic county, and registered with the Flag Institute, a vexillological charity, in 2008. The flag has been flown from public buildings within the historic county boundaries on Lancashire Day (27 November), including from County Hall in Preston, St Helens Town Hall, the in the parts of the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham which were previously in Lancashire. It has also been flown from the Ministry for Housing, Communities, and Local Government building in London.

An alternative flag consists of a red rose on a white field. This design had already been registered by Montrose in Scotland.

=== Sport ===

==== Cricket ====
Lancashire County Cricket Club has been one of the most successful county cricket teams, particularly in the one-day game. It is home to England cricket team members James Anderson and Jos Buttler. The County Ground, Old Trafford, Trafford, has been the home cricket ground of LCCC since 1864.

Local cricket leagues include the Lancashire League, the Central Lancashire League and the North Lancashire and Cumbria League.

Since 2000, the designated ECB Premier League for Lancashire has been the Liverpool and District Cricket Competition.

====Football====

Football in Lancashire is governed by the Lancashire County Football Association which, like most county football associations, has boundaries that are aligned roughly with the historic counties. The Manchester Football Association and Liverpool County Football Association respectively operate in Greater Manchester and Merseyside.

Lancashire clubs were prominent in the formation of the Football League in 1888, with the league being officially named at a meeting in Manchester. Of the twelve founder members of the league, six were from Lancashire: Accrington, Blackburn Rovers, Bolton Wanderers, Burnley, Everton, and Preston North End.

The Football League is now based in Preston. The National Football Museum was founded at Deepdale, Preston in 2001, but moved to Manchester in 2012.

Seven professional full-time teams were based in Lancashire at the start of the 2024–25 season:

* Championship: Blackburn Rovers, Burnley and Preston North End
* League One: Blackpool
* League Two: Accrington Stanley, Fleetwood Town and Morecambe

The county&#x27;s most prominent football rivalries are the East Lancashire derby between Blackburn Rovers and Burnley, and the West Lancashire derby between Blackpool and Preston North End.

A further nine professional full-time teams lie within the historical borders of Lancashire but outside of the current ceremonial county. These include the Premier League clubs Everton, Liverpool, Manchester City and Manchester United. 

====Rugby league====

Along with Yorkshire and Cumberland, Lancashire is recognised as the heartland of Rugby League. The county has produced many successful top flight clubs such as St. Helens, Wigan, Warrington, Oldham, Salford and Widnes. The county was once the focal point for many of the sport&#x27;s professional competitions including the Lancashire League competition which ran from 1895 to 1970, and the Lancashire County Cup which ran until 1993. Rugby League has also seen a representative fixture between Lancashire and Yorkshire contested 89 times since its inception in 1895. In recent times there were several rugby league teams that are based within the ceremonial county which include Blackpool Panthers, East Lancashire Lions, and Blackpool Sea Eagles.

====Archery====
There are many archery clubs located within Lancashire. In 2004 Lancashire took the winning title at the Inter-counties championships from Yorkshire who had held it for 7 years.

====Wrestling====
Lancashire has a long history of wrestling, developing its own style called Lancashire wrestling, with many clubs that over the years have produced many renowned wrestlers. Some of these have crossed over into the mainstream world of professional wrestling; including multiple Catch wrestling champion Steve Wright father of Alex Wright, Billy Riley the founder of Wigan&#x27;s catch-wrestling gym, &#x27;The Snake Pit&#x27;, Billy Robinson, Davey Boy Smith, William Regal, and the Dynamite Kid.

===Music===
====Folk music====
Lancashire has a long and highly productive tradition of music making. In the early modern era the county shared in the national tradition of balladry, including perhaps the finest border ballad, &quot;The Ballad of Chevy Chase&quot;, thought to have been composed by the Lancashire-born minstrel Richard Sheale. The county was also a common location for folk songs, including &quot;The Lancashire Miller&quot;, &quot;Warrington Ale&quot; and &quot;The soldier&#x27;s farewell to Manchester&quot;, while Liverpool, as a major seaport, was the subject of many sea shanties, including &quot;The Leaving of Liverpool&quot; and &quot;Maggie May&quot;, beside several local Wassailing songs. In the Industrial Revolution changing social and economic patterns helped create new traditions and styles of folk song, often linked to migration and patterns of work. These included processional dances, often associated with rushbearing or the Wakes Week festivities, and types of step dance, most famously clog dancing.

A local pioneer of folk song collection in the first half of the 19th century was Shakespearean scholar James Orchard Halliwell, but it was not until the second folk revival in the 20th century that the full range of song from the county, including industrial folk song, began to gain attention. The county produced one of the major figures of the revival in Ewan MacColl, but also a local champion in Harry Boardman, who from 1965 onwards probably did more than anyone to popularise and record the folk song of the county. Perhaps the most influential folk artists to emerge from the region in the late 20th century were Liverpool folk group the Spinners, and from Manchester folk troubadour Roy Harper and musician, comedian and broadcaster Mike Harding. The region is home to numerous folk clubs, many of them catering to Irish and Scottish folk music. Regular folk festivals include the Fylde Folk Festival at Fleetwood.

====Classical music====
Lancashire had a lively culture of choral and classical music, with very large numbers of local church choirs from the 17th century, leading to the foundation of local choral societies from the mid-18th century, often particularly focused on performances of the music of Handel and his contemporaries. It also played a major part in the development of brass bands which emerged in the county, particularly in the textile and coalfield areas, in the 19th century. The first open competition for brass bands was held at Manchester in 1853, and continued annually until the 1980s. 

The vibrant brass band culture of the area made an important contribution to the foundation and staffing of the Hallé Orchestra from 1857, the oldest extant professional orchestra in the United Kingdom. The same local musical tradition produced eminent figures such as Sir William Walton (1902–88), son of an Oldham choirmaster and music teacher, Sir Thomas Beecham (1879–1961), born in St. Helens, who began his career by conducting local orchestras and Alan Rawsthorne (1905–71) born in Haslingden. The conductor David Atherton, co-founder of the London Sinfonietta, was born in Blackpool in 1944. Lancashire also produced more populist figures, such as early musical theatre composer Leslie Stuart (1863–1928), born in Southport, who began his musical career as organist of Salford Cathedral.

More recent Lancashire-born composers include Hugh Wood (1932– Parbold), Sir Peter Maxwell Davies (1934–2016, Salford), Sir Harrison Birtwistle (1934–2022, Accrington), Gordon Crosse (1937–, Bury), John McCabe (1939–2015, Huyton), Roger Smalley (1943–2015, Swinton), Nigel Osborne (1948–, Manchester), Steve Martland (1954–2013, Liverpool), Simon Holt (1958–, Bolton) and Philip Cashian (1963–, Manchester).
The Royal Manchester College of Music was founded in 1893 to provide a northern counterpart to the London musical colleges. It merged with the Northern College of Music (formed in 1920) to form the Royal Northern College of Music in 1972.

====Popular music====

Liverpool, both during its time in Lancashire and after being moved to the new county of Merseyside, has produced a number of successful musicians. This includes pop stars such as Frankie Vaughan and Lita Roza, as well as rock stars such as Billy Fury, who is considered to be one of the most successful British rock and roll stars of all time. Many Lancashire towns had vibrant skiffle scenes in the late 1950s, out of which a culture of beat groups emerged by the early 1960s, particularly around Liverpool and Manchester. It has been estimated that there were at least 350 bands—including the Beatles—active in and around Liverpool during this era, playing ballrooms, concert halls, and clubs. A number of Liverpool performers followed the Beatles into the charts, including Gerry &amp; the Pacemakers, the Searchers, and Cilla Black.

The first musicians to break through in the UK who were not from Liverpool or managed by Beatles manager Brian Epstein were Manchester&#x27;s Freddie and the Dreamers, with Herman&#x27;s Hermits and the Hollies also hailing from Manchester. The Beatles led a movement by various beat groups from the region which culminated in the British Invasion of the US, which in turn made a major contribution to the development of modern rock music. After the decline of beat groups in the late 1960s, the centre of rock culture shifted to London, and there were relatively few Lancashire bands who achieved national prominence until the growth of a disco scene and the punk rock revolution in the mid-and-late 1970s.

The towns of Accrington, Burnley, Chorley, Clitheroe, Colne, Lytham St Annes, Morecambe, Nelson, Ormskirk and Skelmersdale as well as the cities of Lancaster and Preston are referenced in the 1991 song, &quot;It&#x27;s Grim Up North&quot; by the band the KLF.

<text>Year 898 ([[Roman numerals|Decorative]]) was a common year starting on Sunday of the Julian calendar.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===
==== Europe ====
* January 1 – King Odo I (or Eudes) dies at La Fère (Northern France) after a 10-year reign. His rival, the 18-year-old Charles the Simple in Laon, gains sovereignty and becomes ruler (with no real authority) of the West Frankish Kingdom. This puts an end to five years of civil war between the Frankish nobles.
* Summer – Adalbert II, margrave of Tuscany, revolts (pushed by his wife Bertha) against his cousin, Emperor Lambert II. The Tuscan army proceeds against the Lombard capital of Pavia. Lambert with his forces at Marengo defeats Adalbert at Borgo San Donnino, taking him, as a prisoner, to Pavia.
* October 15 – Lambert II dies from falling off his horse while hunting — or is killed (possibly assassinated by supporters of Maginulf of Milan). After the death of Lambert, his rival Berengar I gains recognition as king of Italy. He releases Adalbert II and receives homage from the Italian nobles.

=== By place ===

==== Europe ====
* Battle of Danevirke: Emperor Otto II defeats the rebel forces of King Harald I, who has invaded Nordalbingia (modern-day Holstein), to shake off imperial overlordship. Otto&#x27;s armies swiftly subdue the Danes, consolidating the frontier between Scandinavia and Northern Germany. Meanwhile, Henry II begins a rebellion against his cousin Otto. He forges alliances with Bavarian and Saxon nobles.

* The Qarmatians are defeated north of Cairo by Fatimid forces under General Jawhar al-Siqilli. He consolidates Fatimid rule and sends a legation to the Christian land of Nubia to secure the southern border of Egypt. Arab traders introduce Islam to the population, which gradually supplants Christianity.
* An offensive, by the Spain-based Caliphate of Córdoba brings the Maghrebi Idrisid Dynasty to an end. Caliph Al-Hakam II maintains the supremacy of the caliphate over the kingdoms of Navarra, Castile and León.

<text>The Gang of Four () was a Maoist political faction composed of four Chinese Communist Party (CCP) officials. They came to prominence during the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976) and were later charged with a series of treasonous crimes due to their responsibility for the excesses and failures in the Cultural Revolution. The gang&#x27;s leading figure was Jiang Qing (Mao Zedong&#x27;s last wife). The other members were Zhang Chunqiao, Yao Wenyuan, and Wang Hongwen.

The Gang of Four controlled the power organs of the CCP through the later stages of the Cultural Revolution, although it remains unclear which major decisions were made by Mao Zedong and carried out by the Gang, and which were the result of the Gang of Four&#x27;s own planning.

Their fall did not amount to a rejection of the Cultural Revolution as such; it was organized by the new leader, Premier Hua Guofeng, and others who had risen during that period. Significant repudiation of the entire process of change came later, with the return of Deng Xiaoping at the 11th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party and Hua&#x27;s gradual loss of authority.

==Formation==
The group was led by Jiang Qing, and consisted of three of her close associates, Zhang Chunqiao, Yao Wenyuan, and Wang Hongwen. Two other men who were already dead in 1976, Kang Sheng and Xie Fuzhi, were named as having been part of the &quot;Gang&quot;. Chen Boda and Mao Yuanxin, the latter being Mao&#x27;s nephew, were also considered some of the Gang&#x27;s closer associates.

Most Western accounts consider that the actual leadership of the Cultural Revolution consisted of a wider group, referring predominantly to the members of the Central Cultural Revolution Group. Most prominent was Lin Biao, until his purported defection from China and death in a plane crash in 1971. Chen Boda is often classed as a member of Lin&#x27;s faction rather than Jiang Qing&#x27;s.

==Role==
At the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, on November 10, 1965, Yao Wenyuan, in one of his most famous pieces of writing, published an article in &quot;Wenhuibao&quot; criticizing the play &quot;Hai Rui Dismissed from Office&quot;. The article argued that the opera was actually a sympathetic portrayal of the reformist efforts of the military hero Peng Dehuai and thus an attack on Chairman Mao&#x27;s Great Leap Forward. Mao subsequently purged Peng from power. The article is cited as the spark that launched the Cultural Revolution.

Jiang Qing staged revolutionary operas during the Cultural Revolution and met with the Red Guards.

The removal of this group from power is sometimes considered to have marked the end of the Cultural Revolution, which had been launched by Mao in 1966 as part of his power struggle with leaders such as Liu Shaoqi, Deng Xiaoping and Peng Zhen. Mao placed his wife Jiang Qing, a former film actress who before 1966 had not taken a public political role, in charge of the country&#x27;s cultural apparatus. Zhang, Yao and Wang were party leaders in Shanghai who had played leading roles in securing that city for Mao during the Cultural Revolution.

Around the time of the death of Lin Biao in 1971, the Cultural Revolution began to lose momentum. The new commanders of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army demanded that order be restored in light of the dangerous situation along the border with the Soviet Union (see Sino-Soviet split). Premier Zhou Enlai, who had accepted the Cultural Revolution, but never fully supported it, regained his authority, and used it to bring Deng Xiaoping back into the Party leadership at the 10th Party Congress in 1973. Liu Shaoqi had meanwhile died in prison in 1969.

Near the end of Mao&#x27;s life, a power struggle occurred between the Gang of Four and the alliance of Deng Xiaoping, Zhou Enlai, and Ye Jianying.

==Downfall==

Zhou Enlai died in January 1976, and, in the subsequent months, a power struggle occurred in the top echelons of the party. The reformist Deng was named acting premier, while the Gang of Four began using their newspapers to criticize Deng and to mobilize their urban militia groups. Much of the military and party security remained under the control of the party elders of the Central Committee, who generally took a cautious role in mediating between the reformist Deng and the radical Gang of Four. They agreed to the removal of Deng from office after the April Tiananmen Incident but took steps to ensure that Deng and his allies would not be personally harmed in the process.

On September 9, Chairman Mao died. For the next few weeks the Gang of Four retained control over the government media, and many articles appeared on the theme of &quot;principles laid down&quot; (or &quot;established&quot;) by Mao near the end of his life. (The words &quot;principles laid down&quot; were themselves supposedly a quotation from Mao, but their canonical status was in dispute.) Urban militia units commanded by supporters of the radical group were placed on a heightened state of readiness.

Premier Hua Guofeng attacked the radicals&#x27; media line at a Politburo meeting in late September; but Jiang Qing emphatically disagreed with Hua, and she insisted that she be named as the new party chairman. The meeting ended inconclusively. On October 4 the radical group warned, via an article in the &quot;Guangming Daily&quot;, that any revisionist who interfered with the established principles would &quot;come to no good end&quot;.

The radicals hoped that the key military leaders Wang Dongxing and Chen Xilian would support them, but instead, Hua won the Army over to his side. On 6 October 1976, Hua had the four leading radicals and a number of their lesser associates arrested. Han Suyin gave a detailed account of their overthrow:

According to historian Immanuel C.Y. Hsü, the operation was not completely bloodless – Wang Hongwen killed two of the guards trying to capture him and was wounded himself before being subdued.

Beginning on 21 October, nationwide denunciations of the Gang began, which culminated in the December release of files related to the Gang&#x27;s alleged crimes to the public. The party issued a denunciation of the Gang of Four as &quot;left in form, right in essence&quot;. Government media blamed the Gang of Four and Lin Biao for the excesses of the Cultural Revolution. Celebrations were prominent and not limited to the streets of Beijing and other major cities. During the nationwide &quot;Movement of Exposition, Criticism and Uncovering (揭批查运动)&quot; millions of formerly &quot;rebel faction&quot; red guards were publicly criticized as they were thought to be related to the Gang of Four.

==Aftermath==
Immediately after the arrests, Premier Hua Guofeng, Marshal Ye Jianying, and economic czars Chen Yun and Li Xiannian formed the core of the next party leadership. These four, together with the rehabilitated Deng Xiaoping and Wang Dongxing, were elected party Vice Chairmen at the August 1977 National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party. At the politburo level, the membership of all four living marshals, seven other generals and at least five others with close military ties reflected the deep concern for national stability.

==Trial==

The Gang of Four trials were part of the communist party&#x27;s effort to establish an institutionalized justice system. The trials were highly visible to the Chinese public thanks to the daily television broadcasts of trial sessions and wide circulation of documentary films about the trials.

In late 1980, the four deposed leaders were subjected to a trial by the Supreme People&#x27;s Court of China with Jiang Hua presiding; in January 1981, they were convicted of anti-party activities. During the trial, Jiang Qing in particular was extremely defiant, protesting loudly and bursting into tears at some points. She was the only member of the Gang of Four to argue on her own behalf. The defence&#x27;s argument was that she obeyed the orders of Chairman Mao Zedong at all times. Zhang Chunqiao refused to admit any wrongdoing. Yao Wenyuan and Wang Hongwen expressed repentance and confessed their alleged crimes.

The prosecution separated political errors from actual crimes. Among the latter were the usurpation of state power and party leadership; the persecution of some 750,000 people, 34,375 of whom died during the period 1966–1976. The official records of the trial have not yet been released.

Audience members who attended the opening of the trial included selected people&#x27;s representatives from each province and autonomous region, as well as victims&#x27; families including the widows of Liu Shaoqi, He Long, and Luo Ruiqing.

Jiang Qing and Zhang Chunqiao received death sentences that were later commuted to life imprisonment, while Wang Hongwen and Yao Wenyuan were given life and twenty years in prison, respectively. All members of the Gang of Four have since died; Jiang Qing committed suicide in 1991, Wang Hongwen died in 1992, and Yao Wenyuan and Zhang Chunqiao died in 2005, having been released from prison in 1996 and 1998, respectively.

Supporters of the Gang of Four, including Chen Boda and Mao Yuanxin, were also sentenced.

== Use of the term as a historical analogy ==

=== &quot;Little Gang of Four&quot; ===
In the struggle between Hua Guofeng&#x27;s and Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s followers, a new term emerged, pointing to Hua&#x27;s four closest collaborators, Wang Dongxing, Wu De, Ji Dengkui and Chen Xilian. In 1980, they were charged with &quot;grave errors&quot; in the struggle against the Gang of Four and demoted from the Political Bureau to mere Central Committee membership.

=== Hong Kong&#x27;s &quot;Gangs of Four&quot; ===
In 2013, mainland Chinese state media labelled Anson Chan, Martin Lee, Joseph Zen and Jimmy Lai as &#x27;Hong Kong&#x27;s &quot;Gang of Four&quot;&#x27; due to their alleged foreign connections.

In 2016, the pro-Beijing newspaper Sing Pao Daily News started publishing editorials that criticized Tung Chee-hwa, Leung Chun-ying, Zhang Xiaoming and Jiang Zaizhong as another &#x27;Hong Kong&#x27;s Gang of Four&#x27;. The articles claim that although all of them appeared to be loyal to Beijing, they were actually betraying it and destabilizing Hong Kong for their personal interest, by igniting social and political conflicts, as well as through other mischievous means.

In 2019, Chinese state media labelled Anson Chan, Martin Lee, Jimmy Lai and Albert Ho as yet another &#x27;Gang of Four of Hong Kong&#x27; due to their alleged collusion with foreign forces in relation to the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests. The phrase has in turn been denounced by the four individuals.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Byzantine Empire ====
* Battle of Dorostolon: A Byzantine expeditionary army (possibly 30–40,000 men) attacks the Bulgarian frontier, personally led by Emperor John I. He lays siege to the fortress city of Dorostolon (located on the Lower Danube), and is reinforced by a fleet of 300 ships equipped with &quot;Greek fire&quot;. The Kievan Rus&#x27; and their Bulgarian allies are reduced to extremities by famine. After a 3-month siege, Grand Prince Sviatoslav I agrees to sign a peace treaty with the Byzantines, whereby he renounces his interests towards Bulgarian lands and the city of Chersonesos in Crimea. Sviatoslav is allowed to evacuate his army to Berezan Island, while the Byzantines enter Dorostolon. John renames the city Theodoropolis (named after the reigning Empress Theodora).
* John I returns in triumph to Constantinople. He brings along Boris II, ruler (&quot;tsar&quot;) of the Bulgarian Empire, and his family, together with the contents of the Bulgarian imperial treasury. Boris is given the Byzantine &#x27;court title&#x27; of &quot;magistros&quot; as compensation. The Bulgarian lands in Thrace and Lower Moesia become part of the Byzantine Empire.

==== Europe ====
* Otto I &#x27;the Great&#x27;, Holy Roman Emperor, appoints his imperial secretary Willigis as chancellor (guardian of the emperor&#x27;s seal), an office formerly held by Otto&#x27;s brother, Archbishop Bruno I.

==== Britain ====
* King Cuilén (or Cuilean) is killed by Britons after a 6-year reign. He is succeeded by his nephew Kenneth II, as ruler of Alba (Scotland). He will not be sole king until 977.

==== Middle East ====
* Battle of Alexandretta: The Byzantines defeat a Fatimid force (4,000 men) near Alexandretta (modern Turkey), while the main Fatimid army is besieging the fortress city of Antioch. Coupled with news of an advance against Damascus of the Qarmatians, the Fatimids are forced to lift the siege and withdraw to Egypt.
* First Qarmatian invasion of Egypt: The Qarmatians under al-Hasan al-A&#x27;sam invade Syria, recently conquered by the Fatimid Caliphate, capturing Damascus and Ramla, defeating a major Fatimid army and blockading another in Jaffa. A subsequent invasion of Egypt leads to widespread anti-Fatimid revolts in the Nile Delta, but the delay allows the Fatimid general Jawhar to prepare his defences, leading to the decisive Qarmatian at Ayn Shams on 24 December and the collapse of the invasion.

==== Asia ====
* Emperor Aditya Chola II, co-regent of the Chola dynasty (modern India), is murdered and succeeded by Uttama. Due to his immaturity, Arunmozhi Varman becomes the heir apparent.

<doc id="50444" wikidata="Q17410" url="?curid=50444" title="Zhou Enlai">
<text>Zhou Enlai (; 5 March 18988 January 1976) was a Chinese statesman, diplomat, and revolutionary who served as the inaugural premier of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) from 1949 until his death in 1976, and concurrently as the inaugural Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1949 to 1958. Zhou was a key figure in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and ally of Mao Zedong during the Chinese Civil War, later helping consolidate its control, form its foreign policy, and develop the economy.

Born in Jiangsu, as a student Zhou was involved in the 1919 May Fourth Movement, and in the early 1920s studied in France, where he joined the newly-founded CCP. During the party&#x27;s alliance with the Kuomintang (KMT), he worked in the political department of the Whampoa Military Academy. In 1927, Zhou led the worker uprising which was crushed by the KMT in the Shanghai massacre, after which he helped lead the Nanchang uprising. Zhou worked underground in Shanghai before being transferred to the Jiangxi Soviet, and after the soviet&#x27;s defeat was a member of the party&#x27;s top leadership during its Long March. Zhou came to support Mao Zedong, who became leader of the CCP in 1935. During the Xi&#x27;an Incident in 1936, Zhou successfully persuaded KMT leader Chiang Kai-shek to agree to form a Second United Front against the Japanese. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Zhou was the resident representative of the CCP in Chongqing, and during the renewed civil war from 1946 assisted Mao in commanding military campaigns.

After the establishment of the PRC in 1949, Zhou was appointed head of government and foreign minister. Advocating peaceful coexistence with the West after the Korean War, he participated in the 1954 Geneva Conference and 1955 Bandung Conference and helped orchestrate Richard Nixon&#x27;s 1972 visit to China. He helped devise policies regarding disputes with the United States, Taiwan, the Soviet Union (after 1960), India, Korea, and Vietnam. Zhou survived the purges of other top officials during the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976, and was one of the main driving forces behind affairs of state as Mao dedicated much of his later years to political struggle and ideological work. Zhou&#x27;s attempts at mitigating the Red Guards&#x27; damage and his efforts to protect others from their wrath made him immensely popular in its later stages.

Mao&#x27;s health began to decline in 1971, and Lin Biao fell into disgrace and later died in a plane crash. Amid these events, Zhou was designated as Mao&#x27;s successor in 1973, but struggled internally against the Gang of Four. In 1975, he fell out of the public eye for medical treatment and died one year later. The outpouring of public grief which his death provoked in Beijing turned to anger at the Gang of Four, leading to the 1976 Tiananmen incident. Though Zhou was succeeded by Hua Guofeng as premier and designated successor, after Mao&#x27;s death Zhou&#x27;s ally Deng Xiaoping was able to secure his place as paramount leader by 1978.

==Early life==

=== Youth ===

Zhou Enlai was born on 5 March 1898 in Huai&#x27;an, located in the province of Jiangsu, as the first son of his branch of the Zhou family. The Zhou family was originally from Shaoxing in Zhejiang. During the late Qing dynasty, Shaoxing was famous as the home of families such as Zhou&#x27;s, whose members worked as government clerks generation after generation. To move up the ladder in civil service, the men in these families often had to be transferred, and in the late years of the Qing dynasty, Zhou Enlai&#x27;s branch of the family moved to Huai&#x27;an. Even after the move, however, the family continued to view Shaoxing as its ancestral home.

Zhou&#x27;s grandfather, Zhou Panlong, and his granduncle, Zhou Jun&#x27;ang, were the first members of the family to move to Huai&#x27;an. Panlong apparently passed the provincial examinations, and Zhou Enlai later claimed that Panlong served as magistrate governing Huai&#x27;an county. Zhou&#x27;s father, Zhou Yineng, was the second of Zhou Panlong&#x27;s four sons. Zhou&#x27;s birth mother, surnamed Wan, was the daughter of a prominent Jiangsu official.

Like many others, the economic fortunes of Zhou&#x27;s large family of scholar-officials were decimated by a great economic recession that China suffered in the late 19th century. Zhou Yineng had a reputation for honesty, gentleness, intelligence and concern for others, but was also considered &quot;weak&quot; and &quot;lacking in discipline and determination&quot;. He was unsuccessful in his personal life, and drifted across China doing various occupations, working in Beijing, Shandong, Anhui, Shenyang, Inner Mongolia and Sichuan. Zhou Enlai later remembered his father as being always away from home and generally unable to support his family.

Soon after birth, Zhou Enlai was adopted by his father&#x27;s youngest brother, Zhou Yigan, who was ill with tuberculosis. Apparently, the adoption was arranged because the family feared Yigan would die without an heir. Zhou Yigan died soon after the adoption, and Zhou Enlai was raised by Yigan&#x27;s widow, whose surname was Chen. Madame Chen was also from a scholarly family and received a traditional literary education. According to Zhou&#x27;s own account, he was very close to his adoptive mother and acquired his lasting interest in Chinese literature and opera from her. Madame Chen taught Zhou to read and write at an early age, and Zhou later claimed to have read the famous vernacular novel &quot;Journey to the West&quot; at the age of six. By the age of eight, he was reading other traditional Chinese novels, including &quot;the Water Margin&quot;, &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, and &quot;Dream of the Red Chamber&quot;.

Zhou&#x27;s birth mother Wan died in 1907 when Zhou was 9, and his adoptive mother Chen in 1908 when Zhou was 10. Zhou&#x27;s father was working in Hubei, far from Jiangsu, so Zhou and his two younger brothers returned to Huai&#x27;an and lived with his father&#x27;s remaining younger brother Yikui for the next two years. In 1910, Zhou&#x27;s uncle Yigeng, his father&#x27;s older brother, offered to care for Zhou. The family in Huai&#x27;an agreed, and Zhou was sent to stay with his uncle in Manchuria at Fengtian (now Shenyang), where Zhou Yigeng worked in a government office.

===Education===

In Fengtian, Zhou attended the Dongguan Model Academy, a modern-style school. His previous education consisted entirely of homeschooling. In addition to new subjects such as English and science, Zhou was also exposed to the writings of reformers and radicals such as Liang Qichao, Kang Youwei, Chen Tianhua, Zou Rong, and Zhang Binglin. At the age of fourteen, Zhou declared that his motivation for pursuing education was to &quot;become a great man who will take up the heavy responsibilities of the country in the future.&quot; In 1913, Zhou&#x27;s uncle was transferred to Tianjin, where Zhou entered the famous Nankai Middle School.

Nankai Middle School was founded by Yan Xiu, a prominent scholar and philanthropist, and headed by Zhang Boling, one of the most important Chinese educators of the 20th century. Nankai&#x27;s teaching methods were unusual by contemporary Chinese standards. By the time Zhou began attending, it had adopted the educational model used at the Phillips Academy in the United States. The school&#x27;s reputation, with its &quot;highly disciplined&quot; daily routine and &quot;strict moral code&quot;, attracted many students who later became prominent in public life. Zhou&#x27;s friends and classmates there ranged from Ma Jun (an early communist leader executed in 1927) to K. C. Wu (later mayor of Shanghai and governor of Taiwan under the Nationalist party). Zhou&#x27;s talents also attracted the attention of Yan Xiu and Zhang Boling. Yan in particular thought highly of Zhou, helping to pay for his studies in Japan and later France.

Yan was so impressed with Zhou that he encouraged Zhou to marry his daughter, but Zhou declined. Zhou later expressed the reasons for his decision not to marry Yan&#x27;s daughter to his classmate, Zhang Honghao. Zhou said that he declined the marriage because he feared that his financial prospects would not be promising, and that Yan would, as his father-in-law, later dominate his life.

Zhou did well in his studies at Nankai; he excelled in Chinese, won several awards in the school speech club, and became editor of the school newspaper in his final year. Zhou was also very active in acting and producing dramas and plays at Nankai; many students who were not otherwise acquainted with him knew of him through his acting. Nankai preserves a number of essays and articles written by Zhou at this time, and these reflect the discipline, training, and concern for country that Nankai&#x27;s founders attempted to instill in their students. At the school&#x27;s tenth commencement in June 1917, Zhou was one of five graduating students honored at the ceremony, and one of the two valedictorians.

By the time that he graduated from Nankai, Zhang Boling&#x27;s teachings of &quot;gong&quot; (public spirit) and &quot;neng&quot; (ability) had made a great impression on him. His participation in debates and stage performances contributed to his eloquence and skills of persuasion. Zhou left Nankai with a great desire to pursue public service, and to acquire the skills required to do so.

Following many of his classmates, Zhou went to Japan in July 1917 for further studies. During his two years in Japan, Zhou spent most of his time in the East Asian Higher Preparatory School, a language school for Chinese students. Zhou&#x27;s studies were supported by his uncles, and apparently Nankai founder Yan Xiu as well, but their funds were limited; during this period, Japan suffered from severe inflation. Zhou originally planned to win one of the scholarships offered by the Chinese government; these scholarships, however, required Chinese students to pass entrance examinations in Japanese universities. Zhou took entrance examinations for at least two schools but failed to gain admission. Zhou&#x27;s reported anxieties were compounded by the death of his uncle, Zhou Yikui, his inability to master Japanese, and the acute Japanese cultural chauvinism that discriminated against Chinese. By the time that Zhou returned to China in the spring of 1919, he had become deeply disenchanted with Japanese culture, rejecting the idea that the Japanese political model was relevant to China and disdaining the values of elitism and militarism that he observed.

Zhou&#x27;s diaries and letters from his time in Tokyo show a deep interest in politics and current events, in particular, the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the Bolsheviks&#x27; new policies. He began to read avidly Chen Duxiu&#x27;s progressive and left-leaning magazine, &quot;New Youth&quot;. He read early Japanese works on Marx, and it has been claimed that he even attended Kawakami Hajime&#x27;s lectures at Kyoto University. Kawakami was an important figure in the early history of Japanese Marxism, and his translations and articles influenced a generation of Chinese communists. However, it now seems unlikely that Zhou met him or heard any of his lectures. Zhou&#x27;s diaries also show his interest in Chinese student protests in opposition to the Sino-Japanese Joint Defense Agreement in May 1918, but he did not actively participate in them or return to China as part of the &quot;Returning Home Movement&quot;. His active role in political movements began after his return to China.

===Early political activities===

Zhou returned to Tianjin sometime in the spring of 1919. Historians disagree over his participation in the May Fourth Movement (May to June 1919). Zhou&#x27;s &quot;official&quot; Chinese biography states that he was a leader of the Tianjin student protests in the May Fourth movement, but many modern scholars believe that it is highly unlikely that Zhou participated at all, based on the total lack of direct evidence among the surviving records from the period. In July 1919, however, Zhou became editor of the Tianjin Student Union Bulletin, apparently at the request of his Nankai classmate, Ma Jun, a founder of the Union. During its brief existence from July 1919 to early 1920, the Bulletin was widely read by student groups around the country and suppressed on at least one occasion by the national government as &quot;harmful to public safety and social order.&quot;

When Nankai became a university in August 1919, Zhou was in the first class, but was an activist full-time. His political activities continued to expand, and in September, he and several other students agreed to establish the &quot;Awakening Society&quot;, a small group, never numbering more than 25. In explaining the goals and purpose of the Awakening Society, Zhou declared that &quot;anything that is incompatible with progress in current times, such as militarism, the bourgeoisie, partylords, bureaucrats, inequality between men and women, obstinate ideas, obsolete morals, old ethics... should be abolished or reformed&quot;, and affirmed that it was the purpose of the Society to spread this awareness among the Chinese people. It was in this society that Zhou first met his future wife, Deng Yingchao. In some ways, the Awakening Society resembled the clandestine Marxist study group at Peking University headed by Li Dazhao, with the group members using numbers instead of names for &quot;secrecy&quot;. (Zhou was &quot;Number Five&quot;, a pseudonym which he continued to use in later years.) Indeed, immediately after the group was established, it invited Li Dazhao to give a lecture on Marxism.

Zhou assumed a more prominent active role in political activities over the next few months. The largest of these activities were rallies in support of a nationwide boycott of Japanese goods. As the boycott became more effective, the national government, under pressure from Japan, attempted to suppress it. On 23 January 1920, a confrontation over boycott activities in Tianjin led to the arrest of a number of people, including several Awakening Society members, and on 29 January Zhou led a march on the Governor&#x27;s Office in Tianjin to present a petition calling for the arrestees&#x27; release. Zhou and three other leaders were themselves arrested. The arrestees were held for over six months; during their detention, Zhou supposedly organized discussions on Marxism. At their trial in July, Zhou and six others were sentenced to two months; the rest were found not guilty. All were immediately released since they had already been held over six months.

After Zhou&#x27;s release, he and the Awakening Society met with several Beijing organizations and agreed to form a &quot;Reform Federation&quot;; during these activities Zhou became more familiar with Li Dazhao and met Zhang Shenfu, who was the contact between Li in Beijing and Chen Duxiu in Shanghai. Both men were organizing underground Communist cells in cooperation with Grigori Voitinsky, a Comintern agent, but Zhou apparently did not meet Voitinsky at this point.

Soon after his release, Zhou decided to go to Europe to study. (He was expelled from Nankai University during his detention.) Although money was a problem, he received a scholarship from Yan Xiu. In order to gain greater funding, he successfully approached a Tianjin newspaper, &quot;Yishi bao&quot; (literally, Current Events Newspaper), for work as a &quot;special correspondent&quot; in Europe. Zhou left Shanghai for Europe on 7 November 1920 with a group of 196 work study students, including friends from Nankai and Tianjin.

Zhou&#x27;s experiences after the May Fourth incident seem to have been crucial to his Communist career. Zhou&#x27;s friends in the Awakening Society were similarly affected. 15 of the group&#x27;s members became Communists for at least some time, and the group remained close later on. Zhou and six other group members travelled to Europe in the next two years, and Zhou eventually married Deng Yingchao, the group&#x27;s youngest member.

===European activities===

Zhou&#x27;s group arrived in Marseille on 13 December 1920. Unlike most other Chinese students, who went to Europe on work-study programs, Zhou&#x27;s scholarship and position with &quot;Yishi bao&quot; meant that he was well provided for and did not have to do any work during his stay. Because of his financial position, he was able to devote himself full-time to revolutionary activities. In a letter to his cousin on 30 January 1921, Zhou said that his goals in Europe were to survey the social conditions in foreign countries and their methods of resolving social issues, in order to apply such lessons in China after his return. In the same letter, Zhou told his cousin that, regarding his adoption of a specific ideology, &quot;I still have to make up my mind.&quot;

While in Europe, Zhou, also named as John Knight, studied the differing approaches to resolving class conflict adopted by various European nations. In London in January 1921, Zhou witnessed a large miners&#x27; strike and wrote a series of articles for the &quot;Yishi bao&quot; (generally sympathetic to the miners) examining the conflict between workers and employers, and the conflict&#x27;s resolution. After five weeks in London he moved to Paris, where interest in Russia&#x27;s 1917 October Revolution was high. In a letter to his cousin, Zhou identified two broad paths of reform for China: &quot;gradual reform&quot; (as in England) or &quot;violent means&quot; (as in Russia). Zhou wrote that &quot;I do not have a preference for either the Russian or the British way... I would prefer something in-between, rather than one of these two extremes&quot;.

Still interested in academic programs, Zhou traveled to Britain in January 1921 to visit Edinburgh University. Concerned by financial problems and language requirements, he did not enroll, returning to France at the end of January. There are no records of Zhou entering any academic program in France. In spring 1921, he joined a Chinese Communist cell. Zhou was recruited by Zhang Shenfu, whom he had met in August of the previous year in connection with Li Dazhao. He also knew Zhang through Zhang&#x27;s wife, Liu Qingyang, a member of the Awakening Society. Zhou has sometimes been portrayed at this time as uncertain in his politics, but his swift move to Communism suggests otherwise.

The cell Zhou belonged to was based in Paris; in addition to Zhou, Zhang, and Liu it included two other students, Zhao Shiyan and Chen Gongpei. Over the next several months, this group eventually formed a united organization with a group of Chinese radicals from Hunan, who were living in Montargis south of Paris. This group included such later prominent figures as Cai Hesen, Li Lisan, Chen Yi, Nie Rongzhen, Deng Xiaoping, and also Guo Longzhen, another member of the Awakening Society. Unlike Zhou, most of the students in this group were participants in the work-study program. A series of conflicts with the Chinese administrators of the program over low pay and poor working conditions resulted in over a hundred students occupying the program&#x27;s offices at the Sino-French Institute in Lyon in September 1921. The students, including several people from the Montargis group, were arrested and deported. Zhou was apparently not one of the occupying students and remained in France until February or March 1922, when he moved with Zhang and Liu from Paris to Berlin. Zhou&#x27;s move to Berlin was perhaps because the relatively &quot;lenient&quot; political atmosphere in Berlin made it more favorable as a base for overall European organizing. In addition, the Western European Secretariat of the Comintern was located in Berlin and it is clear that Zhou had important Comintern connections, though the nature of these is disputed. After moving operations to Germany, Zhou regularly shuttled between Paris and Berlin.

Zhou participated in the Diligent Work-Frugal Study Movement.

Zhou returned to Paris by June 1922, where he was one of the twenty two participants present at the organization of the Communist Youth League of China, established as the European Branch of the Chinese Communist Party. Zhou helped draft the party&#x27;s charter and was elected to the three member executive committee as director of propaganda. He also wrote for and helped edit the party magazine, &quot;Shaonian&quot; (Youth), later renamed &quot;Chiguang&quot; (Red Light). It was in Zhou&#x27;s capacity as general editor of this magazine that Zhou first met Deng Xiaoping, only seventeen years old, whom Zhou hired to operate a mimeograph (copy) machine. The party went through several reorganizations and name changes, but Zhou remained a key member of the group throughout his stay in Europe. Other important activities Zhou undertook included recruiting and transporting students for the University of the Toilers of the East in Moscow, and the establishment of the Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang or KMT) European branch.

In June 1923, the Third Congress of the Chinese Communist Party accepted the Comintern&#x27;s instructions to ally with the KMT, led at the time by Sun Yat-sen. These instructions called for CCP members to join the Nationalist Party as &quot;individuals&quot;, while still retaining their association with the CCP. After joining the KMT, they would work to lead and direct it, transforming it into a vehicle of revolution. Within several years, this strategy would become the source of serious conflict between the KMT and the CCP.

As well as joining the KMT, Zhou helped organize the founding of the Nationalist Party European branch in November 1923. Under Zhou&#x27;s influence, most of the European branch&#x27;s officers were in fact communists. Zhou&#x27;s wide-ranging contacts and personal relationships formed during this period were central to his career. Important party leaders, such as Zhu De and Nie Rongzhen, were first admitted to the party by Zhou.

By 1924, the Soviet-Nationalist alliance was expanding rapidly and Zhou was summoned back to China for further work. He left Europe probably in late July 1924, returning to China as one of the most senior Chinese Communist Party members in Europe.

==Political and military work in Whampoa==

===Establishment in Guangzhou===

Zhou returned to China in late August or early September 1924 to join the Political Department of the Whampoa Military Academy, probably through the influence of Zhang Shenfu, who had previously worked there. Zhou was Whampoa&#x27;s chief political officer. While he was serving in Whampoa, Zhou was also made the secretary of the Communist Party of Guangdong-Guangxi, and served as the CCP representative with the rank of major-general.

The island of Whampoa, ten miles downriver from Guangzhou, was at the heart of the Soviet-Nationalist Party alliance. Conceived as the training center of the Nationalist Party Army, it was to provide the military base from which the Nationalists would launch their campaign to unify China, which was split into dozens of military satrapies. From its beginning, the school was funded, armed, and partly staffed by the Soviets.

The Political Department, where Zhou worked, was responsible for political indoctrination and control. As a result, Zhou was a prominent figure at most Academy meetings, often addressing the school immediately after commandant Chiang Kai-shek. He was extremely influential in establishing the political department/party representative (commissar) system which was adopted in Nationalist armed forces in 1925.

Concurrent with his Whampoa appointment, Zhou became secretary of the Communist Party&#x27;s Guangdong Provincial Committee, and at some point a member of the Provincial Committee&#x27;s Military Section. Zhou vigorously extended Communist influence at the academy. He soon arranged for a number of other prominent Communists to join the Political Department, including Chen Yi, Nie Rongzhen, Yun Daiying, and Xiong Xiong. Zhou played an important role in establishing the Young Soldiers Association, a youth group which was dominated by the Communists, and Sparks, a short-lived Communist front group. He thus recruited numerous new Communist party members from cadet ranks, and eventually set up a covert Communist Party branch at the academy to direct the new members. When Nationalists concerned with the increasing number of Communist members and organizations at Whampoa set up a &quot;Society for Sun Yat-senism&quot;, Zhou attempted to squelch it; the conflict between these student groups set the background for Zhou&#x27;s removal from the academy.

===Military activities===

Zhou participated in two military operations conducted by the Nationalist regime in 1925, later known as the first and second Eastern Expeditions. The first was in January 1925 when Chen Jiongming, an important Cantonese military leader previously driven out of Guangzhou by Sun Yat-sen, attempted to retake Guangzhou. The Nationalist regime&#x27;s campaign against Chen consisted of forces from the Guangdong Army under Xu Chongzhix, and two training regiments of the Nationalist Party Army, led by Chiang Kai-shek and staffed by Academy officers and cadets. The fighting lasted through May 1925, with the defeat, but not destruction, of Chen&#x27;s forces. Zhou accompanied the Whampoa cadets on the expedition as a political officer.

When Chen regrouped and attacked Guangzhou again in September 1925, the Nationalists launched a second expedition. Nationalist forces by this time had been reorganized into five corps (or armies) and adopted the commissar system with Political Departments and Nationalist party representatives in most divisions. The First Corps, made up of the Nationalist Party Army, was led by Whampoa graduates and commanded by Chiang Kai-shek, who personally appointed Zhou director of the First Corps Political Department. Soon after, the Nationalist Party&#x27;s Central Executive Committee appointed Zhou Nationalist Party party representative, making Zhou chief commissar of the First Corps. The first major battle of expedition saw the capture of Chen&#x27;s base in Huizhou on 15 October. Shantou was taken on 6 November, and by the end of 1925, the Nationalists controlled all of Guangdong province.

Zhou&#x27;s appointment as chief commissar of the First Corps allowed him to appoint Communists as commissars in four of the Corps&#x27; five divisions. Following the conclusion of the Expedition, Zhou was appointed special commissioner for the East River District, which placed him in temporary administrative control of several counties; he apparently used this opportunity to establish a Communist party branch in Shantou and strengthen the CCP&#x27;s control of local unions. This marked the high point of Zhou&#x27;s time at Whampoa.

===Political activities===
In personal terms, 1925 was also an important year for Zhou. Zhou had kept in touch with Deng Yingchao, whom he had met in the Awakening Society while in Tianjin; and, in January 1925, Zhou asked for and received permission from CCP authorities to marry Deng. The two married in Guangzhou on 8 August 1925.

Zhou&#x27;s work at Whampoa came to an end with the Zhongshan Warship Incident of 20 March 1926, in which a gunboat with a mostly Communist crew moved from Whampoa to Guangzhou without Chiang&#x27;s knowledge or approval. This event led to Chiang&#x27;s exclusion of Communists from the academy by May 1926, and the removal of numerous Communists from high positions in the Nationalist Party. In his memoirs, Nie Rongzhen suggested that the gunboat had moved in protest of Zhou Enlai&#x27;s (brief) arrest.

Zhou&#x27;s time in Whampoa was a significant period in his career. His pioneering work as a political officer in the military made him an important Communist Party expert in this key area; much of his later career centered on the military. Zhou&#x27;s work in the CCP Guangdong Regional Committee Military Section was typical of his covert activities in the period. The Section was a secret group consisting of three members of the Provincial Central Committee, and was first responsible for organizing and directing CCP nuclei in the army itself. These nuclei, organized at the regimental level and above, were &quot;illegal&quot;, meaning they were formed without Nationalist knowledge or authorization. The Section was also responsible for organizing similar nuclei in other armed groups, including secret societies and key services such as railroads and waterways. Zhou did extensive work in these areas until the final separation of the Nationalist and Communist parties and the end of the Soviet-Nationalist alliance in 1927.

==Nationalist-Communist split==

===Extent of cooperation===
Zhou&#x27;s activities immediately after his removal from his positions at Whampoa are uncertain. An earlier biographer claims that Chiang Kai-shek put Zhou in charge of &quot;an advanced training center for the CCP members and commissars withdrawn from the army&quot;. More recent Chinese Communist sources claim that Zhou had an important role at this time in securing Communist control of Ye Ting&#x27;s Independent Regiment. The regiment and Ye Ting later played a leading role in the Communists&#x27; first major military action, the Nanchang Revolt.

In July 1926, the Nationalists began the Northern Expedition, a massive military attempt to unify China. The Expedition was led by Chiang Kai-shek and the National Revolutionary Army (NRA), an amalgam of earlier military forces with significant guidance from Russian military advisors and numerous Communists as both commanding and political officers. With the early successes of the Expedition, there was soon a race between Chiang Kai-shek leading the &quot;right-wing&quot; of the Nationalist Party and the Communists, running inside the &quot;left-wing&quot; of the Nationalists, for control of major southern cities such as Nanjing and Shanghai. At this point the Chinese portion of Shanghai was controlled by Sun Chuanfang, one of the militarists targeted by the North Expedition. Distracted by fighting with the NRA and defections from his army, Sun reduced his forces in Shanghai, and the Communists, whose party headquarters was located in Shanghai, made three attempts to seize control of the city, later called &quot;the three Shanghai Uprisings&quot;, in October 1926, February 1927 and March 1927.

===Activities in Shanghai===

Zhou was transferred to Shanghai to assist in these activities, probably in late 1926. It seems he was not present for the first uprising on 23–24 October, but he was certainly in Shanghai by December 1926. Early accounts credit Zhou with labor organizing activities in Shanghai after his arrival, or, more credibly, working to &quot;strengthen the indoctrination of political workers in labor unions and smuggle arms for the strikers.&quot; Reports that Zhou &quot;organized&quot; or &quot;ordered&quot; the second and third uprisings on 20 February and 21 March exaggerate his role. Major decisions during this period were made by the Communist head in Shanghai, Chen Duxiu, the Party&#x27;s general secretary, with a special committee of eight party officials coordinating Communist actions. The committee also consulted closely on decisions with the Comintern representatives in Shanghai, headed by Grigori Voitinsky. The partial documentation available for this period shows that Zhou headed the Communist Party Central Committee&#x27;s Military Commission in Shanghai. He participated in both the February and March actions, but was not the guiding hand in either event, instead working with A. P. Appen, the Soviet military advisor to the Central Committee, training the pickets of the General Labor Union, the Communist controlled labor organization in Shanghai. He also worked to make union strong arm squads more effective when the Communists declared a &quot;Red Terror&quot; after the failed February uprising; this action resulted in the murder of twenty &quot;anti-union&quot; figures, and the kidnapping, beating, and intimidation of others associated with anti-union activities.

The third Communist uprising in Shanghai took place from 20 to 21 March. Approximately 600,000 rioting workers cut power and telephone lines and seized the city&#x27;s post office, police headquarters, and railway stations, often after heavy fighting. During this uprising, the insurrectionists were under strict orders not to harm foreigners, which they obeyed. The forces of Sun Chuanfang withdrew and the uprising was successful, despite the small number of armed forces available. The first Nationalist troops entered the city the next day.

As the Communists attempted to install a soviet municipal government, conflict began between the Nationalists and Communists, and on 12 April Nationalist forces, including both members of the Green Gang and soldiers under the command of Nationalist general Pai Ch&#x27;ung-hsi attacked the Communists and quickly overcame them. On the eve of the Nationalist attack, Wang Shouhua, who was both the head of the CCP Labor Committee and the Chairman of the General Labor Committee, accepted a dinner invitation from &quot;Big-eared Du&quot; (a Shanghai gangster) and was strangled after he arrived. Zhou himself was nearly killed in a similar trap, when he was arrested after arriving at a dinner held at the headquarters of Si Lie, a Nationalist commander of Chiang&#x27;s Twenty-sixth Army. Despite rumors that Chiang had put a high price on Zhou&#x27;s head, he was quickly released by Pai Ch&#x27;ung-hsi&#x27;s forces. The reasons for Zhou&#x27;s sudden release may have been that Zhou was then the most senior Communist in Shanghai, that Chiang&#x27;s efforts to exterminate the Shanghai Communists were highly secretive at the time, and that his execution would have been noticed as a violation of the cooperation agreement between the CCP and the KMT (which was technically still in effect). Zhou was finally only released after the intervention of a representative of the Twenty-sixth Army, Zhao Shu, who was able to convince his commanders that the arrest of Zhou had been a mistake.

===Flight from Shanghai===
Fleeing Shanghai, Zhou made his way to Hankou (now part of Wuhan) and was a participant at the CCP&#x27;s 5th National Congress there from 27 April to 9 May. At the end of the Congress, Zhou was elected to the Party&#x27;s Central Committee, again heading the military department. After Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s suppression of the Communists, the Nationalist Party split in two, with the Nationalist Party&#x27;s &quot;left-wing&quot; (led by Wang Jingwei) controlling the government in Hankou, and the party &quot;right-wing&quot; (led by Chiang Kai-shek) establishing a rival government in Nanjing. Still following Comintern instructions, the Communists remained as a &quot;bloc inside&quot; the Nationalist Party, hoping to continue expanding their influence through the Nationalists. After being attacked by a warlord friendly to Chiang, Wang&#x27;s leftist government disintegrated later in May 1927, and Chiang&#x27;s troops began an organized purge of Communists in territories formerly controlled by Wang. In mid-July Zhou was forced to go underground.

Pressured by their Comintern advisors, and themselves convinced that the &quot;revolutionary high tide&quot; had arrived, the Communists decided to launch a series of military revolts. The first of these was the Nanchang Revolt. Zhou was sent to oversee the event, but the moving figures seem to have been Tan Pingshan and Li Lisan, while the main military figures were Ye Ting and He Long. In military terms, the revolt was a disaster, with the Communists&#x27; forces decimated and scattered.

Zhou himself contracted malaria during the campaign and was secretly sent to Hong Kong for medical treatment by Nie Rongzhen and Ye Ting. After reaching Hong Kong, Zhou was disguised as a businessman named &quot;Li&quot; and entrusted to the care of local Communists. In a subsequent meeting of the CCP Central Committee, Zhou was blamed for the failure of the Nanchang campaign and temporarily demoted to being an alternate member of the Politburo.

==Activities during the Chinese Civil War==
===Sixth Party Congress===
After the failure of the Nanchang Uprising, Zhou left China for the Soviet Union to attend the Chinese Communist Party&#x27;s (CCP) Sixth National Party Congress in Moscow, in June–July 1928. The Sixth Congress had to be held in Moscow because conditions in China were considered dangerous. KMT control was so tight that many Chinese delegates attending the Sixth Congress were forced to travel in disguise: Zhou himself was disguised as an antiquarian.

At the Sixth Congress, Zhou delivered a long speech insisting that conditions in China were unfavorable for immediate revolution, and that the main task of the CCP should be to develop revolutionary momentum by winning over the support of the masses in the countryside and establishing a Soviet regime in southern China, similar to the one that Mao Zedong and Zhu De were already establishing around Jiangxi. The Congress generally accepted Zhou&#x27;s assessment as accurate. Zhou was elected Director of the Central Committee Organization Department. His ally, Li Lisan, took over propaganda work. Xiang Zhongfa was made secretary general of the Party, but was soon found incapable of fulfilling his role, so Zhou emerged as the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the CCP. Zhou was only thirty years old.

Zhou finally returned to China in 1929, after more than a year abroad. In early 1930, Zhou began to disagree with Li Lisan&#x27;s strategy of favoring rich peasants and concentrating military forces for attacks on urban centers. Zhou did not openly break with these more orthodox notions, and even tried to implement in Jiangxi in 1931. When the Soviet agent Pavel Mif arrived in Shanghai to lead the Comintern in China in December 1930, Mif criticized Li&#x27;s strategy as &quot;left adventurism&quot;, and criticized Zhou for compromising with Li. Zhou &quot;acknowledged&quot; his mistakes in compromising with Li in January 1931 and offered to resign from the Politburo, but was retained while other senior CCP leaders, including Li and Qu Qiubai, were removed. As Mao later recognized, Mif understood that Zhou&#x27;s services as Party leader were indispensable, and that Zhou would willingly cooperate with whoever was holding power.

===Underground work: establishment===

After arriving back in Shanghai in 1929, Zhou began to work underground, establishing and overseeing a network of independent Communist cells. Zhou&#x27;s greatest danger in his underground work was the threat of being discovered by the KMT secret police, which had been established in 1928 with the specific mission of identifying and eliminating Communists. In order to avoid detection, Zhou and his wife changed residences at least once a month and used a variety of aliases. Zhou often disguised himself as a businessman and sometimes wore a beard. Zhou was careful that only two or three people ever knew his whereabouts. Zhou disguised all urban Party offices, made sure that CCP offices never shared the same buildings when in the same city, and required all Party members to use passwords to identify one another. Zhou restricted all of his meetings to either before 7 am or after 7 pm. Zhou never used public transportation and avoided being seen in public places.

In November 1928, the CCP also established its own intelligence agency, the (), which Zhou came to control. Zhou&#x27;s chief lieutenants were Gu Shunzhang, who had strong ties to Chinese secret societies and became an alternate member of the Politburo, and Xiang Zhongfa. The &quot;Teke&quot; had four operational sections: one for the protection and safety of Party members; one for intelligence gathering; one for facilitating internal communications; and one to conduct assassinations, a team that became known as the &quot;Red Squad&quot; ().

Zhou&#x27;s main concern in running the &quot;Teke&quot; was to establish an effective anti-espionage network within the KMT secret police. Within a short amount of time the head of &quot;Teke&quot;&#x27;s intelligence section, Chen Geng, succeeded in planting a large network of moles inside the Investigation Section of the Central Operations Department in Nanjing, which was the center of KMT intelligence. The three most successful agents used by Zhou to infiltrate the KMT secret police were Qian Zhuangfei, Li Kenong, and Hu Di, whom Zhou called &quot;the three most distinguished intelligence workers of the Party&quot; in the 1930s. Agents planted within various KMT offices were later critical in the survival of the CCP, helping the Party escape Chiang&#x27;s Encirclement Campaigns.

===KMT response to Zhou&#x27;s intelligence work===

In late April 1931, Zhou&#x27;s chief aide in security affairs, Gu Shunzhang, was arrested by the KMT in Wuhan. Gu was a former labor organizer with strong mafia connections and weak commitments to the CCP. Under threat of heavy torture, Gu gave the KMT secret police detailed accounts of underground CCP organizations in Wuhan, leading to the arrest and executions of over ten senior CCP leaders in the city. Gu offered to provide the KMT with details of CCP activities in Shanghai, but only if he could give the information directly to Chiang Kai-shek.

One of Zhou&#x27;s agents working in Nanjing, Qian Zhuangfei, intercepted a telegram requesting further instructions from Nanjing on how to proceed, and abandoned his cover to personally warn Zhou of the impending crackdown. The two days before Gu arrived in Nanjing to meet with Chiang gave Zhou time to evacuate Party members and to change the communication codes used by &quot;Teke&quot;, all of which were known to Gu. After meeting briefly with Chiang in Nanjing, Gu arrived in Shanghai and assisted the KMT secret police in raiding CCP offices and residences, capturing members who could not be evacuated in time. The summary executions of those suspected of Communist sympathies resulted in the largest death-toll since the Shanghai massacre of 1927.

Zhou&#x27;s reaction to Gu&#x27;s betrayal was extreme. More than fifteen members of Gu&#x27;s family, some of whom worked for &quot;Teke&quot;, were murdered by the Red Squad and buried in quiet residential areas of Shanghai. The Red Squad then assassinated Wang Bing, a leading member of the KMT secret police who was known for moving around Shanghai in rickshaws, without the protection of bodyguards. Most surviving CCP members were relocated to the Communist base in Jiangxi. Because most senior staff had become exposed by Gu, most of its best agents were also relocated. Zhou&#x27;s most senior aide not yet under suspicion, Pan Hannian, became &quot;Teke&quot;&#x27;s director.

The night before he was scheduled to leave Shanghai in June 1931, Xiang Zhongfa, who was one of Zhou&#x27;s most senior agents, decided to spend the night in a hotel with his mistress, ignoring Zhou&#x27;s warnings about the danger. In the morning, a KMT informant who had been trailing Xiang spotted him as he was leaving the hotel. Xiang was immediately arrested and imprisoned within the French Concession. Zhou attempted to prevent Xiang&#x27;s expected extradition to KMT-controlled China by having his agents bribe the chief of police in the French Concession, but the KMT authorities appealed directly to the authorities of the French Concession, ensuring that the chief of police could not intervene. Zhou&#x27;s hopes that Xiang would be transferred to Nanjing, giving him an opportunity to kidnap Xiang, also came to naught. The French agreed to transfer Xiang to the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, under the command of General Xiong Shihui, who subjected Xiang to relentless torture and interrogation. Once he became convinced that Xiang had given his torturers all the information that they requested, Chiang Kai-shek ordered Xiang to be executed.

Zhou Enlai later succeeded in secretly purchasing a copy of Xiang&#x27;s interrogation records. The records showed that Xiang had disclosed everything to the KMT authorities before his execution, including the location of Zhou&#x27;s residence. Another round of arrests and executions followed Xiang&#x27;s capture, but Zhou and his wife were able to escape capture because they had abandoned their apartment on the morning of Xiang&#x27;s arrest. After establishing a new Politburo Standing Committee in Shanghai, Zhou and his wife relocated to the Communist base in Jiangxi near the end of 1931. By the time Zhou left Shanghai, he was one of the most wanted men in China.

===Jiangxi Soviet===

Following the failed Nanchang and Autumn Harvest Uprisings of 1927, the Communists began to focus on establishing a series of rural bases of operation in southern China. Even before moving to Jiangxi, Zhou had become involved in the politics of these bases. Mao, claiming the need to eliminate counterrevolutionaries and Anti-Bolsheviks operating within the CCP, began an ideological purge of the populace inside the Jiangxi Soviet. Zhou, perhaps due to his own success planting moles within various levels of the KMT, agreed that an organized campaign to uncover subversion was justified, and supported the campaign as de facto leader of the CCP.

Mao&#x27;s efforts soon developed into a ruthless campaign driven by paranoia and aimed not only at KMT spies, but at anyone with an ideological outlook different from Mao&#x27;s. Suspects were commonly tortured until they confessed to their crimes and accused others of crimes, and wives and relatives who inquired of those being tortured were themselves arrested and tortured even more severely. Mao&#x27;s attempts to purge the Red Army of those who might potentially oppose him led Mao to accuse Chen Yi, the commander and political commissar of the Jiangxi Military Region, as a counterrevolutionary, provoking a violent reaction against Mao&#x27;s persecutions that became known as the &quot;Futian Incident&quot; in January 1931. Mao was eventually successful in subduing the Red Army, reducing its numbers from forty thousand to less than ten thousand. The campaign continued throughout 1930 and 1931. Historians estimate the total number who died due to Mao&#x27;s persecution in all base areas to be approximately one hundred thousand.

The entire campaign occurred while Zhou was still in Shanghai. Although he had supported the elimination of counterrevolutionaries, Zhou actively suppressed the campaign when he arrived in Jiangxi in December 1931, criticizing the &quot;excess, the panic, and the oversimplification&quot; practiced by local officials. After investigating those accused of anti-Bolshevism, and those persecuting them, Zhou submitted a report criticizing the campaign for focusing on the narrow persecution of anti-Maoists as anti-Bolsheviks, exaggerating the threat to the Party, and condemning the use of torture as an investigative technique. Zhou&#x27;s resolution was passed and adopted on 7 January 1932, and the campaign gradually subsided.

Zhou moved to the Jiangxi base area and shook up the propaganda-oriented approach to revolution by demanding that the armed forces under Communist control actually be used to expand the base, rather than just to control and defend it. In December 1931, Zhou replaced Mao Zedong as Secretary of the First Front Army with Xiang Ying, and made himself political commissar of the Red Army, in place of Mao. Liu Bocheng, Lin Biao and Peng Dehuai all criticized Mao&#x27;s tactics at the October 1932 Ningdu Conference.

After moving to Jiangxi, Zhou met Mao for the first time since 1927, and began his long relationship with Mao as his superior. In the Ningdu conference, Mao was demoted to being a figurehead in the Soviet government. Zhou, who had come to appreciate Mao&#x27;s strategies after the series of military failures waged by other Party leaders since 1927, defended Mao, but was unsuccessful. After achieving power, Mao later purged or demoted those who had opposed him in 1932, but remembered Zhou&#x27;s defense of his policies.

===Chiang&#x27;s Encirclement Campaigns===

In early 1933, Bo Gu arrived with the German Comintern advisor Otto Braun and took control of party affairs. Zhou at this time, apparently with strong support from Party and military colleagues, reorganized and standardized the Red Army. Under Zhou, Bo, and Braun, the Red Army defeated four attacks by Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s Nationalist troops. 

Chiang&#x27;s fifth campaign, launched in September 1933, was much more difficult to contain. Chiang&#x27;s new use of &quot;blockhouse tactics&quot; and larger numbers of troops allowed his army to advance steadily into Communist territory, and they succeeded in seizing several major Communist strongholds. Bo Gu and Otto Braun adopted orthodox tactics to respond to Chiang, and Zhou, although personally opposed to them, directed these. Following their subsequent defeat, he and other military leaders were blamed.

Although Zhou&#x27;s subsequently cautious military approach was distrusted by hardliners, he was again appointed to the position of vice chairman of the Military Commission. Zhou was accepted as leader largely because of his organizational talent and devotion to work, and because he had never shown any overt ambition to pursue supreme power within the Party. Within months, the continuing orthodox tactics of Bo and Braun led to a serious defeat for the Red Army, and forced the leaders of the CCP to seriously consider abandoning their bases in Jiangxi.

===Long March===
After the decision to abandon Jiangxi was announced, Zhou was placed in charge of organizing and supervising the logistics of the Communist withdrawal. Making his plans in absolute secrecy and waiting till the last moment to inform even senior leaders of the group&#x27;s movements, Zhou&#x27;s objective was to break through the enemy encirclement with as few casualties as possible, and before Chiang&#x27;s forces were able to completely occupy all Communist bases. It is not known what criteria were used to determine who would stay and who would go, but 16,000 troops and some of the Communists&#x27; most notable commanders at the time (including Xiang Ying, Chen Yi, Tan Zhenlin, and Qu Qiubai) were left to form a rear guard to divert the main force of Nationalist troops from noticing the Communists&#x27; general withdrawal.

The withdrawal of 84,000 soldiers and civilians began in early October 1934. Zhou&#x27;s intelligence agents were successful in identifying a large section of Chiang&#x27;s blockhouse lines that were manned by troops under General Chen Jitang, a Guangdong warlord who Zhou identified as being likely to prefer preserving the strength of his troops over fighting. Zhou sent Pan Hannian to negotiate for safe passage with General Chen, who subsequently allowed the Red Army to pass through the territory that he controlled without fighting.

After passing through three of the four blockhouse fortifications needed to escape Chiang&#x27;s encirclement, the Red Army was finally intercepted by regular Nationalist troops, and suffered heavy casualties. Of the 86,000 Communists who attempted to break out of Jiangxi, only 36,000 successfully escaped. This loss demoralized some Communist leaders (particularly Bo Gu and Otto Braun), but Zhou remained calm and retained his command.

During the Communists&#x27; subsequent Long March, there were numerous high-level disputes over the direction that the Communists should take, and on the causes of the Red Army&#x27;s defeats. During the power struggles that ensued, Zhou consistently backed Mao Zedong against the interests of Bo Gu and Otto Braun. Bo and Braun were later blamed for the Red Army&#x27;s defeats, and were eventually removed from their positions of leadership. The Communists eventually succeeded in re-establishing a base in northern Shaanxi on 20 October 1935, arriving with only 8,000–9,000 remaining members.

Zhou&#x27;s position within the CCP changed numerous times throughout the Long March. By the early 1930s, Zhou was recognized as the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the CCP, and exercised superior influence over other members of the CCP even when sharing power with Bo and Braun. In the months following the January 1935 Zunyi Conference, in which Bo and Braun were removed from senior positions, Zhou mostly retained his position because he displayed a willingness to display responsibility, because his tactics in defeating Chiang&#x27;s Fourth Encirclement Campaign were recognized as being successful, and because he supported Mao Zedong, who was gaining influence inside the Party: after the Zunyi Conference, Mao became Zhou&#x27;s assistant. After the Communists reached Shaanxi and completed the Long March, Mao officially took over Zhou Enlai&#x27;s leading position in the CCP, while Zhou took a secondary position as vice-chairman. Mao and Zhou would retain their positions within the CCP until their deaths in 1976.

===Xi&#x27;an Incident===

During the seventh congress of the Comintern, held in August 1936, Wang Ming issued an anti-Fascist manifesto, indicating that the CCP&#x27;s previous policy of &quot;opposing Chiang Kai-shek and resisting Japan&quot; was to be replaced by a policy of &quot;uniting with Chiang Kai-shek to resist Japan&quot;. Zhou was instrumental in carrying out this policy. Zhou made contact with one of the most senior KMT commanders in the northwest, Zhang Xueliang. By 1935, Zhang was well known for his anti-Japanese sentiments and his doubts about Chiang&#x27;s willingness to oppose the Japanese. Zhang&#x27;s disposition made him easily influenced by Zhou&#x27;s indications that the CCP would cooperate to fight against the Japanese.

Zhou established a &quot;northeast working committee&quot; for the purpose of promoting cooperation with Zhang. The committee worked to persuade Zhang&#x27;s Northeast Army to unite with the Red Army to fight Japan and retake Manchuria. The committee also created new patriotic slogans, including &quot;Chinese must not fight Chinese&quot;, to promote Zhou&#x27;s goals. Using his network of secret contacts, Zhou arranged a meeting with Zhang in Yan&#x27;an, then controlled by Zhang&#x27;s &quot;Northeast Army&quot;.

The first meeting between Zhou and Zhang occurred inside a church on 7 April 1936. Zhang showed a great interest in ending the civil war, uniting the country, and fighting the Japanese, but warned that Chiang was firmly in control of the national government, and that these goals would be difficult to pursue without Chiang&#x27;s cooperation. Both parties ended their meeting with an agreement to find a way to secretly work together. At the same time that Zhou was establishing secret contacts with Zhang, Chiang was growing suspicious of Zhang, and became increasingly dissatisfied with Zhang&#x27;s inaction against the Communists. In order to deceive Chiang, Zhou and Zhang deployed mock military units in order to give the impression that the Northeast Army and the Red Army were engaged in battle.

In December 1936, Chiang Kai-shek flew to the Nationalist headquarters in Xi&#x27;an in order to test the loyalty of local KMT military forces under Marshal Zhang Xueliang, and to personally lead these forces in a final attack on Communist bases in Shaanxi, which Zhang had been ordered to destroy. Determined to force Chiang to direct China&#x27;s forces against the Japanese (who had taken Zhang&#x27;s territory of Manchuria and were preparing a broader invasion), on 12 December Zhang and his followers stormed Chiang&#x27;s headquarters, killed most of his bodyguards, and seized the Generalissimo in what became known as the Xi&#x27;an Incident.

Reactions to Chiang&#x27;s kidnapping in Yan&#x27;an were mixed. Some, including Mao Zedong and Zhu De, viewed it as an opportunity to have Chiang killed. Others, including Zhou Enlai and Zhang Wentian, saw it as an opportunity to achieve a united-front policy against the Japanese, which would strengthen the overall position of the CCP. Debate within Yan&#x27;an ended when a long telegram from Joseph Stalin arrived, urging the CCP to work towards Chiang&#x27;s release, explaining that a united front was the best position from which to resist the Japanese, and that only Chiang had the prestige and authority to carry out such a plan.

After initial communications with Zhang on the fate of Chiang, Zhou Enlai reached Xi&#x27;an on 16 December, on a plane specifically sent for him by Zhang Xueliang, as the chief Communist negotiator. At first, Chiang was opposed to negotiating with a CCP delegate, but withdrew his opposition when it became clear that his life and freedom were largely dependent on Communist goodwill towards him. On 24 December, Chiang received Zhou for a meeting, the first time that the two had seen each other since Zhou had left Whampoa over ten years earlier. Zhou began the conversation by saying, &quot;In the ten years since we have met, you seem to have aged very little.&quot; Chiang nodded and said: &quot;Enlai, you were my subordinate. You should do what I say.&quot; Zhou replied that if Chiang would halt the civil war and resist the Japanese instead, the Red Army would willingly accept Chiang&#x27;s command. By the end of this meeting, Chiang promised to end the civil war, to resist the Japanese together, and to invite Zhou to Nanjing for further talks.

On 25 December 1936, Zhang released Chiang and accompanied him to Nanjing. Subsequently, Zhang was court-martialed and sentenced to house arrest, and most of the officers who participated in the Xi&#x27;an Incident were executed. Although the KMT formally rejected collaboration with the CCP, Chiang ended active military activity against Communist bases in Yan&#x27;nan, implying that he had implicitly given his word to change the direction of his policies. Following the end of KMT attacks, the CCP was able to consolidate its territories and to prepare to resist the Japanese.

After news arrived that Zhang had been betrayed and arrested by Chiang, Zhang&#x27;s old officer corps became very agitated, and some of them murdered a Nationalist general, Wang Yizhe, who was seen as largely responsible for the military&#x27;s lack of response. While Zhou was still in Xi&#x27;an, he himself was surrounded in his office by a number of Zhang&#x27;s officers, who accused the Communists of instigating the Xi&#x27;an Incident and of betraying Zhang by convincing the general to travel to Nanjing. At gunpoint, they threatened to kill Zhou. Ever the diplomat, Zhou maintained his composure and eloquently defended his position. In the end, Zhou succeeded in calming the officers, and they departed, leaving him unharmed.

In a series of negotiations with the KMT that lasted until June 1937 (when the Marco Polo Bridge Incident occurred), Zhou attempted to gain Zhang&#x27;s release, but failed.

==Activities during World War II==

===Propaganda and intelligence in Wuhan===
When the Nationalist capital of Nanjing fell to the Japanese on 13 December 1937, Zhou accompanied the Nationalist government to its temporary capital of Wuhan. As the chief representative of the CCP in the nominal KMT-CCP cooperation agreement, Zhou established and headed the official KMT-CCP liaison office. While running the liaison office, Zhou established the Yangtze Bureau of the Central Committee. Under cover of its association with the Eighth Route Army, Zhou used the Yangtze Bureau to conduct clandestine operations within southern China, secretly recruiting Communist operatives and establishing Party structures throughout KMT-controlled areas.

In August 1937, the CCP secretly issued orders to Zhou that his united front work was to focus on Communist infiltration and organization at all levels of the government and society. Zhou agreed to these orders, and applied his considerable organizational talents to completing them. Shortly after Zhou&#x27;s arrival in Wuhan, he convinced the Nationalist government to approve and fund a Communist newspaper, the &quot;New China Daily&quot;, justifying it as a tool to spread anti-Japanese propaganda. This newspaper became a major tool for spreading Communist propaganda, and the Nationalists later viewed its approval and funding as one of their &quot;biggest mistakes&quot;.

Zhou was successful in organizing large numbers of Chinese intellectuals and artists to promote resistance against the Japanese. The largest propaganda event that Zhou staged was a week-long celebration in 1938, following the successful defense of Taierzhuang. In this event, between 400,000 and 500,000 people took part in parades, and a chorus of over 10,000 people sung songs of resistance. Fundraising efforts during the week raised over a million yuan. Zhou himself donated 240 yuan, his monthly salary as deputy director of the Political Department.

While he was working in Wuhan, Zhou was the CCP&#x27;s main contact person with the outside world, and worked hard to reverse the public perception of the Communists as a &quot;bandit organization&quot;. Zhou established and maintained contacts with over forty foreign journalists and writers, including Edgar Snow, Agnes Smedley, Anna Louise Strong and Rewi Alley, many of whom became sympathetic to the Communist cause and wrote about their sympathies in foreign publications. In sympathy with his efforts to promote the CCP to the outside world, Zhou arranged for a Canadian medical team, headed by Norman Bethune, to travel to Yan&#x27;an, and assisted the Dutch film director Joris Ivens in producing a documentary, &quot;400 Million People&quot;.

Zhou was unsuccessful in averting the public defection of Zhang Guotao, one of the founders of the CCP, to the KMT. Zhang was prepared to defect due to a disagreement with Mao Zedong over the implementation of the united front policy, and because he resented Mao&#x27;s authoritarian leadership style. Zhou, with the aid of Wang Ming, Bo Gu and Li Kenong, intercepted Zhang after he arrived in Wuhan, and engaged in extensive negotiations through April 1938, in order to convince Zhang not to defect, but these negotiations were unsuccessful. In the end, Zhang refused to compromise and placed himself under the protection of the KMT secret police. On 18 April, the CCP Central Committee expelled Zhang from the Party, and Zhang himself issued a statement accusing the CCP of sabotaging efforts to resist the Japanese. The entire episode was a serious setback for Zhou&#x27;s attempts to improve the prestige of the Party.

===Military strategy in Wuhan===
In January 1938, the Nationalist government appointed Zhou as the deputy director to the Political Department of the Military Committee, working directly under General Chen Cheng. As a senior Communist statesman holding the rank of lieutenant-general, Zhou was the only Communist to hold a high-level position within the Nationalist government. Zhou used his influence within the Military Committee to promote Nationalist generals that he believed were capable, and to promote cooperation with the Red Army.

In the Tai&#x27;erzhuang campaign, Zhou used his influence to ensure that the most capable Nationalist general available, Li Zongren be appointed overall commander, despite Chiang&#x27;s reservations about Li&#x27;s loyalty. When Chiang was hesitant to commit troops to the defense of Tai&#x27;erzhuang, Zhou convinced Chiang to do so by promising that the Communist Eighth Route Army would simultaneously attack the Japanese from the north, and that the New Fourth Army would sabotage the Tianjin-Pukou railroad, cutting off Japanese supplies. In the end, the defense of Tai&#x27;erzhuang was a major victory for the Nationalists, killing 20,000 Japanese soldiers and capturing a large quantity of supplies and equipment.

===Adoption of orphans===

While serving as the CCP ambassador to the KMT, the childless Zhou met and befriended numerous orphans. While in Wuhan Zhou adopted a young girl, Sun Weishi, in 1937. Sun&#x27;s mother had taken her to Wuhan after Sun&#x27;s father was executed by the KMT in 1927, during the White Terror. Zhou came upon the sixteen-year-old Sun crying outside of the Eighth Route Army Liaison Office because she had been refused permission to travel to Yan&#x27;an, due to her youth and lack of political connections. After Zhou befriended and adopted her as his daughter, Sun was able to travel to Yan&#x27;an. She pursued a career in acting and direction, and later became the first female director of spoken drama (&quot;huaju&quot;) in the PRC.

Zhou also adopted Sun&#x27;s brother, Sun Yang. After accompanying Zhou to Yan&#x27;an, Sun Yang became Zhou&#x27;s personal assistant. After the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Sun Yang became the president of Renmin University.

In 1938, Zhou met and befriended another orphan, Li Peng. Li was only three when, in 1931, his father was also killed by the Kuomintang. Zhou subsequently looked after him in Yan&#x27;an. After the war, Zhou systematically groomed Li for leadership and sent him to be educated in energy-related engineering in Moscow. Zhou&#x27;s placement of Li within the powerful energy bureaucracy shielded Li from Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution, and facilitated his eventual rise to the Premiership.

===Flight to Chongqing===
When the Japanese army approached Wuhan in the fall of 1938, the Nationalist Army engaged the Japanese in the surrounding regions for over four months, allowing the KMT to withdraw farther inland, to Chongqing, bringing with them important supplies, assets, and many refugees. While he was en route to Chongqing, Zhou was nearly killed in the &quot;fire of Changsha&quot;, which lasted for three days, destroyed two thirds of the city, killed twenty thousand civilians, and left hundreds of thousands of people homeless. This fire was deliberately caused by the retreating Nationalist army in order to prevent the city from falling to the Japanese. Due to an organizational error (it was claimed), the fire was begun without any warning to the residents of the city.

After escaping from Changsha, Zhou took refuge in a Buddhist temple in a nearby village and organized the evacuation of the city. Zhou demanded that the causes of the fire be thoroughly investigated by authorities, that those responsible be punished, that reparations be given to the victims, that the city be thoroughly cleaned up, and that accommodations be provided for the homeless. In the end, the Nationalists blamed three local commanders for the fire and executed them. Newspapers across China blamed the fire on (non-KMT) arsonists, but the blaze contributed to a nationwide loss of support for the KMT.

===Early activities in Chongqing===
Zhou Enlai reached Chongqing in December 1938, and resumed the official and unofficial operations that he had been conducting in Wuhan in January 1938. Zhou&#x27;s activities included those required by his formal positions within the Nationalist government, his running of two pro-Communist newspapers, and his covert efforts to form reliable intelligence networks and increase the popularity and organization of CCP organizations in southern China. At its peak, the staff working under him in both official and covert roles totaled several hundred people. After finding that his father, Zhou Shaogang, was unable to support himself, Zhou looked after his father in Chongqing until his father&#x27;s death in 1942.

Soon after arriving in Chongqing, Zhou successfully lobbied the Nationalist government to release Communist political prisoners. After their release, Zhou often assigned these former prisoners as agents to organize and lead Party organizations throughout southern China. The efforts of Zhou&#x27;s covert activities were extremely successful, increasing CCP membership across southern China tenfold within months. Chiang was somewhat aware of these activities and introduced efforts to suppress them but was generally unsuccessful.
In July 1939, while in Yan&#x27;an to attend a series of Politburo meetings, Zhou had an accident horseback riding in which he fell and fractured his right elbow. Because there was little medical care available in Yan&#x27;an, Zhou traveled to Moscow for medical treatment, using the occasion to brief the Comintern on the status of the united front. Zhou arrived in Moscow too late to mend the fracture, and his right arm remained bent for the rest of his life. Joseph Stalin was so displeased with the CCP&#x27;s refusal to work more closely with the Nationalists that he refused to see Zhou during his stay. Zhou&#x27;s adopted daughter, Sun Weishi, accompanied Zhou to Moscow. She remained in Moscow after Zhou left in order to study for a career in theater.

===Intelligence work in Chongqing===
On 4 May 1939, the Politburo accepted Zhou&#x27;s assessment that Zhou should focus his efforts on creating a network of secret CCP agents working covertly and for long periods. Communists were directed to join the KMT, if doing so would increase the ability of agents to infiltrate the KMT administrative, educational, economic, and military establishments. Under the cover of the Office of the Eighth Route Army (moved to a stately building on the outskirts of Chongqing), Zhou adopted a series of measures to expand the CCP intelligence network.

By the time that Zhou returned to Chongqing in May 1940, a serious rift had formed between the KMT and the CCP. Over the course of the next year, the relationship between the two parties degenerated into arrests and executions of Party members, covert attempts by agents of both sides to eliminate each other, propaganda efforts attacking each other, and major military clashes. The united front was officially abolished after the Anhui Incident in January 1941, when 9,000 Communist soldiers of the New Fourth Army were ambushed, and their commanders either killed or imprisoned by government troops.

Zhou responded to the rift between the KMT and CCP by directing Party leaders to conduct their operations more secretly. He maintained propaganda efforts via the newspapers that he directed and kept in close contact with foreign journalists and ambassadors. Zhou increased and improved CCP intelligence efforts within the KMT, Wang Jingwei&#x27;s Nanjing government, and the Empire of Japan, recruiting, training, and organizing a large network of Communist spies. Yan Baohang, a secret Party member active in Chongqing diplomatic circles, informed Zhou that German dictator Adolf Hitler was planning to attack the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941. Under Zhou&#x27;s signature, this information reached Stalin on 20 June, two days before Hitler attacked, though Stalin did not yet believe that Hitler would actually carry through with the attack.

===Economic and diplomatic activities===
Despite worsening relations with Chiang Kai-shek, Zhou operated openly in Chongqing, befriending Chinese and foreign visitors and staging public cultural activities, especially Chinese theater. Zhou cultivated a close personal friendship with General Feng Yuxiang, making it possible for Zhou to circulate freely among the officers of the Nationalist Army. Zhou befriended the General He Jifeng, and convinced He to secretly become a member of the CCP during an official visit to Yan&#x27;an. Zhou&#x27;s intelligence agents penetrated the Sichuanese army of General Deng Xihou, resulting in Deng&#x27;s secret agreement to supply ammunition to the Communist New Fourth Army. Zhou convinced another Sichuanese general, Li Wenhui, to covertly install a radio transmitter that facilitated secret communication between Yan&#x27;an and Chongqing. Zhou befriended Zhang Zhizhong and Nong Yun, commanders in the Yunnan armed forces, who became secret CCP members, agreed to cooperate with the CCP against Chiang Kai-shek, and established a clandestine radio station that broadcast Communist propaganda from the provincial government building in Kunming.

Zhou remained the primary CCP representative to the outside world during his time in Chongqing. Zhou and his aides Qiao Guanhua, Gong Peng and Wang Bingnan enjoyed receiving foreign visitors and made a favorable impression among American, British, Canadian, Russian, and other foreign diplomats. Zhou struck visitors as charming, urbane, hard-working, and living a very simple lifestyle. In 1941, Zhou received a visit from Ernest Hemingway and his wife, Martha Gellhorn. Gellhorn later wrote that she and Ernest were extremely impressed with Zhou (and extremely unimpressed with Chiang), and they became convinced that the Communists would take over China after meeting him.

Because Yan&#x27;an was incapable of funding Zhou&#x27;s activities, Zhou partially funded his efforts through donations from sympathetic foreigners, overseas Chinese, and the China Defense League (supported by Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s widow, Soong Ching-ling). Zhou also undertook to start and run a number of businesses throughout KMT- and Japanese- controlled China. Zhou&#x27;s businesses grew to include several trading companies operating in several Chinese cities (primarily Chongqing and Hong Kong), a silk and satin store in Chongqing, an oil refinery, and factories for producing industrial materials, cloths, Western medicines, and other commodities.

Under Zhou, Communist businessmen made great profits in currency trading and commodity speculation, especially in American dollars and gold. Zhou&#x27;s most lucrative business was generated by several opium plantations that Zhou established in remote areas. Although the CCP had been engaged in the eradication of opium smoking since its establishment, Zhou justified opium production and distribution in KMT-controlled areas by the huge profits generated for the CCP, and by the debilitating effects that opium addiction might have on KMT soldiers and government officials.

===Relationship with Mao Zedong===
In 1943, Zhou&#x27;s relationship with Chiang Kai-shek deteriorated, and he returned permanently to Yan&#x27;an. By then, Mao Zedong had emerged as the Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party and was attempting to have his political theories (literally &quot;Mao Zedong Thought&quot;) accepted as the Party&#x27;s dogma. Following his ascent to power, Mao organized a campaign to indoctrinate the members of the CCP. This campaign became the foundation of the Maoist personality cult that later dominated Chinese politics until the end of the Cultural Revolution.

After returning to Yan&#x27;an, Zhou Enlai was strongly and excessively criticized in this campaign. Zhou was labelled, along with the generals Peng Dehuai, Liu Bocheng, Ye Jianying, and Nie Rongzhen, as an &quot;empiricist&quot; because he had a history of cooperating with the Comintern and with Mao&#x27;s enemy, Wang Ming. Mao publicly attacked Zhou as &quot;a collaborator and assistant of dogmatism... who belittled the study of Marxism-Leninism&quot;. Mao and his allies then claimed that the CCP organizations that Zhou had established in southern China were in fact led by KMT secret agents, a charge which Zhou firmly denied, and which was only withdrawn after Mao became convinced of Zhou&#x27;s loyalty in the latest period of the campaign.

Zhou defended himself by engaging in a long series of public reflections and self-criticisms, and he gave a number of speeches praising Mao and Mao Zedong Thought and giving his unconditional acceptance of Mao&#x27;s leadership. He also joined Mao&#x27;s allies in attacking Peng Shuzhi, Chen Duxiu, and Wang Ming, who Mao viewed as enemies. The persecution of Zhou Enlai distressed Moscow, and Georgi Dimitrov wrote a personal letter to Mao indicating that &quot;Zhou Enlai... must not be severed from the Party.&quot; In the end, Zhou&#x27;s enthusiastic acknowledgement of his own faults, his praise for Mao&#x27;s leadership, and his attacks on Mao&#x27;s enemies eventually convinced Mao that Zhou&#x27;s conversion to Maoism was genuine, a precondition for Zhou&#x27;s political survival. By the seventh congress of the CCP in 1945, Mao was acknowledged as the overall leader of the CCP, and the dogma of Mao Zedong Thought was firmly entrenched among the Party&#x27;s leadership.

==Diplomatic efforts with the United States==
===Dixie Mission===

As United States began to plan for an invasion of Japan, which at that point they assumed would be based in China, American political and military leaders became eager to make contact with the Communists. In June 1944, Chiang Kai-shek reluctantly agreed to allow an American military observation group, known as the &quot;Dixie mission&quot;, to travel to Yan&#x27;an. Mao and Zhou welcomed this mission and held numerous talks in the interests of gaining American aid. They pledged support for any future American military actions to attack the Japanese in China, and attempted to convince the Americans that the CCP was committed to a united KMT-CCP government. In a gesture of goodwill, communist guerrilla units were instructed to rescue downed American airmen. By the time the Americans left Yan&#x27;an, many had become convinced that the CCP was &quot;a party seeking orderly democratic growth towards socialism&quot;, and the mission formally suggested greater cooperation between the CCP and the American military.

===1944–1945===
In 1944, Zhou wrote to General Joseph Stilwell, the American commander of the China Burma India Theater of World War II, attempting to convince Stilwell of the need for the Americans to supply the Communists, and of the Communist&#x27;s desire for a united Chinese government after the war. Stilwell&#x27;s open disenchantment with the Nationalist government in general, and with Chiang Kai-shek specifically, motivated President Franklin D. Roosevelt to remove him that same year, before Zhou&#x27;s diplomacy could be effective. Stilwell&#x27;s replacement, Patrick J. Hurley, was receptive to Zhou&#x27;s appeals, but ultimately refused to align the American military with the CCP unless the Party made concessions to the KMT, which Mao and Zhou found unacceptable. Soon after Japan surrendered in 1945, Chiang invited Mao and Zhou to Chongqing to take part in an American-endorsed peace conference.

===Chongqing negotiations===
There was widespread apprehension in Yan&#x27;an that the invitation from Chiang was a trap, and that the Nationalists were planning to assassinate or imprison the two instead. Zhou took control over Mao&#x27;s security detail, and his subsequent inspections of their plane and lodgings found nothing. Throughout the trip to Chongqing, Mao refused to enter his accommodations until they had been personally inspected by Zhou. Mao and Zhou traveled together to receptions, banquets, and other public gatherings, and Zhou introduced him to numerous local celebrities and statesmen that he had befriended during his earlier stay in Chongqing.

During the forty-three days of negotiations, Mao and Chiang met eleven times to discuss the conditions of post-war China, while Zhou worked on confirming the details of the negotiations. In the end, the negotiations resolved nothing. Zhou&#x27;s offer to withdraw the Red Army from southern China was ignored, and P.J. Hurley&#x27;s ultimatum to incorporate the CCP into the KMT insulted Mao. After Mao returned to Yan&#x27;an on 10 October 1945, Zhou stayed behind to sort out the details of the conference&#x27;s resolution. Zhou returned to Yan&#x27;an on 27 November 1945, when major skirmishes between the Communists and Nationalists made future negotiations pointless. Hurley himself subsequently announced his resignation, accusing members of the US embassy of undermining him and favoring the Communists.

===Marshall Mission===
After Harry S. Truman became President of the United States, he nominated General George C. Marshall as his special envoy to China on 15 December 1945. Marshall was charged with brokering a ceasefire between the CCP and KMT, and to influence both Mao and Chiang to abide by the Chongqing agreement, which both had signed. The top leadership within the CCP, including Zhou, viewed Marshall&#x27;s nomination as a positive development, and hoped that Marshall would be a more flexible negotiator than Hurley had been. Zhou arrived in Chongqing to negotiate with Marshall on 22 December.

The first phase of talks went smoothly. Zhou represented the Communists, Marshall represented the Americans, and Zhang Qun (later replaced by Zhang Zhizhong) represented the KMT. In January 1946 both sides agreed to cease hostilities, and to reorganize their armies on the principle of separating the army from political parties. Zhou signed these agreements in the knowledge that neither side would be able to implement these changes. Chiang delivered a speech promising political freedom, local autonomy, free elections, and the release of political prisoners. Zhou welcomed Chiang&#x27;s statements and expressed his opposition to civil war.

The leadership of the CCP viewed these agreements optimistically. On 27 January 1946 the CCP Secretariat appointed Zhou as one of eight leaders to participate in a future coalition government (other leaders included Mao, Liu Shaoqi, and Zhu De). It was suggested that Zhou be nominated as China&#x27;s vice president. Mao expressed a desire to visit the United States, and Zhou received orders to manipulate Marshall in order to advance the peace process.

Marshall&#x27;s negotiations soon deteriorated, as neither the KMT nor the CCP were willing to sacrifice any of the advantages that they had gained, to depoliticize their armies, or to sacrifice any degree of autonomy in areas their side controlled. Military clashes in Manchuria became increasingly frequent in the spring and summer of 1946, eventually forcing Communist forces to retreat after a few major battles. Government armies increased their attacks in other parts of China.

On 3 May 1946, Zhou and his wife left Chongqing for Nanjing, where the Nationalist capital returned. Negotiations deteriorated, and on 9 October Zhou informed Marshall that he no longer had the confidence of the CCP. On 11 October Nationalist troops seized the Communist city of Zhangjiakou in northern China. Chiang, confident in his ability to defeat the Communists, called the National Assembly into session without the participation of the CCP and ordered it to draft a constitution on 15 November. On 16 November Zhou held a press conference, in which he condemned the KMT for &quot;tearing up the agreements from the political consultative conference&quot;. On 19 November Zhou and the entire CCP delegation left Nanjing for Yan&#x27;an.

==Resumption of Civil War==

===Military strategist and intelligence chief===
Following the failure of negotiations, the Chinese Civil War resumed in earnest. Zhou turned his focus from diplomatic to military affairs, while retaining a senior interest in intelligence work. Zhou worked directly under Mao as his chief aide, as the vice chairman of the Military Commission of the Central Committee, and as the general chief of staff. As the head of the Urban Work Committee of the Central Committee, an agency established to coordinate work inside KMT-controlled areas, Zhou continued to direct underground activities.

A superior force of Nationalist troops captured Yan&#x27;an in March 1947, but Zhou&#x27;s intelligence agents (primarily Xiong Xianghui) were able to provide Yan&#x27;an&#x27;s commanding general, Peng Dehuai, with details of the KMT army&#x27;s troop strength, distribution, positions, air cover, and dates of deployment. This intelligence allowed Communist forces to avoid major battles and to engage Nationalist forces in a protracted campaign of guerrilla warfare that eventually led to Peng achieving a series of major victories. By February 1948 over half the KMT troops in the northwest were either defeated or exhausted. On 4 May 1948, Peng captured 40,000 army uniforms and over a million pieces of artillery. By January 1949, Communist forces seized Beijing and Tianjin and were firmly in control of north China.

===Diplomacy===
On 21 January 1949, Chiang stepped down as president of the Nationalist government and was succeeded by General Li Zongren. On 1 April 1949, Li began a series of peace negotiations with a six-member CCP delegation. The CCP delegates were led by Zhou Enlai, and the KMT delegates were led by Zhang Zhizhong.

Zhou began the negotiations by asking: &quot;Why did you go to Xikou (where Chiang had retired) to see Chiang Kai-shek before leaving Nanjing?&quot; Zhang responded that Chiang still had power, even though he had technically retired, and that his consent would be needed to finalize any agreement. Zhou responded that the CCP would not accept a bogus peace dictated by Chiang and asked whether Zhang had come with the necessary credentials to implement the terms desired by the CCP. Negotiations continued until 15 April, when Zhou produced a &quot;final version&quot; of a &quot;draft agreement for internal peace&quot;, which was essentially an ultimatum to accept CCP demands. The KMT government did not respond after five days, signaling that it was not prepared to accept Zhou&#x27;s demands.

On 21 April, Mao and Zhou issued an &quot;order to the army for country-wide advance&quot;. PLA troops captured Nanjing on 23 April and captured Li&#x27;s stronghold of Guangdong in October, forcing Li to go into exile in America. In December 1949, PLA troops captured Chengdu, the last KMT-controlled city on mainland China, forcing Chiang to evacuate to Taiwan.

==PRC diplomat and statesman==

===Diplomatic situation of the PRC in 1949===
Following the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) on 1 October 1949, Zhou was appointed both Premier of the Government Administration Council (later replaced by the State Council) and Minister of Foreign Affairs. Through the coordination of these two offices and his position as a member of the five-man standing committee of the Politburo, Zhou became the architect of early PRC foreign policy, presenting China as a new, yet responsible member of the international community. Zhou was an experienced negotiator and was respected as a senior revolutionary within China.

By the early 1950s, China&#x27;s international influence was extremely low. By the end of the Qing Dynasty in 1911, China&#x27;s pretensions of universalism had been shattered by a string of military defeats and incursions by Europeans and Japanese. By the end of Yuan Shikai&#x27;s reign and the subsequent Warlord Era, China&#x27;s international prestige had declined to &quot;almost nothing&quot;. In World War II, China&#x27;s effective role was sometimes questioned by other Allied leaders. The 1950–1953 Korean War greatly exacerbated China&#x27;s international position by fixing the United States in a position of animosity, ensuring that Taiwan would remain outside of PRC control and that the PRC would remain outside of the United Nations for the foreseeable future.

Zhou&#x27;s earliest efforts to improve the prestige of the PRC involved recruiting prominent Chinese politicians, capitalists, intellectuals, and military leaders who were not technically affiliated with the CCP. Zhou was able to convince Zhang Zhizhong to accept a position inside the PRC in 1949, after Zhou&#x27;s underground network successfully escorted Zhang&#x27;s family to Beijing. All of the other members of the KMT delegation that Zhou had negotiated with in 1949 accepted similar terms.

Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s widow, Soong Ching-ling, who was estranged from her family and who had opposed the KMT for many years, readily joined the PRC in 1949. Huang Yanpei, a prominent industrialist who had refused offers of a government post for many years, was persuaded to accept a position as vice premier in the new government. Fu Zuoyi, the KMT commander who had surrendered the Beijing garrison in 1948, was persuaded to join the PLA, and to accept a position as the minister of water conservation.

===Diplomacy with India===
Zhou&#x27;s first diplomatic successes came as the result of successfully pursuing a warm relationship, based on mutual respect, with India&#x27;s first post-independence prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. Through his diplomacy, Zhou managed to persuade India to accept China&#x27;s occupation of Tibet in 1950 and 1951. India was later persuaded to act as a neutral mediator between China and the United States during the many difficult phases of the negotiations settling the Korean War.

===The Korean War===
When the Korean War broke out on 25 June 1950, Zhou was in the process of demobilizing half of the PLA&#x27;s 5.6 million soldiers, under the direction of the Central Committee. Zhou and Mao discussed the possibility of American intervention with Kim Il Sung in May and urged Kim to be cautious if he was to invade and conquer South Korea, but Kim refused to take these warnings seriously. On 28 June 1950, after the United States pushed through a UN resolution condemning North Korean aggression and sent the Seventh Fleet to &quot;neutralize&quot; the Taiwan Strait, Zhou criticized both the UN and US initiatives as &quot;armed aggression on Chinese territory.&quot;

Although Kim&#x27;s early success led him to predict that he would win the war by the end of August, Zhou and other Chinese leaders were more pessimistic. Zhou did not share Kim&#x27;s confidence that the war would end quickly and became increasingly apprehensive that the United States would intervene. To counter the possibility of an American invasion into North Korea or China, Zhou secured a Soviet commitment to have the USSR support Chinese forces with air cover and deployed 260,000 Chinese soldiers along the North Korean border, under the command of Gao Gang, but they were strictly ordered not to move into North Korea or engage UN or USA forces unless they engaged themselves. Zhou commanded Chai Chengwen to conduct a topographical survey of Korea, and directed Lei Yingfu, Zhou&#x27;s military advisor in North Korea, to analyze the military situation there. Lei concluded that MacArthur would most likely attempt a landing at Incheon.

On 15 September 1950 MacArthur landed at Incheon, met little resistance, and captured Seoul on 25 September. Bombing raids destroyed most North Korean tanks and much of its artillery. North Korean troops, instead of withdrawing north, rapidly disintegrated. On 30 September, Zhou warned the United States that &quot;the Chinese people will not tolerate foreign aggression, nor will they supinely tolerate seeing their neighbors being savagely invaded by imperialists.&quot;

On 1 October, on the first anniversary of the PRC, South Korean troops crossed the Thirty-Eighth Parallel into North Korea. Stalin refused to become directly involved in the war, and Kim sent a frantic appeal to Mao to reinforce his army. On 2 October, the Chinese leadership continued an emergency meeting at Zhongnanhai to discuss whether China should send military aid, and these talks continued until 6 October. At the meeting, Zhou was one of the few firm supporters of Mao&#x27;s position that China should send military aid, regardless of the strength of American forces. With the endorsement of Peng Dehuai, the meeting concluded with a resolution to send military forces to Korea.

In order to enlist Stalin&#x27;s support, Zhou traveled to Stalin&#x27;s summer resort on the Black Sea on 10 October. Stalin initially agreed to send military equipment and ammunition, but warned Zhou that the USSR&#x27;s air force would need two or three months to prepare any operations and no ground troops were to be sent. In a subsequent meeting, Stalin told Zhou that he would only provide China with equipment on a credit basis, and that the Soviet air force would only operate over Chinese airspace after an undisclosed period of time. Stalin did not agree to send either military equipment or air support until March 1951.

Immediately on his return to Beijing on 18 October 1950, Zhou met with Mao Zedong, Peng Dehuai, and Gao Gang, and the group ordered the 200,000 Chinese troops along the border to enter North Korea, which they did on 25 October. After consulting with Stalin, on 13 November, Mao appointed Zhou the overall commander of the People&#x27;s Volunteer Army, a special unit of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army, China&#x27;s armed forces that would intervene in the Korean War and coordinator of the war effort, with Peng as field commander of the PVA. Orders given by Zhou to the PVA were delivered in the name of the Central Military Commission.

By June 1951, the war had reached a stalemate around the Thirty-eighth Parallel, and the two sides agreed to negotiate an armistice. Zhou directed the truce talks, which began on 10 July. Zhou chose Li Kenong and Qiao Guanhua to head the Chinese negotiating team. The negotiations proceeded for two years before reaching a ceasefire agreement in July 1953, formally signed at Panmunjom.

The Korean War was Zhou&#x27;s last military assignment. In 1952, Peng Dehuai succeeded Zhou in managing the Central Military Commission (which Zhou had headed since 1947). In 1956, after the eighth Party Congress, Zhou formally relinquished his post in the Military Commission and focused on his work in the Standing Committee, the State Council, and on foreign affairs.

===Diplomacy with China&#x27;s communist neighbors===

After Stalin died on 5 March 1953, Zhou left for Moscow and attended Stalin&#x27;s funeral four days later. Mao, curiously, decided not to travel to Moscow, possibly because no senior Soviet politician had yet travelled to Beijing, or because Stalin had rejected an offer to meet with Mao in 1948 (nevertheless, a huge memorial service in honor of Stalin was held in Beijing&#x27;s Tiananmen Square with Mao and hundreds of thousands more in attendance). While in Moscow, Zhou was notably received with considerable respect by Soviet officials, being permitted to stand with the USSR&#x27;s new leaders—Vyacheslav Molotov, Nikita Khrushchev, Georgy Malenkov, and Lavrentiy Beria—instead of with the other &quot;foreign&quot; dignitaries who attended. With these four leaders, Zhou walked directly behind the gun carriage bearing Stalin&#x27;s coffin. Zhou&#x27;s diplomatic efforts on his travel to Moscow were rewarded shortly after when, in 1954, Khrushchev himself visited Beijing to take part in the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic.

Throughout the 1950s, Zhou worked to tighten economic and political relations between China and other Communist states, coordinating China&#x27;s foreign policy with Soviet policies promoting solidarity among political allies. In 1952, Zhou signed an economic and cultural agreement with the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic, giving &quot;de facto&quot; recognition of the independence of what had been known as &quot;Outer Mongolia&quot; in Qing times. Zhou also worked to conclude an agreement with Kim Il Sung in order to help the postwar reconstruction of North Korea&#x27;s economy. Pursuing the goals of peaceful diplomacy with China&#x27;s neighbor, Zhou held amicable talks with Myanmar&#x27;s prime minister, U Nu, and promoted China&#x27;s efforts to send supplies to Ho Chi Minh&#x27;s Vietnamese rebels known as the Vietminh.

===The Geneva Conference===
In April 1954, Zhou traveled to Switzerland to attend the Geneva Conference, convened to settle the ongoing Franco-Vietnamese War. His patience and shrewdness were credited with assisting the major powers involved (the Soviets, French, Americans, and North Vietnamese) to iron out the agreement ending the war. According to the negotiated peace, French Indochina was to be partitioned into Laos, Cambodia, North Vietnam, and South Vietnam. Elections were agreed to be called within two years to create a coalition government in a united Vietnam, and the Vietminh agreed to end their guerilla activities in South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.

During one early meeting in Geneva, Zhou found himself in the same room with the staunchly anticommunist American secretary of state, John Foster Dulles. After Zhou politely offered to shake his hand, Dulles rudely turned his back and walked out of the room, saying &quot;I cannot.&quot; Zhou was interpreted by onlookers as turning this moment of possible humiliation into a small victory by giving only a small, &quot;Gallic-style&quot; shrug to this behavior. Zhou was equally effective in countering Dulles&#x27; insistence that China not be given a seat at the sessions. Furthering the impression of Chinese urbanity and civility, Zhou had lunch with British actor Charlie Chaplin, who had been living in Switzerland since being blacklisted in the United States for his radical politics.

===The Asian–African Conference===

In 1955, Zhou was a prominent participant in the Asian–African Conference held in Indonesia. The conference in Bandung was a meeting of twenty-nine African and Asian states, organized by Indonesia, Myanmar, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and India, and was called largely to promote Afro-Asian economic and cultural cooperation and to oppose colonialism or neocolonialism by either the United States or the Soviet Union in the Cold War. At the conference, Zhou skillfully gave the conference a neutral stance that made the United States appear as a serious threat to the peace and stability of the region. Zhou complained that, while China was working towards &quot;world peace and the progress of mankind&quot;, &quot;aggressive circles&quot; within the United States were actively aiding the Nationalists in Taiwan and planning to rearm the Japanese. He was widely quoted for his remark that &quot;the population of Asia will never forget that the first atom bomb was exploded on Asian soil.&quot; With the support of its most prestigious participants, the conference produced a strong declaration in favor of peace, the abolition of nuclear arms, general arms reduction, and the principle of universal representation at the United Nations.

On his way to the Bandung conference, an assassination attempt was made against Zhou when a bomb was planted on the Air India plane &quot;Kashmir Princess&quot;, chartered for Zhou&#x27;s trip from Hong Kong to Jakarta. Zhou avoided the attempt when he changed planes at the last minute, but all 11 of the flight&#x27;s other passengers were killed, with only three crew members surviving the crash. A recent study has blamed the attempt on &quot;one of the intelligence agencies of the KMT.&quot; Journalist Joseph Trento has also alleged that there was a second attempt on Zhou&#x27;s life at the Bandung conference involving &quot;a bowl of rice poisoned with a slow-acting toxin.&quot;

According to one account based on recent research, Zhou found out about the bomb on the &quot;Kashmir Princess&quot; after being warned of the plot by his own intelligence officers and did not attempt to stop it because he viewed those that died as disposable: international journalists and low-level cadres. After the crash, Zhou used the incident to warn the British about the KMT intelligence operatives active in Hong Kong and pressured Great Britain to disable the Nationalist intelligence network operating there (with himself playing a support role). He hoped that the incident would improve Britain&#x27;s relationship with the PRC, and damage Britain&#x27;s relationship with the ROC. The official explanation for Zhou&#x27;s absence on the flight, however, remains that Zhou was forced to change his schedule due to having had surgery for appendicitis.

After the Bandung conference, China&#x27;s international political situation began to gradually improve. With the help of many of the nonaligned powers who had taken part in the conference, the US-backed position economically and politically boycotting the PRC began to erode, despite continuing American pressure to follow its direction. In 1971 the PRC gained China&#x27;s seat at the United Nations.

=== Tour of Pakistan ===

Premier Enlai, on his first official visit to Pakistan, arrived in Karachi on the morning of 21 December 1956. He began by visiting the graves of the Quaid-e-Azam and Liaquat Ali Khan, where he laid floral wreaths. Following this, he arrived at PAF Station Mauripur, where he attended an air display by the Pakistan Air Force&#x27;s F-86 Sabre&#x27;s and T-33 jets.

Station Commander Group Captain Nur Khan received him, and Zhou inspected an honor guard before being introduced to the pilots participating in the display. Joined by Prime Minister H. S. Suhrawardy and C-in-C of the PAF Arthur McDonald, Zhou Enlai watched a stunning display of precision flying. Four Sabre jets broke the sound barrier, generating shock waves at an altitude of 30,000 feet, followed by air-to-ground strafing led by Wing Commander FS Hussain.

The jets also performed aerobatic maneuvers in close formation. The highlight of the event was Commander Hussain&#x27;s solo aerobatics in a T-33 at 600 miles per hour, which received enthusiastic applause. After the demonstration, Premier Zhou asked Prime Minister Suhrawardy to meet Commander Hussain. He congratulated Hussain on his performance, shook hands with him and posed for photos with the pilots. Speaking to local reporters afterward, Zhou remarked that he enjoyed the display &quot;very well&quot; and added, &quot;Your pilots are very well trained.&quot;

=== Tour of Africa ===

From December 1963 until January 1964, Zhou made diplomatic visitations to all of the North African countries. On 15 December, Zhou met with President Nasser of Egypt in an effort to further relations between the countries. Then, on 21 December, Zhou visited Algeria. At their meeting, President Ahmed Ben Bella asked for a peaceful coexistence between the two nations. On 27 December, the Tunisian government announced it intended to recognize the Chinese Communist Government after planning with the Tunisian ambassador to have Zhou visit the country for 2 days in January. On 28 December, Zhou visited Morocco and met with King Hasan II. While unconfirmed, it is believed this meeting was more economic in nature, rather than attempting to garner support for communist China.

It is also said he planned on meeting with leaders in Mali, Guinea, and Ghana.

===Position on Taiwan===
When the PRC was founded on 1 October 1949, Zhou notified all governments that any countries wishing to have diplomatic contact with the PRC must end their relationship with the leaders of the former regime on Taiwan, and support the PRC&#x27;s claim to China&#x27;s seat in the United Nations. This was the first foreign policy document issued by the new government. By 1950, the PRC was able to gain diplomatic relationships with other communist countries and with thirteen non-communist countries, but talks with most Western governments were unsuccessful.

Zhou emerged from the Bandung conference with a reputation as a flexible and open-minded negotiator. Recognizing that the United States would back the &quot;de facto&quot; independence of ROC-controlled Taiwan with military force, Zhou persuaded his government to end the shelling of Kinmen and Matsu, and to search for a diplomatic alternative to the confrontation instead. In a formal announcement in May 1955, Zhou declared that the PRC would &quot;strive for the liberation of Taiwan by peaceful means so far as it is possible.&quot; Whenever the question of Taiwan was raised with foreign statesmen, Zhou argued that Taiwan was part of China, and that the resolution of the conflict with the Taiwan authorities was an internal matter.

In 1958 the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs was passed to Chen Yi, a general with little prior diplomatic experience. After Zhou resigned his office in Foreign Affairs, the PRC diplomatic corps was reduced dramatically. Some of the staff were transferred to various cultural and educational departments to replace leading cadres who had been labelled &quot;rightists&quot; and sent to work in labor camps.

===The Shanghai communique===

By the early 1970s, Sino-American relations had begun to improve. Mao&#x27;s workers in the petroleum industry, one of China&#x27;s few growing economic sectors at the time, advised the chairman that, in order to consider growth at levels desired by the Party&#x27;s leadership, large imports of American technology and technical expertise were essential. In January 1970, the Chinese invited the American ping-pong team to tour China, initiating an era of &quot;ping-pong diplomacy&quot;.

In 1971, Zhou Enlai met secretly with President Nixon&#x27;s security advisor, Henry Kissinger, who had flown to China to prepare for a meeting between Richard Nixon and Mao Zedong. During the course of these meetings, the United States agreed to allow the transfer of American money to China (presumably from relatives in the United States), to allow American-owned ships to conduct trade with China (under foreign flags), and to allow Chinese exports into the United States for the first time since the Korean War. At the time, these negotiations were considered so sensitive that they were concealed from the American public, the State Department, the American secretary of state, and all foreign governments.

On the morning of 21 February 1972, Richard Nixon arrived in Beijing, where he was greeted by Zhou, and later met with Mao Zedong. The diplomatic substance of Nixon&#x27;s visit was resolved on 28 February, in the Shanghai Communique, which summarized both sides&#x27; positions without attempting to resolve them. The &quot;US side&quot; reaffirmed the American position that America&#x27;s involvement in the ongoing Vietnam War did not constitute &quot;outside intervention&quot; in Vietnam&#x27;s affairs, and restated its commitment to &quot;individual freedom&quot;, and pledged continued support for South Korea. The &quot;Chinese Side&quot; stated that &quot;wherever there is oppression, there is resistance&quot;, that &quot;all foreign troops should be withdrawn to their own countries&quot;, and that Korea should be unified according to the demands of North Korea. Both sides agreed to disagree on the status of Taiwan. The closing sections of the Shanghai Communique encouraged further diplomatic, cultural, economic, journalistic, and scientific exchanges, and endorsed both sides&#x27; intentions to work towards &quot;the relaxation of tensions in Asia and the world.&quot; The resolutions of the Shanghai Communique represented a major policy shift for both the United States and China.

==Great Leap Forward==

In 1958, Mao Zedong began the Great Leap Forward, aimed at increasing China&#x27;s production levels in industry and agriculture with unrealistic targets. As a popular and practical administrator, Zhou maintained his position through the Leap. Zhou has been described by Frank Dikötter as the &quot;midwife&quot; of the Great Leap Forward, who &quot;transformed nightmares into reality&quot;.

By the early 1960s, Mao&#x27;s prestige was not as high as it had once been. Mao&#x27;s economic policies in the 1950s had failed, and he had developed a lifestyle that was increasingly out of touch with many of his oldest colleagues. Among the activities that seemed contrary to his popular image were the swims in his private pool in Zhongnanhai, his many villas around China that he would travel to on a private train, his private, book-lined study, and the companionship of an ever-changing succession of enthusiastic young women whom he met either on weekly dances in Zhongnanhai or on his journeys by train. The combination of his personal eccentricities and industrialization policy failures produced criticism from such veteran revolutionaries as Liu Shaoqi, Deng Xiaoping, Chen Yun, and Zhou Enlai, who seemed less and less to share an enthusiasm for his vision of continuous revolutionary struggle.

==Cultural Revolution==
===Initial efforts of Mao and Lin===

To improve his image and power, Mao, with the help of Lin Biao, undertook a number of public propaganda efforts. Among the efforts of Mao and Lin to improve Mao&#x27;s image in the early 1960s were Lin&#x27;s publication of the &quot;Diary of Lei Feng&quot; and his compilation of &quot;Quotations from Chairman Mao&quot;. The last and most successful of these efforts was the Cultural Revolution.

Whatever its other causes, the Cultural Revolution, declared in 1966, was overtly pro-Maoist, and gave Mao the power and influence to purge the Party of his political enemies at the highest levels of government. Along with closing China&#x27;s schools and universities, it exhorted of young Chinese to destroy old buildings, temples, and art, and to attack their &quot;revisionist&quot; teachers, school administrators, party leaders, and parents. After the Cultural Revolution was announced, many of the most senior members of the CCP who had shared Zhou&#x27;s hesitation in following Mao&#x27;s direction, including President Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping, were removed from their posts almost immediately; they, along with their families, were subjected to mass criticism and humiliation.

===Political survival===
Soon after they had been removed, Zhou argued that President Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping &quot;should be allowed to come back to work&quot;, but this was opposed by Mao, Lin Biao, Kang Sheng and Chen Boda. Chen Boda even suggested that Zhou himself might be &quot;considered counter-revolutionary&quot; if he did not toe the Maoist line. Following the threats that he would share in the fate of his comrades if he did not support Mao, Zhou ceased his criticisms and began to work more closely with the chairman and his clique.

Zhou gave his backing to the establishment of radical Red Guard organizations in October 1966 and joined Chen Boda and Jiang Qing against what they considered &quot;leftist&quot; and &quot;rightist&quot; Red Guard factions. This opened the way for attacks on Liu Shaoqi, Deng Xiaoping, and Tao Zhu in December 1966 and January 1967. By September 1968, Zhou candidly described his strategy for political survival to Japanese LDP parliamentarians visiting Beijing: &quot;one&#x27;s personal opinions should advance or beat a retreat according to the direction of the majority.&quot; When he was accused of being less than enthusiastic in following Mao&#x27;s leadership, he accused himself of &quot;poor understanding&quot; of Mao&#x27;s theories, giving the appearance of compromising with forces that he secretly loathed and referred to in private as his &quot;inferno&quot;. Following the logic of political survival, Zhou worked to aid Mao, and restricted his criticisms to private conversations.

Although Zhou escaped direct persecution, he was not able to save many of those closest to him from having their lives destroyed by the Cultural Revolution. Sun Weishi, Zhou&#x27;s adopted daughter, died in 1968 after seven months of torture, imprisonment, and rape by Maoist Red Guards. In 1968, Jiang also had his adopted son (Sun Yang) tortured and murdered by Red Guards. After the end of the Cultural Revolution, Sun&#x27;s plays were re-staged as a way of criticizing the Gang of Four, whom many thought were responsible for her death.

Throughout the next decade, Mao largely developed policies while Zhou carried them out, attempting to moderate some of the excesses of the Cultural Revolution, such as preventing Beijing from being renamed &quot;East Is Red City&quot; () and the Chinese guardian lions in front of Tienanmen Square from being replaced with statues of Mao. Zhou also ordered a PLA battalion to guard the Forbidden City and protect its traditional artifacts from vandalism and destruction by Red Guards. Zhou detested the &quot;yangbanxi.&quot; Despite his best efforts, the inability to prevent many of the events of the Cultural Revolution were a great blow to Zhou. Over the last decade of his life, Zhou&#x27;s ability to implement Mao&#x27;s policies and keep the nation afloat during periods of adversity was so great that his practical importance alone was sufficient to save him (with Mao&#x27;s assistance) whenever Zhou became politically threatened. At the latest stages of the Cultural Revolution, in 1975, Zhou pushed for the &quot;Four Modernizations&quot; in order to undo the damage caused by Mao&#x27;s policies.

During the later stages of the Cultural Revolution, Zhou became a target of political campaigns orchestrated by Chairman Mao and the Gang of Four. The &quot;Criticize Lin, Criticize Confucius&quot; campaign of 1973 and 1974 was directed at Premier Zhou because he was viewed as one of the Gang&#x27;s primary political opponents. In 1975, Zhou&#x27;s enemies initiated a campaign named &quot;Criticizing Song Jiang, Evaluating &quot;the Water Margin&quot;&quot;, which encouraged the use of Zhou as an example of a political loser.

==Death==

===Illness and death===
According to a biography of Zhou by Gao Wenqian, a former researcher at the CPC&#x27;s Party Documents Research Office, Zhou was first diagnosed with bladder cancer in November 1972. Zhou&#x27;s medical team reported that with treatment, he had a high chance of recovery; however, medical treatment for the highest-ranking party members had to be approved by Mao. Mao ordered that Zhou and his wife should not be told of the diagnosis, no surgery should be performed, and no further examinations should be given.

According to Ji Chaozhu, Zhou Enlai&#x27;s personal interpreter, Henry Kissinger offered to send cancer specialists from the United States to treat Zhou, but that offer was eventually refused. By 1974, Zhou was experiencing significant bleeding in his urine. After pressure by other Chinese leaders who had learned of Zhou&#x27;s condition, Mao finally ordered a surgical operation to be performed in June 1974, but the bleeding returned a few months later, indicating metastasis of the cancer into other organs. A series of operations over the next year and a half failed to check the progress of the cancer. Zhou continued to conduct work during his stays in the hospital, with Deng Xiaoping, as the First Deputy Premier, handling most of the important State Council matters. His last major public appearance was at the first meeting of the 4th National People&#x27;s Congress on 13 January 1975, where he presented the government&#x27;s work report. He then fell out of the public eye for more medical treatment. Zhou Enlai died from cancer at 09:57 on 8 January 1976, aged 77.

Zhou was cremated at Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery and his ashes were spread over Beijing, the Miyun Reservoir, the Hai River, and the Yellow River.

===Mao&#x27;s response===
After Zhou&#x27;s death, Mao issued no statements acknowledging Zhou&#x27;s achievements or contributions and sent no condolences to Zhou&#x27;s widow, herself a senior Party leader. Mao forbade his staff from wearing black mourning armbands. Whether Mao would have attended Zhou&#x27;s funeral, which was held in the Great Hall of the People, remains in question as Mao himself was in very poor health and unable to do so in any event. Mao did, however, have a wreath sent to the funeral.

Mao attacked a proposal to have Zhou publicly declared a great Marxist, and rejected a request that he make a brief appearance at Zhou&#x27;s funeral, instructing his nephew, Mao Yuanxin, to explain that he could not attend because doing so would be seen as a public admission that he was being forced to &quot;rethink the Cultural Revolution&quot;, as Zhou&#x27;s later years had been closely associated with reversing and moderating its excesses. Mao worried that public expressions of mourning would later be directed against him and his policies and backed the &quot;five nos&quot; campaign (see below) to suppress public expressions of mourning for Zhou after the late Premier&#x27;s death.

===Memorial===

Whatever Mao&#x27;s opinion of Zhou may have been, there was general mourning among the public. Foreign correspondents reported that Beijing, shortly after Zhou&#x27;s death, looked like a ghost town. There was no burial ceremony, as Zhou had willed his ashes to be scattered across the hills and rivers of his hometown, rather than stored in a ceremonial mausoleum. With Zhou gone, it became clear how the Chinese people had revered him, and how they had viewed him as a symbol of stability in an otherwise chaotic period of history. Zhou&#x27;s death also brought condolences from nations around the world.

Vice-Premier Deng Xiaoping delivered the eulogy at Zhou&#x27;s state funeral on 15 January 1976. Although much of his speech echoed the wording of an official statement by the Central Committee immediately following Zhou&#x27;s death or consisted of a meticulous description of Zhou&#x27;s remarkable political career, near the end of the eulogy he offered a personal tribute to Zhou&#x27;s character, speaking from the heart while observing the rhetoric demanded of ceremonial state occasions. Referring to Zhou, Deng stated that:

He was open and aboveboard, paid attention to the interests of the whole, observed Party discipline, was strict in &quot;dissecting&quot; himself and good at uniting the mass of cadres, and upheld the unity and solidarity of the Party. He maintained broad and close ties with the masses and showed boundless warmheartedness towards all comrades and the people... We should learn from his fine style – being modest and prudent, unassuming and approachable, setting an example by his conduct, and living in a plain and hard-working way. We should follow his example of adhering to the proletarian style and opposing the bourgeois style of life

Spence believed this statement was interpreted at the time as a subtle criticism of Mao and the other leaders of the Cultural Revolution, who could not possibly be viewed or praised as being &quot;open and aboveboard&quot;, &quot;good at uniting the mass of cadres&quot;, for displaying &quot;warmheartedness&quot;, or for modesty, prudence, or approachability. Regardless of Deng&#x27;s intentions, the Gang of Four, and later Hua Guofeng, increased the persecution of Deng shortly after he delivered this eulogy.

===Suppression of public mourning===
After Zhou&#x27;s single official memorial ceremony on 15 January, Zhou&#x27;s political enemies within the Party officially prohibited any further displays of public mourning. The most notorious regulations prohibiting Zhou from being honored were the poorly observed and poorly enforced &quot;five nos&quot;: no wearing black armbands, no mourning wreaths, no mourning halls, no memorial activities, and no handing out photos of Zhou. Years of resentment over the Cultural Revolution, the public persecution of Deng Xiaoping (who was strongly associated with Zhou in public perception), and the prohibition against publicly mourning Zhou became associated with each other shortly after Zhou&#x27;s death, leading to popular discontent against Mao and his apparent successors (notably Hua Guofeng and the Gang of Four).

Official attempts to enforce the &quot;five nos&quot; included removing public memorials and tearing down posters commemorating his achievements. On 25 March 1976, a leading Shanghai newspaper, &quot;Wenhui Bao&quot;, published an article stating that Zhou was &quot;the capitalist roader inside the Party [who] wanted to help the unrepentant capitalist roader [Deng] regain his power&quot;. This and other propaganda efforts to attack Zhou&#x27;s image only strengthened the public&#x27;s attachment to Zhou&#x27;s memory. Between March and April 1976, a forged document circulated in Nanjing that claimed itself to be Zhou Enlai&#x27;s last will. It attacked Jiang Qing and praised Deng Xiaoping and was met with increased propaganda efforts by the government.

===The Tiananmen Incident===

Within several months after the death of Zhou, one of the most extraordinary spontaneous events in the history of the PRC occurred. On 4 April 1976, at the eve of China&#x27;s annual Qingming Festival, in which Chinese traditionally pay homage to their deceased ancestors, thousands of people gathered around the Monument to the People&#x27;s Heroes in Tiananmen Square to commemorate the life and death of Zhou Enlai. On this occasion, the people of Beijing honored Zhou by laying wreaths, banners, poems, placards, and flowers at the foot of the Monument. The most obvious purpose of this memorial was to eulogize Zhou, but Jiang Qing, Zhang Chunqiao, and Yao Wenyuan were also attacked for their alleged evil actions against the Premier. A small number of slogans left at Tiananmen even attacked Mao himself, and his Cultural Revolution.

Up to two million people may have visited Tiananmen Square on 4 April. First-hand observations of the events in Tiananmen Square on 4 April report that all levels of society, from the poorest peasants to high-ranking PLA officers and the children of high-ranking cadres, were represented in the activities. Those who participated were motivated by a mixture of anger over the treatment of Zhou, revolt against Mao and his policies, apprehension for China&#x27;s future, and defiance of those who would seek to punish the public for commemorating Zhou&#x27;s memory. There is nothing to suggest that events were coordinated from any position of leadership: it was a spontaneous demonstration reflecting widespread public sentiment. Deng Xiaoping was notably absent, and he instructed his children to avoid being seen at the square.

On the morning of 5 April, crowds gathering around the memorial arrived to discover that it had been completely removed by the police during the night, angering them. Attempts to suppress the mourners led to a violent riot, in which police cars were set on fire and a crowd of over 100,000 people forced its way into several government buildings surrounding the square.

By 6:00 pm, most of the crowd had dispersed, but a small group remained until 10:00 pm, when a security force entered Tiananmen Square and arrested them. (The reported figure of those arrested was 388 people but was rumored to be far higher.) Many of those arrested were later sentenced to &quot;people&#x27;s trial&quot; at Peking University or were sentenced to prison work camps. Incidents similar to those which occurred in Beijing on 4 and 5 April occurred in Zhengzhou, Kunming, Taiyuan, Changchun, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Guangzhou. Possibly because of his close association with Zhou, Deng Xiaoping was formally stripped of all positions &quot;inside and outside the Party&quot; on 7 April, following this &quot;Tiananmen Incident&quot;.

After ousting Hua Guofeng and assuming control of China in 1980, Deng Xiaoping released those arrested in the Tiananmen Incident as part of a broader effort to reverse the effects of the Cultural Revolution.

== Legacy ==
By the end of his lifetime, Zhou was widely viewed as representing moderation and justice in Chinese popular culture. Since his death, Zhou Enlai has been regarded as a skilled negotiator fluent in foreign languages, a master of policy implementation, a devoted revolutionary, and a pragmatic statesman with an unusual attentiveness to detail and nuance. He was also known for his tireless and dedicated work ethic, and his unusual charm and poise in public. He was reputedly the last Mandarin bureaucrat in the Confucian tradition. Zhou&#x27;s political behavior should be viewed in light of his political philosophy as well as his personality. To a large extent, Zhou epitomized the paradox inherent in a Communist politician with traditional Chinese upbringing: at once conservative and radical, pragmatic and ideological, possessed of a belief in order and harmony as well as a faith, which he developed very gradually over time, in the progressive power of rebellion and revolution.

Though a firm believer in the Communist ideal on which the People&#x27;s Republic was founded, Zhou is widely credited to have moderated the excesses of Mao&#x27;s radical policies within the limits of his power. It has been assumed that he successfully protected several imperial and religious sites of cultural significance (such as the Potala Palace in Lhasa and Forbidden City in Beijing) from the Red Guards, and shielded many top-level leaders, including Deng Xiaoping, as well as many officials, academics and artists from purges. Deng Xiaoping was quoted as saying Zhou was &quot;sometimes forced to act against his conscience in order to minimize the damage&quot; stemming from Mao&#x27;s policies.

While many earlier Chinese leaders today have been subjected to criticism inside China, Zhou&#x27;s image has remained positive and respected among contemporary Chinese. Many Chinese continue to venerate Zhou as possibly the most humane leader of the 20th century, and the CPC today promotes Zhou as a dedicated and self-sacrificing leader who remains a symbol of the Communist Party. Even historians who list Mao&#x27;s faults generally attribute the opposite qualities to Zhou: Zhou was cultured and educated whereas Mao was crude and simple; Zhou was consistent whereas Mao was unstable; Zhou was stoic whereas Mao was paranoid. Following the death of Mao, Chinese press emphasized in particular his consultative, logical, realistic, and cool-headed leadership style.
However, recent academic criticism of Zhou has focused on his late relationship with Mao, and his political activities during the Cultural Revolution, arguing that the relationship between Zhou and Mao may have been more complex than is commonly portrayed. Zhou has been depicted as unconditionally submissive and extremely loyal to Mao and his allies, going out of his way to support or permit the persecution of friends and relatives in order to avoid facing political condemnation himself. After the founding of the PRC, Zhou was unable or unwilling to protect the former spies that he had employed in the Chinese Civil War and the Second World War, who were persecuted for their wartime contacts with the enemies of the CCP. Early in the Cultural Revolution, he told Jiang Qing &quot;From now on you make all the decisions, and I&#x27;ll make sure they&#x27;re carried out,&quot; and publicly declared that his old comrade, Liu Shaoqi, &quot;deserved to die&quot; for opposing Mao. In the effort to avoid being persecuted for opposing Mao, Zhou passively accepted the political persecution of many others, including his own brother.

A popular saying within China once compared Zhou to a &quot;budaoweng&quot; (a tumbler), which can imply that he was a political opportunist. Li Zhisui, then one of Mao&#x27;s personal physicians, characterized Zhou as such and was severely critical of Zhou in his book &quot;The Private Life of Chairman Mao&quot;, describing him as &quot;Mao&#x27;s slave, absolutely obsequiously obedient... Everything he did, he did to be loyal to Mao. Neither he nor [Deng Yingchao] had a shred of independent thought&quot;. Li also described Mao&#x27;s contradictory relationship with Zhou as one where he demanded total loyalty, &quot;but because Zhou was so subservient and loyal, Mao held [Zhou] in contempt&quot;. Some observers have criticized him as being too diplomatic: avoiding clear stands in complex political situations and instead becoming ideologically elusive, ambiguous, and enigmatic. Several explanations have been offered to explain his elusiveness. Dick Wilson, the former chief editor of the Far Eastern Economic Review, writes that Zhou&#x27;s only option &quot;was to go on pretending to support the [Cultural Revolution] movement, while endeavoring to deflect its successes, blunt its mischief and stanch the wounds it was inflicting.&quot; This explanation for Zhou&#x27;s elusiveness was also widely accepted by many Chinese after his death. Wilson also writes that Zhou &quot;would have been hounded out of his position of influence, removed from control of the Government&quot; were he to &quot;make a stand and demand that Mao call off the campaign or bring the Red Guards to heel.&quot;

Zhou&#x27;s involvement in the Cultural Revolution is thus defended by many on the grounds that he had no choice other than political martyrdom. Due to his influence and political ability, the entire government may have collapsed without his cooperation. Given the political circumstances of the last decade of Zhou&#x27;s life, it is unlikely that he would have survived a purge without cultivating the support of Mao through active assistance.

Zhou received a great deal of praise from American statesmen who met him in 1971. Henry Kissinger wrote that he had been extremely impressed with Zhou&#x27;s intelligence and character, describing him as &quot;equally at home in philosophy, reminiscence, historical analysis, tactical probes, humorous repartee... [and] could display an extraordinary personal graciousness.&quot; Kissinger called Zhou &quot;one of the two or three most impressive men I have ever met,&quot; stating that &quot;his commands of facts, in particular his knowledge of American events and, for that matter, of my own background, was stunning.&quot; In his memoirs, Richard Nixon stated that he was impressed with Zhou&#x27;s exceptional &quot;brilliance and dynamism&quot;.

After coming to power, Deng Xiaoping may have overemphasized Zhou Enlai&#x27;s achievements to distance the Communist Party from Mao&#x27;s Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution, both of which had seriously weakened the Party&#x27;s prestige. Deng observed that Mao&#x27;s disastrous policies could no longer represent the Party&#x27;s finest hour, but that the legacy and character of Zhou Enlai could. Furthermore, Deng received credit for enacting successful economic policies that Zhou initially proposed. By actively associating itself with an already popular Zhou Enlai, Zhou&#x27;s legacy may have been used (and possibly distorted) as a political tool of the Party after his death.

Zhou remains a widely commemorated figure in China today. After the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Zhou ordered his hometown of Huai&#x27;an not to transform his house into a memorial and not to keep up the Zhou family tombs. These orders were respected within Zhou&#x27;s lifetime, but today his family home and traditional family school have been restored, and are visited by a large number of tourists every year. In 1998, Huai&#x27;an, in order to commemorate Zhou&#x27;s one hundredth birthday, opened a vast commemorative park with a museum dedicated to his life. The park includes a reproduction of Xihuating, Zhou&#x27;s living and working quarters in Beijing.

The city of Tianjin has established a museum to Zhou and his wife Deng Yingchao, and the city of Nanjing has erected a memorial commemorating Communist negotiations in 1946 with the Nationalist government which features a bronze statue of Zhou. Stamps commemorating the first anniversary of Zhou&#x27;s death were issued in 1977, and in 1998 to commemorate his 100th birthday.

The 2013 historical drama film The Story of Zhou Enlai features the trip of Zhou Enlai in May 1961 during the Great Leap Forward, when he investigated the rural situation in Huaxi of Guiyang and a former revolutionary base Boyan Township of Hebei.

==In popular culture==

Two rock songs refer to Zhou. In their 1969 song &quot;How-Hi-the-Li&quot;, composed by bassist Ric Grech, Family, in a satire of political figures, ask &quot;if Mr. Chou En-Lai, he gets high / With all the tea in China.&quot; Also, Zhou is one of many world figures mentioned in Billy Joel&#x27;s 1989 hit song &quot;We Didn&#x27;t Start the Fire&quot;.

<text>Duala (native name: ) is a dialect cluster spoken by the Duala and Mungo peoples of Cameroon. Duala belongs to the Bantu language family, in a subgroup called Sawabantu. It is a tonal language with subject–verb–object word order. Maho (2009) treats Duala as a cluster of five languages: Duala proper, Bodiman, Oli (Ewodi, Wuri), Pongo and Mongo. He also notes a Duala-based pidgin named &quot;Jo&quot;.

==History==
The origins of Duala come from the migrations of the Duala people during the sixteenth century from the Congo River Basin to the coastal areas of southern Cameroon. While it is a Bantu language, Guthrie estimates that it has only retained as little as 14% of the roots of Proto-Bantu.

Alfred Saker, a British missionary and linguist, completed the first translation of the Bible into Duala in 1870. After the German colonization of Cameroon in 1885, the Basel Mission promoted Duala as a lingua franca in southern Cameroon with support from the German authorities. In particular, Julius von Soden, the Governor of Cameroon in the 1880s, supported Duala as a recognized lingua franca in the colony, although he maintained that German should be the language of instruction in schools for brighter pupils. In 1903, the Basel missionaries launched a monthly journal titled Mulée Ngéa.

The missionaries&#x27; focus on using Duala in areas that did not natively speak it was viewed as dangerous by colonial officials, as they feared the practice would lead to ethnic conflict by elevating Duala to a prestige language. Since Duala was also being used by the missionaries in their schools, it was difficult for Cameroonians to become educated and obtain business, teaching, or government positions without knowledge of the language. This reinforced German officials&#x27; fears of the Duala ethnic group gaining too much power. Therefore, upon becoming Governor of Cameroon, Jesko von Puttkamer decided to suppress Duala and other local languages, such as Ewe in Togoland, and promote German in the colony instead. Puttkamer blamed the Protestant missionaries for the lack of German-language use in Cameroon, and pressured them to stop using Duala in their schools and official communications. In 1897, he began pressuring them to switch to German, and later praised the Catholic missionaries in the territory for using German.

In 1910, Governor Theodor Seitz issued an ordinance establishing governmental control over all educational establishments in the colony, including those run by missionaries. The ordinance enforced the use of German in schools and forbade the use of all other European languages. It also limited the use of Duala by missionaries to the traditional lands of the Duala people in order to prevent the spread of the language, as the German government wanted to prevent communication between local groups in the case of a revolution.

After World War I, eastern Cameroon was mandated by the League of Nations to France and western Cameroon was mandated to the United Kingdom. The French government ordered that only French could be used in schools in 1920. The British allowed the use of Duala by missionaries and schools, but English-medium schools became the norm due to the colonial governmental influence and the lack of written materials in Duala. By the 1950s, this meant that Cameroonians were using English as an instructional language and Duala as a &quot;church&quot; language, even if Duala was not their mother tongue. Through the 1960s and 1970s, as Cameroon gained independence, Duala remained in use only in religious and informal contexts, as the missionaries continued to use it and develop Duala texts for religious use.

== Usage ==
University programs in the cities of Yaoundé and Douala, as well as many local lycées, offer classes in Duala and other local languages. Duala is also used on an unofficial ad hoc basis in other schools as a medium of primary instruction to facilitate understanding. The television channel Dan Broadcasting System airs programs in Duala. However, it has been observed that attempts to introduce Duala and other local languages into schools have received some resistance from locals, as they do not view it as helpful for socio-economic development.

=== Popular culture ===
The song &quot;Soul Makossa&quot;, as well as pop songs that repeated its lyrics, internationally popularized the Duala word for &quot;(I) dance&quot;, &quot;makossa&quot;. The song &quot;Alane&quot; by artist Wes Madiko is sung in Duala and reached the #1 chart position in at least 10 European countries.

<doc id="50449" wikidata="Q180089" url="?curid=50449" title="The Economist">
<text>The Economist is a newspaper published weekly in printed magazine format and daily on digital platforms. It publishes stories on topics that include economics, business, geopolitics, technology and culture, and is mostly written and edited in Britain. Based in London, the newspaper is owned by the Economist Group, with its core editorial offices in the United States, as well as across major cities in continental Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. The newspaper has a prominent focus on data journalism and interpretive analysis over original reporting, to both criticism and acclaim.

Founded in 1843, &quot;The Economist&quot; was first circulated by Scottish economist James Wilson to muster support for abolishing the British Corn Laws (1815–1846), a system of import tariffs. Over time, the newspaper&#x27;s coverage expanded further into political economy and eventually began running articles on current events, finance, commerce, and British politics. Throughout the mid-to-late 20th century, it greatly expanded its layout and format, adding opinion columns, special reports, political cartoons, reader letters, cover stories, art critique, book reviews, and technology features. The paper is recognisable by its fire engine red masthead (nameplate) and illustrated, topical covers. Individual articles are written anonymously, with no byline, in order for the paper to speak as one collective voice. It is supplemented by its sister lifestyle magazine, &quot;1843&quot;, and a variety of podcasts, films, and books. It is considered a newspaper of record in the UK.

The editorial stance of &quot;The Economist&quot; primarily revolves around classical, social, and most notably economic liberalism. It has supported radical centrism, favouring policies and governments that maintain centrist politics. The newspaper typically champions economic liberalism, particularly free markets, free trade, free immigration, deregulation, and globalisation. Despite a pronounced editorial stance, it is seen as having little reporting bias, and as exercising rigorous fact-checking and strict copy editing. Its extensive use of word play, high subscription prices, and depth of coverage has linked the paper with a high-income and educated readership, drawing both positive and negative connotations. In line with this, it claims to have an influential readership of prominent business leaders and policy-makers.

==History==
&quot;The Economist&quot; was founded by the British businessman and banker James Wilson in 1843, to advance the repeal of the Corn Laws, a system of import tariffs. A prospectus for the newspaper from 5 August 1843 enumerated thirteen areas of coverage that its editors wanted the publication to focus on:

# Original leading articles, in which free-trade principles will be most rigidly applied to all the important questions of the day.
# Articles relating to some practical, commercial, agricultural, or foreign topic of passing interest, such as foreign treaties.
# An article on the elementary principles of political economy, applied to practical experience, covering the laws related to prices, wages, rent, exchange, revenue and taxes.
# Parliamentary reports, with particular focus on commerce, agriculture and free trade.
# Reports and accounts of popular movements advocating free trade.
# General news from the Court of St James&#x27;s, the Metropolis, the Provinces, Scotland, and Ireland.
# Commercial topics such as changes in fiscal regulations, the state and prospects of the markets, imports and exports, foreign news, the state of the manufacturing districts, notices of important new mechanical improvements, shipping news, the money market, and the progress of railways and public companies.
# Agricultural topics, including the application of geology and chemistry; notices of new and improved implements, state of crops, markets, prices, foreign markets and prices converted into English money; from time to time, in some detail, the plans pursued in Belgium, Switzerland, and other well-cultivated countries.
# Colonial and foreign topics, including trade, produce, political and fiscal changes, and other matters, including exposés on the evils of restriction and protection, and the advantages of free intercourse and trade.
# Law reports, confined chiefly to areas important to commerce, manufacturing, and agriculture.
# Books, confined chiefly, but not so exclusively, to commerce, manufacturing, and agriculture, and including all treatises on political economy, finance, or taxation.
# A commercial gazette, with prices and statistics of the week.
# Correspondence and inquiries from the newspaper&#x27;s readers.

Wilson described it as taking part in &quot;a severe contest between intelligence, which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance obstructing our progress&quot;, a phrase which still appears on its imprint (US: masthead) as the publication&#x27;s mission. It has long been respected as &quot;one of the most competent and subtle Western periodicals on public affairs&quot;. It was cited by Karl Marx in his formulation of socialist theory because Marx felt the publication epitomised the interests of the bourgeoisie. He wrote that &quot;the London &quot;Economist&quot;, the European organ of the aristocracy of finance, described most strikingly the attitude of this class.&quot; In 1915, revolutionary Vladimir Lenin referred to &quot;The Economist&quot; as a &quot;journal that speaks for British millionaires&quot;. Additionally, Lenin stated that &quot;The Economist&quot; held a &quot;bourgeois-pacifist&quot; position and supported peace out of fear of revolution.

In the currency disputes of the mid-nineteenth century, the journal sided with the Banking School against the Currency School. It criticised the Bank Charter Act 1844 which restricted the amount of bank notes that the Bank of England could issue on the basis of Currency School policy encouraged by Lord Overstone, that eventually developed into monetarism. It blamed the 1857 financial crisis in Britain on &#x27;a certain class of &quot;doctrinaires&quot;&#x27; who &#x27;refer every commercial crisis and its disastrous consequences to &quot;excessive issues of bank notes&quot;. It identified the causes of the financial crisis as variations in interest rates and a build-up of excess financial capital leading to unwise investments.
In 1920, the paper&#x27;s circulation rose to 6,170. In 1934, it underwent its first major redesign. The current fire engine red nameplate was created by Reynolds Stone in 1959. In 1971, &quot;The Economist&quot; changed its large broadsheet format into a smaller magazine-style perfect-bound formatting. In 1981 the publication introduced a North American edition after publishing the British edition since 1843; its circulation had increased more than tenfold by 2010. In January 2012, &quot;The Economist&quot; launched a new weekly section devoted exclusively to China, the first new country section since the introduction of one on the United States in 1942.

In 1991, James Fallows argued in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that &quot;The Economist&quot; used editorial lines that contradicted the news stories they purported to highlight. In 1999, Andrew Sullivan complained in &quot;The New Republic&quot; that it uses &quot;marketing genius&quot; to make up for deficiencies in original reporting, resulting in &quot;a kind of &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;&quot; for America&#x27;s corporate elite. &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that &quot;its writers rarely see a political or economic problem that cannot be solved by the trusted three-card trick of privatisation, deregulation and liberalisation&quot;.

In 2005, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; named it the best English-language paper noting its strength in international reporting where it does not feel moved to &quot;cover a faraway land only at a time of unmitigated disaster&quot; and that it kept a wall between its reporting and its more conservative editorial policies. In 2008, Jon Meacham, former editor of &quot;Newsweek&quot; and a self-described &quot;fan&quot;, criticised &quot;The Economist&quot; focus on analysis over original reporting. In 2012, &quot;The Economist&quot; was accused of hacking into the computer of Justice Mohammed Nizamul Huq of the Bangladesh Supreme Court, leading to his resignation as the chairman of the International Crimes Tribunal. In August 2015, Pearson sold its 50% stake in the newspaper to the Italian Agnelli family&#x27;s investment company, Exor, for £469 million (US$531 million) and the paper re-acquired the remaining shares for £182 million ($206 million).

=== Fossil fuel advertising ===
An investigation by the Intercept, the Nation, and DeSmog found that &quot;The Economist&quot; is one of the leading media outlets that publishes advertising for the fossil fuel industry. Journalists who cover climate change for &quot;The Economist&quot; are concerned that conflicts of interest with the companies and industries that caused climate change and obstructed action will reduce the credibility of their reporting on climate change and cause readers to downplay the climate crisis.

==Organisation==

=== Shareholders ===
 Pearson plc held a 50% shareholding via The Financial Times Limited until August 2015. At that time, Pearson sold their share in the Economist. The Agnelli family&#x27;s Exor paid £287m to raise their stake from 4.7% to 43.4% while the Economist paid £182m for the balance of 5.04m shares which will be distributed to current shareholders. Aside from the Agnelli family, smaller shareholders in the company include Cadbury, Rothschild (21%), Schroder, Layton and other family interests as well as a number of staff and former staff shareholders. A board of trustees formally appoints the editor, who cannot be removed without its permission. The Economist Newspaper Limited is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Economist Group. Sir Evelyn Robert de Rothschild was chairman of the company from 1972 to 1989.

Although &quot;The Economist&quot; has a global emphasis and scope, about two-thirds of the 75 staff journalists are based in the London borough of Westminster. However, due to half of all subscribers originating in the United States, &quot;The Economist&quot; has core editorial offices and substantial operations in New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Washington D.C.

=== Editor ===
The editor-in-chief, commonly known as simply &quot;the Editor&quot;, of &quot;The Economist&quot; is charged with formulating the paper&#x27;s editorial policies and overseeing corporate operations. Since its 1843 founding, the editors have been the following:
# James Wilson: 1843–1857
# Richard Holt Hutton: 1857–1861
# Walter Bagehot: 1861–1877
# Daniel Conner Lathbury: 1877–1881 (jointly)
# Robert Harry Inglis Palgrave: 1877–1883 (jointly)
# Edward Johnstone: 1883–1907
# Francis Wrigley Hirst: 1907–1916
# Hartley Withers: 1916–1921
# Sir Walter Layton: 1922–1938
# Geoffrey Crowther: 1938–1956
# Donald Tyerman: 1956–1965
# Sir Alastair Burnet: 1965–1974
# Andrew Knight: 1974–1986
# Rupert Pennant-Rea: 1986–1993
# Bill Emmott: 1993–2006
# John Micklethwait: 2006–2014
# Zanny Minton Beddoes: 2015–present

==Tone and voice==
Although it has many individual columns, by tradition and current practice the newspaper ensures a uniform voice—aided by the anonymity of writers—throughout its pages, as if most articles were written by a single author, which may be perceived to display dry, understated wit, and precise use of language. &quot;The Economist&quot;″s treatment of economics presumes a working familiarity with fundamental concepts of classical economics. For instance, it does not explain terms like invisible hand, macroeconomics, or demand curve, and may take just six or seven words to explain the theory of comparative advantage. Articles involving economics do not presume any formal training on the part of the reader and aim to be accessible to the educated layperson. It usually does not translate short French and German quotes or phrases but describes the business or nature of even well-known entities, writing, for example, &quot;Goldman Sachs, an investment bank&quot;. &quot;The Economist&quot; is known for its extensive use of word play, including puns, allusions, and metaphors, as well as alliteration and assonance, especially in its headlines and captions. This can make it difficult to understand for those who are not native English speakers.

&quot;The Economist&quot; has traditionally and historically persisted in referring to itself as a &quot;newspaper&quot;, rather than a &quot;news magazine&quot;, due to its mostly cosmetic switch from broadsheet to perfect-binding format and its general focus on current affairs as opposed to specialist subjects. It is legally classified as a newspaper in Britain and the United States. Most databases and anthologies catalogue the weekly as a newspaper printed in magazine- or journal-format. &quot;The Economist&quot; differentiates and contrasts itself as a newspaper against their sister lifestyle magazine, &quot;1843&quot;, which does the same in turn. Editor Zanny Minton Beddoes clarified the distinction in 2016, saying that &quot;we call it a newspaper because it was founded in 1843, 173 years ago, [when] all [perfect-bound publications] were called newspapers.&quot;

===Editorial anonymity===
&quot;The Economist&quot;″s articles often take a definite editorial stance and almost never carry a byline. Not even the name of the editor is printed in the issue. It is a long-standing tradition that an editor&#x27;s only signed article during their tenure is written on the occasion of their departure from the position. The author of a piece is named in certain circumstances: when notable persons are invited to contribute opinion pieces; when journalists of &quot;The Economist&quot; compile special reports (previously known as surveys); for the Year in Review special edition; and to highlight a potential conflict of interest over a book review. The names of &quot;The Economist&quot; editors and correspondents can be located on the media directory pages of the website. Online blog pieces are signed with the initials of the writer and authors of print stories are allowed to note their authorship from their personal web sites. One anonymous writer of &quot;The Economist&quot; observed: &quot;This approach is not without its faults (we have four staff members with the initials &#x27;J.P.&#x27;, for example) but is the best compromise between total anonymity and full bylines, in our view.&quot; According to one academic study, the anonymous ethos of the weekly has contributed to strengthening three areas for &quot;The Economist&quot;: collective and consistent voice, talent and newsroom management, and brand strength.

The editors say this is necessary because &quot;collective voice and personality matter more than the identities of individual journalists&quot;, and reflects &quot;a collaborative effort&quot;. In most articles, authors refer to themselves as &quot;your correspondent&quot; or &quot;this reviewer&quot;. The writers of the titled opinion columns tend to refer to themselves by the title (hence, a sentence in the &quot;Lexington&quot; column might read &quot;Lexington was informed...&quot;). American author and long-time reader Michael Lewis criticised the paper&#x27;s editorial anonymity in 1991, labelling it a means to hide the youth and inexperience of those writing articles. Although individual articles are written anonymously, there is no secrecy over who the writers are, as they are listed on &quot;The Economist&quot; website, which also provides summaries of their careers and academic qualifications. In 2009, Lewis included multiple &quot;Economist&quot; articles in his anthology about the 2007–2008 financial crisis, &quot;&quot;.

John Ralston Saul describes &quot;The Economist&quot; as a newspaper that &quot;hides the names of the journalists who write its articles in order to create the illusion that they dispense disinterested truth rather than opinion. This sales technique, reminiscent of pre-Reformation Catholicism, is not surprising in a publication named after the social science most given to wild guesses and imaginary facts presented in the guise of inevitability and exactitude. That it is the Bible of the corporate executive indicates to what extent received wisdom is the daily bread of a managerial civilization.&quot;

==Features==

&quot;The Economist&quot;″s primary focus is world events, politics and business, but it also runs regular sections on science and technology as well as books and the arts. Approximately every two weeks, the publication includes an in-depth special report (previously called surveys) on a given topic. The five main categories are Countries and Regions, Business, Finance and Economics, Science, and Technology. The newspaper goes to press on Thursdays, between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m. GMT, and is available at newsagents in many countries the next day. It is printed at seven sites around the world.

Since July 2007, there has also been a complete audio edition of the paper available 9 pm London time on Thursdays. The audio version of &quot;The Economist&quot; is produced by the production company &quot;Talking Issues&quot;. The company records the full text of the newspaper in MP3 format, including the extra pages in the UK edition. The weekly 130 MB download is free for subscribers and available for a fee for non-subscribers. The publication&#x27;s writers adopt a tight style that seeks to include the maximum amount of information in a limited space. David G. Bradley, publisher of &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, described the formula as &quot;a consistent world view expressed, consistently, in tight and engaging prose&quot;.

===Letters===
&quot;The Economist&quot; frequently receives letters from its readership in response to the previous week&#x27;s edition. While it is known to feature letters from senior businesspeople, politicians, ambassadors, and spokespeople, the paper includes letters from typical readers as well. Well-written or witty responses from anyone are considered, and controversial issues frequently produce a torrent of letters. For example, the survey of corporate social responsibility, published January 2005, produced largely critical letters from Oxfam, the World Food Programme, United Nations Global Compact, the Chairman of BT Group, an ex-Director of Shell and the UK Institute of Directors.

In an effort to foster diversity of thought, &quot;The Economist&quot; routinely publishes letters that openly criticize the paper&#x27;s articles and stance. After &quot;The Economist&quot; ran a critique of Amnesty International in its issue dated 24 March 2007, its letters page ran a reply from Amnesty, as well as several other letters in support of the organisation, including one from the head of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. Rebuttals from officials within regimes such as the Singapore government are routinely printed, to comply with local right-of-reply laws without compromising editorial independence.

Letters published in the paper are typically between 150 and 200 words long and had the now-discontinued salutation &#x27;Sir&#x27; from 1843 to 2015. In the latter year, upon the appointment of Zanny Minton Beddoes, the first female editor, the salutation was dismissed; letters have since had no salutation. Prior to a change in procedure, all responses to online articles were published in &quot;The Inbox&quot;.

=== Columns ===

The publication runs several opinion columns whose names reflect their topic:

*&quot;Bagehot&quot; (Britain): named for Walter Bagehot, 19th-century British constitutional expert and the third editor of &quot;The Economist&quot;. First published in 1989, since 2022, it has been written by Duncan Robinson, who succeeded Adrian Woolridge. 
*&quot;Banyan&quot; (Asia): named for the banyan tree, this column was established in April 2009 and focuses on various issues across the Asian continent and is written by Dominic Ziegler.
*&quot;Bartleby&quot; (Work and management): named after the titular character of a Herman Melville short story, this column was established in May 2018. It was written by Philip Coggan until August 2021.
*&quot;Buttonwood&quot; (Finance): named for the buttonwood tree where early Wall Street traders gathered. Until September 2006 this was available only as an on-line column, but it is now included in the print edition. Since 2018, it is written by John O&#x27;Sullivan, succeeding Philip Coggan. 
*&quot;Chaguan&quot; (China): named for Chaguan, the traditional Chinese Tea houses in Chengdu, this column was established on in September 2018. It was previously written by David Rennie, but has been suspended until the Economist has a new resident columnist in Beijing.
*&quot;Charlemagne&quot; (Europe): named for Charlemagne, the first Holy Roman Emperor. It is written by Stanley Pignal, the Economist&#x27;s Brussells bureau chief. It has previously been written by Jeremy Cliffe and earlier it was written by David Rennie (2007–2010) and by Anton La Guardia (2010–2014).
*&quot;Johnson&quot; (language): named for Samuel Johnson, this column returned to print publication in 2016 and covers language. It is written by Robert Lane Greene.
*&quot;Lexington&quot; (United States): named for Lexington, Massachusetts, the site of the beginning of the American Revolutionary War. From June 2010 until May 2012, it was written by Peter David, until his death in a car accident. The column is currently written by James Bennet.
*&quot;Schumpeter&quot; (Business): named for the economist Joseph Schumpeter, this column was established in September 2009 and is written by Patrick Foulis.
*&quot;The Telegram&quot; (International): named after the Long Telegram written by George Kennan, this column has a focus on geopolitics. It is written by David Rennie and was established in November 2024.
*&quot;Free Exchange&quot; (Economics): a general economics column, frequently based on academic research, replaced the column &quot;Economics Focus&quot; in January 2012
*&quot;Obituary&quot; (recent death): since 2003 it has been written by Ann Wroe.

=== &quot;TQ&quot; ===
Every three months, &quot;The Economist&quot; publishes a technology report called &quot;Technology Quarterly&quot;, or simply, &quot;TQ&quot;, a special section focusing on recent trends and developments in science and technology. The feature is also known to intertwine &quot;economic matters with a technology&quot;. The &quot;TQ&quot; often carries a theme, such as quantum computing or cloud storage, and assembles an assortment of articles around the common subject.

===&quot;1843&quot;===

In September 2007, &quot;The Economist&quot; launched a sister lifestyle magazine under the title &quot;Intelligent Life&quot; as a quarterly publication. At its inauguration it was billed as for &quot;the arts, style, food, wine, cars, travel and anything else under the sun, as long as it&#x27;s interesting&quot;. The magazine focuses on analysing the &quot;insights and predictions for the luxury landscape&quot; across the world. Approximately ten years later, in March 2016, the newspaper&#x27;s parent company, Economist Group, rebranded the lifestyle magazine as &quot;1843&quot;, in honour of the paper&#x27;s founding year. It has since remained at six issues per year and carries the motto &quot;Stories of An Extraordinary World&quot;. Unlike &quot;The Economist&quot;, the author&#x27;s names appear next to their articles in &quot;1843&quot;.

&quot;1843&quot; features contributions from &quot;Economist&quot; journalists as well as writers around the world and photography commissioned for each issue. It is seen as a market competitor to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;&#x27;s &quot;WSJ.&quot; and the &quot;Financial Times&quot;&#x27; &quot;FT Magazine&quot;. Since its March 2016 relaunch, it has been edited by Rosie Blau, a former correspondent for &quot;The Economist&quot;.

In May 2020 it was announced that the &quot;1843 magazine&quot; would move to a digital-only format.

=== &quot;The World Ahead&quot; ===
The paper also produces two annual reviews and predictive reports titled &quot;The World In [Year]&quot; and &quot;The World If [Year]&quot; as part of their &quot;The World Ahead&quot; franchise. In both features, the newspaper publishes a review of the social, cultural, economic and political events that have shaped the year and will continue to influence the immediate future. The issue was described by the American think tank Brookings Institution as &quot;&quot;The Economist&quot;&#x27;s annual [150-page] exercise in forecasting&quot;. An Urdu-language version of &quot;The World In [Year]&quot; in collaboration with &quot;The Economist&quot; is being distributed by Jang Group in Pakistan.

=== Country of the Year ===
In 2013, &quot;The Economist&quot; began awarding a &#x27;Country of the Year&#x27; in its annual Christmas special editions. Selected by the newspaper, this award recognises the country that was &#x27;most improved&#x27; over the preceding year.
=== Books ===

In addition to publishing its main newspaper, lifestyle magazine, and special features, &quot;The Economist&quot; also produces books with topics overlapping with that of its newspaper. The weekly also publishes a series of technical manuals (or guides) as an offshoot of its explanatory journalism. Some of these books serve as collections of articles and columns the paper produces. Often columnists from the newspaper write technical manuals on their topic of expertise; for example, Philip Coggan, a finance correspondent, authored &quot;The Economist Guide to Hedge Funds&quot; (2011).

The paper publishes book reviews in every issue, with a large collective review in their year-end (holiday) issue – published as &quot;&quot;The Economist&quot;&#x27;s Books of the Year&quot;. Additionally, the paper has its own in-house stylebook rather than following an industry-wide writing style template. All &quot;Economist&quot; writing, and publications follow &quot;The Economist Style Guide&quot;, in various editions.

===Writing competitions===
&quot;The Economist&quot; sponsors a wide array of writing competitions and prizes throughout the year for readers. In 1999, &quot;The Economist&quot; organised a global futurist writing competition, The World in 2050. Co-sponsored by Royal Dutch/Shell, the competition included a first prize of US$20,000 and publication in &quot;The Economist&quot;″s annual flagship publication, &quot;The World In&quot;. Over 3,000 entries from around the world were submitted via a website set up for the purpose and at various Royal Dutch Shell offices worldwide. The judging panel included Bill Emmott, Esther Dyson, Sir Mark Moody-Stuart, and Matt Ridley.

In the summer of 2019, they launched the Open Future writing competition with an inaugural youth essay-writing prompt about climate change. During this competition the paper accepted a submission from an artificially-intelligent computer writing program.

=== Podcasts ===
Since 2006, &quot;The Economist&quot; has produced several podcast series. The podcasts currently in production include:

* &quot;The Intelligence&quot; (general news)
* &quot;Editor&#x27;s Picks&quot; (audio recordings of published articles)
* &quot;Drum Tower&quot; (China)
* &quot;Babbage&quot; (technology)
* &quot;Money Talks&quot; (finance and business)
* &quot;Checks and Balance&quot; (American politics)
* &quot;The Weekend Intelligence&quot; (long-form reports on a single topic)

Additionally, &quot;The Economist&quot; has produced several limited-run podcast series, such as &quot;The Prince&quot; (on Xi Jinping), &quot;Next Year in Moscow&quot; (on Russian emigrants and dissidents following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine), &quot;Boss Class&quot; (on business management) and Scam Inc an 8-part series about the growing business and impact of scams.

In September 2023, &quot;The Economist&quot; announced the launch of Economist Podcasts+, a paid subscription service for its podcast offerings.

=== Espresso news app ===
In 2014 &quot;The Economist&quot; launched its short-form news app Espresso. The product offers a daily briefing from the editors, published every day of the week except Sunday. The app is available to paid subscribers and as a separate subscription.

== Data journalism ==

The presence of data journalism in &quot;The Economist&quot; can be traced to its founding year in 1843. Initially, the weekly published basic international trade figures and tables. The paper first included a graphical model in 1847—a letter featuring an illustration of various coin sizes—and its first non-epistolary chart—a tree map visualising the size of coal fields in America and England—was included in November 1854. This early adoption of data-based articles was estimated to be &quot;a 100 years before the field&#x27;s modern emergence&quot; by &quot;Data Journalism.com.&quot; Its transition from broadsheet to magazine-style formatting led to the adoption of coloured graphs, first in fire-engine-red during the 1980s and then in a thematic blue in 2001. &quot;The&quot; &quot;Economist&quot;&#x27;s editors and readers developed a taste for more data-driven stories throughout the 2000s. Starting in the late-2000s, the paper began to publish more and more articles that centred solely on charts, some of which were published online every weekday. These &quot;daily charts&quot; are typically followed by a short, 500-word explanation. In September 2009, &quot;The Economist&quot; launched a Twitter account for their Data Team.

In 2015, the data-journalism department—a dedicated team of data journalists, visualisers and interactive developers—was created to head up the paper&#x27;s data journalism efforts. The team&#x27;s output soon included election forecasting models, covering the French presidential elections of 2017 and 2022 and the US presidential and congressional elections in 2020, among others. In late-2023, the data team advertised for a political data scientist to bolster its political forecasting efforts. In order to ensure transparency in the team&#x27;s data collection and analysis &quot;The Economist&quot; maintains a corporate GitHub account to publicly disclose their models and software wherever possible. In October 2018, they introduced a &quot;Graphic Detail&quot; featuring large charts and maps in both their print and digital editions which ran until November 2023.

=== Indexes ===
Historically, the publication has also maintained a section of economic statistics, such as employment figures, economic growth, and interest rates. These statistical publications have been found to be seen as authoritative and decisive in British society. &quot;The Economist&quot; also publishes a variety of rankings seeking to position business schools and undergraduate universities among each other, respectively. In 2015, they published their first ranking of U.S. universities, focusing on comparable economic advantages. Their data for the rankings is sourced from the U.S. Department of Education and is calculated as a function of median earnings through regression analysis. Among others, the most well-known data indexes the weekly publishes are:

* The Big Mac Index: a measure of the purchasing power of currencies, first published in 1986, using the price of the hamburger in different countries. This is published twice a year since 2006, annually prior to that.
*Democracy Index: a measure of the state of democracy in the world, produced by the paper&#x27;s Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU)
* The Glass Ceiling Index: a measure of female equality in the workplace.
* The Most Dangerous Cities Index: a measure of major cities by rates of homicide.
*Commodity-Price Index: a measure of commodities, such as gold and brent oil, as well as agricultural items

== Opinions ==
The editorial stance of &quot;The Economist&quot; primarily revolves around classical, social, and most notably, economic liberalism. Since its founding, it has supported radical centrism, favouring policies and governments that maintain centrist politics. The newspaper typically champions neoliberalism, particularly free markets, free trade, free immigration, deregulation, and globalisation. When the newspaper was founded, the term &quot;economism&quot; denoted what would today be termed &quot;economic liberalism&quot;. The activist and journalist George Monbiot has described it as neoliberal while occasionally accepting the propositions of Keynesian economics where deemed more &quot;reasonable&quot;. The weekly favours a carbon tax to fight global warming. According to one former editor, Bill Emmott, &quot;the &quot;Economist&quot;″s philosophy has always been liberal, not conservative&quot;. Alongside other publications such as &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Observer&quot; and &quot;The Independent&quot;, it supports the United Kingdom becoming a republic.
Individual contributors take diverse views. &quot;The Economist&quot; favours the support, through central banks, of banks and other important corporations. This principle can, in a much more limited form, be traced back to Walter Bagehot, the third editor of &quot;The Economist&quot;, who argued that the Bank of England should support major banks that got into difficulties. Karl Marx deemed &quot;The Economist&quot; the &quot;European organ&quot; of &quot;the aristocracy of finance&quot;. The newspaper has also supported liberal causes on social issues such as recognition of gay marriages, legalisation of drugs, criticises the U.S. tax model, and seems to support some government regulation on health issues, such as smoking in public, as well as bans on smacking children. &quot;The Economist&quot; consistently favours guest worker programmes, parental choice of school, and amnesties, and once published an &quot;obituary&quot; of God. &quot;The Economist&quot; also has a long record of supporting gun control. In 2021, the paper was criticized for publishing an &quot;anti-transgender screed&quot;. In 2019, The Economist received backlash for suggesting that transgender people should be sterilized. The paper subsequently apologized for this statement.

In British general elections, &quot;The Economist&quot; has endorsed the Labour Party (in 2005 and 2024), the Conservative Party (in 2010 and 2015), and the Liberal Democrats (in 2017 and 2019), and supported both Republican and Democratic candidates in the United States. &quot;The Economist&quot; put its stance this way:

In 2008, &quot;The Economist&quot; commented that Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, the president of Argentina at the time, was &quot;Dashing hopes of change, Argentina&#x27;s new president is leading her country into economic peril and social conflict&quot;. &quot;The Economist&quot; also called for Bill Clinton&#x27;s impeachment, as well as for Donald Rumsfeld&#x27;s resignation after the emergence of the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse. Although &quot;The Economist&quot; initially gave vigorous support for the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, it later called the operation &quot;bungled from the start&quot; and criticised the &quot;almost criminal negligence&quot; of the Bush Administration&#x27;s handling of the Iraq War, while maintaining in 2007 that pulling out in the short term would be irresponsible. In an editorial marking its 175th anniversary, &quot;The Economist&quot; criticised adherents to liberalism for becoming too inclined to protect the political status quo rather than pursue reform. The paper called on liberals to return to advocating for bold political, economic and social reforms: protecting free markets, land and tax reform in the tradition of Georgism, open immigration, a rethink of the social contract with more emphasis on education, and a revival of liberal internationalism.

==Circulation==

Each of &quot;The Economist&quot; issues&#x27; official date range is from Saturday to the following Friday. &quot;The Economist&quot; posts each week&#x27;s new content online at approximately 21:00 Thursday evening UK time, ahead of the official publication date. From July to December 2019, their average global print circulation was over 909,476, while combined with their digital presence, runs to over 1.6 million. However, on a weekly average basis, the paper can reach up to 5.1 million readers, across their print and digital runs. Across their social media platforms, it reaches an audience of 35 million, as of 2016.

In 1877, the publication&#x27;s circulation was 3,700, and in 1920 it had risen to 6,000. Circulation increased rapidly after 1945, reaching 100,000 by 1970. Circulation is audited by the Audit Bureau of Circulations (ABC). From around 30,000 in 1960 it has risen to near 1 million by 2000 and by 2016 to about 1.3 million. Approximately half of all sales (54%) originate in the United States with sales in the United Kingdom making 14% of the total and continental Europe 19%. Of its American readers, two out of three earn more than $100,000 a year. &quot;The Economist&quot; has sales, both by subscription and at newsagents, in over 200 countries. &quot;The Economist&quot; once boasted about its limited circulation. In the early 1990s it used the slogan &quot;&quot;The Economist&quot; – not read by millions of people&quot;. Geoffrey Crowther, a former editor, wrote: &quot;Never in the history of journalism has so much been read for so long by so few.&quot;

==Censorship==

Sections of &quot;The Economist&quot; criticising authoritarian regimes are frequently removed from the paper by the authorities in those countries. Like many other publications, &quot;The Economist&quot; is subjected to censorship in Iran. On 15 June 2006, Iran banned the sale of &quot;The Economist&quot; when it published a map labelling the Persian Gulf simply as Gulf—a choice that derives its political significance from the Persian Gulf naming dispute.

In a separate incident, the government of Zimbabwe went further and imprisoned &quot;The Economist&quot;″s correspondent there, Andrew Meldrum. The government charged him with violating a statute on &quot;publishing untruth&quot; for writing that a woman was decapitated by supporters of the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front party. The decapitation claim was retracted, and allegedly fabricated by the woman&#x27;s husband. The correspondent was later acquitted, only to receive a deportation order. On 19 August 2013, &quot;The Economist&quot; disclosed that the Missouri Department of Corrections had censored its issue of 29 June 2013. According to the letter sent by the department, prisoners were not allowed to receive the issue because &quot;1. it constitutes a threat to the security or discipline of the institution; 2. may facilitate or encourage criminal activity; or 3. may interfere with the rehabilitation of an offender&quot;.
