<text>The House of Bourbon (, ; ) is a dynasty that originated in the Kingdom of France as a branch of the Capetian dynasty, the royal House of France. Bourbon kings first ruled France and Navarre in the 16th century. A branch descended from the French Bourbons came to rule Spain in the 18th century and is the current Spanish royal family. Further branches, descended from the Spanish Bourbons, held thrones in Naples, Sicily, and Parma. Today, Spain and Luxembourg have monarchs of the House of Bourbon.
The royal Bourbons originated in 1272, when Robert, the youngest son of King Louis IX of France, married the heiress of the lordship of Bourbon. The house continued for three centuries as a cadet branch, serving as nobles under the direct Capetian and Valois kings.

The senior line of the House of Bourbon became extinct in the male line in 1527 with the death of Duke Charles III of Bourbon. This made the junior Bourbon-Vendôme branch the genealogically senior branch of the House of Bourbon. In 1589, at the death of Henry III of France, the House of Valois became extinct in the male line. Under the Salic law, the head of the House of Bourbon, as the senior representative of the senior-surviving branch of the Capetian dynasty (first prince of the blood), became King of France as Henry IV. Bourbon monarchs then united to France the part of the Kingdom of Navarre north of the Pyrenees, which Henry&#x27;s father had acquired by marriage in 1555, ruling both until the 1792 overthrow of the monarchy during the French Revolution. Restored briefly in 1814, and definitively in 1815 after the fall of the First French Empire, the senior line of the Bourbons was finally overthrown in the July Revolution of 1830. A cadet Bourbon branch, the House of Orléans, then ruled for 18 years (1830–1848), until it too was overthrown during the French Revolution of 1848.

The princes of Condé was a cadet branch of the Bourbons descended from an uncle of Henry IV, and the princes of Conti was a cadet line of the Condé branch. Both houses, recognized as princes of the blood, were prominent French noble families, well known for their participation in French affairs, even during exile in the French Revolution, until their respective extinctions in 1830 and 1814. Consequently, since the extinction of the Capetian House of Courtenay in 1733, the Bourbons are the only extant legitimate branch of the House of Capet. Although illegitimate, the House of Braganza traces its line to the House of Capet via their descent from Robert II of France through the First House of Burgundy, then through the Portuguese House of Burgundy. Peter I of Portugal fathered an illegitimate son John I of Portugal, founder of the House of Aviz who in turn fathered an illegitimate son named Afonso, who in turn founded the extant House of Braganza.

In 1700, at the death of King Charles II of Spain, the Spanish Habsburgs became extinct in the male line. Under the will of the childless Charles II, the second grandson of King Louis XIV of France was named as his successor, to the union of the thrones of France and Spain. The prince, then Duke of Anjou, became Philip V of Spain. Permanent separation of the French and Spanish thrones was secured when France and Spain ratified Philip&#x27;s renunciation, for himself and his descendants, of the French throne in the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, and similar arrangements later kept the Spanish throne separate from those of Naples, Sicily and Parma. The Spanish House of Bourbon (rendered in Spanish as &quot;Borbón&quot; ) has been overthrown and restored several times, reigning 1700–1808, 1813–1868, 1875–1931, and since 1975. Bourbons ruled in Naples from 1734 to 1806 and in Sicily from 1735 to 1816, and in a unified Kingdom of the Two Sicilies from 1816 to 1861. They also ruled in Parma from 1731 to 1735, 1748–1802 and 1847–1859, the Kingdom of Etruria 1802–1807 and Duchy of Lucca 1814–1847.

Grand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg married Prince Felix of Bourbon-Parma, and thus her successors, who have reigned in Luxembourg since her abdication in 1964, have also been members of the House of Bourbon. Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil, regent for her father, Emperor Pedro II of Brazil, married a cadet of the Orléans line and thus their descendants, known as the Orléans-Braganza, were in the line of succession to the Brazilian throne and expected to ascend its throne had the monarchy not been abolished by a coup in 1889. All legitimate, living members of the House of Bourbon, including its cadet branches, are direct agnatic descendants of Henry IV through his son Louis XIII of France.

==Origins==
The pre-Capetian House of Bourbon was a noble family, dating at least from the beginning of the 13th century, when the estate of Bourbon was ruled by the Sire de Bourbon who was a vassal of the King of France. The term House of Bourbon (&quot;Maison de Bourbon&quot;) is sometimes used to refer to this first house and the House of Bourbon-Dampierre, the second family to rule the seigneury.

In 1272, Robert, Count of Clermont, sixth and youngest son of King Louis IX of France, married Beatrix of Bourbon, heiress to the lordship of Bourbon and member of the House of Bourbon-Dampierre. Their son Louis was made Duke of Bourbon in 1327. His descendant, the Constable of France Charles de Bourbon, was the last of the senior Bourbon line when he died in 1527. Because he chose to fight under the banner of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V and lived in exile from France, his title was discontinued after his death.

The remaining line of Bourbons henceforth descended from James I, Count of La Marche, the younger son of Louis I, Duke of Bourbon. With the death of his grandson James II, Count of La Marche in 1438, the senior line of the Count of La Marche became extinct. All future Bourbons would descend from James II&#x27;s younger brother, Louis, who became the Count of Vendôme through his mother&#x27;s inheritance. In 1525, at the death of Charles IV, Duke of Alençon, all of the princes of the blood royal were Bourbons; all remaining members of the House of Valois were members of the king&#x27;s immediate family.

In 1514, Charles, Count of Vendôme had his title raised to Duke of Vendôme. His son Antoine became King of Navarre, on the northern side of the Pyrenees, by marriage in 1555. Two of Antoine&#x27;s younger brothers were Cardinal Archbishop Charles de Bourbon and the French and Huguenot general Louis de Bourbon, 1st Prince of Condé. Louis&#x27; male-line descendants, the Princes de Condé, survived until 1830. Finally, in 1589, the House of Valois died out and Antoine&#x27;s son Henry III of Navarre became Henry IV of France.

===Rise of Henry IV===

The first Bourbon king of France was Henry IV. He was born on 13 December 1553 in the Kingdom of Navarre. Antoine de Bourbon, his father, was a ninth-generation descendant of King Louis IX of France. Jeanne d&#x27;Albret, his mother, was the Queen of Navarre and niece of King Francis I of France. He was baptized Catholic, but raised Calvinist. After his father was killed in 1562, he became Duke of Vendôme at the age of 10, with Admiral Gaspard de Coligny (1519–1572) as his regent. Seven years later, the young duke became the nominal leader of the Huguenots after the death of his uncle the Prince de Condé in 1569.

Henry succeeded to Navarre as Henry III when his mother died in 1572. That same year Catherine de&#x27; Medici, mother of King Charles IX of France, arranged for the marriage of her daughter, Margaret of Valois, to Henry, ostensibly to advance peace between Catholics and Huguenots. Many Huguenots gathered in Paris for the wedding on 24 August, but were ambushed and slaughtered by Catholics in the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day Massacre. Henry saved his own life by converting to Catholicism. He repudiated his conversion in 1576 and resumed his leadership of the Huguenots.

The period from 1576 to 1584 was relatively calm in France, with the Huguenots consolidating control of much of the south with only occasional interference from the royal government. Extended civil war erupted again in 1584, when François, Duke of Anjou, younger brother of King Henry III of France, died, leaving Navarre next in line for the throne. Thus began the War of the Three Henrys, as Henry of Navarre, Henry III, and the ultra-Catholic leader, Henry of Guise, fought a confusing three-cornered struggle for dominance. After Henry III was assassinated on 31 July 1589, Navarre claimed the throne as the first Bourbon king of France, Henry IV.

Much of Catholic France, organized into the Catholic League, refused to recognize a Protestant monarch and instead recognized Henry IV&#x27;s uncle, Charles, Cardinal de Bourbon, as rightful king, and the civil war continued. Henry won a crucial victory at Ivry on 14 March 1590 and, following the death of the Cardinal the same year, the forces of the League lacked an obvious Catholic candidate for the throne and divided into various factions. Nevertheless, as a Protestant, Henry IV was unable to take Paris, a Catholic stronghold, or to decisively defeat his enemies, now supported by the Spanish. He reconverted to Catholicism in 1593 and was crowned king retroactively to 1589 at the Cathedral of Chartres on 27 February 1594.

===Early Bourbons in France===

Henry granted the Edict of Nantes on 13 April 1598, establishing Catholicism as an official state religion but also granting the Huguenots a measure of religious tolerance and political freedom short of full equality with the practice of Catholicism. This compromise ended the religious wars in France. That same year the Treaty of Vervins ended the war with Spain, adjusted the Spanish-French border, and resulted in a belated recognition by Spain of Henry as king of France.

Ably assisted by Maximilien de Béthune, duc de Sully, Henry reduced the land tax known as the &quot;taille&quot;; promoted agriculture, public works, construction of highways, and the first French canal; started such important industries as the tapestry works of the Gobelins; and intervened in favor of Protestants in the duchies and earldoms along the German frontier. This last was to be the cause of his assassination.

Henry&#x27;s marriage to Margaret, which had produced no heir, was annulled in 1599 and he married Marie de&#x27; Medici, niece of the grand duke of Tuscany. A son, Louis, was born to them in 1601. Henry IV was assassinated on 14 May 1610 in Paris. Louis XIII was only nine years old when he succeeded his father. He was to prove a weak ruler; his reign was effectively a series of distinct regimes, depending who held the effective reins of power. At first, Marie de&#x27; Medici, his mother, served as regent and advanced a pro-Spanish policy. To deal with the financial troubles of France, Louis summoned the Estates General in 1614; this would be the last time that body met until the eve of the French Revolution. Marie arranged the 1615 marriage of Louis to Anne of Austria, the daughter of King Philip III of Spain.

In 1617, Louis conspired with Charles d&#x27;Albert, duc de Luynes to dispense with her influence, having her favorite Concino Concini assassinated on 26 April of that year. After some years of weak government by Louis&#x27;s favorites, the King made Armand Jean du Plessis, Cardinal Richelieu, a former protégé of his mother, the chief minister of France in 1624.

Richelieu advanced an anti-Habsburg policy. He arranged for Louis&#x27; sister, Henrietta Maria, to marry King Charles I of England, on 11 May 1625. Her pro-Catholic propaganda in England was one of the contributing factors to the English Civil War. Richelieu, as ambitious for France and the French monarchy as for himself, laid the ground for the absolute monarchy that would last in France until the Revolution. He wanted to establish a dominating position for France in Europe, and he wanted to unify France under the monarchy. He established the role of &quot;intendants&quot;, non-noble men whose arbitrary powers of administration were granted (and revocable) by the monarch, superseding many of the traditional duties and privileges of the noble governors.

Although it required a succession of internal military campaigns, he disarmed the fortified Huguenot towns that Henry had allowed. He involved France in the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648) against the Habsburgs by concluding an alliance with Sweden in 1631 and, actively, in 1635. He died in 1642 before the conclusion of that conflict, having groomed Cardinal Jules Mazarin as a successor. Louis XIII outlived him but by one year, dying in 1643 at the age of forty-two. After a childless marriage for twenty-three years his queen, Anne, delivered a son on 5 September 1638, whom he named Louis after himself. In the mid-18th century, the Bourbon monarchy had a faulty system for finance and taxation. Their lacking a national bank led to them taking short-term loans, and ordering financial agents to make payments in advance or in excess of tax revenues collected.

===Louis XIV and Louis XV===

Louis XIV succeeded his father at four years of age; he would go on to become the most powerful king in French history. His mother Anne served as his regent with her favorite Jules, Cardinal Mazarin, as chief minister. When Louis was age 7, Nicolas de Neufville de Villeroy became governor of the young king. The main childhood places of Louis XIV were the Palais-Royal and the nearby Hôtel de Villeroy. Mazarin continued the policies of Richelieu, bringing the Thirty Years&#x27; War to a successful conclusion in 1648 and defeating the nobility&#x27;s challenge to royal absolutism in a series of civil wars known as the Frondes. He continued to war with Spain until 1659.

In that year the Treaty of the Pyrenees was signed signifying a major shift in power, France had replaced Spain as the dominant state in Europe. The treaty called for an arranged marriage between Louis and his cousin Maria Theresa, a daughter of King Philip IV of Spain by his first wife Elisabeth, the sister of Louis XIII. They were married in 1660 and had a son, Louis, in 1661. Mazarin died on 9 March 1661 and it was expected that Louis would appoint another chief minister, as had become the tradition, but instead he shocked the country by announcing he would rule alone.

For six years Louis reformed the finances of his state and built formidable armed forces. France fought a series of wars from 1667 onward and gained some territory on its northern and eastern borders. Maria Theresa died in 1683 and the next year he secretly married the devoutly Catholic Françoise d&#x27;Aubigné, Marquise de Maintenon. Louis XIV began to persecute Protestants, undoing the religious tolerance established by his grandfather Henry IV, culminating in his revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685.

The last war waged by Louis XIV proved to be one of the most important to dynastic Europe. In 1700, King Charles II of Spain, a Habsburg, died without a son. Louis&#x27;s only legitimate son, the &quot;Grand Dauphin&quot;, as the late king&#x27;s nephew, was the closest heir; and Charles willed the kingdom to the Dauphin&#x27;s second son, the Duke of Anjou. Other powers, particularly the Austrian Habsburgs, who had the next closest claims, objected to such a vast increase in French power.

Initially, most of the other powers were willing to accept Anjou&#x27;s reign as Philip V, but Louis&#x27;s mishandling of their concerns soon drove the English, Dutch and other powers to join the Austrians in a coalition against France. The War of the Spanish Succession began in 1701 and raged for 12 years. In the end Louis&#x27;s grandson was recognized as king of Spain, but he was obliged to agree to the forfeiture of succession rights in France, the Spanish Habsburgs&#x27; other European territories were largely ceded to Austria, and France was nearly bankrupted by the cost of the struggle. Louis died on 1 September 1715 ending his seventy-two-year reign, the longest in European history.
The reign of Louis XIV was so long that he outlived both his son and eldest grandson. He was succeeded by his great-grandson Louis XV. Louis XV was born on 15 February 1710 and was thus aged only five at his ascension, the third Louis in a row to become king of France before the age of thirteen (Louis XIII became king at 9, Louis XIV at almost 5 and himself at 5). Initially, the regency was held by Philippe, Duke of Orléans, Louis XIV&#x27;s nephew, as nearest adult male to the throne. This &quot;Régence&quot; was seen as a period of greater individual expression, manifested in secular, artistic, literary and colonial activity, in contrast to the austere latter years of Louis XIV&#x27;s reign.

Following Orléans&#x27; death in 1723, the Duke of Bourbon, representative of the Bourbon-Condé cadet line, became prime minister. It was expected that Louis would marry his cousin, the daughter of King Philip V of Spain, but this engagement was broken by the duke in 1725 so that Louis could marry Marie Leszczyńska, the daughter of Stanislas, former king of Poland. Bourbon&#x27;s motive appears to have been a desire to produce an heir as soon as possible so as to reduce the chances of a succession dispute between Philip V and the Duke of Orléans in the event of the sickly king&#x27;s death. Maria was already an adult woman at the time of the marriage, while the infanta was still a young girl.
Nevertheless, Bourbon&#x27;s action brought a very negative response from Spain, and for his incompetence Bourbon was soon replaced by Cardinal André-Hercule de Fleury, the young king&#x27;s tutor, in 1726. Fleury was a peace-loving man who intended to keep France out of war, but circumstances presented themselves that made this impossible. The first cause of these wars came in 1733 when Augustus II, the elector of Saxony and king of Poland died. With French support, Stanislas was again elected king. This brought France into conflict with Russia and Austria who supported Augustus III, Elector of Saxony and son of Augustus II.

Stanislas lost the Polish crown, but he was given the Duchy of Lorraine as compensation, which would pass to France after his death in 1766. Next came the War of the Austrian Succession in 1740 in which France supported King Frederick II of Prussia against Maria Theresa, Archduchess of Austria and Queen of Hungary. Fleury died in 1743 before the conclusion of the war.

Shortly after Fleury&#x27;s death in 1745 Louis was influenced by his mistress the Marquise de Pompadour to reverse the policy of France in 1756 by creating an alliance with Austria against Prussia in the Seven Years&#x27; War. The war was a disaster for France, which lost most of her overseas possessions to the British in the Treaty of Paris (1763). Maria, his wife, died in 1768 and Louis himself died on 10 May 1774.

===French Revolution===

Louis XVI had become the Dauphin of France upon the death of his father Louis, the son of Louis XV, in 1765. He married Marie Antoinette of Austria, a daughter of Holy Roman Empress Maria Theresa, in 1770. Louis intervened in the American Revolution against Britain in 1778, but he is most remembered for his role in the French Revolution. France was in financial turmoil and Louis was forced to convene the Estates-General on 5 May 1789.

They formed the National Assembly and forced Louis to accept a constitution that limited his powers on 14 July 1789. He tried to flee France in June 1791, but was captured. The French monarchy was abolished on 21 September 1792 and a republic was proclaimed. The chain of Bourbon monarchs begun in 1589 was broken. Louis XVI was executed on 21 January 1793.

Marie Antoinette and her son, Louis, were held as prisoners. Many French royalists proclaimed him Louis XVII, but he never reigned. She was executed on 16 October 1793. He died of tuberculosis on 8 June 1795 at the age of ten while in captivity.

The French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars spread nationalism and anti-absolutism throughout Europe, and the other Bourbon monarchs were threatened. Ferdinand IV was forced to flee from Naples in 1806 when Napoleon Bonaparte deposed him and installed his brother, Joseph, as king. Ferdinand continued to rule from Sicily until 1815.

Napoleon conquered Parma in 1800 and compensated the Bourbon duke with Etruria, a new kingdom he created from the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. It was short-lived, counting only two monarchs, Louis and Louis II, as Napoleon annexed Etruria in 1807.

King Charles IV of Spain had been an ally of France. He succeeded his father, Charles III, in 1788. At first he declared war on France on 7 March 1793, but he made peace on 22 June 1795. This peace became an alliance on 19 August 1796. His chief minister, Manuel de Godoy convinced Charles that his son, Ferdinand, was plotting to overthrow him. Napoleon exploited the situation and invaded Spain in March 1808. This led to an uprising that forced Charles to abdicate on 19 March 1808 in favor of his son, who became Ferdinand VII. Napoleon forced Ferdinand to return the crown to Charles on 30 April and then convinced Charles to relinquish it to him on 10 May 1808. In turn, he gave it to his brother, Joseph, king of Naples on 6 June 1808. Joseph abandoned Naples to Joachim Murat, the husband of Napoleon&#x27;s sister. This was very unpopular in Spain and resulted in the Peninsular War, a struggle that would contribute to the downfall of Napoleon.

===Bourbon Restoration===
With the abdication of Napoleon on 11 April 1814 the Bourbon dynasty was restored to the Kingdom of France in the person of Louis XVIII, brother of Louis XVI. Napoleon escaped from exile and Louis fled in March 1815. Louis was again restored after the Battle of Waterloo on 7 July 1815.

The conservative elements of Europe dominated the post-Napoleonic age, but the values of the French Revolution could not be easily swept aside. Louis granted a constitution on 14 June 1814 to appease the liberals, but the ultra-royalist party, led by his brother, Charles, continued to influence his reign. When he died in 1824 his brother became king as Charles X much to the dismay of French liberals. In a saying ascribed to Talleyrand, &quot;they had learned nothing and forgotten nothing.&quot;

====Aftermath====
Charles passed several laws that appealed to the upper class, but angered the middle class. The situation came to a head when he appointed a new minister on 8 August 1829 who did not have the confidence of the Chamber of Deputies. The chamber censured the king on 18 March 1830 and in response Charles proclaimed the July Ordinances on 26 July 1830 intended to silence criticism against him. This resulted in the July Revolution.

As a compromise the crown was offered to Louis Philippe, duke of Orléans, a descendant of the brother of Louis XIV, and the head of the Orléanist cadet branch of the Bourbons. Agreeing to reign constitutionally and under the tricolour, he was proclaimed King of the French on 7 August 1830. The resulting regime, known as the July Monarchy, lasted until the Revolution of 1848. The Bourbon monarchy in France ended on 24 February 1848, when Louis Philippe was forced to abdicate and the short-lived Second Republic was established.

Some Legitimists refused to recognize the Orléanist monarchy. After the death of Charles in 1836 his son was proclaimed Louis XIX, though this title was never formally recognized. Charles&#x27; grandson Henri, Count of Chambord, the last Bourbon claimant of the French crown, was proclaimed by some Henry V, but the French monarchy was never restored.

Following the 1870 collapse of the Second French Empire of Emperor Napoleon III, Henri was offered a restored throne. However Chambord refused to accept the throne unless France abandoned the revolution-inspired tricolour and accepted what he regarded as the true Bourbon flag of France, featuring the fleur-de-lis. The tricolour, originally associated with the French Revolution and the First Republic, had been used by the July Monarchy, the Second Republic and both Empires; the French National Assembly could not possibly agree.

A &quot;temporary&quot; Third Republic was established, while monarchists waited for the comte de Chambord to die and for the succession to pass to Prince Philippe, Count of Paris, who was willing to accept the tricolour. Henri lived until 1883, by which time public opinion had come to accept the republic as the &quot;form of government that divides us least.&quot; His death without issue marked the extinction of the main line of the French Bourbons. Thus the head of the House of Bourbon became Juan, Count of Montizón of the Spanish line of the house who was also Carlist claimant to the throne of Spain, and had become the senior male of the dynasty by primogeniture. His heir as eldest Bourbon and head of the house is today Louis Alphonse, Duke of Anjou.

However the terms of the Peace of Utrecht forbade the descendants of Philip V of Spain from inheriting the throne of France, therefore many monarchists recognised the Orléans line as heirs to the French throne.

By an ordinance of Louis Philippe I of 13 August 1830, it was decided that the king&#x27;s children (and his sister) would continue to bear the arms of Orléans, that Louis-Philippe&#x27;s eldest son, as Prince Royal, would bear the title of Duke of Orléans, that the younger sons would continue to have their existing titles, and that the sister and daughters of the king would be styled &quot;Royal Highness&quot; and &quot;d&#x27;Orléans,&quot; but the Orléans dynasts did not take the name &quot;of France.&quot;

==Bourbons of Spain and Italy==
===Philip V===

The Spanish branch of the House of Bourbon, also known as the House of Bourbon-Anjou, was founded by Philip V. He was born in 1683 at Versailles, the second son of the Grand Dauphin, who was eldest son of Louis XIV. He was Duke of Anjou and probably never expected to be raised to a rank higher than that. However, King Charles II of Spain, dying without issue, willed the throne to his grand-nephew the Duke of Anjou, who was the younger grandson of his eldest sister Marie-Thérèse, who had married Louis XIV.

The prospect of Bourbons on both the French and Spanish thrones was resisted as creating an imbalance of power in Europe by its powers and, upon Charles II&#x27;s death on 1 November 1700, a Grand Alliance of European nations united against Philip. This was known as the War of the Spanish Succession. In the Treaty of Utrecht, signed on 11 April 1713, Philip was recognized as king of Spain but his renunciation of succession rights to France was affirmed and, of the Spanish Empire&#x27;s other European territories, Sicily was ceded to Savoy, and the Spanish Netherlands, Milan, and Naples were allotted to the Austrian Habsburgs.

Philip had two sons by his first wife. After her death, he married Elisabeth Farnese, niece of Francesco Farnese, Duke of Parma, in 1714. She presented Philip with three sons, for whom she had ambitions of securing Italian crowns. She therefore induced Philip to occupy Sardinia and Sicily in 1717.

A Quadruple Alliance of Britain, France, Austria and the Netherlands was organized on 2 August 1718 to stop him. In the Treaty of The Hague, signed on 17 February 1720, Philip renounced his conquests of Sardinia and Sicily, but he assured the ascension of his eldest son by Elisabeth to the Duchy of Parma upon the reigning duke&#x27;s death. Philip abdicated in January 1724 in favor of Louis I, his eldest son with his first wife, but Louis died in August and Philip resumed the crown.

When the War of the Polish Succession began in 1733, Philip and Elisabeth saw another opportunity to advance the claims of their sons and recover at least part of the former possessions of the Spanish crown on the Italian peninsula. Philip signed the Family Compact with Louis XV, his nephew and king of France. Charles, Duke of Parma since 1731, invaded Naples. At the conclusion of peace on 13 November 1738, control of Parma and Piacenza was ceded to Austria, which had occupied the duchies but was now forced to recognise Charles as king of Naples and Sicily. Philip also used the War of the Austrian Succession to win back control of Parma. He did not live to see it to its conclusion, however, dying in 1746.

===Ferdinand VI and Charles III===

Ferdinand VI, second son of Philip V and his first wife, succeeded his father. He was a peace-loving monarch who kept Spain out of the Seven Years&#x27; War. He died in 1759 in the midst of that conflict and was succeeded by his half-brother Charles III, already reigning as king in Naples and Sicily.

Following Spain&#x27;s victory over the Austrians at the Battle of Bitonto, it proved inexpedient to reunite Naples and Sicily to Spain, so as a compromise Charles became King of Naples, as Charles IV and VII of Sicily. Following Charles&#x27; accession to the Spanish throne in 1759, he was required, by the Treaty of Naples of 3 October 1759, to abdicate Naples and Sicily to his third son, Ferdinand, thus initiating the branch known as the Neapolitan Bourbons.

Charles revived the Family Compact with France on 15 August 1761 and joined in the Seven Years&#x27; War against Britain in 1762; the reformist policies he had espoused in Naples were pursued with similar energy in Spain, where he completely overhauled the cumbersome bureaucracy of the state. As a French ally, he opposed Britain during the American Revolution in June 1779, supplying large quantities of weapons and munitions to the rebels and keeping one third of all the British forces in the Americas occupied defending Florida and what is now Alabama, which were ultimately recaptured by Spain. Charles died in 1788.

===Bourbons of Parma===
Elisabeth Farnese&#x27;s ambitions were realized at the conclusion of the War of the Austrian Succession in 1748 when the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza, already occupied by Spanish troops, were ceded by Austria to her second son, Philip, and combined with the former Duchy of Guastalla of the Gonzagas. Elisabeth died in 1766.

==Later Bourbon monarchs outside France==


Upon the fall of the French Empire, Ferdinand I was restored to his throne in Naples, forming the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies in 1816 and founding the House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies. His subjects revolted in 1820 and he was forced to grant a constitution; Austria invaded in March 1821 at his request and revoked the constitution. He was succeeded by his son, Francis I, in 1825 and by his grandson, Ferdinand II, in 1830. A revolution in Sicily erupted in January 1848 and Ferdinand was also forced to grant a constitution. This constitution was revoked in 1849. Ferdinand was succeeded by his son, Francis II, in May 1859.

When Giuseppe Garibaldi captured Naples in 1860, Francis restored the constitution in an attempt to save his sovereignty. He fled to the fortress of Gaeta, which was besieged and captured by the Piedmontese troops in February 1861. His kingdom was incorporated into the Kingdom of Italy on 17 March 1861, after the fall the fortress of Messina (surrendered on 12 March), although the Neapolitan troops in Civitella del Tronto resisted three days longer.

After the fall of Napoleon, Napoleon&#x27;s wife, Maria Louisa, was made Duchess of Parma. As compensation, Charles Louis, the former king of Etruria, was made the Duke of Lucca. When Maria Louisa died in 1847 he was restored to Parma as Charles II. Lucca was incorporated into Tuscany. He was succeeded by his son, Charles III, and grandson, Robert I, in 1854. The people of Parma voted for a union with the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1860. After Italian unification the next year, the Bourbon dynasty in Italy was no more.

Ferdinand VII was restored to the throne of Spain in March 1814. Like his Italian Bourbon counterpart, his subjects revolted against him in January 1820 and he was forced to grant a constitution. A French army invaded in 1823 and the constitution was revoked. Ferdinand married his fourth wife, Maria Christina, the daughter of Francis I, the Bourbon king of the Two Sicilies, in 1829. Despite his many marriages he did not have a son, so in 1833 he was influenced by his wife to abolish the Salic Law so that their daughter, Isabella, could become queen depriving his brother, Don Carlos, of the throne.

Isabella II succeeded her father when he died in 1833. She was only three years old and Maria Cristina, her mother, served as regent. Maria knew that she needed the support of the liberals to oppose Don Carlos so she granted a constitution in 1834. Don Carlos found his greatest support in Catalonia and the Basque country because the constitution centralized the provinces thus denying them the autonomy they sought. He was defeated and fled the country in 1839. Isabella was declared of age in 1843 and she married her cousin Francisco de Asís, the son of her father&#x27;s brother, on 10 October 1846. A military revolution broke out against Isabella in 1868 and she was deposed on 29 September 1868. She abdicated in favor of her son, Alfonso, in 1870, but Spain was proclaimed a republic for a brief time.

When the First Spanish Republic failed the crown was offered to Isabella&#x27;s son who accepted on 1 January 1875 as Alfonso XII. The Carlist pretender Don Carlos, who returned to Spain, was defeated and resumed his exile in February 1876. Alfonso granted a new constitution in July 1876 that was more liberal than the one granted by his grandmother. His reign was cut short when he died in 1885 at the age of twenty-eight.

Alfonso XIII was born on 17 May 1886 after the death of his father. His mother, Maria Christina, the second wife of Alfonso XII served as regent. Alfonso XIII was declared of age in 1902 and he married Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg, the granddaughter of the British Queen Victoria on 31 May 1906. He remained neutral during World War I, but supported the military coup of Miguel Primo de Rivera on 13 September 1923. A movement towards the establishment of a republic began in 1930 and Alfonso fled the country on 14 April 1931. He never formally abdicated, but lived the rest of his life in exile. He died in 1941.

The Bourbon dynasty seemed finished in Spain as in the rest of the world, but it would be resurrected. The Second Spanish Republic was overthrown in the Spanish Civil War, leading to the dictatorship of Francisco Franco. He named Juan Carlos de Borbón, a grandson of Alfonso XIII, his successor in 1969. When Franco died six years later, Juan Carlos I took the throne to restore the Bourbon dynasty. The new king oversaw the Spanish transition to democracy, the Spanish Constitution of 1978 recognized the monarchy.

Since 1964 the Bourbon-Parma line has reigned agnatically though not officially in Luxembourg through Grand Dukes Jean and his son Henri. In June 2011, Luxembourg adopted absolute primogeniture, replacing the old Semi-Salic law that might have guaranteed the survival of Bourbon rule for generations. Although it is not as powerful as it once was and no longer reigns in its native country of France, the House of Bourbon is by no means extinct and has survived to the present-day world, predominantly composed of republics.

The House of Bourbon, in its surviving branches, is believed to be the oldest royal dynasty of Europe (and the oldest documented European family altogether) that is still existing in the direct male line today: The House of Capet&#x27;s male ancestors, the Robertians, go back to Robert of Hesbaye (d. 807) as their first secured ancestor and he is believed to be a direct male descendant of Charibert de Haspengau (c. 555–636). Should this be true, only the Imperial House of Japan would outmatch the Bourbon&#x27;s age, being reliably documented – as a ruling house already – from about 540. The House of Hesse traces its line back to 841, the House of Welf-Este and the House of Wettin are both emerging in the 10th century, and so do some Italian non-ruling houses like the Caetani or the Massimo family, whereas most of the other ruling families of Europe only turn up to the light of history after the year 1000.

==Surnames used==
Officially, the King of France had no family name. A prince with the rank of (Son of France) is surnamed &quot;de France&quot;; all the male-line descendants of each , however, took his main title (whether an appanage or a courtesy title) as their family or last name. However, when Louis XVI was put on trial and later &quot;guillotined&quot; (executed) by the revolutionaries National Convention in France in 1793, they somewhat contemptuously referred to him in written documents and spoken address as &quot;Citizen Louis Capet&quot; as if a &quot;commoner&quot; (referring back to the Medieval origins of the Bourbon Dynasty&#x27;s name and referring to Hugh Capet, founder of the Capetian dynasty).

Members of the House of Bourbon-Condé and its cadet branches, which never ascended to the throne, used the surname &quot;de Bourbon&quot; until their extinction in 1830.

The daughters of Gaston, Duke of Orléans, were the first members of the House of Bourbon since the accession of Henry IV to take their surname from the appanage of their father (d&#x27;Orléans). Gaston died without a male heir; his titles reverted to the crown. It was given to his nephew, Philippe I, Duke of Orléans, brother of Louis XIV, whose descendants still bear the surname.

When Philippe, grandson of Louis XIV, became King of Spain as Philip V, he gave up his French titles. As a Son of France, his actual surname was &quot;de France&quot;. However, since that surname was not heritable for descendants of rank lower than Son of France, and since Philippe had already given up his French titles, his descendants simply took the name of their royal house as their surname (&quot;de Bourbon&quot;, rendered in Spanish as &quot;&quot;).

The children of Philippe&#x27;s brother, Charles, Duke of Berry (all of whom died in infancy), were given the surname &quot;d&#x27;Alençon&quot;. He was Duke of Berry only in name, so the surname of his children was taken from his first substantial duchy.

The children of Charles Philippe, Count of Artois, brother of Louis XVI, were surnamed &quot;d&#x27;Artois&quot;. When Charles succeeded to the throne as Charles X, his son Louis Antoine became a Son of France, with the corresponding change in surname. His grandson, Henri d&#x27;Artois, being merely a Grandson of France, would use the surname until his death.

== The three dynasties of Bourbon ==

The first were the lords of Bourbon, who died out by the males in 1171, then by the women in 1216. Their coat of arms are: D&#x27;or au lion de gueules, et à l&#x27;orle de huit coquilles d&#x27;azur Nicolas Louis Achaintre, &quot;Genealogical and chronological history of the royal house of Bourbon&quot; vol. 1, ed. Didot, 1825, p. 45.

The second family formed by the marriage of the last descendant of the first family, Mathilde of Bourbon with Guy II of Dampierre, this land passed to the house of Dampierre in 1196. The coat of arms of this family is: &quot;De gueules à deux léopards d&#x27;or, avec couronne de baron&quot;, but they took the coat of arms of the previous ones. The son of Guy de Dampierre and Mahaut de Bourbon, Archambaud VIII, took the name and arms of his mother, &quot;de Bourbon&quot;, the House of Bourbon-Dampierre. By the marriage of, Agnes of Dampierre (died around 1287), with John of Burgundy, this important lordship passed to their daughter Béatrice de Bourgogne (1257–1310), lady of Bourbon, then to her husband Robert, Count of Clermont (1256–1317), and penultimate child of Saint Louis, thus possessing the land of Bourbon by &quot;the right of the woman (&quot;de iure uxoris&quot;).

The third house of Bourbon acceded to the throne of Navarre in 1555, then to the throne of France in 1589 by Henri IV. His coat of arms are: &quot;D&#x27;azur, fleurs-de-lys d&#x27;or sans nombre, l&#x27;écu brisé d&#x27;un bâton ou cotice de gueules, brochant sur le tout, avec couronne de fils de France. The name &quot; House of Bourbon &quot; was then used to describe the entire House of France, officially since 29 June 1768, date of death of Hélène de Courtenay (1689–1768), with which was extinguished the Capetian House of Courtenay, extinction which made the House of France the only branch dynasty resulting from the dukes of Bourbon.

<text>Genre () is any style or form of communication in any mode (written, spoken, digital, artistic, etc.) with socially agreed-upon conventions developed over time. In popular usage, it normally describes a category of literature, music, or other forms of art or entertainment, based on some set of stylistic criteria. Often, works fit into multiple genres by way of borrowing and recombining these conventions. Stand-alone texts, works, or pieces of communication may have individual styles, but genres are amalgams of these texts based on agreed-upon or socially inferred conventions. Some genres may have rigid, strictly adhered-to guidelines, while others may show great flexibility. The proper use of a specific genre is important for a successful transfer of information (media-adequacy).

Critical discussion of genre perhaps began with a classification system for ancient Greek literature, as set out in Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Poetics&quot;. For Aristotle, poetry (odes, epics, etc.), prose, and performance each had specific features that supported appropriate content of each genre. Speech patterns for comedy would not be appropriate for tragedy, for example, and even actors were restricted to their genre under the assumption that a type of person could tell one type of story best.

Genres proliferate and develop beyond Aristotle&#x27;s classifications— in response to changes in audiences and creators. Genre has become a dynamic tool to help the public make sense out of unpredictability through artistic expression. Given that art is often a response to a social state, in that people write, paint, sing, dance, and otherwise produce art about what they know about, the use of genre as a tool must be able to adapt to changing meanings.

==Visual arts==
The term &quot;genre&quot; is much used in the history and criticism of visual art, but in art history has meanings that overlap rather confusingly. Genre painting is a term for paintings where the main subject features human figures to whom no specific identity attachesin other words, figures are not portraits, characters from a story, or allegorical personifications. They usually deal with subjects drawn from &quot;everyday life&quot;. These are distinguished from staffage: incidental figures in what is primarily a landscape or architectural painting. &quot;Genre&quot; is also be used to refer to specialized types of art such as still-life, landscapes, marine paintings and animal paintings, or groups of artworks with other particular features in terms of subject-matter, style or iconography.

The concept of the &quot;hierarchy of genres&quot; was a powerful one in artistic theory, especially between the 17th and 19th centuries. It was strongest in France, where it was associated with the which held a central role in academic art. The genres, which were mainly applied to painting, in hierarchical order are:

* History painting, including narrative, religious, mythological and allegorical subjects
* Portrait painting
* Genre painting or scenes of everyday life
* Landscape painting (landscapists were the &quot;common footmen in the Army of Art&quot; according to the Dutch theorist Samuel van Hoogstraten) and cityscape
* Animal painting
* Still life

The hierarchy was based on a distinction between art that made an intellectual effort to &quot;render visible the universal essence of things&quot; (&quot;imitare&quot; in Italian) and that which merely consisted of &quot;mechanical copying of particular appearances&quot; (&quot;ritrarre&quot;). Idealism was privileged over realism in line with Renaissance Neo-Platonist philosophy.

==Literature==
A literary &quot;genre&quot; is a category of literary composition. Genres may be determined by literary technique, tone, content, or even (as in the case of fiction) length. Genre should not be confused with age category, by which literature may be classified as either adult, young adult, or children&#x27;s. They also must not be confused with format, such as graphic novel or picture book. The distinctions between genres and categories are flexible and loosely defined, often with subgroups.

The most general genres in literature are (in loose chronological order) epic, tragedy, comedy, novel, and short story. They can all be in the genres prose or poetry, which shows best how loosely genres are defined. Additionally, a genre such as satire might appear in any of the above, not only as a subgenre but as a mixture of genres. Finally, they are defined by the general cultural movement of the historical period in which they were composed. In popular fiction, which is especially divided by genres, genre fiction is the more usual term.

In literature, genre has been known as an intangible taxonomy. This taxonomy implies a concept of containment or that an idea will be stable forever. The earliest recorded systems of genre in Western history can be traced back to Plato and Aristotle. Gérard Genette, a French literary theorist and author of &quot;The Architext&quot;, describes Plato as creating three Imitational genres: dramatic dialogue, pure narrative, and epic (a mixture of dialogue and narrative). Lyric poetry, the fourth and final type of Greek literature, was excluded by Plato as a non-mimetic mode. Aristotle later revised Plato&#x27;s system by eliminating the pure narrative as a viable mode and distinguishing by two additional criteria: the object to be imitated, as objects could be either superior or inferior, and the medium of presentation such as words, gestures or verse. Essentially, the three categories of mode, object, and medium dialogue, epic (superior-mixed narrative), comedy (inferior-dramatic dialogue), and parody (inferior-mixed narrative). 

Genette continues by explaining the later integration of lyric poetry into the classical system during the romantic period, replacing the now removed pure narrative mode. Lyric poetry, once considered non-mimetic, was deemed to imitate feelings, becoming the third leg of a new tripartite system: lyrical, epical, and dramatic dialogue. This system, which came to &quot;dominate all the literary theory of German romanticism (and therefore well beyond)…&quot; (38), has seen numerous attempts at expansion or revision. However, more ambitious efforts to expand the tripartite system resulted in new taxonomic systems of increasing scope and complexity.

Genette reflects upon these various systems, comparing them to the original tripartite arrangement: &quot;its structure is somewhat superior to…those that have come after, fundamentally flawed as they are by their inclusive and hierarchical taxonomy, which each time immediately brings the whole game to a standstill and produces an impasse&quot; (74). Taxonomy allows for a structured classification system of genre, as opposed to a more contemporary rhetorical model of genre.

==Film==

The basic genres of film can be regarded as drama, in the feature film and most cartoons, and documentary. Most dramatic feature films, especially from Hollywood fall fairly comfortably into one of a long list of film genres such as the Western, war film, horror film, romantic comedy film, musical, crime film, and many others. Many of these genres have a number of subgenres, for example by setting or subject, or a distinctive national style, for example in the Indian Bollywood musical.

==Music==

A music genre is a conventional category that identifies pieces of music as belonging to a shared tradition or set of conventions. It is to be distinguished from &quot;musical form&quot; and &quot;musical style&quot;, although in practice these terms are sometimes used interchangeably. There are numerous genres in Western classical music and popular music, as well as musical theatre and the music of non-Western cultures. The term is now perhaps over-used to describe relatively small differences in musical style in modern rock music, that also may reflect sociological differences in their audiences. Timothy Laurie suggests that in the context of rock and pop music studies, the &quot;appeal of genre criticism is that it makes narratives out of musical worlds that often seem to lack them&quot;.

Music can be divided into different genres in several ways. The artistic nature of music means that these classifications are often arbitrary and controversial, and some genres may overlap. There are several academic approaches to genres. In his book &quot;Form in Tonal Music&quot;, Douglass M. Green lists madrigal, motet, canzona, ricercar, and dance as examples of genres from the Renaissance period. According to Green, &quot;Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Op. 61&quot; and Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Op. 64&quot; are identical in genre – both are violin concertos – but different in form. However, Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Rondo for Piano, K. 511&quot;, and the &quot;Agnus Dei&quot; from his &quot;Mass, K. 317&quot; are quite different in genre but happen to be similar in form.&quot; Some, like Peter van der Merwe, treat the terms &quot;genre&quot; and &quot;style&quot; as the same, saying that &quot;genre&quot; should be defined as pieces of music that share a certain style or &quot;basic musical language&quot;.

Others, such as Allan F. Moore, state that &quot;genre&quot; and &quot;style&quot; are two separate terms, and that secondary characteristics such as subject matter can also differentiate between genres. A music genre or subgenre may be defined by the musical techniques, the styles, the context, and content and spirit of the themes. Geographical origin is sometimes used to identify a music genre, though a single geographical category will often include a wide variety of subgenres.

Several music scholars have criticized the priority accorded to genre-based communities and listening practices. For example, Laurie argues that &quot;music genres do not belong to isolated, self-sufficient communities. People constantly move between environments where diverse forms of music are heard, advertised and accessorised with distinctive iconographies, narratives and celebrity identities that also touch on non-musical worlds.&quot;

==Popular culture and other media==
The concept of genre is often applied, sometimes rather loosely, to other media with an artistic element, such as video game genres. Genre, and numerous minutely divided subgenres, affect popular culture very significantly, not least as they are used to classify it for publicity purposes. The vastly increased output of popular culture in the age of electronic media encourages dividing cultural products by genre to simplify the search for products by consumers, a trend the Internet has only intensified.

==Linguistics==
In philosophy of language, genre figures prominently in the works of philosopher and literary scholar Mikhail Bakhtin. Bakhtin&#x27;s basic observations were of &quot;speech genres&quot; (the idea of heteroglossia), modes of speaking or writing that people learn to mimic, weave together, and manipulate (such as &quot;formal letter&quot; and &quot;grocery list&quot;, or &quot;university lecture&quot; and &quot;personal anecdote&quot;). In this sense, genres are socially specified: recognized and defined (often informally) by a particular culture or community. The work of Georg Lukács also touches on the nature of literary genres, appearing separately but around the same time (1920s–1930s) as Bakhtin. Norman Fairclough has a similar concept of genre that emphasizes the social context of the text: Genres are &quot;different ways of (inter)acting discoursally&quot; (Fairclough, 2003: 26).

A text&#x27;s genre may be determined by its:

# Linguistic function.
# Formal traits.
# Textual organization.
# Relation of communicative situation to formal and organizational traits of the text (Charaudeau and Maingueneau, 2002:278–280).

== Rhetoric ==
In the field of rhetoric, genre theorists usually understand genres as types of actions rather than types or forms of texts. On this perspective, texts are channels through which genres are enacted. Carolyn Miller&#x27;s work has been especially important for this perspective. Drawing on Lloyd Bitzer&#x27;s concept of rhetorical situation, Miller reasons that recurring rhetorical problems tend to elicit recurring responses; drawing on Alfred Schütz, she reasons that these recurring responses become &quot;typified&quot; – that is, socially constructed as recognizable types. Miller argues that these &quot;typified rhetorical actions&quot; (p. 151) are properly understood as genres.

Building off of Miller, Charles Bazerman and Clay Spinuzzi have argued that genres understood as actions derive their meaning from other genres – that is, other actions. Bazerman therefore proposes that we analyze genres in terms of &quot;genre systems&quot;, while Spinuzzi prefers the closely related concept of &quot;genre ecologies&quot;. Reiff and Bawarshi define genre analysis as a critical reading of people&#x27;s patterns of communication in different situations.

This tradition has had implications for the teaching of writing in American colleges and universities. Combining rhetorical genre theory with activity theory, David Russell has proposed that standard English composition courses are ill-suited to teach the genres that students will write in other contexts across the university and beyond. Elizabeth Wardle contends that standard composition courses do teach genres, but that these are inauthentic &quot;mutt genres&quot; that are often of little use outside composition courses.

Genre is effective as a tool in rhetoric because it allows a speaker to set the context for a rhetorical discussion. Devitt, Reiff, and Bawarshi suggest that rhetorical genres may be assigned based on careful analysis of the subject matter and consideration of the audience.

Genre is related to Ludwig Wittgenstein&#x27;s theory of Family resemblance in which he describes how genres act like a family tree, where members of a family are related, but not exact copies of one another. 

==History==
This concept of genre originated from the classification systems created by Plato. Plato divided literature into the three classic genres accepted in Ancient Greece: poetry, drama, and prose. Poetry is further subdivided into epic, lyric, and drama. The divisions are recognized as being set by Aristotle and Plato; however, they were not the only ones. Many genre theorists added to these accepted forms of poetry.

===Classical and Romance genre theory===
The earliest recorded systems of genre in Western history can be traced back to Plato and Aristotle. Gérard Genette explains his interpretation of the history of genre in &quot;The Architext&quot;. He described Plato as the creator of three imitational, mimetic genres distinguished by mode of imitation rather than content. These three imitational genres include dramatic dialogue, the drama; pure narrative, the dithyramb; and a mixture of the two, the epic. Plato excluded lyric poetry as a non-mimetic, imitational mode. Genette further discussed how Aristotle revised Plato&#x27;s system by first eliminating the pure narrative as a viable mode. He then uses two additional criteria to distinguish the system. The first of the criteria is the object to be imitated, whether superior or inferior. The second criterion is the medium of presentation: words, gestures, or verse. Essentially, the three categories of mode, object, and medium can be visualized along an XYZ axis. Excluding the criteria of medium, Aristotle&#x27;s system distinguished four types of classical genres: tragedy, epic, comedy, and parody.

Genette explained the integration of lyric poetry into the classical system by replacing the removed pure narrative mode. Lyric poetry, once considered non-mimetic, was deemed to imitate feelings, becoming the third &quot;Architext&quot;, a term coined by Gennette, of a new long-enduring tripartite system: lyrical; epical, the mixed narrative; and dramatic, the dialogue. This new system that came to &quot;dominate all the literary theory of German romanticism&quot; (Genette 38) has seen numerous attempts at expansion and revision. Such attempts include Friedrich Schlegel&#x27;s triad of subjective form, the lyric; objective form, the dramatic; and subjective-objective form, the epic. However, more ambitious efforts to expand the tripartite system resulted in new taxonomic systems of increasing complexity. Gennette reflected upon these various systems, comparing them to the original tripartite arrangement: &quot;its structure is somewhat superior to most of those that have come after, fundamentally flawed as they are by their inclusive and hierarchical taxonomy, which each time immediately brings the whole game to a standstill and produces an impasse&quot;.

==Audiences==
Although genres are not always precisely definable, genre considerations are one of the most important factors in determining what a person will see or read. The classification properties of genre can attract or repel potential users depending on the individual&#x27;s understanding of a genre.

Genre creates an expectation in that expectation is met or not. Many genres have built-in audiences and corresponding publications that support them, such as magazines and websites. Inversely, audiences may call out for change in an antecedent genre and create an entirely new genre.

The term may be used in categorizing web pages, like &quot;news page&quot; and &quot;fan page&quot;, with both very different layout, audience, and intention (Rosso, 2008). Some search engines like Vivísimo try to group found web pages into automated categories in an attempt to show various genres the search hits might fit.

==Subgenre==
A subgenre is a subordinate within a genre, Two stories being the same genre can still sometimes differ in subgenre. For example, if a fantasy story has darker and more frightening elements of fantasy, it would belong in the subgenre of dark fantasy; whereas another fantasy story that features magic swords and wizards would belong to the subgenre of sword and sorcery.

==Microgenre==

A microgenre is a highly specialized, narrow classification of a cultural practice. The term has come into usage in the 21st century, and most commonly refers to music. It is also associated with the hyper-specific categories used in recommendations for television shows and movies on digital streaming platforms such as Netflix, and is sometimes used more broadly by scholars analyzing niche forms in other periods and other media.

<text>In physics and materials science, ferroelectricity is a characteristic of certain materials that have a spontaneous electric polarization that can be reversed by the application of an external electric field. All ferroelectrics are also piezoelectric and pyroelectric, with the additional property that their natural electrical polarization is reversible. The term is used in analogy to ferromagnetism, in which a material exhibits a permanent magnetic moment. Ferromagnetism was already known when ferroelectricity was discovered in 1920 in Rochelle salt by American physicist Joseph Valasek. Thus, the prefix &quot;ferro&quot;, meaning iron, was used to describe the property despite the fact that most ferroelectric materials do not contain iron. Materials that are both ferroelectric &quot;and&quot; ferromagnetic are known as multiferroics.

==Polarization==

When most materials are electrically polarized, the polarization induced, &quot;P&quot;, is almost exactly proportional to the applied external electric field &quot;E&quot;; so the polarization is a linear function. This is called linear dielectric polarization (see figure). Some materials, known as paraelectric materials, show a more enhanced nonlinear polarization (see figure). The electric permittivity, corresponding to the slope of the polarization curve, is not constant as in linear dielectrics but is a function of the external electric field.

In addition to being nonlinear, ferroelectric materials demonstrate a spontaneous nonzero polarization (after entrainment, see figure) even when the applied field &quot;E&quot; is zero. The distinguishing feature of ferroelectrics is that the spontaneous polarization can be &quot;reversed&quot; by a suitably strong applied electric field in the opposite direction; the polarization is therefore dependent not only on the current electric field but also on its history, yielding a hysteresis loop. They are called ferroelectrics by analogy to ferromagnetic materials, which have spontaneous magnetization and exhibit similar hysteresis loops.

Typically, materials demonstrate ferroelectricity only below a certain phase transition temperature, called the Curie temperature (&quot;T&quot;C) and are paraelectric above this temperature: the spontaneous polarization vanishes, and the ferroelectric crystal transforms into the paraelectric state. Many ferroelectrics lose their pyroelectric properties above &quot;T&quot;C completely, because their paraelectric phase has a centrosymmetric crystal structure.

==Applications==
The nonlinear nature of ferroelectric materials can be used to make capacitors with adjustable capacitance. Typically, a ferroelectric capacitor simply consists of a pair of electrodes sandwiching a layer of ferroelectric material. The permittivity of ferroelectrics is not only adjustable but commonly also very high, especially when close to the phase transition temperature. Because of this, ferroelectric capacitors are small in physical size compared to dielectric (non-tunable) capacitors of similar capacitance.

The spontaneous polarization of ferroelectric materials implies a hysteresis effect which can be used as a memory function, and ferroelectric capacitors are indeed used to make ferroelectric RAM for computers and RFID cards. In these applications thin films of ferroelectric materials are typically used, as this allows the field required to switch the polarization to be achieved with a moderate voltage. However, when using thin films a great deal of attention needs to be paid to the interfaces, electrodes and sample quality for devices to work reliably.

Ferroelectric materials are required by symmetry considerations to be also piezoelectric and pyroelectric. The combined properties of memory, piezoelectricity, and pyroelectricity make ferroelectric capacitors very useful, e.g. for sensor applications. Ferroelectric capacitors are used in medical ultrasound machines (the capacitors generate and then listen for the ultrasound ping used to image the internal organs of a body), high quality infrared cameras (the infrared image is projected onto a two dimensional array of ferroelectric capacitors capable of detecting temperature differences as small as millionths of a degree Celsius), fire sensors, sonar, vibration sensors, and even fuel injectors on diesel engines.

Another idea of recent interest is the &quot;ferroelectric tunnel junction&quot; (&quot;FTJ&quot;) in which a contact is made up by nanometer-thick ferroelectric film placed between metal electrodes. The thickness of the ferroelectric layer is small enough to allow tunneling of electrons. The piezoelectric and interface effects as well as the depolarization field may lead to a giant electroresistance (GER) switching effect.

Yet another burgeoning application is multiferroics, where researchers are looking for ways to couple magnetic and ferroelectric ordering within a material or heterostructure; there are several recent reviews on this topic.

Catalytic properties of ferroelectrics have been studied since 1952 when Parravano observed anomalies in CO oxidation rates over ferroelectric sodium and potassium niobates near the Curie temperature of these materials. Surface-perpendicular component of the ferroelectric polarization can dope polarization-dependent charges on surfaces of ferroelectric materials, changing their chemistry. This opens the possibility of performing catalysis beyond the limits of the Sabatier principle. Sabatier principle states that the surface-adsorbates interaction has to be an optimal amount: not too weak to be inert toward the reactants and not too strong to poison the surface and avoid desorption of the products: a compromise situation. This set of optimum interactions is usually referred to as &quot;top of the volcano&quot; in activity volcano plots. On the other hand, ferroelectric polarization-dependent chemistry can offer the possibility of switching the surface—adsorbates interaction from strong adsorption to strong desorption, thus a compromise between desorption and adsorption is no longer needed. Ferroelectric polarization can also act as an energy harvester. Polarization can help the separation of photo-generated electron-hole pairs, leading to enhanced photocatalysis. Also, due to pyroelectric and piezoelectric effects under varying temperature (heating/cooling cycles) or varying strain (vibrations) conditions extra charges can appear on the surface and drive various (electro)chemical reactions forward.

Photoferroelectric imaging is a technique to record optical information on pieces of ferroelectric material. The images are nonvolatile and selectively erasable.

==Materials==
The internal electric dipoles of a ferroelectric material are coupled to the material lattice so anything that changes the lattice will change the strength of the dipoles (in other words, a change in the spontaneous polarization). The change in the spontaneous polarization results in a change in the surface charge. This can cause current flow in the case of a ferroelectric capacitor even without the presence of an external voltage across the capacitor. Two stimuli that will change the lattice dimensions of a material are force and temperature. The generation of a surface charge in response to the application of an external stress to a material is called piezoelectricity. A change in the spontaneous polarization of a material in response to a change in temperature is called pyroelectricity.

Generally, there are 230 space groups among which 32 crystalline classes can be found in crystals. There are 21 non-centrosymmetric classes, within which 20 are piezoelectric. Among the piezoelectric classes, 10 have a spontaneous electric polarization which varies with temperature; thus they are pyroelectric. Ferroelectricity is a subset of pyroelectricity, which brings spontaneous electronic polarization to the material.

Ferroelectric phase transitions are often characterized as either displacive (such as BaTiO3) or order-disorder (such as NaNO2), though often phase transitions will demonstrate elements of both behaviors. In barium titanate, a typical ferroelectric of the displacive type, the transition can be understood in terms of a polarization catastrophe, in which, if an ion is displaced from equilibrium slightly, the force from the local electric fields due to the ions in the crystal increases faster than the elastic-restoring forces. This leads to an asymmetrical shift in the equilibrium ion positions and hence to a permanent dipole moment. The ionic displacement in barium titanate concerns the relative position of the titanium ion within the oxygen octahedral cage. In lead titanate, another key ferroelectric material, although the structure is rather similar to barium titanate the driving force for ferroelectricity is more complex with interactions between the lead and oxygen ions also playing an important role. In an order-disorder ferroelectric, there is a dipole moment in each unit cell, but at high temperatures they are pointing in random directions. Upon lowering the temperature and going through the phase transition, the dipoles order, all pointing in the same direction within a domain.

An important ferroelectric material for applications is lead zirconate titanate (PZT), which is part of the solid solution formed between ferroelectric lead titanate and anti-ferroelectric lead zirconate. Different compositions are used for different applications; for memory applications, PZT closer in composition to lead titanate is preferred, whereas piezoelectric applications make use of the diverging piezoelectric coefficients associated with the morphotropic phase boundary that is found close to the 50/50 composition.

Ferroelectric crystals often show several transition temperatures and domain structure hysteresis, much as do ferromagnetic crystals. The nature of the phase transition in some ferroelectric crystals is still not well understood.

In 1974 R.B. Meyer used symmetry arguments to predict ferroelectric liquid crystals, and the prediction could immediately be verified by several observations of behavior connected to ferroelectricity in smectic liquid-crystal phases that are chiral and tilted. The technology allows the building of flat-screen monitors. Mass production between 1994 and 1999 was carried out by Canon. Ferroelectric liquid crystals are used in production of reflective LCoS.

In 2010 David Field found that prosaic films of chemicals such as nitrous oxide or propane exhibited ferroelectric properties. This new class of ferroelectric materials exhibit &quot;spontelectric&quot; properties, and may have wide-ranging applications in device and nano-technology and also influence the electrical nature of dust in the interstellar medium.

Other ferroelectric materials used include triglycine sulfate, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and lithium tantalate. A single atom thick ferroelectric monolayer can be created using pure bismuth. 

It should be possible to produce materials which combine both ferroelectric and metallic properties simultaneously, at room temperature. According to research published in 2018 in &quot;Nature Communications&quot;, scientists were able to produce a two-dimensional sheet of material which was both ferroelectric (had a polar crystal structure) and which conducted electricity.

==Theory==
An introduction to Landau theory can be found here.
Based on Ginzburg–Landau theory, the free energy of a ferroelectric material, in the absence of an electric field and applied stress may be written as a Taylor expansion in terms of the order parameter, . If a sixth order expansion is used (i.e. 8th order and higher terms truncated), the free energy is given by:

formula_1

where are the components of the polarization vector in the directions respectively, and the coefficients, must be consistent with the crystal symmetry. To investigate domain formation and other phenomena in ferroelectrics, these equations are often used in the context of a phase field model. Typically, this involves adding a gradient term, an electrostatic term and an elastic term to the free energy. The equations are then discretized onto a grid using the finite difference method or finite element method and solved subject to the constraints of Gauss&#x27;s law and Linear elasticity.

In all known ferroelectrics, and . These coefficients may be obtained experimentally or from ab-initio simulations. For ferroelectrics with a first order phase transition, , whereas for a second order phase transition.

The &quot;spontaneous polarization&quot;, of a ferroelectric for a cubic to tetragonal phase transition may be obtained by considering the 1D expression of the free energy which is:

formula_2

This free energy has the shape of a double well potential with two free energy minima at , the spontaneous polarization. We find the derivative of the free energy, and set it equal to zero in order to solve for :

formula_3

Since the solution of this equation rather corresponds to a free energy &quot;maxima&quot; in the ferroelectric phase, the desired solutions for correspond to setting the remaining factor to zero:
formula_4

whose solution is:

formula_5

and eliminating solutions which take the square root of a negative number (for either the first or second order phase transitions) gives:

formula_6

If formula_7, the solution for the spontaneous polarization reduces to:

formula_8

The hysteresis loop ( versus ) may be obtained from the free energy expansion by including the term corresponding to the energy due to an external electric field interacting with the polarization , as follows:

formula_9

We find the stable polarization values of under the influence of the external field, now denoted as , again by setting the derivative of the energy with respect to to zero:
formula_10

Plotting (on the X axis) as a function of (but on the Y axis) gives an S-shaped curve which is multi-valued in for some values of . The central part of the &#x27;S&#x27; corresponds to a free energy local maximum (since formula_11 ). Elimination of this region, and connection of the top and bottom portions of the &#x27;S&#x27; curve by vertical lines at the discontinuities gives the hysteresis loop of internal polarization due to an external electric field.

==Sliding ferroelectricity==
Sliding ferroelectricity is widely found but only in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals stacked layers. The vertical electric polarization is switched by in-plane interlayer sliding.

<text>Thomas Kyd (baptised 6 November 1558; buried 15 August 1594) was an English playwright, the author of &quot;The Spanish Tragedy&quot;, and one of the most important figures in the development of Elizabethan drama.

Although well known in his own time, Kyd fell into obscurity until 1773 when Thomas Hawkins, an early editor of &quot;The Spanish Tragedy&quot;, discovered that Thomas Heywood, in his &quot;Apologie for Actors&quot; (1612), attributed the play to Kyd. A hundred years later, scholars in Germany and England began to shed light on his life and work, including the controversial finding that he may have been the author of a &quot;Hamlet&quot; play pre-dating Shakespeare&#x27;s, which is now known as the &quot;Ur-Hamlet&quot;.

==Early life==
Thomas Kyd was the son of Francis and Anna Kyd. There are no records of the day he was born, but he was baptised in the church of St Mary Woolnoth in the Ward of Langborn, Lombard Street, London on 6 November 1558. The baptismal register at St Mary Woolnoth carries this entry: &quot;Thomas, son of Francis Kydd, Citizen and Writer of the Courte Letter of London&quot;. Francis Kydd was a scrivener and in 1580 was warden of the Scriveners&#x27; Company.

In October 1565 the young Kyd was enrolled in the newly founded Merchant Taylors&#x27; School, whose headmaster was Richard Mulcaster. Fellow students included Edmund Spenser and Thomas Lodge. Here, Kyd received a well-rounded education, with the curriculum including Italian, Latin, Greek, music, drama, physical education, and &quot;good manners&quot;. There is no evidence that Kyd went on to university. He may have followed in his father&#x27;s professional footsteps because there are two letters written by him where his handwriting style is similar to that of a scrivener.

==Career==
Evidence suggests that in the 1580s Kyd became an important playwright, but little is known about his activity. Francis Meres placed him among &quot;our best for tragedy&quot; and Heywood elsewhere called him &quot;Famous Kyd&quot;. Ben Jonson mentions him in the same breath as Christopher Marlowe (with whom, in London, Kyd at one time shared a room) and John Lyly in the Shakespeare First Folio.

&quot;The Spanish Tragedy&quot; was probably written in the mid to late 1580s, with its first recorded performance on 23 February 1592 by Lord Strange&#x27;s Men. The earliest surviving edition was printed in 1592, the full title being &quot;The Spanish Tragedie, Containing the lamentable end of Don Horatio, and Bel-imperia: with the pittifull death of olde Hieronimo&quot;. However, the play was usually known simply as &quot;Hieronimo&quot; after the protagonist. It was arguably the most popular play of the &quot;Age of Shakespeare&quot; and set new standards in effective plot construction and character development. There were &quot;twenty-nine performances between 1592 and 1597&quot; and &quot;eleven editions between 1592 and 1633&quot;, which the historian J. R. Mulryne states is &quot;a tally unequaled by any of the plays of Shakespeare”. In 1602 a version of the play with &quot;additions&quot; was published. Philip Henslowe&#x27;s diary records payment to Ben Jonson for additions that year, but it is disputed whether the published additions reflect Jonson&#x27;s work or if they were actually composed for a 1597 revival of &quot;The Spanish Tragedy&quot; also mentioned by Henslowe.

Other works by Kyd are his translations of Torquato Tasso&#x27;s &quot;Padre di Famiglia&quot;, published as &quot;The Householder&#x27;s Philosophy&quot; (1588), and of Robert Garnier&#x27;s &quot;Cornélie&quot; (1594), along with the play &quot;Soliman and Perseda&quot;. Plays disputedly attributed, in whole or in part, to Kyd include &quot;King Leir&quot;, &quot;Fair Em&quot;, &quot;Arden of Faversham&quot; and parts of &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; and &quot;Edward III&quot;. A play related to &quot;The Spanish Tragedy&quot; called &quot;The First Part of Hieronimo&quot; (surviving in a quarto of 1605) may be a bad quarto or memorial reconstruction of a play by Kyd, or it may be an inferior writer&#x27;s burlesque of &quot;The Spanish Tragedy&quot; inspired by that play&#x27;s popularity. Kyd is supposed by some to have been the author of a &quot;Hamlet&quot;, the precursor of the Shakespearean play (see: &quot;Ur-Hamlet&quot;).

The success of Kyd&#x27;s plays extended to Europe. Versions of &quot;The Spanish Tragedy&quot; were popular in Germany and the Netherlands for generations. The influence of these plays on European drama was largely the reason for the interest in Kyd among German scholars in the nineteenth century.

==Later life==
From 1587 to 1593 Kyd was in the service of an unidentified noble, since, after his imprisonment in 1593 (see below), he wrote of having lost &quot;the favours of my Lord, whom I haue servd almost theis vi yeres nowe&quot;. Proposed nobles include the Earl of Sussex, the Earl of Pembroke, Lord Strange. and Edward De Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford. He may have worked as a secretary, if he did not also write plays. Around 1591 Christopher Marlowe also joined this patron&#x27;s service, and for a while Marlowe and Kyd shared lodgings, and perhaps even ideas.

On 11 May 1593 the Privy Council ordered the arrest of the authors of &quot;divers lewd and mutinous libels&quot; which had been posted around London. One libel was found on the property of a Dutch Church and contained violent anti-foreigner sentiments and multiple allusions to the works of Marlowe. The next day, Kyd was among those arrested; he would later believe that he had been the victim of an informer. His lodgings were searched and instead of evidence of the &quot;libels&quot; there was found an Arianist tract, described by an investigator as &quot;vile heretical conceits denying the eternal deity of Jesus Christ found amongst the papers of Thos. Kydd , prisoner ... which he affirmeth he had from C. Marley &quot;. Historians such as Frederick Boas believe that Kyd was tortured brutally to obtain this information. Kyd told authorities the writings found in his possession belonged to Christopher Marlowe, a fellow dramatist and former roommate. Kyd &quot;accused his former roommate of being a blasphemous traitor, an atheist who believed that Jesus Christ was a homosexual,&quot; an uninformed confusion over the Arian and early Gnostic concept of homoousios. Following the accusation, Marlowe was summoned by the Privy Council and, while waiting for a decision on his case, was killed in an incident in Deptford involving known government agents.

Kyd was eventually released but was not accepted back into his lord&#x27;s service. Believing he was under suspicion of atheism himself, he wrote to the Lord Keeper, Sir John Puckering, protesting his innocence, but his efforts to clear his name were apparently fruitless. The last we hear from the playwright is the publication of &quot;Cornelia&quot; early in 1594. In the dedication to the Countess of Sussex he alludes to the &quot;bitter times and privy broken passions&quot; he had endured. Kyd died later that year at the age of 35, and was buried on 15 August in St Mary Colechurch in London. In December of that same year, Kyd&#x27;s mother legally renounced the administration of his estate, probably because it was debt-ridden.

St Mary Colechurch was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666, and not rebuilt.

<text>The earliest texts of William Shakespeare&#x27;s works were published during the 16th and 17th centuries in quarto or folio format. Folios are large, tall volumes; quartos are smaller, roughly half the size. The publications of the latter are usually abbreviated to Q1, Q2, etc., where the letter stands for &quot;quarto&quot; and the number for the first, second, or third edition published.

==Plays==

Eighteen of the 36 plays in the First Folio were printed in separate and individual editions prior to 1623. &quot;Pericles&quot; (1609) and &quot;The Two Noble Kinsmen&quot; (1634) also appeared separately before their inclusions in folio collections (the Shakespeare Third Folio and the second Beaumont and Fletcher folio, respectively). All of these were quarto editions, with two exceptions: &quot;The True Tragedy of Richard Duke of York&quot;, the first edition of &quot;Henry VI, Part 3&quot;, was printed in octavo form in 1595, as was the 1611 edition of &quot;The most lamentable tragedy of Titus Andronicus&quot;. In chronological order, these publications were:

*&quot;Titus Andronicus,&quot; 1594, 1600, 1611 (octavo)
*&quot;Henry VI, Part 2,&quot; 1594, 1600, 1619
*&quot;Henry VI, Part 3,&quot; 1595 (octavo), 1600, 1619
*&quot;Edward III,&quot; 1596
*&quot;Romeo and Juliet,&quot; 1597, 1599, 1609
*&quot;Richard II,&quot; 1597, 1598, 1608, 1615
*&quot;Richard III,&quot; 1597, 1598, 1602, 1605, 1612, 1622
*&quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost,&quot; 1598
*&quot;Henry IV, Part 1,&quot; 1598, 1599, 1604, 1608, 1613, 1622
*&quot;Henry IV, Part 2,&quot; 1600
*&quot;Henry V,&quot; 1600, 1602, 1619
*&quot;The Merchant of Venice,&quot; 1600, 1619
*&quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream,&quot; 1600, 1619
*&quot;Much Ado About Nothing,&quot; 1600
*&quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor,&quot; 1602, 1619
*&quot;Hamlet,&quot; 1603, 1604, 1611
*&quot;King Lear,&quot; 1608, 1619
*&quot;Troilus and Cressida,&quot; 1609
*&quot;Pericles, Prince of Tyre,&quot; 1609, 1611, 1619
*&quot;Othello,&quot; 1622
*&quot;The Two Noble Kinsmen,&quot; 1634.

Six of the preceding were classified as &quot;bad quartos&quot; by Alfred W. Pollard and other scholars associated with the New Bibliography. Popular plays like &quot;1 Henry IV&quot; and &quot;Pericles&quot; were reprinted in their quarto editions even after the First Folio appeared, sometimes more than once.

== Poetry ==

Shakespeare&#x27;s poems were also printed in quarto or octavo form:
*&quot;Venus and Adonis,&quot; Q1—1593, Q2—1594 (with later editions in octavo);
*&quot;The Rape of Lucrece,&quot; Q—1594 (with later editions in octavo);
*&quot;The Phoenix and the Turtle,&quot; Q1—1601, Q2—1611 (in Robert Chester&#x27;s &quot;Love&#x27;s Martyr&quot;);
*&quot;The Sonnets&quot; and &quot;A Lover&#x27;s Complaint,&quot; Q—1609.

Differing from the quartos of the plays, the first editions of Shakespeare&#x27;s narrative poems are extremely well printed. &quot;Richard Field, Shakespeare&#x27;s first publisher and printer, was a Stratford man, probably a friend of Shakespeare, and the two produced an excellent text.&quot; Shakespeare may have had direct involvement in the publication of the two poems, a check such as Ben Jonson exercised in reference to the publication of his works, but as Shakespeare clearly did not do in connection with his plays.

John Benson published a collected edition of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Poems&quot; in 1640; the poems were not added to collections of the plays until the 18th century. (The disputed miscellany &quot;The Passionate Pilgrim&quot; was only printed in octavo: twice in 1599, with another in 1612, all by William Jaggard.)

==Folios==
The folio format was reserved for expensive, prestigious volumes. During Shakespeare&#x27;s lifetime, stage plays were not generally taken seriously as literature and not considered worthy of being collected into folios, so the plays printed while he was alive were printed as quartos. His poems were never included in his collected works until the eighteenth century.

It was not until 1616, the year of Shakespeare&#x27;s death, that Ben Jonson defied convention by issuing a folio collection of his own plays and poems. Seven years later the folio volume &quot;Mr. William Shakespeare&#x27;s Comedies, Histories &amp; Tragedies&quot; appeared; this edition is now called the First Folio. It contains 36 plays, 18 of which were printed for the first time. Because Shakespeare was dead, the folio was compiled by John Heminges and Henry Condell (fellow actors in Shakespeare&#x27;s company), and arranged into comedies, histories and tragedies. The First Folio is generally looked to by actors and directors as the purest form of Shakespeare&#x27;s text. While punctuation and grammar are not always accurate by today&#x27;s rules, these things served as direction to the actors on how to say the lines.

The First Folio was compiled by Heminges and Condell but published by a trio of stationers (booksellers and publishers): William Jaggard, his son Isaac Jaggard, and Edward Blount. William Aspley and John Smethwick participated in the endeavor as subsidiary partners. It contained, in addition to blandishments provided by various admirers of Shakespeare, such as the dedication signed by &quot;John Heminge and Henry Condell&quot;, 36 plays. They included &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot;, which was not, however, listed in the table of contents, but omitted &quot;Pericles&quot; and &quot;The Two Noble Kinsmen&quot;, which are now usually considered canonical. The Jaggards were printers, and did the actual printing of the book. The elder Jaggard has seemed an odd choice to many commentators, given his problematical relationship with the Shakespeare canon: Jaggard issued the suspect collection &quot;The Passionate Pilgrim&quot; in 1599 and 1612, and in 1619 printed the so-called False Folio, ten pirated or spurious Shakespearean plays, some with false dates and title pages. It is thought that the printing of the First Folio was such an enormous task that the Jaggards&#x27; shop was simply needed to get the job done. William Jaggard was old, infirm, and blind by 1623, and in fact died a month before the First Folio was complete.

The First Folio was reprinted three times in the 17th century:

The Second Folio appeared in 1632. Isaac Jaggard had died in 1627, and Edward Blount had transferred his rights to stationer Robert Allot in 1630. The Second Folio was published by Allot, William Aspley, Richard Hawkins, Richard Meighen, and John Smethwick, and printed by Thomas Cotes. It contained the same plays as the First Folio and much of the same additional material, with the addition of an unsigned poem by John Milton. 

The Third Folio was issued in 1663, published by Philip Chetwinde; Chetwinde had married Robert Allot&#x27;s widow and so obtained the rights to the book. To the second impression of the Third Folio (1664) he added seven plays, namely &quot;Pericles, Prince of Tyre;&quot; &quot;Locrine;&quot; &quot;The London Prodigal;&quot; &quot;The Puritan;&quot; &quot;Sir John Oldcastle;&quot; &quot;Thomas Lord Cromwell;&quot; and &quot;A Yorkshire Tragedy.&quot; (See: Shakespeare Apocrypha.) All seven of these additional plays had been published as quartos while Shakespeare was alive, but only &quot;Pericles&quot; was eventually widely accepted into the Shakespearean canon. 

The quartos of &quot;Pericles&quot; (1609 and 1611), &quot;The London Prodigal&quot; (1605) and &quot;A Yorkshire Tragedy&quot; (1608) were all attributed to William Shakespeare on their front pages. The quartos of &quot;Locrine&quot; (1595), &quot;The Puritan&quot; (1607) and &quot;Thomas Lord Cromwell&quot; (1602 and 1613) were attributed to W. S. on their title pages, but Shakespeare was not the only playwright with those initials; Wentworth Smith has been put forward as another possible author of these works. &quot;Sir John Oldcastle&quot; was printed in 1619, three years after Shakespeare&#x27;s death, as part of the False Folio. It was attributed to Shakespeare on its title page which also bore a false date of 1600.

The Third Folio is relatively rare, compared to the Second and Fourth, probably because unsold copies were destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666. One surviving copy was purchased by the Irish High Court judge and antiquarian William O&#x27;Brien in the 1880s. It was put up for auction by Sotheby&#x27;s in 2017.

The Fourth Folio appeared in 1685, published by R. Bentley, E. Brewster, R. Chiswell, and H. Herringman. It contains the same 43 plays as the Third Folio. Brewster, Chiswell, and Herringman were members of the six-man syndicate that published the third Ben Jonson folio in 1692; Herringman was one of three stationers who issued the second Beaumont and Fletcher folio in 1679.

The Fourth Folio in turn served as the base for the series of eighteenth-century editions of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays. Nicholas Rowe used the Fourth Folio text as the foundation of his 1709 edition, and subsequent editors — Pope, Theobald, etc. — both adapted and reacted to Rowe&#x27;s text in their own editions. (See: Shakespeare&#x27;s editors.)

&quot;The Two Noble Kinsmen&quot; did not appear in any Folio edition. It was not printed until 1634, although there is evidence of its being performed much earlier. The title page said &quot;written by the memorable worthies of their time: Mr. John Fletcher and Mr. William Shakspeare [&quot;sic&quot;], Gent.&quot; It was not included in most editions of Shakespeare (e.g., the Cambridge/Globe editions of Wright and Clark, ca. 1863) until the latter half of the 19th century (it appears, e.g., in Dyce&#x27;s collected Works of Shakespeare in 1876) but it was not generally accepted into the Shakespeare canon until well into the 20th century, when, for example, it was included in the Riverside edition of 1974.

<doc id="44712" wikidata="Q2979768" url="?curid=44712" title="Evil clown">
<text>The evil clown, also known as the creepy clown, scary clown or killer clown (if their character revolves around murder), is a subversion of the traditional comic clown character, in which the playful trope is instead depicted in a more disturbing nature through the use of horror elements and dark humor. The modern archetype of the evil clown was popularized by the DC Comics supervillain Joker starting in 1940, and again in 1980s by Pennywise from Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;It&quot;. The character can be seen as playing on the sense of unease felt by sufferers of coulrophobia, the fear of clowns.

==Origins==

The modern archetype of the evil clown has unclear origins; the stock character appeared infrequently during the 19th century, in such works as Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;Hop-Frog&quot;, which is believed by Jack Morgan, of the University of Missouri-Rolla, to draw upon an earlier incident &quot;at a masquerade ball&quot;, in the 14th century, during which &quot;the King and his frivolous party, costumed—in highly flammable materials—as simian creatures, were ignited by a flambeau and incinerated, the King narrowly escaping in the actual case.&quot; Evil clowns also occupied a small niche in drama, appearing in the 1874 work &quot;La femme de Tabarin&quot; by Catulle Mendès and in Ruggero Leoncavallo&#x27;s &quot;Pagliacci&quot; (accused of being a plagiarism of Mendès&#x27; piece), both works featuring murderous clowns as central characters.
American serial killer and rapist John Wayne Gacy became known as the &quot;Killer Clown&quot; when arrested in 1978, after it was discovered he had performed as Pogo the Clown at children&#x27;s parties and other events; however, Gacy did not actually commit his crimes while wearing his clown costume. During the 1980s, the &quot;National Lampoon&quot; published a series of mock comic books in the pages of the magazine, entitled &quot;Evil Clown&quot;, which featured a malevolent character named Frenchy the Clown.

Evil clown themes were occasionally found in popular music. Zal Cleminson, guitarist with the English rock band The Sensational Alex Harvey Band, wore black and white clown-style makeup and colorful clothes while on stage during the band&#x27;s 1970s heyday, while his &quot;happy-sad-happy&quot; demeanor helped give their performances an edge of menace.

The evil clown archetype plays strongly off the sense of dislike it caused to inherent elements of coulrophobia; however, it has been suggested by Joseph Durwin that the concept of evil clowns has an independent position in popular culture, arguing that &quot;the concept of evil clowns and the widespread hostility it induces is a cultural phenomenon which transcends just the phobia alone&quot;. A study by the University of Sheffield concluded &quot;that clowns are universally disliked by children. Some found them quite frightening and unknowable.&quot; This may be because of the nature of clowns&#x27; makeup hiding their faces, making them potential threats in disguise; as a psychology professor at California State University, Northridge stated, young children are &quot;very reactive to a familiar body type with an unfamiliar face&quot;. This natural dislike of clowns makes them effective in a literary or fictional context, as the antagonistic threat perceived in clowns is desirable in a villainous character.

Researcher Ben Radford, who published &quot;Bad Clowns&quot; in 2016 and is regarded as an expert on the phenomenon, writes that looking throughout history clowns are seen as tricksters, fools, and more; however, they always are in control, speak their minds, and can get away with doing so. When writing the book &quot;Bad Clowns&quot;, Radford found that professional clowns are not generally fond of the bad-clown (or evil-clown) persona. They see them as &quot;the rotten apple in the barrel, whose ugly sight and smell casts suspicion on the rest of them,&quot; and do not wish to encourage or propagate coulrophobia. Yet, as Radford discovered, bad clowns have existed throughout history: Harlequin, the King&#x27;s fool, and Mr. Punch. Radford argues that bad clowns have the &quot;ability to change with the times&quot; and that modern bad clowns have evolved into Internet trolls. They may not wear clown costume but, nevertheless, engage with people for their own amusement, abuse, tease and speak what they think of as the &quot;truth&quot; much like the court jester and &quot;dip clowns&quot; do using &quot;human foibles&quot; against their victims. Radford states that, although bad clowns permeate the media in movies, TV, music, comics, and more, the &quot;good clowns&quot; outnumber the bad ones. Research shows that most people do not fear clowns but actually love them and that bad clowns are &quot;the exception, not the rule.&quot;

==Interpretations==
The concept of the evil clown is related to the irrational fear of clowns, known as coulrophobia, a neologism coined in the context of informal &quot;&quot;-phobia&quot; lists&quot;.

The cultural critic Mark Dery has theorized the postmodern archetype of the evil clown in &quot;Cotton Candy Autopsy: Deconstructing Psycho-Killer Clowns&quot; (a chapter in his cultural critique &quot;The Pyrotechnic Insanitarium: American Culture on the Brink&quot;).

Tracking the image of the demented or deviant clown across popular culture, Dery analyzes the &quot;Pogo the Clown&quot; persona of the serial killer John Wayne Gacy; the obscene clowns of the neo-situationist Cacophony Society; the Joker (of &quot;Batman&quot; fame); the grotesque art of R.K. Sloane; the sick-funny Bobcat Goldthwait comedy &quot;Shakes the Clown&quot;; &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;&#x27;s Ghost Clown from the episode &quot;Bedlam in the Big Top&quot;; Horny the Clown in the 2007 horror-comedy movie &quot;Drive-Thru&quot;, and Pennywise from Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;It&quot;.

Using Mikhail Bakhtin&#x27;s theory of the carnivalesque, Jungian and historical writings on the images of the fool in myth and history, and ruminations on the mingling of ecstasy and dread in the Information Age, Dery asserts the evil clown is an icon of our times. Clowns are often depicted as murderous psychopaths at many American haunted houses.

Wolfgang M. Zucker points out the similarities between a clown&#x27;s appearance and the cultural depictions of demons and other infernal creatures, noting &quot;[the clown&#x27;s] chalk-white face in which the eyes almost disappear, while the mouth is enlarged to a ghoulish bigness, looks like the mask of death&quot;.

According to psychology professor Joseph Durwin at California State University, Northridge, young children are &quot;very reactive to a familiar body type with an unfamiliar face&quot;. Researchers who have studied the phobia believe there is some correlation to the uncanny valley effect. Additionally, clown behavior is often &quot;transgressive&quot; (anti-social behavior) which can create feelings of unease.

A 2022 survey of 987 adults from 64 countries found that 54% of respondents reported experiencing some degree of coulrophobia.

== Urban legends and incidents ==
===The clown sightings===

The related urban legend of evil clown sightings in real life is known as &quot;phantom clowns&quot;. First reported in 1981 in Brookline, Massachusetts, children said that men dressed up as clowns had attempted to lure them into a van. The panic spread throughout the US in the Midwest and Northeast. It resurfaced in 1985 in Phoenix, Arizona; in 1991 in West Orange, New Jersey; in 1990 in Brazil, through a story reported by the Brazilian tabloid &quot;Notícias Populares&quot;; and 1995 in Honduras. Later sightings included Chicago in Illinois in 2008. Explanations for the phenomenon have ranged from Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;It&quot; and the crimes of serial killer John Wayne Gacy, to a moral panic influenced by contemporaneous fears of Satanic ritual abuse. It also shows similarities to the story of the Pied Piper of Hamelin. In most cases the reports were made by children, and no adults or police officers were able to confirm the sightings.

In 2013, a character who became known as &quot;the Northampton Clown&quot; was repeatedly sighted standing silently around the English town. The work of three local filmmakers, Alex Powell, Elliot Simpson and Luke Ubanski, the Northampton clown was similar in appearance to Pennywise from Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;It&quot;. Although rumors said that the clown may have a knife, the clown himself denied these rumors through social media. In March 2014, Matteo Moroni from Perugia, Italy, owner of YouTube channel DM Pranks, began dressing up as a killer clown and terrifying unsuspecting passers-by, with his videos racking up hundreds of millions of views. In 2014, further complaints of evil clown pranksters were reported in France, the United States and Germany, possibly inspired by &quot;American Horror Story: Freak Show&quot;.

In 2014, &quot;the Wasco clown&quot; attracted social media attention in California. Again this clown shared a similar resemblance to Pennywise, and it was revealed that the social media postings were part of a year-long photography project conducted by the artist&#x27;s wife. In Bakersfield, California &quot;menacing&quot; clowns were reported, some with weapons. In July 2015, a &quot;creepy&quot; clown was seen around a local cemetery in Chicago and terrorizing anyone in the graveyard.

There was another burst of such sightings in 2016, including in South Carolina and New York.

Researcher Ben Radford writes that there have been many surges of evil clown sightings reported, Radford says it is most likely pranksters. The urban legends and panic can cause real danger as &quot;face-painted pranksters and innocent bystanders may be at risk&quot; by interaction of well-intended public or police thinking a threat exists when it does not.

==Response to evil clowns in media==
In 2014, Clowns of America International responded to the depiction of Twisty on &quot;American Horror Story&quot;, and evil clowns in media generally. President Glenn Kohlberger said, &quot;Hollywood makes money sensationalizing the norm. They can take any situation no matter how good or pure and turn it into a nightmare. ... We do not support in any way, shape or form any medium that sensationalizes or adds to coulrophobia or &#x27;clown fear.

== Depictions ==

The Joker character in the &quot;Batman&quot; franchise was introduced in 1940 and has developed into one of the most recognizable and iconic fictional characters in popular culture, leading &quot;Wizard&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Villains of All Time&quot; ranking in 2006. The contemporary &quot;evil clown&quot; archetype developed in the 1980s, notably popularized by Pennywise from Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;It&quot;, and perhaps influenced by John Wayne Gacy, a serial killer dubbed the &quot;Killer Clown&quot; in 1978. &quot;Killer Klowns from Outer Space&quot; is a 1988 horror comedy dedicated to the topic. Although Krusty the Clown, a cartoon character introduced 1989 in the animated sitcom &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, is a comical, non-scary clown, the character reveals darker aspects in his personality. In &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Lisa&#x27;s First Word&quot; (1992), children&#x27;s fear of clowns features in the form of a very young Bart being traumatized by an inexpertly built Krusty the Clown themed bed, repeatedly uttering the phrase &quot;can&#x27;t sleep, clown will eat me...&quot; The phrase inspired an Alice Cooper song in the album &quot;Dragontown&quot; (2001) and became a popular catchphrase. Evil clowns are also mentioned in a popular song by P!nk.

The American rap duo Insane Clown Posse have exploited this theme since 1989 and have inspired Twiztid and similar acts, many on Psychopathic Records, to do likewise. Websites dedicated to evil clowns and the fear of clowns appeared in the late 1990s.

* The Joker, the nemesis of Batman, whose key features are chalk-white skin, emerald-green hair, ruby-red lips and (in some iterations) a perpetual smile, sometimes a permanent sardonic grin or a Glasgow smile, depending on the adaption of the character. He is commonly depicted as a criminal mastermind, as well as a sadistic and murderous psychopath. The character is also known by several nicknames, including &quot;the Clown Prince of Crime&quot;. 
* The 1982 film &quot;Poltergeist&quot;, directed by Tobe Hooper and produced by Steven Spielberg, along with the 2015 remake of the same name directed by Gil Kenan, feature a possessed clown doll.
* Pennywise the Dancing Clown, the main antagonist in Stephen King&#x27;s 1986 horror novel &quot;It&quot; and its adaptations. Pennywise was portrayed in the 1990 television miniseries version by Tim Curry and by Bill Skarsgård in the 2017 film adaptation and its 2019 sequel.
* The 1988 film &quot;Killer Klowns from Outer Space&quot;, directed by the Chiodo Brothers, features extraterrestrial evil clowns as the story&#x27;s antagonists.

* The most famous professional wrestling depiction of an evil clown was Doink the Clown, a persona originated in 1992 by professional wrestler Matt Osborne in the World Wrestling Federation. Originally, the gimmick was that of a sadistic, evil clown, playing cruel tricks on fans and wrestlers to amuse himself and put them off guard; to help gain heat for the character, he was placed in a storyline feud with Crush, wherein Doink, after faking an injury, sneak-attacked Crush with a loaded prosthetic arm. The evil clown gimmick would be dropped later in 1993 as he turned face.
* Violator, a supervillain demon appearing in the &quot;Spawn&quot; comic books published by Image Comics, is commonly depicted in the form of &quot;Clown&quot;, a balding, overweight man with blue facepaint.
* Sweet Tooth, a character in the &quot;Twisted Metal&quot; video game series. Sweet Tooth the Clown from &quot;Twisted Metal&quot; (2012) is a man wearing a psychotic clown mask with a flaming head and carrying a large machete.

* The FX horror anthology series &quot;American Horror Story&quot; used two instances of evil clowns: The first being Twisty the Clown from the fourth season &quot;Freak Show&quot;, who made a cameo appearance in &quot;Cult&quot; where the season&#x27;s antagonist created a murderous clown cult to orchestrate his rise to political power.
* The 2014 film &quot;Theatre of Fear&quot;, directed by Andrew Jones, features a murderous clown character played by Nathan Head.

<text>The of Everyman (&quot;The Summoning of Everyman&quot;), usually referred to simply as &quot;Everyman&quot;, is a late 15th-century morality play by an anonymous English author, printed circa 1530. It is possibly a translation of the Dutch play &quot;Elckerlijc&quot; (Everyman).

Like John Bunyan&#x27;s 1678 Christian novel &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;, &quot;Everyman&quot; uses allegorical characters to examine the question of Christian salvation and explain that Man must have a relationship with God to attain it. To develop that relationship, his strength, wisdom, senses, beauty and discretion is not helpful. The relationship with God is strengthened through his adherence to rules established by the Church – the partaking of the Eucharist, confession, penance, and participation in last rites, thus redeeming him and preparing him for eternal salvation.

==Summary==
The play is the allegorical accounting of the life of Everyman, who represents all mankind. In the course of the action, Everyman tries to convince other characters to accompany him in the hope of improving his life. All the characters are also mystical; the conflict between good and evil is shown by the interactions between the characters. Everyman is being singled out because it is difficult for him to find characters to accompany him on his pilgrimage. Everyman eventually realizes through this pilgrimage that he is essentially alone, despite all the personified characters that were supposed necessities and friends to him, which ultimately do not lead him closer to Christ. Everyman learns that when you are brought to death and placed before God, your Good Deeds (which in the play include following Church practices of Eucharist, confession, penance and last rites) draw him into salvation with Christ.

==Sources==
The play was written in Middle English during the Tudor period, but the identity of the author is unknown. Although the play was apparently produced with some frequency in the seventy-five years following its composition, no production records survive.

There is a similar Dutch-language morality play of the same period called &quot;Elckerlijc&quot;. In the early 20th century, scholars did not agree on which of these plays was the original, or even on their relation to a later Latin work named &quot;Homulus&quot;. By the 1980s, Arthur Cawley went so far as to say that the &quot;evidence for … Elckerlijk is certainly very strong&quot;, and now Davidson, Walsh, and Broos hold that &quot;more than a century of scholarly discussion has ... convincingly shown that &quot;Everyman&quot; is a translation and adaptation from the Dutch &quot;Elckerlijc&quot;&quot;.

==Setting==
The cultural setting is based on the Roman Catholicism of the era. Everyman attains afterlife in heaven by means of receiving the Catholic Sacraments, in particular Confession, Penance, Anointing of the Sick (Unction), and receiving the Eucharist.

==Synopsis==
The oldest surviving example of the script begins with this paragraph on the frontispiece:
After a brief prologue asking the audience to listen, God speaks, lamenting that humans have become too absorbed in material wealth and riches to follow Him, so He commands Death to go to Everyman and summon him to heaven to make his reckoning. Death arrives at Everyman&#x27;s side to tell him it is time to die and face judgment. Upon hearing this, Everyman is distressed, so begs for more time. Death denies this, but will allow Everyman to find a companion for his journey.

Everyman&#x27;s friend Fellowship promises to go anywhere with him, but when he hears of the true nature of Everyman&#x27;s journey, he refuses to go. Everyman then calls on Kindred and Cousin and asks them to go with him, but they both refuse. In particular, Cousin explains a fundamental reason why no people will accompany Everyman: they have their own accounts to write as well. Afterwards, Everyman asks Goods, who will not come: God&#x27;s judgment will be severe because of the selfishness implied in Goods&#x27;s presence.

Everyman then turns to Good Deeds, who says she would go with him, but she is too weak as Everyman has not loved her in his life. Good Deeds summons her sister Knowledge to accompany them, and together they go to see Confession. In the presence of Confession, Everyman begs God for forgiveness and repents his sins, punishing himself with a scourge. After his scourging, Everyman is absolved of his sins, and as a result, Good Deeds becomes strong enough to accompany Everyman on his journey with Death.

Good Deeds then summons Beauty, Strength, Discretion and Five Wits to join them, and they agree to accompany Everyman as he goes to a priest to take sacrament. After the sacrament, Everyman tells them where his journey ends, and again they all abandon him – except for Good Deeds. Even Knowledge cannot accompany him after he leaves his physical body, but will stay with him until the time of death.

Content at last, Everyman climbs into his grave with Good Deeds at his side and dies, after which they ascend together into heaven, where they are welcomed by an Angel. The play closes as the Doctor enters and explains that in the end, a man will only have his Good Deeds to accompany him beyond the grave.

==Adaptations==
A modern stage production of &quot;Everyman&quot; did not appear until July 1901 when The Elizabethan Stage Society of William Poel gave three outdoor performances at the Charterhouse in London. Poel then partnered with British actor Ben Greet to produce the play throughout Britain, with runs on the American Broadway stage from 1902 to 1918, and concurrent tours throughout North America. These productions differed from past performances in that women were cast in the title role, rather than men. Film adaptations of the 1901 version of the play appeared in 1913 and 1914, with the 1913 film being made with an early color two-process, Kinemacolor.

A version was filmed for Australian TV in 1964.

Another well-known version of the play is &quot;Jedermann&quot; by the Austrian playwright Hugo von Hofmannsthal, which has been performed annually at the Salzburg Festival since 1920, and adapted into film several times. &quot;Jedermann&quot; received an English language adaptation in 1917, &quot;The Play of Everyman&quot;. The 1917 adaptation was performed at the Trinity Auditorium in Los Angeles, followed by a run at the Burbank Theater in Burbank, California, and was translated and adapted by George Sterling with &quot;Richard&quot; Ryszard Ordynski and music by Victor Schertzinger. The Sterling adaptation was performed again in 1936 at the Hollywood Bowl with music by Einar Nelson.

Frederick Franck published a modernised version of the tale entitled &quot;Everyone&quot;, drawing on Buddhist influence.

A direct-to-video film of &quot;Everyman&quot; was made in 2002, directed by John Farrell, which updated the setting to the early 21st century, including Death as a businessman in dark glasses with a briefcase, and Goods being played by a talking personal computer.

Jo Clifford&#x27;s play &quot;Every One&quot;, a modern version of &quot;Everyman&quot;, premiered at the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh in 2010.

In 2014, London theatre company Scena Mundi Theatre (then Little Spaniel Theatre) staged a production of &quot;Everyman&quot; at St Bartholomew the Great, a Church in the City of London. The play, directed by Cecilia Dorland, played on the church&#x27;s medieval setting and kept the Middle English text intact. A strong ensemble piece using music and singing, it was very well received by critics.

A modernized adaptation by Carol Ann Duffy, the Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom, with Chiwetel Ejiofor in the title role, was performed at the National Theatre from April to July 2015.

In December 2016, Moravian University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania presented &quot;Everyman on Trial&quot;, a contemporary adaptation written and directed by Christopher Shorr.

Branden Jacobs-Jenkins&#x27; adaptation, titled &quot;Everybody&quot;, premiered in 2017 at the Pershing Square Signature Center in New York City.

<doc id="44714" wikidata="Q1734347" url="?curid=44714" title="Karplus–Strong string synthesis">
<text>Karplus–Strong string synthesis is a method of physical modelling synthesis that loops a short waveform through a filtered delay line to simulate the sound of a hammered or plucked string or some types of percussion. 

At first glance, this technique can be viewed as subtractive synthesis based on a feedback loop similar to that of a comb filter for z-transform analysis. However, it can also be viewed as the simplest class of wavetable-modification algorithms now known as digital waveguide synthesis, because the delay line acts to store one period of the signal.

Alexander Strong invented the algorithm, and Kevin Karplus did the first analysis of how it worked. Together they developed software and hardware implementations of the algorithm, including a custom VLSI chip. They named the algorithm &quot;Digitar&quot; synthesis, as a portmanteau for &quot;digital guitar&quot;.

== How it works ==

# A short excitation waveform (of length L samples) is generated. In the original algorithm, this was a burst of white noise, but it can also include any wideband signal, such as a rapid sine wave chirp or frequency sweep, or a single cycle of a sawtooth wave or square wave.
# This excitation is output and simultaneously fed back into a delay line L samples long.
# The output of the delay line is fed through a filter. The gain of the filter must be less than 1 at all frequencies, to maintain a stable positive feedback loop. The filter can be a first-order lowpass filter (as pictured). In the original algorithm, the filter consisted of averaging two adjacent samples, a particularly simple filter that can be implemented without a multiplier, requiring only shift and add operations. The filter characteristics are crucial in determining the harmonic structure of the decaying tone.
# The filtered output is simultaneously mixed into the output and fed back into the delay line.

== Tuning the string ==
The fundamental frequency (specifically, the lowest nonzero resonant frequency) of the resulting signal is the lowest frequency at which the unwrapped phase response of the delay and filter in cascade is formula_1. The required phase delay &quot;D&quot; for a given fundamental frequency &quot;F&quot;0 is therefore calculated according to &quot;D&quot; = &quot;F&quot;&quot;s&quot;/&quot;F&quot;0 where &quot;F&quot;&quot;s&quot; is the sampling frequency.

The length of any digital delay line is a whole-number multiple of the sampling period. In order to obtain a fractional delay often needed for fine tuning the string below JND (Just Noticeable Difference), interpolating filters are used with parameters selected to obtain an appropriate phase delay at the fundamental frequency. Either IIR or FIR filters may be used, but FIR have the advantage that transients are suppressed if the fractional delay is changed over time. The most elementary fractional delay is the linear interpolation between two samples (e.g., &quot;s&quot;(4.2) = 0.8&quot;s&quot;(4) + 0.2&quot;s&quot;(5)). If the phase delay varies with frequency, harmonics may be sharpened or flattened relative to the fundamental frequency. The original algorithm used equal weighting on two adjacent samples, as this can be achieved without multiplication hardware, allowing extremely cheap implementations.

Z-transform analysis can be used to get the pitches and decay times of the harmonics more precisely, as explained in the 1983 paper that introduced the algorithm.

A demonstration of the Karplus-Strong algorithm can be heard in the following Vorbis file. The algorithm used a loop gain of 0.98 with increasingly attenuating first order lowpass filters. The pitch of the note was A2, or 220 Hz.

Holding the period (= length of the delay line) constant produces vibrations similar to those of a string or bell. Increasing the period sharply after the transient input produces drum-like sounds.

== Refinements to the algorithm ==
Due to its plucked-string sound in certain modes, Alex Strong and Kevin Karplus conjectured that the Karplus-Strong (KS) algorithm was in some sense a vibrating string simulation, and they worked on showing that it solved the wave equation for the vibrating string, but this was not completed. Julius O. Smith III recognized that the transfer-function of the KS, when viewed as a digital filter, coincided with that of a vibrating string, with the filter in the feedback loop representing the total string losses over one period. He later derived the KS algorithm as a special case of digital waveguide synthesis, which was used to model acoustic waves in strings, tubes, and membranes. The first set of extensions and generalizations of the Karplus-Strong Algorithm, typically known as the Extended Karplus-Strong (EKS) Algorithm, was presented in a paper in 1982 at the International Computer Music Conference in Venice, Italy, and published in more detail in 1983 in Computer Music Journal in an article entitled &quot;Extensions of the Karplus Strong Plucked String Algorithm,&quot; by David A. Jaffe and Julius O. Smith, and in Smith&#x27;s PhD/EE dissertation.

Alex Strong developed a superior wavetable-modification method for plucked-string synthesis, but only published it as a patent.

== Musical applications ==
The first musical use of the algorithm was in the work &quot;May All Your Children Be Acrobats&quot; written in 1981 by David A. Jaffe, and scored for eight guitars, mezzo-soprano and computer-generated stereo tape, with a text based on Carl Sandburg&#x27;s &quot;The People, Yes&quot;. Jaffe continued to explore the musical and technical possibilities of the algorithm in &quot;Silicon Valley Breakdown&quot;, for computer-generated plucked strings (1982), as well as in later works such as &quot;Telegram to the President, 1984&quot; for string quartet and tape, and &quot;Grass&quot; for female chorus and tape (1987).

The patent was licensed first to Mattel Electronics, which failed as a company before any product using the algorithm was developed, then to a startup company founded by some of the laid-off Mattel executives. They never got sufficient funding to finish development, and so never brought a product to market either. Eventually Yamaha licensed the patent, as part of the Sondius package of patents from Stanford. It is unknown whether any hardware using the algorithm was ever sold, though many software implementations (which did not pay any license fees to the inventors) have been released.

While they may not adhere strictly to the algorithm, many hardware components for modular systems have been commercially produced that invoke the basic principles of Karplus-Strong Synthesis: using an inverted, scaled control system for very small time values in a filtered delay line to create playable notes in the Western Tempered tuning system, controlled with volt per octave tracking or MIDI data. The Inventors were not specifically credited, though the term &quot;Karplus-Strong Synthesis&quot; is referenced in some of the manuals. 

Hardware components capable of Karplus-Strong style synthesis include the Moog Clusterflux 108M, Mutable Instruments Elements and Rings, 4ms Company Dual Looping Delay, 2HP Pluck, Make Noise Mimeophon, Arturia MicroFreak, Non Linear Circuits Is Carp Lust Wrong?, and the Strymon Starlab.

<text>The morality play is a genre of medieval and early Tudor drama. The term is used by scholars of literary and dramatic history to refer to a genre of play texts from the fourteenth through sixteenth centuries that feature personified concepts (most often virtues and vices, but sometimes practices or habits) alongside angels and demons, who are engaged in a struggle to persuade a protagonist who represents a generic human character toward either good or evil. The common story arc of these plays follows &quot;the temptation, fall and redemption of the protagonist&quot;.

==English morality plays==

Hildegard von Bingen&#x27;s &quot;Ordo Virtutum&quot; (English: &quot;Order of the Virtues&quot;), composed c. 1151 in Germany, is the earliest known morality play by more than a century, and it is the only medieval musical drama to survive with an attribution for both the text and the music. Because there are many formal differences between this play and later medieval moralities, as well as the fact that it only exists in two manuscripts, it is unlikely that the &quot;Ordo Virtutum&quot; had any direct influence on the writing of its later English counterparts.

Traditionally, scholars name only five surviving English morality plays from the medieval period: &quot;The Pride of Life&quot; (late 14th century), &quot;The Castle of Perseverance&quot; (c.1425); &quot;Wisdom&quot;, (1460–63); &quot;Mankind&quot; (c.1470); &quot;Everyman&quot; (1510). &quot;The Pride of Life&quot; was the earliest record of a morality play written in the English language; the text (destroyed by fire in 1922, but published earlier) existed on the back of a parchment account roll from June 30, 1343, to January 5, 1344, from the Priory of the Holy Trinity in Dublin. However, this textual record was incomplete. The play cut off mid-line, when the character Messenger, at the command of the King, called upon Death; the plot summary provided by the introductory banns, featured at the beginning of the play, indicated that the action continued.

&quot;The Castle of Perseverance&quot;, &quot;Wisdom&quot;, and &quot;Mankind&quot; are all part of a single manuscript called the Macro Manuscript, named after its first known owner, Cox Macro of Bury St Edmunds. A second copy of the first 752 lines of &quot;Wisdom&quot; is preserved in MS Digby 133. It is possible that the Macro version was copied from the Digby manuscript, but there is also the possibility that both were copied from elsewhere. Unlike &quot;The Pride of Life&quot; and the Macro plays, all of which survive only in manuscript form, &quot;Everyman&quot; exists as a printed text, in four different sources. Two of these four sources were printed by Pynson and two were printed by John Skot. Pamela King notes how Everyman&#x27;s status as a printed text pushes the boundaries of the medieval morality genre; she writes, &quot;It was also one of the very first plays to be printed, and in some respects belongs more to the early Tudor tradition than that of the late Middle Ages.&quot;

Other English moralities include the fifteenth-century plays &quot;Occupation &amp; Idleness&quot; and Henry Medwall&#x27;s &quot;Nature&quot;, as well as an array of sixteenth-century works like &quot;The World and the Child&quot; and John Skelton&#x27;s &quot;Magnificence&quot;. Additionally, there are other sixteenth-century plays that take on the typical traits of morality plays as outlined above, such as &quot;Hickscorner&quot;, but they are not generally categorized as such. The characters in &quot;Hickscorner&quot; are personified vices and virtues: Pity, Perseverance, Imagination, Contemplation, Freewill, and Hickscorner.

The French medieval morality play tradition is also quite rich: for an explanation of French medieval morality plays, visit the French Wikipedia page.

==History of the term &quot;morality play&quot;==

While scholars refer to these works as morality plays, the play texts do not refer to themselves as such; rather, the genre and its nomenclature have been retroactively conceived by scholarship as a way for modern scholars to understand a series of texts that share enough commonalities that they may be better understood together. Thus, as scholar Pamela King has noted, the morality plays&#x27; &quot;absolute cohesion as a group&quot; is &quot;bound to be questioned in any attempt to define that form in its individual manifestations and theatrical contexts.&quot; As for the history of the term itself in modern usage, premodern plays were separated into &#x27;moralities&#x27; and &#x27;mysteries&#x27; by Robert Dodsley in the 18th century; he categorized moralities as allegorical plays and mysteries as biblical plays, though nothing suggests that the moralities are not biblical or would not conceive of themselves as such.

Although they do not explicitly label themselves with the genre title morality plays, some of the play texts self-reflexively refer to themselves with the term &quot;game.&quot; While the Middle English spelling of &quot;game&quot; varies, the noun generally refers to a joy, festivity, amusement, or play. In the opening lines of &quot;The Pride of Life&quot;, the Prolocutor uses the word game when asking his audience to listen attentively, stating, Lordinges and ladiis that beth hende,
Herkenith al with mylde mode 
[How ou]re &quot;gam&quot; schal gyn and ende (l. 5-7, emphasis added).
In the closing lines of &quot;The Castle of Perseverance&quot;, the character Pater (meaning The Father) tells the audience, &quot;Thus endyth oure gamys&quot; (l. 3645).

While these plays appear to self-reflexively refer to their dramatic form, it is only &quot;Everyman&quot; that explicitly describes itself as a moral play, both in its incipit (&quot;Here begynneth a treatyse... in maner of a morall playe&quot;) and when a character, Messenger, states that this literary work will communicate &quot;By fygure [of] a morall playe&quot; (l. 3). However, one should not interpret these self-reflexive lines as simply moments that identify the genre of morality plays. Although the lines use the word &quot;playe,&quot; scholarship remains unsure if &quot;Everyman&quot; was actually staged as a dramatic performance, or if the text was a literary work intended for reading. The 1901 modern revival of the play, staged by Willian Poem, is the earliest record of the play&#x27;s production. Additionally, &quot;Everyman&quot; is a translation of the Dutch &quot;Elckerlijc&quot;, and, therefore, is not originally an English literary work. Thus, due to the uncertainty regarding the play&#x27;s status as a dramatic work, as well as the play&#x27;s non-English origins, &quot;Everyman&quot;″s self-reflective identification as a &quot;morall playe&quot; cannot confirm that the medieval moralities explicitly name themselves as a cohesive medieval morality genre.

==Characteristics==

Morality plays typically contain a protagonist who represents humanity as a whole, or an average layperson, or a human faculty; supporting characters are personifications of abstract concepts, each aligned with either good or evil, virtue or vice.

The clashes between the supporting characters often catalyze a process of experiential learning for the protagonist, and, as a result, provide audience members and/or readers with moral guidance, reminding them to meditate and think upon their relationship to God, as well as their social and/or religious community. Many, but not all, of the morality plays also encourage their audiences and/or readers to reflect upon the importance of penitential ritual.

Several academics have written upon these common thematic characteristics. Considering the plays&#x27; investment in staging the audience&#x27;s/reader&#x27;s relationship to God, Eleanor Johnson writes that Wisdom and Mankind, among several other medieval literary works, dramatically stage acts of contemplation to encourage the &quot;cultivation of self-conscious participation in God and of awareness of God&#x27;s participation in man,&quot; while &quot;creating literary experiences that initiate work of spiritual contemplation.&quot; Additionally, Julie Paulson explores the plays&#x27; investment in relating penitential ritual and community; she writes, &quot;In the moralities, it is impossible to split an interior self from the exterior practices and institutions that define it [...] By dramatizing their protagonists&#x27; fall and recovery through penance, the plays suggest how the experience of penitential ritual shapes penitents&#x27; understandings of the social and moral concepts central to the formation of Christian subjects.&quot; It is worth noting that Paulson, in making these summative comments, focuses her analysis on &quot;The Castle of Perseverance&quot;, the Macro plays, &quot;Everyman&quot;, and several moralities from the sixteenth century, and thus does not aim to characterize all moralities in her commentary.

=== Allegory and personification ===
Working to pinpoint a literary form that unites the moralities, the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms&quot; offers this definition: &quot;Morality plays are dramatized allegories, in which personified virtues, vices, diseases, and temptations struggle for the soul of Man.&quot; The same book defines allegory as &quot;a story or visual image with a second distinct meaning partially hidden behind its literal or visible meaning. The principal technique of allegory is personification, whereby abstract qualities are given human shape [...] allegory involves a continuous parallel between two (or more) levels of meaning in a story.&quot; While the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms&quot; uses the words &quot;allegory&quot; and &quot;personification&quot; in tandem with one another, the link between the two terms is a point of debate among scholars. Walter Melion and Bart M. Ramakers indicate that literary personifications are the building blocks for creating allegory: arguing for &quot;personification as a mode of allegorical signification,&quot; Melion and Ramakers state, &quot;As narrative, dramatic, or pictorial characters [personifications] develop a distinct reality,&quot; specifically, a reality that connects the literal and metaphorical interpretations of an allegory. However, Michael Silk insists that there is a fundamental difference between personification and allegory, as the representational figures within literary works are personifications that retain allegorical qualities. Additionally, Silk notes that &quot;Various medievalists correctly insist that in antiquity and the Middle Ages the connection [between allegory and personification] is not made,&quot; indirectly complicating the notion that morality plays are &quot;allegorical&quot; constructions employing personified concepts.

While an allegorical literary form implies that literal and metaphorical elements must &quot;continuously parallel&quot; one another, these plays do not always allegorically parallel theological qualities/concepts and concrete action, but rather humanize abstract concepts—thereby emphasizing characters as personifications, but not allegorical constructions. For example, examining the character Mercy in &quot;Mankind&quot;, Pamela King notes, &quot;Mercy the character begs God for the quality he represents, which is, strictly speaking, allegorical nonsense; he stands more for the human aegis by which mercy may be obtained, than for the quality itself.&quot; Similarly, Eleanor Johnson explains Mercy&#x27;s humanity, implying his status as a personified concept: &quot;Mercy suffers, Mercy trembles, Mercy is vulnerable; this is not an untouchable, impregnable Mercy [...] but rather a strikingly vulnerable and human one&quot;. Additionally, scholars complicate the notion that morality plays allegorically parallel the audience with the dramatic characters, indicating that the moralities actually incorporate the audience into the dramatic community. For example, writing on &quot;The Castle of Perseverance&quot;, Andrea Louise Young argues that the implied staging of the play (which includes the positioning of characters, as well as the placement of scaffolds and banners) encourages audience members to actively engage with the drama in a physical manner: &quot;In moving around the play space, spectators can change the meaning of the drama for themselves and the other spectators.&quot; Young notes that the play invites audience members to enter the dramatic space and consequently position themselves through both &quot;their eyes and their bodies,&quot; through where they choose to look and move in relation to the staged characters. King, Johnson, and Young indirectly show, without explicitly stating so, how the morality plays are not simply allegorical constructions, but rather fluid forms of personification that blur the distinctions between literal and metaphorical elements, characters and audience members/readers.
Still, scholarship generally adopts the literary labels &quot;allegory&quot;, &quot;personification&quot;, and &quot;personification allegory&quot; to explain the morality plays&#x27; formal depiction of the relationship between the abstract realm of concepts and everyday circumstances of human life. Pamela King notes the &quot;broadly allegorical&quot; form unifying the moralities. King suggests that the plays employ an allegorical framework of personification to metaphorically parallel, and conceptually separate, &quot;the ephemeral and imperfect world of everyday existence&quot; from an abstract &quot;eternal reality&quot;. While King indicates that the plays show the dramatic action to merely parallel and imitate eternal, abstract concepts, Julie Paulson argues that the moralities use personification allegory to reunite the concrete and the abstract. Paulson writes, &quot;in giving a word such as &#x27;wisdom&#x27; or &#x27;mankind&#x27; a body and a voice, personification allegory instead returns us to the lived experiences and particular circumstances that give those words their meanings&quot;. Additionally, Paulson underscores that plays such as &quot;The Castle of Perseverance&quot; and &quot;Everyman&quot; employ protagonists that personify humankind in an allegorical parallel to the audiences and readers of the play. As one can see, different authors employ the literary terms &quot;allegory&quot; and &quot;personification&quot; to argue various conclusions about the plays&#x27; separation or unification of abstract and concrete realities.

==== Justice and Equity as characters ====
In early English dramas Justice was personified as an entity which exercised &quot;theological virtue or grace, and was concerned with the divine pronouncement of judgment on man&quot;. However, as time progressed, more moralities began to emerge; it is during this transitional period where one begins to see Justice begin to assume more and more the qualities of a judge. The Justice in &quot;Respublica&quot; begins to concern himself with administering justice on &quot;the criminal element&quot;, rather than with the divine pronouncement on a generic representative of mankind. This is the first instance where one may observe a direct divergence from the theological virtues and concerns that were previously exerted by Justice in the morality plays of the fifteenth century. The Justice in &quot;Respublica&quot; is personified as a &quot;civil force rather than a theological one&quot;. An evolution of sorts takes place within the morals and agendas of Justice: he begins to don the Judicial Robe of prosecutor and executioner.

Another change envelops in the character of Justice during the sixteenth century in morality plays; Equity replaces Justice and assumes the judiciary duties previously performed by Justice. This changing of rulers, or preceding justices, is done when Equity declares that his brother Justice has been banished from the country and that he (Equity) will from now on take on the duties of the former monarch, Justice. This change of ruling heads is portrayed in the morality play, &quot;Liberality and Prodigality&quot;, where Equity serves Virtue in the detection, arrest, and punishment of Prodigality for the robbery and murder of Tenacity, a yeoman in the country of Middlesex. Virtue states,

So horrible a fact can hardly pleaded for favour:
Therefore go you, Equity, examine more diligently
The manner of this outrageous robbery:
And as the same by examination shall appear,
Due justice may be done in presence here. (&quot;Liberality and Prodigality&quot; 377)
The meta phases that Justice undergoes during the sixteenth century in morality plays, from &quot;Justice&quot; to &quot;Equity&quot; further illustrates the evolution of Justice; not only did Justice change from a &quot;theological abstraction to a civil servant&quot;, but he experienced a corporeal change as well.

One may readily observe the evolutionary progression of Justice as portrayed in the plays of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. One encounters Justice in the early-fifteenth-century moralities as a performer playing the role of a theological virtue or grace, and then one sees him develop to a more serious figure, occupying the position of an arbiter of justice during the sixteenth century. It is a journey of discovery and great change on which Justice welcomes one to embark as one leafs through the pages of morality plays.

=== Use of language and poetic technique ===
All of the morality plays, especially the Macro plays, show not only a mastery of language but also a light-hearted delight therein.
All of the plays are written in some sort of end-rhymed verse, but with much variation, not only between the plays but in individual plays as well. Often verse is used to contrast the personalities of good and evil characters. For example, in &quot;Wisdom&quot; the characters Wysdom and Anima speak in &quot;dignified, regular rhythm, almost always with four stresses&quot; and the rhyme scheme ABABBCBC whereas &quot;Lucifer prefers a tripping measure with two to five stress and only two rhymes.&quot; Other characters speak like Wisdom when under his influence and like Lucifer when under his. This system of contrastive verse is further refined in &quot;Mankind&quot; (Ramsay cxxxix). This is not the only use of variation in meter. For example, even without having to contrast with a good character&#x27;s manner of talking, when Mankind ascends to World&#x27;s scaffold in &quot;The Castle of Perseverance&quot;, Mundus, Voluptas, and Stultitia briefly switch from a four stress line to a faster and more excited two stress line (ll. 610–646), before returning to the four stress line after a scene change.
Alliteration is put to wonderful effect in &quot;The Castle of Perseverance&quot;. It appears in every stanza of more than four lines, though this is not evenly distributed, with later debate scenes employing less alliteration and the characters World, Belial, Flesh, and the seven sins alliterating nearly all of their lines, a habit the character Mankind learns from them. This is not to imply that alliteration is purely the mark of an evil character, for the bad angel alliterates very little and the neutral flag bearers who provide a summary of events at the beginning of the play script make extensive use of alliteration. At many points this is for ornamental effect: Michael R. Kelley places this in the context of a flamboyant style originating in Franco-Burgundian culture. But that is not all the playwright does with the effect. Clare Wright argues convincingly that alliteration among other formal structures encourages the actors to perform with a &quot;devilish corporeal register.&quot; She uses Belyal&#x27;s first speech as an example:Now I sytte, Satanas, in my sad synne, (Now sit I, Satan, steadfast in my sin,)

As devyl dowty, in draf as a drake. (As devil doughty, like a dragon on my sack.)
I champe and I chafe, I chocke on my chynne, (I champ and I chew and I thrust out my chin;)
I am boystous and bold, as Belyal the blake. (I am boisterous and bold as Belial the black!)
What folk that I grope thei gapyn and grenne, (The folk that I grasp they gasp and they groan,)
Iwys, fro Carlylle into Kent my carpynge thei take, (From Carlisle to Kent, my carping they take!)
Bothe the bak and the buttoke brestyth al on brenne, (Both the back and the buttocks burst burning unbound,)
Wyth werkys of wreche I werke hem mykyl wrake. (With works of vengeance, them wretched I make.)
In this speech, many of the alliterated phonemes are &quot;aggressively plosive&quot; and the /tʃ/ of &quot;I champe and I chafe, I choke on my chynne&quot; &quot;requires the speaker to part his lips and bare his teeth, bringing them together in an expression that resembles the clenched-tooth grimace of the devil in contemporary iconography.&quot; 
While mostly written in Middle English, some of the plays employ Latin and French to wonderful effect, both thematically significant and just plain humorous. Latin, of course, as the language of the Roman Catholic Church, was naturally important for the sort of religious discourse these plays engaged in. That does not mean that the playwrights were unwilling to play with Latin. For example, in &quot;Mankind&quot;, the character Mercy has a highly Latinizing manner of speech: in terms of vocabulary and meticulously tidy versification and sentence structure, all of which culminates in what one scholar calls &quot;inkhorn and churchily pedagogical.&quot; (Johnson 172). Mercy ends his first speech saying &quot;I besech yow hertyly, have this premedytacyon&quot; (l. 44), ending with a cumbersome Latin loanword. The first vice character on stage, Mischief, immediately picks up on Mercy&#x27;s excessive Latinisms and continues with this end rhyme in order to mock Mercy&#x27;s ornate speech:I beseche yow hertyly, leve yowr calcacyon.
Leve yowr chaffe, leve yowr corn, leve yowr dalyacyon.
Yowr wytt ys lytyll, yowr hede ys mekyll, ye are full of predycacyon (ll. 45-47).
Shortly thereafter Mischief fully switches to a nonsense mixture of Latin and English to continue mocking Mercy&#x27;s Latinizing, as well as to mangle Mercy&#x27;s earlier reference to the parable of the wheat and tares: &quot;Corn servit bredibus, chaffe horsibus, straw fyrybusque&quot; (l. 57, translated: Corn serves bread, chaff horses, straw fires). The result of this is not only to show that the formal structures of Latin are nothing more than formal structures that can be and misused, but also to create a tone shift from stuffy seriousness to an amusement that &quot;is central to the contemplative logic of the play&quot; by showing how even Latin can be &quot;dragged from the reaches of the church and into the mess of everyday life.&quot; There are many such examples of amusing nonsense Latin throughout the play.

In what is possibly most memorable of the vices&#x27; use of puns to twist good into bad, at one point in &quot;Mankind&quot; belt out a vibrant ditty on defecation that concludes, in a clear echo of &#x27;holy holy holy,&#x27; with &quot;Hoylyke, holyke, holyke! Holyke, holyke, holyke!&quot;, quite possibly a pun on &#x27;hole-lick&#x27; or &#x27;hole-leak&#x27;. Because of how this spoofs liturgical call-and-response worship as well as Nought&#x27;s invitation, &quot;Now I prey all the yemandry that ys here / To synge wyth us wyth a mery chere&quot; (ll. 333–4), this is likely a moment of audience participation to highlight their own &quot;susceptibilities to seduction by frivolity.&quot;

Finally, a peculiar trait that one will likely notice while reading these plays is the tendency of characters to describe in speech the actions they are (presumably) simultaneously performing as a way of verbally encoding stage directions. For example, in &quot;Mankind&quot;, the character Mankind says, &quot;Thys earth wyth my spade I shall assay to delffe&quot; (l. 328); this line, meaning, &quot;This earth with my spade I will attempt to dig,&quot; appears to serve as a stage direction for Mankind&#x27;s actor to literally dig. Besides simple actions, the same thing occurs in slapstick comedy or action scenes: when Mankind fights the vice-characters Nowadays, New Guise, and Nought, Mankind threatens to hit them with his shovel, saying, &quot;Go and do yowr labur! Gode lett yow never the! / Or wyth my spade I shall yow dynge, by the Holy Trinyté!&quot; (ll. 377–376); in response, New Guise says, &quot;Alas, my jewellys! I shall be schent of my wyff!&quot; (l. 381), directly indicating that Mankind has hit him as or right after he was threatening. This is not a trait restricted in the period to morality plays: a reason for the existence of this trait suggested by one scholar while discussing the Chester plays is that &quot;A spectator who could see the action without hearing the lines would not have a significantly different experience from someone who could hear them.&quot;

=== Thematic characteristics ===
What binds morality plays together as a genre are the strong family resemblances between them. These resemblances are most strong in regard to personification allegory as a literary form. The plays also resemble each other in regard to thematic content. They feature other common characteristics that are not necessarily common to all texts within the genre. Particularly notable thematic commonalities include: the transitoriness of life in relation to the afterlife, the importance of divine mercy, the use of misprision by vice characters, and the inevitable cycle of sin and penitence found in the Macro plays and Henry Medwall&#x27;s &quot;Nature&quot; (c. 1495). The emphasis on death in these plays underscores how to live a good life; in the medieval moralities and Medwall&#x27;s &quot;Nature&quot; in particular, virtue characters encourage the generic human protagonist to secure a good afterlife by performing good deeds, practicing penitence, or asking for divine mercy before their death.

John Watkins also suggests that the principal vices in medieval morality plays, avarice, pride, extortion, and ambition, throw anxieties over class mobility into relief. Fifteenth-century plays like &quot;Occupation and Idleness&quot; and later morality plays (commonly considered Tudor interludes, like John Skelton&#x27;s &quot;Magnyfycence&quot;) portray class-mobility positively. Whether for or against class mobility, morality plays engage with the subject. Other, smaller commonalities include audience participation, elaborate costuming, the virtue of labour, and the governance of the body/passions by the soul/reason in the service of Catholic virtue, money management, or the proper methods of governing a state.

The cohesion of the medieval morality play genre in particular is questionable as their family resemblances are loose in some instances. Despite being treated as the archetypal morality play, &quot;Everyman&quot;″s plot has little in common with the other plays in the genre. That said, &quot;Everyman&quot;″s straightforward focus on death, uninterested in the cycle of sin and penitence found in the Macro plays, resembles the &quot;Pride of Life&quot;. These two plays are less like the Macro plays than Medwall&#x27;s &quot;Nature&quot;, which is not traditionally considered as a medieval morality play. Scholars such as Katherine Little, who claims that &quot;Everyman&quot; is not a medieval morality play, continue to pull at the genre&#x27;s incohesive threading.

There are points of distinction in morality plays, beginning with &quot;Everyman&quot;, which can generally be attributed to humanism. According to Thomas Betteridge and Greg Walker, the majority of English dramas were religious in some form. However, plays are increasingly divorced from religion, and in particular, the staging of God and priests. While drama continued to contain religious themes, it was less and less often the case that religion was expressed directly. Betteridge and Walker also note that morality plays began to focus on the importance of education, specifically in regard to classical literature.

In Medwall&#x27;s &quot;Nature&quot;, the opening speech prompts readings of Ovid and Aristotle. However, a strong focus on education can be found in &quot;Occupation and Idleness&quot; as well, which stages an errant schoolboy being taught to respect and learn from his teacher—this play is roughly contemporaneous with the Macro plays, suggesting that humanist trends are traceable in the morality play much earlier than &quot;Everyman&quot;. There is also a general, continuous increase in the individuation and complexity of characters. In &quot;Nature&quot;, a prostitute is given a regular name rather than the name of a concept. In &quot;Everyman&quot;, Everyman&#x27;s mercantile language suggests a generic protagonist that represents a much smaller generic portion of humanity, &#x27;&quot;every merchant,&quot; in juxtaposition to Mankind&#x27;s earlier, full representation of all humanity. In Skelton&#x27;s &quot;Magnyfycence&quot;, Magnificence and the vices that corrupt him represent a particular person, King Henry VIII, and his court &#x27;minions&#x27; who were expelled for their poor behaviour.

Scholars have long noted that the medieval morality plays were written after the creation of Arundel&#x27;s Constitutions in 1407, whereby the Archbishop Thomas Arundel and his legislation sought to limit the preaching and teaching of religious matters, and outlawed any biblical translations into the vernacular. His Constitutions were written in explicit response to the threat of Lollardy. Since the morality plays do contain aspects of religious doctrine, such as the importance of penance and the salvation of the soul, scholars have questioned how it is that morality plays, in both the play-text and play form, continued to thrive throughout the fifteenth century. While scholars have not arrived at a satisfying conclusion, they nonetheless agree the morality plays were not seriously affected by the Constitutions, which suggests that either Arundel&#x27;s Constitutions, the divide between Lollardy and orthodoxy, or the role that morality plays themselves played in society, continue to be somewhat misunderstood.

=== Decline ===
The recent trend in scholarship of the period in which morality plays were written is to admit the great degree of continuity between late medieval and Renaissance cultures of Europe. Nevertheless, although morality plays reach their apogee in the sixteenth century, religious drama of this sort and in general all but disappeared thereafter. The cause of this change can be traced to both changes in religious sensibilities related to the Protestant Reformation and more broadly changes in theatre as an industry in England.

Mid-Tudor Protestants continued writing religious plays that were recognizably different from their Catholic predecessors. For example, whereas earlier plays emphasize the importance of sacraments, plays by Protestants emphasize justification by faith alone, and even cast vice characters as Catholic.

The relationship between theatricality and doctrine was also found more troubled by Protestants. Earlier plays were criticized for their embellishments to biblical material, to which Protestant religious drama tried to adhere more closely. However, in many ways they were formally quite similar to their predecessors in ways that sat beside the tendencies they wished to resist, thus challenging any attempts by scholars to place the development of theater in the period in an evolutionary model.

With the opening of permanent and professional playhouses that were producing plays full time in the late sixteenth century, drama became &quot;unmistakably an integral and compromised part of that same commercial culture&quot; which earlier religious drama had criticized, and therefor &quot;it could no longer seriously be maintained that it was primarily a pious activity.&quot; Thus, by the start of the seventeenth century a play like Everyman would be regarded &quot;as at best a waste of time and at worst a sinful, &#x27;popish&#x27; excess.&quot; However, this change &quot;had the positive effect of creating the space for the artistic and commercial speculation of the public stage as it emerged at the end of the Tudor period.&quot; It is in this space that the now better-known William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe would do their work.

=== Pre-Reformation versus Post-Reformation ===
The outward purpose of all morality plays is to instruct listeners on the means of receiving redemption: a purpose that some plays adhere to relatively consistently, while others delight so extensively in their vices that broad entertainment establishes itself as an equally dominant &quot;raison d&#x27;etre&quot;. However, morality plays after the Protestant Reformation are of a distinctly different didacticism than the morality plays before the Reformation.

Whereas the didactic elements pre-Reformation morality plays usually reinforced the practices or doctrines of medieval Catholicism (often focusing on sacraments like penance), the post-Reformation morality plays—when they concerned themselves with religious doctrine, rather than more secular concerns about education or good living (as with John Redford&#x27;s &quot;Play of Wit and Science&quot;) -- sometimes worked to destroy Catholic credibility and demonise the Catholic Church. Although many post-Reformation morality plays were often like their predecessors in that they also were concerned with the salvation of its audience (and in their tendency to allow playful depictions of vice to eclipse those concerns), they differed in that they believed that the theology promoted by pre-Reformation plays was antithetical to salvation. Thus, a major shift in focus, from concern for the individual&#x27;s moral behaviour to concern for the individual&#x27;s theological practices, occurred with the post-Reformation morality plays. The wave of Protestantism which fuelled the content of these plays dictated that more attention should be given to warning people against the Catholic Church than of their sinful nature. The means of redemption, according to the philosophy embedded in post-Reformation morality plays, is dependent upon the audience understanding the truthfulness of Protestant theology and verses and also the deceptiveness and wickedness of Catholic theology, whose best example is the secular play of Calderón.

The Vices in post-Reformation morality plays are sometimes depicted as being Catholic. At times this depiction is achieved through their physical appearance. For example, Vices in post-Reformation morality plays could be dressed as cardinals, friars, monks, or the pope. Other times, the Vice comes out and states he is a Catholic, or elucidates that he is Catholic by swearing a Catholic pledge. To deceive the victim of post-Reformation morality plays, the Vice typically assumes a new name to disguise what actual Vice he is.

<doc id="44716" wikidata="Q89575" url="?curid=44716" title="Razor wire">
<text>Barbed tape or razor wire is a mesh of metal strips with sharp edges whose purpose is to prevent trespassing by humans. The term &quot;razor wire&quot;, through long usage, has generally been used to describe barbed tape products. Razor wire is much sharper than the standard barbed wire; it is named after its appearance but is not razor sharp. The points are very sharp and made to rip and snag clothing and flesh.

The multiple blades of a razor-wire fence are designed to inflict serious cuts on anyone attempting to climb through or over it and therefore also has a strong psychological deterrent effect. Razor wire is used in many security applications because, although it can be circumvented relatively quickly by humans with tools, penetrating a razor-wire barrier without tools is very slow and typically injurious, often thwarting such attempts or giving security forces more time to respond.

== Use ==
The first use of barbed wire for warfare was in 1898 during the Spanish American War, thirty-one years after the first patents were issued in 1867. One of the most notable examples during the Spanish American War is the defense provided by the Moron-Jucardo Trocha. The trocha (or trench) stretched for fifty miles between the cities of Moron and Jucardo. Within this trench, and in addition to fallen trees, barbed wire was used. The barbed wire was arranged in a cat’s cradle formation that for every 12 yards of barbed fence built, 420 yards of barbed wire was strung (or 35 yards of wire per yard of fence).

Later versions of this type of barbed wire were manufactured by Germany during the First World War. The reason for this was a wartime shortage of wire to make conventional barbed wire. Therefore, flat wire with triangular cutting edges began to be punched out of steel strips (&quot;band barbed wire&quot;). A welcome side effect was that a comparable length of barbed wire of this new type could be produced in less time. These precursors to NATO wire did not yet have an inner wire for stabilization, were therefore easy to cut with tin snips, and were also not as robust as normal barbed wire. However, they withstood the wire cutters used at the time to cut normal barbed wire, as was common at the front.

An article in a 1918 issue of &quot;The Hardware Trade Journal&quot; tells the story under the headline: &quot;This Cruel War’s Abuse of Our Old Friend ‘Bob Wire.&#x27;&quot; After telling a little about Glidden and his invention, the article goes on as follows: &quot;Quite naturally some animals enclosed by Glidden’s fencing gashed themselves on the barbs. Just as naturally, men and boys tried to climb over or under those fences and had their clothes and flesh torn...These wounds upon man and beast and the suddenness with which Glidden’s barbs halted all living things came to the attention of military men, and the barbed wire entanglement of which we now read almost every day in the war news was born...And it may be said right here that soldiers who have been halted by wire entanglements while making a charge say the devil never invented anything nastier.&quot;

Starting in the late 1960s, barbed tape was typically found in prisons and secure mental hospitals, where the increased breaching time for a poorly equipped potential escapee was a definite advantage. Until the development of reinforced barbed tape in the early 1980s (and especially after the September 11 attacks), it was rarely used for military purposes or genuine high security facilities because, with the correct tools, it was easier to breach than ordinary barbed wire. Since then, some military forces have replaced barbed wire with barbed tape for many applications, mainly because it is slightly lighter for the same effective coverage, and it takes up very little space compared to barbed wire or reinforced barbed tape when stored on drums.

More recently, barbed tape has been used in more commercial and residential security applications. This is often primarily a visual deterrent since a well-prepared burglar can breach barbed wire and barbed tape barriers in similar amounts of time, using simple techniques such as cutting the wire or throwing a piece of carpet over its strands.

Due to its dangerous nature, razor wire/barbed tape and similar fencing/barrier materials are prohibited in some locales. Norway prohibits any barbed wire except in combination with other fencing, in order to protect domesticated animals from exposure.

== Construction ==

Razor wire has a central strand of high tensile strength wire, and a steel tape punched into a shape with barbs. The steel tape is then cold-crimped tightly to the wire everywhere except for the barbs. Flat barbed tape is very similar, but has no central reinforcement wire. The process of combining the two is called roll forming.

=== Types ===

Like barbed wire, razor wire is available as either straight wire, spiral (helical) coils, concertina (clipped) coils, flat wrapped panels or welded mesh panels. Unlike barbed wire, which usually is available only as plain steel or galvanized, barbed tape razor wire is also manufactured in stainless steel to reduce corrosion from rusting. The core wire can be galvanized and the tape stainless, although fully stainless barbed tape is used for permanent installations in harsh climatic environments or under water.

Barbed tape is also characterized by the shape of the barbs. Although there are no formal definitions, typically short barb barbed tape has barbs from , medium barb tape has barbs , and long barb tape has barbs .

==== According to the structure ====
* Helical type: Helical type razor wire is the most simple pattern. There are no concertina attachments and each spiral loop is left. It shows a natural spiral freely.
* Concertina type: It is the most widely used type in the security defense applications. The adjacent loops of helical coils are attached by clips at specified points on the circumference. It shows an accordion-like configuration condition.
* Blade type: The razor wire are produced in straight lines and cut into a certain length to be welded onto the galvanized or powder coated frame. It can be used individually as a security barrier.
** Flat type: A popular razor wire type with flat and smooth configuration (like Olympic rings). According to different technology, it can be clipped or the welded type.
** Welded type: The razor wire tape are welded into panels, then the panels are connected by clips or tie wires to form a continuous razor wire fence.
* Flattened type: A transformation of single coil concertina razor wire. The concertina wire is flattened to form the flat-type razor wire.

==== According to the coil type ====
* Single coil: Commonly seen and widely used type, which is available in both helical and concertina types.
* Double coil: A complex razor wire type to supply higher security grade. A smaller diameter coil is placed inside of the larger diameter coil. It is also available in both helical and concertina types.

<text>Soapstone (also known as steatite or soaprock) is a talc-schist, which is a type of metamorphic rock. It is composed largely of the magnesium-rich mineral talc. It is produced by dynamothermal metamorphism and metasomatism, which occur in subduction zones, changing rocks by heat and pressure, with influx of fluids but without melting. It has been a carving medium for thousands of years.

== Terminology ==
The definitions of the terms &quot;steatite&quot; and &quot;soapstone&quot; vary with the field of study. In geology, steatite is a rock that is, to a very large extent, composed of talc. The mining industry defines steatite as a high-purity talc rock that is suitable for the manufacturing of, for example, insulators; the lesser grades of the mineral can be called simply &quot;talc rock&quot;. Steatite can be used both in lumps (&quot;block steatite&quot;, &quot;lava steatite&quot;, &quot;lava grade talc&quot;), and in the ground form. While the geologists logically will use &quot;steatite&quot; to designate both forms, in the industry, &quot;steatite&quot; without additional qualifications typically means the steatite that is either already ground or to be used in the ground form in the future. If the ground steatite is pressed together into blocks, these are called &quot;synthetic block steatite&quot;, &quot;artificial block steatite&quot;, or &quot;artificial lava talc&quot;.

In industrial applications &quot;soapstone&quot; refers to dimension stone that consists of either amphibole-chlorite-carbonate-talc rock, talc-carbonate rock, or simply talc rock and is sold in the form of sawn slabs. &quot;Ground soapstone&quot; sometimes designates the ground waste product of the slab manufacturing.

==Petrology==
Petrologically, soapstone is composed predominantly of talc, with varying amounts of chlorite and amphiboles (typically tremolite, anthophyllite, and cummingtonite, hence its obsolete name, magnesiocummingtonite), and traces of minor iron-chromium oxides. It may be schistose or massive. Soapstone is formed by the metamorphism of ultramafic protoliths (e.g. dunite or serpentinite) and the metasomatism of siliceous dolomites.

By mass, &quot;pure&quot; steatite is roughly 63.37% silica, 31.88% magnesia, and 4.74% water. It commonly contains minor quantities of other oxides such as CaO or Al2O3.

Pyrophyllite, a mineral very similar to talc, is sometimes called soapstone in the generic sense, since its physical characteristics and industrial uses are similar, and because it is also commonly used as a carving material. However, this mineral typically does not have such a soapy feel as soapstone.

==Physical characteristics==
Soapstone is relatively soft because of its high talc content—talc has a definitional value of 1 on the Mohs hardness scale. Softer grades may feel similar to soap when touched, hence the name. No fixed hardness is given for soapstone because the amount of talc it contains varies widely, from as little as 30% for architectural grades such as those used on countertops, to as much as 80% for carving grades.

Soapstone is easy to carve; it is also durable and heat-resistant and has a high heat storage capacity. It has therefore been used for cooking and heating equipment for thousands of years.

Soapstone is often used as an insulator for housing and electrical components, due to its durability and electrical characteristics and because it can be pressed into complex shapes before firing. Soapstone undergoes transformations when heated to temperatures of into enstatite and cristobalite; on the Mohs scale, this corresponds to an increase in hardness to 5.5–6.5. The resulting material, harder than glass, is sometimes called &quot;lava&quot;.

==Historical usage==
=== Africa ===
Ancient Egyptian scarab signets and amulets were most commonly made from glazed steatite. The Yoruba people of West Nigeria used soapstone for several statues, most notably at Esie, where archaeologists have uncovered hundreds of male and female statues about half of life size. The Yoruba of Ife also produced a miniature soapstone obelisk with metal studs called &quot;the staff of Oranmiyan&quot;.

Soapstone mining in Tabaka, Kenya occurs in relatively shallow and accessible quarries in the surrounding areas of Sameta, Nyabigege and Bomware. These were at the time open to all to access provided they had the labor resources to do so. This mostly meant the men did the mining as they were custodian to the community land, meaning ancestral lands in Riamosioma, Itumbe, Nyatike etc.

=== Americas ===
Native Americans have used soapstone since the Late Archaic period. During the Archaic archaeological period (8000–1000 BC), bowls, cooking slabs, and other objects were made from soapstone. The use of soapstone cooking vessels during this period has been attributed to the rock&#x27;s thermal qualities; compared to clay or metal containers, soapstone retains heat more effectively. Use of soapstone in native American cultures continue to the modern day. Later, other cultures carved soapstone smoking pipes, a practice that continues today. The soapstone&#x27;s low heat conduction allows for prolonged smoking without the pipe heating up uncomfortably.

Indigenous peoples of the Arctic have traditionally used soapstone for carvings of both practical objects and art. The qulliq, a type of oil lamp, is carved out of soapstone and used by the Inuit and Dorset peoples. The soapstone oil lamps indicate these people had easy access to oils derived from marine mammals.

In the modern period, soapstone is commonly used for carvings in Inuit art.

In the United States, locally quarried soapstone was used for gravemarkers in 19th century northeast Georgia, around Dahlonega, and Cleveland as simple field stone and &quot;slot and tab&quot; tombs.

In Canada, soapstone was quarried in the Arctic regions like the western part of the Ungava Bay and the Appalachian Mountain System from Newfoundland.

=== Asia ===
The ancient trading city of Tepe Yahya in southeastern Iran was a center for the production and distribution of soapstone in the 5th to 3rd millennia BC.

Soapstone has been used in India as a medium for sculptures since at least the time of the Hoysala Empire, the Western Chalukya Empire and to an extent Vijayanagara Empire.

Even earlier, steatite was used as the substrate for Indus-Harappan seals. After the intricate carvings of icons and (yet undeciphered) symbols, the seals were heated above for several days to make them hard and durable to make the final seals used for making impressions on clay.

In China, during the Spring and Autumn period (771–476 BC), soapstone was carved into ceremonial knives. Soapstone was also used to carve Chinese seals.

Soapstone was used as a writing pencil in Myanmar as early as the 11th-century Pagan period. After that, it was still used as a pencil to write on Black Parabaik until the end of the Mandalay period (19th century).

=== Australia ===
Pipes and decorative carvings of local animals were made out of soapstone by Australian Aboriginal artist Erlikilyika () in Central Australia.

=== Europe ===
The Minoan civilization on Crete used soapstone. At the Palace of Knossos, a steatite libation table was found. Soapstone is relatively abundant in northern Europe. Vikings hewed soapstone directly from the stone face, shaped it into cooking pots, and sold these at home and abroad. In Shetland, there is evidence that these vessels were used for processing marine and dairy fats. Several surviving medieval buildings in northern Europe are constructed with soapstone, amongst them Nidaros Cathedral.

== Modern usage ==
In modern times, soapstone is most commonly used for architectural applications, such as counter tops, floor tiles, showerbases, and interior surfacing.

Soapstone is sometimes used for construction of fireplace surrounds, cladding on wood-burning stoves, and as the preferred material for woodburning masonry heaters because it can absorb, store, and evenly radiate heat due to its high density and magnesite (MgCO3) content. It is also used for countertops and bathroom tiling because of the ease of working the material and its property as the &quot;quiet stone&quot;. A weathered or aged appearance occurs naturally over time as the patina is enhanced.

Soapstone can be used to create molds for casting objects from soft metals, such as pewter or silver. The soft stone is easily carved and is not degraded by heating. The slick surface of soapstone allows the finished object to be easily removed.

Welders and fabricators use soapstone as a marker due to its resistance to heat; it remains visible when heat is applied. It has also been used for many years by seamstresses, carpenters, and other craftspeople as a marking tool, because its marks are visible but not permanent.

Resistance to heat made steatite suitable for manufacturing gas burner tips, spark plugs, and electrical switchboards.

=== Ceramics ===
Steatite ceramics are low-cost biaxial porcelains of nominal composition (MgO)3(SiO2)4. Steatite is used primarily for its dielectric and thermally-insulating properties in applications such as tile, substrates, washers, bushings, beads, and pigments. It is also used for high-voltage insulators, which have to stand large mechanical loads, such as insulators of mast radiators.

=== Crafts ===
Soapstone continues to be used for carvings and sculptures by artists and indigenous peoples. In Brazil, especially in the state of Minas Gerais, the abundance of soapstone mines allow local artisans to craft pots, pans, wine glasses, statues, jewel boxes, coasters, and vases from soapstone. These handicrafts are commonly sold in street markets found in cities across the state. Some of the oldest towns, notably Congonhas, Tiradentes, and Ouro Preto, still have some of their streets paved with soapstone from colonial times.

=== Mining ===
Architectural soapstone is mined in Canada, Brazil, India, and Finland and imported into the United States. Active North American mines include one south of Quebec City with products marketed by Canadian Soapstone, the Treasure and Regal mines in Beaverhead County, Montana mined by the Barretts Minerals Company, and another in central Virginia operated by the Alberene Soapstone Company.

Mining to meet worldwide demand for soapstone is threatening the habitat of India&#x27;s tigers.

=== Other ===
Soapstones can be put in a freezer and later used in place of ice cubes to chill alcoholic beverages without diluting. Sometimes called whiskey stones, these were first introduced around 2007. Most whiskey stones feature a semipolished finish, retaining the soft look of natural soapstone, while others are highly polished.

== Safety ==
People can be exposed to soapstone dust in the workplace via inhalation and skin or eye contact. Exposure above safe limits can lead to symptoms including coughing, shortness of breath, cyanosis, crackles, and pulmonary heart disease. Due to the potential presence of tremolite and crystalline silica in the dust, precautions should be taken to avoid occupational diseases such as asbestosis, silicosis, mesothelioma, and lung cancer.

===United States===
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has set the legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for soapstone exposure in the workplace as 20 million particles per cubic foot over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has set a recommended exposure limit of 6 mg/m3 total exposure and 3 mg/m3 respiratory exposure over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 3000 mg/m3, soapstone is immediately dangerous to life and health.

==Other names==
The local names for the soapstone vary: in Vermont, &quot;grit&quot; is used, in Georgia &quot;white-grinding&quot; and &quot;dark-grinding&quot; varieties are distinguished, and California has &quot;soft&quot;, &quot;hard&quot;, and &quot;blue&quot; talc. Also:

* Combarbalite stone, exclusively mined in Combarbalá, Chile, is known for its many colors. While they are not visible during mining, they appear after refining.
* Palewa and gorara stones are types of Indian soapstone.

<doc id="44719" wikidata="Q16533" url="?curid=44719" title="Judge">
<text>A judge is a person who over court proceedings, either alone or as a part of a judicial panel. In an adversarial system, the judge hears all the witnesses and any other evidence presented by the barristers or solicitors of the case, assesses the credibility and arguments of the parties, and then issues a ruling in the case based on their interpretation of the law and their own personal judgment. A judge is expected to conduct the trial impartially and, typically, in an open court.

The powers, functions, method of appointment, discipline, and training of judges vary widely across different jurisdictions. In some jurisdictions, the judge&#x27;s powers may be shared with a jury. In inquisitorial systems of criminal investigation, a judge might also be an examining magistrate. The presiding judge ensures that all court proceedings are lawful and orderly.

==Powers and functions==
The ultimate task of a judge is to settle a legal dispute in a final and publicly lawful manner in agreement with substantial partialities. Judges exercise significant governmental power. They can order police, military or judicial officials to execute searches, arrests, imprisonments, garnishments, detainment, seizures, deportations and similar actions. However, judges also supervise that trial procedures are followed, in order to ensure consistency and impartiality and avoid arbitrariness. The powers of a judge are checked by higher courts such as appeals courts and supreme courts.

The court usually has three main legally trained court officials: the judge, the prosecutor and the defence attorney. The role of a judge can vary between legal systems. In an adversarial system (common law), as in effect in the U.S. and England, the judge functions as an impartial referee, mainly ensuring correct procedure, while the prosecution and the defense present their case to a jury, often selected from common citizens. The main factfinder is the jury, and the judge will then finalize sentencing. Nevertheless, in smaller cases judges can issue summary judgments without proceeding to a jury trial. In an inquisitorial system (civil law), as in effect in continental Europe, there is no jury and the main factfinder is the judge, who will do the presiding, judging and sentencing on their own. As such, the judge is expected to apply the law directly, as in the French expression &quot;Le juge est la bouche de la loi&quot; (&quot;The judge is the mouth of the law&quot;). Furthermore, in some systems even investigations may be conducted by the judge, functioning as an examining magistrate.

Judges may work alone in smaller cases, but in criminal, family and other significant cases, they work in a panel. In some civil law systems, this panel may include lay judges. Unlike professional judges, lay judges are not legally trained, but unlike jurors, lay judges are usually volunteers and may be politically appointed. Judges are often assisted by law clerks, referendaries and notaries in legal cases and by bailiffs or similar with security.

===Requirements and appointment===
There are both volunteer and professional judges. A volunteer judge, such as an English magistrate, is not required to have legal training and is unpaid. Whereas, a professional judge is required to be legally educated; in the U.S., this generally requires a degree of Juris Doctor. Furthermore, significant professional experience is often required; for example, in the U.S., judges are often appointed from experienced attorneys. Judges are often appointed by the head of state. However in some jurisdictions, judges are elected in a political election.

Impartiality is often considered important for rule of law. Thus, in many jurisdictions judges may be appointed for life, so that they cannot be removed by the executive. However, in non-democratic systems, the appointment of judges may be highly politicized and they often receive instructions on how to judge, and may be removed if their conduct does not please the political leadership.

===Judge as an occupation===
Judges must be able to research and process extensive lengths of documents, witness testimonies, and other case material, understand complex cases and possess a thorough understanding of the law and legal procedure, which requires excellent skills in logical reasoning, analysis and decision-making. Excellent writing skills are also a necessity, given the finality and authority of the documents written. Judges work with people all the time; by the nature of the job, good dispute resolution and interpersonal skills are a necessity. Judges are required to have good moral character, i.e. there must be no history of crime. Professional judges often enjoy a high salary, in the U.S. the median salary of judges is $101,690 per annum, and federal judges earn $208,000–$267,000 per annum.

===Gender effects===
In many civil law countries in Europe the majority of judges are women: in 6 countries (Slovenia, Serbia, Latvia, Luxembourg, Greece and Hungary) women make more that 70% of judges of the first instance. In contrast, in common law countries (UK, Ireland, Malta and the United States) the situation is reverse: over 70% of judges of the first instance are men.

On the other hand, women are underrepresented in the Supreme Courts in the USA and all EU countries, except for Romania (in Romanian High Court of Cassation and Justice over 80% of judges are women).

===Age and retirement===
In the United States, federal judges are appointed &quot;for good behavior&quot;, which means in practice, that federal judges work until they die, voluntarily retire or are impeached. The death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg in the office in 2020 and suspension of Pauline Newman in 2023 reinvigorated the discussion about mandatory retirement age for federal judges, but such change would require a constitutional amendment and is unlikely to be implemented soon.

States have more flexibility in establishing a mandatory retirement age for judges, as was confirmed by the SCOTUS in its 1991 decision Gregory v. Ashcroft. As of 2015, 33 States and the District of Columbia had mandatory retirement ages for State court judges, which ranged from 70 to 75 for most (but is as high as 90 in Vermont).

A 2020 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found significant positive effects on the performance of state Supreme Courts with mandatory retirement age for judges. The authors advocated the adoption of mandatory retirement ages for all federal and state judges, although they felt, that the individual authorities should decide on the specific age for themselves.

==Symbols of office==
A variety of traditions have become associated with the rank or occupation. Gavels (a ceremonial hammer) are used by judges in many countries, to the point that the gavel has become a symbol of a judge. In many parts of the world, judges wear long robes (often in black or red) and sit on an elevated platform during trials (known as the bench).

American judges frequently wear black robes. American judges have ceremonial gavels, although American judges have court deputies or bailiffs and &quot;contempt of court&quot; power as their main devices to maintain decorum in the courtroom. However, in some of the Western United States, like California, judges did not always wear robes and instead wore everyday clothing. Today, some members of state supreme courts, such as the Maryland Supreme Court wear distinct dress. In Italy and Portugal, both judges and lawyers wear particular black robes.

In some countries, especially in the Commonwealth of Nations, judges wear wigs. The long wig often associated with judges is now reserved for ceremonial occasions, although it was part of the standard attire in previous centuries. A short wig resembling but not identical to a barrister&#x27;s wig (a Bench Wig) would be worn in court. This tradition, however, is being phased out in Britain in non-criminal courts.

In Oman, the judge wears a long stripe (red, green white), while the attorneys wear the black gown.

In Portugal and in the former Portuguese Empire, the judges used to carry a staff that was red for ordinary judges and white for the judges from the outside.

==Titles and forms of address==
===Asia===

==== Hong Kong ====
In Hong Kong, court proceedings are conducted in either English or Hong Kong Cantonese (a dialect of Yue Chinese). Judges of Hong Kong retain many of the English traditions such as wearing wigs and robes in trials.

In the lower courts, magistrates are addressed as &quot;Your worship&quot;, and district court judges as &quot;Your Honour&quot;.

In the superior courts of record, namely the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal and the High Court of Hong Kong (which consists of the Court of Appeal and the Court of First Instance), judges are addressed as &quot;My Lord&quot; or &quot;My Lady&quot; and referred to as &quot;Your Lordship&quot; or &quot;Your Ladyship&quot;, following the English tradition.

In writing, the post-nominal letters &quot;PJ&quot; is used to refer to a permanent judge of the Court of Final Appeal and &quot;NPJ&quot; to a non-permanent judge. In the High Court, the abbreviation &quot;JA&quot; is used to denote a justice of appeal, and the letter &quot;J&quot; refers to a judge of the Court of First Instance.

Masters of the High Court are addressed as &quot;Master&quot;.

When trials are conducted in Chinese, judges were addressed, in Cantonese, as &quot;Fat Goon Dai Yan&quot; () before the transfer of sovereignty from the United Kingdom to China, and as &quot;Fat Goon Gok Ha&quot; () since 1997. &quot;Fat Goon&quot; () means the word &quot;judge&quot;.

==== India ====

In India, judges of the Supreme Court and the High Courts were addressed as &quot;Your Lordship&quot; or &quot;My Lord&quot; and &quot;Your Ladyship&quot; or &quot;My Lady&quot;, a tradition directly attributable to England. The Bar Council of India had adopted a resolution in April 2006 and added a new Rule 49(1)(j) in the Advocates Act. As per the rule, lawyers can address the court as &quot;Your Honour&quot; and refer to it as &quot;Honourable Court&quot;. If it is a subordinate court, lawyers can use terms such as &quot;sir&quot; or any equivalent phrase in the regional language concerned. Explaining the rationale behind the move, the Bar Council had held that the words such as &quot;My Lord&quot; and &quot;Your Lordship&quot; were &quot;relics of the colonial past&quot;. The resolution has since been circulated to all state councils and the Supreme Court for adoption but over five years now, the resolution largely remained on paper.

However, in an unprecedented move in October 2009, one of the judges of Madras HC, Justice K Chandru had banned lawyers from addressing his court as &quot;My Lord&quot; and &quot;Your Lordship&quot;.

====Israel====

In Israel, the judges () of all courts are addressed as &quot;Sir&quot;, &quot;Madam&quot; () or &quot;Your Honor&quot; (). Typically after every naming you will hear &quot;haShofét&quot;, meaning &quot;the judge&quot; after the respective address. For example, &quot;Your Honor the Judge&quot; would be (&quot;kevod haShofét&quot;).

In appeals courts (&quot;hovioikeus&quot;) an ordinary judge has the title &quot;hovioikeudenneuvos&quot;, the chairman of a section is &quot;hovioikeudenlaamanni&quot; and the court is led by a &quot;presidentti&quot;.

In law reports, the Chief Justice of Ireland has the postnominal &quot;CJ&quot;, the Presidents of the other Courts have the postnominal &quot;P&quot;, and all other judges &quot;J&quot;, e.g. &quot;Smith J&quot;.

====United Kingdom====
=====England and Wales=====
In the Courts of England and Wales, Supreme Court judges are called Justices of the Supreme Court. Justices of the Supreme Court who do not hold life peerages are now given the courtesy style &quot;Lord&quot; or &quot;Lady&quot;. Justices of the Supreme Court are addressed as &quot;My Lord/Lady&quot; in court. In the law reports, the Justices of the Supreme Court are usually referred to as &quot;Lord/Lady N&quot;, although the Weekly Law Reports appends the post-nominal letters &quot;JSC&quot; (e.g. &quot;Lady Smith JSC&quot;). The President and Deputy President of the Court are afforded the post-nominal letters PSC and DPSC respectively. Only experienced barristers or solicitors are usually appointed as judges.

Judges of the High Court and Court of Appeal are addressed (when sitting in those courts) as &quot;My Lord&quot; or &quot;My Lady&quot; and referred to as &quot;Your Lordship&quot; or &quot;Your Ladyship&quot;.

Judges of the Court of Appeal, also called Lords Justice of Appeal, are referred to as &quot;Lord Justice N&quot; or &quot;Lady Justice N&quot;. In legal writing, Lords Justices of Appeal are afforded the post nominal letters &quot;LJ&quot;: for example, Smith LJ.

When a Justice of the High Court who is not present is being referred to they are described as &quot;Mr./Mrs./Ms. Justice &quot;N.&quot;&quot; In legal writing, the post-nominal letter &quot;J&quot; is used to denote a Justice (male or female) of the High Court; for example, a Justice Smith is referred to as Smith J. Unlike American English, no comma is used to offset the letter J from the Justice&#x27;s name. The full stop after the preceding examples terminates the sentence, not the abbreviation, and the abbreviation can be used mid-sentence in prose in formal legal writing. Masters of the High Court are addressed as &quot;Master&quot;. Insolvency and Companies Court judges in the High Court are addressed as &quot;Judge&quot;.

Circuit judges and recorders are addressed as &quot;Your Honour&quot;. Circuit judges are referred to as &quot;His/Her Honour Judge N&quot;. In writing, this title is occasionally abbreviated as &quot;HHJ&quot; or &quot;HH Judge N&quot;, but not in legal writing. District judges and tribunal judges are addressed as &quot;Sir/Madam&quot;.

Magistrates are usually still addressed as &quot;Your Worship&quot; in much of England. Magistrates are also addressed as &quot;Sir/Madam&quot;.

=====Scotland=====
In the Courts of Scotland judges in the Court of Session, High Court of Justiciary and the sheriff courts are all addressed as &quot;My Lord&quot; or &quot;My Lady&quot; and referred to as &quot;Your Lordship&quot; or &quot;Your Ladyship&quot;.

Justices of the peace in justice of the peace courts are addressed and referred to as &quot;Your Honour&quot;.

=====Northern Ireland=====
The judicial system of Northern Ireland is very similar to that of England and Wales, and superior court judges are addressed the same way as those in England and Wales. However, there are a few differences at the lower levels.

In Northern Ireland, the equivalent to a circuit judge is a county court judge, and they are addressed and titled the same way as a circuit judge is in England and Wales. The senior county court judges assigned to the county court divisions of Belfast and Derry have the titles of Recorder of Belfast and Recorder of Londonderry (or Derry) respectively, but are addressed the same as other county court judges. A district judge sitting in the County Court is addressed as &quot;Your Honour&quot;.

A district judge (magistrates&#x27; court) is addressed as &quot;Your Worship&quot;. A lay magistrate, in cases where they are present, is also addressed as &quot;Your Worship&quot;, and may use the post-nominals &quot;LM&quot;, e.g. &quot;John Smith LM&quot;.

===North America===

====Canada====
In general, Canadian judges may be addressed directly, depending on the province, as &quot;My Lord&quot;, &quot;My Lady&quot;, &quot;Your Honour&quot; or &quot;Justice&quot; and are formally referred to in the third person as &quot;The Honourable Mr. (or Madam) Justice &#x27;Forename Surname. Less formally, judges of a Superior Court are referred to as &quot;Justice &#x27;Surname, not as &quot;Judge &#x27;Surname. When referred to in a decision of a court, judges&#x27; titles are often abbreviated to the suffix &quot;J.&quot;, so that Justice Smith will be referred to as Smith J. Judges in some superior courts are addressed as &quot;My Lord&quot; or &quot;My Lady&quot;. In Ontario, judges are rarely referred to as &quot;My Lord&quot; or &quot;My Lady&quot;, but only as &quot;Your Honour&quot; at the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. Formerly, translations of these titles such as &quot;Votre Honneur&quot; (&quot;your honour&quot;) or &quot;Votre Seigneurie&quot; (&quot;your lordship&quot;) were used in French; today, only &quot;Monsieur le juge&quot; and &quot;Madame la juge&quot; are officially used. Both the titles &quot;judge&quot; and &quot;justice&quot; are translated &quot;juge&quot;.

Generally, it is only appropriate to use the term &quot;judge&quot; when speaking of an anonymous or general position, such as &quot;the trial judge&quot;, or when referring to a member of an inferior or provincial court such as the Ontario Court of Justice. The exception is Citizenship Judges who are referred to only as &quot;Judge &#x27;Surname in accordance with their appointment as independent decision makers of the Citizenship Commission.

Like other members of the Commonwealth, a justice of the peace is addressed as &quot;Your Worship&quot;, and a Master of a Superior Court is referred to as &quot;Master&quot;. As of December 7, 2018, Ontario Court Masters are addressed in English as &quot;Your Honour&quot; and in French as &quot;Votre Honneur&quot; and no longer as &quot;Master&quot;.

====United States====
In many states throughout the United States, a judge is addressed as &quot;Your Honor&quot; or &quot;Judge&quot; when presiding over the court. &quot;Judge&quot; may be more commonly used by attorneys and staff, while either may be commonly used by the plaintiff or defendant. Notably, the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, the largest unified trial court in the United States, has a rule that the judge shall be addressed only as &quot;Your Honor&quot; while in court, and never as &quot;Judge&quot;, &quot;Judge (name)&quot;, &quot;ma&#x27;am&quot;, or &quot;sir&quot;. This is somewhat unusual as &quot;Judge&quot; and &quot;Judge (name)&quot; or similar forms of address are considered appropriate and respectful in many other courts.

The judges of the Supreme Court of the United States, and the judges of the supreme courts of several US states and other countries are called &quot;justices&quot;. Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States and Justices of other courts are addressed as &quot;Justice (name)&quot;. The Chief Justice of the United States is formally addressed as &quot;Mr. or Madam Chief Justice&quot; but also may be identified and addressed as &quot;Chief Justice (name)&quot;.

Regardless of the specific term employed (judge or justice), the formal title is reduced to the postnominal abbreviation &quot;J.&quot; in case citations and certain case law reporters when it is necessary to identify the author of a cited opinion. In American English, the postnominal &quot;J.&quot; is always divided from the judge&#x27;s name by a comma and a space, so that a citation to a dissenting opinion by Associate Justice Antonin Scalia would warn that the cited opinion is not the majority opinion with the parenthetical notation &quot;Scalia, J., dissenting&quot;. The plural form is JJ. Unlike British English, this abbreviation style is used only in case citations, and is not used mid-sentence in regular prose (as distinguished from case citations dropped into sentences as parentheticals). Thus, a prose sentence discussing the actual contents of a dissenting opinion right before a case citation to that opinion would refer to the reasoning of &quot;Justice Scalia&quot;, not &quot;Scalia, J.&quot;

The justices of the supreme courts usually hold higher offices than any other judges in a jurisdiction, including a justice of the peace, a judge who holds police court in some jurisdictions and who may also try small claims and misdemeanors. However, the State of New York inverts this usual order. The initial trial court in this state is called the Supreme Court of New York, and its judges are called &quot;justices&quot;. The next highest appellate court is the Supreme Court, Appellate Division, whose judges are also called &quot;justices&quot;. However, the highest court in New York is called the New York Court of Appeals, whose members are called &quot;judges&quot;.

Judges in certain jurisdictions, such as New York and New Jersey, who deal with guardianships, trusts and estates are known as &quot;surrogates&quot;.

A &quot;senior judge&quot;, in US practice, is a retired judge who handles selected cases for a governmental entity while in retirement, on a part-time basis.

Subordinate or inferior jurisdiction judges in US legal practice are sometimes called magistrates, although in the federal judiciary of the United States, they are called magistrate judges. Subordinate judges in US legal practice who are appointed on an &quot;ad hoc&quot; case-by-case basis, particularly in cases where a great deal of detailed and tedious evidence must be reviewed, are often called &quot;masters&quot; or &quot;special masters&quot;.

Judges of courts of specialized jurisdiction (such as bankruptcy courts or juvenile courts) were sometimes known officially as &quot;referees&quot;, but the use of this title is in decline. Judges sitting in courts of equity in common law systems (such as judges in the equity courts of Delaware) are called &quot;chancellors&quot;.

Individuals with judicial responsibilities who report to an executive branch official, rather than being a part of the judiciary, are often called &quot;administrative law judges&quot; (ALJs) in US practice. Historically, such officials were previously known as hearing examiners or referees before American English settled on the ALJ title. They commonly make initial determinations regarding matters such as workers&#x27; compensation, eligibility for government benefits, regulatory matters, and immigration determinations.

Judges who derive their authority from a contractual agreement of the parties to a dispute, rather than a governmental body, are called arbitrators. They typically do not receive the honorific forms of address nor do they bear the symbolic trappings of a publicly appointed judge. However, it is now common for many retired judges to serve as arbitrators, and they will often write their names as if they were still judges, with the parenthetical &quot;(Ret.)&quot; for &quot;Retired&quot;.

Unlike many civil law countries which have some courts on which panels of judges with nearly equal status composed of both legally trained professional judges and lay judges who lack legal training and are not career judges, the United States legal system (like most Anglo-American legal systems) makes a clear distinction between professional judges and laypeople involved in deciding a case who are jurors who are part of a jury. Most but not all US judges have professional credentials as lawyers. Non-lawyer judges in the United States are often elected, and are typically either justices of the peace or part-time judges in rural limited jurisdiction courts. A non-lawyer judge typically has the same rights and responsibilities as a lawyer who is a judge holding the same office and is addressed in the same manner.

===Oceania===

====Australia====

In Australia judges and, since 2007, magistrates, of all jurisdictions including the High Court of Australia are now addressed as &quot;Your Honour&quot;. In legal contexts, they are referred to as &quot;His/Her Honour&quot; and &quot;the Honourable Justice Surname&quot; (for judges of superior courts) or &quot;his/her Honour Judge Surname&quot; (for inferior courts). Outside legal contexts, the formal terms of address are &quot;Judge&quot; (for puisne justices) or &quot;Chief Justice&quot; (for chief justices).

The title for most puisne judges is &quot;Justice&quot;, which is abbreviated in law reports to a postnominal &quot;J&quot;, in the form &quot;Surname J&quot;. Chief Justices of the High Court and of state Supreme Courts are titled &quot;Chief Justice&quot;, which is abbreviated in law reports to a postnomial &quot;CJ&quot;. Judges in State Supreme Courts with a separate Court of Appeal division (New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia) are referred to as Justices/Judges of the Appeal (abbreviated &quot;Surname JA&quot;), while the President of the Court of Appeal is referred to as &quot;President&quot; (abbreviated &quot;Surname P&quot;).

==== New Zealand ====
In New Zealand, judges of the District Court of New Zealand generally referred to as &quot;His/Her Honour&quot; or &quot;Sir/Madame&quot;. Judges from the High Court, Appeals Court, and Supreme Court are referred to as &quot;Justice [Surname]&quot;. In social settings, it is appropriate to use &quot;Judge&quot; in all cases.

===South America===

==== Brazil ====

In Brazil, judges are simply called &quot;Juiz&quot; or &quot;Juíza&quot; (male and female forms of &quot;judge&quot;) and traditionally addressed to as &quot;Vossa Excelência&quot; (, translated as &#x27;Your Honor&#x27;) or &quot;Meritíssimo&quot; (&#x27;Honorable&#x27;, but it is used as a pronoun also translated as &#x27;Your Honor&#x27;). Judges that are part of a panel in a State Court, or Federal Court are called &quot;desembargadores&quot;. Judges sitting in the higher courts (Supremo Tribunal Federal, Superior Tribunal de Justiça, Tribunal Superior do Trabalho, Superior Tribunal Militar and Tribunal Superior Eleitoral) are called &quot;ministro&quot; or &quot;ministra&quot; (male and female forms of &quot;minister&quot;) and also referred to as &quot;Vossa Excelência&quot;.

===International courts===
At the International Court of Justice, judges may be addressed by the titles they received in their countries of origin.

Judges of the International Criminal Court are referred to as &quot;judge&quot;.

<text>A jury is a sworn body of people (jurors) convened to hear evidence, make findings of fact, and render an impartial verdict officially submitted to them by a court, or to set a penalty or judgment. Most trial juries are &quot;petit juries&quot;, and consist of up to 15 people. A larger jury known as a grand jury has been used to investigate potential crimes and render indictments against suspects, and consists of between 16 and 23 jurors.

The jury system developed in England during the Middle Ages and is a hallmark of the English common law system. Juries are commonly used in countries whose legal systems derive from the British Empire, such as the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, and Ireland. They are not used in most other countries, whose legal systems are based upon European civil law or Islamic sharia law, although their use has been spreading. Instead, typically guilt is determined by a single person, usually a professional judge.

The word &quot;jury&quot; has also been applied to randomly-selected bodies with other purposes, such as policy juries.

==Types of jury ==
The &quot;petit jury&quot; (or &quot;trial jury&quot;, sometimes &quot;petty jury&quot;) hears the evidence in a trial as presented by both the plaintiff (petitioner) and the defendant (respondent) (also known as the complainant and defendant within the English criminal legal system). After hearing the evidence and often jury instructions from the judge, the group retires for deliberation, to consider a verdict. The majority required for a verdict varies. In some cases it must be unanimous, while in other jurisdictions it may be a majority or supermajority. A jury that is unable to come to a verdict is referred to as a hung jury.

===Grand jury===

A grand jury, a type of jury now confined mostly to federal courts and some state jurisdictions in the United States and Liberia, determines whether there is enough evidence for a criminal trial to go forward. Grand juries carry out this duty by examining evidence presented to them by a prosecutor and issuing indictments, or by investigating alleged crimes and issuing presentments. Grand juries are usually larger than trial juries: for example, U.S. federal grand juries have between 16 and 23 members. The Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees Americans the constitutional right to be free from charges for &quot;capital, or otherwise infamous&quot; crimes unless they have been indicted by a grand jury, although this right applies only to federal law, not state law.

In addition to their primary role in screening criminal prosecutions and assisting in the investigation of crimes, grand juries in California, Florida, and some other U.S. states are sometimes utilized to perform an investigative and policy audit function similar to that filled by the Government Accountability Office in the United States federal government and legislative state auditors in many U.S. states.

In Ireland and other countries in the past, the task of a grand jury was to determine whether the prosecutors had presented a &quot;true bill&quot; (one that described a crime and gave a plausible reason for accusing the named person).

===Coroner&#x27;s jury===

Another kind of jury, known as a coroner&#x27;s jury can be convened in some common law jurisdiction in connection with an inquest by a coroner. A coroner is a public official (often an elected local government official in the United States), who is charged with determining the circumstances leading to a death in ambiguous or suspicious cases, such as of Jeffrey Epstein. A coroner&#x27;s jury is generally a body that a coroner can convene on an optional basis in order to increase public confidence in the coroner&#x27;s finding where there might otherwise be a controversy. In practice, coroner&#x27;s juries are most often convened in order to avoid the appearance of impropriety by one governmental official in the criminal justice system toward another if no charges are filed against the person causing the death, when a governmental party such as a law enforcement officer is involved in the death.

=== Policy jury ===
==Historical roots==

The modern jury evolved out of the ancient custom of many ancient Germanic tribes whereby a group of men of certain social standing was used to investigate crimes and judge the accused. The same custom evolved into the vehmic court system in medieval Germany. In Anglo-Saxon England, juries investigated crimes. After the Norman Conquest, some parts of the country preserved juries as the means of investigating crimes. The use of ordinary members of the community to consider crimes was unusual in ancient cultures, but was nonetheless also found in ancient Greece.

The modern jury trial evolved out of this custom in the mid-12th century during the reign of Henry II. Juries, usually 6 or 12 men, were an &quot;ancient institution&quot; even then in some parts of England, at the same time as Members consisted of representatives of the basic units of local government—&quot;hundreds&quot; (an administrative sub-division of the shire, embracing several vills) and villages. Called juries of presentment, these men testified under oath to crimes committed in their neighbourhood. The Assize of Clarendon in 1166 caused these juries to be adopted systematically throughout the country. The jury in this period was &quot;self-informing,&quot; meaning it heard very little evidence or testimony in court. Instead, jurors were recruited from the locality of the dispute and were expected to know the facts before coming to court. The source of juror knowledge could include first-hand knowledge, investigation, and less reliable sources such as rumour and hearsay.

Between 1166 and 1179 new procedures including a division of functions between the sheriff, the jury of local men, and the royal justices ushered in the era of the English Common Law. Sheriffs prepared cases for trial and found jurors with relevant knowledge and testimony. Jurors &#x27;found&#x27; a verdict by witnessing as to fact, even assessing and applying information from their own and community memory—little was written at this time and what was, such as deeds and writs, were subject to fraud. Royal justices supervised trials, answered questions as to law, and announced the court&#x27;s decision which was then subject to appeal. Sheriffs executed the decision of the court. These procedures enabled Henry II to delegate authority without endowing his subordinates with too much power.:293

In 1215 the Catholic Church removed its sanction from all forms of the ordeal—procedures by which suspects up to that time were &#x27;tested&#x27; as to guilt (e.g., in the ordeal of hot metal, molten metal was sometimes poured into a suspected thief&#x27;s hand. If the wound healed rapidly and well, it was believed God found the suspect innocent, and if not then the suspect was found guilty). With trial by ordeal banned, establishing guilt would have been problematic had England not had forty years of judicial experience. Justices were by then accustomed to asking jurors of presentment about points of fact in assessing indictments; it was a short step to ask jurors if they concluded the accused was guilty as charged.:358

The so-called Wantage Code provides an early reference to a jury-like group in England, wherein a decree issued by King Æthelred the Unready (at Wantage, c. 997) provided that in every Hundred &quot;the twelve leading thegns together with the reeve shall go out and swear on the relics which are given into their hands, that they will not accuse any innocent man nor shield a guilty one.&quot; The resulting Wantage Code formally recognized legal customs that were part of the Danelaw.

The testimonial concept can also be traced to Normandy before 1066, when a jury of nobles was established to decide land disputes. In this manner, the Duke, being the largest land owner, could not act as a judge in his own case.

One of the earliest antecedents of modern jury systems is the jury in ancient Greece, including the city-state of Athens, where records of jury courts date back to 500 BCE. These juries voted by secret ballot and were eventually granted the power to annul unconstitutional laws, thus introducing the practice of judicial review. In modern justice systems, the law is considered &quot;self-contained&quot; and &quot;distinct from other coercive forces, and perceived as separate from the political life of the community,&quot; but &quot;all these barriers are absent in the context of classical Athens. In practice and in conception the law and its administration are in some important respects indistinguishable from the life of the community in general.&quot;

In juries of the Justices in Eyre, the bailiff of the hundred would choose 4 electors who in turn chose 12 others from their hundred, and from these were selected 12 jurors.

===17th-18th century===
From the 17th century until 1898 in Ireland, Grand Juries also functioned as local government authorities. 

In 1730, the British Parliament passed the Bill for Better Regulation of Juries. The Act stipulated that the list of all those liable for jury service was to be posted in each parish and that jury panels would be selected by lot, also known as sortition, from these lists. Its aim was to prevent middle-class citizens from evading their responsibilities by financially putting into question the neutrality of the under-sheriff, the official entrusted with impaneling juries. Prior to the Act, the main means of ensuring impartiality was by allowing legal challenges to the sheriff&#x27;s choices. The new provisions did not specifically aim at establishing impartiality but had the effect of reinforcing the authority of the jury by guaranteeing impartiality at the point of selection.

In some American colonies (such as in New England and Virginia) and less often in England, juries also handed down rulings on the law in addition to rulings on the facts of the case. The American grand jury was also indispensable to the American Revolution by challenging the Crown and Parliament, including by indicting British soldiers, refusing to indict people who criticized the crown, proposing boycotts and called for the support of the war after the Declaration of Independence.

In the late 18th century, English and colonial civil, criminal and grand juries played major roles in checking the power of the executive, the legislature and the judiciary.

===19th century===
In 1825, the rules concerning juror selection in England were consolidated. Property qualifications and various other rules were standardised, although an exemption was left open for towns which &quot;possessed&quot; their own courts. This reflected a more general understanding that local officials retained a large amount of discretion regarding which people they actually summoned. In the late eighteenth century, King has found evidence of butchers being excluded from service in Essex; while Crosby has found evidence of &quot;peripatetic ice cream vendors&quot; not being summoned in the summer time as late as 1923.

With the adoption of the Juries Act (Ireland) 1871, property qualifications for Irish jurors were partially standardized and lowered, so that jurors were drawn from among men who paid above a certain amount of taxes for poor relief. This expanded the number of potential jurors, even though only a small minority of Irish people were eligible to serve.

Until the 1870s, jurors in England and Ireland worked under the rule that they could not leave, eat, drink, or have a fire to warm themselves by, though they could take medicine. This rule appears to have been imposed with the idea that hungry jurors would be quicker to compromise, so they could reach a verdict and therefore eat. Jurors who broke the rule by smuggling in food were sometimes fined, and occasionally, especially if the food were believed to come from one of the parties in the case, the verdict was quashed. Later in the century, jurors who did not reach a verdict on the first day were no longer required to sleep in the courthouse, but were sometimes put up, at the expense of the parties in the trial, at a hotel.

===20th century===
After 1919 in England, women were no longer excluded from jury service by virtue of their sex, although they still had to satisfy the ordinary property qualifications. The exemption which had been created by the 1825 Act for towns which &quot;possessed&quot; their own courts meant ten towns were free to ignore the property qualifications. This amplified in these towns the general understanding that local officials had a free hand in summoning freely from among those people who were qualified to be jurors. In 1920, three of these ten towns – Leicester, Lincoln, and Nottingham – consistently empanelled assize juries of six men and six women; while at the Bristol, Exeter, and Norwich assizes no women were empanelled at all. This quickly led to a tightening up of the rules, and an abolition of these ten towns&#x27; discretion. After 1922, trial juries throughout England had to satisfy the same qualifications; although it was not until the 1980s that a centralised system was designed for selecting jurors from among the people who were qualified to serve. This meant there was still a great amount of discretion in the hands of local officials.

==Summoning jurors==

Potential jurors are summoned to the courthouse for service. In the past, jurors were identified manually, by local authorities making lists of men they believed to be eligible for service. In 19th-century Ireland, the list of eligible jurors in each court district was alphabetized, and in the later part of the century, the sheriff was required to summon one potential juror from each letter of the alphabet, repeating as needed until a sufficient number of men had been summoned, usually between 36 and 60 men for the quarterly assizes. Normally the sheriff or a constable went to each juror&#x27;s home to show him the summons paperwork (&quot;venire facias de novo&quot;); it wasn&#x27;t until 1871 that any Irish jurors could be summoned by mail. In modern times, juries are often initially chosen randomly, usually from large databases identifying the eligible population of adult citizens residing in the court&#x27;s jurisdictional area (e.g., identity cards, drivers&#x27; licenses, tax records, or similar systems), and summons are delivered by mail. 

In the past, qualifications included things like being an adult male, having a good reputation in the community, and owning land. Modern requirements may include being a citizen of that country and having a fluent understanding of the language used during the trial. In addition to a minimum age, some countries have a maximum age. Some countries disqualify people who have been previously convicted of a crime or excuse them on various grounds, such as being ill or holding certain jobs or offices. 

Serving on a jury is normally compulsory for individuals who are qualified for jury service. Skipping service may be inevitable in a small number of cases, as a summoned juror might become ill or otherwise become unexpectedly unable to appear at the court. However, a significant fraction of summoned jurors may fail to appear for other reasons. In 1874, there was a report that one-third of summoned Irish jurors failed to appear in court.

When an insufficient number of summoned jurors appear in court to handle a matter, the law in many jurisdictions empowers the jury commissioner or other official convening the jury to involuntarily impress bystanders in the vicinity of the place where the jury is to be convened to serve on the jury.

==Trial jury size==
As the concept of a jury was spread through the British Empire, first to Ireland and then to other countries, the size of the jury was one of the details that was adapted to the local culture. The tradition in England was to have twelve jurors, but other countries use smaller juries, and some, such as Scotland, use larger juries.

The size of the jury is to provide a &quot;cross-section&quot; of the public. In &quot;Williams v. Florida&quot;, , the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that a Florida state jury of six was sufficient, that &quot;the 12-man panel is not a necessary ingredient of &quot;trial by jury,&quot; and that respondent&#x27;s refusal to impanel more than the six members provided for by Florida law &quot;did not violate petitioner&#x27;s Sixth Amendment rights as applied to the States through the Fourteenth.&quot; In &quot;Ballew v. Georgia&quot;, , the Supreme Court ruled that the number of jurors could not be reduced below six.

In &quot;Brownlee v The Queen&quot; (2001) 207 CLR 278, the High Court of Australia unanimously held that a jury of 12 members was not an essential feature of &quot;trial by jury&quot; in section 80 of the Australian Constitution.

In Scotland, a jury in a criminal trial consists of 15 jurors, which is thought to be the largest in the world. In 2009 a review by the Scottish Government regarding the possibility of reduction led to the decision to retain 15 jurors, with the Cabinet Secretary for Justice stating that after extensive consultation, he had decided that Scotland had got it &quot;uniquely right&quot;. Trials in the Republic of Ireland which are scheduled to last over 2 months can, but do not have to, have 15 jurors.

A study by the University of Glasgow suggested that a civil jury of 12 people was ineffective because a few jurors ended up dominating the discussion, and that seven was a better number because more people feel comfortable speaking, and they have an easier time reaching a unanimous decision.

== Jury selection ==

Jurors are expected to be neutral, so the court may inquire about the jurors&#x27; neutrality or otherwise exclude jurors who are perceived as likely to be less than neutral or partial to one side. Jury selection in the United States usually includes organized questioning of the prospective jurors (jury pool) by the lawyers for the plaintiff and the defendant and by the judge—voir dire—as well as rejecting some jurors because of bias or inability to properly serve (&quot;challenge for cause&quot;), and the discretionary right of each side to reject a specified number of jurors without having to prove a proper cause for the rejection (&quot;peremptory challenge&quot;), before the jury is .

Since there is always the possibility of jurors not completing a trial for health or other reasons, often one or more alternate jurors may be selected. Alternates are present for the entire trial but do not take part in deliberating the case and deciding the verdict unless one or more of the impaneled jurors are removed from the jury. For example, in the United Kingdom, a small number of alternate jurors may be empanelled until the end of the opening speeches by counsel, in case a juror realises they are familiar with the matters before the court.

Jurors are selected from a jury pool formed for a specified period of time—usually from one day to two weeks—from lists of citizens living in the jurisdiction of the court. The lists may be electoral rolls (i.e., a list of registered voters in the locale), people who have driver&#x27;s licenses or other relevant data bases. When selected, being a member of a jury pool is, in principle, compulsory. Prospective jurors are sent a summons and are obligated to appear in a specified jury pool room on a specified date.

However, jurors can be released from the pool for several reasons including illness, prior commitments that cannot be abandoned without hardship, change of address to outside the court&#x27;s jurisdiction, travel or employment outside the jurisdiction at the time of duty, and others. Often jurisdictions pay token amounts for jury duty and many issue stipends to cover transportation expenses for jurors. Work places cannot penalize employees who serve jury duty. Payments to jurors varies by jurisdiction.

In the United States jurors for grand juries are selected from jury pools.

Selection of jurors from a jury pool occurs when a trial is announced and juror names are randomly selected and called out by the jury pool clerk. Depending on the type of trial—whether a 6-person or 12 person jury is needed, in the United States—anywhere from 15 to 30 prospective jurors are sent to the courtroom to participate in &quot;voir dire&quot;, pronounced in French, the oath to speak the truth in the examination testing competence of a juror, or in another application, a witness. Once the list of prospective jurors has assembled in the courtroom the court clerk assigns them seats in the order their names were originally drawn. At this point the judge often will ask each prospective juror to answer a list of general questions such as name, occupation, education, family relationships, time conflicts for the anticipated length of the trial. The list is usually written up and clearly visible to assist nervous prospective jurors and may include several questions uniquely pertinent to the particular trial. These questions are to familiarize the judge and attorneys with the jurors and glean biases, experiences, or relationships that could jeopardize the proper course of the trial.

After each prospective juror has answered the general slate of questions the attorneys may ask follow-up questions of some or all prospective jurors. Each side in the trial is allotted a certain number of challenges to remove prospective jurors from consideration. Some challenges are issued during voir dire while others are presented to the judge at the end of voir dire. The judge calls out the names of the anonymously challenged prospective jurors and those return to the pool for consideration in other trials. A jury is formed, then, of the remaining prospective jurors in the order that their names were originally chosen. Any prospective jurors not thus impaneled return to the jury pool room.
== Composition ==
A jury is intended to be an impartial panel capable of reaching a verdict and representing a variety of people from that area. Achieving this goal can be difficult when juror qualifications differ significantly from the people living in that area. For example, in 19th-century Ireland, the qualified jurors were much wealthier, much less likely to be Roman Catholic, and much less likely to speak only the Irish language than the typical Irish person. In the past, England had special juries, which empaneled only wealthier property owners as jurors. Attacks on the American jury increased after the pool of jurors expanded to include newly-enfranchised women and minorities. 

A head juror is called the &quot;foreperson&quot;, &quot;foreman&quot;, or &quot;presiding juror&quot;. The foreperson may be chosen before the trial begins, or at the beginning of the jury&#x27;s deliberations. The foreperson may be selected by the judge or by vote of the jurors, depending on the jurisdiction. The foreperson&#x27;s role may include asking questions (usually to the judge) on behalf of the jury, facilitating jury discussions, and announcing the verdict of the jury.

== Integrity ==
For juries to fulfill their role of analyzing the facts of the case, there are strict rules about their use of information during the trial. Juries are often instructed to avoid learning about the case from any source other than the trial (for example from media or the Internet) and not to conduct their own investigations (such as independently visiting a crime scene). Parties to the case, lawyers, and witnesses are not allowed to speak with a member of the jury. Doing these things may constitute reversible error. Rarely, such as in very high-profile cases, the court may order a jury sequestered for the deliberation phase or for the entire trial.

Jurors are generally required to keep their deliberations in strict confidence during the trial and deliberations, and in some jurisdictions even after a verdict is rendered. In Canadian and English law, the jury&#x27;s deliberations must never be disclosed outside the jury, even years after the case; to repeat parts of the trial or verdict is considered to be contempt of court, a criminal offense. In the United States, confidentiality is usually only required until a verdict has been reached, and jurors have sometimes made remarks that called into question whether a verdict was properly reached. In Australia, academics are permitted to scrutinize the jury process only after obtaining a certificate or approval from the Attorney-General.

Because of the importance of preventing undue influence on a jury, embracery, jury intimidation or jury tampering (like witness tampering) is a serious crime, whether attempted through bribery, threat of violence, or other means. At various points in history, when threats to jurors became pervasive, the right to jury trial has been revoked, such as during the 1880s in Ireland.

Jurors themselves can also be held liable if they deliberately compromise their impartiality. Depending on local law, if a juror takes a bribe, the verdict may be overturned and the juror may be fined or imprisoned.

Robert Burns and Alexander Hamilton argued that jurors were the least likely decision-makers to be corrupted when compared to judges and all the political branches.

==Role==
The role of the jury is often described as that of a finder of fact, while the judge is usually seen as having the sole responsibility of interpreting the appropriate law and instructing the jury accordingly. The jury determines the truth or falsity of factual allegations and renders a verdict on whether a criminal defendant is guilty, or a civil defendant is civilly liable. Sometimes a jury makes specific findings of fact in what is called a &quot;special verdict&quot;. A verdict without specific findings of fact that includes only findings of guilt, or civil liability and an overall amount of civil damages, if awarded, is called a &quot;general verdict&quot;.

Juries are often justified because they leaven the law with community norms. A jury trial verdict in a case is binding only in that case, and is not a legally binding precedent in other cases. For example, it would be possible for one jury to find that particular conduct is negligent, and another jury to find that the conduct is not negligent, without either verdict being legally invalid, on precisely the same factual evidence. Of course, no two witnesses are exactly the same, and even the same witness will not express testimony in exactly the same way twice, so this would be difficult to prove. It is the role of the judge, not the jury, to determine what law applies to a particular set of facts. However, occasionally jurors find the law to be invalid or unfair, and on that basis acquit the defendant, regardless of the evidence presented that the defendant violated the law. This is commonly referred to as &quot;jury nullification of law&quot; or simply jury nullification. When there is no jury (&quot;bench trial&quot;), the judge makes rulings on both questions of law and of fact. In most continental European jurisdictions, judges have more power in a trial and the role and powers of a jury are often restricted. Actual jury law and trial procedures differ significantly between countries.

The collective knowledge and deliberate nature of juries are also given as reasons in their favor:

Detailed interviews with jurors after they rendered verdicts in trials involving complex expert testimony have demonstrated careful and critical analysis. The interviewed jurors clearly recognized that the experts were selected within an adversary process. They employed sensible techniques to evaluate the experts’ testimony, such as assessing the completeness and consistency of the testimony, comparing it with other evidence at the trial, and evaluating it against their own knowledge and life experience. Moreover, the research shows that in deliberations jurors combine their individual perspectives on the evidence and debate its relative merits before arriving at a verdict.
In the United States, juries are sometimes called on, when asked to do so by a judge in the jury instructions, to make factual findings on particular issues. This may include, for example, aggravating circumstances which will be used to elevate the defendant&#x27;s sentence if the defendant is convicted. This practice was required in all death penalty cases in &quot;Blakely v. Washington&quot;, , where the Supreme Court ruled that allowing judges to make such findings unilaterally violates the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial. A similar Sixth Amendment argument in &quot;Apprendi v. New Jersey&quot;, resulted in the Supreme Court&#x27;s expansion of the requirement to all criminal cases, holding that &quot;any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt&quot;.

Many U.S. jurisdictions permit the seating of an advisory jury in a civil case in which there is no right to trial by jury to provide non-binding advice to the trial judge, although this procedural tool is rarely used. For example, a judge might seat an advisory jury to guide the judge in awarding non-economic damages (such as &quot;pain and suffering&quot; damages) in a case where there is no right to a jury trial, such as (depending on state law) a case involving &quot;equitable&quot; rather than &quot;legal&quot; claims.

In Canada, juries are also allowed to make suggestions for sentencing periods at the time of sentencing. The suggestions of the jury are presented before the judge by the Crown prosecutor(s) before the sentence is handed down. In a small number of U.S. jurisdictions, including the states of Tennessee and Texas, juries are charged both with the task of finding guilt or innocence as well assessing and fixing sentences.

However, this is not the practice in most other legal systems based on the English tradition, in which judges retain sole responsibility for deciding sentences according to law. The exception is the award of damages in English law libel cases, although a judge is now obliged to make a recommendation to the jury as to the appropriate amount.

In legal systems based on English tradition, findings of fact by a jury, and jury conclusions that could be supported by jury findings of fact even if the specific factual basis for the verdict is not known, are entitled to great deference on appeal. In other legal systems, it is generally possible for an appellate court to reconsider both findings of fact and conclusions of law made in the trial court, and in those systems, evidence may be presented to appellate courts in what amounts to a trial &quot;de novo&quot; (new trial) of appealed findings of fact. The finality of trial court findings of fact in legal systems based on the English tradition has a major impact on court procedure in these systems. This makes it imperative that lawyers be highly prepared for trial because errors and misjudgments related to the presentation of evidence at trial to a jury cannot generally be corrected later on appeal, particularly in court systems based on the English tradition. The higher the stakes, the more this is true. Surprises at trial are much more consequential in court systems based on the English tradition than they are in other legal systems.

Scholarly research on jury behavior in American non-capital criminal felony trials reveals that juror outcomes appear to track the opinions of the median juror, rather than the opinions of the extreme juror on the panel, although juries were required to render unanimous verdicts in the jurisdictions studied. Thus, although juries must render unanimous verdicts, in run-of-the-mill criminal trials they behave in practice as if they were operating using a majority rules voting system.

==Jury nullification==
&quot;Jury nullification&quot; means deciding not to apply the law to the facts in a particular case by jury decision. In other words, it is &quot;the process whereby a jury in a criminal case effectively nullifies a law by acquitting a defendant regardless of the weight of evidence against him or her.&quot;

In the 17th and 18th centuries, there was a series of such cases, starting in 1670 with the trial of the Quaker William Penn which asserted the (de facto) right, or at least power, of a jury to render a verdict contrary to the facts or law. A good example is the case of one Carnegie of Finhaven who in 1728 accidentally killed the Scottish Earl of Strathmore. As the defendant had undoubtedly killed the Earl, the law (as it stood) required the jury to render the verdict that the case had been &quot;proven&quot; and cause Carnegie of Finhaven to die for an accidental killing. Instead, the jury asserted what is believed to be their &quot;ancient right&quot; to judge the whole case and not just the facts and brought in the verdict of &quot;not guilty&quot;.

Today in the United States, juries are instructed by the judge to follow the judge&#x27;s instructions concerning what is the law and to render a verdict solely on the evidence presented in court. Important past exercises of nullification include cases involving slavery (see Fugitive Slave Act of 1850), freedom of the press (see John Peter Zenger), and freedom of religion (see William Penn).

In &quot;United States v. Moylan&quot;, , Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal unanimously ruled: &quot;If the jury feels that the law under which the defendant is accused is unjust, or exigent circumstances justified the actions of the accused, or for any reason which appeals to their logic or passion, the jury has the right to acquit, and the courts must abide that decision.&quot; The Fully Informed Jury Association is a non-profit educational organization dedicated to informing jurors of their rights and seeking the passage of laws to require judges to inform jurors that they can and should judge the law. In &quot;Sparf v. United States&quot;, , the Supreme Court, in a 5–4 decision, held that a trial judge has no responsibility to inform the jury of the right to nullify laws.

Modern American jurisprudence is generally intolerant of the practice, and a juror can be removed from a case if the judge believes that the juror is aware of the power of nullification.

===Jury equity===
In the United Kingdom, a similar power exists, often called jury equity. This enables a jury to reach a decision in direct contradiction with the law if they feel the law is unjust. This can create a persuasive precedent for future cases, or render prosecutors reluctant to bring a charge – thus a jury has the power to influence the law.

The standard justification of jury equity is taken from the final few pages of Lord Devlin&#x27;s book &quot;Trial by Jury&quot;. Devlin explained jury equity through two now-famous metaphors: that the jury is &quot;the lamp that shows that freedom lives&quot; and that it is a &quot;little parliament&quot;. The second metaphor emphasises that, just as members of parliament are generally dominated by government but can occasionally assert their independence, juries are usually dominated by judges but can, in extraordinary circumstances, throw off this control. Devlin thereby sought to emphasise that neither jury equity nor judicial control is set in stone.

Perhaps the best example of modern-day jury equity in England and Wales was the acquittal of Clive Ponting, on a charge of revealing secret information, under section 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911 in 1985. Mr Ponting&#x27;s defence was that the revelation was in the public interest. The trial judge directed the jury that &quot;the public interest is what the government of the day says it is&quot; – effectively a direction to the jury to convict. Nevertheless, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty.

Another example is the acquittal in 1989 of Michael Randle and Pat Pottle, who confessed in open court to charges of springing the Soviet spy George Blake from Wormwood Scrubs Prison and smuggling him to East Germany in 1966. Pottle successfully appealed to the jury to disregard the judge&#x27;s instruction that they consider only whether the defendants were guilty in law, and assert a jury&#x27;s ancient right to throw out a politically motivated prosecution, in this case, compounded by its cynical untimeliness.

In Scotland (with a separate legal system from that of England and Wales) although technically the &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict was originally a form of jury nullification, over time the interpretation has changed so that now the &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict has become the normal one when a jury is not persuaded of guilt and the &quot;not proven&quot; verdict is only used when the jury is not certain of innocence or guilt. It is absolutely central to Scottish and English law that there is a presumption of innocence. It is not a trivial distinction, since any shift in the burden of proof is a significant change which undermines the safeguard for the citizen.

== Jury sentencing ==
Jury sentencing is the practice of having juries decide what penalties to give those who have been convicted of criminal offenses. The practice of jury sentencing began in the US state of Virginia in the 18th century and spread westward to other states that were influenced by Virginia-trained lawyers. 

Canadian juries have long had the option to recommend mercy, leniency, or clemency, and the 1961 &quot;Criminal Code&quot; required judges to give a jury instruction, following a verdict convicting a defendant of capital murder, soliciting a recommendation as to whether he should be granted clemency. When capital punishment in Canada was abolished in 1976, as part of the same raft of reforms, the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; was also amended to grant juries the ability to recommend periods of parole ineligibility immediately following a guilty verdict in second-degree murder cases; however, these recommendations are usually ignored, based on the idea that judges are better-informed about relevant facts and sentencing jurisprudence and, unlike the jury, permitted to give reasons for their judgments.

Proponents of jury sentencing argue that since sentencing involves fact-finding (a task traditionally within the purview of juries), and since the original intent of the founders was to have juries check judges&#x27; power, it is the proper role of juries to participate in sentencing. Opponents argue that judges&#x27; training and experience with the use of presentence reports and sentencing guidelines, as well as the fact that jury control procedures typically deprive juries of the opportunity to hear information about the defendant&#x27;s background during the trial, make it more practical to have judges sentence defendants. In Canada, a faint hope clause formerly allowed a jury to be empanelled to consider whether an offender&#x27;s number of years of imprisonment without eligibility for parole ought to be reduced, but this was repealed in 2011.

Sentencing is said to be more time-consuming for jurors than the relatively easy task of ascertaining guilt or innocence, which means an increase in jury fees and in the amount of productivity lost to jury duty. In New South Wales, a 2007 proposal by Chief Justice Jim Spigelman to involve juries in sentencing was rejected after District Court Chief Judge Reg Blanch cited &quot;an expected wide difference of views between jurors about questions relating to sentence&quot;. Concerns about jury tampering through intimidation by defendants were also raised.

Germany and many other continental European countries have a system in which professional judges and lay judges deliberate together at both the trial and sentencing stages; such systems have been praised as a superior alternative because the mixed court dispenses with most of the time‐consuming practices of jury control that characterize Anglo‐American trial procedure, yet serves the purposes of a jury trial better than plea bargaining and bench trials, which have displaced the jury from routine American practice.

== Experience of jurors ==
The experience of individual jurors is understudied. However, during times of political unrest jurors have been criminally threatened or physically harmed because of their service, and this resulted in people being less willing to serve, or to prefer the risk of judicial fines for not serving to the risk of criminal retribution if they do serve on the jury.

Jurors typically take their roles very seriously. According to Simon (1980), jurors approach their responsibilities as decision makers much in the same way as a court judge: with great seriousness, a lawful mind, and a concern for consistency that is evidence-based. By actively processing evidence, making inferences, using common sense and personal experiences to inform their decision-making, research has indicated that jurors are effective decision makers who seek thorough understanding, rather than passive, apathetic participants unfit to serve on a jury.

== Jury effectiveness ==
Contemporary research has provided partial support for the proficiency of juries as decision makers due to taking their work seriously to get a fair outcome and by relying on the group to overcome individual biases. Some note the imperfections in the process and advocate for amendments to the system, with only 3% of US judges favoring abolishing the jury. The thoroughness of the jury trial has also been praised for providing the public with important information that is often not released in alternative procedures like arbitration or adjudication by judges or administrative agencies.

===Judge-jury agreement===

Evidence supporting jury effectiveness has also been illustrated in studies that investigate the parallels between judge and jury decision-making. According to Kalven and Zeisel (1966), it is not uncommon to find that the verdicts passed down by juries following a trial match the verdicts held by the appointed judges. Upon surveying judges and jurors of approximately 8,000 criminal and civil trials, it was discovered that the verdicts handed down by both parties were in agreement 80% of the time.

Suja A. Thomas argues that, &quot;although results between judges and juries may be similar, judges and juries can disagree. If a choice must be made between a judge or a jury deciding, the diversity, availability of deliberations, the requirement for consensus, the lack of monetary or promotion incentives, and the fresh examination of evidence all make the jury the most attractive, least-biased decision-maker.&quot;

===Buffering effects===

Jurors, like most individuals, are not free from holding social and cognitive biases, which could result in sentencing disparities. People may negatively judge individuals who do not adhere to established social norms (e.g., an individual&#x27;s dress sense) or do not meet societal standards of success. Although these biases tend to influence jurors&#x27; individual decisions during a trial, while working as part of a group (i.e., jury), these biases are typically controlled. Groups tend to exert buffering effects that allow jurors to disregard their initial personal biases when forming a credible group decision. Analysis of over a quarter million felony cases in USA found for grand juries no statistical significance for taste-based or statistical discrimination between black and white defendants. 

Robert Burns cites Plato in arguing that gaining power and ruling wisely are different skillsets, making the case for a jury of those who have not sought power to create better outcomes than trials left up to judges. Burns further argues that interest groups have increasing influence over political branches, including judges, and that the jury was designed to resist the new Gilded Age-level concentration of power. He also cites Blackstone who argued that it was against human nature for the few (judges) to be attentive to the needs of the many. He also argues the legitimacy of the judiciary increases with a more robust jury. The trial also provides the public with insight into the conduct of judges and the parties involved, further encouraging good behavior. Unlike in other major institutions that run on a more bureaucratic utilitarian logic, the jury checks this way of thinking by bringing common-sense and moral perspectives to bear. Burns contrasts the focus on fact for a jury with other political processes like congressional forums, which he argues are undisciplined forums for overbroad abstractions. Lastly, Burns argues the jury is a vote of confidence for democracy as the most democratic institution (at least in America) and one that demonstrates that it is possible to find common ground on difficult questions, especially when decisions must be unanimous.

== Trial procedures by country ==

Overall, jury use has been increasing worldwide.

=== Africa ===

==== Ghana ====
In Ghana, juries have seven members, and their sole duty is to determine whether the person is guilty. They have no role in sentencing.

=== Americas ===

==== Brazil ====
The Constitution of Brazil provides that only willful crimes against life, namely full or attempted murder, abortion, infanticide and suicide instigation, be judged by juries. Seven jurors vote in secret to decide whether the defendant is guilty or not, and decisions are taken by the majority.

Manslaughter and other crimes in which the killing was committed without intent, however, are judged by a professional judge instead.

==== Canada ====
In Canada, juries are used for some criminal trials but not others. For summary conviction offences or offences found under section 553 of the Criminal Code (theft and fraud up to the value of $5,000 and certain nuisance offences), the trial is before a judge alone. For most indictable offences, the accused person can elect to be tried by either a judge alone or a judge and jury. In the most serious offences, found in section 469 of the Criminal Code (such as murder or treason), a judge and a jury are always used, unless both the accused and the prosecutor agree that the trial should not be in front of a jury. The jury&#x27;s verdict on the ultimate disposition of guilt or innocence must be unanimous, but can disagree on the evidentiary route that leads to that disposition.

Juries do not make a recommendation as to the length of sentence, except for parole ineligibility for second-degree murder (but the judge is not bound by the jury&#x27;s recommendation, and the jury is not required to make a recommendation).

Jury selection is in accordance with specific criteria. Prospective jurors may only be asked certain questions, selected for direct pertinence to impartiality or other relevant matters. Any other questions must be approved by the judge.

A jury in a criminal trial initially has 12 members. The trial judge has the discretion to direct that one or two alternate jurors also be appointed. If a juror is discharged during the course of the trial, the trial will continue with an alternate juror, unless the number of jurors goes below 10.

The &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; guarantees that anyone tried for an offense that has a maximum sentence of five or more years has the right to be tried by a jury (except for an offence under military law).

The names of jurors are protected by a publication ban. There is a specific criminal offense for disclosing anything that takes place during jury deliberations.

Juries are infrequently used in civil trials in Canada. There are no civil juries in the courts of the province of Quebec, nor in the Federal Court.

==== United States ====
In criminal law in federal courts and a minority of state court systems of the United States, a grand jury is convened to hear only testimony and evidence to determine whether there is a sufficient basis for deciding to indict the defendant and proceed toward trial. In each court district where a grand jury is required, a group of 16–23 citizens holds an inquiry on criminal complaints brought by the prosecutor to decide whether a trial is warranted (based on the standard that probable cause exists that a crime was committed), in which case an indictment is issued. In jurisdictions where the size of a jury varies, in general the size of juries tends to be larger if the crime alleged is more serious. If a grand jury rejects a proposed indictment the grand jury&#x27;s action is known as a &quot;no bill.&quot; If they accept a proposed indictment, the grand jury&#x27;s action is known as a &quot;true bill.&quot; Grand jury proceedings are &quot;ex parte&quot;: only the prosecutor and witnesses who the prosecutor calls may present evidence to the grand jury and defendants are not allowed to present mitigating evidence or even to know the testimony that was presented to the grand jury, and hearsay evidence is permitted. This is so because a grand jury cannot convict a defendant. It can only decide to indict the defendant and proceed forward toward trial. Grand juries vote to indict in the overwhelming majority of cases, and prosecutors are not prohibited from presenting the same case to a new grand jury if a &quot;no bill&quot; was returned by a previous grand jury. A typical grand jury considers a new criminal case every fifteen minutes. In some jurisdictions, in addition to indicting persons for crimes, a grand jury may also issue reports on matters that they investigate apart from the criminal indictments, particularly when the grand jury investigation involves a public scandal. Historically, grand juries were sometimes used in American law to serve a purpose similar to an investigatory commission.

Both Article III of the U.S. Constitution and the Sixth Amendment require that criminal cases be tried by a jury. Originally this applied only to federal courts. However, the Fourteenth Amendment extended this mandate to the states. Although the Constitution originally did not require a jury for civil cases, this led to an uproar which was followed by adoption of the Seventh Amendment, which requires a civil jury in cases where the value in dispute is greater than twenty dollars. However, the Seventh Amendment right to a civil jury trial does not apply in state courts, where the right to a jury is strictly a matter of state law. However, in practice, all states except Louisiana preserve the right to a jury trial in almost all civil cases where the sole remedy sought is money damages to the same extent as jury trials are permitted by the Seventh Amendment. Under the law of many states, jury trials are not allowed in small claims cases. The civil jury in the United States is a defining element of the process by which personal injury trials are handled.

In practice, even though the defendant in a criminal action is entitled to a trial by jury, most criminal actions in the U.S. are resolved by plea bargain. Only about 2% of civil cases go to trial, with only about half of those trials being conducted before juries.

In 1898 the Supreme Court held that the jury must be composed of at least twelve persons, although this was not necessarily extended to state civil jury trials. In 1970, however, the Supreme Court held that the twelve person requirement was a &quot;historical accident&quot;, and upheld six-person juries if provided for under state law in both criminal and civil state court cases. There is controversy over smaller juries, with proponents arguing that they are more efficient and opponents arguing that they lead to fluctuating verdicts. In a later case, however, the court rejected the use of five-person juries in criminal cases. Juries go through a selection process called &quot;voir dire&quot; in which the lawyers question the jurors and then make &quot;challenges for cause&quot; and &quot;peremptory challenges&quot; to remove jurors. Traditionally the removal of jurors based on a peremptory challenge required no justification or explanation, but the tradition has been changed by the Supreme Court where the reason for the peremptory challenge was the race of the potential juror. Since the 1970s &quot;scientific jury selection&quot; has become popular.

Unanimous jury verdicts have been standard in US American law. This requirement was upheld by the Supreme Court in 1897, but the standard was relaxed in 1972 in two criminal cases. As of 1999 over thirty states had laws allowing less than unanimity in civil cases, but, until 2020, Oregon and Louisiana were the only states which have laws allowing less than unanimous jury verdicts for criminal cases (these laws were overturned in &quot;Ramos v. Louisiana&quot;). When the required number of jurors cannot agree on a verdict (a situation sometimes referred to as a &quot;hung jury&quot;), a mistrial is declared, and the case may be retried with a newly constituted jury. The practice generally was that the jury rules only on questions of fact and guilt; setting the penalty was reserved for the judge. This practice was confirmed by rulings of the U.S. Supreme Court such as in &quot;Ring v. Arizona&quot;, which found Arizona&#x27;s practice of having the judge decide whether aggravating factors exist to make a defendant eligible for the death penalty, to be unconstitutional, and reserving the determination of whether the aggravating factors exist to be decided by the jury. However, in some states (such as Alabama and Florida), the ultimate decision on the punishment is made by the judge, and the jury gives only a non-binding recommendation. The judge can impose the death penalty even if the jury recommends life without parole.

There is no set format for jury deliberations, and the jury takes a period of time to settle into discussing the evidence and deciding on guilt and any other facts the judge instructs them to determine. Deliberation is done by the jury only, with none of the lawyers, the judge, or the defendant present. The first step will typically be to find out the initial feeling or reaction of the jurors to the case, which may be by a show of hands, or via secret ballot. The jury will then attempt to arrive at a consensus verdict. The discussion usually helps to identify jurors&#x27; views to see whether a consensus will emerge as well as areas that bear further discussion. Points often arise that were not specifically discussed during the trial. The result of these discussions is that in most cases the jury comes to a unanimous decision and a verdict is thus achieved. In some states and under circumstances, the decision need not be unanimous.

In a few states and in death penalty cases, depending upon the law, the trial jury, or sometimes a separate jury, may determine whether the death penalty is appropriate in &quot;capital&quot; murder cases. Usually, sentencing is handled by the judge at a separate hearing. The judge may but does not always follow the recommendations of the jury when deciding on a sentence.

==== Australia ====

===== States =====
Each state may determine the extent to which the use of a jury is used. The use of a jury is optional for civil trials in any Australian state. The use of a jury in criminal trials is generally by a unanimous verdict of 12 lay members of the public. Some States provide exceptions such as majority (11-to-1 or 10-to-2) verdicts where a jury cannot otherwise reach a verdict. All states except Victoria allow a person accused of a criminal offence to elect to be tried by a judge-alone rather than the default jury provision.

===== Commonwealth (Federal) =====
The Constitution of Australia provides in section 80 that &#x27;the trial on indictment of any offence against any law of the Commonwealth shall be by jury&#x27;. The Commonwealth can determine which offences are &#x27;on indictment&#x27;. It would be entirely consistent with the Constitution that a homicide offence could be tried not &#x27;on indictment,&#x27; or conversely that a simple assault could be tried &#x27;on indictment.&#x27; This interpretation has been criticized as a &#x27;mockery&#x27; of the section, rendering it useless.

Where a trial &#x27;on indictment&#x27; has been prescribed, it is an essential element that it be found by a unanimous verdict of guilty by 12 lay members of the public. This requirement stems from the (historical) meaning of &#x27;jury&#x27; at the time that the Constitution was written and is (in principle) thus an integral element of trial by jury. Unlike in the Australian states, an accused person cannot elect a Judge-only trial, even where both the accused and the prosecutor seek such a trial.

In November 2023, Indigenous Australian law expert Pattie Lees called for greater inclusion of First Nations people in the jury system to create a more &quot;fair, just&quot; system.&quot;

==== Hong Kong ====
Article 86 of the Hong Kong Basic Law assures the practice of jury trials. Criminal cases in the High Court and some civil cases are tried by a jury in Hong Kong. There is no jury in the District Court. In addition, from time to time, the Coroner&#x27;s Court may summon a jury to decide the cause of death in an inquest. Criminal cases are normally tried by a 7-person jury and sometimes, at the discretion of the court, a 9-person jury. Nevertheless, the Jury Ordinance requires that a jury in any proceedings should be composed of at least 5 jurors.

Although article 86 of the basic law states that ‘the principle of trial by jury previously practiced in Hong Kong shall be maintained’, it does not guarantee that every case is to be tried by a jury. In the case &quot;Chiang Lily v. Secretary for Justice&quot; (2010), the Court of Final Appeal agreed that ‘there is no right to trial by jury in Hong Kong.’

==== India ====
Jury trials were abolished in most Indian courts by the 1973 Code of Criminal Procedure . Nanavati Case was not the last Jury trial in India. West Bengal had Jury trials as late as 1973. Juries were not mentioned in the 1950 Indian Constitution, and it was ignored in many Indian states. The Law Commission recommended their abolition in 1958 in its 14th Report. They were retained in a discreet manner for Parsi divorce courts, wherein a panel of members called &#x27;delegates&#x27; are randomly selected from the community to decide the fact of the case. Parsi divorce law is governed by &#x27;The Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act, 1936&#x27; as amended in 1988, and is a mixture of the Panchayat legal system and jury process.

==== New Zealand ====
Juries are used in all trials involving Category 4 offences such as treason, murder and manslaughter, although in exceptional circumstances a judge-alone trial may be ordered. At the option of the defendant, juries may be used in trials involving Category 3 offences, that is, offences where the maximum penalty available is two years&#x27; imprisonment or greater. In civil cases, juries are only used in cases of defamation, false imprisonment and malicious prosecution. Juries must initially try to reach a unanimous verdict, but if one cannot be reached in a reasonable timeframe, the judge may accept a majority verdict of all-but-one (i.e. 11–1 or 10–1) in criminal cases and three-quarters (i.e. 9–3 or 9–2) in civil cases.

===Europe===

==== Belgium ====
The Belgian Constitution provides that all cases involving the most serious crimes be judged by juries. As a safeguard against libel cases, press crimes can also only be tried by a jury. Racism is excluded from this safeguard.

Twelve jurors decide by a qualified majority of two-thirds whether the defendant is guilty or not. A tied vote result in &#x27;not guilty&#x27;; a &#x27;7 guilty – 5 not guilty&#x27; vote is transferred to the 3 professional judges who can, by unanimity, reverse the majority to &#x27;not guilty&#x27;. The sentence is delivered by a majority of the 12 jurors and the 3 professional judges. As a result of the &quot;Taxquet&quot; ruling the juries give nowadays the most important motives that lead them to their verdict. The procedural codification has been altered to meet the demands formulated by the European Court of Human Rights.

==== France ====

===== In the Cour d&#x27;assises =====
Three professional judges sit alongside six jurors in first instance proceedings or nine in appeal proceedings. Before 2012, there were nine or twelve jurors, but this was reduced to cut spending. A two-thirds majority is needed in order to convict the defendant. During these procedures, judges and jurors have equal positions on questions of fact, while judges decide on questions of procedure. Judges and jurors also have equal positions on sentencing.

==== Germany ====
Trial by jury was introduced in most German states after the revolutionary events of 1848. However, it remained controversial; and, early in the 20th century, there were moves to abolish it. The Emminger Reform of January 4, 1924, during an Article 48 state of emergency, abolished the jury system and replaced it with a mixed system including bench trials and lay judges.

In 1925, the Social Democrats called for the reinstitution of the jury; a special meeting of the German Bar demanded revocation of the decrees, but &quot;on the whole the abolition of the jury caused little commotion&quot;. Their verdicts were widely perceived as unjust and inconsistent.

Today, most misdemeanors are tried by a &quot;Strafrichter&quot;, meaning a single judge at an &quot;Amtsgericht&quot;; felonies and more severe misdemeanors are tried by a &quot;Schöffengericht&quot;, also located at the &quot;Amtsgericht&quot;, composed of 1 judge and 2 lay judges; some felonies are heard by &quot;Erweitertes Schöffengericht&quot;, or extended &quot;Schöffengericht&quot;, composed of 2 judges and 2 lay judges; severe felonies and other &quot;special&quot; crimes are tried by the &quot;große Strafkammer&quot;, composed of 3 judges and 2 lay judges at the &quot;Landgericht&quot;, with specially assigned courts for some crimes called &quot;Sonderstrafkammer&quot;; felonies resulting in the death of a human being are tried by the &quot;Schwurgericht&quot;, composed of 3 judges and 2 lay judges, located at the &quot;Landgericht&quot;; and serious crimes against the state are tried by the &quot;Strafsenat&quot;, composed of 5 judges, at an &quot;Oberlandesgericht&quot;.

In some civil cases, such as commercial law or patent law, there are also lay judges, who have to meet certain criteria (e.g., being a merchant).

==== Ireland ====
The law in Ireland is historically based on English common law and had a similar jury system. Article 38 of the 1937 Constitution of Ireland mandates trial by jury for criminal offences, with exceptions for minor offences, military tribunals, and where &quot;the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice, and the preservation of public peace and order&quot;. In &quot;DPP v Nally&quot; [2006] IECCA 128 Kearns J set out that a jury has the right to reach a not guilty verdict even in direct contradiction of the evidence.

The principal statute regulating the selection, obligations and conduct of juries is the Juries Act 1976 as amended by the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2008. There is a fine of €500 for failing to report for jury service, though this was poorly enforced until a change of policy at the Courts Service in 2016. Criminal jury trials are held in the Circuit Court or the Central Criminal Court. Juryless trials under the inadequacy exception, dealing with terrorism or organised crime, are held in the Special Criminal Court, on application by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). Juries are also used in some civil law trials, such as for defamation; they are sometimes used at coroner&#x27;s inquests.

Normally consisting of twelve persons, juries are selected from a jury panel which is picked at random by the county registrar from the electoral register. Juries only decide questions of fact and have no role in criminal sentencing. It is not necessary that a jury be unanimous in its verdict. In civil cases, a verdict may be reached by a majority of nine of the twelve members. In a criminal case, a verdict need not be unanimous where there are not fewer than eleven jurors if ten of them agree on a verdict after considering the case for a &quot;reasonable time&quot;. Juries are not paid, nor do they receive travel expenses; however they do receive lunch for the days that they are serving. The Law Reform Commission examined jury service, producing a consultation paper in 2010 and then a report in 2013. One of its recommendations, to permit extra jurors for long trials in case some are excused, was enacted in 2013. In November 2013, the DPP requested a 15-member jury at the trial of three Anglo Irish Bank executives. Where more than twelve jurors are present, twelve will be chosen by lot to retire and consider the verdict.

==== Italy ====
In Italy, a civil law jurisdiction, untrained judges are present only in the Corte d&#x27;Assise, where two career magistrates are supported by six so-called &quot;lay judges&quot;, who are chosen by lot from the registrar of voters. Any Italian citizen, with no distinction of sex or religion, between 30 and 65 years of age, can be appointed as a lay judge; in order to be eligible as a lay judge for the &quot;Corte d&#x27;Assise&quot;, however, there is a minimum educational requirement, as the lay judge must have completed his/her education at the &quot;Scuola Media&quot; (junior high school) level, while said level is raised for the &quot;Corte d&#x27;Assise d&#x27;Appello&quot; (appeal level of the Corte d&#x27;Assise) to the &quot;Scuola Superiore&quot; (senior high school) degree. In the Corte d&#x27;Assise, decisions concerning both fact and law matters are taken by the stipendiary judges and &quot;lay judges&quot; together at a special meeting behind closed doors, named &quot;Camera di Consiglio&quot; (&quot;Counsel Chamber&quot;), and the Court is subsequently required to publish written explanations of its decisions within 90 days from the verdict. Errors of law or inconsistencies in the explanation of a decision can and usually will lead to the annulment of the decision. A Court d&#x27;Assise and a Court d&#x27;Assise d&#x27;Appello decides on a majority of votes, and therefore predominantly on the votes of the lay judges, who are a majority of six to two, but in fact lay judges, who are not trained to write such explanation and must rely on one or the other stipendiary judge to do it, are effectively prevented from overruling both of them. The &quot;Corte d&#x27;Assise&quot; has jurisdiction to try crimes carrying a maximum penalty of 24 years in prison or life imprisonment, and other serious crimes; felonies that fall under its jurisdiction include terrorism, murder, manslaughter, severe attempts against State personalities, as well as some matters of law requiring ethical and professional evaluations (e.g. assisted suicide), while it generally has no jurisdiction over cases whose evaluation requires knowledge of law which the &quot;lay judges&quot; generally do not have. Penalties imposed by the court can include life sentences.

==== Norway ====
Juries existed in Norway as early as the year 800, and perhaps even earlier. They brought the jury system to England and Scotland. Juries were phased out as late as the 17th century, when Norway&#x27;s central government was in Copenhagen, Denmark. Though Norway and Denmark had different legal systems throughout their personal union (1387–1536), and later under the governmental union (1536–1814), there was attempt to harmonize the legal systems of the two countries. Even if juries were abolished, the layman continued to play an important role in the legal system throughout in Norway.

The jury was reintroduced in 1887, and was then solely used in criminal cases on the second tier of the three-tier Norwegian court system (&quot;Lagmannsretten&quot;). The jury consisted of 10 people, and had to reach a majority verdict consisting of seven or more of the jurors. The jury never gave a reason for its verdict, rather it simply gave a &quot;guilty&quot; or &quot;non-guilty&quot; verdict. The jury foreperson, elected by the jury on the first day, with three other jury members also made up the majority in the sentencing, if the accused were found guilty.

In Norway the term &quot;guilty&quot;, is not used, only yes or no to the actions asked them to consider done by the accused by the prosecutor. The last jury case was in 2018, after juries were abolished after the European Court condideres that no-one should be sentenced without the considerations in the judgement.

In a sense, the concept of being judged by one&#x27;s peers existed on both the first and second tier of the Norwegian court system: In Tingretten, one judge and two lay judges preside, and in Lagmannsretten two judges and five lay judges preside. The lay judges do not hold any legal qualification, and represent the peers of the person on trial, as members of the general public. As a guarantee against any abuse of power by the educated elite, the number of lay judges always exceeds the number of appointed judges. In the Supreme Court, only trained lawyers are seated.

==== Russia ====
The right to a jury trial is provided by Constitution of Russian Federation but for criminal cases only and in the procedure defined by law. Initially, the Criminal Procedure Code, which was adopted in 2001, provided that the right to a jury trial could be realized in criminal cases which should be heard by regional courts and military courts of military districts/fleets as the courts of first instance; the jury was composed of 12 jurors. In 2008, the anti-state criminal cases (treason, espionage, armed rebellion, sabotage, mass riot, creating an illegal paramilitary group, forcible seizure of power, terrorism) were removed from the jurisdiction of the jury trial. From 1 June 2018, defendants can claim a jury trial in criminal cases which are heard by district courts and garrison military courts as the courts of first instance; from that moment on, the jury is composed of 8 (in regional courts and military courts of military districts/fleets) or 6 (in district courts and garrison military courts) jurors.

A juror must be 25 years old, legally competent, and without a criminal record.

==== Spain ====
Spain has no strong tradition of using juries. However, there is some mentions in the Bayonne Statute of 1808. Later, Article 307 of the Spanish Constitution of 1812 allowed the &quot;Cortes&quot; to pass legislation if they felt that over the time it was needed to distinguish between &quot;judges of law&quot; and &quot;judges of facts&quot;. Such legislation however was never enacted.

Article 2 of the Spanish Constitution of 1837 while proclamating the freedom of the people to publicate written contents without previous censorship according to the laws also provided that &quot;press crimes&quot; could only be tried by juries. This meant that a &quot;grand jury&quot; would need to indict, and a &quot;petit jury&quot; would need to convict.

Juries were later abolished in 1845, but were later restored in 1869 for all &quot;political crimes&quot; and &quot;those common crimes the law may deem appropriate to be so tried by a jury&quot;. A Law concerning the Jury entered into force on January 1, 1899, and lasted until 1936, where juries were again disbanded with the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War.

The actual Constitution of 1978 permits the &quot;Cortes Generales&quot; to pass legislation allowing juries in criminal trials. The provision is arguably somewhat vague: &quot;Article 125 – Citizens may engage in popular action and participate in the administration of justice through the institution of the Jury, in the manner and with respect to those criminal trials as may be determined by law, as well as in customary and traditional courts.&quot;

Jury trials can only happen in the criminal jurisdiction and it is not a choice of the defendant to be tried by jury, or by a single judge or a panel of judges. Organic Law 5/1995, of May 22 regulates the categories of crimes in which a trial by jury is mandatory. For all other crimes, a single judge or a panel of judges will decide both on facts and the law. Spanish juries are composed of 9 citizens and a professional Judge. Juries decide on facts and whether to convict or acquit the defendant. In case of conviction they can also make recommendations such as if the defendant should be pardoned if they asked to, or if they think the defendant could be released on parole, etc.

One of the first jury trial cases was that of Mikel Otegi who was tried in 1997 for the murder of two police officers. After a confused trial, five jury members of a total of nine voted to acquit and the judge ordered the accused set free. This verdict shocked the nation. An alleged miscarriage of justice by jury trial was the Wanninkhof murder case.

==== Sweden ====

In press libel cases and other cases concerning offenses against freedom of the press, the question of whether or not the printed material falls outside permissible limits is submitted to a jury of 9 members which provides a pre-screening before the case is ruled on by normal courts. In these cases 6 out of 9 jurors must find against the defendant, and may not be overruled in cases of acquittal.

Sweden has no tradition of using juries in most types of criminal or civil trial. The sole exception, since 1815, is in cases involving freedom of the press, prosecuted under Chapter 7 of the Freedom of the Press Act, part of Sweden&#x27;s constitution. The most frequently prosecuted offence under this act is defamation, although in total eighteen offences, including high treason and espionage, are covered. These cases are tried in district courts (first tier courts) by a jury of nine laymen.

The jury in press freedom cases rules only on the facts of the case and the question of guilt or innocence. The trial judge may overrule a jury&#x27;s guilty verdict, but may not overrule an acquittal. A conviction requires a majority verdict of 6–3. Sentencing is the sole prerogative of judges.

Jury members must be Swedish citizens and resident in the county in which the case is being heard. They must be of sound judgement and known for their independence and integrity. Combined, they should represent a range of social groups and opinions, as well as all parts of the county. It is the county council that have the responsibility to appoints juries for a tenure of four years under which they may serve in multiple cases. The appointed jurymen are divided into two groups, in most counties the first with sixteen members and the second with eight. From this pool of available jurymen the court hears and excludes those with conflicts of interest in the case, after which the defendants and plaintiffs have the right to exclude a number of members, varying by county and group. The final jury is then randomly selected by drawing of lots.

Juries are not used in other criminal and civil cases. For most other cases in the first and second tier courts lay judges sit alongside professional judges. Lay judges participate in deciding both the facts of the case and sentencing. Lay judges are appointed by local authorities, or in practice by the political parties represented on the authorities. Lay judges are therefore usually selected from among nominees of ruling political parties.

==== United Kingdom ====
===== England and Wales =====
In England and Wales jury trials are used for criminal cases, requiring 12 jurors (between the ages of 18 and 75), although the trial may continue with as few as 9. The right to a jury trial has been enshrined in English law since Magna Carta in 1215, and is most common in serious cases, although the defendant can insist on a jury trial for most criminal cases. Jury trials in complex fraud cases have been described by some members and appointees of the Labour Party as expensive and time-consuming. In contrast, the Bar Council, Liberty and other political parties have supported the idea that trial by jury is at the heart of the judicial system and placed the blame for a few complicated jury trials failing on inadequate preparation by the prosecution.

On 18 June 2009 the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Judge, sitting in the Court of Appeal, made English legal history by ruling that a criminal trial in the Crown Court could take place without a jury, under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2003.

Jury trials are also available for some few areas of civil law (for example defamation cases and those involving police conduct); these also require 12 jurors (9 in the County Court). However less than 1% of civil trials involve juries. At the new Manchester Civil Justice Centre, constructed in 2008, fewer than 10 of the 48 courtrooms had jury facilities.

===== Northern Ireland =====
During the Troubles in Northern Ireland, jury trials were suspended and trials took place before Diplock Courts. These were essentially bench trials before judges only. This was to combat jury nullification and the intimidation of juries.

===== Scotland =====
In Scottish criminal trials, juries are composed of fifteen residents, while in civil trials there is a jury of 12 people.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;jury&quot; derives from Latin &quot;iurare&quot; (&quot;to swear&quot;). Juries are most common in common law adversarial-system jurisdictions. In the modern system, juries act as triers of fact, while judges act as triers of law (but see nullification). A trial without a jury (in which both questions of fact and questions of law are decided by a judge) is known as a bench trial.

<text>In North American archaeology, intaglio () is a term from art applied to burial mounds that refers to a design cut into a hard surface. In this case, the burial mounds have designs cut into the ground, though &quot;intaglio&quot; broadly applies to burial mounds which are raised above the natural surface of the terrain. There are much more rare forms where they are left as indents below the natural terrain. These are typically in some effigy shape such as the Panther Intaglio Effigy Mound, which can be seen in Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin, where it is the last remaining intaglio mound in the state.

<text>Printing is a process for mass reproducing text and images using a master form or template. The earliest non-paper products involving printing include cylinder seals and objects such as the Cyrus Cylinder and the Cylinders of Nabonidus. The earliest known form of printing evolved from ink rubbings made on paper or cloth from texts on stone tablets, used during the sixth century. Printing by pressing an inked image onto paper (using woodblock printing) appeared later that century. Later developments in printing technology include the movable type invented by Bi Sheng around 1040 and the printing press invented by Johannes Gutenberg in the 15th century. The technology of printing played a key role in the development of the Renaissance and the Scientific Revolution and laid the material basis for the modern knowledge-based economy and the spread of learning to the masses.

==History==
===Woodblock printing===

Woodblock printing is a technique for printing text, images or patterns that was used widely throughout East Asia. It originated in China in antiquity as a method of printing on textiles and later on paper. 

====In East Asia====

The earliest examples of ink-squeeze rubbings and potential stone printing blocks appear in the mid-sixth century in China. A type of printing called mechanical woodblock printing on paper started during the 7th century in the Tang dynasty, and subsequently spread throughout East Asia. Nara Japan printed the Hyakumantō Darani en masse around 770, and distributed them to temples throughout Japan. In Korea, an example of woodblock printing from the eighth century was discovered in 1966. A copy of the Buddhist Dharani Sutra called the Pure Light Dharani Sutra (), discovered in Gyeongju, in a Silla dynasty pagoda that was repaired in 751, was undated but must have been created sometime before the reconstruction of the Shakyamuni Pagoda of Bulguk Temple, Kyongju Province in 751. The document is estimated to have been created no later than 704.

By the ninth century, printing on paper had taken off, and the first completely surviving printed book is the Diamond Sutra (British Library) of 868, uncovered from Dunhuang. By the tenth century, 400,000 copies of some sutras and pictures were printed, and the Confucian classics were in print. A skilled printer could print up to 2,000 double-page sheets per day.

Printing spread early to Korea and Japan, which also used Chinese logograms, but the technique was also used in Turpan and Vietnam using a number of other scripts. This technique then spread to Persia and Russia. This technique was transmitted to Europe by around 1400 and was used on paper for old master prints and playing cards.

====In the Middle East====
Block printing, called &quot;tarsh&quot; in Arabic, developed in Arabic Egypt during the ninth and tenth centuries, mostly for prayers and amulets. There is some evidence to suggest that these print blocks were made from non-wood materials, possibly tin, lead, or clay. The techniques employed are uncertain. Block printing later went out of use during the Timurid Renaissance. The printing technique in Egypt was embraced by reproducing texts on paper strips and supplying them in different copies to meet the demand.

====In Europe====

Block printing first came to Europe as a method for printing on cloth, where it was common by 1300. Images printed on cloth for religious purposes could be quite large and elaborate. When paper became relatively easily available, around 1400, the technique transferred very quickly to small woodcut religious images and playing cards printed on paper. These prints were produced in very large numbers from about 1425 onward.

Around the mid-fifteenth-century, &quot;block-books&quot;, woodcut books with both text and images, usually carved in the same block, emerged as a cheaper alternative to manuscripts and books printed with movable type. These were all short, heavily illustrated works, the bestsellers of the day, repeated in many different block-book versions: the and the Biblia pauperum were the most common. There is still some controversy among scholars as to whether their introduction preceded or, in the majority view, followed the introduction of movable type, with the estimated range of dates being between about 1440 and 1460.

===Movable-type printing===


Movable type is the system of printing and typography using movable pieces of metal type, made by casting from matrices struck by letterpunches. Movable type allowed for much more flexible processes than hand copying or block printing.

Around 1040, the first known movable type system was created in China by Bi Sheng out of porcelain. Bi Sheng used clay type, which broke easily, but Wang Zhen by 1298 had carved a more durable type from wood. He also developed a complex system of revolving tables and number-association with written Chinese characters that made typesetting and printing more efficient. Still, the main method in use there remained woodblock printing (xylography), which &quot;proved to be cheaper and more efficient for printing Chinese, with its thousands of characters&quot;.

Copper movable type printing originated in China at the beginning of the 12th century. It was used in large-scale printing of paper money
issued by the Northern Song dynasty. Movable type spread to Korea during the Goryeo dynasty.

Around 1230, Koreans invented a metal type movable printing using bronze. The &quot;Jikji&quot;, published in 1377, is the earliest known metal printed book. Type-casting was used, adapted from the method of casting coins. The character was cut in beech wood, which was then pressed into a soft clay to form a mould, and bronze poured into the mould, and finally the type was polished. Eastern metal movable type was spread to Europe between the late 14th and early 15th centuries. The Korean form of metal movable type was described by the French scholar Henri-Jean Martin as &quot;extremely similar to Gutenberg&#x27;s&quot;. Authoritative historians Frances Gies and Joseph Gies claimed that &quot;The Asian priority of invention movable type is now firmly established, and that Chinese-Korean technique, or a report of it traveled westward is almost certain.&quot; 

===The printing press===
Around 1450, Johannes Gutenberg introduced the first movable type printing system in Europe. He advanced innovations in casting type based on a matrix and hand mould, adaptations to the screw-press, the use of an oil-based ink, and the creation of a softer and more absorbent paper. Gutenberg was the first to create his type pieces from an alloy of lead, tin, antimony, copper and bismuth – the same components still used today. Johannes Gutenberg started work on his printing press around 1436, in partnership with Andreas Dritzehen – whom he had previously instructed in gem-cutting – and Andreas Heilmann, the owner of a paper mill.

Compared to woodblock printing, movable type page setting and printing using a press was faster and more durable. Also, the metal type pieces were sturdier and the lettering more uniform, leading to typography and fonts. The high quality and relatively low price of the Gutenberg Bible (1455) established the superiority of movable type for Western languages. The printing press rapidly spread across Europe, leading up to the Renaissance, and later all around the world.

Time Life magazine called Gutenberg&#x27;s innovations in movable type printing the most important invention of the second millennium.

===Rotary printing press===

The steam-powered rotary printing press, invented in 1843 in the United States by Richard M. Hoe, ultimately allowed millions of copies of a page in a single day. Mass production of printed works flourished after the transition to rolled paper, as continuous feed allowed the presses to run at a much faster pace. Hoe&#x27;s original design operated at up to 2,000 revolutions per hour where each revolution deposited 4 page images, giving the press a throughput of 8,000 pages per hour. By 1891, The New York World and Philadelphia Item were operating presses producing either 90,000 4-page sheets per hour or 48,000 8-page sheets.

The rotary printing press uses impressions curved around a cylinder to print on long continuous rolls of paper or other substrates. Rotary drum printing was later significantly improved by William Bullock. There are multiple types of rotary printing press technologies that are still used today: sheetfed offset, rotogravure, and flexographic printing.

=== Printing capacity ===
The table lists the maximum number of pages which various press designs could print &quot;per hour&quot;.

==Conventional printing technology==
All printing process are concerned with two kinds of areas on the final output:
# Image area (printing areas)
# Non-image area (non-printing areas)

After the information has been prepared for production (the prepress step), each printing process has definitive means of separating the image from the non-image areas.

Conventional printing has four types of process:
# Planographics, in which the printing and non-printing areas are on the same plane surface and the difference between them is maintained chemically or by physical properties, the examples are: offset lithography, collotype, and screenless printing.
# Relief, in which the printing areas are on a plane surface and the non printing areas are below the surface, examples: flexography and letterpress.
# Intaglio, in which the non-printing areas are on a plane surface and the printing area are etched or engraved below the surface, examples: steel die engraving, gravure, etching, collagraph.
# Porous or Stencil, in which the printing areas are on fine mesh screens through which ink can penetrate, and the non-printing areas are a stencil over the screen to block the flow of ink in those areas, examples: screen printing, stencil duplicator, risograph.

===Crop marks===
To print an image without a blank area around the image, the non-printing areas must be trimmed after printing. Crop marks can be used to show the printer where the printing area ends, and the non-printing area begins. The part of the image which is trimmed off is called bleed.

===Letterpress===
Letterpress printing is a technique of relief printing. A worker composes and locks movable type into the bed of a press, inks it, and presses paper against it to transfer the ink from the type which creates an impression on the paper. 
There is different paper for different works the quality of paper shows different ink to use.

Letterpress printing was the normal form of printing text from its invention by Johannes Gutenberg in the mid-15th century and remained in wide use for books and other uses until the second half of the 20th century, when offset printing was developed. More recently, letterpress printing has seen a revival in an artisanal form.

===Offset===
Offset printing is a widely used modern printing process. This technology is best described as when a positive (right-reading) image on a printing plate is inked and transferred (or &quot;offset&quot;) from the plate to a rubber blanket. The blanket image becomes a mirror image of the plate image. An offset transfer moves the image to a printing substrate (typically paper), making the image right-reading again. Offset printing uses a lithographic process which is based on the repulsion of oil and water. The offset process employs a flat (planographic) image carrier (plate) which is mounted on a press cylinder. The image to be printed obtains ink from ink rollers, while the non-printing area attracts an (acidic) film of water, keeping the non-image areas ink-free. Most offset presses use three cylinders: Plate, blanket, impression. Currently, most books and newspapers are printed using offset lithography.

===Gravure===

Gravure printing is an intaglio printing technique, where the image being printed is made up of small depressions in the surface of the printing plate. The cells are filled with ink, and the excess is scraped off the surface with a doctor blade. Then a rubber-covered roller presses paper onto the surface of the plate and into contact with the ink in the cells. The printing cylinders are usually made from copper plated steel, which is subsequently chromed, and may be produced by diamond engraving; etching, or laser ablation.

Gravure printing is known for its ability to produce high-quality, high-resolution images with accurate color reproduction and using viscosity control equipment during production.
Ink evaporation control affects the change in the color of the printed image.

Gravure printing is used for long, high-quality print runs such as magazines, mail-order catalogues, packaging and printing onto fabric and wallpaper. It is also used for printing postage stamps and decorative plastic laminates, such as kitchen worktops.

===Flexography===
Flexography is a type of relief printing. The relief plates are typically made from photopolymers.
The process is used for flexible packaging, corrugated board, labels, newspapers and more. In this market it competes with gravure printing by holding 80% of the market in US, 50% in Europe but only 20% in Asia.

===Other printing techniques===
The other significant printing techniques include:
* Dye-sublimation printer
* Inkjet, used typically to print a small number of books or packaging, and also to print a variety of materials: from high quality papers simulating offset printing, to floor tiles. Inkjet is also used to apply mailing addresses to direct mail pieces
* Laser printing (toner printing) mainly used in offices and for transactional printing (bills, bank documents). Laser printing is commonly used by direct mail companies to create variable data letters or coupons.
* Pad printing, popular for its ability to print on complex three-dimensional surfaces
* Relief print, mainly used for catalogues
* Screen printing for a variety of applications ranging from T-shirts to floor tiles, and on uneven surfaces
* Intaglio, used mainly for high value documents such as currencies.
* Thermal printing, popular in the 1990s for fax printing. Used today for printing labels such as airline baggage tags and individual price labels in supermarket deli counters.

==Impact of German movable type printing press==

===Quantitative aspects===

It is estimated that following the innovation of Gutenberg&#x27;s printing press, the European book output rose from a few million to around one billion copies within a span of less than four centuries.

===Religious impact===
Samuel Hartlib, who was exiled in Britain and enthusiastic about social and cultural reforms, wrote in 1641 that &quot;the art of printing will so spread knowledge that the common people, knowing their own rights and liberties, will not be governed by way of oppression&quot;.

In the Muslim world, printing, especially in Arabic scripts, was strongly opposed throughout the early modern period, partially due to the high artistic renown of the art of traditional calligraphy. However, printing in Hebrew or Armenian script was often permitted. Thus, the first movable type printing in the Ottoman Empire was in Hebrew in 1493, after which both religious and non-religious texts were able to be printed in Hebrew. According to an imperial ambassador to Istanbul in the middle of the sixteenth century, it was a sin for the Turks, particularly Turkish Muslims, to print religious books. In 1515, Sultan Selim I issued a decree under which the practice of printing would be punishable by death. At the end of the sixteenth century, Sultan Murad III permitted the sale of non-religious printed books in Arabic characters, yet the majority were imported from Italy. Ibrahim Muteferrika established the first press for printing in Arabic in the Ottoman Empire, against opposition from the calligraphers and parts of the Ulama. It operated until 1742, producing altogether seventeen works, all of which were concerned with non-religious, utilitarian matters. Printing did not become common in the Islamic world until the 19th century.

Hebrew language printers were banned from printing guilds in some Germanic states; as a result, Hebrew printing flourished in Italy, beginning in 1470 in Rome, then spreading to other cities including Bari, Pisa, Livorno, and Mantua. Local rulers had the authority to grant or revoke licenses to publish Hebrew books, and many of those printed during this period carry the words &#x27;con licenza de superiori&#x27; (indicating their printing having been officially licensed) on their title pages.

It was thought that the introduction of printing &#x27;would strengthen religion and enhance the power of monarchs.&#x27; The majority of books were of a religious nature, with the church and crown regulating the content. The consequences of printing &#x27;wrong&#x27; material were extreme. Meyrowitz used the example of William Carter who in 1584 printed a pro-Catholic pamphlet in Protestant-dominated England. The consequence of his action was hanging.

===Social impact===
Print gave a broader range of readers access to knowledge and enabled later generations to build directly on the intellectual achievements of earlier ones without the changes arising within verbal traditions. Print, according to Acton in his 1895 lecture &quot;On the Study of History&quot;, gave &quot;assurance that the work of the Renaissance would last, that what was written would be accessible to all, that such an occultation of knowledge and ideas as had depressed the Middle Ages would never recur, that not an idea would be lost&quot;.

Print was instrumental in changing the social nature of reading.

Elizabeth Eisenstein identifies two long-term effects of the invention of printing. She claims that print created a sustained and uniform reference for knowledge and allowed comparisons of incompatible views.

Asa Briggs and Peter Burke identify five kinds of reading that developed in relation to the introduction of print:
# Critical reading: Because texts finally became accessible to the general population, critical reading emerged as people were able to form their own opinions on texts.
# Dangerous reading: Reading was seen as a dangerous pursuit because it was considered rebellious and unsociable, especially in the case of women, because reading could stir up dangerous emotions such as love, and if women could read, they could read love notes.
# Creative reading: Printing allowed people to read texts and interpret them creatively, often in very different ways than the author intended.
# Extensive reading: Once print made a wide range of texts available, earlier habits of intensive reading of texts from start to finish began to change, and people began reading selected excerpts, allowing much more extensive reading on a wider range of topics.
# Private reading: Reading was linked to the rise of individualism because, before print, reading was often a group event in which one person would read to a group. With print, both literacy and the availability of texts increased, and solitary reading became the norm.

The invention of printing also changed the occupational structure of European cities. Printers emerged as a new group of artisans for whom literacy was essential, while the much more labour-intensive occupation of the scribe naturally declined. Proof-correcting arose as a new occupation, while a rise in the numbers of booksellers and librarians naturally followed the explosion in the numbers of books.

=== Educational impact ===
Gutenberg&#x27;s printing press had profound impacts on universities as well. Universities were influenced in their &quot;language of scholarship, libraries, curriculum, [and] pedagogy&quot;

==== The language of scholarship ====
Before the invention of the printing press, most written material was in Latin. However, after the invention of printing the number of books printed expanded as well as the vernacular. Latin was not replaced completely, but remained an international language until the eighteenth century.

==== University libraries ====
At this time, universities began establishing accompanying libraries. &quot;Cambridge made the chaplain responsible for the library in the fifteenth century but this position was abolished in 1570 and in 1577 Cambridge established the new office of university librarian. Although, the University of Leuven did not see a need for a university library based on the idea that professor were the library. Libraries also began receiving so many books from gifts and purchases that they began to run out of room. However, the issue was solved in 1589 by a man named Merton who decided books should be stored on horizontal shelves rather than lecterns.

==== Curriculum ====
The printed press changed university libraries in many ways. Professors were finally able to compare the opinions of different authors rather than being forced to look at only one or two specific authors. Textbooks themselves were also being printed in different levels of difficulty, rather than just one introductory text being made available.

By 2005, digital printing accounted for approximately 9% of the 45 trillion pages printed annually around the world.

Printing at home, an office, or an engineering environment is subdivided into:
* small format (up to ledger size paper sheets), as used in business offices and libraries
* wide format (up to 3&#x27; or 914mm wide rolls of paper), as used in drafting and design establishments.

Some of the more common printing technologies are:
* blueprint – and related chemical technologies
* daisy wheel – where pre-formed characters are applied individually
* dot-matrix – which produces arbitrary patterns of dots with an array of printing studs
* line printing – where formed characters are applied to the paper by lines
* heat transfer – such as early fax machines or modern receipt printers that apply heat to special paper, which turns black to form the printed image
* inkjet – including bubble-jet, where ink is sprayed onto the paper to create the desired image
* electrophotography – where toner is attracted to a charged image and then developed
* laser – a type of xerography where the charged image is written pixel by pixel using a laser
* solid ink printer – where solid sticks of ink are melted to make liquid ink or toner

Vendors typically stress the total cost to operate the equipment, involving complex calculations that include all cost factors involved in the operation as well as the capital equipment costs, amortization, etc. For the most part, toner systems are more economical than inkjet in the long run, even though inkjets are less expensive in the initial purchase price.

Professional digital printing (using toner) primarily uses an electrical charge to transfer toner or liquid ink to the substrate onto which it is printed. Digital print quality has steadily improved from early color and black and white copiers to sophisticated colour digital presses such as the Xerox iGen3, the Kodak Nexpress, the HP Indigo Digital Press series, and the InfoPrint 5000. The iGen3 and Nexpress use toner particles and the Indigo uses liquid ink. The InfoPrint 5000 is a full-color, continuous forms inkjet drop-on-demand printing system. All handle variable data, and rival offset in quality. Digital offset presses are also called direct imaging presses, although these presses can receive computer files and automatically turn them into print-ready plates, they cannot insert variable data.

Small press and fanzines generally use digital printing. Prior to the introduction of cheap photocopying, the use of machines such as the spirit duplicator, hectograph, and mimeograph was common.
==3D printing==

3D printing is a form of manufacturing technology where physical objects are created from three-dimensional digital models using 3D printers. The objects are created by laying down or building up many thin layers of material in succession. The technique is also known as additive manufacturing, rapid prototyping, or fabricating.

In the 1980s, 3D printing techniques were considered suitable only for the production of functional or aesthetic prototypes, and a more appropriate term for it at the time was rapid prototyping. , the precision, repeatability, and material range of 3D printing have increased to the point that some 3D printing processes are considered viable as an industrial-production technology, whereby the term &quot;additive manufacturing&quot; can be used synonymously with &quot;3D printing&quot;. One of the key advantages of 3D printing is the ability to produce very complex shapes or geometries that would be otherwise infeasible to construct by hand, including hollow parts or parts with internal truss structures to reduce weight. Fused deposition modeling (FDM), which uses a continuous filament of a thermoplastic material, is the most common 3D printing process in use .

<text>Cavalcade is a play by Noël Coward with songs by Coward and others. It focuses on three decades in the life of the Marryots, an upper-middle-class British family, and their servants, beginning in 1900 and ending in 1930, a year before the premiere. It is set against major historical events of the period, including the Relief of Mafeking; the death of Queen Victoria; the sinking of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;; and World War I. The popular songs at the time of each event were interwoven into the score.

The play was premiered in London in 1931 at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, directed by the author. The spectacular production presented by the impresario Charles B. Cochran, involved a huge cast and massive sets. The play was very successful and ran for almost a year. It took advantage of the large stage of the Drury Lane Theatre with its hydraulics and moving components to dramatise the events. 
==Background and production==
During the run of his successful comedy &quot;Private Lives&quot; in London in 1930, Coward discussed with the impresario C. B. Cochran the idea of a large, spectacular production to follow the intimate &quot;Private Lives&quot;. He considered the idea of an epic set in the French revolution, but in an old copy of the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot; he saw a photograph of a troopship leaving for the Boer War, which gave him the idea for the new play. He outlined his scenario to Cochran and asked him to secure the Coliseum, London&#x27;s largest theatre. Cochran was unable to do so, but was able to book the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, which was not much smaller, provided Coward could guarantee an approximate opening date. Coward and his designer Gladys Calthrop inspected Drury Lane and found it adequate in terms of the size of its stage and its technical facilities, although two extra hydraulic lifts had to be installed for quick changes of scenery, and unlike the Coliseum it lacked the revolving stage Coward wanted. While Calthrop began designing hundreds of costumes and twenty-two sets, Coward worked on the script, which he completed in August 1931.

Rehearsals began the following month. With four hundred cast and crew members involved in the production, Coward divided the crowd into groups of twenty and assigned each a leader. Because remembering individual names would be impossible, everyone was given a colour and number for easy identification, thus allowing Coward to direct &quot;Number 7 red&quot; to cross downstage and shake hands with &quot;Number 15 yellow and black&quot;. Extras were encouraged to create their own bits of stage business, as long as it did not draw attention from the main action of the scene.

&quot;Cavalcade&quot; premiered on 13 October 1931, starring Mary Clare and Edward Sinclair as the Marryot parents and featuring John Mills, Binnie Barnes, Una O&#x27;Connor, Moya Nugent, Arthur Macrae, Irene Browne and Maidie Andrews in supporting roles. Despite a brief delay caused by a mechanical problem early in the first act, the performance was a strong success, and the play went on to become one of the year&#x27;s biggest West End hits, running for 405 performances. The play closed in September 1932.

==Synopsis==
===Part I===
====Scene 1: Sunday 31 December 1899. The drawing-room of a London House====
It is nearly midnight. Robert and Jane Marryot are seeing in the New Year quietly together in their London house. Their happiness is clouded by the Boer War: Jane&#x27;s brother is besieged in Mafeking, and Robert himself will shortly be going to South Africa. Robert and Jane invited their butler, Bridges, and his wife, Ellen, to join them. Bells, shouting, and sirens outside usher in the New Year, and Robert proposes a toast to 1900. Hearing her two boys stirring upstairs, Jane runs up to see after them, and her husband calls to her to bring them down to join the adults.

====Scene 2: Saturday 27 January 1900. A dockside====
A month later, a contingent of volunteers are leaving for the war. On the dockside Jane and Ellen are seeing off Robert and Bridges. As the men go aboard, Jane comforts Ellen, who is crying. A band strikes up &quot;Soldiers of the Queen&quot;. The volunteers wave their farewells to the cheering crowd.

====Scene 3: Friday 8 March 1900. The drawing-room of the Marryots&#x27; house====
The Marryot boys, Edward, aged twelve, and Joe, aged eight, are playing soldiers with a young friend, Edith Harris. She objects to being made to play &quot;the Boers&quot;, and they begin to quarrel. The noise brings in their mothers. Joe throws a toy at Edith, and is sharply slapped by Jane, whose nerves are on edge with anxiety about her brother and her husband. Her state of mind is not helped by a barrel-organ outside, playing &quot;Soldiers of the Queen&quot; under the window. Margaret, Edith&#x27;s mother, sends the organ-grinder away and proposes to take Jane to the theatre to take her mind off her worry.

====Scene 4: Friday 8 May 1900. A theatre====
Jane and Margaret are in a stage-box, watching &quot;MirabeIle&quot;, the currently popular musical comedy. The plot is the usual froth, but the denouement is not reached: the theatre manager comes onstage to announce that Mafeking has been relieved. Joyous uproar breaks out; the audience claps and cheers and some begin to sing &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot;.

====Scene 5: Monday 21 January 1901. The kitchen of the Marryots&#x27; house====
The cook, Annie the parlourmaid, and Ellen&#x27;s mother Mrs Snapper are preparing a special tea to greet Bridges on his return from the war. He comes in with Ellen, looking well, and kisses his little baby, Fanny. He tells them that he has bought a public house so that he and Ellen can work for themselves in future. The celebratory mood is dampened when Annie brings in a newspaper reporting that Queen Victoria is dying.

====Scene 6: Sunday 27 January 1901. Kensington Gardens====
This scene is all in mime. Robert and Jane are walking in Kensington Gardens with their children when they meet Margaret and Edith Harris. Everyone is in black, solemn and silent, following the Queen&#x27;s death.

====Scene 7: Saturday 2 February 1901. The Marryots&#x27; drawing-room====
On the balcony, Jane, Margaret, their children and the servants are watching Queen Victoria&#x27;s funeral procession. Robert, who was awarded the Victoria Cross is walking in the procession, and Jane has some difficulty in making her boys suppress their excitement and pay due respect as the coffin passes. As the lights fade, Joe comments, &quot;She must have been a very little lady &quot;.

====Scene 8: Thursday 14 May 1903. The grand staircase of a London house====
Jane and Robert are attending a grand ball given by the Duchess of Churt. The Major-domo announces, &quot;Sir Robert and Lady Marryot&quot;.

===Part II ===
====Scene I: Saturday 16 June 1906. The bar parlour of a London public house ====
Jane has brought her son Edward, now eighteen, to see Ellen in the flat above the public house. They have just finished tea, together with Flo and George, relations of the Bridges. Seven-year-old Fanny has been dancing to entertain them. Bridges enters, clearly drunk. Jane, dismayed, makes a tactful departure. Bridges starts to bully Fanny and is ejected from the room by George and Flo.

====Scene 2: Saturday 16 June 1906. A London street (exterior of the public house)====
After emerging from the pub, Bridges carries on up the road. He is knocked down and killed by a car.

====Scene 3: Wednesday 10 March 1909. The private room of a London restaurant====
Edward Marryot is holding his twenty-first birthday party, with many smart young guests. Rose, an actress from the old &quot;Mirabelle&quot; production, proposes his health and sings the big waltz number from the show.

====Scene 4: Monday 25 July 1910. The beach of a popular seaside resort====
A concert party of six &quot;Uncles&quot; is performing in a bandstand. Ellen and her family are there and Fanny wins a prize for a song and dance competition. They unexpectedly meet Margaret, Jane and Joe. Ellen tells them that she has kept on the pub since her husband&#x27;s death and that Fanny is now at a dancing-school and determined to go on the stage.

====Scene 5: Sunday 14 April 1912. The deck of an Atlantic liner====
Edward has married Edith Harris, and they are on their honeymoon. They speculate blithely how long the initial bliss of marriage will last. As they walk off, she lifts her cloak from where it has been draped on the ship rail, revealing the name &quot;Titanic&quot; on a lifebelt. The lights fade into complete darkness; the orchestra plays &quot;Nearer, My God, to Thee&quot; very quietly.

====Scene 6: Tuesday 4 August 1914. The Marryots&#x27; drawing-room ====
War has been declared. Robert and Joe are keen to join the army. Jane is horrified, and refuses to indulge in the jingoism she sees around her.

====Scene 7: 1914–1915–1916–1917–1918. Marching====
Soldiers are seen endlessly marching. The orchestra plays songs of the First World War.

====Scene 8: Tuesday 22 October 1918. A restaurant====
Joe and Fanny – now a rising young actress – are dining in a West End restaurant. Joe is in army officer&#x27;s uniform. He is on leave but is about to return to the Front. They discuss marriage, but she envisages opposition from his family, and bids him wait until he is back from the war for good.

====Scene 9: Tuesday 22 October 1918. A railway station====
Jane sees Joe off at the railway station. Like many of the women on the platform she is distressed.

====Scene 10: Monday 11 November 1918. The Marryots&#x27; drawing-room ====
Ellen visits Jane, having found out that Joe is emotionally involved with her daughter. The two mothers fall out: Ellen thinks Jane regards Fanny as beneath Joe socially. As Ellen is leaving, the maid brings in a telegram. Jane opens it and tells Ellen. &quot;You needn&#x27;t worry about Fanny and Joe any more, Ellen. He won&#x27;t be able to come back at all, because he&#x27;s dead.&quot;

====Scene 11: Monday 11 November 1918. Trafalgar Square====
Surrounded by the frantic revelry of Armistice Night, Jane is walking, dazed, through Trafalgar Square. With tears streaming down her face, she cheers wildly and waves a rattle, while the band plays &quot;Land of Hope and Glory &quot;.

===Part III ===
====Scene 1: Tuesday 31 December 1929. The Marryot&#x27;s drawing room====
Margaret and Jane, both now elderly, are sitting by the fire. Margaret leaves, after wishing a happy New Year to Jane and Robert, who has come in to drink a New Year toast with his wife. Jane drinks first to him and then to England: &quot;The hope that one day this country of ours, which we love so much, will find dignity and greatness, and peace again&quot;.

====Scene 2: Evening, 1930. A night club====
Robert, Jane, Margaret, Ellen, and the full company are in a night club. At the piano, Fanny sings &quot;Twentieth Century Blues&quot;, and after the song everyone dances.

====Scene 3: Chaos====
The lights fade, and a chaotic succession of images representative of life in 1929 is spotlighted. When the noise and confusion reach a climax the stage suddenly fades into darkness and silence. At the back a Union Jack glows through the darkness. The scene ends with the lights coming up on the massed company singing &quot;God Save the King&quot;.

==Revivals and adaptations==
The play was first revived in the West End in 1966, at the Scala Theatre, with a cast of 96 drama students from the Rose Bruford College. The reviewer in &quot;The Times&quot; found Coward&#x27;s work remained &quot;dazzling and durable&quot;. The first professional revival was in 1981 at the Redgrave Theatre in Farnham in a production directed by David Horlock and with a cast of 12 professional actors and 300 amateur performers. That production was filmed by the BBC and shown in 1982 as a two-part documentary, &quot;Cavalcade – A Backstage Story&quot;. In 1995 a production starring Gabrielle Drake and Jeremy Clyde as Jane and Robert Maryott played at Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre, London and on tour. The Citizens Theatre, Glasgow, presented the play in 1999, in a production by Philip Prowse.

A film adaptation in 1933 won three Academy Awards, including &quot;Best Picture&quot;. C. A. Lejeune called it &quot;the best British film that has ever been made&quot;, and expressed exasperation that British studios had not taken the play up instead of allowing it to go to Hollywood. &quot;Cavalcade&quot; was adapted for BBC radio by Val Gielgud and Felix Felton and broadcast three times in 1936. A 1970s television series, &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot;, was to some extent based on the play.

==Reception==
Opening just before the British General Election, the play&#x27;s strongly patriotic themes were credited by the Conservative Party for helping them secure a large percentage of the middle class votes, despite the fact Coward had conceived the project a full year before the election was held, and strenuously denied having any thought of influencing its outcome. King George V and Queen Mary attended the performance on election night and received Coward in the Royal Box during the second interval.
In &quot;The Daily Mail&quot; for 1 November 1931, Alan Parsons wrote:
Reviewing the 1999 revival, Michael Billington wrote that it displayed the contradictory elements in Coward&#x27;s writings, a show &quot;traditionally seen as a patriotic pageant about the first 30 years of the century&quot; but strongly anti-militaristic and portraying &quot;the anger that bubbles away among the working class&quot;. He concluded, &quot;&quot;Cavalcade&quot; is actually about the way the high hopes at the start of the century have turned to senseless slaughter and hectic hedonism&quot;.

==Music==
A record with the title &quot;Cavalcade Suite&quot; was made by the New Mayfair Orchestra. It contained a selection of the contemporary songs used in &quot;Cavalcade&quot;, introduced by Coward. At the end he speaks the toast to England from the play. (HMV C2289)

Coward himself recorded &quot;Lover of My Dreams&quot; (the Mirabelle Waltz Song), with, on the reverse, &quot;Twentieth Century Blues&quot;, played by the New Mayfair Novelty Orchestra, with vocal by an unnamed singer identified by Mander and Mitchenson as Al Bowlly. (HMV B4001)

&quot;Cavalcade—Vocal Medley&quot;: On this Coward sings &quot;Soldiers of the Queen&quot;, &quot;Goodbye, Dolly&quot;, &quot;Lover of My Dreams&quot;, &quot;I do Like to be Beside the Seside&quot;, &quot;Goodbye, My Bluebell&quot;, &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band&quot;, &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Doing It&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s All Go Down the Strand&quot;, &quot;If You were the Only Girl&quot;, &quot;Take Me Back to Dear Old Blighty&quot;, &quot;There&#x27;s a Long, Long Trail&quot;, &quot;Keep the Home Fires Burning&quot;, and &quot;Twentieth Century Blues&quot;. (HMV C2431).

Coward later recorded &quot;Twentieth Century Blues&quot; on the LP album &quot;Noël Coward in New York&quot;, with an orchestra conducted by Peter Matz. (Columbia ML 5163)

<doc id="44726" wikidata="Q58347" url="?curid=44726" title="Magnetoresistance">
<text>Magnetoresistance is the tendency of a material (often ferromagnetic) to change the value of its electrical resistance in an externally-applied magnetic field. There are a variety of effects that can be called magnetoresistance. Some occur in bulk non-magnetic metals and semiconductors, such as geometrical magnetoresistance, Shubnikov–de Haas oscillations, or the common positive magnetoresistance in metals. Other effects occur in magnetic metals, such as negative magnetoresistance in ferromagnets or anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR). Finally, in multicomponent or multilayer systems (e.g. magnetic tunnel junctions), giant magnetoresistance (GMR), tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR), colossal magnetoresistance (CMR), and extraordinary magnetoresistance (EMR) can be observed.

The first magnetoresistive effect was discovered in 1856 by William Thomson, better known as Lord Kelvin, but he was unable to lower the electrical resistance of anything by more than 5%. Today, systems including semimetals and concentric ring EMR structures are known. In these, a magnetic field can adjust the resistance by orders of magnitude. Since different mechanisms can alter the resistance, it is useful to separately consider situations where it depends on a magnetic field directly (e.g. geometric magnetoresistance and multiband magnetoresistance) and those where it does so indirectly through magnetization (e.g. AMR and TMR).

==Discovery==
William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) first discovered ordinary magnetoresistance in 1856. He experimented with pieces of iron and discovered that the resistance increases when the current is in the same direction as the magnetic force and decreases when the current is at 90° to the magnetic force. He then did the same experiment with nickel and found that it was affected in the same way but the magnitude of the effect was greater. This effect is referred to as anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR).


In 2007, Albert Fert and Peter Grünberg were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize for the discovery of giant magnetoresistance.

==Geometrical magnetoresistance==
An example of magnetoresistance due to direct action of magnetic field on electric current can be studied on a Corbino disc (see Figure).
It consists of a conducting annulus with perfectly conducting rims. Without a magnetic field, the battery drives a radial current between the rims. When a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the annulus is applied, (either into or out of the page) a circular component of current flows as well, due to Lorentz force. Initial interest in this problem began with Boltzmann in 1886, and independently was re-examined by Corbino in 1911.

In a simple model, supposing the response to the Lorentz force is the same as for an electric field, the carrier velocity is given by:
formula_1
where is the carrier mobility. Solving for the velocity, we find:

formula_2

where the effective reduction in mobility due to the -field (for motion perpendicular to this field) is apparent. Electric current (proportional to the radial component of velocity) will decrease with increasing magnetic field and hence the resistance of the device will increase. Critically, this magnetoresistive scenario depends sensitively on the device geometry and current lines and it does not rely on magnetic materials.

In a semiconductor with a single carrier type, the magnetoresistance is proportional to , where is the semiconductor mobility (units m2·V−1·s−1, equivalently m2·Wb−1, or T −1) and is the magnetic field (units teslas). Indium antimonide, an example of a high mobility semiconductor, could have an electron mobility above at . So in a field, for example the magnetoresistance increase would be 100%.

==Anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR)==
Thomson&#x27;s experiments are an example of AMR, a property of a material in which a dependence of electrical resistance on the angle between the direction of electric current and direction of magnetization is observed. The effect arises in most cases from the simultaneous action of magnetization and spin–orbit interaction (exceptions related to non-collinear magnetic order notwithstanding) and its detailed mechanism depends on the material. It can be for example due to a larger probability of s-d scattering of electrons in the direction of magnetization (which is controlled by the applied magnetic field). The net effect (in most materials) is that the electrical resistance has maximum value when the direction of current is parallel to the applied magnetic field. AMR of new materials is being investigated and magnitudes up to 50% have been observed in some uranium (but otherwise quite conventional) ferromagnetic compounds. Materials with extreme AMR have been identified driven by unconventional mechanisms such as a metal-insulator transition triggered by rotating the magnetic moments (while for some directions of magnetic moments, the system is semimetallic, for other directions a gap opens).

In polycrystalline ferromagnetic materials, the AMR can only depend on the angle between the magnetization and current direction and (as long as the resistivity of the material can be described by a rank-two tensor), it must follow
formula_3
where is the (longitudinal) resistivity of the film and are the resistivities for and , respectively. Associated with longitudinal resistivity, there is also transversal resistivity dubbed (somewhat confusingly) the planar Hall effect. In monocrystals, resistivity depends also on and individually.

To compensate for the non-linear characteristics and inability to detect the polarity of a magnetic field, the following structure is used for sensors. It consists of stripes of aluminum or gold placed on a thin film of permalloy (a ferromagnetic material exhibiting the AMR effect) inclined at an angle of 45°. This structure forces the current not to flow along the “easy axes” of thin film, but at an angle of 45°. The dependence of resistance now has a permanent offset which is linear around the null point. Because of its appearance, this sensor type is called &#x27;barber pole&#x27;.

The AMR effect is used in a wide array of sensors for measurement of Earth&#x27;s magnetic field (electronic compass), for electric current measuring (by measuring the magnetic field created around the conductor), for traffic detection and for linear position and angle sensing. The biggest AMR sensor manufacturers are Honeywell, NXP Semiconductors, STMicroelectronics, and Sensitec GmbH.

As theoretical aspects, I. A. Campbell, A. Fert, and O. Jaoul () derived an expression of the AMR ratio for Ni-based alloys using the two-current model with s-s and s-d scattering processes, where &#x27;s&#x27; is a conduction electron, and &#x27;d&#x27; is 3d states with the spin-orbit interaction. The AMR ratio is expressed as
formula_4
with formula_5 and formula_6, where formula_7, formula_8, and formula_9 are a spin-orbit coupling constant (so-called formula_10), an exchange field, and a resistivity for spin formula_11, respectively. In addition, recently, Satoshi Kokado et al. have obtained the general expression of the AMR ratio for 3d transition-metal ferromagnets by extending the theory to a more general one. The general expression can also be applied to half-metals.

<doc id="44730" wikidata="Q9580" url="?curid=44730" title="Burgos">
<text>Burgos () is a city in Spain located in the autonomous community of Castile and León. It is the capital and most populated municipality of the province of Burgos.

Burgos is situated in the north of the Iberian Peninsula, on the confluence of the Arlanzón river tributaries, at the edge of the central plateau. The municipality has a population of about 180,000 inhabitants. The Camino de Santiago pilgrimage route runs through Burgos.

Founded in 885 by the second Count of Castile, Diego Rodríguez Porcelos, Burgos soon became the leading city of the embryonic County of Castile. The 11th century chieftain Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar (&quot;El Cid&quot;) had connections with the city: born near Burgos, he was raised and educated there. Burgos experienced a long decline from the 17th century onwards.

Burgos became the headquarters of the Francoist proto-government (1936–1939) following the start of the Spanish Civil War. Declared in 1964 as Pole of Industrial Promotion and in 1969 as Pole of Industrial Development, the city has grown since then in terms of economic activity. At the regional level, Burgos forms part of an economic axis together with the cities of Valladolid and Palencia. In 2008, the international Burgos Airport started to service commercial flights.

The Museum of Human Evolution opened in Burgos in 2010. It features remains of the first hominins in Europe, who lived in the area 750,000–800,000 years ago. The Cathedral of Burgos is a World Heritage Site. Burgos was selected as the &quot;Spanish Gastronomy Capital&quot; of 2013. In 2015 UNESCO named it &quot;City of Gastronomy&quot;, and it has been part of the Creative Cities Network since then.

==Toponymy==
There are several possible origins for the toponymy. When the city was founded, the inhabitants of the surrounding country moved into the fortified village, whose Visigothic name of Burgos signified consolidated walled villages (Gothic &quot;baurgs&quot;). The cities Burgas in Bulgaria and numerous cities containing the Germanic burg &quot;city&quot; such as Hamburg have a similar literal composition. The city began to be called &quot;Caput Castellae&quot; (&quot;Cabeza de Castilla&quot; or &quot;Head of Castile&quot;).

==History==

Early humans occupied sites around Burgos as early as 800,000 years ago.
When the Romans took possession of what is now the province of Burgos, the site had been a Celtic city. In Roman times, it belonged to Hispania Citerior (&quot;Hither Spain&quot;) and then to Hispania Tarraconensis. In the 5th century, the Visigoths drove back the Suebi, then the Berbers occupied almost all of Castile in the 8th century, though only for a very brief period, and left little if any trace of their occupation. King Alfonso III the Great of León reconquered it about the middle of the 9th century, and built several castles for the defence of Christendom, which was then extended through the reconquest of lost territory. The region came to be known as Castile (Latin &quot;castella&quot;), i.e. &quot;(land of) castles&quot;.
Burgos was founded in 884 as an outpost of this expanding Christian frontier, when Diego Rodríguez &quot;Porcelos&quot;, count of Castile, governed this territory with orders to promote the increase of the Christian population; with this end in view he gathered the inhabitants of the surrounding country into one fortified village. The city began to be called &quot;Caput Castellae&quot; (&quot;Cabeza de Castilla&quot; or &quot;Head of Castile&quot;). The county (&quot;condado&quot;) of Castile, subject to the Kings of León, continued to be governed by counts and was gradually extended; one of these counts, Fernán González, established his independence.
In the 11th century, the city became the see of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Burgos and the capital of the Kingdom of Castile. Burgos was a major stop for pilgrims on the French Way the most popular path to Santiago de Compostela and a centre of trade between the Bay of Biscay and the south, which attracted an unusually large foreign merchant population, who became part of the city oligarchy and excluded other foreigners. Throughout the 13th and 14th centuries, Burgos was a favourite seat of the kings of León and Castile and a favoured burial site. The &quot;consejo&quot; or urban commune of Burgos was firmly in the hands of an oligarchic class of &quot;caballeros villanos&quot;, the &quot;peasant knights&quot; of Burgos, who provided the monarchs with a mounted contingent: in 1255 and 1266 royal charters granted relief from taxes to those citizens of Burgos who owned horses and could arm themselves, provided that they continue to live within the city walls. The merchant oligarchy succeeded the cathedral chapter as the major purchasers of land after 1250; they carried on their mercantile business in common with municipal or royal functions and sent their sons to England and Flanders to gain experience in overseas trade. A few families within the &quot;hermandades&quot; or confraternities like the Sarracín and Bonifaz succeeded in monopolising the post of &quot;alcalde&quot;, or mayor; a special court, the &quot;alcalde del rey&quot; was first mentioned at Burgos in 1281. By the reign of Alfonso X, the exemption of the non-noble knights and religious corporations, combined with exorbitant gifts and grants to monasteries and private individuals, placed great stress on the economic well-being of the realm.

In the century following the conquest of Seville (1248) on the Moors, Burgos became a testing ground for royal policies of increasing power against the &quot;consejo&quot;, in part by encouraging the right to appeal from the &quot;consejo&quot; to the king. In 1285, Sancho IV added a new body to the &quot;consejo&quot; which came to dominate it: the &quot;jurado&quot; in charge of collecting taxes and overseeing public works; the king reserved the right to select its members. The city perceived that danger to its autonomy came rather from an uncontrolled aristocracy during royal minorities: Burgos joined the &quot;hermandades&quot; of cities that leagued together for mutual protection in 1295 and 1315. In the 14th century, official royal intrusion in city affairs was perceived as a palliative against outbreaks of violence by the large excluded class of smaller merchants and artisans, on whom the tax burden fell. The &quot;alguacil&quot; was the royal official instituted to judge disagreements.

On 9 June 1345, sweeping aside the city government, Alfonso XI established direct royal rule of Burgos through the &quot;Regimiento&quot; of sixteen appointed men.

In 1574, Pope Gregory XIII made the bishopric a Metropolitan archbishopric, at the request of king Felipe II.

Burgos has been the scene of many wars: with the Moors, the struggles between León and Navarre, and between Castile and Aragon. In the Peninsular War against Napoleonic France, the siege of Burgos (between 19 September to 21 October) was a scene of a withdrawal for Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington. Again in the 19th-century Carlist civil wars of the Spanish succession Burgos was the scene of a battle. During the Spanish Civil War, Burgos was the base of General Franco&#x27;s rebel nationalist government.

=== Jewish History ===
Historically, there was a large and thriving Jewish community in Burgos. Its first documentation dates to 974. In the 13th century, Burgos was the largest Jewish center in northern Castile. Renowned Talmudists Meir Abulafia, Todros ben Joseph Abulafia, and poet Todros ben Judah Halevi Abulafia were born in Burgos. In the latter half of the 13th century, many kabbalists began moving to Burgos. After new restrictions were imposed on Jews, and they began to suffer from more violent acts of antisemitism, many converted to Christianity. The most well-known convert from Burgos, Paul of Burgos, was originally a Spanish Jew named Solomon Halevi. During the Edict of Expulsion in 1492, most Jews in Burgos became conversos rather than fleeing Spain. Those who did went to Portugal.

==Geography and climate==
At an elevation of , the city of Burgos has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Csb&quot;, with some continental influence resulting from its distance from the sea and higher altitude. It features chilly and windy winters, due to altitude and an inland location, which always include snow and temperatures below freezing. Burgos is considered the coldest city in Spain, among cities with a population of more than 100,000 inhabitants. Temperature ranges can be extreme and Burgos is drier than Spain&#x27;s coastal regions, although there is year-round precipitation. Average annual precipitation is and the average annual relative humidity is 72%. In winter, temperatures very often (almost every day) drop below freezing, often reaching temperatures as low as , and snowfalls are common, while the summer months see average high temperatures of . The lowest recorded temperature in Burgos was on 20 January 1885. The highest recorded temperature was on 13 August 1987.



==Sights==
Burgos is rich in ancient churches and convents. The three most notable are the cathedral, with its chapel of the Condestables de Castilla (Lords Constable of Castile), the monastery of Las Huelgas and the Carthusian monastery of Miraflores. Minor notable churches are San Esteban, San Gil (Sancti Aegidii), San Pedro, San Cosme y San Damián, Santiago (Sancti Jacobi), San Lorenzo and San Lesmes (Adelelmi). The Convento de la Merced, occupied by the Jesuits, and the Hospital del Rey are also of historic and architectural interest.

Among the other interesting architectural structures, in the walls of the city are the gateway of Santa María, erected for the first entrance of the Emperor Charles V, and the arch of Fernán González.

===Gothic Cathedral===

Construction on Burgos&#x27; Gothic Cathedral began in 1221 and spanned mainly from the 13th to 15th centuries. It has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Cathedral is the resting place for El Cid (the famous knight from Medieval Spain&#x27;s history) and his wife Dona Jimena. The west front is flanked by towers terminating in octagonal spires covered with open stonework traceries. The middle section, which serves as an entrance, has three alabaster pilasters, the intercolumnar spaces bearing panel-pictures representing the martyrdom of saints. The façade possesses ornate and fantastic surface decoration.

The octagonal chapel of the Condestable, in florid, thus highly sculpted, Gothic design, has a roof finished with balustraded turrets, needle-pointed pinnacles and statues. In the lower portion, coats of arms, shields and crouching lions have been worked into the ensemble. The exterior of the sacristy is decorated with carved traceries, figures of angels and armoured knights. The elaborate tabernacle is composed of two octagonal sections in Corinthian style.

===Monasterio de las Huelgas===

The &quot;Monasterio de las Huelgas Reales&quot; (Monastery of the Royal Retreats) on the outskirts of the city, was founded in 1180 by king Alfonso VIII, and was begun in a pre-Gothic style, although almost every style has been introduced over many additions. The remarkable cloisters have been described as &quot;unrivalled for beauty both of detail and design, and perhaps unsurpassed by anything in its age and style in any part of Europe&quot; (1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;). One cloister has semicircular arches with delicate and varied columns; the other has an ogival style of early Gothic. The interior of the church has enormous columns supporting its magnificent vault; the entrance is modern. This convent historically benefited from extraordinary privileges granted to its abbess by kings and popes.

===Miraflores Charterhouse===

The Carthusian monastery, Miraflores Charterhouse (&quot;Cartuja de Miraflores&quot;) is situated about four kilometres from the historic city center. Among the treasures of the Charterhouse are the wooden statue of St. Bruno, the wooden choir stalls in the church and the tombs of King Juan II and of his spouse, Queen Isabella of Portugal, constructed of marble and with their recumbent effigies sculpted in alabaster. Around the top frieze are statues of angels in miniature. The French soldiers in the Spanish War of Independence (1814) mutilated this work, cutting off some of the heads and carrying them away to France. King Juan II&#x27;s daughters by his first wife, heiresses Princesses Catherine and Eleanor of Asturias, are also buried in the monastery.

=== Castle ===
Located on a hill 75 meters above the city, it is a medieval defensive fortress built during the time of the reconquest. Used by Castilian kings as accommodation and a place for celebrations, it later became an artillery fort and then a weapons factory. After its destruction by the French during the War of Independence in 1813, there are hardly any buildings left standing. From the Castle it is possible to see fantastic views of the city.

==Museums==

Burgos has a total of 10 museums, the newest being the Museum of Human Evolution (the 10th most visited museum in Spain).

===Museum of Human Evolution===
The Museum of Human Evolution was inaugurated on 13 July 2010. Its foundation is based on the archaeological site of Atapuerca located east of Burgos. The Atapuerca site has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It contains several caves, where fossils and stone tools of the earliest known hominids in West Europe have been found, near Atapuerca Mountains.

The museum also allows the visitor to travel to the archaeological site and biological park.

===Museum of Burgos===
It summarizes the history of the province of Burgos. It has important objects and documents from all the ages, starting from Atapuerca, passing to the Romans and Iberians, and finishing in the contemporary period. These include the traditional sword of El Cid.

The museum is located in the renaissances palaces, the House of Íñigo Angulo and the House of Miranda, which has a main patio that structures the museum.

===Book Museum===
Between the Main Square &quot;Plaza Mayor&quot; and the Promenade of the Espolón &quot;Paseo del Espolón,&quot; on the side street, Travesía del Mercado nº3, you find the Fadrique de Basilea Book Museum &quot;Museo del Libro Fadrique de Basilea&quot;, of the Burgos publisher, Siloé, a cosy museum that shows the history of the book from its first written form to its modern electronic form.

==Education==

State Education in Spain is free, and compulsory from 6 to 16 years. The current education system is called LOE (&quot;Ley Orgánica de Educación&quot;).

===Universities===

;University of Burgos

Often abbreviated &#x27;UBU&#x27;, the University of Burgos is a public university with about 10,000 students studying over 30 different undergraduate degrees, over 20 PhD Programmes, as well as several Official Masters and other graduate courses. It was established in 1994 when it was divided from the University of Valladolid.

UBU cooperates with the Erasmus Project, a European Union (EU) student-exchange programme, and each semester hosts students from various countries across the 15-state European Union, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Malta and associated countries in Eastern Europe. Additionally, university students from various regions around the world including China, Latin and North America are able to participate in exchange programmes to study abroad at the University of Burgos. In total, the University of Burgos has education agreements with over 100 international academic institutions.

Isabella I of Castile University

Isabella I of Castile University, established in 2008, is a private state-recognized university located in Burgos. It was fully accredited by the Spanish Government in 2011.

==Parks and recreation==

Most of the parks in the city of Burgos can be found along the river Arlanzón. Indeed, the banks of the river itself constitute a green corridor along the city. In total, there are nearly 3 square miles (1,878 acres) of parks in Burgos and one tree for every 3 inhabitants.

* El Parque del Castillo (or the Castle Park) is one of the lungs of the city. The city grew from the southern foot of the hill of the castle. Gradually, some of the upper neighborhoods began disappearing. After the destruction of the castle, military installations were established there. In the 1950s, the engineer Jaquotot Mariano, who later became mayor of the city, decided to leave the hill completely bare. Besides the ruins of the castle, this park contains the &quot;Bird Conservation Center&quot;, as well as play areas for children and spaces for exercise. Also, there is a terraced area with gardens and an ornamental fountain. The highlight of the park is the viewpoint from which you get a great view of the city, especially the cathedral. A metal plaque on the rail at the vista point helps to identify the most characteristic places of the city. The park contains the unique view of the city of Burgos from the viewpoint of the Castle. During special events throughout the year, visitors can see fireworks displays from that same view point. The park can be reached by car where there is parking, and on foot by climbing a series of stairs starting from the church of San Esteban.

* Fuentes Blancas is Burgos&#x27; most visited large park extending east from the city along the river Arlanzón. It contains a network of walking and biking paths and includes camping and various outdoor recreational activities.
* El Paseo del Espolón is the tree-lined promenade that is the most emblematic of Burgos. It&#x27;s situated along the banks of the river Arlanzón, and consists of a landscaped walk that goes from the theater square to the Arc de Santa Maria, passing shops and cafes.

* El Paseo de la Isla is another one of Burgos&#x27; tree-lined garden walks. It passes by the Palacio de la Isla which served as one of Franco&#x27;s headquarters during the Spanish Civil War and is currently the Language Institute of Castilian and Leonese.
* Parque de El Parral is located at the old &quot;Hospital del Rey&quot;, a former hospital for pilgrims of the &quot;Way of Saint James&quot;, now part of the University of Burgos campus.
* El paseo de la Quinta is located on the south bank of the Arlanzón River, on the old and new path of the Cartuja de Miraflores. In the natural area of Las Veguillas, the Municipal Nurseries and the Fuentes Blancas Park, a wooded area near the city and close to the extensive pine forests of La Cartuja. It gets its name from old property of Burgos prelates, known as Quinta del Arzobispo.


== Economy ==
Burgos is one of Spain&#x27;s richest cities, with a GDP above the Spain average. It is an important trade and tourist center with a sizeable manufacturing base.

===Agriculture===
Wheat is a major crop. The city is surrounded by wheat fields.

===Secondary sector===
Burgos is a very industrial city, with a secondary sector widely developed. The city has the biggest industrial park of north Spain, called &quot;Villalonquéjar&quot;.

The city is the headquarters of Grupo Antolin, designer and manufacturer of interior automotive components.

It is also the headquarters for south Europe Benteler International.

===Tertiary sector===
It employs the bigger percentage in the city and is represented by the public sector (production, delivery and allocation of goods and services), due to the capital status.

==Culture==
The city has a complete culture infrastructure, remarked by the Auditorio y Palacio de Congresos de Burgos, which opened in mid-2012.

===Language===
Spanish, also called Castilian, originated in Castile and spread throughout the Crown of Castile&#x27;s possessions following the reconquista. It was eventually dispersed throughout the Spanish empire following the conquest and colonization of the Americas, and Spain after the union of the Catholic Monarchs&#x27;s kingdoms being co-spoken with other languages. Of the many different variations and dialects found throughout the world, it&#x27;s argued that the purest Spanish can be found in the region of Burgos due to the fact that the language first developed here in the 10th century.

The Spanish language can be traced back to the monastery of Valpuesta located north-east of the city of Burgos. The Valpuesta cartularies are significant in the history of the Spanish language, and their status as manuscripts containing the earliest words written in Spanish has been officially recognised.
The first utterings of Spanish continued in the &quot;Silos Glosses&quot;, recorded in the Burgos monastery of Santo Domingo de Silos.

===Cuisine===

Burgos province is famous in gastronomy for:
Queso de Burgos, a white cheese which is soft and unctuous (because it is made with whey). Although originally made with sheep&#x27;s milk, now cow&#x27;s milk or mixtures are more common. Each &quot;comarca&quot; (rural district) produces a minor variation, and the major dairies produce an industrial product that is acceptable for people with sensitive digestion.

Burgos is blessed with a moderate climate and this fresh cheese was able to be conserved there without the need for curing of more than 10 days. With the improvement of aseptic industrial production processes this can be extended to about 30 days at a cool 6 °C. Its production reaches 35,000 tons annually.

Morcilla de Burgos, a pig&#x27;s-blood sausage (black pudding), is a staple country food known across the Iberian peninsula. Spiced with onions and herbs its most noticeable content is rice (often mistaken for fat) which makes it one of the lightest and healthiest products of its kind. Oral tradition says that it must be &quot;salty, smooth and piquant&quot; (see Spanish pages for details). As with the Queso de Burgos, several comarcas or towns in the province (Cardeñadijo, Sotopalacios, Aranda de Duero, Briviesca, Covarrubias, Villarcayo, Trespaderne, Miranda de Ebro...) made their own morcillas, with minor variations between them.

Even though Burgos is not on a D.O. wine is a fundamental piece in local gastronomy thanks to nearby wine cellars from Ribera de Duero, Rioja and Arlanza D.O.

===Festivals===
The city&#x27;s main festival is San Pedro y San Pablo (also referred to locally as &quot;Sampedros&quot;) celebrated on June 29. Every year, for about two weeks, the city celebrates with fireworks, concerts, sports, folklore, games for children, theater and other activities.

==Transportation==
===Burgos Airport===
Burgos Airport is located only from the city centre, with daily flights to Barcelona International Airport, and during spring and summer to Palma de Mallorca and Paris Orly.

===Railway===

The city is considered a first-class rail route through which one rail lines circulate, operated by Renfe: Madrid–Hendaye railway. The faster trains use the AVE line between Madrid and Valladolid.

2010 marked 150 years since the arrival of the first railway to the city; the first train was present on 25 October 1860. Madrid was joined with the French border and this was considered the main route of railway communication between Spain and Europe. Located at the halfway point, Burgos soon become an important hub of communications between the centre and the north.

Since December 2007, the city has been connected to the main provincial capitals by high-speed service Alvia. It also provides other services, middle and long distance, which connect with the main population centres of the country. 18 long distance trains and 12 middle distance trains circulate through the station each day, which results in around 330,000 yearly users.

The new railway station was opened on 12 December 2008 under the name Burgos-Rosa de Lima, belonging to ADIF. It is located in the neighbourhood of Villímar, northeast of the city, and was adapted for the arrival of AVE. Bus 25 takes travellers direct to the city centre.

In July 2022, AVE high speed trains started serving the city, connecting it to cities such as Madrid in 1 hour and 33 minutes with a stop in Valladolid, or Bilbao in 70 minutes. Starting in January 2023, AVE will connect Burgos to Valencia in 3 hours and 30 minutes without the need to transfer in Madrid.

===Trams===
A project to implement a tram for the city has been planned, which would run the length of the Boulevard, officially called the Avenida de Valencia. It would consist of a line of about long and will originate from the Burgos-Rosa de Lima railway station and end at the University of Burgos. Its cost is estimated between 80 and 120 million euros.

Due to the economic crisis and real estate, the project has been postponed temporarily until further funding becomes available. In February 2010 work began on the development of the Boulevard, which reserves a lane for public transport: first buses, and eventually the tram.

===Bus===
Burgos has an international bus station located in the city centre, just one hundred meters from the Cathedral. It connects the city with nearly every region of Spain, as well as with a wide number of European (Amsterdam, Basel, Bern, Bratislava, Brussels, Cologne, Hamburg, Frankfurt, Geneva, Gdańsk, Kyiv, Lisbon, Ljubljana, Lviv, Łódź, London, Lyon, Marseille, Moscow, Munich, Nice, Paris, Porto, Prague, Rotterdam, Sofia, The Hague, Warsaw, Zürich) and even North African (Casablanca, Marrakech, Rabat) cities.


===Bicycle===
The city has its own public bicycle rental system, called &quot;Bicibur&quot;. It has been designed by a local company and has more than 20 points of distribution throughout the city. A network of over of bicycle lanes net the city making it the 6th largest bicycle lane network in Spain and the first in kilometres per resident.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Burgos is twinned with:
* Loudun, France
* Pessac, France

==In media==
Segundo de Chomón filmed a short documentary about Burgos in 1911.

Scenes from &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; were filmed near Burgos, which doubled for the Southwestern United States. The location called Sad Hill Cemetery (specifically in Santo Domingo de Silos), was where the last sequence of the film was shot.

Burgos is the setting for a scene in the 2010 film &quot;The Way&quot;, directed by Emilio Estevez and starring his father Martin Sheen.

==Sports==

The first football team in the city, Burgos CF, was founded in 1936, reaching the top division for six seasons in the late 1970s, before disappearing due to serious economic debts in 1983. It was replaced as the main football team of the city by its reserve team, renamed Real Burgos CF, which itself ceased to compete in 1994, after three successful seasons at the top flight. A new incarnation of Burgos CF was immediately refounded, but didn&#x27;t start to compete until the 1994 season, in the sixth-tier &quot;Primera Provincial&quot; division. The team gradually transformed into professionalism, and since 2021 it plays in the second division of the Spanish football pyramid, hosting games at the El Plantío stadium.

The city has two professional basketball teams, CB San Pablo and CB Tizona, both playing (as of 2024) in the second division of the Spanish basketball league system.

<text>Calcium carbonate is a chemical compound with the chemical formula . It is a common substance found in rocks as the minerals calcite and aragonite, most notably in chalk and limestone, eggshells, gastropod shells, shellfish skeletons and pearls. Materials containing much calcium carbonate or resembling it are described as calcareous. Calcium carbonate is the active ingredient in agricultural lime and is produced when calcium ions in hard water react with carbonate ions to form limescale. It has medical use as a calcium supplement or as an antacid, but excessive consumption can be hazardous and cause hypercalcemia and digestive issues.

==Chemistry==
Calcium carbonate shares the typical properties of other carbonates. Notably, it:
*reacts with acids, releasing carbonic acid which quickly disintegrates into carbon dioxide and water:
*releases carbon dioxide upon heating, called a thermal decomposition reaction, or calcination (to above 840 °C in the case of ), to form calcium oxide, CaO, commonly called quicklime, with reaction enthalpy 178 kJ/mol:

* reacts with gaseous hydrogen to form methane and water vapor plus solid calcium oxide or calcium hydroxide depending on temperature and product gas composition. Various metals including palladium and nickel are catalysts for the reaction.

Calcium carbonate reacts with water that is saturated with carbon dioxide to form the soluble calcium bicarbonate.

This reaction is important in the erosion of carbonate rock, forming caverns, and leads to hard water in many regions.

An unusual form of calcium carbonate is the hexahydrate ikaite, . Ikaite is stable only below 8 °C.

==Preparation==
The vast majority of calcium carbonate used in industry is extracted by mining or quarrying. Pure calcium carbonate (such as for food or pharmaceutical use), can be produced from a pure quarried source (usually marble).

Alternatively, calcium carbonate is prepared from calcium oxide. Water is added to give calcium hydroxide then carbon dioxide is passed through this solution to precipitate the desired calcium carbonate, referred to in the industry as precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) This process is called carbonatation:
:
In a laboratory, calcium carbonate can easily be crystallized from calcium chloride (), by placing an aqueous solution of in a desiccator alongside ammonium carbonate . In the desiccator, ammonium carbonate is exposed to air and decomposes into ammonia, carbon dioxide, and water. The carbon dioxide then diffuses into the aqueous solution of calcium chloride, reacts with the calcium ions and the water, and forms calcium carbonate.

==Structure==
The thermodynamically stable form of under normal conditions is hexagonal β- (the mineral calcite). Other forms can be prepared, the denser (2.83 g/cm3) orthorhombic λ- (the mineral aragonite) and hexagonal μ-, occurring as the mineral vaterite. The aragonite form can be prepared by precipitation at temperatures above 85 °C; the vaterite form can be prepared by precipitation at 60 °C. Calcite contains calcium atoms coordinated by six oxygen atoms; in aragonite they are coordinated by nine oxygen atoms. The vaterite structure is not fully understood. Magnesium carbonate () has the calcite structure, whereas strontium carbonate () and barium carbonate () adopt the aragonite structure, reflecting their larger ionic radii.

== Polymorphs ==
Calcium carbonate crystallizes in three anhydrous polymorphs, of which calcite is the thermodynamically most stable at room temperature, aragonite is only slightly less so, and vaterite is the least stable.

=== Crystal structure ===
The calcite crystal structure is trigonal, with space group Rc (No. 167 in the International Tables for Crystallography), and Pearson symbol hR10. Aragonite is orthorhombic, with space group Pmcn (No 62), and Pearson Symbol oP20. Vaterite is composed of at least two different coexisting crystallographic structures. The major structure exhibits hexagonal symmetry in space group P63/mmc, the minor structure is still unknown.

=== Crystallization ===

All three polymorphs crystallize simultaneously from aqueous solutions under ambient conditions. In additive-free aqueous solutions, calcite forms easily as the major product, while aragonite appears only as a minor product.

At high saturation, vaterite is typically the first phase precipitated, which is followed by a transformation of the vaterite to calcite. This behavior seems to follow Ostwald&#x27;s rule, in which the least stable polymorph crystallizes first, followed by the crystallization of different polymorphs via a sequence of increasingly stable phases. However, aragonite, whose stability lies between those of vaterite and calcite, seems to be the exception to this rule, as aragonite does not form as a precursor to calcite under ambient conditions.

Aragonite occurs in majority when the reaction conditions inhibit the formation of calcite and/or promote the nucleation of aragonite. For example, the formation of aragonite is promoted by the presence of magnesium ions, or by using proteins and peptides derived from biological calcium carbonate. Some polyamines such as cadaverine and Poly(ethylene imine) have been shown to facilitate the formation of aragonite over calcite.

=== Selection by organisms ===
Organisms, such as molluscs and arthropods, have shown the ability to grow all three crystal polymorphs of calcium carbonate, mainly as protection (shells) and muscle attachments. Moreover, they exhibit a remarkable capability of phase selection over calcite and aragonite, and some organisms can switch between the two polymorphs. The ability of phase selection is usually attributed to the use of specific macromolecules or combinations of macromolecules by such organisms.

==Occurrence==
===Geological sources===
Calcite, aragonite and vaterite are pure calcium carbonate minerals. Industrially important source rocks which are predominantly calcium carbonate include limestone, chalk, marble and travertine.

===Biological sources===

Eggshells, snail shells and most seashells are predominantly calcium carbonate and can be used as industrial sources of that chemical. Oyster shells have enjoyed recent recognition as a source of dietary calcium, but are also a practical industrial source. Dark green vegetables such as broccoli and kale contain dietarily significant amounts of calcium carbonate, but they are not practical as an industrial source.

Annelids in the family Lumbricidae, earthworms, possess a regionalization of the digestive track called calciferous glands, Kalkdrüsen, or glandes de Morren, that processes calcium and  into calcium carbonate, which is later excreted into the dirt. The function of these glands is unknown but is believed to serve as a regulation mechanism within the animals&#x27; tissues. This process is ecologically significant, stabilizing the pH of acid soils.

===Extraterrestrial===
Beyond Earth, strong evidence suggests the presence of calcium carbonate on Mars. Signs of calcium carbonate have been detected at more than one location (notably at Gusev and Huygens craters). This provides some evidence for the past presence of liquid water.

==Geology==

Carbonate is found frequently in geologic settings and constitutes an enormous carbon reservoir. Calcium carbonate occurs as aragonite, calcite and dolomite as significant constituents of the calcium cycle. The carbonate minerals form the rock types: limestone, chalk, marble, travertine, tufa, and others.

In warm, clear tropical waters corals are more abundant than towards the poles where the waters are cold. Calcium carbonate contributors, including plankton (such as coccoliths and planktic foraminifera), coralline algae, sponges, brachiopods, echinoderms, bryozoa and mollusks, are typically found in shallow water environments where sunlight and filterable food are more abundant. Cold-water carbonates do exist at higher latitudes but have a very slow growth rate. The calcification processes are changed by ocean acidification.

Where the oceanic crust is subducted under a continental plate sediments will be carried down to warmer zones in the asthenosphere and lithosphere. Under these conditions calcium carbonate decomposes to produce carbon dioxide which, along with other gases, give rise to explosive volcanic eruptions.

===Carbonate compensation depth===
The carbonate compensation depth (CCD) is the point in the ocean where the rate of precipitation of calcium carbonate is balanced by the rate of dissolution due to the conditions present. Deep in the ocean, the temperature drops and pressure increases. Increasing pressure also increases the solubility of calcium carbonate. Calcium carbonate is unusual in that its solubility increases with decreasing temperature. The carbonate compensation depth ranges from 4,000 to 6,000 meters below sea level in modern oceans, and the various polymorphs (calcite, aragonite) have different compensation depths based on their stability.

===Role in taphonomy===
Calcium carbonate can preserve fossils through permineralization. Most of the vertebrate fossils of the Two Medicine Formation—a geologic formation known for its duck-billed dinosaur eggs—are preserved by permineralization. This type of preservation conserves high levels of detail, even down to the microscopic level. However, it also leaves specimens vulnerable to weathering when exposed to the surface.

Trilobite populations were once thought to have composed the majority of aquatic life during the Cambrian, due to the fact that their calcium carbonate-rich shells were more easily preserved than those of other species, which had purely chitinous shells.

==Uses==
===Construction===
The main use of calcium carbonate is in the construction industry, either as a building material, or limestone aggregate for road building, as an ingredient of cement, or as the starting material for the preparation of builders&#x27; lime by burning in a kiln. However, because of weathering mainly caused by acid rain, calcium carbonate (in limestone form) is no longer used for building purposes on its own, but only as a raw primary substance for building materials.

Calcium carbonate is also used in the purification of iron from iron ore in a blast furnace. The carbonate is calcined &quot;in situ&quot; to give calcium oxide, which forms a slag with various impurities present, and separates from the purified iron.

In the oil industry, calcium carbonate is added to drilling fluids as a formation-bridging and filtercake-sealing agent; it is also a weighting material which increases the density of drilling fluids to control the downhole pressure. Calcium carbonate is added to swimming pools, as a pH corrector for maintaining alkalinity and offsetting the acidic properties of the disinfectant agent.

It is also used as a raw material in the refining of sugar from sugar beet; it is calcined in a kiln with anthracite to produce calcium oxide and carbon dioxide. This burnt lime is then slaked in fresh water to produce a calcium hydroxide suspension for the precipitation of impurities in raw juice during carbonatation.

Calcium carbonate in the form of chalk has traditionally been a major component of blackboard chalk. However, modern manufactured chalk is mostly gypsum, hydrated calcium sulfate . Calcium carbonate is a main source for growing biorock. Precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC), pre-dispersed in slurry form, is a common filler material for latex gloves with the aim of achieving maximum saving in material and production costs.

Fine ground calcium carbonate (GCC) is an essential ingredient in the microporous film used in diapers and some building films, as the pores are nucleated around the calcium carbonate particles during the manufacture of the film by biaxial stretching. GCC and PCC are used as a filler in paper because they are cheaper than wood fiber. Printing and writing paper can contain 10–20% calcium carbonate. In North America, calcium carbonate has begun to replace kaolin in the production of glossy paper. Europe has been practicing this as alkaline papermaking or acid-free papermaking for some decades. PCC used for paper filling and paper coatings is precipitated and prepared in a variety of shapes and sizes having characteristic narrow particle size distributions and equivalent spherical diameters of 0.4 to 3 micrometers.

Calcium carbonate is widely used as an extender in paints, in particular matte emulsion paint where typically 30% by weight of the paint is either chalk or marble. It is also a popular filler in plastics. Some typical examples include around 15–20% loading of chalk in unplasticized polyvinyl chloride (uPVC) drainpipes, 5–15% loading of stearate-coated chalk or marble in uPVC window profile. PVC cables can use calcium carbonate at loadings of up to 70 phr (parts per hundred parts of resin) to improve mechanical properties (tensile strength and elongation) and electrical properties (volume resistivity). Polypropylene compounds are often filled with calcium carbonate to increase rigidity, a requirement that becomes important at high usage temperatures. Here the percentage is often 20–40%. It also routinely used as a filler in thermosetting resins (sheet and bulk molding compounds) and has also been mixed with ABS, and other ingredients, to form some types of compression molded &quot;clay&quot; poker chips. Precipitated calcium carbonate, made by dropping calcium oxide into water, is used by itself or with additives as a white paint, known as whitewashing.

Calcium carbonate is added to a wide range of trade and do it yourself adhesives, sealants, and decorating fillers. Ceramic tile adhesives typically contain 70% to 80% limestone. Decorating crack fillers contain similar levels of marble or dolomite. It is also mixed with putty in setting stained glass windows, and as a resist to prevent glass from sticking to kiln shelves when firing glazes and paints at high temperature.

In ceramic glaze applications, calcium carbonate is known as &quot;whiting&quot;, and is a common ingredient for many glazes in its white powdered form. When a glaze containing this material is fired in a kiln, the whiting acts as a flux material in the glaze. Ground calcium carbonate is an abrasive (both as scouring powder and as an ingredient of household scouring creams), in particular in its calcite form, which has the relatively low hardness level of 3 on the Mohs scale, and will therefore not scratch glass and most other ceramics, enamel, bronze, iron, and steel, and have a moderate effect on softer metals like aluminium and copper. A paste made from calcium carbonate and deionized water can be used to clean tarnish on silver.

===Health and diet===

Calcium carbonate is widely used medicinally as an inexpensive dietary calcium supplement or gastric antacid (such as Tums and Eno). It may be used as a phosphate binder for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia (primarily in patients with chronic kidney failure). It is used in the pharmaceutical industry as an inert filler for tablets and other pharmaceuticals.

Calcium carbonate is used in the production of calcium oxide as well as toothpaste and has seen a resurgence as a food preservative and color retainer, when used in or with products such as organic apples.

Calcium carbonate is used therapeutically as phosphate binder in patients on maintenance haemodialysis. It is the most common form of phosphate binder prescribed, particularly in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease. Calcium carbonate is the most commonly used phosphate binder, but clinicians are increasingly prescribing the more expensive, non-calcium-based phosphate binders, particularly sevelamer.

Excess calcium from supplements, fortified food, and high-calcium diets can cause milk-alkali syndrome, which has serious toxicity and can be fatal. In 1915, Bertram Sippy introduced the &quot;Sippy regimen&quot; of hourly ingestion of milk and cream, and the gradual addition of eggs and cooked cereal, for 10 days, combined with alkaline powders, which provided symptomatic relief for peptic ulcer disease. Over the next several decades, the Sippy regimen resulted in kidney failure, alkalosis, and hypercalcaemia, mostly in men with peptic ulcer disease. These adverse effects were reversed when the regimen stopped, but it was fatal in some patients with protracted vomiting. Milk-alkali syndrome declined in men after effective treatments for peptic ulcer disease arose. Since the 1990s it has been most frequently reported in women taking calcium supplements above the recommended range of 1.2 to 1.5 grams daily, for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, and is exacerbated by dehydration. Calcium has been added to over-the-counter products, which contributes to inadvertent excessive intake. Excessive calcium intake can lead to hypercalcemia, complications of which include vomiting, abdominal pain and altered mental status.

As a food additive it is designated E170, and it has an INS number of 170. Used as an acidity regulator, anticaking agent, stabilizer or color it is approved for usage in the EU, US and Australia and New Zealand. It is &quot;added by law to all UK milled bread flour except wholemeal&quot;. It is used in some soy milk and almond milk products as a source of dietary calcium; at least one study suggests that calcium carbonate might be as bioavailable as the calcium in cow&#x27;s milk. Calcium carbonate is also used as a firming agent in many canned and bottled vegetable products.

Several calcium supplement formulations have been documented to contain the chemical element lead, posing a public health concern. Lead is commonly found in natural sources of calcium.

===Agriculture and aquaculture===
Agricultural lime, powdered chalk or limestone, is used as a cheap method of neutralising acidic soil, making it suitable for planting, also used in aquaculture industry for pH regulation of pond soil before initiating culture. There is interest in understanding whether or not it can affect pesticide adsorption and desorption in calcareous soil.

===Household cleaning===
Calcium carbonate is a key ingredient in many household cleaning powders like Comet and is used as a scrubbing agent.

===Pollution mitigation===
In 1989, a researcher, Ken Simmons, introduced into the Whetstone Brook in Massachusetts. His hope was that the calcium carbonate would counter the acid in the stream from acid rain and save the trout that had ceased to spawn. Although his experiment was a success, it did increase the amount of aluminium ions in the area of the brook that was not treated with the limestone. This shows that can be added to neutralize the effects of acid rain in river ecosystems. Currently calcium carbonate is used to neutralize acidic conditions in both soil and water. Since the 1970s, such &quot;liming&quot; has been practiced on a large scale in Sweden to mitigate acidification and several thousand lakes and streams are limed repeatedly.

Calcium carbonate is also used in flue-gas desulfurization applications eliminating harmful and emissions from coal and other fossil fuels burnt in large fossil fuel power stations.

===Plastics===
Calcium carbonate is commonly used in the plastic industry as a filler. When it is incorporated in a plastic material, it can improve the hardness, stiffness, dimensional stability and processability of the material.

==Calcination equilibrium==
Calcination of limestone using charcoal fires to produce quicklime has been practiced since antiquity by cultures all over the world. The temperature at which limestone yields calcium oxide is usually given as 825 °C, but stating an absolute threshold is misleading. Calcium carbonate exists in equilibrium with calcium oxide and carbon dioxide at any temperature. At each temperature there is a partial pressure of carbon dioxide that is in equilibrium with calcium carbonate. At room temperature the equilibrium overwhelmingly favors calcium carbonate, because the equilibrium pressure is only a tiny fraction of the partial pressure in air, which is about 0.035 kPa.

At temperatures above 550 °C the equilibrium pressure begins to exceed the pressure in air. So above 550 °C, calcium carbonate begins to outgas into air. However, in a charcoal fired kiln, the concentration of will be much higher than it is in air. Indeed, if all the oxygen in the kiln is consumed in the fire, then the partial pressure of in the kiln can be as high as 20 kPa.

The table shows that this partial pressure is not achieved until the temperature is nearly 800 °C. For the outgassing of from calcium carbonate to happen at an economically useful rate, the equilibrium pressure must significantly exceed the ambient pressure of . And for it to happen rapidly, the equilibrium pressure must exceed total atmospheric pressure of 101 kPa, which happens at 898 °C.

==Solubility==
===With varying pressure===

Calcium carbonate is poorly soluble in pure water (47 mg/L at normal atmospheric partial pressure as shown below).

The equilibrium of its solution is given by the equation (with dissolved calcium carbonate on the right):

where the solubility product for is given as anywhere from &quot;K&quot;sp = to &quot;K&quot;sp = at 25 °C, depending upon the data source. What the equation means is that the product of molar concentration of calcium ions (moles of dissolved per liter of solution) with the molar concentration of dissolved cannot exceed the value of &quot;K&quot;sp. This seemingly simple solubility equation, however, must be taken along with the more complicated equilibrium of carbon dioxide with water (see carbonic acid). Some of the combines with in the solution according to

 is known as the bicarbonate ion. Calcium bicarbonate is many times more soluble in water than calcium carbonate—indeed it exists &quot;only&quot; in solution.

Some of the combines with in solution according to

Some of the breaks up into water and dissolved carbon dioxide according to

And dissolved carbon dioxide is in equilibrium with atmospheric carbon dioxide according to

For ambient air, &quot;P&quot; is around atm (or equivalently 35 Pa). The last equation above fixes the concentration of dissolved as a function of &quot;P&quot;, independent of the concentration of dissolved . At atmospheric partial pressure of , dissolved concentration is moles per liter. The equation before that fixes the concentration of as a function of concentration. For [] = , it results in = moles per liter. When is known, the remaining three equations together with
:

(which is true for all aqueous solutions), and the constraint that the solution must be electrically neutral, i.e., the overall charge of dissolved positive ions must be cancelled out by the overall charge of dissolved negative ions , make it possible to solve simultaneously for the remaining five unknown concentrations (the previously mentioned form of the neutrality is valid only if calcium carbonate has been put in contact with pure water or with a neutral pH solution; in the case where the initial water solvent pH is not neutral, the balance is not neutral).

The adjacent table shows the result for and (in the form of pH) as a function of ambient partial pressure of (&quot;K&quot;sp = has been taken for the calculation).
* At atmospheric levels of ambient the table indicates that the solution will be slightly alkaline with a maximum solubility of 47 mg/L.
* As ambient partial pressure is reduced below atmospheric levels, the solution becomes more and more alkaline. At extremely low &quot;P&quot;, dissolved , bicarbonate ion, and carbonate ion largely evaporate from the solution, leaving a highly alkaline solution of calcium hydroxide, which is more soluble than . For &quot;P&quot; = 10−12 atm, the product is still below the solubility product of (). For still lower pressure, precipitation will occur before precipitation.
* As ambient partial pressure increases to levels above atmospheric, pH drops, and much of the carbonate ion is converted to bicarbonate ion, which results in higher solubility of .

The effect of the latter is especially evident in day-to-day life of people who have hard water. Water in aquifers underground can be exposed to levels of much higher than atmospheric. As such water percolates through calcium carbonate rock, the dissolves according to one of the trends above. When that same water then emerges from the tap, in time it comes into equilibrium with levels in the air by outgassing its excess . The calcium carbonate becomes less soluble as a result, and the excess precipitates as lime scale. This same process is responsible for the formation of stalactites and stalagmites in limestone caves.

Two hydrated phases of calcium carbonate, monohydrocalcite and ikaite , may precipitate from water at ambient conditions and persist as metastable phases.

=== With varying pH, temperature and salinity: scaling in swimming pools ===
In contrast to the open equilibrium scenario above, many swimming pools are managed by addition of sodium bicarbonate () to the concentration of about 2 mmol/L as a buffer, then control of pH through use of HCl, , , NaOH or chlorine formulations that are acidic or basic. In this situation, dissolved inorganic carbon (total inorganic carbon) is far from equilibrium with atmospheric . Progress towards equilibrium through outgassing of is slowed by
In this situation, the dissociation constants for the much faster reactions
allow the prediction of concentrations of each dissolved inorganic carbon species in solution, from the added concentration of (which constitutes more than 90% of Bjerrum plot species from pH 7 to pH 8 at 25 °C in fresh water). Addition of will increase concentration at any pH. Rearranging the equations given above, we can see that = , and [] = . Therefore, when concentration is known, the maximum concentration of ions before scaling through precipitation can be predicted from the formula:

:[]max = × 

The solubility product for (&quot;K&quot;sp) and the dissociation constants for the dissolved inorganic carbon species (including &quot;K&quot;a2) are all substantially affected by temperature and salinity, with the overall effect that []max increases from freshwater to saltwater, and decreases with rising temperature, pH, or added bicarbonate level, as illustrated in the accompanying graphs.

The trends are illustrative for pool management, but whether scaling occurs also depends on other factors including interactions with ,  and other ions in the pool, as well as supersaturation effects. Scaling is commonly observed in electrolytic chlorine generators, where there is a high pH near the cathode surface and scale deposition further increases temperature. This is one reason that some pool operators prefer borate over bicarbonate as the primary pH buffer, and avoid the use of pool chemicals containing calcium.

===Solubility in a strong or weak acid solution===
Solutions of strong (HCl), moderately strong (sulfamic) or weak (acetic, citric, sorbic, lactic, phosphoric) acids are commercially available. They are commonly used as descaling agents to remove limescale deposits. The maximum amount of that can be &quot;dissolved&quot; by one liter of an acid solution can be calculated using the above equilibrium equations.
* In the case of a strong monoacid with decreasing acid concentration [A] = [], we obtain (with molar mass = 100 g/mol):

:where the initial state is the acid solution with no (not taking into account possible dissolution) and the final state is the solution with saturated . For strong acid concentrations, all species have a negligible concentration in the final state with respect to and so that the neutrality equation reduces approximately to 2[] = [] yielding [] ≈ 0.5 []. When the concentration decreases, [] becomes non-negligible so that the preceding expression is no longer valid. For vanishing acid concentrations, one can recover the final pH and the solubility of in pure water.
* In the case of a weak monoacid (here we take acetic acid with p&quot;K&quot;a = 4.76) with decreasing total acid concentration [A] = [] + [AH], we obtain:
:For the same total acid concentration, the initial pH of the weak acid is less acid than the one of the strong acid; however, the maximum amount of which can be dissolved is approximately the same. This is because in the final state, the pH is larger than the p&quot;K&quot;a, so that the weak acid is almost completely dissociated, yielding in the end as many ions as the strong acid to &quot;dissolve&quot; the calcium carbonate.
* The calculation in the case of phosphoric acid (which is the most widely used for domestic applications) is more complicated since the concentrations of the four dissociation states corresponding to this acid must be calculated together with [], [], [], [] and []. The system may be reduced to a seventh degree equation for [] the numerical solution of which gives

:where [A] = is the total acid concentration. Thus phosphoric acid is more efficient than a monoacid since at the final almost neutral pH, the second dissociated state concentration [] is not negligible (see phosphoric acid).

<doc id="44734" wikidata="Q183670" url="?curid=44734" title="Chalk">
<text>Chalk is a soft, white, porous, sedimentary carbonate rock. It is a form of limestone composed of the mineral calcite and originally formed deep under the sea by the compression of microscopic plankton that had settled to the sea floor. Chalk is common throughout Western Europe, where deposits underlie parts of France, and steep cliffs are often seen where they meet the sea in places such as the Dover cliffs on the Kent coast of the English Channel.

Chalk is mined for use in industry, such as for quicklime, bricks and builder&#x27;s putty, and in agriculture, for raising pH in soils with high acidity. It is also used for &quot;blackboard chalk&quot; for writing and drawing on various types of surfaces, although these can also be manufactured from other carbonate-based minerals, or gypsum.

==Description==
Chalk is a fine-textured, earthy type of limestone distinguished by its light colour, softness, and high porosity. It is composed mostly of tiny fragments of the calcite shells or skeletons of plankton, such as foraminifera or coccolithophores. These fragments mostly take the form of calcite plates ranging from 0.5 to 4 microns in size, though about 10% to 25% of a typical chalk is composed of fragments that are 10 to 100 microns in size. The larger fragments include intact plankton skeletons and skeletal fragments of larger organisms, such as molluscs, echinoderms, or bryozoans.

Chalk is typically almost pure calcite, , with just 2% to 4% of other minerals. These are usually quartz and clay minerals, though collophane (cryptocrystalline apatite, a phosphate mineral) is also sometimes present, as nodules or as small pellets interpreted as fecal pellets. In some chalk beds, the calcite has been converted to dolomite, , and in a few cases the dolomitized chalk has been dedolomitized back to calcite.

Chalk is highly porous, with typical values of porosity ranging from 35 to 47 per cent. While it is similar in appearance to both gypsum and diatomite, chalk is identifiable by its hardness, fossil content, and its reaction to acid (it produces effervescence on contact).

==Formation==
In Western Europe, chalk was formed in the Late Cretaceous Epoch and the early Palaeocene Epoch (between 100 and 61 million years ago). It was deposited on extensive continental shelves at depths between , during a time of nonseasonal (likely arid) climate that reduced the amount of erosion from nearby exposed rock. The lack of nearby erosion explains the high purity of chalk. The coccolithophores, foraminifera, and other microscopic organisms from which the chalk came mostly form low-magnesium calcite skeletons, so the sediments were already in the form of highly stable low-magnesium calcite when deposited. This is in contrast with most other limestones, which formed from high-magnesium calcite or aragonite that rapidly converted to the more stable low-magnesium calcite after deposition, resulting in the early cementation of such limestones. In chalk, the absence of calcium carbonate conversion process prevented early cementation, and it accounts for chalk&#x27;s high porosity. Additionally, chalk is the only form of limestone that commonly shows signs of compaction.

Flint (a type of chert) is very common as bands parallel to the bedding or as nodules in seams, or linings to fractures, embedded in chalk. It is probably derived from sponge spicules or other siliceous organisms as water is expelled upwards during compaction. Flint is often deposited around larger fossils such as Echinoidea which may be silicified (i.e. replaced molecule by molecule by flint).

==Geology and geographic distribution==

Chalk is so common in Cretaceous marine beds that the Cretaceous Period was named for these deposits. The name Cretaceous was derived from Latin &quot;creta&quot;, meaning &quot;chalk&quot;. Some deposits of chalk were formed after the Cretaceous.

The Chalk Group is a European stratigraphic unit deposited during the late Cretaceous Period. It forms the famous White Cliffs of Dover in Kent, England, as well as their counterparts of the Cap Blanc Nez on the other side of the Dover Strait. The Champagne region of France is mostly underlain by chalk deposits, which contain artificial caves used for wine storage. Some of the highest chalk cliffs in the world occur at Jasmund National Park in Germany and at Møns Klint in Denmark.

Chalk deposits are also found in Cretaceous beds on other continents, such as the Austin Chalk, Selma Group, and Niobrara Formations of the North American interior. Chalk is also found in western Egypt (Khoman Formation) and western Australia (Miria Formation).

Chalk of Oligocene to Neogene age has been found in drill cores of rock under the Pacific Ocean at Stewart Arch in the Solomon Islands.

There are layers of chalk, containing &quot;Globorotalia&quot;, in the Nicosia Formation of Cyprus, which formed during the Pliocene.

==Mining==

Chalk is mined from chalk deposits both above ground and underground. Chalk mining boomed during the Industrial Revolution, due to the need for chalk products such as quicklime and bricks.

==Uses==
Most people first encounter chalk in school where it refers to blackboard chalk, which was originally made of mineral chalk, since it readily crumbles and leaves particles that stick loosely to rough surfaces, allowing it to make writing that can be readily erased. Blackboard chalk manufacturers now may use mineral chalk, other mineral sources of calcium carbonate, or the mineral gypsum (calcium sulfate). While gypsum-based blackboard chalk is the lowest cost to produce, and thus widely used in the developing world, use of carbonate-based chalk produces larger particles and thus less dust, and it is marketed as &quot;dustless chalk&quot;.

Coloured chalks, pastel chalks, and sidewalk chalk (shaped into larger sticks and often coloured), used to draw on sidewalks, streets, and driveways, are primarily made of gypsum rather than calcium carbonate chalk.
Magnesium carbonate chalk is commonly used as a drying agent to obtain better grip by gymnasts and rock climbers.

Glazing putty mainly contains chalk as a filler in linseed oil.

Chalk and other forms of limestone may be used for their properties as a base. Chalk is a source of quicklime by thermal decomposition, or slaked lime following quenching of quicklime with water. In agriculture, chalk is used for raising pH in soils with high acidity. Small doses of chalk can also be used as an antacid. Additionally, the small particles of chalk make it a substance ideal for cleaning and polishing. For example, toothpaste commonly contains small amounts of chalk, which serves as a mild abrasive. Polishing chalk is chalk prepared with a carefully controlled grain size, for very fine polishing of metals.

French chalk (also known as tailor&#x27;s chalk) is traditionally a hard chalk used to make temporary markings on cloth, mainly by tailors. It is now usually made of talc (magnesium silicate).

Chalk beds form important petroleum reservoirs in the North Sea and along the Gulf Coast of North America.

=== Previous uses ===
In southeast England, deneholes are a notable example of ancient chalk pits. Such bell pits may also mark the sites of ancient flint mines, where the prime object was to remove flint nodules for stone tool manufacture. The surface remains at Cissbury are one such example, but perhaps the most famous is the extensive complex at Grimes Graves in Norfolk.

Chalk was traditionally used in recreation. In field sports, such as tennis played on grass, powdered chalk was used to mark the boundary lines of the playing field or court. If a ball hits the line, a cloud of chalk or pigment dust will be visible. In recent years, powdered chalk has been replaced with titanium dioxide. In gymnastics, rock-climbing, weightlifting and tug of war, chalk — now usually magnesium carbonate — is applied to the hands and feet to remove perspiration and reduce slipping.

Chalk may also be used as a house construction material instead of brick or wattle and daub: quarried chalk was cut into blocks and used as ashlar, or loose chalk was rammed into blocks and laid in mortar. There are still houses standing which have been constructed using chalk as the main building material. Most are pre-Victorian though a few are more recent.

A mixture of chalk and mercury can be used as fingerprint powder. However, because of the toxicity of the mercury, the use of such mixtures for fingerprinting was abandoned in 1967.

<text>Sharon Marie Tate Polanski (January 24, 1943 – August 9, 1969) was an American actress and model. During the 1960s, she appeared in advertisements and small television roles before appearing in films as well as working as a model. After receiving positive reviews for her comedic and dramatic acting performances, Tate was hailed as one of Hollywood&#x27;s most promising newcomers, being compared favorably with the late Marilyn Monroe. 

She made her film debut in 1961 as an extra in &quot;Barabbas&quot; with Anthony Quinn. She next appeared in the British mystery horror film &quot;Eye of the Devil&quot; (1966). Her first major role was as Jennifer North in the 1967 American drama film &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot;, which earned her a Golden Globe Award nomination. The role would help her to become a rising sex symbol of Hollywood, appearing in a Playboy photoshoot by filmmaker Roman Polanski, Tate&#x27;s future husband. That year, she also performed in the comedy horror film &quot;The Fearless Vampire Killers&quot;, directed by Roman Polanski. Tate&#x27;s last completed film, &quot;12+1&quot;, was released posthumously in 1969.

On August 9, 1969, Tate and four others were murdered by members of the Manson Family, a cult, in the home she shared with Polanski, while he was away. She was eight-and-a-half months pregnant.

== Biography ==
===1943–1964: Childhood and early acting career===

Sharon Marie Tate was born on January 24, 1943, in Dallas, Texas, the eldest of three daughters to Colonel Paul James Tate, a United States Army intelligence officer, and his wife, Doris Gwendolyn (née Willett). At six months of age, Tate won the &quot;Miss Tiny Tot of Dallas Pageant&quot;, but her parents had no show business ambitions for their daughter. Paul Tate was promoted and transferred several times. By the age of 16, Tate had lived in six cities and reportedly found it difficult to maintain friendships. Her family described her as shy and lacking in self-confidence. As an adult, Tate commented that people would misinterpret her shyness as aloofness until they knew her better.

Tate attended South Shaver Elementary in Pasadena, Texas through 1955, Chief Joseph Junior High School (now middle school) from September 1955 to June 1958, and Columbia High School in Richland, Washington, from September 1958 to October 1959. In El Paso, Texas, she attended Irvin High School from late fall 1959 to April 1960 and then Vicenza American High School in Vicenza, Italy, from April 1960 to graduation in June 1961.

As she matured, people commented on Tate&#x27;s appearance; she began entering beauty pageants, winning the title of &quot;Miss Richland&quot; in Washington in 1959 at age sixteen. She spoke of her ambition to study psychiatry and her intention to compete in the &quot;Miss Washington&quot; pageant in 1960; however, before she could do either, her father was transferred to Italy. With her family relocating to Verona, Tate learned that she had become a local celebrity owing to the publication of a photograph of her in a swimsuit on the cover of the military newspaper &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot;. She discovered a kinship with other students at the American school she attended in nearby Vicenza, recognizing that their backgrounds and feelings of separation were similar to her own, and, for the first time in her life, began to form lasting friendships.

Tate and her friends became interested in the filming of &quot;Hemingway&#x27;s Adventures of a Young Man,&quot; which was being made nearby with Paul Newman, Susan Strasberg and Richard Beymer, and obtained parts as film extras. Beymer noticed Tate in the crowd and introduced himself, and the two dated during the production of the film, with Beymer encouraging Tate to pursue a film career. In 1960, Tate was employed by the singer Pat Boone and appeared with him in an episode of the television series &quot;The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom&quot; which was filmed in Venice.
Later that year, when &quot;Barabbas&quot; was being filmed near Verona, Tate was once again hired as an extra. Actor Jack Palance was impressed by her appearance and attitude, although her role was too small to judge her talent. He arranged a screen test for her in Rome, but this did not lead to further work. Tate returned to the United States alone, saying that she wanted to further her studies, but tried to find film work. After a few months, Doris Tate, who feared for her daughter&#x27;s safety, suffered a nervous breakdown and her daughter was persuaded to return to Italy.

The family returned to the United States in 1962 and Tate moved to Los Angeles, where she contacted Richard Beymer&#x27;s agent, Harold Gefsky. After their first meeting, Gefsky agreed to represent her, and secured work for her in television and magazine advertisements. In 1963, he introduced her to Martin Ransohoff, director of Filmways, Inc., who signed her to a seven-year contract. She was considered for the role of Billie Jo Bradley on CBS&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Petticoat Junction,&quot; but Ransohoff believed that she lacked confidence and the role was given to Jeannine Riley. Ransohoff gave Tate small parts in &quot;Mister Ed&quot; and &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; to help her gain experience, but was unwilling to allow her to play a more substantial role. &quot;Mr. Ransohoff didn&#x27;t want the audience to see me till I was ready&quot;, Tate was quoted in a 1967 article in &quot;Playboy&quot;.

During this time, Tate met the French actor Philippe Forquet and began a relationship with him in 1963. They became engaged, but their relationship was volatile and they frequently argued. Career pressures drove them apart and they broke up the next year in 1964.
In 1964, she met Jay Sebring, a former sailor who had established himself as a leading hair stylist in Hollywood. Tate later said that Sebring&#x27;s nature was especially gentle but, when he proposed marriage, she declined. She said that she would retire from acting as soon as she married and, at that time, she intended to focus on her career.

===1964–1967: Hollywood recognition and &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot;===
In 1964, Tate made a screen test for Sam Peckinpah opposite Steve McQueen for the film &quot;The Cincinnati Kid&quot;. Ransohoff and Peckinpah agreed that Tate&#x27;s timidity and lack of experience would cause her to flounder in such a large part, and she was rejected in favor of Tuesday Weld. She continued to gain experience with minor television appearances and, after she auditioned unsuccessfully for the role of Liesl in the film version of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, Ransohoff gave Tate walk-on roles in two motion pictures in which he was the producer: &quot;The Americanization of Emily&quot; and &quot;The Sandpiper&quot;. In late 1965, Ransohoff finally gave Tate her first major role in a motion picture in the film &quot;Eye of the Devil&quot;, costarring David Niven, Deborah Kerr, Donald Pleasence and David Hemmings.
Tate and Sebring traveled to London to prepare for filming, where she met the Alexandrian Wiccan High Priest and High Priestess Alex and Maxine Sanders. Meanwhile, as part of Ransohoff&#x27;s promotion of Tate, he arranged the production of a short documentary called &quot;All Eyes on Sharon Tate&quot;, to be released at the same time as &quot;Eye of the Devil&quot;. It included an interview with &quot;Eye of the Devil&quot; director J. Lee Thompson, who expressed his initial doubts about Tate&#x27;s potential with the comment, &quot;We even agreed that if after the first two weeks Sharon was not quite making it, we would put her back in cold storage&quot;, but added that he soon realized Tate was &quot;tremendously exciting&quot;.

Tate played Odile, a witch who exerts a mysterious power over a landowner, played by Niven, and his wife, played by Kerr. Although she did not have as many lines as the other actors, Tate&#x27;s performance was considered crucial to the film, and she was required, more than the other cast members, to set an ethereal tone. Niven described her as a &quot;great discovery&quot;, and Kerr said that, with &quot;a reasonable amount of luck&quot;, Tate would be a great success. In interviews, Tate commented on her good fortune in working with such professionals in her first film and said that she had learned a lot about acting simply by watching Kerr at work. Much of the filming took place in France, and Sebring returned to Los Angeles to fulfill his business obligations. After filming, Tate remained in London, where she immersed herself in the fashion world and nightclubs. Around this time, she met Roman Polanski.
Tate and Polanski later agreed that neither of them had been impressed by the other when they first met. Polanski was planning &quot;The Fearless Vampire Killers&quot;, which was being coproduced by Ransohoff, and had decided that he wanted the red-headed actress Jill St. John for the female lead. Ransohoff insisted that Polanski cast Tate and, after meeting with her, Polanski agreed that she would be suitable on the condition that she wore a red wig during filming. The company traveled to Italy for filming, where Tate&#x27;s fluent Italian proved useful in communicating with the local crew members. A perfectionist, Polanski had little patience with the inexperienced Tate and said in an interview that one scene had required 70 takes before he was satisfied. In addition to directing, Polanski also played one of the main characters, a guileless young man who is intrigued by Tate&#x27;s character and begins a romance with her. As filming progressed, Polanski praised her performances and her confidence grew. They began a relationship and Tate moved into Polanski&#x27;s London apartment after filming ended. Jay Sebring traveled to London, where he insisted on meeting Polanski. Although friends later said he was devastated, he befriended Polanski and remained Tate&#x27;s closest confidant. Polanski later commented that Sebring was a lonely and isolated person, who viewed Tate and himself as his family.

Tate returned to the United States to film &quot;Don&#x27;t Make Waves&quot; with Tony Curtis, leaving Polanski in London. Tate played the role of Malibu and the film was intended to capitalize on the popularity of beach movies at the time, as well as the music of such artists as the Beach Boys and Jan and Dean. Tate&#x27;s character, billed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer publicity as &quot;Malibu, Queen of the Surf&quot;, wore little more than a bikini for most of the film. Disappointed with the film, she began sarcastically referring to herself as &quot;sexy little me&quot;. Before the film&#x27;s release, Tate featured in a major publishing campaign for Coppertone sunscreen. The film opened to poor reviews and mediocre ticket sales, and Tate was quoted as confiding to a reporter, &quot;It&#x27;s a terrible movie&quot;, before adding, &quot;Sometimes I say things I shouldn&#x27;t. I guess I&#x27;m too outspoken.&quot;

Polanski returned to the United States and was contracted by the head of Paramount Pictures, Robert Evans, to direct and write the screenplay for &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot;, which was based on Ira Levin&#x27;s novel of the same name. Polanski later admitted that he had wanted Tate to star in the film and had hoped that someone would suggest her, as he felt it inappropriate to make the suggestion himself. The producers did not suggest Tate, and Mia Farrow was cast. A frequent visitor to the set, Tate was photographed there by &quot;Esquire&quot; and the resulting photographs generated considerable publicity for both Tate and the film. A March 1967 article about Tate in &quot;Playboy&quot; began, &quot;This is the year that Sharon Tate happens ...&quot; and included six nude or partially nude photographs taken by Roman Polanski during filming of &quot;The Fearless Vampire Killers&quot;. Tate was optimistic: &quot;Eye of the Devil&quot; and &quot;The Fearless Vampire Killers&quot; were each due for release.
She had been cast to play a major role in the screenplay of &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot;. One of the all-time bestsellers, the film version was highly publicized and anticipated, and, while Tate acknowledged that such a prominent role should further her career, she confided to Polanski that she did not like either the book or the script. Patty Duke, Barbara Parkins and Judy Garland were cast as the other leads. Susan Hayward replaced Garland a few weeks later when she was dismissed. Director Mark Robson was highly critical of the three principal actresses but, according to Duke, directed most of his criticism at Tate. Duke later said that Robson &quot;continually treated [Tate] like an imbecile, which she definitely was not, and she was very attuned and sensitive to this treatment&quot;. Polanski later quoted Robson as saying to him, &quot;That&#x27;s a great girl you&#x27;re living with. Few actresses have her kind of vulnerability. She&#x27;s got a great future.&quot;

In interviews during production, Tate expressed an affinity for her character, Jennifer North, an aspiring actress admired only for her body. Some magazines commented that Tate was viewed similarly and &quot;Look&quot; published an unfavorable article about the three lead actresses, describing Tate as &quot;a hopelessly stupid and vain starlet&quot;. Tate, Duke and Parkins developed a close friendship that continued after the completion of the film. During the shooting of &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot;, Tate confided to Parkins that she was &quot;madly in love&quot; with Polanski. &quot;Yes, there&#x27;s no doubt that Roman is the man in my life&quot;, Tate was quoted as saying in the New York &quot;Sunday News&quot;. Tate promoted the film enthusiastically. She frequently commented on her admiration for Lee Grant, with whom she had played several dramatic scenes. Tate was quoted as saying, &quot;I learned a great deal about acting in [&quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot;], particularly in my scenes with Lee Grant... She knows what acting is all about and everything she does, from little mannerisms to delivering her lines, is pure professionalism.&quot;

A journalist asked Tate to comment on her nude scene, and she replied,

I have no qualms about it at all. I don&#x27;t see any difference between being stark naked or fully dressed — if it&#x27;s part of the job and it&#x27;s done with meaning and intention. I honestly don&#x27;t understand the big fuss made over nudity and sex in films. It&#x27;s silly. On TV, the children can watch people murdering each other, which is a very unnatural thing, but they can&#x27;t watch two people in the very natural process of making love. Now, really, that doesn&#x27;t make any sense, does it?
An edited version of &quot;The Fearless Vampire Killers&quot; was released, and Polanski expressed disgust at Ransohoff for &quot;butchering&quot; his film. &quot;Newsweek&quot; called it &quot;a witless travesty&quot;, and it was not profitable. Tate&#x27;s performance was largely ignored in reviews and, when she was mentioned, it was usually in relation to her nude scenes. &quot;Eye of the Devil&quot; was released shortly after, and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer attempted to build interest in Tate with its press release describing her as &quot;one of the screen&#x27;s most exciting new personalities&quot;. The film failed to find an audience and most reviews were indifferent, neither praising nor condemning it. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that one of the few highlights was Tate&#x27;s &quot;chillingly beautiful but expressionless performance&quot;.

The &quot;All Eyes on Sharon Tate&quot; documentary was used to publicize the film. Its 14 minutes consisted of a number of scenes depicting Tate filming &quot;Eye of the Devil&quot;, dancing in nightclubs, and sightseeing around London, and also contained a brief interview with her. Asked about her acting ambitions, she replied, &quot;I don&#x27;t fool myself. I can&#x27;t see myself doing Shakespeare.&quot; She spoke of her hopes of finding a niche in comedy and, in other interviews, she expressed her desire to become &quot;a light comedienne in the Carole Lombard style&quot;. She discussed the type of contemporary actress she wanted to emulate and explained that there were two in particular that she was influenced by: Faye Dunaway and Catherine Deneuve. Of the latter, she said, &quot;I&#x27;d like to be an American Catherine Deneuve. She plays beautiful, sensitive, deep parts with a little bit of intelligence behind them.&quot;

Later in the year, &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot; opened to almost uniformly negative reviews. Bosley Crowther wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;all a fairly respectful admirer of movies can do is laugh at it and turn away&quot;. &quot;Newsweek&quot; said that the film &quot;has no more sense of its own ludicrousness than a village idiot stumbling in manure&quot;, but a later article read: &quot;Astoundingly photogenic, infinitely curvaceous, Sharon Tate is one of the most smashing young things to hit Hollywood in a long time.&quot; The three lead actresses were castigated in numerous publications, including &quot;The Saturday Review&quot;, which wrote, &quot;Ten years ago ... Parkins, Duke, and Tate would more likely have been playing the hat check girls than movie-queens; they are totally lacking in style, authority, or charm.&quot; &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; provided some positive comments, such as, &quot;Sharon Tate emerges as the film&#x27;s most sympathetic character ... William H. Daniels&#x27; photographic caress of her faultless face and enormous absorbent eyes is stunning.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; praised Tate as &quot;a wonder to behold&quot; but, after describing the dialogue in one scene as &quot;the most offensive and appalling vulgarity ever thrown up by any civilization&quot;, concluded that, &quot;I will be unable to take her any more seriously as a sex symbol than Raquel Welch.&quot;

=== 1968–1969: Marriage to Roman Polanski and final films ===

In late 1967, Tate and Polanski returned to London and were frequent subjects of newspaper and magazine articles. She was depicted as being untraditional and modern, and was quoted as saying that couples should live together before marrying. They were married in Chelsea, London, on January 20, 1968 (four days before Tate&#x27;s 25th birthday), with considerable publicity. Polanski was dressed in &quot;Edwardian finery&quot; while Tate was attired in an off-white taffeta minidress. The couple moved into Polanski&#x27;s mews house off Eaton Square in Belgravia, London.

Photographer Peter Evans described them as &quot;the imperfect couple. They were the Douglas Fairbanks/Mary Pickford of our time…. Cool, nomadic, talented, and nicely shocking.&quot; Tate reportedly wanted a traditional marriage but Polanski remained promiscuous and described her attitude to his infidelity as &quot;Sharon&#x27;s big hang-up&quot;. He reminded her that she had promised not to change him. Tate accepted his conditions, though she confided to friends that she hoped that he would change. Peter Evans quoted Tate as saying, &quot;We have a good arrangement. Roman lies to me and I pretend to believe him.&quot;

Polanski urged Tate to end her association with Martin Ransohoff, and she began to place less importance on her career until Polanski told her that he wanted to be married to &quot;a hippie, not a housewife&quot;. The couple returned to Los Angeles and quickly became part of a social group that included some of the most successful young people in the film industry, including Warren Beatty, Jacqueline Bisset, Leslie Caron, Joan Collins, Mia Farrow, Jane Fonda, Peter Fonda, Laurence Harvey, Steve McQueen, Joanna Pettet and Peter Sellers; older film stars such as Yul Brynner, Kirk Douglas, Henry Fonda and Danny Kaye; musicians such as Jim Morrison and the Mamas &amp; the Papas; and record producer Terry Melcher and his girlfriend Candice Bergen. Jay Sebring remained one of the couple&#x27;s more frequent companions. Polanski&#x27;s friends included Wojciech Frykowski, whom Polanski had known since his youth in Poland, and Frykowski&#x27;s girlfriend Abigail Folger, the coffee heiress. Tate and Polanski moved into the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles for a few months until they arranged to lease Patty Duke&#x27;s home on Summit Ridge Drive in Beverly Hills during the latter part of 1968. The Polanski house was often full of strangers, and Tate regarded the casual atmosphere as part of the &quot;free spirit&quot; of the times, saying that she did not mind who came into her home as her motto was &quot;live and let live&quot;. Her close friend Leslie Caron commented that the Polanskis were too trusting, &quot;to the point of recklessness&quot;, and that she had been alarmed by it.

In the summer of 1968, Tate began work on &quot;The Wrecking Crew&quot;, a comedy in which she played Freya Carlson, an accident-prone spy who was also a romantic interest for star Dean Martin, playing Matt Helm. She performed her own stunts and was taught martial arts by Bruce Lee. The film was successful and brought Tate strong reviews, with many reviewers praising her comedic performance. &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Vincent Canby criticized the film but wrote, &quot;The only nice thing is Sharon Tate, a tall, really great-looking girl.&quot; Martin commented that he intended to make another &quot;Matt Helm&quot; film and that he wanted Tate to reprise her role.

Around this time, Tate was feted as a promising newcomer. She was nominated for a Golden Globe Award as &quot;New Star of the Year – Actress&quot; for her performance in &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot;, and she placed fourth behind Mia Farrow, Judy Geeson and Katharine Houghton for a &quot;Golden Laurel&quot; award as the year&#x27;s &quot;Most Promising Newcomer&quot;. She was also runner-up to Lynn Redgrave in the &quot;Motion Picture Herald&quot;″s poll for &quot;The Star of Tomorrow&quot;, in which box-office drawing power was the main criterion. These results indicated that her career was beginning to accelerate, and she negotiated a fee of $150,000 for her next film.

She became pregnant near the end of 1968, and she and Polanski moved to 10050 Cielo Drive in Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles on February 15, 1969. The house had previously been occupied by their friends Terry Melcher and Candice Bergen. Tate and Polanski had visited it several times, and Tate was thrilled to learn that it was available, referring to it as her &quot;love house&quot;. At their new home, the Polanskis continued to be popular hosts for their large group of friends, although some of them still worried about the strange people who continued to show up at their parties. Tate was encouraged by the positive reviews of her comedic performances and chose the comedy &quot;The Thirteen Chairs&quot; (1969) as her next project, largely for the opportunity to co-star with Orson Welles. In March 1969, she traveled to Italy to begin filming, and Polanski went to London to work on &quot;The Day of the Dolphin&quot;.

Frykowski and Folger moved into the Cielo Drive house. After completing &quot;The Thirteen Chairs&quot;, Tate joined Polanski in London. She posed in their apartment for photographer Terry O&#x27;Neill in casual domestic scenes such as opening baby gifts, and she completed a series of glamor photographs for the British magazine &quot;Queen&quot;. She returned from London to Los Angeles on July 20, 1969, on the &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; (by this ship from Southampton, England to New York). Polanski was due to return on August 12 in time for the birth, and he had asked Frykowski and Folger to stay in the house with Tate until his return.

== Murder, funeral and trial==
On August 8, 1969, Tate entertained actress Joanna Pettet for lunch at her home, confiding in her disappointment at Polanski&#x27;s delay in returning from London. Polanski telephoned her that day. Her younger sister Debra also called, to ask if she, her boyfriend and another friend could pick up a saddle that Sharon had bought for Debra in Europe. Tate declined, offering to have them over another time. Later that evening, she reportedly dined at El Coyote Cafe with Jay Sebring, Wojciech Frykowski, and Abigail Folger, returning at about 10:30 p.m.

Shortly after midnight, Sebring, Frykowski, Folger, and Tate and her unborn son were murdered by members of the Manson Family cult. Tate was the last of the victims to die, despite her pleas that the Family take her with them so that she could give birth. Their bodies were discovered the following morning by Tate&#x27;s housekeeper Winifred Chapman. Police arrived at the scene to find a young man shot dead in his car in the driveway, later identified as Steven Parent. Inside the house, the bodies of Tate and Sebring were found hanged on a support beam in the living room; a long rope tied around each of their necks connected them. On the front lawn lay the bodies of Frykowski and Folger. All of the victims except Parent had been stabbed numerous times. The coroner&#x27;s report for Tate noted that she had been stabbed 16 times and that &quot;five of the wounds were in and of themselves fatal&quot;. In addition, the coroner&#x27;s inquest found that Tate was still alive when she was hanged with the rope, but she died immediately from a &quot;massive hemorrhage&quot;.

Police took the only survivor at the address – the property&#x27;s caretaker William Garretson – in for questioning. Garretson lived in the guest house that was located on the property a short distance from the house. He was questioned and submitted to a polygraph test and stated that Parent had visited him at approximately 11:30 p.m. and left shortly after. He told police that he had no involvement in the murders and did not know anything that could help the investigation, and he was subsequently released.
Polanski was informed of the murders and returned to Los Angeles where police questioned him about his wife and her friends. On Wednesday, August 13, Tate was interred in the Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City, California, with her son Paul Richard Polanski in her arms, named posthumously for his grandfathers. Sebring&#x27;s funeral took place later the same day; the funerals were scheduled several hours apart to allow mutual friends to attend both.

&quot;Life&quot; devoted a lengthy article to the murders and featured photographs of the crime scenes. Polanski was interviewed for the article and allowed himself to be photographed at the entrance of the house, next to the front door with the word &quot;PIG&quot; still visible, written in Tate&#x27;s blood. He was widely criticized for the photoshoot but he argued that he wanted to know who was responsible and was willing to shock the magazine&#x27;s readers in the hope that someone would come forward with information.

Curiosity about the victims led to the re-release of Tate&#x27;s films, which achieved greater popularity than they had in their initial runs. Some newspapers began to speculate about the motives for the murders. Some published photographs of Tate were alleged to be taken at a Satanic ritual, but were in fact production photographs from &quot;Eye of the Devil&quot;. Friends spoke out against the portrayal of Tate by some elements of the media. Mia Farrow said that she was as &quot;sweet and pure a human being as I have ever known&quot;, while Patty Duke remembered her as &quot;a gentle, gentle creature&quot;. Polanski tearfully berated a crowd of journalists at a news conference, asking them, &quot;Did you ever write how good she was?&quot;. Polanski said he began to suspect various friends and associates, and his paranoia subsided only when the killers were arrested. Newspapers claimed that many Hollywood stars were moving out of the city, while others installed security systems in their homes. Dominick Dunne recalled the tension:
The shock waves that went through the town were beyond anything I had ever seen before. People were convinced that the rich and famous of the community were in peril. Children were sent out of town. Guards were hired. Steve McQueen packed a gun when he went to Jay Sebring&#x27;s funeral.

In September 1969, members of the Manson &quot;Family&quot; were arrested on unrelated charges, eventually leading authorities to a breakthrough on the Tate case, as well. They explained that the motive for the murders was not the identity of the victims, but rather the house at that address, which had previously been rented to record producer Terry Melcher, an acquaintance of Manson. In 1994, the house was demolished and a new house was constructed on the site.

== Legacy ==
In the early 1980s, Stephen Kay, who had worked for the prosecution in the trial, became alarmed that Manson Family member Leslie Van Houten had gathered 900 signatures on a petition for her parole. He contacted Tate&#x27;s mother, Doris, who said that she was sure she could do better, and the two mounted a publicity campaign, collecting over 350,000 signatures supporting the denial of parole. Although Van Houten had been seen as the most likely of the killers to be paroled, her petition was denied after the efforts of Kay and Tate. Doris Tate became a vocal advocate for victims&#x27; rights and, in discussing her daughter&#x27;s murder and meeting other crime victims, assumed the role of counselor, using her profile to encourage public discussion and criticism of the corrections system.
For the rest of her life she strongly campaigned against the parole of each of the Manson killers and worked closely with other victims of violent crime. Several times she confronted Charles &quot;Tex&quot; Watson and Susan Atkins at parole hearings, explaining, &quot;I feel that Sharon has to be represented in that hearing room. If they&#x27;re [the killers] pleading for their lives then I have to be there representing her.&quot; She addressed Tex Watson directly during her victim impact statement in 1990: &quot;What mercy, sir, did you show my daughter when she was begging for her life? What mercy did you show my daughter when she said, &#x27;Give me two weeks to have my baby and then you can kill me&#x27;? ... When will Sharon come up for parole? Will these seven victims and possibly more walk out of their graves if you get paroled? You cannot be trusted.&quot;

In 1992 President George Bush recognized Doris Tate as one of his &quot;thousand points of light&quot; for her volunteer work on behalf of victims&#x27; rights. By this time Doris Tate had been diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor and her health and strength were failing; her meeting with Bush marked her final public appearance. When she died later that year her youngest daughter, Patricia Gay Tate, known as Patti, continued her work. She contributed to the 1993 foundation of the Doris Tate Crime Victims Bureau, a nonprofit organization that aims to influence crime legislation throughout the United States and to give greater rights and protection to victims of violent crime. In 1995, the Doris Tate Crime Victims Foundation was founded as a nonprofit organization to promote public awareness of the judicial system and to provide support to the victims of violent crime.

Patti Tate confronted David Geffen and board members of Geffen Records in 1993 over plans to include a song written by Charles Manson on the Guns N&#x27; Roses album &quot;&quot;The Spaghetti Incident?&quot;&quot; She commented to a journalist that the record company was &quot;putting Manson up on a pedestal for young people who don&#x27;t know who he is to worship like an idol&quot;.

After Patti&#x27;s death from breast cancer in 2000 her older sister Debra continued to represent the Tate family at parole hearings. Debra Tate said of the killers: &quot;They don&#x27;t show any personal responsibility. They haven&#x27;t made atonement to any one of my family members.&quot; She has also unsuccessfully lobbied for her sister to be awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Colonel Paul Tate preferred not to make public comments; however he was a constant presence during the murder trial and in the following years attended parole hearings with his wife and wrote letters to authorities in which he strongly opposed any suggestion of parole. He died in May 2005.
Roman Polanski gave away all of his possessions after the murders, unable to bear any reminders of the period that he called &quot;the happiest I ever was in my life&quot;. He remained in Los Angeles until the killers were arrested. His 1979 film &quot;Tess&quot; was dedicated &quot;to Sharon&quot;, as Tate had read Thomas Hardy&#x27;s &quot;Tess of the d&#x27;Urbervilles&quot; during her final stay with Polanski in London and had left it for him to read with the comment that it would be a good story for them to film together. He tried to explain his anguish after the murder of his wife and unborn son in his 1984 autobiography &quot;Roman by Polanski&quot;, saying, &quot;Since Sharon&#x27;s death, and despite appearances to the contrary, my enjoyment of life has been incomplete. In moments of unbearable personal tragedy some people find solace in religion. In my case the opposite happened. Any religious faith I had was shattered by Sharon&#x27;s murder. It reinforced my faith in the absurd.&quot;

In July 2005, Polanski successfully sued &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; magazine for libel after it alleged that he had tried to seduce a woman on his way to Tate&#x27;s funeral. Among the witnesses who testified on his behalf were Debra Tate and Mia Farrow. Describing Polanski immediately after Tate&#x27;s death, Farrow testified, &quot;Of this I can be sure — of his frame of mind when we were there, of what we talked about, of his utter sense of loss, of despair and bewilderment and shock and love — a love that he had lost.&quot; At the conclusion of the case, Polanski read a statement, saying in part, &quot;The memory of my late wife Sharon Tate was at the forefront of my mind in bringing this action.&quot;

The murders committed by the Manson &quot;Family&quot; have been described by social commentators as one of the defining moments of the 1960s. Joan Didion wrote, &quot;Many people I know in Los Angeles believe that the Sixties ended abruptly on August 9, 1969, ended at the exact moment when word of the murders on Cielo Drive traveled like brushfire through the community, and in a sense this is true. The tension broke that day. The paranoia was fulfilled.&quot;

Tate&#x27;s work as an actress has been reassessed since her death, with contemporary film writers and critics, such as Leonard Maltin, describing her potential as a comedian. A restored version of &quot;The Fearless Vampire Killers&quot; more closely resembles Polanski&#x27;s intention. Maltin lauded the film as &quot;near-brilliant&quot; and Tate&#x27;s work in &quot;Don&#x27;t Make Waves&quot; and &quot;The Wrecking Crew&quot; as her two best performances, as well as the best indicators of the career she might have established. &quot;Eye of the Devil&quot; with its supernatural themes, and &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot;, with its overstated melodrama, have each achieved a degree of cult status.

Tate&#x27;s biographer, Greg King, holds a view often expressed by members of the Tate family, writing in &quot;Sharon Tate and the Manson Murders&quot; (2000): &quot;Sharon&#x27;s real legacy lies not in her movies or in her television work. The very fact that, today, victims or their families in California are able to sit before those convicted of a crime and have a voice in the sentencing at trials or at parole hearings, is largely due to the work of Doris [and Patti] Tate. Their years of devotion to Sharon&#x27;s memory and dedication to victims&#x27; rights ... have helped transform Sharon from mere victim, [and] restore a human face to one of the twentieth century&#x27;s most infamous crimes.&quot;

In 2012, the book &quot;Restless Souls&quot; was published. Authored by Alisa Statman, a close friend of Patti Tate, two short chapters in the book are written by Sharon&#x27;s niece, Brie Taylor Ford, daughter of the late Patti Tate Ford. The book contains portions of the unfinished autobiographies of Sharon&#x27;s father, mother and sister Patti, along with Statman&#x27;s own &quot;personal interpretation[s]&quot;. Debra Tate has questioned the book&#x27;s veracity.

A coffee table book by Debra Tate, called &quot;Sharon Tate: Recollection&quot;, was released on June 10, 2014. It is the first book about Tate that is devoted exclusively to her life and career without covering her death, its aftermath, or the events that led to it.

In 2019, &quot;Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood&quot;, a Quentin Tarantino film, was released, partly portraying the life of Sharon Tate, played by Margot Robbie. The film provides a reimagining of the events leading to Tate&#x27;s death by the Mansons, which is prevented in the film due to the actions of other characters in the story.

== Character and public image ==
Tate had a habit of nail biting and going barefoot in public. When she went to restaurants with a &quot;No Shoes, No Service&quot; rule, she would frequently put rubber bands around her ankles to pretend that she was wearing sandals. Both these traits were featured in &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot;.

Tate had an interest in martial arts, and was a close friend and a student of Bruce Lee, who taught her Kung fu. Lee also helped her do martial-arts training for the American spy comedy film, &quot;The Wrecking Crew&quot;, in 1968.

==In popular culture==
In 2009, American contemporary artist Jeremy Corbell presented a comprehensive mixed media art exhibition titled &quot;ICON: Life Love &amp; Style of Sharon Tate&quot; in honor of the 40th anniversary of Tate&#x27;s death. With the blessing of the Tate family, Corbell created a 350-piece historic art exhibition celebrating Tate&#x27;s style and life. The art and fashion-based presentation showcased images of Tate&#x27;s never-before-revealed wardrobe by designers such as Christian Dior, Thea Porter, Ossie Clark and Yves Saint Laurent.

Tate has also been portrayed by multiple actresses in the decades since her death, mostly in projects that either reference, or are explicitly about, the Manson Family and the murders of 1969. Among the actresses who have played her are:
* Whitney Dylan in &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;, a 2004 television film based on the non-fiction book of the same name by Manson prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi and writer Curt Gentry.
* Amanda Brooks in &quot;Aquarius&quot;, a crime TV show set in the late 1960s, which aired for two seasons from 2015 to 2016.
* Katie Cassidy in the 2016 horror film &quot;Wolves at the Door&quot;, loosely based on the Manson Family&#x27;s murders.
* Rachel Roberts in the seventh season of &quot;American Horror Story&quot; in 2017.
* Grace Van Dien in the 2018 film &quot;Charlie Says&quot;.
* Hilary Duff in &quot;The Haunting of Sharon Tate&quot; in 2019.
* Margot Robbie in the 2019 film &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot;, directed by Quentin Tarantino, which is an alternative interpretation of the Manson murders. In this alternate timeline, Tate lives as her death is unintentionally prevented. Tate also appears as a character in Tarantino&#x27;s 2021 debut novel &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot;, an expansion of the story in his film of the same name.
In music, Tate has been mentioned in the opening lines of &quot;It&#x27;s Too Late&quot; by the Jim Carroll Band from their album &quot;Catholic Boy&quot; (1980) and the song &quot;Leaving It Up to You&quot; by artist John Cale from his album &quot;Helen of Troy&quot; (1975). She is also referenced by name in the poem &quot;In the Hills of Benedict Canyon&quot; by musician Lana Del Rey from her poetry collection &quot;Violet Bent Backwards over the Grass&quot; (2020).

<text>The Ionian Sea (, ; or , ; , ) is an elongated bay of the Mediterranean Sea. It is connected to the Adriatic Sea to the north, and is bounded by Southern Italy, including Basilicata, Calabria, Sicily, and the Salento peninsula to the west, southern Albania (and western Apulia, Italy) to the north, and the west coast of Greece, including the Peloponnese.

All major islands in the sea, which are located in the east of the sea, belong to Greece. They are collectively named the Ionian Islands, the main ones being Corfu, Kefalonia, Zakynthos, Lefkada, and Ithaca.

There are ferry routes between Patras and Igoumenitsa, Greece, and Brindisi and Ancona, Italy, that cross the east and north of the Ionian Sea, and from Piraeus westward. Calypso Deep, the deepest point in the Mediterranean at , is in the Ionian Sea, at . The sea is one of the most seismically active areas in the world.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Ionian&quot; comes from the Greek word . Its etymology is unknown. Ancient Greek writers, especially Aeschylus, linked it to the myth of Io. In ancient Greek the adjective &quot;Ionios&quot; () was used as an epithet for the sea because Io swam across it. According to the &quot;Oxford Classical Dictionary&quot;, the name may derive from Ionians who sailed to the West, however the word for Ionians is spelled with an omega ( Ἴωνες) rather than an omicron as in the word for the Ionian Sea. There were also narratives about other eponymic legendary figures; according to one version, &quot;Ionius&quot; was a son of &quot;Adrias&quot; (eponymic for the Adriatic Sea); according to another, &quot;Ionius&quot; was a son of &quot;Dyrrhachus&quot;. When Dyrrhachus was attacked by his own brothers, Heracles, who was passing through the area, came to his aid, but in the fight the hero killed his ally&#x27;s son by mistake. The body was cast into the water, and thereafter was called the Ionian Sea. 
Cham Albanians used to call the Ionian sea &quot;The Lady&#x27;s Domain&quot;.

::&quot;On the East.&quot; From the mouth of the Butrinto River in Albania down the coast of the mainland to Cape Matapan.

::&quot;On the South.&quot; A line from Cape Matapan to Cape Passero, the Southern point of Sicily.

::&quot;On the West.&quot; The East coast of Sicily and the Southeast coast of Italy to Cape Santa Maria di Leuca.

==History==

The Ionian Sea was regularly crossed since at least the 8th century BC, by ancient Greek colonizers who were establishing colonies in Italy.

During the Roman period, the Sea was the location of the famous naval battle between Octavian and Marc Antony known as The Battle of Actium, a war fought in 31 BC. 

It is also famous for the hero from Ancient Greek mythology named Odysseus, who was from the island of Ithaca.

<text>The Bulgars (also Bulghars, Bulgari, Bolgars, Bolghars, Bolgari, Proto-Bulgarians) were Turkic semi-nomadic warrior tribes that flourished in the Pontic–Caspian steppe and the Volga region between the 5th and 7th centuries. They became known as nomadic equestrians in the Volga-Ural region, but some researchers trace Bulgar ethnic roots to Central Asia.

During their westward migration across the Eurasian Steppe, the Bulgar tribes absorbed other tribal groups and cultural influences in a process of ethnogenesis, including Iranic, Finno-Ugric, and Hunnic tribes. The Bulgars spoke a Turkic language, the Bulgar language of the Oghuric branch. They preserved the military titles, organization, and customs of Eurasian steppes as well as pagan shamanism and belief in the sky deity Tangra.

The Bulgars became semi-sedentary during the 7th century in the Pontic-Caspian steppe, establishing the polity of Old Great Bulgaria c. 630–635, which was defeated by the Khazar Khaganate in 668 AD. In 681, Khan Asparukh conquered Scythia Minor, opening access to Moesia, and established the Danubian Bulgaria – the First Bulgarian Empire, where the Bulgars became a political and military elite. They merged subsequently with established Byzantine populations, as well as with previously settled Slavic tribes, and were eventually Slavicized, thus becoming one of the ancestors of modern Bulgarians.

The remaining Pontic Bulgars migrated in the 7th century to the Volga River, where they founded Volga Bulgaria; they preserved their identity well into the 13th century. The modern Volga Tatars, Bashkirs and Chuvash people claim to have originated from the Volga Bulgars.

== Etymology and origin ==
The etymology of the ethnonym &quot;&quot; is not completely understood and difficult to trace back earlier than the 4th century AD. Since the work of Tomaschek (1873), it is generally said to be derived from Proto-Turkic root *&quot;&quot; (&quot;to stir&quot;, &quot;to mix&quot;; &quot;to become mixed&quot;), which with the consonant suffix &quot;-r&quot; implies a noun meaning &quot;mixed&quot;. 
Other scholars have added that &quot;bulğa&quot; might also imply &quot;stir&quot;, &quot;disturb&quot;, &quot;confuse&quot; and Talat Tekin interpreted &quot;Bulgar&quot; as the verb form &quot;mixing&quot; (i.e. rather than the adjective &quot;mixed&quot;). Both Gyula Németh and Peter Benjamin Golden initially advocated the &quot;mixed race&quot; theory, but later, like Paul Pelliot, considered that &quot;to incite&quot;, &quot;rebel&quot;, or &quot;to produce a state of disorder&quot;, i.e. the &quot;disturbers&quot;, was a more likely etymology for migrating nomads.

According to Osman Karatay, if the &quot;mixed&quot; etymology relied on the westward migration of the Oğurs, meeting and merging with the Huns, north of the Black Sea, it was a faulty theory, since the Oghurs were documented in Europe as early as 463, while the Bulgars were not mentioned until 482 – an overly short time period for any such ethnogenesis to occur.

However, the &quot;mixing&quot; in question may have occurred before the Bulgars migrated from further east, and scholars such as Sanping Chen have noted analogous groups in Inner Asia, with phonologically similar names, who were frequently described in similar terms: during the 4th century, the &quot;Buluoji&quot; (Middle Chinese &quot;b&#x27;uo-lak-kiei&quot;), a component of the &quot;Five Barbarian&quot; groups in Ancient China, were portrayed as both a &quot;mixed race&quot; and &quot;troublemakers&quot;. Peter A. Boodberg noted that the &quot;Buluoji&quot; in the Chinese sources were recorded as remnants of the Xiongnu confederation, and had strong Caucasian elements.

Another theory linking the Bulgars to a Turkic people of Inner Asia has been put forward by Boris Simeonov, who identified them with the &quot;Pugu&quot; (僕骨; &quot;buk/buok kwət&quot;; &quot;Buqut&quot;), a Tiele and/or Toquz Oguz tribe. The Pugu were mentioned in Chinese sources from 103 BC up to the 8th century AD, and later were situated among the eastern Tiele tribes, as one of the highest-ranking tribes after the Uyghurs.

According to the &quot;Chronicle&quot; by Michael the Syrian, which comprises several historical events of different age into one story, three mythical Scythian brothers set out on a journey from the mountain Imaon (Tian Shan) in Asia and reached the river Tanais (Don), the country of the Alans called Barsalia, which would be later inhabited by the Bulgars and the Pugurs (&quot;Puguraje&quot;).

The names Onoğur and Bulgar were linked by later Byzantine sources for reasons that are unclear.Tekin derived &quot;-gur&quot; from the Altaic suffix &quot;-gir&quot;. Generally, modern scholars consider the terms &quot;oğuz&quot; or &quot;oğur&quot;, as generic terms for Turkic tribal confederations, to be derived from Turkic &quot;*og/uq&quot;, meaning &quot;kinship or being akin to&quot;. The terms initially were not the same, as &quot;oq/ogsiz&quot; meant &quot;arrow&quot;, while &quot;oğul&quot; meant &quot;offspring, child, son&quot;, &quot;oğuš/uğuš&quot; was &quot;tribe, clan&quot;, and the verb &quot;oğša-/oqša&quot; meant &quot;to be like, resemble&quot;.

There also appears to be an etymological association between the Bulgars and the preceding Kutrigur (&quot;Kuturgur&quot; &gt; &quot;Quturğur&quot; &gt; &quot;*Toqur(o)ğur&quot; &lt; &quot;toqur&quot;; &quot;nine&quot; in Proto-Bulgar; &quot;toquz&quot; in Common Turkic) and Utigur (&quot;Uturgur&quot; &gt; &quot;Uturğur&quot; &lt; &quot;utur/otur&quot;; &quot;thirty&quot; in Proto-Bulgar; &quot;otuz&quot; in Common Turkic) – as &quot;&#x27;Oğur&quot; (Oghur) tribes, with the ethnonym Bulgar as a &quot;spreading&quot; adjective. Golden considered the origin of the Kutrigurs and Utigurs to be obscure and their relationship to the Onogurs and Bulgars – who lived in similar areas at the same time – as unclear.

He noted, however, an implication that the Kutrigurs and Utigurs were related to the Šarağurs (&quot;šara oğur&quot;, &quot;shara oghur&quot;; &quot;white oğhurs&quot;), and that according to Procopius these were Hunnish tribal unions, of partly Cimmerian descent. Karatay considered the Kutrigurs and Utigurs to be two related, ancestral people, and prominent tribes in the later Bulgar union, but different from the Bulgars.

Among many other theories regarding the etymology of Bulgar, the following have also had limited support.

* an Eastern Germanic root meaning &quot;combative&quot; (i.e. cognate with the Latin &quot;pugnax&quot;), according to D. Detschev;
* the Latin &quot;burgaroi&quot; – a Roman term mercenaries stationed in &quot;burgi&quot; (&quot;forts&quot;) on the &quot;limes&quot; (G. A. Keramopulos);
* a reconstructed but unattested early Turkic term meaning &quot;five oğhur&quot;, such as &quot;*bel-gur&quot; or &quot;*bil-gur&quot; (Zeki Velidi Togan).

== History ==
=== Turkic migration ===

 The original homeland of the early Bulgars is still unclear. Their homeland is believed to be situated in Kazakhstan and the North Caucasian steppes. Interaction with the Hunnic tribes, causing the migration, may have occurred there, but the Pontic–Caspian steppe seems a more likely location. Some scholars propose that the Bulgars may have been a branch or offshoot of the Huns or at least Huns seem to have been absorbed by the Onogur-Bulgars after Dengizich&#x27;s death. Hyun Jin Kim however, argues that the Huns continued under Ernak, becoming the Kutrigur and Utigur Hunno-Bulgars. These conclusions remain a topic of ongoing debate and controversy among scholars.

The first clear mention and evidence of the Bulgars was in 480, when they served as the allies of the Byzantine Emperor Zeno (474–491) against the Ostrogoths. Anachronistic references about them can also be found in the 7th-century geography work &quot;Ashkharatsuyts&quot; by Anania Shirakatsi, where the &quot;Kup&#x27;i Bulgar&quot;, &quot;Duch&#x27;i Bulkar&quot;, &quot;Olkhontor Błkar&quot; and immigrant &quot;Ch&#x27;dar Bulkar&quot; tribes are mentioned as being in the North Caucasian-Kuban steppes. An obscure reference to &quot;Ziezi ex quo Vulgares&quot;, with Ziezi being an offspring of Biblical Shem, is in the &quot;Chronography of 354&quot;.

The Armenian history of Movses Khorenatsi (5th century or later) speaks about two migrations of the Bulgars from the Caucasus to Armenia. The first migration is mentioned in association with the campaign of Armenian ruler Valarshak to the lands &quot;named Basen by the ancients... and which were afterwards populated by immigrants of the Vlendur Bulgar Vund, after whose name they (the lands) were named Vanand&quot;. In fact, the name Vanand is attested prior to the appearance of the Bulgars. Grigor Khalatians and Josef Markwart connected the name &quot;Vlendur&quot; with the &quot;Olkhontor&quot; mentioned in the &quot;Ashkharatsuyts&quot;, while Stepan Malkhasiants considered it a form of the Mongolian word &quot;baghatur&quot; &#x27;hero&#x27;.

The second migration took place during the time of the ruler Arshak, when &quot;great disturbances occurred in the range of the great Caucasus mountain, in the land of the Bulgars, many of whom migrated and came to our lands and settled south of Kokh&quot;. While Khorenatsi discusses these migrations in the context of the 2nd century BC, it has been suggested that Khorenatsi confused events from the second half of the 4th century AD with earlier occurrences; thus, the migration may have occurred during the reign of King Arshak III of Armenia. The &quot;disturbances&quot; which caused them are believed to be the expansion of the Huns in the East European steppes. Dimitrov recorded that the toponyms of the Bolha and Vorotan rivers, tributaries of the Aras river, are known as &quot;Bolgaru-chaj&quot; and &quot;Vanand-chaj&quot;, and could confirm the Bulgar settlement of Armenia.

Around 463 AD, the Akatziroi and other tribes that had been part of the Hunnic union were attacked by the Šarağurs, one of the first Oğuric Turkic tribes that entered the Ponto-Caspian steppes as the result of migrations set off in Inner Asia. According to Priscus, in 463 the representatives of Šarağur, Oğur and Onoğur came to the Emperor in Constantinople, and explained they had been driven out of their homeland by the Sabirs, who had been attacked by the Avars. This tangle of events indicates that the Oğuric tribes are related to the Ting-ling and Tiele people. It seems that Kutrigurs and Unigurs arrived with the initial waves of Oğuric peoples entering the Pontic steppes. The Bulgars were not mentioned in 463.

The account by Paul the Deacon in his &quot;History of the Lombards&quot; (8th century) says that at the beginning of the 5th century in the North-Western slopes of the Carpathians the &quot;Vulgares&quot; killed the Lombard king Agelmund. Scholars attribute this account to the Huns, Avars or some Bulgar groups who were probably carried away by the Huns to the Central Europe. The Lombards, led by their new king Laimicho, rose up and defeated the Bulgars with great slaughter, gaining great booty and confidence as they &quot;became bolder in undertaking the toils of war.&quot;

The defeated Bulgars then became subjects of the Lombards and later migrated in Italy with their king Alboin. When the army of Ostrogoth chieftain Theodoric Strabo grew to 30,000-men strong, it was felt as a menace to Byzantine Emperor Zeno, who somehow managed to convince the Bulgars to attack the Thracian Goths. The Bulgars were eventually defeated by Strabo in 480/481. In 486 and 488 they fought against the Goths again, first as allies of Byzantium, according to Magnus Felix Ennodius, and later as allies of the Gepids, according to Paul the Deacon. However, when Theoderic the Great with his Ostrogoths departed for Italy in 489, the Illyricum and Thrace were open for Bulgar raids.

In 493, according to Marcellinus Comes, they defeated and killed magister militum Julian. In 499, they crossed the Danube and reached Thrace where on the banks of the river Tzurta (considered a tributary of Maritsa) defeated a 15,000-strong Roman army led by magister militum Aristus. In 502, Bulgars again devastated Thrace as reportedly there were no Roman soldiers to oppose them. In 528–529 they again invaded the region and defeated Roman generals Justin and Baduarius. However, the Gothic general Mundus offered allegiance to Emperor Justinian I (527–565) in 530, and managed to kill 5,000 Bulgars plundering Thrace. John Malalas recorded that in the battle a Bulgar warlord was captured. In 535, magister militum Sittas defeated the Bulgar army at the river Yantra.

Ennodius, Jordanes and Procopius identified the Bulgars with the Huns in a 6th-century literary topos, in which Ennodius referred to a captured Bulgar horse as &quot;equum Huniscum&quot;. In 505, the alleged 10,000 Hun horsemen in the Sabinian army, which was defeated by the Ostrogoths, are believed to be the Bulgars. In 515, Bulgar mercenaries were listed along with others from the Goths, Scythians and Hunnic tribes as part of the Vitalian army. In 539, two Hunnic &quot;kinglets&quot; defeated two Roman generals during the raid into Scythia Minor and Moesia.

A Roman army led by magister militum Ascum and Constantiolus intercepted and defeated them in Thrace; however, another raiding party ambushed and captured the two Roman generals. In 539 and 540, Procopius reported a powerful Hunnic army crossed the Danube, devastated Illyricum and reached up to the Anastasian Wall. Such large distances covered in a short time indicate they were horsemen.

Jordanes described, in his work &quot;Getica&quot; (551), the Pontic steppe beyond the Akatziri, above the Pontic Sea, as the habitat of the &quot;Bulgari&quot;, &quot;whom the evils of our sins have made famous&quot;. In this region, the &quot;Hunni&quot; divided into two tribes: the &quot;Altziagiri&quot; (who trade and live next to Cherson) and &quot;Saviri&quot;, while the &quot;Hunuguri&quot; (believed to be the Onoğurs) were notable for the marten skin trade. In the Middle Ages, marten skin was used as a substitute for minted money.

The Syriac translation of Pseudo-Zacharias Rhetor&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot; (c. 555) in Western Eurasia records:

The land Bazgun... extends up to the Caspian Gates and to the sea, which are in the Hunnish lands. Beyond the gates live the Burgars (Bulgars), who have their language, and are people pagan and barbarian. They have towns. And the Alans – they have five towns... Avnagur (Aunagur, considered Onoğurs) are people, who live in tents

Then he records 13 tribes, the &quot;wngwr&quot; (Onogur), &quot;wgr&quot; (Oğur), &quot;sbr&quot; (Sabir), &quot;bwrgr&quot; (Burğa, i.e. Bulgar), &quot;kwrtrgr&quot; (Kutriğurs), &quot;br&quot; (probably Vars, also known as the Avars), &quot;ksr&quot; (&quot;Kasr&quot;; possibly Akatziri), &quot;srwrgwr&quot; (Saragurs), &quot;dyrmr&quot; (unknown), &quot;b&#x27;grsyq&quot; (&quot;Bagrasir&quot;, i.e. Barsil), &quot;kwls&quot; (unknown), &quot;bdl&quot; (probably Abdali), and &quot;ftlyt&quot; (Hephthalite) ... They are described in typical phrases reserved for nomads in the ethnographic literature of the period, as people who &quot;live in tents, earn their living on the meat of livestock and fish, of wild animals and by their weapons (plunder)&quot;.

Agathias (c. 579–582) wrote:

...all of them are called in general Scythians and Huns in particular according to their nation. Thus, some are Koutrigours or Outigours and yet others are Oultizurs and Bourougounds... the Oultizurs and Bourougounds were known up to the time of the Emperor Leo (457–474) and the Romans of that time and appeared to have been strong. We, however, in this day, neither know them, nor, I think, will we. Perhaps, they have perished or perhaps they have moved off to very far place.

According to D. Dimitrov, scholars partially managed to identify and locate the Bulgar groups mentioned in the Armenian &quot;Ashkharatsuyts&quot;. The &quot;Olxontor Błkar&quot; is one of the variations used for the Onoğurs Bulgars, while others could be related to the ancient river names, such as the &quot;Kup&#x27;i Bulgar&quot; and the Kuban (Kuphis). The &quot;Duč&#x27;i&quot; could read &quot;Kuchi Bulkar&quot; and as such could be related to the Dnieper (Kocho). However, the &quot;Č&#x27;dar Bulkar&quot; location is unclear. Dimitrov theorized that the differences in the &quot;Bulgar&quot; ethnonym could be due to the dialect differentiations in their language.

By the middle of the 6th century, the Bulgars momentarily fade from the sources and the Kutrigurs and Utigurs come to the front. Between 548 and 576, mostly due to Justinian I (527–565), through diplomatic persuasion and bribery the Kutrigurs and Utigurs were drawn into mutual warfare, decimating one another. In the end, the Kutrigurs were overwhelmed by the Avars, while the Utigurs came under the rule of the Western Turks.

The Oğurs and Onoğurs, in the 6th- and 7th-century sources, were mentioned mostly in connection with the Avar and Turk conquest of Western Eurasia. From the 8th century, the Byzantine sources often mention the Onoğurs in close connection with the Bulgars. Agathon (early 8th century) wrote about the nation of Onoğurs Bulğars. Nikephoros I (early 9th century) noted that Kubrat was the lord of the &quot;Onoğundurs&quot;; his contemporary Theophanes referred to them as &quot;Onoğundur–Bulğars&quot;.

Constantine VII (mid-10th century) remarked that the Bulğars formerly called themselves &quot;Onoğundurs&quot;. This association was previously mirrored in Armenian sources, such as the &quot;Ashkharatsuyts&quot;, which refers to the &quot;Olxontor Błkar&quot;, and the 5th century &quot;History&quot; by Movses Khorenatsi, which includes an additional comment from a 9th-century writer about the colony of the Vłĕndur Bułkar. Marquart and Golden connected these forms with the &quot;Iġndr&quot; (*Uluġundur) of Ibn al-Kalbi (c. 820), the &quot;Vnndur&quot; (*Wunundur) of Hudud al-&#x27;Alam (982), the &quot;Wlndr&quot; (*Wulundur) of Al-Masudi (10th century) and Hungarian name for Belgrad &quot;Nándor Fejérvár&quot;, the &quot;nndr&quot; (*Nandur) of Gardīzī (11th century) and &quot;*Wununtur&quot; in the letter by the Khazar King Joseph. All the forms show the phonetic changes typical of later Oğuric (prothetic v-).

Scholars consider it unclear how this union came about, viewing it as a long process in which a number of different groups were merged. During that time, the Bulgars may have represented a large confederation including the remnants of Onoğurs, Utigurs and Kutrigurs among others.

=== Old Great Bulgaria ===

The Turk rule weakened sometime after 600, allowing the Avars to reestablish the control over the region. As the Western Turkic Khaganate declined, finally collapsing in the middle of the 7th century, it was against Avar rule that the Bulgars, recorded as &quot;Onoğundur–Bulğars&quot;, reappeared. They revolted under their leader Kubrat (c. 635), who seems to have been prepared by Heraclius (610–641) against the Sasanian–Avar alliance. With his uncle Organa in 619, Kubrat had been baptized in Constantinople. He founded the Old Great Bulgaria (&quot;Magna Bulgaria&quot;), also known as &quot;Onoğundur–Bulğars&quot; state, or &quot;Patria Onoguria&quot; in the &quot;Ravenna Cosmography&quot;.

Little is known about Kubrat&#x27;s activities. It is considered that Onogur Bulgars remained the only steppe tribes in good relations with the Byzantines. His date of death is placed between 650 and 663 AD. According to Nikephoros I, Kubrat instructed his five sons to &quot;never separate their place of dwelling from one another, so that by being in concordance with one another, their power might thrive&quot;.

Subsequent events proved Old Great Bulgaria to be only a loose tribal union, as there emerged a rivalry between the Khazars and the Bulgars over Turk patrimony and dominance in the Pontic–Caspian steppe. Some historians consider the war an extension of the Western Turks struggle, between the &quot;Nushibi&quot; tribes and Ashina clan, who led the Khazars, and the &quot;Duolu/Tu-lu&quot; tribes, which some scholars associated with the Dulo clan, from which Kubrat and many Bulgar rulers originated. The Khazars were ultimately victorious and parts of the Bulgar union broke up.

=== Subsequent migrations ===

It is unclear whether the brothers&#x27; parting ways was caused by the internal conflicts or strong Khazar pressure. The latter is considered more likely. The Bulgars led by the first two brothers Batbayan and Kotrag remained in the Pontic steppe zone, where they were known as &quot;Black Bulgars&quot; by Byzantine and Rus sources, and became Khazar vassals. The Bulgars led by Kotrag migrated to the middle Volga region during the 7th and 9th centuries, where they founded Volga Bulgaria, with Bolghar as its capital.

According to Ahmad ibn Rustah (10th century), the Volga Bulgars were divided into three branches: &quot;the first branch was called Bersula (Barsils), the second Esegel, and the third Bulgar&quot;. In 922 they accepted Islam as the official religion. They preserved their national identity well into the 13th century by repelling the first Mongol attacks in 1223. They were eventually subdued by the Mongols in 1237. They gradually lost their identity after 1431 when their towns and region were captured by the Russians.

The third and most famous son, Asparukh, according to Nikephoros I:

Asparukh, according to the &quot;Pseudo&quot;–Zacharias Rhetor, &quot;fled from the Khazars out of the Bulgarian mountains&quot;. In the Khazar ruler Joseph&#x27;s letter is recorded &quot;in the country in which I live, there formerly lived the Vununtur (&lt; Vunundur &lt; Onoğundur). Our ancestors, the Khazars warred with them. The Vununtur were more numerous, as numerous as the sand by the sea, but they could not withstand the Khazars. They left their country and fled... until they reached the river called Duna (Danube)&quot;.

This migration and the foundation of the Danube Bulgaria (the First Bulgarian Empire) is usually dated c. 681. The composition of the horde is unknown, and sources only mention tribal names Čakarar, Kubiar, Küriger, and clan names Dulo, Ukil/Vokil, Ermiyar, Ugain and Duar. The &quot;Onglos&quot; where Bulgars settled is considered northern Dobruja, secured to the West and North by Danube and its Delta, and bounded to the East by the Black Sea. They re-settled in North-Eastern Bulgaria, between Shumen and Varna, including Ludogorie plateau and southern Dobruja. The distribution of pre-Christian burial assemblages in Bulgaria and Romania is considered as the indication of the confines of the Bulgar settlement.In the Balkans they merged with the Slavs and other autochthonous Romance and Greek speaking population, like the Thracians and Vlachs, becoming a political and military elite. However, the influence of the pre-Slavic population had relatively little influence on the Slavs and Bulgars, indicating their population was reduced in previous centuries. The hinterlands of the Byzantine territory were for years occupied by many groups of Slavs. According to Theophanes, the Bulgars subjugated the so-called Seven Slavic tribes, of which the Severians were re-settled from the pass of Beregaba or Veregava, most likely the Rish Pass of the Balkan Mountains, to the East, while the other six tribes to the Southern and Western regions as far the boundary with the Pannonian Avars. Scholars consider that the absence of any source recording the Slavic resistance to the invasion was because it was in their interest to be liberated from the Byzantine taxation.

It is considered that the Slavic tribal organization was left intact, and paid tribute to the ruling Bulgars. According to Nikephoros I and Theophanes, an unnamed fourth brother, believed to be Kuber, &quot;having crossed the river Ister, resides in Pannonia, which is now under the sway of the Avars, having made an alliance with the local peoples&quot;. Kuber later led a revolt against the Avars and with his people moved as far as the region of Thessaloniki in Greek Macedonia. The fifth brother, reported by Nikephoros I and Theophanes, &quot;settling in the five Ravennate cities became a subject of the Romans&quot;. This brother is believed to be Alcek, who after a stay in Avar territory left and settled in Italy, in Sepino, Bojano and Isernia. These Bulgars preserved their speech and identity until the late 8th century.

The First Bulgarian Empire (681–1018) had a significant political influence in the Balkans. In the time of Tervel (700–721) the Bulgars helped Byzantines two times, in 705 the Emperor Justinian II to regain his throne, and 717–718 defeating the Arabs during the siege of Constantinople. Sevar (738–753) was the last ruler from the Dulo clan, and the period until c. 768–772 was characterized by the Byzantino-Bulgar conflict and internal crisis. In the short period followed seven rulers from the Uokil and Ugain clan. Telerig (768–777) managed to establish a pacific policy with Byzantium, and restore imperial power.

During the reign of Krum (803–814), the Empire doubled its size, including new lands in Macedonia and Serbia. He also successfully repelled the invading force of the Byzantines, as well defeated the Pannonian Avars where additionally extended the Empire size. In 865, during the reign of Khan Boris I (852–889), the Bulgars accepted Christianity as the official religion, and Eastern Orthodoxy in 879. The greatest expansion of the Empire and prosperity during the time of Simeon I (893–927) is considered as the Bulgarian Golden Age. However, from the time of Peter I (927–969) their power declined. The Hungarians, Kievan Rus&#x27; Slavs, as well Pechenegs and Cumans held many raids into their territory, and so weakened were eventually conquered in 1018 by the Byzantine Empire.

== Society ==
Bulgars had the typical culture of the nomadic equestrians of Central Asia, who migrated seasonally in pursuit of good pastures, as well attraction to economic and cultural interaction with sedentary societies. Being in contact with sedentary cultures, they began mastering the crafts of blacksmithing, pottery, and carpentry. The politically dominant tribe or clan usually gave its name to the tribal confederation. Such confederations were often encouraged by the Imperial powers, for whom it was easier to deal with one ruler than several tribal chieftains.

In nomadic society the tribes were political organizations based on kinship, with diffused power. Tribes developed according to the relation with sedentary states, and only managed to conquer them when had social cohesion. If the raiding by the nomads had negative effect on the economic development of the region it could significantly slow down their own social and cultural development. In a nomadic state the nomad and sedentary integration was limited, and usually had vassal tribute system.

When the Bulgars arrived in the Balkans their first generations probably still lived a nomadic life in yurts, but they quickly adopted the sunken-featured building of rectangular plan and sedentary or seasonal lifestyle of the Slavs and autochthonous population. The Bulgar and Slavic settlements cannot be distinguished other than by the type of biritual cemeteries.

=== Social structure ===

The Bulgars, at least the Danubian Bulgars, had a well-developed clan and military administrative system of &quot;inner&quot; and &quot;outer&quot; tribes, governed by the ruling clan. They had many titles, and according to Steven Runciman the distinction between titles which represented offices and mere ornamental dignities was somewhat vague. Maenchen-Helfen theorized that the titles of the steppe peoples did not reflect the ethnicity of their bearers. According to Magnus Felix Ennodius, the Bulgars did not have nobility, yet their leaders and common men became noblemen on the battle field, indicating social mobility.

Tribute-paying sedentary vassals, such as the Slavs and Greek-speaking population, formed a substantial and important part of the &quot;khanate&quot;&#x27;s maintenance.

Although it was not recorded on inscriptions, the title &quot;sampses&quot; is considered to be related to the royal court. The title &quot;tabare&quot; or &quot;iltabare&quot;, which derives from the old Turkish &quot;ältäbär&quot;, like &quot;sampses&quot; is not mentioned on inscriptions, but is related to the legates and ambassadors.

The Anastasius Bibliothecarius listed Bulgarian legates at the Council at Constantinople in 869–870. They were mentioned as Stasis, Cerbula, Sundica (&quot;vagantur&quot;=&quot;bagatur&quot;), Vestranna (&quot;iltabare&quot;), Praestizisunas (&quot;campsis&quot;), and Alexius Hunno (&quot;sampsi&quot;). The ruler title in Bulgar inscriptions was &quot;khan&quot; or &quot;kanasubigi&quot;. A counterpart of the Greek phrase (&quot;ho ek Theou archon&quot;) was also common in Bulgar inscriptions. The &quot;kavhan&quot; was the second most important title in the realm, seemingly chief official. Some Bulgar inscriptions, written in Greek and later in Slavonic, refer to the Bulgarian rulers respectively with the Greek title &quot;archon&quot;, or the Slavic titles &quot;knyaz&quot; and &quot;tsar&quot;.

There are several possible interpretations for the ruler title, &quot;kana sybigi&quot;, mentioned in six inscriptions by the Khan Omurtag and two by Malamir. Among the proposed translations for &quot;sybigi&quot; or &quot;subigi&quot; are &quot;lord of the army&quot;, from the reconstructed Turkic phrase &quot;syu-beg&quot; (army master) paralleling the attested Orkhon Turkic &quot;syubashi&quot;. Runciman and J. B. Bury considered &quot;ubige&quot; or &quot;uvege&quot; to be related to the Cuman-Turkic &quot;öweghü&quot; (high, glorious); &quot;bright, luminous, heavenly&quot;; and more recently &quot;(ruler) from God&quot;, from the Indo-European &quot;*su-&quot; and &quot;baga-&quot;, i.e. &quot;*su-baga&quot;. Florin Curta noted the resemblance in the use of the &quot;kana sybigi&quot; with the Byzantine name and title &quot;basileus&quot;.Members of the upper social class bore the title &quot;boila&quot; (later &quot;boyar&quot;). The nobility was divided onto &quot;small&quot; and &quot;great&quot; boilas. In the 10th century, there were three classes of boyars: the six &quot;great&quot; boilas, the &quot;outer&quot; boilas, and the &quot;inner&quot; boilas, while in the mid-9th century there were twelve &quot;great&quot; boyars. The &quot;great&quot; boilas occupied military and administrative offices in the state, as well the council where they gathered for decisions on important matters of state.
&quot;Bagaïns&quot; were the lesser class of the nobility, probably a military class which also participated in the council. The title &quot;bagatur&quot;, once as &quot;bogotor&quot;, is found in several instances within the inscriptions. It derives from Turkish &quot;bagadur&quot; (hero) and was a high military rank. The Bulgarian military commander who was defeated by the Croats in the Battle of the Bosnian Highlands (926) was called Alogobotur, which is actually a title comprised by &quot;alo&quot; (considered Turkic &quot;alp, alyp&quot;; chief) and &quot;bagatur&quot;.

There are several title associations with uncertain meaning, such as &quot;boila kavkhan&quot;, &quot;ičirgu boila&quot;, &quot;kana boila qolovur&quot;, &quot;bagatur bagain&quot;, &quot;biri bagain&quot;, &quot;setit bagain&quot; and &quot;ik bagain&quot;. &quot;Kolober&quot; (or &quot;qolovur&quot;), a rank title, is cited in two inscriptions, and it derives from the Turkish term for a guide, &quot;golaghuz&quot;. The title &quot;župan&quot;, also once as &quot;kopan&quot; in the inscriptions, was often mentioned together with the bearer&#x27;s name. They were traditionally seen as Slavic chiefs. It seems to have meant &quot;head of a clan-district&quot;, as among the South Slavs (Croats, Serbs) where it was more widely used, it meant &quot;head of a tribe&quot; with a high district and court function.

The title &quot;tarkhan&quot; probably represented a high military rank, similar to the Byzantine &quot;strategos&quot;, of the military governor of a province. The variations &quot;kalutarkan&quot; and &quot;buliastarkan&quot; are considered to be officers at the head of the &quot;tarkans&quot;. Curta interpreted the title &quot;zhupan tarqan&quot; as &quot;tarqan of (all the) zhupans&quot;.

=== Religion ===
Very little is known about the religion of the Bulgars, but it is believed to have been monotheistic.

In Danube Bulgaria, Bulgar monarchs described themselves as a &quot;ruler from God&quot;, indicating authority from a singular divine origin, and making appeals to the deity&#x27;s omniscience. Presian&#x27;s inscription from Philippi (837) states:

It is traditionally assumed that the God in question was the Turkic supreme sky deity, Tengri. In the Chinese transcription as &quot;zhenli&quot;, and Turkic as &quot;Tangara&quot; and &quot;Tengeri&quot;, it represents the oldest known Turco-Mongolian word. Tengri may have originated in the Xiongnu confederacy, which settled on the frontiers of China in the 2nd century BC. The confederacy probably had both pre-Turkic and pre-Mongolian ethnic elements. In modern Turkish, the word for god, &quot;Tanrı&quot;, derives from the same root.

Tengrism apparently engaged various shamanic practices. According to Mercia MacDermott, Tangra was the male deity connected with sky, light and the Sun. The cult incorporated Tangra&#x27;s female equivalent and principle goddess, Umay, the deity of fertility. Their tamgha 
, which can be frequently found in early medieval Bulgaria is associated with deity Tangra. However, its exact meaning and use remains unknown. The most sacred creatures to Tangra were horses and eagles, particularly white horses. Bronze amulets with representations of the Sun, horses and other animals were found at Bulgar archeological sites. This could explain the variety of Bulgars taboos, including those about animals.

Ravil Bukharaev believed that such an autocratic and monotheistic religionhenotheism, as seen in the report by Ahmad ibn Fadlan (10th century) about the Oghuz Turks, kindred to the Bulgars, made the acceptance of Islam more natural and easier in Volga Bulgaria:

 Another mention of Tengri is on the severely damaged Greek inscription found on a presumed altar stone near Madara, tentatively deciphered as &quot;Khan &quot;sybigi&quot; Omurtag, ruler from god...was...and made sacrifice to god Tangra...&quot;itchurgu boila&quot;...gold&quot;. An Ottoman manuscript recorded that the name of God, in Bulgarian, was &quot;Tängri&quot;.

A piece of ethnographic evidence which has been invoked to support the belief that the Bulgars worshipped Tengri/Tangra is the relative similarity of the name &quot;Tengri&quot; to &quot;Tură&quot;, the name of the supreme deity of the traditional religion of the Chuvash people, who are traditionally regarded as descendants of the Volga Bulgars. Nevertheless, the Chuvash religion today is markedly different from Tengrism and can be described as a local form of polytheism, due to pagan beliefs of the Volga Finns, forest dwellers of Finno-Ugric origin who lived in their vicinity, with some elements borrowed from Islam.

Paganism was closely connected with the old clan system, and the remains of totemism and shamanism were preserved even after the crossing of Danube. The Shumen plate in the archaeological literature is often associated with shamanism. In the 9th century, it was recorded that before a battle the Bulgars &quot;used to practice enchantments and jests and charms and certain auguries&quot;. Liutprand of Cremona reported that Baian, son of Simeon I (893–927), could through &quot;magicam&quot; transform into a wolf. Clement of Ohrid reported the worship of fire and water by the Bulgars, while in the 11th century Theophylact of Ohrid remembered that before the Christianization the Bulgars respected the Sun, Moon and the stars, and sacrificed dogs to them.

Allegedly, the Dulo clan had the dog as its sacred animal. To this today Bulgarians still use the expression &quot;he kills the dog&quot; to mean &quot;he gives the orders&quot;, a relic of the time when the Dulo Khan sacrificed a dog to the deity Tangra. Remains of dog and deer have been found in Bulgars graves, and it seems the wolf also had a special mythological significance. The Bulgars were bi-ritual, either cremating or burying their dead, and often interred them with personal objects (pottery, rarely weapons or dress), food, and sacred animals.

Because of the cult of the Sun, the Bulgars had a preference for the south. Their main buildings and shrines faced south, as well their yurts, which were usually entered from the south, although less often from the east. Excavations showed that Bulgars buried their dead on a north–south axis, with their heads to the north so that the deceased &quot;faced&quot; south. The Slavs practiced only cremation, the remains were placed in urns, and like the Bulgars, with the conversion to Christianity inhumed the dead on west–east axis. The only example of a mixed Bulgar-Slavic cemetery is in Istria near ancient Histria, on the coast of the Black Sea.

D. Dimitrov has argued that the Kuban Bulgars also adopted elements of Iranian religious beliefs. He noticed Iranian influences on the cult of the former Caucasian Huns capital Varachan (Balanjar), making a religious syncretism between the principal Turkic deity Tengri and the Iranian sun god Hvare. Dimitrov cited the work by V.A. Kuznetsov, who considered the resemblance between the layout of the Zoroastrian temples of fire and the Kuban Bulgar centre, Humarin citadel, situated 11 km to the north of the town Karachayevsk, where the pottery belonged to the Saltovo-Mayaki culture.

Kuznecov also found a connection in the plan of the Danube Bulgars sanctuaries at Pliska, Veliki Preslav, and Madara. The architectural similarities include two squares of ashlars inserted one into another, oriented towards the summer sunrise. One of these sites was transformed into a Christian church, which is taken as evidence that they served a religious function.

The view of the Parthian and Sasanian influence, which Franz Altheim also argued, is considered debatable, showing the cultural impact of the Iranian world on communities in the Pontic–Caspian steppe. Many scholars believe that the square shape, with the north–south and east–west axis of the Bulgar sacral monuments is very similar to those of Turkic khagans in Mongolia. However, that the Bulgar residence in Pliska and Palace of Omurtag were inspired by the Byzantine architecture is considered indisputable.

Christianity had already begun to penetrate, probably via their Slavic subjects, when it was adopted in the First Bulgarian Empire by Knyaz Boris I in 865 as a state religion. There was interest in Islam as well, seen in the book &quot;Answers to the Questions of the King of the Burgar addressed to him about Islam and Unity&quot; by the Abbasid caliph Al-Ma&#x27;mun (813–833) for the Pontic/Bosporan Bulgars, while it was officially adopted in Volga Bulgaria as a state religion in 922.

== Language ==

The origin and language of the Bulgars has been the subject of debate since around the start of the 20th century. It is generally accepted that at least the Bulgar elite spoke a language that was a member of the Oghur branch of the Turkic language family, alongside the now extinct Khazar and the solitary survivor of these languages, Chuvash.

Although there is no direct evidence, a group of linguists believe that Chuvash may be descendant from a dialect of Volga Bulgar while others support the idea that Chuvash is another distinct Oghur Turkic language. Some scholars suggest Hunnish had strong ties with Bulgar and to modern Chuvash and refer to this extended grouping as separate Hunno-Bulgar languages. However, such speculations are not based on proper linguistic evidence, since the language of the Huns is almost unknown except for a few attested words and personal names. Scholars generally consider Hunnish as unclassifiable.

According to P. Golden this association is apparent from the fragments of texts and isolated words and phrases preserved in inscriptions. In addition to language, their culture and state structure retain many Central Asian features. Military and hierarchical terms such as &quot;khan/qan&quot;, &quot;kanasubigi&quot;, &quot;qapağan&quot;, &quot;tarkan&quot;, &quot;bagatur&quot; and &quot;boila&quot; appear to be of Turkic origin. The Bulgar calendar within the &quot;Nominalia of the Bulgarian khans&quot; had a twelve-year animal cycle, similar to the one adopted by Turkic and Mongolic peoples from the Chinese, with animal names and numbers deciphered as Turkic. Tengri (in Bulgar &quot;Tangra/Tengre&quot;) was their supreme god.

Danubian Bulgar inscriptions were written mostly in Greek or Cyrillic characters, most commonly in Greek or Graeco-Bulgar, others in the Kuban alphabet which is a variant of Orkhon script. they apparently have a sacral meaning. Inscriptions sometimes included Slavic terms, thus allowing scholars to identify some of the Bulgar glosses. Altheim argued that the runes were brought into Europe from Central Asia by the Huns, and were an adapted version of the old Sogdian alphabet in the Hunnic/Oghur Turkic language. The custom of stone engravings are considered to have Iranic, Turkic and Roman parallels. The Madara Rider resembles work of the Sasanian rock relief tradition, but its actual masonry tradition and cultural source is unknown.

According to linguist and academician Albina G. Khayrullina-Valieva Bulgar language was the first fully proved Turkic language that came into direct contact with South Slavs. The Danubian Bulgars were unable to alter the predominantly Slavic character of Bulgaria, seen in the toponymy and names of the capitals Pliska and Preslav. They preserved their own native language and customs for about 200 years, but a bilingual period was recorded since the 9th century. Golden argued that Bulgar Turkic almost disappeared with the transition to Christianity and Slavicisation in the middle of the 9th century. When the ruling class abandoned its native language and adopted Slavic, according to Jean W. Sedlar, it was so complete that no trace of Turkic speech patterns remained in Old Slavic texts. The Bulgarian Christian Church used the Slavic dialect from Macedonia.

Among Bulgarian academics, notably Petar Dobrev, a hypothesis linking the Bulgar language to the Iranic languages (especially Pamir) has been popular since the 1990s. Most proponents still assume an intermediate stance, proposing certain signs of Iranic influence on a Turkic substrate. The names Asparukh and Bezmer from the &quot;Nominalia&quot; list, for example, were established as being of Iranic origin. Other Bulgarian scholars actively oppose the &quot;Iranic hypothesis&quot;. According to Raymond Detrez, the Iranian theory is rooted in the periods of anti-Turkish sentiment in Bulgaria and is ideologically motivated. Since 1989, anti-Turkish rhetoric is now reflected in the theories that challenge the thesis of the proto-Bulgars&#x27; Turkic origin. Alongside the Iranian or Aryan theory, there appeared arguments favoring an autochthonous origin.

== Ethnicity ==
Due to the lack of definitive evidence, modern scholarship uses an ethnogenesis approach in explaining the Bulgars origin. More recent theories view the nomadic confederacies, such as the Bulgars, as the formation of several different cultural, political and linguistic entities that could dissolve as quickly as they formed, entailing a process of ethnogenesis.

According to Walter Pohl, the existential fate of the tribes and their confederations depended on their ability to adapt to an environment going through rapid changes, and to give this adaptation a credible meaning rooted in tradition and ritual. Slavs and Bulgars succeeded because their form of organization proved as stable and as flexible as necessary, while the Pannonian Avars failed in the end because their model could not respond to new conditions. Pohl wrote that members of society&#x27;s lower strata did not feel themselves to be part of any large-scale ethnic group; the only distinct classes were within the armies and the ruling elite.

Recent studies consider ethnonyms closely related with warrior elites who ruled over a variety of heterogeneous groups. The groups adopted new ideology and name as political designation, while the elites claimed right to rule and royal descent through origin myths.

When the Turkic tribes began to enter into the Pontic–Caspian steppe in the Post-Hunnic era, or as early as the 2nd century AD, their confederations incorporated an array of ethnic groups of newly joined Turkic, Caucasian, Iranian, and Finno-Ugric peoples. During their Western Eurasian migrations to the Balkans, they also came into contact with Armenian, Semitic, Slavic, Thracian and Anatolian Greek among other populations.

From the 6th to 8th centuries, distinctive Bulgar monuments of the Sivashovka type were built upon ruins of the late Sarmatian culture of the 2nd to 4th centuries AD, and the 6th century Penkovka culture of the Antes and Slavs. Early medieval Saltovo-Mayaki (an Alanic-based culture) settlements in the Crimea since the 8th century were destroyed by the Pechengs during the 10th century.

Although the older Iranian tribes were enveloped by the widespread Turkic migration into the Pontic–Caspian steppe, the following centuries saw a complete disappearance of both the Iranic and Turkic languages, indicating dominance of the Slavic language among the common people.

== Anthropology and genetics ==

According to a paleo-DNA study from 2019 which examined Medieval burials in the Carpathian Basin a closest connection was found between the Y-DNA of these nomadic people and the modern Volga Tatars. According to Hungarian archeogenetist Neparáczki Endre: &quot;From all recent and archaic populations tested the Volga Tatars show the smallest genetic distance to the entire Conqueror population&quot; and &quot;a direct genetic relation of the Conquerors to Onogur-Bulgar ancestors of these groups is very feasible.&quot;

The paleoanthropological material from all sites in Volga region, Ukraine and Moldova attributed to the Bulgars testify complex ethno-cultural processes. The material shows the assimilation between the local population and the migrating newcomers. In all sites can be traced the anthropological type found in the Zlivka necropolis near the village of Ilichevki, the district of Donetsk, of brachiocranic Caucasoid with small East Asian admixtures but with Bulgar males being more Mongoloid than females.

Modern genetic research on Central Asian Turkic peoples and ethnic groups related to the Bulgars points to an affiliation with Western Eurasian populations. Despite the morphological proximity, there is a visible impact of the local population, in the Volga region of Volga Finns and Cuman-Kipchaks, in Ukraine of Onogur-Khazars and Sarmatian-Alans, and in Moldova and Thrace of Seven Slavic tribes. The comparative analysis showed large morphological proximity between the medieval and modern population of the Volga region. The examined graves in Northern Bulgaria and Southern Romania showed different somatic types, including Caucasoid-Mediterranean and less often East Asian.

The pre-Christian burial customs in Bulgaria indicate diverse social, i.e. nomadic and sedentary, and cultural influences. In some necropolises specific to the Danube Bulgars, artificial deformation was found in 80% of the skulls. The Bulgars had a special type of shamanic &quot;medicine-men&quot; who performed trepanations of the skull, usually near the sagittal suture. This practice had a medical application, as well as a symbolic purpose; in two cases the patient had brain problems. According to Maenchen-Helfen and Rashev, the artificial deformation of skulls, and other types of burial artifacts in Bulgars graves, are similar to those of the Sarmatians, and Sarmatized Turks or Turkicized Sarmatians of the post-Hunnic graves in the Ukrainian steppe.

== Legacy ==
In modern ethnic nationalism there is some &quot;rivalry for the Bulgar legacy&quot; (see Bulgarism). The Volga Tatars, Bashkirs and Chuvash people, are said to be descended from the Volga Bulgars, and there may have been ethnogenetic influences on the Hungarians (Magyars) and Karachay-Balkars also.

The President of the Bulgar National Congress, Gusman Khalilov appealed to the European Court of Human Rights on the issue of renaming the Tatars into Bulgars, but in 2010 he lost in court.

<text>Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a condition characterized by large amounts of dilute urine and increased thirst. The amount of urine produced can be nearly 20 liters per day. Reduction of fluid has little effect on the concentration of the urine. Complications may include dehydration or seizures.
There are four types of DI, each with a different set of causes.

# Central DI (CDI), also known as &quot;arginine vasopressin deficiency&quot; (AVP-D), is due to a lack of vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone) production. This can be due to injury to the hypothalamus or pituitary gland or due to genetics.
# Nephrogenic DI (NDI), also known as &quot;arginine vasopressin resistance&quot; (AVP-R), occurs when the kidneys do not respond properly to vasopressin.
# Dipsogenic DI is a result of excessive fluid intake due to damage to the hypothalamic thirst mechanism. It occurs more often in those with certain psychiatric disorders or on certain medications.
# Gestational DI occurs only during pregnancy.

Diagnosis is often based on urine tests, blood tests and the fluid deprivation test. Despite the name, diabetes insipidus is unrelated to diabetes mellitus and the conditions have a distinct mechanism, though both can result in the production of large amounts of urine.
Treatment involves drinking sufficient fluids to prevent dehydration. Other treatments depend on the type. In central and gestational DI, treatment is with desmopressin. Nephrogenic DI may be treated by addressing the underlying cause or by the use of a thiazide, aspirin or ibuprofen. The number of new cases of diabetes insipidus each year is 3 in 100,000. Central DI usually starts between the ages of 10 and 20 and occurs in males and females equally. Nephrogenic DI can begin at any age. The term &quot;diabetes&quot; is derived from the Greek word meaning siphon.

==Signs and symptoms==
Excessive urination and extreme thirst and increased fluid intake (especially for cold water and sometimes ice or ice water) are typical for DI. The symptoms of excessive urination and extreme thirst are similar to what is seen in untreated diabetes mellitus, with the distinction that the urine does not contain glucose. Blurred vision is a rarity. Signs of dehydration may also appear in some individuals since the body cannot properly regulate the amount of the water it takes in.

Extreme urination continues throughout the day and the night. In children, DI can interfere with appetite, eating, weight gain and growth, as well. They may present with fever, vomiting or diarrhea. Adults with untreated DI may remain healthy for decades as long as enough water is consumed to offset the urinary losses. However, there is a continuous risk of dehydration and loss of potassium that may lead to hypokalemia.

==Cause==
The several forms of diabetes insipidus are:

===Central===
Central (or &quot;Neurogenic&quot;) DI has many possible causes. According to the literature, the principal causes of central DI and their oft-cited approximate frequencies are as follows:
* Idiopathic – 30% (including autoimmune, genetic, and familial forms)
* Malignant or benign tumors of the brain or pituitary – 25%
* Cranial surgery – 20%
* Head trauma – 16%

===Nephrogenic===

Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is due to the inability of the kidney to respond normally to vasopressin.

===Dipsogenic===
Dipsogenic DI or primary polydipsia results from excessive intake of fluids as opposed to deficiency of arginine vasopressin. It may be due to a defect or damage to the thirst mechanism, located in the hypothalamus, or due to mental illness. Treatment with desmopressin may lead to water intoxication.

===Gestational===
Gestational DI occurs only during pregnancy and the postpartum period. During pregnancy, women produce vasopressinase in the placenta, which breaks down antidiuretic hormone (ADH). Gestational DI is thought to occur with excessive production and/or impaired clearance of vasopressinase.

Most cases of gestational DI can be treated with desmopressin (DDAVP), but not vasopressin. In rare cases, however, an abnormality in the thirst mechanism causes gestational DI, and desmopressin should not be used.

Diabetes insipidus is also associated with some serious diseases of pregnancy, including pre-eclampsia, HELLP syndrome and acute fatty liver of pregnancy. These cause DI by impairing hepatic clearance of circulating vasopressinase.

==Pathophysiology==
Electrolyte and volume homeostasis is a complex mechanism that balances the body&#x27;s requirements for blood pressure and the main electrolytes sodium and potassium. In general, electrolyte regulation precedes volume regulation. When the volume is severely depleted, however, the body will retain water at the expense of deranging electrolyte levels.

The regulation of urine production occurs in the hypothalamus, which produces ADH in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei. After synthesis, the hormone is transported in neurosecretory granules down the axon of the hypothalamic neuron to the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland, where it is stored for later release. In addition, the hypothalamus regulates the sensation of thirst in the ventromedial nucleus by sensing increases in serum osmolarity and relaying this information to the cortex.

Neurogenic/central DI results from a lack of ADH; occasionally it can present with decreased thirst as regulation of thirst and ADH production occur in close proximity in the hypothalamus. It is encountered as a result of hypoxic encephalopathy, neurosurgery, autoimmunity or cancer, or sometimes without an underlying cause (idiopathic).

The main effector organ for fluid homeostasis is the kidney. ADH acts by increasing water permeability in the collecting ducts and distal convoluted tubules; specifically, it acts on proteins called aquaporins and more specifically aquaporin 2 in the following cascade. When released, ADH binds to V2 G-protein coupled receptors within the distal convoluted tubules, increasing cyclic AMP, which couples with protein kinase A, stimulating translocation of the aquaporin 2 channel stored in the cytoplasm of the distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts into the apical membrane. These transcribed channels allow water into the collecting duct cells. The increase in permeability allows for the reabsorption of water into the bloodstream, thus concentrating the urine.

Nephrogenic DI results from a lack of aquaporin channels in the distal collecting duct (decreased surface expression and transcription). It is seen in lithium toxicity, hypercalcemia, hypokalemia, or the release of ureteral obstruction. Therefore, a lack of ADH prevents water reabsorption and the osmolarity of the blood increases. With increased osmolarity, the osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus detect this change and stimulate thirst. With increased thirst, the person now experiences a polydipsia and polyuria cycle.

Hereditary forms of diabetes insipidus account for less than 10% of the cases of diabetes insipidus seen in clinical practice.

==Diagnosis==
To distinguish DI from other causes of excess urination, blood glucose levels, bicarbonate levels, and calcium levels need to be tested. Measurement of blood electrolytes can reveal a high sodium level (hypernatremia as dehydration develops). Urinalysis demonstrates a dilute urine with a low specific gravity. Urine osmolarity and electrolyte levels are typically low.

A fluid deprivation test is another way of distinguishing DI from other causes of excessive urination. If there is no change in fluid loss, giving desmopressin can determine if DI is caused by:
# a defect in ADH production
# a defect in the kidneys&#x27; response to ADH

This test measures the changes in body weight, urine output, and urine composition when fluids are withheld to induce dehydration. The body&#x27;s normal response to dehydration is to conserve water by concentrating the urine. Those with DI continue to urinate large amounts of dilute urine in spite of water deprivation. In primary polydipsia, the urine osmolality should increase and stabilize at above 280 mOsm/kg with fluid restriction, while a stabilization at a lower level indicates diabetes insipidus. Stabilization in this test means, more specifically, when the increase in urine osmolality is less than 30 Osm/kg per hour for at least three hours. Sometimes measuring blood levels of ADH toward the end of this test is also necessary, but is more time-consuming to perform.

To distinguish between the main forms, desmopressin stimulation is also used; desmopressin can be taken by injection, a nasal spray, or a tablet. While taking desmopressin, a person should drink fluids or water only when thirsty and not at other times, as this can lead to sudden fluid accumulation in the central nervous system. If desmopressin reduces urine output and increases urine osmolarity, the hypothalamic production of ADH is deficient, and the kidney responds normally to exogenous vasopressin (desmopressin). If the DI is due to kidney pathology, desmopressin does not change either urine output or osmolarity (since the endogenous vasopressin levels are already high).

Whilst diabetes insipidus usually occurs with polydipsia, it can also rarely occur not only in the absence of polydipsia but in the presence of its opposite, adipsia (or hypodipsia). &quot;Adipsic diabetes insipidus&quot; is recognised as a marked absence of thirst even in response to hyperosmolality. In some cases of adipsic DI, the person may also fail to respond to desmopressin.

If central DI is suspected, testing of other hormones of the pituitary, as well as magnetic resonance imaging, particularly a pituitary MRI, is necessary to discover if a disease process (such as a prolactinoma, or histiocytosis, syphilis, tuberculosis or other tumor or granuloma) is affecting pituitary function. Most people with this form have either experienced past head trauma or have stopped ADH production for an unknown reason.

==Treatment==
Treatment involves drinking sufficient fluids to prevent dehydration. Other treatments depend on the type. In central and gestational DI treatment is with desmopressin. Nephrogenic DI may be treated by addressing the underlying cause or the use of a thiazide, aspirin, or ibuprofen.

===Central===
Central DI and gestational DI respond to desmopressin which is given as intranasal or oral tablets. Carbamazepine, an anticonvulsive medication, has also had some success in this type of DI. Also, gestational DI tends to abate on its own in four to six weeks following labor, though some women may develop it again in subsequent pregnancies. In dipsogenic DI, desmopressin is not usually an option.

===Nephrogenic===
Desmopressin will be ineffective in nephrogenic DI which is treated by reversing the underlying cause (if possible) and replacing the free water deficit. A thiazide diuretic, such as chlorthalidone or hydrochlorothiazide, can be used to create mild hypovolemia which encourages salt and water uptake in proximal tubule and thus improve nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Amiloride has additional benefit of blocking Na uptake. Thiazide diuretics are sometimes combined with amiloride to prevent hypokalemia caused by the thiazides. It seems paradoxical to treat an extreme diuresis with a diuretic, and the exact mechanism of action is unknown but the thiazide diuretics will decrease distal convoluted tubule reabsorption of sodium and water, thereby causing diuresis. This decreases plasma volume, thus lowering the glomerular filtration rate and enhancing the absorption of sodium and water in the proximal nephron. Less fluid reaches the distal nephron, so overall fluid conservation is obtained.

Lithium-induced nephrogenic DI may be effectively managed with the administration of amiloride, a potassium-sparing diuretic often used in conjunction with thiazide or loop diuretics. Clinicians have been aware of lithium toxicity for many years, and traditionally have administered thiazide diuretics for lithium-induced polyuria and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. However, amiloride has recently been shown to be a successful treatment for this condition.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;diabetes&quot; ( or ) comes from Latin , which in turn comes from , which literally means &quot;a passer through; a siphon&quot;. Ancient Greek physician Aretaeus of Cappadocia (fl. in the first century CE) used that word, with the intended meaning &quot;excessive discharge of urine&quot;, as the name for the disease. Ultimately, the word comes from Greek (), meaning &quot;to pass through&quot;, which is composed of - (&quot;dia&quot;-), meaning &quot;through&quot; and (), meaning &quot;to go&quot;. The word &quot;diabetes&quot; is first recorded in English, in the form &quot;diabete&quot;, in a medical text written around 1425.

&quot;Insipidus&quot; comes from Latin language (tasteless), from Latin: &quot;in-&quot; &quot;not&quot; + &quot;tasty&quot; from &quot;sapere&quot; &quot;have a taste&quot;—the full meaning is &quot;lacking flavor or zest; not tasty&quot;. Application of this name to DI arose from the fact that diabetes insipidus does not cause glycosuria (excretion of glucose into the urine).

In a large survey conducted amongst patients with central diabetes insipidus, the majority were in favor of changing the disease&#x27;s name to &quot;vasopressin deficiency&quot; to avoid confusion with diabetes mellitus.

<text>In music, an aria (, ; : , ; &quot;arias&quot; in common usage; diminutive form: arietta, ; : ariette; in English simply [[air (music)|air]]) is a self-contained piece for one voice, with or without instrumental or orchestral accompaniment, normally part of a larger work.

The typical context for arias is opera, but vocal arias also feature in oratorios and cantatas, or they can be stand-alone concert arias. The term was originally used to refer to any expressive melody, usually, but not always, performed by a singer.

==Etymology==
The Italian term &quot;aria&quot;, which derives from the Greek ἀήρ and Latin &quot;aer&quot; (air), first appeared in relation to music in the 14th century when it simply signified a manner or style of singing or playing. By the end of the 16th century, the term &#x27;aria&#x27; refers to an instrumental form (cf. Santino Garsi da Parma lute works, (&#x27;Aria del Gran Duca&#x27;). By the early 16th century it was in common use as meaning a simple setting of strophic poetry; melodic madrigals, free of complex polyphony, were known as &quot;madrigale arioso&quot;.

==In opera==
===Aria form in late 17th century French and Italian opera===
In the context of staged works and concert works, arias evolved from simple melodies into structured forms. In such works, the sung, melodic, and structured aria differed from the speech-like (&quot;&quot;) recitative – the latter tending to carry the story-line, the former used to convey emotional content and serve as an opportunity for singers to display their vocal talent.

By the late 17th century operatic arias came to be written in one of two forms. Binary form arias were in two sections (A–B); arias in ternary form (A–B–A) were known as &quot;da capo arias&quot; (literally &#x27;from the head&#x27;, i.e. with the opening section repeated, often in a highly decorated manner). In the &quot;da capo&quot; aria the &#x27;B&#x27; episode would typically be in a different key – the dominant or relative major key. Other variants of these forms are found in the French operas of the late 17th century such as those of Jean-Baptiste Lully which dominated the period of the French baroque. Vocal solos in his operas (known of course as the French term, &quot;airs&quot;) are frequently in extended binary form (ABB&#x27;) or sometimes in &quot;rondeau&quot; form (ABACA), (a shape which is analogous to the instrumental rondo).

In the work of Italian composers of the late 17th and early 18th century, the &quot;da capo&quot; aria came to be include the &quot;ritornello&quot; (literally, &#x27;little return&#x27;), a recurring instrumental episode which featured certain phrases of the aria proper and provided, in early operas, the opportunity for dancing or entries of characters. &quot;Da capo&quot; aria with &quot;ritornelli&quot; became a typifying feature of European opera throughout the 18th century and is thought by some writers to be a direct antecedent of sonata form. The &quot;ritornelli&quot; became essential to the structure of the aria – &quot;while the words determine the character of a melody the ritornello instruments often decided in what terms it shall be presented.&quot;

===18th century===
By the early 18th century, composers such as Alessandro Scarlatti had established the aria form, and especially its da capo version with ritornelli, as the key element of &quot;opera seria&quot;. &quot;It offered balance and continuity, and yet gave scope for contrast. [...] The very regularity of its conventional features enabled deviations from the normal to be exploited with telling effect.&quot; In the early years of the century, arias in the Italian style began to take over in French opera, giving rise eventually to the French genre of &quot;ariette&quot;, normally in a relatively simple ternary form.

Types of operatic aria became known by a variety of terms according to their character – e.g.&quot;aria parlante&quot; (&#x27;speaking-style&#x27;, narrative in nature), &quot;aria di bravura&quot; (typically given to a heroine), &quot;aria buffa&quot; (aria of a comic type, typically given to a bass or bass-baritone), and so on.

M. F. Robinson describes the standard aria in &quot;opera seria&quot; in the period 1720 to 1760 as follows:

The first section normally began with an orchestral ritornello after which the singer entered and sang the words of the first stanza in their entirety. By the end of this first vocal paragraph the music, if it were in a major key as it usually was, had modulated to the dominant. The orchestra then played a second ritornello usually shorter than the first. The singer re-entered and sang the same words through a second time. The music of this second paragraph was often slightly more elaborate than that of the first. There were more repeats of words and perhaps more florid vocalisations. The key worked its way back to the tonic for the final vocal cadence after which the orchestra rounded the section off with a final ritornello.

The nature and allocation of the arias to the different roles in &quot;opera seria&quot; was highly formalized. According to the playwright and librettist Carlo Goldoni, in his autobiography,

The three principal personages of the drama ought to sing five arias each; two in the first act, two in the second, and one in the third. The second actress and the second soprano can only have three, and the inferior characters must be satisfied with a single aria each, or two at the most. The author of the words must [...] take care that two pathetic [i.e. melancholy] arias do not succeed one another. He must distribute with the same precaution the bravura arias, the arias of action, the inferior arias, and the minuets and rondeaus. He must, above all things, avoid giving impassioned arias, bravura arias, or rondeaus, to inferior characters.

By contrast, arias in &quot;opera buffa&quot; (comic opera) were often specific in character to the nature of the character being portrayed (for example the cheeky servant-girl or the irascible elderly suitor or guardian).

By later in the century it was clear that these formats were becoming fossilized. Christoph Willibald Gluck thought that both &quot;opera buffa&quot; and &quot;opera seria&quot; had strayed too far from what opera should really be, and seemed unnatural. The jokes of &quot;opera buffa&quot; were threadbare and the repetition of the same characters made them seem no more than stereotypes. In &quot;opera seria&quot; the singing was devoted to superficial effects and the content was uninteresting and stale. As in &quot;opera buffa&quot;, the singers were often masters of the stage and the music, decorating the vocal lines so floridly that audiences could no longer recognise the original melody. Gluck wanted to return opera to its origins, focusing on human drama and passions and making words and music of equal importance. The effects of these Gluckist reforms were seen not only in his own operas but in the later works of Mozart; the arias now become far more expressive of the individual emotions of the characters and are both more firmly anchored in, and advance, the storyline. Richard Wagner was to praise Gluck&#x27;s innovations in his 1850 essay &quot;Opera and Drama&quot;: &quot; The musical composer revolted against the wilfulness of the singer&quot;; rather than &quot;unfold[ing] the purely sensuous contents of the Aria to their highest, rankest, pitch&quot;, Gluck sought &quot;to put shackles on Caprice&#x27;s execution of that Aria, by himself endeavouring to give the tune [...] an expression answering to the underlying Word-text&quot;. This attitude was to underlie Wagner&#x27;s would-be deconstruction of aria in his concept of &quot;Gesamtkunstwerk&quot;.

===19th century===
Despite the ideals of Gluck, and the trend to organise libretti so that arias had a more organic part in the drama rather than merely interrupting its flow, in the operas of the early 19th century, (for example those of Gioachino Rossini and Gaetano Donizetti), bravura arias remained focal attractions, and they continued to play a major role in grand opera, and in Italian opera through the 19th century.

A favoured form of aria in the first half of the 19th century in Italian opera was the &quot;cabaletta&quot;, in which a songlike &quot;cantabile&quot; section is followed by a more animated section, the &quot;cabaletta&quot; proper, repeated in whole or in part. Typically such arias would be preceded by recitative, the whole sequence being termed a &quot;scena&quot;. There might also be opportunities for participation by orchestra or chorus. An example is &quot;Casta diva&quot; from the opera &quot;Norma&quot; of Vincenzo Bellini.

After around 1850, aria forms in Italian opera began to show more variety – many of the operas of Giuseppe Verdi offer extended narrative arias for leading roles that enable, in their scope, intensification of drama and characterisation. Examples include Rigoletto&#x27;s condemnation of the court, &quot;Cortigiani, vil razza dannata!&quot; (1851).

Later in the century, the post-1850 operas of Wagner were through-composed, with fewer elements being readily identifiable as self-contained arias; whilst the Italian genre of verismo opera also sought to integrate arioso elements although still allowing some &#x27;show-pieces&#x27;.

==Concert arias==
Concert arias, which are not part of any larger work, (or were sometimes written to replace or insert arias in their own operas or operas of other composers) were written by composers to provide the opportunity for vocal display for concert singers; examples are &quot;&quot;, Op. 65, by Beethoven, and a number of concert arias by Mozart, including &quot;Conservati fedele&quot;.

==Instrumental music==
The term &#x27;aria&#x27; was frequently used in the 17th and 18th centuries for instrumental music modelled on vocal music. For example, J. S. Bach&#x27;s so-called &quot;Goldberg Variations&quot; were titled at their 1741 publication &quot;Clavier Ubung bestehend in einer ARIA mit verschiedenen Verænderungen&quot; (&quot;Keyboard exercise, consisting of one ARIA with diverse variations.&quot;)

The word is sometimes used in contemporary music as a title for instrumental pieces, e.g. Robin Holloway&#x27;s 1980 &#x27;aria&#x27; for chamber ensemble or Harrison Birtwistle&#x27;s brass band piece, &quot;Grimethorpe Aria&quot; (1973).
