<text>Return of the Jedi (also known as Star Wars: Episode VI – Return of the Jedi is a 1983 American epic space opera film directed by Richard Marquand from a screenplay by Lawrence Kasdan and George Lucas. The sequel to &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980), it is the third installment in the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy and the sixth chronological film in the &quot;Skywalker Saga&quot;. The film follows the ongoing struggle between the malevolent Galactic Empire and the freedom fighters of the Rebel Alliance. As the Rebels attempt to destroy the Empire&#x27;s second Death Star, Luke Skywalker tries to bring his father, Darth Vader, back from the dark side of the Force. The film stars Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams, Anthony Daniels, David Prowse, Kenny Baker, Peter Mayhew, and Frank Oz.

Steven Spielberg, David Lynch, and David Cronenberg were considered to direct the film before Marquand signed on as director. The production team relied on Lucas&#x27; storyboards during pre-production. While writing the shooting script, Lucas, Kasdan, Marquand, and producer Howard Kazanjian spent two weeks in conference discussing ideas to construct it. Kazanjian&#x27;s schedule pushed shooting to begin a few weeks early to allow Industrial Light &amp; Magic more time to work on the film&#x27;s effects in post-production. Filming took place in England, California, and Arizona from January to .

The film was released in theaters on May 25, 1983. It grossed $374 million worldwide during its initial theatrical run, becoming the highest-grossing film of 1983. The film was well received by critics, with strong praise going to the performances of the actors, John Williams&#x27; score, the special effects and the action sequences. Several re-releases and revisions to the film have followed over the decades, which have brought its total gross to $482 million. The United States Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry in 2021. A prequel trilogy, released between 1999 and 2005, and a sequel trilogy, released between 2015 and 2019, followed.

== Plot ==

A year after Han Solo&#x27;s capture and imprisonment in carbonite, C-3PO and R2-D2 enter the palace of the crime lord Jabba the Hutt on Tatooine. They were sent as a goodwill gift by Luke Skywalker, who hopes to negotiate with Jabba for Han&#x27;s release. Disguised as a bounty hunter, Princess Leia infiltrates the palace under the pretense of having captured Chewbacca. She releases Han from the carbonite but is caught by Jabba and enslaved. Luke arrives to bargain for the release of his friends, but Jabba drops him through a trapdoor to be eaten by a rancor. After Luke kills the beast, Jabba decrees that he, Han, and Chewbacca will be fed to a Sarlacc, a deadly ground-dwelling creature. Luke retrieves his new green lightsaber from , and the group of friends battle Jabba&#x27;s thugs aboard his sail barge. During the chaos, Boba Fett falls into the Sarlacc&#x27;s pit and Leia strangles Jabba to death with her chains. The group escapes as Jabba&#x27;s sail barge is destroyed.

As the others rendezvous with the Rebel Alliance, Luke returns to Dagobah to complete his Jedi training with Yoda, who is dying when he arrives. Before Yoda dies, he confirms that Darth Vader is Luke&#x27;s father, the former Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, and that there is another Skywalker. Obi-Wan Kenobi&#x27;s Force spirit tells Luke that Leia is his twin sister, and that he must face Vader again to finish his training and defeat the Empire.

The Alliance learns that the Empire has been constructing a second Death Star under the supervision of the Emperor. The station is protected by an energy shield on the forest moon of Endor. To destroy its generator, Han leads a strike team which includes Luke, Leia, and Chewbacca. Once on the moon, the team gains the trust of a tribe of Ewoks after an initial conflict. Later, Luke tells Leia that she is his sister, and that Vader is their father. Luke surrenders to Imperial troops and is brought before Vader, but fails to convince him to reject the dark side of the Force.

Luke is brought to the Emperor, who intends to turn him to the dark side. He also reveals that Luke&#x27;s friends on Endor and the Rebel fleet are heading into a trap. On the forest moon, Han&#x27;s team is captured by Imperial forces, but a counterattack by the Ewoks allows the Rebels to infiltrate the shield generator. Meanwhile, Lando Calrissian and Admiral Ackbar lead the Rebel assault on the Death Star, finding its shield still active and the Imperial fleet waiting for them.

The Emperor reveals to Luke that the Death Star is fully operational and orders the firing of its massive laser, which destroys a Rebel starship. He invites Luke to give in to his anger and embrace the dark side of the Force. Luke attacks him, but Vader intervenes, and the two engage in a lightsaber duel. Vader senses that Luke has a sister and threatens to turn her to the dark side if Luke will not join him. Enraged, Luke attacks Vader and severs his prosthetic hand. The Emperor orders Luke to kill his father, but Luke refuses. In response, the Emperor tortures Luke with Force lightning. Unwilling to let his son die, Vader throws the Emperor down a shaft to his demise. Vader is fatally wounded and asks Luke to remove his mask in a moment of reconciliation before he dies.

After the Rebel strike team destroys the shield generator, Lando leads fighter ships into the Death Star&#x27;s core. While the Rebel fleet destroys the Imperial command ship, Lando and X-wing pilot Wedge Antilles destroy the Death Star&#x27;s main reactor and escape before the station explodes. Luke cremates Vader&#x27;s body on Endor before reuniting with his friends. As the Rebels celebrate their victory, Luke sees the Force spirits of Obi-Wan, Yoda, and Anakin standing nearby.

== Production ==

=== Development ===
Following discussions between &quot;Star Wars&quot; creator George Lucas and producer Howard Kazanjian, a sequel to &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; was swiftly put into production. As with the previous film, Lucas personally financed &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. Lucas also chose not to direct the film himself, and started searching for a director. Irvin Kershner, who previously directed &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, declined to direct after spending two years working on the previous film, choosing to direct &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;. Although Lucas&#x27;s first choice was Steven Spielberg, their separate feuds with the Director&#x27;s Guild led to him being banned from directing the film. Lucas approached David Lynch, who had recently been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director for &quot;The Elephant Man&quot; in 1980, to helm &quot;Return of the Jedi.&quot; Lynch declined, saying that he had &quot;next door to zero interest&quot;, believing Lucas should direct it since &quot;Star Wars&quot; was his creation.

Lucas also offered David Cronenberg the chance to direct, but he declined the offer as he did not want to work on material written by others. Lamont Johnson, director of &quot;The Last American Hero&quot; (1973), was also considered. Lucas eventually chose Richard Marquand. Lucas operated the second camera on set a few times. Lucas has admitted to being on the set frequently because of Marquand&#x27;s relative inexperience with special effects. Lucas praised Marquand as a &quot;very nice person who worked well with actors&quot;. Marquand did note that Lucas kept a conspicuous presence on set, joking, &quot;It is rather like trying to direct &quot;King Lear&quot; – with Shakespeare in the next room!&quot;

The screenplay was written by Lawrence Kasdan and Lucas (with uncredited contributions by David Peoples and Marquand), based on Lucas&#x27;s story. Kasdan claims he told Lucas that &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; was &quot;a weak title&quot;. Kazanjian said the same, and the title was changed to &quot;Revenge of the Jedi&quot; one or two days later. The screenplay itself was not finished until rather late in pre-production, well after a production schedule and budget had been created by Kazanjian and Marquand had been hired, which was unusual for a film. Instead, the production team relied on Lucas&#x27;s story and rough draft in order to commence work with the art department. When it came time to formally write a shooting script, Lucas, Kasdan, Marquand and Kazanjian spent two weeks in conference discussing ideas; Kasdan used tape transcripts of these meetings to then construct the script.

The question of whether Ford would return for the final film arose during pre-production. Unlike Hamill and Fisher, Ford had not contracted to do two sequels, and &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; had made him an even bigger star. Kazanjian said that Han was frozen in carbonite in &quot;Empire&quot; because the filmmakers were unsure whether the character would return. He also claimed that Lucas did not expect Ford to return, and that Han was initially not in the script. However, Kazanjian—who also produced &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark—&quot;convinced Ford to return.

Ford felt that Han should die through self-sacrifice in the third film. Kasdan agreed, and said it should occur near the beginning of the third act, to make the audience wonder whether the other protagonists will survive. Gary Kurtz, who produced &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Empire&quot; but was replaced by Kazanjian for &quot;Jedi&quot;, said that Han died in an early version of the script. Kurtz has suggested that one reason Lucas may have rejected the idea of Han dying was that it would not be good for merchandising. Kurtz also has claimed that an early script ended with the Rebel forces in tatters, Leia grappling with her new duties as queen, and Luke walking off alone &quot;like Clint Eastwood in the spaghetti Westerns&quot;.

Yoda was originally not meant to appear in the film, but Marquand strongly felt that returning to Dagobah was essential to resolve the dilemma raised by the previous film. The inclusion led Lucas to insert a scene in which Yoda confirms that Darth Vader is Luke&#x27;s father because, after a discussion with a children&#x27;s psychologist, he did not want younger moviegoers to dismiss Vader&#x27;s claim as a lie. Many ideas from the original script were left out or changed. For instance, the Ewoks were going to be Wookiees and the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot; was going to land on Endor. Following the defeat of the Emperor, the film was originally intended to end with Obi-Wan and Yoda returning to life from their spectral existence in the Force, along with Anakin Skywalker, thanks to Yoda being able to prevent him from becoming one with the Force. They would then join the rest of the characters in their celebration on Endor.

=== Casting ===

Alan Webb was originally cast as the Emperor, but dropped out due to illness. Lindsay Anderson was offered the role, but turned it down due to scheduling conflicts. Ben Kingsley and David Suchet were also considered. Alan Rickman auditioned for the role of Moff Jerjerrod, but Michael Pennington was cast instead. Marquand initially wanted a famous actor such as Laurence Olivier or John Gielgud to play the unmasked Vader, but Lucas was concerned that such an actor would be distracting for audiences. Kenny Baker was originally cast as Wicket the Ewok, but he fell ill with food poisoning on the day of the shoot. He was replaced by Warwick Davis, who had no film acting experience.

=== Filming ===
Filming began on January 11, 1982, and lasted through May 20, 1982, a schedule six weeks shorter than &quot;Empire&quot;. Kazanjian&#x27;s schedule pushed shooting as early as possible in order to give Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM) as much time as possible to work on effects, and left some crew members dubious of their ability to be fully prepared for the shoot. Working on a budget of $32.5 million, Lucas was determined to avoid going over budget as had happened with &quot;Empire&quot;. Kazanjian estimated that using ILM (owned wholly by Lucasfilm) for special effects saved the production approximately $18 million. However, the fact that Lucasfilm was a non-union company made acquiring shooting locations more difficult and more expensive, even though &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Empire&quot; had been big hits. The project was given the working title &quot;Blue Harvest&quot; with a tagline of &quot;Horror Beyond Imagination.&quot; This disguised what the production crew was really filming from fans and the press, and also prevented price gouging by service providers.

The first stage of production started with 78 days at Elstree Studios in England, where the film occupied all nine stages. The shoot commenced with a scene later deleted from the finished film where the heroes get caught in a sandstorm as they leave Tatooine. (This was the only major sequence cut from the film during editing.) For the rancor, Lucas wanted to use a stunt performer in a suit in the style of the Toho &quot;Godzilla&quot; films. The production team made several attempts, but were unable to create an adequate result. Lucas eventually relented and decided to film the rancor as a high-speed puppet.

In April, the crew moved to Arizona&#x27;s Yuma Desert for two weeks of Tatooine exteriors. Production then moved to the redwood forests of northern California. Forested private land near Smith River and at the Chetham Grove section of Grizzly Creek Redwoods State Park were used for the forests of Endor. The crew spent two weeks shooting the Endor forest exteriors, and then concluded at ILM in San Rafael, California, for about ten days of bluescreen shots. One of two &quot;skeletal&quot; post-production units shooting background matte plates spent a day in Death Valley. The other was a special Steadicam unit shooting forest backgrounds from June 15 to June 17, 1982, for the speeder chase near the middle of the film. Steadicam inventor Garrett Brown personally filmed these shots at less than one frame per second. By walking at about and projecting the footage at 24 frame/s, the motion seen in the film appeared as if it were moving at around . Vader&#x27;s funeral was filmed at Skywalker Ranch.

Marquand and Anthony Daniels clashed somewhat, leading to the latter recording his ADR (dialogue overdubs) with Lucas instead. Carrie Fisher disliked working with Marquand, too; he often yelled at her, which caused her to burst into tears on one occasion, which ruined her makeup and required an hour-long redo.

=== Post-production ===
Lucasfilm encountered problems when it tested the film in a commercial theater. Lucas and his employees could not hear many of the sound effects they had mixed. To make matters worse, the background noise in the theater muffled the majority of the film&#x27;s sound, which played through the theater&#x27;s normal commercial sound system. Many theaters at the time had poor room acoustics with mono sound. Lucas would solve the problem by creating a new cinema audio company, THX, and ensuring that all theaters playing his movies would use the new system.

Meanwhile, special effects work at ILM quickly stretched the company to its operational limits. While the R&amp;D work and experience gained from the previous two films in the trilogy allowed for increased efficiency, this was offset by the desire to have the closing film raise the bar set by each of these films. A compounding factor was the intention of several departments of ILM to either take on other film work or decrease staff during slow cycles. Instead, as soon as production began, the entire company found it necessary to remain running 20 hours a day on six-day weeks in order to meet their goals by April 1, 1983. Of about 900 special effects shots, all VistaVision optical effects remained in-house, since ILM was the only company capable of using the format, while about 400 4-perf opticals were subcontracted to outside effects houses. Progress on the opticals was severely delayed for a time when ILM rejected about of film when the film perforations failed image registration and steadiness tests.

== Music ==

John Williams composed the film&#x27;s musical score and performed it with the London Symphony Orchestra. Orchestration credits also include Thomas Newman. The initial release of the film&#x27;s soundtrack was on the RSO Records label in the United States. Sony Classical Records acquired the rights to the original trilogy scores in 2004 after gaining the rights to release the prequel trilogy soundtracks (&quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; and &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot;). In the same year, Sony Classical re-pressed the 1997 RCA Victor release of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; along with the other two films in the trilogy. The set was released with the new artwork mirroring the first DVD release of the film. Despite the Sony digital re-mastering, which minimally improved the sound heard only on high-end stereos, this 2004 release is essentially the same as the 1997 RCA Victor release.

== Release ==
&quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; was released on May 25, 1983. It was originally slated to open on May 27, but was subsequently changed to coincide with the date of the 1977 release of the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; film. With a massive worldwide marketing campaign, illustrator Tim Reamer created the image for the movie poster and other advertising. At the time of its release, the film was advertised on posters and merchandise as simply &quot;Star Wars: Return of the Jedi&quot;, despite its on-screen &quot;Episode VI&quot; distinction. The film was re-released in 1985.

=== Title change ===
The original teaser trailer for the film carried the name &quot;Revenge of the Jedi&quot;. In December 1982, Lucas decided that &quot;Revenge&quot; was not appropriate as a &#x27;true Jedi should never seek revenge&#x27; and returned to his original title. By that time thousands of &quot;Revenge&quot; teaser posters (with artwork by Drew Struzan) had been printed and distributed. Lucasfilm stopped the shipping of the posters and sold the remaining stock of 6,800 posters to &quot;Star Wars&quot; fan club members for $9.50. In 2005, &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot;, released as part of the prequel trilogy, alluded to the dismissed title &quot;Revenge of the Jedi&quot;.

=== Box office ===

&quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; grossed $314.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $166 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $480 million, against a production budget of about $32.5 million.

&quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; collected a total of $6.2 million on its opening day, beating out &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot; to have the highest single day gross. It would hold the record for having the highest pre-Memorial Day Wednesday gross until 1996 when &quot;&quot; surpassed it. The film made $23 million from 1,002 theaters in its opening weekend and grossed a record $45.3 million in its opening week. It set a new domestic opening weekend record, surpassing the $14 million opening of &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot;. Its $22,973 per theatre average would stand as a record for a nationwide release on an inflation-adjusted basis for 36 years until it was surpassed by &quot;&quot; in 2019. It finished first at the box office for six of its first seven weeks of release, only coming in second once behind &quot;Superman III&quot; in its fourth weekend. Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 80 million tickets in the US in its initial theatrical run. When it was re-released in 1985, it made $11.2 million, which totaled its initial theatrical gross to $385.8 million worldwide. During its re-release in 1997, the film grossed $16.29 million in its opening weekend. When it was re-released in 2023, for its 40th anniversary, the film grossed $5.1 million to place #4 in the weekend box office.

== Reception ==

=== Critical response ===
Film critic Roger Ebert gave &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; four out of four stars, calling it &quot;a complete entertainment, a feast for the eyes and a delight for the fancy. It&#x27;s a little amazing how Lucas and his associates keep topping themselves.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; also gave the film four stars out of four and wrote, &quot;From the moment that the familiar &quot;Star Wars&quot; introductory words begin to crawl up the screen, &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; is a childlike delight. It&#x27;s the best video game around. And for the professional moviegoers, it is particularly enjoyable to watch every facet of filmmaking at its best.&quot;

James Harwood of &quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;a visual treat throughout,&quot; but thought that &quot;Hamill is not enough of a dramatic actor to carry the plot load here&quot; and Harrison Ford &quot;is present more in body than in spirit this time, given little to do but react to special effects. And it can&#x27;t be said that either Carrie Fisher or Billy Dee Williams rise to previous efforts. But Lucas and director Richard Marquand have overwhelmed these performer flaws with a truly amazing array of creatures, old and new, plus the familiar space hardware.&quot; Sheila Benson of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that the film &quot;is fully satisfying, it gives honest value to all the hopes of its believers. With this last of the central &quot;Star Wars&quot; cycle, there is the sense of the closing of a circle, of leaving behind real friends. It is accomplished with a weight and a new maturity that seem entirely fitting, yet the movie has lost none of its sense of fun; it bursts with new inventiveness.&quot;

Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said, &quot;&quot;Return of the Jedi,&quot; a feat of mass enchantment, puts the happy finishing touches on George Lucas&#x27; &quot;Star Wars&quot; saga. It was worth the wait, and the work is now an imposing landmark in contemporary popular culture—a three-part, 6¼-hour science-fiction epic of unabashed heroic proclivities.&quot; The film was also featured on the May 23, 1983, &quot;Time&quot; magazine cover issue (where it was labeled &quot;Star Wars III&quot;), where the reviewer Gerald Clarke said that while it was not as exciting as the first &quot;Star Wars&quot; film, it was &quot;better and more satisfying&quot; than &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, now considered by many as the best of the original trilogy.

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; &quot;by far the dimmest adventure of the lot&quot; and stated, &quot;The joys of watching space battles as envisioned by wizards in studios and laboratories are not inexhaustible.&quot; Pauline Kael of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; stated, &quot;Some of the trick effects might seem miraculous if the imagery had any lustre, but &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; is an impersonal and rather junky piece of moviemaking.&quot;

Christopher John reviewed &quot;The Return of the Jedi&quot; in &quot;Ares&quot; magazine #15 and commented that &quot;&quot;Star Wars&quot; may not be dead, but &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; is a failure, and is a cheap and tarnished crown for the series which shook the world of film when it started out . . . a long time ago, in that galaxy far, far away.&quot;

Colin Greenland reviewed &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, and stated that &quot;You would think a series like &quot;Star Wars&quot;, fuelled by public adoration, coasting along on the hyperdrive of its own hyperboles, would get inexorably worse. It is not. It is getting better.&quot;

=== Accolades ===
In 2021, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

== Post-release ==
=== Re-releases ===
In 1997, for the 20th anniversary of the release of &quot;Star Wars&quot; (re-titled &quot;Episode IV: A New Hope&quot;), Lucas released the &quot;Star Wars Trilogy: Special Edition&quot;. Along with the two other films in the original trilogy, &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; was rereleased on March 14, 1997 (moved up one week from its original announced release date of March 7 due to the box office success of &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; the month prior), with a number of changes and additions, including the insertion of several alien band members and a different song in Jabba&#x27;s throne room, the modification of the sarlacc to include a beak, the replacement of music at the closing scene, and a montage of different alien worlds celebrating the fall of the Empire. The runtime of the 1997 Special Edition of the film and all subsequent releases is approximately five minutes longer than the original theatrical version.

The film was re-released theatrically by 20th Century Studios on April 28, 2023, to commemorate the film&#x27;s 40th anniversary.

=== Home media ===
The original theatrical version of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; was released on VHS and Laserdisc several times between 1986 and 1995, followed by releases of the Special Edition in the same formats between 1997 and 2000. Some of these releases contained featurettes; some were individual releases of just this film, while others were boxed sets of all three original films.

On September 21, 2004, the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy was released in a boxset on DVD with digital restoration and additional alterations made by Lucas.
In this version of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, Sebastian Shaw&#x27;s portrayal of Anakin&#x27;s spirit is replaced by Hayden Christensen, who portrayed Anakin in &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot; and &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;. All three films of the trilogy were released individually on Limited Edition DVDs on September 12, 2006, with the original unaltered versions included as bonus features. These were collected in a box set on November 4, 2008.

A Blu-ray Disc version of the six-film &quot;Star Wars&quot; saga was released by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment in September 2011, which incorporated more small changes to &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, including making the Ewoks blink and having Vader yell &quot;No!&quot; as he throws the Emperor down the Death Star shaft; the latter change drew sharp negative criticism. Several deleted scenes from the film were included as special features, including a completed scene in which Vader communicates with Luke via the Force as Luke assembles his new lightsaber before infiltrating Jabba&#x27;s palace, a sandstorm sequence following the sarlacc pit rescue, and a scene featuring Moff Jerjerrod and Death Star officers during the Battle of Endor.

On April 7, 2015, Walt Disney Studios, 20th Century Fox, and Lucasfilm jointly announced the digital releases of the six released &quot;Star Wars&quot; films. &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; was released through the iTunes Store, Amazon Video, Vudu, Google Play, and Disney Movies Anywhere on April 10, 2015.

Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment reissued &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; on Blu-ray, DVD, and digital download on September 22, 2019. Additionally, all six films were available for 4K HDR and Dolby Atmos streaming on Disney+ upon the service&#x27;s launch on November 12, 2019. This version of the film was released by Disney on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray box set on March 31, 2020.

== Legacy ==
According to the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 83% of critics have given the film a positive review with an average rating of 7.30/10, based on reviews from critics. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;Though failing to reach the cinematic heights of its predecessors, &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; remains an entertaining sci-fi adventure and a fitting end to the classic trilogy.&quot; At Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 58 out of 100 based on 24 reviews from mainstream critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

In his review of the 1997 Special Edition re-release, the film critic James Kendrick called &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; the weakest of the three original films, saying it depended &quot;too much on the slick commercialism&quot; of the franchise but that it was still &quot;a magnificent experience in its own right&quot;. James Berardinelli described it as the least enjoyable and least innovative film of the trilogy. He opined that the Special Edition was not saved by the alterations, but that it was nevertheless a &quot;must-see&quot; for fans as the conclusion of the trilogy.

Fans are divided on the likelihood of Ewoks (being a primitive race of small creatures) defeating an armed ground force comprising the Empire&#x27;s &quot;best troops&quot;. Lucas has defended the scenario, saying that the Ewoks&#x27; purpose was to distract the Imperial troops and they did not really win. His inspiration for the Ewoks&#x27; victory came from the Vietnam War, where the Viet Cong prevailed against the technologically superior United States.

=== Novelization ===

The novelization of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; was written by James Kahn and was released on May 12, 1983, thirteen days before the film&#x27;s release.

=== Radio drama ===

A three-hour radio drama adaptation of the film was written by Brian Daley with additional material contributed by John Whitman and was produced for and broadcast on National Public Radio in 1996 (over a decade after the radio adaptations of the first two &quot;Star Wars&quot; films). It was based on characters and situations created by George Lucas and on the screenplay by Kasdan and Lucas. Anthony Daniels reprised his role from the film as C-3PO, but Mark Hamill and Billy Dee Williams (who lent their voices to the previous radio adaptations) were replaced by newcomer Joshua Fardon and character actor Arye Gross, respectively. Bernard Behrens and Brock Peters reprised their roles as Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader, respectively. John Lithgow voiced Yoda, and veteran character actor Ed Begley, Jr. played Boba Fett. Ed Asner voiced Jabba the Hutt, speaking only in grunts.

=== Comic book adaptation ===

Marvel Comics published a comic book adaptation of the film by writer Archie Goodwin and artists Al Williamson, Carlos Garzon, Tom Palmer, and Ron Frenz. The adaptation appeared in &quot;Marvel Super Special&quot; #27 and as a four-issue limited series. It was later reprinted in a mass market paperback, as well as collections of Marvel&#x27;s self-titled &quot;Star Wars&quot; series. Marvel Super Special #27 was mistakenly released in April 1983, a month before the film itself, giving away spoilers to the film&#x27;s plot. Hamill is a comic book fan and while he was in a comic book store, he discovered that the comic book was on sale there and alerted Lucasfilm. According to Carol Kalish who was Marvel&#x27;s direct sales manager at the time, Marvel quickly recalled the book upon learning this mistake though it did not stop the premature revelation of the secrets of the film&#x27;s plot. Kalish kept her job, as did everyone else in the Sales Department, as the incident was apparently considered a simple mistake.

=== Book-and-record set ===
Lucasfilm adapted the story for a children&#x27;s book-and-record set. Released in 1983, the 24-page &quot;Star Wars: Return of the Jedi&quot; read-along book was accompanied by a 33⅓ rpm gramophone record. Each page of the book contained a cropped frame from the film with an abridged and condensed version of the story. The record was produced by Buena Vista Records.

== Prequels and sequels ==

16 years after the release of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, Lucas wrote and directed the prequel trilogy, consisting of the films &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;, &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot;, and &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;. The films chronicle the history between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, and the latter&#x27;s fall to the darkside and transformation into Darth Vader. The prequel trilogy was financially successful, and polarized critics and fans on their release for the storylines and some new characters.

After Lucas sold the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise to the Walt Disney Company in 2012, Disney developed a sequel trilogy, consisting of &quot;The Force Awakens&quot;, &quot;The Last Jedi&quot;, and &quot;The Rise of Skywalker&quot;. Original trilogy cast members including Ford, Hamill, and Fisher reprised their roles, alongside new characters portrayed by Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Adam Driver, and Oscar Isaac. Standalone films and television series have also been released, exploring adventures set around the main trilogy arcs. Most relevantly, the Disney+ streaming shows &quot;The Book of Boba Fett&quot;, &quot;Ahsoka&quot;, &quot;The Mandalorian&quot; and the latter&#x27;s upcoming spin-offs are set a few years after &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, bridging the time period between that film and &quot;The Force Awakens&quot;.

<doc id="50745" wikidata="Q4028" url="?curid=50745" title="Paul Simon">
<text>Paul Frederic Simon (born October 13, 1941) is an American singer-songwriter known for his solo work and his collaborations with Art Garfunkel. He and Garfunkel, whom he met in elementary school in 1953, came to prominence in the 1960s as Simon &amp; Garfunkel. Their blend of folk and rock, including hits such as &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot; (1965), &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot; (1968), &quot;America&quot; (1968) and &quot;The Boxer&quot; (1969), served as a soundtrack to the 1960s counterculture. Their final album, &quot;Bridge over Troubled Water&quot; (1970), is among the best-selling of all time.

As a solo artist, Simon has explored genres including gospel, reggae and soul. His albums &quot;Paul Simon&quot; (1972), &quot;There Goes Rhymin&#x27; Simon&quot; (1973), and &quot;Still Crazy After All These Years&quot; (1975) kept him in the public eye and drew acclaim, producing the hits &quot;Mother and Child Reunion&quot; (1972), &quot;Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard&quot; (1972), and &quot;50 Ways to Leave Your Lover&quot; (1975). Simon reunited with Garfunkel for several tours and the 1981 Concert in Central Park.

In 1986, Simon released his most successful and acclaimed album, &quot;Graceland&quot;, incorporating South African influences. &quot;You Can Call Me Al&quot; became one of Simon&#x27;s most successful singles. &quot;Graceland&quot; was followed by &quot;The Rhythm of the Saints&quot; (1990), and a second Concert in the Park in 1991, without Garfunkel, which was attended by approximately 500,000 people. In 1998, Simon wrote a Broadway musical, &quot;The Capeman&quot;, which was poorly received. In the 21st century, Simon continued to record and tour. His later albums, such as &quot;You&#x27;re the One&quot; (2000), &quot;So Beautiful or So What&quot; (2011) and &quot;Stranger to Stranger&quot; (2016), introduced him to new generations. His most recent album, &quot;Seven Psalms&quot;, was released in 2023.

Simon has twice been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and has been the recipient of sixteen Grammy Awards, including three for Album of the Year. Two of his works, &quot;Sounds of Silence&quot; (1966) as part of Simon &amp; Garfunkel and the solo &quot;Graceland&quot;, were inducted into the National Recording Registry for their cultural significance, and in 2007, the Library of Congress voted him the inaugural winner of the Gershwin Prize for Popular Song. He is a co-founder of the Children&#x27;s Health Fund, a nonprofit organization that provides medical care to children.

==Early life==
Simon was born on October 13, 1941, in Newark, New Jersey, to Hungarian-Jewish parents. His father, Louis (1916–1995), a professor of education at the City College of New York, was a double-bass player and dance bandleader who performed under the name Lee Sims. His mother, Belle (1910–2007), was an elementary-school teacher. In 1945, his family moved to the Kew Gardens Hills section of Flushing, Queens, in New York City.

The musician Donald Fagen described Simon&#x27;s childhood as that of &quot;a certain kind of New York Jew, almost a stereotype really, to whom music and baseball are very important. I think it has to do with the parents. The parents are either immigrants or first-generation Americans who felt like outsiders, and assimilation was the key thought—they gravitated to black music and baseball, looking for an alternative culture.&quot; Simon said Fagen&#x27;s description was not far from the truth. Simon played baseball and stickball as a child. He described his father as funny and smart, but said he worked late and did not see his children much.

Simon met Art Garfunkel when they were 11 years old 
and performed together in a production of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; for their sixth-grade graduation. The two began singing together at the age of 13, occasionally performing at school dances. At the age of 12 or 13 Simon wrote his first song, &quot;The Girl for Me&quot;, for him and Art Garfunkel to perform. According to Simon, it became the &quot;neighborhood hit&quot;. His father wrote the words and chords on paper for the boys to use, and that paper became the first officially copyrighted Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel song. It is now in the Library of Congress. In 1957, in their mid-teens, they recorded the song &quot;Hey, Schoolgirl&quot; under the name &quot;Tom &amp; Jerry&quot;, a name that was given to them by their label, Big Records. The single reached number 49 on the pop charts.

After graduating from Forest Hills High School, Simon majored in English at Queens College and graduated in 1963. Garfunkel studied mathematics education at Columbia University in Manhattan. Simon was a brother in the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity, and attended Brooklyn Law School for one semester in 1963.

==Career==

Between 1957 and 1964, Simon wrote, recorded and released more than 30 songs. He and Garfunkel occasionally reunited as Tom &amp; Jerry to record singles, including &quot;Our Song&quot; and &quot;That&#x27;s My Story&quot;. Most of the songs Simon recorded during that time he performed alone, or with musicians other than Garfunkel. They were released on minor record labels including Amy, Big, Hunt, King, Tribute and Madison. Simon used several pseudonyms for these recordings, usually &quot;Jerry Landis&quot;, but also &quot;Paul Kane&quot; and &quot;True Taylor&quot;. By 1962, working as Jerry Landis, he was a frequent writer/producer for several Amy Records artists, overseeing material released by Dotty Daniels, the Vels and Ritchie Cordell.

Simon enjoyed moderate success with singles as part of the group Tico and the Triumphs, including &quot;Motorcycle&quot;, which reached number 99 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts in 1962. Tico and the Triumphs released four 45s. Marty Cooper, known as Tico, sang lead on several of these releases, but &quot;Motorcycle&quot; featured Simon&#x27;s vocal. Also in 1962, Simon reached number 97 on the pop charts as Jerry Landis, with the novelty song &quot;The Lone Teen Ranger&quot;. Both chart singles were released on Amy Records.

===1960s: Simon &amp; Garfunkel===
In early 1964, Simon and Garfunkel auditioned for Columbia Records, whose executive Clive Davis signed them to produce an album. Columbia decided to call them Simon &amp; Garfunkel instead of Tom &amp; Jerry, and according to Simon, this was the first time artists&#x27; surnames had been used in pop music without their first names. Simon and Garfunkel&#x27;s first LP, &quot;Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.&quot;, was released on October 19, 1964. It consisted of 12 songs, five of which were written by Simon. The album initially flopped.

In 1965, after the album&#x27;s release, Simon moved to London and performed in folk clubs. He enjoyed his time in England and said in 1970, &quot;I had a lot of friends there and a girlfriend. I could play music there. There was no place to play in New York City. They wouldn&#x27;t have me.&quot; He was welcomed by England&#x27;s bohemian folk scene, learned how to finger-pick acoustic guitar from Martin Carthy, and was introduced to English folk music. He recalled, &quot;I had never heard anything like those old English songs. I was 21, 22, and emotionally open to everything.&quot; The folk music he heard in England in the mid-sixties became one of his two big influences. He wrote &quot;Homeward Bound&quot; and &quot;I Am a Rock&quot;, and learned Davey Graham&#x27;s guitar instrumental &quot;Anji&quot;, which later appeared on &quot;Sounds of Silence&quot;.

In England, Simon recorded a solo album, &quot;The Paul Simon Songbook&quot;, featuring just his voice and guitar accompaniment; it was released in the UK only at the time, but later released elsewhere. He produced Jackson C. Frank&#x27;s first and only album and co-wrote several songs with Bruce Woodley of the Australian pop group the Seekers, including &quot;I Wish You Could Be Here&quot;, &quot;Cloudy&quot; and &quot;Red Rubber Ball&quot;. Simon also contributed to the Seekers&#x27; catalog with &quot;Someday One Day&quot;, which was released in March 1966, charting around the same time as Simon and Garfunkel&#x27;s &quot;Homeward Bound&quot;. The song was a Top 10 hit from their second UK album, &quot;Sounds of Silence&quot;, and later included on their third U.S. album &quot;Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme&quot;.

Radio stations on the American East Coast began receiving requests for the &quot;Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.&quot; track &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot;. Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#x27;s producer, Tom Wilson, overdubbed the track with electric guitar, bass guitar and drums and it was released as a single, eventually reaching number 1 on the US pop charts. Wilson did not inform the duo of his plan, and Simon was &quot;horrified&quot; when he first heard it. The success of the single drew Simon back to the US to reunite with Garfunkel, and they recorded the albums &quot;Sounds of Silence&quot; (1966), &quot;Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme&quot; (1966) and &quot;Bookends&quot; (1968). Their final album, &quot;Bridge over Troubled Water&quot; (1970), became at that time the bestselling album of all time.

Simon &amp; Garfunkel also contributed to the soundtrack of the Mike Nichols film &quot;The Graduate&quot; (1967), starring Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft. While writing &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot;, Simon toyed with the title &quot;Mrs. Roosevelt&quot;. When Garfunkel reported this indecision over the song&#x27;s name to the director, Nichols replied, &quot;Don&#x27;t be ridiculous! We&#x27;re making a movie here! It&#x27;s Mrs. Robinson!&quot;

Simon and Garfunkel&#x27;s relationship became strained and they split in 1970. At the urging of his wife, Peggy Harper, Simon called Davis to confirm the duo&#x27;s breakup. For the next several years, they spoke only two or three times a year.

===1970–1976: Solo and &quot;Still Crazy After All These Years&quot;===
In 1970, Simon taught songwriting at New York University. He said he had wanted to teach for a while, and hoped to help people avoid some of the mistakes he had made: &quot;You can teach somebody about writing songs. You can&#x27;t teach someone how to write a song ... I&#x27;d go to a course if the Beatles would talk about how they made records because I&#x27;m sure I could learn something.&quot;

Simon pursued solo work, reuniting occasionally with Garfunkel for various projects. He gave a solo performance at the Cleveland Arena in April 1972 in a benefit concert for the George McGovern 1972 presidential campaign, and he and Garfunkel reunited in mid-June that year at Madison Square Garden in another political concert for McGovern. Garfunkel joined Simon again on the 1975 Top 10 single &quot;My Little Town&quot;. Simon wrote this song for Garfunkel, whose solo output Simon felt lacked &quot;bite&quot;, and it was included on Simon&#x27;s album &quot;Still Crazy After All These Years&quot; and Garfunkel&#x27;s album &quot;Breakaway&quot;. Contrary to popular belief, the song was not based on Simon&#x27;s early life in New York City. Simon also provided guitar on Garfunkel&#x27;s 1973 album &quot;Angel Clare&quot;, and added backing vocals to the song &quot;Down in the Willow Garden&quot;.

Simon&#x27;s next album, &quot;Paul Simon&quot;, was released in January 1972, following his first experiment with world music, the Jamaican-inspired song &quot;Mother and Child Reunion&quot;, which reached both the American and British Top 5. The album received universal acclaim and critics praised its variety of styles and confessional lyrics. &quot;Paul Simon&quot; reached number 4 in the U.S. and number 1 in the UK and Japan, and later produced another Top 30 hit, &quot;Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard&quot;.

Simon&#x27;s next project, the pop-folk album &quot;There Goes Rhymin&#x27; Simon&quot;, was released in May 1973. The lead single, &quot;Kodachrome&quot;, was a number 2 hit in America. The follow-up, the gospel-flavored &quot;Loves Me Like a Rock&quot;, topped the &quot;Cashbox&quot; charts. Other songs like &quot;American Tune&quot;, or &quot;Something So Right&quot; (a tribute to Simon&#x27;s first wife Peggy), became part of his repertoire. The album reached number 1 on the &quot;Cashbox&quot; album charts. It was released in 1974 as a live album, titled &quot;Live Rhymin&#x27;&quot;, and contained elements of world and religious music.

His next album, produced by Simon and Phil Ramone, was &quot;Still Crazy After All These Years&quot;, released in October 1975. The mood of the album, written after Simon&#x27;s divorce, was darker, and contained &quot;Gone at Last&quot; (a Top 25 hit) and the Simon &amp; Garfunkel reunion track &quot;My Little Town&quot; (a number 9 on &quot;Billboard&quot;). The album was his only number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts to date. The 18th Grammy Awards named it the Album of the Year, and his performance on it the year&#x27;s Best Male Pop Vocal. The third single from the album, &quot;50 Ways to Leave Your Lover&quot;, reached the top spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. On May 3, 1976, Simon put together a benefit show at Madison Square Garden for the New York Public Library which raised over $30,000.

===1977–1985: &quot;One-Trick Pony&quot; and &quot;Hearts and Bones&quot;===
After releasing three successful studio albums, Simon worked in the second half of the 1970s on various projects, including writing music for the film &quot;Shampoo&quot;, which became the music for the song &quot;Silent Eyes&quot; on the &quot;Still Crazy&quot; album, and acting (he was cast as Tony Lacey in Woody Allen&#x27;s film &quot;Annie Hall&quot;). He achieved another hit with &quot;Slip Slidin&#x27; Away&quot;, the lead single of his 1977 compilation &quot;Greatest Hits, Etc.&quot;, which reached number 5 in the United States.

In 1980, Simon released &quot;One-Trick Pony&quot;, his first album with Warner Bros. Records and his first in almost five years. The album was paired with the motion picture of the same name, which Simon wrote and starred in. It produced his last Top 10 hit, the upbeat &quot;Late in the Evening&quot; (also a number 1 hit on the Radio &amp; Records American charts), but did not sell well.

In 1981, Simon &amp; Garfunkel included eight songs from Simon&#x27;s solo career in the set list of their September 19 concert in Central Park. Five were rearranged as duets and Simon performed the other three solo. The resulting live album, TV special and videocassette (later DVD) releases were all major hits.

Following the success of The Concert in Central Park, Simon &amp; Garfunkel returned to the studio, planning to record an album of new material. This would have been their first new recordings as a duo since their hit single &quot;My Little Town&quot; in 1975 and their first album of new material since &quot;Bridge over Troubled Water&quot; in 1970. Simon ultimately decided to wipe Garfunkel&#x27;s vocals from the mix, and in 1983, Simon released the album &quot;Hearts and Bones&quot; as a solo album. This was a polished and confessional album that was eventually viewed as one of his best works, but it achieved the lowest sales of his career. &quot;Hearts and Bones&quot; included &quot;The Late Great Johnny Ace&quot;, a song partly about Johnny Ace, an American R&amp;B singer, and partly about John Lennon. In January 1985, Simon performed for USA for Africa and on the relief fundraising single &quot;We Are the World&quot;.

===1986–1992: &quot;Graceland&quot; and &quot;The Rhythm of the Saints&quot;===
In 1986, Simon was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Music degree from Berklee College of Music, where he had served on the board of trustees.

Simon decided to record an album of South African music after hearing a bootlegged tape of &quot;mbaqanga&quot;, South African street music, and in 1986 he traveled to Johannesburg and recorded with African musicians. Additional sessions were held in New York. The sessions featured many South African acts, particularly Ladysmith Black Mambazo, and Simon also collaborated with several American artists, singing a duet with Linda Ronstadt in &quot;Under African Skies&quot;, and playing with Los Lobos in &quot;All Around the World or The Myth of Fingerprints&quot;. Before leaving for Johannesburg, Simon contributed to &quot;We Are the World&quot;, a charity single for African famine relief.

The resulting album, &quot;Graceland&quot;, became Simon&#x27;s most successful studio album and his highest-charting album in over a decade. It was estimated to have sold more than 16 million copies worldwide. &quot;Graceland&quot; won the 1987 Grammy for Album of the Year. In 2006, the album was added to the United States&#x27; National Recording Registry as &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically important&quot;.

Simon faced accusations that he had broken the cultural boycott imposed by the rest of the world against the apartheid regime in South Africa by organizations such as Artists United Against Apartheid, anti-apartheid musicians (including Billy Bragg, Paul Weller and Jerry Dammers), and James Victor Gbeho (then Ghanaian Ambassador to the United Nations). Simon denied that he had gone to South Africa to &quot;take money out of the country&quot;, and stated that he paid the black artists and split royalties with them, and was not paid to play to a white-only audience. The United Nations Anti-Apartheid Committee supported &quot;Graceland&quot;, as it showcased black South African musicians and offered no support to the South African government, but the African National Congress protested that it was a violation of the boycott. The Congress voted to ban Simon from South Africa and he was added to the United Nations blacklist, from which he was removed in January 1987. In 1989, Simon appeared on Dion&#x27;s song &quot;Written on the Subway Wall&quot;/&quot;Little Star&quot; from &quot;Yo Frankie&quot; which peaked at number 97 in October 1990.

After &quot;Graceland&quot;, Simon extended his roots with the Brazilian-flavored &quot;The Rhythm of the Saints&quot;. Sessions for the album began in December 1989 in Rio de Janeiro and New York and featured guitarist J.J. Cale, and Brazilian and African musicians. The tone of the album was more introspective and low-key than the upbeat feel of &quot;Graceland&quot;. Released in October 1990, the album received excellent reviews and sold well, peaking at number 4 in the U.S. and number 1 in the UK. The lead single, &quot;The Obvious Child&quot;, featuring the Grupo Cultural Olodum, became Simon&#x27;s last Top 20 hit in the UK and appeared near the bottom of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Although not as successful as &quot;Graceland&quot;, &quot;The Rhythm of the Saints&quot; received a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year. Simon&#x27;s ex-wife Carrie Fisher said in her autobiography &quot;Wishful Drinking&quot;, that the song &quot;She Moves On&quot; was about her. &quot;If you can get Paul Simon to write a song about you, do it. Because he is so brilliant at it.&quot;

The success of both albums allowed Simon to stage another concert in New York. On August 15, 1991, almost a decade after his concert with Garfunkel, Simon staged a second concert in Central Park with African and South American bands. The success of the concert surpassed all expectations, and over 750,000 people were reported to have attended, making it one of the largest concert audiences in history. He later remembered the concert as &quot;the most memorable moment in my career.&quot; The success of the show led to a live album and an Emmy-winning TV special. Simon embarked on the &quot;Born at the Right Time Tour&quot; and promoted the album with further singles, including &quot;Proof&quot;, which was accompanied by a humorous video that featured Chevy Chase and Steve Martin. On March 4, 1992, Simon performed in his own episode of &quot;MTV Unplugged.&quot; Simon and Garfunkel were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990.

===1993–1998: &quot;Paul Simon 1964/1993&quot; and &quot;The Capeman&quot;===
Another Simon &amp; Garfunkel reunion took place in September 1993 and Columbia released &quot;Paul Simon 1964/1993&quot;. Originally a three-disc compilation, this became a reduced version on the two-disc album &quot;The Paul Simon Anthology&quot; one month later. In 1995, Simon appeared on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; and performed the song &quot;Ten Years&quot;, which he had composed for the tenth anniversary of the show. In 1995 he also featured in the Annie Lennox version of his 1973 song &quot;Something So Right&quot;, which appeared briefly on the UK Top 50 after it was released as a single.

Simon had been involved in creating a musical, &quot;The Capeman&quot;, that eventually opened on January 29, 1998. He had worked enthusiastically on the project for many years, and described it as &quot;a New York Puerto Rican story based on events that happened in 1959—events that I remembered.&quot; The musical told the story of a real-life Puerto Rican youth, Salvador Agron, who wore a cape while committing two murders in New York in 1959. He became a writer while in prison. Featuring Marc Anthony as the young Agron, and Rubén Blades as the older Agron, the play was not a success and received terrible reviews and poor box office receipts.

Simon recorded an album of songs from the show which was released in November 1997. The album received mixed reviews. Some critics praised the combination of doo-wop, rockabilly and Caribbean music that the album contained, but &quot;Songs from The Capeman&quot; was a failure, and for the first time in Simon&#x27;s career he did not reach the Top 40 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. The cast album was never released on CD but eventually became available online.

===1999–2007: &quot;You&#x27;re the One&quot; and &quot;Surprise&quot;===
After &quot;The Capeman&quot;, Simon&#x27;s career was in an unexpected crisis, but he continued to record new material. In 1999, he embarked on a three-month North American tour with Bob Dylan, in which he and Dylan alternated as the headline act with a middle section where they performed together. The collaboration was generally well-received, with just one critic, Seth Rogovoy of the &quot;Berkshire Eagle&quot;, questioning the collaboration.

In 2000, Simon wrote and recorded a new album, &quot;You&#x27;re the One&quot;, very quickly. The album was released in October and consisted mostly of folk-pop writing combined with foreign musical sounds, particularly grooves from North Africa. &quot;You&#x27;re the One&quot; received favorable reviews, reached both the British and American Top 20, and received a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year. Simon toured extensively to promote the album, and one performance in Paris was released to home video.

In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in America, Simon sang &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot; on &quot;&quot;, a multi-network broadcast to benefit the September 11 Telethon Fund, and performed &quot;The Boxer&quot; at the start of the first episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; after September 11. In 2002, he wrote and recorded &quot;Father and Daughter&quot;, the theme song for the animated family film &quot;The Wild Thornberrys Movie&quot;. The track was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Song.

In 2003, Simon and Garfunkel performed together again when they received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. This reunion led to a US tour, the acclaimed &quot;Old Friends&quot; concert series, which was followed by a 2004 international encore, culminating in a free concert at the Colosseum in Rome which attracted an audience of 600,000. In 2005, they sang &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot; and &quot;Homeward Bound&quot; together, plus &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot; with Aaron Neville, in the benefit concert &quot;From the Big Apple to The Big Easy – The Concert for New Orleans&quot; (eventually released as a DVD) for Hurricane Katrina victims.

In 2004, Simon&#x27;s studio albums were re-released, both individually and as a collection in a limited-edition, nine-CD boxed set, &quot;Paul Simon: The Studio Recordings 1972–2000&quot;. Simon was then working on a new album with Brian Eno called &quot;Surprise&quot;, which was released in May 2006. Most of the songs on the album were inspired by the September 11 terrorist attacks, and the Iraq invasion and the war that followed. Simon also took inspiration from having reached the age of 60 in 2001, which he humorously referred to in &quot;Old&quot; from &quot;You&#x27;re the One&quot;. &quot;Surprise&quot; was a commercial hit, reaching number 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number 4 in the UK. Most critics praised the album, and Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic wrote &quot;Simon doesn&#x27;t achieve his comeback by reconnecting with the sound and spirit of his classic work; he has achieved it by being as restless and ambitious as he was at his popular and creative peak.&quot; The album was supported by the Surprise Tour in 2006.

In March 2004, Walter Yetnikoff published a book called &quot;Howling at the Moon&quot;, in which he criticized Simon and his previous business partnership with Columbia Records. In 2007, Simon was the inaugural recipient of the Gershwin Prize for Popular Song, awarded by the Library of Congress, and he later performed as part of a gala of his work.

===2008–2013: &quot;So Beautiful or So What&quot; and touring===
After living in Montauk, New York, for many years, Simon relocated to New Canaan, Connecticut. Simon is one of a small number of performers who are named as the copyright owner on their recordings (most records have the recording company as the named owner of the recording). This development followed the successful $200 million lawsuit against RSO Records by the Bee Gees, the largest successful lawsuit against a record company by an artist or group. All of Simon&#x27;s solo recordings, including those originally issued by Columbia Records, are currently distributed by Sony Records&#x27; Legacy Recordings unit. His albums were issued by Warner Music Group until mid-2010, when Simon moved his catalog of solo work from Warner Bros. Records to Sony/Columbia Records, which holds the Simon &amp; Garfunkel catalog.

In February 2009, Simon performed back-to-back shows in New York City at the recently renovated Beacon Theatre. He was joined by Art Garfunkel and the cast of &quot;The Capeman&quot; in the first show. The band included &quot;Graceland&quot; bassist Bakithi Kumalo. In May 2009, Simon toured with Garfunkel in Australia, New Zealand and Japan; and in October 2009 they appeared together at the 25th anniversary of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame concert at Madison Square Garden in New York City. In October 2009, Dion performed &quot;The Wanderer&quot; with Simon at the 25th Anniversary Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Concert. In April 2010, Simon &amp; Garfunkel performed together again at the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival.

Simon released a new song called &quot;Getting Ready for Christmas Day&quot; on November 10, 2010. The song was premiered on National Public Radio, and was included on the album &quot;So Beautiful or So What&quot;. The song sampled a 1941 sermon by the Rev. J. M. Gates. Simon performed the song live on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; on December 16, 2010. In the first show of the final season of &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; on September 10, 2010, Simon performed a song that commemorated the show&#x27;s 25 years, an update of a song he wrote for the show&#x27;s 10th anniversary. Simon&#x27;s next album, &quot;So Beautiful or So What&quot;, was released on the Concord Music Group label on April 12, 2011, and Simon said it was the best work he had done in 20 years. It was reported that he had wanted to have Bob Dylan perform on the album.

At the end of his 2011 World Tour, which had included the United States, the UK, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Germany, Simon appeared at Ramat Gan Stadium in Israel in July 2011, his first concert appearance in Israel since 1983. On the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks in 2011, he performed &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot; at the National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum in New York, on the site of the destroyed World Trade Center.

On February 26, 2012, Simon paid tribute to fellow musicians Chuck Berry and Leonard Cohen, who had received the first annual PEN Awards for songwriting excellence at the JFK Presidential Library in Boston, Massachusetts.

In 2012, Simon released a 25th anniversary box set of &quot;Graceland&quot; which included a remastered edition of the original album; the 2012 documentary film &quot;Under African Skies;&quot; the original 1987 &quot;African Concert&quot; from Zimbabwe; and an audio narrative, &quot;The Story of Graceland&quot;, related by Simon; as well other interviews and memorabilia. He played a few concerts in Europe with the original musicians to commemorate the anniversary. On December 19, 2012, Simon performed at the funeral of Victoria Leigh Soto, a teacher killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. On June 14, 2013, on Sting&#x27;s Back to Bass Tour, Simon performed &quot;The Boxer&quot; and Sting&#x27;s &quot;Fields of Gold&quot; with Sting. In September 2013, Simon delivered the Richard Ellmann Lecture in Modern Literature at Emory University.

===2014–2022: &quot;Stranger to Stranger&quot; and &quot;In the Blue Light&quot;===
In 2014, Simon embarked on a joint 21-date concert tour of North America, titled On Stage Together, with English musician Sting. The tour continued in 2015 with ten shows in Australia and New Zealand and 23 concerts in Europe.

Simon made a surprise appearance in &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot; on September 11, 2015. He performed &quot;Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard&quot; with Colbert, having been billed before the show as a Simon &amp; Garfunkel Tribute Band. He also performed &quot;An American Tune&quot;, which was posted on the show&#x27;s YouTube channel. In 2015, Dion released the single &quot;New York Is My Home&quot; with Simon.

Simon wrote and performed the theme song for comedian Louis C.K.&#x27;s show &quot;Horace and Pete&quot;, which debuted on January 30, 2016. The song was heard during the show&#x27;s opening, intermission and closing credits and featured Simon&#x27;s voice and acoustic guitar. Simon made a cameo appearance onscreen in the final episode of the series. On June 3, 2016, Simon released his thirteenth solo studio album, &quot;Stranger to Stranger&quot;, through Concord Records&quot;.&quot;

In 2011, Simon was introduced to Italian electronic dance music artist Clap! Clap! by his son, Adrian, who was a fan of his work. They met in 2011 when Simon was touring &quot;So Beautiful or So What&quot; in Italy. Simon collaborated with him on three songs, and also worked with longtime friend Roy Halee, who co-produced the album. After the release of the album, Simon said he was no longer interested in showbiz and talked about retirement. He said, &quot;I am going to see what happens if I let go&quot;.

Simon performed &quot;Bridge over Troubled Water&quot; at the 2016 Democratic National Convention on July 25, 2016. He debuted a new version of &quot;Questions for the Angels&quot; with jazz guitarist Bill Frisell on &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot; on May 24, 2017.

On February 5, 2018, Simon announced his intention to retire from touring, citing time away from his family and the death of longtime guitarist Vincent Nguini. He did not rule out performing live again. He began a farewell concert tour, Homeward Bound – The Farewell Tour, in May 2018 in Vancouver, Canada, and performed shows across North America and Europe. He played his final concert in Queens, New York, on September 22, 2018.

In 2018, Simon released his fourteenth solo studio album, &quot;In the Blue Light&quot;, which consisted of re-recordings of lesser-known songs from his catalog, some with altered arrangements, harmonic structures and lyrics. On August 11, 2019, he returned to live performance when he closed San Francisco&#x27;s &quot;Outside Lands&quot; festival in Golden Gate Park. He said he planned to donate his net proceeds to local environmental non-profit organizations.

&quot;American Songwriter&quot; honored Dion&#x27;s &quot;Song for Sam Cooke (Here in America)&quot;, featuring Simon, as the &quot;Greatest of the Great 2020 Songs&quot;. Simon sold his music publishing catalog to Sony Music Publishing in March 2021. He was previously signed to Universal Music Publishing Group.

===2023–present: &quot;Seven Psalms&quot; and return to touring===
Simon released a new album, &quot;Seven Psalms&quot;, in April 2023. A documentary of the project, &quot;In Restless Dreams: The Music of Paul Simon&quot;, was made by Alex Gibney. The album was described as 33 minutes of uninterrupted musical meditation, consisting of seven pieces performed on acoustic guitar, linked by a motif derived from &quot;Anji&quot;, with elements of folk, blues and jazz, and with lyrics that reflected on life, death and faith. The inspiration for the album came to Simon in 2020. He recalled, &quot;I had a dream so vivid it made me get up in the middle of the night and write it down ... a voice said &#x27;You are meant to be working on a piece called &#x27;Seven Psalms&#x27;.&quot;

For the next few months, isolated by the pandemic on a ranch in Texas, Simon worked on a series of guitar pieces, and added sounds like distant church bells produced by amplified upside-down wine glasses. He said, &quot;I envisioned &quot;Seven Psalms&quot; as one long thought, combined with sounds powerful enough to make the thought come alive.&quot; In early December 2023, Simon rehearsed &quot;Seven Psalms&quot; with two acoustic guitarists. He said he was missing performing, and hoped that it might be possible to play the album live.

Simon planned to retire from music, but after the success of &quot;Seven Psalms&quot; he completed another song, composed four more guitar pieces, and was making plans for an album of duets with his partner, singer Edie Brickell. He was also in the early stages of working on a musical. In May 2023, Simon revealed during an interview with &quot;The Times&quot; that he had lost most of the hearing in his left ear. In February 2025, Simon performed &quot;Homeward Bound&quot; with Sabrina Carpenter at a 50th-anniversary special for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. That month, Simon announced the Quiet Celebration Tour, comprising performances in smaller venues in cities across the US and Canada.

==Songwriting==
In 2012, in an interview reprinted in &quot;American Songwriter&quot;, Simon discussed the craft of songwriting with music journalist Tom Moon and talked about the basic themes in his songwriting: love, family and social commentary, as well as messages of religion, spirituality and God. Simon explained how he wrote his songs. &quot;The music always precedes the words. The words often come from the sound of the music and eventually evolve into coherent thoughts. Or incoherent thoughts. Rhythm plays a crucial part in the lyric-making as well. It&#x27;s like a puzzle to find the right words to express what the music is saying.&quot;

==Projects==
===Music for Broadway===
In the late 1990s, Simon wrote and produced a Broadway musical called &quot;The Capeman&quot;, which lost $11 million during its 1998 run. In April 2008, the Brooklyn Academy of Music celebrated Paul Simon&#x27;s works, and dedicated a week to &quot;Songs From the Capeman&quot;, with some of the show&#x27;s songs performed by a cast of singers and the Spanish Harlem Orchestra. Simon appeared during the BAM shows, performing &quot;Trailways Bus&quot; and &quot;Late in the Evening&quot;. In August 2010, &quot;The Capeman&quot; was staged for three nights in the Delacorte Theatre in New York&#x27;s Central Park. The production was directed by Diane Paulus and produced in conjunction with the Public Theater.

===Film and television===
Simon has also had several acting roles in films and television shows. He played music producer Tony Lacey, a supporting character in the 1977 Woody Allen feature film &quot;Annie Hall&quot;, and made a cameo appearance in the movie &quot;The Rutles: All You Need Is Cash&quot; the following year. He later wrote and starred in 1980&#x27;s &quot;One Trick Pony&quot; as Jonah Levin, a journeyman rock-and-roller, and wrote all the songs in the film. In 1981 he appeared in an episode of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, the only episode of the series to use the songs of one songwriter. He appeared in several episodes of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; in the 1970s and 1980s, including in a memorable performance of &quot;Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard&quot; in 1977, and a cameo appearance in the song &quot;Put Down the Duckie!&quot; in 1986.

In the 1990s and 2000s, Simon played the character of Simple Simon in the Disney Channel TV movie &quot;Mother Goose Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Rhyme&quot;, and provided cameos in &quot;Millennium&quot; and &quot;The Great Buck Howard&quot;. In the 2010s he appeared briefly in shows such as &quot;Portlandia&quot;, &quot;Welcome to Sweden&quot; and &quot;Horace &amp; Pete&quot;. He appeared as an interviewee and as a musical guest on talk shows such as &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot;, &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;, &quot;The Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;, &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot; and &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;. He was the subject of two films by Jeremy Marre on the making of &quot;Graceland&quot; and &quot;The Capeman&quot;.

===&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;===
Simon was the host of the second episode of &quot;SNL&quot;, on October 18, 1975.

Simon appeared alongside George Harrison on the Thanksgiving Day episode of &quot;SNL&quot; on November 20, 1976, and they performed &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; and &quot;Homeward Bound&quot; together. Simon performed &quot;50 Ways to Leave Your Lover&quot; earlier in the show. Simon opened the show in a comedy sketch in which he performed &quot;Still Crazy After All These Years&quot; in a turkey outfit, Thanksgiving being the following week. Halfway through the song, he told the band to stop playing because he was embarrassed, gave a speech to the audience and left the stage. Lorne Michaels greeted him backstage, but Simon, still acting upset, yelled at him because of the humiliating turkey outfit. This was one of &quot;SNL&quot;″s most replayed sketches.

In one &quot;SNL&quot; skit from 1986, when he was promoting &quot;Graceland&quot;, Simon played himself waiting in line with a friend to get into a movie. He amazed his friend by remembering intricate details about prior meetings with passers-by, but drew a complete blank when he was approached by Art Garfunkel. When Simon hosted an &quot;SNL&quot; episode during the 1988 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Simon walked out with Illinois Senator and presidential candidate Paul Simon, and argued about which Paul Simon was supposed to have hosting duties.

Simon closed the 40th anniversary &quot;SNL&quot; show on February 15, 2015, with a performance of &quot;Still Crazy After All These Years&quot;. He played a snippet of &quot;I&#x27;ve Just Seen a Face&quot; with Sir Paul McCartney during the introductory sequence. Much of the Thanksgiving episode from 1976 was shown during this prime-time special. His most recent &quot;SNL&quot; appearance was on October 13, 2018, when he was the musical guest on his 77th birthday.

On February 16, 2025, Paul Simon performed &quot;Homeward Bound&quot; alongside Sabrina Carpenter for the opening of the &quot;Saturday Night Live 50th Anniversary Special&quot;.

==Awards and honors==
Simon has earned sixteen Grammy Awards for his solo and collaborative work, including three for Album of the Year (&quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot;, 1971; &quot;Still Crazy After All These Years&quot;, 1976&quot;;&quot; and &quot;Graceland&quot;, 1988), and a Lifetime Achievement Award. He is one of only eight artists to have won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year more than once as the main credited artist.

In 1998, Simon was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame for the Simon &amp; Garfunkel album &quot;Bridge over Troubled Water&quot;. In 2002, he received an Oscar nomination for Best Original Song for his song &quot;Father and Daughter&quot;.

Simon has twice been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame: in 1990 as a member of Simon &amp; Garfunkel; and in 2001 for his solo career. In 2006, he was named as one of the &quot;100 People Who Shaped the World&quot; by &quot;Time&quot;. In 2011, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named him one of the 100 greatest guitarists, and in 2015 he was ranked 8th in their list of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time. In 2023, he was ranked the 246th greatest guitarist of all time by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. He was the first recipient of the Library of Congress&#x27;s Gershwin Prize for Popular Song in 2007.

In 2001, Simon was honored as MusiCares Person of the Year. In 2002 he was one of five recipients of the annual Kennedy Center Honors, the nation&#x27;s highest tribute to performing and cultural artists.

In 2005, Simon was honored at the 53rd Annual BMI Pop Awards. His songwriting catalog had earned 39 BMI Awards, including numerous citations for &quot;Bridge over Troubled Water&quot;, &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot;, &quot;Scarborough Fair&quot; and &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot;. By 2005, he had amassed nearly 75 million broadcast airplays, according to BMI surveys. In 2006, he was selected by &quot;Time Magazine&quot; as one of the &quot;100 People Who Shaped the World&quot;.

In 2007, Simon received the first annual Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song. Named in honor of George and Ira Gershwin, this award recognized the profound and positive effect of popular music on the world&#x27;s culture. Simon said, &quot;I am grateful to be the recipient of the Gershwin Prize and doubly honored to be the first. I look forward to spending an evening in the company of artists I admire at the award ceremony in May. I can think of a few [artists] who have expressed my words and music far better than I [have]. I&#x27;m excited at the prospect of that happening again. It&#x27;s a songwriter&#x27;s dream come true.&quot; Among the performers who paid tribute to Simon were Stevie Wonder, Alison Krauss, Jerry Douglas, Lyle Lovett, James Taylor, Dianne Reeves, Marc Anthony, Yolanda Adams and Ladysmith Black Mambazo. The event was professionally filmed and broadcast and was released as &quot;Paul Simon and Friends&quot;. In 2012, Simon was awarded the Polar Music Prize.

==Personal life==
When Simon moved to England in 1964, he met Kathleen Mary &quot;Kathy&quot; Chitty at the first English folk club he played, the Railway Inn Folk Club in Brentwood, Essex, where Chitty worked part-time selling tickets. She was 16 and he was 22 when they began a relationship. Later that year they visited the U.S. together, mainly touring by bus. Kathy returned to England and Simon followed some weeks later. When he returned to the U.S. with the growing success of &quot;The Sounds of Silence&quot;, Kathy, who was quite shy, wanted no part in success and fame and they ended their relationship. She is mentioned by name in at least two of Simon&#x27;s songs: &quot;Kathy&#x27;s Song&quot; and &quot;America&quot;. She is also referred to in &quot;Homeward Bound&quot; and &quot;The Late Great Johnny Ace&quot;. There is a photo of Simon and Kathy together on the cover of Simon&#x27;s 1965 album &quot;The Paul Simon Songbook&quot;.

Simon has been married three times, first to Peggy Harper in 1969. They had a son, Harper Simon, in 1972, and divorced in 1975, inspiring the song &quot;50 Ways to Leave Your Lover&quot;. Simon wrote about this relationship in the song &quot;Train in the Distance&quot; from his 1983 album &quot;Hearts and Bones&quot;. In the late 1970s, Simon lived in New York City next door to &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; creator Lorne Michaels, who has been described as Simon&#x27;s &quot;best friend&quot; during the period.

Simon met actress Shelley Duvall while filming &quot;Annie Hall&quot; in 1976. They lived together as a couple for two years until Duvall introduced him to her friend actress Carrie Fisher. Simon and Fisher began dating in 1978, and were married from 1983 to 1984. He proposed to her after a New York Yankees game. The song &quot;Hearts and Bones&quot; was written about their time together, and the song &quot;Graceland&quot; is believed to be about seeking solace from the ending of the relationship by taking a road trip. A year after they divorced, Simon and Fisher resumed their relationship, which lasted for several years.

Simon married singer Edie Brickell on May 30, 1992. Brickell and Simon have three children, Adrian, Lulu, and Gabriel. On April 26, 2014, Simon and Brickell were involved in a domestic dispute. Each was issued a summons to appear in court on disorderly conduct charges.

All four of his children are now adults and are musicians.

Simon and his younger brother, Eddie Simon, founded the Guitar Study Center sometime before 1973. The Guitar Study Center became part of The New School in New York City, sometime before 2002.

Simon is an avid fan of the New York Rangers ice hockey team, the New York Knicks basketball team and the New York Yankees baseball team.

==Philanthropy==
Simon is an advocate of music education for children. In 1970, after recording &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot;, he held auditions for a young songwriters&#x27; workshop at the invitation of the NYU&#x27;s Tisch School of the Arts. The auditions were advertised in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, and brought hundreds of hopefuls to perform. Among the six teenage songwriters selected for tutelage were Melissa Manchester, Tommy Mandel and rock/beat poet Joe Linus. Maggie and Terre Roche (the Roche Sisters), who later sang back-up for Simon, joined the workshop in progress in an impromptu appearance.

Simon invited the six teenagers to experience the recording process at Columbia studios with engineer Roy Halee. During these sessions, Bob Dylan was downstairs recording his album &quot;Self-Portrait&quot;, which included a version of Simon&#x27;s &quot;The Boxer&quot;. Violinist Isaac Stern visited the group with a CBS film crew and spoke to the young musicians about lyrics and music.

Manchester later paid homage to Simon with her recorded song &quot;Ode to Paul&quot;. Other musicians Simon mentored include Nick Laird-Clowes, who co-founded the band the Dream Academy. Laird-Clowes credited Simon with helping to shape the band&#x27;s biggest hit, &quot;Life in a Northern Town&quot;.

In 2003, Simon became a supporter of Little Kids Rock, a nonprofit organization that provided free musical instruments and free lessons to children in public schools in the U.S. He sits on the organization&#x27;s board of directors as an honorary member.

Simon is also a major benefactor and one of the co-founders, with Irwin Redlener, of the Children&#x27;s Health Project and The Children&#x27;s Health Fund which began by creating specially equipped buses to take medical care to children in medically under-served areas, both urban and rural. Their first bus was placed in the impoverished South Bronx of New York City, but the buses now operate in 12 states, including on the Gulf Coast. The project has expanded greatly and partners with major hospitals, local public schools and medical schools, and advocates policy for children&#x27;s health and medical care.

In May 2012, Paul Simon performed at a benefit dinner for the Turkana Basin Institute in New York City, raising more than $2 million for Richard Leakey&#x27;s research institute in Africa. For his 2019 performance at San Francisco&#x27;s Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival, Simon donated his appearance fee to the San Francisco Parks Alliance and Friends of the Urban Forest.

==Discography==

This discography does not include compilation albums, concert albums or work with Simon &amp; Garfunkel.
Simon&#x27;s solo concert albums often have songs he originally recorded with Simon &amp; Garfunkel, and many Simon &amp; Garfunkel concert albums contain songs Simon first recorded on solo albums.

Simon has a few songs that appear on compilation albums and nowhere else, such as &quot;Slip Slidin&#x27; Away&quot;, which first appeared on the compilation album &quot;Greatest Hits, Etc.&quot; (1977) and has since been included in subsequent compilations such as &quot;Negotiations and Love Songs&quot; (1988).

<text>The Paris Métro (, ), short for Métropolitain (), is a rapid transit system serving the Paris metropolitan area in France. A symbol of the city, it is known for its density within the capital&#x27;s territorial limits, uniform architecture and historical entrances influenced by Art Nouveau. The system is long, mostly underground. It has 321 stations of which 61 have transfers between lines. The Métro has sixteen lines (with an additional four under construction), numbered 1 to 14, with two lines, Line 3bis and Line 7bis, named because they used to be part of Line 3 and Line 7, respectively. Three lines (1, 4 and 14) are automated. Lines are identified on maps by number and colour, with the direction of travel indicated by the terminus. The Métro is operated by &quot;Régie autonome des transports parisiens&quot; (RATP), which also operates part of the RER network, light rail lines and many bus routes.

It is the second-busiest metro system in Europe, after the Moscow Metro, as well as the tenth-busiest in the world. It carried 1.498 billion passengers in 2019, roughly 4.1 million passengers a day, which makes it the most used public transport system in Paris. It is one of the densest metro systems in the world, with 244 stations within the of the City of Paris. Châtelet–Les Halles, with five Métro and three RER commuter rail lines, is one of the world&#x27;s largest metro stations. The system generally has poor accessibility since most infrastructure was built before accessibility standards emerged, and few stations have been retrofitted.

The first line opened without ceremony on 19 July 1900, during the World&#x27;s Fair (). The system expanded quickly until World War I and the core was complete by the 1920s; extensions into suburbs were built in the 1930s. The network reached saturation after World War II with new trains to allow higher traffic, but further improvements have been limited by the design of the network and, in particular, the short distances between stations. In 1998, Line 14 was put into service to relieve RER A. Line 11 reaching in 2024 is the network&#x27;s most recent extension. A large expansion programme known as the Grand Paris Express (GPE) is currently under construction with four new orbital Métro lines (15, 16, 17 and 18) around the Île-de-France region, outside the Paris city limits. Further plans exist for Line 1, Line 7, Line 10, a merger of Line 3bis and Line 7bis, Line 12, as well as a new proposed Line 19 in the city&#x27;s outer suburbs.

Besides the Métro, central Paris and its urban area are served by five RER lines (602 km or 374 mi with 257 stations), fourteen tramway lines (186.6 km or 115.9 mi with 278 stations), nine Transilien suburban trains (1,299 km or 807 mi with 392 stations), in addition to three VAL lines at Charles de Gaulle Airport and Orly Airport, making Paris one of the cities in the world best served by public transportation. Despite the network&#x27;s uniform architecture, several of its stations stand out at the hand of their unique design. The Métro itself has become an icon in popular culture, being frequently featured in cinema and mentioned in music. In 2021, the RATP started offering an umbrella lending service at several Métro and RER stations, highlighting the Métro&#x27;s own rabbit mascot, which advises children on staying away from the closing doors.

== Naming ==

Métro is the abbreviated name of the company that originally operated most of the network: the Empain group subsidiary &quot;Compagnie du chemin de fer métropolitain de Paris S.A.&quot; (&quot;Paris Metropolitan Railway Company Ltd&quot;), also known as CMP. The name was directly inspired by the 1863 London Metropolitan Railway (&quot;&quot;), which had been commonly abbreviated as &quot;métropolitain&quot; in French since the late Second Empire. 

CMP was known as &quot;Le Métropolitain&quot;, which quickly became abbreviated to &quot;Métro,&quot; which became a common designation and brand name for rapid transit systems in France and in many cities elsewhere. &#x27;Metro&#x27; has been adopted in many languages, making it the most used word for a (generally underground) urban transit system.

The Métro is operated by the &quot;Régie autonome des transports parisiens&quot; (RATP), a public transport authority that also operates part of the RER network, light rail lines and many bus routes. 

== History ==
By 1845, Paris and the railway companies were already thinking about an urban railway system to link inner districts of the city. The railway companies and the French government wanted to extend mainline railways into a new underground network, whereas the Parisians favoured a new and independent network and feared national takeover of any system it built. The disagreement lasted from 1856 to 1890. Meanwhile, the population became denser and traffic congestion grew massively. The deadlock put pressure on the authorities and gave the city the green light.

Prior to 1845, the urban transport network consisted primarily of a large number of omnibus lines, consolidated by the French government into a regulated system with fixed and unconflicting routes and schedules. The first concrete proposal for an urban rail system in Paris was put forward by civil engineer Florence de Kérizouet. This plan called for a surface cable car system. In 1855, civil engineers Edouard Brame and Eugène Flachat proposed an underground freight urban railway, due to the high rate of accidents on surface rail lines. On 19 November 1871 the General Council of the Seine commissioned a team of 40 engineers to plan an urban rail network. This team proposed a network with a pattern of routes &quot;resembling a cross enclosed in a circle&quot; with axial routes following large boulevards. On 11 May 1872 the Council endorsed the plan, but the French government turned down the plan. After this point, a serious debate occurred over whether the new system should consist of elevated lines or of mostly underground lines; this debate involved numerous parties in France, including Victor Hugo, Guy de Maupassant, and the Eiffel Society of Gustave Eiffel, and continued until 1892. Eventually the underground option emerged as the preferred solution because of the high cost of buying land for rights-of-way in central Paris required for elevated lines, estimated at 70,000 francs per metre of line for a -wide railway.

The last remaining hurdle was the city&#x27;s concern about national interference in its urban rail system. The city commissioned renowned engineer Jean-Baptiste Berlier, who designed Paris&#x27; postal network of pneumatic tubes, to design and plan its rail system in the early 1890s. Berlier recommended a special track gauge of (versus the standard gauge of ) to protect the system from national takeover, which inflamed the issue substantially. The issue was finally settled when the Minister of Public Works begrudgingly recognised the city&#x27;s right to build a local system on 22 November 1895, and by the city&#x27;s secret designing of the trains and tunnels to be too narrow for mainline trains, while adopting standard gauge as a compromise with the state.

=== Fulgence Bienvenüe project ===
On 20 April 1896, Paris adopted the Fulgence Bienvenüe project, which was to serve only the city proper of Paris. Many Parisians worried that extending lines to industrial suburbs would reduce the safety of the city. Paris forbade lines to the inner suburbs and, as a guarantee, Métro trains were to run on the right, as opposed to existing suburban lines, which ran on the left.

Unlike many other subway systems (such as that of London), this system was designed from the outset as a unified system, initially of nine lines. Such a large project required a private-public arrangement right from the outset – the city would build most of the permanent way, while a private concessionaire company would supply the trains and power stations, and lease the system (each line separately, for initially 39-year leases). In July 1897, six bidders competed, and The Compagnie Generale de Traction, owned by the Belgian Baron Édouard Empain,
won the contract; this company was then immediately reorganised as the Compagnie du chemin de fer métropolitain.

Construction began in November 1898. The first line, Porte Maillot–Porte de Vincennes, was inaugurated on 19 July 1900 during the Paris World&#x27;s Fair. Entrances to stations were designed in Art Nouveau style by Hector Guimard. Eighty-six of his entrances are still in existence.

Bienvenüe&#x27;s project consisted of 10 lines, which correspond to current Lines 1 to 9. Construction was so intense that by 1920, despite a few changes from schedule, most lines had been completed. The shield method of construction was rejected in favor of the cut-and-cover method in order to speed up work. Bienvenüe, a highly regarded engineer, designed a special procedure of building the tunnels to allow the swift repaving of roads, and is credited with a largely swift and relatively uneventful construction through the difficult and heterogeneous soils and rocks.

Line 1 and Line 4 were conceived as central east–west and north–south lines. Two lines, &quot;ligne 2 Nord&quot; (Line 2 North) and &quot;ligne 2 Sud&quot; (Line 2 South), were also planned but Line 2 South was merged with Line 5 in 1906. Line 3 was an additional east–west line to the north of line 1 and line 5 an additional north to south line to the east of Line 4. Line 6 would run from Nation to Place d&#x27;Italie. Lines 7, 8 and 9 would connect commercial and office districts around the Opéra to residential areas in the north-east and the south-west. Bienvenüe also planned a circular line, the &quot;ligne circulaire intérieure&quot;, to connect the six mainline stations. A section opened in 1923 between Invalides and the Boulevard Saint-Germain before the plan was abandoned.

=== Nord-Sud competing network ===
On 31 January 1904, a second concession was granted to the &quot;Société du chemin de fer électrique souterrain Nord-Sud de Paris&quot; (Paris North-South underground electrical railway company), abbreviated to the &quot;Nord-Sud&quot; (North-South) company. It was responsible for building three proposed lines:
* Line A would join Montmartre to Montparnasse as an additional north–south line to the west of Line 4.
* Line B would serve the north-west of Paris by connecting Saint-Lazare station to Porte de Clichy and Porte de Saint-Ouen.
* Line C would serve the south-west by connecting Montparnasse station to Porte de Vanves. The aim was to connect Line B with Line C, but the CMP renamed Line B as Line 13 and Line C as Line 14. Both were connected by the RATP as the current Line 13.

Line A was inaugurated on 4 November 1910, after being postponed because of floods in January that year. Line B was inaugurated on 26 February 1911. Because of the high construction costs, the construction of line C was postponed. Nord-Sud and CMP used compatible trains that could be used on both networks, but CMP trains used 600 volts third rail, and NS −600 volts overhead wire and +600 volts third rail. This was necessary because of steep gradients on NS lines. NS distinguished itself from its competitor with the high-quality decoration of its stations, the trains&#x27; extreme comfort and pretty lighting.

Nord-Sud did not become profitable and bankruptcy became unavoidable. By the end of 1930, the CMP bought Nord-Sud. Line A became Line 12 and Line B Line 13. Line C was built and renamed Line 14; that line was reorganised in 1937 with Lines 8 and 10. This partial line is now the south part of Line 13.

The last Nord-Sud train set was decommissioned on 15 May 1972.

=== 1930–1950: first inner suburbs are reached ===

Bienvenüe&#x27;s project was nearly completed during the 1920s. Paris planned three new lines and extensions of most lines to the inner suburbs, despite the reluctance of Parisians. Bienvenüe&#x27;s inner circular line having been abandoned, the already-built portion between Duroc and Odéon for the creation of a new east–west line that became Line 10, extended west to Porte de Saint-Cloud and the inner suburbs of Boulogne.

The line C planned by Nord-Sud between Montparnasse station and Porte de Vanves was built as Line 14 (different from present Line 14). It extended north in encompassing the already-built portion between Invalides and Duroc, initially planned as part of the inner circular. The over-busy Belleville funicular tramway would be replaced by a new line, Line 11, extended to Châtelet. Lines 10, 11 and 14 were thus the three new lines envisaged under this plan.

Most lines would be extended to the inner suburbs. The first to leave the city proper was Line 9, extended in 1934 to Boulogne-Billancourt; more followed in the 1930s. World War II forced authorities to abandon projects such as the extension of Line 4 and Line 12 to the northern suburbs. By 1949, eight lines had been extended: Line 1 to Neuilly-sur-Seine and Vincennes, Line 3 to Levallois-Perret, Line 5 to Pantin, Line 7 to Ivry-sur-Seine, Line 8 to Charenton, Line 9 to Boulogne-Billancourt, Line 11 to Les Lilas and Line 12 to Issy-les-Moulineaux.

World War II had a massive impact on the Métro. Services were limited and many stations closed. The risk of bombing meant the service between Place d&#x27;Italie and Étoile was transferred from Line 5 to Line 6, so that most of the elevated portions of the Métro would be on Line 6. As a result, Lines 2 and 6 now form a circle. Most stations were too shallow to be used as bomb shelters. The French Resistance used the tunnels to conduct swift assaults throughout Paris.

It took a long time to recover after liberation in 1944. Many stations had not reopened by the 1960s and some closed for good. On 23 March 1948, the CMP (the underground) and the STCRP (bus and tramways) merged to form the RATP, which still operates the Métro.

=== 1960–1990: development of the RER ===

The network grew saturated during the 1950s. Outdated technology limited the number of trains, which led the RATP to stop extending lines and concentrate on modernisation. The MP 51 prototype was built, testing both rubber-tyred metro and basic automatic driving on the &quot;voie navette&quot;. The first replacements of the older Sprague trains began with experimental articulated trains and then with mainstream rubber-tyred Métro MP 55 and MP 59, some of the latter still in service (Line 11). Thanks to newer trains and better signalling, trains ran more frequently.

The population boomed from 1950 to 1980. Car ownership became more common and suburbs grew further from the centre of Paris. The main railway stations, termini of the suburban rail lines, were overcrowded during rush hour. The short distance between Métro stations slowed the network and made it unprofitable to build extensions. The solution in the 1960s was to revive a project abandoned at the end of the 19th century: joining suburban lines to new underground portions in the city centre as the Réseau Express Régional (regional express network; RER).
The RER plan initially included one east–west line and two north–south lines. RATP bought two unprofitable SNCF lines—the Ligne de Saint-Germain (westbound) and the Ligne de Vincennes (eastbound) with the intention of joining them and to serve multiple districts of central Paris with new underground stations. The new line created by this merger became Line A. The Ligne de Sceaux, which served the southern suburbs and was bought by the CMP in the 1930s, would be extended north to merge with a line of the SNCF and reach the new Charles de Gaulle Airport in Roissy. This became Line B. These new lines were inaugurated in 1977 and their wild success outperformed all the most optimistic forecasts to the extent that line A is the most used urban rail line in Europe with nearly 300 million journeys a year.

Because of the enormous cost of these two lines, the third planned line was abandoned and the authorities decided that later developments of the RER network would be more cheaply developed by the SNCF, alongside its continued management of other suburban lines. However, the RER developed by the SNCF would never match the success of the RATP&#x27;s two RER lines. In 1979, the SNCF developed Line C by joining the suburban lines of the Gare d&#x27;Austerlitz and Gare d&#x27;Orsay, the latter being converted into a museum dedicated to impressionist paintings. During the 1980s, it developed Line D, which was the second line planned by the initial RER schedule, but serving Châtelet instead of République to reduce costs. A huge Métro-RER hub was created at Châtelet–Les Halles, becoming one of the world&#x27;s largest underground stations.

The same project of the 1960s also decided to merge Line 13 and Line 14 to create a quick connection between Saint-Lazare and Montparnasse as a new north–south line. Distances between stations on the lengthened line 13 differ from that on other lines in order to make it more &quot;express&quot; and hence to extend it farther in the suburbs. The new Line 13 was inaugurated on 9 November 1976.

=== 1990–2010: Eole and Météor ===

In October 1998, Line 14 was inaugurated. It was the first fully new Métro line in 63 years. Known during its conception as &quot;Météor&quot; (Métro Est-Ouest Rapide), it was the first of the now three fully automatic lines within the network, along with Line 1 and Line 4. It was the first with platform screen doors to prevent suicides and accidents. It was conceived with extensions to the suburbs in mind, similar to the extensions of the line 13 built during the 1970s. As a result, most of the stations are at least a kilometre apart. Like the RER lines designed by the RATP, nearly all stations offer connections with multiple Métro lines. The line initially ran between Saint-Lazare and Olympiades and was subsequently extended north to Mairie de St.Ouen in 2020.

Lines 13 and 7 are the only two on the network to be split in branches. The RATP would like to get rid of those saturated branches in order to improve the network&#x27;s efficiency. A project existed to attribute to line 14 one branch of each line, and to extend them further into the suburbs. This project was abandoned. In 1999, the RER Line E was inaugurated. Known during its conception as Eole (Est-Ouest Liaison Express), it is the fifth RER line. It terminates at , but a new project, financed by EPAD, the public authority managing the La Défense business district, should extend it west to La Défense–Grande Arche and the suburbs beyond.

=== 2010 and beyond: automation ===

Between 2007 and November 2011, Line 1 was converted to driverless operation. The line was operated with a combination of driver-operated trains and driverless trains until the delivery of the last of its driverless MP 05 trains in February 2013. The same conversion for Line 4 was completed on 13 January 2022, with the last non-automatic train removed from that line on 17 December 2023, and RATP would now like to automate Line 13. Line 14 was automated from Day 1, as will the lines 15 to 18 which are being built as part of the Grand Paris Express.

Several extensions to the suburbs opened in the last years. Line 8 was extended to Pointe du Lac in 2011, line 12 was extended to Aubervilliers in 2012, line 4 was extended to Mairie de Montrouge in 2013, Line 14 was extended by to Mairie de Saint-Ouen in December 2020, and Line 4 was extended to Bagneux in January 2022.

=== Accidents and incidents ===
* 10 August 1903: Couronnes Disaster (fire), 84 killed.
* July – October 1995: Paris Métro bombings (terror attack), committed by Algerian extremists – 8 killed and more than 100 injured.
* 30 August 2000: an MF 67 train derailed due to excessive speed and unavailable automatic cruising at Notre-Dame-de-Lorette, 24 slightly injured.
* 6 August 2005: fire broke out on a train at Simplon, injuring at least 19 people. Early reports blamed an electrical short circuit as the cause.
* 29 July 2007: a fire started on a train between Varenne and Invalides. Fifteen people were injured.

== Network ==

Since the Métro was built to comprehensively serve the city inside its walls, the stations are very close: apart on average, from on Line 4 to on the newer line 14, meaning Paris is densely networked with stations. The surrounding suburbs are served by later line extensions, thus traffic from one suburb to another must pass through the city (the circular line 15, now under construction, will enable some journeys that do not need to pass through Paris). The slow average speed effectively prohibits service to the greater Paris area.

The Métro is mostly underground ( of ). Above-ground sections consist of elevated railway viaducts within Paris (on Lines 1, 2, 5 and 6) and the at-level suburban ends of Lines 1, 5, 8, and 13. The tunnels are relatively close to the surface due to the variable nature of the terrain, which complicates deep digging; exceptions include parts of Line 12 under the hill of Montmartre and line 2 under Ménilmontant. The tunnels mostly follow the twists and turns of the streets above. During construction in 1900, a minimum radius of curvature of just was imposed, but even this low standard was not adhered to at Bastille and Notre-Dame-de-Lorette.

Like the New York City Subway, and in contrast with the London Underground, the Paris Métro mostly uses two-way tunnels. As in most French metro and tramway systems, trains drive on the right (SNCF trains run on the left track). The tracks are . Electric power is supplied by a third rail which carries 750 volts DC.

The width of the carriages, , is narrower than that of newer French systems (such as the carriages in Lyon) and trains on Lines 1, 4 and 14 have capacities of 600–700 passengers; this is as compared with 2,600 on the Altéo MI 2N trains of RER A. The City of Paris deliberately chose to build narrow Métro tunnels to prevent the running of mainline trains; the city of Paris and the French state had historically poor relations. In contrast to many other historical metro systems (such as New York, Madrid, London, and Boston), all lines have tunnels and operate trains with the same dimensions. Five Paris Métro Lines (1, 4, 6, 11 and 14) run on a rubber tire system developed by the RATP in the 1950s, exported to the Montreal, Santiago, Mexico City and Lausanne metro.

The number of cars in each train varies line by line. The shortest are lines 3bis and 7bis with three-car trains. Line 11 ran with four until the summer 2023 when four-car MP 59 trains, the oldest type in service at the time, were gradually replaced by new five-car MP 14 trains (at a pace of 3 to 5 new MP 14 every Monday). Lines 1 and 4 run six-car trains. Line 14 currently runs a mix of six and 8-car trains; in the future it will only run 8 cars. All other lines run with five. Two lines, 7 and 13, have branches at the end, and Line 10 has a one-way loop. Trains serve every station on each line except when they are closed for renovations.

===Map===


=== Opening hours ===
The first train leaves each terminus at 5:30 a.m. On some lines additional trains start from an intermediate station. The last train, often called the &quot;balai&quot; (broom) because it sweeps up remaining passengers, arrives at the terminus at 1:15 a.m., except on Fridays (since 7 December 2007), Saturdays and on nights before a holiday, when the service ends at 2:15 a.m.

On New Year&#x27;s Eve, &quot;Fête de la Musique&quot;, &quot;Nuit Blanche&quot; and other events, some stations on Lines 1, 4, 6, 9 and 14 remain open all night.

=== Tickets === 

Tickets are sold at staffed counters and at automated machines in the station foyer. Entrance to platforms is by automated gate, opened by smart cards and paper tickets. Gates return tickets for passengers to retain for the duration of the journey. There is normally no system to collect or check tickets at the end of the journey, and tickets can be inspected at any point. The exit from all stations is clearly marked as to the point beyond which possession of a ticket is no longer required.

==== Ticket t+ ====
The standard ticket for a single trip is the Ticket t+. It is valid for a multi-transfer journey within 90 minutes from the first validation. It can be used on the Métro (excluding Orly Airport), buses and trams, and in zone 1 of the RER. It allows unlimited transfers between the same mode of transport (i.e. Métro to Métro, bus to bus and tram to tram), between bus and tram, and between Métro and RER zone 1. The ticket is available in paper form, or can be loaded onto a Navigo Easy pass. As of 2024, it costs €2.15 per ticket, and is also available as a pack of ten tickets (a &quot;carnet&quot;) for €17.35 on Navigo Easy.

==== Other tickets ====
Daily, weekly, and monthly passes are available for users of a Navigo card, an RFID-based contactless smart card. Daily tickets are also available as paper tickets until the end of 2024.

&quot;Paris Visite&quot; is a paper ticket aimed at visitors offering unlimited trips for a duration of one, two, three or five days, for zones 1–3 covering the centre of Paris, or zones 1–5 covering the whole of the network including the RER to the airports, Versailles and Disneyland Paris.

A single ticket to or from Orly Airport on Métro line 14 costs €10.30.

===Facilities===
On 26 June 2012, it was announced that the Métro would get Wi-Fi in most stations. Access provided would be free, with a premium paid alternative offer proposed for a faster internet connection. As of 2020, the entire RATP network was connected with 4G service, including within tunnels. The automated Line 1, Line 4 and Line 14 – as well as some congested stations on Line 13 – have platform edge doors (&#x27;porte palière&#x27;) separating the tracks from the platform.

==== Accessibility ====
Less than 10 per cent of Paris’s metro system is wheelchair accessible ranking it as worst metro system in the world for accessibility. The 20 stations of Line 14 (which first opened in 1998) are fully accessible, and all line extensions since 1992 have included lifts at the new stations. By 2025, 23 stations on the Métro will be accessible, following extensions to existing lines. The four new lines of the Grand Paris Express will also be fully accessible.

The does not require the Métro to be made accessible. RATP estimates that retrofitting the network would cost between 4 and 6 billion euros, and that certain stations would remain impossible to retrofit. , there were no plans to retrofit existing stations with lifts. RATP notes that buses and trams in Paris are fully accessible, and many RER &amp; Transilien stations are accessible.

==Technical specifications==
The Métro has of track and 321 stations, 61 connecting between lines. These figures do not include the RER network. The average distance between stations is . Trains stop at all stations. Lines do not share tracks, even at interchange (transfer) stations.

Trains had a maximum permitted speed of and averaged at peak times as of 2018. The fastest lines were the automated ones: Line 14, which averaged , and Line 1, which averaged . Trains travel on the right. The track is standard gauge but the loading gauge is smaller than the mainline SNCF network. Power is from a lateral third rail, 750 V DC, except on the rubber-tyred lines where the current is from guide bars.

The loading gauge is small compared to those of newer metro systems (but comparable to that of early European metros), with capacities of between about 560 and 720 passengers per train on Lines 1–14. Many other metro systems (such as those of New York and London) adopted expanded tunnel dimensions for their newer lines (or used tunnels of multiple sizes almost from the outset, in the case of Boston), at the cost of operating incompatible fleets of rolling stock. Paris built all lines to the same dimensions as its original lines. Before the introduction of rubber-tire lines in the 1950s, this common shared size theoretically allowed any Métro rolling stock to operate on any line, but in practice each line was assigned a regular roster of trains.

A feature is the use of rubber-tired trains on five lines: this technique was developed by RATP and entered service in 1951. The technology was exported to many networks around the world (including Montreal, Mexico City and Santiago). Lines 1, 4, 6, 11 and 14 have special adaptations to accommodate rubber-tyred trains. Trains are composed of 3 to 8 cars depending on the line, the most common being 5 cars, but all trains on the same line have the same number of cars.

The Métro is designed to provide local, point-to-point service in Paris proper and service into the city from some close suburbs. Stations within Paris are very close together to form a grid structure, ensuring that every point in the city is close to a Métro station (less than ), at the cost of speed, except on Line 14 where the stations are farther apart and the trains travel faster. The system is complemented by the RER, which extends farther out into the suburbs and functions as an express network for the city and its surroundings.

The Paris Métro runs mostly underground; surface sections include sections on viaducts in Paris (Lines 1, 2, 5, and 6) and at the surface in the suburbs (Lines 1, 5, 8, and 13). In most cases, both tracks are laid in a single tunnel. Almost all lines follow roads, having been built by the cut-and-cover method near the surface (the earliest by hand). Line 1 follows the straight course of the Champs-Elysées and on other lines, some stations (Liège, Commerce) have platforms that do not align: the street above is too narrow to fit both platforms opposite each other. Many lines have very sharp curves. The specifications established in 1900 required a very low minimum curve radius by railway standards, but even this was often not fully respected, for example near Bastille and Notre Dame de Lorette. Parts of the network are built at depth, in particular a section of Line 12 under Montmartre, the sections under the Seine, and all of Line 14.

Lines 7 and 13 have two terminal branches, while line 7bis runs in a unidirectional loop at one end. One end of lines 2 and 5 each and both ends of line 6 have their terminus station on a balloon loop. One end of lines 3bis and 7bis each have their trains essentially operate this way, but instead reverse. One end of lines 2, 3bis, and 4 have trains run out of service on a balloon loop before reentering service. All other termini have trains continue a certain distance beyond the terminal, before proceeding back to the station on a different platform headed the other way.

== Rolling stock ==

The rolling stock has steel wheels (&quot;MF&quot; for &quot;matériel fer&quot;) and rubber-tyred trains (&quot;MP&quot; for &quot;matériel pneu&quot;). The different versions of each kind are specified by year of design. Some trains have suffixes to differentiate between them – &quot;CC&quot; (&quot;Conduite&quot; &quot;Conducteur&quot;) for trains driven by a driver and &quot;CA&quot; (&quot;Conduite Automatique)&quot; for trains that are automatically driven.

== Stations ==

The typical station comprises two central tracks flanked by two four-metre wide platforms. About 50 stations, generally current or former termini, are exceptions; most have three tracks and two platforms (Porte d&#x27;Orléans), or two tracks and a central platform (Porte Dauphine). Some stations are single-track, either due to difficult terrain (Saint-Georges), a narrow street above (Liège) or track loops (Église d&#x27;Auteuil).

Station length was originally , enough to accommodate the 5-car trains used on most lines. This was extended to on high-traffic lines (Line 1 and Line 4) which operate six-car trains, with some stations at for accommodating seven-car trains (the difference as yet unused).

In general, stations were built near the surface by the cut-and-cover method, and are vaulted. Stations of the former &quot;Nord-Sud&quot; network (Line 12 and Line 13) have higher ceilings, due to the former presence of a ceiling catenary. There are exceptions to the rule of near-surface vaulting:
* Stations particularly close to the surface, generally on Line 1 (Champs-Elysées–Clémenceau), have flat metal ceilings.
* Elevated (above street) stations, in particular on Line 2 and Line 6, are built in brick and covered by platform awnings (Line 2) or glass canopies (Line 6).
* Stations on the newest sections (Line 14), built at depth, comprise platforms for eight-car trains, high ceilings and double-width platforms. Since the trains on this line are driverless, the stations have platform screen doors. Platform screen doors have been introduced on Line 1 and Line 4 as well since the MP 05 trains have been functioning.

Several ghost stations are no longer served by trains. One of the three platforms at Porte des Lilas station is on a currently unused section of track, often used as a backdrop in films.

In 2018, the busiest stations were Saint-Lazare (46.7 million passengers), Gare du Nord (45.8), Gare de Lyon (36.9), Montparnasse – Bienvenüe (30.6), Gare de l&#x27;Est (21.4), Bibliothèque François Mitterrand (18.8), République (18.3), Les Halles (17.5), La Défense (16.0) and Bastille (13.2).

=== Interior decoration ===

Concourses are decorated in Art Nouveau style defined at the Métro&#x27;s opening in 1900. The spirit of this aesthetic has generally been respected in renovations.

Standard vaulted stations are lined by small white earthenware tiles, chosen because of the poor efficiency of early twentieth century electric lighting. From the outset walls have been used for advertising; posters in early stations are framed by coloured tiles with the name of the original operator (CMP or &quot;Nord Sud&quot;). Stations of the former &quot;Nord Sud&quot; (most of line 12 and parts of line 13) generally have more meticulous decoration. Station names are usually inscribed on metallic plaques in white letters on a blue background or in white tiles on a background of blue tiles.

The first renovations took place after the Second World War, when the installation of fluorescent lighting revealed the poor state of the original tiling. Three main styles of redecoration followed in succession.
* Between 1948 and 1967 the RATP installed standardised coloured metallic wall casings in 73 stations.
* From the end of the 1960s a new style was rolled out in around 20 stations, known as &quot;Mouton-Duvernet&quot; after the first station concerned. The white tiles were replaced to a height of with non-bevelled tiles in various shades of orange. Intended to be warm and dynamic, the renovations proved unpopular. The decoration has been removed as part of the &quot;&quot;Renouveau du métro&quot; programme.
* From 1975 some stations were redecorated in the &quot;Motte&quot; style, which emphasised the original white tiling but brought touches of colour to light fixtures, seating and the walls of connecting tunnels. The subsequent &quot;Ouï Dire&quot; style features audaciously shaped seats and light housings with complementary multicoloured uplighting.

A number of stations have original decorations to reflect the cultural significance of their locations. The first to receive this treatment was Louvre – Rivoli on line 1, which contains copies of the masterpieces on display at the museum. Other notable examples include Bastille (line 1), Saint-Germain-des-Prés (line 4), Cluny – La Sorbonne (line 10) and Arts et Métiers (line 11).

=== Exterior decoration ===

The original Art Nouveau entrances are iconic symbols of Paris. There are currently 83 of them. Designed by Hector Guimard in a style that caused some surprise and controversy in 1900, there are two main variants:
* The most elaborate feature glass canopies. Two original canopies still exist, at Porte Dauphine and Abbesses (originally located at until moved in the 1970s). A replica of the canopy at Abbesses was installed at Châtelet station at the intersection of Rue des Halles and Rue Sainte-Opportune.
* A cast-iron balustrade decorated in plant-like motifs, accompanied by a &quot;Métropolitain&quot;&quot; sign supported by two orange globes atop ornate cast-iron supports in the form of plant stems.
** Several of the iconic Guimard entrances have been given to other cities. The only original one on a metro station outside Paris is at Square-Victoria-OACI station in Montreal, as a monument to the collaboration of RATP engineers. Replicas cast from the original moulds have been given to the Lisbon Metro (Picoas station); the Mexico City Metro (Metro Bellas Artes, with a &quot;Metro&quot; sign), offered as a gift in return for a Huichol mural displayed at Palais Royal – Musée du Louvre; and Chicago Metra (Van Buren Street, at South Michigan Avenue and East Van Buren Street, with a &quot;Metra&quot; sign), given in 2001. The Moscow Metro has a Guimard entrance at Kievskaya station, donated by the RATP in 2006. There is an entrance on display at the Sculpture Garden in Downtown Washington, D.C. This does not lead to a metro station, it is just for pleasure. Similarly, The Museum of Modern Art has an original, restored Guimard entrance outdoors in the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden.

Later stations and redecorations have brought increasingly simple styles to entrances.
* Classical stone balustrades were chosen for some early stations in prestigious locations (Franklin D. Roosevelt, République).
* Simpler metal balustrades accompany a &quot;Métro&quot; sign crowned by a spherical lamp in other early stations (Saint-Placide).
* Minimalist stainless-steel balustrades (Havre-Caumartin) appeared from the 1970s and signposts with just an &quot;M&quot; have been the norm since the war (Olympiades, opened 2007).

A handful of entrances have original architecture (Saint-Lazare); a number are integrated into residential or standalone buildings (Pelleport).

== Future ==
=== Under construction ===
* As part of the Grand Paris Express project:
** The first (southern) section of future Line 15 between and . This section is long and will have sixteen stations. Opening is currently planned for 2025.
** The first (northern) section of future Line 16 between and with seven new stations. Opening is currently planned for 2026.
** The first (southern) section of future Line 17 between and with one new station. Opening is currently planned for 2026.
** The first (central) section of future Line 18 between and with seven new stations. Opening is currently planned in two phases for 2026 &amp; 2027.

=== Planned ===
The original Grand Paris Express plans had a total span of and counted 68 stations, the completion of which forms the major part of the currently planned lines.
* Line 15, the longest of the new Grand Paris Express lines, will be a circular line around Paris when completed in 2031.
* The second (southern) section of Line 16 between Clichy–Montfermeil and will open in 2028.
* Line 17 will be additionally extended in two phases in 2028 &amp; 2030 to , running through Charles de Gaulle Airport.
* Line 18 will be extended to the north, to , by 2030.

* An extension of Line 1 from to , connecting to RER and future Line 15 in 2035.
* An extension of Line 3 to .
* An extension of Line 5 to (south) and (north), as well as a new infill station ().
* An extension of Line 7 to .

* In 2023, the Grand Paris Express plans were extended with the addition of Line 19, serving on a route from to , under study for a completion around 2040.
* A merger of Line 3bis and Line 7bis to form a new line.

== Cultural significance ==
The Métro has a cultural significance in the arts that goes well beyond Paris. The term &quot;metro&quot; has become a generic name for subways and urban underground railways.

The station entrance kiosks, designed by Hector Guimard, fostered Art Nouveau building style (once widely known as &quot;le style Métro&quot;); however, some French commentators criticised the Guimard station kiosks, including their green colour and sign lettering, as difficult to read.

The success of rubber-tired lines led to their export to metro systems around the world, starting with the Montreal Metro. The success of Montreal &quot;did much to accelerate the international subway boom&quot; of the 1960s/1970s and &quot;assure the preeminence of the French in the process&quot;. Rubber-tired systems were adopted in Mexico City, Santiago, Lausanne, Turin, Singapore and other cities. The Japanese adopted rubber-tired metros (with their own technology and manufacturing firms) to systems in Kobe, Sapporo, as well as parts of Tokyo.

The &quot;Rabbit of the Paris Métro&quot; is an anthropomorphic rabbit visible on stickers on the doors of the trains since 1977 to advise passengers (especially children) of the risk of getting one&#x27;s hands trapped when the doors are opening, as well as the risk of injury on escalators or becoming trapped in the closing doors. This rabbit is now a popular icon in Paris similar to the &quot;mind the gap&quot; phrase in London.

<doc id="50758" wikidata="Q121655" url="?curid=50758" title="Carmen Miranda">
<text>Maria do Carmo Miranda da Cunha (9 February 1909 – 5 August 1955), known professionally as Carmen Miranda (), was a Portuguese-born Brazilian singer, dancer, and actress. Nicknamed &quot;The Brazilian Bombshell&quot;, she was known for her signature fruit hat outfit that she wore in her American films.

As a young woman, Miranda designed clothes and hats in a boutique before making her debut as a singer, recording with composer Josué de Barros in 1929. Miranda&#x27;s 1930 recording of &quot;Taí (Pra Você Gostar de Mim)&quot;, written by Joubert de Carvalho, catapulted her to stardom in Brazil as the foremost interpreter of samba.

During the 1930s, Miranda performed on Brazilian radio and appeared in five Brazilian &quot;chanchadas&quot;, films celebrating Brazilian music, dance and the country&#x27;s carnival culture. &quot;Hello, Hello Brazil!&quot; and &quot;Hello, Hello, Carnival!&quot; embodied the spirit of these early Miranda films. The 1939 musical &quot;Banana da Terra&quot; (directed by Ruy Costa) gave the world her &quot;Baiana&quot; image, inspired by Afro-Brazilians from the north-eastern state of Bahia.

In 1939, Broadway producer Lee Shubert offered Miranda an eight-week contract to perform in &quot;The Streets of Paris&quot; after seeing her at Cassino da Urca in Rio de Janeiro. The following year she made her first Hollywood film, &quot;Down Argentine Way&quot; with Don Ameche and Betty Grable, and her exotic clothing and Brazilian Portuguese accent became her trademark. That year, she was voted the third-most-popular personality in the United States; she and her group, Bando da Lua, were invited to sing and dance for President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1943, Miranda starred in Busby Berkeley&#x27;s &quot;The Gang&#x27;s All Here&quot;, which featured musical numbers with the fruit hats that became her trademark. By 1945, she was the highest-paid woman in the United States.

Miranda made 14 Hollywood films between 1940 and 1953. Although she was hailed as a talented performer, her popularity waned by the end of World War II. Miranda came to resent the stereotypical &quot;Brazilian Bombshell&quot; image she had cultivated and attempted to free herself of it with limited success. She focused on nightclub appearances and became a fixture on television variety shows. Despite being stereotyped, Miranda&#x27;s performances popularized Brazilian music and increased public awareness of Latin culture. In 1941, she was the first Latin American star to be invited to leave her hand and footprints in the courtyard of Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre and was the first South American honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Miranda is considered the precursor of Brazil&#x27;s 1960s Tropicalismo cultural movement. A museum was built in Rio de Janeiro in her honor and she was the subject of the documentary &quot;Carmen Miranda: Bananas Is My Business&quot; (1995).
==Early life==

Miranda was born Maria do Carmo Miranda da Cunha in 1909 in Várzea da Ovelha e Aliviada, a village in the northern Portuguese municipality of Marco de Canaveses. She was the second daughter of José Maria Pinto da Cunha (17 February 1887 – 21 June 1938) and Maria Emília Miranda (10 March 1886, Rio de Janeiro – 9 November 1971).

The family&#x27;s emigration to Brazil was already scheduled; however, upon finding herself pregnant, Carmen Miranda&#x27;s mother preferred to wait for her daughter&#x27;s birth. In 1909, her father emigrated to Brazil and settled in Rio de Janeiro, where he opened a barber shop. Her mother followed in 1910 with their daughters, Olinda (1907–1931) and Carmen, who was less than a year old. Although Carmen never returned to Portugal, she retained her Portuguese nationality. In Brazil, her parents had four more children: Amaro (1912–1988), Cecilia (1913–2011), Aurora (1915–2005) and Óscar (born 1916).

She was christened Carmen by her father because of his love for Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot;. This passion for opera influenced his children, and Miranda&#x27;s love for singing and dancing, at an early age. She was educated at the Convent of Saint Therese of Lisieux. Her father did not approve of Miranda&#x27;s plans to enter show business; her mother supported her, despite being beaten when her father discovered that his daughter had auditioned for a radio show (she had sung at parties and festivals in Rio). Miranda&#x27;s older sister, Olinda, developed tuberculosis and was sent to Portugal for treatment; the singer worked in a tie shop at age 14 to help pay her sister&#x27;s medical bills. She then worked in a boutique (where she learned to make hats) and opened a successful hat business.

==Career==

===In Brazil===
Miranda was introduced to Josué de Barros, a composer and musician from Bahia, while she was working at her family&#x27;s inn. With help from de Barros and Brunswick Records, she recorded her first single (the samba &quot;Não vá Simbora&quot;) in 1929. Miranda&#x27;s second single, &quot;Prá Você Gostar de Mim&quot; (also known as &quot;Taí&quot;, and released in 1930), was a collaboration with Brazilian composer Joubert de Carvalho and sold a record 35,000 copies that year. She signed a two-year contract with RCA Victor in 1930, giving them exclusive rights to her image.

In 1933 Miranda signed a two-year contract with Rádio Mayrink Veiga, the most popular Brazilian station of the 1930s, and was the first contract singer in Brazilian radio history; for a year, in 1937, she moved to Rádio Tupi. She later signed a contract with Odeon Records, making her the highest-paid radio singer in Brazil at the time.

Miranda&#x27;s rise to stardom in Brazil was linked to the growth of a native style of music: the samba. The samba and Miranda&#x27;s emerging career enhanced the revival of Brazilian nationalism during the government of President Getúlio Vargas. Her gracefulness and vitality in her recordings and live performances gave her the nickname &quot;Cantora do It&quot;. The singer was later known as &quot;Ditadora Risonha do Samba&quot;, and in 1933 radio announcer Cesar Ladeira christened her &quot;A Pequena Notável&quot;.

Her Brazilian film career was linked to a genre of musical films that drew on the nation&#x27;s carnival traditions and the annual celebration and musical style of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil&#x27;s capital at the time. Miranda performed a musical number in &quot;O Carnaval Cantado no Rio&quot; (1932, the first sound documentary on the subject) and three songs in &quot;A Voz do Carnaval&quot; (1933), which combined footage of street celebrations in Rio with a fictitious plot providing a pretext for musical numbers.

Miranda&#x27;s next screen performance was in the musical &quot;Hello, Hello Brazil!&quot; (1935), in which she performed its closing number: the &quot;marcha&quot; &quot;Primavera no Rio&quot;, which she had recorded for Victor in August 1934. Several months after the film&#x27;s release, according to &quot;Cinearte&quot; magazine, &quot;Carmen Miranda is currently the most popular figure in Brazilian cinema, judging by the sizeable correspondence that she receives&quot;. In her next film, &quot;Estudantes&quot; (1935), she had a speaking part for the first time. Miranda played Mimi, a young radio singer (who performs two numbers in the film) who falls in love with a university student (played by singer Mário Reis).
She starred in the next co-production from the Waldow and Cinédia studios, the musical &quot;Hello, Hello, Carnival!&quot; (1936), which contained a roll call of popular music and radio performers (including Miranda&#x27;s sister, Aurora). A standard backstage plot permitted 23 musical numbers and, by contemporary Brazilian standards, the film was a major production. Its set reproduced the interior of Rio&#x27;s plush Atlântico casino (where some scenes were filmed) and was a backdrop for some of its musical numbers. Miranda&#x27;s stardom is evident in a film poster with a full-length photograph of her and her name topping the cast list.

Although she became synonymous with colorful fruit hats during her later career, she began wearing them only in 1939, and contrary to popular belief, they were never made from real fruit. Miranda appeared in the film &quot;Banana da Terra&quot; that year in a glamorous version of the traditional dress of a poor black girl in Bahia: a flowing dress and a fruit-hat turban. She sang &quot;O Que É Que A Baiana Tem?&quot;; which intended to empower a social class that was usually disparaged.

Producer Lee Shubert offered Miranda an eight-week contract to perform in &quot;The Streets of Paris&quot; on Broadway after seeing her perform in 1939 at Rio&#x27;s Cassino da Urca. Although she was interested in performing in New York, she refused to accept the deal unless Shubert agreed to also hire her band, the Bando da Lua. He refused, saying that there were many capable musicians in New York who could back her. Miranda remained steadfast, feeling that North American musicians would not be able to authenticate the sounds of Brazil. Shubert compromised, agreeing to hire the six band members but not paying for their transport to New York. President Getúlio Vargas, recognizing the value to Brazil of Miranda&#x27;s tour, announced that the Brazilian government would pay for the band&#x27;s transportation on the Moore-McCormack Lines between Rio and New York. Vargas believed that Miranda would foster ties between the northern and southern hemispheres and act as a goodwill ambassador in the United States, increasing Brazil&#x27;s share of the American coffee market. Miranda took the official sanction of her trip and her duty to represent Brazil to the outside world seriously. She left for New York on the SS &quot;Uruguay&quot; on 4 May 1939, a few months before World War II.

===In the U.S.===

Miranda arrived in New York on 18 May 1939. She and the band had their first Broadway performance on 19 June 1939 in &quot;The Streets of Paris&quot;. Although Miranda&#x27;s part was small (she only spoke four words), she received good reviews and became a media sensation. According to &quot;New York Times&quot; theater critic Brooks Atkinson, most of the musical numbers &quot;ap[e] the tawdry dullness&quot; of genuine Paris revues and &quot;the chorus girls, skin-deep in atmosphere, strike what Broadway thinks a Paris pose ought to be&quot;. Atkinson added, however, that &quot;South American contributes the [revue&#x27;s] most magnetic personality&quot; (Miranda). Singing &quot;rapid-rhythmed songs to the accompaniment of a Brazilian band, she radiates heat that will tax the Broadhurst [theater] air-conditioning plant this Summer&quot;. Although Atkinson gave the revue a lukewarm review, he wrote that Miranda made the show.

Syndicated columnist Walter Winchell wrote for the &quot;New York Daily Mirror&quot; that a star had been born who would save Broadway from the slump in ticket sales caused by the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair. Winchell&#x27;s praise of Carmen and her Bando da Lua was repeated on his Blue Network radio show, which reached 55 million listeners daily. The press called Miranda &quot;the girl who saved Broadway from the World&#x27;s Fair&quot;. Her fame grew quickly, and she was formally presented to President Franklin D. Roosevelt at a White House banquet shortly after her arrival. According to a &quot;Life&quot; magazine reviewer:

Partly because their unusual melody and heavy accented rhythms are unlike anything ever heard in a Manhattan revue before, partly because there is not a clue to their meaning except the gay rolling of Carmen Miranda&#x27;s insinuating eyes, these songs, and Miranda herself, are the outstanding hit of the show.

When news of Broadway&#x27;s latest star (known as the Brazilian Bombshell) reached Hollywood, Twentieth Century-Fox began to develop a film featuring Miranda. Its working title was &quot;The South American Way&quot; (the title of a song she had performed in New York), and the film was later entitled &quot;Down Argentine Way&quot; (1940). Although its production and cast were based in Los Angeles, Miranda&#x27;s scenes were filmed in New York because of her club obligations. Fox could combine the footage from both cities because the singer had no dialogue with the other cast members. &quot;Down Argentine Way&quot; was successful, grossing $2 million that year at the US box office.

The Shuberts brought Miranda back to Broadway, teaming her with Olsen and Johnson, Ella Logan, and the Blackburn Twins in the musical revue &quot;Sons o&#x27; Fun&quot; on 1 December 1941. The show was a hodgepodge of slapstick, songs, and skits; according to &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; theater critic Richard Watts Jr., &quot;In her eccentric and highly personalized fashion, Miss Miranda is by way of being an artist and her numbers give the show its one touch of distinction.&quot; On 1 June 1942, she left the production when her Shubert contract expired; meanwhile, she recorded for Decca Records.

Miranda was encouraged by the US government as part of Roosevelt&#x27;s Good Neighbor policy, designed to strengthen ties with Latin America. It was believed that performers like her would give the policy a favorable impression with the American public. Miranda&#x27;s contract with 20th Century Fox lasted from 1941 to 1946, coinciding with the creation and activities of the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs. The goal of the OCIAA was to obtain support from Latin American society and its governments for the United States.

The Good Neighbor policy had been linked to US interference in Latin America; Roosevelt sought better diplomatic relations with Brazil and other South American nations, and pledged to refrain from military intervention (which had occurred to protect US business interests in industries such as mining or agriculture). Hollywood was asked to help, and Walt Disney Studios and 20th Century Fox participated. Miranda was considered a goodwill ambassador and a promoter of intercontinental culture.

====Brazilian criticism====

Although Miranda&#x27;s US popularity continued to increase, she began to lose favor with some Brazilians. On 10 July 1940, she returned to Brazil and was welcomed by cheering fans. Soon after her arrival, however, the Brazilian press began criticizing Miranda for accommodating American commercialism and projecting a negative image of Brazil. Members of the upper class felt that her image was &quot;too black&quot;, and she was criticized in a Brazilian newspaper for &quot;singing bad-taste black sambas&quot;. Other Brazilians criticized Miranda for playing a stereotypical &quot;Latina bimbo&quot;. In her first interview after her arrival in the US in the &quot;New York World-Telegram&quot;, she played up her then-limited knowledge of the English language: &quot;I say money, money, money. I say twenty words in English. I say money, money, money and I say hot dog!&quot;

On 15 July, Miranda appeared in a charity concert organized by Brazilian First Lady Darci Vargas and attended by members of Brazil&#x27;s high society. She greeted the audience in English and was met with silence. When Miranda began singing &quot;The South American Way&quot;, a song from one of her club acts, the audience began to boo her. Although she tried to finish her act, she gave up and left the stage when the audience refused to let up. The incident deeply hurt Miranda, who wept in her dressing room. The following day, the Brazilian press criticized her as &quot;too Americanized&quot;.

Weeks later, Miranda responded to the criticism with the Portuguese song &quot;Disseram que Voltei Americanizada&quot; (&quot;They Say I&#x27;ve Come Back Americanized&quot;). Another song, &quot;Bananas Is My Business&quot;, was based on a line from one of her films and directly addressed her image. Upset by the criticism, Miranda did not return to Brazil for 14 years.
Her films were scrutinized by Latin American audiences for characterizing Central and South America in a culturally homogeneous way. When Miranda&#x27;s films reached Central and South American theaters, they were perceived as depicting Latin American cultures through the lens of American preconceptions. Some Latin Americans felt that their cultures were misrepresented, and felt that someone from their own region was misrepresenting them. &quot;Down Argentine Way&quot; was criticized, with Argentines saying that it failed to depict Argentine culture. Its lyrics were allegedly replete with non-Argentine themes, and its sets were a fusion of Mexican, Cuban, and Brazilian culture. The film was later banned in Argentina for &quot;wrongfully portraying life in Buenos Aires&quot;. Similar sentiments were voiced in Cuba after the debut of Miranda&#x27;s &quot;Weekend in Havana&quot; (1941), with Cuban audiences offended by Miranda&#x27;s portrayal of a Cuban woman. Reviewers noted that an import from Rio could not accurately portray a woman from Havana, and Miranda did not &quot;dance anything Cuban&quot;. Her performances were arguably hybrids of Brazilian and other Latin cultures. Critics said that Miranda&#x27;s other films misrepresented Latin locales, assuming that Brazilian culture was a representation of Latin America.

===Peak years===
During the war years, Miranda starred in eight of her 14 films; although the studios called her the Brazilian Bombshell, the films blurred her Brazilian identity in favor of a Latin American image. According to a &quot;Variety&quot; review of director Irving Cummings&#x27; &quot;That Night in Rio&quot; (1941, Miranda&#x27;s second Hollywood film), her character upstaged the leads: &quot;[Don] Ameche is very capable in a dual role, and Miss [Alice] Faye is eye-appealing but it’s the tempestuous Miranda who really gets away to a flying start from the first sequence&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; article said, &quot;Whenever one or the other Ameche character gets out of the way and lets [Miranda] have the screen, the film sizzles and scorches wickedly.&quot; Years later, Clive Hirschhorn wrote: &quot;&quot;That Night in Rio&quot; was the quintessential Fox war-time musical – an over-blown, over-dressed, over-produced and thoroughly irresistible cornucopia of escapist ingredients.&quot; On 24 March 1941, Miranda was one of the first Latinas to imprint her hand- and footprints on the sidewalk of Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre.

Her next film, &quot;Week-End in Havana&quot;, was directed by Walter Lang and produced by William LeBaron. The cast included Alice Faye, John Payne, and Cesar Romero. After the studio&#x27;s third effort to activate the &quot;Latin hot blood&quot;, Fox was called &quot;Hollywood&#x27;s best good neighbor&quot; by Bosley Crowther. During the week it was released, the film topped the box office (surpassing &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, released a week earlier).

In 1942, 20th Century-Fox paid $60,000 to Lee Shubert to terminate his contract with Miranda, who finished her &quot;Sons o&#x27; Fun&quot; tour and began filming &quot;Springtime in the Rockies&quot;. The film, which grossed about $2 million, was one of the year&#x27;s ten most-successful films at the box office. According to a &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; review, it was &quot;senseless, but eye intriguing ... The basic plot is splashed over with songs and dances and the mouthings and eye and hand work of Carmen Miranda, who sure would be up a tree if she ever had to sing in the dark&quot;.
In 1943, she appeared in Busby Berkeley&#x27;s &quot;The Gang&#x27;s All Here&quot;. Berkeley&#x27;s musicals were known for lavish production, and Miranda&#x27;s role as Dorita featured &quot;The Lady in the Tutti-Frutti Hat&quot;. A special effect made her fruit-bedecked hat appear larger than possible. By then she was typecast as an exotic singer, and under her studio contract she was obligated to make public appearances in her ever-more-outlandish film costumes. One of her records, &quot;I Make My Money With Bananas&quot; seemed to pay ironic tribute to her typecasting. &quot;The Gang&#x27;s All Here&quot; was one of 1943&#x27;s 10 highest-grossing films and Fox&#x27;s most expensive production of the year. It received positive reviews, although &quot;The New York Times&quot; film critic wrote: &quot;Mr. Berkeley has some sly notions under his busby. One or two of his dance spectacles seem to stem straight from Freud.&quot;

The following year Miranda made a cameo appearance in &quot;Four Jills in a Jeep&quot;, a film based on a true adventure of actresses Kay Francis, Carole Landis, Martha Raye, and Mitzi Mayfair; Alice Faye and Betty Grable also made brief appearances. In 1944 Miranda also starred with Don Ameche in &quot;Greenwich Village&quot;, a Fox musical with William Bendix and Vivian Blaine in supporting roles. The film was poorly received; according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Technicolor is the picture&#x27;s chief asset, but still worth a look for the presence of Carmen Miranda&quot;. In her &quot;Miami News&quot; review, Peggy Simmonds wrote: &quot;Fortunately for &quot;Greenwich Village&quot;, the picture is made in Technicolor and has Carmen Miranda. Unfortunately for Carmen Miranda, the production doesn&#x27;t do her justice, the overall effect is disappointing, but still she sparkles the picture whenever she appears.&quot; &quot;Greenwich Village&quot; was less successful at the box office than Fox and Miranda had expected.

Miranda&#x27;s third 1944 film was &quot;Something for the Boys&quot;, a musical comedy based on the Broadway musical with songs by Cole Porter and starring Ethel Merman. It was Miranda&#x27;s first film without William LeBaron or Darryl F. Zanuck as producer. The producer was Irving Starr, who oversaw the studio&#x27;s second-string films. According to &quot;Time&quot; magazine, the film &quot;turns out to have nothing very notable for anyone&quot;.
By 1945, Miranda was Hollywood&#x27;s highest-paid entertainer and the top female taxpayer in the United States, earning more than $200,000 that year ($2.88 million in 2020, adjusted for inflation).

===Decline===

After World War II, Miranda&#x27;s films at Fox were produced in black-and-white, indicative of Hollywood&#x27;s diminishing interest in her and Latin Americans in general. A monochrome Carmen Miranda reduced the box-office appeal of the backstage musical, &quot;Doll Face&quot; (1945), in which she was fourth on the bill. Miranda played Chita Chula, billed in the show-within-the-film as &quot;the little lady from Brazil&quot;—a cheerful comic sidekick to leading lady Doll Face (Vivian Blaine) with one musical number and little dialogue. A &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; review read, &quot;Carmen Miranda does what she always does, only not well&quot;; according to &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, &quot;Carmen Miranda appears in a straight part with only one singing number. The innovation is not a success, but the fault is the director&#x27;s not Carmen&#x27;s.&quot;

In &quot;If I&#x27;m Lucky&quot; (1946), her follow-up film for Fox when she was no longer under contract, Miranda was again fourth on the bill with her stock screen persona firmly in evidence: heavily accented English, comic malapropisms, and bizarre hairstyles recreating her famous turbans. When Miranda&#x27;s contract with Fox expired on 1 January 1946, she decided to pursue an acting career free of studio constraints. Miranda&#x27;s ambition was to play a lead role showcasing her comic skills, which she set out to do in &quot;Copacabana&quot; (1947, an independent production released by United Artists starring Groucho Marx). Although her films were modest hits, critics and the American public did not accept her new image.

Although Miranda&#x27;s film career was faltering, her musical career remained solid and she was still a popular nightclub attraction. From 1948 to 1950, she joined the Andrews Sisters in producing and recording three Decca singles. Their first collaboration was on radio in 1945, when Miranda appeared on ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Andrews Sisters Show&quot;. Their first single, &quot;Cuanto La Gusta&quot;, was the most popular and reached number twelve on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart. &quot;The Wedding Samba&quot;, which reached number 23, followed in 1950.

After &quot;Copacabana&quot;, Joe Pasternak invited Miranda to make two Technicolor musicals for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer: &quot;A Date with Judy&quot; (1948) and &quot;Nancy Goes to Rio&quot; (1950). In the first production MGM wanted to portray a different image, allowing her to remove her turban and reveal her own hair (styled by Sydney Guilaroff) and makeup (by Jack Dawn). Miranda&#x27;s wardrobe for the film substituted elegant dresses and hats designed by Helen Rose for &quot;baiana&quot; outfits. She was again fourth on the bill as Rosita Cochellas, a rumba teacher who first appears about 40 minutes into the film and has little dialogue. Despite MGM&#x27;s efforts to change Miranda&#x27;s persona, her roles in both productions were peripheral, watered-down caricatures relying on fractured English and over-the-top musical and dance numbers.

In her final film, &quot;Scared Stiff&quot; (1953, a black-and-white Paramount production with Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis), Miranda&#x27;s appeal was again muted. Returning full-circle to her first Hollywood film, &quot;Down Argentine Way&quot;, she had virtually no narrative function. Lewis parodies her, miming badly to &quot;Mamãe eu quero&quot; (which is playing on a scratched record) and eating a banana he plucks from his turban. Miranda played Carmelita Castilha, a Brazilian showgirl on a cruise ship, with her costumes and performances bordering on self-parody.

In April 1953, she began a four-month European tour. While performing in Cincinnati in October, Miranda collapsed from exhaustion; she was rushed to LeRoy Sanitarium by her husband, Dave Sebastian, and canceled four following performances.

==Personal life==

Desiring creative freedom, Miranda decided to produce her own film in 1947 and played opposite Groucho Marx in &quot;Copacabana&quot;. The film&#x27;s budget was divided into about ten investors&#x27; shares. A Texan investor who owned one of the shares sent his brother, David Sebastian (23 November 1907 – 11 September 1990), to keep an eye on Miranda and his interests on the set. Sebastian befriended her, and they began dating.

Miranda and Sebastian married on 17 March 1947 at the Church of the Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills, with Patrick J. Concannon officiating. In 1948, Miranda became pregnant, but miscarried after a show. Although the marriage was brief, Miranda (who was Catholic) did not want a divorce. Her sister, Aurora, said in the documentary &quot;Bananas Is My Business&quot;: &quot;He married her for selfish reasons; she got very sick after she married and lived with a lot of depression&quot;. The couple announced their separation in September 1949, but reconciled several months later.

Miranda was discreet, and little is known about her private life. Before she left for the US, she had relationships with Mario Cunha, Carlos da Rocha Faria (son of a traditional family in Rio de Janeiro) and Aloísio de Oliveira, a member of the Bando da Lua. In the US, Miranda maintained relationships with John Payne, Arturo de Córdova, Dana Andrews, Harold Young, John Wayne, Donald Buka and Carlos Niemeyer. During her later years, in addition to heavy smoking and alcohol consumption, she began taking amphetamines and barbiturates, all of which took a toll on her health.

==Death==

 Miranda performed at the New Frontier Hotel in Las Vegas in April 1955, and in Cuba three months later before returning to Los Angeles to recuperate from a recurrent bronchial ailment. On 4 August, she was filming a segment for the NBC variety series &quot;The Jimmy Durante Show&quot;. According to Durante, Miranda had complained of feeling unwell before filming; he offered to find her a replacement, but she declined. After completing &quot;Jackson, Miranda, and Gomez&quot;, a song-and-dance number with Durante, she fell to one knee. Durante later said, &quot;I thought she had slipped. She got up and said she was outta breath. I told her I&#x27;ll take her lines. But she goes ahead with &#x27;em. We finished work about 11 o&#x27;clock and she seemed happy.&quot;

After the last take, Miranda and Durante gave an impromptu performance on the set for the cast and technicians. The singer took several cast members and some friends home with her for a small party. She went upstairs to bed at about 3 a.m. Miranda undressed, placed her platform shoes in a corner, lit a cigarette, placed it in an ashtray and went into her bathroom to remove her makeup. She apparently came from the bathroom with a small, round mirror in her hand; in the small hall that led to her bedroom, she collapsed from a fatal heart attack. Miranda was 46 years old. Her body was found at about 10:30 a.m. lying in the hallway. The &quot;Jimmy Durante Show&quot; episode in which Miranda appeared was aired two months after her death, on 15 October 1955. The episode began with Durante paying tribute to the singer, while also indicating that her family had given permission for the performance to be broadcast. A clip of the episode was included in the A&amp;E Network&#x27;s &quot;Biography&quot; episode about the singer.

In accordance with her wishes, Miranda&#x27;s body, dressed in a red suit, was flown back to Rio de Janeiro. The casket was covered with the flag of Brazil; the Brazilian government declared a period of national mourning.
About 60,000 people attended her memorial service at the Rio de Janeiro town hall, and more than half a million Brazilians escorted her funeral cortège to the cemetery.

Miranda is buried in São João Batista Cemetery in Rio de Janeiro. In 1956, her belongings were donated by her husband and family to the Carmen Miranda Museum, which opened in Rio on 5 August 1976. For her contributions to the entertainment industry, Miranda has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at the south side of the 6262 block of Hollywood Boulevard.

==Image==

Miranda&#x27;s Hollywood image was that of a generic Latina, blurring distinctions between Brazil, Portugal, Argentina, and Mexico and samba, tango and habanera music. It was stylized and flamboyant; she often wore platform sandals and towering headdresses made of fruit, becoming known as &quot;the lady in the tutti-frutti hat&quot;. Her enormous, fruit-laden hats were iconic visuals recognized worldwide; Saks Fifth Avenue developed a line of Miranda-inspired turbans and jewelry in 1939, and Bonwit Teller created mannequins resembling the singer.

Her tutti-frutti hat from &quot;The Gang&#x27;s All Here&quot; (1943) inspired the United Fruit Company&#x27;s Chiquita Banana logo the following year. During the 1960s, &quot;tropicália&quot; filmmakers in Brazil were influenced by Miranda&#x27;s Hollywood films.
In 2009 she was the subject of São Paulo Fashion Week and a short film, &quot;Tutti Frutti&quot;, by German photographer Ellen von Unwerth. Two years later, Macy&#x27;s wanted to use Miranda to promote a clothing line. Other products influenced by her stardom are the Brazilian fashion brand Malwee&#x27;s &quot;Chica Boom Chic&quot; collection for women, and the Chica Boom Brasil company&#x27;s high-end Carmen Miranda line, which includes Miranda-themed bags, wall clocks, crockery and placemats.

==Legacy==

According to Brazilian musician Caetano Veloso, &quot;Miranda was first a cause of both pride and shame, and later, a symbol that inspired the merciless gaze we began to cast upon ourselves  ... Carmen conquered &#x27;White&#x27; America as no other South American has done or ever would, in an era when it was enough to be &#x27;recognizably Latin and Negroid&#x27; in style and aesthetics to attract attention.&quot; Miranda was the first Brazilian artist to gain worldwide fame in the 1950s, and she continued to define South American music in North America for decades. In 1991, Veloso wrote that &quot;today, anything associated with Brazilian music in America – or with any music from the Southern Hemisphere in the Northern – makes us think of Carmen Miranda. And to think of her is to think about the complexity of this relationship&quot;

Although she was more popular abroad than in Brazil at her death, Miranda contributed to Brazilian music and culture. She was accused of commercializing Brazilian music and dance, but Miranda can be credited with bringing its national music (the samba) to a global audience. She introduced the &quot;baiana&quot;, a type of traditional dress in Bahia, with wide skirts and turbans, as a Brazilian showgirl at home and abroad. The &quot;baiana&quot; became a central feature of Carnival for women and men.

Since her death, Miranda is remembered as an important Brazilian artist and one of the most influential in Hollywood. She was one of 500 stars nominated for the American Film Institute&#x27;s 50 greatest screen legends.

On 25 September 1998, a square in Hollywood was named Carmen Miranda Square in a ceremony headed by honorary mayor of Hollywood Johnny Grant (one of Miranda&#x27;s friends since World War II) and attended by Brazilian consul general Jorió Gama and the Bando da Lua. The square is located at the intersection of Hollywood Boulevard and Orange Drive, across from Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre, near where Miranda gave an impromptu performance on V-J Day.

To commemorate the 50th anniversary of Miranda&#x27;s death, a Carmen Miranda Forever exhibit was displayed at the Museum of Modern Art in Rio de Janeiro in November 2005 and at the Latin America Memorial in São Paulo the following year. In 2005, Ruy Castro published &quot;Carmen – Uma biografia&quot;, a 600-page biography of &quot;the most famous Brazilian woman of the 20th century&quot;. Brazilians &quot;tend to forget&quot;, Castro told Mac Margolis of &quot;Newsweek&quot;, that &quot;no Brazilian woman has ever been as popular as Carmen Miranda – in Brazil or anywhere.&quot;

Dorival Caymmi&#x27;s &quot;O Que É Que A Baiana Tem?&quot; was his first work to be recorded, and introduced to the US the samba rhythm and Miranda in 1939; it was a Latin category inductee of the 2008 National Recording registry list.

Miranda, Selena, Celia Cruz, Carlos Gardel and Tito Puente appeared on a set of commemorative US Postal Service Latin Music Legends stamps, painted by Rafael Lopez, in 2011. Marie Therese Dominguez, vice president of government relations and public policy for the postal service, said: &quot;From this day forward, these colorful, vibrant images of our Latin music legends will travel on letters and packages to every single household in America. In this small way, we have created a lasting tribute to five extraordinary performers, and we are proud and honored to share their legacy with Americans everywhere through these beautiful stamps&quot;.

&quot;Down Argentine Way&quot; and &quot;The Gang&#x27;s All Here&quot; were inductees of the 2014 National Film Registry list. The 2016 Summer Olympics closing ceremony included a tribute to Miranda before the athletes&#x27; parade, with Roberta Sá portraying the singer. On 9 February 2017, Miranda was the subject of a Google Doodle created by Google artist Sophie Diao commemorating the 108th anniversary of her birth.

==In popular culture==

In &quot;The House Across the Bay&quot; (1940, produced by Walter Wanger and released by United Artists), Joan Bennett performed the Mirandaesque &quot;Chula Chihuahua.&quot; &quot;Babes on Broadway&quot; (1941) finale opens with &quot;Bombshell from Brazil&quot;, where Mickey Rooney (dressed as Miranda) sings &quot;Mamãe Eu Quero&quot;. The finale of &quot;Time Out for Rhythm&quot; (1941) begins with the Three Stooges performing a rumba number; Curly Howard is dressed as Carmen Miranda. In 1943&#x27;s &quot;Yankee Doodle Daffy&quot;, Daffy Duck performs &quot;Chica Chica Boom Chic&quot; while dressed as Carmen Miranda. The United Fruit Company created a banana-woman character in 1944, Chiquita, whose fruit hat resembled Miranda&#x27;s. In &quot;Small Town Deb&quot; (1942), Jane Withers does an impression of Carmen Miranda and sings &quot;I, Yi, Yi, Yi, Yi (I Like You Very Much)&quot;, which was one of Miranda&#x27;s signature songs. In the British comedy, &quot;Fiddlers Three&quot;, Tommy Trinder gives a bizarre performance as &quot;Senorita Alvarez&quot; from Brazil, a bold impersonation of Miranda.

The song &quot;Mamãe eu quero&quot; was featured in the 1943 &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; short &quot;Baby Puss&quot;, as performed by a trio of cartoon cats (Butch, Topsy and Meathead) with Topsy dressed up with a fruit hat, impersonating Carmen Miranda.

In &quot;Winged Victory&quot; (1944) Sascha Brastoff impersonates Carmen Miranda. In &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot;, Jo Ann Marlowe sings a Mirandaesque &quot;South American Way&quot;. In &quot;Be a Pal&quot;, a season-one episode of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, Lucille Ball imitates Miranda and lip-syncs to &quot;Mamãe Eu Quero&quot;.

In &quot;Diplomatic Courier&quot; (1952), during a nightclub sequence, Arthur Blake performs impersonations of Carmen Miranda, Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Bette Davis. Caetano Veloso appeared dressed as Miranda in January 1972, in his first show after his return to Brazil from London.

Jimmy Buffett&#x27;s 1973 album &quot;A White Sport Coat and a Pink Crustacean&quot; contains the song &quot;They Don&#x27;t Dance Like Carmen No More&quot;.

Musician Leslie Fish wrote and recorded a song called &quot;Carmen Miranda&#x27;s Ghost&quot; on her 1989 album of the same name. The song describes the chaos that ensues when the singer&#x27;s ghost appears on a space station. It was later the basis for a multi-author short story anthology edited by Don Sakers. John Cale&#x27;s 1989 &quot;Words for the Dying&quot; features a song co-written with Brian Eno titled &quot;The Soul of Carmen Miranda&quot;.

Helena Solberg filmed a documentary, &quot;Carmen Miranda: Bananas Is My Business&quot;, in 1995. Eduardo Dusek recorded a cover version of the song &quot;Tá-Hi (Pra Você Gostar de Mim)&quot;, written by Joubert de Carvalho and recorded by Miranda in 1930, for the 2003 telenovela &quot;Chocolate com Pimenta&quot;. In 2004, Caetano Veloso and David Byrne performed live at Carnegie Hall a song they had written together, &quot;Dreamworld: Marco de Canaveses&quot;, that pays homage to Miranda. In 2007, BBC Four produced &quot;Carmen Miranda – Beneath the Tutti Frutti Hat&quot;, a one-hour documentary which included interviews with biographer Ruy Castro, niece Carminha and Mickey Rooney. That year, singer Ivete Sangalo recorded a cover version of the song &quot;Chica Chica Boom Chic&quot; for the DVD &quot;MTV ao Vivo&quot;. For Miranda&#x27;s centenary, Daniela Mercury recorded a &quot;duet&quot; with the singer on a cover of &quot;O Que É Que A Baiana Tem?&quot;, which includes the original 1939 recording.

At the closing ceremony of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio, a few seconds&#x27; homage to Miranda was paid with an animated, projected image on the floor of the Maracanã Stadium.

Bonita Flamingo, a character in the children&#x27;s show &quot;Noddy&quot;, is a flamingo spoof of Miranda.

In 2009, Miranda served as the inspiration for a photo shoot on the 12th season of the reality TV show, America&#x27;s Next Top Model.

<text>The Elbe (; ; or &quot;Elv&quot;; Upper and , ) is one of the major rivers of Central Europe. It rises in the Giant Mountains of the northern Czech Republic before traversing much of Bohemia (western half of the Czech Republic), then Germany and flowing into the North Sea at Cuxhaven, northwest of Hamburg. Its total length is .

The Elbe&#x27;s major tributaries include the rivers Vltava, Saale, Havel, Mulde, Schwarze Elster, and Ohře.

The Elbe river basin, comprising the Elbe and its tributaries, has a catchment area of , the twelfth largest in Europe. The basin spans four countries; however, it lies almost entirely just in two of them, Germany (65.5%) and the Czech Republic (33.7%, covering about two thirds of the nation&#x27;s territory). On its southeastern edges, the Elbe river basin also comprises small parts of Austria (0.6%) and Poland (0.2%). The Elbe catchment area is inhabited by 24.4 million people; its biggest cities are Berlin, Hamburg, Prague, Dresden and Leipzig.

==Etymology==
First attested in Latin as &#x27;, the name &#x27; means &quot;river&quot; or &quot;river-bed&quot; and is nothing more than the High German version of a word (&quot;&quot;) found elsewhere in Germanic; cf. Old Norse river name &#x27;, Swedish &#x27; &quot;river&quot;, Norwegian &#x27; &quot;river&quot;, Old English river name &#x27;, and Middle Low German &quot;&quot; &quot;river-bed&quot;.

==Course==
===In the Czech Republic===
The Elbe (Labe) rises on the slopes of Mt. Violík at an elevation of in the Giant Mountains on the northwest borders of the Czech Republic. Of the numerous small streams whose waters compose the infant river. After plunging down the of the Elbe Falls, the latter stream unites with the steeply torrential Bílé Labe, and thereafter the united stream of the Elbe pursues a southerly course, emerging from the mountain glens at Jaroměř, where it receives Úpa and Metuje.

Here the Elbe enters the vast vale named Polabí (meaning &quot;land along the Elbe&quot;), and continues on southwards through Hradec Králové (where Orlice flows in) and then to Pardubice, where it turns sharply to the west. At Kolín some further on, it bends gradually towards the north-west. At the village of Káraný, a little above Brandýs nad Labem, the Jizera enters in.

At Mělník its stream is more than doubled in volume by the Vltava, a major river which winds northwards through Bohemia. Upstream from the confluence the Vltava is in fact much longer ( against of the Elbe so far), and has a greater discharge and a larger drainage basin. Nonetheless, for historical reasons the river retains the name Elbe, also because at the confluence point it is the Elbe that flows through the main, wider valley while the Vltava flows into the valley to meet the Elbe at almost a right angle, and thus appears to be the tributary river.

Some distance lower down, at Litoměřice, the waters of the Elbe are tinted by the reddish Ohře. Thus augmented, and swollen into a stream wide, the Elbe carves a path through the basaltic mass of the České Středohoří, churning its way through a picturesque, deep, narrow and curved rocky gorge.

===In Germany===
Shortly after crossing the Czech-German frontier, and passing through the sandstone defiles of the Elbe Sandstone Mountains, the stream assumes a north-westerly direction, which on the whole it preserves right to the North Sea.

The river rolls through Dresden and finally, beyond Meissen, enters on its long journey across the North German Plain passing along the former western border of East Germany, touching Torgau, Wittenberg, Dessau, Magdeburg, Wittenberge, and Hamburg on the way, and taking on the waters of the Mulde and Saale from the west, and those of the Schwarze Elster, Havel and Elde from the east. In its northern section both banks of the Elbe are characterised by flat, very fertile marshlands (Elbe Marshes), former flood plains of the Elbe now diked.

At Magdeburg there is a viaduct, the Magdeburg Water Bridge, that carries a canal and its shipping traffic over the Elbe and its banks, allowing shipping traffic to pass under it unhindered.

From the sluice of Geesthacht (at kilometre 586) on downstream the Elbe is subject to the tides, the tidal Elbe section is called the Unterelbe (Low Elbe). Soon the Elbe reaches Hamburg. Within the city-state the Unterelbe has a number of branch streams, such as Dove Elbe, Gose Elbe, Köhlbrand, Norderelbe (Northern Elbe), Reiherstieg, Süderelbe (Southern Elbe). Some of which have been disconnected for vessels from the main stream by dikes. In 1390 the Gose Elbe (literally in ) was separated from the main stream by a dike connecting the two then-islands of Kirchwerder and Neuengamme. The Dove Elbe (literally in ) was diked off in 1437/38 at Gammer Ort. These hydraulic engineering works were carried out to protect marshlands from inundation, and to improve the water supply of the Port of Hamburg. After the heavy inundation by the North Sea flood of 1962 the western section of the Southern Elbe was separated, becoming the Old Southern Elbe, while the waters of the eastern Southern Elbe now merge into the Köhlbrand, which is bridged by the Köhlbrandbrücke, the last bridge over the Elbe before the North Sea.

The Northern Elbe passes the Elbe Philharmonic Hall and is then crossed under by the old Elbe Tunnel (Alter Elbtunnel), both in Hamburg&#x27;s city centre. A bit more downstream, the Low Elbe&#x27;s two main anabranches Northern Elbe and the Köhlbrand reunite south of Altona-Altstadt, a locality of Hamburg. Right after both anabranches reunite, the Low Elbe is passed under by the New Elbe Tunnel (Neuer Elbtunnel), the last structural road link crossing the river before the North Sea. At the bay Mühlenberger Loch in Hamburg at kilometre 634, the Northern Elbe and the Southern Elbe (here now the cut-off meander Old Southern Elbe) used to reunite, which is why the bay is seen as the starting point of the Niederelbe (Lower Elbe). Leaving the city-state the Lower Elbe then passes between Holstein and the Elbe-Weser Triangle with Stade until it flows into the North Sea at Cuxhaven. Near its mouth, it passes the entrance to the Kiel Canal at Brunsbüttel before it debouches into the North Sea.

==Towns and cities==


==Navigation==
The Elbe has always been navigable by commercial vessels, and provides important trade links as far inland as Prague. The river is linked by canals (Elbe Lateral Canal, Elbe-Havel Canal, Mittellandkanal) to the industrial areas of Germany and to Berlin. The Elbe-Lübeck Canal links the Elbe to the Baltic Sea, as does the Kiel Canal, whose western entrance is near the mouth of the Elbe. The Elbe-Weser Shipping Channel connects the Elbe with the Weser.

By the Treaty of Versailles the navigation on the Elbe became subject to the International Commission of the Elbe, seated in Dresden. The statute of the commission was signed in Dresden on 22 February 1922. Following articles 363 and 364 of the Treaty of Versailles, Czechoslovakia was entitled to lease its own harbour basin, Moldauhafen in Hamburg. The contract of lease with Germany, and supervised by the United Kingdom, was signed on 14 February 1929, ending in 2028. Since 1993 the Czech Republic holds the former Czechoslovak legal position.

Before Germany was reunited, waterway transport in Western Germany was hindered by the fact that inland navigation to Hamburg had to pass through the German Democratic Republic. The Elbe-Seitenkanal (Elbe Lateral Canal) was built between the West German section of the Mittellandkanal and the Lower Elbe to restore this connection. When the two nations were reunited, works were begun to improve and restore the original links: the Magdeburg Water Bridge now allows large barges to cross the Elbe without having to enter the river. The often low water levels of the Elbe no longer hinder navigation to Berlin.

== Prehistory ==

Humans first lived in the northern Elbe region before about 200,000 years ago, during the Middle Paleolithic.

==History==
Ptolemy recorded the Elbe as &#x27; (Germanic for &quot;river&quot;) in Germania Magna, with its source in the &#x27; mountains (Giant Mountains), where the Germanic &quot; then lived.
The Elbe has long served as an important delineator of European geography. The Romans knew the river as the &quot;; however, they made only one serious attempt to move the border of their empire forward from the Rhine to the Elbe, and this attempt failed with the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in 9 AD, after which they never seriously tried again. In the Middle Ages the Elbe formed the eastern limit of the Empire of Charlemagne (King of the Franks from 769 to 814). The river&#x27;s navigable sections were essential to the success of the Hanseatic League in the Late Middle Ages, and much trade was carried on its waters.

From the early 6th century Slavic tribes (known as the Polabian Slavs) settled in the areas east of the rivers Elbe and Saale (which had been depopulated since the 4th century). In the 10th century the Ottonian Dynasty (dominant from 919 to 1024) began conquering these lands; a slow process of Germanization ensued, including the Wendish Crusade of 1147.

The Elbe delineated the western parts of Germany from the eastern so-called East Elbia, where soccage and serfdom were more strict and prevailed longer than westwards of the river, and where feudal lords held bigger estates than in the west. Thus incumbents of huge land-holdings became characterised as East Elbian Junkers. The Northern German area north of the Lower Elbe used to be called North Albingia in the Middle Ages. When the four Lutheran church bodies there united in 1977 they chose the name North Elbian Evangelical Lutheran Church. Other, administrative units were named after the river Elbe, such as the Westphalian &quot;Elbe département&quot; (1807–1813) and &quot;Lower Elbe département&quot; (1810), and the French département Bouches-de-l&#x27;Elbe (1811–1814).

On 10 April 1945, General Wenck of the German Twelfth Army located to the west of Berlin to guard against the advancing American and British forces. But, as the Western Front moved eastwards and the Eastern Front moved westwards, the German armies making up both fronts backed towards each other. As a result, the area of control of Wenck&#x27;s army to his rear and east of the Elbe River had become a vast refugee camp for Germans fleeing from the approaching Soviet Army. Wenck took great pains to provide food and lodging for these refugees. At one stage, the Twelfth Army was estimated to be feeding more than a quarter of a million people every day. During the night of 28 April, Wenck reported to the German Supreme Army Command in Fuerstenberg that his Twelfth Army had been forced back along the entire front. According to Wenck, no attack on Berlin was possible as support from Busse&#x27;s Ninth Army could no longer be expected. Instead, starting April 24, Wenck moved his army towards the Forest of Halbe, broke into the Halbe pocket and linked up with the remnants of the Ninth Army, Hellmuth Reymann&#x27;s &quot;Army Group Spree&quot;, and the Potsdam garrison. Wenck brought his army, remnants of the Ninth Army, and many civilian refugees across the Elbe and into territory occupied by the U.S. Army.

In 1945, as World War II drew to a close, Germany came under attack from the armies of the western Allies advancing from the west and those of the Soviet Union advancing from the east. On 25 April 1945 these two forces linked up near Torgau, on the Elbe. The victorious countries marked the event unofficially as Elbe Day. From 1949 to 1990 the Elbe formed part of the Inner German border between East Germany and West Germany.

During the 1970s the Soviet Union stated that Adolf Hitler&#x27;s ashes had been scattered in the Elbe following disinterment from their original burial-site.

<text>A privateer is a private person or vessel which engages in commerce raiding under a commission of war. Since robbery under arms was a common aspect of seaborne trade, until the early 19th century all merchant ships carried arms. A sovereign or delegated authority issued commissions, also referred to as letters of marque, during wartime. The commission empowered the holder to carry on all forms of hostility permissible at sea by the usages of war. This included attacking foreign vessels and taking them as prizes and taking crews prisoner for exchange. Captured ships were subject to condemnation and sale under prize law, with the proceeds divided by percentage between the privateer&#x27;s sponsors, shipowners, captains and crew. A percentage share usually went to the issuer of the commission (i.e. the sovereign).

Privateering allowed sovereigns to multiply their naval forces at relatively low cost by mobilizing privately owned armed ships and sailors to supplement state power. For participants, privateering provided the potential for a greater income and profit than obtainable as a merchant seafarer or fisher while avoiding the dangers associated with outright piracy. However, the line between privateers and pirates was not always clear.

The commission usually protected privateers from accusations of piracy, but in practice the historical legality and status of privateers could be vague. Depending on the specific sovereign and the time period, commissions might be issued hastily; privateers might take actions beyond what was authorized in the commission, including after its expiry. A privateer who continued raiding after the expiration of a commission or the signing of a peace treaty could face accusations of piracy. The risk of piracy and the emergence of the modern state system of centralised military control caused the decline of privateering by the end of the 19th century.

==Legal framework and relation to piracy==

The commission was the proof the privateer was not a pirate. It usually limited activity to one particular ship, and specified officers, for a specified period of time. Typically, the owners or captain would be required to post a performance bond. The commission also dictated the expected nationality of potential prize ships under the terms of the war. At sea, the privateer captain was obliged to produce the commission to a potential prize ship&#x27;s captain as evidence of the legitimacy of their prize claim. If the nationality of a prize was not the enemy of the commissioning sovereign, the privateer could not claim the ship as a prize. Doing so would be an act of piracy.

In British law, under the Offences at Sea Act 1536, piracy, or raiding a ship without a valid commission, was an act of treason. By the late 17th century, the prosecution of privateers loyal to the usurped King James II for piracy began to shift the legal framework of piracy away from treason towards crime against property. As a result, privateering commissions became a matter of national discretion. By the passing of the Piracy Act 1717, a privateer&#x27;s allegiance to Britain overrode any allegiance to a sovereign providing the commission. This helped bring privateers under the legal jurisdiction of their home country in the event the privateer turned pirate. Other European countries followed suit. The shift from treason to property also justified the criminalisation of traditional sea-raiding activities of people Europeans wished to colonise.

The legal framework around authorised sea-raiding was considerably murkier outside of Europe. Unfamiliarity with local forms of authority created difficulty determining who was legitimately sovereign on land and at sea, whether to accept their authority, or whether the opposing parties were, in fact, pirates. Mediterranean corsairs operated with a style of patriotic-religious authority that Europeans, and later Americans, found difficult to understand and accept. It did not help that many European privateers happily accepted commissions from the deys of Algiers, Tangiers and Tunis. The sultans of the Sulu archipelago (now present-day Philippines) held only a tenuous authority over the local Iranun communities of slave-raiders. The sultans created a carefully spun web of marital and political alliances in an attempt to control unauthorised raiding that would provoke war against them. In Malay political systems, the legitimacy and strength of their Sultan&#x27;s management of trade determined the extent he exerted control over the sea-raiding of his coastal people.

Privateers were implicated in piracy for a number of complex reasons. For colonial authorities, successful privateers were skilled seafarers who brought in much-needed revenue, especially in newly settled colonial outposts. These skills and benefits often caused local authorities to overlook a privateer&#x27;s shift into piracy when a war ended. The French Governor of Petit-Goave gave buccaneer Francois Grogniet blank privateering commissions, which Grogniet traded to Edward Davis for a spare ship so the two could continue raiding Spanish cities under a guise of legitimacy. New York Governors Jacob Leisler and Benjamin Fletcher were removed from office in part for their dealings with pirates such as Thomas Tew, to whom Fletcher had granted commissions to sail against the French, but who ignored his commission to raid Mughal shipping in the Red Sea instead.

Some privateers faced prosecution for piracy. William Kidd accepted a commission from King William III of England to hunt pirates but was later hanged for piracy. He had been unable to produce the papers of the prizes he had captured to prove his innocence.

Privateering commissions were easy to obtain during wartime but when the war ended and sovereigns recalled the privateers, many refused to give up the lucrative business and turned to piracy. Boston minister Cotton Mather lamented after the execution of pirate John Quelch: 

==Noted privateers==
Privateers who were considered legitimate by their governments include:
* Miguel Enríquez (Puerto Rico)
* Pieter van der Does (Dutch Empire)
* Amaro Pargo (Spanish Empire or &quot;Hispanic Monarchy&quot;)
* Hayreddin Barbarossa (Ottoman Empire)
* Robert Surcouf (France)
* Lars Gathenhielm (Sweden)
* Sir Francis Drake (England)
* Sir John Hawkins (England)
* Juana Larando (Basque Country)
* Jean Bart (France)

==Ships==
Entrepreneurs converted many different types of vessels into privateers, including obsolete warships and refitted merchant ships. The investors would arm the vessels and recruit large crews, much larger than a merchantman or a naval vessel would carry, in order to crew the prizes they captured. Privateers generally cruised independently, but it was not unknown for them to form squadrons, or to co-operate with the regular navy. A number of privateers were part of the English fleet that opposed the Spanish Armada in 1588. Privateers generally avoided encounters with warships, as such encounters would be at best unprofitable. Still, such encounters did occur. For instance, in 1815 &quot;Chasseur&quot; encountered HMS &quot;St Lawrence&quot;, herself a former American privateer, mistaking her for a merchantman until too late; in this instance, however, the privateer prevailed.

The United States used mixed squadrons of frigates and privateers in the American Revolutionary War. Following the French Revolution, French privateers became a menace to British and American shipping in the western Atlantic and the Caribbean, resulting in the Quasi-War, a brief conflict between France and the United States, fought largely at sea, and to the Royal Navy&#x27;s procuring Bermuda sloops to combat the French privateers.

==Overall history==
In Europe, the practice of authorising sea-raiding dated to at least the 13th century but the word &#x27;privateer&#x27; was coined sometime in the mid-17th century. Seamen who served on naval vessels were paid wages and given victuals, whereas mariners on merchantmen and privateers received a share of the takings. Privateering thus offered otherwise working-class enterprises (merchant ships) with the chance at substantial wealth (prize money from captures). The opportunity mobilized local seamen as auxiliaries in an era when state capacity limited the ability of a nation to fund a professional navy via taxation. 

Privateers were a large part of the total military force at sea during the 17th and 18th centuries. In the first Anglo-Dutch War, English privateers attacked the trade on which the United Provinces entirely depended, capturing over 1,000 Dutch merchant ships. During the subsequent war with Spain, Spanish and Flemish privateers in the service of the Spanish Crown, including the Dunkirkers, captured 1,500 English merchant ships, helping to restore Dutch international trade. British trade, whether coastal, Atlantic, or Mediterranean, was also attacked by Dutch privateers and others in the Second and Third Anglo-Dutch wars. Piet Pieterszoon Hein was a brilliantly successful Dutch privateer who captured a Spanish treasure fleet. Magnus Heinason was another privateer who served the Dutch against the Spanish. While their and others&#x27; attacks brought home a great deal of money, they hardly dented the flow of gold and silver from Mexico to Spain.

As the Industrial Revolution proceeded, privateering became increasingly incompatible with modern states&#x27; monopoly on violence. Modern warships could easily outrace merchantmen, and tight controls on naval armaments led to fewer private-purchase naval weapons. Privateering continued until the 1856 Declaration of Paris, in which all major European powers stated that &quot;Privateering is and remains abolished&quot;. The United States did not sign the Declaration over stronger language that protects all private property from capture at sea, but has not issued letters of marque in any subsequent conflicts. In the 19th century, many nations passed laws forbidding their nationals from accepting commissions as privateers for other nations. The last major power to flirt with privateering was Prussia in the 1870 Franco-Prussian War, when Prussia announced the creation of a &#x27;volunteer navy&#x27; of ships privately-owned and -manned, but eligible for prize money. (Prussia argued that the Declaration did not forbid such a force, because the ships were subject to naval discipline.) 

===England/Britain===
In England, and later the United Kingdom, the ubiquity of wars and the island nation&#x27;s reliance on maritime trade enabled the use of privateers to great effect. England also suffered much from other nations&#x27; privateering. During the 15th century, the country &quot;lacked an institutional structure and coordinated finance&quot;. When piracy became an increasing problem, merchant communities such as Bristol began to resort to self-help, arming and equipping ships at their own expense to protect commerce. The licensing of these privately owned merchant ships by the Crown enabled them to legitimately capture vessels that were deemed pirates. This constituted a &quot;revolution in naval strategy&quot; and helped fill the need for protection that the Crown was unable to provide.

During the reign of Queen Elizabeth (1558–1603), she &quot;encouraged the development of this supplementary navy&quot;. Over the course of her rule, the increase of Spanish prosperity through their explorations in the New World and the discovery of gold contributed to the deterioration of Anglo-Spanish relations. Elizabeth&#x27;s authorisation of sea-raiders (known as Sea Dogs) such as Francis Drake and Walter Raleigh allowed her to officially distance herself from their raiding activities while enjoying the gold gained from these raids. English ships cruised in the Caribbean and off the coast of Spain, trying to intercept treasure fleets from the Spanish Main. During the Anglo-Spanish War (1585-1604) England continued to rely on private ships-of-war to attack Iberian shipping because the Queen had insufficient finance to fund this herself. After the war ended many unemployed English privateers turned to piracy.

Elizabeth was succeeded by the first Stuart monarchs, James I and Charles I, who did not permit privateering. Desperate to fund the expensive War of Spanish Succession, Queen Anne restarted privateering and even removed the need for a sovereign&#x27;s percentage as an incentive. Sovereigns continued to license British privateers throughout the century, although there were a number of unilateral and bilateral declarations limiting privateering between 1785 and 1823. This helped establish the privateer&#x27;s persona as heroic patriots. British privateers last appeared &quot;en masse&quot; in the Napoleonic Wars.
England and Scotland practiced privateering both separately and together after they united to create the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707. It was a way to gain for themselves some of the wealth the Spanish and Portuguese were taking from the New World before beginning their own trans-Atlantic settlement, and a way to assert naval power before a strong Royal Navy emerged.

Sir Andrew Barton, Lord High Admiral of Scotland, followed the example of his father, who had been issued with letters of marque by James III of Scotland to prey upon English and Portuguese shipping in 1485; the letters in due course were reissued to the son. Barton was killed following an encounter with the English in 1511.

Sir Francis Drake, who had close contact with the sovereign, was responsible for some damage to Spanish shipping, as well as attacks on Spanish settlements in the Americas in the 16th century. He participated in the successful English defence against the Spanish Armada in 1588, though he was also partly responsible for the failure of the English Armada against Spain in 1589.

Sir George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland, was a successful privateer against Spanish shipping in the Caribbean. He is also famous for his short-lived 1598 capture of &quot;Fort San Felipe del Morro&quot;, the citadel protecting San Juan, Puerto Rico. He arrived in Puerto Rico on June 15, 1598, but by November of that year, Clifford and his men had fled the island due to fierce civilian resistance. He gained sufficient prestige from his naval exploits to be named the official Champion of Queen Elizabeth I. Clifford became extremely wealthy through his buccaneering but lost most of his money gambling on horse races.
Captain Christopher Newport led more attacks on Spanish shipping and settlements than any other English privateer. As a young man, Newport sailed with Sir Francis Drake in the attack on the Spanish fleet at Cadiz and participated in England&#x27;s defeat of the Spanish Armada. During the war with Spain, Newport seized fortunes of Spanish and Portuguese treasure in fierce sea battles in the West Indies as a privateer for Queen Elizabeth I. He lost an arm whilst capturing a Spanish ship during an expedition in 1590, but despite this, he continued on privateering, successfully blockading Western Cuba the following year. In 1592, Newport captured the Portuguese carrack &quot;Madre de Deus&quot; (Mother of God), valued at £500,000.

Sir Henry Morgan was a successful privateer. Operating out of Jamaica, he carried on a war against Spanish interests in the region, often using cunning tactics. His operation was prone to cruelty against those he captured, including torture to gain information about booty, and in one case using priests as human shields. Despite reproaches for some of his excesses, he was generally protected by Sir Thomas Modyford, the governor of Jamaica. He took an enormous amount of booty, as well as landing his privateers ashore and attacking land fortifications, including the sack of the city of Panama with only 1,400 crew.

Other British privateers of note include Fortunatus Wright, Edward Collier, Sir John Hawkins, his son Sir Richard Hawkins, Michael Geare, and Sir Christopher Myngs. Notable British colonial privateers in Nova Scotia include Alexander Godfrey of the brig and Joseph Barss of the schooner . The latter schooner captured over 50 American vessels during the War of 1812.

The English colony of Bermuda (or the &quot;Somers Isles&quot;), settled accidentally in 1609, was used as a base for English privateers from the time it officially became part of the territory of the Virginia Company in 1612, especially by ships belonging to Robert Rich, the Earl of Warwick, for whom Bermuda&#x27;s Warwick Parish is named (the Warwick name had long been associated with commerce raiding, as exampled by the Newport Ship, thought to have been taken from the Spanish by Warwick the Kingmaker in the 15th century). Many Bermudians were employed as crew aboard privateers throughout the century, although the colony was primarily devoted to farming cash crops until turning from its failed agricultural economy to the sea after the 1684 dissolution of the Somers Isles Company (a spin-off of the Virginia Company, which had overseen the colony since 1615). With a total area of and lacking any natural resources other than the Bermuda cedar, the colonists applied themselves fully to the maritime trades, developing the speedy Bermuda sloop, which was well suited both to commerce and to commerce raiding. Bermudian merchant vessels turned to privateering at every opportunity in the 18th century, preying on the shipping of Spain, France, and other nations during a series of wars, including the 1688 to 1697 Nine Years&#x27; War (King William&#x27;s War); the 1702 to 1713 Queen Anne&#x27;s War; the 1739 to 1748 War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear; the 1740 to 1748 War of the Austrian Succession (King George&#x27;s War); the 1754 to 1763 Seven Years&#x27; War (known in the United States as the French and Indian War), this conflict was devastating for the colony&#x27;s merchant fleet. Fifteen privateers operated from Bermuda during the war, but losses exceeded captures; the 1775 to 1783 American War of Independence; and the 1796 to 1808 Anglo-Spanish War. By the middle of the 18th century, Bermuda was sending twice as many privateers to sea as any of the continental colonies. They typically left Bermuda with very large crews. This advantage in manpower was vital in overpowering the crews of larger vessels, which themselves often lacked sufficient crewmembers to put up a strong defence. The extra crewmen were also useful as prize crews for returning captured vessels.

The Bahamas, which had been depopulated of its indigenous inhabitants by the Spanish, had been settled by England, beginning with the Eleutheran Adventurers, dissident Puritans driven out of Bermuda during the English Civil War. Spanish and French attacks destroyed New Providence in 1703, creating a stronghold for pirates, and it became a thorn in the side of British merchant trade through the area. In 1718, Britain appointed Woodes Rogers as Governor of the Bahamas, and sent him at the head of a force to reclaim the settlement. Before his arrival, however, the pirates had been forced to surrender by a force of Bermudian privateers who had been issued letters of marque by the Governor of Bermuda.

Bermuda was in de facto control of the Turks Islands, with their lucrative salt industry, from the late 17th century to the early 19th. The Bahamas made perpetual attempts to claim the Turks for itself. On several occasions, this involved seizing the vessels of Bermudian salt traders. A virtual state of war was said to exist between Bermudian and Bahamian vessels for much of the 18th century. When the Bermudian sloop &quot;Seaflower&quot; was seized by the Bahamians in 1701, the response of the Governor of Bermuda, Captain Benjamin Bennett, was to issue letters of marque to Bermudian vessels. In 1706, Spanish and French forces ousted the Bermudians but were driven out themselves three years later by the Bermudian privateer Captain Lewis Middleton. His ship, the &quot;Rose&quot;, attacked a Spanish and a French privateer holding a captive English vessel. Defeating the two enemy vessels, the &quot;Rose&quot; then cleared out the thirty-man garrison left by the Spanish and French.

Despite strong sentiments in support of the rebels, especially in the early stages, Bermudian privateers turned as aggressively on American shipping during the American War of Independence. The importance of privateering to the Bermudian economy had been increased not only by the loss of most of Bermuda&#x27;s continental trade but also by the Palliser Act, which forbade Bermudian vessels from fishing the Grand Banks. Bermudian trade with the rebellious American colonies actually carried on throughout the war. Some historians credit the large number of Bermuda sloops (reckoned at over a thousand) built-in Bermuda as privateers and sold illegally to the Americans as enabling the rebellious colonies to win their independence. Also, the Americans were dependent on Turks salt, and one hundred barrels of gunpowder were stolen from a Bermudian magazine and supplied to the rebels as orchestrated by Colonel Henry Tucker and Benjamin Franklin, and as requested by George Washington, in exchange for which the Continental Congress authorised the sale of supplies to Bermuda, which was dependent on American produce. The realities of this interdependence did nothing to dampen the enthusiasm with which Bermudian privateers turned on their erstwhile countrymen.

An American naval captain, ordered to take his ship out of Boston Harbor to eliminate a pair of Bermudian privateering vessels that had been picking off vessels missed by the Royal Navy, returned frustrated, saying, &quot;the Bermudians sailed their ships two feet for every one of ours&quot;. Around 10,000 Bermudians emigrated in the years prior to American independence, mostly to the American colonies. Many Bermudians occupied prominent positions in American seaports, from where they continued their maritime trades (Bermudian merchants controlled much of the trade through ports like Charleston, South Carolina, and Bermudian shipbuilders influenced the development of American vessels, like the Chesapeake Bay schooner), and in the Revolution they used their knowledge of Bermudians and of Bermuda, as well as their vessels, for the rebels&#x27; cause. In the 1777 Battle of Wreck Hill, brothers Charles and Francis Morgan, members of a large Bermudian enclave that had dominated Charleston, South Carolina and its environs since settlement, captaining two sloops (the &quot;Fair American&quot; and the &quot;Experiment&quot;, respectively), carried out the only attack on Bermuda during the war. The target was a fort that guarded a little used passage through the encompassing reef line. After the soldiers manning the fort were forced to abandon it, they spiked its guns and fled themselves before reinforcements could arrive.

When the Americans captured the Bermudian privateer &quot;Regulator&quot;, they discovered that virtually all of her crew were black slaves. Authorities in Boston offered these men their freedom, but all 70 elected to be treated as prisoners of war. Sent as such to New York on the sloop &quot;Duxbury&quot;, they seized the vessel and sailed it back to Bermuda. One-hundred and thirty prizes were brought to Bermuda in the year between 4th day of April 1782 and the 4th day of April 1783 alone, including three by Royal Naval vessels and the remainder by privateers.

The War of 1812 saw an encore of Bermudian privateering, which had died out after the 1790s. The decline of Bermudian privateering was due partly to the buildup of the naval base in Bermuda, which reduced the Admiralty&#x27;s reliance on privateers in the western Atlantic, and partly to successful American legal suits and claims for damages pressed against British privateers, a large portion of which were aimed squarely at the Bermudians. During the course of the War of 1812, Bermudian privateers captured 298 ships, some 19% of the 1,593 vessels captured by British naval and privateering vessels between the Great Lakes and the West Indies.

Among the better known (native-born and immigrant) Bermudian privateers were Hezekiah Frith, Bridger Goodrich, Henry Jennings, Thomas Hewetson, and Thomas Tew.

=== Providence Island colony ===

Bermudians were also involved in privateering from the short-lived English colony on Isla de Providencia, off the coast of Nicaragua. This colony was initially settled largely via Bermuda, with about eighty Bermudians moved to Providence in 1631. Although it was intended that the colony be used to grow cash crops, its location in the heart of the Spanish controlled territory ensured that it quickly became a base for privateering.

Bermuda-based privateer Daniel Elfrith, while on a privateering expedition with Captain Sussex Camock of the bark &quot;Somer Ilands&quot; (a rendering of &quot;Somers Isles&quot;, the alternate name of the Islands of Bermuda commemorating Admiral Sir George Somers) in 1625, discovered two islands off the coast of Nicaragua, apart from each other. Camock stayed with 30 of his men to explore one of the islands, San Andrés, while Elfrith took the Warwicke back to Bermuda bringing news of Providence Island. Bermuda Governor Bell wrote on behalf of Elfrith to Sir Nathaniel Rich, a businessman and cousin of the Earl of Warwick (the namesake of Warwick Parish), who presented a proposal for colonizing the island noting its strategic location &quot;lying in the heart of the Indies &amp; the mouth of the Spaniards&quot;. Elfrith was appointed admiral of the colony&#x27;s military forces in 1631, remaining the overall military commander for over seven years. During this time, Elfrith served as a guide to other privateers and sea captains arriving in the Caribbean. Elfrith invited the well-known privateer Diego el Mulato to the island. Samuel Axe, one of the military leaders, also accepted letters of marque from the Dutch authorizing privateering.

The Spanish did not hear of the Providence Island colony until 1635 when they captured some Englishmen in Portobelo, on the Isthmus of Panama. Francisco de Murga, Governor and Captain-General of Cartagena, dispatched Captain Gregorio de Castellar y Mantilla and engineer Juan de Somovilla Texada to destroy the colony. The Spanish were repelled and forced to retreat &quot;in haste and disorder&quot;. After the attack, King Charles I of England issued letters of marque to the Providence Island Company on 21 December 1635 authorizing raids on the Spanish in retaliation for a raid that had destroyed the English colony on Tortuga earlier in 1635 (Tortuga had come under the protection of the Providence Island Company. In 1635 a Spanish fleet raided Tortuga. 195 colonists were hung and 39 prisoners and 30 slaves were captured). The company could in turn issue letters of marque to subcontracting privateers who used the island as a base, for a fee. This soon became an important source of profit. Thus the company made an agreement with the merchant Maurice Thompson under which Thompson could use the island as a base in return for 20% of the booty.

In March 1636 the Company dispatched Captain Robert Hunt on the &quot;Blessing&quot; to assume the governorship of what was now viewed as a base for privateering. Depredations continued, leading to growing tension between England and Spain, which were still technically at peace.

On 11 July 1640, the Spanish Ambassador in London complained again, saying he
Nathaniel Butler, formerly Governor of Bermuda, was the last full governor of Providence Island, replacing Robert Hunt in 1638. Butler returned to England in 1640, satisfied that the fortifications were adequate, deputizing the governorship to Captain Andrew Carter.

In 1640, don Melchor de Aguilera, Governor and Captain-General of Cartagena, resolved to remove the intolerable infestation of pirates on the island. Taking advantage of having infantry from Castile and Portugal wintering in his port, he dispatched six hundred armed Spaniards from the fleet and the presidio, and two hundred black and mulatto militiamen under the leadership of don Antonio Maldonado y Tejada, his Sergeant Major, in six small frigates and a galleon. The troops were landed on the island, and a fierce fight ensued. The Spanish were forced to withdraw when a gale blew up and threatened their ships. Carter had the Spanish prisoners executed. When the Puritan leaders protested against this brutality, Carter sent four of them home in chains.
The Spanish acted decisively to avenge their defeat. General Francisco Díaz Pimienta was given orders by King Philip IV of Spain, and sailed from Cartagena to Providence with seven large ships, four pinnaces, 1,400 soldiers and 600 seamen, arriving on 19 May 1641. At first, Pimienta planned to attack the poorly defended east side, and the English rushed there to improvise defenses. With the winds against him, Pimienta changed plans and made for the main New Westminster harbor and launched his attack on 24 May. He held back his large ships to avoid damage, and used the pinnaces to attack the forts. The Spanish troops quickly gained control, and once the forts saw the Spanish flag flying over the governor&#x27;s house, they began negotiations for surrender.

On 25 May 1641, Pimienta formally took possession and celebrated mass in the church. The Spanish took sixty guns, and captured the 350 settlers who remained on the island – others had escaped to the Mosquito Coast. They took the prisoners to Cartagena. The women and children were given a passage back to England. The Spanish found gold, indigo, cochineal and six hundred black slaves on the island, worth a total of 500,000 ducats, some of the accumulated booty from the raids on Spanish ships. Rather than destroy the defenses, as instructed, Pimienta left a small garrison of 150 men to hold the island and prevent occupation by the Dutch. Later that year, Captain John Humphrey, who had been chosen to succeed Captain Butler as governor, arrived with a large group of dissatisfied settlers from New England. He found the Spanish occupying the islands, and sailed away. Pimienta&#x27;s decision to occupy the island was approved in 1643 and he was made a knight of the Order of Santiago.

===Spain and its colonies===
When Spain issued a decree blocking foreign countries from trading, selling or buying merchandise in its Caribbean colonies, the entire region became engulfed in a power struggle among the naval superpowers. The newly independent United States later became involved in this scenario, complicating the conflict. As a consequence, Spain increased the issuing of privateering contracts. These contracts allowed an income option to the inhabitants of these colonies that were not related to the Spanish conquistadores. The most well-known privateer corsairs of the eighteenth century in the Spanish colonies were Miguel Enríquez of Puerto Rico and José Campuzano-Polanco of Santo Domingo. Miguel Enríquez was a Puerto Rican mulatto who abandoned his work as a shoemaker to work as a privateer. Such was the success of Enríquez, that he became one of the wealthiest men in the New World. His fleet was composed of approx. 300 different ships during a career that spanned 35 years, becoming a military asset and reportedly outperforming the efficiency of the Armada de Barlovento. Enríquez was knighted and received the title of Don from Philip V, something unheard of due to his ethnic and social background. One of the most famous privateers from Spain was Amaro Pargo.

=== France ===
&quot;Corsairs&quot; (French: corsaire) were privateers, authorized to conduct raids on shipping of a nation at war with France, on behalf of the French Crown. Seized vessels and cargo were sold at auction, with the corsair captain entitled to a portion of the proceeds. Although not French Navy personnel, corsairs were considered legitimate combatants in France (and allied nations), provided the commanding officer of the vessel was in possession of a valid Letter of Marque (fr. &quot;Lettre de Marque&quot; or &quot;Lettre de Course&quot;), and the officers and crew conducted themselves according to contemporary admiralty law. By acting on behalf of the French Crown, if captured by the enemy, they could claim treatment as prisoners of war, instead of being considered pirates. Because corsairs gained a swashbuckling reputation, the word &quot;corsair&quot; is also used generically as a more romantic or flamboyant way of referring to privateers, or even to pirates. The Barbary pirates of North Africa as well as Ottomans were sometimes called &quot;Turkish corsairs&quot;.

=== Malta ===
Corsairing () was an important aspect of Malta&#x27;s economy when the island was ruled by the Order of St. John, although the practice had begun earlier. Corsairs sailed on privately owned ships on behalf of the Grand Master of the Order, and were authorized to attack Muslim ships, usually merchant ships from the Ottoman Empire. The corsairs included knights of the Order, native Maltese people, as well as foreigners. When they captured a ship, the goods were sold and the crew and passengers were ransomed or enslaved, and the Order took a percentage of the value of the booty. Corsairing remained common until the end of the 18th century.

=== United States ===
====British Colonial period====
During King George&#x27;s War, approximately 36,000 Americans served aboard privateers at one time or another. During the Nine Years War, the French adopted a policy of strongly encouraging privateers, including the famous Jean Bart, to attack English and Dutch shipping. England lost roughly 4,000 merchant ships during the war. In the following War of Spanish Succession, privateer attacks continued, Britain losing 3,250 merchant ships.

In the subsequent conflict, the War of Austrian Succession, the Royal Navy was able to concentrate more on defending British ships. Britain lost 3,238 merchantmen, a smaller fraction of her merchant marine than the enemy losses of 3,434. While French losses were proportionally severe, the smaller but better protected Spanish trade suffered the least and it was Spanish privateers who enjoyed much of the best-allied plunder of British trade, particularly in the West Indies.

==== American Revolutionary War ====


During the American Revolutionary War, the Continental Congress, and some state governments (on their own initiative), issued privateering licenses, authorizing &quot;legal piracy&quot;, to merchant captains in an effort to take prizes from the British Navy and Tory (Loyalist) privateers. This was done due to the relatively small number of commissioned American naval vessels and the pressing need for prisoner exchange.
About 55,000 American seamen served aboard the privateers. They quickly sold their prizes, dividing their profits with the financier (persons or company) and the state (colony). Long Island Sound became a hornets&#x27; nest of privateering activity during the American Revolution (1775–1783), as most transports to and from New York went through the Sound. New London, Connecticut was a chief privateering port for the American colonies, leading to the British Navy blockading it in 1778–1779. Chief financiers of privateering included Thomas &amp; Nathaniel Shaw of New London and John McCurdy of Lyme. In the months before the British raid on New London and Groton, a New London privateer took &quot;Hannah&quot; in what is regarded as the largest prize taken by any American privateer during the war. Retribution was likely part of Gov. Clinton&#x27;s (NY) motivation for Arnold&#x27;s Raid, as the &quot;Hannah&quot; had carried many of his most cherished items.

American privateers are thought to have seized up to 300 British ships during the war. The British ship &quot;Jack&quot; was captured and turned into an American privateer, only to be captured again by the British in the naval battle off Halifax, Nova Scotia. American privateers not only fought naval battles but also raided numerous communities in British colonies, such as the Raid on Lunenburg, Nova Scotia (1782).

The United States Constitution authorized the U.S. Congress to grant letters of marque and reprisal. Between the end of the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812, less than 30 years, Britain, France, Naples, the Barbary States, Spain, and the Netherlands seized approximately 2,500 American ships. Payments in ransom and tribute to the Barbary states amounted to 20% of United States government annual revenues in 1800 and would lead the United States to fight the Barbary states in the First Barbary War and Second Barbary Wars.

==== War of 1812 ====

During the War of 1812, both the British and the American governments used privateers, and the established system was very similar. U.S. Congress declared that war be and the same is hereby declared to exist between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the dependencies thereof, and the United States of America and their Territories; and that the President of the United States is herby authorized to use the whole land and naval force of the United States to carry the same into effect, and to issue to private armed vessels of the United States commissions of marque and general reprisal, in such forms as he shall think proper, and under the seal of the United States, against the vessels, goods, and effects of the Government of the said United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and the subjects thereof.President Madison issued 500 letters of marque authorizing privateers. Overall some 200 of the ships took prizes. The cost of buying and fitting of a large privateer was about $40,000 and prizes could net $100,000.

Captain Thomas Boyle was one of the famous and successful American privateers. He commanded the Baltimore schooner &quot;Comet&quot; and then later in the war the Baltimore clipper &quot;Chasseur&quot;. He captured over 50 British merchant ships during the war. One source estimated a total damage to the British merchant navy from &quot;Chasseur&quot;&#x27;s 1813-1815 activities at one and a half million dollars. In total, the Baltimore privateer fleet of 122 ships sunk or seized 500 British ships with an estimated value of $16 million, which accounts about one-third of all the value of all prizes taken over the course of the whole war. 
On April 8, 1814, the British attacked Essex, Connecticut, and burned the ships in the harbor, due to the construction there of a number of privateers. This was the greatest financial loss of the entire War of 1812 suffered by the Americans. However, the private fleet of James De Wolf, which sailed under the flag of the American government in 1812, was most likely a key factor in the naval campaign of the war. De Wolf&#x27;s ship, the &quot;Yankee&quot;, was possibly the most financially successful ship of the war. Privateers proved to be far more successful than their US Navy counterparts, claiming three-quarters of the 1600 British merchant ships taken during the war (although a third of these were recaptured prior to making landfall). One of the more successful of these ships was the &quot;Prince de Neufchatel&quot;, which once captured nine British prizes in swift succession in the English Channel.

Jean Lafitte and his privateers aided US General Andrew Jackson in the defeat of the British in the Battle of New Orleans in order to receive full pardons for their previous crimes. Jackson formally requested clemency for Lafitte and the men who had served under him, and the US government granted them all a full pardon on February 6, 1815.

However, many of the ships captured by the Americans were recaptured by the Royal Navy. British convoy systems honed during the Napoleonic Wars limited losses to singleton ships, and the effective blockade of American and continental ports prevented captured ships being taken in for sale. This ultimately led to orders forbidding US privateers from attempting to bring their prizes in to port, with captured ships instead having to be burnt. Over 200 American privateer ships were captured by the Royal Navy, many of which were turned on their former owners and used by the British blockading forces. Nonetheless, during the War of 1812 the privateers &quot;swept out from America&#x27;s coasts, capturing and sinking as many as 2,500 British ships and doing approximately $40 million worth of damage to the British economy.&quot;
==== 1856 Declaration of Paris ====
The US was not one of the initial signatories of the 1856 Declaration of Paris which outlawed privateering, and the Confederate Constitution authorized use of privateers. However, the US did offer to adopt the terms of the Declaration during the American Civil War, when the Confederates sent several privateers to sea before putting their main effort in the more effective commissioned raiders.

==== American Civil War ====
During the American Civil War, privateering took on several forms including blockade running, while privateering generally occurred in the interests of both the North and the South. Letters of marque would often be issued to private shipping companies and other private owners of ships, authorizing them to engage vessels deemed to be unfriendly to the issuing government. Crews of ships were awarded the cargo and other prizes aboard any captured vessel as an incentive to search far and wide for ships attempting to supply the Confederacy, or aid the Union, as the case may be.

During the Civil War Confederate President Jefferson Davis issued letters of marque to anyone who would employ their ship to either attack Union shipping or bring badly needed supplies through the Union blockade into southern ports.

Most of the supplies brought into the Confederacy were carried aboard privately owned vessels. When word came about that the Confederacy was willing to pay almost any price for military supplies, various interested parties designed and built specially designed lightweight seagoing steamers, blockade runners specifically designed and built to outrun Union ships on blockade patrol.

Neither the United States nor Spain authorized privateers in their war in 1898.

===Latin America===
Warships were recruited by the insurgent governments during Spanish American wars of independence to destroy Spanish trade, and capture Spanish Merchant vessels. The private armed vessels came largely from the United States. Seamen from Britain, the United States, and France often manned these ships.

<text>A people mover or automated people mover (APM) is a type of small scale automated guideway transit system. The term is generally used only to describe systems serving relatively small areas such as airports, downtown districts or theme parks.

The term was originally applied to three different systems, developed roughly at the same time. One was Skybus, an automated mass transit system prototyped by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation beginning in 1964. The second, alternately called the People Mover and Minirail, opened in Montreal at Expo 67. Finally the last, called PeopleMover or WEDway PeopleMover, was an attraction that was originally presented by Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company and that opened at Disneyland in 1967.
Now, however, the term &quot;people mover&quot; is generic, and may use technologies such as monorail, rail tracks or maglev. Propulsion may involve conventional on-board electric motors, linear motors or cable traction.

Generally speaking, larger APMs are referred to by other names. The most generic is &quot;automated guideway transit&quot;, which encompasses any automated system regardless of size. Some complex APMs deploy fleets of small vehicles over a track network with off-line stations, and supply near non-stop service to passengers. These taxi-like systems are more usually referred to as personal rapid transit (PRT). Larger systems, with vehicles with 20 to 40 passengers, are sometimes referred to as &quot;group rapid transit&quot; (GRT), although this term is not particularly common. Other complex APMs have similar characteristics to rapid transit systems, and there is no clear cut distinction between a complex APM of this type and an automated mass transit system. Another term &quot;light metro&quot; is also applied to describe the system worldwide.

==History==
===Never-Stop Railway===

One of the first automated systems for human transportation was the screw-driven &#x27;Never-Stop-Railway&#x27;, constructed for the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley, London in 1924. This railway consisted of 88 unmanned carriages, on a continuous double track along the northern and eastern sides of the exhibition, with reversing loops at either end.

The carriages ran on two parallel concrete beams and were guided by pulleys running on the inner side of these concrete beams, and were propelled by gripping a revolving screw thread running between the tracks in a pit; by adjusting the pitch of this thread at different points, the carriages could be sped up, or slowed down to a walking pace at stations, to allow passengers to join and leave. The railway ran reliably for the two years of the exhibition, and was then dismantled.

=== Goodyear and Stephens-Adamson ===
In late 1949, Mike Kendall, chief engineer and Chairman of the Board of Stephens-Adamson Manufacturing Company, an Illinois-based manufacturer of conveyor belts and systems, asked Al Neilson, an engineer in the Industrial Products Division of Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co., if Goodyear had ever considered working on People Movers. He felt that with Goodyear&#x27;s ability to move materials in large quantities on conveyor belts they should consider moving batches of people.

Four years of engineering design, development and testing led to a joint patent being issued for three types of people movers, named Speedwalk, Speedramp, and Carveyor.
Goodyear would sell the concept and Stephens-Adamson would manufacture and install the components.

A Speedwalk consisted of a flat conveyor belt riding on a series of rollers, or a flat slippery surface, moving at (approximately half the speed of walking). The passengers would walk onto the belt and could stand or walk to the exit point. They were supported by a moving handrail. Customers were expected to include airport terminals, ballparks, train stations, etc. Today, several manufacturers produce similar units called moving walkways.

A Speedramp was very similar to a Speedwalk but it was used to change elevations; up or down a floor level. This could have been accomplished by an escalator, but the Speedramp would allow wheeled luggage, small handcarts etc. to ride the belt at an operating cost predicted to be much lower than escalators or elevators. The first successful installation of a Speedramp was in the spring of 1954 at the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad Station in Jersey City, New Jersey, to connect the Erie Railroad to the Hudson and Manhattan Tubes. This unit was long with a rise of on a 15 degree grade, and only cost $75,000.

A Carveyor consisted of many small cubicles or cars carrying ten people riding on a flat conveyor belt from point A to point B. The belt rode on a series of motorized rollers. The purpose of the motorized rollers was to facilitate the gradual acceleration and deceleration speeds on the conveyor belt and overcome the tendency of all belts to stretch at start up and during shutdown. At point &quot;A&quot; passengers would enter a Speedwalk running parallel to the belts and cars of the Carveyor. The cars would be moving at the same speed as the Speedwalk; the passengers would enter the cars and be seated, while the motorized rollers would increase the speed of the cars up to the traveling speed (which would be preset depending on the distance to be covered). At point B Passengers could disembark and by means of a series of flat slower belts (Speedwalks) go to other Carveyors to other destinations or out to the street. The cars at point B would continue on rollers around a semicircle and then reverse the process carrying passengers back to point A. The initial installation was to be the 42nd Street Shuttle in New York City between Times Square and Grand Central station.

The first mention of the Carveyor in a hardback book was in &quot;There&#x27;s Adventure in Civil Engineering&quot; by Neil P. Ruzic (1958), one of a series of books published by &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; in the 1950s in their &quot;Career&quot; series. In the book the Carveyor was already installed and operational in downtown Los Angeles.

Colonel Sydney H. Bingham, Chairman of the New York City Board of Transportation, had several meetings with a group of architects who were trying to revamp the whole New York City Subway system in the heart of town to connect Pennsylvania Station, Madison Square Garden, Times Square, Grand Central and several new office complexes together. Several of these architects were involved in other programs, and in later years many variations of the Carveyor people movers were developed.

In November 1954 the New York City Transit Authority issued an order to Goodyear and Stephens-Adamson to build a complete Carveyor system between Times Square and Grand Central. A brief summary and confirmation can be found in &quot;Time&quot; magazine on November 15, 1954. under the heading &quot;Subway of the Future&quot;. The cost was to be under $4 million, but the order was never fulfilled due to political difficulties.

Chocolate World in Hershey, Pennsylvania, Disneyland in California, and Walt Disney World in Florida are among many locations that have used variations of the Carveyor concept.

=== Other developments ===

The term &#x27;people mover&#x27; was used by Walt Disney, when he and his Imagineers were working on the new 1967 Tomorrowland at Disneyland. The name was used as a working title for a new attraction, the PeopleMover. According to Imagineer Bob Gurr, &quot;the name got stuck,&quot; and it was no longer a working title.

Starting in the late 1960s and into the 1970s, people movers were the topic of intense development around the world. Worried about the growing congestion and pollution in downtown areas due to the spread of cars, many countries started studying mass transit systems that would lower capital costs to the point where any city could afford to deploy them. Most of these systems used elevated guideways, which were much less expensive to deploy than tunnels. However, elevating the track causes problems with noise, so traditional steel-wheel-on-rail solutions were rare as they squealed when rounding bends in the rails. Rubber tired solutions were common, but some systems used hovercraft techniques or various magnetic levitation systems.

Two major government funded APM projects are notable. In Germany, Mannesmann Demag and Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm developed a system known as Cabinentaxi during the 1970s. Cabinentaxi featured small cars with from four to eight seats that were called to pick up passengers on-demand and drove directly to their destination. The stations were &quot;offline&quot;, allowing the cabs to stop by moving off the main lines while other cars continued to their destinations. The system was designed so the cars could be adapted to run on top or bottom of the track (but not easily converted from one to the other), allowing dual-track movements from a single elevated guideway only slightly wider than the cars. A test track was completed in 1975 and ran until development was completed in 1979, but no deployments followed and the companies abandoned the system shortly thereafter.

In the U.S., a 1966 federal bill provided funding that led to the development of APM systems under the Downtown People Mover Program. Four systems were developed, Rohr&#x27;s ROMAG, LTV&#x27;s AirTrans, Ford&#x27;s APT and Otis Elevator&#x27;s hovercraft design. A major presentation of the systems was organized as TRANSPO&#x27;72 at Dulles International Airport, where the various systems were presented to delegations from numerous cities in the US. Prototype systems and test tracks were built during the 1970s. 

One notable example was Pittsburgh&#x27;s Skybus, which was proposed by the Port Authority of Allegheny County to replace its streetcar system, which, having large stretches of private right of way, was not suited for bus conversion. A short demonstration line was set up in South Park and large tracts of land were secured for its facilities. However, opposition arose to the notion that it would replace the streetcar system. This, combined with the immaturity of the technology and other factors, led the Port Authority to abandon the project and pursue alternatives. By the start of the 1980s most politicians had lost interest in the concept and the project was repeatedly de-funded in the early 1980s. Only two APMs were developed as a part of the People Mover Program in the U.S., the Metromover in Miami, and the Detroit People Mover. The Jacksonville Skyway was built in the late 1980s.

==From development to implementation==
Although many systems were generally considered failures, several APM systems developed by other groups have been much more successful. Lighter systems with shorter tracks are widely deployed at airports; the world&#x27;s first airport people movers, the Tampa International Airport People Movers, were installed in 1971 at Tampa International Airport in the United States. APMs have now become common at large airports and hospitals in the United States.

Driverless metros have become common in Europe and parts of Asia. The economics of automated trains tend to reduce the scale so tied to &quot;mass&quot; transit (the largest operating expense is the driver&#x27;s salary, which is only affordable if very large numbers of passengers are paying fares), so that small-scale installations are feasible. Thus cities normally thought of as too small to build a metro (e.g. Rennes, Lausanne, Brescia, etc.) are now doing so.

On September 30, 2006, the Peachliner in Komaki, Aichi Prefecture, Japan, became that nation&#x27;s first people mover to cease operations.

<text>A ferry is a boat that transports passengers, and occasionally vehicles and cargo, across a body of water. A small passenger ferry with multiple stops, like those in Venice, Italy, is sometimes referred to as a water taxi or water bus.

Ferries form a part of the public transport systems of many waterside cities and islands, allowing direct transit between points at a capital cost much lower than bridges or tunnels. Ship connections of much larger distances (such as over long distances in water bodies like the Baltic Sea) may also be called ferry services, and many carry vehicles.

==History==
The profession of the ferryman is embodied in Greek mythology in Charon, the boatman who transported souls across the River Styx to the Underworld.

Speculation that a pair of oxen propelled a ship having a water wheel can be found in 4th century Roman literature &quot;Anonymus De Rebus Bellicis&quot;. Though impractical, there is no reason why it could not work and such a ferry, modified by using horses, was used in Lake Champlain in 19th-century America. See Experiment (horse powered boat).

In 1850 the roll-on roll-off (ro-ro) ferry, &quot;Leviathan&quot; designed to carry freight wagons efficiently across the Firth of Forth in Scotland started to operate between Granton, near Edinburgh, and Burntisland in Fife. The vessel design was highly innovative and the ability to move freight in great quantities and with minimal labour signalled the way ahead for sea-borne transport, converting the ro-ro ferry from an experimental and marginal ship type into one of central importance in the transport of goods and passengers.

In 1871, the world&#x27;s first car ferry crossed the Bosphorus in Istanbul. The iron steamship, named &quot;Suhulet&quot; (meaning &#x27;ease&#x27; or &#x27;convenience&#x27;) was designed by the general manager of Şirket-i Hayriye (Bosporus Steam Navigation Company), Giritli Hüseyin Haki Bey and built by the Greenwich shipyard of Maudslay, Sons and Field. It weighed 157 tons, was long, wide and had a draft of . It was capable of travelling up to 6 knots with the side wheel turned by its 450-horsepower, single-cylinder, two-cycle steam engine. Launched in 1872, Suhulet&#x27;s unique features consisted of a symmetrical entry and exit for horse carriages, along with a dual system of hatchways. The ferry operated on the Üsküdar-Kabataş route, which is still serviced by modern ferries today.

==Notable services==
===Asia===
In Hong Kong, Star Ferry carries passengers across Victoria Harbour. Other carriers ferry travelers between Hong Kong Island and outlying islands like Cheung Chau, Lantau Island and Lamma Island.

In the Philippines, the Philippine Nautical Highway System forms the backbone of the nationwide transport system by integrating ports with highway systems; the system has three main routes. Another known ferry service is the Pasig River Ferry Service, which is the only water-based transportation in Metro Manila. This system cruises the Pasig River.

==== Bangladesh ====

====India====
India&#x27;s ro-ro ferry service between Ghogha and Dahej was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 22 October 2017. It aims to connect South Gujarat and Saurashtra currently separated by of roadway to of ferry service. It is a part of the larger Sagar Mala project.

Water transport in Mumbai consists of ferries, hovercraft, and catamarans, operated by various government agencies as well as private entities. The Kerala State Water Transport Department (SWTD), operating under the Ministry of Transport, Government of Kerala, India regulates the inland navigation systems in the Indian state of Kerala and provides inland water transport facilities. It stands for catering to the passenger and cargo traffic needs of the inhabitants of the waterlogged areas of the Districts of Alappuzha, Kottayam, Kollam, Ernakulam, Kannur and Kasargode. SWTD ferry service is also one of the most affordable modes to enjoy the beauty of the scenic Kerala backwaters.

====Indonesia====
As the largest archipelagic country, Indonesia has several ferry routes which is managed mostly by PT. ASDP Indonesia Ferry (Persero) and several private companies. ASDP_Indonesia_Ferry or ASDP is a state-owned company engaged in the business of integrated ferry and port services and waterfront tourist destinations. ASDP operates a ferry fleet of more than 160 units handling more than 300 routes in 36 ports throughout Indonesia.

====Japan====

Japan used to rely heavily on ferries for passenger and goods transportation among the four main islands of Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu. However, as highway and railway bridges and undersea tunnels (such as the Seikan Tunnel and Honshū–Shikoku Bridge Project) have been constructed, the ferry transportation has recently become for short-distance sightseeing passengers with or without car, and for long-distance truck drivers hauling goods.
====Malaysia====

The Malaysian state of Penang is home to the oldest ferry service in the country. The first regular ferry service operating across the Penang Strait between George Town and Province Wellesley (now Seberang Perai) was launched in 1894 by Quah Beng Kee and his brothers. The iconic yellow double-deck roll-on/roll-off (RORO) ferries were introduced in 1957. Between 1959 and 2002, a total of 15 vessels were commissioned for the service.

Currently operated by the Penang Port Commission, the ferry service has evolved over the decades. The RORO ferries were retired in 2021, with speedboats temporarily replacing them. In 2023, these speedboats were succeeded by four newly-built catamarans, which now serve only passengers and motorcyclists. These catamarans operate between the Raja Tun Uda Ferry Terminal in George Town and the Sultan Abdul Halim Ferry Terminal in Seberang Perai.

=== Russian Federation ===

Due to the geographical features of Russia, it has a large number of both sea and river ferry crossings. Car ferries operate from the continental part of Russia to Sakhalin, Kamchatka and Japan. The Ust-Luga – Kaliningrad ferry also runs, until February 2022 ferries also ran from St. Petersburg to different cities of the Baltic Sea. Before the construction of the Kerch Bridge, there was a ferry across the Kerch Strait, whose service was resumed after the Kerch bridge explosion.
There are also more than 100 ferry crossings on different rivers in Russia. These are usually symmetrical through ferries with two ramps for quick entry and exit of cars. For some categories of car owners, these ferries may be free if there is no alternative crossing of the river.

===Europe===

==== Great Britain ====
The busiest seaway in the world, the English Channel, connects Great Britain and mainland Europe, with ships sailing from the UK ports of Dover, Newhaven, Poole, Portsmouth and Plymouth to French ports, such as Calais, Dunkirk, Dieppe, Roscoff, Cherbourg-Octeville, Caen, St Malo and Le Havre. The busiest ferry route to France is the Dover to Calais crossing with approximately 9,168,000 passengers using the service in 2018. Ferries from Great Britain also sail to Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain and Ireland. Some ferries carry mainly tourist traffic, but most also carry freight, and some are exclusively for the use of freight lorries. In Britain, car-carrying ferries are sometimes referred to as RORO (roll-on, roll-off) for the ease by which vehicles can board and leave.

==== Denmark ====
The busiest single ferry route in terms of the number of departures is across the northern part of Øresund, between Helsingborg, Scania, Sweden and Elsinore, Denmark. Before the Øresund bridge was opened in July 2000, car and &quot;car and train&quot; ferries departed up to seven times every hour (every 8.5 minutes). This has since been reduced, but a car ferry still departs from each harbor every 15 minutes during daytime. The route is around and the crossing takes 22 minutes. Today, all ferries on this route are constructed so that they do not need to turn around in the harbors. This also means that the ferries lack stems and sterns, since the vessels sail in both directions. Starboard and port-side are dynamic, depending on the direction the ferry sails. Despite the short crossing, the ferries are equipped with restaurants (on three out of four ferries), cafeterias, and kiosks. Passengers without cars often make a double or triple return journey in the restaurants; for this, a single journey ticket is sufficient. Passenger and bicycle passenger tickets are inexpensive compared with longer routes.

==== Baltic Sea ====
Large cruiseferries sail in the Baltic Sea between Finland, Åland, Sweden, Estonia, Latvia and Saint Petersburg, Russia. In many ways, these ferries are like cruise ships, but they can also carry hundreds of cars on car decks. Besides providing passenger and car transport across the sea, Baltic Sea cruise-ferries are a popular tourist destination unto themselves, with multiple restaurants, nightclubs, bars, shops and entertainment on board. Helsinki was the busiest international passenger ferry port in the world in 2017 with over 11.8 million passengers whilst the second business international ferry port, Dover, had 11.7 million passengers. The Helsinki-Tallinn route alone accounted for nine million passengers. In 2022 the port of Helsinki had almost 8 million passengers, of which 6.3 million travelled between Helsinki and Tallinn. Additionally many smaller ferries operate on domestic routes in Finland, Sweden and Estonia.

The south-west and southern parts of the Baltic Sea has several routes mainly for heavy traffic and cars. The ferry routes of Rødby-Puttgarden, Trelleborg-Rostock, Trelleborg-Travemünde, Trelleborg-Świnoujście, Gedser-Rostock, Gdynia-Karlskrona, and Ystad-Świnoujście are all typical &quot;transports&quot; ferries. On the longer of these routes, simple cabins are available. Some of these routes previously also carried trains, but since 2020 these trains are instead routed around the Baltic via the Great Belt fixed link and Jutland.

==== Turkey ====
In Istanbul, ferries connect the European and Asian shores of Bosphorus, as well as Princes&#x27; Islands and nearby coastal towns. In 2014, İDO transported 47 million passengers, the largest ferry system in the world.

==== Italy ====

The largest ferry system in Italy is in Venice. The city&#x27;s &quot;water taxis&quot; (Italian: &quot;taxi d&#x27;acqua&quot;) provide service all around the city&#x27;s canals. They can carry up to 10 people. They operate on a series of lines that stop at different locations around Venice.

==== Sweden ====
The world&#x27;s shortest ferry line is the Ferry Lina in Töreboda, Sweden. It takes around 20–25 seconds and is hand powered.

===North America===

==== Canada ====
Due to the numbers of large freshwater lakes and length of shoreline in Canada, various provinces and territories have ferry services.

BC Ferries operates the third largest ferry service in the world which carries travellers between Vancouver Island and the British Columbia mainland on the country&#x27;s west coast. This ferry service operates to other islands including the Gulf Islands and Haida Gwaii. In 2015, BC Ferries carried more than 8 million vehicles and 20 million passengers. In Vancouver there is SeaBus.

Canada&#x27;s east coast has been home to numerous inter- and intra-provincial ferry and coastal services, including a large network operated by the federal government under CN Marine and later Marine Atlantic. Private and publicly owned ferry operations in eastern Canada include Marine Atlantic, serving the island of Newfoundland, as well as Bay, NFL, CTMA, Coastal Transport, and STQ. Canadian waters in the Great Lakes once hosted numerous ferry services, but these have been reduced to those offered by Owen Sound Transportation and several smaller operations. There are also several commuter passenger ferry services operated in major cities, such as Metro Transit in Halifax, and Toronto Island ferries in Toronto. There is also the Société des traversiers du Québec.

==== United States ====
Due to the North Carolina coast&#x27;s geography, consisting of numerous sounds, inlets, tidal arms, and islands, ferry transportation is essential in the region. The state operates twelve routes, eight of which are under the oversight of the North Carolina Department of Transportation Ferry Division, three of which are under the direct oversight of the North Carolina Department of Transportation, and one of which is under the oversight of the North Carolina Division of Parks and Recreation. Three of the Ferry Division routes are tolled, and all ferry routes operated by the North Carolina Department of Transportation carry both vehicles and pedestrians, although certain vessels only carry pedestrians and cyclists. The National Park Service additionally works with private companies to offer ferry service to locations such as Cape Lookout and Portsmouth.

Washington State Ferries operates the most extensive ferry system in the continental United States and the second largest in the world by vehicles carried, with ten routes on Puget Sound and the Strait of Juan de Fuca serving terminals in Washington and Vancouver Island. In 2016, Washington State Ferries carried 10.5 million vehicles and 24.2 million riders in total.

The Alaska Marine Highway System provides service between Bellingham, Washington, and various towns and villages throughout Southeast and Southwest Alaska, including crossings of the Gulf of Alaska. AMHS provides affordable access to many small communities with no road connection or airport.

The Staten Island Ferry in New York City, sailing between the boroughs of Manhattan and Staten Island, is the nation&#x27;s single busiest ferry route by passenger volume. Unlike riders on many other ferry services, Staten Island Ferry passengers do not pay any fare to ride it. New York City also has a network of smaller ferries, or &quot;water taxis&quot;, that shuttle commuters along the Hudson River from locations in New Jersey and Northern Manhattan down to the midtown, downtown and Wall Street business centers. Several ferry companies also offer service linking midtown and lower Manhattan with locations in the boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn, crossing the city&#x27;s East River. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced in February 2015 that city would begin an expanded Citywide Ferry Service, and launched as NYC Ferry in 2017, linking heretofore relatively isolated communities such as Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side, Soundview in The Bronx, Astoria and the Rockaways in Queens and such Brooklyn neighborhoods as Bay Ridge, Sunset Park, and Red Hook with existing ferry landings in Lower Manhattan and Midtown Manhattan. A second expansion phase connected Staten Island to the West Side of Manhattan, and added a stop in Throgs Neck, in the Bronx. NYC Ferry is now the largest passenger fleet in the United States.

The New Orleans area also has many ferries that carry both vehicles and pedestrians. Most notable is the Algiers Ferry, which has been in continuous operation since 1827 and is one of the oldest operating ferries in North America.
In New England, vehicle-carrying ferry services between mainland Cape Cod and the islands of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard and Nantucket are operated by The Woods Hole, Martha&#x27;s Vineyard and Nantucket Steamship Authority, which sails year-round between Woods Hole and Vineyard Haven as well as Hyannis and Nantucket. Seasonal service is also operated from Woods Hole to Oak Bluffs during the summer and fall. As there are no bridges or tunnels connecting the islands to the mainland, The Steamship Authority ferries in addition to being the only method for transporting private cars to or from the islands, also ferry heavy freight and supplies, such as construction materials and fuel, competing with tug and barge companies. Additionally, Hy-Line Cruises operates high-speed catamaran service from Hyannis to both islands, and several smaller operations run seasonal passenger-only service primarily geared towards tourist day-trippers from other mainland ports, including New Bedford, (New Bedford Fast Ferry) Falmouth, (Island Queen ferry and Falmouth Ferry) and Harwich (Freedom Cruise Line). Ferries also bring riders and vehicles across Long Island Sound to such Connecticut cities as Bridgeport and New London, and to Block Island in Rhode Island from points on Long Island.

Transbay commuting in the San Francisco Bay Area was primarily ferry-based until the advent of automobiles in the 1940s, and most bridges in the area were built to supplant ferry services. By the 1970s, ferries were primarily used by tourists with Golden Gate Ferry, an organization under the ownership of the same governing body as the Golden Gate Bridge, left as the sole commute operator. The 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake prompted the restoration of service to the East Bay. The modern ferry network is primarily under the authority of San Francisco Bay Ferry, connecting with cities as far as Vallejo. Tourist excursions are also offered by Blue &amp; Gold Fleet and Red &amp; White Fleet. A ferry serves Angel Island (which also accepts private craft). Alcatraz is served exclusively by ferry service administered by the National Park Service.
Until the completion of the Mackinac Bridge in the 1950s, ferries were used for vehicle transportation between the Lower and the Upper Peninsulas of Michigan, across the Straits of Mackinac in the United States. Ferry service for bicycles and passengers continues across the straits for transport to Mackinac Island, where motorized vehicles are almost completely prohibited. This crossing is made possible by two ferry lines Shepler&#x27;s Ferry and Mackinac Island Ferry Company (formerly Star Line).

A ferry service runs between Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Muskegon, Michigan operated by Lake Express. Another ferry SS Badger operates between Manitowoc, Wisconsin and Ludington, Michigan. Both cross Lake Michigan.

Numerous additional inland ferry routes exist in the United States, such as the Cave-In-Rock Ferry across the Ohio River, and the Benton-Houston Ferry across the Tennessee River.

===== Modernization of ferry system =====
The FTA announced in September 2024 that it would award $300 million in grants to modernize ferry systems in the United States. These grants will support 18 projects across 14 states, emphasizing upgrading environmentally friendly propulsion systems. Eight of the 18 projects will receive funding for this purpose.

One notable project is the San Francisco ferry system, which will receive $11.5 million to improve the connection between Treasure Island and Mission Bay. In Maine, the ferry system will be upgraded in Lincolnville and Islesboro. Additionally, Alaska will receive a significant $106.4 million grant to replace a 60-year-old vessel operating in the southwest. This vessel is a crucial connector for the region.

These grants are part of the FTA&#x27;s efforts to improve ferry transportation in the United States and promote sustainable transportation options.

==== Mexico ====
Mexico has ferry services run by Baja Ferries that connect La Paz located on the Baja California Peninsula with Mazatlán and Topolobampo. Passenger ferries also run from Playa del Carmen to the island of Cozumel.
===South America===
There are several ferries in South America.

Chacao Channel has ferry lines.

===Oceania===

==== Australia ====
In Australia, two Spirit of Tasmania ferries carry passengers and vehicles across Bass Strait, the body of water that separates Tasmania from the Australian mainland, often under turbulent sea conditions. These run overnight but also include day crossings in peak time. Both ferries are based in the northern Tasmanian port city of Devonport and sail to Geelong. Before Geelong this ferry used to sail to Melbourne.

The double-ended Freshwater-class ferry cuts an iconic shape as it makes its way up and down Sydney Harbour New South Wales, Australia between Manly and Circular Quay.

==== New Zealand ====
In New Zealand, ferries connect Wellington in the North Island with Picton in the South Island, linking New Zealand&#x27;s two main islands. The route is , and is run by two companies – government-owned Interislander, and independent Bluebridge, who say the trip takes three and half hours.

==Types==
Ferry designs depend on the length of the route, the passenger or vehicle capacity required, speed requirements and the water conditions the craft must deal with.

===Double-ended===

Double-ended ferries have interchangeable bows and sterns, allowing them to shuttle back and forth between two terminals without having to turn around. Well-known double-ended ferry systems include the BC Ferries, the Staten Island Ferry, Washington State Ferries, Star Ferry, several ferries on the North Carolina Ferry System, and the Lake Champlain Transportation Company. Most Norwegian fjord and coastal ferries are double-ended vessels. All ferries from southern Prince Edward Island to the mainland of Canada were double-ended. This service was discontinued upon completion of the Confederation Bridge. Some ferries in Sydney, Australia and British Columbia are also double-ended. In 2008, BC Ferries launched the first of the Coastal-class ferries, which at the time were the world&#x27;s largest double enders. These were surpassed as the world&#x27;s largest double-enders when P&amp;O Ferries launched their first double-ender, called the P&amp;O Pioneer, which entered service in June 2023 replacing Pride of Kent.

===Hydrofoil===
Hydrofoils have the advantage of higher cruising speeds, succeeding hovercraft on some English Channel routes where the ferries now compete against the Eurotunnel and Eurostar trains that use the Channel Tunnel. Passenger-only hydrofoils also proved a practical, fast and relatively economical solution in the Canary Islands, but were recently replaced by faster catamaran &quot;high speed&quot; ferries that can carry cars. Their replacement by the larger craft is seen by critics as a retrograde step given that the new vessels use much more fuel and foster the inappropriate use of cars in islands already suffering from the impact of mass tourism.

===Hovercraft===

Hovercraft were developed in the 1960s and 1970s to carry cars. The largest was the massive SR.N4 which carried cars in its centre section with ramps at the bow and stern between England and France. The hovercraft was superseded by catamarans which are nearly as fast and are less affected by sea and weather conditions. Only one service now remains, a foot passenger service between Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight run by Hovertravel.

===Catamaran===

Since 1990 high speed catamarans have revolutionised ferry services, replacing hovercraft, hydrofoils and conventional monohull ferries. In the 1990s there were a variety of builders, but the industry has consolidated to two builders of large vehicular ferries between 60 and 120 metres. Incat of Hobart, Tasmania favours a Wave-piercing hull to deliver a smooth ride, while Austal of Perth, Western Australia builds ships based on SWATH designs. Both these companies also compete in the smaller river ferry industry with a number of other ship builders.

Stena Line once operated the largest catamarans in the world, the Stena HSS class, between the United Kingdom and Ireland. These waterjet-powered vessels, displaced 19,638 tonnes, accommodating 375 passenger cars and 1,500 passengers. Other examples of these super-size catamarans are found in the Condor Ferries fleet with the Condor Voyager and Rapide.

===Roll-on/roll-off===

Roll-on/roll-off ferries (RORO) are large conventional ferries named for the ease by which vehicles can board and leave.

=== Cruiseferry / RoPax ===
A cruiseferry is a ship that combines the features of a cruise ship with a roll-on/roll-off ferry. They are also known as RoPax for their combined Roll on/Roll Off and passenger design.

===Fast RoPax ferry===

Fast RoPax ferries are conventional ferries with a large garage intake and a relatively large passenger capacity, with conventional diesel propulsion and propellers that sail over . Pioneering this class of ferries was Attica Group, when it introduced Superfast I between Greece and Italy in 1995 through its subsidiary company Superfast Ferries. Cabins, if existent, are much smaller than those on cruise ships.

===Turntable ferry===

This type of ferry allows vehicles to load from the &quot;side&quot;. The vehicle platform can be turned. When loading, the platform is turned sideways to allow sideways loading of vehicles. Then the platform is turned back, in line with the vessel, and the journey across water is made.

===Pontoon ferry===
Pontoon ferries and flat-bottomed boats such as punts carry passengers and vehicles across rivers and lakes and are widely used in less-developed countries with large rivers where the cost of bridge construction is prohibitive. One or more vehicles are carried on such ferries with ramps at either end for vehicles or animals to board. Cable ferries are usually pontoon ferries. In the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany many such small cable ferries exist and are called püntes.

===Train ferry===
A train ferry is a ship designed to carry railway vehicles. Typically, one level of the ship is fitted with railway tracks, and the vessel has a door at either or both of the front and rear to give access to the wharves.

===Foot ferry===
Foot ferries are small craft used to ferry foot passengers, and often also cyclists, over rivers. These are either self-propelled craft or cable ferries. Such ferries are for example to be found on the lower River Scheldt in Belgium and in particular the Netherlands. Regular foot ferry service also exists in the capital of the Czech Republic, Prague, and across the Yarra River in Melbourne, Australia at Newport. Restored, expanded ferry service in the Port of New York and New Jersey uses boats for pedestrians only.

The UK has a variety of historic foot ferries such as the Butley Foot Ferry across Butley Creek which dates back to 1383.
===Cable ferry===
Very short distances may be crossed by a cable or chain ferry, which is usually a pontoon ferry (see above), where the ferry is propelled along and steered by cables connected to each shore. Sometimes the cable ferry is human powered by someone on the boat. Reaction ferries are cable ferries that use the perpendicular force of the current as a source of power. Examples of a current propelled ferry are the four Rhine ferries in Basel, Switzerland. Cable ferries may be used in fast-flowing rivers across short distances. With an ocean crossing of approximately 1900 metres, the cable ferry between Vancouver Island and Denman Island in British Columbia; is the longest one in the world.

Free ferries operate in some parts of the world, such as at Woolwich in London, England (across the River Thames); in Amsterdam, Netherlands (across the IJ waterway); along the Murray River in South Australia, and across many lakes in British Columbia. Many cable ferries operate on lakes and rivers in Canada, among them a cable ferry that charges a toll operates on the Rivière des Prairies between Laval-sur-le-Lac and Île Bizard in Quebec, Canada. In Finland there were 40 road ferries (cable ferries) in 2009, on lakes, rivers and on sea between islands.

==Air ferries==

In the 1950s and 1960s, travel on an &quot;air ferry&quot; was possible—airplanes, often ex-military, specially equipped to take a small number of cars in addition to foot passengers. These operated various routes including between the United Kingdom and Continental Europe. Companies operating such services included Channel Air Bridge, Silver City Airways, and Corsair.

The term is also applied to any &quot;ferrying&quot; by air, and is commonly used when referring to airborne military operations.

==Docking==
Ferries often dock at specialized facilities designed to position the boat for loading and unloading, called a ferry slip. If the ferry transports road vehicles or railway carriages there will usually be an adjustable ramp called an apron that is part of the slip. In other cases, the apron ramp will be a part of the ferry itself, acting as a wave guard when elevated and lowered to meet a fixed ramp at the terminus – a road segment that extends partially underwater or meet the ferry slip.

==Records==
===Gross tonnage===
The world&#x27;s largest ferries are typically those operated in Europe, with different vessels holding the record depending on whether length, gross tonnage or car vehicle capacity is the metric.

===Oldest===
The sole contender as oldest ferry in continuous operation is the Mersey Ferry from Liverpool to Birkenhead, England. In 1150, the Benedictine Priory at Birkenhead was established. The monks used to charge a small fare to row passengers across the estuary. In 1330, Edward III granted a charter to the Priory and its successors for ever: &quot;the right of ferry there... for men, horses and goods, with leave to charge reasonable tolls&quot;. However, there may have been a short break following the Dissolution of the monasteries after 1536.

On 11 October 1811, inventor John Stevens&#x27; ship the &quot;Juliana&quot;, began operation as the first steam-powered ferry (service was between New York City, and Hoboken, New Jersey).

The Elwell Ferry, a cable ferry in North Carolina, travels a distance of , shore to shore, with a travel time of five minutes.

===Fastest===
The gas turbine powered &quot;Luciano Federico L&quot; operated by Montevideo-based Buquebus, holds the Guinness World Record for the fastest car ferry in the world, in service between Montevideo, Uruguay and Buenos Aires, Argentina: its maximum speed, achieved in sea trials, was . It can carry 450 passengers and 52 cars along the route.

== Sustainability ==

The contributions of ferry travel to climate change have received less scrutiny than land and air transport, and vary considerably according to factors like speed and the number of passengers carried. Average carbon dioxide emissions by ferries per passenger-kilometre seem to be . However, ferries between Finland and Sweden produce of CO2, with total emissions equalling a CO2 equivalent of , while ferries between Finland and Estonia produce of CO2 with total emissions equalling a CO2 equivalent of .

===Alternative fuels===

With the price of oil at high levels, and with increasing pressure from consumers for measures to tackle global warming, a number of innovations for energy and the environment were put forward at the Interferry conference in Stockholm. According to the company Solar Sailor, hybrid marine power and solar wing technology are suitable for use with ferries, private yachts and even tankers.

Alternative fuels are becoming more widespread on ferries. The fastest passenger ferry in the world Buquebus, runs on LNG, while Sweden&#x27;s Stena converted one of its ferries to run on both diesel and methanol in 2015. Both LNG and methanol reduce CO2 emissions considerably and replace costly diesel fuel.

Megawatt-class battery electric ferries operate in Scandinavia, with several more scheduled for operation. As of 2017, the world&#x27;s biggest purely electric ferry was the , which operates on the Helsingør–Helsingborg ferry route across the Øresund between Denmark and Sweden. The ferry weights 8414 tonnes, and has an electric storage capacity of more than 4 MWh.

Since 2015, Norwegian ferry company Norled has operated e-ferry on the Lavik-Opedal connection on the E39 north of Bergen. Further north on the Norwegian west coast, the connection between Anda and Lote will be the world&#x27;s first route served only by e-ferries. The first of two ships, MF &quot;Gloppefjord&quot;, was put into service in January 2018, followed by MF &quot;Eidsfjord&quot;. The owner, Fjord1, has commissioned a further seven battery-powered ferries to be in operation from 2020. A total of 60 battery powered car ferries are expected to be operational in Norway by 2021.
Since 15 August 2019, Ærø Municipality have operated between the southern Danish ports of Fynshav and Søby, on the island of Ærø. The e-ferry is capable of carrying 30 vehicles and 200 passengers and is powered by a battery &quot;with an unprecedented capacity&quot; of . The vessel can sail up to between charges – seven times further than previously possible for an e-ferry. It will now need to prove it can provide up to seven return trips per day. The European Union, which supported the project, aims to roll out 100 or more of these ferries by 2030.

A special feature is the Danish Udbyhøj cable ferry in Randers Fjord which has a land-based power supply by means of a retractable submarine cable.

<text>Jar Jar Binks is a fictional character from the &quot;Star Wars&quot; saga created by George Lucas. A member of the Gungan race, Jar Jar appears throughout the &quot;Star Wars&quot; prequel trilogy—as a major character in &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot; and with a supporting role in &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot; and &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot;—as well as having a role in the television series &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot;. The first fully computer-generated supporting character in a live-action film, he has been voiced by Ahmed Best in most of his appearances, who also acted out the character with prosthetics prior to the CGI work. He also appears in various other media.

Jar Jar&#x27;s primary role in &quot;Episode I&quot; was to provide comic relief for the audience. He was met with overwhelming dislike from both audiences and critics, and has been recognized as one of the most hated characters in &quot;Star Wars&quot; and the history of film in general, with some commentators arguing that the character was based on stereotypes of black people, especially Jamaicans. The hate affected Best personally, who rejected the idea that the character was based on racist stereotypes.

In 2010, Adult Swim released &quot;Robot Chicken: Star Wars Episode III&quot; which included a sketch where Binks, voiced by Ahmed Best himself, revealed that he was a Sith Lord throughout the six films, and had manipulated Palpatine himself. Five years later, in 2015, a Reddit user posted a fan theory that Jar Jar was originally going to be revealed as a manipulative villain, but this plot point was removed due to the character&#x27;s unpopularity. The theory gained popularity on the internet, and was even encouraged by Best, who implied that it could have been partially true.

The character&#x27;s reception has changed as he has been championed by fans who had seen the prequels at the time of their release as children. He has also been defended by members of the prequels&#x27; production team.

== Conception ==
George Lucas was inspired to develop Jar Jar based on the Disney character Goofy. Singer Michael Jackson wanted to play the role, but wished to portray the character using prosthetics while Lucas wanted him to be all CGI. Ahmed Best was cast based on his work in the production of &quot;Stomp&quot;, as Lucas wanted someone athletic for the role. During his audition he performed several martial arts moves and flips, which according to Best was a contrast to how Lucas pictured the character, more in line with comedic silent actors such as Buster Keaton. After Lucas walked out of the audition, Best felt he had failed it. Terryl Whitlatch created the final designs for the &quot;cowardly and insecure&quot; character.

Best wore a prosthetic costume to portray Jar Jar, which cost about $100,000 and served as a reference for the actors to interact with, animators to base the performance on, and digital artists to match the lighting. He was the first computer-generated supporting character in a live-action film, although in a small number of shots (such as those only showing the character&#x27;s hands or feet), the costume was not replaced with CGI.

==Appearances==

=== Films ===

Jar Jar appears in only the films of the prequel trilogy.

====&quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;====
Jar Jar Binks first appears in &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot; as a bumbling, foolish Gungan from the planet Naboo who is banished by his tribe as punishment for his clumsiness. He is nearly killed by a Trade Federation transport, only to be saved at the last minute by Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson). Qui-Gon and his padawan, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), persuade Jar Jar&#x27;s tribe to release him to their custody as a guide. He later goes with the Jedi and Padmé Amidala (Natalie Portman) to the planet Tatooine, where he meets and befriends nine-year-old slave Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd).

Jar Jar later appears in the film&#x27;s climactic battle scene, where he leads his fellow Gungans, as a general in the Gungan army, in defeating the Trade Federation. After the battle, he appears at the funeral of Qui-Gon Jinn and in the ending parade with his fellow Gungans.

====&quot;Attack of the Clones&quot;====
Jar Jar&#x27;s role in &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot; is much smaller, but his actions are significant. Ten years after helping save his planet, he is a delegate to the Galactic Senate and, as such, plays a role in bringing two of his old friends, Obi-Wan and Anakin (Hayden Christensen), back to Coruscant, where he greets them with enthusiasm. Later, on behalf of Naboo, he gives a speech to the assembled Senate in favor of granting Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) vast emergency powers.

====&quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;====
Jar Jar appears in only a few scenes in &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;, and he has no dialogue (besides a brief &quot;&#x27;scuse me&quot; at one point). He was originally given some dialogue in the beginning, but this was cut. Another cut scene would have shown Palpatine mocking Jar Jar for putting him in power before crowning himself emperor. He is most prominently featured in Padmé Amidala&#x27;s funeral procession at the end of the film, marching sadly behind her coffin alongside Boss Nass.

===&quot;The Clone Wars&quot; television series ===
Jar Jar Binks is a supporting character in the animated series &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot;, once again voiced by Best, although Phil LaMarr voiced the character in three season one episodes under the pseudonym BJ Hughes. In this series, he is a Senate representative who sometimes accompanies the main characters—Anakin, Obi-Wan, Padmé, and Anakin&#x27;s padawan Ahsoka Tano—on their adventures. He and Jedi Master Mace Windu are the two main characters of the two-part episode &quot;The Disappeared&quot; in which they had to search for missing elders and rescue a queen, who was Jar Jar&#x27;s past love interest.

===Literature===
====&quot;Aftermath: Empire&#x27;s End&quot;====
Chuck Wendig&#x27;s 2017 novel &quot;Star Wars: Aftermath: Empire&#x27;s End&quot;, set after the events of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, finds Binks as a street performer who entertains refugee children but is loathed by adults who blame him for his part in the rise of the Empire. Chris Taylor of Mashable wrote that the situation reflects real life in that adults disliked Jar Jar in the prequel films, but children were entertained by him.

In an interview, director J. J. Abrams suggested that Jar Jar&#x27;s death might be referenced in &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot;, but this did not happen.

====&quot;Legends&quot;====
With the 2012 acquisition of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company, most of the licensed &quot;Star Wars&quot; novels and comics produced since the originating 1977 film &quot;Star Wars&quot; were rebranded as &quot;Star Wars Legends&quot; and declared non-canon to the franchise in April 2014.

In the game &quot;Star Wars: The Force Unleashed&quot;, Jar Jar is shown to have been frozen in carbonite by an Imperial officer and kept in his trophy room.

===Video games===
Binks appears as a playable character in the &quot;Lego Star Wars&quot; video games, and appears as an Angry Bird with a hook move called &quot;Jar Jar Wings&quot; in &quot;Angry Birds Star Wars II&quot;.

=== Other appearances ===
Ahmed Best was signed on to portray Binks in the show &quot;Star Wars Detours&quot;.

==Reception==
Even before the release of &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;, Jar Jar Binks became the subject of significant media and popular attention. After the film&#x27;s release, Binks became symbolic of what many reviewers such as Brent Staples (&quot;The New York Times&quot;), David Edelstein (&quot;Slate&quot;), and Eric Harrison (&quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;) considered to be creative flaws of the film. The character was widely rejected and often ridiculed by people who felt that Jar Jar was included in the film solely to appeal to children (a criticism first leveled with the introduction of the Ewoks in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;). Bruce Handy of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; wrote that &quot;Jar Jar has come to symbolize what many fans see as the faults of the prequel trilogy: characters no one much cares about; a sense of humor geared toward the youngest conceivable audience members; an over-reliance on computer graphics; and story lines devoted to the kinds of convoluted political machinations which wouldn&#x27;t have been out of place in adaptations of &quot;I, Claudius&quot; or &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich&quot;, but which fit less snugly in films with characters like Jar Jar Binks.&quot; One fan, Mike J. Nichols, created and distributed, free of charge, a modified version of the film, entitled &quot;The Phantom Edit&quot;, which cut out several scenes featuring what Nichols dubbed &#x27;Jar Jar antics.&#x27; The character was also lampooned on an episode of the television show &quot;South Park&quot; entitled &quot;Jakovasaurs&quot;, in &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot; (Episode: &quot;Abra-Catastrophe!&quot;), &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (Episode: &quot;Co-Dependents&#x27; Day&quot;), as well as the parody &quot;Star Wars&quot; episodes of &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;, in which Best reprised the role in voice-over form.

In response to the criticism surrounding Jar Jar, &quot;Star Wars&quot; creator George Lucas stated that he feels there is a section of the fanbase upset that &quot;the movies are for children but they don&#x27;t want to admit that... There is a small group of fans that do not like comic sidekicks. They want the films to be tough like &quot;The Terminator&quot;, and they get very upset and opinionated about anything that has anything to do with being childlike.&quot;

In July 2018, Best said that the widespread criticism of his character had led to him considering suicide. Fans felt sorry for and showed their support for Best, feeling that toxic abuse is unacceptable. Among the group of people is the interpreter of Yoda, Frank Oz, who said that he enjoyed the character Jar Jar Binks and wrote on Twitter: “I LOVED Jar Jar Binks. I know I’ll get raked over the coals for saying that but I just will never understand the harshness of people’s dislike of him. I do character work. He is a GREAT character! Okay. Go ahead. Shoot. Gimme all ya got—but you’ll never make me change my mind.”

In April 2019, during the annual &quot;Star Wars&quot; Celebration event ahead of the 20th anniversary panel for &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;, George Lucas named Jar Jar as his favorite &quot;Star Wars&quot; character.

===Allegations of racial caricature===

In an article for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, film critic Joe Morgenstern described the character as a &quot;Rastafarian Stepin Fetchit on platform hoofs, crossed annoyingly with Butterfly McQueen.&quot; Legal scholar Patricia J. Williams argued that many aspects of Jar Jar Binks&#x27; characterization were reminiscent of the blackface archetypes in minstrel shows, while academic Paul J. Ford suggested the character is a &quot;laid-back clown character&quot; which utilized stereotypes of Afro-Caribbean people. Lucasfilm responded to these claims by denying that there were any racist intentions during the character&#x27;s creation. George Lucas has also responded, stating that &quot;those criticisms are made by people who&#x27;ve obviously never met a Jamaican...How in the world could you take an orange amphibian and say that he&#x27;s a Jamaican?&quot;. Ahmed Best also rejected such claims, stating that &quot;Jar Jar has nothing to do with the Caribbean&quot;.

===Speculations of villainy===
On December 19, 2010, Adult Swim released &quot;Robot Chicken: Star Wars Episode III&quot;, an animated comedy special parody of &quot;Star Wars&quot;. In the first sketch, titled &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s Back&quot;, Emperor Palpatine feels remorse for his actions and calls Binks, voiced by Ahmed Best himself, on the telephone, apologizing to him for manipulating him into granting Palpatine emergency powers in the senate during &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot;. Binks pretends to accept this apology, feigning innocence, but after he hangs up he reveals that he was in fact a Sith Lord, named Darth Jar Jar, who only pretended to be manipulated by Palpatine and actually manipulated Palpatine himself. This sketch was in reference to a popular in-joke among &quot;Star Wars&quot; fans. Five years later, in late October 2015, a Reddit user by the name of &quot;Lumpawarroo&quot; (the name of Chewbacca&#x27;s son) published a detailed theory speculating that Binks was originally written as a major antagonist of the series, a manipulative, prominent collaborator of Palpatine, before being written off from his major villain&#x27;s role due to the character&#x27;s negative reception. This theory was related to an earlier interview with actor Ahmed Best in /r/IAmA, where he claimed that Jar Jar had been displaced from the story&#x27;s main focus due to the backlash, implying at the same time that the hate received by the character was not entirely unintentional.

The post quickly became popular and received significant media coverage internationally by independent bloggers and major news outlets like &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which included analysis of his actions in &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; and gave him the nickname of &quot;Darth Jar Jar&quot;. Journalist Andrew Street from &quot;The Guardian&quot; called it a &quot;classic twist&quot;, comparing it to Yoda&#x27;s role in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, while Matt Hickey from &quot;Forbes&quot; went to the extent of contacting George Lucas about the question, but received no answer.

In response to the speculations, Best tweeted, &quot;I will say this, it feels really good when the hidden meaning behind the work is seen. No matter how long it takes,&quot; apparently confirming the theory. Some months later, he expanded upon his tweet in a YouTube interview, stating, &quot;there is a lot about [the theory] that is true, there are some things about it that are not true... Could Jar Jar have evolved into that? I think the answer is yes. Because of the backlash, and rightfully so, Lucasfilm backed off of Jar Jar a lot, but a lot of the influence that I put into the character mirrored a lot of what was already in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe.&quot; Best concluded only Lucas could unveil the actual role of Binks, yet he also claimed that a deleted scene from &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot; would have still shown Palpatine darkly confiding his plans about the Empire to Jar Jar.

J. J. Abrams, who directed two installments of the franchise&#x27;s sequel trilogy after its buyout by Disney, personally approved of the theory about the villainous Jar Jar. He described Lumpawarroo&#x27;s argumentation as an &quot;unbelievably lengthy analysis, in a very seriously thought-out way, as to why it&#x27;s obviously true he&#x27;s [evil].&quot;

In 2019, when questioned about it, Best stated again only Lucas could answer, but he confirmed the theorists&#x27; idea of Jar Jar&#x27;s antics being actually a disguised fighting style akin to drunken boxing, revealing that he based his performance on Jackie Chan&#x27;s role in the 1978 film &quot;Drunken Master&quot;. He said, &quot;the Darth Jar Jar theory caught it - caught it. I never thought anybody would see that&quot;.

The Darth Jar Jar theory is referenced in the animated miniseries &quot;Lego Star Wars: Rebuild the Galaxy&quot;, in which a Jedi relic accidentally rewrites reality and turns Jar Jar (reprised by Best) into a Sith Lord.

===Character reassessment===
Since the release of the movie &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;, many people who have worked on the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films and viewers have defended Jar Jar Binks.

Filmmaker and creator George Lucas defended the character Jar Jar Binks by clarifying that the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films were made for 12-year-old children. He has said from the beginning in early interviews for &quot;A New Hope&quot; that the series was intended for children.

In an interview with IGN during the premiere of &quot;The Force Awakens&quot;, Yoda&#x27;s performer Frank Oz stated that Jar Jar Binks is his favorite character: &quot;I love Jar Jar Binks. I swear to god I do... When I saw that script I thought he was a fantastic character and I don&#x27;t know what the heck happened… I thought he was fantastic; he was hysterical. He reminded me of Abbott and Costello.&quot;

Actor Liam Neeson praised Ahmed Best for his portrayal of Jar Jar Binks: &quot;I know a lot of fans and critics didn&#x27;t like it. Ahmed Best, who played Jar Jar Binks, received a lot of criticism, to the point where it really hurt his career. And I have to say that when he was making that movie, with Ahmed Best as Jar Jar Binks and with Ewan McGregor as young Obi-Wan Kenobi, he was probably one of the funniest and most talented guys I&#x27;ve ever worked with. I remember calling... my old ex-agent... and saying, &#x27;Listen, I think I just worked with the new Eddie Murphy.&#x27; And I still believe it.&quot;

During the 20th anniversary of &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; film, many members of the prequel production team have defended the character and appreciated the public&#x27;s acceptance at the Star Wars Celebration panel. Visual effects supervisor John Knoll reflected: &quot;Well, I think it&#x27;s good to see [his newfound popularity], because I think George took a lot of the criticism pretty harshly. It was kind of painful for me to see how cruel people were about it and how personally George took it. I think the movies didn&#x27;t deserve as much hate as they received. It hurt me to see how much George took those things.&quot; He also said, &quot;I thought [the Star Wars Celebration panel] was great, especially the warm reaction there was to Ahmed. I know he took all the vicious comments people had about Jar Jar very hard. That&#x27;s not his fault, he didn&#x27;t write that character. He&#x27;s an actor who did a really good job and worked hard to get it right. Seeing the really warm reaction of the crowd made me feel... It was moving.&quot;.
Animation director Rob Coleman said that twenty years later he still has younger people coming up to him and telling him that Jar Jar is their favorite character.
Digital model designer Jean Bolte cited Jar Jar Binks as one of her favorite characters to work with alongside Sebulba and Yoda, saying, &quot;Going to Star Wars Celebration and seeing and hearing the fans so interested in which one was our contribution… It really completely changed my point of view about being privileged to have had anything to do with these films.&quot;.

In an interview with Europa Press during the premiere of &quot;Rogue One: A Star Wars Story&quot;, a journalist asked actress Felicity Jones who she would like to receive a gift from if she were in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; galaxy at Christmas time and she responded: &quot;I think she would be very interested to receive a gift from Jar Jar Binks or C-3P0.&quot;

Ahmed Best was moved by people&#x27;s appreciation for Jar Jar Binks: &quot;It was definitely the kids. I had to start looking at Jar Jar through their eyes, and that&#x27;s what made me smile again. Now those kids, they are between 20 and 30 years old. They have a different perspective on &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;. &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;, for them, is their &quot;Star Wars&quot;. &quot;[Episodes] IV&quot;, &quot;V&quot; and &quot;VI&quot;, that&#x27;s their parents&#x27; &quot;Star Wars&quot;, and &quot;VII&quot;, &quot;VIII&quot; and &quot;IX&quot;, that&#x27;s their children&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars&quot;. But the prequels, that&#x27;s theirs, and they defend the prequels. So I see the same thing. I see the resurgence of &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;.&quot; He then talked about his experience of going to Star Wars Celebration: &quot;To be very honest, I was very afraid to go to Celebration. Every time I&#x27;m in a &quot;Star Wars&quot; setting, I spend most of my time defending our work and defending Jar Jar. And I just don&#x27;t want to do that anymore. So I was very reluctant to come to Celebration because of that, and I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised. It wasn&#x27;t the case at all. I just felt nothing but love and respect and admiration for the work we did. I couldn&#x27;t have been more proud and I couldn&#x27;t have been happier. I wish George was there because I think we&#x27;re at a time right now where we have to stand in that work. We have to say, “We did it,” and step into that in a very proud way, because it stands the test of time.&quot;

<doc id="50781" wikidata="Q52310" url="?curid=50781" title="Wedge Antilles">
<text>Wedge Antilles is a fictional character in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise. He is a supporting character portrayed by Denis Lawson in the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy, and voiced by David Ankrum in &quot;Episode IV – A New Hope&quot; (1977) and &quot;Rogue One&quot; (2016). He is also featured in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; expanded universe, most notably as the lead character in most of the &quot;X-Wing&quot; novels. Antilles has also appeared in the sequel trilogy film &quot;The Rise of Skywalker&quot; (2019), with Lawson reprising his role; in the 2014 animated series &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot;, voiced by Nathan Kress; and in the 2023 second volume of &quot;Star Wars: Visions&quot;, voiced again by Lawson.

Before defecting to the Rebel Alliance, Antilles was an Imperial cadet (callsign: TIE SS25) of the Skystrike Academy. Antilles founded Rogue Squadron with his friend Luke Skywalker. His superior piloting skills, in-depth knowledge of Imperial military doctrine, and tactical leadership quickly propelled him through the ranks to become Marshal of the Alliance Starfighter Corps. Antilles is notable for having participated in more starfighter battles ending with decisive Alliance victories than any other character: he led the allied assault during the Battle of Exegol and Jakku; supported Project Starhawk; piloted a snowspeeder in the defense of Echo Base on Hoth; and is the only Rebel starfighter pilot to have survived both attack runs on the Death Stars at the battles of Yavin and Endor.

== Depiction ==
Wedge Antilles was first seen in the 1977 film &quot;A New Hope&quot; in the Rebels&#x27; Death Star attack briefing. In this scene he was portrayed by Colin Higgins and voiced by David Ankrum, who dubbed the character throughout the film. For the remaining scenes filmed in the X-wing cockpit, the character was played by Denis Lawson. Higgins was originally cast in the role of Antilles but reportedly had difficulty remembering his lines, and was consequently replaced by Lawson for subsequent scenes, but Higgins&#x27; scene remained in the final cut of the film. The discrepancy became a popular subject in &quot;Star Wars&quot; fandom, and Higgins acquired the nickname &quot;Fake Wedge&quot;.

Lawson reprised the role of Antilles in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; and &quot;The Rise of Skywalker&quot;. Lawson used his own voice in these films, masking his natural Scottish accent with an imitation of an American accent. Ankrum was also the voice of Antilles in &quot;Rogue One.&quot; Coincidentally, Denis Lawson is the maternal uncle of Ewan McGregor, who made his first appearance in the role of Obi-Wan Kenobi in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; prequel trilogy.

== Appearances ==

=== Films ===
Wedge Antilles appears towards the end of &quot;Star Wars&quot; as &quot;Red Two&quot;, an X-wing pilot and a member of Red Squadron. His considerable dogfighting prowess is shown during the Battle of Yavin when he saves Luke Skywalker from being shot down by a TIE fighter pilot that he could not shake off, picking off the hostile with a point blank, high deflection angle shot. Along with Skywalker and Biggs Darklighter, Antilles is one of only three X-wing pilots to survive until the final attack runs along the Death Star&#x27;s trench. However, his X-wing is damaged, and he is forced to disengage before the Death Star is destroyed. He and Luke are the only two X-wing pilots to survive the battle, along with a Y-wing and the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot;.

Antilles appears in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; as a member of the newly formed Rogue Squadron. He flies a snowspeeder under the callsign &quot;Rogue Three&quot; against the Empire&#x27;s AT-AT ground assault with Wes Janson as his harpoon gunner. Their snowspeeder inflicts the first casualty against the AT-AT attack group by firing a harpoon trailing a tow cable into one of the walker&#x27;s legs and circling the walker several times, causing it to trip and fall and allowing Rebel forces to destroy the walker. After the battle, Antilles is seen and heard wishing Luke a safe trip.

Antilles appears towards the end of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; as the leader of Red Squadron in the Battle of Endor. Along with Lando Calrissian, who pilots the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot; with Nien Nunb, he leads the fighter attack on the second Death Star. His dogfighting prowess is shown again in this battle, as Antilles personally shoots down a number of Imperial TIE fighters, and appears to easily navigate the narrow and treacherous flight spaces inside the Death Star that lead to its core. When he and Calrissian reach the Death Star&#x27;s core, Antilles destroys the power regulator on the core&#x27;s north tower, while Calrissian destroys the core itself. He later appears at the victory celebration at the Ewok village on Endor, apparently the only surviving member of his fleet.

Antilles appears, once again played by Denis Lawson, in the final installment of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; sequel trilogy, &quot;The Rise of Skywalker&quot;. He is seen manning a gun turret on the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot; during the battle between the Resistance and the Sith Eternal, shortly after the death of his stepson Snap. Lawson had previously been asked to appear as Wedge Antilles in &quot;The Force Awakens&quot;, in the narrative role the character Poe Dameron was ultimately created for, but declined due to scheduling conflicts.

Antilles is not seen on screen in the spinoff film &quot;Rogue One&quot;, but his voice is briefly heard over the intercom in the Rebel base on Yavin 4. He was intentionally omitted from the film&#x27;s climactic battle in order to avoid a continuity error with the first &quot;Star Wars&quot; film, which takes place immediately after &quot;Rogue One&quot;. In that film, he utters the phrase &quot;Look at the size of that thing!&quot; which would have made less sense if he had already seen the Death Star at Scarif.

=== Television ===
In the television series &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot;, Wedge Antilles is voiced by Nathan Kress. He first appeared in the episode &quot;The Antilles Extraction&quot;, the fourth episode of the third season. The episode establishes Antilles&#x27;s canon backstory as an Imperial TIE fighter pilot who with the help of Sabine Wren defected from the Empire, and joined the Rebel Alliance. Antilles later appeared in the episode &quot;Double Agent Droid,&quot; the nineteenth episode of the third season, and again in both parts of the third-season finale &quot;Zero Hour&quot;, the twenty-first and twenty-second episodes, respectively. Antilles&#x27; last appearance in &quot;Rebels&quot; was in the first part of &quot;In the Name of the Rebellion&quot;, the third episode of the fourth season.

=== Novels ===
Wedge Antilles is featured in the &quot;Star Wars: Aftermath&quot; trilogy by Chuck Wendig, consisting of the novels &quot;Aftermath&quot; (2015), &quot;Life Debt&quot; (2016), and &quot;Empire&#x27;s End&quot; (2017). In this series, Antilles establishes a new unit called Phantom Squadron, which sees action on the planets Kashyyyk and Jakku. Following the Battle of Jakku, which ends the Galactic Civil War, Antilles relocates to Hosnian Prime, where he serves as a flight instructor.

Antilles makes a brief appearance in Claudia Gray&#x27;s 2015 novel &quot;Star Wars: Lost Stars&quot;, in which he recruits Thane Kyrell, one of the novel&#x27;s protagonists, into the Rebel Alliance.

Antilles later moves to the planet Akiva where he retires with Norra Wexley. The two appear in the 2019 novel &quot;Star Wars: Resistance Reborn&quot; where they join a Resistance mission to save some political prisoners on Corellia. He is the stepfather of Resistance fighter pilot Snap Wexley, played in the sequel trilogy by Greg Grunberg.

===&quot;Legends&quot;===
In April 2014, most of the licensed &quot;Star Wars&quot; novels and comics produced since the originating 1977 film &quot;Star Wars&quot; were rebranded by Lucasfilm as &quot;Star Wars Legends&quot; and declared non-canon to the franchise.

Wedge Antilles appears in the 1983 Marvel &quot;Star Wars&quot; comic &quot;Hoth Stuff!&quot;, in which it is revealed that he went missing during the Battle of Hoth. Aboard his ship, Luke and Leia listen to his log tape recounting how he survived the Imperial invasion by hiding with Janson in the AT-AT Luke took down. They were later prevented from contacting the Rebellion by orbiting TIE fighters and had to face wampas and other dangers. Janson was eventually killed by scavengers; Antilles then stole one of their ships to escape the planet and contact the Rebellion. He suddenly appears outside one of the windows, after working on the ship from space. Leia also states that he and Luke grew up together on Tatooine, which Antilles seems to confirm in his log by mentioning a girlfriend he had there.

&quot;Star Wars Legends&quot; literature explains that Antilles&#x27; parents were killed when their starship-refueling depot exploded. He piloted a freighter before joining the Rebel Alliance as a starfighter pilot.

Antilles is the lead character in most of the &quot;Star Wars: X-Wing&quot; novels by Michael A. Stackpole and Aaron Allston, set in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; expanded universe. Several Dark Horse Comics series focus on Antilles and Rogue Squadron, and the character also appears in other expanded universe works including &quot;The New Jedi Order&quot; and &quot;Legacy of the Force&quot; novels. Antilles is one of two main player characters in the &quot;Rogue Squadron&quot; video game series (Luke Skywalker is the other), and Antilles appears as a minor character in &quot;Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy&quot;, helping the player during one mission. He is also a playable character in &quot;Lego Star Wars III: The Clone Wars&quot;.

==In popular culture==
* &quot;IGN&quot; named Antilles the 24th greatest &quot;Star Wars&quot; character of all time, claiming &quot;Wedge Antilles may be the most important ancillary character in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe&quot;.
*Antilles was portrayed by three voice actors in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; radio series from National Public Radio: Meshach Taylor in &quot;A New Hope&quot;, Don Scardino in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, and Jon Matthews in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;.

In &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983), she helps to rescue Han from the crime lord Jabba the Hutt, and is revealed to be Vader&#x27;s daughter and the twin sister of Luke Skywalker. Leia is portrayed by Carrie Fisher in the original film trilogy and the sequel trilogy.

The 2005 prequel film &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; reveals that Leia&#x27;s mother is Senator Padmé Amidala of Naboo, who dies after childbirth. Her father is Anakin Skywalker, a Jedi who falls to the dark side of the Force and becomes Darth Vader. After her mother&#x27;s death, Leia is adopted by Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan and his wife, Queen Breha. In the sequel trilogy, Leia is a founder and General of the Resistance, which fights against the First Order. She and Han have a son named Ben Solo, who turned to the dark side and became the First Order warlord Kylo Ren. In &quot;The Rise of Skywalker&quot; (2019), it is revealed that Leia was trained as a Jedi by Luke sometime after the events of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. Leia is now the mentor of Rey, the last remaining Jedi. Leia dies towards the end of the film but returns as a Force spirit alongside Luke.

One of the more popular &quot;Star Wars&quot; characters, Leia has been called a 1980s icon, a feminist hero and model for other adventure heroines. She has appeared in many derivative works and merchandising, including the now-noncanonical &quot;Star Wars&quot; Expanded Universe, and has been referenced or parodied in several TV shows and films. Her &quot;cinnamon bun&quot; hairstyle from &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977) and metal bikini from &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; have become cultural icons. Fisher was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Actress for &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. She also received Saturn Award nominations for Best Supporting Actress for &quot;The Force Awakens&quot; and &quot;The Last Jedi&quot;, the latter being a posthumous nomination.

==Creation and casting==
Leia was created by &quot;Star Wars&quot; creator George Lucas, who in 1999 explained his early development of the main characters:
The character Princess Leia went through various changes as George Lucas wrote and refined the &quot;Star Wars&quot; screenplay. In one early draft, she is the spoiled teenage daughter of King Kayos and Queen Breha of Aquilae. In a later version, she is Luke&#x27;s cousin and the daughter of Owen Lars and his wife Beru. A subsequent story synopsis establishes her as Leia Antilles, the child of Bail Antilles from the peaceful world of Organa Major. In the fourth draft, she is Leia Organa of Alderaan, which is how she appears in the finished film.

Carrie Fisher was 19 when she was cast as Princess Leia. She was cast over Karen Allen, Glenn Close, Farrah Fawcett, Anjelica Huston, Amy Irving, Jessica Lange, Terri Nunn, Linda Purl, Meryl Streep and Cindy Williams. Jodie Foster was offered the role, but turned it down because she was under contract with Disney.

In his early story development for &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, Lucas intended for Luke to have a twin sister—not Leia—who would be the focus of another episode. Following the production of &quot;Empire&quot;, Lucas was burnt out and decided not to make his planned sequel trilogy. Needing to explain the identity of the other potential Jedi mentioned by Yoda, Lucas decided that Leia would be revealed as Luke&#x27;s twin.

In the second draft of the &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; screenplay, Obi-Wan tells Luke he has a twin sister. She and their mother were &quot;sent to the protection of friends in a distant system. The mother died shortly thereafter, and Luke&#x27;s sister was adopted by Ben&#x27;s friends, the governor of Alderaan and his wife.&quot; Fisher explained in 1983: &quot;Leia&#x27;s real father left her mother when she was pregnant, so her mother married this King Organa. I was adopted and grew up set apart from other people because I was a princess.&quot;

==Characterization==
Anthony Breznican of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; described Leia as a diplomat, spy, warrior, and undercover agent. Fisher told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1983:

She said in 2014:
==Appearances==
=== Original trilogy ===
==== &quot;Star Wars&quot; ====
Introduced in &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977), Princess Leia of Alderaan is a member of the Imperial Senate and a leader in the Rebel Alliance. She is captured when Darth Vader boards her ship, demanding that she reveal the location of stolen architectural plans for the Death Star, the Galactic Empire&#x27;s battle station. Before her interrogation, Leia hid the plans inside the droid R2-D2, and sent him to find one of the last remaining Jedi, Obi-Wan Kenobi. Vader takes Leia to the Death Star and tortures her, but she offers him no information. The Death Star commander Grand Moff Tarkin threatens to destroy Alderaan unless she reveals the location of the Rebel base. She provides the location of an abandoned headquarters on Dantooine, but Tarkin obliterates Alderaan anyway. Leia is rescued by Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Chewbacca. They escape aboard Han&#x27;s ship, the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot;. After analyzing the Death Star schematics, the Rebels find a small weakness in the battle station, which allows Luke to destroy it with torpedoes launched from his X-wing. After the victory, Leia honors Luke, Han and Chewbacca for their heroism.In 2015, Alyssa Rosenberg of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; praised Leia&#x27;s courage and resiliency while experiencing imprisonment, torture, and the destruction of her home planet. Rosenberg also notes that while Han is almost immediately attracted to Leia, they end up in conflict because she insists on asserting command and he automatically resists, even as she proves herself to be worthy of it.

Fisher told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1980 that in the original script, when Luke and Han arrive to rescue Leia, she is unconscious, her eyes are yellow and she is hanging upside down, imagery which alludes to the 1973 horror film &quot;The Exorcist&quot;. Fisher explained that the scene was changed because Chewbacca would have had to carry Leia for an extended period of time.

==== &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; ====
In &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980), Leia is commanding the Rebel base on Hoth. As Han prepares to leave the base to pay off Jabba, he tries to make Leia admit that she has romantic feelings for him. When Imperial forces arrive and assault the base, Leia leads an evacuation. She then flees with Han, Chewbacca and C-3PO in the &quot;Falcon&quot;. While hiding in an asteroid field, Leia and Han share a kiss. With the ship needing repairs, Han seeks out his old friend Lando Calrissian in Cloud City. Lando welcomes the group graciously, but has betrayed them to the Empire. He turns them over to Vader, who hopes to use them as bait to capture Luke. Leia confesses her love for Han as he is frozen in carbonite and handed over to the bounty hunter Boba Fett. As Lando, Leia, and Chewbacca escape from Cloud City, Leia senses that Luke is in trouble, and she orders Chewbacca to turn the ship around and rescue him. He was wounded during a lightsaber duel with Vader, and used the Force to contact Leia.

Commenting on Han&#x27;s attempt to pry a confession of affection out Leia, Rosenberg asserts that &quot;Han&#x27;s not wrong that if Leia doesn&#x27;t figure out that she&#x27;s a person with needs, she&#x27;s going to burn out ... In a way, it&#x27;s an early confession of love: Han&#x27;s anxious about the bounty hunters who are still pursuing him ... But he would stay and give his love and support to Leia if she could just acknowledge that she needs him.&quot;

==== &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; ====
In &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983), Leia infiltrates Jabba the Hutt&#x27;s palace on Tatooine disguised as the Ubese bounty hunter Boushh. She frees Han from the carbonite, but they are both recaptured by Jabba, who chains Leia and outfits her in a metal bikini. After Luke arrives and kills Jabba&#x27;s rancor, the crime lord sentences Luke, Han and Chewbacca to be fed to a Sarlacc, a deadly ground-dwelling beast. The group overpowers their captors, and Leia strangles Jabba to death with her chain. The companions then escape the planet and return to the Rebel base. Later, they travel to the forest moon of Endor to disable a shield protecting the second Death Star. There, Luke reveals to Leia that he is her twin brother and that Vader is their father. After joining forces with a tribe of Ewoks, the Rebels manage to destroy the Death Star and defeat the Empire.

Following the release of &quot;Return of the Jedi,&quot; Fisher commented on the way Leia is depicted: &quot;[She] gets to be more feminine, more supportive, more affectionate. But let&#x27;s not forget that these movies are basically boys&#x27; fantasies. So the other way they made her more female in this one was to have her take off her clothes.&quot;

=== &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; ===
In the prequel film &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; (2005), Anakin Skywalker&#x27;s wife Padmé Amidala is pregnant with twins near the end of the Clone Wars. After Anakin turns to the dark side of the Force and becomes Darth Vader, Padmé gives birth to Luke and Leia on Polis Massa and then dies. Leia is adopted by Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan and his wife, Queen Breha.

=== Sequel trilogy ===
==== &quot;The Force Awakens&quot; ====

Leia returns in &quot;The Force Awakens&quot; (2015), which takes place thirty years after the events of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. She is the leader of the Resistance, an organization she formed to fight the First Order. She is also trying to find her brother Luke, who disappeared years earlier. After a battle on the planet Takodana, she reunites with Han. They discuss their son, Ben Solo, who left Jedi training and fell to the dark side of the Force, becoming the First Order warlord Kylo Ren. Leia believes Ren can be brought back from the dark side, and urges Han to bring him home. When Han encounters Ren on Starkiller Base, he asks him to abandon the First Order. Ren refuses and instead kills his father. Leia senses Han&#x27;s death through the Force, and later shares a moment of grief with the scavenger Rey, who viewed Han as a father figure.

Although Leia appears as a Jedi in various &quot;Star Wars&quot; &quot;Legends&quot; works, she is not depicted that way in &quot;The Force Awakens&quot;. The film&#x27;s director, J.J. Abrams, explained that Leia&#x27;s decision to lead the Resistance instead of training as a Jedi was &quot;simply a choice that she made&quot;. Nevertheless, he affirmed that Leia&#x27;s strength with the Force is an intrinsic part of her character. Asked to describe Leia in the film, Fisher said she is under &quot;a lot of pressure&quot; and is likely feeling &quot;somewhat defeated, tired, and pissed.&quot; Fisher was nominated for a 2016 Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance.

====&quot;The Last Jedi&quot;====
Fisher returns as Leia in &quot;The Last Jedi&quot;, the 2017 sequel to &quot;The Force Awakens.&quot; When Leia&#x27;s ship is attacked by the First Order, she is expelled into space, but uses the Force to pull herself back onboard. After recovering, she shoots and stuns the Resistance pilot Poe Dameron, who mutinied against Vice Admiral Holdo. From his self-imposed exile on Ahch-To, Luke uses the Force to project himself to the Resistance stronghold on Crait. He reunites with Leia and apologizes for Ben&#x27;s fall to the dark side. Leia says that her son is gone, but Luke assures her that nobody is ever truly gone. While Luke distracts Ren and his troops, Leia and the remaining Resistance forces escape in the &quot;Falcon&quot;. The filming of Fisher&#x27;s scenes was completed shortly before her death on December 27, 2016.

==== &quot;The Rise of Skywalker&quot; ====
Following Fisher&#x27;s death, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that she was slated to appear in &quot;The Rise of Skywalker&quot; (2019). However, Lucasfilm stated that it was not planning to create a digital version of Fisher for the film. Several months later, Fisher&#x27;s family granted Lucasfilm the right to use previously-filmed footage of her in the film; it was later announced that Fisher would appear using unseen footage from &quot;The Force Awakens&quot;. Fisher&#x27;s daughter Billie Lourd, who portrays Lieutenant Connix in all three sequel trilogy films, stepped in as Leia for a brief flashback scene. Her face was digitally replaced by Fisher&#x27;s, using imagery from &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;.

In the film, Leia continues to lead the Resistance while guiding Rey in her Jedi training; a flashback presented later reveals that Leia abandoned her own Jedi instruction with Luke after seeing a vision of her son&#x27;s death. While Rey and Ren duel on Kef Bir, Leia uses all of her remaining strength to reach out to Ren through the Force. Rey impales him while he is distracted, then heals his wound as Leia dies. During the climactic battle on Exegol, a transformed Ben Solo utilizes the remainder of his life force to revive a comatose Rey, then vanishes into the Force at the same time as his mother. Rey travels to the Lars homestead on Tatooine and buries the lightsabers that had belonged to Leia and Luke. As the Force spirits of her two mentors look on, Rey tells a passerby that her name is &quot;Rey Skywalker.&quot;

=== &quot;Rogue One&quot; ===
Leia makes a brief appearance in the final scene of the 2016 film &quot;Rogue One&quot;. She receives the stolen plans for the Death Star as a lead-up to the beginning of &quot;Star Wars&quot;. Since &quot;Rogue One&quot; takes place just prior to the original trilogy, a young Leia was required. To create this effect, a computer-generated image of a young Carrie Fisher was superimposed over the face of the actress Ingvild Deila. Archival audio of Fisher was used to voice the character.

=== Series ===
A teenage Princess Leia, voiced by Julie Dolan, appears in a 2016 episode of the animated series &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot;, which is set between &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot;. In the episode, Leia is sent on a secret mission for the Rebel Alliance. Dave Filoni, the executive producer of &quot;Rebels&quot;, said the intention was to show Leia developing her leadership abilities. He added that in the series, Leia is &quot;part of the Empire. She doesn&#x27;t believe in the Empire, but she is acting the part, almost a double agent.&quot; Leia also appears in the web series &quot;Forces of Destiny&quot; (2017–2018) voiced by Shelby Young, and in &quot;Star Wars Resistance&quot;, voiced by Rachel Butera and Carolyn Hennesy.

Leia appears as a ten-year-old child in the 2022 live-action series &quot;Obi-Wan Kenobi&quot;, portrayed by Vivien Lyra Blair. Of Blair&#x27;s casting, series writer Joby Harold said the show wanted an actor who would embody a young Carrie Fisher, and Eric Deggans of NPR later wrote that Blair &quot;practically channels Carrie Fisher&#x27;s subversive, wisecracking spirit&quot;.

===Novels===
Leia makes her first literary appearance in &quot;Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker&quot;, the novelization of the original 1977 film &quot;Star Wars&quot;, which was released six months before the film in November 1976. Credited to Lucas but ghostwritten by Alan Dean Foster, the novel was based on Lucas&#x27; screenplay. Leia later appeared in the novelizations &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980) by Donald F. Glut and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983) by James Kahn. She is also a point-of-view character in the 2015 novelization of &quot;The Force Awakens&quot; by Foster.

Foster&#x27;s 1978 novel &quot;Splinter of the Mind&#x27;s Eye&quot; was commissioned by Lucas as the basis for a potential low-budget sequel to &quot;Star Wars&quot; should the film prove unsuccessful. In the story, Luke and Leia seek a crystal on a swampy planet and eventually face Vader in combat.

Leia appears in the Journey to &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot; line of novels and comics, which were introduced to connect &quot;The Force Awakens&quot; with previous films. She is featured in the young adult novel &quot;Moving Target: A Princess Leia Adventure&quot; (2015) by Cecil Castellucci and Jason Fry, which is set between &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, and Claudia Gray&#x27;s novels &quot;Star Wars: Bloodline&quot; (2016) and &quot;&quot; (2017). The former is set six years before &quot;The Force Awakens&quot;, while the latter features a 16-year-old Leia before the events of &quot;A New Hope&quot;. She also leads in Beth Revis&#x27; &quot;Star Wars: The Princess and the Scoundrel&quot; which is set immediately right after &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;.

===Comics===
Leia appears in the limited series &quot;Star Wars: Princess Leia&quot; (2015), which takes place immediately after &quot;Star Wars&quot;. She is also featured in the four-part series &quot;Star Wars: Shattered Empire&quot; (2015), set immediately after &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. &quot;Princess Leia&quot; depicts Leia training in martial arts on Alderaan and explores her reaction to the destruction of the planet, while &quot;Shattered Empire&quot; portrays her as a skilled pilot who undertakes a dangerous mission alongside Poe Dameron&#x27;s mother. Leia also appears in &quot;Star Wars&quot; #12.

===Other===
Leia appears briefly in the 1978 television film &quot;The Star Wars Holiday Special&quot; as a leader and administrator of the new Rebel Alliance base. She and C-3PO contact Chewbacca&#x27;s wife Mallatobuck for assistance in finding Chewbacca and Han. Leia also appears in the animated segment at a different base in an asteroid field, and at the Life Day ceremony at the end of the film. Fisher also appeared in and hosted the November 18, 1978, episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; that aired one day after the special.

== &quot;Star Wars Legends&quot; ==

Following the acquisition of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company in 2012, most of the licensed &quot;Star Wars&quot; Expanded Universe material produced between 1977 and 2014 was rebranded as &quot;Star Wars Legends&quot; and declared non-canon to the franchise. In the &quot;Legends&quot; narrative universe, Leia battles remnants of the Empire after the events of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. She becomes the chief of state of the New Republic and a Jedi Master, and raises three children with Han: Jaina, Jacen and Anakin Solo.

=== Novels ===
The 1991 &quot;New York Times&quot; bestselling novel &quot;Heir to the Empire&quot; by Timothy Zahn began what would become a large collection of works set before, between and especially after the original films.

==== Post-&quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; ====
The bestselling &quot;Thrawn&quot; trilogy (1991–93) by Timothy Zahn begins five years after the events of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. In &quot;Heir to the Empire&quot; (1991), Leia is married to Han and three months pregnant with twins. Noghri commandos repeatedly attempt to kidnap her as part of Grand Admiral Thrawn&#x27;s plan to restore the Empire and crush the New Republic. In &quot;Dark Force Rising&quot; (1992), Leia realizes that Darth Vader and the Empire deceived the Noghri to secure their allegiance, and by revealing the truth she turns the alien race to the side of the New Republic. At one point, she remembers her adoptive parents on Alderaan, implying that the &quot;mother&quot; she discussed with Luke on Endor was Queen Breha. In &quot;The Last Command&quot; (1993), Leia gives birth to the twins Jaina and Jacen Solo on Coruscant during Thrawn&#x27;s siege.

Leia, now the Chief of State of the New Republic, is a minor character in the &quot;Jedi Academy&quot; trilogy (1994) by Kevin J. Anderson, set after the &quot;Thrawn&quot; trilogy. Next in the timeline is the &quot;Callista&quot; trilogy: &quot;Children of the Jedi&quot; (1995) by Barbara Hambly, &quot;Darksaber&quot; (1995) by Anderson and &quot;Planet of Twilight&quot; (1997) by Hambly. In &quot;The Crystal Star&quot; (1994) by Vonda McIntyre, young Jacen, Jaina and their three-year-old brother Anakin are kidnapped in a plot to restore the Empire, but are rescued by Leia and Chewbacca. Leia struggles with the responsibilities of her position in &quot;The Black Fleet Crisis&quot; trilogy (1996) by Michael P. Kube-McDowell. In &quot;The New Rebellion&quot; (1996) by Kristine Kathryn Rusch, she avoids an assassination attempt and then aids in the defeat of the Dark Jedi Kueller, whom she shoots to death. The &quot;Corellian&quot; trilogy (1995) by Roger MacBride Allen finds Han and Leia swept up in a civil war while visiting his homeworld of Corellia with their children. In the two &quot;Hand of Thrawn&quot; novels by Timothy Zahn (1997&#x27;s &quot;Specter of the Past&quot; and 1998&#x27;s &quot;Vision of the Future&quot;), Leia tries to hold the New Republic together as Moff Disra conspires for its volatile factions to destroy each other. Leia appears periodically in the &quot;Young Jedi Knights&quot; series (1995–98) by Kevin J. Anderson and Rebecca Moesta. The 14-volume young adult fiction series covers the Jedi training of Jacen and Jaina.

In &quot;The Truce at Bakura&quot; (1993) by Kathy Tyers, set one day after the ending of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, Leia establishes New Alderaan, a sanctuary for the destroyed planet&#x27;s surviving inhabitants. The spirit of Anakin Skywalker appears to Leia and pleads for her forgiveness, but she angrily banishes him. The six-volume &quot;Jedi Prince&quot; series (1992–93) by Paul Davids and Hollace Davids, later contradicted by other novels, is set within a year after &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. In &quot;The Glove of Darth Vader&quot; (1992), the self-proclaimed son of the defeated Emperor Palpatine, Trioculus, seeks the titular glove to cement himself as the new Emperor. Entranced by Leia&#x27;s beauty in &quot;The Lost City of the Jedi&quot; (1992), Trioculus vows to make her his queen. He captures her in &quot;Zorba the Hutt&#x27;s Revenge&quot; (1992), but Jabba the Hutt&#x27;s vengeful father, Zorba, offers to trade his own prisoner Ken—Palpatine&#x27;s real grandson whom Trioculus has been seeking—for Leia, his son&#x27;s killer. But Leia and Ken are rescued and Trioculus is frozen in carbonate by Zorba. &quot;Mission from Mount Yoda&quot; (1993) finds Ken&#x27;s father Triclops alive and willing to join the Rebels against the Empire. Leia, now engaged to Han, is captured by Zorba in &quot;Queen of the Empire&quot; (1993). Trioculus is revived and seizes Leia before Zorba can kill her. Leia is rescued and replaced with a lookalike droid decoy, which kills Trioculus. In &quot;Prophets of the Dark Side&quot; (1993), Leia looks forward to her wedding to Han and has a vision of their two children. Matthew Stover&#x27;s 2008 standalone novel &quot;Luke Skywalker and the Shadows of Mindor&quot; picks up the story soon after, as Luke, Leia and the Rebels fight the Sith Lord Shadowspawn.

In &quot;The Courtship of Princess Leia&quot; (1994) by Dave Wolverton, set immediately before the &quot;Thrawn&quot; trilogy, Leia is presented with an advantageous political marriage to Prince Isolder of the planet Hapes. A jealous Han abducts Leia and takes her to the planet Dathomir; Luke and Isolder follow, and there they all find the hidden forces of the Imperial warlord Zsinj. Defeating him, Han and Leia marry. The 2003 novels &quot;A Forest Apart&quot; and &quot;Tatooine Ghost&quot; by Troy Denning are set immediately after &quot;The Courtship of Princess Leia&quot;. The newly married Leia fears that any children she has may succumb to the dark side like her father. During an adventure on Tatooine in &quot;Tatooine Ghost&quot;, she discovers the diary of her grandmother Shmi Skywalker and meets some of young Anakin&#x27;s childhood friends. When she learns of Anakin&#x27;s childhood as a slave and the traumatic death of his mother, Leia learns to forgive her father.

==== Works set between films ====
In &quot;Shadows of the Empire&quot; (1996) by Steve Perry, the only &quot;Star Wars&quot; novel set between &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, Leia is searching for Boba Fett to find a captive Han. She is bewitched by the crime lord Prince Xizor using pheromones, but Chewbacca helps her elude the seduction.

&quot;Allegiance&quot; (2007) and &quot;Choices of One&quot; (2011) by Timothy Zahn are set between &quot;Star Wars: A New Hope&quot; and &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, and feature Leia and her cohorts seeking new allies for their Rebellion against the Empire. &quot;Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot; (2013) by Martha Wells and &quot;Honor Among Thieves&quot; (2014) by James S. A. Corey take place in the same time period and also chronicle the adventures of Leia and Han.

==== &quot;New Jedi Order&quot; ====
In the &quot;New Jedi Order&quot; series (1999–2003), Leia resigns as Chief of State, and on the heels of her warnings before the Senate, the alien Yuuzhan Vong invade the galaxy. They destroy system after system and defeat both the Jedi and the New Republic forces in countless battles. Chewbacca dies in &quot;Vector Prime&quot; (1999) by R.A. Salvatore, which sends Han into a deep depression that causes a rift between him and Leia. They reunite after Leia is gravely wounded at the Battle of Duro in Kathy Tyers&#x27; &quot;Balance Point&quot; (2000). She is targeted by a deadly Voxyn slayer in Troy Dennings&#x27; &quot;Star By Star&quot; (2001), and though she manages to evade death, her son Anakin is later killed during a mission to prevent more Voxyn from being cloned. The Vong are finally defeated in &quot;The Unifying Force&quot; (2003) by James Luceno.

In Denning&#x27;s The &quot;Dark Nest&quot; trilogy (2005), Leia, Han, and several Jedi become involved in an escalating border dispute between the Chiss and the insidious insectoid Killiks, and Leia makes a bitter enemy in the Twi&#x27;lek warrior Alema Rar. In &quot;The Joiner King&quot; (2005), Leia asks Saba Sebatyne to train her as a Jedi Knight. R2-D2 malfunctions in &quot;The Unseen Queen&quot; (2005) and shows Luke a holoclip of his father Anakin and a pregnant woman, whom Luke learns is his and Leia&#x27;s biological mother, Padmé Amidala. Anakin and Padmé are discussing a dream of Anakin&#x27;s in which Padmé dies in childbirth; later, Luke and Leia watch a clip in which Padmé is talking to Obi-Wan Kenobi about Anakin. Tenel Ka, Queen Mother of the Hapes Consortium, has a daughter, Allana, secretly fathered by Jacen. In &quot;The Swarm War&quot; (2005), Luke and Leia view holoclips of their mother&#x27;s death, and Leia is promoted to Jedi Knight.

==== &quot;Legacy of the Force&quot; ====
The bestselling &quot;Legacy of the Force&quot; series (2006–08) chronicles the crossover of Han and Leia&#x27;s son Jacen to the dark side of the Force while the Jedi, Solos, and Skywalkers fight against his growing power. In &quot;Betrayal&quot; (2006) by Aaron Allston, Jacen turns to the dark side, believing that it is the only way to save the galaxy from the chaos brewing among the member systems of the Galactic Alliance. Jacen realizes in &quot;Bloodlines&quot; (2006) by Karen Traviss that the Sith discipline will require him to kill one of his loved ones, which he decides is an acceptable sacrifice to save the galaxy. In Troy Denning&#x27;s &quot;Tempest&quot; (2006), Han and Leia thwart the assassination of Tenel Ka and Allana but become caught up in a Corellian conspiracy. They are almost killed when the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot; is attacked by a Star Destroyer controlled by an increasingly powerful Jacen—who knows that his parents are on board. With Han injured, Leia and Lando further investigate the Corellians in Aaron Allston&#x27;s &quot;Exile&quot; (2007), but Alema reappears to exact her vengeance on Leia. &quot;Sacrifice&quot; (2007) by Karen Traviss finds Leia and Han on the run, hunted by Jacen as traitors to the Galactic Alliance. He kills Luke&#x27;s wife Mara Jade as his final sacrifice to become Darth Caedus, the new ruler of the Sith. In &quot;Inferno&quot; (2007) by Troy Denning, Han and Leia are faced with the reality that their son, now Joint Chief of State, is the enemy. Leia attempts unsuccessfully to manipulate Jacen in Aaron Allston&#x27;s &quot;Fury&quot; (2007) so that the Jedi can both thwart him and neutralize Alema. Finally, in &quot;Invincible&quot; (2008) by Troy Denning, Jaina kills Jacen in a lightsaber duel. At Tenel Ka&#x27;s request, Leia and Han adopt Allana, disguised with the name &quot;Amelia&quot; to protect her from any future vengeance against Cadeus or the Hapes Consortium. Multiple novels in the series made &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.

The nine-volume &quot;Fate of the Jedi&quot; series (2009–12) by Aaron Allston, Troy Denning, and Christie Golden finds Han and Leia become caught up in the intensifying conflict between the Galactic Alliance and the Jedi. In the wake of Darth Cadeus&#x27; death, the now-peaceful Galactic Alliance harbors a growing mistrust toward the Jedi, and the situation is worsened by a Force-induced psychosis that begins afflicting individual Jedi, sending them on violent rampages.

In &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot; (2008) by James Luceno, set between &quot;Legacy of the Force&quot; and &quot;Fate of the Jedi&quot;, a mysterious device hidden inside the eponymous spacecraft sends Han, Leia and Allana on an adventure to investigate the ship&#x27;s past before it came into Han&#x27;s possession. Troy Denning&#x27;s &quot;Crucible&quot; (2013), set after &quot;Fate of the Jedi&quot; and the last novel to date in the &quot;Star Wars Legends&quot; chronology, reunites Leia, Han and Luke with Lando as they aid him to thwart a vast criminal enterprise threatening his asteroid mineral refinery in the Chilean Rift nebula.

Leia&#x27;s youth is depicted in the &quot;Star Wars Tales&quot; story &quot;The Princess Leia Diaries&quot;. Leia develops a disdain for the Empire, as well as a conflict with Tarkin. She discovers and decides to support the Rebellion.

During the events of the comic series &quot;Dark Empire&quot; (1991–92), Palpatine has been resurrected in a clone body. As part of his plan to restore the Empire, he seduces Luke to the dark side of the Force. Leia resists Palpatine&#x27;s attempts to turn her as well, and escapes with the Jedi Holocron, an artifact he needs to secure his power. When Luke pursues her, Leia manages to turn him back. Luke and Leia then fight Palpatine with the light side of the Force, destroying him with his own Force-generated storm. In &quot;Dark Empire II&quot; (1994–95), Leia gives birth to a third child, Anakin Solo. Palpatine is reborn in a rapidly deteriorating clone body in &quot;Empire&#x27;s End&quot; (1995), and seeks to possess the body of the infant Anakin.

===Video games===
Leia is a playable character in &quot;Star Wars Battlefront&quot;, &quot;Star Wars Battlefront II&quot;, Disney Infinity 3.0, and many Lego &quot;Star Wars&quot; video games.

==Cultural impact==

Princess Leia has been called a 1980s icon and a feminist hero. In 2008, Leia was selected by &quot;Empire&quot; magazine as the 89th greatest film character of all time, and in 2010 UGO Networks listed Leia as one of the best heroes of all time.

The character has been referenced or parodied in several TV shows and films, and is celebrated in cosplay. In 2013, cartoonist Jeffrey Brown published the bestselling &quot;Star Wars: Vader&#x27;s Little Princess&quot;, a comic strip-style book featuring Darth Vader and a young Leia in humorous father-daughter situations.

Leia has also been used in a wide range of &quot;Star Wars&quot; merchandise, including statuettes, action figures and other toys, household items and clothing, office supplies, food products, and bubble bath and shampoo in Leia-shaped bottles with her head as the cap. In her one-woman show &quot;Wishful Drinking&quot;, Fisher called the Princess Leia Pez dispenser one of the &quot;merchandising horrors&quot; of the series. In a 2011 interview, Fisher said:

After the 2012 acquisition of LucasFilm by the Walt Disney Company, the Disney Store stated in May 2014 that the company had &quot;no plans for Leia products&quot;. After public criticism, Disney told &quot;Time&quot; in June 2014 that it would be releasing several Leia products. Funko has since produced several versions of Leia (at least one for each film) in their POP! line of 4.5-inch vinyl figures in the Japanese super deformed style. Hasbro released an action figure of Leia as she appears in the &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot; animated series in 2016.

===&quot;Cinnamon buns&quot; hairstyle===
Leia&#x27;s unique hairdo in &quot;Star Wars&quot;—arranged in two large buns, one on each side of her head—has come to be known as the &quot;doughnut&quot; or &quot;cinnamon buns&quot; hairstyle, and is iconic of the character and series. When asked in a 2002 interview about the origins of Leia&#x27;s hairstyle, Lucas said he was aiming for &quot;a kind of Southwestern Pancho Villa woman revolutionary look&quot; from &quot;turn-of-the-century Mexico.&quot; An exhibit at the Denver Art Museum credited a particular revolutionary—later identified as Clara de la Rocha—as an inspiration for the coiffure. The museum stated that Leia&#x27;s hair arrangement was also influenced by a hairstyle worn by indigenous Hopi women of North America. &quot;Empire&quot; suggested that Leia&#x27;s hairdo was based on that of Queen Fria, a character from the 1930s &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; comic serial. Lucas had originally wanted to film an adaptation of &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;, but unable to obtain the rights, he began developing an original project which would become &quot;Star Wars&quot;.

A February 1978 cover story for the British teen magazine &quot;Jackie&quot; included step-by-step instructions on how to replicate Leia&#x27;s hair buns. In the 1978 short film parody &quot;Hardware Wars&quot;, Princess Anne-Droid has actual cinnamon buns on the side of her head. Miss Piggy of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; copied the hairdo in a &quot;Star Wars&quot;-themed episode of the series in February 1980. In the 1987 Mel Brooks comedy film &quot;Spaceballs&quot;, Princess Vespa (Daphne Zuniga) appears to have the hairstyle, which is soon revealed to in fact be a large pair of headphones. In the parody film &quot;Thumb Wars&quot;, the role of Leia was filled by a character named Princess Bunhead, who has two cinnamon rolls for hair. In 2015, Fisher&#x27;s daughter Billie Lourd&#x27;s character in the horror-comedy TV series &quot;Scream Queens&quot;, a rich and disaffected sorority girl known as Chanel No. 3, wears earmuffs in every scene as an homage to Fisher&#x27;s iconic Leia hairstyle. Lourd also has a cameo in &quot;The Force Awakens&quot; (2015) in which she wears Leia&#x27;s distinctive hair buns.

===Feminist analysis===
Leia has been the subject of feminist analysis. David Bushman, television curator at the Paley Center for Media, said in 2012, &quot;From the male perspective ... Princess Leia was a very creditable character for her time—not perfect, but certainly defiant, assertive, and strong.&quot; Alyssa Rosenberg of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote in 2015, &quot;Leia wasn&#x27;t just the first great heroine of science fiction and fantasy to capture my imagination. She was one of the first characters I encountered whose power came from her political conviction and acumen.&quot; In her 2007 article &quot;Feminism and the Force: Empowerment and Disillusionment in a Galaxy Far, Far Away&quot;, Diana Dominguez cited Leia as a welcome change from the previous portrayals of women in film and TV. She wrote:

Rosenberg writes that, though at first Luke is an apolitical innocent in search of adventure and Han is a detached opportunist in search of money, both are &quot;influenced by Leia&#x27;s passion [and] take their places as full participants in the Rebellion&quot;. She notes, &quot;Everyone else eventually comes around to Leia&#x27;s view of the world.&quot; Leia herself, singularly dedicated to her political movement against the Empire, &quot;finds a partner in Han, acknowledging that personal happiness can help her sustain her commitment to building a better galactic order&quot;. Rosenberg cites &quot;Leia&#x27;s willingness to see the best in him, and Han&#x27;s desire to live up to her belief in him&quot; as a foundation of their relationship, also pointing out his attempts to make her recognize that she has needs like anyone else and should acknowledge that she needs him.

In their 2012 essay &quot;Lightsabers, Political Arenas, and Marriages&quot;, Ray Merlock and Kathy Merlock Jackson cite Leia as the successor of earlier science fiction heroines Wilma Deering of &quot;Buck Rogers&quot; and Dale Arden of &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;, and the embodiment of &quot;a new stage in the ongoing presentation of the fairy-tale princess in jeopardy&quot;. Writing that &quot;after Leia, no longer would princesses be passive and salvaged simply with a kiss,&quot; they note the reflection of the character in later Disney Princess animated films and in woman warriors such as Ellen Ripley from the &quot;Alien&quot; franchise and Xena of the adventure TV series &quot;&quot;. A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Leia as &quot;a foremother of Hermione Granger and Katniss Everdeen and of countless latter-day Disney princesses. She also foretold the recent, somewhat belated feminist turn in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; cycle itself&quot;.

Mark Hamill described Fisher&#x27;s performance as:
Fisher herself described Leia as a &quot;huge&quot; feminist icon, dismissing the suggestion that the character was ever a &quot;damsel in distress&quot;. Fisher said of Leia, &quot;She bossed them around. I don&#x27;t know what your idea of distress is, but that wasn&#x27;t it! And I wasn&#x27;t some babe running through the galaxy with my tits bouncing around. So I wasn&#x27;t threatening to women&quot;. She added, &quot;I &quot;like&quot; Princess Leia. I like how she was feisty. I like how she killed Jabba the Hutt&quot;. &quot;I think I am Princess Leia, and Princess Leia is me. It&#x27;s like a Möbius striptease.&quot;

===Metal bikini===

Leia&#x27;s slave costume when she is held captive by Jabba the Hutt at the beginning of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;—made of brass and dubbed Leia&#x27;s &quot;Metal Bikini&quot; or &quot;Gold Bikini&quot;—immediately made the character (and Fisher) a &quot;generational sex symbol&quot; celebrated by pin-up posters, and later merchandising and cosplay. Philip Chien of &quot;Wired&quot; wrote in 2006, &quot;There&#x27;s no doubt that the sight of Carrie Fisher in the gold sci-fi swimsuit was burned into the sweaty subconscious of a generation of fanboys hitting puberty in the spring of 1983.&quot; Fisher said in 2015, &quot;I am not a sex symbol, so that&#x27;s an opinion of someone. I don’t share that&quot;.

Allie Townsend of &quot;Time&quot; wrote in 2011 that the so-called &quot;slave Leia&quot; outfit has gained a cult following of its own. Rosenberg noted that &quot;the costume has become culturally iconic in a way that has slipped loose from the context of the scenes in which Leia wore it and the things she does after she is forced into the outfit.&quot; Acknowledging the opinion of some that the &quot;slave Leia&quot; iconography tarnishes the character&#x27;s position as &quot;feminist hero&quot;, Rosenberg argued:
Science fiction filmmaker Letia Clouston concurred, saying &quot;Sci-fi has had a long history of strong female characters. Yes, Princess Leia was in a gold bikini, but she was also the one who single-handedly killed Jabba. When you take into account movies and TV shows like &quot;Terminator&quot;, &quot;Aliens&quot;, &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, and even video games like &quot;Metroid&quot;, you can see sci-fi has consistently promoted the strength of women more than any other genre.&quot; Peter W. Lee argues that the bikini connotes Leia&#x27;s hopelessness and helplessness, but even in that demeaning costume she retains her dignity and remains an icon of feminism. Noah Berlatsky argued in &quot;The Guardian&quot; for a deeper significance to the costume beyond its function as a sex symbol, stating that the outfit represents an important stage in Princess Leia&#x27;s complicated relationship with Han Solo.

The outfit was created by Aggie Guerard Rodgers and Nilo Rodis-Jamero, costume designers for &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. According to Rodgers, the design was inspired by the work of fantasy illustrator Frank Frazetta. Author Rikke Schubart suggested the design was also inspired by the work of science fiction illustrator Earle K. Bergey. The outfit featured a sculpted metal string bikini top, paired with a bottom consisting of sculpted metal plates in the front and back covering a red silk loincloth. Fisher wore leather boots, serpentine jewelry and a collar and chain that bound her to her captor, which she ultimately uses to strangle him. Multiple versions of the metal bikini were created to accommodate different scenes in the film, including metal pieces by sculptor Richard Miller for scenes in which Fisher remained still, and a rubber version she and stuntwoman Tracy Eddon could wear comfortably while performing stunts. The costume designers made a mold of Fisher&#x27;s torso so it could be designed to a custom fit. Fisher quipped that the bikini was &quot;what supermodels will eventually wear in the seventh ring of hell.&quot;

Fisher posed in the costume for a 1983 cover story in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. The costume has been parodied in various TV series and films, including &quot;Friends&quot; (1996), &quot;Family Guy&quot; (2000) and &quot;Fanboys&quot; (2009). Yvonne Strahovski&#x27;s appearance wearing the costume in &quot;Chuck&quot; (2009) prompted &quot;Wizard&quot; to rank her No. 24 of the 25 sexiest women on TV in 2008. &quot;IGN&quot; gave Strahovski the top honor in a similar list. Comedian Amy Schumer wore a replica of the outfit for the August 2015 cover of &quot;GQ&quot;.

An original rubber version of the costume sold for $96,000 at auction in 2015, and another version sold for $175,000 in 2024.
Despite its iconic status among many fans of the franchise, the slave Leia outfit has sometimes incited controversy. In response to a 2015 news segment in which parents described difficulties explaining toys featuring the costume (including a chain around Leia&#x27;s neck) to their children. Fisher called Disney&#x27;s decision &quot;stupid,&quot; saying, &quot;Tell [the kids] that a giant slug captured me and forced me to wear that stupid outfit, and then I killed him because I didn&#x27;t like it.&quot;

<text>Lando Calrissian is a fictional character in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise. He is introduced in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980) as a friend of Han Solo and the administrator of Cloud City on the planet Bespin. Prior to the events of the film, Lando made a career as a gambler, con artist, playboy, mining engineer, and businessman, and was the owner of the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot; until losing the ship to Han in a bet. In the film, when Cloud City is threatened by the Galactic Empire, Lando reluctantly betrays Han to Darth Vader, but later helps Han&#x27;s friends escape from the Empire. In &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983), after becoming a general in the Rebel Alliance, Lando helps rescue Han from Jabba the Hutt and leads the attack on the second Death Star.

Lando is portrayed by Billy Dee Williams in the original trilogy, as well as the sequel film &quot;The Rise of Skywalker&quot; (2019). Donald Glover portrays a younger Lando in the standalone film &quot;&quot; (2018), which depicts the beginning of his relationship with Han. Lando also appears in novels, comics and video games.

Williams was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Lando in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. Glover&#x27;s performance in &quot;Solo&quot; was also well received, being hailed as one of the film&#x27;s highlights. A further film starring Glover as the character, tentatively titled &quot;Lando&quot;, is currently in development.

==Concept and creation==
===Development===

When writing &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, George Lucas planned to introduce a gambler-type character, which developed into Lando Calrissian. Wanting the character to be a foil to the &quot;rough&quot; swashbuckler Han Solo (possibly an old friend), Lucas envisioned Lando as a cool con man with the elegance of James Bond and wit of &quot;Star Trek&quot;&#x27;s Spock. He would support the Empire, thinking that he could outsmart the Imperials before coming to see the Rebellion as a more worthy cause.

Lucas thought Lando could superficially look like a normal human but—drawing from the Clone Wars mentioned in the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; film—be a clone from a ruling clan of others just like him (causing Princess Leia to distrust him). His faction, from one of many planets of clone countries, was probably &quot;partly responsible for the war&quot;. Lucas saw the character as a Rudolph Valentino character, &quot;almost too perfect looking&quot; due to his genes being manipulated in the cloning process.

Actor Yaphet Kotto was an early choice for the role, but he chose to appear in the prison drama &quot;Brubaker&quot; instead. Billy Dee Williams later stated that he built the character around two features he found interesting; the cape and the Armenian name &quot;Calrissian&quot;. The original teaser trailer for &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; introduced the character as Landau Calrissian.

Lando&#x27;s cane in &quot;The Rise of Skywalker&quot; (2019) was designed to resemble Cloud City. It is inscribed with the name &quot;Baron Lando Calrissian&quot;.

===Portrayal===
In 2018, &quot;The Verge&quot; noted that despite Han Solo&#x27;s first name being written as &quot;Han&quot; and Lucas also pronouncing the name as &quot;Han&quot; () off-screen, within the films most characters, including Luke Skywalker, pronounce it as &quot;Hahn&quot; (). &quot;The Verge&quot; also noted how Williams&#x27;s Lando seems to be the only character to pronounce it as &quot;Han&quot; like Lucas, and that when, in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, Lando is choked by Chewbacca for betraying Han, Lando causes most other characters to shift to &quot;Han&quot;. In &quot;&quot;, Glover decided to deliberately use &quot;Han&quot; instead of &quot;Hahn&quot; in order to honor the character&#x27;s trait.

Ahead of the release of &quot;Solo: A Star Wars Story&quot;, co-writer Jonathan Kasdan suggested that Lando is pansexual and stated, &quot;There&#x27;s a fluidity to [Donald Glover] and Billy Dee&#x27;s [portrayal of Lando&#x27;s] sexuality ... I would have loved to have gotten a more explicitly LGBT character into this movie. I think it&#x27;s time, certainly, for that, and I love the fluidity ― sort of the spectrum of sexuality that Donald appeals to and that droids are a part of. He doesn&#x27;t make any hard and fast rules.&quot; When asked about a scene where L3-37 jokes about Lando&#x27;s being flirtatious towards Han, writer Lawrence Kasdan said, &quot;That is her personality. Maybe it means something, maybe it doesn&#x27;t.&quot; When asked about Lando&#x27;s pansexuality, Donald Glover stated, &quot;How can you not be pansexual in space? There&#x27;s so many things to have sex with.&quot; In recent years, Marvel LGBT pride-themed series of comic covers have featured Lando, canonizing the character&#x27;s LGBT status.

== Appearances ==

===Film===
Lando is portrayed by Billy Dee Williams in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980), &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983), and &quot;The Rise of Skywalker&quot; (2019), and by Donald Glover in &quot;Solo: A Star Wars Story&quot; (2018).

====Original trilogy====
Lando Calrissian first appears in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; as the administrator of Cloud City, an old friend of Han Solo (Harrison Ford), and the previous owner of Han&#x27;s ship, the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot;. When Han, Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) arrive at Cloud City, Lando welcomes them as guests of honor – only to betray them to Darth Vader (portrayed by David Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones), who plans to use them as bait to ensnare Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). Lando had reluctantly agreed to betray Han and company after Vader threatened the city if he refused. Lando allows Vader to freeze Han in carbonite and give him to bounty hunter Boba Fett (Jeremy Bulloch); when Vader takes Leia and Chewbacca prisoner, however, Lando&#x27;s conscience gets the better of him in light of Vader&#x27;s capriciousness altering his agreement at will. In the ensuing evacuation of Cloud City, he helps them escape in the &quot;Falcon&quot;. He later assists in rescuing Luke from the underside of Cloud City. Afterwards, he promises to help find Han.

In &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, Lando goes undercover to help Luke rescue Han from crime lord Jabba the Hutt. During a battle with Jabba&#x27;s thugs, Han saves Lando from being devoured by the sarlacc; Lando then helps Han and the others destroy Jabba&#x27;s barge. He is made a general in the Rebel Alliance for his heroics. Lando then takes the pilot chair in his old ship, the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot;, and leads the attack on the second Death Star. He leads the Rebel strike on the battle station, and personally destroys its power core, causing the station to explode. He then joins the other Rebels on Endor in celebrating their victory and the end of the Empire.

====Sequel trilogy====
Lando did not appear in the first film of the sequel trilogy, &quot;The Force Awakens&quot; (2015). According to Williams, the reason Lando did not return may have been that he did not fit into the storyline. His absence from the casting announcement caused the displeasure of some fans.

Lando was also absent from &quot;The Last Jedi&quot; (2017). During the early development of the film, director Rian Johnson briefly considered bringing back Lando as the codebreaker that Resistance members Finn (John Boyega) and Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) seek in the coastal city of Canto Bight, but Lando was finally written out of the film&#x27;s script, with the codebreaker role ultimately going to Benicio del Toro&#x27;s character DJ.

Lando finally reappeared in 2019&#x27;s &quot;The Rise of Skywalker&quot;, marking one of the longest intervals between portrayals of a character by the same actor in American film history. In the backstory to the film, in the years of peace after the Galactic Civil War, Lando attempted to start a family, and had a daughter, who was kidnapped by unknown culprits when she was two years old. In time, it became clear that the First Order was behind both her abduction and those of other children of former Rebel leaders, who had become stormtroopers, thereby leaving them reluctant to order any action against the fledgling organisation, lest they unwittingly kill their own children. After the tragedy of losing his daughter and his failure in a quest with Luke Skywalker to find answers about the growing darkness in the Force, Lando left his wife and settled on the desert planet of Pasaana, adopting a life of solitude.

Lando returns in &quot;The Rise of Skywalker&quot; on Pasaana, appearing jovial and guiding Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn, and Chewbacca toward a clue for the whereabouts of the Sith wayfinder. Poe asks Lando to aid the Resistance, but Lando refuses, saying he does not fly anymore, but sends his regards to Leia. Lando reappears much later in the film, upon Leia&#x27;s death, and he tells a grieving Poe that he, Luke, Leia, and Han were similarly unprepared when they were fighting the Empire, but that they were able to succeed because they had each other. This inspires Poe to launch an offensive against the Sith Eternal forces, including the Final Order, with Lando traveling the galaxy to recruit Rebel veterans and other supporters of the Resistance&#x27;s cause to help in the final battle. Just as the Resistance appears most overwhelmed in the battle, Lando, Chewbacca, and Wedge Antilles (Denis Lawson) arrive in the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot; alongside a massive fleet of Resistance sympathizers, allies, and veterans, and they help to win the battle and the war. At the end of the film, as the galaxy is celebrating the Resistance&#x27;s victory against Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) and the Sith Eternal, Jannah (Naomi Ackie), a former stormtrooper, approaches Lando and says she does not know where she is from; he tells her that they will find out together.

=== &quot;Solo: A Star Wars Story&quot; ===
Donald Glover portrays a younger Lando in the 2018 standalone film &quot;&quot;, which takes place roughly thirteen years before &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;. Glover had the opportunity to speak with Billy Dee Williams and seek his input. &quot;He said, &#x27;Just be charming&#x27;. Which is the best advice.&quot;

In the film, Lando is introduced as a gambler and semi-retired smuggler who owns a ship fast enough for Han and his associates to use in stealing a load of raw starship fuel. Han tries to win the ship (the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot;) from him in a game of sabacc, but Lando cheats and cleans Han out. However, Lando agrees to join the team in exchange for a percentage of the profits from the mission. During the heist and subsequent escape, Lando is injured and his droid co-pilot L3-37 is irreparably damaged, but Han brings the &quot;Falcon&quot; to safety with help from L3&#x27;s navigational database after he hotwires it into the ship&#x27;s computer. Lando later takes the &quot;Falcon&quot; and abandons the team, but Han tracks him down and wins it from him in another game of sabacc, having stolen the card Lando had up his sleeve to let him cheat.

In December 2020, Disney announced a &quot;Lando&quot; streaming series for Disney+, with Justin Simien as showrunner. In July 2023, it was reported that Donald Glover was attached to reprise his role from &quot;Solo&quot; and would the project with his brother Stephen, who that September announced that the project was now planned as a feature film.

===Television series===
Billy Dee Williams returned to the role in the &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot; episodes &quot;Idiot&#x27;s Array&quot; and &quot;The Siege of Lothal&quot;.

In &quot;Idiot&#x27;s Array&quot;, Lando wins Chopper (voiced by Dave Filoni), the repair droid of the crew of the &quot;Ghost&quot;, in a game of sabacc, forcing the crew to assist him with a dangerous smuggling run to get their droid back. The crew become Lando&#x27;s reluctant business partners following the ordeal, leading to their first encounter with the crime boss Azmorigan (voiced by James Hong). In &quot;The Siege of Lothal&quot;, the crew of the &quot;Ghost&quot; approach Lando for help in getting off of Lothal, which is under Imperial occupation. He is also mentioned on occasion in various other episodes, becoming one of a couple of aliases employed by Ezra Bridger (voiced by Taylor Gray).

===Video games===
Billy Dee Williams reprises his role as Lando Calrissian in various games, including as a playable character in &quot;Star Wars Battlefront&quot; and &quot;Battlefront II&quot;.

===Comics===
Lando Calrissian appears in Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;Lando&quot; (2015), a five-issue miniseries set shortly before the original trilogy. Lando has a brief appearance in the miniseries &quot;Shattered Empire&quot; (2015), which takes place after &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. Lando is also featured in the comic &quot;Lando: Double or Nothing&quot; (2018), a five-issue miniseries set just before &quot;Solo: A Star Wars Story&quot;.

The 2020 relaunch of Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars&quot; series, picking up at the tail end of &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, reveals that Lando returns to Cloud City to retrieve Lobot and help Luke look for his lightsaber.

===Books===
The novel &quot;Star Wars: Last Shot&quot; reveals that between &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; and &quot;The Force Awakens&quot;, Lando is considering settling down with a Twi&#x27;lek girlfriend.

== &quot;Star Wars Legends&quot; ==
Following the acquisition of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company in 2012, most of the licensed &quot;Star Wars&quot; novels and comics produced between 1977 and 2014 were rebranded as &quot;Star Wars Legends&quot; and declared non-canon to the franchise. The &quot;Legends&quot; works comprise a separate narrative universe.

Lando is featured in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; comic book series released by Marvel Comics. In the series, he has a crime lord nemesis named Drebble, and Lando frequently made use of his foil&#x27;s name as a cover identity so that any animosity he generates while using the alias will be brought against the real Drebble, not Lando himself. This eventually backfires when &quot;Drebble&#x27;s&quot; exploits are recognized by the Rebellion and Lando—being the only person who knows of him—has to present the real Drebble with an award for his own activities.

Lando is a supporting character in &quot;Legends&quot; novels that took place after &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; commonly depicted Lando as getting involved in a variety of entrepreneurial schemes, including Nomad City in Timothy Zahn&#x27;s &quot;Thrawn&quot; trilogy and the Kessel Spice Mines in the works of Kevin J. Anderson. During &quot;The Corellian Trilogy&quot;, Lando goes on a galaxy-wide hunt for a rich wife, ultimately marrying Tendra Risant. With his in-laws&#x27; money and his entrepreneurial abilities, he opens a mining facility on the Outer Rim planet of Dubrillion. In &quot;The New Jedi Order&quot; and beyond, Lando continues being a valuable ally and friend to the Skywalker/Solo family. In &quot;Fury&quot;, the seventh novel of the &quot;Legacy of the Force&quot; series, Lando announces to Han and Leia that he and Tendra are having a child.

Kevin J. Anderson stated that Lucasfilm toyed with the idea of killing off Lando, noting the character had run his course for Expanded Universe authors in the 1990s.

=== &quot;The Lando Calrissian Adventures&quot; ===
The Lando Calrissian Adventures is a 1983 trilogy of science fiction novels by L. Neil Smith. Set in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; Expanded Universe, the novels chronicle Lando&#x27;s smuggling days before the events of the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy.
The series has been described as &quot;space pulp&quot;, and highlights the differences between Lando and Han Solo. The books were released in July, October, and December 1983, and were the first &quot;Star Wars&quot; books released since &quot;The Han Solo Adventures&quot; (1979–1980); both trilogies were originally published by Del Rey, a division of Ballantine Books. They were also among the last novels in the franchise until Timothy Zahn&#x27;s &quot;Thrawn&quot; trilogy was released in the early 1990s.
The series is set 3–2 years before the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; film, and is brought into chronological context with the rest of the Expanded Universe in &quot;Rebel Dawn &quot; (1998), the final book of A. C. Crispin&#x27;s &quot;Han Solo Trilogy&quot;.

For the duration of the trilogy, Lando is accompanied by a droid named Vuffi Raa. The novelization of &quot;Solo: A Star Wars Story&quot; makes reference to the events of the first book as a previous adventure of Lando&#x27;s, which he recounts while composing his autobiographical &quot;Calrissian Chronicles&quot;. He further estimates that it will be the first in a trilogy of his adventures.

Lando Calrissian and the Mindharp of Sharu is the first novel in Smith&#x27;s &quot;Lando Calrissian&quot; trilogy, published by Del Rey on 1 July 1983. It is noted as being more of a psychedelic fantasy novel than hard science fiction.
The book begins shortly after Lando wins the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot; in a game of sabacc, as well as a robot which must be picked up in the Rafa system. Upon the planet of Rafa IV, convicts are made to harvest mind-draining 
&quot;life-crystals&quot; which prolong the life of elite citizens. Lando is arrested and brought before the colony&#x27;s corrupt governor and the sorcerer Rokur Gepta, who will let him keep his life and liberty if he can locate the legendary Mindharp of the ancient and long-lost Sharu civilization. The Mindharp is revealed to be kept inside a multidimensional pyramid with mind-altering properties, which provides a strange adventure for the daring Lando.

Lando Calrissian and the Flamewind of Oseon is the second novel in the trilogy, published on 1 October 1983. After selling a load of life-crystals, and accompanied by his droid Vuffi Raa, Lando attempts a career as an honest freighter captain. After some bad luck, he is soon nostalgic for his old trade. Fortunately, he is invited to a sabacc game on Oseon celebrating an event called Flamewind, but is followed by Rokur Gepta. After an explosion rocks the hull of the &quot;Falcon&quot;, they safely land. During the sabacc game, Lando is distracted by the apparent sabotage of his ship, and is assaulted. He comes under trial for having a weapon, illegal on the planet. He is offered a smuggling deal as an alternative to execution.

Lando Calrissian and the Starcave of ThonBoka is the third novel, published on 1 December 1983. Nearly a year after Lando and Vuffi Raa have left the Oseon system, while traveling in deep space they encounter Lehesu, a vacuum-breathing creature. Able to establish communication, they find out he is also on an adventure away from his home, the ThonBoka nebula. A month later, Lando and Raa receive word that ThonBoka is under attack from the Imperial Centrality Navy. Lehesu&#x27;s exploration of the Centrality apparently provoked the attack on his species. Lando and Raa rush to assist their friend.
The Imperial blockade makes Lando nervous, but he cons his way through the fleet. When the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot; strays from its course and is ordered to return, they dump explosives and go into hyperspace to fake the &quot;Falcon&quot;&#x27;s destruction. Meanwhile, Rokur Gepta forms an alliance with a confederate squadron. Lando and Raa reunite with Lehesu, and hear of a negotiation attempt which only results in an outbreak of battle. The vacuum-breathing creatures use their projection and hyperspace abilities to fool the Imperial Navy, which fires on its allied ships. As Vuffi Raa pilots the &quot;Falcon&quot;, Lando engages the enemy in battle from the quad-gun in one of their last adventures before Raa is resummoned to his original programming.

=== Video games ===
Williams reprised his role as Lando in &quot;Legends&quot; videogame &quot;Star Wars: Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast&quot;, where he assists Kyle Katarn through the second half of the Nar Shaadaa levels and helps him reach Bespin.
In &quot;Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga&quot;, Calrissian is an unlockable playable character, having the characteristic of being able to kiss Leia&#x27;s hand if she is nearby. Lando is also a playable character as a hero character for the Rebels in the video games &quot;Star Wars Battlefront&quot; and &quot;Star Wars: Battlefront II&quot;.

==Reception==
Author Adilufu Nama wrote in 2008 that Lando &quot;offered a new benchmark in the status of black representation in science fiction cinema&quot;. According to Alyssa Rosenberg of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Lando is a &quot;fascinating and fraught part of the ″&quot;Star Wars&quot;″ legacy and the conversation around race in science fiction&quot;. She added that &quot;Lando&#x27;s the only character in ″&quot;Star Wars&quot;″ with a truly comfortable sense of style.&quot; On his portrayal, she wrote, &quot;One of Williams&#x27;s accomplishments in ″&quot;Empire&quot;″ and ″&quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;″ is how much he [feels] like an old-fashioned movie star in a futuristic setting without making the performance seem incongruous.&quot;

In 2015, Billy Dee Williams publicly admitted that he received backlash from children who were angered by Lando&#x27;s betrayal of Han in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;. Williams felt that the situation would have been different if Lando had been played by a white actor. Williams wrote that &quot;Lando is not black or white, he&#x27;s just Lando. Above and beyond the arguments or discussions of bygone eras, he is of the future.&quot; He further stated,

Writing for &quot;The Verge&quot;, Megan Farokhmanesh criticized Jonathan Kasdan&#x27;s assertion that Lando is pansexual as &quot;a piss-poor shot at representation&quot;, and argued that Kasdan was conflating pansexuality with promiscuity. Farokhmanesh compared the assertion to J. K. Rowling&#x27;s statement that her character Albus Dumbledore is gay, despite no &quot;Harry Potter&quot; media depicting this. In 2019, Billy Dee Williams criticized the decision as well, blaming &quot;Solo&quot;&#x27;s underperformance at the box office on its focus on this &quot;topical&quot; issue.

<text>Boba Fett ( ) is a fictional character in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise. First appearing in the &quot;Star Wars Holiday Special&quot; (1978), where he was voiced by Don Francks, he is an armored bounty hunter featured in both the original and prequel film trilogies. In the original trilogy, the character is a supporting antagonist and was mainly portrayed by Jeremy Bulloch and voiced by Jason Wingreen. Notable for his taciturn demeanor and for never removing his helmet, Fett appears in both &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980), employed by the Galactic Empire, and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983), serving the crime lord Jabba the Hutt. While seemingly killed in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; after falling into a sarlacc, he has since appeared in &quot;Star Wars&quot; media set after the film, confirming his survival within the new canon, portrayed by Temuera Morrison. Daniel Logan plays a preteen Boba in the prequel film &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot; (2002), which reveals the character&#x27;s origins as the genetic clone and adoptive son of Jango Fett, also a famous bounty hunter. Morrison appeared first in Star Wars media playing Jango. The animated series &quot;The Bad Batch&quot; further reveals Boba to have been born Alpha, and to have a biological twin sister, Omega. The series also reveals that he has another sister named Emerie Karr.

The character also appears in many forms of &quot;Star Wars&quot; media outside of the films, such as books, comics, television series, and video games, many of which depict him as an antihero rather than a villain, and explore his background, motivations, and morality. Daniel Logan reprised his role as the younger version of Fett in the animated series &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot;, while Temuera Morrison, who also portrayed Jango in &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot;, has portrayed an adult Boba in most of his &quot;Star Wars&quot; appearances since that film, most prominently in the live-action Disney+ series &quot;The Mandalorian&quot; and its spin-off series &quot;The Book of Boba Fett&quot;, in which he assumes control over Tatooine with his partner Fennec Shand as the planet&#x27;s new daimyo.

During the development of &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, Fett was originally conceived as a member of a group of white-armored Imperial &quot;supercommandos&quot; before the idea was scrapped in favor of a solitary bounty hunter. This concept later evolved into the Mandalorians, a cultural group with strong warrior traditions, who sport armor and helmets similar to Fett&#x27;s. In several &quot;Star Wars&quot; works, Fett himself is portrayed as a Mandalorian or at least connected to the Mandalorian culture through his armor, with his father Jango confirmed to have been a Mandalorian foundling and war veteran in &quot;The Mandalorian&quot;.

The character of Boba Fett quickly became a fan favorite despite his limited presence in the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy and is now a widely recognized figure in popular culture. His popularity within the &quot;Star Wars&quot; fanbase has earned him a cult following.

==Concept and development==

&quot;Star Wars&quot; creator George Lucas created Boba Fett in his April 1978 screenplay draft of &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, basing the character on Italian filmmaker Sergio Leone&#x27;s Man with No Name (Clint Eastwood) from the &quot;Dollar Trilogy&quot;. The character needed to be designed quickly, as Lucas had agreed for him to be featured in the &quot;Star Wars Holiday Special&quot; later that year. The character&#x27;s design stemmed from initial concepts for Darth Vader, who was originally conceived as a rogue bounty hunter. While Vader became less of a mercenary and more of a dark knight, the bounty hunter concept remained, and Fett became &quot;an equally villainous&quot; but &quot;less conspicuous&quot; character. Concept artist Ralph McQuarrie influenced Fett&#x27;s design, which was finalized by and is credited to Joe Johnston.

Norman Reynolds and the film&#x27;s art department built the costume. Fett&#x27;s armor was originally designed for &quot;super troopers&quot;, and was adapted for Fett as the script developed. Screen-tested in all-white, Fett&#x27;s armor eventually garnered a subdued color scheme intended to visually place him between white-armored &quot;rank-and-file&quot; Imperial stormtroopers and Vader, who wears black. This color scheme had the bonus of conveying the &quot;gray morality&quot; of his character. The character&#x27;s armor was designed to appear to have been scavenged from multiple sources, and it is adorned with trophies. A description of Fett&#x27;s armor in the mid-1979 &quot;Bantha Tracks&quot; newsletter catalyzed &quot;rampant speculation&quot; about his origins. By 1979, Fett&#x27;s backstory included having served in an army of Imperial shock troops which had battled the clone troopers of the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars.

Despite two years of widespread publicity about Fett&#x27;s appearance in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, script rewrites significantly reduced the character&#x27;s presence in the film. Fett&#x27;s musical theme, composed by John Williams, is &quot;not music, exactly&quot; but &quot;more of a gurgly, viola-and-bassoon thing aurally cross-pollinated with some obscure static sounds.&quot; Sound editor Ben Burtt added the sound of jangling spurs, created and performed by the Foley artist team of Robert Rutledge and Edward Steidele, to Fett&#x27;s appearance in Cloud City, intending to make the character menacing and the scene reminiscent of similar gunfighter appearances in Western films. At one point in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;″s development, Fett was conceived as being a main villain, but he was finally replaced with the Emperor when Lucas decided to not make a third trilogy of &quot;Star Wars&quot;. Lucas also considered having Fett fight Lando Calrissian during the sarlacc sequence.

An official reference book states that Fett charges &quot;famously expensive&quot; fees, and that he undertakes only those missions which meet “his harsh sense of justice&quot;. Daniel Keys Moran, who wrote a few stories featuring Boba Fett, cited Westerns as an influence on his development of the character. Moran said:
Lucas at one point considered depicting Vader and Fett as brothers in the prequel films, but discounted it as too &quot;hokey&quot;. In continuing to develop the character in the prequel films, Lucas closed some avenues for expanding the character&#x27;s story while opening others by establishing that Fett is a clone of a similar bounty hunter, Jango Fett. Lucas considered modifying later editions of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; by adding a shot of Fett escaping the sarlacc, but decided against it because it would have detracted from the story&#x27;s focus. Lucas also said that, had he known Fett would be so popular, he would have made the character&#x27;s death &quot;more exciting&quot;. In 2014, after Lucas had sold Lucasfilm to Disney, &quot;Star Wars&quot; historian Jonathan W. Rinzler revealed that Lucas had privately acknowledged that Fett escaped from the sarlacc. This was canonically established with Fett&#x27;s appearances in &quot;The Mandalorian&quot; six years later portrayed by Temuera Morrison, which led to a spin-off focused on the character, &quot;The Book of Boba Fett&quot;, starring Morrison. Joe Johnston and Morrison himself criticized the decision to portray the character without his helmet, Morrison noting it was done to avoid comparisons with the titular character of &quot;The Mandalorian&quot;.

===Film casting and production===
Boba Fett is primarily played by Jeremy Bulloch in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. Bulloch&#x27;s half-brother alerted him to the role. He was cast as Fett because the costume happened to fit &quot;as if a Savile Row tailor had come out and made it&quot;; he did not have to do a reading or screen test, and Bulloch never worked from a script for either film.

Filming the role for &quot;Empire&quot; lasted three weeks. The actor was pleased with the costume and used it to convey the character&#x27;s menace. Bulloch based his performance on Clint Eastwood&#x27;s portrayal of the Man with No Name in &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot;; similar to the Western character, Bulloch cradled the blaster prop, made the character seem ready to shoot, slightly tilted his head, and stood a particular way. Bulloch did not try to construct a backstory for the character, and said later that &quot;the less you do with Boba Fett, the stronger he becomes&quot;. Playing Fett in &quot;Empire&quot; was both the smallest and most physically uncomfortable role Bulloch has played; Bulloch said donning the heavy jetpack was the worst aspect of the role.

Bulloch spent four weeks on &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. He was unaware of Fett&#x27;s demise before filming began and was &quot;very upset&quot; by the development; he would like to have done more with Fett. Still, Bulloch believed killing Fett made the character stronger, and that his &quot;weak&quot; death makes fans want the character to return. Bulloch thought a scene created for the 1997 Special Edition in which Fett flirts with one of Jabba the Hutt&#x27;s dancers was not in keeping with the character&#x27;s nature.

A younger version of the character was played by Daniel Logan in &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot;, which establishes that Boba is a clone of his father, Jango. Logan had not seen any of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films before being cast as Fett, but he watched the original trilogy at Lucas&#x27; request. The actor had to rely on his imagination for the bluescreen filming. Both Bulloch and Logan had also expressed interest in reprising their role of Fett in the planned &quot;Underworld&quot; TV series, but the series remains undeveloped.

====Other portrayals====
According to the official &quot;Star Wars&quot; website, Fett was voiced by Don Francks in the &quot;Holiday Special&quot;. Bulloch wore Fett&#x27;s costume in &quot;Empire&quot; and &quot;Jedi&quot;, but John Morton filled in during one scene for &quot;Empire&quot;, and Jason Wingreen voiced the character in &quot;Empire&quot;. His brief appearance in the Special Edition of the original film, &quot;Episode IV&quot;&quot;A New Hope&quot;, was performed by Industrial Light &amp; Magic creature animator Mark Austin. The character&#x27;s appearance in the Special Edition footage of &quot;Jedi&quot; was performed by Don Bies and Nelson Hall. For the 2004 rereleases, Temuera Morrison replaced the character&#x27;s original voice for continuity with &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot;, in which Morrison portrays Jango Fett.

The character&#x27;s voice in National Public Radio&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars&quot; radio dramas was provided by Alan Rosenberg in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; and Ed Begley Jr. in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, Tim Glovatsky in the audio adaptation of &quot;Dark Forces: Rebel Agent&quot;, Joe Hacker in an audio adaptation of the &quot;Dark Empire&quot; comics, Temuera Morrison for &quot;Empire at War&quot;, &quot;Battlefront II&quot; and &quot;Battlefront: Elite Squadron&quot;, Dee Bradley Baker in &quot;The Force Unleashed&quot;, &quot;The Force Unleashed II&quot; and &quot;Star Tours: The Adventures Continue&quot;, Chris Cox in &quot;Rogue Squadron III: Rebel Strike&quot;, Tom Kane in &quot;Galactic Battlegrounds&quot;, &quot;Demolition&quot; and &quot;Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy&quot;, and Daniel Logan for &quot;The Clone Wars&quot; animated TV series and &quot;Lego Star Wars: The Video Game&quot;.

The first live-action depiction of Fett outside the theatrical films was in the second season of the original Disney+ series &quot;The Mandalorian&quot;, wherein Morrison reprised the role.

The character also made a cameo appearance in a live-action mockumentary filmed on the set of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; titled &quot;Return of the Ewok&quot; (1982). Post-production was never completed, and it has never been officially released.

==Appearances==
The character of Boba Fett made his first public appearance at the San Anselmo Country Fair parade on 24 September 1978. In the parade, the Boba Fett costume was worn by Duwayne Dunham, who was working at the time as an assistant film editor before later becoming a film and television director. The character debuted on television two months later in an animated segment produced by Toronto-based animation firm Nelvana Productions for the &quot;Star Wars Holiday Special&quot;. Fett appears as a mysterious figure who saves Luke Skywalker, Chewbacca, C-3PO, and R2-D2 from a giant monster, only to be revealed as a bounty hunter working for Darth Vader. After his image and identity were revealed in the &quot;Holiday Special&quot;, costumed Fett characters appeared in shopping malls and special events, putting up wanted posters of the character to distinguish him from the franchise&#x27;s Imperial characters.

===Skywalker saga===
====Original trilogy====

Fett&#x27;s theatrical film debut was as an unnamed bounty hunter in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; as the &quot;next major villain&quot; beside Darth Vader. He is one of six bounty hunters assembled by Darth Vader, who promises a reward to whoever captures the crew of the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot;. Fett tracks the starship to Cloud City, where Vader captures its passengers and tortures its captain, Han Solo. Aiming to collect the bounty Jabba the Hutt has placed on Solo (established in the original film), Fett questions Vader regarding the carbon freeze, which Vader intends to use on his true target, Luke Skywalker. Vader promises that the Empire will compensate Fett if Solo dies, but the smuggler survives and Vader turns him over to Fett, who leaves to deliver him to Jabba in his ship, the &quot;Slave I&quot;.

&quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; features Boba Fett at Jabba&#x27;s palace on Tatooine, where Han Solo&#x27;s friends are captured while trying to save him. Fett aims his weapon at Princess Leia (disguised as bounty hunter Boushh) when she threatens Jabba with a thermal detonator, and he later travels on Jabba&#x27;s sail barge to the Great Pit of Carkoon (home of a sessile carnivorous creature known as a sarlacc) to witness the prisoners&#x27; execution. When the prisoners revolt and fight back, Fett flies over and briefly fights Luke. Chewbacca later warns Solo, who is still blind after being frozen in carbonite, that Fett is near. As Solo turns around, he inadvertently hits Fett&#x27;s rocket pack, setting it off and propelling Fett into the side of the sail barge, from which he falls into the sarlacc&#x27;s mouth. The 1997 Special Edition release of the film includes an additional scene of Fett flirting with some of Jabba&#x27;s female dancers.

In the 1997 Special Edition of &quot;A New Hope&quot;, Fett briefly appears in a reintroduced cut scene outside the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot; while Jabba confronts Han Solo. The character had yet to be created during the filming of the scene and was thus superimposed onto the image.

====Prequel trilogy====

A preteen Boba Fett (played by Daniel Logan) appears in the 2002 prequel film &quot;Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot;, which reveals that he is an unaltered clone of the bounty hunter Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison), who had him created on Kamino to be raised as his son as part of his price to serve as the template for the Grand Army of the Republic&#x27;s clone army. Boba helps Jango escape from Obi-Wan Kenobi and accompanies him to Geonosis, where he witnesses Jango&#x27;s death by beheading at the hands of Mace Windu during the first battle in the Clone Wars. After the battle ends, he is last seen mourning over his father&#x27;s helmet, which he takes and places in front of his head, foreshadowing his future as a bounty hunter wearing his father&#x27;s armor.

===Television===

====&quot;The Story of the Faithful Wookiee&quot;====

Boba Fett appeared in the animated segment of the non-canon 1978 Holiday Special, set after the events of &quot;A New Hope&quot;. This marks his first appearance in the franchise. He is first seen when he rescues Luke Skywalker, C-3PO, and R2-D2 from a Panna dragon. Fett presents himself as an ally to the heroes but it is later revealed that he was working for Darth Vader the whole time - to reveal the location of the Rebels to the Empire. Fett ignites his jetpack before leaving and promising that they will meet again.

====&quot;Droids&quot;====
Boba Fett appeared in the canon 1985 animated series, &quot;Star Wars: Droids&quot;, set before the original trilogy. The series was produced by the same studio that created the animated segment of the 1978 &quot;Holiday Special&quot;, and Fett was again voiced by Don Francks (who had been uncredited for his original role in the &quot;Holiday Special&quot;). In the episode &quot;A Race to the Finish&quot;, he is hired by the Fromms to help them get revenge on the masters of the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO. Fett later turns on them after failing their request, and decides to accept Jabba&#x27;s bounty on the Fromms as compensation.

====&quot;The Clone Wars&quot;====
Logan reprised his role as the voice of Fett in the 2008 animated series &quot;The Clone Wars&quot;. The final three episodes of the second season of the series, entitled &quot;Death Trap&quot;, &quot;R2 Come Home&quot; and &quot;Lethal Trackdown&quot;, were aired on April 30, 2010, and attracted an average of 2.756 million viewers during the original broadcast. The finale is significant for ending &quot;with twin fandom bangs, courtesy of Boba Fett and a mammoth beast inspired by Godzilla&quot;. Fett&#x27;s entrance in the series commemorates the 30-year anniversary of the character&#x27;s appearance in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;.

In the story arc, Boba infiltrates Mace Windu&#x27;s flagship in the guise of a clone trooper cadet, hoping to exact revenge against the Jedi for killing his father. After a failed attempt to bomb Windu in his quarters, he sabotages the ship&#x27;s engines, causing it to crash on a nearby planet. He and his bounty hunter accomplices then take hostages from the ship&#x27;s crew, whom they try to use to bait the Jedi Master. Throughout the ordeal, Fett balks at committing violence against his fellow clones, which comes to a head when his mentor Aurra Sing executes Windu&#x27;s clone trooper second-in-command. Plo Koon and Ahsoka Tano eventually track Fett and his compatriots to pirate Hondo Ohnaka&#x27;s base. Fett is ultimately captured by the Jedi and sentenced to prison on Coruscant; although he expresses regret for the collateral damage he has caused, he vows to never forgive Windu.

Fett escapes prison in the fourth-season episode &quot;Deception&quot;. He later forms his bounty hunter syndicate, Krayt&#x27;s Claw, which includes Bossk and Dengar (both of whom first appeared in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; alongside Fett). In the episode &quot;Bounty&quot;, Krayt&#x27;s Claw is hired to deliver a package to a dictator. When the bounty hunters discover that their cargo is a young woman destined for a forced marriage to the despot, Fett is indifferent to her plight and insists the team proceed with their mission. Temporary member Asajj Ventress, enraged, turns on Fett; she strangles him with the Force, binds, and gags him, and shoves him into the container in the captive&#x27;s place, whereupon he is delivered to the nonplussed client.

====&quot;The Mandalorian&quot;====
Boba Fett&#x27;s presence in the original Disney+ series &quot;The Mandalorian&quot; was first hinted at in the first-season episode &quot;Chapter 5: The Gunslinger&quot;, which ends with a mysterious figure wearing boots and seemingly a cape approaching the body of assassin Fennec Shand on Tatooine.
In June 2020, it was reported that Temuera Morrison would appear as Fett in the second season of &quot;The Mandalorian&quot;. As the series takes place five years following &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, this would confirm the character&#x27;s survival after his fall into the sarlacc&#x27;s mouth and retcon his apparent death. In the second season&#x27;s premiere, &quot;Chapter 9: The Marshal&quot;, it is explained that Fett&#x27;s armor was salvaged by Jawas after his supposed death, and then bought by Cobb Vanth, a character first introduced in the &quot;Star Wars: Aftermath&quot; trilogy of novels, who used it to protect the Tatooinian village of Mos Pelgo from various threats. In the episode, the armor is eventually obtained by the Mandalorian after Vanth relinquishes it so that it could be returned to its rightful owners: the Mandalorian people. As he leaves with the armor, the Mandalorian is watched from the distance by a heavily scarred Fett.

Fett&#x27;s first full appearance in the series occurred in the episode &quot;Chapter 14: The Tragedy&quot;, in which it is explained that he saved Fennec&#x27;s life after she was mortally wounded, leaving her in his debt and that he is looking to retrieve his armor from the Mandalorian. Fett and Fennec follow him in the &quot;Slave I&quot; to the planet Tython, where the former explains that his armor belonged to his late father Jango, a Mandalorian foundling, and is, thus, Fett&#x27;s birthright. In exchange for the armor&#x27;s return, Fett and Fennec ensure the safety of Grogu, an alien infant the Mandalorian has adopted. When Moff Gideon&#x27;s Imperial forces attack the group, Fett dons his old armor and kills most of the stormtroopers deployed to capture Grogu with a gaffi stick. Despite this, the child is ultimately taken by Gideon&#x27;s Dark Troopers. Fett insists that he and Fennec shall remain indebted to the Mandalorian until Grogu is safe, and they subsequently aid his efforts to rescue the child in &quot;Chapter 15: The Believer&quot; and &quot;Chapter 16: The Rescue&quot;, which show Fett in a now clean and repainted armor.

In the latter episode, Fett is initially at odds with Bo-Katan Kryze, the former ruler of Mandalore and one of the allies that the Mandalorian tries to recruit to help save Grogu because she calls him a disgrace to his Mandalorian armor due to his origins as a clone. Despite this, the two reluctantly work together to rescue the child from Moff Gideon, with Fett creating a distraction that allows the rest of the crew to board Gideon&#x27;s ship. After this, Fett flies into hyperspace and is not seen again until a post-credits scene, in which he and Fennec return to Tatooine after their debt is paid off. Fett kills Bib Fortuna, who has been in charge of Jabba&#x27;s palace since his death, and then sits on the throne that once belonged to Jabba, with Fennec at his side.

====&quot;The Bad Batch&quot;====
Boba Fett is mentioned in &quot;Star Wars: The Bad Batch,&quot; a CGI-animated sequel and spin-off from &quot;The Clone Wars&quot; which premiered in 2021. The episode &quot;Bounty Lost&quot; reveals that Boba&#x27;s original code name is Alpha, and that Omega, an enhanced female clone who joined Clone Force 99 after the rise of the Empire, is a second unaltered replication of Jango and, therefore, Boba&#x27;s sister. The episode &quot;Plan 99&quot; reveals that Emerie Karr is another female clone, therefore, another sister of his. Both are from the first batch of clones making them the same age.

====&quot;Visions&quot;====
Boba Fett appears in the 2021 anime series &quot;Star Wars: Visions&quot;, voiced by Temuera Morrison in English and by Akio Kaneda in Japanese. He appears in the second episode, &quot;Tatooine Rhapsody&quot;.

====&quot;The Book of Boba Fett&quot;====

&quot;The Book of Boba Fett&quot; is a spin-off of &quot;The Mandalorian&quot; focused on Boba Fett, which premiered on Disney+ on December 29, 2021. Morrison and Ming-Na Wen reprised their roles as Fett and Fennec Shand, respectively, with Finnegan Garay portraying a young Fett with Daniel Logan&#x27;s likeness superimposed over his own. The first trailer was released November 1, 2021. In &quot;The Book of Boba Fett&quot;, Boba Fett and his partner, Fennec Shand, begin rebuilding the old criminal empire of Jabba the Hutt on Tatooine. The series was controversial among Star Wars fans for its weakening of the villainous aspects of the bounty hunter.

===Other media===
In the first issue of Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;Darth Vader&quot; (2015), the title character hires Boba Fett to capture the pilot who destroyed the Death Star. In the concurrent &quot;Star Wars&quot; comic (2015), Fett tracks the pilot, Luke Skywalker, to Tatooine, although the latter escapes after a brief fight. Fett then tells Vader the pilot&#x27;s surname, unknowingly informing the Sith lord (formerly Anakin Skywalker) that he has a son. Fett also features in Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Bounty Hunters&quot; (2020), which is set between &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. The comic miniseries &quot;War of the Bounty Hunters&quot; (2021) is set in the same era, and will be preceded by standalone comics including tie-ins with &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Bounty Hunters&quot;, &quot;Darth Vader&quot;, and &quot;Doctor Aphra&quot;.

Fett appears as a playable character in &quot;Star Wars Battlefront&quot; (2015) and &quot;Star Wars Battlefront II&quot; (2017), as well as several &quot;Star Wars&quot; video games for mobile devices.

On December 24, 2021, Fett was added as a wearable cosmetic for Fortnite Battle Royale.

On February 4, 2022, Indy Stevenson posted a &quot;The Book of Boba Fett&quot; comic entitled &quot;This Place Was Home&quot; on Twitter to a universally positive critical reception.The comic focused on &quot;Boba&#x27;s childhood relationship with [Zam] Wesell&quot;, a mother figure to him.

Fett makes a cameo appearance in &quot;Star Wars Jedi: Survivor&quot; (2023), with Temuera Morrison reprising his role. He appears as part of a side quest in which Cal Kestis fights and defeats bounty hunter Caij Vanda. Fett appears at the end of the fight to collect the bounty on Vanda, with Cal allowing it to happen.

===&quot;Legends&quot;===
The character appears extensively in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; Expanded Universe of novels, comic books, and video games, dating to as early as the newspaper comic strip and Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars&quot; series (produced concurrently to the original film trilogy). In April 2014, such works were rebranded by Lucasfilm as &quot;Star Wars Legends&quot; and declared non-canon to the rest of the franchise to create a blank slate for the sequel trilogy.

Boba Fett appears in many other works set during the original trilogy, including the choose-your-own-adventure book &quot;The Bounty Hunter&quot; (1994), the 1996 &quot;Shadows of the Empire&quot; multimedia project, Dark Horse&#x27;s short comic &quot;Boba Fett: Salvage&quot; (1997), volumes of the young-reader series &quot;Galaxy of Fear&quot; (1997–1998), &quot;The Bounty Hunter Wars&quot; book trilogy (1998–1999), issues of &quot;Empire&quot; (2002–2005) and &quot;Star Wars&quot; (2013–14), and the one-shot comic &quot;Boba Fett: Overkill&quot; (2006). Fett appears in the years leading up to &quot;A New Hope&quot; in the comic &quot;Boba Fett: Enemy of the Empire&quot; (1999), in which Vader hires Fett before trying to kill him, as well as &quot;Agent of the Empire&quot; (2012–2013), &quot;Blood Ties&quot; (2010–2012), and &quot;Underworld: The Yavin Vassilika&quot; (2000–2001).

A 1983 issue of the original Marvel &quot;Star Wars&quot; comic book set just after &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; depicts Fett temporarily escaping the sarlacc pit. Works such as Dark Horse&#x27;s &quot;Dark Empire&quot; series (1991–1992) further utilized Fett&#x27;s survival. A 1995 anthology story by Daniel Keys Moran narrates some of his time in the sarlacc, and a 1996 story by Dave Wolverton narrates how Dengar finds him and restores him to health. In the comic &quot;Boba Fett: Twin Engines of Destruction&quot; (1997), while Fett recovers after being freed from the sarlaac, he is impersonated by a bounty hunter named Jodo Kast, whom Fett then hunts. Four &quot;Boba Fett&quot; comics set several years after &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; were released between 1995 and 2000. Fett encounters Han Solo in the short story &quot;The Last One Standing: The Tale of Boba Fett&quot; (1996), set 15 years after the events of the same film, and fights side by side with him in &quot;The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force&quot; (2003), set a decade later. He also appears in the e-novella &quot;Boba Fett: A Practical Man&quot;, set 20 years after &quot;Jedi&quot;. In the &quot;Legacy of the Force&quot; series (2006–2008), set some 35 years after &quot;Jedi&quot;, Han and Leia&#x27;s daughter, Jaina, asks Fett to train her to help her defeat her corrupted brother, Jacen.

In &quot;The Last One Standing&quot;, Daniel Keys Moran developed a backstory for Fett in which he was once named Jaster Mereel, a &quot;Journeyman Protector&quot; lawman who was convicted of treason. His backstory was depicted differently in &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot;, leading to the Dark Horse comic &quot;Jango Fett: Open Seasons&quot; (2003) retconning Mereel to Jango&#x27;s mentor. A young-adult book series called &quot;Boba Fett&quot; (2002–2004) depicts Fett&#x27;s roots as a bounty hunter during the Clone Wars. He is guided by a book left to him by his father, whose ship and armor he has inherited, and begins working for Jabba the Hutt.

====&quot;The Bounty Hunter Wars&quot;====
The Bounty Hunter Wars is a trilogy of novels by K. W. Jeter set during the events of the original trilogy. The books were published by Bantam Spectra in July 1998, November 1998, and July 1999, respectively. The trilogy depicts Fett as being more communicative than in the films because its plot requires Fett to show &quot;an ability to convince people as well as kill them&quot;.

The first book, The Mandalorian Armor, starts during the events of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, shortly after Jabba&#x27;s sail barge is destroyed. Dengar stays with Fett after the latter&#x27;s near-death experience and encounters Neelah, a dancer in Jabba&#x27;s palace who has lost her memory, and thinks Fett can help her. Kuat of Kuat, an Imperial executive, reviews footage from the Great Pit of Carkoon, leading him to suspect that Fett is still alive. It is related in flashbacks set between &quot;A New Hope&quot; and &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; that Fett stole a bounty Bossk and Zuckuss was hunting on behalf of the Bounty Hunters Guild. After delivering the bounty, Fett accepted a contract to join the Bounty Hunters Guild to break it up. The Emperor met with Darth Vader and Prince Xizor, where the latter revealed that it was he who planned for Fett to join the guild to eliminate its weakest members, leaving only the best for the Empire to exploit.

In the second book, , Fett abandons &quot;Slave I&quot; to avoid dispelling rumors of his death, and instead steals Bossk&#x27;s ship. Riding along, Dengar tells Neelah about the split of the Bounty Hunters Guild. After Bossk killed his father, the guild split into two factions: one composed of the older members, and another composed of Bossk and other younger members. Prince Xizor placed an enormous bounty on a renegade stormtrooper who slaughtered his entire ship&#x27;s crew. Fett, Bossk, and Zuckuss captured the trooper, but Fett jettisoned his partners in an escape pod.

In the third and final book, , it is related that Fett tried to claim his bounty, but found Xizor waiting to kill him to tie up loose ends related to his plot. In an attack on the megalomaniacal prince, Kuat of Kuat had falsified some evidence implicating him in the murder of Luke Skywalker&#x27;s aunt and uncle. This information was on the renegade stormtrooper&#x27;s ship (which is why Kuat wanted to make sure the bounty hunter was dead) but is retrieved by Fett in the present, as Neelah realizes she is from an elite Kuat family and stops her sinister sister from taking over the now-suicidal Imperial executive&#x27;s shipyard.

====&quot;Boba Fett: A Practical Man&quot;====
Boba Fett: A Practical Man is an e-novella by Karen Traviss, which was published online in August 2006 by Del Rey Books. Set 20 years after the events of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, it focuses on what led Boba Fett and the Mandalorians to fend off the extragalactic Yuuzhan Vong invaders in &quot;The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force&quot; (set a few months later).
A Yuuzhan Vong named Nom Anor meets Fett on Mandalore and begins giving him and the Mandalorians directions to help their invasion. Fett plans to do as much damage to the invaders as possible, even as he pretends to help them. He instructs a pilot to deliver his plea for help to the New Republic, but with the Vong&#x27;s next target still unwarned, the world falls without a fight.
A Vong warrior asks Fett to assist in killing a Jedi; instead, Fett convinces the Jedi to deliver his message.
The Jedi returns and confirms that Fett has a deal: the Mandalorians will continue to masquerade as Vong mercenaries while passing intel to the Republic. Fett agrees to have a few of his best commandos train planetary militias to fight the Vong.

===Unproduced works===
A planned live-action TV series developed by &quot;Star Wars&quot; creator George Lucas before the sale of Lucasfilm to Disney, under the working title &quot;Star Wars: Underworld&quot;, would have featured Fett.

====&quot;Star Wars 1313&quot;====
The canceled LucasArts video game &quot;Star Wars 1313&quot;, announced at E3 2012, would have told the story of Boba Fett&#x27;s career as a young adult bounty hunter between the prequel and original trilogies. Fett would have navigated past the scum of civilization in an underground area of Coruscant known as Level 1313. In 2013, as a result of Disney&#x27;s acquisition of the franchise, all LucasArts projects then in production were shelved. In a December 2015 interview, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy stated that the concept art for the game was &quot;unbelievable&quot; and that, along with &quot;Underworld&quot;, it was &quot;something we&#x27;re spending a lot of time looking at, poring through, discussing, and we may very well develop those things further&quot;.

&quot;Level 1313&quot; appears in &quot;Star Wars&quot; media such as &quot;The Clone Wars&quot;, in which it is visited by Ahsoka Tano, and &quot;Star Wars Adventures: Return to Vader&#x27;s Castle&quot;.

====&quot;The Clone Wars&quot; episodes====
Fett was to have appeared in more episodes of &quot;The Clone Wars&quot; before its cancellation. A series of Western-inspired episodes would have featured Fett teaming up with Cad Bane to rescue a child kidnapped by Tusken Raiders on Tatooine; Aurra Sing would have appeared as well. The story arc would have depicted Fett donning his Mandalorian armor for the first time, and ended with Bane blasting Fett in the head, creating the iconic dent in his helmet (an idea which came from George Lucas). Animatic footage of the climactic scene was shown at &quot;Star Wars&quot; Celebration.

====Standalone film====
In early 2013, Disney CEO Bob Iger announced the development of a &quot;Star Wars&quot; spin-off film written by Simon Kinberg, which &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reported would focus on Boba Fett during the original trilogy. In mid-2014, Josh Trank was officially announced as the director of an undisclosed spin-off film, but had left the project a year later due to creative differences with Kinberg, causing a teaser for the Fett film to be scrapped from &quot;Star Wars&quot; Celebration. In May 2018, it was reported that James Mangold had signed on to write and direct a Fett film, with Kinberg attached as producer and , but both Mangold and Kathleen Kennedy subsequently denied Mangold&#x27;s involvement. In July, Daniel Keys Moran stated that Lucasfilm had considered adapting &quot;The Last One Standing&quot; into a film. By October, the Fett film was reportedly dead, with the studio instead focusing on &quot;The Mandalorian&quot;. The Fett film was afterwards reported to have also featured the other bounty hunters from &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;.

==Reception==
Boba Fett is a &quot;cult figure&quot; and one of the most popular &quot;Star Wars&quot; characters. In 2008, Boba Fett was selected by &quot;Empire&quot; magazine as the 79th greatest movie character of all time, and he is included on &quot;Fandomania&quot;″s list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Fictional Characters&quot;. IGN ranked Boba Fett as the eighth top &quot;Star Wars&quot; character, due to his status as a fan-favourite and cult following. He personifies &quot;danger and mystery&quot;, and Susan Mayse calls Fett &quot;the unknowable &quot;Star Wars&quot; character&quot; who &quot;delivers mythic presence.&quot; Although Tom Bissell asserts that no one knows why Boba Fett has become so popular, nor cares why, both Lucas and Bulloch cite Fett&#x27;s mysterious nature as reasons for his popularity. Bulloch, who has never fully understood the character&#x27;s popularity, attributes it to the costume and the respect Fett garners from Darth Vader and Jabba the Hutt. Fett&#x27;s addition to the Special Edition of &quot;A New Hope&quot; was criticized by &quot;Screen Rant&quot;, which called it &quot;pointless fan service&quot;.

The initial Boba Fett toy, more than Fett&#x27;s actual film appearance, might be responsible for the character&#x27;s popularity; Henry Jenkins suggests children&#x27;s play helped the character &quot;take on a life of its own&quot;. Moran said Vader&#x27;s admonition specifically to Fett in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;—&quot;No disintegrations&quot;—gives Fett credibility; he was interested in Fett because the character is &quot;strong, silent, [and] brutal&quot;. Jeter says that even when Fett appears passive, he conveys &quot;capability and ruthlessness&quot;. Bissell credits Bulloch for giving Fett &quot;effortless authority&quot; in his first scene in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, using such nuances as cradling his blaster and slightly cocking his head. Fett&#x27;s small role in the film may have made the character seem more intriguing. Logan, who was a Young Artist Award nominee for his portrayal of Fett, compares Fett to &quot;that boy in school who never talks&quot; and who attracts others&#x27; curiosity.

Bissell adds that Boba Fett, along with other minor characters like Darth Maul and Kyle Katarn, appeals to adolescent boys&#x27; &quot;images of themselves: essentially bad-ass but ... honorable about it.&quot; This tension and the absence of a clear &quot;evil nature&quot; (distinct from evil actions) offer Fett dramatic appeal. Furthermore, Fett &quot;is cool because he was designed to be cool&quot;, presenting a &quot;wicked ambiguity&quot; akin to John Milton&#x27;s portrayal of Satan in &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; and Iago in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot;. Bissell compares Fett to Beowulf, Ahab, and Huckleberry Finn: characters &quot;too &quot;big&quot;&quot; for their original presentation, and apt for continued development in other stories. Moran finds Fett reminiscent of the Man with No Name.

Fett has been featured extensively in pop culture and parodies. Breckin Meyer provides his voice in various &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; sketches. Nerdcore rapper MC Chris included a &quot;Star Wars&quot;-themed song titled &quot;Fett&#x27;s Vette&quot; on his 2001 debut album. The creator of the Spartan helmets for the 2006 film &quot;300&quot; painted one of them to look like Fett&#x27;s helmet.
The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; describes Boba Fett fans as &quot;among the most passionate&quot;, and the character is important to &quot;Star Wars&quot; fan culture. Boba Fett&#x27;s popular following before the character even appeared in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; influenced Damon Lindelof&#x27;s interest in developing &quot;Lost&quot; across multiple media. Between filming &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, Mark Hamill pitched the idea that Fett was Luke Skywalker&#x27;s mother to George Lucas, which &quot;he didn&#x27;t like&quot;. In about 2000, a feminist campaigned online to have the character unmasked as a woman. Fan parodies include Boba Phat, a cosplay &quot;intergalactic booty hunter&quot; created by David James.

===In &quot;The Clone Wars&quot;===

IGN reviewer Eric Goldman rated the first episode 8.2/10 and the second 8.8/10, stating &quot;this was a very layered, exciting episode to end Season 2 on&quot;, though he did not appreciate Boba Fett&#x27;s limited dialogue. Bryan Young, a writer for &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; and Examiner.com, also disliked Fett&#x27;s responses at the end of the episode when confronting Mace Windu: &quot;He says something incredibly whiny.&quot; Young does state, however, that &quot;[o]verall, this pair of episodes was a satisfying conclusion to season two, which really upped the game in this series in terms of animation, storytelling, and suspense.&quot; GalacticBinder.com&#x27;s reviewer Chris Smith wrote, &quot;Lucasfilm delivers another exciting episode to finish off a tremendous second season.&quot; Adam Rosenberg writing in MTV Movies Blog discusses Boba Fett&#x27;s return: &quot;He&#x27;s going to have to be put through a lot more hell before he embraces his inner badass. I&#x27;ll say though... he&#x27;s off to a mighty good start with the dual blasters he wears on his belt. Sure, they&#x27;re almost the size of his thighs, but hey... he&#x27;s still just a kid.&quot;

===In &quot;The Book of Boba Fett&quot;===
Boba Fett&#x27;s character in the series has received mixed reviews, while Morrison&#x27;s portrayal of Fett has been praised. Some have said that, without Morrison portraying Boba Fett, the series might have been a total disaster and that he is the only face that could have brought Fett back to life. &quot;Decider&quot;″s Megan O&#x27;Keefe wrote, &quot;Boba Fett is the least interesting character in &quot;The Book of Boba Fett&quot;.&quot; Rich Knight from &quot;CinemaBlend&quot; stated that he used to not like Fett, but became interested in his character as he was the only one in the series who &quot;seems like an actual human being&quot;. Chris Edwards of &quot;The Guardian&quot; said that Disney+ ruined one of the &quot;coolest and most mysterious characters&quot; in &quot;Star Wars&quot;.

===Merchandising===
Fett is one of the top five best-selling &quot;Star Wars&quot; action figures, and Boba Fett-related products are &quot;among the most expensive&quot; &quot;Star Wars&quot; merchandise. Fett was the first new mail-away action figure created for &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;; although advertised as having a rocket-firing backpack, safety concerns led Kenner to sell his rocket attached. Gray called the early toy &quot;a rare and precious commodity&quot;, and one of the rocket-firing prototypes sold at auction for $16,000 in 2003. In 2018 and 2019, two of the prototypes were sold at auction, for £69,000 ($USD92,000) and £90,000 ($USD120,000), respectively—each setting the world record for the highest auction price of a &quot;Star Wars&quot; toy at that time. A fully painted figure with a rare variant on the firing mechanism is planned to be auctioned and estimated to be worth $200,000. In 2024, one of the only two existing hand painted missile firing bounty hunter Boba Fett action figures was sold for record breaking $525,000 at Heritage Auctions.

In August 2009, Hasbro released a Fett action figure based on McQuarrie&#x27;s white-armored concept, and Boba Fett as both a child and bounty hunter have been made into Lego minifigures and a helmet statue of Fett in his armor. Wizards of the Coast&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars Trading Card Game&quot; includes several Boba Fett cards. Hallmark Cards created a Boba Fett Christmas tree ornament.
In January 2015, an unopened Boba Fett figure sold for £18,000 at auction in the UK, the figure was in factory-fresh condition and did not have the packaging punched for hanging in a shop.

In mid-2021, Lego released a &quot;Slave I&quot; set, replacing the ship&#x27;s name with &quot;Boba Fett&#x27;s Starship&quot;. According to the design director of Lego &quot;Star Wars&quot;, the &quot;Slave I&quot; name &quot;is just something that Disney doesn&#x27;t want to use anymore&quot;. This prompted some backlash from fans, including Mark Austin, who portrays Fett in the Special Edition of &quot;A New Hope&quot;. While the ship was not canonically renamed, Disney is likely merely avoiding slavery-related terms in merchandise. In a press release for variant covers for Marvel&#x27;s &quot;War of the Bounty Hunters&quot;, the ship is referred to as &quot;Firespray&quot;, a reference to the ship&#x27;s fictional class.

<text>Māori (; endonym: &#x27; &#x27;the Māori language&#x27;, commonly shortened to &#x27;) is an Eastern Polynesian language and the language of the Māori people, the indigenous population of mainland New Zealand. The southernmost member of the Austronesian language family, it is related to Cook Islands Māori, Tuamotuan, and Tahitian. The Māori Language Act 1987 gave the language recognition as one of New Zealand&#x27;s official languages. There are regional dialects of the Māori language.
Prior to contact with Europeans, Māori lacked a written language or script. Written Māori now uses the Latin script, which was adopted and the spelling standardised by Northern Māori in collaboration with English Protestant clergy in the 19th century.

In the second half of the 19th century, European children in rural areas spoke Māori with Māori children. It was common for prominent parents of these children, such as government officials, to use Māori in the community. Māori declined due to the increase of the European population and government-imposed educational policies; by the early 20th century its use was banned in school playgrounds and classrooms across the country. The number of speakers fell sharply after 1945, but a Māori language revival movement began in the late 20th century and slowed the decline. The Māori protest movement and the Māori renaissance of the 1970s caused greater social awareness of and support for the language.

The 2018 New Zealand census reported that about 190,000 people, or 4% of the population, could hold an everyday conversation in Māori. , 55% of Māori adults reported some knowledge of the language; of these, 64% use Māori at home and around 50,000 people can speak the language &quot;well&quot;. As of 2023, around 7% of New Zealand primary and secondary school students are taught fully or partially in Māori, and another 24% learn Māori as an additional language.

In Māori culture, the language is considered to be among the greatest of all , or cultural treasures. Māori is known for its metaphorical poetry and prose, often in the form of , , and , and in performing arts such as , , and .

== Name ==
The English word &quot;Maori&quot; is a borrowing from the Māori language, where it is spelled . In New Zealand, the Māori language is often referred to as (&quot;the language&quot;), short for (&quot;the Māori language&quot;).

The Māori-language spelling (with a macron) has become common in New Zealand English in recent years, particularly in Māori-specific cultural contexts, although the traditional macron-less English spelling is still sometimes seen in general media and government use.

Preferred and alternative pronunciations in English vary by dictionary, with being most frequent today, and , , and also given, while the &#x27;r&#x27; is always a voiced alveolar flap.

== Official status ==

New Zealand has two &quot;de jure&quot; official languages: Māori and New Zealand Sign Language, whereas New Zealand English acts as a &quot;de facto&quot; official language. gained its official status with the passing of the Māori Language Act 1987.

Most government departments and agencies have bilingual names—for example, the Department of Internal Affairs is alternatively —and places such as local government offices and public libraries display bilingual signs and use bilingual stationery; some government services now even use the Māori version solely as the official name. Personal dealings with government agencies may be conducted in Māori, but in practice, this almost always requires interpreters, restricting its everyday use to the limited geographical areas of high Māori fluency, and to more formal occasions, such as during public consultation. An interpreter is on hand at sessions of the New Zealand Parliament for instances when a member wishes to speak in Māori. Māori may be spoken in judicial proceedings, but any party wishing to do so must notify the court in advance to ensure an interpreter is available. Failure to notify in advance does not preclude the party speaking in Māori, but the court must be adjourned until an interpreter is available and the party may be held liable for the costs of the delay.

A 1994 ruling by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (then New Zealand&#x27;s highest court) held the Government responsible under the Treaty of Waitangi (1840) for the preservation of the language. Accordingly, since March 2004, the state has funded Māori Television, broadcast partly in Māori. On 28 March 2008, Māori Television launched its second channel, , broadcast entirely in the Māori language, with no advertising or subtitles. The first Māori TV channel, Aotearoa Television Network (ATN) was available to viewers in the Auckland region from 1996 but lasted for only one year.

In 2008, Land Information New Zealand published the first list of official place names with macrons. Previous place name lists were derived from computer systems (usually mapping and geographic information systems) that could not handle macrons.

=== Political dimensions ===
The official status of Māori, and especially its use in official names and titles, is a political issue in New Zealand. In 2022 a 70,000 strong petition from Te Pāti Māori went to Parliament calling for New Zealand to be officially renamed Aotearoa, and was accepted for debate by the Māori Affairs select committee. During New Zealand First&#x27;s successful campaign to return to Parliament in 2023, party leader Winston Peters ridiculed the proposal as &quot;ideological mumbo jumbo&quot; and criticised the use of the name in government reports. Peters promised his party would remove Māori names from government departments, saying &quot;Te Whatu Ora, excuse me, I don&#x27;t want to speak the Māori language when I go to hospital.&quot; As part of its coalition agreement with New Zealand First, the National-led government agreed to ensure all public service departments had their primary name in English except for those specifically related to Māori.

== History ==
===Origins===

According to legend, Māori came to New Zealand from Hawaiki. Current anthropological thinking places their origin in eastern Polynesia, mostly likely from the Southern Cook or Society Islands region (see ), and says that they arrived by deliberate voyages in seagoing canoes, possibly double-hulled, and probably sail-rigged. These settlers probably arrived by AD 1350 at the latest. 

Māori evolved in isolation from other Polynesian languages. Six dialectal variations emerged among iwi due to geographical separation. The language had no written form, but historian Sarah J. K. Gallagher has argued that tā moko, the indigenous art of tattooing, is arguably &quot;a pre-European textual culture in New Zealand... as the Moko can be read, it can be accepted as a form of communication&quot;. The idea that tā moko is a written language of sorts has been discussed before.

Since its origin, the Māori language has been rich in metaphorical poetry and prose. Forms of this include karakia, whaikōrero, whakapapa and karanga, and in performing arts such as mōteatea, waiata and haka. Karakia are Māori incantations used to invoke spiritual guidance and protection, and are used before eating or gathering, to increase spiritual goodwill and to declare things officially open. Whaikōrero is the term given to traditional oratory given on marae, and whakapapa is the story of one&#x27;s ancestry. According to historian Atholl Anderson, whakapapa used &quot;mnemonic devices, repetitive patterns [and] rhyme&quot; to leave a lasting impression. &quot;Casting knowledge in formulaic or other standarised story forms.. helped to fix the information in the minds of speakers and listeners&quot;.

=== European contact ===
Through the nineteenth century, the Māori language had a tumultuous history. It started this period as the predominant language of New Zealand, and it was adopted by European traders and missionaries for their purposes. 

Missionaries learned to speak Māori, and introduced the Latin alphabet to Māori. The Church Mission Society (CMS), including Thomas Kendall; Māori, including Tītore and Hongi Hika; and Cambridge University&#x27;s Samuel Lee, developed the written form of the language between 1817 and 1830. In 1833, while living in the Paihia mission-house of Anglican priest and the now head of the New Zealand CMS mission, Rev Henry Williams, missioner William Colenso published Māori translations including parts of books of the Bible, the first books printed in New Zealand. Colenso&#x27;s 1837 Māori New Testament was the first indigenous-language translation of the Bible published in the southern hemisphere. Demand for the Māori New Testament, and for the Prayer Book that followed, grew exponentially, as did Christian Māori leadership and public Christian services, with 33,000 Māori soon attending regularly. Literacy and understanding the Bible increased and social and economic benefits. Worship took place in Māori; it functioned as the language of Māori homes; Māori politicians conducted political meetings in Māori; and some literature appeared in Māori, along with many newspapers. Before 1880, some Māori parliamentarians suffered disadvantages because parliamentary proceedings took place in English. However, by 1900, all Māori members of parliament, such as Āpirana Ngata, were university graduates who spoke fluent English.

=== Suppression and decline ===
As early as 1847, English was set as the predominant language of schooling by the Education Ordinance Act; individual schools began to ban the use of Māori, though this was not yet a nationwide policy. The Native Schools Act 1867 established a schooling system for Māori children, who were to be taught in English whenever possible. This was followed in 1880 by the Native Schools Code, which placed further restrictions on the use of Māori, establishing the expectation that teachers would have some knowledge of the language solely for the purpose of teaching English to younger pupils. Further restrictions on Māori followed, to the point that in the early twentieth century, children were forbidden to speak it in the classroom or playground, under penalty of corporal punishment. In recent years, prominent Māori have spoken with sadness about their experiences or experiences of their family members being caned, strapped or beaten in school.

In many cases these policies were accepted or even encouraged by parents who wanted their children to succeed in the Pākehā world around them; however, it remained government policy to educate Māori in manual trades rather than academic professions until the mid-twentieth century. Proposals in 1930 to introduce Māori to the curriculum were blocked on the grounds that the purpose of education was to &quot;lead the Māori lad to be a good farmer and the Māori girl to be a good farmer&#x27;s wife&quot;.

Most Māori people continued to speak Māori as their first language until World War II. The number of speakers of Māori began to decline rapidly with the migration of Māori to urban areas after the war (the urban Māori). By the 1980s, fewer than 20 per cent of Māori spoke the language well enough to be classed as native speakers. Even many of those people no longer spoke Māori in their homes. As a result, many Māori children failed to learn their ancestral language, and generations of non-Māori-speaking Māori emerged.

In 1984, Naida Glavish, a tolls operator, was demoted for using the Māori greeting &quot;&quot; with customers. The &quot;Kia Ora Incident&quot; was the subject of public and political scrutiny before having her job reinstated by Prime Minister Robert Muldoon, and became a major symbol of long-standing linguicism in New Zealand.

=== Revitalisation efforts ===
By the 1950s some Māori leaders had begun to recognise the dangers of the loss of . By the 1970s there were many strategies used to save the language. This included Māori-language revitalization programs such as the Kōhanga Reo movement, which from 1982 immersed infants in Māori from infancy to school age. There followed in 1985 the founding of the first Kura Kaupapa Māori (Years 1 to 8 Māori-medium education programme) and later the first Wharekura (Years 9 to 13 Māori-medium education programme). In 2011 it was reported that although &quot;there was a true revival of te reo in the 1980s and early to mid-1990s ... spurred on by the realisation of how few speakers were left, and by the relative abundance of older fluent speakers in both urban neighbourhoods and rural communities&quot;, the language has continued to decline.&quot; The decline is believed &quot;to have several underlying causes&quot;. These include:

* the ongoing loss of older native speakers who have spearheaded the Māori-language revival movement
* complacency brought about by the very existence of the institutions which drove the revival
* concerns about quality, with the supply of good teachers never matching demand (even while that demand has been shrinking)
* excessive regulation and centralised control, which has alienated some of those involved in the movement
* an ongoing lack of educational resources needed to teach the full curriculum in 
* natural language attrition caused by the overwhelming increase of spoken English.

Based on the principles of partnership, Māori-speaking government, general revitalisation and dialectal protective policy, and adequate resourcing, the Waitangi Tribunal has recommended &quot;four fundamental changes&quot;:

# Te Taura Whiri (the Māori Language Commission) should become the lead Māori language sector agency. This will address the problems caused by the lack of ownership and leadership identified by the Office of the Auditor-General.
# Te Taura Whiri should function as a Crown–Māori partnership through the equal appointment of Crown and Māori appointees to its board. This reflects [the Tribunal&#x27;s] concern that te reo revival will not work if responsibility for setting the direction is not shared with Māori.
# Te Taura Whiri will also need increased powers. This will ensure that public bodies are compelled to contribute to &#x27;s revival and that key agencies are held properly accountable for the strategies they adopt. For instance, targets for the training of te reo teachers must be met, education curricula involving te reo must be approved, and public bodies in districts with a sufficient number and/or proportion of &quot;te reo&quot; speakers and schools with a certain proportion of Māori students must submit Māori language plans for approval.
# These regional public bodies and schools must also consult iwi (Māori tribes or tribal confederations) in the preparation of their plans. In this way, iwi will come to have a central role in the revitalisation of &quot;te reo&quot; in their own areas. This should encourage efforts to promote the language at the grassroots.
The changes set forth by the Tribunal are merely recommendations; they are not binding upon government.

There is, however, evidence that the revitalisation efforts are taking hold, as can be seen in the teaching of in the school curriculum, the use of Māori as an instructional language, and the supportive ideologies surrounding these efforts. In 2014, a survey of students ranging in age from 18 to 24 was conducted; the students were of mixed ethnic backgrounds, ranging from to Māori who lived in New Zealand. This survey showed a 62% response saying that was at risk. Albury argues that these results come from the language either not being used enough in common discourse, or from the fact that the number of speakers was inadequate for future language development.

The policies for language revitalisation have been changing in attempts to improve Māori language use and have been working with suggestions from the Waitangi Tribunal on the best ways to implement the revitalisation. The Waitangi Tribunal in 2011 identified a suggestion for language revitalisation that would shift indigenous policies from the central government to the preferences and ideologies of the Māori people. This change recognises the issue of Māori revitalisation as one of indigenous self-determination, instead of the job of the government to identify what would be best for the language and Māori people of New Zealand.
===Revival since 2015===

Beginning in about 2015, the Māori language underwent a revival as it became increasingly popular, as a common national heritage and shared cultural identity, even among New Zealanders without Māori roots. Surveys from 2018 indicated that &quot;the Māori language currently enjoys a high status in Māori society and also positive acceptance by the majority of non-Māori New Zealanders&quot;.

As the status and prestige of the language rose, so did the demand for language classes. Businesses, including Google, Microsoft, Vodafone NZ and Fletcher Building, were quick to adopt the trend as it became apparent that using made customers think of a company as &quot;committed to New Zealand&quot;. The language became increasingly heard in the media and in politics. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern—who gave her daughter a Māori middle name, and said she would learn both Māori and English—made headlines when she toasted Commonwealth leaders in 2018 with a Māori proverb, and the success of Māori musical groups such as Alien Weaponry and Maimoa further increased the language&#x27;s presence in social media. Since 2017, a selected number of Disney movies have received a dubbing in Māori, the first having been &quot;Moana&quot;.

In August 2017, Rotorua became the first city in New Zealand to declare itself as bilingual in the Māori and English languages, meaning that both languages would be promoted. In 2019, the New Zealand government launched the &quot;Maihi Karauna&quot; Māori language revitalisation strategy with a goal of 1 million people speaking by 2040. Also in 2019, Kotahi Rau Pukapuka Trust and Auckland University Press began work on publishing a sizeable library of local and international literature in the language, including the Harry Potter books.

Some New Zealanders have pushed against the revival, debating the replacement of English-language place names with original Māori names, criticising a police car having Māori language and graphics, and complaining about being used by broadcasters. In March 2021, the Broadcasting Standards Authority (BSA) said it would no longer entertain complaints regarding the use of the Māori language in broadcasts. This followed a fivefold increase in complaints to the BSA. The use of Māori in itself does not breach any broadcasting standards.

== Linguistic classification ==

Comparative linguists classify Māori as a Polynesian language, specifically as an Eastern Polynesian language belonging to the Tahitic subgroup, which includes Cook Islands Māori, spoken in the southern Cook Islands, and Tahitian, spoken in Tahiti and the Society Islands. Other major Eastern Polynesian languages include Hawaiian, Marquesan (languages in the Marquesic subgroup), and the Rapa Nui language of Easter Island.

While the preceding are all distinct languages, they remain similar enough that Tupaia, a Tahitian travelling with Captain James Cook in 1769–1770, communicated effectively with Māori. Hawaiian newspaper &quot;Ka Nupepa Kuokoa&quot; in 1911 covering Ernest Kaʻai and his Royal Hawaiians&#x27; band tour of New Zealand reported that Kaʻai himself wrote to them about the band able to communicate with Māori while visiting their rural maraes. Māori actors, travelling to Easter Island for production of the film noticed a marked similarity between the native tongues, as did arts curator Reuben Friend, who noted that it took only a short time to pick up any different vocabulary and the different nuances to recognisable words. Speakers of modern Māori generally report that they find the languages of the Cook Islands, including Rarotongan, the easiest among the other Polynesian languages to understand and converse in.

== Geographic distribution ==

Nearly all speakers are ethnic Māori residents of New Zealand. Estimates of the number of speakers vary: the 1996 census reported 160,000, while a 1995 national survey reported about 10,000 &quot;very fluent&quot; adult speakers.
As reported in the 2013 national census, only 21.3% of self-identified Māori had a conversational knowledge of the language, and only around 6.5% of those speakers, 1.4% of the total Māori population, spoke the Māori language only. This percentage has been in decline in recent years, from around a quarter of the population to 21%. In the same census, Māori speakers were 3.7% of the total population.

The level of competence of self-professed Māori speakers varies from minimal to total. Statistics have not been gathered for the prevalence of different levels of competence. Only a minority of self-professed speakers use Māori as their main language at home. The rest use only a few words or phrases (passive bilingualism).

Māori is a community language in some predominantly Māori settlements in the Northland, Urewera and East Cape areas. Māori-immersion kindergartens throughout New Zealand use Māori exclusively.

Urbanisation after the Second World War led to widespread language shift from Māori predominance (with Māori the primary language of the rural ) to English predominance (English serving as the primary language in the cities). Therefore, Māori speakers almost always communicate bilingually, with New Zealand English as either their first or second language. Only around 9,000 people speak only in Māori.

In the 2023 school year, around 7.2% of primary and secondary school students in New Zealand were taught fully or partially in Māori. An additional 24.4% were formally taught Māori as an additional language, and 37.1% were taught Māori informally. However, very few students pass through the New Zealand education system without any Māori language education. For example, only 2.1% of students in Year 1 (aged 5) didn&#x27;t receive any Māori language education in 2023.

The use of the Māori language in the Māori diaspora is far lower than in New Zealand itself. Census data from Australia show it as the home language of 11,747, just 8.2% of the total Australian Māori population in 2016.

== Orthography ==
The modern Māori alphabet has 15 letters, two of which are digraphs (character pairs). The five vowels have both short and long forms, with the long forms denoted by macrons marked above them.

The order of the alphabet is as follows: A, E, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, R, T, U, W, Ng, Wh.

This standard orthography may be tweaked to represent certain dialects of Māori:
*An underlined &quot;ḵ&quot; sometimes appears when writing the Southern dialect, to indicate that the /k/ in question corresponds to the &quot;ng&quot; of the standard language.
*Both L and G are also encountered in the Southern dialect, though not in standard Māori.
*Various methods are used to indicate glottal stops when writing the Whanganui dialect.

===History===
There was originally no native writing system for Māori. It has been suggested that the petroglyphs once used by the Māori developed into a script similar to the Rongorongo of Easter Island. However, there is no evidence that these petroglyphs ever evolved into a true system of writing. Some distinctive markings among the (rafter paintings) of meeting houses were used as mnemonics in reciting (genealogy) but again, there was no systematic relation between marks and meanings.

Attempts to write Māori words using the Latin script began with Captain James Cook and other early explorers, with varying degrees of success. Consonants seem to have caused the most difficulty, but medial and final vowels are often missing in early sources. Anne Salmond records &quot;aghee&quot; for aki (in the year 1773, from the North Island East Coast, p. 98), &quot;Toogee&quot; and &quot;E tanga roak&quot; for Tuki and Tangaroa (1793, Northland, p. 216), &quot;Kokramea&quot;, &quot;Kakramea&quot; for Kakaramea (1801, Hauraki, p. 261), &quot;toges&quot; for tokis, &quot;Wannugu&quot; for Uenuku and &quot;gumera&quot; for kumara (1801, Hauraki, pp. 261, 266 and 269), &quot;Weygate&quot; for Waikato (1801, Hauraki, p. 277), &quot;Bunga Bunga&quot; for pungapunga, for tupua and &quot;gure&quot; for kurī (1801, Hauraki, p. 279), as well as &quot;Tabooha&quot; for Te Puhi (1823, Northern Northland, p. 385).

From 1814, missionaries tried to define the sounds of the language. Thomas Kendall published a book in 1815 entitled &quot;A korao no New Zealand&quot;, which in modern orthography and usage would be . Beginning in 1817, professor Samuel Lee of Cambridge University worked with the Ngāpuhi chief Tītore and his junior relative Tui (also known as Tuhi or Tupaea), and then with chief Hongi Hika and his junior relative Waikato; they established a definitive orthography based on Northern usage, published as the &quot;First Grammar and Vocabulary of the New Zealand Language&quot; (1820). The missionaries of the Church Missionary Society (CMS) did not have a high regard for this book. By 1830 the CMS missionaries had revised the orthography for writing the Māori language; for example, &#x27;Kiddeekiddee&#x27; was changed to the modern spelling, &#x27;Kerikeri&#x27;.

The Māori embraced literacy enthusiastically, and missionaries reported in the 1820s that Māori all over the country taught each other to read and write, using sometimes quite innovative materials in the absence of paper, such as leaves and charcoal, and flax. Missionary James West Stack recorded the scarcity of slates and writing materials at the native schools and the use sometimes of &quot;pieces of board on which sand was sprinkled, and the letters traced upon the sand with a pointed stick&quot;.

==== Long vowels ====
The alphabet devised at Cambridge University does not mark vowel length. The examples in the following table show that vowel length is phonemic in Māori.
Māori devised ways to mark vowel length, sporadically at first. Occasional and inconsistent vowel-length markings occur in 19th-century manuscripts and newspapers written by Māori, including macron-like diacritics and doubling of letters. Māori writer Hare Hongi (Henry Stowell) used macrons in his &quot;Maori-English Tutor and Vade Mecum&quot; of 1911, as does Sir Āpirana Ngata (albeit inconsistently) in his &quot;Maori Grammar and Conversation&quot; (7th printing 1953). Once the Māori language was taught in universities in the 1960s, vowel-length marking was made systematic. Bruce Biggs, of Ngāti Maniapoto descent and professor at the University of Auckland, promoted the use of double vowels (e.g. &quot;waahine&quot;); this style was standard at the university until Biggs died in 2000.

Macrons () are now the standard means of indicating long vowels, after becoming the favoured option of the Māori Language Commission—set up by the Māori Language Act 1987 to act as the authority for Māori spelling and orthography. Most news media now use macrons; Stuff websites and newspapers since 2017, TVNZ and NZME websites and newspapers since 2018.

Technical limitations in producing macronised vowels are sometimes resolved by using a diaeresis or circumflex instead of a macron (e.g., wähine or wâhine). In other cases, it is resolved by omitting the macron all together (e.g. wahine).

Double vowels continue to be used in a few exceptional cases, including:
* The Waikato-Tainui iwi preference is for using doubled vowels; hence in the Waikato region, double vowels are used by the Hamilton City Council, Waikato District Council and Waikato Museum.
* Inland Revenue continues to spell its Māori name instead of , mainly to reduce the resemblance of to the English word &#x27;take&#x27;. 
* A considerable number of governmental and non-governmental organisations continue to use the older spelling of (&#x27;association&#x27;) in their names rather than the more modern form . Examples include Te Roopu Raranga Whatu o Aotearoa (&#x27;the national Māori weavers&#x27; collective&#x27;) and (a Māori-specific organisation within the Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand).
* Double vowels are also used instead of macrons in long vowels resultant from compounding (e.g. Mātaatua) or reduplication.

== Phonology ==

Māori has five phonemically distinct vowel articulations, and ten consonant phonemes.

=== Vowels ===

Although it is commonly claimed that vowel realisations (pronunciations) in Māori show little variation, linguistic research has shown this not to be the case.

Vowel length is phonemic, but four of the five long vowels occur in only a handful of word roots, the exception being . As noted above, it has recently become standard in Māori spelling to indicate a long vowel with a macron. For older speakers, long vowels tend to be more peripheral and short vowels more centralised, especially with the low vowel, which is long but short . For younger speakers, they are both . For older speakers, is only fronted after ; elsewhere it is . For younger speakers, it is fronted everywhere, as with the corresponding phoneme in New Zealand English. Due to the influence of New Zealand English, the vowel [e] is raised to be near [i], so that &quot;pī&quot; and &quot;kē&quot; (or &quot;piki&quot; and &quot;kete&quot;) now largely share the very same vowel space.

Beside monophthongs Māori has many diphthong vowel phonemes. Although any short vowel combinations are possible, researchers disagree on which combinations constitute diphthongs. Formant frequency analysis distinguish as diphthongs.
As in many other Polynesian languages, diphthongs in Māori vary only slightly from sequences of adjacent vowels, except that they belong to the same syllable, and all or nearly all sequences of nonidentical vowels are possible. All sequences of nonidentical short vowels occur and are phonemically distinct.

=== Consonants ===

The consonant phonemes of Māori are listed in the following table. Seven of the ten Māori consonant letters have the same pronunciation as they do in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). For those that do not, the IPA phonetic transcription is included, enclosed in square brackets per IPA convention.

The pronunciation of is extremely variable, but its most common pronunciation (its canonical allophone) is the labiodental fricative, IPA (as in the English word &quot;fill&quot;). Another allophone is the voiceless bilabial fricative, IPA , which is usually supposed to be the sole pre-European pronunciation, although linguists are not sure of the truth of this supposition. At least until the 1930s, the bilabial fricative was considered to be the correct pronunciation. The fact that English gets substituted by and not in borrowings (for example, English &quot;February&quot; becomes &quot;Pēpuere&quot; instead of ) would strongly hint that the Māori did not perceive English to be the same sound as their .

Because English stops primarily have aspiration, speakers of English often hear the Māori nonaspirated stops as English . However, younger Māori speakers tend to aspirate as in English. English speakers also tend to hear Māori as English in certain positions (cf. Japanese r).

 can come at the beginning of a word (like &#x27;sing-along&#x27; without the &quot;si&quot;), which may be difficult for English speakers outside of New Zealand to manage.

In some western areas of the North Island, is pronounced as a glottal stop instead of , and the digraph is pronounced as instead of or .

 is typically a flap, especially before . However, elsewhere it is sometimes trilled.

In borrowings from English, many consonants are substituted by the nearest available Māori consonant. For example, the English affricates and , and the fricative are replaced by , becomes /, and becomes (the is sometimes retained in the southern dialect, as noted below).

=== Syllables and phonotactics ===
Syllables in Māori have one of the following forms: V, VV, CV, CVV. This set of four can be summarised by the notation, , in which the segments in parentheses may or may not be present. A syllable cannot begin with two consonant sounds (the digraphs &quot;ng&quot; and &quot;wh&quot; represent single consonant sounds), and cannot end in a consonant, although some speakers may occasionally devoice a final vowel. All possible CV combinations are grammatical, though &quot;wo&quot;, &quot;who&quot;, &quot;wu&quot;, and &quot;whu&quot; occur only in a few loanwords from English such as , &quot;wool&quot; and , &quot;football&quot;.

As in many other Polynesian languages, e.g., Hawaiian, the rendering of loanwords from English includes representing every English consonant of the loanword (using the native consonant inventory; English has 24 consonants to 10 for Māori) and breaking up consonant clusters. For example, &quot;Presbyterian&quot; has been borrowed as &quot;Perehipeteriana&quot;; no consonant position in the loanword has been deleted, but and have been replaced with and , respectively.

Stress is typically within the last four vowels of a word, with long vowels and diphthongs counting double. That is, on the last four moras. However, stressed moras are longer than unstressed moras, so the word does not have the precision in Māori that it does in some other languages. It falls preferentially on the first long vowel, on the first diphthong if there is no long vowel (though for some speakers never a final diphthong), and on the first syllable otherwise. Compound words (such as names) may have a stressed syllable in each component word. In long sentences, the final syllable before a pause may have a stress in preference to the normal stressed syllable.

== Dialects ==
Biggs proposed that historically there were two major dialect groups, North Island and South Island, and that South Island Māori is extinct. Biggs has analysed North Island Māori as comprising a western group and an eastern group with the boundary between them running pretty much along the island&#x27;s north–south axis.

Within these broad divisions regional variations occur, and individual regions show tribal variations. The major differences occur in the pronunciation of words, variation of vocabulary, and idiom. A fluent speaker of Māori has no problem understanding other dialects.

There is no significant variation in grammar between dialects. &quot;Most of the tribal variation in grammar is a matter of preferences: speakers of one area might prefer one grammatical form to another, but are likely on occasion to use the non-preferred form, and at least to recognise and understand it.&quot; Vocabulary and pronunciation vary to a greater extent, but this does not pose barriers to communication.

=== Northern Dialects ===

In the northern dialects, particularly in Muriwhenua and parts of Ngāpuhi, the digraph &quot;wh&quot; is not pronounced as , as it is in most of the other dialects, but as a voiceless bilabial fricative . Some speakers also reduce this sound to , particularly in words beginning with the causative prefix &quot;whaka-&quot; (e.g. &quot;Whakarongo&quot;), leading to the pronunciation being heard as &quot;haka-&quot; (e.g. &quot;Hakarongo&quot; or &quot;&#x27;hakarongo&quot;).

Speakers of the Northern Dialect, like other dialects, also have preferences for specific renderings of words (e.g. &quot;Kāhore&quot; instead of &quot;Kāore&quot;, &quot;Kaurua/Kourua&quot; instead of &quot;Kōrua&quot;, etc.), or entirely unique words (e.g. &quot;Kūkupa&quot; instead of &quot;Kererū&quot;, &quot;Whareiti&quot; instead of &quot;Wharepaku&quot;, etc.)

=== Eastern and Western dialects ===

In the southwest of the North Island, in the Whanganui and Taranaki regions, the phoneme is a glottal stop and the phoneme is . This difference was the subject of considerable debate during the 1990s and 2000s over the then-proposed change of the name of the city Wanganui to Whanganui.

In Tūhoe and the Eastern Bay of Plenty (northeastern North Island) has merged with .

=== South Island dialects ===

In South Island dialects, &quot;ng&quot; merged with &quot;k&quot; in many regions. Thus &quot;Kāi Tahu&quot; and &quot;Ngāi Tahu&quot; are variations in the name of the same iwi (the latter form is the one used in acts of Parliament). Since 2000, the government has altered the official names of several southern place names to the southern dialect forms by replacing &quot;ng&quot; with &quot;k&quot;. New Zealand&#x27;s highest mountain, known for centuries as in southern Māori dialects that merge &quot;ng&quot; with &quot;k&quot;, and as by other Māori, was later named &quot;Mount Cook&quot;. Now its sole official name is &quot;Aoraki / Mount Cook&quot;, which favours the local dialect form. Similarly, the Māori name for Stewart Island, , is cognate with the name of the Canterbury town of Rangiora. Likewise, Dunedin&#x27;s main research library, the Hocken Collections, has the name rather than the northern (standard) . Maarire Goodall and George Griffiths say there is also a voicing of &quot;k&quot; to &quot;g&quot;, which explains why the region of Otago (southern dialect) and the settlement it is named after – Otakou (standard Māori) – vary in spelling (the pronunciation of the latter having changed over time to accommodate the northern spelling).

The standard Māori &quot;r&quot; is also found occasionally changed to an &quot;l&quot; in these southern dialects and the &quot;wh&quot; to &quot;w&quot;. These changes are most commonly found in place names, such as Lake Waihola, and the nearby coastal settlement of Wangaloa (which would, in standard Māori, be rendered ), and Little Akaloa, on Banks Peninsula. Goodall and Griffiths suggest that final vowels are given a centralised pronunciation as schwa or that they are elided (pronounced indistinctly or not at all), resulting in such seemingly bastardised place names as The Kilmog, which in standard Māori would have been rendered , but which in southern dialect would have been pronounced very much as the current name suggests. This same elision is found in numerous other southern placenames, such as the two small settlements called The Kaik (from the term for a fishing village, in standard Māori), near Palmerston and Akaroa, and the early spelling of Lake Wakatipu as . In standard Māori, Wakatipu would have been rendered , showing further the elision of a final vowel.

Despite the dialect being officially regarded as extinct, its use in signage and official documentation is encouraged by many government and educational agencies in Otago and Southland.

== Grammar and syntax ==
Māori has mostly a verb-subject-object (VSO) word order. It is also analytical, featuring almost no inflection, and makes extensive use of grammatical particles to indicate grammatical categories of tense, mood, aspect, case, topicalization, among others. The personal pronouns have a distinction in clusivity, singular, dual and plural numbers, and the genitive pronouns have different classes (&quot;a&quot; class, &quot;o&quot; class and neutral) according to whether the possession is alienable or the possessor has control of the relationship (&quot;a&quot; category), or the possession is inalienable or the possessor has no control over the relationship (&quot;o&quot; category), and a third neutral class that only occurs for singular pronouns and must be followed by a noun. There is also subject-object-verb (SOV) word order used in passive sentences. Examples of this include &quot;Nāku te ngohi i tunu&quot; (&quot;I cooked the fish&quot;; literally &quot;I the fish cooked&quot;) and &quot;Mā wai te haka e kaea?&quot; (&quot;Who will lead the haka?&quot;).

Biggs (1998) developed an analysis that the basic unit of Māori speech is the phrase rather than the word. The lexical word forms the &quot;base&quot; of the phrase. Biggs identifies five types of bases.

Noun bases include those bases that can take a definite article, but cannot occur as the nucleus of a verbal phrase; for example: (fish) or (tree). Plurality is marked by various means, including the definite article (singular , plural ), deictic particles (that tree), (those trees), possessives (my house), (my houses). A few nouns lengthen a vowel in the plural, such as (woman); (women). In general, bases used as qualifiers follow the base they qualify, e.g. &quot;matua wahine&quot; (mother, female elder) from &quot;matua&quot; (parent, elder) &quot;wahine&quot; (woman).

Universal bases are verbs which can be used passively. When used passively, these verbs take a passive form. Biggs gives three examples of universals in their passive form: (drunk), (wept for), and (said).

Stative bases serve as bases usable as verbs but not available for passive use, such as &quot;ora&quot;, alive or &quot;tika&quot;, correct. Grammars generally refer to them as &quot;stative verbs&quot;. When used in sentences, statives require different syntax than other verb-like bases.

Locative bases can follow the locative particle &quot;ki&quot; (to, towards) directly, such as &quot;runga&quot;, above, &quot;waho&quot;, outside, and placenames (&quot;ki Tamaki&quot;, to Auckland).

Personal bases take the personal article &quot;a&quot; after &quot;ki&quot;, such as names of people (&quot;ki a Hohepa&quot;, to Joseph), personified houses, personal pronouns, &quot;wai?&quot; who? and &quot;mea&quot;, so-and-so.

=== Particles ===
Like all other Polynesian languages, Māori has a rich array of particles, which include verbal particles, pronouns, locative particles, articles and possessives.

Verbal particles indicate aspectual, tense-related or modal properties of the verb which they relate to. They include:

* &quot;i&quot; (past)
* &quot;e&quot; (non-past)
* &quot;i te&quot; (past continuous)
* &quot;kei te&quot; (present continuous)
* &quot;kua&quot; (perfect)
* &quot;e ... ana&quot; (imperfect, continuous)
* &quot;ka&quot; (inceptive, future)
* &quot;kia&quot; (desiderative)
* &quot;me&quot; (prescriptive)
* &quot;kei&quot; (warning, &quot;lest&quot;)
* &quot;ina&quot; or &quot;ana&quot; (punctative-conditional, &quot;if and when&quot;)
* &quot;kāti&quot; (cessative)
*&quot;ai&quot; (habitual)

Locative particles (prepositions) refer to position in time and/or space, and include:

*&quot;ki&quot; (to, towards)
*&quot;kei&quot; (at)
*&quot;i&quot; (past position)
*&quot;hei&quot; (future position)

Possessives fall into one of two classes of prepositions marked by &quot;a&quot; and &quot;o&quot;, depending on the dominant versus subordinate relationship between possessor and possessed: &quot;ngā tamariki a te matua&quot;, the children of the parent but &quot;te matua o ngā tamariki&quot;, the parent of the children.

=== Determiners ===
==== Articles ====
The definite articles are (singular) and (plural). Several other determiners termed definitives are related to the singular definite article , such as the definitive possessive constructions with and and the demonstrative determiners.

The Māori definite articles are frequently used where the equivalent, &quot;the&quot;, is not used in English, such as when referring generically to an entire class. In these cases, the singular can even be used with a morphologically plural noun, as in 

as opposed to 
In other syntactic environments, the definite article may be used to introduce a noun-phrase which is pragmatically indefinite due to the restrictions on the use of as discussed below.

The indefinite article is used most frequently in the predicate and occasionally in the subject of the sentence, although it is not allowed in subject position in all sentence types. In the predicate, the indefinite article can introduce either nouns or adjectives. The article either can be translated to the English &#x27;a&#x27; or &#x27;some&#x27;, but the number will not be indicated by . With nouns that show morphological number, may be used either with singular or plural forms. The indefinite article when used with mass nouns like water and sand will always mean &#x27;some&#x27;.

The indefinite article is highly restricted in its use and is incompatible with a preceding preposition. For this reason, it cannot be used in the grammatical object of the sentence as these are marked prepositionally, either with or . In many cases, speakers simply use the definite articles and in positions where is disallowed, however the indefinite articles and may be used in these situations to emphasise the indefiniteness.

In positions where both and / may occur, there are sometimes differences of meaning between them as the following examples indicate.

The proper article is used before personal and locative nouns acting as the subject of the sentence or before personal nouns and pronouns within prepositional phrases headed by prepositions ending in &quot;i&quot; (namely , , and ).





The personal nouns are not accompanied by definite or indefinite articles unless they are an intrinsic part of the name, as in Te Rauparaha.

Proper nouns are not preceded by the proper article when they are neither acting as the subject of the sentence nor in a prepositional phrase headed by , , or . For example, after the focusing particle , the proper article is not used.

==== Demonstrative determiners and adverbs ====
Demonstratives occur after the noun and have a deictic function, and include , this (near me), , that (near you), , that (far from us both), and , the aforementioned (anaphoric). These demonstratives, having a connection to the definite article are termed definitives. Other definitives include (which?), and , (a certain). The plural is formed just by dropping the &quot;t&quot;: (this), (these). The related adverbs are (here), (there, near you), (over there, near him).

Phrases introduced by demonstratives can also be expressed using the definite article or preceding a noun followed by one of the deictic particles , or . The &quot;t&quot; of the singular definite article appears in the singular demonstratives but is replaced by &quot;∅&quot; in the plural, having no connection with in the majority of dialects.

However, in dialects of the Waikato area, plural forms of demonstratives beginning with &quot;ng-&quot; are found, such as &#x27;these&#x27; instead of the more widespread (as well as and possessives such as &#x27;my (plural, inalienable)&#x27; instead of ).

The following table shows the most common forms of demonstratives across dialects.

=== Pronouns ===

==== Personal pronouns ====
Pronouns have singular, dual and plural number. Different first-person forms in both the dual and the plural are used for groups inclusive or exclusive of the person(s) addressed.

Like other Polynesian languages, Māori has three numbers for pronouns and possessives: singular, dual and plural. For example: (he/she), (those two), (they, three or more). Māori pronouns and possessives further distinguish exclusive &quot;we&quot; from inclusive &quot;we&quot;, second and third. It has the plural pronouns: (we, exc), (we, inc), (you), (they). The language features the dual pronouns: (me and another), (me and you), (you two), (those two). The difference between exclusive and inclusive lies in the treatment of the person addressed. refers to the speaker and others but not the person or persons spoken to (&quot;I and some others but not you&quot;), and refers to the speaker, the person or persons spoken to and everyone else (&quot;you, I and others&quot;):

* : hello (to one person)
* : hello (to two people)
* : hello (to more than two people)

==== Possessive pronouns ====
The possessive pronouns vary according to person, number, clusivity, and possessive class (a class or o class). Example: (my pen), (my pens). For dual and plural subject pronouns, the possessive form is analytical, by just putting the possessive particle (tā/tō for singular objects or ā/ō for plural objects) before the personal pronouns, e.g. (our class), (their [dual] house); (our classes). The neuter one must be followed by a noun and only occur for singular first, second and third persons. is my, is my (plural, for many possessed items). The plural is made by deleting the initial [t].

==== Interrogative pronouns ====
* (&#x27;who&#x27;)
* (&#x27;what&#x27;)
* (&#x27;where&#x27;)
* (&#x27;whence&#x27;)
* (&#x27;when&#x27;)
* (&#x27;how many [things]&#x27;)
* (&#x27;how many [people]&#x27;)
* (&#x27;how&#x27;)
* (&#x27;which&#x27;), ēhea (&#x27;which [pl.]&#x27;)
* (&#x27;why [reason]&#x27;)
* (&#x27;why [cause]&#x27;)

=== Phrase grammar ===
A phrase spoken in Māori can be broken up into two parts: the &quot;nucleus&quot; or &quot;head&quot; and &quot;periphery&quot; (modifiers, determiners). The nucleus can be thought of as the meaning and is the centre of the phrase, whereas the periphery is where the grammatical meaning is conveyed and occurs before and/or after the nucleus.

The nucleus can be translated as &quot;house&quot;, the periphery is similar to an article &quot;the&quot; and the periphery indicates proximity to the speaker. The whole phrase, , can then be translated as &quot;this house&quot;.

==== Phrasal particles ====
A definite and declarative sentence (may be a copulative sentence) begins with the declarative particle &quot;ko&quot;. If the sentence is topicalized (agent topic, only in non-present sentences) the sentence begins with the particle nā (past tense) or the particle mā (future, imperfective) followed by the agent/subject. In these cases the word order changes to subject-verb-object. These agent topicalizing particles can contract with singular personal pronouns and vary according to the possessive classes: &quot;nāku&quot; can be thought of as meaning &quot;as for me&quot; and behave like an emphatic or dative pronoun.

==== Case particles ====
* Nominative: ko
* Accusative: i
* Dative/directional locative: ki
* Genitive: a/o

=== Negation ===
Forming negative phrases in Māori is quite grammatically complex. There are several different negators which are used under various specific circumstances. The main negators are as follows:

 and are two negators which may be seen in specific dialects or older texts, but are not widely used. The most common negator is , which may occur in one of four forms, with the form only being used in response to a question. Negative phrases, besides using , also affect the form of verbal particles, as illustrated below.

The general usage of can be seen in the following examples. The subject is usually raised in negative phrases, although this is not obligatory. Each example of a negative phrase is presented with its analogue positive phrase for comparison.




=== Passive sentences ===
The passive voice of verbs is made by a suffix to the verb. For example, -ia (or just -a if the verb ends in [i]). The other passive suffixes, some of which are very rare, are: -hanga/-hia/-hina/-ina/-kia/-kina/-mia/-na/-nga/-ngia/-ria/-rina/-tia/-whia/-whina/. The use of the passive suffix -ia is given in this sentence: &quot;Kua hangaia te marae e ngā tohunga&quot; (The marae has been built by the experts). The active form of this sentence is rendered as: &quot;Kua hanga ngā tohunga i te marae&quot; (The experts have built the marae). It can be seen that the active sentence contains the object marker &#x27;i&#x27;, that is not present in the passive sentence, while the passive sentence has the agent marker &#x27;e&#x27;, which is not present in the active sentence.

=== Polar questions ===
Polar questions (yes/no questions) can be made by changing the intonation of the sentence. The answers may be āe (yes) or kāo (no).

=== Derivational morphology ===
Although Māori is mostly analytical there are several derivational affixes:

* -anga, -hanga, -ranga, -tanga (-ness, -ity) (the suffix depends on whether the verb takes, respectively, the -ia, -hia, -ria or -tia passive suffixes) (e.g. &quot;pōti&quot; &#x27;vote&#x27;, &quot;pōtitanga&quot; &#x27;election&#x27;)
* -nga (nominalizer)
* kai- (agentive noun) (e.g. &quot;mahi&quot; &#x27;work&#x27;, &quot;kaimahi&quot; &#x27;worker/employee&#x27;)
* ma- (adjectives)
* tua- (ordinal numerals) (e.g. &quot;tahi&quot; &#x27;one&#x27;, &quot;tuatahi&quot; &#x27;first/primary&#x27;)
*whaka- (causative prefix)

== Influence on New Zealand English ==

New Zealand English has gained many loanwords from Māori, mainly the names of birds, plants, fishes and places. For example, the kiwi, the national bird, takes its name from . &quot;Kia ora&quot; (literally &quot;be healthy&quot;) is a widely adopted greeting of Māori origin, with the intended meaning of &quot;hello&quot;. It can also mean &quot;thank you&quot;, or signify agreement with a speaker at a meeting. The Māori greetings (to one person), (to two people) or (to three or more people) are also widely used, as are farewells such as . The Māori phrase , &quot;be strong&quot;, is frequently encountered as an indication of moral support for someone starting a stressful undertaking or otherwise in a difficult situation. Many other words such as (meaning &quot;family&quot;) and (meaning &quot;food&quot;) are also widely understood and used by New Zealanders. The Māori phrase means &#x27;until I see you again&#x27; is quite commonly used.

In 2023, 47 words or expressions from New Zealand English, mostly from &quot;te reo Māori&quot; were added to the Oxford English Dictionary.

<doc id="50790" wikidata="Q19913" url="?curid=50790" title="Star Destroyer">
<text>Star Destroyers are capital ships in the fictional &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe. Star Destroyers were produced by Kuat Drive Yards, later Kuat-Entralla Engineering, and serve as &quot;the signature vessel of the fleet&quot; for the Galactic Empire, the First Order, and the Sith Eternal in numerous published works including film, television, novels, comics, and video games.

A single Star Destroyer could project considerable influence over a star system in the name of the Empire: each can be deployed individually as both a forward operating base and as mobile weapon systems platform responsible for safeguarding multiple planets, trade routes, and systems, and carried enough firepower to subdue an entire planetary system or annihilate a small rebel fleet.

Notable examples of Star Destroyers include the precursor &quot;Venator&quot;-class Star Destroyer (prequel trilogy), the ubiquitous &quot;Imperial&quot;-class Star Destroyer (original trilogy), and the recent &quot;Resurgent&quot;-class and &quot;Xyston&quot;-class Star Destroyer (sequel trilogy). Numerous other classes of &quot;Star Destroyers&quot; share the basic triangular &quot;dagger&quot; hull; the successful v-shaped designs are explained in &quot;Legends&quot; as reflecting the Empire&#x27;s &quot;Tarkin&#x27;s Doctrine&quot; military philosophy and originating from Sith ideological influence, and have been adapted by numerous factions for a wide variety of applications.

Numerous Star Destroyer models and toys have been released. The iconic scene in &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977) featuring the Imperial Star Destroyer&#x27;s first appearance where it pursues a Corellian corvette has been called a milestone in special effects history.

== Imperial Star Destroyer ==

=== Concept and design ===

In draft scripts for the film that would become &quot;Star Wars&quot;, the term &quot;Stardestroyer&quot; refers to two-man fighters flown by what would become the Galactic Empire. The film&#x27;s second draft features four Star Destroyers chasing a single Rebel ship, but the tremendous costs incurred by Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM) when production began helped lead Lucas to use a single &quot;terrifyingly large&quot; Star Destroyer instead of four. ILM built a shooting model that was about half the size of the model for the &quot;Tantive IV&quot; the Star Destroyer was chasing. Lucas asked ILM to build a larger Star Destroyer model to match the &quot;Tantive IV&quot;&#x27;s scale, but ILM convinced him that the Dykstraflex camera invented for the film made this unnecessary. Nevertheless, they added additional hull details to the Star Destroyer model. The 13-second opening shot was the first special effects piece ILM completed, and its success was an essential test for the Dykstraflex.

ILM built a Star Destroyer, equipped with internal lighting to provide a better sense of scale, for &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980). According to chief model maker Lorne Peterson, the new Star Destroyer model was scaled to appear two and a half miles long, though their official length was revised in later sources.

The &quot;Imperial I&quot;-class Star Destroyers are white, as shown in &quot;A New Hope&quot;, &quot;Rogue One&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. The &quot;Imperial II&quot;-class Star Destroyers in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; are grey.

=== Depiction ===
The iconic &quot;Imperial&quot;-class Star Destroyer first appears in the opening scene of &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977), where the Imperial Star Destroyer &quot;Devastator&quot; (carrying Darth Vader) chases the CR90 Corvette &quot;Tantive IV&quot; (carrying Princess Leia) above Tatooine after the latter had fled from Scarif. Background literature describes &quot;Imperial&quot;-class Star Destroyers as the chief warship of the Imperial Navy and symbol of Imperial might. These enormous capital ships are used to enforce the Emperor&#x27;s will, bolster Imperial-backed governments, and act as mobile headquarters for senior Imperial commanders. In addition to their powerful armament, a Star Destroyer carries troops and vehicles for ground operations and a full wing of TIE fighters (typically 48 fighters, 12 bombers and 12 boarding craft). A single Star Destroyer is considered sufficient to overwhelm a rebellious planet, though major industrialized worlds may be assaulted by a fleet of six Star Destroyers with support cruisers and supply craft. Deep-crust survival bunkers are regarded as a last refuge in the event of planetary bombardment by Imperial Star Destroyers. At the Empire&#x27;s height there were over 25,000 Star Destroyers in existence, requiring roughly 925 million crew.

Darth Vader&#x27;s &quot;Devastator&quot; is the last of the &quot;Imperial I&quot;-class ships to be built by Kuat Drive Yards before switching to the &quot;Imperial II&quot;-class, a fleet of which take part in the Battle of Hoth as depicted in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980). Designated Death Squadron, this fleet of Star Destroyers is led by Darth Vader aboard the &quot;Executor&quot;, first in a new class of Super Star Destroyer. Although the battle is won by Imperial forces, Vader orders his Star Destroyers to focus on capturing the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot; rather than hunt down the escaping Rebel transports, allowing many to escape. The &quot;Falcon&quot; manages to evade this pursuit by hiding in the sensor blind spot of the Star Destroyer &quot;Avenger&quot;. These ships play a major role in the Battle of Endor as depicted in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983). During the battle, Imperial Star Destroyers prove vulnerable to fleets of starfighters flown by skilled Rebel pilots, who exploit the ships&#x27; exposed bridges and deflector shield generators to cause damage. A year after their defeat at Endor, the Empire makes a last stand at Jakku. During the battle, Imperial Star Destroyers use their tractor beams to drag New Republic ships down to the planet&#x27;s surface, where their wrecks form the Graveyard of Ships as seen in &quot;The Force Awakens&quot; (2015).

=== Analysis ===
Examining what it would take to realistically build an Imperial Star Destroyer, it was estimated in 2016 that such a vessel would cost $636 billion USD. Using then-current technology and naval vessels as a reference, the ship would weigh 4.44 billion kilograms, generate 146.5 gigawatts of power, and its engines would produce a combined total thrust of 3.5 million newtons. However getting the parts into space to construct the Star Destroyer would require an additional $44.4 trillion USD in launch costs, suggesting that asteroid mining and refining technologies would have to be developed first to make it more economical.

Joe Pappalardo of &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; argues that the Imperial Star Destroyer is a poorly-designed spaceship, being asymmetrical with its superstructure jutting out in one direction. Additionally, while its wedge shape would make sense for atmospheric travel, it serves no purpose in space. He argues a more realistic and effective design would be symmetrical and bowl-shaped like a saucer.

=== Cultural influence ===
Lego has released multiple different Star Destroyer kits over the years, from small sets with just 21 pieces to the largest versions with thousands of pieces. These include two Ultimate Collector Series models, the first of which was released in 2002. Measuring long and , it sold for $269.99 until being retired in 2007. The second UCS Star Destroyer was larger, long and wide, and sold for $699.99 between 2019 and 2022.

== Super Star Destroyer ==
=== Concept and design ===
For &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, George Lucas wanted Darth Vader&#x27;s new flagship, &quot;Executor&quot;, to be huge and to play a greater role in the film. According to chief model maker Lorne Peterson, the &quot;Executor&quot;&#x27;s model was long and constructed with over 150,000 individual lights. The resulting model was so heavy it required additional support to keep from overwhelming the Dykstraflex&#x27;s mechanical structure. The ship was originally scaled to appear long according to Lorne, though later sources would amend this figure.

=== Depiction ===
Within the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe, the term &quot;Super Star Destroyer&quot; is a colloquialism used to refer to any ship larger than an Imperial Star Destroyer. The largest and most powerful of these is the &quot;Executor&quot;, which first appeared in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980) as the personal flagship of Darth Vader. The first in a line of &quot;Executor&quot;-class Star Dreadnoughts, the ship is over in length, propelled by thirteen colossal engines and a Class 1 hyperdrive. Its armament includes over 5,000 turbolasers, ion cannons and tractor beam projectors and it can carry more than 1,000 vessels. The crew of the &quot;Executor&quot; numbers in the hundreds of thousands. Its command tower, rising above the ship&#x27;s technoscape on a thick stalk, is a standard model found on other Star Destroyers – including a pair of geodesic domes containing communication transceivers, sensors and deflector shield projectors – and allows for an unobstructed view of the battlefield. At least twelve of these vessels were built by the Empire, including the &quot;Executor&quot;, &quot;Annihilator&quot;, &quot;Ravager&quot; and &quot;Arbitrator&quot;, but the exact number is unknown thanks to Imperial propaganda and black budgets.

From the bridge of the &quot;Executor&quot;, Darth Vader leads Death Squadron during the Battle of Hoth and afterwards in pursuit of the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot;. It later serves as the Imperial command ship during the Battle of Endor. At Endor, intense bombardment by the Rebel Alliance fleet cause the ship&#x27;s shields to fail, allowing Rebel starfighters to strafe the command tower. During this attack an A-wing piloted by Arvel Crynyd crashes into the command bridge, destroying the main navigation complex and causing the vessel to lose control. The &quot;Executor&quot; is lost when the second Death Star&#x27;s gravity well pulls the ship into its surface, destroying the vessel and damaging the Death Star itself. At Jakku where the Empire made its last stand, the Super Star Destroyer &quot;Ravager&quot; is one of the wrecks which make up the Graveyard of Ships.

=== Analysis ===
Rhett Allain, an associate professor of physics at Southeastern Louisiana University, examined the death of the &quot;Executor&quot; in a &quot;Star Wars&quot; Day-themed article for &quot;Wired&quot;. According to him, the &quot;Executor&quot; impacted the second Death Star traveling at , which - assuming the collision was strictly a result of gravitational interaction between the two objects - would require a super-dense Death Star to achieve such an impact velocity. Additionally, the &quot;Executor&quot; had a near constant angular velocity of 0.159 radians/second during the scene where it rotates to face the Death Star. For the crew at the front of the ship, this would result in a centripetal acceleration of 39 G.

If a model of the &quot;Executor&quot; was built to scale and placed hovering over New York City, it would cast a shadow over the island of Manhattan.

=== Cultural influence ===
Like the Imperial Star Destroyer, the Super Star Destroyer has also been merchandised. Lego released a 3,152-piece model of the &quot;Executor&quot;. Kenner wanted to use a less ominous name than &quot;Executor&quot; for the toy playset of Darth Vader&#x27;s meditation chamber. An advertisement agency&#x27;s list of 153 alternatives included Starbase Malevolent, Black Coven, Haphaestus VII, and Cosmocurse; ultimately, the toy was labeled &quot;Darth Vader&#x27;s Star Destroyer&quot;. In 2006, Wizards of the Coast created an &quot;Executor&quot; miniature as part of its &quot;Star Wars&quot; Miniatures Starship Battles game. An electronic Super Star Destroyer toy released by Hasbro &quot;is the rarest among Hasbro&#x27;s Collector Fleet&quot;.

== Venator Star Destroyer ==
=== Concept and design ===
The design of the &quot;Venator&quot;-class Star Destroyers appearing in &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; (2005) are meant to bridge the appearance of the &quot;Acclamator&quot;-class transports in &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot; (2002) and the &quot;Imperial&quot;-class in the original trilogy. This included making use of the Imperial Star Destroyer bridge set for interior shots of the Venator as a connecting theme. Additionally, the changing coloration of the Star Destroyers is meant to represent the downfall of the Republic and rise of the Empire. At the start of the film they are given a red paint scheme first established in &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; (1999) as representing the Republic, but by the end they are colorless.

=== Depiction ===
The &quot;Venator&quot;-class Star Destroyer makes its first theatrical appearance in &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; during the opening Battle of Coruscant. Within the &quot;Star Wars&quot; setting, these ships are regarded as the most powerful capital ships of the Republic Navy during the Clone Wars, serving double duty as battleships and starfighter carriers. These massive ship require a relatively small crew to operate as a deliberate feature compensating for the fact that the Separatists can produce battle droids faster than the Republic can grow clone troopers. As a true warship, the &quot;Venator&quot;-class can feed nearly its entire reactor output (which at maximum power consumes 40,000 tons of fuel per second) into its heavy turbolasers to devastating effect. As a carrier, the Star Destroyer can rapidly deploy hundreds of starfighters, including ARC-170s, V-wings, Z-95 Headhunters and Jedi interceptors, from a -long dorsal flight deck. While strong deflector shielding is employed around the armored bow doors, they are slow to open or close, presenting a weakness in the vessel&#x27;s design.

During the Clone Wars these Star Destroyers, referred to also as Republic attack cruisers or Jedi cruisers, play an important role combating Separatist fleets and providing supporting fire for ground forces. Thanks to their superior firepower, the &quot;Venator&quot;-class has a strong advantage against Separatist warships, and a small flotilla of attack cruisers can easily blast through the deflector shields of a Trade Federation Battleship. At the Battle of Coruscant, over a thousand attack cruisers are deployed to defend the planet, one of which (the Star Destroyer &quot;Guarlara&quot;) delivers a devastating barrage to the &quot;Invisible Hand&quot; at point-blank range. After the end of the Clone Wars and creation of the Galactic Empire, these Star Destroyers will continue to serve for decades in the Imperial Navy until eventually replaced with the &quot;Imperial&quot;-class Star Destroyer.

=== Cultural influence ===
There have been five different Lego sets of the Ventor released since 2009, with the most recent one revealed in 2023. This version of the Venator, part of the Ultimate Collector Series, was released in celebration of the 20th anniversary of the &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot; TV show. Measuring long, wide and tall, the set consists of 5,374 pieces and comes with a commemorative plaque, at an original retail price of $649.99.

For the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show, noted modder Sander van der Velden created a custom-built PC made to look like a Venator Star Destroyer. Built around a fully-functional, liquid-cooled PC, the surrounding case was constructed in the shape of a Venator using aluminum and 3D printed material. The final product required 400 hours of work to complete.

== Resurgent Star Destroyer ==
In &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot; (2015), set 30 years after the fall of the Empire, a new class of Star Destroyer is introduced in service to the First Order. The &quot;Finalizer&quot;, the first of the &quot;Resurgent&quot;-class Star Destroyers built in secret by Kuat-Entralla Engineering, serves as the flagship for both Kylo Ren and General Hux.

=== Concept and design ===
Various concept art for a new class of Star Destroyers was created in the development of &quot;The Force Awakens&quot;, with a finalized designed — drawn by VFX art director James Clyne — approved in July 2014. Clyne had experimented with using negative spaces in creating the Star Destroyer, similar to his earlier work on &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot;. He said he had fun fun working on it as director J. J. Abrams was heavily involved in the process and offered suggestions. Clyne also drew concept art for the &quot;Finalizer&quot;&#x27;s hanger, and when it came time to build the set at Pinewood Studios, he relocated there for a month to supervise the construction.

=== Depiction ===
&quot;Resurgent&quot;-class Star Destroyers are described in background literature as a clear violation of the treaties between the New Republic and the First Order, measuring at in length and with a crew of 19,000 officers and 55,000 enlisted personnel. While evoking the traditional &quot;Imperial&quot;-class Star Destroyer, the &quot;Resurgent&quot;-class incorporates a number of fixes to the former&#x27;s design flaws, including a less exposed command bridge and larger fighter complement. The ship is armed with thousands of turbolasers and ion cannons, sufficient firepower to slug it out with capital ships or reduce planetary surfaces to molten slag. Additional point-defense laser turrets and missile launchers are used to attack more nimble opponents. Two wings of TIE fighters can be quickly launched from dorsal flight decks and side hangars, and for planetary assaults, the ship carries a full legion of over 8,000 stormtroopers and over a hundred assault vehicles.

The &quot;Finalizer&quot; features as the command ship for both Kylo Ren and General Hux during their journeys in &quot;The Force Awakens&quot; and &quot;Star Wars: The Last Jedi&quot; (2017). However, sometime before as the events of &quot;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker&quot; (2019), Resistance hero Finn managed to sneak aboard and severely damaged the ship. This forced Ren to transfer his command over to a new &quot;Resurgent&quot;-class Star Destroyer, the &quot;Steadfast&quot;, and reduced Hux to a junior member of the First Order Supreme Council.

=== Cultural influence===
When the &quot;Finalizer&quot;&#x27;s name was first revealed, Brent McKnight of MovieWeb felt like it was both silly and frightening, saying &quot;[i]t sounds like something a little kid would come up with, but it’s also super ominous and intimidating at the same time.&quot; He also observed the design was instantly recognizable as a Star Destroyer while having appropriate differences to represent the thirty years that took place between its introduction in the story and the original. B. Alan Orange of MovieWeb also felt the design of the &quot;Finalizer&quot; was intimidating and scary while still being instantly recognizable as a Star Destoyer. They also believed it had the &quot;perfect pulp name&quot;, keeping in theme with the movie&#x27;s new superweapon, Starkiller Base.

YouTube content creator &quot;LegoSpencer&quot; was inspired to build a model of the TIE fighter hangar bay on the &quot;Finalizer&quot;, a process which took six weeks to complete.

== Mega Star Destroyer ==
The &quot;Mega&quot;-class Star Dreadnought &quot;Supremacy&quot; made its first theatrical appearance in The Last Jedi (2017). Described as the command ship for Supreme Leader Snoke, it was stated to be 60 kilometers wide, making it significantly larger than any previous Super Star Destroyer.

=== Concept and design ===
Director Rian Johnson came up for the idea of basing the &quot;Supremacy&quot; on a flying wing, picking the final exterior look from concept art created by design supervisor Kevin Jenkins. &quot;It&#x27;s a big flying city,&quot; said Jenkins. &quot;Vader&#x27;s &quot;Executor&quot; is simply a headquarters, but Snoke doesn&#x27;t have a planet, so he lives on the ship.&quot; The &quot;Supremacy&quot;&#x27;s bridge was also designed by Jenkins, who wanted it to mirror the wideness of the ship itself.

=== Depiction ===
Described as the only &quot;Mega&quot;-class Star Destroyer in the galaxy, the &quot;Supremacy&quot; is wide, long and high. It has a crew of 2,225,000 personnel, a majority of whom are adolescents training to become officers and stormtroopers. The &quot;Supremacy&quot; serves as the capital from which Supreme Leader Snoke commands the First Order. Thousands of heavy turbolasers, antiship missile batteries, heavy ion cannons and tractor beam projectors give the ship firepower equivalent to an entire fleet. The vessel also possesses an industrial capacity that would rival most planets, with asteroid mining complexes, foundries, production lines, research labs and training centers. Six external and two internal stations allow &quot;Resurgent&quot;-class Star Destroyers to dock with the Mega-Destroyer.

=== Analysis ===
Martin Docherty of Space.com looked at the possible physics behind the scene in &quot;The Last Jedi&quot; where Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo destroys the &quot;Supremacy&quot; by ramming it at lightspeed with the &quot;Raddus&quot;. Using the estimate that the &quot;Raddus&quot; massed 8.88 billion kilograms and was traveling at 99.9% of the speed of light, it would have a Lorentz factor of 22.366 and impact with a final kinetic energy of 17x1027 joules. Such an impact would create shrapnel which, while moving slower than lightspeed, would still cause immense damage, as was seen in the movie.

=== Cultural influence ===
Upon the first reveal of the &quot;Supremacy&quot;, B. Alan Orange noted that, despite the ship&#x27;s unique design, it still retained a familiar shape which immediately identified it as belonging to the First Order. Corey Larson of Screen Rant believed that, regardless of the film&#x27;s wider reputation, the introduction of the &quot;Supremacy&quot; and it&#x27;s subsequent destruction during &quot;The Last Jedi&quot; represented one of the coolest additions to the franchise from the Star Wars sequel trilogy. John Orquiola meanwhile felt the ship represented an ongoing superweapon problem with the franchise. While crediting Rian with not introducing another Death Star-like weapon, it still showed that the First Order, like the Empire before it, was obsessed with equating size with power and creating &quot;unbeatable&quot; superweapons which are eventually destroyed.

== Sith Star Destroyer ==
In &quot;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker&quot; (2019), a resurrected Darth Sidious unveils a new class of Star Destroyer as part of the Sith Eternal&#x27;s fleet, the Final Order. Identified by in-universe sources as &quot;Xyston&quot;-class but referred to informally as Sith Star Destroyers, these ships resemble the older &quot;Imperial I&quot;-class Star Destroyers but are larger with a length of and height of . Built on Exegol by automated factories and with a total crew of 29,585 personnel, the distinguishing feature of these Sith Star Destroyers is an axial superlaser powerful enough to shatter a planet, made possible by a powerful reactor channeling the energy of a miniature sun through kyber crystals. Other weaponry includes 40 heavy turbolaser batteries, 40 ion cannons, 40 point-defense laser cannons, 35 warhead launchers, and 10 heavy tractor beam projectors, though the space for a hangar and other storage facilities is taken up by the superlaser.

== List of other Star Destroyers ==
*Victory Star Destroyer: The &quot;Victory&quot;-class Star Destroyer originally featured only in Star Wars Legends novellas (see below). It first appeared in the new Star Wars canon in the 2014 novel &quot;Tarkin&quot;, written by James Luceno, and was first depicted in &quot;Darth Vader 6: Vader, Part VI&quot;, a 2015 comic book written by Kieron Gillen and illustrated by Salvador Larroca. The &quot;Victory&quot; Star Destroyer is the Imperial Navy&#x27;s starting vessel in the core set of Fantasy Flight Games&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars: Armada&quot;, a table top miniatures game released on March 27, 2015.

== &quot;Star Wars Legends&quot; ==
In April 2014, most of the licensed &quot;Star Wars&quot; novels, games, and comics produced since 1976 (and prior to 2014), were rebranded by Lucasfilm as Star Wars Legends; and therefore declared non-canon to the franchise.

Star Destroyers feature in numerous &quot;Legends&quot; publications, with a considerable amount of additional notable information. According to West End Games&#x27; &quot;Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game&quot; sourcebooks and other texts, &quot;Imperial&quot;-class Star Destroyers are constructed by Kuat Drive Yards and hold a distinguished place in the Imperial Navy, symbolizing the Empire&#x27;s military might with a peak number of more than 25,000 vessels. Like the &quot;Venator&quot; and &quot;Victory&quot;-class ships that precede it, the &quot;Imperial&quot;-class is a multi-role capital ship combining the roles of a battleship, starfighter carrier, and troopship. Notable for its massive size and overwhelming firepower compared to its fore-bearers; a single &quot;Imperial&quot;-class ship is capable of singlehandedly taking on a fleet of enemy vessels or &quot;reducing the surface of a planet to a slag&quot; (known as &quot;Base Delta Zero&quot;), and its mere presence is often enough to deter rebellion. At long, &quot;Imperial&quot;-class Star Destroyers are crewed by 9,235 Officers, 27,850 enlisted personnel, and 275 Gunners. The &quot;Imperial I&quot; is armed with 60 turbolasers, 60 ion cannons, and 10 tractor beam projectors for space combat. The standard complement is 72 TIE fighters (including 12 TIE Bombers and 12-24 TIE Interceptors), and a variety of support craft including shuttles and transports. Unlike other comparable capital ships like the Mon Calamari MC80 Star Cruiser of the Rebel Alliance (later New Republic), an &quot;Imperial&quot;-class Star Destroyer carries a full array of ground forces (including 9700 stormtroopers, 20 AT-ATs and 30 AT-STs) with dropships for rapid deployment to planetary surfaces, plus a prefabricated base if a permanent planetary garrison is required.

Though the Imperial Navy also has smaller capital ships like Nebulon-B Escort Frigates and CR90 Corvettes (the films show these vessels being used exclusively by the Rebel Alliance), &quot;Imperial&quot;-class Star Destroyers are usually the default choice for frontline deployments. At the Battle of Endor the Rebel Alliance captured two &quot;Imperial&quot;-class Star Destroyers and added them to the New Republic fleet; they serve alongside Mon Calamari Cruisers in General Han Solo&#x27;s task force as told in the X-wing series of novels and Dark Empire comics. Although the New Republic eventually upgrades its starfleet with newer ship types, the &quot;Imperial&quot;-class Star Destroyer remains in service well into the &quot;New Jedi Order&quot; era and fights during the Yuuzhan Vong War.

Described in &quot;A Guide to the Star Wars Universe&quot; (1984) as being long, &quot;Executor&quot;-class Super Star Destroyers were later described as being long. In addition to Vader&#x27;s command ship &quot;Executor&quot;, &quot;Star Wars&quot; novels introduce the prison ship &quot;Lusankya&quot; and stealth-armored &quot; Knight Hammer&quot; as other in the class. Kevin J. Anderson&#x27;s novel &quot;Darksaber&quot; describes a Super Star Destroyer as being &quot;worth twenty Imperial Star Destroyers&quot;.

The description &quot;Star Destroyer&quot; and &quot;Super Star Destroyer&quot; are applied to several another massive dagger/triangle-shaped warships in &quot;Star Wars&quot;, such as the &quot;Pellaeon&quot;-class Star Destroyer in the &quot;Legacy&quot; comic series (2006–2010), and the reborn Emperor Palpatine&#x27;s flagships &quot;Eclipse&quot; and &quot;Eclipse II&quot; Super Star Destroyers in the Dark Empire series (1991–1995). The &quot;Eclipse&quot;-class was perhaps the ultimate Super Star Destroyer or Star Dreadnought in the Expanded Universe, incorporating a Death Star-type superlaser but miniaturized and more advanced, and gravity well projectors to prevent enemies from jumping to hyperspace, and having strong enough shields/armor to be able to ram enemy vessels. Curtis Saxton, in the unofficial &quot;Star Wars Technical Commentaries&quot; (he has since been the author of the official &quot;Star Wars: Attack of the Clones Incredible Cross-Sections&quot; and &quot;Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith Incredible Cross-Sections&quot;), has advocated using the term &quot;Imperator&quot;-class in lieu of &quot;Imperial&quot;-class. Saxton argues that &quot;Imperial Star Destroyer&quot; is a somewhat generic term, as the vast majority of Star Destroyer types are operated by the Galactic Empire&#x27;s Imperial Navy which technically means they are all &quot;Imperial Star Destroyers&quot;, although the &quot;Imperator&quot;/&quot;Imperial&quot;-class Star Destroyers are by far the most common type. Similarly, the &quot;Super Star Destroyer&quot; moniker has been used for numerous unrelated vessels of varying sizes and classes, so fans have suggested labeling the class instead of by the lead ship such as &quot;Executor&quot;-class and &quot;Eclipse&quot;-class, with some referring to them instead as a &quot;Star Dreadnought&quot; (sometimes spelled &quot;Star Dreadnaught&quot;) to emphasize their massive size relative to Star Destroyers. Author Jason Fry introduced the &quot;Anaxes War College System&quot; which specifically divide warships into different types depending on their size and power, which explain all the differently sized &quot;Super Star Destroyers&quot; appearing in the Expanded Universe (now &quot;Star Wars&quot; Legends), supplementing the contradictory classification systems used in Star Wars lore previously, becoming reference material in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; Sourcebooks by West End Games.

The &quot;Victory&quot;-class Star Destroyer first described in the early &quot;Star Wars&quot; novella, was initially designed as a direct predecessor to the &quot;Imperial&quot;-class during the development of &quot;A New Hope&quot;, which would make it a follow-up to the &quot;Venator&quot;-class seen in &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;. The &quot;Victory&quot; appears very similar in appearance to the &quot;Imperial&quot;-class which succeeded it; albeit the &quot;Victory&quot; being considerably smaller in scale (900 meters in length versus 1600 meters), adds atmospheric maneuvering &quot;wings&quot; on the port and starboard sides (according to &quot;Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game&quot; sourcebooks, the &quot;Victory I&quot;-class can enter a planetary atmosphere which is a unique attribute not found in the &quot;Victory II&quot; and &quot;Imperial&quot;-class Star Destroyers), and a shorter conning tower with different elements on the command bridge. The &quot;Victory&quot;-class was developed from a prototype Star Destroyer model created by Colin Cantwell for &quot;A New Hope&quot;, with the final design being used for the basis of the &quot;Imperial&quot;-class.

<text>The TIE fighter or Twin Ion Engine fighter is a series of fictional starfighters featured in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe. TIE fighters are depicted as fast, agile, yet fragile starfighters produced by Sienar Fleet Systems for the Galactic Empire and by Sienar-Jaemus Fleet Systems for the First Order and the Sith Eternal. TIE fighters and other TIE craft appear in &quot;Star Wars&quot; films, television shows, and throughout the &quot;Star Wars&quot; expanded universe. Several TIE fighter replicas and toys, as well as a TIE flight simulator, have been produced and sold by many companies.

== Origin and design ==
Colin Cantwell created the concept model that established the TIE fighter&#x27;s ball-cockpit and hexagonal panels design for &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977). &quot;Star Wars&quot; creator George Lucas liked the basic design consisting of two panels connected by a stick with a ball-shaped cockpit, but Cantwell&#x27;s concept had few details. Joe Johnston created additional details, such as the cockpit window and the attachment points between the solar panels and the hull.

Initially given a blue color scheme, the TIE fighter models for the first film were grey to film better against a bluescreen; TIE fighters in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980) and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983) shifted back to being a muted blue. Sound designer Ben Burtt created the distinctive sound of the TIE fighter in flight by combining an elephant call with a car driving on wet pavement. In the book &quot;The Sounds of Star Wars&quot;, the engine roar is likened to German Junker Ju 87 &quot;Stuka&quot; bombers, which used sirens to frighten civilians during air raids. This could have been a possible inspiration for the sound. Combat scenes between TIE fighters and the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot; and Rebel Alliance X-wing fighters in &quot;Star Wars&quot; were meant to be reminiscent of World War II dogfight footage; editors used World War II air combat clips as placeholders while Industrial Light &amp; Magic completed the movie&#x27;s special effects. Darth Vader&#x27;s distinct TIE Advanced x1 in &quot;Star Wars&quot; was designed to make it instantly recognizable, and the TIE Interceptors featured in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; were designed to look fast, deadly, sleek and frightening.

The Jedi starfighter, created for &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; (2005)&quot;,&quot; was designed to bridge the appearance of the Jedi starfighter in &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot; (2002) and the TIE fighter design from the original trilogy. The V-wing starfighter, seen at the end of &quot;Revenge of the Sith,&quot; also makes the distinctive TIE fighter sound when flying by a Star Destroyer. Dark Horse Comics&#x27; Sean Cooke designed the TIE predator for &quot;Star Wars: Legacy&quot; (2006), set 130 years after the events of &quot;Star Wars&quot;, to appear both reminiscent of and more advanced than the original TIE fighter.

Designers for &quot;The Force Awakens&quot; (2015) had numerous discussions about how much to &quot;update&quot; the TIE fighter for the first sequel film set 30 years after &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. They retained the starfighter&#x27;s design but altered its aesthetic to suggest improvements to the vessel&#x27;s manufacturing process and materials.

== Depiction ==
&quot;Star Wars&quot; literature states that Grand Moff Tarkin commissioned Sienar Fleet Systems to design and manufacture the Twin Ion Engine line edition (TIE/ln) space superiority starfighter and most TIE variants. Tarkin specified that the TIE had to be fast, maneuverable, energy-efficient, and inexpensive; simply put they are meant to be easily mass-produced and engage in swarm tactics, with the expectation of being expendable assets that would be lost in combat. To meet these requirements, Sienar incorporated aspects of the V-wing and Jedi interceptor into the new starfighter.

TIE fighters have two hexagonal wings fitted with solar panels which power a twin ion engine (TIE) system that accelerates ionized gases at a substantial fraction of lightspeed along almost any vector, affording the ships tremendous speed and maneuverability albeit with limited fuel reserves. These wings are also structurally sound enough to double as landing gear and feature repulsorlifts for take-off and landing, though TIE fighters are designed to be launched and recovered by cycling storage racks used by Imperial starships and garrisons. The TIE fighter&#x27;s primary weapons are a pair of laser cannons tied to a secondary generator and mated with an advanced targeting computer which assists the pilot in hitting other fast-moving starfighters. The fighter does not possess deflector shields, and while its light armoring is proof against small arms and glancing micrometeoroids a direct hit from a laser cannon will destroy it, encouraging pilots to shoot first and make their shots count. The TIE fighter also lacks a hyperdrive, not only to save on weight and cost but to discourage defection. Although the TIE fighter&#x27;s cockpit is pressurized and equipped with oxygen scrubbers to prevent corrosion, it lacks life-support systems, requiring pilots to wear special flight suits. TIE fighters are equipped with ejection seats, though in older &quot;Legends&quot; sources there was disagreement on this issue.

&quot;Star Wars&quot; literature also holds that TIE fighter pilots are considered an elite group within the Imperial Navy, relying on their quick reflexes and fearlessness to survive multiple tours of duty. Training involves hundreds of flight hours learning to coordinate as a team and intense psychological conditioning to put the accomplishment of their mission above other considerations. As such most TIE fighter pilots have a life expectancy of less than a year. TIE fighter pilots wear self-contained flight suits with life-support systems connected to reinforced vacuum-sealed flight helmets. These helmets feature ship-linked communications and displays.

===TIE variants===

In addition to the standard TIE/ln fighter (also available as the TIE Light Duty training craft, as seen in the &quot;Jump to Lightspeed&quot; expansion pack to &quot;Star Wars Galaxies&quot;), a variety of other TIE craft appear throughout the films. 
;In &quot;Star Wars&quot; film and television
====Imperial variants====
*TIE Advanced x1: Darth Vader flies a TIE Advanced x1 (or just &quot;TIE/x1&quot;) in many media, most notably in the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; during the climatic Death Star battle. According to background material, the limited-run TIE Advanced x1 was designed to Vader&#x27;s personal specifications and was only flown by himself and select Imperial pilots. Compared to the TIE fighter it is faster and more maneuverable with greater structural integrity, equipped with a deflector shield, hyperdrive, reinforced armor-plated hull and improved SFS L-s9.3 laser cannons. The &quot;bent-wing&quot; configuration was intended to improve energy collection while maintaining the same speed and maneuverability.

*TIE/sa bomber: Introduced in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, TIE/sa bombers are seen bombing asteroids in the hunt for the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot;. The design stems from an unused &quot;TIE boarding craft&quot; concept originally developed for &quot;A New Hope&quot;. The TIE bomber&#x27;s double-hull design led ILM&#x27;s modelmakers to dub the ship a &quot;double chili dog&quot; fighter. The TIE/sa, or TIE Surface Assault Bomber, was designed within the Star Wars universe for the Imperial Navy to conduct surgical strikes against targets in space or on planetary surfaces. It features two cylindrical pods: the starboard-side pod housing the pilot in a pressurized cockpit with a pair of L-s1 laser cannons, and a port-side pod carrying two bomb bays that can launch a variety of ordnance including missiles, bombs and orbital mines. Its &quot;bent-wing&quot; configuration increased the energy-collection surface area to match the bomber&#x27;s power requirements while a reinforced hull allowed the bomber survive back-blast during atmospheric bombing.
*TIE/sh shuttle: Also featured in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, a TIE/sh shuttle is seen ferrying Captain Needa (Michael Culver) to Darth Vader&#x27;s Super Star Destroyer. Like the TIE/sa bomber, this shuttle design stems from an unused &quot;TIE boarding craft&quot; concept developed for &quot;A New Hope&quot;. Known also within the setting as the TIE Command Shuttle, the craft was based on the TIE/sa bomber but replaced the bombardier pod with a luxurious cabin suitable for Imperial dignitaries and naval officers. In the event the vessel is attacked, the TIE shuttle carries a pair of laser cannons and deflector shields.

*TIE/IN interceptor: TIE/IN interceptor – faster TIE fighters with dagger-shaped wings in the forward profile of those of the TIE Advanced and four laser cannons – appear at various points in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. Two scales of TIE interceptor models were used during filming. Their in-universe origin was to meet the Empire&#x27;s requirement for a fighter superior to the Rebellion&#x27;s X-wing and Y-wing fleet when it was determined a full production run of the TIE Advanced x1 would be too expensive. Faster and more maneuverable than a standard TIE fighter, these interceptors are also better armed with wingtip-mounted L-s9.3 laser cannons with the option to carry two more under the cockpit.
*TIE Advanced v1: Meant to appear as the prototype precursor to Vader&#x27;s TIE Advanced x1, the TIE Advanced v1 featured in &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot; as craft piloted by the Empire&#x27;s Inquisitors. The v1&#x27;s variable-geometry wings, like Darth Maul&#x27;s shuttle &quot;Scimitar&quot;&#x27;s, were inspired by Ralph McQuarrie&#x27;s original sketches for the x1. The fighters&#x27; fictional origin is inspired by the Jedi interceptor flown during the Clone Wars, as seen by its heavily-armored wings that fold inward. With laser cannons and ion engines more powerful than the TIE fighter, the TIE Advanced v1 also features a projectile launcher with a 20 missile magazine, deflector shields and pressurized cockpit. The TIE/v1 debuted in the &quot;Rebels&quot; Season 1 episode &quot;Empire Day&quot;, which featured its maiden flight, but a very similar spacecraft (most likely intended to be the same) was described in the 2014 book &quot;Star Wars: Imperial Handbook: A Commander&#x27;s Guide&quot;, which has been confirmed to fall into the &quot;Legends&quot; continuity, which had by then been decanonized.
*TIE/d Defender: The TIE/d Defender made its television debut in &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot;, although it first appeared in the 1994 space flight simulator &quot;Star Wars: TIE Fighter&quot; as player-pilotable craft. In the previous Star Wars &quot;Legends&quot; continuity, the TIE Defender was originally designed by Admiral Zaarin, who in the 1994 game would betray the Empire and have to be defeated by the player character. Its background was later changed in &quot;Star Wars: Tales of the Empire&quot; to being designed by Morgan Elsbeth. Classified as a fighter-bomber, its unique tri-wing design gives it better visibility than a TIE interceptor while making it faster than all previous TIE models. Each wing is equipped with maneuvering jets and a pair of L-s9.3 laser cannons, with another pair and twin projectile launchers fitted on the cockpit pod. The TIE/d Defender also carries deflector shields and a hyperdrive.
*TIE/sk x1 Striker: The TIE/sk x1 experimental air superiority fighter, also known as the TIE Striker, made its first appearance in &quot;Rogue One&quot; defending the Imperial base on Scarif. Background material on the model describes how it was specifically designed for atmospheric patrols of Imperial ground installations because of the standard TIE fighter&#x27;s disadvantage in atmospheric combat. With its more aerodynamic design and specialized repulsorlift engines, the TIE Striker can fly faster than a TIE fighter or X-wing in an atmosphere and is heavily armed with four L-s9.3 laser cannons, two H-s1 heavy laser cannons, and a bomb bay. Its spacious cockpit can hold a pilot and an optional gunner/bombardier.
*TIE/rp Reaper: The TIE/rp Reaper Attack Lander also made its first appearance in &quot;Rogue One&quot; as support craft with a larger, more angular design that replaces the spherical cockpit found on most TIE fighters. Within the Star Wars universe, these craft were based on the TIE/sk x1 Striker with similar wing configuration but much larger to carry elite Imperial troops into battle. The TIE/rp Reaper features armor plating, deflector shields and electronic countermeasures to ensure it can survive hostile airspace to deliver its cargo. It also carries a hyperdrive for faster-than-light travel and a pair of L-s9.3 laser cannons.
*TIE Boarding Craft: The TIE Boarding Craft made its theatrical appearance in &quot;Rogue One&quot;. The design was originally set to appear in the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; but was cut from the film and used as inspiration for the TIE bomber and TIE shuttle. Background literature states that the TIE Boarding Craft shared many of the same features as the TIE bomber but with seating for twelve passengers and a boarding hatch equipped with laser cutters. Other equipment included deflector shields, twin L-s1 laser cannons, twin H-s1 heavy laser cannons and missile launcher.
*TIE reinforcement battery heavy starfighter: The TIE/rb, known also as the TIE Brute, first appeared in &quot;&quot; chasing the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot; during the Kessel Run scene. Star Wars literature states that the TIE/rb was commissioned to help deal with pirates, smugglers and other outlaws operating in the Outer Rim. Larger than a standard TIE fighter, the TIE/rb features heavier armor plating and carries a pair of H-s9.3 laser cannons – nearly twice as powerful as a TIE fighter&#x27;s cannons – on a separate artillery pod. Because it was sluggish to fly, the TIE Brute features an integrated droid intelligence to assist the pilot.
*TIE Crawler: Also known as the Century Tank or the TIE Tank, the vehicle was a tank resembling a TIE fighter but equipped with treaded tracks.
*Outland TIE fighter: The Outland TIE fighter made its television appearance in &quot;The Mandalorian&quot;. Otherwise congruent to the appearance of a standard TIE fighter, the Outland TIE fighter&#x27;s wings folded when landing on a levelled surface, dissimilar to that of an X-wing in an open position. In addition, landing gears were concealed inside the bottom of the cockpit to allow for ease of use and stability. The personal starfighter of Moff Gideon, flown by the Moff himself, was used by his Imperial remnant during the New Republic Era, though the Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin took down the starfighter.

====First Order variants====
*TIE/fo space superiority fighter: &quot;The Force Awakens&quot; features the First Order TIE/fo space superiority fighter, which is superficially similar to the Empire&#x27;s original TIE fighter but with several technological upgrades. Built by Sienar-Jaemus Fleet Systems, it features superior firepower, speed and maneuverability with a pair of SJSF L-s9.6 laser cannons and twin SJFS P-s6 ion engines aided by superior solar cell wings and higher-capacity energy converters. Perhaps the biggest difference is the fact that the TIE/fo features deflector shields – a recognition by the First Order that compared to the Galactic Empire it must take measures to safeguard its more limited supply of pilots.
*TIE/sf space superiority fighter: Also featured in &quot;The Force Awakens&quot; is the TIE/sf fighter, one of which is stolen by Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and Finn (John Boyega) as they escape the First Order. Piloted by members of the First Order Special Forces, this model is superior to the First Order&#x27;s TIE/fo. It is equipped with a hyperdrive, superior shielding, twin ion reactors, a pair of forward-facing L-s9.6 laser cannons, an aft Lb-14 dual heavy laser turret with full 360-degree rotation, and a missile/mag-pulse launcher.
*TIE/ba interceptor: First appearing in &quot;Star Wars Resistance&quot;, the TIE/ba interceptor is a model of TIE interceptor deployed by the First Order. One ship was used by Major Elrik Vonreg during the late-New Republic era in his encounters with the New Republic and the Resistance. 
*TIE silencer: First appearing in &quot;Star Wars: The Last Jedi&quot;, the TIE/vn Silencer is the Interceptor-winged personal starfighter of Kylo Ren.
*TIE whisper: Kylo Ren flies a custom-model TIE/wi fighter in &quot;The Rise of Skywalker&quot;.

====Sith Eternal variants====
*TIE/dg starfighter: Also known as the Sith TIE fighter, the TIE Dagger featured in &quot;The Rise of Skywalker&quot; as a red triangular-wing model of TIE fighter forged in secret for forces operating under the resurrected Darth Sidious.

;In &quot;Star Wars Legends&quot; continuity
A number of different TIE designs made their appearance in what is now considered Star Wars &quot;Legends&quot;, a separate continuity that was split off after Disney acquired the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise. The TIE/sa was the inspiration for the triple-hulled TIE lander, featured in &quot;Star Wars&quot; No. 60 and in &quot;Star Wars: Complete Locations&quot;. Red-modified TIE interceptors are also used by the Emperor&#x27;s Royal Guards, as featured in &quot;Rage of the Wookiees&quot;, another expansion of &quot;Star Wars Galaxies&quot;.

Additionally, LucasArts &quot;Star Wars&quot; video games introduce several TIE variants, such as the TIE Hunter starfighter in &quot;Rogue Squadron III&quot; and the TIE Mauler surface vehicle in &quot;Empire at War&quot;. The TIE/ad fighter (nicknamed &quot;TIE Advanced&quot; or &quot;Avenger&quot; in-game and derived from Vader&#x27;s TIE Advanced x1 fighter) and TIE/D Defender — heavily upgraded derivatives of previous craft seen in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe — first appear in &quot;TIE Fighter&quot; as player-pilotable craft. The plot of &quot;Rebel Assault II&quot; revolves around destroying the Empire&#x27;s ability to manufacture the cloaking TIE Phantom starfighter, and a campaign in &quot;X-Wing Alliance&quot; centers on destroying experimental remote-controlled TIE fighters.

&quot;Star Wars&quot; literature also introduces TIE varieties. TIE raptors attack Rogue Squadron in &quot;Solo Command&quot;. TYE wings – TIE fighter and Y-wing hybrids – appear both in &quot;I, Jedi&quot; and &quot;Rogue Squadron: Masquerade&quot;. Dark Horse&#x27;s &quot;Dark Empire&quot; introduces both the droid-piloted TIE/D and the TIE crawler &quot;century tank&quot;. West End Games&#x27; roleplaying sourcebooks introduce varieties that include the TIE/fc fire-control support ship, the TIE/gt ground-attack fighter, the TIE/rc reconnaissance vessel, and the TIE scout.

== Cultural impact ==
A TIE fighter model used in filming the climax of &quot;Star Wars&quot; sold at auction for $350,000, and another TIE fighter from the film sold at auction for $402,500. Fans built a 16-foot-by-20-foot, 1,000-pound TIE fighter float to commemorate &quot;Star Wars&quot;&#x27; thirtieth anniversary as part of the 2007 Gala Parade in Crystal Lake, Illinois. A &quot;Wired&quot; editor&#x27;s creation of a TIE fighter model out of Starbucks cups and stirrers prompted the magazine to create a contest for its readers to submit their own art out of similar Starbucks material. io9 mocked the variety of TIE fighters in the franchise, listing four TIE models on its list of the eleven &quot;silliest&quot; &quot;Star Wars&quot; ships.

Kenner released TIE fighter and TIE interceptor toys during the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy&#x27;s theatrical release, and Kenner&#x27;s die-cast TIE bomber is a rare collector&#x27;s item. Hasbro also released TIE fighter, TIE bomber, and TIE interceptor toys. Both Kenner and Hasbro also manufactured TIE fighter pilot action figures. Lego manufactured TIE fighter, TIE bomber, TIE interceptor, TIE defender, and TIE advanced models. Decipher and Wizards of the Coast published various TIE starfighter and TIE-related cards for the &quot;Star Wars Customizable Card Game&quot; and &quot;Star Wars Trading Card Game&quot;, respectively. In 2012, Fantasy Flight Games released &quot;Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game&quot;, a miniatures game with pre-painted and to scale miniature X-wings and TIE fighters. In 1994, LucasArts released the &quot;TIE Fighter&quot; flight simulator, which casts the player as an Imperial pilot flying a variety of TIE starfighters. TIE starfighters and their variants are also playable in third- or first-person perspectives in several &quot;Star Wars&quot; titles.

In Sasuke (also known as &quot;Ninja Warrior&quot;), TIE Fighter (Japanese: タイファイター) was a obstacle that introduced in the 32nd competition as the second obstacle in the First Stage. Competitors must prop their hands and feet against a set of glass panels that much resemble to the two hexagonal solar energy-collecting wings of TIE Fighter, position themselves and slide down a track to reach the safety platform at the other side. Due to the expiration of the license before the 36th competition, the TIE Fighter was renamed the Wing Slider (Japanese: ウィングスライダー), and was redesigned to reflect this.

In 2018, a number of &quot;Star Wars&quot; starfighters had their aerodynamic abilities tested using the Autodesk Flow Design virtual wind tunnel program. Of those studied, the TIE Fighter scored the worst with a drag coefficient of .98, which is only slightly better than a brick. Of the other TIE variants tested, the TIE interceptor was slightly better with a coefficient of .78, while the TIE Striker had the best at .48, though this did not compare favorably to the .02 drag coefficient of an F-4E Phantom. These poor results were rationalized with the in-universe explanations that drag coefficient plays no role in space travel, and that &quot;Star Wars&quot; fighters can use repulsorlifts and deflector shields to give themselves better flight profiles.
